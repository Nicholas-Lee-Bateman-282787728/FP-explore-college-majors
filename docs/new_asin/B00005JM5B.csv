1477402,3,B00005JM5B,"I just saw this with my husband & daughter.  I enjoyed it; they hated it.  One thing I did NOT like was their portrayal of Captain Nemo.  Perhaps it is faithful to the comic, which I have not read, but to me Captain Nemo is & always will be James Mason, as in Disney's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.  I did, however, find Tom Sawyer adorable and Dorian Grey drop-dead gorgeous.  Hyde was a low-budget Hulk and Jekyll was a tortured wimp who managed to come through when push came to shove.  The settings were not realistic looking, but I'd bet that has to do with the ""comic book"" feel of the movie.  There were a few funny bits, as when Captain Nemo's first mate said, ""Call me Ishmael,"" or when the secret service agent who called them together said, ""My superiors call me M,"" a reference of course to Connery's James Bond.  I think Connery followed well in the footsteps of the two previous Quartermaines that I've seen, Stewart Granger and, believe it or not, Richard Chamberlain, and I rather liked the Invisible Man.  It wasn't a bad hour and forty minutes, but I wouldn't recommend it as anything but camp with a little eye candy for men (Mina is quite attractive) and women.  Don't pay full price for this--see it at a matinee!",1057968000,,1234,4.444444444444445
1477403,4,B00005JM5B,"The thing that I found most interesting about this movie is that the characters are all based off of classic books! For instance, Tom Sawyer, Allan Quatermain, Dr. Jekyll, and so on. This movie is action packed, from beginning to end, and there were some unexpected twists.
All in all i really liked this movie and thought it very original and will definitely go buy it when it is out.",1057968000,,385,4.514285714285714
1477404,5,B00005JM5B,"Don't go into this movie expecting ""A Beautiful Mind.""  Take it for what it's supposed to be, an entertaining thrill-of-a-movie to whisk you away for a summer afternoon or evening.  And ""LXG"" is bound to please most moviegoers at least.  It's got something for everyone.  Tons of action (and I mean that literally) for just about every male on the planet, literary references for those of you (like myself) who enjoy the pleasure of a good classic, and there's no denying the sex appeal of many of its stars.  For the guys, there's the sultry Peta Wilson and, for us ladies, who better to be showcased than Sean Connery with some excellent backup from Shane West (my personal favorite) and Stuart Townsend.  I also liked the general way in which the characters were presented.  There's a depth to them absent from most ""comic book"" movie players.  So, laugh out loud with the Invisible Man, and relish the main plot twist.  It's well worth your $8.",1057881600,,948,4.696969696969697
1477405,5,B00005JM5B,"I've never read the comics so I won't compare it to the original. I don't think any movie should be compared to the original story anyway, as printed media and film are two completely different art forms.
I rate this film a 5 because it lived up to the previews - there's a ton of action, beautiful and complex sets, cinematography, and fantastic stars radiating star quality. This is definitely Sean Connery's movie, but the rest of the League show their stuff to great advantage too, so it's not just a one-man show.
Captain Nemo, played by an Indian actor who was in ""Monsoon Wedding"" is really great. Mina Harker, the Vampire, is played by the beautiful Peta Wilson from ""La Femme Nikita"" fame (television series, not the original movie). The League also includes Dr Jekyl/Mr. Hyde, whose Hyde is kind of like The Hulk, Tom Sawyer, an Invisible Man, and the immortal Dorian Gray.
An evil villain known as ""The Shadow"" is setting out to create the first World War 20 years before one actually happens by posing as Germans and wreaking havoc in England, then posing as the Brits and wreaking havoc in Germany. His aim is to make a huge profit on armaments - he's created the first automatic gun.
The League members track him down and try to put a stop to his dastardly plan, cracking jokes with aplomb. The movie has the same kind of tone and fun mood as ""The Mummy"" and the first ""Indiana Jones."" It wants to entertain us with heroic deeds, exotic locales and good humor. It rarely takes itself too seriously, never underestimates the audience, and the special effects are seamless, with plenty of pyrotechnics and practically the entire city of Venice crashing like dominoes one by one.
The film moves very quickly. The storytelling is quite spare and to the point, with only a few quiet breaks in between the action. There's a nice reveal as things turn out to be not quite what they seem but I won't spoil it for you.
If you're into this kind of film (you should be able to tell from the previews) you'll enjoy it. I found it to be worth the full price of admission and am looking forward to owning it on DVD.",1057881600,,2115,4.5248041775456915
1477406,3,B00005JM5B,"(3 & 1/2 stars) The reviews of this Connery flick seem to be running mostly in the negative column.  I enjoyed it myself, as there was always enough happening and enough to look at on the screen to keep me entertained.  Sure, it wasn't perfect, but it was still better than something like that Hulk movie.  Setting it at the turn of the last century was fairly unique for this kind of movie.
The concept of these historical characters of fiction banding together was handled pretty well.  It was intriguing to think about Mina Harker as a ""good"" vampire (like Angel on TV, I guess).  The special effects were effective, especially the mini-explosions that happen when Jeckyl is changing into Hyde or back.  There were a few nagging questions or criticisms inmy mind about things like how an evil Hyde can keep doing good things (although the film does attempt to explain it), but those did not bother me enough to become distracting.  The story pretty much carried me along from beginning to end and kept me interested.  I never found it ""boring"" as some people have.
The only thing that really DID bother me was how blurry things got in many of the action scenes -- people and objects moving across the screen too fast for the eye to follow, the camera jumping around from point to point in confusing ways.  That got frustrating to watch, and it did detract somewhat from those scenes.",1057881600,3,1386,4.624489795918367

1477408,4,B00005JM5B,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen comics and have collected them all. It is an amazing comic, and I was thrilled to hear it was being turned into a movie. However, I have read the previous reviews here and have spent time in chatrooms, and am finally fed up with the endless whining from the ""purists"" who constantly bemoan the fact that the movie has been changed from the books. Has there ever been a movie which has possessed every detail of the book it was taken from? Does that make it less of an achievement? Too many people are ready to write off this movie because it is different from the comic. Grow up! Learn to appreciate this for what it is. It is telling an exciting story in a very different format. Let's be grateful that a beloved comic is generating this kind of attention! I for one am very excited about this movie.",1057708800,11,886,4.311377245508982
1477409,3,B00005JM5B,"First, this is not a review about the upcoming movie, ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.""  I intend to have my children take me to see the movie for my birthday and will write a review at that time.  This is a rant (with a touch of raving) about the ad campaign that 20th Century Fox has put together for this film.
I have seen the teaser for this film and at least two different trailers, including the most recent one to make its appearance on television.  Clearly, the main selling point for the film is actor Sean Connery, and that is not something about which I would be inclined to complain.  However, here is a film that can easily be sold to the public in a sentence or two that would run essentially as follows:
""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" brings together the ""original"" superheroes of late 19th-century fiction: Allan Quartermain, Mina Murray Harker, Captain Nemo, the Invisible Man, and Dr. Jekyll (and his alter ego Mr. Hyde.
Now, that was based just on my having read all of the comic books by Mr. Alan Moore & Mr. Kevin O'Neill.  Clearly the film version is doing some tinking with the lineup: Dorian Gray has been added and apparently Dracula's bite had an effect on Mina.  But even the most recent trailer, which talks about ""VAMPIRE"" and ""BEAST"" and such, STILL does not mention who these characters are and that this is not just any invisible man but the creation of H.G. Wells.
Ironically, Connery's character is the least recognizable of the bunch since H. Rider Haggard's ""She"" and ""King's Solomon Mine"" have not had the cinematic exposure of ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" let along ""Dracula.""  Maybe the explanation for this simplistic and stupid ad campaign is that nobody in Hollywood has read let alone heard of those original novels and think that Oscar Wilde writes British drawing room comedies.
But what I know is that every time I have explained to somebody WHO those characters are in the action-packed and pretty confusing trailer for ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" that their interest in seeing the film has at least DOUBLED.  Even if you have only seen the trailers and have not read the comic books, I think you can see the validity of my point.
Will 20th Century Fox get its act together and put out an intelligent trailer before the film opens on July 11th?  Will Allan Quartermain and his associates be able to save the Empire for her majesty Queen Victoria?  I must admit I have much more faith in the abilities of a pulp fiction character than I do the collective intelligence of Hollywood studio executives.  Despite the inept ad campaign I look forward to the movie and to writing an actual review.  Thank you for your attention to this rant.",1053648000,28,2712,4.686315789473684
1477410,5,B00005JM5B,"Just the idea of this rocks.  What would the world be like if the fictional characters from classic literature were ""real"" and interacted with each other in the same world?
Taken from the comic book of the same name the, always interesting Alan Moore created a world where Alan Quartermain, Wilhimina Murray (""Mina"" from Dracula), Dr. Henry Jeckyll (and his alter-ego, naturally), Captain Nemo, and Griffin (the Invisible Man) all exist.  Brought together by British MI5, they must use their extraordinary talents to stop a menace that threatens the British empire.  Without their help, the sun might set on the British Empire.
Combine the elements of Victorian/Edwardian style, pulp action heroes, spy novels, and a little steampunk and that is the the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  The shared universe idea has been around for many years, but Alan Moore has taken it in a interesting direction.  In the comic book, Moore fills his world with characters of 19th/early 20th century literature, including Fu Manchu, Professor James Moriarty, and Inspector Dupin (go read Edgar Allen Poe).  And yes, even Shelock Holmes makes an appearance.

An interesting premise posing as a futuristic period piece.  I bought it because it features the indomitable Sean Connery.

Great concept for a comic book, however never had a chance as a movie.

Where do I start? The story (no plot) had no chance from the start. The graphics were substandard. The dialog was stilted. The fighting was poorly choreographed. The music was forgettable. However the hokey costumes were a quite amusing. I always thought Sean Connery could make any movie work until now.

1477743,3,B00005JM5B,"It's a shame this movie is so boring because while you're watching it, you feel like it shouldn't be.  For starters, this movie is really neat to look at.  The director Stephen Norrington is a great visual stylist.  The action sequences--on a purely visual level--are exciting and dynamic.

So what went wrong?  First off, I would say the lead performance by Sean Connery is a definite liability.  It is the very definition of a phoned in performance.  He looks bored.  For example, in his introductory action sequence, pretty much all of his friends in Africa get killed but he just goes on making quips like it's no big deal.  Beyond Connery, Peta Wilson is the only actor who seems to be having any fun.

The other big problem is that the script is so lame-brained.  Like I said, the action sequences are visually exciting, but because the stakes are never very clear going into them, they end up feeling like a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.  For example, in their first encounter with The Phantom in the library at Dorian's house, they fight with the Phantom's henchmen and he escapes.  But then later we learn that [SPOILER ALERT] M is the Phantom and that M is trying to steal their abilities.  So why the hell was the Phantom trying to kill them in the library?!  It's a neat looking action scene, but ultimately pointless.  Similarly, the mid-point action sequence in the Venice canals is wonderful to look at, but the physics of it make absolutely no sense.  Apparently, the buildings are falling like dominoes and if they destroy a building in the middle of the city, they can stop the chain of destruction, but based on the level of destruction onscreen, you get the sense that almost the entire city is destroyed by the end of it.  Then when Sean Connery confronts the villain afterwards, he says, ""Venice still stands.""  No it doesn't!  Finally, the last action sequence has no narrative structure at all.  We have no idea what they're planning to accomplish or how, they just go into the enemy base and violence erupts.  Then the place blows up thanks to the Invisible Man who secret placed bombs all over the complex.  Great, so why did the other league members even need to go in there with him?

Lastly--and this is a big problem with movies about superhero ""teams""--there are too many characters vying for the writers' attention for any one character to be adequately developed.  Not that this movie doesn't give a valiant effort--there are several scenes dedicated to generating chemistry between the various characters in the league, but they feel stale because the characters pretty much only communicate in quips and cliches.  Furthermore, the interplay between the league members never pays off.  It doesn't nothing to raise the stakes as the movie goes on.  Whatever relationships were established get tossed out the window by the end, which, as I mentioned, is just a lot of pointless, confusing action.

Bottom line, I loved this movie's visuals enough to overlook the boring, cliche script and cheesy dialogue.  Watch it for the expertly filmed action sequences and nifty atmosphere.  Just prepare to be emotionally detached from whatever's going on.",1501804800,3,3189,4.839186691312385

1477752,5,B00005JM5B,"THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN [2003 / 2007] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] An Exciting Special-Effects All Action Extravaganza!

Steve Norrington's film, based on the graphic novels of Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill, brings together several literary characters from the Victorian era to prevent The Fantom threat to launch global Armageddon. It is 1899 the legendary Hunter/Adventurer Allan Quatermain [Sean Connery] is summoned from Africa by the British Government to head a team of men with extraordinary abilities. The team includes Dr. Henry Jekyll/Edward Hyde [Jason Flemyng], Dorian Gray [Stuart Townsend], Captain Nemo [Naseeruddin Shah], vampire Mina Harker [Peta Wilson], Tom Sawyer [Shane West] and invisible man Rodney Skinner [Tony Curran] to form The League. Their assignment is to track down the infamous The Fantom, but the catch is that they only have 9 hours before he plans to sabotage the peace conference in Vienna. Now, they must join forces to save the world!

FILM FACT: Principal photography took place in Hungary, Malta, and the Czech Republic. Sean Connery was paid $17 million Dollars for his role, which left the filmmakers little money to attract other big-name stars for the ensemble cast. The production ran into trouble when a special effects set did not pan out as intended, forcing the filmmakers to have to quickly look for another effects shop. It was intended to spawn a film franchise based on further titles in the original comic book series but there was little enthusiasm for a sequel. The film marked Sean Connery's last on-screen film appearance before his retirement.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN [2003] film finds a secret group of super-powered characters from Victorian literature who brought together in saving the world under the banner of Rule Britannia. THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN is certainly has a pitch that grabs your attention, and throttles it into submission, at least via the screenplay by James Dale Robinson. The premise scores points for ingenuity, where in a parallel universe, 19th century Britain harbours a shadowy group of superheroes torn from the pages of Victorian literature.

THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN film gives us wacky ideas that do not get any wackier than the one behind the scenario of THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN. Originally from a graphic novel co-written by Alan Moore, where we get a Victorian counter-factual adventure, or make that counter-fictional adventure that is set in 1899; and here we have an evil kingpin called Professor James Moriarty or M [The Fantom] that stars Richard Roxburgh and is stirring up trouble, so a sort of A-Team of super good-guys are assembled to muster up and to defeat him.

Executive producer Sean Connery plays Allan Quatermain, and there is Mina Harker from Bram Stoker's Dracula, Jules Verne's Captain Nemo, Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Henry Jekyll/Edward Hyde, Mark Twain's grown-up Tom Sawyer, Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray and Rodney Skinner, a new ""serialized"" character from H.G. Wells's novel The Invisible Man where the original presumably being the only one not yet quite out of copyright. Vampiress Mina Harker is allowed to swoop around biting people, though apparently without turning them into vampires too; Edward Hyde is a bizarrely bulbous and non-scary Hulk, to distinguish him from the essentially similar Dorian Gray who is given the extra superpower of indestructibility.

Positive elements: Each of the flawed personalities in this so-called THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN film needs some kind of personal redemption, where they mostly find it through teamwork and self-sacrifice. Captain Nemo refers to his pirate days and high-seas larceny as ""old wrongs."" Allan Quatermain confesses to vanity, pride and a history of costly mistakes, and saving his life at a very personal risk. To save the submarine and its crew, Dr. Henry Jekyll willingly enters what could be a watery grave. Bad guys' greed and lust for power ends in their destruction, both at personal and corporate levels. At a time before civil rights and racial equality, Allan Quatermain makes it a point to say of his dangerous lifestyle, ""I've lost friends-white men and black."" Dr. Henry Jekyll's internal struggle demonstrates the virtue of and need for self-control and when he realises that his transformation serum has been stolen by the enemy, he will do whatever it takes to keep society from reaping the whirlwind, and comments ""I will not let my evil infect the world.""

Spiritual content: An African witch doctor performs a ritual over a grave, and it is implied that the person will be resurrected. Captain Nemo kneels before a statue of Kali, the Indian god of death, where Mina asks if it's wise to go into battle with a man who ""worships death."" Allan Quatermain says that a witch doctor blessed him once and told him that Africa would never let him die.

Sexual content: The smouldering sensuality inherent to vampire lore surrounds Mina Harker and her identity is first revealed when she turns on an attacker and feasts on his neck, wiping blood from her mouth and licking her lips in ecstasy. In spite of witnessing this display, the men in the group vie for her affection. Dorian Gray has a sexual history with Mina Harker and then they kiss before eventually squaring off in a battle of immortals. Their vicious engagement is set in a bedroom, which leads to some very modern innuendo. The Invisible Man Rodney Skinner touches Mina Harker inappropriately and jokes about frostbitten body parts and the fact that he is naked.

Violent content: The action violence is so incessant that it's numbing. It's impossible to detail all of it. Machine-gunfire, explosions, knife fights, fist fights, sword fights and more. Men are stabbed or shot at close range, some have their necks snapped and one hero takes a dagger in the back. Allan Quatermain impales a man on a mounted rhino's horn and it goes in his back and comes out of his chest. When Dorian Gray is riddled with bullets, his wounds heal automatically, but other victims aren't so lucky. The bodies really pile up, especially where a man is engulfed by a blowtorch, Edward Hyde tosses men around like rag dolls, and is contorted painfully as he's transformed back to Dr. Henry Jekyll. A policeman is run down by a tank. A man holding a knife to Mina Harker's throat has the tables turned on him when she goes for his throat, killing him and sucking his blood. The City of Venice endures widespread destruction and a man is quickly reduced to an emaciated skeleton. Then we have a duel between Dorian Gray and Mina Harker where each are stabbing each other with swords. When a villain gulps down Dr. Henry Jekyll's formula, he turns into an ber over the top Edward Hyde who creates a swath of destruction, to the point of trying to stab people with a giant icicle before being crushed to death. All in all this part of the film you will experience an amazing battle of gargantuan proportions, which really shows off the special effects really well as well having all your speakers get a good workout to great effect.

I really enjoyed most of the film, especially Sean Connery's introduction in Kenya. Also superb is Naseeruddin Shah wisely underplays his role as Captain Nemo, although it's somewhat disconcerting to see an otherwise reserved character occasionally break into over the top moves. Jason Flemyng shines as both Dr. Henry Jekyll and Edward Hyde and the latter's make-up worked better than I thought. Stuart Townsend is appropriately the snide and cruel Dorian Gray, while Tony Curran tries his best to be a totally belligerent rogue called Rodney Skinner, and one character I did not think worked that well at all, who I thought was a totally atrocious actor who had a really stupid London accent that I thought was totally false and as I far as I am concerned I felt Tony Curran could not act his way out of a paper bag.

Yet for some of its flaws, the comic book fan in me couldn't help but be thrilled to finally see THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN film brought to life. The film boasts handsome production values and impressive special effects, and I was relieved that it was treated seriously, with a slight tongue in cheek scenario. I also understood that Tom Sawyer was supposed to be a surrogate son for Allan Quatermain but they have presumably only known each other for three days and that hardly gives them enough time to develop such a cherished bond? THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN film was for my money not at all a total disaster as a lot of critics lambasted it when released in the cinema and to some it may not be extraordinary, but as far as I am concerned it is what I really hoped it would be and much more, which was a very entertaining Victorian super-hero comic book film that I have loved ever since I saw it in the cinema. Also on the bright side, the extraordinary film has a lot of potential and originality, with familiar legends placed together in an interesting situation. The rich, imaginative fantasy that the idea this film represents is ambitious and intriguing. It is very entertaining and only 90% of the characters deserves a second look, which is of course an extraordinary quality for any action film, that I know has a great fan following and I am one of them, so well done to all who was involved with this film. Of course at the end of the film it sort of gives a hint that there might be a chance of a sequel and that Allan Quatermain would rise from his grave and set out to do battle with more evil empires out there with The League, but I suppose it was such a massive box office failure, the executives decided too much money had been spent on this particular film and felt they could not risk another failure, oh well we can all dream cant we.

Blu-ray Video Quality  20th Century Fox brings us this film in a brilliant 1080p encoded colourful image, especially with an equally impressive 2:35:1 aspect ratio. The image throughout the film is usually quite solid, but unfortunately very inconsistent picture quality. Especially close-up and daylight shots offer a good sharpness value. Usually quite good contrast ratio which falls only in some scenes. Despite many gloomy filming images, give us a usually quite natural colour reproduction throughout the film. So all in all a good effort all round. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  20th Century Fox brings us this film with just a 5.1 DTS-HT Master Audio experience. But for some unknown reason with the Title it is very loud, but overall the sound throughout the film is a very clear. In general, the sound design is characterized by a generally very aggressive audio mixture, which makes practically all channels available and also gives all of your speakers a good workout. In addition to a substantial portion of bass which is virtually in every action sequence throughout the film and uses the subwoofer best of all and there are countless brilliant surround sound effects that contribute to a partly almost brutal surround feeling. In the many film shooting experiences and other fighting sound effects, as well as the variety of really different sound mix on offer, are well suited to this film and I found it a very enjoyable experience. The motto here was probably simple: The louder, the better and I agree with that mantra! There is nothing to complain with the dialogue, and definitely remain consistently and very well understandable and have been all well balanced with the rest of the material throughout the film, so once again a good effort all round.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

First Audio Commentary by Producers Don Murphy and Trevor Albert, and Actors Shane West, Jason Flemyng and Tony Curran: First up to introduce themselves is Don Murphy who informs us that he is the producer of the film and the second film he has ever been involved, as the first one was From Hell. Next up to introduce themselves is Jason Flemyng who also informs us that Tony Curran is sitting next to him viewing the DVD of the film. Next up to introduce themselves is Trevor Albert and of course informs us that he was the other producer of the film, and also praises the composer Trevor Jones for his excellent sterling work towards the music score throughout the film. They inform us that one of the scenes at the start of the film had to be cancelled for two weeks because of a high tide that flooded the film studio. When we see the first shot of Kenya in Africa, we are informed it was actually filmed in Prague and the Mount Kilimanjaro was actually a matte painting. When we first see the London scenes, again this was filmed in Prague and 90% of the street scenes were computer generated CGI imagery. When Sean Connery is inside the main building and about to meet M [aka Moriarty] the evil protagonist, well of course M is homage to the James Bond films. At this point, finally, Shane West introduces himself and points out his first appearance in the film in the soaking rain as the super charged car passes in front of him. When we enter the scene in the massive library, we are informed that it was originally an old Sugar Beet Factory in Prague that was in operation in the Second World War and when you see Dorian Gray in the chair, they point out that behind him hidden away was a pile of rotting sugar beet and someone had to keep throwing stuff on it to take away the rotting smell. When Jason Flemyng speaks about his appearance as Edward Hyde, he tells us that he wore a very heavy bulky body suit and make-up took up to eight hours. When you see the actors walking around the Nautilus submarine, we are informed that took several months to build the interiors, but were all destroyed during the worst flooding in the Czech Republic had in 300 years and the Nautilus interior had been built on an old shipyard site and again the whole place got flooded up to the ceiling and had to stop filming for almost three weeks and of course the Nautilus interior and to be rebuilt from scratch. When we are in Venice, they wanted to actually film in the City of Venice, but because as you will have seen all the building are destroyed by the bombs, and of course the authorities in Venice gave a big NO, so in the end they had to build the sets in Prague and some were miniatures, but some of the buildings were full size. When we get near to the end of the film where Sean Connery has been killed and he shipped back to Kenya to where he is buried, well that scene was actually filmed in Calabasas in California and the commentators mulled over whether Sean Connery would be brought back to life or would there be a follow up film, but of course we now know this never happened. So as the credits roll up the screen, all commentators ask us if we enjoyed the film and all of their comments. Well most of the commentators were very interesting, but in certain parts of the film we get a lot of silence and also a lot of the comments were of stuff that was pretty boring, but despite this, I did enjoy most of this particular audio commentary, but unfortunately I had to crank the sound up quite a few notches to hear the audio commentary properly.

Second Audio Commentary by Costume Designer Jacqueline West, Visual Effects Supervisor John E. Sullivan, Make-Up Effects Supervisor Steve Johnson and Miniatures Creator Matthew Gratzner: First up to introduce themselves is Matthew Gratzner who informs us that he was the Visual Effects Supervisor at New Deal Studios that is a 21st Century Creative Studio, that are based in Los Angeles, California and was contracted for some of the miniature effects shots in the film. Next up to introduce themselves is John Sullivan who was the final Supervision Visual Effects Supervisor for this film and was brought in seven weeks into this film to get it completed in the time frame available. Next up to introduce themselves is Jacqueline West who was of course the Costume Designer for the film, and was very surprised to be called in for this comic book film and was also at the same time intrigued, especially with history of the past colliding with the future seemed very interesting to Jacqueline. We find out that with the computer generated images throughout the film were done by the combined efforts of DIGISCOPE and PIXEL MAGIC, and the Britannica Club was a miniature that was a composite image for the film. When Jacqueline West started doing the designing of the clothing, especially for the bullet proof armour, which was copied from designs at the Imperial War Museum, which was the main one where Jacqueline visited in London and the director Stephen Norrington rejected the design at first, because he felt the armour was too heavy, but later on was adjusted to suit the actors wearing it. As to The Fantom clothing design, Jacqueline based it on the UK Black Shirt uniform worn by the men under the leadership of Sir Oswald Ernald Mosley, 6th Baronet was an English politician who rose to fame in the 1920s as a Member of Parliament and fell to disgrace in 1930s as leader of the British Union of Fascists and again Jacqueline wanted The Fantom clothing design to be a combination of Liberace and Rasputin. Jacqueline also goes into great detail about the clothing designs for Sean Connery, and because of being a great admirer of this Scottish actor, designed his clothing based on a book entitled White Hunter that was about the legendary Scottish ""White Hunter"" John Alexander Hunter (1887  1963) who use to take Victorian Royalty on Safari expeditions and gave the book to Sean which he really appreciated receiving it. By the way, when you see the leather wrist strap on Seans wrist, this was to cover up a tattoo for some unknown reason that was never explained. But when it came to the clothing design of Captain Nemo [Naseeruddin Shah], Jacqueline is supposed to of based the clothing design on a famous Prince in India, who was supposed to be a revolutionary at the time and so wanted Captain nemo to look very regal looking, and the metal parts on the clothing was hand tooled silver, and the complete outfit was hand made in India. Because of at the time of filming, the United Kingdom was suffering from the BSE [Bovine spongiform encephalopathy] scandal and the leather coat for the Invisible Man had to be imported from Italy, as no leather was available at the time in the UK, and the design of the coat was based on a Victorian overcoat. With Dorian Gray clothing, Jacqueline wanted to reflect his character with Grey Pin Stripped suit that the Gangsters would wear in 1920s America. With the actress Peta Wilson, Jacqueline wanted to reflect a true Victorian woman of great style and the director thought the design was perfect. Next to introduce themselves was Steve Johnson who designed all the prosthetics for the film and of course it is the first time in the film we get to Steves work when we see Edward Hyde appear. When you see the super charged car shoot out of the submarine Nautilus, and when you see it being driven around Venice, this was a radio controlled model with small models of the actors in it, but of course when you see a close up of the car, you see that actual actors in the car. When you get to hear certain commentators talk most of the time in very technical jargon and how certain scenes were done and I found this sort of information pretty boring, as I did not find this mumbo jumbo information rather numb minding and I do not why these people get so excited by what they describe, as to be honest it would only interest people who are involved in this side of the film industry who find this in-depth information interesting. When near the end of the film with the Kenya setting, where Allan Quatermain is buried, it is again mentioned they thought there might be a follow up film, but again we know this never came to fruition, which is a shame, even though it was the last film that Sean Connery appeared in. As the credits roll up the screen, all the commentators comments on all the work they did over a 16 week period and all became close friends, then sadly all had to part company and go their separate ways forever, which they were all sad about, as they worked extremely hard, but also had a lots of fun times as well. All of them felt the whole film really worked and they also felt there were not one duff special effects, as all turned out really well, and says a lot about this particular film, especially as they all had to work under a very tight budget constraints, and they felt everyone did an exceptional professional job, and they feel the work speaks for itself, which I totally agree 100%. But again one slight criticism, unfortunately I had to crank the sound up quite a few notches to hear the audio commentary properly.

Special Feature: Trivia Track: With this new extra feature to this Blu-ray disc, and with this feature activated, Trivia information will appear at various points during the film. You get to view the wording information in a border area that over times appears in different positions on the screen. And another bonus is that you get to watch the film in 5.1 DTS-HT Master Audio. What you get to read is totally fascinating and really gives you so much insight into the background into making of the film. So please give it a try and see if you find the information read of some interst.

Special Feature: Search Content: With this personalised Search Content, the film can be searched for certain keywords from A to Z. The keywords are arranged in alphabetical order and always point to the respective time in the film, which can then be precisely controlled.

Special Feature: Personal Scene Selection: In addition, there is the personal scene selection to bookmark up to 12 scenes that you would like you to like to refer to later on and especially where the respective favourite scenes can be compiled, stored and then played. So what you have to do is press the ENTER button on your remote control to select a scene. Then you see a selection of numbers which you have to press for that particular scene you want to view.

Special Feature: LXG: Shooting Gallery: With this interactive simple game that is not really very exciting and offers only the possibility to shoot the bad guys in the library scene and if one meets a League member, however you gain points. It is slightly awkward and wholly lacking in any entertainment value or purpose, but it is sort of fun while it lasts for about a minute in total.

Trailer: The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Trailer [2003] [1080p] [2.35:1] [1:05] This is the Original Theatrical trailer for the film THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN. It is a brilliant presentation, especially when the announcer informs us, There Powers Are Legendary; Their Origins Are Unknown; There Methods Are Extreme; This Summer The Bad Will Fight For Good and Prepare For The Extraordinary This Summer.

Finally, with THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN film, we have a bunch of quasi-heroic Victorian literary characters that we have been thrust into a very busy, very violent action film and forced to adopt all the postmodern traits needed for that context. I cannot help but wonder what Oscar Wilde, H. Rider Haggard, H.G. Wells, Mark Twain, Bram Stoker, Jules Verne and Robert Louis Stevenson would think of someone turning their beloved creations into reality for this film and of course it did not spawn a sequel, which is understandable. THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN was not the total disaster as most critics proclaimed that the film was, more so compared to the utter embarrassing disastrous films such as Scooby Doo, Wild Wild West, The Avengers and especially Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, which must be among that summer's worst atrocious entry on the cinema circuit. Whereas the film THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN may not be extraordinary that it was hoped to be, whereas in my opinion it was a very entertaining Victorian super-hero film of style and substance and well worth viewing and is definitely a very tongue in cheek in its approach to the showcasing the Super Hero in this extravaganza rollercoaster film, who definitely gets a stamp of approval from me. I also feel this is a definite companion to this Blu-ray disc, because of the VAN HELSING [2004] film which includes a character you see in THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN [2003] film, and of course includes the Australian actor Richard Roxburgh, who played Count Dracula in the 2004 film and of course plays two evil characters in both of these films with great dedication. Highly Recommended!

1478569,2,B00005JM5B,"On paper this film seems to have it all. A great idea, a huge budget for F/X and a solid cast, but for some reason it just doesn't come together? I vaguely remembered seeing this film in theaters back in the day, but the only part I could remember were the early scenes with Sean Connery as Alan Quartermain, and some flashes here or there. After watching ""Dr. No"" the other day, I found myself on a Connery kick and watched ""The Untouchables"" and wanted to follow up with ""LXG"".

In 1899 a series of attacks against sovereign nations by a group of well armed terrorists and led by the masked Fantom, has led Europe to the brink of war. Using advanced weaponry such as machine guns and armored vehicles, the Fantom and his men are about to begin a World War. The British Empire calls upon some of the times' greatest adventurers; Quartermain, Tom Sawyer, The Invisible Man, Dorian Gray, Mina Harker and Captain Nemo to stop the Fantom and bring peace to Europe.

Again, I love the idea this film is based on, and the cast of characters should be a lot of fun to watch....but the movie is just so flat. There are action scenes galore, but nothing feels exciting. The F/X, while CGI heavy, are pretty good, especially the scenes involving The Invisible Man (Dr. Jeckyll on the other hand...). I'm reminded quite a bit of the Hugh Jackman film ""Van Helsing"", in that you have a great idea on paper, and big budget a great leading man, but for some reason, just nothing clicks.

""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" isn't a horrible film, it's not even a bad film, it's just so damn dull.",1458777600,,1583,4.489583333333333

1479048,3,B00005JM5B,"Finally screened the Blu-ray of this last night, had seen sections of this on Cable
and missed it in the theaters at the time, hearing it was a bit weak.  Well, I enjoyed
the heck out of this film but it is indeed a bit cheezy and super-reliant on CGI
and all that, and the acting is often corny and/or somewhat bad, often somewhat
too smart-alecky in the snappy (silly) in-joke/bit-too-self-aware dialogue, although of course
Connery delivers a fine performance as Quatermain and Captain Nemo is a great
spin on the classic character, who was always one of my favorites in literature
from a very young age.

Overall the child in me that grew up watching Island
at the Top of the World, Chiller Theater and Creature Features, Sinbad movies, and all that was held nearly enraptured
by that element of this movie.  Even though it departs a lot (as always) from Moore's
graphic novels I think if you keep this viewpoint in mind watching it you'll enjoy League.
I cannot say it's a 5 star classic but it is a fun, enjoyable throwback action-SF-adventure
with a twist.  It also really does sparkle in Blu-ray and sounds and looks fabulous
at all times.  I'm glad I saved viewing this for the big home TV and Blu-ray for sure.
Apparently Connery turned down Lord of the Rings and later picked up League,
and I think it was a wise decision: this film and role suits him a lot better than
possibly anything in the Rings Cycle would have.  Just my gut instinct
and I've been a Connery fan since Day One.  I still haven't sat through Zardoz
(which I've heard is still pretty way out to this day, if not a successful SF film)
but otherwise I'm usually up for almost anything Connery does.

League is great fun but don't expect anything super intellectual, although it's
sure as heck smarter than a lot of the junk coming out today!  I'm sure owing
quite a lot to Moore (and his artists') work, as the source, this movie still
retains some integrity like Jackson's Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films,
even given gross changes from the sources (that many fans may still
hate but that's the way it is with these films based on favorite novels/graphic
novels, usually).  This is by no means a terrible film, the wide-eyed 10 year
old in you will really enjoy it, if you're into fantasy/SF/steampunk etc. at all.",1427932800,,2296,4.550970873786408

It is well acted, well written and has good cinematography.  It is typical cartoon brought to life fare.  It doesn't take itself too seriously and Sean Connery (in one of his last film appearances) lends the film credibility few others have.  The premise is that several famous characters (including Dr. Jekyll, the invisible man, Captain Nemo, Tom Sawyer, and others) are brought together as a super force to combat evil at the turn of the 20th century.  It is a nice idea to see these characters in a way which diverges from the standard lore.

On to the movie itself, there are several mixed reviews about the movie but personally I like it it. It is about a group of unlikely characters coming together to serve of some justice ( ya I know sounds like every other movie out there). It has a vampire, a sharp shooter, Jackle and Hyde, Invisible Guy, and a few other characters. The movie has some great sub-stories in it that explains how the came to be who they are today and they kick some butt. Great action film!",1403136000,,607,4.196581196581197

For the sake of man kind they have to figure out how to work along side each other. They have to stop a madman intent on launching global armageddon.  It does have some laughs in it.

Sean Connery as Alan Quatermain leads a cast of superheroes from literary novels that unite to stop a criminal mastermind and madman and terrorist named the phantom from destroying the world and achieving world domination. The film has fantastic sets and beautiful dark locations and fantastic technologies and super technologies like the nautilus submarine and the automobile that were inventions that were far ahead of it`s time for the late 1800`s. The character of Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde played by Jason flemyng is the most interesting and fun to watch character in the film. Dr. Jekyll transforms into Mr. Hyde by drinking some kind of super-human formula or magical Potion. Mr. Hyde is Dr. Jekyll`s powerful alter ego and towering, Huge Hulking persona that he talks to looking at mirrors when he is Dr. Jekyll and is a powerful muscular brute with a great sense of humor and very commanding powerful presence.",1401062400,3,1111,5.143646408839779

bad guys. You will not regret buying this movie !",1400457600,,324,4.295081967213115

But this movie is so amazing. It takes place in the best era, the Victorian era, and joins together Victorian superheroes taken from famous literature (Alan Quartermain, The Invisible Man, Captain Nemo, Tom Sawyer, Wilhelmina Harker, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and Dorian Grey, even M from Sherlock Holmes and Ishmael from Moby Dick) led by a perfect cast. Each and every one of these actors are amazing. The concept is so unique and EXTRAORDINARY, and its so full of wit and action, I honestly don't care if the plot isn't perfect like some say. I have written fan stories of this movie and I was seriously obsessed from the moment I first saw it. The biggest let down, however, is that they never made a sequel!

However, throw them all together with a few other charming and capable characters and you have the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (and one woman).

Allan Quartermain assembles this group and asks the aid of Captain Nemo for the use of Nautilus to stop the deliberate sinking by explosion of Venice.

All around, this is a good movie with mostly great special effects.  I personally like the ability of Jekyll to control Hyde to a point.  Very intriguing, this movie.",1399248000,2,628,4.933333333333334

1479623,3,B00005JM5B,"The best way I can describe TLOEG is as a tonal counterpart to the film Van Helsing. It is a fun movie but flawed. If you can suspend disbelief you can enjoy this but there are times when you have to shut off your brain and your common sense to do so. The visuals are at times ridiculous - the Nautilus surfaces for the first time in what is presumably the Thames and it is taller than a building - which doesn't seem possible, or practical and is not at all exciting - not to mention the design of the ship itself is - well it isn't the Disney version, which is fine - but it is just overly ornate, impactical and not visually appealing - the interiors are much too spacious for a submarine - really the whole thing is a let down. Mr. Hyde is another example - I understand he is supposed to be an 1800's version of the Hulk in terms of size and strength in this films mythos but he just seems to big - like the effects guys created him in the wrong scale - that and visually ridiculous - I get that they were making him a gorrila man so they could combine Murders in the Rue Morgue mythology together with Dr J and Mr H but he didn't need to be a giant - and the musulature looks idiotic. The pace of this film feels rushed at times. We aren't given a proper introduction to these characters prior to their recruitment into the league - which may have helped - and Connery, much missed and much loved post retirement, just feels too old for what they have him doing here. Fight scenes which are clearly stunt doubles etc. The film as a whole is enjoyable - don't let the shortcomings stop you - it's just that you have to be willing to suspend disbelief and common sense to enjoy - back to the nauilus... they have it moving thru the canals of venice - a ship (surfaced) as tall as a building moving thru the canals of venice? you wonder if people were really paying attention when they made this as it could have been more than it was - still overall entertaining, stupid fun...2 stars plus one for Mr. Connery's parting shot.",1393027200,3,2029,4.1918158567774935

1479674,4,B00005JM5B,"This was a movie that I fell in love with when it was first released to theaters. It's one of those movies that could definitely be called a guilty pleasure. It's loosly based on a graphic novel of the same name written by Alan Moore, who is also well known to have written V For Vendetta,  The Watchmen, and From Hell, all of which were adapted into films. I really like the premise of the story by having these literary characters such as Alan Quatermain, Mina Harker, Captain Nemo, Dorian Gray, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, The Invisible Man, Dr. Moriarty and Tom Sawyer, in a setting different from what they are known to lived in and having most of them join forces was a treat. We see one of Sean Connery's lesser roles here as Quatermain, but he adds his little bit of flair that only he can do.
I recommend this if you're in the mood for a good entertaining popcorn flick!",1387756800,,872,4.382716049382716

The movie was so good I wanted to see what had been cut out of it. There are a couple places where things get confusing and I figured the DVD would clear those places up.

There is NOTHING different on DVD except a 15 second intro type thing that adds absolutely nothing to the movie. Of course there's no commercials so there's that...

It has good special effects, a good story line, a bit violent in places. It is interesting how they mix various characters (who have their own stories apart from this movie) together - Moriarty, Dorian Grey, the Invisible Man, the Vampire, Captain Nemo. And of course... Sean Connery.

This movie will not make the list for Top 100 Movies of the Century but it's worth the time as long as you don't pay a fortune for it.",1386201600,,885,4.351515151515152

1479781,4,B00005JM5B,"Very few times do you find that the movie is better than the source material.  I'd say, like in the case of Jeff Linday's Dexter, the motion picture is way better than the novels.

Do NOT let your opinion of the graphic novels influence you here at all.  If you are not a crazy fanboy who praises the boring, listless, unremarkable graphic novels nonsensically, then you will appreciate this film.  Where the books are slow and contain characters who do literally nothing yet are deemed heroes, this movie puts them all into the action and re-brands the foolishly lame characters of the books with seriously cool powers and attitudes.  Can anyone say ""Mina Harker?""

First of all, the idea is a great one.  This movie takes the idea and does the right thing: creates an action-packed story of some truly weird and scary heroes going against a powerful enemy on mankind's behalf.  It throws in Tom Sawyer as a secret agent.  It turns Alan Quartermain from a bumbling old fool into a tough-as-nails adventurer past his prime.

The effects are excellent.  The acting is superb.  The characters are all very interesting, unique, and unsettling.

If you enjoy the idea of monsters and special humans fighting for mankind, this film delivers.

The whole plot was a bit confusing at first, but it eventually made sense. If you are an active movie watcher, then this film will keep you guessing. The message, I think, is about trusting others and putting differences aside to get the job done.

1479891,3,B00005JM5B,"The league of Extraordinary Gentlemen(Released July/03) stars,among others,Sean Connery as Allan Quartermain,Naseeruddin Shah as Captain Nemo,Peta Wilson as Mina Harker,Tony Curran as Rodney Skinner,Stuart Townsend as Dorian Gray and Shane West as Tom Sawyer. This film,on paper,had SO much potential to it one couldn't help to think it would be a no brainer of a hit. But somehow,somewhere along the line,the film makers totally screwed this one up.
The plot finds us in 1899 just before the turn of the century. The world has an arch villain in the form of""The Phantom"",who is seemingly trying to start a World War with technology that is quite far in advance of that period of time. A rep from Her Majesty's government goes to Kenya to enlist the help of Allan Quartermain(Connery).He is at first reluctant but when assassins come to his lodge and try to kill him,it proves to be the deciding factor to join the fight. A man known as ""M""(a throw back hint to the James Bond movies)is the one in charge of recruiting many well known ""celebrities"" such as Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde,Capt. Nemo,Tom Sawyer,The Invisible Man,Dorian Gray and an old assistant to Van Helsing who is now a vampiress. They have a brief run in with the Phantom and they follow his trail to Venice,where he is going to blow up the entire city. They have four days in which to travel and Nemo's infamous Nautilus sub will get them there with time to spare. They arrive just as street celebrations are underway. The Phantom starts blowing the city up,but a well placed missile stops the calamity from spreading. Soon after,while heading east on the Phantom's trail,they find bombs have been planted aboard the sub and Gray has been working with M,who have been in cahoots with the Phantom. The bombs go off and cripple the sub,but only temporarily,and soon they are on their way to Mongolia,where the Phantom has a hidden factory which produces his ultra modern equipment. They are also at work on replicating Dr. Jekyll's formula and making vampires. Nemo and the group arrive in time and stop the Phantom's menace in its tracks. However Quartermain has been killed and is taken back to his beloved Africa. The film ends as a medicine man is trying to,and apparently succeeding in,resurrecting Quartermain.
The last scene would normally have suggested a sequel but this film,while doing good business at the box office(due in great part to Connery's drawing power),was a critical failure,and with good reason. There just is no depth to the characters on the screen at all and as a result,no empathy. What should have been funny moments such as the Invisible Man's unannounced appearances,came across as just moronic frat humour. There were so many dead scenes such as when the sub is on its way to Venice and Quartermain teaches Sawyer how to shoot his gun....BORING.There were also some CGI slip ups as when Mr. Hyde saves the sub by opening a vent underwater,but we see no air bubbles coming from him,and his mouth is wide open! And how about the name of their nemesis,the Phantom?Not only was he as about as scary as Buttermilk,but his name was as cliched as anything you can think of.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include deleted scenes and commentary.
All in all a terrible disappointment,with a good cast and a potentially boffo storyline. But it wasn't to be,as this film is as thin as the strip it was shot on....35mm all the way! 2 1/2- maybe 3 stars....maybe.",1363996800,,3499,4.804311774461028

It's so much a movie to see again and again. Maybe loyalty/admiration/sentimental attitude for Sean Connery. Almost a decade changes us all.

October is a magnificent month, and in celebration of its annual visit, I've decided to review a few great flicks for the Halloween season. The titles that I've chosen to review are ""alternative"" Halloween movies... not the classics that generally spring to mind, but fun movies with elements of the supernatural. Just good, lighthearted stuff here... nothing gory or scary (at least not too much)!

One such movie is ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"". Oftentimes lambasted, I feel like this movie gets a bad rap. It's not supposed to be ""Gone with the Wind""; it's a comic book adaptation of a story with a bunch of unique characters. So what makes it a good choice for Halloween? It's got an awesome take on Jekyll/Hyde, the Invisible Man, Captain Nemo, a vampire, and a villain that will remind you of the Phantom of the Opera. Throw in Sean Connery as legendary explorer Alan Quartermain, and you've got the wackiest ensemble this side of South Park.

The characters in this film, you should already know as they all come from famous novels we have either read, heard about or at least saw the film version at the theatre. The characters of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Captain Nemo from 20,000 Leagues under the Sea, the never aging and evidently in this version immortal Dorian Grey along with Mina Harker, who hasn't quite survived her bout with Dracula, Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer, all grown up, and Alan Quartermain from King's Solomon's Mines, have all assembled to combat an evil mastermind set on world domination. If you blink, you'll miss another hero in the piece, Skinner, a nefarious thief who's pinched the scientist Griffin's formula (H.G. Wells) to help him in his thieving. Actually go ahead and blink because it won't matter due to his ""affliction"".

As our cast of characters are hurriedly cobbled together, there's little time for exploring the backgrounds that brought them here, but it's great to see them outside the well-worn pages of Haggard, Stevenson, Stoker, Twain, Wells and Wilde's novels. The dialogue is at time novelistic, but the film itself is based on a graphic novel.  It's fast paced, packed with action, twists and turns and spectacular special effects!

1480018,4,B00005JM5B,"I like movies that involve people with super abilities and supernatural talents.  This movie sort of hit the warm spot in my heart with good entertainment and action at the same time.  It is based on a comic book series but the storyline has been changed and it is based in the late 1800's.  The super heroes are based on the characters developed by H. G. Wells, Bram Stoker, Jules Verne and many more famous authors so you have a combination of super heroes and villains.  It sort of uses an alternate history where the German soldiers are involved in a series of raids on both British and German facilities.  Someone is trying to start a war between Germany and Britain.  Alan Quatermain (Sean Connery) is reluctantly recruited to help find out what is going on and stop a potential war.

A team of super powerful beings are recruited to investigate and solve the mystery.  That is where the real problems begin....

This is a high action movie with a lot of good stars and the story line is that the super heroes are supposed to stop the bad guy from conquering the world.  The special effects are pretty good and some of the actors did a very good job in their roles.  I don't want to ruin the movie for you by giving out too many spoilers so you will just have to watch it and enjoy it.

For instance Mr. Hyde has been transformed into ""The Hulk."" There is a list of fine actors which in itself makes the movie a worth while view. Even the minor characters are names from old novels.

The fighting and action lack much of that special CG effect of bullet dodging and gravity defying martial art moves.

The movie is fairly plain and straight forward with a twist, but not complex . Certainly a worth while view if you either like Marvel/DC comic heroes or are just a fan of 19th century literature.

The writer takes various unrelated classic literary figures (most of which have nothing in common even thematically), masticates, then expels them onto the silver screen with a result you would expect...you'll derive more pleasure watching what you just ate for lunch spin down the toilet after taking a laxative than watching this film...

And no I didn't read the dumb comic. I'm not 12. And that's always a dumb irrelevant argument. All films, ALL, must stand on their own, independent of the source material.

1480121,5,B00005JM5B,"Connery wasn't sure he understood the proposed script for this film when he first read it, but after passing on scripts he found incomprehensible, like ""The Matrix"" and ""Lord of the Rings,"" he still agreed to take part in this super-ambitious project. Thank goodness! It might have had a lesser budget if he'd rejected the script, and the acting certainly would have been diminished greatly.

All the stars do an excellent job but, to be totally honest, the special effects (a combination of blue screen, miniatures, some of the largest sets ever built, and in-camera mixing) often steal the show in a wonderful, breathtaking way.

This is a must-see movie, and that's coming from a guy who has not been overly impressed by most of the ""super hero"" films of recent years. The makeup is also incredible, particularly for the dual Dr. Jekyl & Mr. Hyde character. Nina Harker, the subdued and proper 19th century lady, transforms spectacularly into a vicious vampire leading a hoard of vampire bats. Connery, as Allen Quartermain of ""King Solomon's Mines,"" is cool and great without the need for transformation. Dorian Gray, played by an actor who looks a bit like Johnny Depp, displays some impressive changes as well. Tom Sawyer seems an odd choice for a film that includes Capt. Nemo, the Invisible Man and the other fictional hero/anti-heroes mentioned above, but he fits in well as the chosen successor to the elderly Quartermain.

Nemo's gigantic submarine, his elegant super car, the destruction of Venice and other eye-popping visuals aren't easily forgotten.

Two very good reasons for buying it.  Now, on another night, I might not have given it 5 stars, but it was raining, and I played the DVD.

Now, I've read the 1- and 2-star comments, but I haven't read the book(s?), so I had no preconceived notions about what was ""supposed"" to happen.  I treated this film like many of the people who had never read Lord of the Rings treated the movie.  They didn't know what had been changed or left out or added, and they loved the movie.

I really liked the film.  It was helped along by the blu-ray transfer and the extraordinary (pun intended) sound.  If you've got a great sound system, a quality blu-ray player, and an HD TV, this will always make a difference in the enjoyment.  Sean Connery was superb, as usual, and I enjoyed seeing all the other characters.  The movie had a lot of great qualities (sight and sound I've already mentioned):  a mission, betrayal, a lot of action, and Sean Connery.

I'm sure there are those around who can talk about plot and advancement of the characters, but I really liked the characters.

The Nautilus was one proud ship.  Now, I don't know who came up with the idea of the gigantic Hyde:  both Van Helsing and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen pictured him as such (and both made in 2003).  Before watching either film, I never thought of Hyde as an enormous Hulk.  So I don't know who to give credit for the mountainous Hyde.  I really approve of the presentation.

I even liked the ending.  I would like a sequel, but after this amount of time, and I guess because of poor sales, there won't be one.  My two cents (whatever happened to the ""cent"" key on keyboards? ).  :-)",1280016000,3,1802,4.390909090909091

I guess they were confident ahead of time that it was worth putting in 2 commentaries etc.  From what I read there were many other scenes filmed that were not used and at least some are included.  I hope they do a extended version one day.  If the dvd/bluray sales do well enough who knows?  I am a big Connery fan and even though this film did not thrill me when I first saw it in the theatre I enjoy it more now on DVD just taking it for what it is.  I will get the blu ray version after I get my big screen tv if this does not look as good as it does now on my 27inch Sony.  It is crystal clear and fits the bill overall.  Connery still makes you believe he is able to do the job even though at this date he was 73!  It helps of course that this is a fantasy film and not a modern day true to life drama.

1480163,2,B00005JM5B,"League of not-so-great gentlemen:
A review of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Okay, where do I begin?  Well, when the making of footage shows the director of film (which was based off a graphic novel with the intention of getting young people interested in reading the classics again) goes out of his way tell you 'The characters in this movie are from these huge, archaic books I never read so I found a writer that at least read some of them.'  That's the first warning sign that a film is in trouble.

 I think my biggest pet peeve, and ironically also my favourite part, was Dorian Gray.  It was not Dorian Gray of the novel, not authentically anyway.  This version of Dorian dies when he looks at the painting. This bothers me because so many people who have never read The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde now think that looking at the painting would kill Dorian.  I've heard of people argue with those who have read the book to insist they got it wrong, that stabbing the painting doesn't kill him, it's looking at it!  WRONG!  Dorian looked at the painting a lot, that was sort of the point.

  A big issue with this Dorian is M stole the painting from Dorian's Foyer.  Quartermain notices the spot where it had been.  If looking at it would kill him why did Dorian have it hanging in his foyer?  Did he cover his eyes every time he walked into his home?

  Now for the serious flaws of the time line.

Tom Sawyer's story takes place with him, at age twelve,  before the civil war.  That means it has be before 1865.  Tom Sawyear cannot be a teenager in 1899.

Mina Harker:  Mina Harker's story takes place in 1897.  So In two years she was made a vampire, widowed, dated Dorian, and became a Chemist?

Dorian Gray:  Dorian Gray becomes immortal in 1891. So In eight years he lectured at a university where Quartermain was a boy.  Less than eight years after college and he looks like that?  The boy didn't age well!

  Another thing about the film that didn't sit right for me is Dorian's life was in danger.  M had something that could kill him at any time, and Mina pretty much executed him for that.  But because he once broke up with her that's okay?  M might as well have had a gun to him the whole time but Mina was right to kill him?  Sure he acted cold but would it really have been better if he was sniveling and pleading?  That didn't make Dorian look that evil to me or Mina look that good.

  Under tight scrutiny League of Extraordinary Gentlemen would require a TARDIS for those characters to all meet at those points in their lives.  Just because they're all from the nineteenth century does not mean that their stories can mesh with a plausible storyline.  My gradfather was born in the 1920s.  That doesn't mean he and I could be teenagers together because I was born in 1981.

  This film can be fun as brain candy but under tight observation it makes little sense and it's blatantly obvious the director didn't read or respect the original novels the characters came from, which is a shame because the original purpose of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen's graphic novel was to try to get young people interested in reading the classics.",1262649600,,3174,4.458987783595114
1480164,5,B00005JM5B,"Sean Connery truly shines as an older Allan Quartermain. I've loved all of Haggard's characters for years, and I found no fault with his character.

I know some purists have a thing about vampires in the daylight, but let me remind you forgetful individuals: BRAM STOKER WROTE ABOUT VAMPIRES IN THE DAYLIGHT!!!! Jonathan Harker sees Count Dracula in braod daylight (well, it WAS London, maybe not so broad).

Anyone raised on Disney's 20,000 Leagues movie was probably a bit confused by the appearance of the Nautilus, but this design is probably far more in keeping with the time period than the Disney design.

I never was a big fan of Mr. Hyde, or of The Invisible Man, so I'll not comment on them, except that I found Hyde's characterization interesting.

I thought Dorian Gray was well done, if not perfect.

That leaves Moriarty. Doyle's madman would certainly have been capable of the plots of this man, but I believe that he would have been far more subtle, and I don't think he would have given Dorian's picture back. It would have been just TOO intriguing for him.

The only disappointment I had in the DVD was the lack of the ending that I saw in the theaters, where Quartermain's hand rises from his grave to grip the rifle. DOES ANYONE ELSE REMEMBER THAT???? Sometimes I think I'm going crazy.",1262563200,,1306,4.681222707423581

1480218,3,B00005JM5B,"LXG is a flashy stylized action comic book movie, that fails to create desire for a sequel due to bad acting and bad writing.  Sadly enough it's one of the worst comic adaptations, and it managed to cause Alan Moore to lose faith in Hollywood.  One of the greatest comic writers suffers a big embarassment in this film.  Lucky enough for him, his other adaptations, which he refuses to watch, are outstanding (V for Vendetta, Watchmen, From Hell).  I can watch this movie and be entertained, but I can't give it credit for much of anything.  It's fight scenes are definately watchable, but everything else received no critical attention.

The Good:  LXG is very slick and cool in terms of it's style.  The color palette and clothing are interesting, as is its sets and cinematography.  The fight scenes are thrilling, and the CG is very realistic.  I was glad to see a more realistic approach to the special effects, and not some goofy computer animated sigh-fest.  As for the good of this film, that gets me to watch it every now and then, this is it.

The Bad:  The wonderful cast is slaughtered with horrible witty lines scattered endlessly throughout the script.  No one wants to see quirks and quips, we want realistic relations.  These actors can't make the dialogue seem real at all, and it's horrible to watch.  If I watched this in another language it might be more entertaining.  I hate to see nearly every line a joke, and not a moment of seriousness within the film.  It should have been handed to better writers and a better director, and it would have been a beautiful film.  We now have proof, that ""Blade"" was begginner's luck.

I'm the type of viewer/reviewer who can sit down and watch the cheesy ones every now and then.  Some movies are almost unbearably campy, but they still manage to entertain.  If you can stay on the sunny side, then LXG might be worth your bucks.  If you are easily annoyed you might want to stay far away from the film.

We open with the dark cobbled streets of London in 1899 and a strange, never seen before, metal vehicle (we know to be a tank) is rolling through the streets and heading straight into the Bank of England, where a German scientist is kidnapped.

We move to Kenya, June 1899, where a man comes in search of the legendary hero Allan Quartermain.  Except Quatermain (Sean Connery) is now jaded by his experiences and until attacked he wants nothing to do with the problems of the empire - only then does he agree to return once more to save the world.

July 1899 Quatermain arrives in London and is introduced to ""M"" (Richard Roxburgh -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Van-Helsing-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0002KVUKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Van Helsing (Widescreen Edition)</a>)) who explains that the villain of the peace is a man known as the ""Fantom"", and that over the centuries there have been groups of chosen men with special attributes who were known as ""The League of Extra Ordinary Gentlemen"" or ""The League"".

This League will be Quatermain, Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), Rodney Skinner aka the Invisible Man (Tony Curran -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Underworld-Evolution-Widescreen-Special-Edition/dp/B000F6IOC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Underworld - Evolution (Widescreen Special Edition)</a>), Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), Dr Jekyll / Mr Hyde (Jason Flemyng -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Primeval-Vol-2-Series-3/dp/B002D1XKB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Primeval, Vol. 2 (Series 3)</a>) and Agent Tom Sawyer (Shane West).

This film was going to divide people into those that know the graphic novels and those that don't know them at all.  Since I don't know them I have nothing that I can complain about - I enjoyed them.

What I love are the references to the older books, such as Moby Dick, Around the World in 80 Days, etc.  There are also hints as to who the baddy is very early on in the film.  I also like the fact that the Mr Hyde character was not created by the use of CGI but the old fashion way - using makeup.

The only memorable character is an object: The Nautilus submarine. It is a magical combination of modern technology and old world manufacture and luxuries, and because Nemo is so faithful to his Indian heritage, on turning a corner one does not find vulgar machinery at work, but an altar to Kali or Ganesha. When the ship surfaces in a Venetian canal, which is such a complete and total physical  impossibility that it is completely comical, we know we are in the land of never never action.
The action itself can barely keep track with the characters, all of which must show off their special attributes to contribute to the story, which is basically good versus evil scientists.
Almost all of Venice gets blown up, there is a trip to the Antartica that allows all of them to wear great fur-lined coats, and a lot of speeding under the sea, but I for one feel that a visit to the Nile and the Amazon rivers woudl have been nice additions.

The former James Bond could've stayed quietly retired and contented himself with daily laps in his pool of money.  All of which begs the question:  Why in heaven's name would he associate his good name with a clunker that is THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN?

But alas, it's all water under the Nautilus; Connery headlines this quagmire as slick adventurer Allan Quartermain (but it's still not as fun to say as Miss Moneypenney), out to save the world from certain doom in the last year of the 19th Century.  Yet Mr. Quartermain is not alone; he is aided and abetted by a passle of fictional characters who all lend instant credibility to the story:  Tom Sawyer, Captain Nemo, the Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll/Mister Hyde, Dorian Gray, and Mina Harker (of ""Dracula"" fame).

No, I'm not making this up.  Somebody else did and made a bad movie out of it.  And would someone tell me how a ""league of extraordinary gentlemen"" would include a Mina Harker?  Does Bram Stoker know something the rest of us should know?

But anyway, after what I thought was an absolutely sensational hook, this movie promptly dissolved into more nonsense than an ice fishing contest in the Everglades; nothing, and I mean nada, worked--from the special effects to the action sequences to the trite and sappy dialogue.  I was impressed by Connery's ability to run alot; I only hope I'm that mobile should I reach my eighth decade.  Indeed, there is something extraordinary about THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN.

The year is 1899 and the British government has called upon hunter Allan Quatermain to join a band of 19th century superheroes in preventing the Fantom from destroying the world.  The Fantom, however, begs to differ...
There are hints of James Bond, Dracula, Van Helsing, and Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde among others so the movie falls into the action/adventure/horror type of category.
Sean Connery and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills.
The setting, the plot, the special effects (!), the music, and the costumes are all good.
The only major setback was in relation to Tom Sawyer (?), who seemed totally out of place among the rest, and who probably was incorporated for the sake of including an American hero.

And if such endeavor would make some young people read the original books, one can certainly sympathize with that. But this film is dull. The action scenes are uninspired. And one wonders if the filmmakers even read the original material: here Dorian Gray has more lives than Terminator, Verne's Captain Nemo looks more like Sandokan, Jekyll is inspired more by the incredible Hulk than by the character of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel, Tom Saywer is a hothead cowboy rather than Mark Twain's country boy, etc. There are fine actors here (Sean Connery, for one) but they look embarrassed here, as well as they should be.

Why did they hate this film so much?! It has NON-stop action, great art direction, good casting, (I am in love with Peta WIlson!) a nice, world-threatening plot, (probably yet another nod to Connery,) and passable special effects.

Perhaps it was the obvious hand that Marvel may have had in it...the whole movie reminds me an AWFUL lot of ""Van Helsing"",  what with Mr. Hyde having a prominent part in it, on top of the presence of Richard Roxburgh, who played Dracula in that movie. ""Van Helsing"" also, in turn, bore a strong resemblance to ""X-2, X-Men United"". CGI effects are also a lot more obvious in Marvel's movies than they are in anybody else's, and they are here...THAT could have been a put-off...but for me, the not-so-great CGI was hidden well enough by shadows so that it wasn't as bad as it was in ""The Hulk"" or ""Spiderman"".

The group consists of: Allen Quartermain, (Connery...glad they didn't pick Richard Chamberlain,) Tom Sawyer, The Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, Captain Nemo, (wait 'til you see the Nautilus...WOW!) and a persona de femme from ""Dracula"", Mina Harker, played by Ms. Wilson. Dorian Grey is along for the ride, too, but how much can you trust a character made up by Oscar Wilde?

It's great seeing Connery slug a villain and making it stick, at his age...(he's 77 now, can you believe it?) and Peta Wilson...YES!! Love that accent, love that stature, love that improvement-on-Julie-Christie thing she's got going for her....Love that car, too...I'll bet you anything either Panther Westwinds or Sbarro had something to do with that beast! That looked like a Lancia grille, too!

Anyway, there is, indeed, non-stop action! You really do root for the good guys, especially after it's revealed that the group's being conned by a surprising source, and just marvelling at the great sets and cinematography used in the film is a kick.

If it's based on a comic book it's going to be big, loud, dumb and ridiculous. If you don't go into ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" expecting Oscar-caliber work you won't be disappointed.

The movie is set in 1899. Characters that we know from the literature of the times are assembled as the League: Alan Quartermain, The Invisible Man, Dorian Gray, Captain Nemo, Tom Sawyer, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Dina Harker from Dracula. They are asked to work together to stop a man called The Phantom who is amassing a huge army and futuristic weapons to take over the world. You don't need to know much more because in the end it doesn't make any sense anyway. But why should it, it's source material is a comic book.

The movie is fast paced with some good special effects and well staged action scenes. There are also some bad effects and poorly staged action scenes, cliches aplenty and some dreadful dialog. I didn't take any of it too seriously and found myself enjoying the movie quite a bit. If you absolutely can't stand people with automatic weapons shooting at point blank range and not hitting anything or effects so overblown you can't believe them, this isn't the movie for you.

Rider Haggard's 1885 novel King Solomon's Mines;  Mina Harker from Bram Stroker's immortal vampire book Dracula; Captain Nemo from Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under  the Sea; the sleek and sinister Dorian Gray from Oscar Wilde's the Picture of Dorian Gray; Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde comes from  Robert Louis Stevenson's short novel Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; a grown-up Tom Sawyer, called Agent Sawyer, from Mark Twains various novels; and the thief Rodney Skinner standing in for H. G.

And here they fight a villainous master-mind who is trying to start a world war just to make profits for himself.

I don't know why, but at first, I did not not like this movie. But then I watched it again for a second time and found that despite a certain grimness to the sets that represent 19th century London and Paris, this is a great action/adventure film to rival any James Bond or X-Man movie. It was the kind of a movie that made wished I had read the books all of those heroes-- and the surprise villain-- came from. I think that in spite of the violence, and there is a lot of it, this might be a very good movie for parents to watch with their older kids and point out to them that the great works of literature can be just as exciting as any comic book or video game and get them started on reading just for the pleasure of reading.",1172880000,,1901,4.5659824046920825

The year is 1899 and a villan known only as ""The Fantom"" wishes to launch global armageddon.  He has developed an armored tank impervious to any other weapon, smashed into a London bank, and captured blueprints for the city of Venice.  He wishes to destroy the city and the leaders of Europe who will be attending a conference hosted by the city.

Meanwhile, a gentleman known as M (Richard Roxburgh) has recruited a group of legendary superheroes, including adventurer Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery), vampire Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), invisible man Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran), immortal Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), Tom Sawyer (Shane West), submarine commander Capt. Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), and Dr. Henry Jekyll/Edward Hyde (Jason Fleming) to track down and destroy the mysterious Fantom.

After arriving in Venice aboard Nemo's Nautilis, the group finds that the city is literally collapsing in on itself after several underwater bombs were detonated by the Fantom and his thugs.  The adventurers set off after the Fantom, only later to discover the Fantom's shocking identity.  This discovery throws everything into chaos, as the group struggles with what to do next.  Will the gentlemen succeed in saving Venice, or will the Fantom, who's true identity has been revealed, succeed in his devious plan?

I thought this was a very good film.  I've always been a big fan of Sean Connery, and he does an excellent job as the legendary Quatermain.  The other actors in the movie give fine performances as well.  The special effects, including the scenes containing Nemo's Nautilis and Harker's menacing vampire bats, are well-done.

No, I haven't read the comics...sorry, ""graphic novels,"" so I didn't ""have it ruined for me."" But, please, people. Like they are actually going to put that kind of darkness and violence in a movie kids are going to want to see? Up against ""Pirates?""

Also, I guess I am one of the last generation of Americans that has read any classic literature. I and my sibs got every one of the literary references and laughed each time. Sure, I had a few raised eyebrows (Skinner naked in the snow? Surprised he didn't get frostbite!) and eyerolls (Sawyer! Oh, please! An obvious character addition for young girls). Still, this is a ""what if"" story, so what is the big deal? Sean Connery was a great Quatermain...very much a man of his time. And what can I say about Naseeruddin Shah except he was a fabulous Nemo. Yes, I remember seeing that Disney movie ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea."" That movie is what started a young girl's fascination (okay, crush) on Captain Nemo, and Shah's portrayal brought it all back in spades! (You should really check out some of his other movies) He portrayed Nemo just as I had imagined him (and hello to all the dorks out there that didn't know Nemo is Indian!!!) I like that he was an excellent warrior, as well as a genius, and yet still was gentlemanly and cultured...just don't get him mad! He was, after all, a freedom fighter, and no, that wasn't supposed to be kung fu, but more likely the Sikh martial art of Gatka. People just don't bother to learn that other cultures have developed their own version of martial arts, I guess.

Anyway, to stop nitpicking other peoples comments, some of the other characters I enjoyed were Skinner (Curran, very cheeky) and Jekyll/Hyde (Flemyng, wonderful self-torture, there). Mina (Wilson) didn't unveil her ""gifts"" until they were needed, as it should be, and I have to give credit to the unappealing Dorian (Townsend) because I immediately didn't like him. Ick. The only weak link was Sawyer (West), but I believe it was because his character was squeezed in for...whatever reason.

I am no expert on CGI, but I felt the production values were wonderful. Wow...the Nautilus was stupendous (and loved the interior decor).

There has been a rumor out there that a sequel is being considered, and talk of ""re-casting"" many of the roles. That, to me, would be a HUGE mistake! If you don't want Sir Sean as Quatermain...don't re-cast. Just leave him out. Horrible mistake if you re-cast Nemo. Naseeruddin DEFINED Nemo. Skinner and Jekyll...oh, heck. Just bring them all back...except Sawyer. He really wasn't a necessary character (nothing extraordinary there). Again, no reflection on West.

1480425,5,B00005JM5B,"Although critics and some other people have taken great pleasure in ripping this movie, I actually enjoyed it very much. It was a fun adventure flick with some of my favorite literary characters. It was just dark enough to add dimension to them without losing the fun of the genre. How could I not enjoy it? No, I haven't read the comics...sorry, ""graphic novels,"" so I didn't ""have it ruined for me."" But, please, people. Like they are actually going to put that kind of darkness and violence in a movie kids are going to want to see? Up against ""Pirates?""

Also, I guess I am one of the last generation of Americans that has read any classic literature. I and my sibs got every one of the literary references and laughed each time. Sure, I had a few raised eyebrows (Skinner naked in the snow? Surprised he didn't get frostbite!) and eyerolls (Sawyer! Oh, please! An obvious character addition for young girls). Still, this is a ""what if"" story, so what is the big deal? Sean Connery was a great Quatermain...very much a man of his time. And what can I say about Naseeruddin Shah except he was a fabulous Nemo. Yes, I remember seeing that Disney movie ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea."" That movie is what started a young girl's fascination (okay, crush) on Captain Nemo, and Shah's portrayal brought it all back in spades! (You should really check out some of his other movies) He portrayed Nemo just as I had imagined him (and hello to all the dorks out there that didn't know Nemo is Indian!!!) I like that he was an excellent warrior, as well as a genius, and yet still was gentlemanly and cultured...just don't get him mad! He was, after all, a freedom fighter, and no, that wasn't supposed to be kung fu, but more likely the Sikh martial art of Gatka.

1480426,3,B00005JM5B,"Based on the graphic novels (i.e. comic books) created by writer Alan Moore and illustrator Kevin O'Neill, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003) was adapted for the silver screen by James Robinson (Hot Wheels) and directed by Stephen Norrington (Death Machine, Blade).  The film features an interesting cast including Sean Connery (Dr. No, Highlander), who's also credited as one of the producers, Peta Wilson (""La Femme Nikita""), Tony Curran (Blade II), Jason Flemyng (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), Naseeruddin Shah (Monsoon Wedding), Stuart Townsend (Queen of the Damned), Shane West (Dracula 2000), and Richard Roxburgh (Van Helsing).

The film, set in the year 1899, begins with a bang as we witness some mysterious assailants with German accents breaking into the Bank of England in a giant tank.  Next we see a zeppelin factory in Berlin assaulted by what appears to be British troops brandishing sophisticated weaponry.  As the various attacks continue Europe is thrown into turmoil as countries begin pointing the accusatory finger at each other.  Seems the British gooberment, believing an individual named The Fantom, who uses a Phantom of the Opera mask to conceal his identity, to be orchestrating the attacks, decides to assemble a team of extraordinary gentlemen (and a lady) including the following...hunter/adventurer Allan Quatermain (Connery), scientist/pseudo vampire Mina Harker (Wilson), sailor and inventor Captain Nemo (Shah), Rodney Skinner (Curran), who possesses the trait of invisibility, a snide, effeminate immortal named Dorian Gray (Townsend), and an American secret service goober by the name of Tom Sawyer (West)...oh brutha...anyway, after an run in with The Fantom, the group pops over to Paris in Nemo's ridiculously ginormous submarine called the Nautilus to gather a hulking Mr. Hyde, who, when in his non brutish form as Dr. Jekyll is played by Flemyng, finally setting sail for Venice, where a group of European leaders is set to gather offering a prime target for the villainous Fantom (seems The Fantom is interested in starting a world war so that he may profit from selling his fantastic weapons).  Anyway, the group manages to foil The Fantom's plans and avert a catastrophic disaster, but there's treachery afoot as one of the team members is a double agent, working with The Fantom, eventually escaping in Nemo's mini-submarine called the Nautiloid...that's cute...but not before seriously crippling Nemo's ship through some sabotage.  Soon after the group manages to get a line on The Fantom, following him to his secret base, which is actually a massive fortress somewhere in Mongolia, and learn the true nature of his nefarious plans along with his actual identity.

I'm not familiar with the source material for this film, but I am a little familiar with some of Alan Moore's other works including V for Vendetta, which I thought translated into an excellent film, and Watchmen, which was in the process of being adapted to the screen but currently seems to be in limbo.  Given this familiarity, I got the impression the film strayed a bit, the focus on the special effects emphasized over the actual content within the source material.  Now generally films do lose something in translation (they're rarely as good as the books they're based), but in this case it seemed especially true...anyway, as far as the positives...the movie was very slick, the action sequences plenty, the performances relatively decent...and the negatives...the dialogue often felt goofy, the heavy reliance on computer generated effects grew tiresome (I thought the miniature work awesoma), and the characters had little substance.  I particularly despised the hokum, pseudo father/son relationship developed between Quatermain and Sawyer as it the more it grew, the more I gagged on its sickly sweetness (apparently Quatermain had a son-in-law who got killed under his watch, and now has found a sort of surrogate in Tom Sawyer...bleeech).  I thought Peta Wilson looked good (she actually looks better here with dark hair than her normal blonde) but I thought her character odd in that she was supposed to be a vampire, but had no difficulty venturing into the daylight.  Seems with what I know about vampires sunlight is especially harmful, with a special exception to Wesley Snipes character in the Blade films, but that seemed not the case here.  The silliest character, for me at least, was Hyde.  He was ridiculously huge, in league with Marvel's The Hulk...near the end there's a bit, without going too much into the story, where Hyde ends up fighting a misshapen Mega-Hyde, and things move into the realm of the asinine.  As far as the other characters, well, they were there I suppose...I found it difficult to root for these so called `heroes' mainly because they possessed little of the substance one would have expected from their namesakes.  Perhaps this was a case of trying to incorporate too many characters in a single film, and as a result most of them come off like cardboard cutouts, lacking various qualities necessary to flesh them out fully.  As far as the main villain, well, I thought his plan, as initially presented, an interesting one, but once his full plan (which included a number of aspects) was revealed it mired itself into convoluted mess, at least in terms of execution, specifically because it was dependant on elements which were out of his control.  I thought the `Fantom' persona unnecessary, overly cumbersome, and senseless in general.  I also thought, given the character's obviously extensive resources, it seemed foolish that he should always be in the middle of the action (and danger), especially since he had an army equipped with highly sophisticated weapons of mass destruction.  By the way, one might feel a certain sense of immunity having their secret hideout/fortress in a remote location, but that doesn't mean one should skimp on security measures.  The League showed up at The Fantom's door, knocked out like two guards, and they were in. just like that.  Oh well...all in all a there's a whole lot of colorful, farcical action throughout, but if you're looking for substance, given the abundance of so called literary characters, or something akin to Moore's original vision, you're probably going to be disappointed.

The picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) looks excellent, and the audio, available in 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround (English and French), and Dolby Digital Surround (Spanish), comes through most excellent.  As far as extras there's two commentary tracks, one with producers and cast members, and another with a number of crew members, along with 12 extended and deleted scenes, a behind the scenes documentary titled `Assembling the League' which provides a lot of `making of' materials, and subtitles in English and Spanish.  I dunno...seems kind of skimpy for a film that was as heavily promoted as it was prior to its theatrical release.

A couple more things...I thought the film could have used a couple more comely females running around because as it stands, it kind of comes off as a sausage fest (and it's not like a couple extra characters would have hurt the film as it is).  Also, did anyone else who saw this have a hankering to yank on Captain Nemo's extraordinary long beard?  He kind of looked like the lost member of ZZ Top...",1159401600,6,7391,5.155518394648829

1480428,4,B00005JM5B,"Once again we have the temptation to compare the book to the movie, which I will succumb to just a little. Books and movies are different media, and each brings its own strengths to art. Such is the case here. The book was full and lengthy and while it brought the same breadth of characters, it was able to provide a broader background for each of the characters. There were some spots where I thought the book was just a bit fuzzy on the plot, but I loved the style.

The movie provides more visuals, but with a two-hour length it had to cut back on the length of background for the characters. The movie glossed over some of the darker aspects of the characters, particular Alan Quatermain, but enhanced others, particular the background of Mina Harker. The other strange addition was that of the character of Dorian Gray. I also objected to the change in the invisible man character from the book to the movie. I much preferred the book's Hawley Griffin as the invisible man versus Rodney Skinner, who supposedly stole the formula. Griffin was a much stronger, more tormented character, though his characterization would require more film time to establish and would likely have weakened the roles of the primary actors.

In terms of characterization, Sean Connery clearly shined as Quatermain, as he always seems to do in every role. Peta Wilson is excellent as the sultry, dangerous Mina Harker. Naseeruddin Shah as Captain Nemo returns Nemo to his original characterization by Verne as a Sikh. Shah's Nemo was a welcome variation to previous Nemos, providing a sense of command, control and honor in comparison to those others who sometimes seemed simpering and typically talked far too much for Verne's Nemo. The other actors have insufficient screen time to fully flesh out their roles, partially because of the large number of lead characters.

The plot itself is a bit of a muddle. It's difficult to follow the progression and contrivances that lead from point-to-point. Often the logic is non-existent, and the viewer is left to wonder how they knew they were headed the right direction other than a trite explanation by one of the lead characters. Had the movie been extended by another 15 or 20 minutes many of the incongruities could have been reduced and the story flow could have been smoothed. To try to minimize the various confusions: Essentially the story is about a group of sort of good guys out to stop a definite bad guy from conquering the world, except the bad guy has been cleverly manipulating the sort of good guys all along and has a nefarious reason (of course) for doing so.

The special effects end up providing much of the focus of the movie in lieu of a more coherent plot. Some of the special effects are very good, such as the bizarre image of the Nautilus sailing the canals of Venice. The destruction of Venice by underwater bombs is mundane by today's standards. The other special effects vary in their quality and effect on the viewer, but are generally good. As noted before, the special effects often substitute for plot.

Though some of my criticisms are not encouraging, I actually liked the movie. As a B movie it is okay. Clearly not in the league of movies such as the Lord of the Rings, it is nonetheless a rousing adventure. In general the movie rates 3 stars, but I'm giving it 4 stars because of the three actors that really made this movie for me: Connery, Wilson and Shah.",1157328000,,3427,4.705

1480432,2,B00005JM5B,"`The Society of Extraordinary Gentlemen' is quite simply a comic book movie done almost exclusively to revel in special effects excesses. Virtually the only useful thing I got from this DVD is the fact that Sean Connery was offered and turned down parts in both `The Matrix' and `The Lord of the Rings'. I hope Sir Sean is regretting the fact that he gave up the chance to play Gandalf in the hands down most successful fantasy movie series of all time!

Since I am recommending you not bother buying this clunker, I will review the premise.

The story gathers together seven major fictional character from 19th century novels. Specifically, there is:

Alan Quatermain (Connery's character) from H. Rider Haggert's novels.

Captain Nemo from Jules Verne's novels, especially '20 Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'.

Dorian Gray from Oscar Wilde's `The Picture of Dorian Gray'

Dr. Jekyl / Mr. Hyde from Robert Lewis Stevenson's `Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde'.

The Invisible Man from H. G. Wells `The Invisible Man'.

Tom Sawyer from Mark Twain's `Tom Sawyer' and `Huckleberry Finn'

Minna Harker from Bram Stoker's `Dracula'

The cast is made even more improbable by casting Dr. Hyde as the perp of Edgar Allen Poe's `Murders in the Rue Morgue'.

The immediate and most obvious anomoly here is the absence of the singularly most useful character, Sherlock Holmes, or at least his even more shadowy brother, Mycroft Holmes. The value of Quatermain, Nemo, and the invisible man are fairly easy to take in a CIA wet work type of operation, but the appropriateness of the other characters are a real stretch. Except for the displacement of about 100 years, this story is basicly something straight out of `The Fantastic Four' or the `X-Men', except that the X-men movies were much, much better than this clunker. Like a similar movie, `Van Helsing', the whole affair is nothing more than to execute a special effects tour de force, with practically no other good coming from the exercize.

This fantasy may have been just a bit easier to take, if it were not for the truly great fantasies done recently such as `The Lord of the Rings', `The Narnia Chronicles', and the Matrix trilogy.

1480434,4,B00005JM5B,"What might happen if the heroes of literature were real?  That is part of the premise of this Victorian adventure.  Allan Quartermain is hired with other illustrious name to form a team to thwart a menace that threatens the world.  The team includes Captain Nemo, Mina Harker, Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde and the invisible man (but not the original).  They are later joined by Tom Sawyer and Dorian Gray.  They must stop a madman from plunging the world into war.

The adventure carries them to Venice and Russia.  They must face their foe as well as treachery from many angles.  Each brings their own special talents to bear.  Plot and counter plot are revealed amid much action and daring-do.  As is typical it all comes down to a final showdown between heroes and bad guy although there is a very nice twist at the end.

Fans of the original comic may hate this movie.  The characters have been greatly changed.  Mina is no longer in charge and has some new abilities.  Quartermain is his younger self.  The invisible man is a thug who stole the formula.  Sawyer is brought in to add a little American taste and Dorian Gray is added.  I am still not sure after several watchings why the League was formed.  The villains goals could have been reached without creating the formidable force.  Seeing the gigantic Nautilus navigate the canals of Venice was quite humorous.  I also wasn't aware that one could race a huge car clear across Venice.  Nemo claimed the invention of the automobile although they already exited at the time the movie is set.

1480467,2,B00005JM5B,"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen takes its concept from the graphic novel by Alan Moore, pitting a group of 19th century literary characters into the real world to fight the forces of evil. The cast includes legendary hunter Alan Quartermain, Captain Nemo of the Nautilus, Mina Harker of Dracula fame, the infamous Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and The Invisible Man as well as two new characters not found in the graphic novels: Dorian Grey and Tom Sawyer. The League is sent on a quest to apprehend The Phantom, a mysterious villian trying to start a World War. Throughout the film, the tone is heavy-handed and there is hardly any proper character development or humor except for a few one-liners which fail to generate any laughs. The mystery behind the members of the League themselves, the brilliant wit and dialogue, and the slow, uneasy build-up of trust that forms among the group that was so excellently done in the book are all missing here. Instead they are replaced with ludicrous action scenes featuring fully automatic weapons and a high speed car chase through Venice among a myriad of other things that make absolutely no sense for a movie that takes place in 1899, no matter how absurd the technology of the original graphic novel. Granted that the overall plot of Moore's miniseries wasn't much stronger than the bland plot twists here, the writers and director would have benefitted from borrowing more of Alan Moore's ideas apart from the basic concept itself for the film. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is still a fantastic idea that was, unfortunately, poorly handled.

These titans of american fiction all have their special abilities and legendary skills:

Alan Quatermain - an excelent exploerer who has a taste for adventure even at an old age.

The Invisble man - a creeping sly cat who is stuck in his invisible body until he could find an antidote.

Captain Nemo - famous spy who pirates plans and builds massive machinery.

Mina Harker - the fabled wife of johnathan harker who has a deep dark secret, a perfect dark ability that strengthens her independent spirit.

Dorian Gray - a man with a cursed ability to never die.

Tom Sawyer - the adventurous risk-taker who mimics quatermains spirit.

Dr. Jekal/ Mr. Hyde - the man and the myth of changing into a massive beast of a man with great strength but a short temper.

All of these fictional characters combined makes for a team that is stylishly clever and ready to fit the screen.

Together, they unravel the mystery of their newest foe: the Phantom.

1480471,3,B00005JM5B,"When I first heard that they were doing a film adaptation of Alan Moore's classic graphic novel The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen I was very excited at the prospect. Alan Moore's alternate historical tale of late 19th-century literary characters of Captain Nemo, Mina Harker, Allan Quatermain, Invisible Man and Mr. Hyde was well-received by both critics and fans of comics. This story was one of those kinds that just begged to be made into a film and I remember many discussions with other fans of who exactly should play the characters from the book. This property was one of those can't-miss. But too much tinkering with Moore's story, characters and overall themes made too much of a mess of a film.

I'll start by admitting that I enjoyed the film enough. The film had enough action sequences to keep my attention. The story was fun enough to follow, albeit confusing since I was expecting something else on the screen after I'd read the graphic novel prior to seeing the film. The special-effects work were done well enough, though a few shots here and there looked to much like CGI. LXG looked good overall, but it wasn't the League that Moore created that I so enjoyed reading. As I said earlier, too much tinkering by the producers, director and writers from the original source material made what was an ok, fun film experience into something even better.

The film that I saw was so different from the book that it should've been called something else. Characters were added that were never in the book. Usually such film adaptations of comic books make such changes, but in LXG they made major character additions that changed the entire dynamics of the team and those they were were up against. Some characters from the book that had pivotal supporting roles were removed outright. By the time all the changes were done the film and the book were two separately, distinct works that only had certain characters in common and that was it.

In the end, as a big fan of Alan Moore's graphic novel I was disappointed to no end. I still enjoyed the film once I realized that I wasn't seeing the book come to life but watching a wholly different animal. LXG (as the studio sometimes marketed the film as) is an ok enough film even fun if one was into such types of entertainment, but it could've been better and it should've been.

1480485,4,B00005JM5B,"For the most part, I did enjoy ""The League of Extrodinary Gentlemen"". It was great fun to see many of the characters from the classic books i enjoy come to life in such an unusual manner. I loved the acting, particularly by Sean Connery, and though I don't know the other actors, I loved Tom Sawyer, Dorian Gray, and The Invisible man.

  THere were a few things I didn't really appreciate, though I was glad there was no horribly inappropriate language or conduct (thank goodness!). SInce this is, after all, the league of extrodinary GENTLEMEN, I did not think Mina really belonged in this heroic team up. I do not like dracula, and some of her actions were down right disturbing. It is for this reason I did not give the movie 5 stars.

  I also enjoyed picking out points that seemed to mirror other great classics, including ""the phantom of the opera""

  However, this is most certainly a great action movie and I thought the special effects were fairly well done, (though the end battle between hyde and the captain who drank Jekyll's formula was way over the top).

  I would suggest this movie, but not give such top recommendations as other movies like ""The Time Machine"" and ""The Phantom of the Opera"".

  But it deffinately made me want to go out and read books like ""The Portrait of Dorian Gray"", and ""Twenty THousand Leagues under the Sea.""",1129593600,9,1353,4.602510460251046

1) Some attack Mina's uses of a mirror to remove blood from her face and ask ""aren't vampires invisible in mirrors""?

Answer: Blood reflects in a mirror even if a vampire doesn't Mina's use of a mirror isn't a problem.

2) Mina is also attacked because ""when she's seen in the sunlight, with no discomfort at all, we're supposed to just accept this too?"".

Answer: Mina comes from a novel by Bram Stoker called DRACULA. Stoker's vampires can expose themselves to sunlight with no damage. It's not a problem that Mina can expose herself to sunlight in LXG.

3) ""Mr. Hyde can carry on a conversation?""

Answer: Yes. He speaks in Stevenson's classic story. He has also done so in numerous film versions. It's not a problem that Hyde speaks in LXG. It would be odd if he couldn't!

1480492,3,B00005JM5B,"""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" got such punishing reviews when it was released in the summer of 2003 that it took me two years to finally get around to watching it.  And I must say that, now, having seen it, I can't understand what all the fuss was about.  This is a perfectly serviceable big budget action movie as such things go - not much better, but certainly no worse, than half a dozen similar movies released that summer (it's actually less bloated than the far more popular ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" which inexplicably garnered rave reviews and sailed off with boatloads of money).

It's 1899, the dawn of a new century, one in which all the old weapons of war are fast becoming obsolete and are giving way to far more lethal implements of mass destruction - machine guns, armored tanks, submarines and mega-explosives - all capable of killing far greater numbers of people than was ever thought possible before.  Enter the Fantom [sic], a mysterious villain bent on using all this quickly developing technology to wage a global war with himself as commanding general.  To counter this, a man named ""M"" gathers together a group of characters culled from 19th Century literary sources - among them Captain Nemo, The Invisible Man, Dorian Gray, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, even Tom Sawyer! - to do battle against the menace.

Although the script could have done a better job fleshing out the characters and making them more intriguing and distinct as individuals, the film has a couple of interesting plot twists and enough high-tech hardware to keep us entertained, if not exactly enthralled, through most of its running time.  The movie is breezily paced and the screenplay has a fun time tossing around a lot of ""in"" jokes for those in the audience familiar with the literary backgrounds of these various characters.

Sean Connery leads the cast as Allan Quartermain, an aging adventurer contentedly wiling away his golden years in Africa, until he is called back into the queen's service at this critical juncture in the empire`s - and the world's - history.  Naseeruddin Shah,  Peta Wilson, Tony Curran, Stuart Townsend, Shane West, Jason Flemyng and Richard Roxburgh round out the rest of the cast.

There really isn't anything that ""extraordinary"" about this ""League,"" but if you happen to run across this film on cable some long, lonely night, you may find it passable for an evening's entertainment.",1123286400,8,2421,4.909313725490196

Basically this story is about some great 19th century heroes of literature thrown together to fight a super criminal.  They bring all of their strengths and all of their shortcomings to form a slightly disfunctional but very unique band of crime fighters.

This movie can easily draw a lot of complaints from a lot of different circles.  I watched this movie only having read about half of the classic books and none of the graphic novels.  So I think I looked at it very objectively.  I liked watching the movie the first time and the second time and so on.  It also prompted me to read the actual books that the characters were originally from.  What more could you want?

Could this movie have done more? Maybe.  Was it fun to watch over and over again? Absolutely.  Bottom line if you like action movies then this is for you.",1123027200,9,931,4.354651162790698

LXG the movie may be ""comic booky"" (I stole that term from the reviewer before me) but it didn't completely butcher the literary characters it utilized like the comic book did. I respect that about this movie. I also think it's entertaining in a saturday matinee cliffhanger serial kind of way. It's like a vintage comic book and that's fun! Be sure to read the original novels before turning to Moore's comic. Moore bastardized Quatermain so that he was nothing like the original.

1480529,2,B00005JM5B,"Having read the comics on which this film was based I already knew this movie had enormous shoes to fill. Having heard that it was going to become a ""Summer Flick"" I became even more wary. Hearing that it was being referred to and ""posterized"" as ""LXG"" (how un-Victorian can you get?)I became even MORE wary. Then when I saw the trailer I became absolutely horrified by what I saw.

Then I went and saw it. Hey, I never said I was smart.

Did I find it absolutely terrible? No. It was just a little below fair...and in my opinion that is the worst place for a movie to be. If it is terrible it still (depending on what kind of movie buff you are) has the capacity to entertain you. ""LXG"" offers nothing new to the Action/Adventure genre on top of being a lousy adaptation of a damned in depth and entertaining comic.

While the comic series focuses on the idea of ""What would the world be like if the stories found in old fantasy/sci-fi/adventure novels and ""penny dreadfuls"" were actually true?"" and interweaves minor characters from any number of books among the main characters the movie on the other hand doesn't concern itself much with this...only content on throwing people one or two bones in this regard. What the movie is more concerned with is throwing in cliched anachronisms not seen since the seemingly more ambitious Wild Wild West.

You will be amazed by machine guns in the 19th century! Tanks! And...a psuedo-Victorian/1930's looking car!

""I call it an 'automobile'"". -Captain Nemo, LXG

And I call it groan worthy.

I could point out the horrid effects and whatnot but in the end...if a movie has a good story with good characters the ""specialness"" of the effects wouldn't really matter all that much. The fact that you register that the effects are seriously lacking is a result of the fact that everything else is just as bad or worse.

This is no slight to the actors of course for the most part but a slight to the dialogue they have to spew out. Sean Connery is enjoyable to watch no matter what he is in, though more and more lately his real life ""crotchety old Scot"" seems to be oozing out of his performances more and more. I also found myself liking the guy that played Captain Nemo...aside from the producer's/writer's/director's idea that he should use martial arts.

Yeah.

Short story long...if you are a fan of the literary works that are vaguely referenced in this movie and you made the serious mistake of seeing this film I must suggest you check out The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen vol. 1 and 2. In Alan Moore's work there you will be dizzied by the amount of literary references there as well as wildly entertained. I would hate to think this movie would dissuade you from that. If you are an action/adventure movie aficienado as I am, you still won't be impressed. Nothing in this movie hasn't been done before, trust me.

The movie is kind of like X-Men even though I have to say that  preferred X-Men and X-2 over this. But, this could be compared to them because it has numerous heroes and not just one like in Spiderman or Batman. The movie has these heroes that gather: Alan Quartermain played by Sean Connery as a skilled hunter, the invisible man who is..invisible, Captain Nemo who's got some big swords and a BIG ship, Dorian Gray who's skilled and yes.. invincible, Dr. Jekyll/ Hyde who's at times skinny and punny and at times absolutely gigantic and monstruous, Tom Sawyer and Mina Harker, a vampire.

1480565,3,B00005JM5B,"The great rule of turning a comic book into a movie is this: Thou shalt not change the premise of the story.

League of Extraordinary Gentlemen breaks the rule. All the creators of the movie had to do was stick to the source material. They could've had a blast of a movie but no they had to go and make changes....such as adding Tom Sawyer to the mix. This did nothing for the story at all. Mina, an English woman who survived Dracula is turned into Amazonesque woman with what sounds like a Swedish accent. Mina is also a full fledged day walking vampire in the movie. In the book she is not. In the book Mina and Quartermaine (played by the always sexy Sean Connery) are intensely attracted to one another despite their age difference.

In the movie Mina is messing around with Dorian Gray who doesn't even appear in the book. The Invisible Man is wildly different from the character in both the comic book and the original novel. Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde are, at least, handled  mostly true to the comic book though the movie gives no indication about how Hyde feels about Mina. Captain Nemo, the real hero of the movie is the only character to make the jump from the book to the screen unscathed.

So if you are offended by what I call the ""blasphemy against the inane"" then you might be offended by this film which features a great performance by Sean Connery even though you've seen this character portrayed by him many times.

The spirit of a comic book is retained with much posturing and pretentious dialogue, the starkness between the heroes and villians and plenty of campy banter and comeradery. The main bad guy turns out to be a madman who wants to take over the world (surprise, surprise.) Foibles of the heroes are well explored - we see Jekyll's cowardice, Sawyer's youthful inexperience, Nemo's Kali-worship, Quartermain's indifference to his nation's plight, etc. The characters from famous literature are a bit ""off"" from their original, but fun nontheless; I can't imagine that Mark Twain wanted Tom Sawyer to become an intelligence agent for the United States, but it's played out cleverly in the plot.

The effects are stunning; I especially liked the Nautilus design and the way the Invisible Man was portrayed. The dialogue never gets too silly and when the viewer feels that it's about to it was saved by an action segment.

1480567,5,B00005JM5B,"Reminding you uncomfortably of ""Wild Wild West,"" an anachronistically modern action-adventure set firmly in the 19th century, ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" assembles fantastic fictional personages of the Victorian era for an over-the-top visual-effects extravaganza.

Star and exec producer Sean Connery is on hand to anchor the 1899 comic-book exploits with his formidable presence. Yet nothing anchors the lighter-than-air story as it drifts away under the direction of Stephen Norrington (""Blade"") into an FX stratosphere where wit, character and vigorous storytelling cease to matter. As an oddity -- a tentpole summer movie featuring characters more at home in a classic monster movie marathon on TV -- ""League"" might attract the under-25 crowd this weekend. But these MDCCCXCIX-Men are no X-Men.

The gimmick here, courtesy of comic books by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill, is to bring together an assortment of late-19th century fictional characters, the common denominator apparently being that they all have outlived copyright protection. So in the year 1899, Sean Connery's legendary British adventurer Allan Quatermain is summoned from his gin-sodden slumber in sleepy Africa by Her Majesty's government to defend the realm and Western world against an evil and mysterious Fantom.

He is to recruit and lead a League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which includes no gentlemen and one questionable lady. These are: Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), seen here as a Kali-worshipping Indian sea pirate outfitted with a ridiculous paste-on rabbi's beard; Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), wife to Dracula's discoverer, poor Jonathan Harker, now herself a full-fledged vampire; the Invisible Man's successor, Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran), seen only when he dons clothes or smears his face with makeup; the immortal double bill of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (Jason Flemyng), where Mr. H. is deemed a creature not unlike the Hulk -- just not green; American secret agent Tom Sawyer (Shane West), who bears no resemblance to Mark Twain's character; and finally and most improbably, Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), Oscar Wilde's vile yet ageless wonder. Do the filmmakers really believe the under-25 crowd knows the works of Wilde?

The plot, an elusive thing constructed by James Dale Robinson, initially sends this gang of eccentrics off to Venice in Nemo's Nautilus submarine to save the city from destruction. For all their prowess, an hour into the film, Venice lies in ruins. (Question: Why destroy St. Mark's Square in 1899 with Hollywood special effects when we know it still stands in 2003?) The remainder of the movie gets spent in the frozen wastes of Mongolia, where weapons of mass destruction are being manufactured by the Fantom. (George W. Bush, take note!) It is here that the movie completely surrenders itself to the FX wizards at the expense of character, story and mood.

The movie self-destructs before your eyes. If you are willing to buy a pre-Model T limousine in 1899 London, then this is your film. If lines like ""You're missing a picture, Mr. Gray"" seem the height of wit, then go for it. If having a multitude of celebrity creatures but not enough time to let them strut their stuff sounds like good planning, then by all means celebrate. Many viewers, though, may be discouraged at the empty stunts and effects, accompanied by a noisy, full-bore score, while good actors get lost in the chaos.

Not that I didn't enjoy the movie for what it is:  sublimely inspired schlock.  The Roger Eberts of the world can quibble about the implausibility of gigantic submarines surfacing in Venice canals...  do dreams always make sense?  Then, why must movies?

What this movie points out to me is the potential that is there for a truly inspired artist to make a Victorian science fiction masterpiece, given the cinematic tools that are available today. I know of at least three eccentric geniuses that have drawn on the Victorian sensibility:  film director David Lynch (""Dune"" was a nice try, Dave, but you can do better),  photographer Joel- Peter Witkin ( a poet of the beauty of deformed weirdness ), and musician Robert Fripp, whose band King Crimson in its middle period was nothing if not Victorian mad-inventor strangeness.  If only a film director could make a movie as dark and twisted as Fripp's composition ""Fractured"",  I'd be a happy boy. Many other artists, visual and otherwise, have mined the Victorian imagination, but no film director has ever ""hit the jackpot"", so to speak.

Taken on its own, the film isn't all that bad.  It's pure B Movie fun and Sean Connery and the cast (Stuart Townsend as well) have a terrific time with their characters.  I was disappointed by Hyde - how does a ghastly creature who murders people in the Rue Morgue and is the embodiment of pure evil suddenly decide to be helpful and a team player?  He also looks amazingly fake.

The plot is silly and exists only for fight scenes and the Fantom is a terrible movie villian (how does he get around in all that armor?) but I always like lots of kung fu and flips so it was fun to watch.

I agree with another reviewer - the ending is lame.  Rent but don't buy.",1112140800,3,918,4.265895953757226
1480572,5,B00005JM5B,"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is witty, action packed and smart.  The film is, of course based on the comic book literary characters, and not so much on their traditional literary roles.  One of the most interesting things done in this film dealt with Professor Moriarty.  At the beginning he is portrayed as a middle aged gentleman, and at the end he is shown in younger form.  Of course this is reminiscent of the idea that there were actually 3 Moriarty brothers - the elder being a professor, and the youngest being a criminal mastermind.  The younger, according to his creator, Jules Verne, kills the elder and disguises himself as the professor.  The only thing that would have been even wittier in this film would have been if they had managed to get Richard Roxburgh to play three roles instead of two, also posing as Captain Nemo.  There is a strong belief among Jules Verne scholars that Captain Nemo was infact Professor James Moriarty!!!  This film is an excellent action piece, whose only short coming would be the CGI effects (and no, Mr. Hyde is not CGI!!).  There are a few characters that were CGI rendered which were obviously fake.

The basic idea of a movie that made literary figures into action heroes was both appealing and frightening to me. Yes, it would be interesting to see these characters from another perspective, but would they be dulled by the action oriented premise?

God yes! The characters where absolutely hollow. Everyone seemed to want to care about something, but they couldn't be bothered to spare the effort. The one brief glimpse of characterization is in the relationship between Quartermaine and Sawyer, and even that is never truly explored. There was a thin plot, but no real story, and it seemed like the whole film was merely a vehicle to allow the director to play with as many unique and nausea inducing camera angles as possible.

Beyond that, even my husband, who was largely interested in the effects promised was disappointed to a degree. I pay far less attention to how the effects work than he does, and yet some look fake even to me.",1109030400,9,1184,4.7101449275362315
1480615,3,B00005JM5B,"Director Stephen Norrington apparently has an obsession with time bombs.

Every once in a while, the movie will cut to an ominously ticking stack of dynamite, that will inevitably go off a few seconds after we realize its there. And that just about sums up the movie; very predictable.

The plot is paper-thin and completely unbelievable. The script can be witty at times, especially the dialogue of Quatermain, Gray, and Skinner. But it tends to revert to cliched cheesiness around Nemo and Mina. The movie makes astounding leaps in logic, with the Nautilus first shown to be about 5 times the size of the Titanic, and in the next scene easily able to squeeze through the narrow canals of Venice. Also, the ship somehow ends up in Mongolia after sailing Northeast from Venice. The visuals are heavily overdone, and the CGI is rough.

So then what prevents this movie from bombing completely? It is the individual performances that hold it up. Sean Connery exudes charisma and authority, while Stuart Townsend is an understated revelation as the darkly charming Dorian Gray. Tom Sawyer was put in to draw the American cinegoer, but does a palatable job. And groanworthy moments apart (Monster Hyde actually initiates a team handshake), Dr Jekyll is very interesting. It is the way in which the cast, especially the Invisible Man, knows not to take themselves too seriously that makes the movie work.

1480643,4,B00005JM5B,"Q:  What do you get when you create a story based on teaming up the combined talents of heroes born of many of the world's most famous literary classics of the past, including H Rider Haggard's King Solomon's Mines, Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea, H.G. Wells' The Invisible Man, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray, Robert Louise Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and Herman Melville's Moby Dick?

A:  A ripping good yarn. But you also inherit a minefield by borrowing from so many loved literary classics.

A ripping good yarn is the way that the big-budget, popcorn action film The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen should be approached. It is a highly entertaining, rip-roaring tale exploring the fantasy of what might have been possible had all these extraordinary fictional characters been able to team up for a common purpose. The thought that these characters were originally created of completely different time periods and not of the same collective fictional universe should be left behind. This film is not meant to be taken too seriously - it is purely and simply a bit of fun. Unfortunately though, many critics have panned the film outright by seizing on numerous inconsistencies in the portrayal of these classic literary characters as not being completely authentic to their original authors. I can appreciate from a literary sense where these critics are coming from and can understand why this film irks those who love the classics. But still, one should hardly expect that a story idea based on bringing together such a highly fanciful collaboration of all these characters will result in anything other than an excuse to have a bit of fun. Viewed with this overriding goal in mind, once you allow your criticism of minor inconsistencies of the character portrayals to be suspended, The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen delivers on the fun scale in spades.

The fun thing about this film is that you don't have to have read all of these literary classic to enjoy the movie. There are many ""in-references"" inserted throughout to cater for those who have an appreciation of the abovementioned novels and others including the works of Ian Fleming and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but certainly the movie can be appreciated as a stand-alone experience even if you only know some or few of these works. As an aside, the fact that the film tries to be rather cute in playing to the intelligentsia of its audience with its many deliberate ""in-references"" is only problematic, given that those same audience members to whom such references are aimed will also by corollary tend to be the same people who care enough about the classics to highlight the resultant inconsistencies in the character treatments. I think this, more than any other reason, is ultimately why The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen failed to impress the critics more than it did; you simply can't have your cake and eat it too.

The storyline is very well thought-out, if not arguably a bit too rushed for my liking, with a large amount of story and action crammed into a 110 minute film. The plot is premised around cramming in as much action into the story as possible, with every hero given a chance to shine in their turn. This is also a big-budget action film, so the production values are high, particularly in aspects such as the attention to detail in the character costumes. The special effects are also, for the most part, great - it's just a pity that only one or two dodgy effects shots stand out to prove an exception to a great job (these one or two shots being suboptimal only due to the lack of time available to complete them before the theatrical release date (the usual story)). The acting in this film is certainly rock solid, and this is particularly the case - yet again - with Sean Connery. Can this man do nothing wrong in the acting stakes? I don't think I have ever seen him deliver a poor performance. This view has been stated a million times before me by a million other film reviewers, but I agree that Sean Connery really is one of, if not the, most arresting and most charismatic screen personalities of our time. With all of these positives going for it then, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a highly entertaining action flick.",1103846400,12,4362,4.809333333333333

1480679,3,B00005JM5B,"Quite unfairly drubbed by the critics upon its release and ignored by film audiences for the likes of X2. Matrix 2 and HULK was this entertaining action movie that slipped in and out of theaters almost unnoticed in the summer of 2003.

Taking its basis from the well known graphic novel of the same name this movie has a fascinating premise. What if the characters of Victorian literature were actually real people? What if technology that we take for granted now was suddenly thrust upon a world before their time. Thus, we have a bank robbery at the turn of the 20th century involving a tank. Machine gun toting villains tearing up an African country club. An automobile chasing through the streets of Europe and Jules Verne's Capt. Nemo (this time portrayed correctly as an Indian prince as he was in the novel) transporting our team of heroes in the submarine Nautilus.

Leading the group though is H. Rider Haggard's adventurer Allan Quatermain  (played with spirit and gusto by Sean Connery). Also included among the ragtag group are the likes of the Invisible Man, Tom Sawyer (an addition to the cast of characters no doubt in an effort to help the movie sell to an American audience) and Dorian Gray.

The team must race across the continent of Europe in an effort to defuse what is fast turning into a growing conflict between the Great Powers. The villain (the Fantom) has designs on making a boatload of money selling high-tech weapons (by 19th century standards) to the competing nations - or is he...there is a surprising twist to the story that eluded me until I checked out the special features.

The narrative to this movie does seem a little muddled and at times it all appears a little too top-heavy with heroes. But if you take LXG (as it was called by Fox marketing) as a fun loving light hearted action adventure, and don't try and think it through too hard, then the movie can promise an entertaining evening.

No it isn't Citizen Kane (Moore's comic wasn't either) but it's terribly watchable and fun and that makes it hard for me not to like it. Don't take it seriously just grab some snacks and settle back and it's a real joy.,1098316800,3,668,4.1461538461538465
1480710,2,B00005JM5B,"One of those films where the inspiration was better than the execution.  THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN has top-notch action, special effects, and overall production values. However, it doesn't gel.  TLOEG is based on a comic book miniseries by award winning novelist and comic book writer Alan Moore and it translates better in the comic book. Moore took homage to DC Comics' team books in which their stable of characters (i.e. Superman, Batman, Flash, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern. etc) are put into one comic book in titles such as JUSTICE SOCIETY OF AMERICA and JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA; the characters share in on one adventure each month in the comic book.  In TLOEG famous literary characters are put into one adventure to save the world  (Allan Quatermain, Mina Harker, Tom Sawyer, Dorian Grey, Captain Nemo, The Invisible Man, Dr. Henry Jekyll/Edward Hyde). The film however takes its style of direction from the Jerry Bruckheimer school of moviemaking which is loud, 'in-your-face', and chaotic.  The film is reminiscent of the recent film ARMAGEDDON.  Sean Connery is a presence in everything he does and fares quite well as Allan Quatermain, and the standout character here is definitely Captain Nemo played by Naseeruddin Shah.  Peta Wilson as Mina Harker is another in a long list of unneeded vampire characters that have been flooding the movie market these days.  The 'Hyde' character is a parody upon itself looking like THE INCREDIBLE HULK (HULK was created by Stan Lee to be a cross between Frankenstein and Mr. Hyde in the first place). Lastly, the plot twists involving some of the characters' motives  (i.e. 'M', Dorian Grey, and The Invisible Man)  were not surprising, inventive, or justified. They were suddenly turned into bad guys just so the 'good' characters would have someone to fight with.  Overall, another failure of translating a comic-book into film and had the film been successful, the ending was set up for a sequel...Its not going to happen.  Note: It was reported that Sean Connery had a choice to do this film or to do LORD OF THE RINGS.  He chose TLOEG because he understood the material for the film, but did not understand 'RINGS'.",1098230400,2,2184,4.983471074380165
1480711,5,B00005JM5B,"Yes, this movie did poorly at the box office.  No, it is not a stinker.  This is one of the best movies I've ever had the pleasure to see [and this is coming from a fan of the comic books].  What truly seperates this movie from the rest is how it spent it's budget.  Rather than buying the greatest CGI effect and using them to death, they instead hire a great cast and crew along with well done props.  Another spectacular thing about this film is the directing.  Rather than givng you chaotic action sequences and horrible puns, they use one cut action scenes and actual focus on the plot.  Naturally Sean Connery is the star but you have some other great actors including Shane West as Secret agent Tom Sawyer [yes secret agent Sawyer].  In the movie Alan Quartermain [Sean Connery] leads a band of heroes from victorian novels [including Mr. Hyde, Captain Nemo and Mina Murray] against a villan named ""Fantom"" [yes that's how it's spelled] to prevent a world war.  This plot is not only easy to understand but is actually enjoying to watch.  However, what truly makes this movie spectacular is that instead of trying to use the plot from the comic books they come up with their own.  Of course not everyone is going to enjoy this movie.  There are some problems like how can there be machine guns and submarines in 1899.  However, I think this may be getting a little picky.  Overall, I thought this was a great film and I think other films should learn from this one.",1098144000,7,1472,4.484962406015038
1480712,4,B00005JM5B,When I started watching this flick I thought the only thing it had going for it was Sean Connery playing Alan Quartermain.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  This movie brings together a delightful cast of characters and personalities along with pretty decent special effects.  The plot isn't all that deep but as far as superhero movies go it is great.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys superhero and action movies.  If you don't fit that category you might want to stay away.,1097971200,4,501,4.712643678160919
1480713,3,B00005JM5B,"I have to admit, I was prepared to not like (OK, hate) The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. The commercials looked lame and centered on Sean Connery's Schwarzeneggerian bon mots and special effects. Even the title, later acronymed to ""LXG"", cried out poseur.

When Connery's Alan Quartermain boasted ""I'm waiting to be impressed"" during the exposition I was sure I had my opening line for this review. Perhaps it was my low expectations, or maybe some unexpectedly decent filmmaking (or, to quote Grandpa Simpson, it was possibly ""a little from column A, a little from column B""), but I kind of liked this movie.

Although it is based on comics deity Alan Moore's book of the same name, the story is sort of screwy at points. And the plot hole involving (no pun intended) the Invisible Man's disappearance was deeper than the Chunnel. But, having checked my disbelief at the door, I sat back on my old blue plaid sofa and enjoyed 110 minutes of goofy fun.

It is 1899 and a crazed mask-clad villain is wreaking havoc in Europe. Quartermain is asked by the English government to lead a group of odd heroes to save the day.

Odd indeed. Dorain Gray, The Invisible Man, Mina Harker, Captain Nemo, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde and Tom Sawyer all join forces to foil The Phantom's plot.

It turns out in the end that The Phantom, later revealed as Holmes' archenemy Dr. Moriarty, was the very person that had assembled the League for his own nefarious purposes.

Pretty standard superhero stuff, but the look of the film is really what elevates the material. The design of Nemo's Nautilus is stunning. Every time it was on screen I found myself marveling at it. The costumes were wonderful too. I especially liked The Invisible Man's somewhat pointy hat.

The special effects are also very nice. The Invisible Man's face painting was a wonder, and the flashy jump cut transformations back and forth between Jekyll and Hyde were simple but elegantly effective.

Even some of the trite writing eventually appealed to me. Nemo's first mate introduces himself to the group by asking them to ""call me Ishmael."" How fun is that?!

I think perhaps this is one of the first movies I've seen wherein the art direction takes such a load off the rest of the film. And somehow that was enough for me.

The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen isn't a great movie. It isn't even a great superhero film. But as an excuse for filling the cracks of that old blue plaid sofa with more of Jiffy Pop's slightly sweet kettle corn, it performs extraordinarily.",1097625600,4,2524,4.742009132420091

These type of magazines featured short stories and serialised tales that kept readers on the edge of their seat from issue to issue. In time the glorious Pulp era followed and ultimately the birth of the Comic Book and the Cliffhanger Serial.

Now we have LXG. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen takes a modern ""comic book movie"" approach to what are now legendary literary characters and throws in elements of an old fashioned cliffhanger too. The result is a good deal of fun if you get it. I'm not sure how many people will.

Who did they make this movie for? How many modern movie goers did they really think would appreciate something like this? Somebody thought it'd be a hit. Does that guy still have a job? And how can I get in touch with him to say thanks?

LXG is a good movie for those who appreciate the history of comics, love old school comics, and are fans of the literary roots that gave birth to them.

I gobbled up books in which Sherlock Holmes fought Dracula, Watson encounterd Fu Manchu, and Holmes helped rid the planet of the Martians from War of the Worlds! It was a treat when my favorite literary characters came together and that's how I feel about League.

1480763,4,B00005JM5B,"LXG has been playing a lot on cable and I find myself liking it more and more with each viewing. I've noticed complaints about the film characters being different from the original characters and yet the same can be said of the comic. The movie presents literary characters that have been tweaked a little to engage young viewers and entertain modern audiences. Moore tweaked the characters too. He put rape and opium and such into the mix to make it more edgy. You can't fault the movie for it's changes and not fault the comic for it's changes. Some say they like the comic more because it played down Mina's vampire traits. It also had Hyde rip people into bloody shreds (he never did that in the original book) and the Invisible Man rape women (that's not in the original book either). I'm a fan of Mina and liked seeing her be more assertive and use her vampire powers. I didn't miss the Invisible Man's rapist actions or the more bloody version of Hyde that was presented in the comic. The movie restores many of the things that I loved about the original stories. It drops the opium addiction of Quatermain that wasn't part of the original character since it was Moore who made Quatermain a drug using coward and not Haggard. The film thus goes back to the original version of Quatermain and hits closer to the original mark even when it tweaks things to appeal to modern movie audiences. Mina is more assertive and a little more like Stoker's vampire brides of Dracula in the movie. I liked that. Quatermain is more like Haggard's creation. That's the way it should be. I've loved Dorian for years and it's great to see him aboard too. I was less happy about Tom Sawyer being added when I first hear about it. Once I saw the film and got past the problem with Tom being younger than he should be (Im trying not to sound like a continuity obsessed Trekkie) he won me over. The ""father and son"" relationship he had with Quatermain worked well and the young guy dynamic really brought something to the team. I hope LXG turns newbies on to these great characters and entertains other older fans like myself who have always wanted to see a movie like this.",1095033600,3,2159,4.510204081632653

I've never seen the comic so I can't comment on how well it measures up to that, but I thought the literary references alone made the movie worth watching again. And the 'feel' of the movie was similar to the atmosphere created in Van Helsing, to the point that you could almost wonder if both movies were existing in the same 19th century fantasy universe. (It also didn't hurt that M and V.H.'s Dracula are played by the same actor.)

On a side note for other parents:  My 12 year old watched this movie with me, and once he realized all the characters (and many of the apparently casual side references made by them) were related to books he started asking for more information.  Even after the movie was over we were still discussing books and authors he'd never shown interest in before, in spite of the fact that we *own* most of the books!  I can handle the multiple explosions, the inconsistencies, and the fact that Sean Connery was sitting out in the middle of a frigid wasteland with no gloves on - my son is excited about reading Verne and Stoker and Stevenson now, we can tack on a discussion of cold-weather gear and frostbite the *next* time we watch the movie.",1094256000,4,1360,4.449799196787149

What a premise. ""Superhero's"" of 1899.  It was a great movie.

What imagination and special effects. It did take me a bit to figure out that Special agent Sawyer was Tom Sawyer but that was part of its charm.

I loved the character developement and the togetherness that goes on through the film. It was quite different from any other picture I've seen.

If you've read anything about this, you know the premise: a number of characters from Victorian fantastic fiction team up to fight a villian trying to start the first World War. Sean Connery is excellent as always, the rest of the cast is definitely competent. But the real star of this movie (and any movie like it) is the action, which is pretty much non-stop from the very beginning.

I also found the behind-the-scenes documentary to be rather interesting. In an age when most SFX are CGI, it was nice to see the crew making things ""real.""

1480768,1,B00005JM5B,"If you've ever wondered if a car (the first car invented, might I add) could drive faster than an explosion, then this movie's for you.  Anyone smarter will detest this horrible schlock.  This movie is yet another example of hollywood attempting to cash in on a trend.  In Alan Moore's comic, it is obvious that he has painstakingly researched the literature he draws from.  This is especially evident in the travellogue at the end of book two, done much in the victorian style that such publications were orignially written in.  This movie, however, has no indication of such care.  Characters are thrown in randomly, including Dorian Gray and Tom Sawyer.  These characters are offensively different from the characters they were based on, and Tom feels as if he were only thrown in so that American audiences would have someone to relate to (because they don't trust us to figure it out for ourselves).  Other reviewers obviously have not read the source material, else they would know that (for example) Nemo WAS, in fact, a swashbuckling Indian man.  While it is true that Moore was not entirely faithful in his adaptations of literary characters to his own means, it is obvious that he did so with love, care, and respect.  The comic is not, and was not meant to be a high paced action adventure thriller.  It is quieter, softer spoken, and while it does contain thriller elements, it is much more of a spy story.  The addition of Mina's vampiric powers detracts highly from the story, as one of the most attractive elements of the comic is that this team is NOT all powerful.  Hyde is the heavy hitter and the invisible man is their stealth, but that's it.  They're human.  Would you give Batman superpowers? No, because it defeats the point of the character.  (Well, actually there is an elseworlds where he gets Green Lantern's ring, but it is poorly executed) He is human.  When the League gains vampiric strength, it takes away from their strategic prowess.  Why sneak into a place if you can simply burst in and clean up?  Anyway, I digress.  If you want a bad movie, with poor dialogue, bad special effects (I don't care what other people think, they were bad), and an irredeamable disrespect for its source material (both the comic and the original literature) then this is right up your alley.

Don't believe the negative reviews you have read here..this movie is everything the ""critics"" will despise, and it should be..My fondest memories of seeing the big screen with my parents was being lost in the escapism that a movie such as ""League"" portrays, whether for 2 hours or for 3..I haven't quite understood many of the reviewers on here who are trying to figure out why they didn't like this movie..who the heck cares?
My 10 year old son and my 2 year old son(who watched it for the first time this past weekend) were glued to the screen for its duration and me, well, I enjoyed it more the second time around.
It doesn't take a lot of sense to understand why or how this movie was made, so please don't over-analyze it..we have enough of this in the world today.. The premise is simple: literary fictional characters are called together for a common cause and the fate of the world lies at hand. The characters are actually believable and you feel like they were real at one time in history.. Sean Connery as Alan Quartermain was a pleasure as was the actor who played Dorian Grey(I am unsure of his name)..Combine these with the Invisible Man, Tom Sawyer, Mina Harker(who plays the part perfectly as a seductive vampiress), Captain Nemo, and Dr. Jekyll (and yes, you won't believe it when you see Mr. Hyde..) and you have one perfect team of heroes battling the Phantom, who is also shrouded in mystery..
This movie has something for all who view it: astounding special
effects, stellar acting, and most of all, characters that recall the days of my youth when I wanted to believe that heroes like this actually existed..
Forget the ones who are trying to compare this to an X-men movie, (which I also have developed much respect and liking for..)

1480785,4,B00005JM5B,"LXG is of a genre known as ""steam punk"". It's also part of the literary legacy of authors like the great Philip Jose Farmer. Farmer gave us a world where various literary characters and phenomena coexist. To appreciate LXG you first have to accept the film on it's own terms. LXG is a fun steam punk story that carries on the tradition of Farmer in which various literary characters unite to battle the super scientific Fantom. Fun indeed!
Unfortunately, critics often attack this movie for lacking imagination while demonstrating their lack of imagination by being incapable, or unwilling, to grasp the premise and ideas of LXG. They like to point out that in our real historic world there were no vampires, no invisible men, no machine gun rifles, no immortals, no monsters, no modern cars, no Nautilus type submarines, etcetera. I agree with them that these things didn't exist in our real historic world, but this is a work of fiction. It's true that vampires did not exist in our real historic world, but that didn't stop Bram Stoker. Invisible men did not exist in our real historic world, but that didn't stop Wells. Nautilus style submarines didn't exist in our real historic world, but that didn't stop Verne. There was no Fantom with soldiers with machine guns, but once again this is fiction. Many critics just can't muster enough imagination to accept these things in a movie and then they claim that the film lacks imagination. It's the lack of imagination on the part of some critics that is obvious to me.
I have more than enough imagination to accept these characters all existing in one adventure (I thought of this often while reading about these characters when I was a girl) and I can accept the Fantom and his modern tech too (it's steam punk and modern tech is supposed to exist in the past in steam punk). LXG is a continuation of the ideas put forth by Philip Jose Farmer decades ago and literary characters are supposed to coexist in that scenario so I have no problem with these things. I also have no problem with characters not being completely shocked by the guns used by the Fantom's cronies when they live in a world of monsters,invisble men and magical immortals. I don't think it would have been a good idea for Dorian Gray to say something like ""I'm immortal thanks to supernatural magical powers, but I just can't believe rapid firing guns!"" or for Mina to say ""I'm an undead immortal who can turn into bats and who associates with an invisble man, but the concept of an impressive automobile blows my mind!"". I think the characters were fine just the way they were portrayed in the film. I do, however, have a tough time with criticisms of Nemo being a ""Raja"" or Mina going out into sunlight. These types of things just show that those who are so quick to judge this film never paid attenton to Verne or Stoker.
There are some campy/comic book/B-movie bits in LXG and the inclusion of Tom Sawyer was an unusual move(he wasn't in the graphic novel), but those are my only ""complaints"". The relationship between Quatermain (who lost his son) and Sawyer was done very well and I'm glad Tom came along for the adventure. LXG isn't perfect, but its far from the film that many negative critics try to paint it as. It asks you to accept the idea that the worlds created by various great authors are one and the same. Do you want to see an adventure that unites the worlds and characters of Haggard, Doyle, Wilde, Verne, Stoker, Twain, Stevenson, and Wells? Check out LXG and bring your imagination along for the ride. I grew up on all these works and characters and found this movie to be highly entertaining.",1092873600,3,3639,4.634674922600619
1480786,1,B00005JM5B,"A completely laughable film that's more enjoyable to watch on mute than seeing its idiotic plot unfold with an utterly pathetic script: the latter being nothing more than extraordinary bulls***!

Are you ready to suspend disbelief?  Here we go!  The year is 1898 and a sinister scheme is afoot to get the Germans at war with England.  Although the horseless carriage was still a novelty back then, our heroes drive off in a futuristic limo and don't seem the least surprised by the technology (e.g. alternator, distributor, fuel injection, etc.); although not even the BAR or Thompson Automatic had been invented at that time, the antagonists are armed with assault rifles and no one seems one seems the least perplexed. The most absurd part is Captain Nemos' cruiseship-sized submarine gliding through Venice's canals that can't be more than 20' deep (an absurdity in and of itself) with less wake than a rowboat. Some reviewers have praised the film for Nemo's depiction as a Hindu but Jules Verne never specifically mentions Nemo's ethnicity other than vaguely defining him as an Indo-European who is not from Northern Europe.  He could have been Spanish, Italian, Greek, Turkish, or Hindu: who knows! He certainly was never described as having worn a turban on his head as shown in the film. Dr. Jekyll's Mr. Hyde is more like the Incredible Hulk than simply his psychotic alter-ego; and, the most absurd part is a 20-year old Tom Sawyer who, in 1898, would probably be at least 45 years of age.  Don't bother looking for an engaging or even coherent plot in this film because there simply isn't one.  Finally, as if that weren't enough, there's no acting to praise because they're really just reading the script as they go along with this farce of a movie.

Although I respect the use of fantasy in film such as in Conan, Lord of the Rings, etc., the juxtaposition of history and characters in this film is just too idiotic.  It demonstrates more a lack of imagination on the part of those who prepared this screenplay; instead of coming up with any interesting characters of their own, they hastily and clumsily cut and pasted a collage of cultural/historical icons and turned them into pure fantasy (contrived fantasy at that.)  I have more respect for the traditional characters from Marvel comics or others who are just in an entirely imaginary society: at least Stan Lee and other comic writers used their own talents of imagination instead of borrowing someone else's.  Unless you're ages 10 or below, I would avoid renting or watching this movie at all costs.",1092787200,6,2571,4.860411899313501

I thought oh another great Sean Connery movie. I was wrong. This is a piece of garbage. The plot is way to predictable. The special effects are just mediocre. It reminded me of Indiana Jones except way too fictional and not nearly as good of acting or special effects. Whoever wrote the story for this movie just took ideas from Dracula, Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde, and whole bunch of other stories and tried to put them togeather and made the worst movie of all time. A good piece of advice to whoever wrote this, you should really write something original since you can't tell stories right.

1480790,4,B00005JM5B,"Being a fan of the graphic novels I was not really eager to watch this film, scared about how badly they would wreck it.  But in the end it was a delight.  I enjoyed how they brought in each character, how they set up the plot, how they carefully set up the foundation to make it easy to move right into the action and adventure of the latter parts of the film.

I wish they had kept some of the deleted scenes in the film, because some of them were important, linking one scene to another, but in the end the film was a good one.  The extras in the DVD, from the behind-the-scenes documentary and audio commentaries, really add to the DVD.

Something to add to your DVD library if you are a fan of the old novels, with such super-stars like the great white hunter, Allan Quatermain, the sub captain, Captain Nemo, and that great scientist, Dr. Henry Jekyll.

If you enjoyed this movie, remember that the graphic novels are available.  The movie is based on the first volume, but there are TWO out at the time of this review.  Great books.

Verne's Nemo hated war. He made the ocean his nation and destroyed war ships. Would he battle The Fantom who wants to plunge the world into war as he does in LXG. I think so. Would he team up with other extraordinary characters to defeat The Fantom even if he had to deal with the Brits to do it? I think so. All of the actors are great although the one playing Nemo is the most on target. LXG is a fun movie.,1091059200,2,585,4.2792792792792795
1480792,3,B00005JM5B,"First of all, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a B movie.  If you can enjoy the campiness of B movies, you'll enjoy this.  On the good side,m we get to see a lot of Victorian era heros and villians.  Everyone wants to know what would have happen if these great characters had met.  Also, some of the action sequences are interesting.

On the other hand, there are a lot of weak points.  There are so many characters, so the character development is superficial.  You get the feeling that the actors don't get along well because there is no warmth between the characters.  The characters become cardboard cutouts which just stand around delivering wooden lines.  Also the effects are cheesy at times.  For example, if you look closely at Hyde, you can see that he is just wearing a rubber suit.

For me the biggest downfall is the inconsistency between this story and the original novels.  I'm a big fan of Nemo, so when I saw him walking around on land, and even worse, working for the Bristish Empire, his sworn enemy, it was just a little too far from the original character.  To see that proud freedom fighter as a lap dog of the British Empire was just too much for me to enjoy this movie fully.  I'm sure that fans of some of the other characters had similar experiences.

Overall, this is a mediocre B movie.  If you can suspend you disbelief and enjoy making fun of wooden dialog and acting, then this is for you.  If not, avoid this.",1090972800,,1449,4.469465648854962
1480829,3,B00005JM5B,"No matter how many average, weird, or downright awful movies Sean Connery makes, he'll always command an audience. In this film, Connery plays a retired British explorer roped into preventing WW I by leading a team of misfits in a vaguely Bondian adventurer. As a nice twist, most of the misfits consist of 19th Century British villains such as Mr. Hyde, the Invisible Man, and Captain Nemo. Of course, no one bothers to explain why such villains would agree to unite for any cause other than, well, villainy. The film is comic book-y in a bad way, with ridiculous dialogue and a poor sense of continuity, and the effects are frequently unintentionally funny, especially Mr. Hyde's appearance. Connery makes the film work as a throwaway action film, but it's clear from the extras that the cast and some of the crew were deluded into thinking this was something more. Not surprisingly, this movie plays much better on DVD than it did in the theaters. If you're a die-hard Connery fan, you'll like this one.

1480833,3,B00005JM5B,"I don't think that this movie is as bad as a lot of people have said, it didn't fulfill its potential, but it wasn't bad.  The main problems were it was a hard genre to get across.  It is known as ""steam punk"", a spin off of the cyber punk genre.  Where they are using high tech items, but with technology present in their age.  Examples of this are the short lived series The Secret Adventures of Jules Vern, the movie Wild Wild West, and the Deadlands game.  They had to explain a lot of this in the movie since the average movie goer wouldn't get it.
A lot of the weapons they use are way beyond what they would have used in that era, and they aren't what they were.  The body armor is heavy metal plates designed to stop bullets, the guns are heavy brass weapons, the power suits and clunky and slow moving.  But from 20-50 years ahead of their time.
The characters they use are for the most part well depicted from their source material.  Alan Quartermain is a bitter sexist old man who is regretful of his past and the British Empire.  Mina Harker is distant and fighting with her supernatural nature.  Dr Jekyl is repressed and tired of fighting with Mr Hyde.  Mr Hyde is brutal and thuggish, but brillant.  Captain Nemo is still searching for meaning having abandoned both India and Britain.  Dorian Grey is decadent and bored, nothing can cause him worry, he's effectively immortal.  The only character that doesn't seem to fit is Tom Sawyer, who was added to give the group an American pull, but fits as a surrogate son for Quartermain.  As well as the ""invisible man"", who they had to change.  Due to some legal conflicts they couldn't use the name Hawley Griffinm, so created a believable character, a thief who'd stolen the formula.
All in all this is a good movie with a few flaws.  The plot was interesting and thought provoking.  The characters seemed like they were the broken down villians from the previous books.  All of them for the most part tired of their lives, and looking for some sort of meaning in their existence outside of society.
The bad guys are rates as being dull, but at the same time they are realistic.  I do admit, I would have preferred and over the top villian, but sometimes a straight one adds to a movie.  Like Robert Carlyle in ""the World is Not Enough"".
The plot is interesting, the possible world war that could happen 20 years before its time, this time with deadlier weapons.  As well as some of the twists that happen along the way.
I wouldn't say that this is for everyone, more for the sci fi fan or history buff.  But it was good as an action flick and as a sci fi potential.  But think it could have been better.  The good elements were great, but were felt a bit stifled.  The characters were a lot more pc in this version than they were in the graphic novel it was based off of.  Alan Quartermain was an opium addict, Mr Hyde was killing prostitutes in France, the Invisible Man was impregnating women in a girls school making it look like divine conception, etc....  This would have cut the budget though, as most producers would want to keep the audience as open as possible, unfortunate for the fans of the genre. But not a bad movie, not a great movie, and a fascinating genre.",1088121600,4,3237,4.413153456998313

The only thing I didn't care about in the film was the guy who drank all the Hyde Potion and turned into that huge disgusting monster. But the highlights of the film were the scenes with Richard Roxburgh. That man can truly act, he gets your attention. He is also good at dialect, for instance, when he was the Phantom he spoke with a German accent, when he was 'M' he spoke with a very proper British accent, then at the end when he was Moriarty it was more like a kind of cockney or maybe it was just a strong Austrailian accent (knowing him being from Austraila). He did his scenes well, though there were too few of them. That stupid Tom Sawyer shouldn't have killed him. Although, I've heard that in the Sherlock Holmes novels they can't seem to kill Moriarty. So, I think they should make a sequel to this movie and have Moriarty (being that he was just faking death, and again being portrayed by the great Richard Roxburgh) come back and kill Tom Sawyer.

I am a big fan of Sean Connery, and so took a gamble. The pay-off was worth the risk. Not only does this film incorporate some of my most favorite literary characters, but with today's technology, brought them to life like only my imagination could have in the past.
Who cares about the foolish plot... this is a showcase for our outlandish and caricatures of literary hyperbole. Dr. Jeckyl has never been protrayed thusly. And Mina, our lovely wife of the vampire hunter who has evolved more than anyone imagined.

1480882,2,B00005JM5B,"LXG suffers from too much money spent on too many special effects for too many ridiculous action sequences and poorly conceptualized characters.
Anyone at all familiar with the characters of Victorian literature who stock our team of heroes will quickly realize that there are serious issues of continuity and plain old believability.
The Jeckyl & Hyde character is more an Incredible Hulk than a ""dark side of humanity"" figure that one finds in the novel by Stevenson.  Incredibly enough, Hyde has found a number of haberdashers in the London area to provide clothes that fit his monstrous frame(I guess he can restrain his rage long enough for a fitting).
And if it is 1899, Tom Sawyer would be a middle-aged southerner, not a fresh-faced twentysomething cowboy (Twain's books were set circa 1850, before the American Civil War).
Similar problems arise for all the Extraordinary Gentlemen (what's with the turbaned Nemo?)who are then thrown into a ridiculous plot concerning an attempt to engineer war among the European powers.  This itself is unbelievable (have your henchman commit crimes in England dressed as German stormtroopers -- ooh, that will fool those stupid Brits!) as almost anyone with half a brain knows that international diplomacy simply does not operate in a manner that has wars erupt over robberies.  Even assasinations (such as the one that prompted the First World War) have to occur within a fairly rarefied set of circumstances to set off global conflicts.
The action sequences themselves are hard to follow.  I wasn't entirely sure what was happening in the Venice episode, other than the historic quarter of that city and the number of multi-story buildings certainly seems to be considerably larger than when I was there (a hundred years after this movie is set!)
Any of the character-building scenes seem to be transparently so.  The Quartermain character has a less than touching scene with Tom Sawyer wherein the African adventurer comes to see young Tom as a replacement for the son he lost.  Boy, this kind of schmaltz runs right through the movie any time the characters are given time for development (you don't always need dialogue to communicate inner motivation and depth).
It's a shame the producers (of whom Connery is apparently one) didn't rent the Guns of Navarone to see how you do an action film with an ensemble cast.",1083369600,,2365,5.035805626598465

Great casting, great special effects.  The film is based on a comic book which tries to combine all the major fantastical fictional literary figures of the books in the late 1800s.  It includes characters from Dracula, Dr. Jeykll & Mr. Hyde, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, The Picture of Dorian Gray, etc.  The other characters were Captain Nemo, and a British big-game hunter living in Africa who is supposedly invincible, played by Sean Connery.  I hadn't read all of these books and so throughout the whole movie I always felt like I was missing something.  They don't quite tie things in together very well and you keep waiting for a more full explaination.  Thanks to the great literary giants of the past we were able to enjoy a facinating array of characters - Although I felt they were very untrue to Bram Stoker's portrayal of Mina Harker.

1480899,4,B00005JM5B,"The idea is a very good one.  Allan Quatermain; the greatest hunter who ever lived, leads a team of unique individuals to try to prevent global war.  They're certainly interesting people, too.  An invisible man, Captain Nemo, Henry Jeckel and Edward Hyde, Mina Harker, Dorian Grey, Tom Sawyer...
As I look at the roster, I can't help but wonder how it could have been any better.  After all, using Sherlock Holmes might have overshadowed the other characters.
The movie itself has excellent special effects, superb acting and scriptwriting that is some of the best I've ever seen (we're talking Star Trek; The Next Generation quality.)  The characters are right on the money in both attitude and dialogue and if you're familiar with more than one of them, you're going to find this film to be a real treat.
Sean Connery (the big name of this movie) is an over-the-hill actor, so it makes sense that he play the role of an over-the-hill hero.  This he pulls off most admirably.  The others are just as good at acting, though somewhat less renowned for it.  Furthermore, the action is not constant, but considerable enough to be a real rush nonetheless, and wherever there isn't action, there's character-interactions that are truly awesome.
There were only a few things I could spot in this movie that could have been done better.  First, the main bad guy didn't get to use enough of his remarkable skills.  Secondly, when the main bad guy first appeared, his general attitude seemed almost mockingly cheesy, which I suppose was his intention.  Lastly, the character of the invisible man wasn't the original, like in the comic, and to be honest, I wish he had been.  The name ""Griffin"" just seems to belong with the Invisible Man, though to be fair, they did a decent job making Rodney Skinner act roughly like him.
As I said, I can't see why people don't like this movie.  I actually thought it was, in most ways, better than the comic, and I've seen it four times already, on the big and small screens.  If you're a literature buff, this is a movie for you.  If you don't like the characters, you might not get as much out of the movie, but you should still enjoy it.  If you're a hardcore comic fan, you might not enjoy the movie at all just because it's different from the comic, but remember; the comic took a lot of liberties that this movie actually hit closer to the mark on.  That's my thoughts on the movie, and I hope it compells you to at least RENT it, if not get it.",1081900800,,2479,4.5598194130925505
1480900,5,B00005JM5B,"Some critics of this film claim that by being true to Bram Stoker and having a vampire out in daylight it is the ""most striking"" example of ""liberties"" taken with these literary characters. Where is the logic in that? If it's true to the source material then it isn't a liberty taken with the source material. If Stoker wanted his vampires in the day, as other mythic vampires often were, why is it viewed as an error when it's portrayed that way on film? Stoker wrote of vampires out in daylight and LXG gives us that, but this is claimed to be the ""most striking"" error. Where is the error? If the critics wanted Mina to be more like modern cinematic vampires they must like the scenes of that type right? Nope. I'm not sure what standard is being used, but even Stoker isn't right according to them. It's also a complaint that having human blood have a reflection in Mina's mirror is an error. Why?

1480902,3,B00005JM5B,"""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" is a decent flick.  It seems somewhat crammed together and I agree with other reviewers that some of the characters seemed forced on the viewer.  Connery does a good job here, but I think that he could have done much better with a stronger script and a better supporting cast.  The Invisible Man is likeable, and Dorian Gray is one of the better nasties I've seen in awhile.  Peta Wilson as Mina Harker doesn't add up for some reason.  There are a lot of holes in her character and while I'll look beyond the fact that she could walk around in daylight, I can't get over the feeling that the character is just a jumble of stereotypical heroines.  Jekyll/Hyde was pretty good, but his character didn't seem to belong here.  It's almost as if he was thrown in so that there would be a big guy in the group.  Tom Sawyer was useless in this flick, excepting that he replaces Quartermain's deceased son.  Captain Nemo was stale.  His character never really caught my attention.
Even though I'm throwing out a lot of negatives, this story is action-packed.  It moves at a breakneck pace and leaves you little time to catch your breath.  As far as visuals go, this movie is tops.  But that might be the biggest problem.  Too much time seems to have been spent on impressing the audience with special effects instead of story development.  Sadly, that has become commonplace in today's action yarns.
Overall, this movie is okay.  It isn't too great, but you won't feel that cheated of your time after watching it.  It's no-brainer visual fun.  If you want a better period action piece, watch ""The Mummy.""  The story and acting are much better.",1081123200,,1675,4.636054421768708

When an international terrorist attacks the UK and Germany using new inventions (the tank and the rocket propeller grenade), a group of extraordinary individuals are assembled to track him down. They travel in captain Nemo's submarine.
The special effects are good, the acting more than adequate (Sean Connery is Allan Quartermain). The scenery is evocative, especially the vision of hell in Moriarty's armoury.

A war has broken out during 1899? and the man behind it is a villian who calls himself ""the Fantom"" who really does all the worst acting of the film! His entrance was as bad as the whole plot of ""mortal kombat anhiahalation"" and his acting is near enough to fit into that movie! However, Sean Connery is a famous hunter by the name of ""Allan Quatermain"" who is asked to join a leage that is set to be like no other.

I guess because it didn't take itself seriously and I didn't either
while it will ever be debated ""Nay"" or ""Yay"" over dialogue and over

high for movie of this magnitude.

tanks & other new weapons are causing episodes of destruction while

transformation alone did it for me. We're not talking ""Masterpiece

1480976,2,B00005JM5B,"Alan Moore is a genius, but this film doesn't capture that - instead it captures all the childish flaws of the comics story-process and magnifies them until they're unforgiveable.
First, the enchanting feminine allure of Peta Wilson is thown away when she rips into a guy's neck and gets splashed with his severed artery.  So there's no sexual tension at all - she's just a monster in the shape of a woman.
There's something about using the buildings of Venice as dominoes.. Something unbelievable.. Or is it just ridiculous?
Then there's Connery, who is not a deep enough thinker to make gold out of this wooden, paint-by-numbers script.  He was phoning it in. I don't blame him - what else could he do?
This was to be a summer-weekend blockbuster but it sank without a trace last August - and deservedly so.  The plot is a pile of rickety Rube-Roldberg tricks and there's just nothing here to sustain interest - it's dead on arrival.  Stay Away.",1078790400,3,947,4.686746987951807
1480977,2,B00005JM5B,"To be honest LXG is probably the underdog because X-Men seems to have this summer blockbuster category filled and even though LXG tries very hard to be a contender it can go nowhere near really hitting on what X-Men has achieved and certainly Spider-man has nothing to worry about. So where does it rank? Well if you did not like The Hulk then you will find LXG a much more suitable superhero mash.
LXG has a few problems. Sean Connery is not exactly flaring across the screen and even though all the other superheroes are given enough screen time it is surprisingly a fairly wooden affair with not much fleshed out in the way of their backgrounds even though quite a bit is hinted at. So really our dependence in engaging these characters is with their action quality. We would expect LXG to have lots in that department, but sadly what action there is just turns out to be a ""been there before and bought the T-shirt"" except for one good action sequence in Venice which is quite frankly a little bit hard to follow or understand and never really amounts to much. So the action is a way below par, especially if you have seen the likes of Blade from the same director - Stephen Norrington.
Where LXG really stands out is in the design and the concept realized onto the screen looks simply amazing. It is like Batman crossed with Wild Wild West. In fact Wild Wild West is exactly the same kind of summer bummer unblockbuster as this one. LXG looks incredible and certainly moves along at a good pace but ultimately it just as forgettable with nothing to really make you want to catch a sequel.
When all is said and done LXG is far from the worst DVD you can pick up for some pop-corn fodder entertainment but at the same time is pretty much an under-nourishing experience with some good scenes but not a great movie. The plot is a little banal and certainly the twists that come about are not really anything suspenseful. I somewhat enjoyed it enough to say that it was worth watching if there is nothing better on the shelf but I would not exactly be running to the cinema to see the sequel by any means.",1078704000,3,2105,4.441860465116279
1480978,3,B00005JM5B,"Theatrical adaptations of famous comic books are becoming the new trend these days in Hollywood. The major studios are digging out every comic book superhero imaginable even the lesser known ones and so far the films have been successful. So it isn?t surprising that 20th Century is stepping up to the plate for the third time this year. Daredevil was a moderate success garnering $100 million against a $75 million budget and X2: X-Men United kicked off the summer season with a bang gathering $210 million against a $100 million budget. Fox is hoping that The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen will be just as successful but it will be a hard sell. The League is a much lesser known comic book mini-series then big profiles superheroes like Spider-Man or X-Men, so there won?t be as big of a fan base to rely on. Another problem is the now blatant fact that not all comic-book adaptations take with movie-goers. Though The Hulk?s opening weekend became the highest grossing opening weekend ever for the month of June, the film itself was received poorly by both the critics and the general public and experienced a nearly seventy percent drop in its second weekend. Rumors of fights breaking out between Sean Connery and director Stephen Norrington helped generate bad buzz for the film. and the lackluster advertising campaign for the film have not helped in the studio?s efforts to create substantial buzz going for this feature.

The story centers on the formation of a team of extraordinary individuals that must fight an evil man who has plans for the world. During the year 1899, an evil individual by the name of The Fanthom has gone around the world capturing scientists and causes major catastrophes in order to have the European countries blame each other. This, he hopes, will cause the countries to create a world war and with his advanced military weapons, the European countries will have to buy from him creating a huge profit for himself. The British Empire, determined to avert a world war, calls upon a man named ?M? to assemble The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Allan Quartermain, the hero of such tales as King Solomon?s Mines, is chosen to lead the team. Other members of the team include Rodney Skinner (The Invisible Man), Mina Harker (Vampire), Captain Nemo, Dr. Jekyll, and Dorian Grey, each of which holds a special ability unique to the team. Joining along for the ride is Agent Sawyer (The Adventures of Tom Sawyer) from the United States. Each individual seems to have a hidden secret and don?t get along with each other but they must put their scrabbles aside in order to save the world from the brink of war. The story for The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen gets off to a good start and ends fairly well but sequences in between seem to drag the entire picture down, making it the entire experience seem worse then it actually was. The dialogue stays on the serious side which works for it but when it begins to slip into a more comical form, the quality of the picture is lost. Those not familiar with the famous literary characters involved in the film may be confused with the lack of background information given on many of them but perhaps that just means you need to bone up on your reading skills.

If you looking for extraordinary acting and premium star power, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is definitely not your film, but most people, those with a brain, will know that going into this film. Sean Connery lights up the screen in the role of Allan Quartermain and feels appropriately cast as a man who continues to do the job he has been doing for many years despite his increasing age. There were consistent rumors from the set that Connery and director Norrington were at each other?s necks throughout the shoot but there is no evidence to say those fights affected his performance from what is shown in the film. Tony Curran, who plays the role of The Invisible Man, does as best of a job as he can but this character has its share of problems. The Invisible Man seems to be nothing more then a comedic special effects diversion and seems to just plain disappear (no pun intended) for a good portion of the movie with no explanation as to why he left or how he came to a particular place. Jason Flemying does his best with the role of Dr. Jekyll, which is pretty good for the most part, but his character is also a special effect diversion when he becomes Mr. Hyde. Shane West is great as Agent Sawyer, though the film could have done a better job explaining how this care free boy from Mississippi came to be in the secret service but that is a minor squabble. Peta Wilson, who is best known from La Femme Nikita fame, does what she can with the role of Mina Harker but there are too many questions and not enough answers, a constant theme in this film. What is the deal with her and Dorian Grey? And speaking of Dorian Grey, Stuart Townsend is horribly miscast in this role and the character itself is predictable and uninteresting.

Overall, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen make come as a disappointment to the average moviegoer, one who isn?t a comic-book fanatic or literary wizard, but even for those select few who are this film may still be a little tough to swallow. Specific background information on many of the film?s primary characters is missing which leaves most of the audience struggling to figure out where they are coming from and how that helps play out the film?s ending. The League?s special effects are difficult to put on a scale based on the films offered thus far this year; on the one hand, they lack the superior quality present in Pirates of the Caribbean but on the other hand, they aren?t clunky as was present in The Hulk. What is certain is the scenes containing the repulsive Nautilus, Captain Nemo?s submarine, are the worst examples of computer animation presented this summer. The action sequences are the sufficient enough to keep the attention of movie-goers looking for some different for one night as opposed to seeing Pirates once again. It may not be fantastic, it may not even be mediocre to some, but it?s worth the price of admission ? for a matinee at least.",1078531200,,6173,4.687557603686636

This is one of those films that comes ""oh so close"" to being solid but falls short because it's not character-driven enough.  With such a solid cast, it's a shame that the various members of the ""league"" didn't get enough of a chance to develop.  I suppose the viewer is supposed to be well-versed enough in 19th and 20th Century literature to know all about these characters, but that's too much of a stretch for me.  Sean Connery is great as Alan Quartermain, but the others characters (The Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde, Dorian Gray, Captain Nemo, etc.) get little more than glorified cameos.
The movie is definitely ""heavy"" in computer generated effects.  Very realistic and convincing, but maybe a little too much over the top.  The decibel level from all of the gunfire, explosions, etc. will certainly give one's surround sound system a workout!  But don't get me wrong, the graphics ARE great, especially the depiction of Nemo's sub, The Nautilus!
The plot is rather tepid and the average viewer will probably come away scratching his or her head somewhat about certain parts of it, but keep in mind that in is ""comic book material"" in general.  Suspension of disbelief will be needed to enjoy the film!!
The movie is stylishly filmed and has some great scenery and locations.  It moves along at a rapid pace and there is very little down time in the film.  I'm choosing not to go into the plot in this review because too many earlier reviewers have done so.  The reader of this review can find out that information very quickly if so desired.  What I will say is that ""LXG"" is a fairly enjoyable 110 minutes.  If the viewer is a Sean Connery fan then by all means, rent or buy this DVD.  Viewers who enjoyed Spider Man, Daredevil, and the X-Men series will probably go for this type of action as well.

Qui si fa confusione tra Verne e Salgari passando per Melville e quindi il capitano Nemo di 20000 Leghe Sotto I Mari  vestito e si comporta come un attempato Sandokan, con tanto di spada usata come una vera scimitarra, il suo Nautilus  arredato come una Love Boat in salsa indiana ( grande come un grattacielo ma poi passeggia con disinvoltura tra i canali veneziani!!!) ed il primo ufficiale esordisce con un ""Chiamatemi Ismaele"" da reclamare punizioni corporali. Allo stesso modo forse gli autori pensano che Poe e Stevenson fossero lo stesso autore e quindi ci fanno sapere che era mr. Hide a compiere i delitti della Rue Morgue. Lo stesso Hide pi che il lato oscuro del dottor Jeckyll appare come un gommoso incredibile Hulk con la faccia di Adriano Celentano che zompetta sui tetti di Francia come un Quasimodo qualunque e mai nel film  davvero cattivo come dovrebbe. Il vertice del ridicolo si tocca con il super-Hide, una enorme bistecca al sangue che mena sventole, e con la ventilata ipotesi di resurrezione (sic!) di Connery / Quatermann. Dal momento che il film si apre e si chiude in Africa c' quasi da stupirsi che in questa incredibile montagna di fesserie non sia stato infilato anche Tarzan! Unico pregio: gli effetti speciali, davvero riusciti nel realizzare il viso a met dell'uomo invisibile... Non vi avevo detto che c'era anche lui??",1077408000,,2430,5.194373401534527

But if you're looking for a fun, comic book-like adventure film about literary characters teamed up like super-heros, LXG is the movie for you.  Alan Moore's comic book is brought to life with the likes of Alan Quartermain, Mina Harker (Dracula), Tom Sawyer, the Invisible Man, Capt. Nemo (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea), Dr. Jekyl & Mr. Hyde, and Dorian Gray, to make up the LXG.  Their job?  To save the world.

1480985,2,B00005JM5B,"I knew what I was getting into when I agreed to view LXG with a couple of my friends.  I'd heard all about the tumultuous relationship between Sean Connery and director Stephen Norrington, and how the latter was locked out of the editing room when the film was being cut.  The slate of negative reviews the film received upon release - along with the not-encouraging fact that LXG had very little to do with its source material, other than the title, character-molds and a few recognizable symbolic props - made me avoid the film during its brief summer duration.  And yet when my friend ChefGeno mentioned that he'd rented it, on the strength of Connery's legendary status, I couldn't resist sitting down for the bumpy, frustrating, occasionally amusing ride with these penny-rate geriatrics of a century-past.  How wrong could Hollywood do it? Would LXG break the barrier from just plain `bad' to MST3000 hilarious?
Considering the amount of times I smirked, chuckled, and shook my head in stunned disbelief, along with my rather bemused recollection of the whole experience the morning after, I'd say so.  For a film to reach that level of sublime incompetence, its intentions must be (somewhat) pure: the campy, convoluted result wholly unintentional from the original plan.  Then again, I'm not sure if Norrington, aware he had a stinker on his hands and that his development power would be taken away in the editing room, consciously decided to monkeywrench the film mid-way through - this being, IMO, the only logical reason behind some of LXG's creative decisions.
To clarify:
* Hyde: at first I thought of a man wearing really bad prosthetics.  Further inspection revealed it to be bad CGI pretending to be bad prosthetics.
* Connery's Alain Quartermain, a hero in his 70's, jumps out of a car speeding at 80 miles an hour, and lands quite soundly and comfortably on his feet.
* This same car manages to cruise through a good dozen stone columns without an apparent scratch or grumpy damage-snort; the passengers, exposed convertible-style, display a similar impervious nature to the rain of rubble/rain of gunfire.
* Alain Quartermain has never driven a car, but when handed the wheel, he steers perfectly...and somehow manages to maintain an accelerating speed.
* Upon sight of Nemo's Nautilus, my friend Dawn commented that it resembled a Chevy.
* Nemo's costume is extraordinarily cheap looking, as are the submarine sets.  Nemo doesn't look (or sound) very Indian, and his stunt double fight scenes are comically blaxploitation-obvious.
*The Invisible Man is able to survive high-mountain winter temperatures without wearing a shred of clothing, the only consequence of this action being a smarmy complaint about numb extremities.
* Tom Sawyer: his inclusion to the League is an excuse to have a father/son relationship with Quartermain.  This sort of clichd development doesn't tend to work, however, when it's left hanging after one scene.
* Stuart Townsend: master of the smirk.  I offer nightly prayers to the almighty, thanking all manner of heaven and earth that this fellow was fired from LotR . . . a preening Aragorn we need not *ever* see! (though the inclusion of Dorian Gray was an unexpected treat).
Connery's hand in the editing room is abundantly clear.  Certain transitions are unprofessionally rough.  Scenes progress with minimal information as to where the League is going, and why: the film moves along as quickly as possible, resulting in a loss of coherence.  Moments of conflict are often resolved speedily, without tangible logic.  The Venice Bombing scene stands out in particular - in the time-frame of mere seconds a plan is formulated and carried out henceforth, leaving the audience in the dust, scratching their heads and gaping at the sheer fantastical nonsense.
The DVD my friend rented had a scratch, forcing us to skip half of a chapter - though not without any real detriment to our viewing `pleasure' - which in itself is telling about how involving LXG is.  This ultimately saddens me, for the source material *could* have been adapted faithfully, complete with Moore's outstanding dialogue and O'Niell's fanciful designs, at a relatively low budget - the appeal of the illustrated LXG being, after all, more about the characters and peculiarities of the time-period, rather than the empty fury of a hundred guns blazing or any other flashy theatrics an SFX team might splatter upon the screen.
If *The Hulk,* with its Freudian angst and disturbing abuse subtext, alienated mainstream audiences from the hype-bubble of the comic-book film, then LXG served in bursting that fragile barrier wide open.  Yet in hindsight, I cannot say I regret watching this cinematic abortion of the first order.  LXG is awful, indeed, but at least it is _amusingly_ awful . . . and an honest chuckle at high-price floundering goes a long way in this day and age.",1077235200,2,4895,5.038366336633663

(USA/Germany/Czech Republic/UK - 2003)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)
Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS

Toward the end of the 19th century, Prof. Quatermain (Sean Connery) is recruited to lead a band of superheroes - each drawn from popular literature of the day, each blessed with distinctive powers - to defeat a monstrous villain who is plotting to take over the world.

Clearly riding the coat-tails of successful superhero movies like SPIDER-MAN, DAREDEVIL and X-MEN, Stephen Norrington's high-concept melodrama employs an 'all-star' cast of characters from 19th century fiction, reconfigured for 21st century audiences weaned on the likes of STAR WARS and the Superman mythos. Based on the celebrated graphic novel by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill, the film combines the Gothic splendor of Victorian 'penny dreadfuls' with the excesses of modern Hollywood, resulting in a curious hybrid of ""Boy's Own"" adventure story and turbo-charged blockbuster (set-pieces include a spectacular recreation of Captain Nemo's 'Nautilus', the sinking of Venice, and several destructive rampages by the hulking Mr. Hyde!), though the mixture of styles never seems forced or arbitrary, thanks to a clever script by James Dale Robinson (COMIC BOOK VILLAINS).

An unusual cast of veterans and newcomers is toplined by Connery, who coasts through proceedings on the strength of his established screen persona, while everyone else is upstaged by scene-stealer Stuart Townsend (QUEEN OF THE DAMNED), playing Dorian Gray as a dandified nobleman, bored with his immortality and contemptuous of the world around him, whose skirmishes with vampire/ex-girlfriend Mina Harker (Peta Wilson, TV's ""La Femme Nikita"") are charged with sexual tension - these characters surely deserve a movie of their own! Sadly, the film is undermined by a lackluster 'surprise' villain, miscast and misconceived, whose lack of visual presence leaves a significant hole in the narrative. However, despite this minor drawback and some well-documented production troubles (Connery and director Norrington were at loggerheads throughout), the finished article shows no signs of on-set problems, and is much better than its modest box-office performance would otherwise suggest.",1077148800,,2284,5.725663716814159

It truely is a neat idea to take a few of the most well known literary characters and put them together to fight a common evil in this flick. But the idea and the special effects are as far as this movie went.
  The storyline is simple, toss in some famous characters, such as Nemo, from 10,000 Leages Under the Sea, Mr. Hyde, The Invisable Man, and a few vampires as well as Sean Connery's character Allen Quartermain, and there is your Leage. They are brought together to fight a criminal mastermind named The Phantom who is attempting to start a world war.
  It sounds interesting, but the storyline is pretty flimsy. I will give The Leage it's credit though, the special effects were amazing, and it is worth the watch just for the quality of the surround sound.",1076889600,,864,4.554838709677419

Well, I gotta say that I enjoyed the film thoroughly. It's an entertaining action-adventure romp with very cool characters and a great cast to play them. The special effects are excellent, particularly this films version of Mr Hyde who looks very much like the character in the comics. I especially like the set design and CGI backgrounds which retain the flavour of comic artist Kevin O'Neill's work (there's a small visual gag that tips the hat to O'Neill and writer Alan Moore...see if you can spot it).

1481020,1,B00005JM5B,"One day film historians will look back on this era as the time when special effects truly achieved legendary heights.  After all, this is the era of the ""Matrix"" and ""Lord Of the Rings"" trilogies, the era where the technology of filmmaking has made it possible to show anything the mind can conceive, and do so believably.
In that future day when yet-unborn historians wax philosophic about this watershed period in time, ""LXG"" will be mentioned frequently as a prime example of how the technology also made it possible for films to be spectacularly stupid while looking and sounding as brilliant as the best of them.  FX appears to be the only reason this film was made, and the only part of the entire production that received much attention.
Sean Connery and a cast of mostly unknowns or little-knowns barrel their way through an anorexic script with plot holes large enough for its own monstrously super-sized Nautilus submarine to plow through.  The Venice plot line, for example, including the exposition, action scenes, and execution, couldn't have made less sense if the dialogue were in Swahili with no subtitles.
The film's version of Mr. Hyde looks like nothing more than a Macy's parade balloon on steroids, so they couldn't even get all the FX right.  In one scene we're also expected to believe the beast can breathe underwater....oh yeah, that's right after Dr. Jekyll magically locates his potion approximately two seconds after he's dived into a sinking Nautilus scene that otherwise seems to have been transposed directly out of a print of ""Titanic.""
The legend of Allan Quartermain hasn't suffered this badly since Richard Chamberlain starred in a 1985 remake of ""King Solomon's Mines,"" rush-produced in the wake of ""Raiders Of the Lost Ark.""

If you remember the TV ads for it you've seen the best bits and that isn't much of an exaggeration. Sean Connery was good but most of the others were just sort of there to take up space.
The idea of taking characters from several works of 19th century fiction never really works very well and could often have been better developed. Tom Sawyer, U.S. Secret Service, how'd that happen?, we don't get a clue. Mina Harker, Vampire, widow of one of the men who fought Dracula, never a clue as to how she isn't evil or can survive in sunlight, doesn't seem to need to feed very often either.
The best sets were the club/hotel(?)in Africa where Quatermain is recruited to the League and a couple of libraries in London, all either blown or shot up. Nemo's submarine looked as big as an aircraft carrier in some ways but also like it was razor thin, certainly bigger on the inside than the outside.
I kind of liked  the tank raid evil whatever his name was did on the Bank of England, a bit ahead of it's time but mostly looked OK. Nemo's 1930's style car was really pushing things for 1899, too much for me as what cars there were looked like (and were)horseless carriages. One of the most ridiculous bits was the League's journey from London to Venice. First you have this huge razor thin submarine rising up in the Thames (which is probably too shallow for anything so big) and then they make it to Venice in only three days! Around southern England then France aand Spain and through the Straits of Gibraltar alone would take more time than that even today even without travelling halfway across the Mediterranean Sea.

After reading the graphic novel, I was very excited about the movie, but I found myself disappointed with the retelling and rewriting.  What was wrong with the original?
The extras on the DVD discuss how Sean Connery was approached, and perhaps as a way to get him involved, the script was rewritten to take Mina Harker from her leadership role and replace her with Alan Quartermain.  Also, Quartermain, in this telling, is merely a retired adventurer rather than an opium fiend found in a back alley.
Because I had such high expectations, I was only mildly pleased with the movie.  Seeing each character fight his or her inner demons was interesting, but I couldn't stop comparing it to the book.

The juvenile plot is a far cry from Moore's book, and the direction from Stephen Norrington (Blade) is the only thing besides the acting from Connery and Shah that seems to have any inspiration at all.  I like the idea of using actual special effects as opposed to overbloated CGI, but the film as a whole just tanks thanks to some unexplained elements, plot holes galore, and twists and turns we see coming a mile away.  Rumor has it that Norrington and Connery practicly came to blows during filming; that probably would have been more entertaining than this turkey.

Having now watched this film twice; I would definitely have to say that this film is entertaining and quite intriguing in its plot.  I imagine I can say that as I know little of the comics so I don't have the first clue what the director and screen writers did or didn't do to the originality of the series.  Having said that, I would temper it with the fact that just as in the case of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and many other examples, they ""can't always put it on the screen as it was in the book or in this case comic book(s).""
Among the better aspects of this film were the dark undertones that seem to be quite prevalent in newer films these days.  While many may lament over the script or characters or what have you, I also found the pacing of this Sci-Fi/action film to be quite good!
Performance wise, all of the actors did a very good job with this film.  One thing you can always count on in a film with Sean Connery's named attached to it is an outstanding performance by him and he definitely does that with this film.
This is the first film I've watched a film that Stephen Norrington has directed and I would definitely have to say, based on this film that it would be interesting to go back and see some of his earlier films and to keep an eye out for his future films.
The Premise:
It is the year 1899 and someone appears to be making all attempts to instigate world war by committing terrorist acts against the governments of several key nations, all the while disguised as the opposing nation.  In comes the call to Allan Quartermain (Sean Connery) by the Crown, to help organize the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and seek out whoever is organizing these acts and neutralize them.
What follows from there is a fairly good Science Fiction/action film in which several ""heroes"" and not so heroic personalities form the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and go on an adventure to stop this terrorist.
I would definitely recommend this film to any and all who are interested in well written, well paced Science Fiction/action flicks that involve some very familiar names.  {ssintrepid}

With a team of well-known literary characters -- Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Tom Sawyer, Dorian Gray, Wilhelmina Harker, Captain Nemo, and an Invisible Man -- he sets sail for Venice to stop the Phantom.
Not a bad action film for a Saturday matinee, full of explosions, chases and evil plots.  One of the main problems, though, is the special effects.  A few of them are quite good, such as the Invisible Man, but the majority tend to be very two-dimensional.  They look like computer-generated images, and, sadly, the movie relies on them, instead of the story and characters, to carry the film.  Also, for gathering such a great array of actors -- Sean Connery as Allan Quartermain, Jason Flemyng as Jekyll/Hyde, Richard Roxburgh as M, and Peta Wilson as Mina Harker, to name a few -- they are given very little to do, and almost no time is given to get to know the characters, almost as if the creators took advantage of the fact that the viewer alredy knows who they are.

Sean Connery seems to have thrown his lot in with some extremely lack-luster talent here.  Granted, I can see why some women find Stuart Townsend pretty, but every role he's in seems to place a rather smug ""Gosh, I know I'm beautiful"" look on his face.  I mean, Dorian Gray...an IMMORTAL?  Please.
Mina-the occasional vampire lady-seems on the verge of evoking some sort of emotion, but just can't get past the costume.  One laughably memorable moment is where she looks frightened in the car as Dorian jumps off to supposedly attack some bad guys.  A few seconds later, she positively growls something to the effect of, ""These men are mine!"" whilst launching herself into attack.  Fear...anger...whatever.  It's in the script, right?
Jekyll/Hyde...I won't even go there.  And the Invisible Man was too smarmy for my taste.
Despite the lack of talent, there may have been some room for good story, character development, etc., but there's nothing there either.  The evil Phantom wants to take over the world, or some foolish nonsense of the sort, and there are plot twists and double-crosses that perhaps an 8-year old might be taken aback with a childish, ""I didn't see that coming, Daddy!""  Funny, the rest of the adult audience could see a lot of this nonsense straight off the bat.
One prime example of where character development fails centers around the loss of Sean Connery's son in the film, but even the Phantom's taunting doesn't even get a rise out of him.  The American who is oh-so-obviously-a-detached-replacement-of-a-son hardly conjures any tears, sympathy, or any emotive response for that matter.

1481115,3,B00005JM5B,"This film receives a lot of criticism, but I actually quite enjoyed it. It's loaded with flaws, such as messy explanations, confusing turns in plot, and character developments that don't quite go anyplace...but it's nonetheless exciting, well-designed, filled with tremendous visual effects, fast-moving, and crammed with wonderful characters from classic literature. As a home viewing experience on a Saturday night, it's certainly worth your time.
Based on Alan Moore's classic graphic novel, ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" tampers a bit with Moore's original idea, toning down its violence and adding in the Tom Sawyer character (probably to increase appeal to Americans, and American teenage girls in particular, but still stays true to the fantastic idea of linking all of the later Victorian hero characters into a sort of early Just League of Great Britain: we've got Alan Quartermain from H. Rider Haggard's ""King Solomon's Mines"" (perfectly played by Sean Connery), Dorian Grey from Oscar Wilde's ""Picture of Dorian Grey,"" the extremely sexy vampiress Mina Harker from ""Dracula"" (Peta Wilson in a very steamy, repressed performance), Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, Captain Nemo and his Nautilis from ""20,000 Leagues Beneath the Sea,"" and a character who sort of resembles ""The Invisible Man"" (but for reason of copyright isn't actually H. G. Wells's invisible man). There's also a surprise villain tucked inside. Heck, it's messy, but it's fun.
There are some exciting action sequences, such as a shoot-out in an African plantation, a blazing fire-fight in a library, and a confusing but eye-popping attempt to stop the destruction of Venice. The finale goes all-out, and even if it doesn't always make sense, it's exhilarating nonetheless. And Sean Conne...well, he's just got the right moves for this sort of character and this kind of picture. He's a joy to watch.
The extras are okay, nothing superb. The documentary is a bit patchy and oddly put together, but gives some interesting info on how the film was constructed in the Czech Republic. (It contains, however, nothing about the conflict between Connery and director Norrington, which would have been interesting to hear about). More data on the Victorian sources for the movie would have helped the viewer who hasn't read many of the original books.
""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" despite what you may have heard, is really a fun time. No smash hit out of the park, but a solid double. And maybe it will get you interested in reading some of the source material. (I highly recommend ""King Solomon's Mines"" by H. Rider Haggard if you've never read it.)",1075852800,,2630,5.205188679245283

As I was watching it though, I did understand the reason why so many reviews are negative. If you are under the age of 30, and you have never read the following books; ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"", ""Dracula"", ""Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde"", ""The Invisible Man"", ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", any of the Sherlock Holmes tales or any of the Alan Quartermaine adventure stories (think a sort of early version of Indiana Jones from literature), then you WILL NOT have a good understanding of any of the main characters or their actions and motivations in this adventure fantasy film. So don't buy it. Anyone who HAS read those books and therefore knows who the characters are, you WILL have a good time watching this movie. I thought it was great fun and I regret not having seen it on the big screen. You do NOT have to be familiar in any way with the graphic novel of the same name. I had never read it or heard of it until reading about it in some of the negative reviews, and having watched the movie I can say with certainty that I didn't need to read it to understand and enjoy the movie.

The first half of the movie is spent introducing the characters and explaining their ""origin"".  Since there are so many characters, the method used to do this is each of them basically asking each other ""So, what's your story?"" again and again (and again).  They could have done it all at once and been done with it, but they didn't and this part of the movie goes on, and on...  I suppose it's laudable that they tried something different, but it didn't work.  They didn't insert enough of the plot in between each ""origin"" dialogue, so it comes off as a tedious process without any suspense or interest.
Other aspects of the film that didn't work were:
Sean Connery's character as father figure to the young Tom Sawyer, no chemistry there, they just couldn't pull it off.
The Nautilus being the length of three aircraft carriers.  I understand the concept of suspension of disbelief, but this was ridiculous.
Why is Mina Harker, supposedly a vampire, able to walk about in full daylight?  This is never explained.

1481124,4,B00005JM5B,"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, or LXG is sort of a rip off of the X men, but it also had more background than a comic book (LXG was based on a graphic Novel). LXG also has some scenes that remind me of scenes in the Lord of the Rings movies. This movie is set at the turn of the century, in the 1890s. A threat to the world had developed from a character named the Phantom who would build machines of destruction and get countrys to turn against each other hoping to cause a World War.
As a result, a man known only as M (and something else that I won't give away) calls together a group of Extraordinary Gentlemen (and Gentlewomen). The leader was Sean Connery, who was a hunter. Then there was an Immortal named Dorian Grey. There was a Beast named Mr. Hyde who was sometimes Dr. Jeckle. A woman that was bit by Dracula when her husband was hunting him was the vampire. There was also an Invisible man, and an American Spy that you didn't find out that he was Tom Sawyer after Mark Twain was done with him until the credits. And finally, the seventh Extraordinary gentleman was a scientest named Captan Nemo who had a submarine named the Nautalus.
This group goes out to conqure evil and all that stuff, and not giving too much away, they are successful, and from the ending, I'll be expecting a sequel (which they tried to hard to achieve).
Of course, this movie wasn't academy award worthy, but it's still worth seeing (mostly because it was so corny). The story could have been developed much better, but the movie also has non-stop action, great special effects, and a cool way to extend the storys of classic literature.

I quickly grew tired of the turgid literary references that would almost certainly be wasted anyway on the sort of audience this film is designed to enthrall -""Call me Ishmael"", for instance.
It is a watchable movie, all the same, but if you have any love for literature I suggest you stay away from this, as you will almost certainly be enraged by this film.",1075161600,,673,4.349206349206349
1481176,3,B00005JM5B,"I saw this both in the theater and bought it on DVD, so it rates the ""a bit above average"" three stars. For the critics, the thing that hurt this film so badly was its release in a year of premier releases. Pirates of the Carribean stole the show for a lot of otherwise pretty good films, which include the second Tomb Raider, third Matrix, third Terminator, and second X-Men. League falls behind most of them and lines up about equal to the third Terminator. It does better than Hulk in both story line and watchability (the split screen comic book style of Hulk was distracting and actually gave me a headache!).
Where the film fails is in the storyline itself. First, the characters are fictionalizations of fictional characters. Tom Sawyer never grew up with his world, Dorian Gray is out of place, Nemo was embittered against society (and never a pirate), and Quartermain was, well, boring at best. The one thing that saves the characterizations is that they are out of copyright and so are subject to being changed...
The story develops decently, but is a bit disjointed here and there. It moves along a little faster than perhaps good timing would dictate and the ending... well, there's a better way to end it and something more in keeping with the fun and games that this film should have contained...
Which is also why it fails. Where Jolie's Tomb Raider succeeds is the same place where Depp's pirate succeeds. It doesn't take itself too seriously. This film, while it works at times as a fun chase, has elements which are far too serious and if those were eliminated and some of the storyline fleshed out, this film could measure up to rate four stars.
Connery turns in his usual fine performance as do most of the other actors. Some of the film doesn't work (the black/white ""revelation"" while listening to an audio recording which, by the way carries a sound far above audibility and way out of the ability of that kind of player) while other parts do (Nemo's transportation, both on water and on land).

1481179,1,B00005JM5B,"There's no point addressing the individual flaws of this film. It really is one continuous flaw from start to finish. Take a group of fairly well known and established characters from literature and dumb them down into one-dimensional caricatures, throw them into a ridiculous over the top story woven together with illogic and some of the worst special effects I've seen in a long time, mix it all up until it is completely incomprehensible, then serve it up as a summer blockbuster. Beside all the obvious flaws with the story and the characters, it's just plain boring. It's not even interesting on a visceral level. It really takes skill to take all these presumably interesting characters and make a film that is as utterly disengaging as this is.
Anyone who claims to know anything about the literary material this is derived from and still claims to like it is ether lying about their knowledge of literature, or is mentally impaired.

Could they have taken out the pointless car scene ( much like Lucas could have taken out the pointless pod racing scene from Phantom Menace)? Oh heck yeah!

Either there was a different Director of Photography, or producer or something.  There were many rumors of Sean Connery and Norrington butting heads on the set as well as the movie being delayed due to budget...but so was Blade.  Myself, I enjoyed it, to a point.  I thought the concept was facinating, if not simple; bring together characters from Victorian literature (extremely intresting) to battle a world power hungry villian (cliched).  The characters are good and most of them are well cast.  The father/son subplot between Quartermain and Sawyer is nice, but it is being beaten to death in many action movies these days.  The romance subplot between Harker and Gray is more instresting.  Although the special effects are good, it does seem like the budget ran low in some spots.  Don't nit pick this movie, the action scenes are good and the pace moves it right along in most areas and it is very entertaining.  But overall you're left with a sense of longing for character development.  As if something else was supposed to take place, but didn't.  But hey, it is just an action flick.  The cheezy ending may ruin it for some as well, if you are easily thrown off by one far fetched gesture.

Unfortunately that is often impossible. Movies and comics are separate art forms. In fact the only thing the comic and movie have in common is really the premise. Personally I view the movie and the comics separate. I liked it alot and thought it was very well done.

It has 'extraordinary' flaws even a viewer can spot. It's frantic action from one scene to another provides us without a sense of logic for its characters.
The characters, I should say, is lead by ageless Sean Connery. He commands a group of superheroes to fight a villian who wants to conquest earth. Some of the interesting heroes include Captain Nemo, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde and a stunning vampiress. They're postively good, but don't have that much screen time. That's one of the flaws here. Again, the fast-paced action muddles throughout the film. The script, which makes a great movie, is a fault which the film can't correct. It just focuses on the action! The cast is almost a waste. Connery can't seem to break out and have fun. I guess his confrontations with director Stephen Norrington was a reason. He has no motivation.
The visuals are somewhat fair. It was just uninspired. A good thing about this movie was the early 20th-century production design. The climax also is ineffective and leaves too many answers. Even though I haven't read the comic books, fans probably won't like this.

From the reviews of the movie, one would get the idea that it is the worst movie ever made, but in reality, there are a lot worse ones.  Sure, the cast is not made up of big names, but they are still quite talented.  Sean Connery is very good as Quartermein, Jason Flemyng is excellent as Dr. Henry Jekyll, and Stuart Townsend is perfect as Dorian Gray.  Although the latter two are not mega stars like Connery, they are still very talented British stage actors.
Another reason that I like the movie is that the main characters are Mina Harker, Dr. Jekyll (and of course Mr. Hyde), Captain Nemo, The Invisible Man (but not the original one from the Wells book), Dorian Gray, and Tom Sawyer.  With the exception of Sawyer, who I feel was thrown in because they wanted to ""American-ize"" the movie, the characters in the movie are just like I remembered them from the books they came from.  I read and loved the books ""Dracula"" (Bram Stoker), ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" (Robert Louis Stevenson), ""20000 Leagues Under the Sea"" (Jules Verne), ""The Invisible Man"" (H.G. Wells), ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" (Oscar Wilde), and ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"" (Mark Twain).  The characters are all what I imagined them to be when I was reading the books, so seeing them on screen is very cool.
In some places the special effects are a little shoddy, but I really didn't mind because I was too busy watching great actors act out great material.  In my opinion, The League of Extrordinary Gentlemen is right up there with The X-men.

Proof, once again, that you can't trust the critics.
To be sure, this ain't ""Lord of the Rings,"" or, ""The Matrix."" To be sure, the plot isn't anything original. To be sure, the acting isn't going to win any oscars or emmys or anything. What we have here, ladies and gentlemen, is nothing more than a really solid action flick.
The movie centers around a group of characters plucked from old sci-fi and horror literature. The special effects and action are outstanding, as should be expected in our technological age. The characters are all well-acted and well done. The plot is nothing new, but the twist of the old heroes coming together keeps it engaging.
There are only two flaws in this movie. One, as I stated previously, is that it would have been nice to see more of the characters interact. The second is the plot is a bit hackneyed, but there are enough original twists to keep it going.

Not a drama that deserves an Academy Award, but one fun movie that harkens me to time of fun matinees at the local theater. Any fan of knockoffs like Richard Chamberlain's Quartermain movie will enjoy it. The production is excellent and the special effects are incredibly well done. I have never seen transitions of characters to their alter egos any smoother. The characters right out of the pages of wonderful books about adventurers and science fiction wonders give us a nice blend of good and evil.
These forces both have their share of tricks and fascinating devices that are ahead of their time. I think Sean Connery does a nice job of grounding the movie in at least a little believability. His character seems the most realistic and his performance is memorable. All the rest the cast are well suited to their roles and do a fine job of making us like them or hate them as their roles require. The role of a female Vampire seems a little contrived to include a woman in the group of gentlemen, but it is very well performed by Peta Wilson. I also loved the bat minion touch.

I am sure some will tell you the characters are not true to their book counter parts. Heaven forbid that the film makers would actually use a little imagination of their own and expand on the literary figures. I wouldn't want them to make this fictional or anything. Wait this movie is fictional! Now if you can just get book fans to let their minds OPEN UP to change.

And now that I've read the graphic novel, I can say the plot is much improved! Anyway, this reimagining of the story is a surprisingly original idea brought to life by dazzling effects and good character acting.
in 1899, a mad scientist named the Fantom plans to pitch Europe into a premature World War 1 with all-too-modern weaponry (machine guns, body armor, napalm), which he'll sell to all sides. To stop this plot, a 'League' of 19th-Century literary figures are called together by a mysterious agent M. Great White Hunter Allan Quatermain reluctantly leads such characters as Mina Harker(slayer of Dracula), Captain Nemo, Dr. Jekyll(& Mr. Hyde), Rodney Skinner(The Invisible Man), Dorian Gray, and (on loan from the American Secret Service) Tom Sawyer. Feeling each other out on the way, The League heads to the Fantom's suspected next target, but they quickly discover there's a traitor among them, agent M is not what he seems, and all have been tricked into having their uniqueness stolen for the Fantom's dastardly schemes! (Incidentally, I figured out the Fantom's true identity about 2/3 into the film, can you? Listen for 3 clues in London and after Venice) Now the League must once more chase down Fantom and his spy before he unleashes pandemonium!
LXG stands out as one of the year's coolest films, and might even get younger viewers to read the original books(even if their teachers haven't asked them). A subtle twist at the end might even set up a sequel, and I would like to see this imaginative storyline continue. Not every movie has to be a critical darling, and this one proves that sometimes a clever story can make it to the big screen, even if it has special effects. Plus, Mr. Connery is still a wondrous film hero. Sit back, get your popcorn, and take off with The League.",1074038400,,2203,4.709844559585492

I put this in my DVD player with all the negative critical reviews in mind, thinking I would then enjoy it more if I didn't expect too much.  No, sorry, this movie is poorly made comic book tripe.  The special effects are incredibly poor, looking more like video game nonsense than a big budget extravaganza.  When the Nautilus first rises and we are all supposed to be in awe of its immense size and grandeur, it looks more like a shiny toy on a blue screen.  Then there are the characters.  While I at first felt a kind of nostalgia at seeing the Insvisible Man, Dorian Gray, and Mina Harker from Bram Stoker's ""Dracula,"" that feeling soon wore off and I was left with a motley cast spewing out one-liners and dumb babble.  Captain Nemo entering the picture was my first indication of downhill progress.  He looks and acts monumentally stupid, and is somehow able to perform martial arts like Jackie Chan.  Mr. Hyde is another poor creation, with obvious makeup effects and bad dialogue.  There are many plot flaws here, as well. The Nautilus, this huge vessel when first revealed, is then able to shrink in size and then traverse the narrow canals of Venice?  Mina Harker, a vampire, is standing in the daylight at the end of the film?  There were other scenes that were plugged in for time consumption.  One example is when Allan Quartermain is atop the Nautilus firing at red buoys being launched by Captain Nemo.  If there was ever a scene that needed to be cut, this was it.  The special effects are not special; the acting is okay in moments, but poor overall.  This is a really bad movie in virtually every way.",1073865600,4,1680,4.53156146179402

The characters of 'The League' may not be mutants like the X-Men but they are the products of their classical heroic deeds, which obviously these characters came from novels of such well-known authors. Unfortunately for the filmmakers of this movie, the power of Seven didn't actually create a solid foundation as one League nor it had not really shown the power of Seven as one League but more on selfishness like Dorian Gray and each of the characters wants to exceed his or her own identity above the others.
Some actors did quite fairly enough to justify his/her portrayal as this person. With due respect for Sean Connery, as an actor, I like his character he played in the movie but it turned to be a bullying style of acting dominating others but of course, he is a leading character and as they say follow the leader. This latest film he co-produced was not that all its best and can be a mockery for his profession as a highly notable actor.

1481271,3,B00005JM5B,"There are two ways to evaluate this film -- as an adaptation of a popular graphic novel and as a film in its own right -- and this film fails on both counts.  I wanted to like this movie -- I love adventure films and Sean Connery, I really enjoyed the graphic novel on which it was based, and I am a fan of the literary figures depicted -- but it was such a mess.

The premise is fantastic -- a team of 19th century literary figures is assembled to fight for the British empire -- a Victorian Action League -- awesome!!  The cast is great, the acting is fine, the sets and costumes and makeup look great and capture the mood of the novel -- but the screenplay is a gigantic mess.  You'll be lost fast if you aren't familiar with the characters -- Wilde's Dorian Gray, Mina Harker from Dracula, Wells's Invisible Man, Haggard's Allan Quartermain, Verne's Captain Nemo and Stevenson's Jekyll/Hyde combo, with Twain's adult Tom Sawyer thrown in for good measure.  The characters and the team aren't really developed or motivated well and the  villain never seems as interesting as the league.  Impressive action sequences blur together and the ending is cliched, abrupt and mawkish.

Warning! Minor spoilers: If you're a fan of the graphic novel, you will probably see this anyway.  It's irresistible.  But lower your expectations.  The comic has Mina Harker assembling the league, and she finds Quatermain is a slovenly drunk, but in the film he is the leader and the assembler (hmmm, and the executive producer -- coincidence?), and she is a vampire.  While I think having her a vampire was a good move, other departures from the written material are questionable.  Instead of taking place in London, the team moves to Venice (so the filmmakers can blow it up, basically) where they have a car chase (even though Venice has no streets that would enable the car to race around!) and then we see Piazza San Marco destroyed.  Strangely, while I was willing to accept the league of fictional characters, watching the basilica collapse was quite jarring.  I think adding Tom Sawyer (to appeal to Americans, presumably) was goofy, though the actor did a fine job, and adding Dorian Gray was questionable as well, though actor Stuart Townsend (the original Aragorn before being replaced by Viggo Mortensen) also gives a fine performance.
DVD extras include two commentary tracks -- one with the producers and the actors who played the Invisible Man, Tom Sawyer and Dr. Jekyll, and one with the costumer, fx people and makeup artist -- no commentary by star and executive producer Connery!  Also included are 12 deleted or extended scenes, Assembling the League -- a set of featurettes about the source material and adaptation, costumes, Hyde, the Nemomobile and Venice, and a bizarre ""special message"" psa on the dangers of driving under the influence of marijuana.  Did somebody have a community service obligation, or what?

The film can be heard in English, Spanish or French, and subtitled in English or Spanish.

So what happens?  Like most groups formed by such men, crime & evil doesn't tend to stand a chance & while the plot is predictable Director Stephen Norrington (Blade) beefs up the action with style and a punch or two to the gut.

1481317,3,B00005JM5B,"I wish those ... Hollywood executives would stop mangling comic strips into movies.  With a few rare exceptions, it doesn't work.  Comics are a medium that can make extremely illogical scenes seem plausible, whereas film can take that same scene and render it ridiculous.  Consider these examples from the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen:
 The League is introduced to the Nautilus, a prototype Submarine.  It's roughly the size of the Titanic with sexy lines rivaling anything modern, with speed and maneuvering capabilities to match.  Keep in mind that this is supposed to be @ 1899.
 Oops, somebody took a high-performance sports car and tacked a body shell over it to resemble a Victorian land yacht.  That's the vehicle our heroes are jerking around through the streets of Venice on a chase scene.  Is it still 1899?
 In his over-the-top ""Darth Vader meets Colonel Klink"" getup, the villain just looks like he stepped out of a comic book.  Since this is a film, he shouldn't.
 Captive scientists in the villain's lair are performing genetic manipulations such as cloning with samples from our heroes.  Uhhhh....
 There's much more, but I think your intelligence was insulted enough with those.
A few words about the plot:  a motley assortment of people from around the world with extraordinary abilities are called to help Britannia foil an evil plot to start World War 1.  These include fictional literary characters like Dr. Jeckyll/Mr. Hyde, the Invisible Man, and Captain Nemo, as well as a few made-ups.  An interesting set up with lots of potential that just didn't get explored enough IMHO.  However, because of the above-mentioned problems with translating this to a film that was, oddly enough, marketed toward teens and adults sophisticated enough to sneer at it, this concept just seemed stupid.
Some nice things can be said about this movie.  The cast was well-chosen for their character roles, and do reasonably good jobs.  Visually, TLOEG was a wonderful rendition of a Victorian world made fantastic.  The special effects and art direction at least deserve nominations.  But that, my friends, is IT.
Rent TLOEG if you're into the comic series, just so you can see how our modern special effects technology did justice to it.  But remember to keep the volume turned off to avoid brain cramp.

Jackie Chan is seven months shy of 50, and still lithe as a cat scaling a wall. Nevertheless, it is clear in The Medallion that he is not the miraculous whirlwind he once was.
His fight scenes and chases, while still choreographed with balletic ingenuity, tend to highlight earth-bound skills - like that wall-climbing trick he still executes so effortlessly.
More tellingly, he submits at long last to the dominion of special effects.
Particularly in the second half of the movie, he sails through the air in fanciful style, propelled by wires and computer-generated illusions.
There is nothing inherently wrong with that, and heaven knows no other action star at work today has shown Chan's uncanny stamina. The guy deserves a break.
Still, the high-flying digital tricks signal the end of the pure-Jackie era of no stunt doubles, no wires and no computer effects.
Old-schoolers may mourn, but action stars like to show they are more than fists and feet, so why not the Chan Man himself?
As if to underscore the transition to a new style, The Medallion also gives Chan a reasonable facsimile of a romance, not to mention his first serious on-screen kiss.
Claire Forlani (Meet Joe Black) does an able job as Nicole James, an Interpol officer who reconnects with Hong Kong inspector Eddie Yang (Chan) when he goes to Ireland looking for a kidnapped child.
It seems the little boy was born to fulfill an ancient Buddhist prophecy about supernatural powers - including life and death - to be had with a certain magical medallion.
Naturally, a megalomaniacal bad guy - with the wickedly lurid name of Snakehead (Julian Sands) - has gotten wind of the prophecy and means to have the medallion for himself.
In the opening scenes, Eddie rescues the boy from a burning room shortly after sharing his octopus dinner with a street-side dog. (Nobody ever accused the Hong Kong action-movie community of excessive subtlety.) For the rest of the movie, he performs variations of the same feat, as the kid changes hands several times.
At one point, Eddie even appears to be stone-cold dead, but having bonded with the life-and-death kid, he gets to come back. His rebirth bonus is virtual immortality. He can feel pain but doesn't bleed when injured - as demonstrated in a funny scene when he is stabbed repeatedly by an incredulous crony.
That crony is another Interpol agent called Watson, played by the British slapstick comic Lee Evans (Mouse Hunt), who is sometimes charmingly clumsy and sometimes cloying and overbroad.
Aside from such tone-deaf lapses, director Gordon Chan, who shares writing credit with four others, observes the conventions of the Jackie Chan style while adding a layer of high-tech polish to the proceedings.
The movie's action scenes are choreographed by Chan's childhood friend Sammo Hung, the veteran Hong Kong director and actor best known in the United States from his stint on the TV series Martial Law.
Hung's playful take on martial-arts style perfectly matches Chan's own comic bent; together they pack more wit into a simple chase than most action movies do into their most elaborate showdowns.
It is that wit that is the sorriest loss in the turn to special effects. Anybody can fly with a green screen and wires, but it takes a creative mind to figure out a way for one little guy to whomp a roomful of opponents all by himself.",1073347200,,3625,4.876823338735819

The movie attempts to show how secret forces operated behind the creation of the Twentieth Century and the world wars during that century.  At the end of the movie, the character representing the British empire played by Sean Connery, Alan Quartermain, remarks that as the Nineteenth Century belonged to him so the Twentieth will belong to the young American boy, ""Sawyer"".  Thus, we see how the British empire has faded and the rise of the American superpower brought about through the First and Second World Wars.  The movie unfortunately isn't able to fully show the detail of this interpretation.  I enjoyed this movie and it raised for me many questions about the role of secret forces influencing the birth of the Twentieth Century.  When the League is initiated we see a masonic symbol on the door to the hall where the League has its first meeting.  Perhaps this indicates that the masonic societies have played a role in initiating wars and revolutions.

It also helps if you have read either the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill or any of the classic adventure novels from which the League's characters are borrowed (King Solomon's Mines, Dracula, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, The Portrait of Dorian Grey, just to name a few).  If you embrace the idea that this is a popcorn-adventure movie and not one of those serious Oscar-contending films, then you'll have a good time.
As comic-book-based movies go, LXG isn't on the same legendary adaptation level as Superman: The Movie or Spiderman.  Nevertheless, the conceit of uniting some of the best adventure/fantasy characters from late 19th Century literature and pitting them against a clever wannabe world dominator in order to stop a world war in 1899 is not exactly a bad one.  And of course it helps to have Sean Connery (Dr. No, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) as the head of an ensemble that includes TV's La Femme Nikita's Peta Wilson, Shane West, Stuart Townsend and Jason Fleming.  As legendary hunter Allan Quatermain Connery (who's also executive producer of this project) exudes world-weary cynicism and a sense of honorable duty as he leads a group of literary superheroes on a quest to stop the mysterious Fantom, a war-hungry arms merchant/inventor who seeks to pit the European superpowers against each other.  Of course, it's up to the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen to stop this madman and preserve world peace (at least until 1914!).
Screenwriter James Dale Robinson and director Stephen Norrington keep things moving at a brisk pace, and the whole movie sparkles with a sense of fun and humor that was clearly lacking in both Daredevil and The Hulk, both of which are examples of how not to make a comic book movie.

LXG, The Movie, is what you get when a concept  like this gets put through the Hollywood ""money-grubber"" machine.
  Tom Sawyer gets thrown in so American audiences can ""relate"" to the other characters (we don't read books anymore, remember?). Mina Harker got turned into an extra from Blade II, turning into bats, flying around in a black leather outfit!! Captain Nemo (they kept him as he is in the book, but they changed the design of the Nautilus), Dorian Gray and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are also in this film.

1481370,3,B00005JM5B,"This was an alright movie with an alright premise. The obvious question of ""Where is Sherlock Holmes in this movie which is set in 1899 London and full of all fictional characters?"" was resolved by the appearance of Professor Moriarty at the end, since Sherlock would have recognized Moriarty. Even without that, he would have ruined the movie by solving the mystery (or else, failing to solve the mystery, would have been an unsatisfying character). The more obvious question of ""Who is this invisible guy, and why didn't they use the actual Invisible Man?"" was resolved when I found out that they had wanted to use Wells' character but that it was still copyrighted--an unsatisfying resolution, but understandable nonetheless--and it really was pretty important to the plot to have an invisible guy around. However, there was one thing that seriously annoyed me (actually two things) and which has not been resolved: Why was Tom Sawyer in this movie in the first place? Everyone else had an ""extraordinary"" skill, such as being undead, otherwise immortal, invisible, or possessed of animal strength, or being a really good hunter or having a fancy submarine. What did Tom Sawyer have? Equally importantly, you may remember from Huckleberry Finn that Huck, Tom's colleague, ran away with a slave named Jim (in other words, slavery was still in practice). This means that Huck and Tom should have been around 50 years old by 1899. Now, I could understand bending the rules if Tom's presence were indispensible, but since it was far from it, it seriously got on my nerves to see a twenty-something Tom, thirty-five years after the end of the Civil War.

Now, I'm not the type to nitpick historical details in movies or keep online journals about the scientific inaccuracies which I discover in Star Trek movies--far from it. But this stuff just jumps out at you in this movie. Perhaps Tom was just there so illiterate Americans (see also: Huck Finn's father) could watch the film and say, ""Tom Sawyer... At least I know who one of 'em is!""",1072742400,3,2157,4.864130434782608
1481371,1,B00005JM5B,"This film is not the book, and I understand adaptations should never be compared to the books they were based on, but simply as a film, this was ghastly.
The film had a very literary premise, and while it needn't stay true to the graphic novel, it should've stayed true to the books the characters came from.  Granted, Nemo's ethnicity was correct, but dozens of other details were wrong- most astonishingly about how Gray regards his picture.  The whole point of the movie is that it's a story that imports literary characters; the filmakers should make the import believable.
Merely as a film, there were incongruities and while I, too, thought that 'Hulk' was a bad CGI adventure, I was further put off by Mister Hyde.  Lines like 'Call me Ishmael' were lost in the script and were easily passed over in the storytelling.  Even as an action flick it was laughable.  There was one Bruce Lee sparring act that sprang up from the unlikeliest of people.
The film is extraordinarily distaseful and I urge everyone interested to read the comic book by Alan Moore instead.  That should be sufficient. The movie ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" had brilliant source material, as that source material, in turn, did too, but while Alan Moore did a marvellous job with his art, I'm very much afraid the filmmakers here did not.",1072742400,2,1326,4.7685589519650655
1481372,4,B00005JM5B,"Other reviewers are correct, this movie is not a masterpiece.  It probably will never have a sequel.
So, why did I give it four stars?
Simple, I had fun.  I was not expecting a masterpiece.  I wasn't even expecting to like it much, but I was pleasantly surprized.  Almost from the beginning I enjoyed Sean Connery's character.  It helped that I like him and that I saw KING SOLOMON'S MINES several years ago.  Then I started playing at identifying as many lines from various books as I could find.  Then I just sort of got into it.  If I compared it to professional sports I'd have to say that it certainly wasn't the Super Bowl, perhaps more like all star wrestling.  Then again, out of all the sporting events I've been to, one night ring side at an all star wrestling event stands out as my all time most fun.
RECOMMENDATION:  Don't expect THE LORD OF THE RINGS or STAR WARS. Losen up and have fun with it and you will find an enjoyable movie.  Pop some popcorn and laugh as you watch it with a friend.",1072742400,5,1005,4.320855614973262
1481403,4,B00005JM5B,"It was actually a rather clever film, but it's something you can only fully appreciate if you're well-read or at least familiar with the 19th-century novels that it draws upon as source material.  I personally found it amusing that Captain Nemo (finally depicted as the Indian as Jules Verne had originally described him) had MOBY DICK's Ishmael as his first mate, and that Mr. Hyde was described as ""the monkey that killed all those people in the Rue Morgue,"" a joke directed at Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue,"" and the novelization's mention that the dead agent Tom Sawyer had worked with had been Huckleberry Finn, because I was an English major and had more than a passing familiarity with those works.  It can still be enjoyed for the action and the creative anachronism of introducing modern weapons a couple of decades early, but it helps if you've been to the local library a few times.",1072742400,3,912,4.729559748427673
1481404,1,B00005JM5B,"After just seeing ""The league of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" I can understand why it got such bad reviews. The only good thing that I could say about the movie was Sean Connery was in it and he was the only good actor. The rest of the movie was just plan bad. The one thing that I couldn't understand was Mina Harker was a vampire and everyone know that vampires do not survive in sunlight. This is one movie that watcher should just pass on!",1072742400,,439,4.301204819277109
1481405,4,B00005JM5B,"I really enjoyed the special effects and the action of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  The fact that Sean Connery (an Action Film Icon) was the lead in this made me curious to buy it in the first place.  The storyline though simple, sometimes confusing once all the characters are brought together to save the world (how original), moves along quite fast and doesn't lull you to sleep the way Pirates of the Carribean did.  That was one boring overrated movie that was at least 35-40 minutes too long.  However, where Pirates failed in providing enough action to frankly keep you awake, at least League had enough action, and different characters that we've all grown up and read and heard about at some point to make the film interesting enough to watch it, and the supporting cast was also credible.  Like DeNiro, Connery can take a below average plot and make it above average just with his talent alone.  The DVD extras are wonderful and go in-depth about costume design, special effects, the choice of actors, and about the comic book this movie is based on.  It also details how Connery himself was offered the role in both the Matrix and Lords Of The Rings but had turned them both down because he didn't quite understand the complexity of both films.  I guess the complexity in this film was non-existent but nevertheless, very entertaining and would rate it head and shoulders above Pirates of The Carribean.",1072742400,2,1421,4.771428571428571
1481406,4,B00005JM5B,"Once again we have the temptation to compare the book to the movie, which I will succumb to just a little.  Books and movies are different media, and each brings its own strengths to art.  Such is the case here.  The book was full and lengthy, and while it brought the same breadth of characters, it was able to provide a broader background for each of the characters.  There were some spots where I thought the book was just a bit fuzzy on the plot, but I loved the style.

The movie provides more visuals, but with a two-hour length it had to cut back on the length of background for the characters.  The movie glossed over some of the darker aspects of the characters, particular Alan Quatermain, but enhanced others, particular the background of Mina Harker.  The other strange addition was that of the character of Dorian Gray.  I also objected to the change in the invisible man character from the book to the movie.  I much preferred the book's Hawley Griffin as the invisible man versus Rodney Skinner, who supposedly stole the formula.  Griffin was a much stronger, more tormented character, though his characterization would require more film time to establish and would likely have weakened the roles of the primary actors.

In terms of characterization, Sean Connery clearly shined as Quatermain, as he always seems to do in every role.  Peta Wilson is excellent as the sultry, dangerous Mina Harker.  Naseeruddin Shah as Captain Nemo returns Nemo to his original characterization by Verne as a Sikh.  Shah's Nemo was a welcome variation to previous Nemos, providing a sense of command, control and honor in comparison to those others who sometimes seemed simpering and typically talked far too much for Verne's Nemo.  The other actors have insufficient screen time to fully flesh out their roles, partially because of the large number of lead characters.

The plot itself is a bit of a muddle.  It's difficult to follow the progression and contrivances that lead from point-to-point.  Often the logic is non-existent, and the viewer is left to wonder how they knew they were headed the right direction other than a trite explanation by one of the lead characters.  Had the movie been extended by another 15 or 20 minutes many of the incongruities could have been reduced and the story flow could have been smoothed.  To try to minimize the various confusions: Essentially the story is about a group of sort of good guys out to stop a definite bad guy from conquering the world, except the bad guy has been cleverly manipulating the sort of good guys all along and has a nefarious reason (of course) for doing so.

The special effects end up providing much of the focus of the movie in lieu of a more coherent plot.  Some of the special effects are very good, such as the bizarre image of the Nautilus sailing the canals of Venice.  The destruction of Venice by underwater bombs is standard fare by today's standards.  The other special effects vary in their quality and effect on the viewer, but are generally good.  As noted before, the special effects often substitute for plot.

Though some of my criticisms are not encouraging, I actually liked the movie.  As a B movie it is okay.  Clearly not in the league of movies such as The Lord of the Rings, it is nonetheless a rousing adventure.  In general the movie rates 3 stars, but I'm giving it 4 stars because of the three actors that really made this movie for me:  Connery, Wilson and Shah.",1072656000,64,3459,4.707154742096506
1481407,4,B00005JM5B,I guess before I watched the movie I expected nothing much because of the reviews. It was not as bad as some made it sound but come on we are not going to enjoy every movie we see although that would be nice. see the movie and judge for yourself,1072656000,,245,3.92
1481408,4,B00005JM5B,"This is a very good treatment of some of our literary heroes AND villains. Lots of action, a good premise and a decent - if somewhat flawed - story. If you get this expecting Victorian Literature based on the characters, you'll be disappointed.
Let's face it, you're going to be watching a film where some of the main characters are a vampire, an invisible man and Dorian Gray, so don't expect an exact adherence to what was really possible in the 1890's.
Yes, I do believe that if they're using the vampire legend they should go all-out and stick to it. And I would've written Dorian's final scene differently and added a bit of subterfuge - but they didn't ask me. Ever see a movie in which you liked EVERYTHING? That's pretty rare.
Overall, it's a great flick with tremendous effects, (LOVED the Hyde/Mirrors bit), lots of action and some very visually stimulating scenes.",1072656000,4,875,4.688311688311688

The league looked kinda interesting but it's a bunch of show-offs. Car with headlight on Vernice streets? C'mon, give me a break. The dialogue is appropriate with the scene of 19th century, but it looks like all the ""Mr, Mrs"" things make the film more boring. The Idian-look dude (a pirate?) with the blade-shaped Nautilus sub almost made me laugh coz it's too lame! I should have listened to advices from those who actually paid their hard-earned cash for viewing it in theater here when I bought the DVD.

1481412,1,B00005JM5B,"You know, I somehow got it into my head that Sean Connery was a ""classy actor"". This, despite the fact that ""classy"" and ""actor"" should never be used in the same sentence, much like ""clam"" and ""chowder"" or ""ginsu"" and ""hamster"". It is apparent that actors in general, and Sean Connery in specific, will do absolutely anything for money. This includes, in Sean Connery's case, starring in an embarassment like The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Having seen too many movies like this, I'm not sure that the standards of the average actor are particularly different than the standards of the average prostitute. To get through this movie, Sean must have had to close his eyes and say ""This one is for the summer home in Morocco"" over and over again. Judging by the look on his face through most of the movie, I don't think it helped.

The movie is a quick and dirty study in form over substance. All dialogue is one-liners, with lots of epic camera sweeps and over-the-top music (don't get me started on the state of mind of the average soundtrack composer). There's lots of fireballs and quickee sentimentality - the sort that resembles trying to pants a woman on her first date, at the restaraunt, in front of a very embarassed waiter.

Each character is supposed to be from 19th century science fiction, but that mostly relates to the choice of names, since your average movie-goer knows as much about the 19th century as they do about world geography (hint: Norway is not in Central America). When did Dorian Gray become an adept fencer, unable to look at his painted portrait? When did vampires start flying with thousands of bats behind them? When did Captain Nemo become a Sikh? It doesn't matter, since the main business of movie-making these days is to rape the intellectual property of those who can't speak for themselves anymore (e.g. J.R.R. Tolkien). Mostly, this movie does the things it does because it CAN. That's about the only excuse they have, and it's not a very good one.",1072569600,,1993,4.740634005763689

I liked this movie.  It was full of action,had some great special effects and I liked seeing characters come alive that I have read about through the years. I found it very entertaining!

1481414,4,B00005JM5B,"I really enjoyed this movie. I know it's following on the heels of other big comic book/graphic novel successes, like X-Men, Spiderman, Blade, and the others, but it's still a fun movie. The various literary characters were interesting, and together they had a variety of talents that the actors brought out well.
There are a few inconsistencies in the movie that I caught the second time I watched it that bothered me a little. Mina Harker is a vampire, or at least appears to be one, but she's out in broad daylight in more than one occasion, which is something vampires traditionally can't do. Mr. Hyde lets out a yell while under water, yet we see no bubbles escape his mouth. And the citizens of Venice are celebrating Carnival in July, when it's traditionally celebrated in February. However, I can dismiss them as nothing major.
One thing I was pleased of was the lack of major plot holes. The characters are interesting, although if you didn't have at least a little back story for all of them you'd probably be quite lost. To make up for that the movie moves quickly, there are seldom any long scenes, and it feels like they trimmed the movie down to its bare essentials.
The DVD has decent extra features, the making of feature runs for quite a while, if you tell it to play all for all the bits, and the deleted scenes are interesting. However there are two things that bring the DVD itself down for me. First, there's no trailer. I like having the trailer on the DVD. And second, there's an ""important message"" on the DVD that is really out of place, and in my opinion, inappropriate. It's a public service announcement about smoking marijuana and how it causes fatal accidents. Not only is it out of place (there's no drug use outside of Dr. Jeckyll's potions), but it cheapens the message by making itself out to be something it's not. If it was titled PSA or something identifying it, I wouldn't have minded it so much. Heck, I wouldn't have minded it if it was an anti-piracy PSA, but it was out of place.",1072569600,,2021,4.53972602739726

It seems this movie was rushed due to the gaping plot holes, average fx, and blindingly quick action scenes (so much is happening all at once you can barely tell WHAT is going on).  Given maybe better direction and a lengthier script and production, this could've been a really neat franchise.  Another in the long list of 'no brainer' adaptations (comic book or otherwise) that if the filmmakers had stuck closer to the source material, should've had a fun and entertaining blockbuster.

Trevor Jones' score was brilliant, too.  It's mindless, confusing at times, but as far as ""comic book"" adventures go, it's a great way to spend a couple hours.

Forget that Tom Sawyer serves no purpose at all except eye candy (and not very good eye candy..sorry ladies).  Forget that some of these characters are suppose to be dead and have zero explaination as to why they are not.  Forget that Mr. Hyde looks like Hulk's retarded little brother,  Forget that the Nautilis is way too big to rise up from the docks, sail the Venice canals, or even the ocean.  Forget that Mina can walk during the daylight hours.  Forget that Dorian Gray was not invincible and that he could never die by simply looking at his painting.  Just forget all of that and eveything else.  I know it's a hard task to do, which is why this movie is a flop.  But still it's quite enjoyable, I like the action, Dorian Gray was my favorite character.  Alot of things had me going WTF?! (not in a good way) but other than that I did manage to enjoy myself.  The sets are beautiful.  Car chase in venice?  LOL!!!  Shame, this movie could have been good.  All they had to do was take the already written script point out all the mistakes (lines and all) and do the opposite.  Flesh out the characters more instead of having them be the background for Sean Connery, don't go overboard on the SFX.  Bam problem solved and you have a great movie.  But this is one of those mindless enjoyable flicks that will soon be forgotten.

Stuart Townsend (Queen of the Damned) is the best thing about the movie as Dorian Grey.  He has the best lines and he has fun in the part as well.

I think the people responsible for this flick, needs to take that film and see literary fictional characters brought to ""life"" and how to handy a good fantasy Adventure.  The more I thought about it, the more I saw the films had a lot in common.  Won't blow the punchline, but if you have seen both films you will understand, they share a common character.
I love Connery and REALLY wanted to love this film.  I can say I sort of liked it...but that is the strongest emotion evoked by the film, outside of confusion.  This movie had SO much going for it.  A super premise and the promise of a thinking-man's fantasy-adventure flick.  I mean I shall watch Connery in anything; he has a handsome and capable cast backing him, some great special effects...but someone needed to give them a road map!!
It was written sharply, with good dialogue sprinkled here and there, and nice touches like the ""You may call me Ishmael"" the chauffeur.  Filmed with rich detail (a little darkly - sometimes you really had a hard time seeing what is happening!).  Movie opens in 1899 where London Peelers are being chased by a Tank.  Suddenly, the Bank of England is looted.  The Brits blame the Germans in ""pre war mentality"". But we know there is a criminal mastermind with futuristic toys and he is not playing fair.  Cut to a man calling himself M (double joke here!) recruiting Allan Quartermaine to head the League.  On the team is Mina Harker, the Invisible Man, Dorian Grey, Dr. Jekyll and his alter ego, Captain Nemo and Tom Sawyer.  Supposedly, some voodoo witchdoctor cursed Connery, and Africa will never let him die so, he, too share special powers.
While the idea of superheroes from Literature coming together to battle the Phantom (whose real identity is elementary!)is engaging, there is no real set up for it happening - just IS.  Maybe they expect you to know from the comics?  Well, excuse me, there is a vast audience out there that does not!!  From that point on there is not pace, it is pedal to the metal now stop action.  The action is filmed great - even the car chase through Venice?? Highways?  I presume there was explanation for this that ended up on the cutting room floor.
In the end, you are left going is that all there is?  Back to my original point, the seed is much like Young Sherlock Holmes, but there fantasy/fiction merger came to life with such brilliance.

1481462,4,B00005JM5B,"This is a movie about a very unlikely group of heroes and superheroes that must join each other to win a battle against an evil madman and save the world from his malevolent, ultimate-destruction plan. This movie is a must for readers of classic literature since its main characters are:
*Allan Quatermain from the novel ""King Solomon's Mines"" by H. Rider Haggard
*Captain Nemo from ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" by Jules Verne
*The Invisible Man from ""The Invisible Man"" by H. G. Wells
*Wilhelmina Harker from ""Dracula"" by Bram Stoker
*Dorian Gray from ""The Portrait of Dorian Gray"" by Oscar Wilde
*Tom Sawyer from ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn"" by Mark Twain
*Dr. Jeckyll from ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" by Robert Louis Stevenson
For all of you who don't know who these characters are and have never read the original ""League of Extraordinary Gentleman"" graphic novels by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill, if you really want to enjoy this movie as much as I did, you probably should read some of these classic novels first.
The plot is a very old and tried one, which has been re-done in this movie surprisingly well. Although you shouldn't expect many unanticipated twists in the story, do look for enjoyable references to other novels like: ""Crimes of the Rue Morgue"" by Edgar Allan Poe, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" by Gaston Leroux and ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, among others. It even pays homage to Ian Fleming's 007 (James Bond) characters and Sir Sean Connery himself, as it includes a short banter with two characters named M and Q.
The direction and editing of the movie is good, the story is coherent and follows a reasonable path so you won't be disappointed, the characters and their dialogues are right on target, and the setting, costumes and actor's performances are great. There are only two reasons why I give this movie only four stars: first, some very bad special effects (although, most of them are superb and it's a treat to watch how these were done on the Special Features) and second, a not-so-unexpected ending that yells, ""Sequel, sequel, sequel!""

1481465,3,B00005JM5B,"Some projects misfire. More often than not its due to ego or an inability to admit that a project you've labored so long and hard on is less than it could be. Such is the curse of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Based on a graphic novel written by the talented Alan Moore (Watchmen), League is less than the sum of its parts. There were times that the plot reeked of an old poorly written episode of The Wild, Wild West while at other times it was stirring entertainment.

A masked madman going by the nom de plume of The Phantom has been using his army and machines to break into the best guarded banks of Europe. He's looting Europe in order to prove his power and then sell his machines to the highest bidders. His hope is that chaos and war will dominate Europe allowing him to have the world's nation's at his feet.

Well known explorer Alan Quatermain is contacted by a member of Her Majesty's Government. It seems the Crown wants to lure Quatermain out of retirement from the beautiful plains of Africa. Quatermain at first refuses; he's tired of burying friends and lovers and has chosen a life without adventure. When thugs show up and try to murder Quatermain, he's in.

He arrives in London at the secret headquarters of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. He meets ""M"" the director of Her Majesty's Secret Service (nice touch and reference to Connery's Bond past). ""M"" explains that this group has served Her Majesty secretly over the decades. The Phantom plans on attacking a meeting of the heads of state of various European countries. The meeting will take place in Venice within less than a week.

Quatermain is the lynchpin in this new incarnation of the League. His job is to recruit the best with unusual abilities to stop the Phantom. Already recruited are Mina Harker and The Invisible Man. Harker's ability as a chemist makes her a natural. Oh, and she's a vampire as well. She only wants to use her abilities for the good fight. The Invisible Man, well he's not the original but he's got more personality; he's a pickpocket and a feisty man who loves dropping his trousers. The most mysterious is the brilliant Captain Nemo. Nemo's swordmanship, distaste for war and scientific brilliance make him a natural for the League. Quatermain may not care all too much for his new partners but he knows his duty and they travel off in to recruit two more members. From here the team recruits Dorian Gray, Mr. Hyde and Tom Sawyer.

The film starts boldly and with a striking scene involving exploding zepplins and a massive war machine attacking the Bank of England. The scenes involving Connery at the beginning are also quite striking but the narrative loses some of its steam after they recruit all the members of the team.

One of the weaknesses of the film is its narrative. The screenplay is like a wild amausement ride--upon closer examination you wonder what all the fuss was about.  The sequence in Venice is visually striking but the CGI work doesn't quite live up to expectations. Nor do the CGI sequences involving Mr. Hyde. Like The Hulk, it's clear he's computer generated. That wouldn't be the problem but the texture of the skin and the character just doesn't look believeable.

On the plus side, the film captures some of the best elements of Moore's story but misses much of his magic. It's like a cake that doesn't rise; you know you took all the right steps and prepared everything the right way. You also know something was missing but can't quite figure out what. Perhaps the most important and vital element was any sort of character development. These characters are sketched in. Sure, it's based on a graphic novel (or comic book take your pick) but the best comic book adaptions (X-Men, Spiderman, Superman)do spend the time to develop the characters. Instead, the various characters explain why other characters behave the way they do. We should be able to observe it and not have it explained to us.

The action sequences are well directed and many of the visuals are stunning. When Connery is on screen the film does gel more often than not through the sheer force of his charisma. Many of the cast also give it their best particularly the actor playing the mysterious, moody Captain Nemo. It's very clear that there was quite a bit of compromise and conflict around the making of this film. It would go a long way to explain the ambitious scope of the story and the limited way it is told.

While it doesn't quite live up to its promise, League is an entertaining diversion with a number of twists and (some unbelievable) turns. I'm surprised that the film director's chose not to involve Sherlock Holmes in the film. Then again, Holmes would have figured out the mystery at the heart of the film within five minutes.

Although it isn't completely successful, League manages to capture the audience's attention. When at its best, League manages to overcome the shortcomings in opticals, story and direction.  Connery's famous charisma manages to salvage much of the film and the rest of the performers turn in marvelously detailed moments.",1071792000,4,5093,4.729425028184893

1481468,4,B00005JM5B,"Suffice it to say that a team of Victorian-era literary heroes (a hunter, a vampire, an invisible man, Dr. Jeckyl/Mr. Hyde, an indestructable man, Captain Nemo and - Tom Sawyer) get together to fight a bad guy called ""Fantom"". He supposedly wants to start a war in Europe to make money selling high-tech (by 1899 standards) weapons like tanks, body armor and machine guns. Alas, it's all mainly a ruse just to steal the heroes superpowers (something you may not get unless you listen to the commentary track).
If you can forget the hard-to-understand story and just dwell on the eye-popping visuals, it's a more enjoyable experience. The characters in the movie are interesting group of what-ifs:
1) What if Alan Quartermain, the original Indiana Jones, was part of a team instead of being on his own...
2) What if a (woman) vampire decided to fight on the side of good...
3) What if a thief stole the invisible man's formula and couldn't benefit from it conventionally...
4) What if a man who can't die must be killed...
5) What if Captain Nemo was swashbuckling Indian man...
6) What if Dr. Jeckyl's alterego, the brutish Mr. Hyde, could direct his energy towards fighting bad guys (instead of harrassing women)...
7) What if the writer Tom Sawyer went to the Old West, learned how to be a gunfighter, and then ended up in Europe for some reason...
The best parts were:
1) Mr. Hyde (think ""Hulk"" lite) and a totally outrageous Mr. Hyde #2 (a different guy - think ""Hulk"" on steroids) get into a huge building-crunching fight.
2) Much of Venice Italy gets destroyed until the League crew step in to dramatically stop a supposed domino-effect (which wasn't really occuring - the buildings were simply collapsing).
3) Capt. Nemo has an ornately designed,900-foot ""Nautilus"" submarine (that's nuclear powered) AND a 6-wheeled automobile, that both come in handy.
4) The final battle scenes between the good and the bad guys incorporated just about every fighting technique and special effect that exists.
The worst part was simply trying to follow what was going on and figuring out why they were doing certain things. It's one of those movies you have to watch many times to understand it, but you won't have that much patience if the movie doesn't grab you the first time.
You could call this movie a thinking man's version of ""X-Men"" if you take the ""thinking"" reference with a grain of salt. It's more sophisticated, but less satisfying.",1071619200,5,2439,4.823389021479714
1481469,2,B00005JM5B,"This movie has an interesting premise and to be fair it did not bore me to death, but the plot seemed poorly thought out and slapped together in order to meet a deadline.  The villian is very cartoonish and it motivated by the usual desire to rule the world.  The choice of league members is odd as well.  Some have extrordinary powers (immortality, invisiblity, great strength), while others are ordinary (Alan Quartermaine played by Sean Connery and the U.S. agent Sawyer).  Speaking of Connery, he is way too old to be playing an action hero and his fight scenes were lame and unbelievable.  Despite all these flaws, the worst aspect of the movie was the poorly done computer generated imagery.  The Nautilus looked like a cartoon and its movement through the water was unrealistic.  The worst example was Mr. Hyde, who looked bloated and plastic-like.  Much like the Hulk, Mr. Hyde was made too big, and the computer was unable to generate enough texture on his skin to make him look believable.  They should have limited his appearances to brief glimpses in low light to mask these deficiencies.  Overall this was a disappointing movie.",1071619200,,1141,4.835051546391752
1481470,3,B00005JM5B,"I don't think I've seen a movie where it's so hard to find an agreeable review... Well at least the people whom hate it can't agree on what makes it bad.... And I think that says a lot. The reviews that say the Quartermain character is a ripoff of Indiana Jones was particularly amusing since Lucas and Spielberg themselves state those flicks were based off the OG Quartermain character... Well that's what too much Eminem music and a lack of reading will do to you I guess.
I keep hearing ""not enough characterization"", or ""too much characterization, I read all the books, I feel insulted!""
Well, to put these main charcters from all the books into a movie, and to give a thorough rundown of each... Would make one of the LOTR extended cuts seem like a commercial break. And those who read all the books didn't take note that there are some differences from the OG sources... Namely the Invisible Man who in the movie states he's not the original one. So thoe ones at least should go back to the library!
No one can agree on the CGI either... I'm still waiting to hear or read a universal agreement about the quality of CGI in a movie. Any movie that uses it there's always people that love it and hate it. IMO it looks about par for the course.
I will agree on the too hectic editing in fight scenes. particularly the library one is bad. By the last third of the movie though they seem to have found a good pace.
I haven't read the comics to fairly compare, but having read all the classics save for The Picture Of Dorian Gray (Which I will now be making a prority to read), I really liked to see these characters brought together like a superhero group in the vein of Justice League Of America or The Defenders... Calling it an Xmen ripoff is kinda wrong, considering none of these heroes are mutants. In fact at least a couple of them are probably too human for some to appreciate in this day and age.
At best though LXG is a little bit above a mediocre action film.  But it's far superior IMNSHO when compared to other recent DVD releases such as Tomb Radier 2 with it's snarling sharks, spastic flow, and drollest action movie ending in cinema history.

1481537,2,B00005JM5B,"Movies in the new millenium have benefited greatly from the technological advances of the digital age, and filmmaking forever changed with the infinite possibilties directors can use this new technology to enhance their movie and impress and dazzle the viewers. Yet there is a borderline that any director should not cross, no matter how excited he or she is by the new toys available to them, and that is plot and entertainment. When the use of digital effects takes priority at the expense of a coherent plot,then we,as an intelligent audience regardless of our age, background or tastes, have a problem.
This is exactly what happened with The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. The premise was good enough to start with:
a group of literary heroes spring to life to defend the world from a evil psycho,and the collection of these heroes is very interesting indeed, Allan Quatermain (an always excellent Sean Connery), Dorian Gray(Stuart Townsend),Tom Sawyer (Shane West), a sexy Vampire out of Van Helsing's entourage, Captain Nemo (the brilliant Naseeruddin Shah), Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde (Jason Fleming) and the invisible man.
Yet the non stop action was so digitilized that in some scenes, especially the underwater shots and the destruction of Venice I was not sure whether I was watching a normal film or an animated feature from Dreamworks!! You can really feel that director Stephen Norrington( Blade) has pushed the limits of what he can do technically, and loaded each scene with too much digital experimentation,and as the cliche goes about too much of anything, just half way through the movie these scenes stopped being impressive and became annoying.
It is time that the huge digital development in moviemaking SERVES the movie and not vice versa, for no matter how advanced we become, we, the viewers, will still need the simplest of all, a good story and plot and some good old entertainement.",1071187200,,1905,5.070063694267516

1481564,1,B00005JM5B,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie; it seemed very exciting and a great idea. Unfortunately, if the script fails to make the movie even remotely entertaining, even a great idea is completely wasted.
The idea of many different types of superheroes coming together has a lot of potential for the big screen. However, the producers must have known the movies blockbuster potential and decided that no thought whatsoever was needed to make a great film.
The plot on a whole is rather good, but each individual scene is so predictable you start to wonder if the whole movie was turned out by a couple of monkeys with typewriters.
The camera angles and sets are somewhat good but the way the characters are introduced to each other is so badly written that you feel like your watching a spoof murder-mystery. Sean Connery is fine as Alan Quartermain, but nothing special and yet, the producers wanted to show off their leading man and so the movie feels more like it's just about Connery and not about the league as a whole. He's upstaged by Jason Flemyng as Dr Jekyll / Mr Hyde, a more interesting character and more convincing in the role. Peta Wilson plays Mina Harker the (supposed to be) sexy female vampire; she is thoroughly unconvincing and leaves you cringing with embarrassment.
Lines like ""This is a nice place... Does Jack the Ripper live here?"" are so pointless and placed only to fill time between one predictable 'twist' in the story line to the next.
I went to see the film with my entire family, including my siblings' significant others, not one of us found the film worth watching.  I warn you - stay away.",1070150400,4,1634,4.673611111111111

1481566,2,B00005JM5B,"With Sean Connery appearing in roughly one film per two years, one would think he has the time, or at least would take an interest in choosing quality work. But alas, we are subjected to ""The Avengers,"" one of - if not the - worst film of the decade...and now...this? Hardly a bad motion picture, but then again, hardly an Academy Award Winner.
Believability isn't this film's strongest trait. I came close to recommending it a few times - I really did; I wanted to - but there was a particular scene involving a car chase through the streets of Venice (streets that, like the film critic Roger Ebert stated, do not even exist) that literally insulted my intelligence - at least, what little intelligence I have. I may not be the smartest person but by George I think that a bit more confidence in the audience's knowledge is in store.
Keep in mind that the year is 1899 - automobiles have hardly been invented - yet we are shown one zipping around at not 100 miles per hour, through streets that never - and don't - exist, past guards who can't seem to be able to shoot a cat off a flea's back at two yards, and through pillars and windy little crevices and who knows what else; and all the while this vehicle is being driven by a young American not twenty-four years old. I'm the last person to complain about believability - but this even pushed it for me. And I'm the guy who recommended ""Commando.""
Ah, yes, there is a plot behind this mess, but not a very smart one at all. Sean Connery plays Allan Quartermain. With the intended audience of this film obviously being little kids and rednecks living in their parents' basement in Louisiana with fourth grade educations (you know who you are), perhaps the filmmakers thought that they could dupe everyone into believing that Allan Quartermain is responsible in part for the creation of the quarter. Heck, for the heck of it, let's just say he is - we can't screw up facts any more than they already are!
Quartermain is like the father of Indiana Jones - oh, wait, didn't Connery play that part already? He's a legendary adventurer responsible for renowned events around the world - events never ventured into whatsoever. An emissary from England mentions he is the role model for all little boys and the focus of all their stories. Perhaps he meant to say the laughing stock. Who knows?
No, seriously, Quartermain has been invited to join ""The League of Extraordinary Gentleman,"" a league of gentlemen with extraordinary powers - ironically one is a woman. Perhaps a more appropriate - and yes, more marketable - title would have been ""The League of Extraordinary People Which May or May Not Include Hot Women."" It sure would be more marketable to the male teenagers out there, wouldn't it?
Also in the team are such daring and wonderful characters as Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah - say it ten times fast), a retired pirate; Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), a she-vampire; Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran), a British pickpocket with an obviously low IQ but yet a man who managed to dabble in invisibility, hardly an easy subject for those with simple minds, with strange results; Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), who you may remember is the man who remained at ease with his conscience through incidents relating to a portrait of his soul; Tom Sawyer (Shane West), one of them thar' American folk; and last, but certainly not least in terms of mass, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (Jason Flemyng and The Incredible Hulk), who bears a striking resemblance to both The Hulk and the nightclub gorilla from ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (1988) when morphed.
There are a lot of mistakes in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentleman,"" and not all of them have to do with geographical or factual errors. First of all, the characters from classic fiction are totally f****ed up. Since when was Dorian Gray invincible? In one scene he comes up with bullet holes through his body and he never even flinches. As far as I knew his mind was at rest with his actions in Oscar Wilde's classic tale, and his age remained permanent, but he was hardly ever indestructible; and the thing that got me the most was Mr. Hyde. Having read Robert Louis Stevenson's truly wonderful tale, I felt cheated by the character shown here - he looked like Shrek and a giant gorilla's offspring. Only uglier. I always got the idea from Stevenson's text that Mr. Hyde was a bit of a shy, awkward, short character who lurked in the shadows and had a disfigured face - this Mr. Hyde is just another special effects extravaganza who gets to wipe out hoards of enemy soldiers like bowling pins with one mighty swing of a forearm. And since when did he get to choose when he wanted to turn back into Dr. Jekyll? I always assumed it happened involuntarily...
To be honest, this isn't a terribly bad film, but there are a few low-points that, if they were combined together without the stretches of ""okay-ness"" in between, would result in one of the most horrific films of the last two decades. The movie insulted my intelligence many times, particularly with the Venice car chase, which played out more like a testosterone junkie's videogame dream rather than anything more intelligent. And then there are the disgraceful reinventions of some of the most beloved of all characters.
""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" boasts some extraordinary visual effects, but the rest of the film is anything but extraordinary. And I really felt cheated when I realized that Mr. Hyde was a big Hulk who could change back and forth voluntarily just like the former rather than being the darker, more disfigured character Stevenson envisioned. Some day they should get a good modern remake of the book with just enough visual effects to make him look terrifying but still somewhat human.

I mean, the comic book was really a fine read (though definitely of an adult nature, and meant for an audience more familiar with old world history), and it was a very different super-hero movie than some of the ones coming out at the time (such as Hulk, Daredevil, and recent things as that). I've been applauding Sean Connory for years and years now, so I had high expectations.
When actually watching the movie, it came across as decent, but it didn't inspire any emotional reaction at all. Honestly, this movie feels much older than it actually is.
The first thing that boggled my mind was the story premise itself...because they wildly veered away from the comic book story, and while this isn't necessarily a bad idea, they didn't do it well enough for it to come across well. The writing, the dialog, and the vast majority of the scenes felt like the writing done on them was amaturish.
I am an author myself, and thus I suppose I may take this more into account than is really necessary, but there is the opinion nonetheless.
They had some stupendous characters to work with, with histories and past stories, and great actors fleshing them out to boot. But as another reviewer said, up the page, the directing was a bit too heavy-handed and this shows.
I enjoyed seeing the characters walking, talking, and fighting because that just adds something to them when you've just read about it in a comic book. There was so much potential they could have tapped here, the vast majority of which they ignored or bumbled their way through.
Watch it, but I would suggest renting it. Watch it with as open a mind as possible, and then decide for yourself what you like or didn't like. I wasn't thrilled, but I'll buy this movie on DVD when I find it, and if I have the money lying around. But maybe that's just me... :)",1068768000,3,1868,4.529585798816568

The special effects were great and the acting was fine.  I have seen much worse movies do better at the box-office.  If you like fantasy and sci-fi movies you will like this one too.

It has plenty of action, a decent plot and enough momentum to keep you interested for the whole movie.  Granted some of it may seem unbelievable, but so what? Like Matrix is soo much cooler- the idea of superpowers while being plugged in to a computer.  These character in the League, are of old world panash, from a time without all the new world technology.  So all in all I really enjoyed the film.

With Sean Connery in the cast, I expected a lot out of this film, but it's got a bad script and the direction seemed more tailormade for special effects rather than the acting.  The humor in it sucks (example: Tom Sawyer is ""checking out"" the vampiress, and Allan says ""She's out of your league.""  League!  As in League of Extroadinary Gentlemen!""  HA.  Not funny.).  In fact, at the theater, PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING AT THESE DUMB JOKES.  As I said, the direction is horrid, which is even worse since it's the director of ""Blade"" (Stephen Norrington), and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Bland acting, average special effects, horrible script, heavyhanded direction, and ludicrous plot devices (how is a domino effect stopped by the destruction of ONE building??) all add up to one stupid film.  Watch other comic book films instead.  You might negatively vote, but chances are, you are out of MY league.  And my league is ultimate.",1068336000,8,973,4.7604790419161676

This has to be one of my favorite movies ever! It was so awesome, the special effects were great, I loved the story line, I loved everything about this movie, especially seeing Shane West, one of the hottest men to walk the planet. But anyways, back to my point, this movie was so great if you are looking for an action movie to watch. Plus, guys and girls will actually love this movie together. It has the action, hot Shane West, great lines, fantastic effects, etc, etc, etc! I loved this movie and don't let what people say on this review board discourage you from buying this! They are all people with really high expectations, probably wanting some huge movie like The Matrix (which also happens to be a great movie too). And for all of the people who were disappointed about it being different from the comic book, I know how you feel. I saw Harry Potter and was sooo mad because it had some differences, but you will live, trust me. Open your minds and just think of it as if the book didn't exist. ~LaNa~",1068076800,4,1196,4.32

The actors were all superb and outstanding, especially Peta Wilson - the sexy vampiress! She brought a significant amount of life to an otherwise very dull movie. All of the actors were believable and great in their roles. Unfortunately that was not enough to make the movie interesting. The plot is too unrealistic, even for an action movie and seems to plod along endlessly until you can't wait for it to end. This movie was quite a snorefest and I doubt I will be purchasing the DVD when it becomes available. The best part of the movie next to Peta Wilson's performance was the ending.

The only attributes the film retains are the period, the plot summary (at a very simplified level) and the basic cast of characters. If you're expecting the characterization of the literary comic figures, well that isn't happening either.
The best I can about this film is that I was not disappointed. There's plenty of action, a surprise bad guy, and some pretty spiffy special fx.
Watch it as a no-expectations thriller with a twist and you'll do fine. Taken on its own merits, it's a decent way to while away an hour or two.",1067731200,,682,4.5528455284552845

It was obviously made for a quick buck, focusing on the action part of the movie, they made the villain absolutely ridiculous, and because the Great 'I'm so awesome and need to play the male role' Sean Connery funded the movie, he was made into the leader of the team, and in a disgrace to Mina, she was thrust into the stereotypical female of the group that every other male needs to be attracted to. The effects were awful, and nevermind breaking every rule of common logic of the Venice scene(I won't spoil).

Though the primary figures are distorted a bit from the original charactures they are still close enough for the viewer to recognize.  You will be surprised to realize the they are, at times, much more believable than ever before. You will be fascinated all over again by Captain Nemo and Dorian Grey,  chuckle at the sometimes warped earthy humor of the Invisible man, and cheer at the heroic actions of Alan Quartermain and Mark Twain. But, most of all you will sit back and enjoy the twists and turns of a thrilling adventure.
If you are looking for a laser show and space ships, buy a ticked for Star Wars, you will get your adventure fix there without trying to hard to determine who the bad guys are, they are the ones in black.  But, if you are looking for a taste of adventure and excitement that will hold your interest, tantilize your memory and actually make your brain work trying to figure out who the real bad guys are, look no further.

1481629,4,B00005JM5B,"The Critics seem unanimous in their dislike of 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', although they can't seem to agree upon why exactly it is bad.  Some critics dislike the 'alternative geography' of Venice; Some dislike the incoherent plot, while others seem to think the usage of Oscar Wilde, Arthur Conan Doyle and HG Wells characters in an action flick is an outrage.  They are all missing the point.
Based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore (of which I've only read the first part yet), The league of Extraordinary Gentlemen has the coolest concept I've seen in the movies for a long, long time - I can't think of any movie since 'Memento' which had such a cool central idea - it takes all the classic heroes of Victorian literature and turns them into heroes in a wild, James Bond-esque action adventure.  Although the adaptation stays away from the plot of the comic, it maintains the spirit of outrageous fun, which makes this one of the most entertaining movies Hollywood has produced lately, like Pirates of the Caribbean and Terminator 3.
After a tank rolls into the Bank of England, the movie splits into three main section.  First, we have a near flawless introduction of the characters, from the retired Allan Quatermain(Sean Connery), through The Invisible Man (Tony Curran), Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), Mina Harker(of Dracula fame, portrayed by Peat Wilson)  Durian Grey (introduced in the film's finest action sequence, and brilliantly played by Stuart Townsend), the improbable Tom Sawyer (Shane West), who should have been in his 80s in 1899.  The sequence culminates in the appearance of the film's most fantastic character, the CGI created Nautilus.
After picking up Dr Jekyl (Jason Flemyng), and his alter ego Mr. Hyde (accurately described by Roger Ebet as a ""WWF version of Fat Bastard""), the middle section of the film involved an unlikely but well executed chase sequence in Venice (yes, you couldn't drive a car there, nor could a ship the size of the Nautilus really navigate in it, but that's trivial nitpicking, in my view), a betrayal, and a clever combination of exposition and sabotage, in the best homage to camp.
The final part of the film is a traditional ""scale the bad guy's castle"" sequence in snowy Mangolia, which is saved from mediocrity by the fine acting all around, and by several meaty scenes, like a confrontation between two main characters, which gives tribute to the book the villain came from.
The film is not without problems.  The plot is overly cliche, and could have used some more meat.  Much early banter, especially between Quatermain and Mina Harker, clearly reflects earlier versions of the story which stayed closer to the original version.  The Hyde and Jekyl characters are not dealt with particularly well, and the Nemo role is underwritten.  The worst part, though, is the treatment of the mysterious M, by far the highlight of the graphic novel, which is completely ruined in the film.
Yet in the end, none of these problems matter.  Fun all the way through, 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', is an exciting adventure story, where the brilliance of the concept far overshadows any weaknesses in the plot.",1066435200,3,3183,4.953095684803002
1481630,4,B00005JM5B,"As others before me have said, LXG has recieved a lot of undeserved negative reviews. I went along, and I had never read the book before, or seen any movies or the like. I came out of the theatre itching to go see a sequel (As they left room for one) The special effects were of the same standard as the Matrix, and the characters were portrayed beautifully. I especially liked Mina Murray, (Played by Peta Wilson ... I think) a damsel fallen victim to Dracula. Sean Connery played his character to be plausible of such wonderful feats and even the Invisible Man was a clever adaptation. The special effects, as I said, were that of Matrix standard, particulary the detail of the effects, eg. being able to see the other side of the Invisible Man's mask, and the other, bigger effects. I won't give away the plot, there are some flaws with it, but they were masked by the wonderful performance of the actors. I thought that the collection of legendary characters in the one film was a fantastic idea.
Just a quick run down of the characters - 1) the hunter, Allan Quartermain
2) Dorian Gray, the undead
3) The Invisible Man AKA Skinner
4) Mina Murray, the widowed Dracula victim come feminist
5) Captain Nemo, the transportation and sword specialist
6) Tom Sawyer - the die hard, trigger happy Yank
7) Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde, the bad turned good, half evil, half angellic (You don't QUITE know what he is) do-gooder
and the resident evil 8) the 'Phantom'
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and recommend it to people ages 3 and up, *It's on my box* (Toy Story) Seriously ... no one younger than 10, as there are some pretty dark scenes",1065916800,4,1641,4.5286195286195285
1481681,3,B00005JM5B,"I hear many people saying ""the original comic (or graphic novel) is better"" and though I never read it, I believe them.  Like ""From Hell"" which is also based on the work of original writer Alan Moore, ""LXG"" suffers from muddled storytelling that goes from one big BANG-action to another bigger BANG, killing every merit of the film.  Though ""LXG"" is always great to see, and still an entertaining piece of work you will see in summer at local multiplex, its result is nothing remarkable.
Before you see it, I have to say part of the film would offend some people who love reading classics.  The story involves ""extraordinary gentlemen"" in Western literary history, namely, Allan Quatermain, Captain Nemo, Mina Harker (from ""Dracula""), Dr. Jekyll (or his alter ego), Dorian Gray, Rodney Skinner (aka. The Invisible Man) and Tom Sawyer.  They are assembled under command of the British government's agent ""M,"" and are going to stop the secret plot planned by one evil genius ""Phantom.""  And Mina is supposed to have had a romantic relationship with Dorian.  Don't say that in your English class.  Your teacher might not find it amusing.
The premise is wonderful and more intelligent than you can expect from regular Hollywood films.  Actually, there are many references to classic novels (mainly written in the latter half of 19th century), so when Nemo's chief assistant appears, he gives a quip: ""Call me Ishmael.""  For those who say the famous detective from Baker Street is missing in the list above, well, you will eventually know that his story is not totally forgotten.
However ... yes, inspite of these interesting premise, ""LXG"" sinks deep into the sea with its unbelievably unwise choice of story and setting.  I only quote one example.  These gents (and a lady) goes to Venice, to stop the sabotage planned by Phantom.  Good.  And they go there by Nemo's submarine.  OK, but when you see that huge sub sneaks (literally) into the canals of the city, we start to doubt our eyes.  And then Tom Sawyer wildly drives a car in the street of Venice, and the villains start to attack with machine guns as if the film is ""SWAT,"" we are left speechless.  So, what is the point of making the 19th century background after all?
The actions are not bad, nor great either, so don't expect much from that.  Still it must be said when the actors are allowed to show some tricks, the film is certainly engaging.  Sean Connery is as charismatic as ever, and Shane West (""A Walk to Remember"") fits the role of youngster who finds a father-son relation with Connery.  Mina Harker's Peta Wilson is also fascinating as blood-sucking vampire, and Nasseruddin Shah plays the role of Nemo quite effectively with dignity.
In short, there is nothing extradordinary about ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" except for great production designs, and its photography (the latter by Dan Laustsen, ""Mimic"").  Not bad as critics say, but if you want really extraordinary people's story which is well-told, you can see ""X-Men.""",1065830400,3,3007,4.870333988212181
1481682,5,B00005JM5B,"while others view this movie as stale, I myself found it to be intriguing.  The plot twist and turns in a very unexpected way.  Sean Connery was exactly who he's supposed to be, a man who lived his life fast and furious and all he wants to do now is relax, but he can't.
Just when you think you know whats going on, it changes, but for the good.
The graphics are outstanding and the overall plot of the movie is exceptional.",1065830400,3,424,4.158536585365853
1481683,3,B00005JM5B,"In order to be a bit more fair to the film, I decided to judge it as a standalone work, and not a spinoff of the great comic. That being said, the film does serve its' purpose. It's a better than average comic book adapatation. However, adaptation is the key word here, because while some of the characters from the series are here, and the time period intact, the film's is indeed it's own story.
For those unfamiliar with the comic series, I will provide a bit of background. In 1999 Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill, two famous comic authors/illustrators came up with a phenomenal idea for a new comic. Comibining characters from classic English literature of the 19th century, the two men formed what could be described as the first X-Men, each character had a certain skill, but also a dark past.
The characters featured in the book were the famous hunter/adventurer Alan Quatermain, Dracula victim Mina Harker (going by her maiden name of Murray,) Dr. Henry Jekyll and his alter-ego Edward Hyde, and the Invisible Man, Hawley Griffin.
In keeping with my own belief that you should never give too much away in a review, I will not give any details of either plot away. I will go so far as to say that despite the movie's differences from the book, it was still enjoyable.
I always enjoy seeing Sean Connery on screen, and although he is getting a bit old for the fight scenes, he does hold his own quite well.
If you're a big fan of action films it's definitely worth adding to your collection.  For the rest, it's a renter.",1065484800,,1525,4.545454545454546
1481684,1,B00005JM5B,"How disappointing.  This movie could have been great.  The writing was poor, the editing uneven, and much of the acting was lackluster, especially considering what the cast could have accomplished with the right script and director.  The only bright spots were the actors: Sean Connery, who did what he could with what he had; Jason Flemyng and his partly convincing torment; Shane West (the most believable next to Connery) as a cocky youth.  I expected much much more from Peta Wilson, who intrigued me as La Femme Nikita, but was relegated to the role of obligatory chick--and played it that way--in this movie.  Stuart Townsend uttered perhaps one line with credible delivery; the rest of his performance was overblown.  Moriarty/M was see-through; who didn't see that coming?  Sadly, as is the case so often, the preview for LXG was better than the actual product.  This movie is best when placed to one side and quietly forgotten, unless you're into special effects created for the sake of spectacle and seemingly inserted wherever the director felt the movie needed a little pick-me-up.",1065312000,2,1093,5.033333333333333
1481685,3,B00005JM5B,"During the summer of 2003, there were three movies in particular I was looking forward to: Terminator 3, Pirates of the Caribbean, and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (hereto referred as LXG). The latter two, in particular, as both would be released in the same week and, from what I gathered in their respective trailers, harkened to the summer blockbuster I enjoy the most, the ""Spielbergian"" adventure.
By that, I mean the grand escapism that was virtually created by Raiders of the Lost Ark, later to be surpassed only by its second sequel, The Last Crusade. As of right now, none of the Jones flicks have ever been matched in sheer exhilaration. I look upon the trilogy as the three greatest and most purely enjoyable action movies ever made. Pirates and LXG both seemed to be striving for the same sense of fun, and I watched the former film first, left bitterly disappointed (though it's not a bad movie and it's one I'll probably give another look), then decided for some down time before I'd see LXG, much of that having to do with the dreadful reviews it'd been receiving from even typically ""lenient"" critics (Berge Garabedian, AKA Joblo, gave it a 4/10).
Having just seen it, I found myself surprised by some aspects and not so surprised by others. It's got a totally unspectacular story, sort of a James Bond-style plot about a madman who wants to start a world war so he can reap the profits. Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery) is brought in to form an ""extraordinary"" team of unique individuals to stop the villain. Among the league include Tom Sawyer, the Invisible Man, Mina Harker, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, Captain Nemo, and Dorian Gray, the latter of whom being the only literary character I'm entirely unfamiliar with.
LXG grossed just a little under 70 million dollars, and while not entirely a paltry sum, it's a lot less than I was expecting, even if the movie was as bad as most critics made it out to be. The trailers and concept, after all, wisely appealed to two crowds, Indiana Jones-style adventure lovers and superhero/comic book fans. I'm thinking, perhaps, the Indy crowd was turned off by the teamwork and special powers while the superhero crowd probably preferred their heroes more modern, or less ""literature-ish.""
Whatever the reason, I'm sure LXG is still destined for a reasonably-sized fanbase in the years to come, whether or not it's actually deserving of it. When all is said and done, LXG is nothing more than a ludicrous movie that entertained me somewhat for the duration of its fairly short running time (which I'm a bit thankful for, after sitting through the bloated Pirates of the Caribbean). Though I realize the movie has its roots and origins in a comic book, there's a lot here that's difficult to swallow. Too much, in fact, but I'll give a few examples.
For one, when it's discovered who the traitor is (spoiler warning), and it turns out it's the guy who formed the League in the first place, his reasons behind his actions make no sense. He claims he created the group so that he could steal their powers, but with the ""spy"" he had working for him, he could just as easily have accomplished his task without forming the league. Captain Nemo's submarine varies in size the same way Godzilla did, and the sub even manages to squeeze into the Venice canal. Connery's Quatermain is in amazingly great shape for a man of his age, able to leap off a moving car with no repercussions (and lands on his two feet without a hitch, no less!). Mina Harker, a vampire, is able to walk around in broad daylight.
I realize these kinds of movies are made for pure, unpretentious fun, and LXG at least has the action and f/x to back it up. The film is packed to the brim with gun battles and all-out brawls, and despite way too much rapid cutting from director Stephen Norrington, the action scenes are pretty fun to watch, if never truly rousing in the same fashion all the action from the Indiana Jones trilogy was. I was also impressed by a lot of the visual effects, particularly the Mr. Hyde creation, which is as at least as convincing as the Hulk.
Unfortunately, the cast mostly failed to impress me, probably the movie's damning fault. While Sean Connery is every bit as charismatic as ever, everyone else is clearly under his shadow. Only Shane West as the cocky, but likeable Tom Sawyer and Jason Flemying as Jekyll hold their own. Peta Wilson's Mina Harker is uninteresting, Stuart Townsend is what Johnny Depp would be if he were a bland actor (though, to be fair, Depp is a vanilla plain performer when he's playing non-eccentric roles), and Tony Curran's only noteworthy for sounding exactly like Jason Statham.
I suppose, in the end, LXG is a reasonably fun, but singularly idiotic experience. With a better script, this could have been an adventure movie for the ages, not just a middling timewaster. As of now, I'm still hoping for the best from the soon-to-be fourth Indiana Jones film, which could bring the movie that brings that grand escapist Saturday Matinee style serial back into fashion.

In Oscar Wilde's novel, Dorian was not immortal- he simply did not age.  All of the effects of his sinful and degenerate lifestyle were relayed to his portrait.  If someone shot him, he would probably die- why was he so afraid of James Vane?  Simply looking at his portrait would not kill him.  I would have liked to see Dorian Gray's story treated in its own movie; it's such a neglected subject.  It's a shame Henry Wotton has been lying silent as a character for so long ... he's the best Mephistopheles adaptation I have ever read.  Besides the plot, the effects were substandard and the dialogue- not to par for Extraordinary Gentlemen.

I was cracking up pretty much the whole time in the theater.  I mean, Dorian Gray and Mina Harker, how cool is that?  I love how she embodies the whole Victorian woman issue, getting more and more disheveled as the plot progresses.  (Stuart Townsend is great as the slick sexy rather villanous type and the vampire Lestat (Queen of the Damned) and Dorian Gray do have a lot in common!  Peta Wilson is awesome, as she is in Nikita). And Tom Sawyer of the Secret Service...Maybe Mr. Hyde was a bit over the top, but Jekyll was right on the mark, I think.  And when M revealled his identity, oh dear, I was laughing...it was a lot of fun, really.

1481689,4,B00005JM5B,"...P>League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, or LXG is sort of a rip off of the X men, but it also had more background than a comic book (LXG was based on a graphic Novel).  LXG also has some scenes that remind me of scenes in the Lord of the Rings movies.  This movie is set at the turn of the century, in the 1890s. A threat to the world had developed from a character named the Phantom who would build machines of destruction and get countrys to turn against each other hoping to cause a World War.
As a result, a man known only as M (and something else that I won't give away) calls together a group of Extraordinary Gentlemen (and Gentlewomen).  The leader was Sean Connery, who was a hunter.  Then there was an Immortal named Dorian Grey.  There was a Beast named Mr. Hyde who was sometimes Dr. Jeckle.  A woman that was bit by Dracula when her husband was hunting him was the vampire.  There was also an Invisible man, and an American Spy that you didn't find out that he was Tom Sawyer after Mark Twain was done with him until the credits.  And finally, the seventh Extraordinary gentleman was a scientest named Captan Nemo who had a submarine named the Nautalus.
This group goes out to conqure evil and all that stuff, and not giving too much away, they are successful, and from the ending, I'll be expecting a sequel (which they tried to hard to achieve).
Of course, this movie wasn't academy award worthy, but it's still worth seeing (mostly because it was so corny).

1481741,3,B00005JM5B,"But he didn't. This movie could be so much better if Moore's always original and intriguing ideas were pasted in the script. As it is, LXG is an interesting movie, but what annoys me greatly is the fact that it has an enormous potential, which was not developed correctly.
The basic plot may be the oldest in the world, but still effective: a madman is trying to dominate the world by means of kidnapping the foremost scientists on Earth and making them develop futuristic weapons like armored cars and repetition rifles (remember, the time is 1899, when the wars were fighted in trenches). To prevent it, enter the scene six or seven of the most known heroes in the british world (and one from the American scene too): an elderly but still tough Allan Quatermain, Dorian Gray, Captain Nemo and his Nautilus, the Invisible Man, Mina Murray (ne Harker, from Dracula), Tom Sawyer and Dr. Jeckyll/Mr. Hyde.
OK this is a work of fiction with super heroes, so I won't comment on the plot premises. They are far-fetched and unbelievable, but it's very cool to watch a bunch of my favourite characters together trying to stop a world-domination plot. I will post, however, some questions: 1) why the presence of an american character, if in Moore's story there are no Americans? I think the american audience can stand a movie with no american heroes, if the story is good. The way it is, all non-american viewers get a little angry with Sawyer's presence in the story. And all that talk when Sean Connery (the ultimate british actor) says to Sawyer that ""this new century will be yours, as the old one was mine"". C'mon. I know the producers will say it's the american audience thay will make the movie pay-off, but with such a poor story this one will hardly pay-off anyway. And 2) if they wanted to create Nautilus THAT huge, at least they should know that a thing that size wouldn't fit in Venice's narrow and shallow channels. The Nautilus design was cool but I don't buy a ship over a kilometer in lenght traveling smoothly between the gondolas.
Well, there were other things that made me role my eyes, but what I want to say to future viewers is that LXG is one nice super-hero movie. Surely not great, but surely watchable with some dark interesting scenes, good computer-animated sequences and above-average graphic design. As I said before, I only wished Moore had some kind of participation in this movie. It would have been much better.

1481743,3,B00005JM5B,"After reading several scathing reviews of the film and negative commentary from fellow moviegoers like myself, I decided to throw caution to the wind and check out the movie myself.
Well, my verdict is in: the movie has its high points (Peta Wilson as Mina Harker, a jaw-dropping turn-of-the-century super automobile, and an interesting turn on the Captain Nemo character plus the crew of the Nautilus).
However, the overabundance of computer graphics and the rather poor dialogue can't make this adventure anymore than average.  The fight scenes are too many and the stunt doubles can be too easily spotted for Connery and Naseerudin Shah (""Nemo"").
The final battle between Mr. Hyde and a similar incarnation is almost laughable.  Computer-generated special effects were better handled in the two ""Lord of the Rings"" films.
If a possible franchise was in the minds of the filmmakers, then they blew it.  Big budgeted ""fireworks"" aren't enough to entice filmgoers for a return visit.
Think ""Lost of Space"" of several years ago!

1481750,5,B00005JM5B,"I suppose that the best part of the movie - that is, the characters - cannot be to the filmmakers' credit. After all, the seven (Allan Quatermain, Mina Harker, Tom Sawyer, Jekyll/Hyde, Captain Nemo, the Invisible Man, and the incomparable Dorian Gray) intriuging masterpieces of Victorian literature come from such brilliant authors as Oscar Wilde and Bram Stoker. However, the part of the movie that rivalled even the characters coming to life was seeing the characters interact with each other....a giant crossover fanfiction of Victorian literature. As each character finds his niche in the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, it corresponds to his literary predecessor. Dorian Gray certainly would be the seductive fop interested only in his own gain, whereas the American Tom Sawyer would be blunt and naive. The acting was great all around, with special  nods to Connery, Peta Wilson, and Stuart Townsend, who has transformed himself from the awful train-wreck that was ""Queen of the Damned"" into an elegant and yet totally comfortable actor - reminiscent a younger Johnny Depp. My one complaint was Tom Sawyer's inclusion in the movie: with his American accent and frankness that so contrasted with the others' elan, he made himself into an extremely irritating character. In addition to this, there were numerous subtle homages of various other 19th century characters, from the villain's name revealed to be ""Moriarty"" (Sherlock Holmes's archnemesis) to Connery's ""how operatic"" upon hearing of the villain: The Phantom.
That said, the plot was a total mess. Granted, it was no worse or more cliche than any other comic-book-to-movie film, but it was still pure contrivance. One gets the sense that the channeled spirits of the Victorian characters are sitting in front of a CGI screen and ignoring the plot altogether for its sheer stupidity.
The cinematography was pleasantly dark, but the fighting scenes were far too choppy and edit-happy to make for an enjoyable view. But even with all its flaws, ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" redeems them by the league of said gentlemen itself.",1061164800,2,2103,5.240356083086054

1481803,4,B00005JM5B,"In the superhero genre, this film scores a 4!
Sean Connery, Peta Wilson, Shane West, Stuart Townsend, Richard Roxburgh, and Jason Flemyng almost jump out of the screen as some of literature's greatest heros (or villains depending on your take).  Based on a graphic novel of the same name, the film provides us with an introduction to each character as any good superhero film should and then WHAM! we're in the action!
Don't make the mistake that many might - that this is an action film - because, while it has tons of action, this is a superhero film!  Back before there were comics, there were fantasy novels, science fiction, and horror.  It is this genre that this movie (and since I've not read the graphic novel - I'll assume it as well) mines for its characters and plotline.
The time is 1899, and some meglomaniac is attempting to bring the world into a world war (remember the first world war began some 13 years later).  So the head of British Intelligence attempts to sign on Allen Quartermaine, the great explorer and adventurer as the leader of a group known as the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  The man who brings them together is known as ""M"".  (Now, this mere character name flashed brightly for me as it alluded to the current cinematic version of the British Secret Service overseeing James Bond - M.  Now, kids, anyone remember who played the first James Bond? - Can you say Sean Connery?).  I don't know how faithful this occurrance is to the books, but, man, it struck just the right note for me.
Hesitant, Quartermaine agrees and we are quickly introduced to the rest of the League (and does this ""League"" name strike anyone as vaguely familiar to the ""Justice League"" of comic book fame?):  we have Stevenson's invisible man, Mina Harker from Stoker's Dracula, Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Well's Captain Nemo (really outstandingly fleshed out for us here), Wilde's Dorian Gray, Twain's Tom Sawyer are brought to life for us vividly.  The streets of London are brought to life wonderfully.
I loved how the science fiction aspect was developed:  Captain Nemo is obviously a scientific genius and so he has advanced modern science on his own by creating an automobile (which were actually invented in around 1875 by Daimler Benz in Germany, but were not yet known widely) that looks like it belongs in the 1930's and a submarine which looks as if it is the size of the Titanic.  He also has heat seeking missiles on board the Nautilus.  This is all quite fantastic and farfetched - but HEY! - this is an action film of the superhero nature.
Why these characters?  Quartermaine is undeniably the first ""Indiana Jones"" of literature.  Mina Harker is a brilliant choice, because she is a vampire - who can fly and transform herself - but one who can walk in the daylight. The Invisible Man is stealthy and ....invisible!  Dorian Gray - well he's indestructible - but he does have his Kryptonite.  Captain Nemo...well there's got to be a superhero who knows everything about everything, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde...well let me tell you that Robert Louis Stevenson wrote about ""The Hulk"" in the late 1800's - long before Stan Lee borrowed the concept for his comic.  Tom Sawyer?  He's the American version of Quartermaine and a crack shot.
The acting is top notch and the storyline is really quite well developed.  I want to read the books, because I've got to believe Fox was somewhat faithful to them, because movie studios routinely screw up good literary stories when they put them to film.
The special effects are awesome and the storyline really works.  I really loved who the villain turns out to be.  I'm not going to tell you, but do remember the characters are all from Victorian literature.

1481804,4,B00005JM5B,"A superteam of fictional heroes taken from the works of H. Rider Haggard, Robert Louis Stevenson, Bram Stoker, Mark Twain, Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, and Oscar Wilde?  Sounds like it can't miss, especially when it's Allan Quartermain (q.v. King Solomon's Mines), Dr. Jekyll, Minna Harker, Tom Sawyer, Captain Nemo, The Invisible Man, and Dorian Gray.  On the other hand, it sounds like X-Men 1899, or should that be The Fantastic Seven?
The year, 1899.  Tensions already hot between England and Germany due to the naval arms race (not mentioned, but something I thought I'd throw in, due to my knowledge), come closer to boiling point when a tank, similar to the ones that would be used in World War I, makes a raid on an English bank.  Germany is blamed.  A Zeppelin factory in Germany is attacked.  Naturally, Britain is blamed.  Worldwide consequences are foreseen, despite the fact that it's eight years before the formation of the Triple Entente.
Allan Quartermain is dragged from the wilds in Kenya back to England and asked by a gentleman cryptically named M, to have a martini shaken not stirred.  Kidding, but think of the similarities between this M and another M in a series of movies starring Connery.  Anyway, this M resurrects the League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen, comprising of unique personalities, to combat the villain, identified only as the Phantom.
A lead takes them to Venice, courtesy of Nemo's ivory-coloured submarine, the Nautilus.  (Cue ""We all live in an ivory submarine"" haha).  Digital technology has to be commended for the realization of this nautical marvel.
Connery puts his usual combination of charm, dignity, and toughness as Allan Quartermain.  However, given his employer's name, ""M"", I wonder if he felt more than a trifle of annoyance at the James Bond reference.  I'm not sure about Tony Curran playing the Invisible Man with some cheekiness.  However, Peta Wilson, exuding a calm beauty as Mina Harker is a surprise, playing Jonathan Harker's widow with restraint, that is until she gets stirred up and goes on a red-wine binge, vintage A, B, AB, or O.  She also becomes an object of attraction for the debonair Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), invulnerable because of... Oscar Wilde readers will know full well what I mean, and plain-speaking Tom Sawyer (Shane West).  West plays Sawyer as kind of a surrogate son for Quartermain.  And veteran actor David Hemmings (Barbarella, Blow Up, Deep Red) has a small role in the beginning as Nigel.  Jason Flemyng as Dr. Jekyll is interesting, as he has conversations with his CGI alter-ego.  Naseeruddin Shah plays the turbaned Nemo, resplendent in blue,  with an air of dignified leadership.
Apart from the obvious inspirations, there is a nod to Victor Hugo's The Phantom Of The Opera and in a scene in Paris, Quartermain's mention of the police trying to catch an ape owes something to Edgar Allan Poe's ""Murders Of The Rue Morgue.""
While not a bad yarn and an interesting concept to boot, I find its comparison to a 19th century version of the Marvel Comics heroes to be very derivative.  The action scenes still have that dizzying sound-and-fury effects that's become the norm in today's action movies.
One positive thing I see about this movie is that it might get people to read the book from whence these characters came from.  You know, book, n. ""a volume made up of written or printed pages fastened along one side and encased between protective covers""?  Yeah, those things!

Most of the League members are paid little attention while the movie focuses on some dumb added in Tom Sawyer character (which really bugged since Shane West was playing him and Tom Sawyer would have been well into his fifties in 1899).  Some of the more intriguing characters have no chance to grow and others resort to acting as stock characters would.  I would have liked this movie much better without the Mina sex jokes and with more character development to Hyde/Jekyll, Rodney Skinner the Invisible Man (one of my favorite characters from the movie, I was angry that they didn't give him more screen time), and Captain Nemo.  However one must remember that The League was made to be a summer blockbuster action movie and therefore you can hardly expect cinematic genius from it.

premise (literary characters band together to fight evil) becomes a fair
action flick that benefits enormously by Sean Connery's presence, but never
quite comes together.
Part of the problem is diluting the comics mix. Sherlock Holmes' lore is
sprinkled liberally through the story, but he is NOT part of the League;
secret agent Tom Sawyer (???) is used, instead (I think the filmmakers hoped
Shane West's presence, as Mark Twain's Sawyer, would draw teenage girls to
the film...it hasn't). Jason Flemyng's Mr. Hyde is not Robert Lewis
Stevenson's nondescript but twisted alter ego of Dr. Jekyll prowling the
streets, but as big and misshapen as the HULK (hard to believe he could
seduce those London streetwalkers!) Peta Wilson is Dracula victim/vampire
Mina Harker, but she walks effortlessly in daylight (uh, did somebody forget
to read up on vampire lore?) Naseeruddin Shah is the most Middle Eastern
Captain Nemo you'll ever see, but the 'automobile' he invents is so clearly
mid-twentieth century in design and operation that it defeats the illusion
of an 1899 setting. Stuart Townsend's Dorian Gray is fun, simply as a chance
to see Townsend imitate Johnny Depp! Tony Curran offers some needed humor as
a VERY low-brow Invisible Man.
Ultimately, Sean Connery, as H. Rider Haggard's African adventurer, Allan
Quatermain, carries the film, and while he's far too old to be as physical
as the role requires, it isn't as glaring a flaw as it was in his last
action film, ENTRAPMENT. He seems to be having a ball, and at times, you can

The invisibility potion rendered it's user insane over time, which obviously didn't happen to the invisible man in this one. And if Mina is a vampire, then why can she walk around in the sunlight?
However, if you can look past all that, this movie still stinks. The plot must have been fed through Hollywood's Formul-o-matic screenwriting machine, because it follows the lame action genre formula to the letter. There's the mistrust between group members, the inevitable betrayals, the using of everyone's ability to get the job done, etc. It's the same kind of schlock Hollywood has been spoon-feeding the public for a long time.
Sean Connery is too freaking old to play the action role. They have him running around, shooting at people and fistfighting. Right. He should have been slamming people with his walker and oxygen tank, then breaking his hip.
It's obvious that there was NO research done for the making of this movie. Even the when people are speaking German, the subtitles are way off from what they're actually saying. The technology is far too advanced, and the characters are poorly represented. Don't even bother with this lame movie. It's just another bunch of Hollywood hacks trying to cheat you out of eight bucks.",1059436800,3,2018,4.639664804469274
1481865,2,B00005JM5B,"The League of Extrodinary Gentlemen (LXG) was just not quite what I was expecting in an undifinable way. The many flaws of the characters from their original stories took a lot away from what could have been a very good movie.
The characters were very far off from their orginal selves. Probably the most obvious was Mr. Edward Hyde/The Incredible Hulk. In the novel The Strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde written by Robert Louis Stevenson when Dr. Jekyll Drank the formula and transformed into Mr. Hyde he actually became a smaller person who made up for it by being extremely evil. Also towards the end of the book Dr. Jekyll went insane. And the Dr. Jekyll in the movie was perfectly right in the head. Also the so called ""invisible man"" was not the same person from H.G. Well's novel. Though they made up for this by saying that Rodney Skinner who portrays the invisible man in LXG stole the invisibility secret from a the original Invisibly Man. Next Mina Harker from Dracula written by Bram Stoker was bitten by Dracula just before they killed him but the book did not state that she could do things like turn into a flock of bats and transport herself then turn back. Though Dracula could turn into a meaning one ""Bat."" Next Ishmael was not the name of the Captain Nemo's first mate in 20,000 leagues under the sea written by Jules Verne. And Nemo himself had an unknown origin so it was presumptious of them to just have him assume to be an arab. The two characters who most closely follow their orignal stories are Allen Quatermain and Tom Sawyer. As these two individuals had no paranormal or supernatural abilities it was harder to mess them up. Allen Quatermain is from any number of H. Rider Haggard books (he is best known to be from ""King Solomons Mines"") and Tom Sawyer is a rural 19th century American boy from the Illinois area and was created by Mark Twain. As for Dorian Gray, I have not yet had the opportunity to read The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde so i cannot state whether or not he followed his story.
LXG had good intentions but I think they just went way over the top running rampid with the characters abilities. I am sure that it did appeal to some of the more illiterate tastless teens and young adults who are not well schooled and have no appreciation for classic Literature. As I am 14 years old myself it is rather odd for me to be writing such a thing, even though I have long thought this was so. Also I would like to add that I have not meant to stereotype anybody especially my friends so if the odd chance occurs that they read this know that I do not consider you to be part of the unread mob that flood our schools today. LXG does have some appeal I will grant it if you bypass in your mind the numerous flaws with story and character. If you have not read any of the books the characters originated from which I sure most young people who have seen haven't than this movie would most likely be very enjoyable.
All in All I that this film had potential to be much better and if they would have taken a little more time with it and made the characters the way they are I think it would have been a much better movie in my opinion.
Also to anyone who has not read the books I would strongly reccomend that you read them if you like old classic novels that tell wonderful tales.",1059436800,,3332,4.34991974317817
1481866,3,B00005JM5B,"I'm currently reading this graphic novel from which this movie was based upon so this review is strictly from my impression of the movie alone. Again as I mentioned in my review of ""XMen 2"" this is a movie to be seen on the big screen.
I saw this movie the same day I saw ""Terminator 3"" which I was disappointed in so I guess it all depends on where your mind is when you see movies.
The individual introduction of each of the characters was ""fun"" I absolutely thought they selected the appropriate cast for each of these roles. From Alan Q. to the Invisible Man each of these actors were very convincing as their own UNUSUAL brand of Heroes and their many talents are only really shown I believe a total of 2 times in this movie. In this it reminds me of ""X Men 2"" each character only had a few instances to show their gifts/talents. The story is probably plausible for that era {Victorian Age} but maybe hard for the youngins of today to grasp. Captain Nemo's ship was Magnificent although I did wonder how was a ship so large able to get into the canals of Venice????
I gave it 3 1/2 Stars for the cinematography, the special effects and the casting. It is worth the price of a matinee, will I add this to my at home collection..... probably not this is one best seen on the big screen so if you are not viewing it in that content then you don't get the full effect. Not for young viewers there are some blood scenes with the Mina Harker that are pretty graphic and this guy takes all of Hydes potion and is pretty scary so if you have kids who suffer from nightmares over stuff like this I would steer clear of it.

1481867,3,B00005JM5B,"Years after his prime adventuring days in Africa, the great hunter Allan Quartermain (Sean Connery) is recruited by the British government to lead an elite squad and prevent a World War.  When he finally arrives in London he finds that his fellow squad members are each gifted with unique talents.....and even darker secrets.  Reading like a Who's Who of 19th Century literature, Quartermain must deal with characters ranging from the never-aging Dorian Gray to the infamous Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  Given the unstable personalities, can this squad complete its mission...or will they turn on each other?  THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN takes this conceit and crafts a flick that, while short on depth, provides a non-stop ride of action and thrills.  Based on the now-classic comic book series by Alan Moore,  the film is wonderfully mounted and harkens back to the old days of 19th Century thrillers. The movie moves at a good clip and never drags as events move along.  Also, the special effects are very solid, with Captain Nemo's famous sub, the Nautilus, being the most impressive. By now, Sean Connery is an old hand at this types of roles, and he brings a delightful crustiness as the aging Quatermain. Stuart Townsend is delightfully snide as Dorian Gray, while Peta Wilson smolders with sexuality as the vampiric Mina Harker (the heroine from Bram Stoker's ""Dracula."")  Naseerruddin Shah is stern and stalwart as the legendary Captain Nemo.
However, the movie isn't without its flaws.  Fans of the comics may find themselves disappointed, since the film substitiues a new plot for the comic's and only Shah's Nemo is true to the source.  Also, aside from Connery and Shah, the characters are pretty much one-demensional.  Indeed, the movie assumes that you already know the back stories of these characters.  As a result, if you haven't read the comics or the novels in which these characters appeared, you'd be at a disadvantage. Also, when Quartermain deduces the identity of the real villian near the end of the film, there's no real indication of where he got the knowledge.
Overall, though, LEAGUE is a solid film that will appeal to the action-lover who takes his English lit with a sense of fun, and it's worth recommending if you have the right frame of mind.",1059436800,44,2285,4.952879581151833
1481868,2,B00005JM5B,"Although titled after the comic books from which it is adapted, the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen should thank Mina Harker for being the one bright spot in this film.  The portrayal by Peta Wilson is just menacing enough, and flip enough, to make her the most interesting on-screen presence.
Taking its cue from Gotham City of the Batman movies, the settings are dark (with the exception of Africa, of course, and that only in the open air).  Much of the action is predictable and the special effects and computer graphics don't add much.  Except, again, in the case of Mina.  Her split personality of sorts is a nice, if exaggerated touch.
There was nothing in this movie a viewer could believe in:  a car chase through the streets of Venice; a Nautilus nearly as large as an aircraft carrier; a Mr. Hyde, who was monster enough, being turned into a monster, etc.  Although it must be admitted that the arguments between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde were amusing.
Unfortunately, there was just no substance here, even though there were many possibilities.  The creators of this movie didn't understand who their audience would be.",1059350400,,1130,4.823834196891192
1481869,2,B00005JM5B,"The plot is a good one: In 1899, even people with unusual and varied superpowers must unite to combat a mysterious man who wants to start a world war. The seven superheroes are all famous literary characters from the time period.
Or they're supposed to be. But someone should inform writer Bram Stoker that Mina Harker is a vampire; he wasn't at all aware when he wrote ""Dracula"". Jules Verne would have been fascinated to see the ""real"" Natilus, which is the length of several football fields and many stories high. Mister Hyde, it seems, has become a giant monkey-like thing with a top hat. Perhaps I missed this little detail when I read the book. Tom Sawyer has grown up from his childhood to become a dashing young gunslinging spy, even though by 1899 he should be over 40 years old.
Anyway, these seven quetsionably-literary characters all unite to combat the Phantom, who has been trying to spark World War 1 a decade too early, and profit off selling his highly-advanced arms. His weapons include tanks, automatic rifles and computer-guided fly-by-wire rocket launchers. I realize it is a superhero movie type thing and it's not supposed to make sense, but somehow I can't believe that the mysterious Phantom obtained computer-guided wire missles fourty years before the advent of digital computing and sixty years before the microchip was invented, and ninety years before computers became fast enough to do that kind of stuff.
The fun continues. The Phantom, a cliched figure with a mask and a very ugly eyeball, and the seven gentlemen of the League face off in very ugly action sequences. Apparently the director, when the producer told him to ""film an action sequence"", took this to mean ""run around with the camera in hand while having seizures."" Because that's what it seems like: the camera goes all over the place and cuts between scenes every two or so frames. And then the viewer is subjected to some of the most over-computerized special effects that were ever seen.
What happens between the action sequences? Some of the most terrible dialogue to grace a movie screen. One charachter, upon attempting to pierce Mina Harker's vampiric heart with a stake, comments that ""I've always wanted to nail you"" in a sexual manner. Or something like that. I can't remember the details because my brain is blocking the memories in symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.
There is some fun to be had in the movie, generally when Sean Connery is speaking in the rare moments he isn't given bad dialogue. Or the couple action sequences that actually make sense. But these moments are few and far between. Don't waste your money on this one.",1059264000,,2650,4.852097130242826
1481870,4,B00005JM5B,"This is what's called in the trades a ""high concept"" film. Yeah, I know it was a comic book first, but the whole concept is a totally outlandish ""what if..."" contrivance. I knew this going in and adjusted my expectations accordingly. Despite the bad reviews and bad word-of-mouth, I really had a good time!
Yeah, it's silly and there are lots of obvious lapses and holes in the plot and execution, but it was fun and succeeded in entertaining me in spite of them. In the end, I think it was the fact that it was so totally over-the-top that won me over.
Interestingly, I was impressed by things that the film makers seem to have considered throw aways. Having Alan Quartermain, Captain Nemo, and Dorian Gray among the characters was OK, but having the chutzpah to include Mina Harker in the group really sold it to me - she and Dorian gray were by far the most interesting characters in the group. The sly (and not so sly) references to other fictions and films were entertaining. They had the guts to make the silly parts really silly and play them straight without winking at the audience, which is just what the material needed.
Also, just like two of my favorite TV series, ""Wild Wild West"" and ""The Adventures of Briscoe County, Jr"", the anachronisms  of setting it in 1899 was fun.
What was silliest? Probably everything involving the Nautilus or Captain Nemo's other technological anachronisms. We simply don't want to ask how he can drive a submarine which appears to be about 1/3 the length of the Titanic into the Venetian canals. We also aren't supposed to wonder how vampire Mina can survive in the sunlight.
About the only thing that really didn't work was the CGI Mr. Hyde who was essentially a Hulk clone.
OK, so you've been warned... If after reading this, you still think you might be able to get into the spirit of it, I recommend you see it. OTOH, if you're reading this with your brow furrowed and your nose crinkled up, wondering what sort of over-medicated weirdo I am, then don't waste your money.",1059177600,4,2020,4.595567867036011
1481871,1,B00005JM5B,"Okay, first things first - if you're going to use a literary character as your main character in a movie, let's please get his name right, people!  It's ""Quatermain,"" not ""Quartermain.""  It was spelled right in the credits, but not on the gravestone, and was mispronounced throughout the entire film.
Next, if you're going to use an infamous villain as your bad guy, EXPLAIN how he's infamous. James Moriarty is the man who killed Sherlock Holmes.  I only know that because I'm a Sherlock Holmes fan - I've actually READ the books.  Anybody who doesn't read the books will not have the foggiest clue who this man is and how ""(gasp) James Moriarty!"" is such a big deal.  Not to mention the fact that it doesn't even matter anyway because Doyle brought Holmes back anyway, so he wasn't actually killed in the first place, making Moriarty's infamy null and void, but that's another story.
And Edward Hyde was turned into the Hulk.  In the actual Robert Louis Stevenson book, he was much smaller than Henry Jekyll because he was the evil side that had never been used and was therefore undeveloped.  But that doesn't make money, does it?  Plus the fact that Henry Jekyll and Edward Hyde both died at the end of the book anyway...
Captain Nemo was also not an Arab. His nationality was unknown. And Ishmael was NOT his first mate - Ishmael wasn't even from 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, he was from Moby Dick!
Also, just little ""duh"" things here - the Nautilus would have never fit through the waterways of Venice, it's impossible.  Plus, in the first shot where the Nautilus surfaces in front of the League for the first time beside the little pier in the marina - that must have been one bloody deep marina for that large a submarine to have pulled right up to the dock UNDERWATER without running aground.  And the car - okay, I can kind of let it slide, what with Verne's original idea of Nemo being ahead of his time with technology, but there is no way Tom Sawyer would have known how to drive the thing so well, particularly when he didn't even know what it was at first.
It's very obvious that this movie was made for illiterate teenagers who have never read the actual classics that these characters come from, and therefore they will not care that these characters' integrities have been traded in for loud guns, big explosions and a super fast, ahead-of-its-time, 19th century gangster car.  And it's sad that I say that, since I'm a teenager myself.  At least I'm well-read.
I found this movie stupid, barbaric and a waste of time.  It was almost as bad as Rollerball.  I was disgusted by the blatant changes made to the characters and came out of the theatre furious at how the filmakers had mutated my favorite literature.  And again - you'd think they could at least get the main character's name right!!!  Particularly since it IS in a book, very easy to look up!  ...
Don't waste your time on this unless you have not read the classic books, do not plan to ever read the classic books, and like big guns and explosions.  It's an insult to people's intelligence (not to mention incredibly disrepectful to Jules Verne, Bram Stoker, Mark Twain, Robert Louis Stevenson, Oscar Wilde, H. Rider Haggard, Arthur Conan Doyle, Herman Melville, and H. G. Wells).",1059177600,7,3262,4.614186851211072
1481932,3,B00005JM5B,"Don't quite give up on the comic-books-turned-movies franchises yet. If you're sick of the latest spandex hero fighting the forces of evil, LXG might give you a little refreshment. While deeply flawed in some areas, it's a lot more unique and possibly more entertaining. (Especially if you are a ""book"" person)
It's 1899. A monstrous tank barrels through London and into a bank, where special diagrams are stolen. In Germany, Zeppelins are blown up. The world is on the brink of a widespread war, and a horribly scarred, masked Phantom is the one responsible. So the British government calls on Allen Quatermain (Sean Connery), a reclusive hunter with many amazing adventures behind him, and asks him to help England. He's about to refuse, but a firefight and a bombed-out club change his mind.
He arrives in London to join the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), a vampire, an invisible thief, Skinner (Tony Curran), and Captain Nemo, a pirate (Naseeruddin Shah). They try to recruit Dorian Grey (Stuart Townsend), a beautiful and dissolute immortal, but are attacked in his home -- and aided by a young American agent, Tom Sawyer (Shane West). After recruiting Dr. Jekyll (Jason Flemyng) and his alter ego Mr. Hyde (also Jason Flemyng), the League is on its way to Venice, to protect an international conference from destruction by the Phantom. But the League soon learns that their situation is much more complex -- and that one of them cannot be trusted.
To some degree, this movie is in a ""league"" of its own. Most comic books center on people given or born with extraordinary powers, but not much else. LXG, instead, focuses on characters who already existed, ranging from the bizarre (Mina the vampire, Dorian Grey) to the obscure (Allen Quatermain -- how many people reading this have read H. Rider Haggard?). As a result, it may be the only truly literary comic book adaptation. It's a motley crew, but somehow they fit. Unfortunately, while the literary references are solid enough, the plot is not really smart -- the good guys are hunting down the bad guy, who is trying to rule the world. It's fun if you switch off your brain and just watch.
It can't be denied that the action scenes and fight sequences are amazing. Some of the characters are given more development, like Quatermain, who is still torn up over the loss of his son. For better-known people like Mina Harker (""Dracula"") and Tom Sawyer, not so much introduction is necessary. Not a huge amount of character development, but since these characters are already known to us, they feel good anyway. The identity of the Phantom (another literary character) is a genuine surprise (a good one, too), and the identity of the traitor becomes evident when you think carefully.
Among the problems are the special effects -- Hyde's first scene is particularly bad, and some of the transformations are unconvincing. And some of the shots of the Nautilus and the tank (looked like a miniature), not to mention the flaming zeppelins, were very unconvincing. The first shot of the Phantom's fortress is enough to make you groan. That said, the follow-up shots of the fortress are lovely, and the Nautilus is (mostly) enticingly gorgeous and lush. (I want to live on the Nautilus -- that thing is absolutely beautiful)
Connery proves that he's still a great presence at 70 plus. (He keeps beating up bad guys, and it never seems improbable) Wilson seems completely befuddled as to how to play Mina; Townsend is deliciously foppish and disdainful; Shah is likably dignified and solid; West is okay, not exceptional but not bad (he's at his best when bonding with Connery); Jason Flemyng is excellent as either incarnation of Jekyll/Hyde, switching between savagery and torment. And Curran steals every scene he's in -- or isn't in. Even though he's only a voice half the time, he's hilarious. (One of the funniest scenes is when Quatermain kicks the invisible Skinner out of his office)
Despite the respectable and brainy background of these characters, LXG isn't a smart movie. It's not really dumb either. Consider it a James Bond movie if you took out Bond and populated it with classic characters.

This is really the perfect Summer movie what with so little involved to clutter your mind and so much to wow your senses.
""TLOEG"" starts off a little rocky though, with all the declamatory, stagy acting looking and sounding like a night performance class in Shakespeare. But that is soon cleared up once the adventure starts: and a pretty interesting adventure it is. A madman (big,hairy wearing a half mask like the Phantom of ""Phantom of the Opera"" fame) and his henchman want to take over the world and a suave English gentleman named ""M"" takes it upon himself, with direction from the ""English Monarchy"" to assemble a team (Quatermain and Company) in an effort to thwart him.
If I had to pick one, I'd have to say that Captain Nemo is the grooviest in that he has the best toys. Remember this is 1899, the dawn of the 20th Century and our Cap has a White Limo that looks like a gigantic stretch Bugatti WITH appliqud silver decoration in the Rococo style. Plus his submarine, ""The Nautilus"" is also in cool, sleek white with the exact aforementioned adornment gracing the stern and the bow! Our Cappy has style.
There's much to keep the eyes and ears busy and even some minor sex play between Mina and Dorian to mix it up a bit but basically this is primo, popcorn munching, junior mint chewing, soft drink devouring territory.

I could easily try to overlook the fact that Tom Sawyer should be at least 50 in the movie, not in his late-20s.  Great action, and perfect bits of humor.

- there was no thought behind many of the special effects. When water rushes out of doors and along corridors, none of the running crewmen are bowled over. The chandeliers in the Nautilus don't swing during turns.  How could that huge Nautilus fit into a Ventian canal, let alone turn a corner?
- there was no thought taken for the motivations of any of the characters, good or bad.  Why were Mina & Nemo there at all? What did the villain have to gain from his (fairly expensive) villainy?  And why was he personally there for all the big bombings and shootouts?  Playing it a little risky for an evil mastermind, eh?
- Tell me again: how is firing a Polaris missile from the Nautilus into a specific Venitian building, guided by GPS location of a 1930's-style roadster supposed to save Venice from destruction? And how is it that the guys in the car can find this place through the winding streets of Venice but the crewman up in the crow's nest can't?  And why would you, as the evil genius behind the bombing of Venice not only station scores of your armored men along various (soon to be toast) streets and alleys on the off-chance that a gentlemen-filled car will drive by but also be present yourself? How did he expect to get away? And how did the Nautilus start to sink in Venice, then end up in the open sea when it popped back up?
- The characters, so richly written 125 years ago, were never properly developed in the film. It was hard to care much about any of them.
A little attention to detail could've turned this from a fun summer action-romp into a true X-Men meets Indiana Jones classic.

Stuart Townsend! Great performance in Queen of the Damned, a sadly underrated movie. I managed to keep my excitement going, and went to see the movie when it came out. It got off to a very slow start, but that's not necessarily a bad start for a good story, so I said okay, let's see what happens next. Peta Wilson a vampire definitely got me thinkin' good things about what was to come, and the relation between her and Dorian Gray, and the other complication of Tom Sawyer, proved to be an interesting point to follow.

All in all, the actors were good, the characters were good, the story would've been GOOD if they'd just spent a lil more time on it, and it would've been MUCh better if it hadn't been painfully obvious by the numerous ""dark"" fighting scenes that there were many, many stunt doubles.

So far we have had ""Daredevil"", ""X-Men 2"", and ""Hulk"". But, it wasn't until the film was released that I found out what the movie is about. For those who are ignorant like me when it comes to comic books the movie is about a group of men being assembled together in order to stop a madman from world domination. OK, so that part sounds boring. But, it's the characters who are brought together that caught my interest. The characters are classic literature characters such as; ""Dr. Jekyll\Mr. Hyde"", ""The Invisible Man"", ""Captain Nemo"" and Mina Harker (From ""Dracula""). This sounds like a good fun idea to me. I thought I would get a kick out of seeing people playing these characters. And I was mildly right.
 ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" makes one big mistake that plagues the movie throughout. It takes itself too serious. People who walk into this movie should more or less know what they are getting. You can expect big loud explosions. Semi-suggestive material. Lots of action. And mild but unwitty attempts at humor when the characters are in serious danger. In a dare I say ""James Bond"" style. And that is exactly what you will see when watching this movie. But, I was expecting a bit more tongue-in-cheek humor. I was expecting the movie to be a bit more ""fun"". The movie I feel most will agree basically has a ludicrous plot but the writer James Dale Robinson didn't seem to think so. The movie is trying to be kind of ""heavy"". The only way this movie could of worked I thought was by knowing what its limitations were and making the best of them.
 There are some things I liked about the movie. I liked the look of the film though I'm willing to bet all of it was fake and done with special effects, but, it was still nice to look at. I didn't mind the performances but I think Sean Connery comes out looking the best. He's playing a sort of Indiana Jones kind of character. He is after all Jones' father ya know? But other than that I don't see much else to recommend.
 Besides the serious tone of the movie I didn't like what they did with the ""Dr. Jekyll"" character. When he turns into ""Mr. Hyde"" he looks a lot like ""The Incredible Hulk"". I don't remember Spencer Tracy becoming a 10 foot monster when he played the part. Also the camerawork bothered me. At times I felt it was moving too much. I was becoming dizzy. The action is moving so fast that it seems like it just can't keep up.
 If your looking for a mindless good time and a nice way to spend an evening after a hard day's work I'm not 100% convinced this is the best way to spend your time and more importantly your money. Though I guess there is an audience for this kind of thing. Whether or not most of that audience will enjoy it, I'm not sure. I don't hate this movie, but I don't like it very much either. If it helps you in any way, if I had the chance to go back in time and chose if I wanted to see this movie again, I'd probably pass.
 Bottom-line: Silly comic book movie that just doesn't seem as ""fun"" as it could of been. Takes itself too serious when it should of been more playful. Acting is fine and I like the look of the movie but nothing else caught my eye.",1058572800,2,3309,4.304975922953451
1481940,2,B00005JM5B,"LXG starts well with a spectaclar scene involving Alan Quatermain's reluctant re-entry to Her Majesty's Service.  The excitement continues as the members of the LXG have their initial meeting and are subjected to their first attack as a team.  But it's all downhill from there.  Even the special effects seem to get faker as the film progresses.  The Invisible Man is sometimes CGI, sometimes a live actor with powder on his face and the obvious inconsistency in appeance is glaring and inexcusable.  Captain Nemo's submarine is not half as impressive as the one in the Disney film ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,"" which was made FIFTY years ago.  Inside LXG's sub, the chandaliers in the dining room don't even sway as the sub maneuvers and you rarely have the feeling in interior shots that you're in a sub.
The characters are potentially interesting, but the movie's execution and script are so sloppy, the characters'potential is never realized. And why would Dorian Gray keep his eyes open when shown that portrait since he knows what will happen?  Why does the invisible man disappear, not only in the obvious sense but from the movie, for an hour with no credible explanation?  What is the significance of Captain Nemo's strange religious inclinations?  Why does Nemo's beard look like it's about to come unglued at any second?
I'm aware that there were conflicts between Connery (the producer) and the director, Stephen Norrington, and there were natural disasters.  It shows.  But all this movie proves is that modern special effects can look lousier than the plastic models used in the 1950's.  Oh, it also proves that Peta Wilson makes a sexy vampire.  Overall, the movie is a shame because Sean Connery, at 73, still has star power and it's wasted here.  I'd like to see him make one more great film before he hangs it up.  Recent Connery movies like LXG, Entrapment, and even Finding Forester, are poor closers for old Sean. He should try again while he can still walk.",1058572800,3,1981,4.854166666666667

How ever, the more well known teams would be the Fantastic Four, JLA, Avengers, Etc. But this team, this is a different type of well known. Wherea's X-Men are not the usual super team, they are a school, this is a group of heroes, individually well known, banding together. The first comic super team to make their way to the big screen, LXG feautures seven characters from literary history that are almost house-hold names. Sawyer, Nemo, Jekyll Hyde, Bride of Dracula, Alan Quartermain, and the Invisible Man, characters who dazzled readers for one hundred plus years. An excellent film albeit the frequent use of equipment 50 years prior to the tools creation--If you don't mind extremely far fetched films--you'll love this.

The special effects were amazing and the characters were really well done. Sean Connery is wonderful at any age and Shane West was great as Tom Sawyer. The Invisible Man provided a good zip while Dr. Jeckyl was sympathy invoking. The talented Stuart Townsend sizzled with bad boy sex appeal as Dorian Grey. He is one actor I really recommend watching out for, he is amazing. Then last but not least I have to commend Peta Wilson for her portrayal of Mina Harker.

1481993,2,B00005JM5B,"Id been looking forward to this since I first saw the teasers a few months ago. Ive never read the comic or anything, but the previews looked awesome. I do give this five stars for premise, because I think the story has incredible potential. And maybe its fully realized in the comic. I don't know. But as a movie, I give it only one star for execution. Take the average, round down, and you get two stars, which is what I gave it here.
So, like I said, I think the story has huge potential. Ive always liked to think of literary characters as real, and have wondered in the past how they would react to one another. Thats what I expected to see here, and in the middle of a cool action flick to boot (which I am also a fan of.) Instead, the characters are about as flat as the pages they were born upon, and the plot about as riddled with holes as Dorian Grey (youll know I mean if youve seen it!) The plot really made no sense, and there was little to no attempt to justify many actions - even, to some degree, the creation of the so-called league of extraordinary people. Maybe I would have understood it more if the shots weren't so short and choppy. Especially during fight scenes, I could not follow the action at all. Most shots were not long enough to even give you enough time to identify the characters, at were at times even edited to be seizure-inducive (especially if they involved hulkish Mr. Hyde.) It was not a complete disappointment though. I actually enjoyed the Invisible Man. I attribute this to the fact that his past was never touched. He didn't have any depth, and he didn't need any to be amusing. But in the end, even he couldn't save his fellow extraordinaries from falling just short of ordinary.",1058400000,,1724,4.373831775700935
1481994,2,B00005JM5B,"As other reviewers have noted, LXG is based upon a brilliant concept (classic 19th Century fantasy/action characters banded together), but the ultimate execution is somewhat unsatisfactory.  The makers of this movie let us know in one early scene (when Tom Sawyer picks up Jeckyll's hat) that tongue is firmly in cheek.  However, to make entertaining fantasy adventure, there has to be some believability and inner consistency to the alternate world created.  My main problem was the technology.  Rather than taking the ""future"" technology and making it appear turn-of-the century, we get a fully developed W.W.I style tank, a 1930's style automobile, and a Polaris missle shot from the Nautilus, even.
Setting aside other problems noted by other reviewers, such as the impossibility of the Nautilus navigating the canals of Venice, or the age of Tom Sawyer (he should be at least in his fifties), it's an o.k. superhero action flick.  Sean Connery is the obvious highlight as Allan Quatermain (not ""Quartermain""), and there are some good supporting performances.  Some of the special effects are pretty good, and some leave something to be desired.  I didn't agree with the decision to make Mr. Hyde look like a cross between The Hulk and Popeye the Sailor Man, but I guess they felt they needed to embellish some of the characters to try to make them appeal to today's audiences.  If you're a fan of the superhero genre and/or you've read a lot of 19th Century fantasy fiction, this might appeal to you.  Otherwise, you should probably skip this.",1058313600,,1548,5.015625

I thought the acting was great but the movie and the plot [bad].  For example the bad guy was trying to get the world to go to war but it never explained why.  What was his reason?  There was also a lot of jumping from scene to scene and not explaining where they were or why they were there.  Mr. Hyde was another HUGE disappointment.  It was just as bad as the hulk.  There was very little character development; I never grew attached to any of the characters.  They also left some things open ended.  The movie was over and you go ""wait a minute.  What happened to that guy?""  Or ""What was going on here?""  Very poorly done and it is a shame to waste any money to go see it.",1058227200,4,808,4.102564102564102
1481996,5,B00005JM5B,"The X-Men never wore black leather outfits in the comics but they do in the movie.  I didn't like the idea at first - but it works and the movies are great.  Batman's suit isn't made out of rubber armour in the comic, and the Joker isn't the guy who shot Bruce's parents - but in the movie it works and is great.  Sawyer and Grey aren't in the comics, but they work in the movie.  Mina is the strategist and leader in the comic, and is a serious butt-kicker in the movie - and it really works.  Q is a dope-addled misanthrope in the comic, and is a man beset by guilt and grief in the movie - to be honest this didn't work that well for me, but Sean connery makes anything look good.  And Q is the natural leader of the group.
And they switch around some of the villain characters from the comic, so there are still surprises for us comic book fans.
Comics aren't about static chracters and hard-wired story-lines(the gray Hulk, the many versions of Beast, the ever changing Green Lantern) and I really don't want them to be.  LEG is probably too young a comic book for fans to accept the evolution that the movie represents.
The movie is more violent, more action packed and less thoughtful, intellectual and literary than the book, but it is a thrilling yarn for boys and girls.  And that, for me, is what the spirit of the comic is.",1058227200,11,1335,4.26984126984127
1481997,2,B00005JM5B,"The premise is exquisite.  Take some of 19th century literature's most iconic figures, and revisit them in a unique and innovative way that captures the spirit of that era.  That is the inspiration for ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"", both the film and Alan Moore-penned graphic novel upon which it is based.  The characters in question (Nemo, Quartermain, Harker, etc.) come from stories that helped define pop culture in the 20th century.  The exercise of putting these characters together holds the promise of adventure unparalleled and a meditation on the themes that defined the works of Verne, Stevenson, Wells, et al.
Unfortunately, that promise remains unfulfilled, and it is a great pity.  The roles are extremely well-cast, and the world in both its Gothic/Victorian stylings and faux-future imaginings are well-done.  The beginning of the movie shows promise, with a rousing opening in Africa where Quartermain is recruited, and when appraised that a character named ""The Fantom"" lurks beneath the sewers of Venice and plans to blow up an important gathering, Sean Connery (in the Quartermain role) growls, ""How operatic.""  Alas, that is about as deep as the film goes in plumbing the rich literary origins of its heroes and villains.
It is said that Leonard Nimoy turned down an intended cameo in ""Star Trek: Generations"" by complaining that any character could have spoken his dialogue and that it simply had the name ""Spock"" above it.  This qualification would cover much of what goes on in ""LXG"".  Each character is given brief, tantalizing moments to discuss their origins and a scene or two where they deal with their issues, but such scenes are fleeting and stand alone from the plot.  The fertile backgrounds of the characters are used to establish motivations, but are thrust aside by the mechanics of the plot.  The quasi-exception to this being a very inspired imagining of Jeckyll's relationship with Hyde, but all that does is serve as a reminder of how much source material is going neglected.
The plot itself is a victim of its origins.  The works of these 19th century giants inspired 20th century popular culture to the point where everything in this film has been seen before in one fashion or another.  It is the return of these characters that is the main draw of the film, and though the actors inhabit the screen constantly, the characters' time on the stage is all too brief.  We see Captain Nemo, we see Tom Sawyer, we see Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, but only in quiet moments and then they are lost as backdrop against set pieces that demand their traits, not their essences.  Increasingly as one watches ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"", it is harder to focus on the story being told and instead to ponder the stories that were not.",1058227200,11,2779,4.920770877944325
1481998,3,B00005JM5B,"For me this was an eagerly awaited movie outing, although I have to confess as to NOT having previously read the comics. The story is fairly straightforward - Sean Connery plays latter day Indiana Jones, Alan Quartermain (Kings Solomon's Mines)who reluctantly comes to the call of the British Empire to save the World from the ""Phantom"" and his army of technologically advanced goons, by leading a band of ""Extraordinary Gentlemen"" (including one woman), in a classic Good vs Evil scenario. His band of heroes include, Dr Jekyll (& Mr Hyde), Dorian Gray, Mina Harker, an Invisible Man, Captain Nemo, and Agent Sawyer, all with their own ""special"" talents to contribute to the crime busting organisation. Connery is excellent (as usual) as the lead, and the acting performances are great allround, the movie is overladen with spectacular SfX, and the story builds nicely throughout. I felt the main problem with the movie - is that it is a sad reflection on the general ignorance of literary characters of old by people today, that each member in the film in turn, has to play out a little cameo, explaining who and what they are, and share their emotional baggage with the viewer. What results is a multitude of mini subplots inside a main story, itself trying to be inventive and twisted, and ultimately coming across as a bit of a mess. It is very difficult to convey deep character development inside an essentially ""tongue in cheek"" romp around computer generated 1899. And although the movie never sets out to be taken seriously (consider the subject matter for a moment), it seems to try and do so, at every given opportunity. It is a little slow to get going, and then fills the viewer with anticipation, which it never really delivers on fully. Don't get me wrong, it is an entertaining movie, and OK at around 1hr 50 mins, but it could have, and should have been better. Sure to be a winner at the box office, and later on DVD and Video, just don't get your hopes up too high.",1058227200,,1985,4.706896551724138

CGI for Hyde and the Invsibible Man may be necessary, but not for old cars and submarines.

1482040,4,B00005JM5B,"Suffice it to say that I'd only caught a glance or two at a trailer and had heard that the critics were tearing this movie up.  With that in mind, I headed right into the theater with a bit of reticence and an open mind.  Not surprisingly though, this film well overcomes critical disdain and is an excellent film!  I'd also never heard of any past references to a ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" comic series or anything else so I went into this completely unaware and came out genuinely and pleasantly surprised at what an original concept this phenomenon is.  Not to mention the fact that one of the film industry's best actors was starring in it, Sean Connery!
The premise:
It is the year 1899 and someone appears to be making all attempts to instigate world war by committing acts against the governments of several key nations, all the while disguised as the opposing nation.  In comes the call to Allan Quartermain (Sean Connery) by the Crown, to help organize the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and seek out this terrorist and neutralize him.
What follows is nothing short of a brilliant, superhero type film with many surprising heroes.  From beginning to end this film is filled with exceptional action sequences and a plot that well capable of ""suspending disbelief,"" and entertaining the moviegoer.  I highly recommend this film for its merits in every category are well established!  {ssintrepid}",1058140800,9,1416,4.895397489539749
1482041,2,B00005JM5B,"""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" has an absolutely winning premise, there's no denying that.  ""Think fantasy baseball for the bookish set,"" says Premeire magazine, as the film (like the comic on which it's based) combines a handful of heroes and anti-heroes from turn-of-the-century literature and makes an ""X-Men""-esque crime-fighting force out of them. Unfortunately, the movie is bad. It suffers primarily from a lack of character development (there are just too many characters, and not enough time), a bad screenplay (which is responsible for some truly awful one-liners), and absolutely no story whatsoever. Sure, there's a Bond-like villain in a ridiculous costume trying to stir up the first World War, but his motives are unknown, and (when his true identity is unmasked) he's about as threatening as a purple humming bird. Most of the League members are equally lifeless, and some of them are just plain annoying (see Tom Sawyer and Captain Nemo, for instance). The special effects call too much attention to themselves as well - 80% of the film seems like it was shot in front of a blue screen. Some of these visuals are remarkably good (see Mr. Hyde and his mutated foe, for example), and others are mind-numbingly bad (see Captain Nemo's ship or the villain's fire-spurting lair). To make things worse, the ending is a damp squib that sizzles instead of popping. Sure, it can be entertaining some of the time, and it is therefore not a complete and utter loss, but given the premise and source material, it's a shame that this film is the final product. Like most films with a troubled shoot (this one was plagued with costly disasters), it just feels like the director lost interest in the project long before it wrapped. He and Sean Connery did not get on well either, and as a result Connery seems to phone in his performance. A disappointment.",1058140800,,1867,4.926984126984127

This looked like a really fun movie.  But in the end, it could of been done better.  Now, I'm not very familiar with the comic book so I don't know how true this is to the material, but this film's weakest points are the script, which is terribly silly and pointless, and the horrible special effects.  The action scenes were clumsy and you don't find any big suprises out of this film.
The actors range from good to bad.  Sean Connery's a great actor, but he's just not believable as Quartermain because of his age.  He seems too old to be able to do the physical things he can.  Tony Curran is never given a chance to make us like his character.  Skinner's a jerk most of the time and going back and forth between an actor in makeup and CGI effects is tedious.  Naseeruddin Shah, as Captain Nemo, is fun to watch, but his fighting abilities seem a little hard to swallow.  He's one of the better characters in the film.  Peta Wilson does a fine job as Mina Harker.  Her character is one you're really able to like.  Stuart Townsend is great as Dorian Gray.  He pulls the role off very well and has some pretty good lines.  Shane West is good enough to make us like Tom Sawyer.  He's got some really cool moments.  Jason Flemyng is perfect as Dr. Jekyll, though the Hyde character looks really stupid(Facial expressions and deformations all over him.)

It starts off introducing characters for about 40 minutes, each of them with more issues than a newsstand.  And while I was intrigued with the inclusion of Dorian Grey, Hyde's/Jeykl's appearance quickly soured the note.  It's not that Hyde's transformation didn't look real; it's that it didn't look good at all.  Also, the fast-motion action sequences in the movie were very much overused.  Moving quickly between action sequences is supposed to increase the tension, but if used for every shot for 10 minutes, it just gets annoying.
To watch and enjoy this movie requires the suspension of belief greater than watching Charlie's Angel's two.  There are so many inventions on the Nautilus and elsewhere that we not around at the end of the 20th century that it's nearly laughable.

1482044,2,B00005JM5B,"I love action movies, particularly fantasy/Sci-fi action.  Given this, I certainly have no problem setting aside reality for a while and getting lost in a good bit of fantasy.  I had sean some not-so-positive reviews of this film, so I lowered my expectations and hope for some fun excitement.  Oh, there was plenty of excitement.  However, there were so many dumb ""flaws"" in this film that it sort of sucked the fun out of it.  Let's review;
THE GOOD
-Special FX were very entertaining.  Hyde transformation was intense.
-Mr. Hyde was, by far, the most entertaining character in the film.
-The basic story was ok.  Adequate for an action film.
-Acting is passible. No glaring weeknesses here.
-CHaracter development was as good as could be expected for such a large ensamble.
-Music was really not a factor.  Didn't add or detract.
THE BAD
-A 400 foot long, 80 ft tall submarine would not fit in the canals of Venice let alone be able to make any turns.
-The entire city of Venice is not built on stilts.  Venice is a series of marshy islands.  The buildings are mostly 3 stories tall and anchored into the ground.  Placing bombs under the city as shown is not possible.  To sink such a large part of Venice would require the removal of the Islands.  Yea, right!!
-England and Germanys respective militaries did not have steel helmets in 1899.  These were developed during WWI (1918 ish).
-Nemos car is too 1930s.  As an industrial designer, I can tell you that the probability of someone developing a car of that style in 1899 just wouldn't happpen, not even a forward thinking guy like Nemo.  Car styling is evolutionary not revolutionary (dispite what the car makers tell you).
-GPS (global positioning system) in 1899?  COME ON!!!
-Invisible man survives siberian wilderness in winter and running out of a room after being flame-throwered...  WHILE NUDE!?!?!
-When the HQ of the LXG is first shown, Paintings of past ""leagues"" hang on the wall.  Later, the head of LXG tells the heros it was all a lie.  Were the paintings really necessary?  If this was the real HQ, who was running the show?
-Plot has 9 bizillion holes in it.  Too difficult to trace them all.

I'm sure I'm missing a few things.  Some of this may seam nit-picky to some of you.  Just keep in mind that the film maker's responsibility is to make me believe that this fantasy is real (even if in a different world).  But you just can't ignore history or technological probability.  So much reality was suspended to make the story work that it falls into the realm of the rediculous!  It seams to me that the writers never researched anything!!!  They just did what ever would ""look cool"".  A good sci-fi or fantasy takes responsibility for making the viewer buy into the events that are happening on the screen.  LXG failed in it's responsibility to depict the year 1899, known architecture, and the laws of physics accurately.  Because of this, The longer I viewed the movie, the less I believed anything that was going on.  B.T.W.  I've never read the comic.  Perhaps it too is as rediculous as this movie, in which case they were trying to be honorable to the books.  Still makes for a rediculous film.  Curb your curiosity, wait and rent.  Save some money.",1058140800,2,3232,4.664893617021277
1482045,1,B00005JM5B,"I had been waiting for this movie for sometime.  The original comic book was great, and i was glad to see it adapted into a movie.  Unfortunately, this movie has some problems.  First, let me proclaim some level of unbias, as i really wanted to enjoy this movie, despite whatever changes, new characters or plot adjustments they had made.  In the end, all my problems with this movie were simply poor movie making.
First though, a synopsis: This is the justice league of america for the 19th century.  Characters from classic literature brought together to fight a common evil.  Alan Quartermain, 'Mina Murray (from Dracula), Dr. Jeckyl/Mr. Hyde, the Invisible Man, Captain Nemo (from 10,000 leagues under the Sea) and two characters that weren't in the original story, Tom Sawyer and Dorian Gray.  Together, they are thrust into an array of adventures as they try to foil the sinister plot of one uber criminal, The Fantom.
So here is just one of my many problems with this movie, Tom Sawyer.  His adventures with Huck Finn and the slave Jim, obviously took place pre-cival war, where Sawyer was in his early teens.  This movie takes place in 1899, which means Tom Sawyer should be in his 40's or even 50's, but no, he's 20-ish.
In the end, this movie has an ego problem.  It thought it was going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread, but falls short.  The characters are two dimensional, its dialogue gets sophomoric at times, the villain when finally revealed and his evil plans are just too ridiculous.  It is a shame that Hollywood could take an idea so grandiose and turn it into utter rubbish.  Although, there is something inspirational about a movie like this, if Hollywood will make a movie this bad, anyone can write a successful script.",1058140800,3,1755,4.733552631578948

1482048,1,B00005JM5B,"I was REALLY disappointed with this movie.  I felt absolutely nothing while watching it because the characters were so flat that there was no way to get emotionally involved with what little bit of story was there.  Captain Nemo had some cool stuff, but frankly, all of it looked so fake, there was just no getting into it.  In terms of filming, MANY of the scenes were way too dark - I kept begging for one of the characters to turn on the lights so we could see what was happening - and the fight scenes were so harshly edited that half the time you can't figure out what is going on until it is all over.  The ending was abrupt and frankly, didn't make much sense - battle scene in the artic, anti-climactic fate of Allen Quartermaine, and cut to Africa?  I'm glad I caught this one at the matinee and didn't pay full price.  What a waste of two hours.  I wish I could have given it half a star.",1058140800,,898,4.186046511627907
1482109,2,B00005JM5B,"Not a bad picture; however it's not a great one either.  Nothing but eye candy and some decent action sequences.  Unfortuately, the plot has some blaring holes and the action is shot way to close to see what's going on.  Naseeruddin Shah is great as Nemo,  Peta Wilson is hot as Mina Harker and Jason Flemyng is touching as Dr. Jekyll.  This movie is for visual lovers only.",1058140800,,374,4.4411764705882355
1482110,4,B00005JM5B,"In a Summer full of surprises, THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN is another welcome one.  Overshadowed by PIRATES, TERMINATORs, and other expected blockbusters, this film never seemed to get the proper promotion.  Which in this case, may have been a good thing!  Without all the hype, I wasn't expecting much from a band of characters that I never cared for in their first incarnation.  Allan Quatermain, Tom Sawyer, Captain Nemo, and the rest of the LEAGUE seemed like characters that I could do without revisiting.  Besides, X2 did a good enough job this year bringing a circus of comic book manifestations to life just a few short months ago.  Thus, once again, I was wrong with my prediction.  Don't get me wrong.  This film is far from perfect.  Some of the computer effects obviously needed a few more weeks to render.  But with that aside, LXG is one fast and fun time at the movies.  With Sean Connery in the lead, and ""extraordinary"" performances from those in line behind him, the action rarely lets up, the story is coherent, and it feels just like an updated version of the action films from cinematic history.  Catch the matinee!",1058054400,,1146,4.761421319796955
1482111,4,B00005JM5B,"I was quite pleased.  The writers showed quite a bit of restraint, allowing the characters to unfold with little more explanation than needed.  There's a few places where you get a dumbed down summary of who each player is, but this is rare and understandable when it happens.  A few characters don't get explained at all.  You wouldn't know that Agent Sawyer is in fact Tom Sawyer from the movie alone, for example.
The dialog is snappy.  The action sequences are as crisp as Norrington's previous hit, Blade.  If you go in looking for a fun action flik told out with re-interpretations of classical victorian characters, you will be amused.
I, for one, recommend it.",1058054400,2,668,4.765217391304348
1482112,4,B00005JM5B,"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is based in part on a Graphic Novel By Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill.  Rated PG-13.
1) Actually, from reading the reviews posted previously, only some of the Characters and the name they take on are from the Graphic Novel.  If you're a fan of the comic, you'll be just as disappointed as those that expected more from The Hulk movie.  I haven't read the Graphic Novel, nor do I plan to.
2) The movie brings together literary characters from books that were published between 1870 and 1897, and the story is based in the year 1899.  A mysterious villain known only as The Phantom is using relative high-tech gadgets to cause mayhem in the world in an attempt to cause a world war.  One man who calls himself ""M"" who we later find out is Professor James Moriarty (reference The Final Problem [Sherlock Holmes] by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 1893) recruits several people of extraordinary talent in an attempt  to stop this ""phantom"" menace (no pun intended).  He recruits Allan Quatermain (reference King Solomon's Mines by H. Rider Haggard 1885) whose name in the movie appears as Quartermain though is spelled correctly in the ending credits, Mina Harker (reference Mina Murray [Mrs. Jonathan Harker] from Dracula by Bram Stoker 1897), Captain Nemo (reference 20,000 Leagues Under The Seas by Jules Verne 1870), and an Invisible Man (reference The Invisible Man by H. G. Wells 1897) who is not the one from the book, but rather a thief who stole the invisibility potion.  These characters must then go recruit 2 more members for their League (Moriarty does not include himself in the League).  They visit Dorian Gray (reference The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde 1890) who is an immortal/invulnerable type person, and Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde (reference The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by  Robert Louis Stevenson 1886).  Also brought into the mix for perhaps some flavor text is Tom Sawyer (reference The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain 1876), as he certainly brings nothing that makes him extraordinary other than he's another literary character from this time period.  The first step a viewer needs to do, is accept that however improbable or impossible it is that these characters could exist at the same time, let alone the same plain of existence, they do.  There are even references to other literary characters made that are not in the movie, such as Phileas Fogg  (reference Around the World in 80 Days by Jules Verne 1873).  The next step is to sit back and enjoy the movie.  I won't go into more as that might ruin the movie, but there is plenty of action and at least one plot twist that make this an enjoyable story.  While it is not  the biggest hit of the summer, it does provide plenty of entertainment.",1058054400,2,2771,4.7375
1482113,5,B00005JM5B,"I had never heard of The League until information about the movie came out.  Based on what I read, I was intrigued.  As a fan of many of the literary characters shown in the movie I wanted to see how they had evolved.  I was not disappointed.  This movie brings together a collection of classical tragic hero and gives them a mission.  If you don't recognize some of the names, then look at 20000 Leagues Under the Sea, Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde, the original Dracula story, the invisible man, The Painting of Dorian Gray, and of course the Alan Quartermain stories.  It takes place at the end of the 19th century so there is still some of the innocence of a world that hasn't faced world wars.  The last time I felt this excited watching a movie was when I watched Raiders of the Lost Ark.  I'll definately be getting the DVD when its out.  Until then, you have to see this movie.",1058054400,8,878,4.304878048780488
1482114,3,B00005JM5B,"Once again, Hollywood rapes and plunders another work of genius in order to make it accessible to the lowest common denominator. The graphic novel of the same name, by the incredibly talented Alan Moore, was full of sly literary allusions and wicked hilarity. The characters themselves are fictional entities all imagined to be living in the same plane of existence. The concept alone is incredible. A man named Mr. Bond is charged by his boss, the mysterious Mr. M, to round up these famously fiendish heroes. Mina Murray (why was she Harker in the movie? In the graphic novel, she divorced her husband and kept her maiden name) from Dracula, Captain Nemo from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (whose Nautilus was way sweet in the GN but changed for no apparent reason in the movie. although still, admittedly, way sweet in the movie), the Invisible man (though in the movie he is not the invisible man, he is just a thief who stole the invisible man's potion), Alan Quatermain (spelled Quartermain in the movie), and Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde (still more unnecessary changes. in the GN, Jekyll has been nearly taken over by Hyde WITHOUT taking the potion. Hyde was not the helpful guy he was in the movie.)
 So many changes were made from the GN that i'm surprised they even kept the title. The preceding comments were just a sampling. Some others: Quatermain is supposed to be a washed up opium fiend who is dragged from an opium den by Mina. Mina is supposed to be the leader of the group, not Quatermain. Where were the sparks between mina and Quatermain, anyway? Quatermain seemed to have more chemistry with Tom Sawyer than with Mina. And where the HELL did Tom Sawyer come from?? Have i read the right book? It's as confusing as reading Jaws and then going to see a movie called Jaws that's all about oral surgery.
 want more? You got it! Moriarty is not only ridiculously young, but his character is underdeveloped. Once he was exposed as moriarty, the evil genius of Sherlock Holmes books, why did he suddenly have a lower class accent? Moriarty was a gentleman villian! By the Holy Handgrenade, I am perplexed! The invisible man was found at a girls school, taking advantage of the girls in the name of the Holy Spirit. this is not in the movie.
  I thought i knew the meaning of dumbed down but another has been added to my lexicon. Even the bad guys have to give their entire back story so that the audience isn't confused. This includes Dorian Gray (the luscious Stuart Townsend) giving away the secret to his immortality and the end thereof. How stupid does Hollywood think we are?
See the movie, THEN read the GN. It's the only way you'll enjoy it. I don't know if it's just because they wanted Sean Connery to be the focal point of the movie or what. All I know is that whoever adapted the screenplay writes like monkeys fingerpaint...",1057968000,7,2842,4.6217821782178214
1482115,4,B00005JM5B,"I will admit that I haven't read the graphic novels, and that I have no background information on LXG other than I just got home from the movie.  I can tell you that it's not going to win any awards, but then again, if you were expecting an Oscar winning movie from something that is so obviously nothing but a good old fashioned movie, then you need more help than this review is going to be able to supply.
As I said, having no background other than classic literary knowledge, of the characters, I found this movie to be a good way to spend a couple of very warm afternoon hours.  It's FUN, and isn't that what we go to the movie for?  It's an escape from reality and although there are obvious moments where your mind attempts to over analyze, if you can beat that back and just enjoy the movie as a nice break, you'll love it.
There are quite a few pyrotechnical scenes in the movie and it is filled with action.  Think James Bond 1899.  As everyone knows, James Bond is filled with ridiculous battles and things that we KNOW couldn't and wouldn't happen, but we still love them.  That is the movie in a nut shell.  You KNOW that this just couldn't happen, but you also know it's a movie.. and you enjoy it.
All in all a good film.. not award winning material, but a grand way to escape the day to day and relax for a bit.",1057968000,2,1327,4.200787401574803
1482116,4,B00005JM5B,"First off a small rant: Am I the only person sick of people posting reviews here of movies they haven't seen yet? As of this writing, there are six different reviews of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen on Amazon.com, and none of the reviewers have even SEEN the film. Wow. OK, on to the film! I've been a fan of Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neil's comic (On which the film is based) for years, so I had both high hopes and low expectations for LXG, as the abbreviation-crazy folks in Hollywood insist on calling it; After all, if Moore's groundbreaking graphic-novel From Hell could be so poorly served on film, what would become of the extremely literate League...?
  As it turns out, I was VERY pleased with the film, which doesn't so much adhere to the book as stay true to the feel of it. The book and film both concern a threat to the British Empire in the late 1800's that causes Her Majesty to gather a group of Heroes to counter the threat, all of whom are famous characters from Victorian-era literature. The characters who appear both in print and on film are Allen Quatermain, Mina Murray, Captain Nemo, Dr. Henry Jeckyll and his alter-ego Edward Hyde, and Hawley Griffin, The Invisible Man, who has been changed to Rodney Skinner, The Invisible Man, for the film, for some weird copyright reason. The film adds in Dorian Gray and Tom Sawyer, which may upset purists, but I actually thought they fit in quite well. The villain of the film is the mysterious, disfigured ""Fantom"", replacing the book's Fu Manchu, also presumably for copyright reasons. The source material is just crammed with Victorian literature references, so much so that a whole book has been published just for readers who want didn't get them all on their own. The movie also has a few literary nods, such as Nemo's First Mate Ishmael, but overall it never pretends to be anything other than what it is: A fun popcorn movie. The action scenes are fast-paced and well photographed, the plot moves along briskly and includes a few twists that should surprise even die-hard fans of The League's comics, and the effects are beautifully done; The depiction of Mr. Hyde is especially wonderful. If only The Hulk had looked so realistic...
Sean Connery still makes a convincing action hero, and the rest of the cast all fill their roles ably, with Shane West (Tom Sawyer) and Stuart Townsend (Dorian Gray) standing out. Townsend is especially good as the foppish Gray. Despite cosmetic changes, such as changing the comic's all-too-human Mina Murray into a Vampire (Who seems to have no problem with sunlight...?), the film keeps the general feel of Moore's extraordinary (Pun intended) book, so overall, I'd say LXG is probably one of the best comic inspired movies I've seen in a long time, second only to Spider-Man. Newcomers to the world of The League should have a blast, and so will longtime fans (If they keep an open mind, that is.) Be on the lookout for the newspaper headline touting ""VOLCANOS ON MARS?"" in the background of the scene on the docks; The second comic book adventure of The League concerns H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds, so Director Steven Norrington may be setting up the sequel....YAY!",1057968000,6,3186,4.738738738738738

The plot is great and full of interesting twists. I'm not telling what happens but if your looking for a good time this is the movie. A must see of the big screen movie.
