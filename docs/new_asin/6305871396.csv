7896651,4,6305871396,"SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SIGN OF FOUR was the 2nd of 2 films that Ian Richardson starred in as the Great Detective, after HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES.  Once again, the production values, and Richardson's warm and impeccable performance carry this flick.  Cheri Lunghi (Queen Guenevere in EXCALIBUR)is a winning and winsome damsel-in-distress and David Healy's Dr. Watson is a great improvement on his HOUND counterpart, being much more realistic in the role.  Of course, there are a couple liberties taken with the original tale, and the culprits are revealed rather early in the film for my taste, but it doesn't get in the way of a solid and entertaining thriller.  If you're a Sherlock Holmes fan, I would definitely recommend this film.",999561600,27,737,5.016393442622951
7896652,4,6305871396,"the DVD is grainy, and the story does deviate from the text somewhat.  The packaging is nicer than the one for the Richardson ""Hound of the Baskervilles,"" but I would still say that the Granada version with  Jeremy Brett is the better of the two.",963446400,25,246,4.444444444444445
