8294649,5,B001DRH7K0,"I am such a big fan of Denzel Washington. After seeing, ""Flight"", I had to purchase past movies he had made that I had never seen.
To get a 3-in-one DVD or a 4-in-one DVD, is such a nice change from buying one DVD at a time. This one is really excellent. I just watched, ""Out of Time"", and was totally surprised at the ending. I never saw it coming. I already loved him in,""The Mighty Quinn"", so it was a great deal.  And very quick service. Thank you.",1357171200,,452,4.078651685393258
8294650,4,B001DRH7K0,So 3 great Denzel movies - my personal favourite is the Mighty Quinn so go this so I could get this once again and was not disappointed in the least.,1355356800,,149,4.0
8294651,5,B001DRH7K0,"I think that I discovered Denzel with The Mighty Quinn, which I do/did ( I am unsure ) own on VHS for many years and played a good many times. I came to that film, not in search of the actor, but for its island locals. I there discovered D W who delivers the line ""call a policeman"" to eternal effect.

So I purchased this collection to keep Inspector Quinn on hand for the remainder of my days. If I recall the VHS accurately, trust me on this, there has been some unfortunate editing between that and this DVD. The VHS was dramatically neater, particularly in the final scene, but a little bad editing cannot ruin a great movie.  Buy and enjoy! I may be a cult of one, but I call it a classic.

Two bonus movies are included.",1355270400,3,727,4.178571428571429
8294652,5,B001DRH7K0,"It's hard to give a review when there were no mistakes and the product is still in it's wrapper.  I did receive it on time and in great condition,what else is there to say.  I don't do movie reviews that up to the others who enjoy that stuff.",1354838400,,242,4.020833333333333
