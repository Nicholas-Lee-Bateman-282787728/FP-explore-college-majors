6554220,5,B00M2FFHSG,"What the hell is not to love? It's witty, it's odd, and it's Cartoon Network gem of funny. Obviously, like all weird kids shows, it does require a degree of demented mind in order to appreciate it, so you might say that I am a little off my rocker. But ""The Curse"" episode was brilliant, so yeah.",1354492800,,296,4.2105263157894735
6554221,5,B00M2FFHSG,I purchased this DVD for my 10 year old son. He loves the Amazing World of Gumball! I like the diverse dimensions of characters - makes it different from all the other shows out there. The only thing my son didn't like was that there were no newer episodes on the DVD. We'll just have to wait until the next one comes out. =),1348185600,5,325,4.09375
6554222,3,B00M2FFHSG,"I find ""The Amazing World of Gumball"" a bit hard to swallow.  That's because you'll see so much mixed media in one sitting - 2D, 3D, even stop-motion-type characters running around on photograph backgrounds !  Whatever, the series became quite a global sensation starring a feline troublemaker named Gumball Watterson and all his friends like Darwin, a goldfish with legs, his sister Anais (who kinda reminds me of Chowder's self-appointed girlfriend), and lots of other crazy characters from Tina Rex the dinosaur and Hector the Giant to Banana Joe and a ghost named Carrie.  Now the series is finally available on ""The DVD"" (named after the episode where Gumball and Darwin break a rented movie and try to come up with the replacement fee).

The other 11 episodes direct from season one include the following:

""The Third"" - Gumball and Darwin look for a third new friend to join them.
""The End"" - A solar eclipse is coming and Gumball and Darwin prepare for the end of the world.
""The Quest"" - Tina Rex steals a doll from Anais.  It's up to Gumball to get it back.
""The GI"" - Gumball takes up karate lessons, but gets taunted by his peers in the process.
""The Picnic"" - A school field trip to the Forest of Doom takes a turn for the worst when Gumball and Darwin get lost.
""The Wand"" - Gumball finds a toy magic wand in a cereal box.  Now he has to convince his father that it's really real.
""The Meddler"" - Seeing that she doesn't find the time to spend with her son, Gumball is mortified that his mother is following him everywhere he goes.

The DVD special feature is ""Meet the Wattersons"" where you get an up-close look at Gumball and his family.

In conclusion, this is one world that is beyond strange, if not amazing as the title suggests.  And don't forget to watch out for new episodes of Gumball and his friends on Cartoon Network.",1346284800,16,1844,4.52710843373494
6554223,5,B00M2FFHSG,"We don't have cable so when we stayed at a hotel during vacation in Jan., my kids 7 and 10 discovered Gumball and has been begging me to get a dvd of it.  So glad it's coming out.
After a little research, it appears that there are 18 episode in the 1st season  which contains 2 segments per epsiode (36 segments in all).  The Dvd back cover states 12 episodes but they are actually 12 SEGMENTS which come out to 6 episodes EQUIVALENT out of 18.
I say episode equivalent because each segment listed on the dvd was split from it's accompaning segment in the episode.  For instance, The DVD/the Responsible are in episode 1 but only the DVD appears and The Third/the Debt are in episode 2 but only the Third appears and so on. I guess the segments are stand alone. Some episodes are skiped completely.
The 5 stars are for the Gumball series.  Just happy to get any on DVD.  Would love to have the complete season on DVD.",1338768000,6,917,4.3023255813953485

""If you like Gumball you already own the entire gumball though,"" that's what they must be thinking, when this is under one dollar plus shipping and handling bringing the entire price to basically four dollars, which is basically already five dollars.

Gumball and Darwin are a couple of middle school boys and the episodes are based upon that.  These days, it's hard to find cartoons that are funny, yet safe.

6554251,5,B00M2FFHSG,"Ostensibly a kid's show, and that is going to be the main audience, this is a series that even a well-humored adult can appreciate.

I can't easily describe the show, save to say it revolves around Gumball and a few of his friends. But adults also make regular appearances. Much of the dialogue involves creaming, and most of it is absurd. The level of artistic freedom given to the writers is clearly top tier; anything they think is ridiculous or funny they simply write into the script.

I dare say a large number of adults wouldn't find this funny because they have banal, underdeveloped senses of humor and take themselves too seriously. If you don't think you fit that category, check this series out.",1449964800,,707,4.693548387096774

6554275,5,B00M2FFHSG,"This animated series is the definition of zany wacky cartoons. Sometimes, you'll get a callback or reference to a previous episode, which adds some continuity to this world, but they're mostly random hilarious shorts. This was made to be like a best-of dvd, but it's been confirmed that all of Season 1 can be owned by collecting these three Amazing World of Gumball dvds: The DVD, The Mystery, and The Party.",1423612800,,409,4.774647887323944
6554276,5,B00M2FFHSG,"Ok, so, as other reviewers have stated, this is the exact same thing as the other ""The Amazing World of Gumball: The DVD"" being sold on Amazon, only the two have different covers. Oh, and, at this time of writing, this version is selling for $4.99 while the other is selling for $8.56. Buy this one because it's FAR less expensive!!

As far as the show goes, I absolutely love it. It is my favorite currently-running show on Cartoon Network right now. It's sad to see how much worse cartoons have gotten in the past few years, in terms of quality and comedic value. A lot of shows now are either complete crap, or just ""meh"". However, this show is great in every aspect. Rarely are any cartoons able to leave me in stitches, but this cartoon does just that. The humor does not seem forced & thrown in your face - it's more natural, witty, and subtle, like humor should be. There's the kind of stupid that's FUNNY, and then there's the kind of stupid that's just DUMB. This is stupid-funny. It has broad appeal, and won't raise as many red flags with parents as other shows (*cough, cough* Regular Show!! *cough*) might. (I do like ""Regular Show"" as well, but I had to accept the FACT that it is probably better-suited for Adult Swim.) Adults will also enjoy the show's ""cuteness"" factor and the many pop-culture references from the 80's and such (like Rocky's ""AB/CD"" shirt). A show like ""Uncle Grandpa"" simply cannot compare.

In addition to how well-written it is, I also love the unique appearance of the show. Pretty much all forms of animation come together in a way that blends well and does not seem (too) awkward. The backgrounds are based off of photographs, and the characters exhibit a broad range of animation styles - hand-drawn, photorealistic, CGI, puppet, claymation, 8-bit, animesque, chinnequin, and so on. Seeing the vast array of different...species(?)...of characters is really cool, as well. The animation is smooth and well-done, unless it's clearly not intended to be.

I also admire how, despite being a show from the UK, it seems very American. A large portion of the voice cast hails from the United Kingdom, but they use American accents & dialect. And they do an excellent job with it!! I was astounded to find out this was a British cartoon; it just doesn't seem like it.

All-in-all, this show is simply fantastic from top to bottom. Everything comes together seamlessly, and it makes for a thoroughly enjoyable cartoon. ""The Amazing World of Gumball"" is a rare gem in a sea of disappointments today. If you haven't seen it, you must; you're missing out. You won't regret it.",1421280000,8,2606,4.708333333333333

6554289,1,B00M2FFHSG,"Okay, this is in no way a reflection of my view on the actual show. I love it, I buy the DVDs and comics and if they made a game I'd buy that too. It's a funny show that mocks tropes and usual television cliches with silly twist and mixes unique styles of animation.

The one star review is strictly for this DVD, as it got my hopes up that I could collect more episodes to view whenever I had the urge to. The problem is the episodes listed on the back cover. If this is the correct list, which I'm believing it is as it's pictured on the case and not just listed in a description, then you are going to be getting the same episodes as the first DVD (titled ""The DVD""). No, not just a handful of episodes already released mixed in with a new one or two, it's the same exact list of episodes. It's not for a different region, there are no new special features. If you want this DVD, it's the same price as the old one, so if you're on the page you may as well just take this. If you can't wait for it to release, grab ""The Amazing World of Gumball: The DVD"".

You're starting to pick yourself up Cartoon Network, but this is just mindbogglingly idiotic. Please treat this like Adventure Time or Regular Show and give it the season releases it deserves. Or how about using the time you wasted on making a new cover and instead releasing a new set with the episodes of season 2 we have yet to get.",1411603200,2,1395,4.106227106227106

6554292,5,B00M2FFHSG,Dvd's are standard DVD's and packaging is typical for a box set. I can say i really hate the commercials for their other DVD's at the beginning of this one and all the others...,1397433600,,177,4.235294117647059
6554293,5,B00M2FFHSG,"So im going to be up front with this review.  when i saw the preview of this series i didn't think it was going to be any good.  in fact i didn't even try it out till just about a week ago.  You can't blame me though, in my opinion CN's cartoon quality has dropped over the years.

  So anyways  the first ending of an episode i saw  was when gumball did a cheer leading routine (cant recall episode name)
the fact that hes a guy doing this just made me laugh lol.  he performed horribly in the routine.  he lost a shoe (hitting some on in the head) sprang his an ankle, and had a horrible case of the wedgie with an extreme close up on the cameras end (no joke). lol.

  After seeing that episode i got curious and set my DVR to record the show.  all i can say is every episode has not failed to make me laugh uncontrollably. XD  its actually a great show!  i just goes to show i shouldn't judge a book my its cover :P i really hope these get out on to blu ray in seasons some day!

  I also like the creative use of real world backgrounds.  for example  elmore junior high school that he goes to is a real school in San Francisco called Abraham Lincoln high.  there use of several art styles is really cool too,  mixing 3D CGI  and standard 2D drawing  was really creative :P

  My only complaint is the naming of the episodes and how the usually end each show.  you will notice most of the episodes and very simple names  usually starting with the word ""The""  like the bet, the flakers, the words, etc.  is seem sorta effortless on there part in my opinion.

  The ending are  very similar to the titles.  a lot of these episodes will end  abruptly and with an ending  that makes you think theirs going to be more after the commercials. (leaves you hanging)  a good example of this is ""the virus""  in my opinion  they should give each episode a proper ending.  Years ago i met danny antonucci.  (creator of ed edd n eddy) as we talked he told me that  a good ending  to a cartoon is  what completes each episode.

Anyways, this cartoon has its flaws but over all i still give it five stars. :P

Update about season 3.

so quick and simple..  season 3 has lost its quality in being funny and having a decent plot line and has just become random.  don't get me wrong there are a few good episode in season 3 but  the ending are not just stupid. don't make any sense (a good example would be ""the fan"")  (ending of the fan) gumball tears the book a fan made up so they could stop acting out with  a ""fan of theirs""  so instead of a normal reaction of why did you do that and then coming to some conclusion and ending the episode.  the fan starts making weird noises and does a weird dance.  even gumball questions the fan on this.  most of the other episodes in season 3 the plot feels thrown together and just totally random now (a good example would be the void) there are only like 4 or 5 episodes that made me laugh in season 3.  Example would be the puppy and the cop. anyways i think there running out of ideas and it makes the show feel like a robot made it or something.  So if you watch this show try season 1 and 2 before season 3.

Update again about season 4 and up.

They pulled it back together in fact, i think these later seasons are even better than the earlier seasons! :P check out this awesome show! ive heard its ending on season 6.",1397260800,2,3353,4.1102484472049685

6554311,4,B00M2FFHSG,"Recently stumbled onto this show on TV and was immediately intrigued. The mix of animation styles is cool and a lot of the sequences are really well thought out and well done.  (as opposed the a lot of the animated shows these days which often look so similar).

Kind of lame that they only put a few of each 11min episodes on each disc, though. They could easily have fit the whole season on a single DVD, or at the very least released two discs in one package. (otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars...) Also not really any fun special features, which is surprising for such a clever show.",1364083200,,592,4.372727272727273

6554316,5,B00M2FFHSG,"Even though I bought this DVD via Walmart.com, I still regret getting it from there on account of the cheap price from Amazon! But we're not worried about that are we? We are worried about the DVD itself!

First off, the content. The Amazing World of Gumball is show that can appeal to ANY age groups with it's huge doses of hilarious slapstick genre of comedy, directed at anyone. The show so far makes no bad references, such as adult jokes, so parents sensitive to touchy jokes such as that have no need to worry!

It is a very wholesome show, while not only extremely comical, but has a very large amount of good values to pass along, such as the episode called The GI, which is contained in the DVD, where Gumball wants to dress as a ""karate master"" and go to school with a karate uniform on, while the other kids at school poke fun at him without him realizing it, and by the end of the episode, all of the characters involved finally realize that you have to leave everyone alone and just let them be themselves, which is clearly stated by Gumball's crush, Penny.

While for some people, as other reviews have stated, the whole scenario may be hard to grasp, after watching a number of episodes, you get used to it and then start to notice the everything right in front of view. That is also why, if you are new to Gumball, you should probably take the first viewing of the DVD to get used to the characters and surroundings, and then watch it again to fully enjoy it! This also makes the DVD to be something you can watch over and over again!

As a huge fan of the show myself, I make my statement clear when I say that this show is amazing. Just all of the humor and values wrapped into a DVD makes it perfect for anyone!

The only downfall is the special feature. But with every Cartoon Network DVD as it goes, it is a character biography of the Watterson family, which is pointless because you have already bought the DVD and will be learning more about the family as you go!

Even though the Special Feature isn't that great, this DVD is definitely worth the buy, and I strongly encourage everyone to buy the DVD! For support of the show, a 5 star for the DVD!
