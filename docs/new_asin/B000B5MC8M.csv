2400099,5,B000B5MC8M,"I got both Tintin DVD sets for Christmas and I LOVE LOVE LOVE them! I think I've seen each DVD, both in English and in French (it comes with both) at least 3 or 4 times. I love to watch them while I work or do stuff.

Anyone who knows anything about the history of Tintin knows that he evolves all the time. The books we buy today are not the books that were originally published, are not the original strips that were first published in the Belgian Catholic newspaper in which Tintin was born. Everytime Tintin was changed, he was refined- he became less naive, more politically aware, more worldly (as opposed to Belgian). Whether you think this is a good or bad thing is up to you.

While these DVDs are not identical to the comic strips, I appreciate them for a few reasons. First, they're good, clean entertainment. They bring Tintin to life in a wonderful way. Plus, they're a great way to practice my French. You can watch these in English or French with English or French subtitles.

When I visited Chenonceau, the chateau on which Moulinsart was modeled, they had a Tintin exhibit in one of the stables, and they were playing one of these cartoons, in French. It was great.

I highly recommend these for anyone who loves Tintin or who is trying to learn French in a creative manner.",1170547200,17,1291,4.4576271186440675
2400100,4,B000B5MC8M,"I grew up reading The Adventures of Tintin, and they're nothing less than spectacular: great characters, thrilling plots, and an overall wonderful sense of adventure, friendship, humor and tenderness. Perhaps one of my fondest memories from childhood.

These French-Canadian animated series do try to be faithful to the original albums, but there's something missing. For one, they tend to be politically correct, so they skip most of the truly interesting moments (I would have loved to see ""The Blue Lotus"" in all its dramatic historical context). The comic strip was drawn mostly in the thirties, forties and fifties, when suttleties were not in fashion, and yes, there were ethnic stereotypes in it, as in everything else at the time. So what? That's part of its charm (see NOTE BELOW)!

Two, there's not enough time to tell these stories properly. The albums held the reader in suspense for hours; for a TV show to do so in minutes it's not possible. And it ain't the same.

Three, the series don't live up to their fantastic opening secuence, which promises something extraordinary. Those brief moments give the old Tintin aficionado the thrill he's expecting. Not that it all goes downhill from there, but the animation, although good, is no first class either. It would take a major DreamWorks production to achieve that. By the way, I heard Spielberg was working on a Tintin project. Any news? Someone?

P.S.: Watch out for several Herg cameos a la Hitchcock throughout the episodes. He's the lanky blond gentleman with his hair combed in the middle.

NOTE BELOW: Hey, I'm Mexican and I don't get offended by ""The Broken Ear""! In fact, I don't get offended at all! Not by Speedy Gonzalez, Slowpoke Rodriguez, Go Go Gomez, Jose Jimenez, Seor Wences or any of that stuff (maybe Pat Buchanan, but he also makes me laugh)! On the contrary, this P.C. cr@p nobody enjoys really gets on my nerves! How come you can get ""Birth of a Nation"" on DVD but not ""Song of the South""? Isn't it nonsense?",1161907200,47,1995,4.821637426900585
2400101,4,B000B5MC8M,"I recently ordered this set from Amazon of Canada, receiving it within a week.  It is excellent, identical in styling to the first set of Tintin DVDs, which was titled Vol. 1-5.  It is fully compatible with U.S. televisions.

This set contains 10 additional Tintin adventures, as originally shown some years ago in the U.S. on HBO.  Again, you have the option of seeing each episode with either English or French dialogue, with or without captioning.  The only reason I didn't give the set a ""5 rating"" is that there is no additional material provided with the set, such as a guide to the adventures of Tintin, or notes about the making of the series.  With only two adventures per disk, there would have been lots of room for such supplementary material.

Still, this set would be a ""must have"" for Tintin fans. I suggest ordering it from Amazon of Canada rather than the secondary retailers offering it on the Amazon/USA site.",1131235200,15,928,4.691358024691358

8081500,5,B000B5MC8M,"Although they took a while to get (to the degree of doubt), we finally got the two collections. I thought that the box is going to be bigger and I was surprised to see that each collection was in a single DVD box. They are recorded on two sided DVDs and each disk had 4 episodes. They are all in good condition.. Our whole family loved them..",1293235200,,342,4.119402985074627

I would have liked to have known that the main language was french before purchasing.  It would work fine at if your DVD player selection options works, but our DVD player doesn't allow that...Anyone else would have been fine with it although the cover is in French as well.",1265414400,,419,4.4868421052631575
8081502,4,B000B5MC8M,"Boxes are in French only (panic!) but menu allows English dubbing.  It's a cartoon but has an adult, or maybe that's a retro, feel.  For example, the Captain drinks a bit.  Still a nice series of morality tales--Tin Tin treads the high road!",1244678400,,241,4.558139534883721

8081504,4,B000B5MC8M,"As a child, I grew up reading books by Conan Doyle and Jules Vernes. They spoke about amazing adventures in amazing places with amazing characters. On the lighter side of that spectrum, I read these Belgian comic books with Tintin the reporter, his dog Snowy and his best friend Captain Haddock. The stories are interesting and full of interesting characters globe-trotting around the world from book to book. To this day, I still have my collection of Tintin books at home. The research that went into the Tintin comic books seeking authenticity are subjects of a book by themselves (Tintin: The Complete Companion). The DVDs faithfully reproduce the stories from the original books. The animation is incredible in capturing the characters without loosing anything from the original drawings. The voices and the handling of the music evoke an European flair that is welcome for this type of animation. The only major drawback to the whole thing is the film-to-video transfer. It really doesn't do justice to the animation. First, the colors are a bit washed-out and seem to have a slight white cast around the whole thing. Secondly, the edges of things are not as sharp as they should be. Given the fact that the material now exists in digital form, they should've saturated the colors and sharpened the image somewhat, this is not a hard thing or an expensive thing to do. It seems to be an oversight, but in my mind, a costly one. Third, the packaging is well design but very flimsy. They would have done better with a litho-laminated sturdier paper board instead of the flimsy cardboard used (think, I-phone boxes). I would have easily paid five more dollars for better packaging materials.
In all, the stories are wonderful and worthy of viewing by the whole family. So while I'm in my family-kick, I will recommend this to everyone who cares for good story telling over ""hyper-kinetic"" offensive cartoons like some of the stuff found today in television.",1206316800,5,1960,4.906626506024097
