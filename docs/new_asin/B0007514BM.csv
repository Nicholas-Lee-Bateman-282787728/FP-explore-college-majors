2200409,5,B0007514BM,"I love this workout. I had it on dvd several years ago but it ""disappeared"". I've looked over and over again and tried to find it stores. I have bought atleast six other Tae Bo workouts since; trying to find one that did what I needed it to do (blast the fat!). I have been disappointed everytime. No other workout did all this one does. This one really does work. You can feel it working. The others were all too short or too weak to do what I needed.  Doing this workout makes me feel energized, helps me keep weight off, gets my blood moving, makes my skin look better, even brightens my eyes. It is really a full body workout. I've never found a workout that works so well for me. It's not easy to do, but it's worth it. It does the trick for me. I found this one on vhs at Amazon.com for much less than on dvd. I still have my old combo player and videos seem to last ""forever"" anyway. My daughter and I workout with it nearly everyday. She loves it as much as I do. Hope it works for you as well as it does for my daughter and I.",1328745600,2,1035,4.0

2200411,4,B0007514BM,"I got this tape not long after doing the basic Tae Bo tape.  Basic Tae Bo is fun, but this one is definitely challenging.  I started doing it without the bands, but then wanted to see results sooner so I got the bands.  I've used this tape for over six weeks and have seen results in my upper body.  It's exhausting, demanding, but fun and Billy is encouraging.  Well worth the purchase.",1141776000,,387,4.319444444444445
2200412,4,B0007514BM,"I really like the tapes but to make it worth the burn you really need the bands to make you feel apart of the show. I really did sweat hard and you feel great afterwards.

It's good for athletes who need to cross train because the moves or low impact (very little jumping and squats) easy to follow either if your a tae bo fan or have good coordination.

Oh my gosh! All 4 workouts are fun and enegetic, which is why I love tae bo anyway. I would not recomend these for beginners, as they are pretty advanced.

2200447,3,B0007514BM,"The workouts while a little dated (semi-cheesy at times) are really good if you want to do some Strength Training, High Intensity Interval Training and build a lot of core strength.

I have done each excercise on the DVD multiple times now and can say that once you get the moves down (that took me just 2 workouts) it is a really good cardio burn.

I'm 40 and would say that I'm in Moderate to Good Shape (I do about 4-5 hours of exercise in a week)

Cardio Explosion: This was a good introduction to the DVD it focused mainly on getting your heart rate up and doing active recovery.  It has some combo moves that were fun but not too difficult to figure out.  This ~50 min workout with stretching and I burn anywhere from 400-450 calories.

Insane Abs: I've only done this one 2x because I do a lot of ab work in other cardio programs. (I think it was ~35 minutes total) It was nice to do some standing ab stuff though and it was okay but I found some of the techniques dated and since I do so many other ab things this isn't a workout I'll use.

Ripped Extreme: I liked this one.  It is half high intensity cardio an half strength training.  It took me a few tries to figure out which weights I should be using for my skill level.  I needed heavier weights for a few things and lighter for some of the arm/shoulder moves that seemed to go on forever.  I would say most people should have a few different weight options between 2-10 lbs for most people since it is a lot of reps.

Max Intensity: This is actually my favorite on the DVD.  It is a really good cardio burn for me and after I got the moves down I could easily keep my heart rate between 150-180 for the cardio portion. There is a warm up and cool down stretching but other than that it is go go go with burst of cardio to keep your heart rate up and spiking when needed.  In the ~60 min workout I steadily burn between 600-650 calories.

***The Bad***

I have a DVD player that is about 5-7 years old and I sometimes have the hardest time getting this DVD to load.  I have had this issue only a few other times on some very cheaply made DVDs.  All my other workout DVDs work great and I don't have any issues.  It is just this one that can sometimes take me up to 3-5 minutes to get working if it isn't already loaded.  This is a problem as I swap out my exercise DVDs often.

Note: I have a PS4 and another DVD player that it loads right away but on my Sony DVD player that is 5-7 years old I have the problems stated above.",1484524800,8,2490,4.092783505154639

It reignited the passion and enthusiasm that I seemed to have lost for working out, and I can't wait to do the ab workout tomorrow!  All of the moves came back to me like I never stopped doing Taebo.  One thing that I don't like about workout videos these days is that you do the same circuit 3-4 times.  Boring...  With Taebo, you're always doing lots of different moves and you never get bored.  And all of the punching and kicking makes me feel strong and powerful.  The 50 minute workout flew by.

2200476,3,B0007514BM,"This is my first Tae Bo experience so I can't compare this to anything Billy Blanks has done in the past.
I like Insane Abs and Ripped Extreme. I felt out of breath when I did these and challenged. The time seemed to go by quickly on these two as well.
Cardio Explosion and Max Intensity were odd to me but that may be because I am not familiar with Billy Blanks' style. It seems like he is making up the routine on the spot in all the workouts and it isn't very fluid to me. My Fitbit said I burned around 500 calories during all of these which is great but I didn't become out of breath during Cardio and Max.

These workouts are a good switch from what I normally do (Jillian/circuits). The vibe on these workouts seems weird to me kind of like I walked into a clubhouse or a cult meeting but I can get past that because I just really want a good workout.

I am far from out of shape. I lift weights 5 days a week, I run, bike, I've done Insanity, I've done a duathlon so I'm no stranger to cardio but these workouts whoop my butt. I'm drenched in sweat, exhausted and flipping Billy off by time it's over. So yeah, if you're not sweating then you need to kick it up.

2200516,5,B0007514BM,"I have worked out to all 4 workouts on this 1 DVD. One morning I woke up and did Cardio Explosion. I was half awake when I did this workout but I remember enough to know that it is a difficult workout.  Insane abs was a good workout and although it was an ab workout it is going to work your whole body from top to bottom.

Ripped Extreme was by far the most the difficult workout for me. Be prepared to work non-stop. There were no breaks in this workout. Normally, I am able to walk off and get a drink of my water but it was no so in this case. You are going to sweat within the first fifteen minutes of this video. There is a section that requires the use of dumb bells. I strongly encourage you to use  a 1 pound dumbbell or a 3 pound dumbbell. I noticed that three of the workout crew had 5-pound dumbbells. I started out with a set of 5-pound dumbbells and then had to go down to 3-pound dumbbells. If I had a 1 pound dumbbell I would have definitely used that. You can also alternate quickly and safely to 3 pounds to 5 -pounds but again if this section of the workout was non-stop. This workout is meant to burn you out and to burn out your muscles.

I did the max intensity today (September 10, 2015). This workout was also an intense workout but there are mini breaks in this workout where you can get a drink of water bottle and continue on.

Overall, this is an amazing DVD. Each day I do a different workout which is 4 and then on the fifth day I grab another one of his DVD's and use that.

This was a great purchase and it's nice to have 4 workouts on one DVD. This is also a low impact workout meaning that you won't hurt yourself. Just get the techniques down and you are good to go.",1441843200,66,1701,4.017751479289941

I am now fully back to taebo and have repurchased the dvds I initially gave out when I thought I was done with BB.

2200551,5,B0007514BM,"I am a 43 year old fit male who is currently halfway through the P90 exercise program. I heard of Billy Blanks before and knew he was old school, but this was my first exposure after the purchase of this DVD. I was over my in-laws house and couldn't find the DVD remote this morning, so I had to just push play on the unit to access the first routine (cardio explosion.) I was absolutely DRENCHED and I didn't even finish it (To my credit, I had already gone on a quick 10 minute warm-up run outside and it felt like I had done at least 30-40 minutes with Billy.) Without the remote, I had no idea how long we had been going. My first impression is that this routine is killer for toning up your triceps and getting rid of some of that back of the arm fat and flab with all his punches, upper cuts, blocks and strikes. The other people in the video performing the moves and counting to ""8"" along with Billy's, ""pump it"" ""c'mon"" ""explode"" and other banter really got me fired up. It was like a catchy tune you can't get out of your head! Absolutely loved it and can't wait to see what is in store for me with the other routines. I'm very uncoordinated, but was able to keep up fairly well for my first try with this routine. You start the moves slow and then he tells you to ""explode"" and every move at that point becomes at a rapid fire pace. Of course you can go at your own best pace and catch up at the end. There is a enough time in between the intervals (jog in place, etc...) to do that if you are 4 or 5 reps behind because you are trying to keep good form and not hurt yourself.

I like to add new instructors and new routines so there is no muscle memory in repeating the same activities too often.  Upon receipt, we immediately viewed the Max Intensity and were shocked at the lack of intensity.  We skimmed through the entire set to find out if any of it would be worth keeping and it isn't worth our time.

From our perspective, here are our favorites to least favorites:
1.  TAPOUT XT full set is awesome  must include Muay Thai
  a. High intensity and energizing instructor
  b. Fast-paced with no time to get bored between activities
  c. Some workouts require no equipment and some require a resistance band which we sometimes use and sometimes use dumbbells
  d. Great workouts of cardio, resistance training, flexibility and balance (core)
  e. Activities can be done in average sized room
