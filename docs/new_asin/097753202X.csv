7794824,5,097753202X,"This DVD is one of the best ones you will find.  Directed by Antonio Vargas, it emulates his beautiful and dramatic style.  Have you ever seen the movie, Mission Impossible Two?  Antonio Vargas is the director and coreographer of the Flamenco scene.  His reputation precedes himself and it's the same for the dancers in this DVD.  Everything you can imagine about a beautiful dramatic Flamenco dancer is seen here.
Domingo Ortega is strong and his footwork is fantastic.  He has to have the fastest feet of almost any dancer.  He's a combination of so many things.  You have to see him to believe how good he is.  He is graceful, and has a beautiful and very different style.  Andres Pena Moron, ""Wow,"" what a gigantic talent.  He is my favorite.  He is the most traditional in my opinion, and I love traditional Flamenco.  He is artistically handsome and also has a beautiful persona.  He tells you a very beautiful story in a unique way.  You will love the way he dances.  Rafael Campallo He also has a very different style.  His sister is a singer, and he is a very beautiful and strong dancer.  You have to see all these dancers to really believe how good they are.
  If you want to know what Flamenco is all about, if you want to experience it in a close up atmosphere, buy and view this DVD.  I promise, you will not be disapointed, even if you know very little about this beautiful artistic genre. I have bought DVD's or Video's where the camera is too far away and it ruins the quality of the dancers.  It's impossible to know if they are good or not.  Not the case with this movie.  The camera work is worthy of the marvelous footwork, the beautiful gestures, and the sound of the most lovely group of musicians and dancers I have ever heard.  Everyone in the group is good and matches the talent of the dancers.  I guess good dancers attract good musicians and singers.
  These three dancers are the epitome of Flamenco.  All of them have their own particular style, their own persona, their own individual way of expressing Flamenco, and each one is just as good as the other.  They are World Class Dancers, and as expected, they give you all that they have, with no limits.  They are truly amazing performers.  I don't know how they are not as famous as Michael Flatley.  I wish that more Spanish Flamenco dancers would come to America and perform.
  They all are razor sharp in their technique, and have passion for the music and the dance.  It is so obviously who they are.  The music and dance is a part of their spirit and heart.
Don't miss this DVD, the dancers are really wonderful.
And if you have never seen Antonio Vargas perform, you have missed something of the most exquisite beauty.  If you've ever seen him dance it is easy to see his influence on this DVD.  One thing is definite, anyone who works with Antonio Vargas is of a very high caliber.  I cannot say enough good things about this DVD,or about him as a dancer and coreographer.
This DVD has become my favorite, and I have many dance DVD's.",1283126400,2,3024,4.467032967032967
