3796364,1,B001U3QOX8,"If you've seen The Secret and liked it then you will be appalled by this effort.

The quality of the video is appalling, the editing little better.

The presentation smacks of a marketing attempt to profit from Rhonda Byrne's excellent original video.

The information presented is certainly useful but not presented nearly as well as the original and certainly doesn't take you ""beyond"" the secret.

Bob Proctor you always present excellent, well-presented , informative  material - what on earth were you thinking of when you allowed this to be released??",1247529600,5,557,5.144444444444445
3796365,3,B001U3QOX8,"Ok first of all I have been studying metaphysics and the law of attraction for over 20 years. Many deliberate manifestations so yes it does work. Oh and I do ""get it"" even if this review is negative. Sorry this movie was just not all that good.

I was hoping for another secret must like us fans of the movie ""Aliens"" have been wanting another ""Aliens"" and all squeals have fallen short.

And unfortunately this film falls short of what I was also wanting another ""The Secret"" the Original Edition (which I have watched at least 100 times.) Not the ""Extended Edition"" which should be named ""We cut Ester Hicks/Abraham-Hicks out becuase we did not want to honor our royalty agreement any longer"" The vibration and feeling it totally different. But I digress back to this film.

First off the production values are awful, bad green screen, the picture looks pixelated and it make me feel like they just don't care enough to do it right. If your going to ride on the success of the secret and sell to the same audience which is what they are attempting to do by calling it ""Beyond The Secret"" then you MUST have the same level of production and visual quality or you are going to disappoint people(becuase the secret was a pleasure to watch.) That's just smart marketing. Being what this movie is they should have given it a different name because the Secret is a hard act to follow.

Now for the content...becuase I don't mind watching a straight up lecture with a person standing at the podium shot on a home video camera if the content is good.

Next this is not really ""Beyond"" it more like ""The Remedial Secret"" or ""Special Ed Secret"" for people not ready to manifest on higher levels.

It starts with Bob Proctor basically says most of what he said in the secret but less of the important stuff on the subconscious mind.

Most of this movie is about getting you to take action rather than just doing the visualization. It makes it sound like more work which many people feel is what should be taught and thought that ""The Secret"" was just pie in the sky and not realistic and left that out. Yet funny how so many people have stories of manifestations including myself.

The truth is there are many different levels of Manifestation from those that require work to those that do not require anything but intent and desire(I personally enjoy the later the most) This film is for those that want to manifest on the first level and are not ready to move on to higher levels of manifestation yet in my opinion. I have manifested with work and really with almost none at all in life. So all levels have their place. But hey you have to walk before you can run and it all depends on your goals as well some do require physical work.

For me I did not find this all that informative (but I have been studying 20 years I did not learn much from ""The Secret"" but it really inspired me) So if you are new to this stuff you might learn some good things here.

To me it was not all that inspiring and actually rather limiting in terms of what is possible and how you can achieve it.

This film at times seems to seek to take the ""Hows"" back from the universe and get you to figure out the ""Hows"" yourself and one author even gives you very good process on how to do this by moving beyond your own limited thinking.

Let me sum it up this way. The way I found ""The Secret"" I had been studying Law of Attraction and out of the blue someone me sent me a link to a let's say free version of ""The Secret"" on the internet I watched it and was filled with joy and empowered. Right after I looked for ""The Secret"" Web site and ordered the DVD becuase I WANTED to pay them for that amazing, empowering work they produced. I bought several more copies until the pulled the ""Extended Version Scam"" Which totally turned me off. You can actually feel the vibrational difference between the two.

If today someone had sent me a link ""Beyond The Secret"" after watching it I would have just deleted it and be glad I did have to pay to see it.

Over all nothing has come close to the Original Secret Movie yet and I have seen and own almost all of them...

The Secret *****
The Secret Extended ***
The Secret Behind The Secret **** (This is the best for just Law of Attraction Information)
Pass It On *** (like this movie but focused more on business techniques/advice)
The Moses Code ** (Depressing in my opinion, not a feel good movie)
You can Heal Your Life **** (but the audio track was too low, maybe fixed now I hope?)
What the Bleep **** (Started this whole industry)
What the Bleep Down The Rabbit Hole ***** Great 6 hours on random play!
DeePak Chopra How to Know GOD **** (Great for a deeper view of the quantum filed and GOD)

If this movie is right for you then you will be attracted to it and get something from it. I personally feel your time would be better spent using Tony Robbins Get The Edge if you want practical first level manifestation information, 10 x the cost but worth every penny!",1247011200,77,4981,4.357065803667745
3796366,5,B001U3QOX8,"If you are expecting a Hollywood movie with flashy special effects or the fluff of ""The Secret"" you will be disappointed as some of the other reviewers are.  If you are looking for an EDUCATIONAL, to the point, concise film showing you the nuts and bolts of how to apply what you learned in the original , the law of attraction, then this is the film for you.

As an educational video, ""Beyond the Secret"" packs a great deal of information at a steady pace - and NO, you can't just watch it once and ""get it"".  It is a dvd you will want to watch over and over to master the concepts.

And the teachers don't talk fast like they are told to ""rush"" as another reviewer wrote .  They are unscripted and talking from their hearts and from experience.

The negative reviews seem to be posted by those who didn't understand the original ""The Secret"" and viewed ""Beyond the Secret"" with the negative eye that makes readers know they just ""don't get it"".

You can't go wrong with this dvd.",1247011200,41,981,4.357142857142857
3796367,1,B001U3QOX8,"I adore The Secret. I've watched it several times and shared it with friends.

THIS, most assuredly, is NOT what I expected. The production values are bad. Very bad. And, it's all made worse because the original film set me up to expect something as least as good as the original, if not better.

Where's the cohesive presentation? Where's the enlightening/humorous/entertaining illustrations to bring it all to life? Beyond the Secret seems as though it was rushed into production to cash in on the impact of the original, even though we sure waited long enough for the release. So... didn't they have enough time to put together something more professional looking? Certainly, they had enough money to produce a better product than this!

My greatest disappointment is for some of the speakers, who act as though they've been told, ""Talk fast -- we're running out of film."" How many times should we be required to re-run a segment just to figure out what they are saying? Why is the sound quality so bad? There are good thoughts there, but sometimes they rush by like a speeding bullet. Why? Where was the director?

The truth is that Beyond The Secret has the look and feel of a student film. I am forced to give it a C, and that's only out of affection for the first project.

My sincere recommendation is that you watch the original again, rather than waste your money on this DVD. Rent it, borrow it, but don't waste your money.

What a sad, sorry disappointment of a film! I am amazed that they released something this poor when we all know that they are capable of so very much more. Beyond the Secret is an embarrassment, and I feel that the audience is most definitely due an explanation and an apology --perhaps accompanied by a refund.

JULY 31, 2009: As a post-script to this review, I want to add that I recently contacted the creators of the original DVD, The Secret, and I was informed that they have no connection at all to this project. For me, that answers all the questions about the awful quality of this film! Therefore, deduct two stars from my original rating of Beyond the Secret.

Let the buyer beware!",1246665600,2,2128,4.611111111111111
3796368,3,B001U3QOX8,"First off, I'm a huge fan of the original Secret, and fully believe in it and use it in my daily life with success, but working to have it work even better in my life.

Unfortunately I have more criticisms than praise. I realize that may seem almost against the spirit of these films...any kind of negativity. But let's look at it as critiques to hopefully make any future project of theirs better...

I even went to the preview in the theaters that cost $30 each ticket, and even paid for my girlfriend's. The preview, which was a recording of the UCLA panel talk with Liza Gibbons,had some initial audio problems in the theater, and some people left. The rest of us were patient and saw the rest of the preview. I thought was even more inspiring to me than this movie actually. To me, it seemed like a test, in a way, if you can be patient enough to get past some technical difficulties, you'll get your reward. (A reflection of life and how you deal with it) Anyway, I could get past this.

Then, I pre-ordered the dvd and it was pushed back til June. I could deal with that too.

I don't have a big problem with the content, more of the production values. Although, the panel discussion movie I felt way more inspired. This movie left me empty and it seemed to end fast. I think I know why.

Besides the horribly done green screen (Sorry, I sound so pessimistic here.) The pacing and structure seemed lightning fast, and no time to rest and digest. Remember the original Secret? There were chapters and moments to breath. This movie was one after the other of the teachers talking, non-stop, then parts felt like they were yelling at you. If you were to blur out the words and hear the TONE, it didn't seem as comforting and inspiring as the original Secret.

The movie ended, THEN I could take a breath, but then it was like, oh, it's over already? It's like force feeding you food instead of letting you chew it and savor each bite, then letting you take a drink. It was delivered using a shovel. I can barely remember anything they said because those things distracted me so much.

Sorry, but that's my initial reaction...and I think there should be something said for that. I'll need to watch it again to actually digest anything.

Let me encompass the dvd in this way. You can have the finest and best tasting foods, but if you have to eat it all in 1 minute, it's not going to taste the same because you had no time to savor it.  The content is still very valuable, the delivery was something left to be desired.",1246492800,7,2522,4.394849785407725
3796369,5,B001U3QOX8,"My son Mark Moffitt is in the cast and I was at the L.A. premier on June 18 with him!  But I can still give an honest review of the film !!!

""Beyond the Secret"" was great!  It took the hocus pocus out of ""The Secret"" and showed you the real-life say to apply the principles to your real life and see changes.  For the very logical-minded folks like me, wishing for something and posting a pic on a board never made sense.  THIS dvd shows you what to do AFTER you post the pic to make it happen by doing the steps to get you there ......not just sitting at home on the sofa wishing !

If all the comments I've gotten on my myspace page on the premier pics is any indication, this dvd is going to be even bigger than ""The Secret"" ! It was educational, practical and magical all at once !

Some great material on the Law of Vibration, Law of Gestation, and other universal laws not covered in ""The Secret.""  And like ""The Secret,"" the production values are excellent.  I plan on watching it again and again to learn as much as possible.

It's nothing I would watch over and over again like ""The Secret"".  Didn't hear anything new and it didn't leave me with the ""wow"" factor when it was over, with my wheels spinning, replaying what I heard over and over again in my mind.  In fact, the minute it was over, it was really over...I just forgot about it.  Can't put my finger on it, but it just didn't do anything for me.

I like it because if you know the bible you will see how much parallels with how God has told us to do things. It shows the power he has given each of us and inspires you to use it!!!

3796375,3,B001U3QOX8,"I think it was Walter Wattles who initially wrote about the ""Law of Attraction"" in the early 1900s. So this movie is, in effect, the glam version for the those that might prefer to watch rather than read about its tenets. Confucius noted centuries ago that there's nothing new under the sun; perhaps he was on to something after all?
The DVD itself of course had to have a broad-based appeal, something that everyman (and everywoman) could identify with. That said, as long as you know the specific area in your life that needs a tune up, ""The Secret"" might be of some assistance to you.",1297468800,,587,4.547169811320755

3796378,1,B001U3QOX8,"Years ago I attended an MLM seminar with a hopeful friend, which amounted to a full day of marketing brainwashing.  That's what this is, 74 minutes of corporate motivational speakers haranguing us, the hopefuls, on how to be better salespeople and financial geniuses. What little spiritual content there was was buried within tiresome big business rhetoric. The chapters all run together unidentified, without titles, the editing is choppy, the colors very dark and hard to see in daylight hours, and the production values very poor. And the ""Extras"" amounts to sales pitches for several of the speakers. It's definately not in the same league as ""The Secret"". I feel insulted and disgusted.

3796379,1,B001U3QOX8,"First I like Bob Protor and will continue to buy his other products. I like ""The Secret"" also. My low score for this video is as follows:

1. VERY POOR VIDEO QUALITY. The video seems to have been recorded by a teenager making a YouTube movie. In fact most You Tube movies have better video quality.

2. There are no illustrations only and endless series of fast speeches by various New Age Lecturers.

CONCLUSION: Bob Proctor is a great and so are the folks on his video but he bombed out on this one as the video quality is so poor and you feel like you are watching a TENNIS MATCH at Midnight! Back and forth fast segments of speeches while you feel the talk takes place in the dark. No illustration or teaching aids.

Sorry I could not stay awake for the whole presentation as I was getting ""optical fatigue"". Like when someone gets hypnotized! This is meant as a CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM of folks I do admire.

That's weird becuse should these people talk about positive things?? It doesn't make people feel much better if you keep bombarding them with negative stories (more problems to deal with). I gave it to see to friends and they didn't even go past the first half of the DVD!!! Happened a few times. Not a recommender!

3796382,4,B001U3QOX8,"Beyond the Secret is good if you are the kind of person who will take responsibility for your own results. Victim types may get a clue here as the film seeks to explain the connection between our thoughts and our results.  Some will find that nugget of truth that brings it all into focus.  Some will use it as a launch pad to explore further.  The important take-away is that action is what produces results; always has been, always will be.  The key to it is your thinking, and the film does a good job of pointing out a path toward progress.  It is not as ""acted out"" as The Secret was, but the ideas are compelling.  I benefitted from watching this film.",1256860800,2,658,4.308943089430894
3796383,4,B001U3QOX8,"I rented this movie through NETFLIX, and I suggest you do the same. Most movies like ""The Secret"" and ""What the bleep"" are available in Netflix, so don't waste your money buying it first!

First off, let me say that I have watched ""The secret"" and was very excited to see ""Beyond the secret"". You should know, however, that this is NOT the sequel to ""The Secret"", but an expansion of the principles talked about in the first movie. In The Secret, the basic principle being talked about was how INTENTION can change your reality, and in Beyond, the base principle is that you need ACTION to complete the process. Both movies together make up the two steps needed to actually create change in your life. INTENTION (in the first movie) and ACTION (in the second).

So here is my critique of Beyond.

Cons: This film is not the sequel like so many people thought it was going to be. It is basically just the second step of the process to help people affect change in their lives. There really isn't a plot line, this is not a movie that follows the traditional style of story telling with characters, plot, conflict, and resolution. I WOULD NOT recommend this movie for ENTERTAINMENT purposes, which The Secret has more of. The movie is not really exciting with special effects and drama, and should not be watched for those purposes.

The quality of the film-making is also sub par. I'm not sure why this is, but sometimes the images are a tad grainy (which I've seen in other reviews) and the motion seems a tad choppy. When I was watching it, AT PARTS (not throughout the whole movie) I wondered if they actually recorded some of the speakers through a high speed internet connection from a places off studio. There was not much variety in the movie actually. Most of the time, you watch various speakers against a background making short, quick sound bites in reference to a particular subject. It really could of been less ""infomercial-y"" (yes, that's a technical term)

PROS:
The bottom line is that you really SHOULD watch this movie. It is the second part of the the process that helps you affect change in your life, which is the ACTION part. This movie should NOT be watched for it's entertainment purposes, but rather for it's CONTENT which is OUTSTANDING. If you can get over that this is not some Hollywood, special effects, high budget film, then you will see that the actual CONTENT of what they're saying is spot on. Let the words sink into your head, and it will do you great things and help you achieve what you want to achieve. This movie, watched with The Secret, can help you form a more complete picture of how to go and make changes in your life. I stress again, the CONTENT is great, and should be watched for that, and no other reason. I feel bad for people that mislead potential watchers because of low ratings, because they didn't feel it was entertaining enough, or the quality was sub par. WATCH THE MOVIE. GET THE CONTENT. It's about what they're saying anyway!",1256774400,46,2988,4.577570093457944
3796384,4,B001U3QOX8,"This video is the sequel to the inspirational movie The Secret that is based on the Universal Law of Attraction.  This video does answer some questions that the original did not touch upon, and in my opinion is the progression or the next step to The Law of Attraction.

The production is good and in line with The Secret, but lacks a bit of the punch that the original delivered.  This video is a series of inspirational snippets by professional advisers pieced together for approx 90 minutes.  Great for the A.D.D. crowd, although and hour and a half of this is distracting in itself.

I like this video since it talks about the nuances of The Law of Attraction that The Secret failed to cover.  It is good solid information and direction that, like anything else, can be a great asset to ones life if used properly. So, if you choose to allow to let these ideas into your life you may be able to enhance your journey ten fold, however, just like any other good ideas, if you choose to ignore it for any reason it will not do anything for you.

Again, I like this video and give it 4 stars.  This is a good add to any home collection.
