4532943,5,B0052YV3XC,Excellent film and fabulous cast make this work! One of Ann Frances's best! Great scene in the car with Newman and Pidgeon! Well worth seeing! Picture and sound re-done beautifully!,1389571200,2,181,5.066666666666666
4532944,4,B0052YV3XC,"Though competently assembled and well acted by a name-heavy cast -- the sort of serious movie Hollywood studios just don't seem to make anymore -- ""The Rack"" still can't quite shed the feeling that watching it is something you do because it's ""good for you."" One wonders why the MGM of 1956 thought audiences would want to see a heavy, black-and-white drama about returning POWs from the Korean War. (MGM's ""Prisoner of War,"" released in 1954, had already failed at the boxoffice.) It's interesting to note, however, that Walter Pidgeon and Anne Francis, here playing father-in-law and daughter-in-law, had earlier in the year played father and daughter in MGM's ""Forbidden Planet."" It's also worthy of note that Paul Newman and Lee Marvin, here playing adversaries, later appeared as friends (of a sort) in 1972's ""Pocket Money.""",1378425600,2,830,5.110294117647059

8454845,5,B0052YV3XC,"I like Paul Newman and U.S. War movies, very educational. At the end of this movie they read part of the Communist Rule book...U.S.A. now?

8454846,4,B0052YV3XC,"The film touches on a hard aspect of warfare what is the breaking point of a POW and how should it be dealt with, Paul Newman does a fine job of representing a man ridden with guilt and unlike many modern film the ending is left up to each viewer to make up his or her mind as to the reasons behind the guilt of the man being court martial. The ending is well written and leaves you thinking about the soldier's address to the court.",1444003200,,433,4.046511627906977
8454847,5,B0052YV3XC,I purchased this movie because I love Paul Newman.  I was also curious about the movie because Rod Serling had originally written the teleplay.  The movie left me thinking because it has some philosophical undertones.  Overall it is a great movie.,1436832000,,247,4.975609756097561
8454848,5,B0052YV3XC,"Rod Serling's taut script and one of Paul Newman's earlier performances add up to an impressive, thought-provoking motion picture experience.
Korean War collaborator, American Army officer is charged upon release and faces a military court-martial  Newman is thoughtful, Walter Pidgeon
is humanizingly touching as the career-military officer and father who feels betrayed, Edmond O'Brien a concerned and dedicated defense-attorney, Lee Marvin as a fellow P.O.W. who charges Newman as a ""traitor."" and Ann Francis as a loyal widowed sister-in-law all rise above themselves within the framework of the story.  Wendell Corey as the prosecutor is however, somewhat one-dimensional in his portrayal and should have exhibited more of a sense of conscience in his portrayal.  Good film.  Near great.  This one holds your attention throughout.",1426118400,2,835,5.701612903225806
8454849,4,B0052YV3XC,"Captain Edward Hall (Paul Newman) returns to the US after two years in a north korean prison camp. In the camp he was brainwashed and helped the Chinese convince the other prisoners that they were fighting an unjust war. Back home this leads to a charge for collaboration with the enemy. Much to the surprise of the accused and his family. Especially his father (Colonel Walter Pidgeon) is shocked, whilst his sister (Anne Francis)s is supporting him. The military court is dominated by the prosecutor (Wendell Corey) and the defender (Edmond OBrien). Where does loyalty end, when the life in the prison camp is a living hell? Newman, Corey and O'Brien deliver excellent performances in this 1956 picture although there are better examples of films dealing with this subject. This might have to do with the direction of Arnold Laven who is no Sidney Lumet. But altogether the movie is good entertainment. Lee Marvin is seen in a small role. The DVD contains no extras. Image and sound are very good.",1398297600,,999,4.847953216374269
