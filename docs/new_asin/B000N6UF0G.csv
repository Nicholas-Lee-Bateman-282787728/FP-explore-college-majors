2759523,5,B000N6UF0G,"I bought Season One and could not wait for Season Two.  It was just as good, maybe better, than One.  The show with Provenza and Flynn finding the lady in the garage blew me away!  Humor and drama.  Love it!",1182816000,,207,4.1
2759524,5,B000N6UF0G,"This is my absolute favorite show on TV now.  I love Brenda Johnson because she is a petite Southern woman in LA who was thrust into a squad of nearly all men--who had wanted the job--and she earned their respect.  Most people, outside of the Deep South, think that anybody who talks with a distinct, Southern accent has an IQ at least 10 points lower than their own.  Brenda has proved them wrong.  Being from the Deep South that caught me from the very first.  This show also mixes in some comedy, also.  For example, the episode where Flynn and Privenza discover a body in Privenza's garage had my husband nearly rolling in the floor.  It gets serious at the end, but to start with it was hilarious.  This, in my opinion, is one of the best, if not the best, show on TV right now.",1182816000,,783,4.315068493150685
2759525,5,B000N6UF0G,"I recently bought Season 2 on DVD because as time goes on the Closer keeps giving it all they've got. The creator of this series is amazing and keep all of the great episodes coming. From Fritz moving on to meeting Brenda's mother, to murders in Hollywood, to finding a body in Provenza's garage, it is all great! While most mystery/crime series are serious this one has times of comedy and you can't help but laugh. Whether it be a joke that Provenza and Flynn crack or Brenda's constant obsession to sweets...everything about this series is fantastic. The TNT logo does get rather annoying but I think it's the way the series is copyrighted. The picture and sound quality are better than the first season. As each season continues most series go downhill with plot but this one has proven to be wrong.

Season 3 is now on air and so far it's just as great as the previous two! Watch It!! When season 3 comes to DVD I'll be on the pre-order list!",1182384000,2,947,4.442528735632184
2759526,5,B000N6UF0G,"No one says Thank You as well or as much as Brenda Johnson in this remarkable series.  Kyra Sedgwick is brilliant as Johnson, the ""closer"" who takes on closing important criminal cases, with the aid of her diverse team.  Sedgwick consumes the screen with her intensity; her Southern charm; her absentmindedness, her craving for sweets.  The show is sublime in its internal relationships, and Sedgwick's pairing with Jon Tenney as her lover, Fritz, is consummately believable and refreshing.  The writers have managed to integrate personal stories with the main plots quite well, and the whole series is nearly perfect.  I was a little disappointed in the two part finale, which involved terrorists and such, but it was still a good if not great episode.  The rest of the season is just fine, with good support from G. W. Bailey, J.K. Simmons, Tony Denison, Corey Reynolds, Robert Gossett, Raymond Cruz, Gina Ravera and Michael Paul Chan.  But it's Kyra's show and even though she can sometimes be irritating, she is nonetheless a great character.",1181779200,21,1046,5.011560693641618
2759527,5,B000N6UF0G,"Apparently, Warner Home Video heard our complaints about their presentation of Season 1 of ""The Closer"" because Season 2 is definitely better. The quality is smoother and they have more deleted scenes as well as a gag reel and in depth discussion about the beginning and evolution of this unusual woman and her team.

The first season shows us the awkward attempts of the new Deputy Chief of Priority Homicie, Brenda Leigh Johnson, and her team to function as such. They fought through their misconceptions and prejudices to become a top group of investigators with the best interrogator to seal the deal.

Season 2 began with ""Blue Blood"" which dramatized the transformation of those serving under Deputy Chief Johnson with barely concealed hostility to loyal defenders as they investigate the suspicious death of another police officer. Season 2 also shows how willing Brenda is to support her people, even when they have pulled a lame stunt, such as is found in ""To Protect & Serve"", which features Detectives Provenza and Flynn in a few hilarious moments.

Season 2 ended with ""Overkill"" a dramatic offering, which left the future of our heroes in doubt. Months later TNT aired two one-hour specials, ""Serving the King, Pts 1 & 2, which tied up those loose ends with great style. Kevin Bacon, husband of star, Kyra Sedgwick, directed one of the episodes.

Season 1 focused on the dissension among the Priority Homicide team under their new leader. Season 2 focuses on how effective the team is now that they trust and even admire each other. Throw in conflict with the FBI, Brenda's boyfriend Fritz - who is an FBI agent, Kitty getting outside; Captain Taylor's continuing attempts to undermine Deputy Chief Johnson and the Chief's marital problems and viewers find enough drama, humor and intrigue to keep them watching repeatedly, in addition, anxiously waiting for Season 3.",1181088000,19,1881,5.0
2759528,5,B000N6UF0G,Brenda  Johnson is getting better and better. The shows are just as interesting as in the first season. The only problem I see is that there just isn't enough shows!!,1180656000,2,166,4.533333333333333
2759529,5,B000N6UF0G,"I love this series.  I especially like the 2nd season, since it contains my favorite all-time episode-- ""To serve and protect""--great writing and acting!  I watched a few episodes last night, so I can comment that the video and audio are well done, so I'm looking forward to watching the rest of the episodes during the long hot summer of TV wasteland.  Of course, the new Closer season starts up again in a few weeks, thank goodness.",1180483200,2,434,4.6103896103896105
2759530,5,B000N6UF0G,"I did not think this show could get any better but I was wrong. Season 2 was better than the Season 1.  The chemistry between the cast, you can not get any better.  Kyra Sedgewick is Awesome!!!!!  You have to buy this and make sure you pick up season 1 and watch season 3............",1179705600,7,283,4.203703703703703
2759531,5,B000N6UF0G,"Very Enjoyable series. Kyra is great.  Reminds me of an American ""Prime Suspect"" with Helen Mirren.",1179619200,5,99,5.1875
2759532,5,B000N6UF0G,"First Brenda has made me confess--I love this show. The second season features some complications --for Brenda. Fritz proposes moving in and being asked out on a date by her boss spurs her to say yes even though she probably should say no. Then he moves out. Why? Brenda's mom (Francis McDormand)comes to town and, well, she'd just be horrified if her adult daughter had a live-in boyfriend.

The cases vary from bizarre (a police officer and psycho killer manage to kill each other at exactly the same time even though the they weren't standing in the right proximity)to sad (a juror dies just before she and the jury are about to annonce a verdict for a client of a heart attack. It turns out that the jury was threatened). This second season continued the terrific writing,acting and direction as Brenda tried to crack difficult murder cases by cracking the suspects. Kyra Sedgewick continues to be top notch in the role and I'm disappointed and surprised that she hasn't won more awards for her performance. The reality is that this show has such a small but devoted audience (relatively large for basic cable though and TNT)that it's easy to overlook. You shouldn't.

We get a short featurette on the show this time around, a gag reel and deleted scenes. Thank you TNT/Warner for including some nice extras this time around!

She still works for the same cranky boss (now single and who wants to ask her out on a date no less)that she once had an affair with and still pursues her passion of junk food just as ruthlessly as she pursues criminals. The second season is presented in anamorphic so it fills up a widescreen TV. The picture looks terrific.",1174608000,49,1656,4.683848797250859

If you missed the show during its run on television, take the chance and pick of the DVDs. Don't think you'll regret it. When I received the DVD I found that one of the plastic prongs that held one of the discs in place had broken off, leaving the disc rattling around in the case. Fortunately the disc was not scratched and plays perfectly. I've had this happen multiple times when buying DVDs online and in brick and mortar stores but it's probably the only con for the DVD.",1456444800,3,623,4.333333333333333

Because the Country Music Awards ran over last Sunday, my 'tivo' cut off the end of this particular episode.  I attempted to find it on line via the original series, via the local TV station, and via any other means.  Hopefully free.  No success.  So, I finally found it on Amazon, and the price was certainly reasonable; particularly since I had no idea when the opportunity would arise again (in my lifetime!).",1429747200,,517,4.576086956521739

2759830,3,B000N6UF0G,"Kyra Sedgwick is excellent as Brenda and does an outstanding job of highlighting that while brilliant at seeing details others miss to close cases nailing the right person instead of the obvious that she is socially awkward and abrasive making for a humorous character who is aware of her social limitations but working to improve them while continuing to be very successful at what she is paid to do.  The show is a formula show with each episode being largely what others are, but it is entertaining and I enjoy watching it.  While only in Season 3 I realize there are more seasons to come than I have seen so far so my rating is based on a partial perspective of the whole.  While I don't expect the formula nature of the show to change, it works for what it is, I would assume that as it matures those on her staff will learn her heart is in the right place and continue to back her even if making fun of her in the meantime.  Seeing her eat a ding dong is an experience in and of itself.  Shows a lot of diversity as an actress which is what led me to give the show a try as I have liked her work outside of The Closer.  May change this after finishing the series, but as of the end of season 2 it is where it is which is nothing earth shattering but entertaining enough that I will likely keep watching to the end.",1425081600,,1320,4.177165354330708

2759844,5,B000N6UF0G,"Hadn't seen this engrossing, funny, grownup series until recently because it was not on regular TV. Now watching all seven seasons on Amazon, and wish it hadn't morphed into Major Crimes. The female lead in Major Crimes, while competent, is just not Kyra Sedgwick. What an amazing job she did of playing this unique character, Brenda Lee Johnson from Atlanta. She turned it into the most interesting, multi-faceted female role since Scarlett O'Hara, and the character actors cast as her parents were great too. The personal relationships that developed from initial antagonism in the series were the best part. The snippets of music during the shows added to the atmosphere.",1424390400,,674,5.136363636363637

2759887,5,B000N6UF0G,"The 1002nd review for The Closer: Season 2, I doubt I've anything new to add. But I'm so impressed with this show, you cannot shut me up. What I know about Kyra Sedgwick: I know she starred in two of my favorite films in the 1990s: Singles (1992) and Heart and Souls (1993); I know her name constitutes one of the most abrupt games ever of Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon; and I know her - like most of you know her - from seven seasons of her ruling the roost in The Closer.

The Closer is my latest binge watch, TNT's much lamented, dearly departed gem. Was it a smidge of misogyny, I wonder? Or my fatigue of police procedurals? That kept me from tuning into The Closer from jump. I am late to the party, so scootch over on the bandwagon. It's Kyra Sedgwick's best role by far, and the most challenging role by far. Each police procedural requires its own hook to separate itself from its countless ilk, and, for The Closer, that hook is Kyra Sedgwick at the height of her powers.

Newly minted LAPD Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson (Sedgwick) arrives at her new bailiwick - the fledgling Priority Murder Squad - and soaks in the acrimony and the judgy looks from her new colleagues and subordinates. It's a bit of a good old boy network pitted against her, which is all kinds of ironic since Brenda Leigh is very much the Southern belle. And I don't know that you can blame these veteran Los Angelinos, whisked out of their comfort zone and forced to work not only for someone who's not their own but, to boot, she turns out to be a stone cold bi---. She's a dismissive, fidgety hot mess with not the keenest sense of direction and no knack for parallel parking and, boy, does she flaunt that Southern twang. Her ubiquitous ""thank yews"" come off as these dismissive brush offs.

Flawed characters are the best characters, and Brenda Leigh Johnson is about as flawed as they come. She's so good at this one thing, so focused at this one thing - which is wringing confessions out of suspects - that she's let things slide in other areas of her life. Like, how she deals with people. Brenda Leigh is often oblivious, caught up in her own world. Chief Pope, the man she answers to, once apologized for her callous behavior: ""I'm sorry... she sometimes forgets there are other people in the world."" She's only ever nice to someone when she's got them in the Interview Room and about to grill them. We know she extends that courtesy only to lull the suspect to a false sense of security, the poor bastard. But I love how she employs artifice to get her way, whether it's projecting naivet or sympathizing with the suspect or extending cozy southern hospitality. The fake Miss Manners. The Interview Room scenes - where Brenda Leigh goes after her suspect like a starving predator after a limping gazelle in the savannah - are almost always the highlights of each episode. The show manages to keep each of Brenda Leigh's interrogations fresh and, uh, arresting.

It's Season 2 now, so things have evolved at the workplace. Her Priority Murder crew has come around. They've got her back now, unequivocally, even Provenza and Flynn, once her two biggest detractors within the squad. Ah, Provenza and Flynn, who feature in one of my favorite episodes (""To Protect and Serve"") wherein they hold off reporting a dead body until they get back from attending a Dodger game (Skybox tickets, you see). The fallout to that is not only one of the funniest things ever but also illustrates the commitment that Brenda Leigh reciprocates to her squad. She's got THEIR backs, too.

It's not about the crime of the week, it's about the character work and the interplay amongst the murder squad. Sedgwick is complemented by a brilliant supporting cast, none of whom come off as ""actory,"" all of whom come off as REAL. Two grizzled professionals, G.W. Bailey (""Lt. Provenza"") and Tony Denison (""Lt. Flynn""), stand out in a bunch of standouts. Anyway, I love this show, and I'm mortified that I came by it after its run. Is it too soon to give weight to those who say The Closer is as good as Prime Suspect? Certainly, in Chief Johnson, we have someone who can look Det. Superintendent Tennison in the eye and not flinch. Brenda Leigh, with her frequent insensitivity and distracting tics and quirks, with unusual methods of obtaining confessions, with her absence of political agenda, with her sheer fearlessness matched only by her deep insecurities, is a hell of a closer, hell of a woman. Right, Kevin Bacon?",1422057600,,4486,4.609511889862328

Brenda Johnson has the highest ideals that are informed by wisdom with a high regard for a civil society under law in the best sense of the phrase. She is righteously indignant when the ""old boys"" bend the rules and flaunt their male code. She demands respect yet presents herself vulnerable to criminals who only understand force. Every character makes mistakes and is held accountable yet manage to turn a situation around to a better outcome than anticipated. This is a series for intelligent people who can understand the human shades of gray in a black and white world.",1417392000,,723,4.746031746031746

There is always a nice of enough twist to each case to keep you coming back just to find out how ""Chief Brenda"" is going to get her team and her self out of one more jam after another.  There is always something for everybody to get hooked on.  Good character development and some cases are complex enough to have you having to wait until the last 5 minutes before all the pieces fall together.  A word of caution; if you love chocolate you may be tempted to join Brenda in one more bite of this delicious series.  She's the sweetest flatfoot to ever wear a skirt.

It is her ability to ""close"" a case, to persuade a criminal to confess to a crime, that is the basis for the title of this Emmy winning series. Of course, the chief's personal life as well as her struggles to gain the confidence of  her team and to prove herself to her superiors, all of whom are male, add some spice to each episode.

I especially appreciate that Deputy Chief Brenda Lee (the main character) is not a clichd character (you know the type: surly, hinted-at dark back story, chip-on-her-shoulder) she gets results by being exactly who she is (e.g. employing her Southern charm to great effect), rather than the more typical powerful-woman-acting-like-a-man scenario.

French crime movies are just as interesting, but they have different approach of not showing as much violence, it is inferred or off screen, and the rest of the show has to support the characters and make it interesting to watch.

2760225,5,B000N6UF0G,The Closer season 2 stories are first-rate.  Watching Brenda interview her suspects is so fun to watch.  She goes from sweet and compassionate to attack dog in a split second.  There's just the right amount of humor and drama and when it needs to be serious it is! The relationship developing between Brenda and FBI special agent Fritz Howard is one of the best things about the series. Watch this and you won't be dissappointed.,1405728000,,429,4.693333333333333

K. Sedgwick the star (she's good - however  a little over the top for me).

Its the support staff that makes the show.

Its worth watching.

2760238,4,B000N6UF0G,"I liked Season 1 a lot as the stories were good and the characters were all new to me and as the season went along I got to know them. I'm a bit worried about this program as I work thru Season 2 because it seems the writers are beginning to  over emphasizie the quirkiness of Brenda Johnson (Kyra Sedgewick). You know, a little of this is cute, interesting and amusing, but if carried too far, it becomes unbelievable, annoying and just plain stupid.

Anyone who was a fan of Monk will understand what I mean, as Monk's OCD behavior became so over the top ridiculous that the show was unwatchable as it went along. I know The Closer ran for several seasons (7?) and I have enjoyed it thru Season 1 and the first few episodes of Season 2, but may not be able to handle it if Brenda becomes too unbelievable.",1405209600,,807,4.26797385620915

However, if I had to make one complaint:what is with all these postal workers/trucks showing up everywhere (and not just that one episode with the mail carrier, I mean)? I work for the USPS as a mail carrier and seeing the postal trucks and mail carriers pop up just about every damn episode, just makes me want to cry.

It begins to consider a few extra major themes like age and race in the relationships among the members of PHD.  But does not allow those issues to overwhelm the excellent writing. Allowing several of the other members of the squad to have more of a personal backstory gives a greater depth to the interactions,  great writing, good cast of bad guys.

2760281,4,B000N6UF0G,"There are so many cop shows out there I had to force myself to try yet another cop series.  But there's a great twist to this one.  The lead character is a blond, big-hair southern woman who is the Deputy Chief of a homicide team on the LAPD.  She also has daddy issues and an insatiable sweet tooth.  She oozes southern-hospitality sweetness while she barks orders at her staff with all the finesse of a longshoreman and is amazingly adept at getting confessions from murderous bad ""guys.""  She's definitely a pretty woman, but her compulsive dedication to her job leaves her clueless about how to relate to her FBI boyfriend.  Each episode has an interesting murder plot and also interesting challenges in her personal life.  So, I like it because it's a different sort of cop show.",1402358400,,784,4.678832116788321

2760312,5,B000N6UF0G,"Some programs are entertaining and some are educating as well.  The Close provides both.  There is examples of intuition, politics (of course) and reading between the lines.  The Closer shows some aspects of the law that are not communicated in life, however we all know it happens.  There is much that the news media can not say to us that we all know is true so it bleeds out through programs such as this one.  Kyra Sedwick Bacon is a great actress.  She has a history of great parts.  Provenza is an example of a policeman that says what he thinks.  Flynn is a typical cop that stretches the law for his own gain yet shows much loyalty to Brenda once he sees her true ability.
Yes, there is a lot of Big Me and Little You within the department, same in real life. Watch your back is a way of life in any vocation, Loyalty is as well.  The Closer shows how people put on their professional face and then the hair down face.",1399334400,,926,4.2457142857142856

I love Detective Brenda. She turns from a sweet southern belle into a stone hard interrogator with ice in her veins in less than a minute. The shows always opens with a scene that grabs me instantly  and from time to time a new character comes on, the one who plays Capt ? who investigates officer involved shootings really is a biotch.

2760373,5,B000N6UF0G,"Myra Sedgewick plays chief detective with a child's relish. ""Brenda"" her character, has Southern charm and sexiness despite being on a mostly male squad of Los Angelos detectives special homicide unit.  Her whip smart mind and attention to detail make her the born leader despite any prejudices the old guard had before she solved her first case. With the humor of an old fashioned novel and minus the gore, gratuitous sex scenes and situations that most American crime dramas rely on make this for a fun yet interesting bit of tv. She loves her kitty, whom she never names, she loves her boyfriend, yet blames him for everything and relys on him for almost everything domestic. She is all girl who is good at the boys games, not so good at the girl stuff. The show is episodic most of the time which hasn't really allowed the writers to get very deep into most of the characters but the upside of that is you don't get lost in one episode only seeing a single character's journey and then feel like you have to watch 20 episodes to figure out what is going on with your other favorite storylineswhich happens to me repeatedly on shows like Justified or True detective. If there was a nice middle where the writers were able to dig a bit deeper but definitely kept the humor and light parts of life dominate it would make it even more engaging.",1393632000,,1344,4.530864197530864

That being said I don't enjoy the gory crime scenes, or the portrayal of cops being cavalier about corpses, which occurs in some episodes, or the portrayal of the heroine as having neurotic issues.  I'd rather see this smart heroine solve cases without a neurosis undercutting her.  I've learned to fast-forward through the unnecessarily graphic coverage of victims.

The humor is subtle but effective, the tension between characters often brings home the reality of different people, with very different ideas, having to deal with each other in workplace situations.  And, as the show progresses through several seasons, the writers are unafraid of tackling sensitive but pertinent issues that come up in real life.",1389398400,,498,5.2125

Kyra Sedgewick is great in this, love her character with all her little foibles.  The goodies she stashes in her desk, her wardrobe is not exactly ""executive"", her toughness on the job--interrogation skills-contradicts her southern lady persona.",1384214400,,351,4.932203389830509

2760483,3,B000N6UF0G,Love Kyra Sedgewick. The plots are rather predicable; I can usually guess the killer before halfway through the episode. There are so few female protagonists that I'll likely keep watching. It's good for watching during workouts.,1383350400,,229,5.388888888888889

2760490,5,B000N6UF0G,"My favorite mystery series ever. Kyra Sedgwick is perfect in this show, as are all the characters. My husband's favorite is the onry Provenza. Pope is very believable as Brenda's former flame, with just enough edge to be her boss. So enjoyed EVERY actor in their roles. Hate the gore but it's after the fact... Solving the crime is the story NOT seeing it committed. Just enough humor to keep it believable. Love love love this entire series!",1382140800,,442,4.67948717948718

2760493,5,B000N6UF0G,"Brenda Leigh (don't misspell that!) is awkwardly charming in this series that is consistently stimulating and realistic.  Kyra Sedgwick keeps us unfailingly intrigued with Brenda Leigh. As we become increasingly aware of her private life and inner challenges, we relate with her more and more.  And it's really nice how that understanding of her character unfolds gradually for us over the first couple of seasons.  These are intellectual and emotional (but not overworked), realistic, curiously complex, and never fall flat, episode after episode.
The quality and consistency is rewarding, and I hope these become classic.  Brenda Leigh makes a classic character; and so far, the team doesn't turn over.  (That's important!)
If you like intellectual complexity that is not overdone, and want to find yourself relating to a great team of people onscreen, this is one of those experiences.",1381708800,,888,5.359712230215828

2760495,5,B000N6UF0G,"A cop drama that breaks the mold. Kyra Sedgwick's portrayal of LAPD Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson is flawless. She is at once both likable and annoying -- like real people. Having only watched through the second season, I don't know if the high quality of acting continues or how true to the origins the scriptwriters adhere. But as of this season, this is a great series to watch and one that will not disappoint.",1381104000,,412,4.581081081081081

2760498,5,B000N6UF0G,I love watching the old series frome TV and this is a good one.  Amazon needs to add some of the older ones to the list for us older people to enjoiy. Some of them are real good and perhaps those who where not of my age would enjoiy them.,1380844800,,238,3.76

Sedgewick is a treat to watch as she turns the screws on suspects, all the while fumbling with that darn purse and those inconvenient glasses.  Now that it's available to stream, sans commercials, it joins the list of binge-watching options.

My only complaint is with Prime's funky HD vs SD streaming....my box always chokes on HD and there's no way to choose SD as standard default.  I waste a lot of time waiting for shows to load (unlike HULU or Netflix).",1378425600,,585,4.650485436893204

The group of almost all male detectives put her through the paces, but she pushes back in gentle ways, always using her southern charm to calm a situation. The men learn to respect her as they watch her in action -- closing the deal, so to speak. Brenda gets perps to confess by expertly sidling up to them with that southern charm, disarming them. Then, like the snap of a southern gator, she latches onto the lie, the statement that doesn't match, or the arrogance of the criminal and twists them in a verbal death roll taking them down and closing the case.

It is an excellent series that mixes a ""whodunnit"" with great characters and a touch of great humor in it.  You'll find yourself loving the characters and wanting more after each episode.  Kyra Sedgewick is amazing as the lead character too.  It is not voyeuristic in terms of how it shows murder victims, etc. so it's suitable even for teenagers.  I can't recommend the series enough.",1373760000,,523,4.56989247311828

2760577,5,B000N6UF0G,"Kyra Sedgwick takes off to new heights from the first season of this crime drama.  You care for these characters.  The acting is superb.  The stories never fail to be interesting and the character development of the regulars is engrossing. If you aren't fans of Provenza and Flynn after watching this season, you are a cold fish indeed.  And Brenda Leigh Johnson is a wonderful meld of excellent writing and superb acting.  Where the casting crew gets the talent to flesh out these episodes I have no idea.  Other shows surely don't know the secret.  If the LAPD actually had a division with such talents... well, it would be world class. A show not to be missed and amazon.com offers it to Prime members free.",1372550400,,710,4.632

2760592,5,B000N6UF0G,"She really is a sweetheart with a very large heart but also a sometime, profound, quiet, egotistical bitch with a purpose but you have to respect her for who she is. Although she has a usual material trail to follow, it is like Sherlock and Lastarde She goes by the seat of her pants  because the trail says one thing and it is another. Very perceptive. She is the one that gets passed male/female. She is the one that respects her guys and gals and knows they will do the sometime, small, but vital tasks she assigns them. They know why they are there and what they are capable of doing. I would give this a 10 if the score went that high on any of her DVDs.",1371168000,,659,4.1484375

2760594,5,B000N6UF0G,"Nobody does it better than Kyra Sedgwick.  She takes a complicated character and teases out all the emotional layers until the audience relates to her strength, commitment to her duty, and her underlying insecurities.  This show never disappointed, but the first few seasons had a dramatic tension that waned a bit as Brenda developed a closer relationship to the detectives she supervised.  It is rewarding to travel back to the beginning, realizing how much we miss the character and the series.",1371081600,,497,5.111111111111111

2760597,5,B000N6UF0G,I really like the way Kyra Sedgwick portrays her character.  It's not like watching a series but life like.  I get caught up in the story and how she figures out who did it.  She does it her way and not the way the men expect.  She also gains the respect of her fellow workers by being her self.  Not to mention a sexy husband.  Thank You!!!!,1370995200,,342,4.029850746268656

2760604,5,B000N6UF0G,Although Kyra Sedgwick is the definite star I enjoy the entire cast and their interactions. The plots are good and there is enough humor to not make it dark like 'Law and Order SVU' for example. I didn't watch the show while it ran in regular seasons so I plan to watch the entire run on Amazon,1370044800,,294,4.175438596491228

2760607,5,B000N6UF0G,"The characters are what make THE CLOSER a winner. It's rare to find a dramatic cop/crime-solving series that is character-driven rather than just plot-driven. THE CLOSER is one of those rare gems. This is not to say that the plots are underdeveloped or given short shrift--they are compelling and  suspenseful. But the characters are what make this show great. The characters--their motives, their relationships, their quirks and idiosyncrasies--are fully developed and form a thread throughout the episodes, tying them together to make a fuller and richer story. The characters are not one-sided, stick figures, but well-rounded, with strenths but also foibles, weaknesses. And they're funny. Really funny. This show is not all drama and death. As tragic and serious as some of the crimes are, and the problems/weaknesses the characters struggle with, there is always humor woven in--great writing.",1369958400,,899,5.467625899280575

All the characters have strengths and weaknesses that you are introduced to slowly, over time. These complex characters make the show fun and interesting.

What I enjoy most about the series is the way that the team works together to overcome obstacles in identifying the murderer. Unlike many dramas on the air now, super-science that does not exist isn't used on the show.

If you like simple, good guys vs bad guys shows, this probably isn't for you.",1367798400,,700,4.721311475409836

2760646,5,B000N6UF0G,"I discovered this series a couple years in,so I missed the early seasons  and many of following episodes.  It's just great TV, mystery without too much gore.  Then a dab of humour is tossed in.  She may not be the most plausible character, but I don't think brutal reality is entertaining. Kyra Sedwick and supporting cast worked more like an ensemble cast, they were great. I'm very happy it's on Prime.",1367107200,,404,4.647887323943662
2760647,5,B000N6UF0G,The second season is just as good as the first if not better.  It doesn't make law enforcement look easy--nor relationships. It shows that they both take perseverance.  The characters are fantastic.,1367107200,,198,5.15625

2760660,5,B000N6UF0G,"My father-in-law recommended this to me several years ago. Now retired, I started watching it on Amazon Prime and was thrilled with the show. Great acting and drama every show. I'm glad I've started watching it.",1366502400,,211,4.888888888888889
2760661,5,B000N6UF0G,"The Closer makes for enjoyable television watching.  It's fun to watch these characters develop, relationships emerge and deteriorate and cases salved.

2760663,4,B000N6UF0G,"Brenda is an entertaining character.  She had alot of ""issues"" but it makes her human.  So far, I haven't come up against any real bias as so many shows have.  There are ""good"" cops and ""bad"" cops.  There are ""good"" religous and ""bad"" religous.  No ONE group has so far been ""singled out"" as bad.",1366416000,,296,4.3090909090909095
2760664,5,B000N6UF0G,Cable TV at its best.  Love the strong central female character. The surrounding ensemble cast is varied and each is interesting in his or her own right.,1366416000,,153,4.666666666666667

2760667,5,B000N6UF0G,"I discovered ""The Closer"" on my Kindle Fire.  I loved it from the first viewing.  It is light, funny and the characters are true.

2760673,5,B000N6UF0G,"From the southern ""Thank you"" to the concern for family approval, Brenda offers the perfect counterpoint to the tough, hard-boiled investigator model.  The team members each contribute to the over-all success of this show in a special way--making it a wonderful ensemble cast.  My favorite series.",1365638400,,297,5.434782608695652

2760676,5,B000N6UF0G,I didn't watch this show when it aired on television...now I know what I was missing.  Detective Johnson and her staff have great chemistry and the show is not your usual who dunnit.  The twist that this show puts on is why and how.

2760679,4,B000N6UF0G,The mix of case mystery & character back stories are smooth and exciting. Makes the detectives the good guys who are humans not super heroes.,1365206400,,141,4.68
2760680,5,B000N6UF0G,"Keira Sedgewick is great in the role, she nails the southern accent, without overdoing it.
The script writers do an excellent job of writing each episode, and especially weaving continuity with the back story.",1365120000,,209,5.176470588235294
2760681,4,B000N6UF0G,"In the first season of The Closer, the producers completely remade the police procedural. It was no longer enough for the police to make an arrest, but they had to lock down their evidence and in the best case a confession. In the second season, the show starts to explore the new territory. It has some of the most humorous episodes, which don't break the drama of the show. Unlike later seasons where the ""I Must Break You"" interview where Brenda Leigh gets the suspects to confess starts to wear thinly, this season still has a lot of surprises. If you didn't see it when it was on cable, this is a great way to see one of the best seasons of this interesting show.",1365033600,,668,4.352

2760694,5,B000N6UF0G,The nice part of this program is that it slowly fleshes out the people that you met in the first season.  You can appreciate each program as an individual show but the overall impression adds to the entire series.,1364256000,,213,4.461538461538462

It is interesting and the chemistry between all the characters is great. I'd say this would be a good show for someone who likes the crime dramas but the subject matter can be very heavy at times.

2760764,5,B000N6UF0G,The Closer is always fun to watch.  It is the best escapist TV ever.  I often feel cheated when i waste an hour watching a made up Detective Drama.  I am an X cop and wonder why i ever watch Police shows on TV.  But this one is great.  You usually won't figure out the end in the 1st 5 minutes and you will always come away with a smile especially regarding The Chief:),1361145600,,369,3.9324324324324325

2760774,5,B000N6UF0G,"I love the Closer. Brenda is a great role model. She is constantly underestimated by the other characters, especially the criminals she gets to confess. She is intelligent, beautiful, and best of all she doesn't care what others think about her.  This show Isn't so much a mystery whodunit as much as it is about how will Brenda outwit the criminal and convince them to confess. Like Columbo, one of my favorite things about watching this show is not figuring out who did it but figuring out exactly when Brenda figures it out.",1360713600,,527,4.666666666666667

2760778,4,B000N6UF0G,"It is the same 'ol, same'ol stuff, but the formula worked apparently, so why not?  I just like Kyra Sedgwick and I like the team, especially Provenza (from Police Academy!).  The acting is solid to me.  A lot of the stories are obvious to me from the beginning, but it still entertains me and I just like it.  I think her FBI boyfriend Fritz is a hottie and that always helps.  I will continue watching......on to Season 3!",1360454400,,423,4.371794871794871

2760780,4,B000N6UF0G,An interesting mix of police work and personalities. At times funny and at other times dramatic. The drama is not overly gory and it isn't pushing sex as a way to hold our interset. The dynamics among the Major crime squad characters is balanced and funny at the same time show co-oeration and brotherhood. I would recommend it.,1360454400,,328,4.672413793103448
2760781,5,B000N6UF0G,I never watched the Closer when it was on the air. Too many commercials. It is a great show and Kyra and the cast  do a great job.

2760783,5,B000N6UF0G,One of the best procedural series out there. Brenda Lee Johnson is full of pathos and the dance between she and the other cast members is rewarding to watch. Prime Suspect comes to mind and that ain't bad.,1360454400,,205,4.421052631578948

though this is entertainment, it still is a reminder of the ups and downs and the emotional situations they can encounter and the danger of course.  And the touch of having a woman in the role shows the challenges of such a role for women.  Hardly ever do we think of The Closer of a case.  But as other shows that have come out with different aspects of the criminal investigation teams, it is interesting to reflect on such a person and how serious such a job can be.",1357862400,,552,4.228571428571429

Rather than miss the game and sitting in a skybox, they decide to leave the body in the garage and head to the game in Flynn's wheezing car. The car finally dies and the guys are back at Provenza's garage - but the dead body is no where to be found. From this point on, it is a race against time for the guys to get help from their team to find the body and resolve the murder before Polk and Taylor find out the original crime scene was not where the body finally landed.

Johnson.  Being a southerer myself, some of the characters actions and dialogue is ridiculous but
the way she seems to encourage the suspect to talk is funny and convincing.  I have really
enjoyed these DVD's and will watch them again soon.",1329868800,,418,4.698630136986301
2760803,4,B000N6UF0G,"I must admit that I'm new to this series.  As the title to this piece indicates, so far I've only watched the second disc of the second season.  I do like it, however, mostly because of the rather quirky character of Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson.  Her rank poses a question in my mind; some might say because of an overly active left-brain.  In one episode, Brenda Johnson has her 40th birthday.  The rank of deputy chief in the LAPD is a VERY high rank; one would assume that it would require many years of excellent service (along with some luck plus high-level mentoring) to rise that high.  So, my question is: how could Brenda Johnson have made the rank of deputy chief before her 40th birthday?  To continue, according to the LAPD organizational chart, the rank of deputy chief is a command level rank; a person of that rank usually commands a bureau (which is made of of several areas (analogous to precincts in NYC)) or a specialized city-wide function, such as the Detective Bureau or the SWAT/Special Operations Bureau.  So-o-o-o, why is Deputy Chief Johnson depicted as commanding a squad (albeit a rank-heavy one as there seem to be two or three detective lieutenants and two or three detective sergeants)?  OK, now for my last and final question.  Perhaps I missed something, but in the episodes that I watched, Brenda Johnson refers certain persons with the title of ""commander"", whom she seems to treat as her superior officers.  However, again referring to the LAPD org chart (and on-line LAPD rank structure), a commander is subordinate to a deputy chief.  Again, did I miss something?

Oh yeah, The Closer has police characters that are not what one would usually expect in a ""cop show"".  And the plots are interesting, as well.",1327276800,,1745,4.754152823920266

Kyra Sedgwick is amazing as Brenda Johnson ( stay with it and the southern thing, it'll grow on you once you understand the background!!!)

2760822,5,B000N6UF0G,"Yes, I enjoyed watching SEASON 2. The outtakes and extras were welcome and I have to admit the cases were even harder for me to crack as quickly as I normally do. But that is good thing.

Kyra Sedgwick (wife of Kevin Bacon,currently) is the a detective, who is now LAPD, from being formerly a CIA agent and also a a southern belle transplant in LOS ANGELES.

Yeah, she has sweet tooth weakness, she has a temper, she is forgetful (this woman loses something, like her purse or cell phone nearly as many times as I do) but she is smart, funny, caring and remarkably astute in her observation and deduction skills.

She almost always has the case solved from the early middle part and yet, no one is made aware until she is ready, great job, BRENDA.

and SEASON 2 the cases get trickier and the are definitely somewhat more interesting than SEASON 1",1289433600,,847,4.445161290322581

Refreshing over so many of the other law and order and stick something ugly in your face for sensationalism just because they can...more competing with one another on network TV than caring about the quality these days. NCIS and the new Mentalist programs are good. But the Mentalist could be so easily undone if they decide to kick it up next year. So jury is still out on that. The Closer oh my makes up for just about all the other shows and writers vices....the humorous ones the better. The cat so funny.....more more more and please don't quit or fall apart after 5 seasons....soon to be out on DVD too. Waiting just a few more days....we don't have satelite and pay for TV in our rural area. So love these DVD gems when you can find them. (House, Closer, Mash of course the classic to end all classics, Bones, you know less rude and crude stick it in your face shows and also their secret they build a cast that has relationships with one another.

2760833,5,B000N6UF0G,"that is able to pickup where it left off in the first season.  The Closer follows Golden Globe winner Kyra Sedgewick as she leads us through the inner workings of closing a case.  Filled with drama, intrigue, emotion and sometimes downright funny situations.  It works because it shows us how the job affects each and every person involved in the process.  From her sometimes live in boyfriend, to her mom and her suprise visit, to the cat that comes in and out of the house on a regular basis, to her coworkers.

The Closer really works for so many people, it's an all around great show that should only continue to get better with each season and as this show ended (SPOILER) With her taking down a terrorist organization among them.(END SPOILER).  It will keep you coming back and wanting more.  I plan on purchasing Season 3 very soon.

2760837,4,B000N6UF0G,"I won't rehash how great the series is with its wonderful character in Chief Brenda Johnson. She's smart, and quirky, comes across as a real person who could be found in my community (minus the Southern drawl as that's not common in my area).

She has an unusual style of dealing with colleagues and suspects. She finds a way to close a case even when evidence isn't enough to convict a suspect. Despite being powerful in her career, she stumbles in her personal life though she's got a great guy in Fritz Howard, an FBI agent who is also an asset to her cases when she needs FBI info. No matter what, she'll always say ""Please"" and ""Thank you.""

I love the camaraderie with her staff. Flynn and Provenza provide the comic relief. Daniels and Gabriel add balance with their more conservative styles. It's also lovely that Gabriel has a masters degree and an uncanny ability to navigate political waters of LAPD. Tao, Buzz, Taylor, and Pope complete the diverse picture.

The only disappointment comes in that the extras aren't captioned or subtitled. Unfortunately, it's hit or miss for most DVDs. Some have it and some don't. This one doesn't (for all three seasons. Maybe they'll fix it in Season 4, but I am not expecting it).",1229558400,,1229,4.654377880184332

I love Provenza and Flynn in particular - refreshing to not have a cast completely composed of beautiful young people.

Of course, the character of Brenda is the centerpiece, but I think the best part of the show is the development of all the quirky traits of all the supporting characters and their interactions with one another and Brenda.

Sharp writing, excellent casting (guests as well as the regulars), interesting plots, and a generous dose of humor make this my only ""must-see TV.""  Unlike many police dramas, ""The Closer"" is character-driven, with good plots, not the other way around.  You get to know Deputy Chief Johnson and her squad - who are almost more like a family than office colleagues - and you look forward to seeing what develops for them next.

Season 2 is consistently good, but there are a few highlights. ""To Protect and Serve"" is absolutely priceless - a hilarious premise, expertly played throughout by Kyra Sedgwick, G.W. Bailey and Tony Denison.  The last three episodes (""Overkill"" and ""Serving the King,"" Parts 1 and 2) are more serious, and really demonstrate how the squad takes care of each other.

The second season is even better than the first, exploring Brenda's immense charm and manipulation strategies while giving even more insight into her imperfections.

2760891,5,B000N6UF0G,"Thoroughly enjoyed the first season and when it was on last yr. as a re-do for the 2nd season, I added oit to DVR.  Then watched it off and on till the 3rd season started.  When it is on DVD, I will order 3rd season.  Kyra Sedgewick is fantastic and they couldn't have a better bunch to support her.  The writers must be great as they put out a splendid bunch of writing.  Looking forward to having all of the DVD's as long as they are on.",1183420800,,439,4.0

2760895,5,B000N6UF0G,"I picked up the series at the local DVD store as there was nothing else to watch. Have not regretted it....
Have almost finished Season 2 and eagerly anticipating Season 3.
Was not familiar with any of the stars, save for the ex Policy Academy star.
Enjoy the humour, and how Brenda doesn't give a hoot about what the others think and stays focused on the task at hand.
Couldn't help thinking that Breanda was a female version of 'Columbo' (Peter Falk).",1183161600,,453,4.536585365853658
2760896,5,B000N6UF0G,"This season is one that will knock your socks off. Couple this season with season 1 and you'll be in for a sluthers treat. Kyra Sedgewick delivers a a proformance that leaves you humbled and comming back for more. It's easy to get wrapped up in her Southern Charm and ""Dixie Darlin"" slap to your ego. I can't wait to see what Season 3 has instore for this Country Girls high profiling life and the bad guys that try to appose her. In her words... ""Thank you so much""
