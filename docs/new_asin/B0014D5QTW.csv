8255268,1,B0014D5QTW,"Worst yoga DVD I've ever tried.  I'm going to stick with Rodney Yee, even his am yoga is better than this.",1273536000,,106,4.0476190476190474
8255269,5,B0014D5QTW,"I wanted a quick workout I could do in my living room when I don't have much time (so there are no excuses!).  I figure 20 minutes of yoga is better than nothing, but it is hard to believe it could really do much good.  I know it does because I definitely felt it the next day and the day after that.  Great arm, back, core, and hip exercise.  She keeps you moving so that you increase calorie burn(even in traditionally static poses she has you move your arms, etc.).  It's great that I can feel like I did something beneficial with just 20 minutes!",1269475200,10,550,4.2
8255270,4,B0014D5QTW,"While I'm not sure that this workout really will help with weight loss since it's rather short and doesn't get your heart rate up very high, it's still a great yoga video.  This is the only video I have with Sara (although I plan on purchasing more of her videos), and I love her pleasant demeanor, cheerful personality, and encouraging comments.  As another reviewer noted, this is a good workout to do if you want to stretch out after doing harder cardio workouts.  It moves at a nice pace, and isn't boring or tedious at all.  I really like it for days when I need a good stretch, but don't have time to do a longer yoga video.",1251590400,3,630,4.313559322033898
8255271,5,B0014D5QTW,This 20-minute yoga session is great!  It works all the major muscles and stretches you out great.  I'm a runner and need a fast but good yoga stretch and this one does it.  It has really helped with my balance and core muscles.  I'd recommend it to anyone.  My husband enjoys it as well!,1244419200,7,288,4.2592592592592595
8255272,3,B0014D5QTW,"I think this is a good place for new yoga lovers to start out.  I have been doing yoga for only a few months but found this tape to be a little too easy.  It claims to get  your heart rate up but as soon as you start to really work out, it is over.  Too bad it isn't broken down into two sections so that once you have the moves, you can watch it without the directions which makes it a slow moving tape.  I found Denise Austin, the FIrm  and other yoga tapes to be better as far as a work out goes.",1208217600,3,499,3.704761904761905
