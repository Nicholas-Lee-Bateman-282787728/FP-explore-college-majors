8657466,5,B00KC1A9QW,"Interesting movie - if you aren't into the Bollywood million songs million dances then probably not the movie for you. Reminded me of the ridiculously creative Wes Anderson without the seriousness that his movies often have. Lot of fun, specially if you have the time.",1420416000,,268,4.977777777777778
