2119867,3,B0002TT08W,"BULGARIAN LOVERS, as a title, is a misnomer. Based on the successful novel by Eduardo Mendicutti and developed into a screenplay by director Eloy de la Iglesia and star actor Fernando Guillen Cuervo, this story is a combination of successful tales from many movies that in this particular film simply doesn't work.

Daniel (Fernando Guillen Cuervo) is a successful, closeted gay architect in Madrid whose only concession to his sexuality is his membership in a group of outrageous queens who stage underground parties, looking for love in all the wrong places. An influx of Eastern European men into Madrid looking for jobs and money to send home includes a group of hunky Bulgarians who offer meaningless sex to the queens in return for money. Daniel attaches himself to one of these handsome but shady characters Kyril (Dritan Biba) and soon is supplying Kyril with a roof over his/their head, money, gifts, and involvement in Kyril's criminal activities all in return for passionate sex.

The story of course is all about what we will do for 'love', and we can see from the beginning that Daniel will cross all barriers - even accompanying Kyril to Bulgaria for his marriage to his girlfriend Kalina (Anita Sinkovic) and the subsequent involvement with Kyril's mob activities. How Daniel extricates himself from Kyril's sexual hold and finds his way back to Madrid forms the caper-like plot that completes the movie.

Though there are some interesting moments - and a lot of flaunting frontal male nudity from a cast worth observing - the film unfortunately falls into too many clich&eacute;s: Daniel's friends are all over-the-top queens, there is the obligatory Kyril/Kalina straight love scene act, Daniel's motivation for his endlessly malinformed behavior goes beyond the quest for 'finding love', the ending is a starting all over again with Kyril's cousin coming on to Daniel...

Cuervo (memorable for his roles in 'Talk to Her' and 'The Greek Labyrinth', etc) does his best with a weak script, but then he DID co-write it. Not a bad film, but one that certainly could have been better with some judicious editing and less lingering over the obvious.",1098576000,14,2160,5.042016806722689

8031764,3,B0002TT08W,"In contrary to other spanish gay theme movies, ""Bulgarian lovers"" will not find its place in my dvdteque. I enjoyed it less than, for example, ""Bear cub"" or hilarious ""Chef's special"" (not to mention some Almodovar's works). And I ain't going watch it again.
It is not a piece of bad cinema, don't get me wrong. I am pretty sure a lot will regard it as a funny and witty movie. But to me the plot seemed noting special, thus my rating is just O.K.",1304035200,,447,4.270588235294118
8031765,5,B0002TT08W,"There are lots of movies about women making bad decisions about ""bad boys"". I found this approach totally believable and totally enjoyable. Based on a popular book, director Eloy de la Iglesia was coaxed out of retirement, creating a fun romp, with romance, intrigue and a validation of life as it may exist. Fernando Guillen Cuervo is a dead ringer for Scott Lowell (Ted, in the US Queer as Folk). He's adorable and completely likeable. The ""rogue"" Bulgarian, Kyril, is also adorable, played by Dritan Biba. These two take the story away, with the usual doubts, as well as political and criminal intrigue, staying fond of each other to the end. What's not to like? It's a somewhat traditional love story, taken to a different level.  If you can get over the excessive full-frontal nudity of Mr. Biba, you may enjoy this film for the sweet story that it is.",1282953600,2,857,4.713333333333333
8031766,5,B0002TT08W,"A film noir in lgbt disguise, this movie puts together the appropriate elements--rueful narrator, love betrayed, clues to the conclusion--in fast-paced and clever manner. I found myself laughing out loud; the film deserves several viewings. Why the opening cigarette lighter? Why details as to nodding one's head for 'no'? Close watching will tell in this tight and taut, elegant Euro-mystery. While the in-jokes may be most available to those who understand Spanish, the naked stud can be enjoyed by all. If you like Hitchcock's classic, Strangers on a Train, this neo-noir will pick you up and leave you laughing, hitting the play button once again.",1209600000,4,651,5.20952380952381
8031767,1,B0002TT08W,"In my opinion this movie is a load of bollocks...for starters it is a historical fact that bulgarians are one of the most if not the most accepting country in respect to other nationalities.  there are more mosques in Sofia today than christian churches and Bulgarians are CHRISTIANS!  Furthermore the nation had a high intake of Koreans (guess which part of Korea) during the Vietnam War....I doubt Bulgaria is a nation of drug thugs and terrorists....in fact the country just got accepted into the UNION.  The zenophobia of the director is tiresome and his cheap tactic at using a somewhat still obscure name for a country ie Bulgaria as a title for his movie is supposed to be what? bait to reel us in cos we never heard of the place????....this movie is nothing more than a cheaply veiled racial slur on a people older than time immemorial!  A people who were the FIRST of the non CHRISTIANS to convert to CHRISTIANITY because they saw it for the practical path to trade and continuity of their blood line that it was...A people who translated the bible for their peole from the exclusive language of Latin to their own language in the 9th century when the ever so renowned English speaking races did not do so until the 13th century!!!!!!!!!!!!....why did the English (and Spanish too )take so long? Well what the people cannot read (because it is in Latin) can be used as the ultimate tool of suppression and coersion so why bother translating it until you really have to right?!!......now, you tell me who is the more liberated, caring, welfare focused, community based and EGALITARIAN - Bulgaria or the rest of the world!!  Why doesn't someone make a movie about SOME OF REALLY INTERESTING THINGS THAT BULGARIA IS FAMOUS FOR !!!",1169337600,5,1736,4.735099337748345
8031768,4,B0002TT08W,"Eloy de la Iglesia returns behind the camera after more than a decade to direct this 2002 flick ""Bulgarian Lovers.""  It is a Spanish production, despite the title, and follows a love triangle with Daniel played by Fernando Guillen Cuervo as a mild mannered attorney who cruises gay bars and picks up the hungry Kyril played by Dritan Biba.  Kyril speaks about his fiancee back in Bulgaria and is easily able to split his gay relationship with Daniel who enables him to survive and acquire legal residency papers to his loyalties to his fiancee.  The picture heats up, as the thugs Kyril hangs out with appear to be either drug dealers or terrorists.  Kyril utilizes Daniel as one of his resources.  Daniel assists in bringing Kyril's fiancee to Spain and then accompanies him back for his marriage in Bulgaria.  While the obvious sensational elements of nudity are there, the film surpasses that by being an interesting character study on the what necessity forces individuals to do and how love and loyalty must sometimes be compromised for the sake of survival.  It is an interesting film, but certainly not for the straightlaced!  Enjoy!",1145232000,3,1140,4.901041666666667
8031769,3,B0002TT08W,"Based on a popular, but not very good, Spanish novel, this film tells the story of a Spanish middle-aged man's relationship with a hunky Bulgarian who's after his money and has a blonde girlfriend/wife.  Unfortunately, the film is not as smart or witty as its makers seem to think it is.  The filmmakers didn't seem to have a clear idea of what they wanted to do: a dark comedy, a sex romp, a witty commentary on Spanish gay male culture, a humorous gay melodrama a la Almodovar.  Instead, you get a little bit of everything and most of it is not done particularly well.

Still, the two leads are attractive in their own ways, the plot, while preposterous and unnecessarily convoluted, is amusing, and there's more male frontal nudity than Americans are used to (although the film is far from being as graphic as the cover suggests and the few sex scenes are quite tame).  And the stereotypes of the queeny middle-aged men and the hunky foreigners, while somewhat crude and even potentially offensive, are actually quite refreshing when compared to the boringly PC American gay movies.",1142467200,12,1085,4.780748663101604
8031770,5,B0002TT08W,"Oh yes!!! belive me, you will love this movie. nice story line, good acting and if you like nudity (and we know you do) you will like this movie",1107993600,7,144,4.0
8031771,4,B0002TT08W,"I found this film totally satisfying and enjoyable.  As a comedy, some will find its tragic themes not truly -- meaning painfully -  dealt with.

A gay, middle aged ""respectable"" and politically well connected Spanish ""consultant"" falls in love with a virile Bulgarian immigrant, and soon falls in with his lover's shady company. The older man seems to wish to escape his trivial emotional life and ""queenie"" friends; crime feels ""real"" to him.  He wants his love of Kyril to overpower all other reality, even if Kyril cannot love him.  He becomes ""completely"" Bulgarian, and goes to Kyril's wedding in Bulgaria, where he rejects seduction by Kyril's handsome younger male cousin.

The actors and the acting are attractive. The story is fast-paced and complicated, and tautly directed.  There is much to look at, and to think about.

I have not been able to convey the film's wonderful comic spirit, as I have focused on its ""deeper"" themes.  Regardless, this is a sweet comedy about true love.",1099180800,27,994,4.9397590361445785
