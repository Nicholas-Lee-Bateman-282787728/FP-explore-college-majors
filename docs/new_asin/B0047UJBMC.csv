4285486,5,B0047UJBMC,"I'm a fan of Alex Gibney's. I own five of his films (this, ""Casino Jack..."", ""Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room"", ""Taxi to the Dark Side"", and ""GONZO..."") and I watch them all more times than I really should. He has an understanding of character and story that few people in Hollywood right now seem to have. I prefer to think of him as a nicer Michael Moore.

I only saw the trailer for this one before I bought the DVD, it didn't play in any theater where I live. I watched it and was totally engrossed by it. What he's really good at is bringing the humanity out of even the most despicable characters, and there are some pretty despicable characters like Roger Stone. He's an unapologetic prick who says he ""believes in the 'Gonzo' brand of politics"". But he still comes across as a fascinating character. So does Eliot Spitzer. The film isn't a defense of his actions, Eliot himself doesn't defend himself and does a pretty bad job of explaining why he did what he did. He does this by avoiding questions directly related to that while being powerfully articulate on other issues such as corporate crime and the financial crisis. He does say, and I have to give him credit for this, that he ""brought himself down"" and he doesn't blame anybody else for it. Gibney makes a convincing argument that other forces might be at play, but it was still Spitzer's choices and combative style that did him in.

The other choice Gibney made, which I found fascinating, was that he decided to take an interesting approach when dealing with Spitzers main woman at the escort agency. I don't mean Ashley Dupree, although he does spend a good amount of time talking about her and how she capitalized on what she did with Spitzer. There was another woman that he got to and the way he decided to do it was pretty original. Not wanting to reveal her face or real name, he cast an actress to ""perform"" her interview and the actress is so good, not to mention one of the most beautiful women I've seen in a long time, that you'd swear she was the real person. She comes across as what she is, beautiful and intelligent.

This film really made me think, and that's what I like best about Gibney's films. I always walk away from them feeling like I learned something. It's a film ulitmatly about choices and responsibility, both personal and political. It also made me think of a line from C.S. Lewis' ""The Screwtape Letters"":

""The truth is that whenever a man lies with a woman, there, whether they like it or not, a transcendental relationship is set up between them which must be eternally enjoyed or eternally endured.""",1306195200,4,2610,4.535031847133758
4285487,5,B0047UJBMC,"You disappointed the people who supported you. I don't think anybody cares about the sex, but you were hypocritical by going after prostitution rings while at the same relying on their services. It must be excruciatingly painful not being able to live up to your own expectations. There is no doubt that you are very smart, and that you have done a world of good before you became a governor. I hope you realize now that you will be measured by how much of a difference you make in the culture around you rather than by handing out fines while history simply keeps repeating itself. Now there is no place to go but do what you are best at and doing it with grace. Keep up the good work.

A very excellent movie by the way.",1302825600,,722,4.3088235294117645
4285488,4,B0047UJBMC,"What troubles me is the insinuation that Spitzer's downfall was not so much the result of his own lapses, but due to some ""vast right wing conspiracy.""  The film does not use that phrase, but the film is a bit of a sympathetic Valentine to Spitzer, portraying him as the victim rather than a hypocrite.  ""Client 9"" focuses not so much on

Spitzer's hypocrisy and sanctimony as the purported sinister forces of business and The Establishment that brought him down.  It compares his sex scandal with those of Bill Clinton and others who went before him.  I have some problems with that comparison, though, problems that I think explains the glee and schadenfreud that greeted the disclosure of Spitzer's contretemps.

The difference I see was that none of those earlier scandals involved a ""perp"" who was nearly as sanctimonious, Bill Clinton has/had genuine and charismatic, interpersonal people skills.  He did not to the same degree leave bodies in his wake in his climb to the top.

Spitzer did.  His pugnacious, combative, grandstanding style drove reform for a while but eventually caught up with him.  If you tell people, ""I will break you ..."" that ""I will steamroll you ..."" and that ""We are at war .."" you can expect little or no quarter when/if the shoe is on the other foot.  You live by the sword; you die  by the sword.  You reap what you sow.  You go bare knuckles at The Establishment in a sanctimonious way, you have to expect no mercy if/when you yourself transgress.

Unlike the filmmakers, it appears that Spitzer himself is not looking to pin the blame on any sinister external forces.  He is unflinching in saying that he brought it on himself and that he is to blame.
Perhaps part of his orchestrated campaign to tiptoe back into public life?  I was amazed by Spitzer's steely resolve to answer questions and to shoulder the responsibility.  No one should be surprised that Wall Street or captains of industry popped the campaign corks when Spitzer's hypocrisy was exposed.

If you were/are a Spitzer fan, you will like the movie.  If you are on the other side of the spectrum, you may be disturbed or have your preconceptions shattered.",1302307200,,2158,4.75
4285489,5,B0047UJBMC,"Roger Stone - the guy who said ""you'll never get anywhere in this town until you learn to fake sincerity"", the guy who took Dan Rather down and got G.W. Bush the destroyer of America elected, appears to be delighted to get so much screen time in this expose to show us gleefully just how sick in the head you have to be to be a Republican operative.  This film gives us a nice view into how and why America let Wall Street and psychopathic politicians destroy it.  Would have been nice to have the opening music video in full on the extras section, it is a nicely done song, in contrast to the lame closing song.",1302307200,3,612,4.222222222222222
4285490,5,B0047UJBMC,"You're an elected official whose call girl activity makes the news.  If you're United States Senator David Vitter, voters in Bible belt Louisiana nonetheless re-elect you.  But if you're Governor Eliot Spitzer of New York - arguably the most progressive state in the country - you resign?  The documentary CLIENT NINE: THE RISE AND FALL OF ELIOT SPITZER explores that and just about everything else you'd want to know about the man, the only unanswered question being why his first name is spelled with just one ""L.""

Never mind judging an individual by the company he or she keeps.  Judge Eliot Spitzer by the enemies he makes.  A number of them are interviewed in CLIENT NINE.  In 1936 President Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke of ""business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering"" forces united in their hatred of his pro-working class agenda and added, ""I welcome their hatred.""  The enemies Eliot Spitzer made as both New York Attorney General and Governor of the Empire State prove no different, individuals whose hatred of you is a badge of honor.  CLIENT NINE implies Eliot Spitzer's curt communication style made him at least partially deserving of the scorn some had for him, but by that logic, the antagonistic likes of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Vice President Dick Cheney should be buried alive.

Follow anyone around long enough - the Pope, Mary Tyler Moore, Justin Bieber - and you will witness something he or she would not want the public to know.  In Eliot Spitzer's case, investment banker Kenneth Langone, once unsuccessfully prosecuted by Spitzer, tips his hand about having Spitzer monitored.  Spitzer only had one date with the call girl to whom the news media linked him, so eager were those behind the fishing expedition to have something, anything, to report.

While I usually don't talk about female looks, with such deliberation contributing to bulimia and anorexia, I have to say I find it interesting that Silda Spitzer, wife of Eliot Spitzer, is the most attractive woman to appear in CLIENT NINE.  But then, think of what Tiger Woods' wife looks like.

4285491,5,B0047UJBMC,"This documentary may be one of the best documentary films I have seen this year. A totally different perspective of Eliot Spitzer emerges. His sexual escapades are second place to the real story.

Eliot Spitzer was a child of privilege. As one of his colleagues said in the documentary, he had good genes and good money. He went to the right schools and met his wife, Silda, at Harvard. As a lawyer,  he worked in the Manhattan's District Attorney's office, and was involved in the investigation which brought down the Gambino family.

In 1998 he became New York State Attorney General. He developed a reputation for going after white collar crime and had an impressive record. He went after stock price inflation, predatory lending practices and fraud at AIG. It was here that he made a huge enemy in Maurice Greenberg, the CEO of AIG. His investigative work brought about the mutual fund scandal of 2003 with the discovery of illegal trading. This led to a run for the Governor's Office, which he won in 2007. He had a reputation for running roughshod over anyone in his way, and this was part of his downfall. He tried to eliminate fraud and kick backs in office and made too many enemies. On March 10, 2008 the prostitution scandal came to light and he resigned on March 17.

There were two big surprises in this film. The first is the girl who was named in the scandal, Ashley Dupr. She has attempted to cash in on her notoriety, but only saw Spitzer once. Another girl, who wishes to remain anonymous, saw him more regularly. She agreed to speak with the documentarians but not be seen or identified. They hired an actress to speak her part. She provided, under duress, all the information to the FBI.

The other surprise was Eliot Spitzer, himself. He is interviewed throughout the film, answering many personal questions including why he was unfaithful. He is not sure why he did something so foolish and reckless. He was forthright when he said ""It seemed like a good idea at the time"". In one article, William Belle says, ""Spitzer was a good man who was doing good things. The unfortunate thing for the rest of us is that now we are deprived of that good man. As Attorney General, Spitzer was already in the face of Wall Street uncovering white collar crime. He was in the thick of it dealing with the run up to the financial crisis; he was aware of the idiocy going on before things fell apart; he was going after those who were playing fast and loose with our money.""

The people in the film, the politicians, the Wall Street denizens, come off looking very bad. This documentary by filmmaker Alex Gibney suggests that Spitzer's demise wasn't just about sex. The enemies Spitzer made on Wall Street and in the New York state capital at Albany may have contributed to his political demise. Gibney unravelled the entire scandal, interviewing many of Spitzer's adversaries. And, as I have previously stated, Spitzer makes no excuses and accepts all responsibility for his downfall. The mess on Wall Street has continued, and we have lost one of the men who was out to get them.

A surprising documentary, filled with good information, historical facts and words from those involved. I came away from this feeling we have all lost a good man. in politics. Good Luck to Eliot Spitzer.

Highly Recommended.  prisrob 02-09-11

4285492,5,B0047UJBMC,"This is a remarkable documentary about the rise and fall of New York Governor Eliot Spitzer; most remarkable in that Spitzer actually agreed to be interviewed on camera for this bio film and did not shy away from the most embarrassing questions. The interviewer is skillful in bringing out both Spitzer's very real professional achievements as a crusading prosecutor and his personal weaknesses.

More interesting to me than his sexual involvements were his extremely combative interactions with Wall St. big shots as prosecutor, or legislative colleagues as governor. The escort agency also said that Spitzer was a difficulty and unfriendly client. Apparently just not very nice in his interactions with people. On the macro level of ethics, he was a hero. On the micro level of everyday interactions, clueless.

For a film that consists largely of talking heads, this is a powerful drama. The prostitute Spitzer came to be associated with - it turns out he saw the woman only once - is seen as not very interesting and only a small part of the story. Spitzer's real downfall was that he made so many enemies. In that atmosphere, the smallest mistake will be punished. A brilliant intellect but little understanding how to relate to people, whether as a prosecutor, a politician, or even as client of an escort service. The film is skillfully done and well worth watching.

PostScript: Spitzer has recently resurfaced as a CNN reporter and interviewer, doing quite a good job. But true to form, his relationship with a cohost dissolved in a personality conflict. Guy never learns.",1296777600,4,1581,5.026717557251908

4285496,2,B0047UJBMC,"Gibney very clearly takes a pro-Spitzer stance.  It is true that Republicans are shown saying negative things about the man; however, his actual crime--not to mention his hypocrisy--is never fully explored. Gibney also opts to show footage of women who worked for the escort service Spitzer solicited saying what a positive experience it has been for them. While these women are free to say what they like---and I don't fault them for it--women who have exited the sex trade, and especially exited high class escort services, consistently talk about the high level of abuse they have endured. Women in the sex trade are the most abused group on the face of the planet; they have as high a level of PTSD as state torture survivors! Yet, not one woman is shown saying anything negative about the paid rape experience. It wouldn't have been hard to find women to speak about the reality of prostitution; instead, Gibney decides not to air such footage. By focusing on women's choices to be escorts, Spitzor's $10,000 month decision to pay for sexual services is obscured. With his choice of footage, Gibney wrongly portrays Spitzer as a victim.

Spitzer may indeed have been a victim of a Republican-led hunt to take him out of office. This information is interesting. However, Spitzer was also leading the movement against human trafficking and prostitution; he even promised to bring the Swedish model, where ""johns"" are criminalized and the prostituted are decriminalized, to New York. That he was pretending to lead the movement against human trafficking is never explored. Instead, men are shown stating they don't see anything wrong with what Spitzer did; after all, in France he could win as a sex predator!

Gibney needs to be held responsible for not showing the full story behind the Spitzer ""scandal.""  That Spitzer was never prosecuted and thus held fully accountable for his crimes is never even mentioned. If Spitzer was such a victim, would he really have his own tv show(run by Al Gore) show or have a regular column in Salon? Shame on Gibney for creating a celebration of Spitzer rather than showing the full story in all its ugliness.",1373587200,2,2149,4.928176795580111

4285499,4,B0047UJBMC,"A good man caught in a web.

Spitzer was a hard driving s.o.b. He took on the investment bankers and stock brokering thieves and made enemies. He fought the good fight and made a lot of progress.
The problem with Eliot Spitzer was that he was a human being. He was an ambitious, hard headed driven man who also had an interest in women.

This film is sympathetic to him. It tries to show him in a favorable light. I guess that is why Spitzer appears in several interviews.

The testaments from the various women/escorts portray Spitzer as a reluctant client. He showed up once wearing a bit of a disguise. Sure he was there, he did it but without the arrogant bravado of a drug addled womanizer etc.

The film is more a story of what can happen to someone who makes enemies in high places. The men behind the curtains who run high finance can let loose the FBI and media on you. The media is always looking for the next scandal and the police depts can tap your phone line etc.

Most telling is that the cast of characters in this drama were all tainted. No one escapes dirt, indictment or accusation. His political rivals in Albany and the bankers CEO's were all eventually indicted or fired or publicly ruined.

My favorite part is the ending clip where media pimp Geraldo Rivera asks the former escort who thinks she can be a singer to leave us with X-mas song. Wow, not even Geraldo can resist feeding at the trough of public scandal and pseudo indignation.

This documentary is not about Elliot if you pay attention to the details. This documentary shows when it comes to politics the system works collectively. It is not important how rich, smart, powerful or whatever you think you are or which party you belong to since if you do not benefit all collectively (of course the ones on top), you are doomed. His biggest enemies where not Republicans and infact his own party, Democrats brought him down. Clinton got elected for what he did but yet this guy was prosecuted when no client is prosecuted for the crime he committed. No wonder nothing gets done in politics except what is best for the ones on top collectively while all others keep hallucinating that they belong to a party which does not benefit them at all since they are blinded by a faith instead of truth. This documentary is a reality of life if you only pay attention to the acts of the players not to their religion or party of faith.

4285503,5,B0047UJBMC,"What an exceptional documentary that needed to be made!  This would not have been nearly as compelling had not Spitzer agreed to an extended interview answering virtually all the questions.  The documentary does a great job of returning to Spitzer's early success with bringing down Wall Street analysts, AIG and also Dick Grasso of the NYSE.  Unfortunately, he had made many enemies with his abrasive take no prisoner's mentality.  Most people can survive this but don't have a skeleton in your closest which unfortunately Spitzer did.  Particularly when you've made an enemy of Kenneth Langone in the NYSE/charitable pay scandal.

But this documentary covers it all including great detail of his movement to governor and fighting not only with the Republicans (his number one adversary is also interviewed giving great insight) as well as Democrats.  I would say approximately half the documentary is about his sex scandal and the other half about is his overall controversial career.  Both halves are entirely entertaining.

I must admit there was one added area of entertainment, Roger Stone,  a self-avowed dirty tricks politician with a Richard Nixon tattoo on his back and a disclosure of he and his second wife being involved in wife swapping, not your typical consultant for the Religious Right.

Many of the reviewers touch on whether this was a politically motivated charge and clearly there seems to be some evidence of this.  But Spitzer clearly states he deserved to take the fall.  I can't recommend this documentary higher!",1307232000,,1539,5.157258064516129

This documentary was directed by Alex Gibney and worked together with Eliot Spitzer,the former Governor of New York who was involved in sex scandals that involved high class prostitutes working in escort firms. It tries to focus on his political career as well as the sex scandals that Spitzer got involved in. The interviews conducted in it involves the political friends and opponents of Spitzer as well as the people working in the escort services. Interestingly,the interview made on Angela Dupre,who happens to be Spitzer's regular client was portrayed by an actress.

Apparently,it was both thought-provoking and informative as we get to realize how great Spitzer could have been politically as he was definitely great in acting as a ""police"" of Wall Street. Despite of his temper,he could have had a great future ahead as he could have been a possibly the ""first Jewish President"" of the United States. Both his friends and foes attested to his capabilities. Too bad that his inability to resist women led to a sex scandal and unfortunately the so-called ""poster boy"" for politicians involved in it despite having more popular ones involved such as the likes of Bill Clinton,John Edwards and even Newt Gingrich. It was also interesting to see how the so-called beautiful women work as escorts despite the fact that they are probably the ones who are less likely to be due to the fact that they are going to have the talent to succeed in the real world. One would definitely be bothered how much the United States has ingrained the attitude of materialism in its culture.

8418339,4,B0047UJBMC,"""Client-9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer"" (2010 release; 117 min.) looks back at the meteoric rise, and even faster fall, of the disgraced former Governor of New York. As the documentary opens, after a short introductory montage, we are taken back to how Spitzer became the Attorney-General of New York, taking on white criminals on Wall Street where ""the SEC should've done something, but they didn't. So I did"". As it turns out, he rubbed some very powerful men with long, very long, memories the wrong way. Upon becoming Governor of New York, somehow word started to spread about a ""well-known New York politician"" using an escort service. To tell you more would be pointless. You'll want to see this play out for yourself.

Couple of comments: First, this documentary is written and directed by Alex Gibney, he of other excellent documentaries such as ""Enron: The Smartest Guys In the Room"", ""Taxi To the Dark Side"", and just last year with ""The Armstrong Lie"", so right off the bat, you know that chances are you're going to get a very good documentary. And it is very good. I will admit that I was wondering after half an hour how Gibney was going to be able to fill another 90 min. But then a funny thing happens: the story devotes a lot of attention to Spitzer's political battles in Albany, where he had a much harder time pushing through his will (because he needed the legislative chambers, both controlled by the Republicans, to actually pass laws (the documentary makes clear that even many Democrats in the legislature were no big fan of Spitzer). Second, much to my surprise, Spitzer is interviewed extensively for the documentary, so one could argue that this was made with the cooperation and consent from Spitzer (much in the same way Armstrong was interviewed extensively for ""The Armstrong Lie""). Yet what we do not get is a clear explanation as to why Spitzer did what he did, knowing full well that when you start using an escort service, it's only a matter of time that word is going to get around. Third, I did not like the (unspoken) understone towards the end of the documentary, that it was basically the Republicans' fault for ""going after Spitzer"". Yes, I'm sure they did, but don't blame the Republicans for what Spitzer did! As someone comments in the documentary: ""all he had to do was not to do it!"", very true. In the end, someone comments that ""the reservoir of good will was empty"" and Spitzer had no-one in his corner.

""Client-9"" is a fascinating documentary and I'm glad I finally picked it up the other day. The parallels between this and ""The Armstrong Lie"" are many, incidentally. IF you liked C""ient-9"", by all means I encourage you to check out ""The Armtrong Lie"", for which you don't need to be a cycling enthusiast in order to enjoy it, just like you don't need to be a political animal in order to enjoy ""Client-9"" for the riveting documentary that it is. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1402790400,,2927,4.681553398058252
