8330212,1,B001OBBS0U,"First off, I agree that the lead actress was attrictive...Big tits and a gorgeous face and body which was often displayed in full frontal nudity....But after that I cannot understand the fuss.  The movie is  definitely ""R"" by our standards today.(e.g. see the recent Sessions with Helen Hunt).and from a sexual action perspective there was no (simlulated even) oral (MF FM  or FF).  The simulatd sex scenes were this side of silly and the plot....if I may use that term for this feature was disjointed in the extreme.  Give me Japanese soft porn any day of the week, and of course any number of much ""harder""  European features from the 70s through present.  Sorry, but for me this was a definite thumbs dowan and a waste of $15.",1356134400,3,729,4.6484375
8330213,2,B001OBBS0U,"well its me again the celebrity nude hound and big breast fan. this move was just boring all the way around even the nude shots of Christina where not very appealling to me. she had a lot of nude shots in the film but not very sexy to me. and the story line I just didn't get it at all which makes this film a no buy in my opinion. I found the move maid in sweeden to be much more entertaining as far as seeing her naked and a little bit more interesting story line. now the one thing I can say about Lindberg is that she has a great body and dosnt mind showing at all. but for the money I would skip this film and buy either maid in sweeden, Anita: Diary of a Nymphomaniac or  Sex & Fury. but if you just want to c her naked you have a lot of films to get including this one which like I said shes seen here a lot. hope this helps.",1341100800,2,832,3.781609195402299
8330214,3,B001OBBS0U,"This thing was ok, but for me, hard to follow. It sort of seemed a bit disjointed. Dispite what it says on the cover, Christina was NOT back after Thriller as this Movie was made before Thriller. This would probably be better suited as a rental, as you will probably only want to see it once.",1299283200,9,292,4.232142857142857
8330215,4,B001OBBS0U,"This is much more than a sleazy exploitation flick.  Seriously.

Exposed does have plenty of candid bedroom scenes and revealing shots of the super-sexy Christina Lindberg(THRILLER:A CRUEL PICTURE).  But Director Gustav Wiklund also wanted to prove he could make a high quality, layered and profound psychological film, and he totally succeeds.

Lena(Lindberg)is a young teen with plenty of bodacious curves to accompany her scorching libido.  She seeks sexual satisfaction between her meek boyfriend and another acquaintance, a crazy partygoer.  Her exploits reach new heights when some nude photographs emerge.  These photos expose her to blackmail and sadomasochistic encounters.

This all sounds pretty simple.  Twisted, but straight-forward.  But there's really much more going on here than meets the eye.  As viewers we're forced to decipher between reality and illusions, between fantasies and factual events.  Some people might dismiss much of this as poor, incoherent storytelling, but that is simply not fair.  Wiklund refuses to spell it out for you, and the result is an intriguing and challenging piece of cinema.

Not to mention pretty freakin' arousing.",1237852800,43,1168,5.6
