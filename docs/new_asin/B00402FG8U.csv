4237638,4,B00402FG8U,"We lost our video of Rock-A-Doodle and needed to replace it -- was so relieved to find this (great price, too!)  However, it was a bit frustrating when we put it in to play.  My grandson sat patiently through Pebble & The Penguin, thinking that Rock-A-Doodle would play after it -- it didn't!  He was so disappointed.  We took out the DVD to look at it and after finding a magnifying glass, we were able to read the title on the reverse side of the DVD, and sure enough, we played the other side and there was Rock-A-Doodle.  I never knew a CD or DVD to have content on both sides (although when you think about it, it makes sense especially with 2-disc sets, etc!) All was wonderful after that.",1314748800,,695,4.315384615384615

4237644,5,B00402FG8U,"This release has only one DVD inside of the case. However, one one side is rock a doodle, and the other is Pebble and penguin. If you are a fan of both or only one of these movies you'll feel it's worth the price (cheap) for these films. The quality is like any other dvd (good). The movies, to the best of my knowledge, are uncut...same films that were released in theaters, vhs, and now dvd. There are no special behind the scenes features that are worth mentioning.

Rock a doodle is about a rooster named ""Chanticleer"" who raises the sun with his singing. One day the farm he lived in rejects him, and he starts a singing career in ""Pinky Wood"". A boy, who is turned into a cat, goes on a wild adventure looking for dear Chanticlee. It's a good movie, though adults will spot story imperfections.  I loved this silly movie when I was a kid, and still get a kick out of it today. The songs are awesome, some of the characters are really likable, and for a few bucks it's worth buying. The only thing I never cared for was how they made Chanticleer into an Elvis spoof later in the film. I suppose the director thoat this was a cool concept.

The pebble and the penguin has never been one of my favorite movies, but I had re-watched it on this dvd. It's about a male penguin who goes on a weird adventure to bring a meteor (the pebble) to the girl he loves. Of course the buff jock penguin wants the girl all to himself,and that is the closest you'll get to any thing resembling a story plot with this film.",1295222400,3,1509,4.232638888888889

4237657,5,B00402FG8U,"This is an EXCELLENT movie for anyone wanting to laugh, shed a few tears, and end up smiling by the end credits.

This particular rendition of The Pebble and the Penguin (packaged with Rock-A-Doodle) is taken directly off of the original release of the movie to theatres.  The original distributor of this movie demanded Don Bluth and Gary Goldman to send the film to be recolored - mistakes caused by the company that performed the recoloring work show up in the original film and on this version of the DVD. (The distributer also went on to alter the original movie by deleting several scenes - none of which survive today - before it even headed to the Big Screen).  These are NOT the faults of the directors.  Subsequent DVD releases (Family Fun Edition and later) contain a version of the movie with the animation errors corrected with oversight by (thank goodness) Gary Goldman himself, and not some other entity.

The Pebble and the Penguin is one of the most brilliantly-written animated features available with perfectly-crafted endearing characters instilling human subtleties into actual physiologic traits from the Adlie penguin.  The story line is simple yet moving, containing many positive underlying messages and values applicable to all that watch.  This is NOT your average Avatar-style animation product (Apples and Oranges, now... don't unfairly compare it to computer animated films). It is a painstakingly hand-drawn, hand-painted work of art that takes years to do (I have several of the original production celluloid drawings and paintings from The Pebble and the Penguin gracing my walls at home).  The music is outstanding, and it is sad none of the tracks ever received airplay in 1995-6.  Certainly the song ""Now And Forever"" is every bit as good as ""Beauty and the Beast"".

This is a Must-See film with the mindset that you are watching 15 actual hand-drawn and hand-colored paintings per second whiz by your eyes.  Grab someome you love, or your children, and a box of popcorn.  You'll enjoy The Pebble and the Penguin over and over for years to come.

Rock-A-Doodle is an enjoyable classic on the flipside as a bonus - another nicely-done Don Bluth work of art.",1381708800,,2192,4.972602739726027

Aside from that I loved it, great children's movie and a great treat for those young at heart. Thank you for having these movies in stock. :)",1350000000,,511,4.333333333333333
4237677,4,B00402FG8U,"After I heard about this movie I just had to see it because it was about a chicken, and I LOVE Chicken, So after I watched this movie, I thought it was just okay. The story, animation, and the charcter of Chanticleer and his songs were all just fine. The rest were either just okay or just plain bad. For starters, the rest of the characters weren't all that intersting, there really wasn't much to them, they have that just to be there feel to them. The songs from Chanticleer like I said were just fine. The rest songs mostly coming from The Grand Duke of Owls were either okay or just plain pointless. The character of Edmund, while not terrible, he can be pretty annoying. So overall, Rock a Doodle is just okay, if you really want to see it, then this dvd is really worth getting.
  So lets look at The Pebble and the Penguin, Now unlike Rock a Doodle, this film has a lot more postives and very little negatives. The animation is mostly nice, the voice acting, the characters, the story, and the songs are great. The true negative is that animation while mostly fine has some moments that look unfinshed, like at times, the animation looks incomplte in some scenes, and in the ""Good Ship Misery"" song, there are moments when the charcters are frozen while the song is going. But overall this film is great. So if your just wanting to get this for Rock a Doodle, this is the best deal, and The Pebble and the Penguin is a nice bonus.",1348099200,,1438,4.361940298507463
4237678,5,B00402FG8U,"Somehow I remembered the cartoon Rock A Doodle from my childhood times, and had the urge to reminisce by watching again. I looked through old VHS's and couldn't find it!

I went online and searched, and it's a very expensive movie, I'm assuming b/c of its rarity over a decade later.

This two-pack is a great option if you want to watch an old favorite. It's a two-sided disc, and the quality of the picture is as you would expect of a cartoon that's so old. But not bad at all.

4237682,1,B00402FG8U,The product came as described but I was very disappointed with the shipping. I paid an extra almost $6 for the faster shipping. It cam on almost the last day and was shipped in a flimsy plastic envelope that was so torn and ripped that it had damaged the DVD itself. When I wrote to movie mars about it they offered to let me return it and they would cover only up to $4 for return shipping! I got this for rockadoodle so since the other side movie skips I figured I'd just keep it. Probably won't buy movies from this company again. Should've listened to other posts that complained about shipping.,1325376000,3,599,4.357142857142857
4237683,5,B00402FG8U,"The movie that we wanted to replace was rock-a-doodle.  A story about a rooster who leaves the farm and is kept away by some very interfering owls.  Then it is up to Edmund a little boy (who was turned into a kitty by the grand duke the leader of the owls) and all of the roosters friends back on the farm to find him and bring him home.  There's a lot more to the story that I'm leaving out but I don't want to spoil it.  It's a great family movie for kids 10 and under, or if you watched this as a kid like I did.

8411656,2,B00402FG8U,"I got this set because it was cheaper than buying Rock a Doodle by itself. Be advised: Rock a Doodle is the B-side of the DVD and the labeling is only on the front side. I generally dislike double sided discs as it is, but it's especially annoying when the content I'm interested in has to be exposed to possible damage in order to identify it. This rating is for the set, I would give the movie itself 5 stars. Well, penguin I'd give 2.",1453420800,,437,4.152941176470589
