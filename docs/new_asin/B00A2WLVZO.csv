5379580,4,B00A2WLVZO,I thought the documentary was very informative and to the point.  I would recommend this documentary to anyone looking to relocate to any part of the world as this documentary gives you the pros and cons of various around the globe.,1363910400,2,232,4.658536585365853
5379581,5,B00A2WLVZO,"Be prepared for facts you never thought of if you ever need to get out of  dodge or want to a family safety get away plan. The film is built around the large lengthy book of the same name. I don't have time for the book and I got lots of really good information in a relatively short time with the DVD. I would strongly recommend this to be seen before you buy a place to ""escape"" to as part of a safety plan. This is a fact based DVD not a vacation film...it is serious information to help you make intelligent decisions.",1361664000,13,522,4.067961165048544
5379582,5,B00A2WLVZO,"This is a great book with a lot of information.  Very informative and worth reading.  This is a ton of info in here about every area including economic info, tax info, landscape info, population, really very detailed about each state.",1359590400,,234,4.825
5379583,5,B00A2WLVZO,"Skousen is a bit paranoid but otherwise he does a great job in this film.  I think the fears he expresses are overstated, but genuine.  But he definitely knows his stuff.  The one drawback is that he doesn't actually get into too much detail about what you have to do once you select your location.",1359504000,3,298,4.381818181818182
5379584,5,B00A2WLVZO,In our consideration of relocation areas we have struggled with U.S. or Not and where within if we are staying in the U.S.  This DVD and the book are the most helpful resource we have found in making that decision.  We have now decided and are grateful to the author for his experience and diligent study of the subject.  It has been the single most critical resource in making our decision.  I highly recommend it to all who are staying put or are considering moving to a different area for critical information about your area or the area where you would like to move.  5 Stars from us!!,1358208000,27,589,4.416666666666667
5379585,5,B00A2WLVZO,A must see film to keep informed in this unchartered world we live in. I want to hear more from this author.,1357084800,,108,3.9545454545454546
5379586,5,B00A2WLVZO,Really informative movie. Helps you think about what you need to be doing to prepare for the dark days ahead.,1356739200,12,109,4.5
5379587,5,B00A2WLVZO,"My order arrived very quickly, and as always Alex Jones included some stickers and a citizens pocket reference (your rights and duties as a citizen of this country). Packaging was very good and the item was now as advertised. The DVD is very well put together, and should be viewed by anyone serious about the safety of their family. I would purchase from the Infowars store again!",1353628800,23,381,4.701492537313433
5379588,5,B00A2WLVZO,"a good, in depth interview.",1459728000,,27,4.6
5379589,5,B00A2WLVZO,"Great information! I went ahead and purchased the book, hardcover, from Infowars.com while they have free shipping on all orders. (Until December 18th, 2015)",1449187200,,157,5.583333333333333
5379590,5,B00A2WLVZO,I really enjoyed this book!,1448150400,,27,4.6
5379591,1,B00A2WLVZO,Waste of money and time! I won't buy the book because this DVD made me feel used and why would I go back for more?! The best part about this purchase is I can reuse the case to protect something of worth!,1447027200,3,204,3.880952380952381
5379592,5,B00A2WLVZO,"Well presented documentary on relocation for specific reasons.  Watch the video, and then read the book!",1443657600,,104,5.5
5379593,3,B00A2WLVZO,Buying the book might have been better.,1439424000,,39,4.714285714285714
5379594,3,B00A2WLVZO,"Just a preview, in order to get your interest high enough to buy the book.",1438732800,,74,4.0
5379595,3,B00A2WLVZO,"I saw as much on YOUTUBE, I was hoping this would have more information that I saw on Alex Jones  documentary.",1430784000,2,110,4.238095238095238
5379596,1,B00A2WLVZO,Don't waste your time! Purchase the 3 rd edition book,1427587200,5,53,4.4
5379597,5,B00A2WLVZO,It puts a lot of this country in perspective!,1424304000,,45,4.111111111111111
5379598,1,B00A2WLVZO,This was nothing more than Alex Jones getting in on the action. If you want the book then get it. The DVD however is just like an AJ info war video on YT and YT is free. I thought this would be something good the family could sit and watch together but the wife hated it as soon as AJ started talking. I will not be buying the book after this cause I feel taken. This video did not tell anyone anything they should not already know had they been thinking about the topic for more than 5 minutes. What a rip off.,1424131200,3,511,3.970873786407767
5379599,4,B00A2WLVZO,"While this is a great starter film, it doesn't go into the detail you need.  Of course you have to purchase the book, which is fantastic.  Skousen has done a lot of research in the book and I recommend it to anyone who would like additional information on where to move, based on freedom, laws, politics, etc.  The film basically just prompts you to purchase the book.",1422057600,3,368,4.462686567164179
5379600,5,B00A2WLVZO,Great,1415577600,,5,5.0
5379601,5,B00A2WLVZO,"Excellent source of solid, useful information for anyone planning a move,  wanting to plan an emergency exit strategy, or just learn about where they live.  As a result of this film we also purchased the book by Mr. Skousen. Did you know that So CA/LA area has only one highway out of town heading east? New Jersey has the same problem. Did you know the average person can only walk about 5 +/- miles?",1415232000,2,401,4.405405405405405
5379602,5,B00A2WLVZO,Fascinating at the least,1405468800,,24,5.25
5379603,1,B00A2WLVZO,"I thought this documentary would have some advice on relocating to safe areas of the country.  Instead, it's two guys ranting about paranoid conspiracy theories with zero factual evidence to back up their claims.  I guess shoveling lies and wrapping it in patriotism sells books and airtime though?

I'm a Republican, a Constitutionalist, a soldier and a gun owner but these guys are complete whack jobs.

Don't waste your time or money.",1396656000,22,437,5.027777777777778
5379604,1,B00A2WLVZO,This DVD spends the first hour talking about global conspiracies and the second hour as a sales pitch for the book. Worthless. Not a documentary. Little true information.,1396396800,15,170,5.107142857142857
5379605,5,B00A2WLVZO,"Wow...really scary stuff! Great Gift.  As pictured and described.  Very, Very pleased with item.  Thank you!  Love Amazon.com would recommend to friends for sure!",1396224000,,162,5.625
5379606,5,B00A2WLVZO,"Those of us who bought this book and are preparing for the inevitable, can use it as a reference.
Those who bought this book because they had to move for their job will be disappointed.
That said, everyone should buy this book.
Then again, maybe not.",1395446400,,250,4.456521739130435
5379607,3,B00A2WLVZO,"The video is to general for a person who knows what part of the country they want to be in.  Since most of us can't go off across the country, this doesn't give much help.",1395360000,2,171,3.8857142857142857
5379608,2,B00A2WLVZO,"About half of this video is an interview with host alex jones.  I love alex, but there's nothing in the first half that you don't hear every day on the show.  As far as the actual presentation, this video is just a listing of what you'll learn and not really a compliment or companion to the book.  If you look, you can find this video for free in different places and since it's just an interview and overview, I don't feel to bad about watching it for free.",1395100800,7,459,4.193181818181818
5379609,4,B00A2WLVZO,This is a scary film considering what it implies. It has some very good information that should not be ignored.,1394668800,,111,4.6
5379610,3,B00A2WLVZO,"great and full of info but buy time I got to part where I live that was it . Had no use for it after that . when the stuff hits the fan a survival skills book would be better. its not like you going to have millions of dollars to go to all the safe places the book talks about. If you do then this book will help you find a place . After that when the nuke goes off or any other big thing happens. are you going to walk around with a compass saying where walking this way the book says its safe. when every one is acting like animals. Not saying its a bad book but if you worry about nuke going off learn nuclear survival skills or skills on water food and so forth. And it don't take much no how that if things fell apart and you live by a mountain go to the mountain. If in a city get out or go to the sewers better then nothing. in closeing if you got millions to spend on moveing and putting a bunker in the ground when you get there to hide in then this book is for you. Me on the other hand will stick to learning books on  food ,water, shelter , hunting ,traping, wilderness meds, Nuke survival skills and so on. AND one more thing a good map of USA in a water proof bag and compass will serve you just as good as this book. Thats if a compass still works when it hits the fan.",1394409600,3,1284,3.827067669172932
5379611,3,B00A2WLVZO,"It's ok if you can get for a good price, it was really just an episode of info wars with Alex Jones. He interviews the author on the info wars set. It was ok but not worth $20. There is some good info in the video though. Worth watching but pass on buying it.",1389916800,18,259,3.814814814814815
5379612,4,B00A2WLVZO,"Contained a lot of thought provoking information.
I got an extra copy to share with family.
The film stimulated me to also purchase the book.",1380672000,7,141,4.68
5379613,5,B00A2WLVZO,Very well done and researched documentary.  Tried to get the book from the library but the government refused to carry this book.  So glad I watched the dvd.,1377388800,,157,4.571428571428571
5379614,2,B00A2WLVZO,"This video is basically an infomercial for buying the book... I cannot tell you how much I wish I had just bought the book and not wasted the money on this video...

I can understand if there is a little bit of talk about why certain people think relocation is necessary... But I didn't buy this dvd to listen to a bunch of conspiracy theories.... If you want to listen to that, Alex Jones has plenty of dvds to listen to...

I bought this this to listen to good places to relocate, not listen to Alex Jones' typical radio program crap about all his conspiracy theories...

If you don't know how much of a drama queen Alex Jones is - Just look up his audio that he transmitted on Y2K...

After listening to Skousen and Jones blabber on and on about their conspiracy theories  I finally had to fast forward the dvd even more to actually get some talk about STRATEGIC RELOCATION..... There is some good info but Joel mostly just talks about the information that you can get if you buy the book...

I really wish I bought the book, not this dvd....",1376352000,29,1045,4.360824742268041
5379615,1,B00A2WLVZO,very disappointed but partiality my fault I thought it was a reference book that I could use to compare different locations when I reviewed my order I saw that it was a cd which means I would have to sit thru 50 plus states that I have no interest in and scan thru the cd to try to get the info I wanted as it was partly my fault I am not going to return it. I f you bought this cd as  a reference you will make the same mistake I did.,1372896000,7,435,3.6774193548387095
5379616,3,B00A2WLVZO,"Expected more. Nevertheless, good as a complement to the book; the book (anything by Joel Skousen) is a must have! It would be interesting to have a series of videos done based on the book with more practical advice and some on-site walk-through properties, homes, etc., with maps explained in greater detail...",1371945600,5,311,5.0

8546347,2,B00A2WLVZO,Buy the book instead; the film is just the author and another guy basically having a conversation about the book. The book is excellent.,1505088000,2,136,4.708333333333333
8546348,5,B00A2WLVZO,"This is a very worthy overview and preview to the book, but very worth watching. I ended up getting the book, too, after watching the video. The book is an invaluable resource. Amazing info. I was surprised. I am sure the book needs to be updated regularly but super great and extensive info on different areas in the US as well as the world. I share the book with so many people.",1496534400,,380,4.291666666666667
8546349,5,B00A2WLVZO,"You will enjoy this very interesting film. Joel Skousen and Alex Jones explain your options, should you be faced with a catastrophic event that wrecks your universe.

Watch it and learn how to prepare for difficult times.",1478649600,,380,5.0476190476190474
