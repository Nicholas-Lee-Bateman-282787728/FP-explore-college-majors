YES is not your stereotypical movie.  What an understatement!  It is written in iambic pentameter (a style of poetry) and is, I suppose, a film that will most appeal to those of us who are intellectuals and literate...however...I STILL liked it!  I can see how it would appear boring to many people, because it is deep and intense and it drags when you can't hear the dialogue (because of low volume) or when it is so heavily accented (by the dialects of many different cultures) that you can't figure out what is going on.  Nevertheless, it is still a wonderous and marvelous film.

YES is ostensibly the story of a romance between an unsatisfied married Western woman and an Islamic lover.  However, it touches on many existential issues beyond romance in the dialogue that is really poetry, but spoken as naturally as possible (NOTE: there are no subtitles...subtitles would have changed this movie from one that is good to one that is great).  How hard is it to read poetry and make it sound natural?  Really hard...but the actors did their job.  I am going to buy this movie and watch it again and again, as it is such a deep movie with such intense acting and themes that it warrants more than one viewing. And I'm hoping that with multiple viewings I'll picked up what I missed even without subtitles.

The acting is incredible and irresistable.  The film features a multi-cultural cast and characters...and is so unusual that it is  hard to put into words.  If you like deep and meaningful movies and don't need a lot of action, but enjoy mulling over existential ideas instead, you will love YES.  Probably film critics will love YES.  I loved YES.  However, if you are a fan of run-of-the-mill American movies, this probably is one to pass on. There isn't a lot of action or entertainment and it is the opposite of shallow; however, it makes you think and feel and reflect about life, love, wars, conflict, relationships, and more.

I would recommend YES for those people who read instead of watch movies, and/or who think deeply about life and relish the idea of a movie that explores the most important issues of our day.

Every now and then I bump into something astoundingly refreshing and exceptionally thoughtful that renders speechlessness within me.  Yes simply enters the screen visually and auditory, in a way, that sweeps the audience off their feet into a brilliant cinematic experience.  On occasion, it feels a little like the free spirited filmmaking of the French New Wave and Jean-Luc Godard's innovative film such as A Woman is a Woman (1961) and Masculin, Fminin (1966), and Tout va Bien (1972).  Yet, the director Sally Potter remains true to her own vision, as her visual feast is like nothing done before.  It is a sensible juxtaposition of past revolutionary cinema and succulently invigorating filmmaking of Potter that enters a contemporary society with all of its issues and dilemmas.

Artistically, Potter presses present-day issues through an exceedingly antagonistic venture where the characters converge in daily drama and verse that in its length matches Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.  Amidst the poetic dialogues, the character's personas take shape through thoughts and actions while the words flow effortlessly like running water over a smooth rock.  Through clever cinematography and symbolic framing of the characters in the chosen environment Potter's presents strong notion that the crisis does not emerge through their conversations, but their actions, history, values, morals, and beliefs.  It is the moment when an action clashes with another individual's acquired cognitive disposition where a conflict arises despite moments of harmonious unity.

The sound of a vacuum cleaner ignites the story, as the gray floating screen eventually displays microscopic dust mites and particles swerving in a chaotic manner to aerial pull until it is turned off.  Symbolically, the opening suggests the notion of Newton's Laws of motion (inertia, dynamics, and reciprocal actions), which Potter is about to apply to human beings in their way of interacting in the story.  The bigger question is who pushed the on and off button on the vacuum cleaner, as it is never displayed on the screen.  This might reveal a philosophically spiritual question, as it hints towards the idea of divine intervention.  Nonetheless, the audience will assume it is the cleaner (Shirley Henderson) who delivers an analogously existential debate through her cleaning, which she refers to as an illusion.  This is a mere three minutes into the film, but Potter has successfully indicated her intentional direction with the story.  It will deal with people and their interactions while their experiences and knowledge will help color their existence.

The main character, the scientist She (Joan Allen) is married to the politician Anthony (Sam Neill) that together offer a symbolic idea of who is in control of the power.  The relationship is strained to the ultimate point; as Anthony has cheated on her while he squelches her objections with complete emotional control.  In retrospect, there is more than this in the scene; She knows, but Anthony controls.  A thought of this should be considered in regards to the nations and who govern the people.  Yet, when She thinks there is no hope, He (Simon Abkarian) appears like a subtle breeze on a late summer eve with tender words she has not heard in many years.

She and He enter a passionate love affair, as she does not receive the love that a living organism desires and he has no one to embrace in his lonely arms.  Through She and He, whose names might be a spiritual reference to the beginning of mankind, the audience gets to explore the collision of opposite issues - rich and poor, man and woman, togetherness and loneliness, knowledge and ignorance, youth and elderly, nurture and nature, love and hate, care and neglect, servant and ruler, and death and life.  It is within these overlapping moments where Potter strings up an intriguing love story across borders, as She is an Irish Catholic while He is an Arabic Muslim that together face the social inertia of prejudice and narrow-mindedness.

Yes presents a heavy viewing that requires, maybe more than one screening, as it provides strong social contrasting through the characters in the film.  The camerawork shows signs of perfection, as it does not intend to be perfect in the way it points out the human imperfections.  The use of surveillance cameras and other visually technical approaches enhances the cinematic moment together with the stunning mise-en-scene.  For example, the supper scene between She and Anthony brings to mind the meeting between two adversaries that cannot settle on peace.  The color tones also accentuate the mood of the scene whether it is passionate, or detached.  Potter has truly committed herself to cross borders into a place where everyone will find something offensive.  However, it is her intention, as she desires the audience to experience the same journey that He and She do, as they seek happiness and unity.

In the end, Potter shows the audience that film is not simply a sequence of lines memorized by actors set in a probable environment, but an artistic journey that possess myriads of possibilities.  It is within these possibilities where the audience will uncover a true contemporary gem that will leave the audience dumbfounded, as contemplation seizes its grip over the viewer.",1131753600,3,5352,5.17169373549884
2403012,4,B000B6CO5C,"YES is film you want to love and most people who watch it probably know they are in for a Sally Potter ride, so little quirks like an iambic pentameter script shouldn't shock. There are so many gorgeous moments in this lushly painted canvas, so many isolated portions of dialog that are thought-provoking or just simply beautiful English poetry, so many scenes that are in the capable hands of Joan Allen and Simon Abkarian that are among the finest depictions of understated passion - that it is a shame the overall effect of the montages is not wholly successful. And I think the lack of cohesion must be returned to the capable but distracted hands of Potter's script and direction.

Joan Allen (who simply grows more beautiful and talented with every edgy Indie she takes on) is a biogeneticist, a woman whose loveless marriage to cold politician Sam Neill is tolerable only because of her infatuation with her work. At a (here is one of the choice visual pearls of perfection) formal dinner she notices and is noticed by a handsome Lebanese cook (Simon Abkarian) and her heart ignites. The two talk, meet again, and respond viscerally to each other in a degree of passion and need new to both. This union opens the platform for words concerning Catholicism/Western philosophy versus Islam/Eastern loathing for the imperialism of the Western world (read USA): it is the Muslim philosophy/secular West conflict that resounds so clearly in today's world. Other concepts bathed in iambic pentameter include marriage, fidelity, motherhood, racism, immigration, bickering among the kitchen staff where the cook works - all worthy topics. As the two glide along the plane of a sexual relationship the man reveals he is a surgeon/scientist who left his country because of philosophical reasons and yet defends his Muslim stance and homeland to the isolated woman who is unable to 'hear' his crumbled life. The woman has interchanges with her goddaughter (Stephanie Leonidas), her dying communist aunt (who in voice over technique relates some of the loveliest lines in the script) and with her husband who cannot find his center. The manner in which this all comes to an end is best left for the viewer to discover.

The problems with Potter's jewel-like film are many: much of the dialog (some of which is simply terrible writing) is buried with excessively loud 'background' music (ranging from Satie to punk rock) but worse is enunciated so softly by the actors that it is indecipherable. Yes, Shakespeare wrote his plays in iambic pentameter, but not a word is lost in performances because the actors enunciate with perfect diction and allow the poetry to flow naturally, making it become simply dialogue of elegance. Potter's poetry is spotty, so perhaps it is as well that much of it is lost. When it works, it is stunning. Joan Allen is radiant in this role and gives us as defined a character as possible given the script limitations. Much the same can be said for Armenian actor Simon Abkarian. And despite the conflicts in their philosophies that threaten to crack the crystal of their affair, there is a true chemistry here. Some characters such as Shirley Henderson try very hard but simply swallow their lines in annoying and blurry accents.

Sounds like a lot of negatives? Well, they are there, but for this viewer the piece still gives the same satisfaction as hearing a new symphonic work or viewing a form of visual art in progress. There is much beauty here, enough to beg forgiveness for the shortcomings. Grady Harp, November 05",1131753600,,3546,4.91652754590985
2403013,1,B000B6CO5C,"I was interested in watching Yes, but in the end it's a long and boring movie. The poetic aspect of the script is annoying and seems like something out of a Shakespeare movie.",1131667200,3,175,4.333333333333333
2403014,5,B000B6CO5C,"""Yes"" is a must-see for every light-skinned woman who has ever had a dark-skinned lover, or has ever had a lover who was totally there and then not there. Doesn't that cover just about all of us?? I imagine that's why the male protagonist is simply called ""He"" and the female is ""She.""

 The dialogue between the man and woman after he loses his job and lashes out at her is so utterly believable and familiar. I've never seen this terribly painful dilemma captured in a movie before, and I believe that Potter has done so entirely authentically and successfully.

It is amazing what Sally Potter has done as the author, director, and in some cases even the composer of this very deep movie that is captured in iambic pentameter without ever feeling the least bit contrived! Just brilliant. I couldn't believe that I was actually hearing Shakespearian-type poetry coming out of the mouth of the black cook! Yet it was completely believable to me, and I rarely enjoy Shakespeare. I wonder if the objections of so many male reviewers might reflect a sense of outrage at having a woman take over a field that has, in the past, been reserved for men?

 I am intrigued by what happens when you put this tool in the hands of a woman. The soliloquoy of the heroine's dying Irish aunt to her errant neice is utterly profound and deserves to be transcribed and framed. The fact that the aunt's monologue takes place in an entirely telepathic context adds yet another dimension, especially when there is  the slightest bleed-through as the aunt utters just a few words that confirm that the heroine has heard her aunt's dying mental tirade accurately. At any rate, my bonnet goes off to Sally Potter who has done a stunning job.",1125532800,3,1718,4.653465346534653
2403015,3,B000B6CO5C,"Yes is a movie that can be more worthwhile watching if the viewer is a die-hard Joan Allen fan, because she's so intense and captivating throughout this intricate dialogue driven sexual and romantic drama. Having seen her in the delirously funny The Upside of Anger earlier this year, I was eager to check out pretty much anything that has her in it. On top of that, I really loved Sally Potter's Orlando(Tilda Swinton), so I really had to say yes to seeing this film, despite so much negative reviews.

Joan Allen plays a successful Irish-American biologist(She) and she's married to Anthony(Sam Neil), whom she no longer loves and they both have lost hope in their marriage. One day, She meets He(Simon Abkarian), a Lebanese cook who used to be a professional surgeon in his homeland, and they connect sexually and romantically. She is deeply satisfied by He sexually and She hasn't been so happy and alive for years. Their secret affair hit the rocks when He became paranoid about their differences in race, culture, religion, and political influences. He thought they don't belong together and fear condemnation and discrimination by his peers, and decides to reject She. She insisted on persuading him to stay and eventually plans a vacation with him in Cuba, even when He didn't give her a decision.

On the sideline, there is a ""solo"" cleaner character played by Shirley Henderson(Close Your Eyes), who appeared several times cleaning She's house and talks to the audiences about her insights on germs and dirts. I don't see much purpose of having this role in the film, because it didn't connect well with the central plot. There is also the God-daughter character that was depressed dued to over-weight issue, and She simply tells her that looks fine. Sam neil's part is rather low-key and underexposed. He was good when he had an arguement with She.

Joan Allen had numerous big moments in this film. The scene when He masterbated her to an orgasm in a restaurant while dirty talking was funny and gripping. The parking lot arguement scene between He and She was quite a dramatic moment, since the two leads had to deliver long and confrontational sensitive lines. I think she's more captivating when she was doing her solo scenes. She's very good at conveying her character's complex state of emotions.

This movie would work better or at least be more entertaining if Potter written the dialogues in a modern style instead of iambic pentameter. It just somehow added distraction to the film, and it didn't feel natural. Potter still deserves the credit for her unique visual style and the courage to tackle sensitive subjects in a romantic drama.",1122422400,,2658,4.9
2403016,1,B000B6CO5C,"I have never walked out of a movie before.  Last night I almost did.  (My two friends agreed)  This movie is highly pretentious, trying to tackle too many poignant topics, using 1st-grader video effects and setting it all to pseudo-Shakespearian rhyme.  The most interesting character was in a coma!  The crazy maid (who was Moaning Mona in the Harry Potter movie.....you cannot mistake that voice) was the only thing worthwhile and she was hardly in the movie.  If you want a story set to ridiculous poetry, explore the world of Dr. Seuss!  I would tell you how I really feel about it, but Amazon would probably not print my review!",1121990400,5,633,4.7
2403017,4,B000B6CO5C,"I'm greatly divided about ""Yes."" I absolutely adore the way in which Sally Potter delivers her message. Not only are the performances outstanding, but the visuals are interesting while the use of iambic pentameter becomes passionate, natural, and visceral rather than distracting. However, I feel most of what she has to say has been said before. Though I'm a sucker for such collections of my political views as well as film makers who adamently convey them on screen, part of me feels Potter never makes that extra step in elevating the message to a new, more transcendent level. She nears such a level with a wonderful sense of objectivity. Often times, both cases to a situation are presented and no unwavering conclusions are drawn. For instance, He (one of the film's protagonists played with charisma by Simon Abkarian) is arguing in his restaurant's kitchen with another employee, but before one or the other wins, the manager walks in and breaks up this verbal quarrel, leaving ""the answer"" up in the air. Also, those that clean up after the wealthy protagonists (literally and figuratively) are given a significant voice. In fact, they end the film, and a central cleaner's image lingers even after the credits begin (a haunting device).

Now, about the iambic pentameter. Most critics almost seemed angry about the use of this style greatly identified with Shakespeare. But I'm with Roger Ebert on this issue; it's not as if imabic pentameter is only allowed to be in a work of Shakespeare. This specific style seems to add a sense of passion to Potter's dialogue, which is appropriate considering the film's politics. But to those who claim the iambic pentameter is inherently distracting, I present to you my two friends with whom I saw ""Yes."" Neither of them knew anything at all about the film, and neither noticed it was in iambic pentameter. And if they did, neither of them brought it up and neither were severely distracted or bothered. Perhaps most critics complain about its presence because the film is famed for being completely in iambic pentameter and they knew it existed before the film began. It was in their heads and if they did not approve of the idea coming in, there's a great chance they wouldn't change their minds mid-way through.

On top of this evidence I present Joan Allen. What an actress! She's already proved that she's one of the very best among American actresses (no, all actresses), but she's said iambic pentameter presented to her a challenge, and she handles it unbelievably well. All of the actors provide the dialogue with a balance between the meter and naturalism, but Ms. Allen by far achieves this balance the best. It's as if the iambic pentameter was her vehicle to bring the character She to other, more profound levels. The way she delivers certain lines (""So we...are at war."") is utterly devastating. The camera studies her eyes and in them we see worlds of depth, which is almost her trademark. So far, her performance is this year's best in her category (perhaps of all categories). Still, no matter the beautiful dialogue or the dimensional performances, everything feels at least slightly trite. However, the way Potter has delivered this message is brave. She may not bring the message to entirely new levels, but in ""Yes"" we see it in a more objective, more passionate light. Not many people cared for ""Yes"" but I recommend it for one doesn't come across such uniquely done films all that often.",1121731200,3,3463,4.877758913412563
2403018,3,B000B6CO5C,"I have come across nothing but negative reviews for Sally Potter's lastest film. A.O Scott of the New York Times has bashed the film, Richard Roeper, a critic I don't respect, has bashed the film, The Chicago Tribune trashed it. The only positive review I have come across was from Roger Ebert.

 I tell you all of this because it seems here is an example of how sometimes the critics get it wrong. But before we go into that lets talk about what the film is about first.

 Joan Allen plays an Irish-American simply known as ""She"", she is married, unhappily, to Anthony (Sam Neil). They do not even speak to together, and whenever we see them in the same room, an agrument usually follows. What their problems are I do not know. Can it be as simple as they do not love each other anymore, but neither has the strenght to do anything about it?

 One day at a social gathering ""She"" meets ""He"" (Simon Abkarian) a Lebanese cook who use to be a doctor in his homeland but left once politics became overbearing. He was told he could only help those who shared the ""correct"" political views of the country.

 The two begin a love affair that takes the movie into a world of cultural values, politics, religion, sex and love (yes the two are seperate, at least in this movie).

 Now for the criticism the film has received. First of all the movie was written in iambic pentameter. The fact the character's dialogue rhymes bothered some critics so that is was all they could talk about. But by doing this you overlook two very important things. One, instead of complaining about the dialogue why not try to understand why Sally Potter decided to write the dialogue in this manner. What does it give the movie? Secondly, I think Roger Ebert gives the best defense I've heard. He claims so what. Shakespeare wrote in the same manner. And as the old saying goes, 'whats good enough Shakespeare is good enough for me'. So in other words, don't let the speech patterns bother you.

 The second point of criticism the film has received is because some feel it is too political. Why are we bashing movies that have ideas? Is it simply because we do not agree with what they are saying? Well isn't that too bad. All movies try to manipulate our feelings. Movies show us the lives of people we would normally never meet. They teach us about different worlds, well at least the best ones do. That is what makes movies so special. We have an investment in characters that clearly the movie tells us what to feel and who to feel it for and when and why we should feel it. It is simply the way movies work. A.O. Scott says the movie wants us to simply nod our heads in agreement with whatever Potter says. I say, all movies want that.

 But despite my protest to the critics I am unable to call ""Yes"" a full blown masterpiece. It has masterful moments no doubt, but at certain points in the film I was kept at a distance. In the end the only fault I have with the movie is that these are not characters. We do not feel for them the way perhaps Potter intended us to. These people are merely give speeches but do not live beyond the page.

 Though I don't think Sally Potter ever intended for these characters to really be individuals. That is why I think she named them ""He"" and ""She"". They are suppose to represent all of us. They are you and me. Their story is all of our stories.

 Hopefully I have influenced you to see this movie. Maybe, just maybe I have shown you why I disagree with the critics. ""Yes"" has a lot to offer. As I sit here writing this movie I have to be honest, talking and thinking about the movie makes me appreciate it more and more. ""Yes"" is a really worthwhile film. Joan Allen is amazing, and if their is any justice in the world she will be given an Oscar nomination. How sad to think that this film opened on the same day as ""The Fantastic Four"" and ""Dark Water"", one of which will be the box-office champ over the weekend, probably ""Four"" and a movie such as ""Yes"" will go unseen.  *** 1/2 out of *****

 Bottom-line: Powerful engaging film that has a lot of ideas. It grapples with some big subjects and finds there are no easy answers, just as in real life. Joan Allen is unforgettable and should receive an Oscar nomination.",1120780800,,4237,4.3719745222929935
2403019,4,B000B6CO5C,"Sally Potter is a true visionary: an artist with a striking and unusual visual sense as well as one with a distinctive point of view.

At this point in her film career (the turgid ""The Tango Lesson"" and the remarkably mannered ""The Man Who Cried""...a film even Johnny Depp, Cristina Ricci and Cate Blanchett couldn't save), ""Orlando"" is arguably her best film but that may have at least as much to do with Tilda Swinton than it does with Potter.

And now there is ""Yes,"" Potter's latest which is at times palpably sensual, silly, irritating and preposterous...but oddly enough never boring.

""Yes"" is the story of a love affair between an Irish-American woman, pretentiously called ""She"" (a sexy, luminescent Joan Allen) and a Lebanese Surgeon, even more pretentiously called ""He,"" apparently without license to perform surgery who is working as a cook and sometime waiter. They meet at a formal, very stuffy dinner that She attends with her insufferable husband, Anthony (Sam Neil)...who promptly ditches She at the beginning of the dinner party to be with his colleagues.

He and She quickly attach themselves to each other both literally and figuratively. They are besotted at first glance and it is with these scenes that Potter seems most at ease: the flirting, the disrobing, the lovemaking all come naturally to Potter's sensibilities and they are truly sexually charged and transcendentally sensual. When Potter ventures into the moral, social and political, she loses focus and the film goes adrift.

Potter has written the entire script in Iambic Pentameter-""The language of Shakespeare"" and though at times the verse is a pleasure to hear, most of the time it's just uncomfortable for the actors to speak and therefore for us to hear: adopting modern speech and more to the point modern thoughts to the rhythm of I.P. doesn't always work. Unfortunately, we become too aware of the rhyming to sit back and bask in the beauties of the verse.

""Yes"" is always breath-takingly beautiful to watch. There is a scene towards the end of the film between He and She in which Potter lovingly captures He placing his big curly-haired head on She's pale green silk lap that is the essence of what is good about this film: the overt sensuality of the tamed ""beast"" seeking succor from ""beauty"": it is a scene that lingers in the mind long after the last frame of the film flickers away.",1119916800,16,2384,4.888613861386139

2403027,4,B000B6CO5C,"Two of my favorite films are ones by Sally Potter, _The Tango Lesson_ and _Orlando._ So it was pretty much a given that at some point, I'd sit down and take in Yes, a film about two nameless people who encounter one another, and lives get turned upside down.

She (Joan Allen) is a research scientist, married to an icy politician, Anthony (Sam Neill), who only seems to find any sort of emotional release in the blues. When we first meet them, they're off to a dinner party, all very formal, and he warns her not to make a scene. Once there, She wanders into the dining room, where a very elegant mideastern man in a tuxedo (Simon Abkarian) has a passing conversation with her.

It's clear enough that they are both interested in each other, enough to where She hands Him her business card on the stairs. A phone call, a meeting, and soon, enough, the interest and conversation soon lands them both in bed together. It's a slow, tumultuous affair, lasting from spring blossoms, to the Christmas season.

Others, from His co-workers in the restaurant where he is a chef, and Her family and friends, suspect that something is up, but no one can quite put a finger on it. His coworkers engage in the nature of God and religion and of course, women, over dirty pots and dishes, and she goes running and out and about with her sister Kate (Samantha Bond) and her niece.

Her world is the sparse, sterile one of the London flat, all whites and bare walls, crisp white couches and linens, while His is full of colour and textures. And She, under his careful touch and words, slowly begins to bloom.

But things start to unravel, first for Him, when an argument with a fellow employee results in a drawn knife, and for Her, when her husband can't even summon up the guts to engage in an verbal fight with her. And that animosity expands to the He and She, with her being drawn away to a death in her birthplace of Belfast, and he runs to his homeland of Beruit.

No, not everyone is going to like this one. The themes are very adult, it's mostly a plotless film about two people who find each other, lose one another and then come again full circle. Everyone in this one are extremely lonely, each one existing in their own little microcosm, and rarely can see beyond themselves if at all.

In fact, the only ones who seem to get what things are really about are the various charwomen in the film, especially the one who cleans She and Anthony's immaculatte London flat (Shirley Henderson), who whispers up commentary and secrets as she gazes directly at the viewer. All of the cleaning women in this film, who silently push about their brooms and mops and brushes, seem to be saying can you believe these fools?

And frankly, that's where the film starts to disintegrate. While it's composed of beautiful cinematography and images, the dialogue is of rather insipid poetry -- nice, but rarely inspiring -- there are times when it is delivered in such muddled sound that I had to really crank up the volume to hear, or just guess at what was being said.

That's a big problem. Too, there isn't a plot beyond of He and She's encounters, and the unraveling of their lives until they have to make choices. Sadly, the film only has subtitles in French, so I couldn't even resort to using the subtitles to figure out the story. Another problem was that I was left wondering if the story was about discrimmination and the question of terrorism through His eyes, or her general alienation to everything for Her. Secondary characters appear, give soloquies, then vanish into the background, and don't do much except to spread more confusion in their wake.

Sadly, there really ought to be more on the DVD to help the viewer along. The only audio track is in English, and the only subtitles are in French; there is a photo gallery of images in the film, and a little featurette on the making of the pivotal scene in the film, where the relationship shatters in the face of reality. Nice, but there could have been much more, what with the level of DVD technology these days.

Sally Potter both directed and wrote the script for this one, and while I really admire her courage in seeing her vision through to the end, it's a murky one at best, and a snoozer at worst. Not for everyone, but if you have the patience to sit through it to the end, you might find it an interesting 'slice of life' film.

2403028,2,B000B6CO5C,"Writer/director Sally Potter's movie ""Yes"" gives us an inkling - at least in terms of style - of what it might be like if Shakespeare were alive today and writing screenplays (though one hopes that they would turn out considerably better than this one happens to be).  The ""unique"" characteristic of the film is that the characters discuss the meaning of life and the complexities of relationships entirely in poetic verse.  Pure rhymes, slant rhymes, internal rhymes - virtually every type of rhyme can be found in this film.  The problem is that the novelty of the conceit wears off mighty quickly, so that all we are ultimately left with are a bunch of pretentious, whiney characters driving us crazy with their high-toned blathering.  Allow me to propose a simple rule of thumb: you know you'll be needing a sturdy pair of hip boots to wade through any movie, play or novel in which two of the main characters are referred to simply as He and She.

I hope I won't be dismissed as a Philistine for objecting to this film.  As a matter of fact, I am always open for anything even remotely novel and different in filmmaking, and I actually quite like the idea of a movie that plays like an extended poem.  The problem is that I just couldn't stand any of the people we were being asked to care about in this particular work.  Joan Allen and Sam Neill play a middle-aged English couple whose marriage has long ago become a hollow shell.  They are clearly intended to be models of the enervated upper class - cynical, bored, filled with ennui and unable to communicate their innermost thoughts and feelings to one another - but we've seen these types of characters and marriages so many times before that Anthony and She feel more like caricatures than actual people (I`m not quite sure why he gets a real name and she - I mean She - doesn`t, but no matter).  And their speaking in verse only makes them all that more insufferable in their pseudo-profundity and monumental self-absorption.

Allen, due to her extraordinary gifts as an actress, is at least able to cut through the pretentiousness and create some feeling for her character, but Neill and Simon Abkarian (who looks distressingly like Borat), as a chef from Beirut who becomes her lover (he`s the He to Allen`s She), are not quite so fortunate.  Moreover, to make matters worse, in a movie in which language plays such a crucial part, some of the accents are so thick that much of the dialogue is simply incomprehensible.  That only compounds the frustration of watching the movie.

There are some genuinely lyrical moments when the movie seems to be working and we can see what the filmmakers were trying to get at.  But, unfortunately, those wind up being too few and far between to keep us from voting a resounding ""Nay"" to ""Yes.""",1165017600,3,2795,4.652439024390244
2403029,5,B000B6CO5C,I just finished watching this movie.  A visual masterpiece! so beautiful and the poetry...so intense.

2403030,5,B000B6CO5C,"Multi-layered look at our interconnectedness...

As I watched this film, it spoke to My deepest soul. I could feel almost a veiling effect of the issues that face each man and woman, each race, each country, each struggle within each individual. The veils lifting as each scene, dialogue and exchange occurred. Metaphorically, the characters SHE and HE represent so many aspects of all relationships we as humans hold, even the ones we hold in collective consciousness and from conditioned cultural or spiritual thought. This movie is a very deep look into the human soul, with subjects such as compassion, understanding, superficiality, listening and not hearing, healing, bonds, the ties of our own personal history, cultural identity, inner struggles with archetypes... It is a subtle way of making you think as you observe with the effects lasting many days after the viewing. I especially enjoyed the way the writer/director had THOUGHTS coming as dialogue instead of spoken words.

How many times are we thinking something and not saying out loud for fear of rejection, fear of our own guilt or shame? There were so many beautiful and profound scenes in this brilliant film it is difficult to speak of each of them separately. Also included is a featurette which shows the writer/director in intimate dialogue with the two lead actors just as we went to war ON Iraq... making the scene they refer to so much more important.

This film is a perfect example of the direction we as humans need to move into - a deeper understanding and observation of our actions and thoughts and the profound cause and effect they have on the world, not just our world.

I highly recommend this film to anyone who believes in quantum physics, who is interested in human anthropology, different cultures and their beliefs, the differences and similarities in religious thought and practice, the relationships between humankind and men and women, in families and the understanding of what we know as God or the creator, and finally of ""WE"". After all, We are all one... We are all human, sharing this period of time and space for a reason. Let's think about our actions, our motives, our unspoken fears and attitudes... This is a very moving and healing film because it opens our hearts and our eyes to be able to GROW and with growth comes profound change, and that is what we need to save the world from the direction it is currently heading.

This film seems to say Let's LOVE and say YES to that love, and thereby to life! Bravo!!!!!!!!!",1157155200,,2526,4.851508120649652

2403033,5,B000B6CO5C,"Yes is a cinematic masterpiece. As observed by others, not always positively, Yes is nothing short of contemporary Shakespeare. The iambic pentameter dialogue is delivered so deftly many viewers do not perceive the rhyming for the first 15 or 20 minutes of the film.

Like Shakespeare, profound observations are suggested by minor characters, such as cleaning people. Like Shakespeare the dialogue is effused with wonderful wordplay, humor, intelligence and zesty sex.

Since Yes was written for the screen, layers of content are given visually; like the fact that the cleaning people, for the most part invisible to the primary cast as in real life, are the only characters to address the camera/audience directly.

Sally Potters genius is compounded by the lush visual texture of this film as well as her incredible ambient soundtrack -- I wish I could buy it. My one critical comment is that the dialogue is sometimes difficult to hear. Turn up the volume, this is a profound work.

Let's face up to it, if you enjoy mainstream TV, this movie probably isn't for you. This isn't Friends and Survivor simpleton dreamtime. Art demands the investment of thinking.",1137196800,21,1162,5.0680628272251305

I saw it just today and I confess,
That having had today four teeth removed
I spent the day with films and never moved.
Of all the shows I saw, this was the best,
Though if you're (rightly) loath to be impressed
By my opinions, drugged-up and fatigued,
I've reasons that I thought you'd be intrigued:
The dialogue, which flows like seven seas,
Is served in rhyming couplets, much like these,
With iambs counting five in every line.
Delivering the lines, it sounds divine:
The actors speak like poets, to a word;
Pedantic sing-song speech is never heard.
The themes it treats are numerous and strange-
There's death and sex and carpe-diem change-
But love is at the center of the tale:
The confidence that passion can prevail,
The perfect beauty of the spoken word,
The conflict of who will and won't be heard,
And silent cleaning girls who, while they cleanse
Send piercing gazes through the camera lens
(Including one whose speech bookends the show,
Whom Moaning Myrtle's Potter fans will know).

In short: O fans of pentametric verse!
All films, compared with this, seem much the worse.
Its muselike powers I can answer to;
It moved me to perhaps move all of you
To see a movie willing to be art,
To thrill the ear, illuminate the heart.
And does it, in its goal, meet with success?
My answer is, of course, a fervent Yes.",1136332800,63,1358,4.588477366255144
2403037,5,B000B6CO5C,"I think that many of the reviewers of this film contradict themselves.  They degrade it as unnecessarily complicated and yet further degrade it as empty, lacking the depth of its aspirations.  One reviewer compares it to Shakespeare.  Why?  Most assume that if a film is to do something as bold and intricate as welcome its entire dialog into iambic pentameter then the director, in her annoyingly avant-garde quest, must fashion some otherworldly vision, something that will ""change the way movies are made!"", as they say.  And YES, I agree, some of the rhymes do fall flat (the reviewer from Japan mentioned the surgical reference), but as I saw it, the rhyming was merely a vehicle to give this lush film a refined elegance and the will to take heart with elements of the fantastic.  And why are we so hesitant to allow or accept such a thing?  What would have made the surgical reference more acceptable had it been said in prose?  Moreover, why don't we all walk around speaking in a sly, well thought-out rhyming pattern?  It would be difficult, and would limit our ability to communicate, but then, aren't the most important things those that don't need to be said, or rather can't?  What if when speaking to our lover we spoke only in a delicately chartered melody and relied simply on our ability to feel and understand one another to leave the rest unsaid?  Language is utterly unimportant, it gets in the way.  If people used their feelings more than their mouths I suspect unhappiness would not be as widespread.  Take the scene in the film when She demands that her husband argue with her, and he correctly queries as to the point.  They know the way they feel, and words, no matter how heated or infused with passion, could never express what needs to felt, not heard.  And yet, even our characters understand this.  For them, language is like a prison, a way of ""talking everything away.""  She does this for a living, attempting to convince through vocal complexities the many reasons why abortion is not murder, why God does not exist.  But remember, this is only what She says, when we hear her thoughts we know she converses with God and begs Him to forgive her for not believing in Him, for playing scientist with cells and organic matter and attempting in her vast loneliness to ""penetrate the mind of God.""  And so, if language is a prison, why not make it beautiful?  Why not adorn it with intricacies so that only that which must be said is said?  Again the characters understand this.  In their confrontation in the parking garage, He asks She how many words in Arabic she can speak, then asking her if she understands the difficulty it takes for a nonnative speaker of English to constantly seek out the rhyming of words, thus admitting that not only do they recognize their odd pattern, but that in his love for her, he battles the very will of language so that what he must say to her is said.  They understand their prison.  It is words and thoughts that keep them apart, their hearts usher them into the arms of one another.

I'm fully aware that I'm looking deeper than the film requires, but I could just as easily use it as a vehicle to ask in the same manner as I do of why we all don't speak in rhymes, ""Why do we hate and hurt one another?""...""Why do we die in wonderment of who's God is King?""  The film asks these things.  His quest to remain pure to his faith threatens to break them apart, yet in the end they both seemingly realize that regardless of God's preference, He has marred them both with the same loneliness, with the same need for one another.  And so if as the film argues, it is true that the word ""No"" does not exist nor has it ever, when these two lovers look to Heaven and ask of God is it possible that they be together and truly love one another unconditionally and unapologetically without incurring His wrath, then His only response could be...",1135728000,6,3904,4.538571428571428
2403038,2,B000B6CO5C,"Some people, referring to the words and the images of `Yes,' often talk about the beauty of the film. With all respect, however, of all the things in the world, beauty is the most subjective kind of value among us. While some love odes written by, say, Keats, others prefer the longer and freer verses of Whitman. So, read the following lines, and see what you can find in Sally Potter's film you are about to see.

I was a doctor. With a knife

I cut the flesh to save the life.

How do you think? If you find the above poem is fantastic, the film is for you. Considerable portion of the film's monologues and dialogues is spoken with Potter's own verses, but to be frank with you (and so frank that you might be offended), I think that hip hop singers these days can think of better rhymes.

The film starts promisingly, with strangely engaging monologues by strangely charming Shirley Henderson as housekeeper looking right into the camera. She talks about the dirt that cannot be gone, and that her existence in the house is virtually ""invisible,"" giving her a good chance to observe the husband and wife, and their troubles.

Then the wife simply called `She' (Joan Allen) appears. She knows the marriage with her husband (typecast Sam Neill) is over. She is born in Ireland, but was raised in America, and works as a doctor (like the quoted poem), but feels the emptiness of life.

Then you meet `He.'  He (Simon Abkarian) is a cook from Lebanon, and falls in love with `She' instantly. She also loves `He,' but when they thought everything was looking fine, the difference between their cultural backgrounds start to sour the relations.

I admit the good intention of director Sally Potter, but the contrived methods used by her are not suitable to the complex materials, which involve too many on-going social issues. I am talking about rhymes and meters, which require certain skills of choosing the right words and appropriate images in order to express such controversial issues as ethnicity or religion. I don't say Potter's poems are all bad. But when She and He exchange the words `Imperialist' and `Terrorist,' both of which are uttered in the way far from graceful, the film's initial intention of containing social messages in verbal beauty obviously starts to crumble.

Another problem is the camera. Potter uses too many pointless slant camera and jump-cuts, and even the images from surveillance camera are inserted. What do they want to say? To make matters worse, characters use too many voiceovers, and most annoyingly, they repeat the exact words aloud. Perhaps Potter is thinking about the `steam of consciousness' of James Joyce (hence the title of `Yes' which concludes, if I am not mistaken, one of his books). But the results only fall flat with the words too repetitious. This flaw might be forgiven in `Ulysses,' but not in the spoken words on screen.

The acting is good, especially that of Joan Allen as you can always expect from this hugely talented Oscar nominee even before watching the film, and equally impressive is Shirley Henderson, who is riveting, knowing how to imbue life into the words her character speaks of. But the film itself is made with too heavy-handed direction, which tries to include too many things in 100 minutes.",1135036800,8,3273,4.797513321492007
2403039,2,B000B6CO5C,"What would happen if we erased Sally Potter's name from the credits and added William Shakespeare instead? Is the iambic pentameter worthy of his name? Like most Shakespere, I sometimes find the spoken verse tenuous to watch, and yet, when compared to say, Much Ado about Nothing in 1993, I can see that while this script would be a noble experiement that would receive and ""A"" for effort in a Creative Writing class, somehow falls short of expectations. ""Much Ado about Nothing"" was a 5 star romp that showed the true talent of Shakespeare. ""Yes"" had some stunning poetry (The last verse was the best below), but not enough weight to carry a movie. In the end, while thought provoking, I have to give the movie as a whole a thumbs down.

And, in the end, it simply isn't worth / Your while to try and clean your life away. / You can't. For, everything you do or say / Is there, forever.

It is written in a modern English version of iambic pentameter, the rhythm scheme of Shakespeare. That, alone, is marvelous to experience.

8082338,4,B000B6CO5C,"This erotic fantasy, ""Yes"", one with lots of bared skin but nothing close to full nudity (no outright full dorsal or frontal nakedness), is a bit patchy. Simon Abkarian is a sleekly lean, handsome, and well-made man, so it is worth seeing as much, literally, of him as one can! His slyly affectionate gallantries endear him to viewers as they so do, obviously, to the lady who benefits from his amourous attentions. At its best, the first part of the film when the couple is getting ever closer to each other in intimacy, there is a wonderful dreamlike quality, which the lilt of the poetic verses in which the characters (they and others in the film) converse carries one along drifting on the lyricism of the screenplay.

When ""love goes bad"", however, the film seems unconvincingly motivated. The lovers have, for awhile, irreconcilable cultural antagonism that their affair really does not seem to justify except in barren stereotypes. Thus the temporary rupture between them (which, along with losing his job in the U.K., results in the man's return to Beyrouth, in his native Lebanon) seems too contrived to be more naturally convincing. Not to worry, though, the lovers reconcile, on (for them) the neutral turf of Cuba and all ends hopefully (or so, at least, it seems) for this pair, from what I could grasp of the film. There are subsidiary characters and narratives in the movie which other reviewers on Amazon's various national WWW sites describe in their own reviews, so I shall not delve into them here.

It would have helped enormously if there had been English subtitles. I am becoming somewhat hard of hearing and there was much of the dialogue that simply did not register on my ears. There are French subtitles (in, at any rate, the North American edition that I acquired, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment 10906, in the series, ""Sony Pictures Classics""), but this film so strives (intermittently successfully and short of that) for a literary effect in English that seeing and understanding the original text along with the images really would count for much.
