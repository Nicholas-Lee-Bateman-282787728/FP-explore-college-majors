8336304,5,B000GUCWPA,This video was one I was interested in getting for a while; and once I did was pleasantly surprised as to how good it was. Most of the songs were familiar (again due to being reused for Colby's Clubhouse; albeit in some cases in different arrangements) but the highlight was a terrific medley of hymns toward the end of the plot. Very glad I got this video.,1395187200,,357,4.343283582089552
