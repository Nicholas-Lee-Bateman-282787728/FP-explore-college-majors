8208306,2,B000T9FUYS,"Blaxploitation comedy meets zombie horror in this microbudget feature...that says it all.

ACTING: The acting was so-so at best. Some were okay, and some were horrible. It was kind of difficult to distinguish between bad acting and playing up the roles the actors were given.

PRODUCTION: Much of this movie was just insulting. The lighting, sound, special effects, filming, pacing, make up...all mediocre. Usually, in a low/no budget flick, some of these are bad, not all of them. The powers that be were trying for ""Return of the Living Dead"" meets ""Superfly"" and it just didn't happen.

ZOMBIES: If you can look past the horrible Halloween masks and cheap afro wigs bought on clearance after last Halloween, the zombies seem almost human in their quest to get lucky and brains (of course).

THE CAUSE: Pheromones coming from a nearby brothel.

NUDITY: Most definitely.

FINAL: This was a pretty rough watch. I think in the right hands with something that resembles a budget, this could have been interesting. Some of the humor was okay, but it just wasn't enough to carry this movie. I would recommend that you give this one a pass.",1250726400,2,1135,4.885416666666667
