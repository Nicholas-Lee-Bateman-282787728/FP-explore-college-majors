8468345,3,B005EIJO46,"I'm a horror movie aficionado, so naturally when I stumbled acrossed this ""Cursed"" DVD, I was curious, even a bit intrigued. However, I had the feeling that this was going to be an amateur video, so I kept my expectations low. I wasn't disappointed! The story was really nothing groundbreaking. Jin, the lovely but hapless reporter, goes to the scene of a murder that had evidence of some satanic ritual. By visiting the crime scene she unwittingly unleashes a demonic force that hounds her. The scenes of the subsequent hauntings are reminiscent of ""Paranormal Activity"" and, most recently, ""Amityville Haunting."" Rather than short films, this probably could have been a full-scale motion picture. Nevertheless, I appreciated the effort.

The star, Mary Lelina, is an actress of Filipino descent, and quite a lovely lady, at that. To fully appreciate the effort of the moviemaker, you'll have to get past the amateur-to-bad acting, the not-so-special effects and a thin story line, but again, I appreciated the effort.",1328486400,3,1019,5.175757575757576
