Kids are enthralled by the story line and really get into the movements. They learn valuable techniques that they recall when faced with a challenging situation. These DVDs teach life skills that will serve the child for a lifetime.",1399852800,,407,4.814285714285714

Scooter & Me: Possum's Tail - Kids Yoga DVD for Balance and Concentration.
27 min. Produced by Move with Me(tm) Action Adventures.
2010- 2011 release. PreSchool-Gr 2.

In this yoga program that helps develop balance, instructor Wendy Phillips Piret,'guides a class of eight ethnically diverse boys and girls through a story in'which they are involved in actively moving through the adventures. After a'brief stretch routine that includes ""Head, shoulders, knees, and tails,""'Piret takes the children down south to the Louisiana Swampland where they'meet a little possum with no tail who must learn to balance as she climbs'trees, crosses rivers, and avoids alligators. Children become birds catching'fish, cypress trees balancing, a boy riding a scooter, and a possum'cavorting through the woods as they move through a series of yoga poses.'Along the way they learn to employ two ""adventure skills."" The first is'turning ""oh, no"" into ""ah, yes"" by relaxing and breathing. The second skill'is called ""elephant wisdom"" and involves giving oneself a gentle ear rub to'focus on increasing hearing/listening skills. Piret, an expressive and'engaging storyteller, brings humor to her delivery. A soundtrack with'chirping crickets, exploding thunder, music, and other sounds enhances the'mood. A fun and ingenious approach to getting kids moving!

The simple poses, combined with the imagination and adventure as told through the story - a great resource for indoor recess, physical education, or those days when the kids need a little something extra to kick start their brains.  Highly recommended!",1323561600,2,319,5.235294117647059
8427070,5,B004EJTGQW,"The Move with Me DVD series is, in my opinion, the best young children's yoga series available.  It is creative, engaging, fun and playful - these are the best ways for young children to learn about their minds and bodies.  I am recommending this series to all my trainees and teachers.
I look forward to more products.

8427071,5,B004EJTGQW,"I've purchased the Storyland Yoga and Yoga Phonics DVDs for my children, and this one is the best in my opinion. It follows the story of a possum who has no tail and goes in search of her balance. My children really enjoy the story and they benefit from the instruction of an adult while watching children do the routine. I also like the ""adventure skills"" included in the disc that help to teach the children how to be resourceful and be good problem solvers. I'm looking forward to buying more discs in this series.",1313280000,4,517,4.4526315789473685
