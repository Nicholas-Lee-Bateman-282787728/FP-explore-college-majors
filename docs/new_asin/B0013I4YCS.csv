8251057,3,B0013I4YCS,"I really like Jacquelin Smith, she's a really kind, gentle, and lovely woman who genuinely cares about the people and their friends (pets/animals) she's trying to help. I loved her book on the same subject, but unfortunately the DVD just didn't deliver as we'd hoped it would. We felt the title of the DVD was a bit misleading because this DVD is not so much a DVD about HOW to communicate telepathically with animals, as much as it is an overview of Jacquelin's experiences as an animal communicator, with a very brief overview of how one might begin animal communication.

My husband and I watched this video together because our dog was having problems and we wanted to know if we could find out first hand what was going on. I truly believe communication between our companions (pets) and ourselves is possible, and I hoped this DVD would tell us exactly how to go about communicating with our dog. I was looking for methods we could use, and things we could try to begin the practice of communicating with animals. I've often thought it would be great fun to have this skill. Not only could it prove to be lifesaving if you encounter a threatening animal, but it would be fun to be able to chat with any animal we happen to encounter! (I'd like to tell the birds not to nest right next to our front door ... for a couple of reasons!)

My husband is a little more the skeptic, and isn't as much into quantum physics, the metaphysical, and expanding our psychic senses as I, but he's a good sport and goes along with it so he can spend more time with me. Over the years he's seen and read enough that he does believe in many of the things I've studied. Still, he's not quite as ""into it"" as I, and listens with a skeptics ear -which is good - it gives us balance.

As we watched the video, and time was passing, we kept looking at each other and thinking, .. ""So when does she tell us HOW to do this?!"" Jacquelin told many heartfelt stories about her adventures with both humans and animals - deciding well into her career as a psychic to work more strictly with animals because they don't create the same type of problems that humans do. Not that finding a lost cat is easy, or getting a traumatized animal to open up is easy either, but I think what she was saying is that animals are pure of heart and don't play games with us like people do .. even if they don't necessarily mean to cause problems.

Toward the end of the DVD Jacquelin did talk a bit about relaxing, asking permission to ""speak"" to the animal, and being open to any communication that might occur between yourself and with whomever it is you're trying to communicate. She explained that animals communicate more in pictures than in words, so we should try to envision what it is we're trying to communicate. I believe this is, for many, the way to begin communicating with animals, or doing whatever sort of psychic exploration you want.

I've heard from other healers, intuitives, and psychics that when we begin to explore our intuitive side what we do will often feel made up, and this is okay. Keep practicing, don't overthink, or over-analyze, & don't give up if it doesn't feel like it's working. Whatever happens just go with it, and sooner or later you'll tap into what you've been trying to do.

Unfortuantely, the part of the DVD where she talked about learning/beginning to communicate with animals was SO brief - we were both disappointed. I think we were looking more for HOW it's done - methods of communicating psychicly, & a variety of things we could try.

IMO, if this is someone's first exposure to animal communication, or the intuitive senses, and you're disappointed, don't give up. This DVD offers a nice preview into the world of someone who makes their living working with animals via psychic communication. It's not really a DVD on HOW to communicate telepathically, as much as an overview of Jacquelin's experiences as an animal communicator. There are plenty of good materials out there to try, and everyone learns differently. This DVD might give some people just what they need to begin, & I might just need something else.

Three stars for effort, minus 2 stars because we didn't think the DVD really delivered, and we didn't think it's really a ""how to"" video as indicated in the title.",1280102400,7,4292,4.557717250324254
