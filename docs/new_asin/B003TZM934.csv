8405557,1,B003TZM934,"What we have here is a VHS bootleg product. Quality varies from decent to horrible. It's a DVD-R and expensive starting at about $17.00.  The prints are from the Home Movie market companies like Exclusive Movies, Thunderbird Films and Blackhawk Films. The Blackhawk prints are copyright, and illegal to distribute. Exclusive is long gone as is Thunderbird. The Pathe shorts are PD, but the MGM titles are still under copyright, and can only be distributed by Film Preservation Associates. It's a shame because these are wonderful films, and they deserve proper presentation.",1356566400,5,574,5.239130434782608
