8158958,1,B000KRNMSK,"I had to watch this video and do a review on it by the end of September to complete my Bachelor's degree.  Four weeks went by and I had received nothing.  I had to email my professor that the assignment woulld not be completed in the allotted time due to the fact that I had not received this video.  I was not happy, and I was embarrassed.  The only bright side to this story was that I got my full refund back; no questions asked.",1348099200,,432,4.047058823529412
8158959,4,B000KRNMSK,"A very moving film.  Lots of hand-held camera and seemingly unscripted or improvised dialogue make this a very live performance.  When it was released 40 years ago, many teachers and psychiatrists disapproved because it raised issues that were ""beyond the understanding of, and could frighten"" ordinary untrained people.  WEDNESDAY'S CHILD / FAMILY LIFE, under its two titles, illustrates some of R.D.Laing's views that a person can retreat into apparent mental illness as a way of protecting their sanity in a dysfunctional family setting.  Although the film has an amateurish quality, this shouldn't be seen as a disqualification.  If anything, it helps show that ordinary people living conventional family lives can find themselves declared ill.  Moving and scary.  Well worth viewing.",1310256000,,788,5.516666666666667
