2676947,4,B000JLTR9K,"To start with it appears to be just another B-grade horror flick complete with a lame storyline. However as you progress through, the story becomes more twisted and strange until your just not quite sure what is going on. There isn't a lot of action and the movie has it's cheesy moments, but overall it's actually quite watch-able. There are a few actors some will notice from Heroes and Desperate Housewives along with the biggest name, the reason most likely that you looked at this movie in the first place, is Lucy Lawless aka Xena. Although her role isn't an important one, she is there quite often, more so than you would expect for a supporting actor role.

If you have a sharp eye and keen intuition, you'll follow the story and pick up on the clues as the movie progresses. And although the ending was lame, it was in all, necessary to complete the story and leave it somewhere where the audience would be happiest. This was a fairly decent movie, but definitely watch it if your a Lucy fan.",1178928000,5,1001,4.530386740331492
2676948,4,B000JLTR9K,"I purchased Darkroom anticipating another Boogeyman type movie, you know a horror, scary type movie with laughs.  Well it's more a pyscho drama with a whodunit twist instead, even the title of the movie is a bit of a mystery.  I did enjoy the movie, Michael does a good job with keeping you engaged in trying to figure out the mystery disappearances of several characters.  Lucy does a very credible job of neglected wife considering this role is a huge departure from anything she's ever done.  The main character has some major issues to resolve in his life and in the end I'm still not sure if he resolves them.  Overall, good acting, a few scary moments, and a twist at the end to keep you guessing.",1170720000,6,703,4.503937007874016

2676951,4,B000JLTR9K,"This was a nice surprise. I went in with little expectations and was immediately suprised by the coherency of the script, the above average acting, and the serpentine story line.  There's certainly plenty to like here including a sufficient amount of bloodletting, some good suspense, and more than a few surprises.  There's also plenty of story, and a satisfying resolution. It may be lowish budget, but it doesn't wear cheapness on it's sleeve which was such a relief.

This one might fall a tad into the ""horror with a heart of gold"" category.  It's easy to see this playing in theaters in say, 1986, with Cory Haim as the young lead. I don't think one need be a die hard horror fan to find enjoyment here either.  Bottom line? A nifty well done thriller deserving of an audience.  Recommended.",1169251200,3,797,4.697841726618705
2676952,4,B000JLTR9K,"The movie opens with a man (Reed Diamond) who had something horrible happen to him, he just doesn't know what, he cannot remember his name nor his past.  After being a tester for a new drug, he starts having horrible visions of a mud-like monster.  He meets a kid name Stanley, and they both become friends.  The rest of the movie is about the man's, played by Reed Diamond, journey to recover his lost memories, and Stanley's quest to find out what his father is up too.

Lucy Lawless --everyones favorite warrior princess/Cylon -- plays the alcoholic mother, a victim of abuse, which is quite a different role than we are used to seeing from Lawless; she does it well.  Greg Grunberg --Alias's Eric Weiss, and Heroes Matt Parkman, also plays a very good, and different role than he has played in the past.  In this movie he is the sadistic husband of Lucy Lawless. The acting is great, the plot isn't the most original, nor all that scary, but is entertaining, and stays interesting throughout its length.

This is a straight to DVD release. As such it doesn't have that high of a budget,  you should not be expecting a masterpiece, but this movie does deliver quite a bit. I'm giving this four stars because the actor's performances are great and the concept is intriguing.  Fans of Lucy Lawless and Greg Grunberg should have no problems nor regrets buying this DVD.

I don't want to give to much away, but if you enjoyed films like ""The Jacket"", ""The Butterfly Effect"" or the directors other movie ""Room 6"" you should pick this up.",1168732800,11,1535,4.589743589743589
2676953,4,B000JLTR9K,"THE DARK ROOM is a stylish, brooding little thriller that is original and well performed.  Even though the movie has a large gaping plot hole (e.g., how could someone at age 15 disappear and apparently no one searched for him?), it maintains its interest and has a surprising, although predictable, finish.

Reed Diamond stars as a man who has been institutionalized for 15 years and has no memory of his life up to that point.  He is given a new experimental drug which apparently doesn't work so he escapes, desperate to find his identity.

He befriends a 15 year old boy named Stanley (Shawn Pyfrom) who lives with his mother (an unrecognizable Lucy Lawless) and her brutish husband (Greg Grunberg), who is the boy's stepfather.  Grunberg seems to be a camera nut, very protective of his dark room.  Stanley enlists Diamond's help in finding out where his stepfather goes at night.

The film has an eerie atmosphere and Diamond and Pyfrom are quite good.  There is a frightening monster presence, and overall, THE DARK ROOM is refreshingly different in today's cookie cutter horror films.",1168041600,4,1091,4.891304347826087

The methods they use are very brutal and deadly.

It seems the siblings were terrorized and tortured as children by their schizophrenic mother in the name of the Lord, which are recounted in flashbacks. The cast was well balanced and the acting quite good. (Kaylee DeFer) as Michelle being the main focus.

The reason she is being punished  is because she was driving drunk and her boyfriend and 2 other people were killed as the result. I found it to he engaging enough but it lacked some depth and logic, which I usually don't mind but this had the makings of a really good film. The gore was about a 4 on a scale of 1-10 but at least what they did have was done Decently. There are some scenes of torture that include a power drill and box cutter.

I felt more for the siblings once you see what their mother did to them to mess them up so bad. So, this is up to you to decide.

2677058,3,B000JLTR9K,"Man, this is a ""could've been"" movie. As in it could've been really good, but just didn't quite hit the mark. I really wanted to like this movie a lot, but it just fell short too often, too many times. I'd really give this film a 2.5 star rating if I could, cause it doesn't really merit a full 3, nor does it merit just a 2. Either way, I'll round up because frankly, the acting for the most part, was really good. I felt that Kaylee Defer did a fantastic job of playing the role. The others did good as well. Some of the lesser characters could have been better, but they played such a small part, I don't feel that brought the movie down a bit. The real problem with this movie lies in it's editing. It's continuously cuts back and forth from different time frames and personally, got pretty confusing at times to follow. One second Bonnie (Kaylee Defer) is in a medical treatment facility, the next she's in a bar, then the next she's a model in some old asylum. See what I mean? It never really transitions, just goes from one scene to the next without cause or explanation.

The movies begins with Bonnie sitting in a counseling session, in what appears to be a mental facility. Apparently she was the cause of some sort of accident that lead to the (assumed) death of some of her friends. I thought it was understood that she was supposed to be intoxicated but during the flashback (that appears almost towards the END of the movie) she seems just fine? Anyways, she's working on her problems and eventually gets released. During this time the scenes flash from her time in counseling and sometime in the near future at her new job.

Upon release, her counselor, Rachel (Elisabeth R&ouml;hm) recommends she take a job at a local asylum(?). I put a question mark there because I'm still not sure exactly what the job was SUPPOSED to be, but she ends up replacing a model that a photographer had lined up. Maybe she was supposed to be the assistant? This is one of those places in the movie that was sort of blurred for me. Either way, she agrees and eventually finds herself locked in a small chamber. It's a tight fit with only a small tube-style television (that has metal bolted around the edges - maybe to keep her from turning the channel, or turning it off completely?) and a metal chair. She realizes as a ""home"" video plays that she is not there to work, but to be purged of her so-called ""sins"". This pretty much sums up the movie.

She begins being antagonized by the 3 siblings that live there. I'm not going to give anything else away, but they have all had THEIR sins purged as children by their psychotic mother.

Bonnie discovers a way out and that's where the movie FINALLY becomes somewhat interesting. Only problem is,...it's about 2/3 of the way through the film.

All in all, as I said before the movie itself could have been really good. It has some ""hostal"" potential, albeit VERY little, but enough that it could have been pretty entertaining. If you've got time and you're in the very specific mood of watching a ""horror/thriller"" that isn't so adrenaline pumping,..this is your movie.

2677060,2,B000JLTR9K,"Michelle (Kaylee DeFer) was the impaired driver of a car that killed three people. She is at a rehab hospital run by Rachel (Elisabeth R&ouml;hm). Michelle wants to move on with her life, while Rachel believes she needs to deal with her issues and purge her sins. Rachel sets Michelle up with a job at the ""Darkroom"" run by Larry (Christian Campbell) who we later find out is her son. As it turns out Michelle gets imprisoned in a room with a breakable wooden chair, pictures of herself in a bra, and an analog TV with bad home movies. As we all know, psychotic Christians like to use power tools to cleanse people of their sins. Spare the power drill, spoil the child.

The film is light on originality and decent dialog. ""Who's a naughty girl?"" is a question you ask during a playful spanking, not an amateur appendix operation. Much of the film is told with flashbacks. If you are waiting for ""Hostel 4"" or ""Saw 7"" you might want an appetizer.

2677076,1,B000JLTR9K,"The Darkroom begins as a monster movie, segues into an Identity-like psychological thriller, and then strives to become the next Sixth Sense.

It begins with a suspected murder (Reed Diamond) who's given an experimental drug...but never you mind that, because he flees the hospital and runs into a completely different movie. There, he inexplicably befriends Stanley (Shawn Pyfrom) who gloms onto him with a devotion that can only be described as puppy-like.  Stanley decides that The Man is his ticket out of his hellhole life, which includes being robbed by bullies and threatened by his stepfather Bob (Greg Grunberg, recently of Heroes).  Mysteries abound in Stanley's life.  What is the slimy thing killing all the transients?  What is in Bob's darkroom?  And what was up with that experimental drug?

Like so many of these movies that want to have their horror cake and eat it too, The Darkroom substitutes flashbacks of disturbing scenes for dramatic narrative.  The acting is atrocious - Pyfrom isn't very good, Diamond is a walking zombie, Grunberg is an over-the-top jerk, and Lucy Lawless has nothing to do as Stanley's mom except lounge around in lingerie.  Which is really the only highlight.

The mystery, if you can call it that, deepens as Stanley and The Man decide to follow Bob to work.  It turns out Bob hasn't been going to work for weeks, but he does go somewhere and it involves a camera.  Three guesses as to who the slime monster is and what's in the darkroom and the first two don't count.

And that's the thing - as a mystery, The Darkroom fails because the flashbacks give it away.  As a psychological thriller, The Darkroom resorts to cheap thrills of torture and nudity. The Darkroom's monster looks ridiculous. And the pat explanation for who The Man really is simply isn't airtight or interesting enough to warrant another viewing.

In short, we know what's precisely in The Darkroom: a scattered mess of blurry shots, flashbacks, drippy monsters, bad special effects, and wooden acting, all topped with a lame plot twist. It's best if we keep the lights off next time.",1297814400,,2101,4.895480225988701

2677078,4,B000JLTR9K,"The Darkroom is one of those movies that's honestly really *really* bad in every conceivable way, but for some really mysterious reason... I can't bring myself to criticize it because on some unexplainably deep personal level, I actually enjoyed it.

First of all, the acting.  It's horrendous.  Actually what makes the acting so terrible is the way each of the main characters delivers his or her line.  After delivering it, there's an odd moment of noticeable silence.  This probably has less to do with the actual acting itself and more of an inexperience level on the part of the writers for not realizing when to trim the fat, so to speak, so as a result some segments linger longer than they honestly should.

A good example is right in the very beginning when the teenage boy is talking to a guy in a diner who just escaped from an asylum.  In addition to these scenes carrying on longer than necessary, what's most awkward about them is the way you hear silence after every line.  Almost like you're hearing the wind blow in the background.  It gives the entire movie a low budget feel.

The storyline actually isn't terrible, and has potential (and even achieves its potential in a few spots).  It's fairly well-written and, though entirely cheesy, isn't without its moments.  The writers were at least trying for something here.

You better believe the actual ""scary monster"" is nothing more than a pitiful attempt and scaring the viewers by having some guy dress in a costume and making the camera jerk around in dizzy fashion in order to give off some fears.  This is hilarious.

What won me over (actually I mean, what makes me feel guilty about winning me over) is the actual ""dark room"" itself.  The teenage boys stepdad has a dark secret, and that secret is revealed inside of this room.  There actually was a nice bit of atmosphere building up to the mystery of what's located inside the room between the supposed ""evil"" stepdad, the eager-to-discover teenage boy, and the drunk mother.  Every time the boy wanted to find out what's inside, something would prevent him from doing so.  I enjoyed these segments.

By the way, how hilarious is it that the teenage boy kept claiming his stepfather was a jerk, only to have him be nothing but!  He actually came across as extremely polite and considerate, trying to help his family the best way he can.  FAR from being a jerk of any sorts.

However, the film completely misses the mark in being truly terrifying.  No, that bigfoot-like ""bad guy"" creature running around town in a costume is definitely NOT scary, haha.

Overall, yes, it's amazingly corny, but it actually is worth watching on some level of desperation, lol.",1286841600,,2686,4.737068965517241

The truth is I really liked this flick It has everything that I really enjoy. The main thing is the fact that there were no cheesy effects and they got aot on names to be in the flick that helped the movie and I likes seeing the cop from Heroes play a villain. Now the only drawback is the surprise ending let's face it we live in the era of flicks like the Sixth Sense and Fight Club where we see the shocking twist and when it is not built up we can see it from a mile away. they made one mistake that gave it away but if you're not looking at it as a critic you may miss it. Besides that it was a really good flick and I enjoyed it.

There are also some good features on the DVD for example the making of Featurette that does contain spoilers but they do give you a disclaimer before the DVD starts as well as some deleted scenes that made me wonder why they were cut from the film but they may have hurt the flow of he script.

I have to also mention that this flick was produced by Mind fire Entertainment that I am going to have to give a call about a job when I go out to LA this year.

2677082,5,B000JLTR9K,"When the movie stated, I thought ok, this is going to be a good movie. As it went on, I started to see ""the creature from the black lagoon"" image. I just rolled my eyes and went ""oh boy"". I continued to watch the movie ""just for kicks"" and was very pleasantly suprised when it ended with the ending. I started to think about the movie after seeing it and thought, ""wow, that was a good movie"". It was very well acted and the story was a unique one. What I do like to see in movies that are being made is the stories ""a little different"" from the rest of them. Yes, the movie is a little like the Sixth Sense but is just different enough to put an exciting twist to things. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that likes a ""little twisted plot"" to movies.",1179792000,3,758,4.093959731543624

8151973,4,B000JLTR9K,"This has a plot, acting and production values well above most Prime included horror films. Religious fanatics demented by their psycho mother lure wayward girls from their rehab to a secluded mansion to torture and kill them in the name of their sick idea of godly cleansing of sin. One tough and resourceful girl uses her cleverness to fight, she is very believable in the role. She refuses to be their victim despite the horrors she sees them commit and the hopeless situation she is lured into. lots of tension and be warned, there is some gore and a touch of torture porn.

If you like Saw type movies you will probably like this. I did.",1465257600,3,641,4.525862068965517
