6259417,5,B00ID9PZJ6,"Have been collecting all my favorite movies for about 24 years now and this one has always been on my list of the most memorable films I watched as a child. I've kept an eye out for it forever and was thinking I'd never get to see it again. Just ridiculously happy to finally own my own copy. I used to have Unico stickers and Unico school folders. When it came in the mail I sat down with my nieces to watch it, and was surprised at how much of it I remembered. The west wind racing the night across the sky... so very awesome! Loved it then, thrilled now to be able to revisit with all these characters. Thank you, Thank you!!!",1407369600,8,629,4.121951219512195
6259418,5,B00ID9PZJ6,Now they have to add the very first Unico movie to this set - Black Cloud White Feather which I vaguely remember as the first one I had seen or Kuroi Kumo Shiroi Hane and it would be neat to have the Saving Our Fragile Earth short on it also!,1477699200,,242,3.86

6259420,5,B00ID9PZJ6,"Great quality video. Better than the VHS quality that I used to rent when I was a child. I had never seen the second video before.

6259423,5,B00ID9PZJ6,"It's been almost 30 years since I watched unico. I find it a mystical, magical adventure; the brave unicorn has upset the gods and he must travel to distant lands, helping people. Visually stunning and absolutely mesmerising. If you can't get into this, you have no emotions",1459468800,5,274,4.851063829787234

6259426,5,B00ID9PZJ6,"I love the transaction from the seller. This movie is terrible.  I bought it because I love animation and I love digging to find forgotten gems.  I would not include this in the forgotten gem category.  If you grew up with Unico, and you love it because it's part of your childhood I mean no offense.  But, if you are an animation fan looking for new stuff I would pass on this.",1449532800,,378,4.208333333333333
6259427,5,B00ID9PZJ6,"I saw the first Unico movie when i was a kid and had no idea what the name of it was. I happened to see this on here and got lucky finding it. Its a good fantasy anime, i liked it.",1445299200,,180,3.4146341463414633
