895855,5,6304508441,"Matthau and Lemon in an underated Billy Wilder film from the mid sixties. Once again Wilder and Diamond put a regular fella in a morally compromising position. Jack Lemmon, a divorced television camera man is involved in an accident with a football player, then is coereced by his low life brother in law, Walter Matthau, into pretending he is paralyzed from the impact and a law suite is put into motion. It is a funny and touching story, wonderfully directed and watching Lemmon and Matthau is always a double treat.",1110758400,7,518,4.766666666666667
895856,4,6304508441,"""The Fortune Cookie"" has long been one of my favorite Billy Wilder movies, and I was pleased to see it's release on DVD, especially in the original widescreen format.  While the movie and performances are great (especially Walter Matthau in his Oscar-winning turn), and the script by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond hits the target, I was very disappointed in the lackluster transfer to disc that this unqualified classic received. Sure, the letterboxing is great, but halfway through the film, the sound quality takes a turn for the worse - less audible, and almost scratchy at times. Plus, the only ""extra"" is the original trailer, and there is no additional booklet. Surely a genius like Wilder deserves better preservation than this!",1018828800,25,731,5.091666666666667
895857,3,6304508441,"Many people have pondered why this movie falls into the comedy genre of film . . . when in fact that it is a comedy.  Their is a definite chemistry between Lemmon and Mathau (arguably not as strong as in their later films) that makes the entire movie run smoothly.  My only complaint is that the movie does seem to drag a bit in the later stages of the film.
I personally found the ""handicapped"" antics of Lemmon to be quite entertaining - especially the high speed wheelchair action of someone who is obviously not handicapped.  Additionally, the change of character displayed whenever his wife is tenderly mentioned is classic and real.
Mathau, although perhaps not Oscar material, plays the blood-sucking lawyer better than perhaps any performance I can think of.  His usual grumpy, greedy self is perfectly kept intact in this role.  In fact, his performance is so good that it makes you wonder if it is an act at all.  And judging from Mathau's other films, I don't think it is.
As far as greed is concerned, there are two types of characters in the film.  Those after money and those who are honest.  And the ones who are honest are the happy characters and the characters who turn out all right in the end.  It perfectly follows the format of films made during this era - good moral lessons.
All in all, Fortune Cookie is a delightful film that will entertain you.  Watch it if you enjoy the chemistry between these two wonderful actors.",970358400,10,1444,4.583657587548638
895858,2,6304508441,"How exactly this film is billed as a comedy is beyond me. I can't remember laughing at this movie. I guess it's a comedy-of manners, but really lacks  wit. I'm suprised to even say that this is a Billy Wilder film. How could  the man who made such classics as ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""Some  Like It Hot"" , and ""Double Indemnity"" have actually made  this movie! A very weak and unfunny screenplay by I.A.L Diamond and Wilder  himself. If it weren't for the fact that there are two star performances by  Lemmon and Matthau, and fine supporting players like Judi West and Ron  Rich, I might consider giving this one star. The story goes something like  this, Harry Hinkle (Lemmon) is a camera man who just happens to be in the  wrong place at the wrong time, see he collides with football star Luther  ""Boom Boom"" Jackson (Rich). Hinkle's brother-in-law, Willie  Gingrich (Matthau) seeks the perfect opportunity to try and pull off a  insurance scam. Hinkle of course at first is totally against the whole  idea. But when he's ex-wife calls, Sandy (West), to check if her ex is ok,  Harry starts to think, maybe he could win his wife back. All of this seems  like a pretty good idea. You would think that perhaps some laughs could  come out of this. But Wilder and Diamond have something else up their  sleeve. They both completely avoided the comedy and seemed to try to give  the movie more ""heart"". It seems like they wanted to make a drama  more than a comedy. Which is fine with me. Only I was expecting a comedy.  The story really seems to drag, why Wilder felt the movie had to be a  little over two hours long I'll never understand. He could of made the same  bad movie in 90 minutes. The movie was nominated for 4 Oscars, why I don't  know. And was awarded only one, which went to Matthau, for best supporting  actor. One of Wilder's weeker films, and one everyone should stay away  from. ** 1\2 out of *****",967939200,9,1910,4.4508670520231215

The movie  title refers to a message in a fortune cookie (You can fool all the people  some of the time......).
Although not at the level of ""Some Like  It Hot"", this is one of Billy Wilder's best comedies. His view of  humanity is certainly cynical and bleak, but not nihilistic.

Matthau plays an unscrupulous lawyer who, upon seeing his professional football player brother being hit during a game, talks said brother into exaggerating his minor injuries whereupon he could sue and they would split the money.  A bunch of complications ensue, including the player's ex-wife coming back into his life.

The movie is clever for the most part, and Matthau gives a wonderful performance as the lawyer, but the movie has serious flaws.  For one, it is too long; a half-hour could have been easily cut from it.  For another, the player's mother comes in and keeps yelling and weeping all the time; it was funny for two minutes and irritating long after that.  Besides that, the black football player feels guilty about what he supposedly did and acts as a manservant to the other player.  If this was supposed to be a statement on race relations, I failed to get the point.

He is not injured severely, but enter his brother-in-law Willie Gingrich (Walter Matthau), a slick, shady lawyer, who convinces Harry to pretend to be seriously injured and unable to walk.  Convincing Harry that the only way to win his estranged wife back is with money, Willie files a large lawsuit against the football team.  The pair hole up in Harry's apartment but soon become aware that they are under constant surveillance by two inept goons hired by the insurance company that will have to pay the lawsuit.

Matthau is at his best as the wise-cracking, crass counselor who must keep Harry's conscience from spoiling the ruse.  What neither Harry nor Willie count on is the football player Luther ""Boom-boom"" Jackson (Rich) who hit Harry is tormented by guilt and risks his career to help wheelchair-bound Harry.  When his wife shows up, Harry realizes what money can and cannot buy, and must finally come to terms with right and wrong.

896080,4,6304508441,"""The Fortune Cookie"" is full of laughs with the great duo of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon.  It is a cynical comedy showing human nature and how money can corrupt.  TV-cameraman Harry Hinkle (Lemmon) is covering a football game when Boom Boom Jackson (Ron Rich) a football player trying to make an extra 5 yards runs over him on the sidelines.  Willie Gingrich (Matthau) his brother-in-law is a ambulance-chasing attorney who sees a chance for a major settlement.  He pleads with Harry to exaggerate the extent of his injury and then sues the football team, the network and the stadium for a vast amount of money.  Meanwhile  Boom Boom feels guilty he has injured a man so badly, and suspends his career to care for Willie.  Willie calls in Harry's ex-wife when Harry starts to waffle on carrying the scheme forward.  Harry's ex wife (Judi West) is an aspiring singer whose renewed compassion for Willie, seems to be enhanced by the thought of money.  Harry and Willie also realize they are being followed and taped by detectives hired by the insurance company.  They rent an apartment across the street to follow every move.  Soon Harry tires of the deception, he becomes guilt-ridden for exploiting the innocent football player.  He is also disgusted with the ease his ex can be bribed to get money for a vain self-centered singing career.  Willie, however, won't have this!  He has no intention of seeing his part of a huge settlement disappear.l

WW is an attorney.  He seems like a terrible one at first but when he breaks into his arguments, he is rather convincing.  He also will do ANYTHING to win the case.

Lemmon, meanwhile, more the straight man in this film, starts having serious second thoughts because the football player who hit him is taking it badly.  But getting back the ex-wife seriously clouds his judgment.  This is a great pairing of Matthau and Lemmon, who always shine under Wilder's direction.

Billy Wilder, one of the best filmmakers in the world, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, one of the best movie comic teams ever, produce a fun and thoughtful movie.  Matthau wins an Oscar for this role, making it worth seeing for that reason alone.  Lemmon plays the good guy being tempted to perfection.  Alternating between greed and fear, he and Matthau play off one another to perfection.  The story is tight and true, playing on a get rich quick wish that is common to humanity.

I was aware of the storyline and I knew that Lemmon and Matthau would make quite a team and I was right.  The ""Odd Couple"" personalities are in view and the writing is excellent with Billy Wilder replacing Neil Simon.  However, I kept getting the sense that this movie is too long.  There are some side stories that could be diminished or even eliminated.  I'm not talking about the ""Boom Boom"" Jackson character.  Rather, there seemed to be a lot of redundencies throughout the movie.  The private eye gets too much coverage as does the insurance company representatives.  The ex-wife is a nice twist to the plot but we got the idea early and didn't need such an extensive development of the renewed relationship.  There are other examples as well but I think I may be emphasizing this too much.

The end was not as I had expected although not greatly off the mark.  However, the movie is not centered around the plot so much as it is around the interaction between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon.  Matthau won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his preformance in what would appear to have been a leading role.  I have no problem with that (although I really was impressed that year with Mako in ""The Sand Pebbles"").
