7848570,4,6303465838,I thought it was a good movie for its time. Justine Bateman was very impressive. A little predictable at times but suspenseful non the less.,1454889600,,140,4.64

The protagonist is a young medical student ,Marti ,winningly played by Justine Bateman .She has recently divorced the up and coming hot shot lawyer ,Jordan ,and is struggling to make ends meet while pursuing her studies .She agrees to take in a room-mate ,an  outwardly charming young man but in reality a person with multiple problems .His idea of a realtionship with a woman is to exercise total  control and he sets out to win Marti over and then to take over her life completely .He does not scruple to kill in pursuit of his desires and by the time she realises what she is dealing with Marti is a prisoner in her own apartment and totally dependent on her gaoler

Within its modest limits this is a serviceable picture and while it does not come anywhere near to being among the best of its type there are many worse ways to spend 90 minutes or so being decently acted and well paced",1125619200,,1024,4.459893048128342
7848572,3,6303465838,"Only giving this movie 3 stars, since there are too many ""hidden"" scenes. It's funny how all of a sudden a soundproff room appears out of the blue, and her furniture just vanishes. Despite all of that, some scenes were hair-raising. Could be a good companion to ""Single White Female"".",1102464000,2,284,4.7
