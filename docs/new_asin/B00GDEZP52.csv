6073227,1,B00GDEZP52,"the movie itself was ok, after I watched it in its entirety on Youtube because the Bluray was only formatted for the UK. NOT MENTIONED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION.",1405382400,5,162,4.620689655172414
6073228,5,B00GDEZP52,"""I Am Soldier"" needs to be watched more than once to fully appreciate the intensity. It perfectly captures the exploits of recruits to the S.A.S.  The acting is excellent. The camera work and soundtrack pull you into the film, but it is over way too soon. The training and fighting scenes are choreographed in an underrated way, making it more like 'real life'; especially the final one to one fighting scenes. It really captures the men fighting for their lives; it gets messy, no Hollywood here!
I can definitely recommend this film!",1396310400,31,535,4.815217391304348
6073229,2,B00GDEZP52,"OK Brit movie, distracting enough, a little grim and brutal as the subject matter would suggest.  Comes across more like a TV drama rather than a movie",1467763200,,151,4.592592592592593

6073235,3,B00GDEZP52,"most of it was little better than ok. Could have had a better lead. But the action scene was awful. They all became first time rookies. Day light? Black uniforms, you got a gun and can shoot a guy in the head at a distances and you jump on him while he blows up a vest bomb? You have a pistol and a knife and a guy twice your size comes at you with no bomb and you fight him? Fair? Who did these guys turn into?

6073240,2,B00GDEZP52,"Good story idea and at first blush an attractive lead. One would expect a torso of a Ninja to accomplish all that the training of the British Special Forces soldiers went through. But alas, without a shirt this slender guy looked as if he never exercised a day in his life. This lack made the film a bit laughable.",1466467200,,314,4.338983050847458
6073241,3,B00GDEZP52,"Story line was solid in the selection process, with a trooper who has a debilitating secret. But I feel like they pass over the mandatory training and all that for the latter part of the movie.

6073252,2,B00GDEZP52,Pretty cheesy if you are a fan of military movies. I did not even finished the movie because the cheese got worse and worse. It has these weird cut and black out scenes too. And the actors they chose to be the SAS look like little weak 100 pound boys. Its just cheesy.,1465862400,,268,4.0754716981132075

6073254,2,B00GDEZP52,More like a commercial for the SAS. If passing time it on a treadmill it is acceptable. Informative and certainly you come away with respect for the SAS. However I would have been upset if I had paid to watch it.,1465776000,,212,4.195121951219512

6073264,3,B00GDEZP52,"Very intense.  Kind of drawn out and a little choppy with the editing.  Tries to explore the intense training for the British Special Forces, more of a documentary of step by step program, but seems not as engageing as when watching ""Full Metal Jacket"", where I felt more for the soldiers going through their training.  But not bad.",1465084800,,332,4.689655172413793

6073282,2,B00GDEZP52,"A very run-of-the-mill military thriller loosely based on the selection, training, and real-world missions of the (UK) Royal Army's Special Air Service (SAS), one of the world's premier special operations units. It tries to be a docudrama, but the plot is thin and the characters are shallow. The section on the SAS's equivalent to Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) training also drags on far too long. If you are interested in the SAS, the film adaptation of Andy McNabb's Bravo Two Zero, the 1983 film The Final Option (both available on Amazon Instant Video), or various documentaries are a better use of your time and will give you a better sense for what the SAS is all about.",1463961600,,696,4.857142857142857

6073287,1,B00GDEZP52,Silly training film.  The token action scene at the end is ridiculous. It's like they wrote the script while they were filming it.,1463702400,,130,4.6521739130434785

6073294,4,B00GDEZP52,"Overall, it was a great insight into the British special forces, the Special Air Service (on which the USA's Seals and Delta Force are based), training process. It was a little hard to buy the blatant uniforms they wore in the raid at the end as they weren't camouflaged at all, but maybe that is representative of what they actually wear.",1463270400,,339,4.573770491803279

6073462,2,B00GDEZP52,"The film begins with what seems like promise.  The actors don't appear to be the typical Hollywood mannequins, and that alone was promising, i.e., Perhaps Ive stumbled upon one of those rare hidden gems that one discovers whilst dipping a toe into the low-rent Sea of Foreign Flicks.

Hope dies quickly though as we follow lead character Mickeys attempt to successfully complete the elite British Special Air Service (SAS) basic training (More on that later).  While Mickey is slogging through the program he must battle some rather ambiguous inner demons left over from his previous occupation as a paratrooper.

Now, as I watched this plot laboriously unfold I couldn't help thinking, This training doesnt really appear to be all that tough.  I realize times have change and todays kids are more pampered, but it wasn't THAT long ago that I went through 16 weeks of Marine Corps boot camp and Navy Seal training is even tougher yet.  By comparison Mickeys little odtssey looks pretty tame.

Henceforth, ambiguity reigns in every facet of the film, be it from highly implausible chance meetings to a sorta-kinda romantic trip to nowhere to Mickeys first mission (with his new elite comrades who, despite all of that training prove to be terrible marksmen) who toss their automatic weapons just as soon as the shamelessly cliched bad guys show the least proclivity for hand-to-hand combat.  Oh well... Its not as if they could actually HIT anything with em.

This film actually had decent audience reviews at 3+ stars.  I think it couldve been much better with a different editor and had the director sprung for a military consultant.  But shooting from the hip, not taking cover while under fire, M-16s sounding like Winchesters, hot babes in elite combat units... Cmon.

I confess I am disappointed that for the majority (75%) of the time, all we saw was running, running, and then, finally....some more running.  I know training involves physical training, but that is what one would expect of any unit or other classifications, as necessary.  I wanted to like this film, but there were so many flat moments, when if they weren't running, they were sleeping with PTSD-esque nightmares tossed in for good measure. The whole sequence of emotional material just wasn't explained very well. I think maybe the writers should drink more coffee.  They seem to have dropped the ball in scope of what people would probably watch and what the general public often has no interest in exploring.  You have to have the action be accurate, or dump it.  Seemed there was so much going on to try and fit action to storyline, and IMHO, that's where the fan and the s**** met.  All in all, it was just ok;  Neither really good, but certainly entertaining the notion of being a total loss.  Interesting little bits of reactive response info, wrapped up in downgraded cammo.

6073620,4,B00GDEZP52,"This was the tale of two movies.  The selection process was excellent - not too overblown or overdone.  The last 20 minutes or so was an 'op' that seemed sensationally cheesy and bizarre.  It really seemed like they made 80% of the movie and then just flat out ran out of money.  The first 2/3s of the movie was 5 stars.  The last bit, 1 1/2 stars.  It's not the change in subject matter, it's simply crazily different in pacing/tone/production.

Anyhow, very much worth watching for the selection process.",1446854400,,506,4.617977528089888

I don't know if there are any women in SAS though if there were by now it wouldn't surprise me.  From what I remember of this movie it seems to have left out the ""yump"" that everyone in the training must complete.  If the part where three-man teams must complete a timed march w/checkpoints is it then it's in there, but I doubt it.  Oh, well.",1444176000,,639,4.239669421487603

6073860,2,B00GDEZP52,"While it may or may not be accurate in the training of these special forces, the plot was weak. However, the acting seemed realistic, save for the romance of an officer with a private (while that likely occurs from time to time, it is not necessary in what the storyline should be). It was also a bit melodramatic in how the lead character had dreams. The movie could have focused more on the work those forces perform and not as much on the training. The mission which the new members of the team encountered was somewhat clumsy in its writing. The movie broke down in that portrayal. While some terrorism of that fashion may exist and these special forces may also take part in infiltrating and defeating them, the actual undercover work would likely be done by someone in the spy business, and the actual assault would be less melodramatic. I felt the last 15 min were an afterthought to the first 75 min.
For those wishing to see how special forces are trained, there are many other films and documentaries on that subject which (IMHO) seem to be more believable. The people in the special forces need to remain an enigma, of sorts. If you remember Black Hawk Down, the US Navy Seals were involved in rescuing the many who were involved in that crash. There are obviously many opportunities for special forces to do their jobs in today's crazy world. It is difficult to imagine being a part of any of those teams as they are constantly endangered when in action, and likely lead abnormal lives at home. They are important in saving lives of innocents and offer support to others in all branches of any military.
Let's hope other films do a better job in the future of portraying the actual work of these teams without giving away the store, so to speak. Their work is less melodramatic than a film would like to portray and it would be difficult to sell tickets and make money. This film began with a great story on the training of the volunteers and seemed very realistic, but it fell flat on its face when the romance and clumsily-written mission appeared.",1442361600,,2062,4.575675675675676

6073972,3,B00GDEZP52,"The movie did not move me, nor surprise me. I am not of the military. Originally I thought it would be a joke of a film because I could not, and can not, see any secretly trained force giving up any real trade secrets within training or otherwise - thus the SECRET part. As it stands, I don't personally know anyone that would be capable of doing that job as depicted. I have known and otherwise met plenty of armed forces people, both active, and retired, as well as discharged for various reasons - usually physically broken - reasons.
I can imagine the real thing being much worse than was depicted here. Elite condition means just that so I doubt one could find an Iron Man or MMA contender that would be able to perform at that extreme level.
The fighting and the weapons handling seemed a bit rough and when guns were up and no one was in staggered formation I laughed out loud. It seemed obvious to this complete novice that a mistake would have left half of the team shot by their own.
The black out parts of the movie were annoyingly too long and by the third one I thought Amazon streaming was doing it's thing again - sadly those are part of the film.
I liked the movie over all - it was a good bash about - but the smart ass sneer that the main character had on his face far to often, drove me to wishing someone would punch him in it just a bit more. I do get the elite part but I was glad to see him get pushed.",1440028800,2,1425,4.129496402877698
6073973,1,B00GDEZP52,"To anyone who has actually served in any type of elite unit or infantry, etcetera, this just came across as ""forced"". The acting was pretty poor, the SAS candidates and instructors were very stereotypical, special effects were not very realistic, proper tactics and techniques (even for basic infantry types) were rarely displayed, etcetera.

One had the feeling that it was a considerably low budget film. I know those types of films can occasionally be quite good... but not in this case.

As the action scenes in this movie were fairly poor and neither that realistic OR super exciting ""gun fu"" (ala ""John Wick""), nor that accurate a portrayal of SAS selection / training, I am both amazed and unsure as to why it has the number of shown  high ratings. I noted that currently on Amazon at this time it has an overall 3-star rating with only 58 reviews - not counting this one (very small number for a movie on Amazon) and the combination of 1,2, and 3-stars were 53% of that total.

I would neither watch again or recommend.

(I have, years past, personally gone through advanced tactical training courses of a comprehensive nature were the instructors were SAS or, in 2 cases, an individual who was - at that time -  recently former SAS... and who had been on the entry teams at Operation Princess Gate and served in the Falklands War. As a result, combined with my own military experience in the Marines, had a special interest in Spec Ops overall and Spec Ops units, especially that of the SAS amongst others and of sorting the BS from the reality.... That said, I understand that movies can dramatize the reality for purely entertainment same and enjoyment - I too enjoy a good ""action flick"".

Some of the  lines were there to develop drama, as when the three characters are racing against the clock.  Other of the lines were just pure propaganda announcements telling how ""rough"" the SAS was.  This distracted from the overall flow of the plot.
Speaking of the plot, why was MIckey introduced as a ""chef:?  It is difficult to see how his civilian occupation added to or subtracted from the overall movie.  Why even bring it up, except to show that he was not the typical candidate for the SAS??  But then, who cares?

The shot-out at the end was more of an amateur production  than most.  If automatic weapons were being fired in close quarters, there would be chips and splinters flying around everywhere.  The Opposition would not be standing  out in the open without being cut down.  Then, it devolved (devolved is a Brit word!) into three personal combats:  Mickey, the black SAS leader and the woman SAS.  If I wanted staged conflicts, I would have watched WWF.

6074002,2,B00GDEZP52,"Merely OK.  The attempt at intensity just missed.  The blackouts between scenes got old very quickly.  The botched romance between an officer and a non com was ridiculous.  I think it has something to do with fraternizaton with the enlisted peons.

Actually, you can't make me believe that the Special Air Service has woman officers for the same reason that there are no female linebackers in the National Football League.  SORRY but it is the truth.

Finally, the people making this movie have absolutely zero knowledge of fire arms.  I can't be totally sure, because the S.A.S. has been known to use weapons not made in the U.K. like the H&K mp5, but I am pretty sure they Don't use American made m16s.  Likewise the firearms handling was horrible.  I cringed throughout the action scenes when the most ""elite"" armed force in the world was shown as a bunch of idiots constantly pointing their weapons at each other.

So, it was merely OK.  A much more realistic (lol) treatment of the S.A.S. was the old 1980s movie THE FINAL OPTION.  Reportedly, some of the actors were shepherded through the first section or two of the S.A.S. training.  The action was much better.

6074006,5,B00GDEZP52,"Movie was not Hollywood fanfare.
It dealt with a gritty subject in a gritty fashion.

SAS are one of the best, and this film shows why.
I will stand by my own nation's operators as the best though, and that is not all just blind patriotism,
BUD/S might be more rigorous than SAS, but not a great deal.
Meanwhile for me personally, the thorough training one receives at SWCS and its attendant locales teaches you how to be the ultimate warrior and soldier.
The following words become part of you:
I am an American Special Forces Soldier!
I will do all that my nation requires of me.
I am a volunteer, knowing well the hazards of my profession.
I serve with the memory of those who have gone before me.
I pledge to uphold the honor and integrity of their legacy in all that I am - in all that I do.
I am a warrior. I will teach and fight whenever and wherever my nation requires.
I will strive always to excel in every art and artifice of war.
I know that I will be called upon to perform tasks in isolation, far from familiar faces and voices.
With the help and guidance of my faith, I will conquer my fears and succeed.
I will keep my mind and body clean, alert and strong.
I will maintain my arms and equipment in an immaculate state befitting a Special Forces Soldier, for this is my debt to those who depend upon me.
I will not fail those with whom I serve.
I will not bring shame upon myself or Special Forces.
I will never leave a fallen comrade.
I will never surrender though I am the last.
If I am taken, I pray that I have the strength to defy my enemy.
I am a member of my Nation's chosen soldiery.
I serve quietly, not seeking recognition or accolades.
My goal is to succeed in my mission - and live to succeed again.
De Oppresso Liber
And those are not just words in any fashion; they are a way of life.

""Who Dares Wins"" is the SAS motto.
Since this was not a Hollywood flick, it was only mentioned once and did not need to be said more.
It is imbued into the fabric of the film.

This movie will be a bit more cerebral than the normal Hollywood action flick junkie will like.
The action just has to be earned by the viewer; they have to understand at least a small part what it means to be just that special, to be SAS.

I'm sure a lot was left out but the scenes that are portrayed give a pretty good idea of the physical and psychological stresses that are part and parcel of military training. What has to be remembered is that the troops who are going through selection are already fully trained military personnel who come from all the services.
The last bit of the movie concerning the counter terror operation was a bit light on details and the combat sequence itself was unimpressive...almost amateurish and very disappointing visually. This movie could of easily gone on for another 45 minutes if the last half of the story was fleshed out a little more with the other characters, and the combat operation itself. The fighting scenes could of used some more realistic intensity in my opinion, although the hand to hand combat was intense enough.
