8351154,4,B0025O4Z5K,"Scarifice is one of the best showings from TNA wrestling in 2006 as it heavily revolved around the X division, and showcased some of the best wrestling that Total Non-Stop Action fans brag out.

Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger vs. Petey Williams - TNA brought back japanese legends Jushin Liger for this PPV & his match with the underrated Petey Williams didn't disappoint. You had some high flyin & some great mat wrestling that made this a great way to kick off the PPV. By the way, during the live PPV...the ending was cut off during a satellite feed problem but that's fixed here so the match is shown in full.

Raven vs. A1 - This match was kept pretty short & sweet since A1 is still very green in the ring.

Rhino vs. Bobby Roode - Just an average match between these two that was really nothing special or memorable.

Team 3D vs. James Gang - Out of all the confrontations between these teams, this one is my least favorite. It had some good parts like them trying to one-up each other even resulting in seeing things like a dropkick from Brother Ray & B.G. James (who never leave their feet). The ending was something to chuckle at if you remember the last time these two teams fought each other back in 2000 but overall, this was just to setup the Bingo Hall Brawl match for the next month.

NWA Tag Team Champions America's Most Wanted vs. AJ Styles & Christopher Daniels - Unlike most tag teams that are just two singles wrestlers thrown together for a few months, Daniels & Styles didn't do their usual singles highspots and finishers but put in the time to create a repertoire of tag team spots to making them look like a real unit. And we all know AMW is one of the best (if not THE BEST) tag team in wrestling at this time. This is a really great tag team match with a very unique ending to it giving the pre-match stipulation.

Gauntlet Match for the World X Cup: This is basically just like the match done at Victory Road '04 in which it's a mini Royal Rumble involving the normal TNA X division stars along with international talent like Liger & Tiger Mask. You see some spots but it gets crowded at times just like a battle royal so you can't keep up with all the action.

Sting & Samoa Joe vs. Jeff Jarrett & Scott Steiner - The main story here was if Samoa Joe can hang with the wrestlers outside of the X division & be concidered a legit main eventer and he proved himself during this match. Sting knows exactly what to do to get the crowd to go wild, Jarrett & Steiner were great as heels plus did a good tag team match. It didn't come close to the tag team title match but it was still a good showing from all four guys.

Full Metal Mayhem - NWA Champion Christian Cage vs. Abyss - This match is TNA's version of a TLC match. We all know Christian's past experience in TLC and Abyss is the master of hardcore type matches in TNA so this did not disappoint. Just like their Lockdown match, it wasn't full of the typical Abyss thumbtack spots & they dishes out the punishment as much as they took it. Again, just another great match.

Scarifice was one of the best PPV's TNA has put on this year and I highly recommend this DVD.",1256256000,,3142,4.302876480541455
