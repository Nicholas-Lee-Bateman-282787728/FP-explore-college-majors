399310,4,6301973178,"""Libeled Lady"" (1936) is a sparkling romantic comedy of errors. When committment shy newspaper editor, Warren Haggerty (Spencer Tracy) finds that his newspaper is being sued for alleging that a socialite, Connie Allenbury (Myrna Loy) is a home-wrecker he delays plans to marry his fiancee Gladys (Jean Harlow) yet again, by placing her in the midst of elegant playboy, Bill Chandler (William Powell). The idea is to have Gladys and Bill marry so that Connie will then be fooling around with a married man - hence Warren's paper will be off the hook for printing the initial story. But the plot goes hopelessly and predictably awry when Gladys starts to have genuine feelings for Bill and he for her. So what's a struggling foursome to do?

Director, Jack Conway fleshes out this thimble of a plot with a series of hilarious vignettes and some really stellar acting from the cheap seats, including cameos by Charles Grapewin, Arthur Connelly and Cora Witherspoon - all instantly recognizable war horses from MGM's ever expanding stable of second string talent. ""Libeled Lady"" may be light and fluffy, but it certainly packed a wallop at the box office.

Warner's DVD treatment is just a tad above middle of the road. The black and white image has been mastered from reasonably clean film elements. Contrast levels are adequate, though at times weak. There's a hint of edge enhancement and some fine detail shimmering, but nothing that will distract. Fine details are sometimes nicely realized. Film grain is kept to a bare minimum. Age related artifacts are present throughout. An audio only radio broadcast is the only extra included.",1109030400,6,1634,5.0036764705882355
399311,5,6301973178,"""Libeled Lady"" is one of Jack Conway's best films! This film shows you just what ""slap-stick"" comedies are. Myrna Loy & William Powell are especially delightful, but none-the-less, Spencer Tracy & Jean Harlow make their presence known. Tracy plays an editor who allows a story about Loy's character, claiming she is a homewrecker, to be published in his paper. After realizing a mistake has been made, he quickly tries to fix his error but things don't go as planned-instead he ends up with a five million dollar libel suit, that Loy's character is determined to see destroy Tracy's career & paper! Tracy then sets out to find Powell, an ex-employee, to help him straighten up the mess he's made. To make matters worse for Tracy, we find out his fiancee, played by Harlow, has decided she is tired of waiting around for him and gives him an ultimatum-marry her or they're finished. The story takes a lot of turns, all proving to be very amusing. This films shows us just how funny Tracy can be, proving what a terrific actor was. Jean Harlow is entertaining as Tracy's fiancee, full of sarcasm. This film must be added to your collection!",1104710400,,1138,4.723618090452261
399312,4,6301973178,"This film has a plot that is quite complicated to describe, although as the film progresses, it all makes sense.  Essentially, Myrna Loy is an heiress suing a newspaper for libel (five million dollar lawsuit), and Spencer Tracy defends his newspaper by using fiancee Jean Harlow and writer William Powell to prove that the story his paper originally printed about Loy was actually true.  Relationships then get very tangled as this comedy proceeds.  The plot is fun, and some of the dialogue humourous, but the real strength is its star package.  Jean Harlow gets some scenes where she cuts loose and shows the comedic range she possessed (might surprise you).  Spencer Tracy plays the driven newspaperman with a lot of energy and edge.  But it's really William Powell and Myrna Loy who own this film.  What chemistry the two had on camera!  Of course, they proved that in film after film, and this is a prime example.  Witty, sophisticated, sexy are just some of the words for the two on screen.  Powell in particular is in top form here, and as everyone notes about this film, his fishing scene is the highlight of the film. Star power is what this film is all about, with a complicated story and some good laughs thrown in for good measure.",1015632000,5,1243,4.686635944700461
399313,5,6301973178,"With a lesser cast, this might not have been the film it is.  The script, while good, is not conducive to making a great film.  In fact, if one stands back and thinks about the film as a whole, nothing really stands out in any way, except the cast.
This is a movie that is redeemed and made excellent by the actors themselves.  William Powell in particular shines in this one, along with the always-delightful Myrna Loy.  How many films did those two make together?  They were so intensely identified with one another that when Powell made THE SENATOR WAS INDISCREET and they needed a cameo stand in for his wife, Loy made uncredited appearance.  Spencer Tracy is his usual excellent self, and Jean Harlow, in one of the last films she made before her tragic death, is excellent as the much-misused fianc&eacute;/wife of Tracy and Powell.  Ironically, although many assumed that Powell and Loy were married to each other, Powell and Harlow had an affair, and were engaged to be married when she died of untreated uremic poisoning.  Walter Connolly, who adorned some of the finest film comedies of the 1930s, also excels as Myrna Loy's father.
All in all, not a great movie in itself, but a movie made great by several star performances.",1014422400,8,1236,4.689814814814815

399316,5,6301973178,"A libel suit, filed against a newspaper that knows it won't have a leg to stand on in court, triggers a chain of events that plays havoc with a number of relationships in ""Libeled Lady,"" a classic romantic comedy  directed by Jack Conway.  On his wedding day, newspaper editor Warren  Haggerty (Spencer Tracy) is summoned back to work before he ever reaches  the church; there's a crisis at hand, and he's responsible, albeit  indirectly.  In his absence, another editor allowed a libelous story to  make the front page; a story alleging a dalliance between a certain Connie  Allenbury (Myrna Loy), one of the richest women in the country, and a  married man.  When, at the last minute, the paper discovers the story is  false, the edition is recalled, but it's too late; fifty copies make it  into circulation, and Connie Allenbury sues the paper to the tune of five  million dollars.  If they can't convince her to drop the suit, the paper is  ruined.  That's a tall order, however, for the Allenbury's have a  long-running feud with the paper (twenty years), and Haggerty knows there's  only one way to deal with it:  They have to catch Connie Allenbury in a  compromising position.  It just so happens that a former employee of the  paper, Bill Chandler (William Powell), is an expert at handling such  matters.  According to Haggerty's plan, Chandler will court Miss Allenbury,  and when the time is right, his wife (along with a photographer) will catch  them in the act.  But first, the single Chandler needs a wife, and it has  to be a legal marriage that will hold up in court.  And Haggerty has just  the woman for the part:  Gladys (Jean Harlow), his own bride-to-be, still  smarting from being left alone at the altar.  He convinces her it will be  in name only for one month, after which time she will enjoy a six week  vacation in Reno (allowing for the divorce proceedings), and after that,  everything's jake.  When she agrees, knowing how much the paper means to  Haggerty, it begins a comedic interlude with a new twist arriving at every  turn.  The legendary Harlow is an absolute delight here, as the spunky  Gladys, the girl taken for granted for too long, and who enters the fray  determined to get what she really wants:  A loving husband.  Tracy is right  at home as the fast-talking newspaperman, married to the job and too  thick-headed to realize what a treasure he has in Gladys.  Loy is charming  as the sophisticated Connie, the guarded aristocrat with the down-to-earth  sense of who she really is, and Powell is marvelous, bringing a subtle,  self-deprecating sense of humor to the ever-gentlemanly Bill Chandler.  This is a funny movie, with some truly memorable scenes, especially one in  which Chandler first learns how to fish, then must put his newly acquired  ""skills"" to the test during a fishing trip with Connie and her father, Mr.  Allenbury (Walter Connolly), who is an expert fisherman.  Watching Chandler  being put through the paces is a riot.  The supporting cast includes  Charley Grapewin (Mr. Bane), Cora Witherspoon (Mrs. Burns-Norvell), E.E.  Clive (The fishing instructor), and Billy Benedict (Johnny).  With  outstanding performances all around, ""Libeled Lady"" is a joy to watch, from  beginning to end.  The story is clever, the dialogue witty, and it's all  charmingly put together and delivered by Conway.  And there's a kind of  graceful ambience to this film that keeps the humor fresh no matter how  many times you see it.  This is timeless entertainment, a classic depiction  of human nature that rings as true today as it did all those many years ago  when it was created; a priceless connection to another era, of another  time.",960768000,29,3691,4.830917874396135
399317,5,6301973178,"Newspaper editor Tracy leaves his prospective bride, Harlow, at the church to determine why his paper printed a juicy scandal about millionairess Loy.........This is a smashing comedy with four great stars, given a crackling script, and smooth direction. The laughs come rolling off the screen in just about every sequence and this ranks as one of the best screwball comedies of the thirties. Tracy is the managing editor of a newspaper and he erroneously prints a story which states the wealthy Loy is busy nabbing another woman's husband, a British peer............You almost need a scorecard to keep track of the twists in the story, so don't try to make any sense of of it, just enjoy the merry meanderings of a sterling cast doing their comedic best! The four leads are letter perfect in their playing while Walter Connolly can register parental distraction with the best of them! The highly zestful script has a generous spicing of witty lines and a good healthy dose of comic situations. Jack Conway's direction is agile and spontaneous. A sardonic comedy, with slapstick smudges and a liberal bedaubing of farce, it takes several freedoms with the press, liberties with the statutes, and jousts at justice - all in the merriest of moods; there are a dozen reasons why the viewer should find this a thoroughly engaging and agreeable comedy classic.  If one takes a good look at Harlow in this, you can see that her complexion looks anything but fresh & she looks rather bloated.

Instead I would rank it as one of William Powell and Myrna Loy's better films, but then I don't always care for the same Powell Loy films that everyone else does. So maybe that is not so telling.

399519,5,6301973178,"Libeled Lady, (1936).  This Oscar-nominated classic screwball comedy/romance is a brisk 98 minute, black and white film directed by Jack Conway.  It stars Spencer Tracy as Warren Haggerty, chief editor of ""The New York Evening Star,"" who's prone to postponing his nuptials to Gladys Benton (Jean Harlow); she doesn't take it well.  But he faces an even greater problem when his paper is sued by wealthy high-society beauty Connie Allenbury, (Myrna Loy), who has filed a $5 million claim that she's been libeled by his publication which has painted her as a marriage-breaker.  So Haggerty hatches an intricate plot to neutralize her.  He uses his ever-loving fianc&eacute;e Gladys, and a noted man about town, Bill Chandler, played by William Powell, to entrap the complaining socialite.  Haggerty organizes an (unconsummated) marriage between the two, in hopes of actually trapping the society beauty alone with a married man.

The clever and witty script, still racy and full of innuendo despite being made in 1936, after the repressive, blue-nosed Hays code was in place, was written by Maurine Dallas Watkins and Howard Emmett Rogers.  This picture, like GRAND HOTEL, was one of the few to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture without receiving any other nominations.

Goes without saying, it was, and is, very unusual for a film to have four big stars, each of which had been proven to carry a picture, on the payroll in one, but the film was a huge box office success.

According to Internet Movie Database, the stunningly beautiful and greatly talented light comic actress Harlow, and  Powell were an off-screen item when the film was made. And Harlow desperately wanted the part of Connie Allenbury (Myrna Loy's role) so that hers' and Powell's character would end up together. The director and MGM execs would not consider it, however. They always intended the film's being another Powell/Loy vehicle; knew that audiences wanted Powell and Loy to end up together.

Harlow, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TCM-Greatest-Classic-Film-Collection-Legends-Jean-Harlow-Dinner-at-Eight-Libeled-Lady-China-Seas-Wife-vs-Secretary/dp/B0047BXR1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TCM Greatest Classic Film Collection: Legends - Jean Harlow (Dinner at Eight / Libeled Lady / China Seas / Wife vs. Secretary)</a>) was very disappointed but had already signed on to the film and had no choice but to play the role of Gladys Benton. In the end, she liked the film and agreed that she was more suited to the role of Gladys.  The actress's fans may notice that there are few close-ups of her as her face was already puffy.  She was showing symptoms of the uremic poisoning  that was to kill her shortly, shockingly young, at the age of 26.  She was to make one more film, SARATOGA, with Clark Gable, but was already very visibly ill by then: LIBELED LADY is her last great performance. When she was entombed in Glendale's Forest Lawn Cemetery in 1937, she was dressed in a gown she wore in this film.

The movie flies on the always dependable repartee between classy Myrna Lowe and suave William Powell, with Spencer Tracy snappily responding in quick  time.  The young trouper Harlow is hysterically funny in her best scenes: the chemistry between the cast is  delightful, with the banter so fast  you might  miss  some of it. The height of screwball comedy.  Gotta catch it.",1372723200,2,5524,6.9753265602322205
399520,5,6301973178,"If you like the films of classic Hollywood at all, you'll probably recognize that a film starring William Powell, Jean Harlow, Spencer Tracy, and Myrna Loy would have to be pretty damned good.  Those are four of my favorite actors, so am really surprised it took me even this long to see LIBELED LADY - an off-the-wall comedy about a high-profile New York City newspaper editor (Spencer Tracy) who accidentally lets some copies of one of his editions get to the streets with an inaccurate story slamming a flighty NYC socialite (Myrna Loy).  The girl and her rich daddy - targets of the paper in the past - mount a $5 million libel suit against the paper and editor ... and in response, to save his paper, Tracy's character rehires the paper's shady lawyer (William Powell) to - along with Tracy's fiancee (the awesome Jean Harlow) - set up a plan to actually trap Loy's character in a racy story similar to the one the paper printed originally.

Harlow is wicked as Gladys, the fiancee who actually ends up pushed into marrying Powell's character, by Tracy, in order to later appear the grief-stricken, played-upon wife when Powell and Loy are caught together.  Loy is her usual classy beauty, and Powell (one of my all-time favorites) and Tracy pull off even the slapstick edges of the comedy brilliantly (the film is worth watching for Powell's fishing scene, alone).

399524,3,6301973178,"I like William Powell.  I wish I were more like William Powell and less like Wallace Beery, but there you are.  I am.  Never mind.

I bought the film because I'd never seen it, and couldn't find it to rent and stream.  I would have preferred to rent it.

""Libeled Lady"" is fun, the music is great, but lifted from Powell's ""The Great Ziegfeld"" which is odd, apparently it was such a hit that the studio must have rushed this one into production to give the public more Powell and Loy, and Harlow.  Powell apparently fell in love with Harlow, and was devastated by her suicide.  Anyone familiar with the Powell-Loy match from ""The Thin Man"" will be left scratching their heads, and watching this film doesn't help---but love and aesthetics aren't necessarily on the same page.  If I were a studio big wig, I never would have put Harlow into any film with Myrna Loy, as the latter's class act makes the former look cheap in the extreme.  Harlow has a similar role in ""China Seas"" where she's supposed to be cheap, and it's a much better match.

It's also hard to take William Powell as a heart breaker and seducer.

Otherwise, it's a fairly standard screwball romantic comedy.  It reminds me of the Gable/Colbert pairing in ""It Happened One Night"" but in this case the newspaper has slandered a wealthy socialite, whose father has been the editorial target of the paper's venom, and she sues for a whopping depression era $5million.  So, being men of the period, their response is to make her the tramp their headline accused her of being, by seducing her and getting caught in the act---Powell marries Harlow, who is engaged to Tracy, in order to set it up.  Nothing like the wholesome values of a venerated era long past.  Things don't go according to plan.  Powell ends up falling in love with Loy;  Harlow falls in love with Powell.  You'll have to watch it to see how it all works out.

And yes, the fishing scene really IS funny.  It's not one of the better films of the era, which is why it's gotten somewhat lost, but this is a nice, clear, sharp copy of the film and Amazon, or something else, should start streaming it, as it really is an afternoon rental, not something anyone other than a Powell/Loy/Tracy/Harlow devotee would want to own.",1356220800,,2249,4.544776119402985
399525,5,6301973178,"This is somewhat a change of pace for Spencer Tracy as he was not normally known for comedy roles.  He is a newspaper editor who always seems to busy for his girlfriend, played by Jean Harlow, who wants to get married (hard to imagine anyone being to busy to be drawn away from Jean Harlow).  He becomes involved in a libel suit when the newspaper misidentifies a woman involved in an unflattering social scene (the woman is a wealthy heiress played by Myrna Loy).  He enlists a writer, played by William Powell, to get close to the woman to try to get her to withdraw the lawsuit.  To do that he tries to become a fisherman (quick study on the subject) because the woman's father is an avid fisherman.

399527,3,6301973178,"Apart from a very funny sketch with William Powell trying to catch a trout, this comedy is relatively devoid of laughs. Perhaps a snicker here and there, and a bevy of smiles, but no real belly burners. Considered by some to be a screwball comedy, there is none of the snappy dialogue nor the fast paced action to consider this anything but a precursor to screwball comedy.

Which is a shame. After all, this is a great cast (William Powell, Spencer Tracy, Myrna Loy, Jean Harlow) and a great director. It's a typical screwball comedy plot - a spoiled wealthy heiress (Loy) sues a newspaper for libel, and the editor (Tracy) postpones his wedding (to Harlow) and enlists his friend (Powell) to lure the heiress into a compromising position to blackmail her into dropping the lawsuit. But along the way Loy and Powell fall in love, complicating everything.

25-year old Jean Harlow (1911-1937) was the biggest sex symbol of her times. Only Marilyn Monroe in the 50s ever achieved a rival position. Harlow began by playing gangster's moll (""The Secret Six"", ""Public Enemy"", ""Scarface"", ""Beast of the City"") and moved to more complex roles in ""Red Dust"" (1932) and ""Three Wise Girls"" (1932) and then dabbled as a comedienne in ""Red Headed Woman"" (1932). By 1936 she was a fully fledged movie actress and one of MGM biggest superstars. She has a minor role in this film but her name appears first in the advertisements and credits.

""Riffraff"" was her first pairing with Spencer Tracy (1900-1967) and they made ""Libeled Lady"" later that year.  Tracey is ranked 9th among AFI's Greatest Male Stars. He won 2 Oscars (""Captains Courageous"" in 1937, ""Boys Town"" in 1938) and was nominated 7 more times. Personally I think his best performances were ""Inherit the Wind"" (1960) and ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" (1961). His acting method was - ""Come to work on time, know your lines and don't bump into the other actors."" In 1936 he was still a working actor, had just signed with MGM, and his big breakout film (""Captains Courageous"") was one year ahead.

William Powell (1892-1984) was a major star of the 30s and 40s and was nominated for an Oscar 3 times (""The Thin Man"", ""My Man Godfrey"", ""Life with Father""). He played opposite Myrna Loy 14 times, including 6 ""Thin Man"" films. Powell met Harlow when they filmed ""Reckless"" (1935) and they started a love affair and had plans to marry which were interrupted by Harlow's death in June 1937 during the filming of ""Saratoga"".

Myrna Loy (1905-93) started in silent films in the mid 20s, appearing as an uncredited slave girl in ""Ben Hur"" (1925). She appeared in more than 50 silent films and then more than 20 films before 1933 when under the direction of Woody Van Dkye she made ""Penthouse"" and ""The Prizefighter and the Lady"" where her persona as a comedienne emerged. Van Dyke would transform Myrna Loy into Nora Charles, the other half of ""The Thin Man"" series (1934 - 47) for which she is best known.

FWIW - Powell and Loy appeared together in ""The Great Ziegfeld"" which won the Oscar for Best Picture, beating out ""Libeled Lady"" that was also nominated. This was their 5th of 14 pairings.

Jack Conway (1887-1952) directs.  Conway was a prolific director (over 100 films) who started out as an actor but decided directing was for him when he was asked to wrestle a lion. He directed MGM's first talkie in 1928 (""Alias Jimmy Valentine"") and worked on ""Birth of a Nation"" (1915) as a second director. Conway was particularly good working with long films (e.g., ""Viva Villa"", ""A Tale of Two Cities"", ""Northwest Passage"") and with films featuring women (e.g., ""But the Flesh is Weak"", ""Lady of the Tropics""),  He worked with Harlow on this film, ""Red Headed Woman"" (1934), ""The Girl from Missouri"" (1934), and her last film, ""Saratoga"" (1937).

In 1936 Jean Harlow had 3 films in the top 20 - ""Libeled Lady"", ""Wife vs. Secretary"" (Gable and Loy), and ""Suzy"" (Cary Grant). The other big money winners were ""San Francisco"" (Gable), ""The Great Ziegfeld"" (Powell and Loy), ""Modern Times"" (Chaplin), and ""Charge of the Light Brigade"" (Flynn and de Havilland). The big Oscar winner was ""The Great Ziegfeld"" (Picture, Best Actress). Other notable films from that year were ""The Petrified Forest"" (Bogart), ""Romeo and Juliette"" (Shearer and Howard), ""Dodsworth"" (Walter Huston) and Fritz Lang's ""Fury"".

The NY Times called it ""a sardonic comedy, with slapstick smudges and a liberal bedaubing of farce"" and ""thoroughly agreeable entertainment."" But they noted a ""certain slackening of pace toward the picture's conclusion"".

Bottom line - This isn't a very good example of screwball comedy and rates relatively low among the Powell/Loy comedies. Tracy and Harlow also did far better. Nonetheless fans of 30 comedy and these great actors will find enjoyment here.

If you want to see some really good screwball comedies from the classic period, you might be interested in ""My Man Godfrey"" (1936), ""Bringing Up Baby"" (1938), ""You Can't Take it With You"" (1938), ""His Girl Friday"" (1940), ""Philadelphia Story"" (1940), and Arsenic and Old Lace"" (1944).",1323388800,2,5080,4.885017421602788

Jean Harlow is very strong as the frivolous fiance of Spencer Tracy, who is a bigwig at a semi-frivolous newspaper, which has carelessly libeled a very wealthy socialite, Myrna Loy, who, at heart, deplores socializing.

Tracy's job is track down the guy he fired, a sophisticate, William Powell, actually a talented writer, too good for the tabloid. But he does miss that regular paycheck and is convinced that some ""consulting"" work might help in a recent mis-understanding about a Hotel bill: he'll inject himself into the lives of the Myrna and her over-protective Father, and create an ""incident"" involving himself, the socialite, and the woman he just married - Tracy's fiance, Harlow - so as to divert the lawsuit.

I will not play spoiler but I expect that the general viewer will agree with me that the plot gets a little too complicated for its' own good.

But sit back and enjoy some exceptionally *dramatic scenes*, though Powell's incompetence as Fisherman in a shallow stream must be one of the funniest sequences ever filmed. He has a bit of trouble handling his handbook *and* his fishing line and it's a genuine ""LOL"" moment.

399581,4,6301973178,"Movies don't get much funnier than 1936's LIBELED LADY, one of the first big MGM screwball comedies, in which Jean Harlow and Myrna Loy match wits (and lock lips) with Spencer Tracy and William Powell.

When the New York Evening Star's chief editor Warren Haggerty (Spencer Tracy) accidentally runs a libelous story about international playgirl and multi-millionairess Connie Allenbury (Myrna Loy), he calls off his wedding to fianc Gladys (Jean Harlow) and immediately sets about trying to fix the situation before Connie slaps the paper with a five-million dollar lawsuit.

Warren decides that the only way to get rid of Connie is by combatting fire with fire.  Hiring wily journalist Bill Chandler (William Powell), he quickly arranges for Gladys to marry Bill in a quickie wedding ceremony, before Bill sets off in a bid to woo Connie.  At the appropriate moment, when Bill and Connie's affair reaches it's height, Gladys will appear and sue Connie for alienation of affection.

The plot sounds unbelievably complicated, right?  That's all part of the delicious, screwbally fun of LIBELED LADY, which still plays remarkably fresh for a comedy from the 1930's.  A lot of the credit is due to the sparkling screenplay, created by George Oppenheimer, Howard Emmett Rogers, and Maurine Dallas Watkins (""Chicago""); based on an earlier story by Wallace Sullivan.  The stars fire off their zinger dialogue in rapid, rat-tat-tat fashion.

Jean Harlow is gorgeous as Gladys, a true shining star taken away from us too soon.  She was really coming into her own as a first-rate comedic actress.  LIBELED LADY showcases her to maximum effect; it's impossible to take your eyes off of her.  The scene where Harlow's character of Gladys marries Bill (William Powell) must have been especially poignant for her to play, given their off-screen relationship at the time.

Riding high as the beloved society sleuths Nick and Nora Charles (in addition to several other MGM films together), William Powell and Myrna Loy were, by 1936, old hands at this sort of sophisticated comedy.  Suffice to say they are just as adorable in this as they are in the ""Thin Man"" titles (the first sequel, ""After the Thin Man"", was also filmed and released in 1936).  Spencer Tracy's true comedy roles were few and far-between, but he acquits himself well as Harlow's unlikely love interest.

That way, the story in the paper will be true and Connie will have to drop her suit.  Will it work?  Or will complications overwhelm everyone involved?

I had never even heard of this comedy until my boss started raving about it.  And he was right; it was very enjoyable.  Once the premise is set up, you are in for some fun times.

There is a fishing scene that is absolutely hysterical.  The ending was a bit rushed and, honestly, not completely believable.  But it works.

I think what really got me were the characters.  While I never did really warm up to Haggerty, I loved the other three.  All the actors did a superb job bringing them to life.  They provided a spark that kept me entertained even in the slower early scenes.

399587,4,6301973178,"Although it became home to the Marx Brothers and their unique brand of comic anarchy, and although the studio had an abundance of comic talent, glossy MGM seldom dabbled with full-throttle screwball comedy. On the very rare occasions it did, the studio usually turned three stars: William Powell, Myrna Loy, and Jean Harlow, all three top box draws and all three remarkably gifted at playing complex comic dialogue.

In 1936 Jean Harlow was easily among MGM's most popular stars and she receives top billing in the 1936 LIBELED LADY--but in truth the film was very specifically designed as a vehicle for William Powell and Myrna Loy, whose powerful screen chemistry had proven box office gold in their every teaming. The cast was rounded out with Spencer Tracy and such popular character actors as Walter Connolly, Cora Witherspoon, Charley Grapewin, and E.E. Clive.

Like all screwball comedies, the plot of LIBELED LADY is ridiculously complicated. When heiress Connie Allenbury (Loy) is libeled by a New York newspaper, editor Haggerty (Tracy) hires ladykiller Bill Chandler (William Powell) to place Connie in a compromising position, allowing Bill's wife to file suit against Connie for alienation of affection and thus undermine Connnie's own suit against the newspaper. Since Bill is not married, Haggerty coaxes his own long-suffering girlfriend Gladys (Harlow) into legally marrying Bill and playing out the role. But there are no flies on Connie, and Bill is so impressed by her that he is soon in love and unwilling to go through with the scheme--and Gladys finds Bill more to her taste than Haggerty, and having married him is now loathe to let him go.

All four players are very close to the peak of their powers. Powell and Loy sparkle and shine as only they can; Harlow gives another memorable turn as a doll-faced, hard-mouthed and blowsy blonde; and while we tend to think of Tracy as a dramatic actor, he wasn't short on comedy chops. They make for a wonderful quartette. But while the characters are great and the plot is near-perfect, the script actually leaves something to be desired, never really veering over the edge into the inspired craziness one expects from the screwball genre. It's memorable, it's fun, but it doesn't equal the likes of IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT, THEODORA GOES WILD, BOMBSHELL, THE LADY EVE, or the other great classics of the genre.

The DVD release is sloppy. Bonuses include the theatrical trailer and a radio promotion, and these are mildly enjoyable, but the film itself is in surprisingly mediocre condition. It's certainly watchable, but far from pristine, and a film of this stature deserves better. Even so, and although the film itself misses the status of ""absolute classic"" by a hair, LIBELED LADY is lots and lots of fun. Strongly recommended.

Having nominated by the Academy in the best picture category, the movie is riveting and you will be glued from beginning to end due to the offbeat nature of the comedy. The story is a pure farce comedy, when the daughter of an aristocratic family Connie Allenbury (Myrna Loy) is falsely accused by the New York Evening Star newspaper of breaking up a marriage; she sues the newspaper for libel for five million dollars. This couldn't come at a worst time when the chief editor, Warren Haggerty (Spencer Tracy) is in the midst of marrying his fiance, Gladys Benton (Jean Harlow). In order to save his job and the newspaper, Haggerty postpones his wedding and get into the business of saving the newspaper from the law suit. He comes with a zany idea of hiring a former reporter Bill Chandler (William Powell) to convince Connie Allenbury to withdraw the law suit against the newspaper. The plot involves fictions wedding of Bill Chandler to his fiance Gladys who is unwilling to go along with the idea but reluctantly accepts that, and then Chandler use ""good opportunities"" to meet Connie Allenbury, romance her without telling that he is already married. When the friendship blossoms into full romance then at appropriate moment Gladys to appear on the scene and charge Connie for breaking her marriage to Chandler. The plan goes awry and it is hilarious that Connie almost comes to know the scheme but with the ingenuity of Bill Chandler the disaster is averted. Finally Connie will agree to withdraw the lawsuit but only after several mishaps. Jean Harlow, Spencer Tracy and William Powell have offered great performances, and it is during this movie Jean Harlow and William Powell developed romantic interest. This movie was directed by Jack Conway who went on to make his next movie Saratoga casting Jean Harlow and Clark Gable. Jean Harlow is known to have collapsed on the sets of Saratoga, and later died at the age of 26. This is an excellent movie and I recommend it very highly.

This time, the magic chemistry of that oft-paired duo is enhanced by the box office-drawing talents of fellow mega-stars Spencer Tracy and Jean Harlow. The first shot of the movie celebrates this happy collaboration as the four top-drawer actors merrily, confidently stride arm-in-arm toward the camera.

The plot is convoluted. The Star has erroneously printed a story about heiress Connie Allenbury (Myrna Loy), portraying her as a marriage wrecker. Connie immediately files a 5 million dollar libel suit. Star newspaper editor Warren Haggerty (Spencer Tracy) counteracts by hiring on suave fellow newspaperman Bill Chandler (William Powell) to romance Connie and place her in a compromising position, thus negating the lawsuit. Haggerty convinces his harried, long-suffering fiancee Gladys Benton (Jean Harlow) to instead marry the bachelor Chandler as part of the scheme.  Things get really tricky when Gladys falls for Chandler and Chandler falls for Connie, who eventually falls for Chandler. And Haggerty? He pretty much spends the movie just seething. Yet everything ends fairly well, even if there's still lingering confusion as to who is exactly married to whom.

Libeled Lady boasts mix-ups and complications galore and couples matching, cross-matching and mismatching. Sophisticated wit blends with full blown physical comedy. Delicious acting is laid in by four stars who, throughout their film careers, never ever lost their prime. Powell proves again his mastery of the confused double-take and, along with the wry, understated Myrna Loy, dominates the refined repartees. And representing the more lowbrow couple, Tracy supplies the blue collar bluster and Harlow the affronted looks. Walter Connolly as Connie's angling-loving father is simply wonderful. The intricate storyline is easy to follow, thanks to the clear helmsmanship of Jack Conway. With this cinematic venture, Hollywood certainly offered up to the viewing audience its most glamorous and most urbane of stars. I think it's brilliant stuff.",1150588800,9,2186,5.519402985074627

To millions of movie goers Powell and Loy were the perfect couple but in real life it was Powell and Harlow that had a torrid romance.  So the romance scenes between Powell and Harlow have a reality.

Spencer Tracy has been rated by the AFI as the best actor in films ever.  This film shows his comic ability that would peak with his film with Katherine Hepburn.

Jean Harlow was most of the time wasted as the dumb blonde.  But she was a great actress.  This film hid her as the dumb blonde until the final scene where she just lets go and shows you what she has.

William Powell was a great lead actor but his best roles were the suave but imperfect ladies man.  Just as we now have the Hugh Grant character.  In the thirties, forties and fifties, there was the William Powell character.

Myrna Loy is acknowledged as the perfect film wife.  She always matched her performance to compliment her co star.  Unfortunately, she was always better than her roles.  This is one of her best films.

Powell and Loy made 13 films together including the six Thin Man films. This is the best of them.  Loy and Harlow made an even better film with Gable called Wife vs. Secretary.  So if you like this look for W vs. S hopefully on DVD or on TCM.

There are many wonderful scenes though - Powell's brief disenchantment with Loy saying she is too ""delicate"" for him, the hilarious fishing segment, and the finale where the four lovers confront other are classics.

I never realized before William Powell, playing the deceitful con man, is really the most pleasant character of the foursome!  Lovely Myrna Loy is at her snobbiest as the aloof heiress, if you've never seen her other movies you might would wonder why she was so popular because her she plays a character almost completely without sympathy.  Spencer Tracy is even more unlikable as the sneaky newspaperman who treats his beautiful fiancee Jean Harlow horribly.  My darling Jean Harlow, one of my very favorite stars (as are Powell and Loy), plays one of her few ""dumb blonde"" roles and I far prefer her as the sassy wisecracker who knows all the angles than as the victim.  Providing excellent support are Walter Connally as Loy's fishing-obssessed father and Cora Witherspoon, as the gossipy socialite Loy avoids like the plague.

This DVD also has far fewer extras than most MGM classics, just a trailer and a radio promo.  Where is a documentary like most of the WB/MGM releases?  Since the TCM documentaries on the stars are on other DVDS, couldn't they have made an original one on the underrated director, Jack Conway?",1140912000,4,2198,4.824

399708,5,6301973178,"William Powell, Myrna Loy, Jean Harlow, and Spencer Tracy star in Libeled Lady!

Libeled Lady is one of my favorite movies! Although you must admit any movie with Bill and Myrna is going to be pretty darn funny, right?

Loy plays a rich, hard to get play girl, while Powell plays his typical roll. Spencer Tracy works on the Star which is a newswpaper. And when they accidently print a false story about Connie(Loy) she decides to sue the paper for 5 million dollars! Everyone on the paper is shocked. Tracy decides to get even and frame Connie.

Hilarity ensues when he hires Powell to marry his quite unwilling fiance (Harlow, who has been standing at the alter many a time witing for Tracy to show up. But a story always seems to interfear)  for a time being and then go after Connie. Then they can cook up a REAL scandal with Connie when she suddenly finds out he's married to another woman! But what happend when Bill really starts to fall in love with Connie?

399709,5,6301973178,"Having watched Dinner at Eight and its bonus feature about the story of Jean Harlow, I am strongly urged to see Libeled Lady - just to watch another Jean Harlow performance and see how she succeeded in injecting a comic element into the movie. I am not a bit disappointed.

The movie, made in 1936,  featured Jean Harlow, William Powell, Myrna Loy and Spencer Tracy. Because of the star-studded cast, I am more attracted to the people more than the plot. They are all naturals, with impeccable comic timing.

In the first part of the movie, Jean Harlow stole the scenes with her longing and eagerness to be married to the newspaper man (Spencer Tracy). She was daring, bold and frank and would do anything for Tracy - even marrying William Powell as part of a plot to frame the rich socialite (Myrna Loy)and save Tracy's newspaper from bankruptcy in a libel suit. However, once William Powell took the mission of seducing Myrna Loy, one can't help applausing for his subtle, elegant way of stealing hearts of the lady (Myrna Loy) and her father (Walter Connolly)and even his ""wife"" (Jean Harlow). This gift of William Powell was revealed again in the Great Ziegfeld. Not everything is smooth in his ploy, however. Just watch his hilarious fishing scene which was one of the most entertaining I have seen. There was a deeply touching scene when Myrna Loy opened her heart to William Powell after a swim in the moonlight. It was unpretentious, geunine and revealed the real worth of the Myrna Loy-Wiliam Powell chemistry on the screen. Altogether THE couple of the 1930's made 14 films, the first one being the Thin Man. Off the screen, Jean Harlow and William Powell were a couple. And it was Willam Powell (not Spencer Tracy in the movie) whom Jean Harlow wanted to marry while he was hesitant to remarry so soon.

This is a perfect movie to demonstrate what superb performance the stars of the stars could deliver in an interesting plot revolving around just 5 characters. Jean Harlow's performance stood out but still could not outshine Myrna Loy, the Queen of Hollywood as voted by millions of people in a poll conducted by 53 newspapers. Don't miss it.",1135555200,,2156,4.726063829787234
399710,5,6301973178,"Nominated for Best Picture Oscar in 1936, Jack Conway's screwball comedy is a raucous farce buzzing with zany humor, thanks to a flurry of impeccable one-liners delivered by Powell and Loy, reunited from their initial pairing in ""The Thin Man."" Playing the newspaper's frantic editor and his continually jilted fiance, Spencer Tracy and Jean Harlow round out the stellar foursome. (Harlow, Powell's real-life love, would die tragically only months after filming was completed.)",1125878400,2,477,5.5479452054794525
399711,5,6301973178,"If you think some witty modern comedies are funny try this older stuff for a change--you might be converted! Plot is pretty straight up: scandalized rich girl (Myrna Loy) sues newspaper for false story (Spencer Tracy is editor and his endlessly stood-up fiancee is Jean Harlow). Tracy ""contracts"" former newspaper comrade (now enemy), William Powell, to seduce Loy and create a counter scandal so she'll drop the charges.

Give this to a modern film company and we kind of know what to expect, give it to a talented ensemble of the sort assembled here, add the natural chemistry that was Powell/Loy, and heave in a terrific script full of great lines and you've got a screwball classic of the type and quality unique to its era. The film just flows, the lines flow, even the absurd plot and its triply absurd conclusions just flow. It's a joy from beginning to end.

One real treat is seeing Powell do some first-rate slapstick during a fly-fishing scene. You'd expect him to just get through it OK but he literally throws himself into the physical humor in a way that would do Keaton proud.

The film also has some sweetness and romance, especially a lovely scene or two between Powell and Loy including a touching moment when he wipes a smudge off her face and she replies ""thanks"" so sincerely and adorably that it's small wonder she was so popular for so many years. Myrna Loy was in a class by herself and proof of God's existence is that she was paired with a guy who was in a class by himself. They were great friends and mutual clowns and kidders in real life (funny moments in some of their films together almost looked improvised!)and it shows on screen in a chemistry that is less physical heat and more spiritual kinship--two soul mates acting together. Powell married Harlow for a while and I suppose it'll always be a mystery why he and Loy never really got genuinely serious. I love this film but I'd have to say every film with Powell and Loy is a treasure. Do yourself a favor and pick up the Thin Man collection just released!",1125360000,5,2044,4.579234972677596
399712,5,6301973178,"This was Jean Harlow's last truly great film and she shares the complicated but hilarious plot with people she adored in real life: Myrna Loy, Spencer Tracy and her real-life romantic interest, William Powell. That Jean and William were involved in an on-again off-again romance doesn't affect the superb comedic performance of Jean Harlow. ""Libeled Lady"" is a gem of a comedy and it is not just a William Powell/Myrna Loy film. Jean Harlow and Spencer Tracy put in great performances. One highlight is seeing Jean look quite unglamorous at the beauty salon with her hair being permed and a mud pack on her face! She deserves top billing in this film in a role that suits her comic skills. Her one scene with Myrna Loy is very touching and they balance one another out perfectly. I hope that their other film together, ""Wife vs. Secretary"" will be released on DVD soon. Jean is portrays a lady-like character with perfection!

""Libeled Lady"" is a must-have for any fan of screwball comedies. Had Jean Harlow lived, she would have starred with such stars of this genre like Cary Grant and that pairing would have been marvelous. But ""Libeled Lady"" gives Jean Harlow (sans the platinum blonde hair she never needed) a golden opportunity to show that comedy was her forte and she is with three great stars and a director who made a complicated story into a delightful screwball comedy. Enjoy ""Libeled Lady""!!!",1125100800,,1406,4.809917355371901
399713,1,6301973178,"Warner Brothers brought this great screwball comedy to DVD with much fanfare, but did absolutely nothing to clean or restore the battered print that has been used for the VHS for nearly 20 years. Frames are actually missing in some scenes, and scratches are evident throughout.  The contrast in the original silver nitrate print was dazzling -- this is fuzzy at best.  I'm glad to see this film on DVD, but honestly, how hard would it have been to clean it up a bit?? The technology could have really made this old beauty shine.",1122249600,49,528,4.6063829787234045
399714,5,6301973178,"This movie was underrated for many years, and even those who love screwball comedy would generally tell you this was a second-tier movie compared to MY MAN GODFREY or EASY LIVING or any number of Irene Dunne classics she made at Columbia.  Even at the time of release it was a slight box office disappointment, and marked the end of so-called ""Four Star"" comedies at MGM.  Henceforward the bosses would not, they vowed, waste the salaries of 4 big stars on something not guaranteed to bring in four times the income.  Cynics claimed that the US mass public did not understand the word ""Libeled"" and thus they shied away from going to see a movie that had such a title.

However, in recent years the reputation of this film has skyrocketed, and it has become as beloved and necessary as most of its once powerful rivals, even if it still strains at the coattails of the inimitable BRINGING UP BABY.  It's simply less surrealistic and its plot, though convoluted, at all times makes at least a kind of dramatic sense.  Jean Harlow plays Gladys, a secretary whose boss has put off marrying her one too many times.  Finally, the worm is turning with a vengeance!  It's the same kind of slow-burning part that won Vivian Blaine a lot of eclat as Adelaide in GUYS AND DOLLS, but without the music, and Harlow did it first and perhaps even better.  Judy Holliday also must have watched LIBELED LADY also, because many of Judy's tricks were taken from Harlow as Gladys.  It's true, as some reviewers have mentioned, that Harlow looks pretty beat up for 25 (signs of kidney disease) but you can see why William Powell, her co-star here, fell in love with her in real life, she's tough-talking, vulnerable, real, with a shining spirit underneath.  Spencer Tracy plays the man who breaks her heart, Warren, the editor of a NYC paper that's come to flirt with tabloid scandals and has published an expose of Connie Allenbury as a mantrap--a ""husband stealer,"" scream the headlines in 48 pt type.  Only problem is, it's just not true.  Spencer Tracy gets a brainstorm and he makes it true--well, sort of.

The story is complicated and yet, getting there is just as much fun as being there.  One wonders how the actors managed to keep a straight face through much of their exaggerated, ridiculous dialogue with all the slammbang plot twists and indeed, once or twice, it looks like Tracy is cracking himself up when he's supposed to be angry, as though he just couldn't keep from chuckling aloud.  You will too, as you watch this 1930s gem.",1122249600,4,2526,4.655405405405405
399715,4,6301973178,"Funny, not fitfully so, comedy about a yellow newspaper being sued by an heiress (Myrna Loy) over a bogus story they printed.  The paper's snaky editor(Spencer Tracy) hires libel lawyer(William Powell) to marry his fiancee (Jean Harlow) and subsequently seduce heiress so that they can entrap her in a scandal.  All of the film's principle actors are at top form.  Highlights would include an amusing trout-fishing sequence where novice fisherman Powell seems to be caught by the fish and not vice-versa.  It's also a pleasure to watch Jean Harlow as the long-suffering fiancee do a series of comic slow-burns.  At this point in time Harlow was an adept comedienne and if she hadn't died prematurely she could only have gotten better.
