8478612,5,B005LVH4FW,wonderful DVD to watch on a snowy evening around the Holidays,1425168000,,61,4.636363636363637
8478613,5,B005LVH4FW,"I saw the last part of the video on Youtube.  Delighted to get the program on disc.  The 30 minute (last) section is a survey of Christmas music which includes ""A Spotless Rose"" which always brings tears to my eyes when I hear Ben Davis sing the solo part.  Hoping that the final third-sung by choir would have been included-but it was not.  In spite of that, happy to have this disc.",1420588800,,384,4.291666666666667

8478615,4,B005LVH4FW,"This DVD works fine in NTSC systems, and is not a PAL video.  (Occasionally BBC videos state they are NTSC format, but come in PAL, subsequently not working in DVD players in North America.)  I enjoyed both seasons of the ""Sacred Music"" series with Simon Russell Beale and The Sixteen led by Harry Christophers.  If you enjoyed them, you are likely to enjoy this as well.",1397520000,,371,4.590909090909091
8478616,3,B005LVH4FW,More of a documentary history of Christmas sacred music than a music DVD.  If you like sacred music history you will love it.,1356048000,5,125,4.434782608695652
8478617,5,B005LVH4FW,"This is a worthy addition to the BBC ""Sacred Music"" series. It is excellent entertainment for both mind and ears.",1355616000,2,113,4.7
8478618,5,B005LVH4FW,"I saw this on the BBC and it was a great show. Visually really super and the music was really captivating.

Musicologically, this isn't an in depth look at the topic, but it is a pleasure otherwise.  The music is lush and accompanied by lovely images from the history of the carols.  The performances of the carols are spectacular as well.

Unfortunately, you have to watch the show to hear the music.  I wish there was a list of the mp3s on this DVD since the descriptions I have found only say:

""Bonus features include seven free audio tracks, trailers for Sacred Music: Series One and Sacred Music: An Easter Celebration, artist biographies, and related CD information.""

I think one description said the tracks were ""previously released material"" as well.  But here are the tracks:

Make We Joy From the Album Christus Natus Est/An Early English Christmas
In dulci jubilo by Johann Sebastian Bach  From Traditional Christmas Carol
There is no rose  Hodie--An English Christmas
Make we joy now in this fest  Hodie--An English Christmas
A spotless rose  Hodie--An English Christmas

I've intentionally left out a couple from the Traditional Carol: Hark! The herald angels sing and Silent Night since I am not sure how close those versions are to the ones on the show.

Some of the tracks may be on ""In Celebration of Christmas"", but that is hard to come by.  ""Christmas Music from Medieval and Renaissance Europe"" also seems to have a few which are missing in the above list. So, if you are looking for a CD of the tracks, the last may be an option.

I strongly suggest this DVD for anyone who loves Christmas and Christmas music.

Of course, it would be nice if they made just a CD of the music.  Of course, if the DVD also came with some option to just play the songs, or a CD, Then I have to get a copy for next year.

Well, there is the car thing as well. Don't want your music causing any accidents.

I may break down and buy the DVD for the music alone!

BTW, the amazon UK site has a better description of the DVD.",1327622400,10,2024,4.487671232876712
