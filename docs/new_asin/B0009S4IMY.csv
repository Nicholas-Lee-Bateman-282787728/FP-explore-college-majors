2317474,5,B0009S4IMY,"This DVD set is a superb BBC collection of some of the works of (Dame) Agatha Christie and gives us the wonderfully wacky pairing of Francesca Annis (Tuppence) and James Warwick (Tommy) in a lively performance of (Dame) Agatha's two amateur sleuths. While not, of course, (Dame) Agatha's most famous sleuths, they do, never the less, solve their cases in the inimitable Christie fashion and give us a lot of fun along the way.

The Seven Dials Mystery gives us the wonderful (Sir) John Gielgud in great form as the distracted but indulgent father apart from the stars of the film who are also in fine form.

Agatha Christie: A life in pictures is a typically superb BBC production
detailing the msterious 11 day disappearance of Agatha Christie in 1926. (Dame) Anna Massey is marvellous in her role. The whole film excellently captures the sense of drama of the occasion and the romantic mood of the 1920's.

I reccommend the set to any Agatha Christie fan as an excellent addition to their library.",1182816000,,999,4.763005780346821
2317475,5,B0009S4IMY,"What these mysteries have in common is that they contain intelligent, talented women.  These gals make Wonder Woman look like an airhead bimbo, but you may have already have had that evaluation of her.

The settings are the inner-war years and the characters are upper class.

The plots of the two complete stories and the first Tommy and Tuppence are first rate because they were written by Christie and not a modern script writter.  The plots are convoluted with many red herrings. The remaining T&T episodes are more like short stories and 50 minutes long.  You will immediately be consternated on half of these by the obvious important clue that ends up solving the mystery in each one being ignored for 20 minutes.  You should get the solution to the alibi episode in under a minute after the visitor to the detective agency tells his story.

There is one DVD on Agatha herself.  This is in the form of a dramatization where you are slowly spoon fed bland information about her.  This will probably insult your intelligence.  Just throw it in the trash.",1124496000,,1058,4.73224043715847

8066075,5,B0009S4IMY,"Most Agatha Christie fans adore her Hercule Poirot mysteries. I do too. But I think the Tommy & Tuppence series is even better. The longer works in these books are thorough and logical; the way I see it A. Christie uses far too many shortcuts when wrapping up the Poirot mysteries. The T&T stories, on the other hand are better crafted, the red-herrings making sense and challenging the reader.

Regarding the personalities of Tommy and Tuppence, they are funny and convincing (their banter is particularly good), and it's fun to follow their thinking in resolving the mysteries. The longer stories involving World Wars I & II (interspersed are shorter mysteries) are excellent as well as surprising.

The very last mystery as a bit of a let-down and is the only story that rambles. It's worth the read anyway.

It's interesting that the language of The Secret Adversary (my favorite of the stories) is quite proper, in keeping with the time period of WW I, while T&T mysteries Agatha Christie wrote in the forties and fifties is more modern.

The Tommy & Tuppence collection centering around their makeshift detective agency and sinister foreign forces, and which follow the pair from callow youth to wise adult-hood, is really a pleasure to read. I highly recommend it.",1395446400,,1271,4.925233644859813
8066076,5,B0009S4IMY,"True, as some reviewers complain, sometimes the plots do not add up in these stories. But that is not the fault of the tv series in this DVD set, but of the author. Agatha Christie was notorious for that, to wrap things up in the end in a highly unlikely way. For instance, don't be surprised to see the deus ex machina of some aunt that arrives out of nowhere to provide the missing bit of motive (usually a will, which all to often is also changed many times without knowledge of the tv viewer)for a killer. Very elementary, well, not.
That is annoying since what made for instance Murder She Wrote (a Marple offspin in the US) so popular as a whodunit was that in principle, with the info shown in the episode, you could work out at least a bit who might be the killer. Well, apparently Agatha Christie said the made most of her plots while doing the dishes, maybe that was the reason they were not her strongest point?
Despite all this, all I can say about the bad plots is: who cares? Agatha Christie  remains the undisputed best of crime writing, and to me Tommy and Tuppence from the 80s plus the two movies that are included here, are still the best, since they embody to me all that makes Agatha Christie great: romantic atmosphere.

Because, what a wonderful nostalgia we get in these series, not only the roaring twenties where, as one reviewer on some BBC site remarked, the killer either always seems to wear knickerbockers or a silk smoking jacket, but also the 80s themselves. How tv has changed! In so many series now we have seen it: two main characters that have chemistry, but they do not seems to know they are both attracted to each other, and on it goes, season after season, until finally the steamy sex arrives we all have been waiting for? I rather go for atmosphere and a good old fashioned story! The attraction or chemistry between Tommy and Tuppence,  is there, but never goes further than a sort of wiggling with the head lip on lip sort of kissing that is supposed to mean the French way of doing it. The rest we can work out ourselves, right?
The costume drama is as lush as Poirot or any other series mentioned by reviewers, the atmosphere is truly romantic, the lovely Francisca Annis who, with her sidekick truly seems to enjoy the thrill of it all, who can ask for more entertainment?
Of course, I would also want to recommend Poirot, the 80s and new Marple series, and others, but although a cliche, this is the best of them all and they don't make these anymore!",1372032000,,2500,4.442265795206971
8066077,4,B0009S4IMY,"Tommy & Tuppence are a good romantic duo, with this set you get to see how they started out, to solving mysteries as a married couple.",1361491200,,134,4.1923076923076925
8066078,4,B0009S4IMY,"People who only have a passing knowledge of Agatha Christie's body of work may be surprised that she penned recurring sleuths other than Hercule Poirot and Miss Marples. Her third most prolific mystery solvers are Tommy & Tuppence Beresford, and they happen to be my top choice of all of Christie's clue wranglers. On television, in 1982, these perfectly amiable amateur detectives-in-love made their mark with BBC's delightful television film adaptation of THE SECRET ADVERSARY, a recounting of their first ever caper. In 1983, BBC aired the PARTNERS IN CRIME series which adapted Christie's second Tommy & Tuppence novel (or anthology, to be more accurate). The inclusion of these Tommy & Tuppence adventures is why I snapped up this DVD collection.

AGATHA CHRISTIE'S ROMANTIC DETECTIVES is pretty sweet. It treats us to 7 discs rife with baffling mysteries and jolly escapades staged as British period pieces. The production values convincingly steep the viewer in the backdrop of early 20th century England. You're in for a treat, especially if you favor the flapper era. As mentioned, this set, on four (of the seven) discs, presents THE SECRET ADVERSARY and the PARTNERS IN CRIME episodes (10 in total, each ep around 50 minutes long). And for dessert, the final three discs provide television film adaptations of two other Christie classics, WHY DIDN'T THEY ASK EVANS? and SEVEN DIALS MYSTERY, as well as the BBC biopic AGATHA CHRISTIE: A LIFE IN PICTURES.

But you'll pardon me, I hope, as I mostly talk up Tommy & Tuppence.

Unlike Christie's more somber stories, these particular mysteries are distinguished by a lighter tone. The common thread here is the presence of actors Franscesca Annis and James Warwick. They bring to life, respectively, the mischievous, inquisitive Tuppence and the steady, sensible Tommy. Their spirited partnering produces a steady dose of amusing verbal jousting. They keep on trading these naughty half-smiles.

The DVD package is titled AGATHA CHRISTIE'S ROMANTIC DETECTIVES, and these features don't play us false. There's the all-important whodunit aspect, yes, but there's also the romantic element. Tommy and Tuppence's romance is a bubbly, effervescent thing. This sophisticated English couple bring the sexy, and the offhanded comic timing, and an appealing air of self-mockery. Tommy and Tuppence Beresford would feel entirely at home hobnobbing with Nick and Nora Charles. And not only do Annis and Warwick share a marvelous, playful chemistry as the Beresfords, but they're equally engaging as sudden sleuths Lady Frankie Derwent and Bobby Jones in their earlier collaboration WHY DIDN'T THEY ASK EVANS? (first aired, 1980). And, if you haven't had enough of James Warwick, he shows up again in THE SEVEN DIALS MYSTERY (1981).

THE SECRET ADVERSARY begins in the aftermath of the first world war. It finds longtime chums Tommy and Tuppence renewing acquaintances. Being two young things down on their luck, they decide, on a whim, to engage in a joint venture. They place an ad in the paper, keening for adventure, and promptly reel in a case, the gist of which has them striving to unearth the mysterious Jane Finn, who may have in her possession a secret treaty of which publication could destroy England. But opposing Tommy and Tuppence is the brilliant criminal mastermind, Mr. Brown, who could be anyone and be anywhere. I have loved many an Agatha Christie mystery. For sheer likability, THE SECRET ADVERSARY sits very near the pinnacle.

I love the short story collection, PARTNERS IN CRIME, near as much. In its opening salvo, ""The Affair of the Pink Pearl,"" several years have elapsed since the events of THE SECRET ADVERSARY, and Tuppence Beresford is bored, bored, bored. She longs for adventure, or as her patient hubby Tommy puts it: ""This craving for vulgar sensation alarms me."" But, for the Beresfords, the doldrums are soon over as, for a six month trial period, they get a crack at running a down-and-out private detective agency, interchangeably called Blunt's Detective Agency or the International Detective Agency.

In the book version of PARTNERS IN CRIME, each short story involves Tommy and Tuppence applying an investigative method favored by a (at the time) well-known literary sleuth. This conceit isn't as relevant in the TV adaptation, but there's still a whiff of good-natured parody lurking about in several episodes. So, for example, we glimpse a glimmer of Sherlock Holmes in ""The Case of the Missing Lady"" and Father Brown in ""The Man in the Mist."" In ""The Sunningdale Mystery"" the Beresfords do a bit of armchair detecting ala Baroness Orczy's the Old Man in the Corner, and in ""The House of Lurking Death,"" A.E.W. Mason's ingenious French Inspector Hanaud (of course, you remember him!) is channeled. What fun! By the way, young Reece Dinsdale does very well as the exuberant, cinema-obsessed Albert, erstwhile bellboy become the Beresfords' butler.

I only wish they'd adapted N OR M? as well.

On to the rest of the DVD set, briefly: In 1980's very watchable WHY DIDN'T THEY ASK EVANS? - which featured the first pairing of Annis and Warwick - Bobby Jones (James Warwick) finds at the bottom of a cliff a dying man who, before expiring, bemusedly wonders: ""Why didn't they ask Evans?"" This twisty mystery showcases Annis and Warwick as amateur sleuths who become embroiled in mixed identities, poisoning, and, naturally, murder most foul.

1981's lighthearted thriller, THE SEVEN DIALS MYSTERY, stars Cheryl Campbell as Lady Eileen ""Bundle"" Brent, a curious girl who stumbles across a nefarious secret society. But she gets ready assistance from suave man-about-town Jimmy Thesiger (Warwick). John Gielgud, by the way, happens to be perfectly wonderful as Bundle's indulgent father. Campbell is fine as ""Bundle,"" although I've a sneaking suspicion that Annis would've blown her out of the water. And if you're of a mind to meet a Christie detective even further under a rock than the Beresfords, then you're in luck. Superintendent Battle is sniffing around in this one.

If nothing else, the ratings success of both WHY DIDN'T THEY ASK EVANS? and THE SEVEN DIALS MYSTERY led to the commissioning of THE SECRET ADVERSARY and PARTNERS IN CRIME.

Lastly AGATHA CHRISTIE: A LIFE IN PICTURES makes for interesting... somewhat serviceable... okay, ponderous viewing. It narrates in flashback a bizarre period in the life of Agatha Christie (played by Olivia Williams and Anna Massie) in which she went missing for eleven days, her disappearance giving rise to mass media furor and wild speculation. But I wasn't feeling this one.",1336694400,,6613,5.1471135940409685
8066079,4,B0009S4IMY,"Evans, Seven Dials and the series opener of Tommy and Tuppence are first rate efforts in the tradition of  Poirot and Marple: A productions intended to be class entertainment. The remainder of the T and T series is also what was intended: lower budget,  routine evening television that will capture your attention, allow you to see some beautiful people in beautiful period clothes, and warrant your spending an hour (50 minutes without commercials-as presented here) without being particularly intrigued but not so poor as to jump to the competition which is probably no better. As a set, it is justified for purchase by the value you place on the A efforts and your desire for  some time fillers which have some appeal to them. Certainly seeking a good discount or a used set is advisable. I was content with what I got at the price paid, at retail price plus tax my appreciation would have been measurably reduced.",1298073600,,917,4.791139240506329
8066080,1,B0009S4IMY,"Even after making allowance for the stories being some of Christie's earlier work, this set is just plain bad. The writing is dreadful and the actors worse. Particularly Tuppy who I formed a deep and permanent dislike after about 5 minutes. Her accent & attitude got under my skin. Quite obviously a theater actor with a background in ""light"" comedy who didn't translate to the small screen at all well..

Seven dials is the best of the lot. That's not saying much but at least Tuppy was absent and the heroine in contrast was likeable enough but even so, not worth the price of admission.

Give this set a miss and buy Lord Peter Wimsey with Ian Carmichael, a true gem from the same TV era.",1271289600,,691,4.476190476190476
8066081,1,B0009S4IMY,"Compared to the Poirot, Midsomer Murders, Miss Marple, Mrs. Bradley mysteries and the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes series, this set of DVDs is a great disappointment. There are only a couple of the DVDs worth watching the rest are victims of marginal acting, weak plots and dull screen writing.",1205452800,,294,5.020408163265306
