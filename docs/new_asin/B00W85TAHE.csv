7126161,3,B00W85TAHE,Did all five miles last night - not bad!  The music is eh....but overall pretty good....each miles goes to the very end of the segment- she squeezes every second into every mile.....I was sweating throughout as I wore a weighted vest and handweights....she has a couple of moves that are identical to Leslie Sansone but she has others that are hers.....I like her 15 min fat burning miles better - that is an intense 1 hour workout.....I will use this to switch things up.....,1432252800,6,476,4.666666666666667
7126162,5,B00W85TAHE,"Jessica Smith is my absolute, FAVORITE fitness trainer.  She has gained momentum, and popularity over the past few years, with her impressive line-up of fantastic DVDs, including, but not limited to, multiple in the ""Walk On"" series, that are designed to really be ""for everyone"".  This most recent addition to the Jessica Library is no exception.

Following in the footsteps of Leslie Sansone, and improving on Jessica's previous ""Walk On"" releases, this latest, includes a variety of 5 different routines/miles (warm up and cool down included) that can be done simultaneously, or mixed and matched based on preference.  Each Walk is about 15 minutes each, and is 1 mile in distance, making it easy to rack up those 10,000 steps a day from the comfort of your home.  As always, Jessica performs the intermediate options, and has a higher impact exerciser option and a lower impact option for beginners or those who need to take things slower or with less impact.

Mile 1 Brain Booster Walk; is a fun walk, that combines upper body/arm and hand motions in opposite directions, or patterns that differ from the lower body, to help stimulate and develop neurons in the brain.  It's challenging, but very fun!  Almost like a game.  This walk is totally different from anything Jessica has done before.

Mile 2 Belly, Buns and Thighs Walk:  Incorporates mini-squats, standing knee pulls/crunches with arms, etc. to work the abs and lower body from all angles without having to get on the floor and do boring sit-ups (I am totally feeling this one the day after!!)

Mile 3 Power Posture Walk:  Again is a paced walk, using arm reaches and raises, chest expansion work with the upper body and other moves while standing, to work the upper body, shoulders and back.  I really could feel this one working, and I didn't have a single weight in my hand.

Mile 4 Turbo Charged Walk: Is just as it sounds, a faster paced (13 minute vs 15) walk, that incorporates some multi-directional movement (don't worry, it's easy, and you won't be uncoordinated or trip over your feet), and periods of light jogging, to help build up cardiovascular endurance and stamina.  It's also a great place to start if you'd like to build up to being able to run or jog, or are recovering from an injury and just getting back into something higher impact.  As always, there is a modifier, that does not jog, so you have that option if it is not right for you.

Mile 5 Boogie Down Walk:  Is as it sounds, a fun 15 minute, dancy-style (think Zumba) walk, that puts a smile on your face, and some sweat on your brow.

Included also are two BONUS 15 minute stand alone routines (The Strong Feet and Ankles Routine AND The Strong Knees and Hips Routine) that use a simple chair, and folded bath towel to help develop the often overlooked, but important muscles in these areas.

In Summary, I truly feel that this is easily one of Jessica's BEST DVD releases to date which will easily become part of my routine, be that stand alone, or incorporated with other routines.

PROS:
Multiple, short routines to mix and match with the ability to ""build you own workout"" from the menu screen
Bubbly, upbeat instructor who truly enjoys what she does.
NEW TO THIS DVD, a count-down timer at or near the 8 minute mark of each routine.
NEW CONTENT ; BRAIN BOOSTER ROUTINE WHICH WAS REALLY FUN plus the Feet/Ankle/Knees/Hips options previously not on any DVD.

CONS:
Only one for me, and that was the ""recycling"" of some of the music/songs from her other Walking DVDs.  Over the course of the entire DVD, I did note about 4-5 songs that had been featured on her other Walking DVDs, but still, the songs we're fun, and this was only a minor distraction for me, and may not affect others, especially if this is their first Jessica DVD.

All in all, I am eager to continue to use this DVD, and look forward to continuing to share my love of Jessica's routines with my friends and family.  She's been my mainstay since 2010, and no matter where my fitness journey takes me, I always circle back around to her.  She's fun, energetic, and her workouts WORK!  I am coming back from injury from training for a half-marathon, and was so excited to be able to complete this DVD last evening, including the ""optional"" higher impact jogging without pain.  To me that is PROGRESS!",1432080000,252,4315,4.655672823218997
7126163,5,B00W85TAHE,"I have nearly all of Jessicas DVDs....they are fabulous and keep on getting better and better, and I have worked out with her free videos from her YouTube channel for almost a year now.
I don't know how she does it! Shes always outdoing herself.
What I really like about this one is the Brain Booster walk...I have a doctoral degree in Brain and Behavior (though Im not working in the field as I am homeschooling my kids) and I know how important this is. It is especially good for special needs kids (have two of them) because its calming and challenging, and also great for that afternoon slump of tiredness.

I also really love the two bonus workouts. One is for feet and ankles and the other is for hips. I have problems with my feet (hammertoes) and many of these exercises that she does were ones I found online. Its so nice to have them in one place.

I love the calm setting, and the bright colors she and her mom and her friend wear. That is a nice pick me up, too.

Each segment is only 15 minutes, so you can do as little or as much as you want.

My only regret is that her beloved mascot, Peanut the French Bulldog, isn't in her professionally filmed videos. :) But we can see him in her YouTube Channel.",1431820800,46,1216,4.251082251082251
7126164,5,B00W85TAHE,This is a great tape for our group which range from late 50's to 80. You can customize your workout with their menu that lets you select segments at one time so they follow one right after another. We liked it so much we bought more of her tapes. Brain teaser sections are really fun and we laugh a lot!,1527206400,,303,4.066666666666666
7126165,5,B00W85TAHE,"I love this DVD. This was excellent. You can customize the miles, so you don't have to do the same workout each time. I do about 3 miles, and I try to change up the order each time, which keeps it interesting for me. Big fan of this DVD",1527033600,2,236,3.836734693877551

7126168,5,B00W85TAHE,This is one of the best walking DVD's...I prefer to walk outside but it is not always convenient.  This DVD is energetic and not boring..you can take it up a notch or stay with the low impact.  The thing with most walking DVD...if you do then often ..the chatter becomes annoying ..this DVD offers great cueing and not a lot of chatter.  Which is great if you want to use often..it is also has a great descriptive menu..you can do 1 mile or 2...etc or do all 5...the menu also allows you to customize your workout.  Love this workout and will do it often!,1525132800,2,555,4.3076923076923075
7126169,5,B00W85TAHE,"Arrived as scheduled.  I like this workout tape.  The five segments are each different.  I like that it allows you to preset them in the order you prefer, including the warm up and cool down.",1524960000,,191,4.4

7126171,5,B00W85TAHE,LOVE. I seriously got more of a workout doing 2 exercises on this than when I walk 4 miles.,1523750400,,91,3.8421052631578947
7126172,5,B00W85TAHE,"I hadnt really read reviews and had mainly picked this because it was a low impact exercise video rated really high. I get why now! Doing the workout goes incredibly fast beause Jessica Smith keeps you engaged the whole time. Pretty soon you're surprised you're moving on to your next segment. The moves and walking in place don't seem like they're intense at all, but the day after doing the video the first time, I was actually feeling the exercise I did all over! The video works and you don't feel like you're killing yourself like in other workouts.",1523577600,,554,4.606060606060606
7126173,5,B00W85TAHE,Great for transitioning from a knee injury.,1523318400,,43,5.285714285714286

7126175,5,B00W85TAHE,I have been using this workout since I have bought it I have been exercising now for 40 years I like her style,1522972800,,110,3.8260869565217392
7126176,5,B00W85TAHE,"Jessica is innovative with her exercise moves!  No boring same old, same old! Her bonus workout ""Strong Knees and Legs"" is a great workout - and it isn't the usual squats!  Highly recommended!  In addition, she sent another DVD case out when I reported that the package was already open when I opened the mailbox - and the case had two cracks/breaks in the case when I examined it at home.  Thank you! If you want a innovative, non-boring workout, Jessica has them!",1522800000,,465,4.566265060240964
7126177,5,B00W85TAHE,Great work out video,1522713600,,20,4.25
7126178,4,B00W85TAHE,"I try to mix my workouts up between running, weights and step aerobics. This was something entirely different.  I didn't hate it or love it.  According to my fit bit I did get 7,893 steps in with the entire workout.  I can see using this maybe once a week to break my workouts up. She is energetic and her directions were easy to follow.",1522627200,,337,4.234375
7126179,5,B00W85TAHE,Love all these tapes.  Fun!!!! Great workout.,1522108800,,45,5.428571428571429
7126180,5,B00W85TAHE,Great work out.  Each mile has a different area to work on.,1520812800,,59,3.9166666666666665
7126181,1,B00W85TAHE,I absolutely hated this workout. The music is awful and I found it very hard to stay motivated through it. I have several Leslie sansibe dvds and the walking to the hits have modern music and are way more fun.  I wanted to like this one but its not happening.,1520121600,,259,4.18
7126182,3,B00W85TAHE,Its a little much for older people as myself. If I didn't have RA it might not be so bad but I just cant go fast all the time!,1519776000,,126,3.3793103448275863
7126183,4,B00W85TAHE,"Hi, just wondering if anyone has had a problem with this cd playing on their laptop. It plays on my desktop but not my laptop.  I have several of Jessica's cd and they all play on both except this one.  I took my laptop to a computer repair and 3 different guys looked at it and could not figure out why this one will not play... they didn't even charge me because they were stumped!  I am just wondering if maybe this particular cd is damaged somehow.  Kinda bummed because it's one of my favorites... Should I just order another one and hope for the best?  thank you for your help.

Lori",1519344000,,589,4.214285714285714
7126184,5,B00W85TAHE,"This is a great workout for those who can't do high-impact aerobics.  I've had 3 ankle surgeries, so I need something that will not kill my foot. Jessica has a modified version that her mom does, and you can also lower the intensity (or simply walk in place).  There are 5 different workouts to choose from (Brain Booster, Belly, Buns, & Thighs, Power Posture, Turbo Charged, and Boogie Down) as well as a Warm Up and Cool Down. Each workout is about 15 minutes long and is equivalent to a mile of steps. You can choose just 1 workout (for 1 mile), 2 (for 2 miles), all the way up to 5 miles (if you're brave and can handle it!). You can pre-program the workout each time and select which workouts you want. The DVD will create an internal playlist and automatically play them, or you can just manually select. This resets each time you put the disc in, so you will have to program it each time (which takes about 5 seconds). It's great for altering your workouts so you have some variety and don't get bored. The steps aren't too hard to follow, and it's not too ""dancey.""  Some are faster paced than others (Turbo Charged), but most are pretty easy to follow.",1518739200,4,1161,4.390697674418605
7126185,5,B00W85TAHE,This is my all time favorite walking workout dvd.  I have five which includes Leslie Sansone and Debbie Siebers and Jessica Smith is my favorite instructor hands down.  I am 65 years old and have always been an avid exerciser.  Arthritis made it necessary for me to tone down the impact and I turned to the walking dvds to stay active without the high impact.  This workout is a total body workout and so much fun.  I have never written such a long winded review but wanted other shoppers to know that this workout is a good one.,1517616000,5,529,4.357142857142857
7126186,5,B00W85TAHE,"This is, by far, the best exercise dvd I have ever had!!  The segments are not too long or too short and the moves are constantly changing.  I love the  dance segment too.  Jessica  Smith is so awesome!  I like that you can arrange the segments the way you want to do them.",1516665600,2,273,4.056603773584905
7126187,5,B00W85TAHE,"This exercise DVD is a winner. Having a box filled with unused and unworkable programs, what a relief!  The program is sectioned into 15 - 20 minute rounds focusing on different outcomes, for example, Warm Up (5"" ), Brain Booster, Core, Cool Down (5"" ), and so on.  One of the most satisfying aspects of the DVD is that there is workable functionality that allows one to mix and match the segments, easily, or follow all the segments in whatever order desired.  Having hundreds of dollars of Brand X programs that barely operate at all, I can tell you this is a wonderful upgrade.
I am a 64 year old female golfer in middling condition needing movement to maintain flexibility in the winter months.  This program fits the bill.  It is challenging enough that one is fatigued but not so difficult that it will join the Brand X DVDs in the box never to be viewed again.",1516579200,9,867,4.496815286624204

7126189,5,B00W85TAHE,Either a beginner or a pro you will love this DVD! You are able to customize the workouts so if you only have time for one mile and a cool down thats all you have to do!! I highly recommend! She is so friendly and cheers you on along the way! Its hard to not be motivated!!,1515196800,2,273,3.807017543859649

7126193,5,B00W85TAHE,"I have Jessica's 6-week workouts and so her YouTube workouts as well. I usually do Leslie Sansone's walk videos. But I decided try this one too and am glad I did.

The first time I did the workout, I did the entire video which is 120 minutes. I got physically sick. I am in excellent cardiovascular shape, but that length of workout was just too long.

The next time I used the cool feature and picked the workouts I wanted in the order I wanted. I now do warmup, 3 miles and cool down. That is about a 50 minute workout.",1512691200,,521,4.148514851485149

I used to do high intensity exercises but stopped last year and have gained 10 lbs.  I'm 45 years old; I was looking for a low impact option & decided to try this. I wear a wrist heart rate watch & it says I burned 620 calories the first time I did this workout and 644 the second time I tried it (If you're familiar with heart rate watches, this was in the fat burning zone for me the majority of the time).  I normally burn about 400-450 when I walk outside for an hour so I'm really happy about this calorie burn.  I stuck to the low impact version most of the DVD.  I like that on days that I have less time I can customize the workout.  I like this so much I plan to buy more of her DVDs.",1511049600,5,860,3.9709302325581395

This walking-based video is a handy way to adjust your workout to your available time.  The walks are each 15 minutes (with a 5 minute warm up and 5 minute cool down to tack on each end).  Doing the entire series is a fabulous long workout, but picking and choosing one or a couple is an effective way to squeeze a workout into a short window.

I am in my mid-40s now and I simply can't do the super-tough workouts anymore...actually, it's not that I can't...it's that I really don't want to!  I have always been very fit and I have always worked out but I have come to realize over the years (as another reviewer stated), it is completely unnecessary to do these insanely hard workouts to get results...don't put yourself through that!!! All you need to do is watch what you eat (portion sizes!!) and exercise on a regular basis.  Working out should be like brushing your teeth:  it should be an everyday thing: even if it's short.  I have done every hard workout there is... P90X, TurboFire...you name it....but I'm just really tired of doing them - I also have the bad knees now to prove it - I want to do something for the sheer joy of doing it and I want to really enjoy my workouts...not dread them.  At this age, I deserve that!!  So, if you haven't tried this workout, do not hesitate to buy it....I am dripping sweat by the end of the 2nd fat-burning mile, thinking to myself: how did that happen?  All I was doing was walking!!  So it totally works to burn off those calories - You will love it and lose weight too!!

7126241,5,B00W85TAHE,"I'm a huge fan now of Jessica Smith's workouts!  I've had some very physically demanding jobs that have left me with some major knee, wrist, and feet problems at the ripe young age of 35.  Some improvement was made with Physical therapy, but my old methods of working out no longer work for me (running, yoga, any floor work exercises involving wrists).  I've gained probably close to 10 lbs in the last year.  I've experimented with all kinds of workouts, programs, and machines at the gym.  Some with great results, but led to worsening of my injuries- which then led to me giving up once again and gaining back inches on the waist.  Walking is just about the only thing left that I can do!  Even then, it can aggravate my feet.  Jessica Smith's workouts are safe, gentle, and so far seem effective for me.  They are improving my mood, keeping weight off, and helping me feel like I can get a workout in without injuring myself.  I love her online workouts too and just purchased the 21 day weight loss.  If you suffer from a lot of joint issues and pain in general- I highly recommend trying her workouts.  I also found the Viveca Jensen's first Piloxing dvd to be really good and gentler on joints.  Ballet Body by Leah Sarago is also really amazing for sculpting.  Jessica Smith is going to be my main go to for my workouts though!",1491955200,10,1336,4.466942148760331

Jessica talks too much, just like Leslie .... there is no music only option.  I realize these people need to give instruction when someone is doing it for the first time, but what I guess they don't realize is that 'we' have to listen to that same conversation day after day after day.  <sigh>  I felt like the movements were odd and the mile titles (Brain work, etc) wasn't what I was looking for.  I just want 5 miles of cardio w/ some blasts ... and the ability to add weights if I need more resistance.  Back to Leslie and her 'music only' option!",1490745600,7,685,4.230769230769231

7126253,5,B00W85TAHE,"Great walking DVD.  You get to choose how much time you wish to walk, which I really like since some days I don't have time to ""walk in place"" for 30 or 45 minutes, so I just do 15 minutes and find that can be enough when time is short.  The music is good and there is less talking which I like -- just a good workout.  I can highly recommend.  Jessica is very motivating too.",1489795200,,376,3.9078947368421053
7126254,5,B00W85TAHE,"I do love this DVD! I never thought I'd enjoy w-a-l-k-i-n-g... certainly not in place... in my own house. I got bored with the treadmill after a while. How could this be better?

I won't say that it's necessarily better (as you can do workouts on a treadmill too to jazz it up a bit), but it is great. I love that the workouts are only 15 minutes each. (That's actually what I searched for, short cardio workouts I could fit into my day.) They're varied, fun, and not too difficult for someone now in horrible shape, who hasn't done cardio in years.

For instance, I did the ""turbocharged mile"" and definitely could not do the intermediate level the entire time initially. But when I did it again the next week, I could.

(I will say that I've been suffering from adrenal fatigue, so need to get back into workouts slowly, so I don't undo my progress. With the megadose vitamin C I've just begun, I finally have energy to do things like this and not feel COMPLETELY washed out after. I don't feel I could have gotten to intermediate/advanced so quickly without the C.)

I like that these have three different modifications that depend on your fitness level, although they often don't vary a *whole* lot.

What I like most is that I love watching Jessica Smith. She's motivating, REAL, positive, and lovely to boot. I love watching her front-facing profile as she runs! I can't wait to get back to that svelte, toned fitness level.

I just ordered another of her DVDs. Couldn't wait!",1489449600,6,1482,4.552631578947368
7126255,4,B00W85TAHE,"I use walking DVDs to fill-in on Chicago days when even I won't go outside -- or to grab a quick ""walk"" while dinner is cooking, etc. I've used the Leslie Sansone series. I do like the segments in this one. They can be made more challenging with your own energy and gumption. It's a perk that no other equipment is requested (resistance bands or weights for example) and it's a whole body work out -- not just walking in place. I'm pretty fit, so in general it's not significantly challenging -- but I still think it's a great way to get in some exercise.",1489449600,2,555,4.295238095238095

7126261,5,B00W85TAHE,"Wow! They should have called this one shoulder shredder! Who would have thought a walking DVD could work the core and arms as well as this one did. First off let me start by saying that I am a Leslie fan and had been doing her for years, but I read the reviews on this and you know I had to try it! This is far more challenging and I couldn't help but giggle when I thought of Leslie trying to attempt some of these moves (the high impact ones of course)...lol. Anyhoo, this workout gives the user room to grow and it is quite invigorating. I only made it to mile four and I struggled to get to that. I can see the Turbo Charged mile (mile 4) being my favorite because it includes jumping jacks! The moves are creative and fresh while working different parts of the body. The day after I did the workout my back shoulders and arms were on fire, now imagine if I used light dumb bells or weighted hand gloves...serious arm work people! I am excited to see some results in about three months. I'm thinking this DVD with some sort of strictly strength training video (Jari Love perhaps?) will have my body in some sort of shape. I will give an update in about three months! Happy walking you guys.",1487894400,8,1194,4.241228070175438

I tried this DVD because the reviews were very positive. I just did the 5 miles. I love it! Jessica is just as sweet as Leslie. I don't think I will get tired of her as she is calm and motivating. She has a few of the same moves as Leslie, but many new moves! I am pretty advanced (usually do 5 miles in one workout), and I had sore muscles in places I never felt before the next day. I love Jessica's brain moves as well. It's so important to keep our brain as challenged as our body. You can also mix up the miles and do them in any order.

Jessica Smiths workouts are customizable and short. I do three per day equaling 45 minutes. The time flies and I really get a good sweat going. I'm out of breath but not the way I get with other crazy workouts. It's tolerable and challenging at the same time. Turbo Charge, Power Posture and Belly Butt and Thighs are my favorites. I've done this DVD for five weeks and I'm now moving on to another Jessica Smith DVD. I'm building endurance and I feel great after these workouts.

Also, I am not in that good of shape because I can never seem to stick to exercise goals. Walking seems to be the one manageable thing in my life I can stick to so I was going for extra long walks in the morning and started noticing some positive changes. But then winter hit and it was just too much effort to put on all those layers every morning (I'm telling you; I define lazy). So I hit up Amazon for a great walking dvd. This seemed to be the one with the highest reviews so I decided to get it and I'm really glad I did. I love the belly, buns and thighs workout and even though I have only done it three times I have started seeing those positive changes again as I was able to fit into a size 4 skirt today (I know size shouldn't matter, but it does) and my husband couldn't seem to stop complimenting my body tonight (even after eating lasagna for supper. And blueberry cobbler. And a Reeces cup. And some chocolate covered pretzels. Yes, I do hate myself for doing that. My stomach is hurting right now. I have no self-control.) Anyway, I digress.

You don't get 10,000 steps, I get about 6-7K on my Fitbit and that is because I never walk in place.  I do all 5 miles and it is a very good workout.",1481068800,2,253,3.6666666666666665

7126292,5,B00W85TAHE,"I've been a Leslie Sansone fan for many years and almost felt disloyal when I purchased this. But, I was ready to try something different. And I'm glad I did.

I just did a two mile walk: Brain Booster mile and Power Posture. The walking isn't that different; it's the moves that go with it. Jessica gives clear explanations about which muscles are being exercised and how to do it correctly. I am a convert!",1480550400,2,408,4.44
7126293,4,B00W85TAHE,"I like Jessica. She is obviously and genuinely passionate about what she does. I first discovered her videos on YouTube. Needing a bigger kick in the butt than Leslie Sansone (walking guru) currently creates, I bought this DVD. I like it, though I find her mother's obviously emotional discomfort in the video distracting (but that may only be me!) Exercise dvds are tricky because they are created to be played multiple times which make certain ""conversations"" that the instructors make in almost any video cringe - worthy as time wears on. This video is no exception. What is cute and funny at first listen becomes irritating by the 3rd time. I don't usually play this video all the way through. I usually put it in and do a couple miles to target my 10,000 step a day goal when my regular walks/ activities don't get me there. For that, it works. I also appreciate the greater range of motion and moves she has going here, which add a lot more variety than Leslie Sansone. Though, I love Leslie, once one masters the super easy moves she requires, we often no longer need or want to be coddled in the beginning of every one of her exercise dvds about how they are done. It becomes boring!",1480291200,2,1191,4.544186046511628

7126295,5,B00W85TAHE,"I just received Jessica's walking video, and I love it.  What makes this different from so many other walking videos is that it is clearly cross-training with a certified trainer.  Jessica impressed me in this tape, which was multi-level from beginner to advanced.  The extra two workouts along, for the feet and ankles, and for the hip joints, were worth more than the price of this video.  Jessica worked out all my muscle groups, but she also brought in the brain to the workout-- crossing the midline helps improve brain health.  I frequently did exercises like these in my special education classroom.  Being older, I needed this type of workout to keep my alertness and fire up those neurons.  I have done Leslie Sansone videos for years, and I love Leslie.  However, this workout was by far the best I have ever done.  I went through and did the whole set today-- all 5 miles plus the two additional workouts.  I feel great!",1479859200,4,931,4.656441717791411

I didn't get bored. I started with a warm up and the first workout. When I was sweating and ready to give up a clock popped up with a timer that counted down the remaining minutes. Amazing motivation to continue! The best bonus of this DVD is the extra bonuses for working on strength for your hips and ankles. Since I need that, it was perfect! I'm soon to be 50 and found that my workout level was slower than her mother's (back right) but still good enough to keep up. This is definitely a must for anyone that is just getting back into working out or may have problems with high intensity workouts. She keeps you motivated!",1479686400,6,799,4.2631578947368425

7126308,4,B00W85TAHE,"If you are looking for a mindless walking video this is not it. Jessica Smith knows how to engage the mind while working you out so you burn lots of calories and possibly lose some weight. I lost two pounds in a week from doing this DVD regularly. The trick is to do two walking workouts a day so you can pick about 30 minutes of exercise a day by combining two walking miles.

So this DVD has 5 walking miles that you can mix and match. It also has two bonus workouts.

I felt that Jessica Smith was positive all while not being annoying. Her cueing is excellent and she keeps you moving at a rapid pace. I could not always keep up with her and did at times need to modify the moves. This seems to have been created for people 20-45 and I'm nearing 50. If you struggle with balance issues or knee problems this may not be for you.

I will say if you are looking for something more intense and creative than a Leslie Sansone DVD this may make you very happy. The creativity is good and some of the moves I've never seen before in any walking workout. Also when the instructor is out of breath you know you are getting a good workout.

So I guess my favorite part of this DVD was the posture workout. That I would like to do once a week at least. I also felt these workouts engaged the arms a lot so you move a lot of lymph around and get a upper body workout too.

The Cool Down is also excellent and I really enjoyed it after each walking session. The stretches felt so good.

With motivational music, a with it instructor and lots of options for variety I think this is a good DVD that you will use again and again.

7126310,5,B00W85TAHE,I was looking for a lower impact workout that wasn't so hard on my knees. This routine seemed easy to do but let me tell you my muscles are screaming today!  I absolutely love the customizable DVD menu that goes right to the workout with no other ads or garbage to listen to in the beginning. So many of these DVDs make you watch the warnings and beginning greeting. That's fine for the first day but who wants to watch it every day if your making this a daily routine. I just want to do the workout and get on with my day so THANK YOU!,1477526400,6,536,4.056603773584905

7126312,2,B00W85TAHE,"There are five choices to pick from on the DVD, or you can customize which ones you wish to do, or you can do all five.  I must say the only one that I benefit from is mile 2, Belly, buns, and thighs walk.  The rest of these for me are not useful at all and quite frankly, I don't get some of them.  In mile 1, the Brain Booster walk I was moving my thumbs in and out.  In mile 3, Power Posture walk I was doing a ""chicken neck"" move.  I do like Jessica Smith I am a subscriber to her YouTube channel I guess I just thought this DVD would be more like her channel.",1476662400,4,564,3.7457627118644066

I have used many exercise programs and have never had this problem.  After trying to use this DVD repeatedly, I realized that it should not be this difficult. I tried to get help through email to amazon, thinking that I must be doing something wrong but has received no response, I'm assuming because it is pass the return date. I'm also wondering if this DVD is defective.

This is a great workout.,1475539200,,395,4.2105263157894735
7126324,4,B00W85TAHE,"Update: I've noticed that the beat of the music soundtrack sometimes does not sync to Jessica's moves. And sometimes the bass ""thrump"" beat does not sync with anything at all!  Confusing. Example: during the ""turbocharge"" segment, minute 6 thru 3.  I'm a drummer and sound guy . Perhaps the sound track was poorly dubbed later, or bad DVD or???  Outside of this issue, this is an excellent DVD. But the music must sync with the moves, at least for me.
This is our first Jessica Smith DVD and I must say we are VERY impressed! My wife and I have been ""walking"" to DVDs for several years since we moved to a lovely but rural area of California where there are no organized exercise classes like the ""Body Pump"" group class we so loved.  We have many ""walk"" genre DVDs by Leslie Sansone and Denise Austin. Those have been (are still are) excellent routines.  HOWEVER- this Jessica Smith DVD is right up there with their BEST!  Well-produced, high quality, and perfectly paced.  Jessica is motivating, likeable, and professional. Her routine hits a bulls-eye with the type of daily routine that SO MANY of us seek; ie, not ""EXTREME""...but challenging and effective. Many cool new moves, too.  We are adding Jessica's routines to our daily mix and are excited to have discovered this new alternative to mix it up!!!",1475452800,,1310,4.714912280701754

Have been using fitness trainer Leslie Sansone dvds for over 15 years and really enjoyed Jessica's dvd and will look for some others to try.

I've used dozens of workout DVDs over the years and these are perfect for me at this stage in my life which is older, but fit and in need of a low impact workout that is a good workout.  One of my favorite things, as simple as this is, the ability to easily select the tracks I want to play and no long wait for the DVD to start.

If you are someone who wants to workout without the high impact movements, I would definitely recommend this dvd. Even if you are someone who wants a little bit more of a higher impact movement, there is an option for you as well.

7126340,5,B00W85TAHE,"I purchased this product for my wife. Here is her review:
""I discovered Jessica Smith on Youtube during a winter storm which kept us snowed in for a couple of days. I needed something to do to get my steps in and instantly loved her workouts. I have done many of her online workouts but wanted to have more of a variety of her 15' minute miles to choose from so decide to buy this DVD and another (which I hahven't tried yet). I walk my dogs and do other workouts but sometimes need a little extra to get to my step goal and that is where these come in. The quality of the DVDs is better than the online workouts she offers and if you find Peanut annoying (which I don't) these are Peanut-free. Jessica is very likeable, not annoying at all and I have to say very imaginative. I have purchased and done other waking workouts and they were boring! They did the same moves over and over. Jessica may have some go to moves in between but she comes up with different moves that I have never done before. Every mile is truly different and I really don't know how she does it. I usually go for the higher intensity miles but I have to say my two favorite miles in this DVD are the brain booster mile and the posture one. I did the brain booster mile on a day that I didn't feel very good and had no energy to workout and it woke me up and made me feel good enough to do my usual workout so now I use it as a longer warm up. I did the Posture mile just to try it out and it has a lot of moves I haven't done before and even though it doesn't use weights and I do weights and work my upper body regularly she found a way to make my shoulders burn. Upon ordering the DVDs here on Amazon the products were received promptly and in excellent condition. If you are looking for low impact workouts to do to start working out again or just to add more activity to your day Jessica Smith is the way to go and this 5 mile DVD is excellent. Highly recommend this product and for you to visit her page and sign up to the community. You will receive motivation, advice and more workouts for free (not all are low intensity!) without feeling like they are pushing you to buy more products like others do.""",1474243200,3,2185,4.0955710955710956

7126342,5,B00W85TAHE,"This is one of the best, if not the best walking program I have ever experienced. It has every movement you need to get yourself back in shape. I love the brain booster walk, the belly, buns and thighs, the power walk, the turbo charged walk, etc. In short I love all of it. I don't have a favorite and I actually do all 5 miles on Saturdays. I like the variety it gives me so that I can look forward to something different in the next mile. My body gets challenged and I can feel it changing and becoming more strong everyday. It is so much fun and I feel refreshed and accomplished after I use any of the miles. This is a great workout to do with family and friends. I just love it.
Thanks Jessica for creating this workout. I hope you continue to create more like it.
Another great thing about it is that if you have planned to walk 10,000 steps a day, this has been done for you so that if you do not move again all day (you should of course!), at least you have reached your goal for the day. What a fun way to reach our goals.",1474070400,3,1032,4.014563106796117

7126351,5,B00W85TAHE,"Jessica's DVD's are always wonderful. I can't own enough of them. I find them pretty easy to follow, I get a great work out in the privacy of my family room and I love that she works out with her mother. I rarely use any other DVD's now, Jessica is my ""go to"" tape and I can't thank her enough for making a great workout for all ages. I'm 64 so this really means a lot!!",1473552000,,370,3.8815789473684212
7126352,5,B00W85TAHE,"Not your run of the mill walking workout. Amazingly creative and fun! Each mile is so different and varied that it keeps you interest and motivated. I am an intermediate/advanced exerciser, and still thoroughly enjoy this DVD. Jessica has perfect cuing, an upbeat attitude and it makes you feel like you are working out there with her. Great options to mix and match the miles. I am so glad I found Jessica's workouts! I can get great cardio without destroying my knees like the classes at the gym. You won't be disappointed!",1473379200,4,525,4.717391304347826

7126356,5,B00W85TAHE,"I love Jessica Smith.  I have tried way too many DVDs out there, as I hate going to the gym since none of their classes seem to fit my schedule.  Jessica knows how to count and how to cue! And, not only is there usually a person showing how to modify, she is always telling you, if you have  knee problem or shoulder problem do this or that.  Very helpful for those of us who can't do everything we want to anymore.  I have never yet been disappointed with one of her workouts.",1473120000,,477,4.086021505376344
7126357,5,B00W85TAHE,"I've used other walking videos and I've been a fan of a particular one for a very long time.  I decided to try a different brand, and found that I love Jessica Smith's style even more than my other ones.  Jessica Smith adds a lot more 'arm work' and is more fast pace, than the other videos I've been using, and I love that about this one.  This one has 9 segments on it.  You can choose which ones you want to do and in which order, and it plays them just the way you want.  There are days I just want a quick, easy, workout, so I'll set it to do the warm up (5mins) & the cool down (5mins), and that's it for a quick 10 minute workout.  If I want a harder workout, then I'll set it to do the warm up (5mins), Turbo charge walk (13mins), boogie down walk (15mins) & the cool down (5mins), for a good 38 minute workout.  Each walking segment is 15 minutes except for the 4-mile which is 13mins.  If you do them all (without the 2 bonus segments 15 min ea) you'll have a 5 mile, 83 minute workout.  I've always had week ankles and painful feet, so I love the bonus segment of 'Strong Feet & Ankles' workout (15mins).  I purchased this DVD just for that, and glad to finally see someone address the issue of feet & ankles.",1473120000,4,1220,4.045833333333333
7126358,5,B00W85TAHE,"Great workout, good variation, definitely not boring and a good physical challenge. I have been doing Leslie Sansone for years now and  I love her. She allows truly uncoordinated people like me the opportunity to workout and not feel awkward. Jessica is great, too. She takes things to a bit higher level yet it is very doable. I don't feel intimidated or uncomfortable with any of her moves. For people like me who like simple but effective workouts, she is fabulous. She is encouraging, calm and not overly chatty. She cues well and provides good routines without confusing or difficult moves. I like that I customize the DVD how I would like it. I am so happy to add this to my rotation. Definitely worth the price.",1473033600,2,718,4.653543307086614
7126359,5,B00W85TAHE,I am very happy with this video. The miles go by very quickly and get a good work out. I will definitely order more of Jessica's videos.,1472947200,,136,4.074074074074074
7126360,5,B00W85TAHE,"I used to speed walk 5 miles a day until my plantar fasciitis became too painful.  After not walking or exercising for almost 8 months hoping it would heal with physical therapy, it did not and I need to exercise.  I found that the best thing for Plantar Fasciitis was to strengthen your foot muscles and correct your hip strength.  I found this dvd with a special healthy feet and hips and knees section, so I bought it.  I started with these sections and then added in more of the miles.  I have gone from hobbling around the house to be able to complete 2 miles without pain!!!!  I am looking forward to adding in more miles as my feet, hips and knees get stronger.  It helps by strengthening my weak muscles and by staying more on the balls of my feet when exercising rather than pounding on my heels like I did when I walked outside.  I am very happy to be exercising again and even more so to be walking with out pain!",1472860800,8,924,4.24
7126361,5,B00W85TAHE,"I absolutely love this DVD.  Although it focuses on walking, the movements are varied and involve your whole body with a lot of upper body movements which I really like.  I have a desk job in front of a computer day after day and therefore my posture suffers.  The stretching involved in this DVD is therefore most welcome. This is the first DVD I have used from Jessica Smith but it will definitely not be the last.  I hope to purchase others to use in my workouts.",1472688000,,466,4.32183908045977

7126368,4,B00W85TAHE,"I was pleasantly surprised with this DVD.  As a Leslie Sansone's fan I was not expecting it to be as good or maybe even better than Leslie's.  From the brain booster walk to the Turbo charged walk, it keeps you on your toes. My favorite part is that you  can create your own walking adding how many miles and which ones you would like to do that day. I really love it.",1472083200,,368,4.083333333333333
7126369,5,B00W85TAHE,I love this workout!  I get up and do this exercise before I head into work. I work up a great sweat and I get a jump start on my steps. I like the fact that it is the recommended 5 miles a day that you need and plus I add to it my moving throughout my day and workout again after work.  I would recommend this video to anyone who wants to get moving and exercise for health benefits. It is fun and easy to follow!  Thanks Jessica!,1471910400,,431,3.8202247191011236

7126371,5,B00W85TAHE,"This is a really fun workout, with each mile a different kind of walk and rarely repeating the same moves. It's also easy to program different miles if you don't want to do all five at the same time, or in the same order each time. I especially like the way it targets parts of the body - the neck and shoulders, knees and hips, glutes and abs, etc. The miles seem a lot faster that approximately 15 minutes each. These miles are very good for exercisers that are a) needing low-impact moves, b) are bored with other DVDs, c) older, but consistent exercisers. I'm 61 and have been working out for a long time, but just can't do a lot of the higher-impact moves anymore. I really love this DVD and Jessica, too.",1471824000,,710,4.3059701492537314

They are good but this takes it up several notches. The next day, I actually felt like I exercised. I can feel my muscles are a bit sore and have been used properly. Also, there is no one repeating ""walk, walk, walk, walk"". This is a great workout! And the modifications are great! ANYONE can do this dvd.",1471305600,2,459,4.2272727272727275

7126381,5,B00W85TAHE,"This has been a good starting workout for me as someone who has worked out very little the past few years.  I like that you are able to vary the level of workout with the ability to customize each workout to your needs and preference.

There is plenty of variation so it is impossible to be bored.  You will not feel as though you were just walking the entire time.

Jessica is very encouraging and her detailed instructions are much appreciated.  Definitely recommend!",1471219200,,469,4.602409638554217

I always appreciate that each workout includes low impact or a more challenging demonstration (Mom Debbie or Jessica's friend). Jessica is fun and breezy as always. I do like the other DVD I own that has the workout is outdoors, but I'm okay with the indoor set used here. It's just not as entertaining as seeing boats go by. ;)  All in all, this is a fun walking DVD, Jessica is never boring, I always feel better after a session with her!",1471219200,,570,4.327102803738318

I have never been a workout fanatic or one that loves drill sergeant style workout routines...  There has to be something out there for people who want a great workout that doesn't destroy your joints in the process, Lol.  I have found that balance in the walking workouts that Jessica Smith provides!  I love that all of the exercises are modified, so that you can tailor each move to your fitness level.

It's like walking with friends.  It's fun, effective, and upbeat!  I walked/jogged regularly for 2 years after my child was born 42 years ago until chased by a mugger and became too afraid to go alone.  My figure and weight went from terrific to terrible over the decades with occasional periods of ""Okay, not great"" so I knew walking would get me back to being comfortable with my body. I've had tapes with music to use with ear buds while walking outside -- also easy to skip doing.  With Jessica, I can hardly wait to join her, Beth and Debbie each day.  I'm working up from 1 mile to all 5 -- not there yet but I know I will make it!  Very pleased with this DVD!",1470873600,5,1031,4.333333333333333

The first mile in this program is a thinker - at first I thought ""this is stupid"" but realized that it's working on my balance, coordination and ability to react physically and is actually very important and not something I've seen in other videos.  Each mile has a little bit different personality to it and keeps it interesting.  I love being able to chose a combination of segments and they queue right up.

I think the transition to Jessica Smith workouts is smooth because of similar moves, but also challenging because of some the differences, such as the arm movements.  You can work up a pretty good sweat and burn a lot of calories, particularly when you amplify your movements.

This is exactly what I was looking for: low impact, interesting but not overly complicated routines that help people ease into a healthy exercise regimen that is fun to do.  I really like the fact that you can tailor the routines so you're not doing the same thing every day and as you get fitter you can add extra routines (extra miles) to your daily walk.  You can begin with the simple warm up, followed by a one of the five mile routines available and then complete with the slow down routine that provides some good stretching exercises to your warmed muscles to encourage flexibility.  Jessica is a lively and encouraging instructor and her assistants:  Beth and Debbie offer alternative levels of impact to meet the needs of the participants.  Debbie provides more bounce to the steps for those who want a little more impact to their routine.  Beth provides a gentler approach for those of us who are passed our bouncy days.

With instruction beginning slowly should be promoted.  I am 80 years young and an everyday 10k walker, looking for an alternative method.  This is more strenuous than brisk walking, which is good, but I needed to ease into it until I could keep up the pace!!  Overdid when I jumped right into it.

7126420,5,B00W85TAHE,I just got this DVD and was planning on doing one 15 minute walk but it was so much fun I did three!  Would have done all five if I had had the time.  I added soft hand weights which upped the intensity slightly.  I'm in my 50's and have achy knees but this didn't seem to bother them.  I'm in very good shape and still got sweaty and red in the face!  Love it!,1468195200,,361,3.76

There are  5 miles to walk plus two Bonus sessions. I really enjoy this DVD because it involves more than just basic walking. Jessica performs a variety of moves to get you flexing in all directions. This DVD is not intense at all, but you are guaranteed to work up a sweat!!! The 15 minute sessions are GREAT, because you can customize the workouts based on the time that you have and your desire or lack of desire to work out that day...everyone has 15 minutes and you have '5' 15 minutes to choose from!! I will be buying more Jessica Smith DVDs.",1468108800,9,684,4.181818181818182
7126423,5,B00W85TAHE,Fun with options for intensity (you can make the work-out easier or harder as you please).  Great to have the variation in work-outs by mile.  Makes getting more steps in easier (but not easy).  Love that her mother is exercising with her.

Jessica and friends are a great source of commradary while working out. One thing I would like to see is the music be a little louder in the background. I enjoy having Jessica's instructions coming out clear, but the music gives me added energy to work out with.",1467936000,,370,4.3768115942028984

7126431,5,B00W85TAHE,"I think using exercise videos for  over 20 years. Believe me, I have tried them all. Some have been great and some have been real duds.  I have been super hesitant about buying these ""walk"" videos because I always thought they would be too low impact, boring or for people who ate advanced in age. How completely wrong I was! How completely wrong I was! I decided to try one of Jessica's  workouts because I really wanted to be sure to get my 10,000 steps in per day.  What an unexpected surprise. Not only was the workout challenging, but it was fun and went by fast. I have since purchased more and have been really happy with all of them. These videos  Are great for anyone Beginner to advanced. I would say if you were looking for something that is super high intensity, then this is not for you.  I love how she has her mom showing the modified moves.  I'm definitely going to buy more of her videos. Love them",1467849600,2,915,4.315789473684211

7126433,5,B00W85TAHE,"Jessica Smith is simply the best out there today. I get a good workout that is back and knee friendly and she puts a positive spin on it. There is no demanding trainer voice, skimpy outfits, or extreme moves that end up causing injury. I am collecting all of her videos.",1467676800,,270,4.313725490196078

7126435,5,B00W85TAHE,"Fantastic indoor cardio ""walks"". She offers a lot of options for beginner, intermediate, or advanced levels, as usual, and some new combinations of moves.  I am always impressed with her DVDs! What I particularly like about this one is that you can customize the workout in the menu to do all five of the segments or just a couple of them and you do not have to go through a warm up and cool down during each segment because they are also separate.",1467590400,,448,4.397590361445783
7126436,5,B00W85TAHE,I saw your walking videos on YouTube. I really like when instructors are by their selves. Because then they are focus on the work out and not to busy explaining what the other people are doing in the video. To me that's a lot of extra talking. Do you have any walking videos where you are by yourself ?,1467504000,,302,4.135593220338983

7126438,5,B00W85TAHE,"I found this to be equal in intensity to a couple of Lesley Sansone's advanced ones, however, this was more entertaining. I take 2 classes 4 days a week at a gym and will use this DVD on my off days. I got this DVD a few days ago and have used it once. There are 3 alternative levels for each mile; I like the intense one. There is one 'Super-charged' mile that challenged me. Some of the exercises were new to me, always a plus. I would recommend this for everyone as the 3 levels are perfect. I expect to be purchasing more of these DVDs.",1467417600,,540,4.05607476635514

Jessica is a veteran in the fitness industry. She knows what works and her cueing and instructions is spot on. I lift weights, kickboxing, and other cardio workouts but I will add this in my rotation.

This is also great if you have bad knees",1467244800,,410,4.061728395061729

I am always curious about how people do with fitness DVD's so I want to share my personal experience with you. I started with the warm up and finished with the cool down. The whole process took 1 hour, 21 minutes. According to my Polar watch, I took 9762 steps and burned 700 calories. I wore the Polar watch immediately before the workout because I was really curious about the steps. I think this DVD is very useful for anyone who wants to exercise at home. I personally think this kind of exercise better than treadmills and other cardio equipment because everything you do, you do by using your own body. Therefore, I would suggest this DVD to anyone who is into this kind of training.",1467158400,3,757,4.414285714285715

Love the effectiveness of the workouts, the Florida scenery and feel in the background, and the great pair of ladies who back her up to show more and less intense variations.  I've been doing Jessica's workouts for about eight weeks and have really felt a difference already in my strength and stamina, as compared to the Sansone workouts I was doing before.  Jessica is very encouraging, sometimes exactly when you need her to be to help you keep going.  Love her YouTube channel too!

While it is definitely low impact, there are a couple of options that involve a light jog--so, if you're up to it, do it. My favorite mile is the Boogie Down walk. It combines walking with a few salsa steps to get your body moving--it is quite fun. Get it and you'll see what I mean. Also, one of the great things about Jessica approach, is that she is a great lead--she really does prompt you well in advance when she is going to change the move. Overall, a definite keeper!",1466035200,6,566,4.299065420560748

7126461,5,B00W85TAHE,"I had never done a Jessica Smith exercise video, though I have many excellent videos from a variety of instructors with a wide variety of exercise types.  What was I waiting for?  Today I tried this video and did all 5 miles, because I am already fit and excercise regularly.  It was long, but so much fun that the time flew by!  Every mile was different but very well instructed and I thought easy to follow.  The instructor is very upbeat and positive but not at all annoying.  The music is truly background, with a strong beat you can follow, but there are no recognizable tunes or words to distract you.  Each mile has a different purpose, including stimulating your brain as you exercise.  There are only three people on the video--Jessica, her mom, and another female friend.  There is always one person doing the less strenuous, lower impact move that you can follow.  There are a couple of bonus workouts specifically targeting strengthening the knees and hips and feet and ankles, 15 minutes each, but I did not try them.  The miles can also be chosen for a customized workout, if you want to do some miles one day and some another, but I did not use that option.  If you are tired of a boring indoor walking program, I would definitely recommend this for variety, sound instruction, and a safe, doable workout.  I did not find anything objectionable about this program.  I purchased this video at full price, and was not given any promotional consideration to review it.",1465862400,,1480,4.642307692307693

7126463,5,B00W85TAHE,"I was surprised at how much I absolutely love this workout video. I have a hard time finding any exercise or workout that I don't feel crappy afterwards. For the longest time, I thought the whole ""exercise gives you energy!"" thing was a conspiratorial lie thin people told to make chronically fat people like me feel bad while they secretly snickered behind their palms. I NEVER felt good after ANY workout--just tired, sweaty, gross, and feeling like I need to lie down for a while.

This is the first time I've ever looked forward to working out. And yes, I genuinely feel energetic and good after this workout. It's nice to be able to pick and choose the miles in any order or any variety I want. My two favorite miles are the Turbo-charged mile, and most definitely the posture mile. The posture mile in particular has been life-giving to me. I have terrible posture, thanks to a combination of a heavy rack that gravity constantly pulls down on (goddammit Newton!), and also that I am on a computer like 12 hours a day at least, on average. I was well on my way to being the Hunchback of Notre Portland. With the posture walk, though, I feel so much relief in my lower back especially, and doing this mile constantly also makes me very aware of how I'm sitting while at the computer.

Jessica is goofy and energetic and sometimes I want to stuff a sock in her mouth because I feel she's WAAAYYY too peppy and able to chatter while I'm gasping for breath. But she's actually pleasant, and not overly annoying. She's very encouraging during the video.

I'll be buying more of Jessica's walking videos, just to stir it up a bit and not get bored in the long run, but I really do enjoy this one, and highly recommend it.",1465776000,4,1721,4.474522292993631

I love the fact that Jessica contacted me after I placed my order to send her best wishes.

I'm 57 years old and overweight and it's been hard to find exercise programs that are challenging and yet don't aggravate my joints. Jessica's pace is fast enough to really get my heart going and she switches the exercises around so that my knees aren't sore the next day. I've been using this DVD for 2 weeks and have already noticed a difference in my energy level, balance and body tone. She has enough variety in her routines that I don't get bored and she is encouraging without being too chatty. I have been doing 2 or 3 of the miles every day and feel like she manages to work just about every muscle.",1465430400,3,665,4.285714285714286

I thought, because it is ""walking,"" that it might not be much of a workout, but each mile segment is different and challenging in its own way.

I work from home, so I can do one mile in the morning before work, one mid morning (good to stand up and move about!), one at lunch, one mid afternoon and one right after work. Bam! I've got my 10,000 steps in so anything I do after work is icing on the cake. I also like the fact the clock does not appear on the screen of each mile until you're at the half way mark.

She's very upbeat without being annoyingly perky, and talks about being healthy and strong rather than sexy or bikini-ready Her mom, Debbie, and friend Beth work out with her; the 15 minute workouts are easy to fit in, and they cover a lot, including Brain Booster, Belly, Buns and Thighs, Power Posture,Turbo Charged Walk,and Boogie Down Walk. There are 2 ""bonus"" segments dedicated to strengthening the knees/hips, and the feet/ankles. I was glad that that the countdown clock did not appear on the screen until the workout was half over. I do miss seeing her French Bulldog, Peanut, who appears in some of the online workouts, but found this DVD very motivating.",1464912000,4,742,4.896825396825397
7126474,5,B00W85TAHE,"I love the Walk ON series. Jessica Smith is great.  I own several of her DVDs, which are all fantastic.  I have the 15 Minute Fast Fat Blasts, the 21 Day Weight Loss Plan, and the 10,000 Steps Weight Loss DVDs, as well as her Stretching DVD and Total Body Balance DVD.  It is great for me, as I have found it is good to take a break from the jumping up and down on some of my other DVDs.  My knees would ache by the end of the evening after a workout.  Sometimes even an Epsom salt bath did not seem to help my soreness.  Coupling the walking DVDs with the stretching DVD, I have moved these DVDs to the top of my workout regimen. Jessica gives you a real workout without placing a lot of stress on your knees.  Sometimes I don't even feel like Im exercising, as I am having more fun again. Jessica is truly helping me enjoy exercising and total body and mind balance.",1464825600,3,868,4.100591715976331

7126477,5,B00W85TAHE,"I just tried this dvd 2 days ago, and I love it!  This was my first time using a Jessica Smith dvd (I've been a Leslie Sansone fan for years).  Jessica has a great, upbeat personality.  Each mile on the 5 mile walk is so unique so you don't get bored.  I definitely got my heart beat up and sweat quite a lot after doing all 5 miles.  At the same time, I really felt like everything was safe on my joints.  I can't wait to check out more of Jessica's videos!",1464739200,,458,3.9239130434782608
7126478,5,B00W85TAHE,"As an avid outdoor/indoor walker, I'm always looking to add new movements and steps to my routine.  This DVD offers a great variety of workouts - they can be as strenuous as you want to make them but beginners can do them, too.  I especially enjoy the ""Brain Booster"" segment - challenging and fun!  This is a perfect mix of walking activities for any time of the day!",1464566400,2,368,4.382352941176471
7126479,5,B00W85TAHE,"I have done the Leslie Sansone Walking videos before, but Jessica Smith is so much better.  I was working up a sweat almost immediately.  The mile segments were over before I knew it.  The video is faced paced and it is great that she has her mom, Debbie, help in the video.  Shows anyone can do it. I love the Brain Booster (shows how uncoordinated I am), the Belly, Buns and Thighs, Posture segment, Turbo Charge (be prepared to work up a really good sweat) and the Boogie Woogie Segment.  Jessica made each segment fun. I haven't tried the bonus segments yet, but plan to soon. I would recommend this video to everyone who is interested in a change of pace.",1464566400,3,660,4.421487603305785

I was looking for a way to kick my workout into a higher gear and this little gem has done the trick.  I like that you can switch up the workouts for different body parts, do 1-5 miles with each work out as you choose, and need minimal space or equipment in order to do this.  I work out in front of my desk early in the morning before anyone else gets to work.  Each mile is about 15 minutes long so I can do a couple miles and have time for a stretching tape.  I add a resistance stretching tape, (Dara Torres) or a short pilates tape, (Winsor for Flexibility and Strengthening) after this one and I am good to go.",1463616000,5,713,4.064285714285714

I have been doing Leslie Sansone's for the past 10 years and is ready to advance to your more upbeat workouts.  I have since acquired more than ten of your videos and have been recommending them to my friends, and as a matter of fact, sending them as gifts, and receiving very positive response.  Thank you, Jessica, your workout DVDs are very helpful and fun to work with.  They keep me in shape and strengthen my body, especially my legs.",1463443200,,615,4.407079646017699

It usually gets me to around 9500 steps.  I really appreciate the bonus workout for the feet... these step videos can really work the feet hard, so it's nice to finish off with something just for the feet that helps prevent soreness.",1463270400,,378,4.371428571428571

When we finished the first 2 15-minute sections, we were dripping with sweat (a good thing!), felt great, looked at each other and said ""I REALLY LIKE THIS ONE!""  Jessica is always clear and encouraging in her videos, and this one incorporates a lot of new moves we've never seen in any other video.  SO not boring!  Walking dvds usually fall into the same old rut of steps, but not this one!",1463097600,,517,4.288659793814433

She comes across as sincerely interested in motivating us to do our best, no matter what our level of fitness may be.  This video has easier and more challenging segments on it, but you can Aldo make any segment more challenging by following Beth, who takes the moves to the highest level.  Jessica's mom does the low impact version and Jessica is somewhere in the middle.  I also like the fact that you can do these videos at any age. And, because the walks are in 15 minute segments, they are easy to fit into your day.",1462665600,2,593,4.3545454545454545

I discovered Jessica's videos while recovering from major foot surgery.  I was looking for something that would challenge me with low impact.  This video is both.  is love the fact that it's customizable so I can pick and choose on days when my schedule is busy.  A great video for anyone but especially for those just getting started or who want a workout not as hard as some of the others.

7126516,5,B00W85TAHE,"Hello Jessica and Support team!

Just wanted to give feedback on the dvd after I tried it out. I will also post this email on reviews for everyone to see :)

Here is my stats:
Febuary 2016 : 288.6 lbs
April  2016 today: 251.6lb

I am currently on Jenny Craig program, and was using Leslie Sansone's Walk away the pounds Ultimate edition to slowly work my way up to 4 miles.  Now that I have reached that goal and the 4 mile has become easy. I started to look for something, more challenging with more arm work included. That is when I stumbled across your Dvd collections, and instantly was excited to give you 5 mile 10,000 steps a try! I read quite a few of the reviews, and even went onto Youtube to check out previews of this Dvd. I was pleasantly surprised to see you actually talking with people and encouraging them, providing excellent care and service. So I grabbed it and tried it out same day!

I will say coming off of the Leslie Dvd, to your 5 mile was quite the challenge, but not so hard I felt like giving up after half way. You give great encouragement and provide two other ways to do the exercise so I did not get discouraged. Also  the added timer towards the end of each mile was just what I needed to give myself a boost when things got a little intense at the end!

It is next day now and I can feel my arm muscle and inner groin muscles a little sore from the workout :) I intend to do your dvd every other day until I can manage to do it every day!

Thank you so much for giving me a positive way to lose weight without feeling too intimidated by the workouts. I have a long way to go still on my weight loss journey but would like to keep my review updated as I continue to use your dvd's to help with my lifestyle changes.

Sincerely ,
 Angela",1461542400,55,1770,4.116279069767442
7126517,5,B00W85TAHE,I bought this on a whim and it is very motivating and great for getting in my extra steps!  My favorite part is the countdown timer--I wish all walking videos would incorporate this--it keeps me motivated! Will definitely be looking at more of Jessica's videos in the future.,1461456000,,275,4.729166666666667

7126521,5,B00W85TAHE,This DVD has been great to try it is loe impact as well as challenging I had a stroke two years ago can't walk yet but can step so with this handicap I can move more. This had also helped my oxygen intake and lung capacity. Feels great was looking for way to increase steps daily I feel I have been helped by your DVD to do it. Thanks alot. Hope others find the same.,1461196800,,367,3.9066666666666667

7126523,5,B00W85TAHE,"Although I walk every morning I generally do not get my 10,000 steps in so bought the DVD to supplement this walk and to also have in inclement weather.  I really like it and am enjoying using it, finding the music, steps, and arms movements to be exactly what I was looking for.  I try to do 1 or 2 of the miles every afternoon which gives me 1,500 to 3,00 extra steps a day.  Jessica is just the right amount of fun and cheeriness.  I have already recommended this DVD to two of my friends.  I am retired so have the time, but also believe a working person would find this easy to work in a busy schedule.  I recommend this.  A great exercise option.",1461024000,4,652,4.126984126984127
7126524,5,B00W85TAHE,"I really liked it.  First time I've used one of your workouts so I wasn't very coordinated, but I got through it all.

7126525,5,B00W85TAHE,"I haven't viewed the entire video, but what I have worked out to is great.  I love Jessica's DVDs and YouTube workouts; she is an amazing instructor and offers such a huge range of workout types.  I teach aerobics and strength three days a week and love this walking workout as an alternative to high impact, high intensity.  You work hard, can walk up to five miles, but don't feel battered afterward.

Jessica is so delightful and real; this video features her mom and a friend and she usually is accompanied by her dog, Peanut, in her YouTube videos.  No yelling, no skimpy workout gear, just a great instructor who does the ENTIRE workout (unlike Jillian Michaels) and genuinely cares that she is motivating others to lead a healthy lifestyle.  I am looking forward to completing this entire workout and the bonus features.",1460937600,2,827,4.748251748251748
7126526,5,B00W85TAHE,So far so good. I love the fact that it is not so intense like other exercise programs. It's just right for those who want to shed pounds but not get injured in the process.,1460678400,,173,3.9714285714285715

I have always has the desire to work our daily, but I don't join the gym and the park where I jog is too far away. I love this dvd, especially when she does high impact walking.  It's really like aerobics. This is worth the money.",1460505600,,316,3.8615384615384616
7126529,5,B00W85TAHE,"Today was the first time I used this dvd and it was great. I own a couple of Leslie Sansone dvds but I always end up muting her and turning on my own music, her constant chatter is really annoying. Jessica talks quite a bit but it's in relation to what she is doing and it's nice and cheerful. I only did the first 3 miles along with the warm up and cool down, and I found it to be a lot more varied than the other walking dvds I have used. This is a great way to get in your steps or get in a low impact workout on your rest days. I also really like that you can pick and choose which miles you want to do instead of having to do all or go mile by mile.",1460332800,3,654,3.6785714285714284
7126530,5,B00W85TAHE,"I really like this dvd, it's easy to follow and fun.  I don't think I'll get bored with it.  My daughter and I will start slowly and work our way up to 5 miles.",1460332800,,160,3.676470588235294

I have arthristis so this work out works great for me.  Thanks Jessica.  I can't wait to try out more of your videos.,1460246400,,272,4.38
7126532,5,B00W85TAHE,I am so glad I bought this Walk On DVD; it has 5 miles all done with a different focus and the ability to choose which mile you want to do and in any sequence you choose. It's fabulous! I have incorporated this DVD into my daily exercise routine and I love how she gets the whole body involved- no boring walk-in-place routine here!,1460246400,,332,4.203125
7126533,5,B00W85TAHE,I've only walked 2 mlles with Jessica & friends but love the change and challenge.  I don't like walking alone so Jessica is fun company and her voice doesn't get on my nerves.  I'm still extremely over weight so I'm hoping Jessica's DVD's are gong to help me along with diet.,1460246400,,276,4.392156862745098
7126534,5,B00W85TAHE,"I have come to the conclusion that I am a measurer. I like measurements by time, distance, calories burned, and now steps. I really really really like measuring my steps because they are small and they add up fast. That being said you probably can gather that I love this type of workout. Steps.  Miles. Time calculated on screen while you are working out.  I say working out instead of walking because this routine is much more than just walking and the step count per mile is between 1,600 and 2,000.  Move over Leslie Sansone, there's a new kid on my shelf of walking and step dvds and she is taking over.  Jessica is by far my favorite instructor.  She is all business and pleasure - and a pleasure that she is all business but her enthusiastic energy shines through every moment.  She is tough and fun at the same time. And SMART!  And CREATIVE! Who ever thought of having a brain- teaser- walk- routine?
I am 66 years old and I can keep up with Jessica who shows intermediate impact moves while she explains the routine, her mom who shows low impact moves and her friend who shows high impact moves. However, I think I am sweating more and breathing out - alot. I am sure I don't look pretty like they do, but who is watching? The background is very white because the room they are in is all white and near the beach I think. I like this because sometimes you can see shadows on the floor. For some reason I can't hear much music but I do not have high tech equipment. If you have a fitbit (you know I do) you will love watching the steps multiply on your screen! I love Jessica and this DVD!",1460073600,,1598,4.289036544850498

7126536,5,B00W85TAHE,"This is my first Jessica Smith video & it won't be my last. I have 22 Leslie Sansone videos, & I like her a lot, but sometimes the moves are monotonous & Leslie's chattiness can get on my nerves. Jessica is FANTASTIC! No small talk, just excellent motivation & cuing. There's such a variety of fun & challenging moves. Jessica makes it fun! This is a good workout for beginner or advanced exercisers, as modifications for all levels are offered. Highly recommend.",1459900800,9,463,4.658536585365853

7126538,5,B00W85TAHE,What I like most about this walking workout is that it is a little different than the one's that I do already.  Different movements make it seem more like an aerobics class with walking.  The solid white room and glaring sun made it less appealing to look at but over all I enjoyed this workout and will use it in between my other work outs for variety.,1459814400,,353,4.253731343283582
7126539,5,B00W85TAHE,"This 5 mile walk is a fantastic way to get my 10,000 steps in for the day. I am an author and I'm forced to sit for several hours a day so I needed a way to get my steps in. This fits the bill! It really got my heart rate up and definitely had me sweating for the full 85 minutes. I like that it's low impact too. I needed something that wouldn't hurt my knees.",1459728000,,361,3.7012987012987013
7126540,5,B00W85TAHE,"I love Jessica Smith's YouTube workouts (Hi, Peanut!) and already owned ""Walk On: 5 Fat Burning Miles"" and ""Walk On: 3 DVD Super Set"" when I bought this one.  The foot conditioning workout drew me in because I do a lot of walking and stepping workouts but neglect my feetsies all the time.  However,  I was pleasantly surprised by the Power Posture walk included on this DVD.  I  feel like most exercise gurus shunt the upper body aside on their walking exercises, but not so on the Power Posture walk!

I also enjoy the feature to customizing the different miles and which order you do them in.
I consider myself an upper intermediate exerciser (been doing a lot of different vids for years, but I'm not about to win any contests or anything!) in good condition,so for me, this DVD is more for recovery days (except maybe the Turbo Charged walk!).",1459728000,,848,4.582781456953643

7126542,5,B00W85TAHE,"I am 57 years old and up until last year, was always active including walking, jogging and exercise dvds.  Some back and neck problems caused me to see a chiropractor.  Now, I have started exercising again.  I found some of Jessica's video on youtube and enjoyed them and decided to purchase the 10,000 Steps.  I just love it!!  I love the fact that she sends you an email after you purchase her dvds and you can send back emails if you would like to ask questions.  I did the entire dvd the first day that i received it..but with some modifications as not to hurt my neck.  Jessica is easy to listen to.  I did Leslie Sansones  dvds and vcr exercises for many many years.  Though I loved her, I always wanted more of a workout.  Jessica includes moves I have not seen in other exercise videos.  You work your whole body. If you want more than just a walking back and forth or the same walking routine, then this is the dvd for you.  I am so happy that I purchased this dvd.  And...it does give you your 10,000 steps!",1459555200,4,1017,4.2565445026178015

7126546,5,B00W85TAHE,"I enjoyed this DVD.  I like the feature that allows me to choose what work-out I want to do.  The work-out was more intense than a prior walking DVD that I have used.  I also liked that the music was not overpowering Jessica.  The two additional bonus work-outs are also nice.  I enjoyed the one for the feet and ankles.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes to walk - perfect for when the weather is not so nice outside, or an early morning energizer before work.",1459468800,,470,4.284090909090909
7126547,5,B00W85TAHE,"I purchased this DVD along with Jessica's Walk On:15-Minute Fast Fat Blasts DVD.  Both are the first of Jessica's DVDs that I have ever purchased, and I've already used them every day since I got them.  In this DVD, Jessica is energetic and makes exercising fun. One woman (Jessica's mother) does lower impact moves which is great in keeping up with newer moves I've never done before.  The other woman does higher impact moves for moves that I'm familiar with. Jessica keeps you moving so each 15 minute segment goes fast.  I'm finding myself moving on to another segment.  I like the short 15 minute segments along with the five minute warm up and cool down segments so that I can do a quick 15 minutes of exercise plus warm up and cool down on a busy day and on days where I have more time I can add additonal 15 minute segments.  I like being able to play the segments in any order I choose so that I won't get bored doing the same workout everyday.  I will definitely be using this DVD a lot and will be purchasing more of Jessica's exercise DVDs in the near future.",1459382400,,1071,4.351758793969849

Enjoy this program because I can get a complete 5-mile workout in in a short time. Especially helpful if my day is not going to be an active one. Since I have foot and knee problems, having the bonus ""Feet & Ankles"" and the ""Knees & Hips"" has been helpful. I have less pain since doing these add-on workouts.  I have also purchased her ""Walk On: 3 DVD Super Set"" providing me with options for other types of walking work outs.

I'm not sure yet if this is the way to do it.",1458777600,,345,3.8857142857142857
7126555,5,B00W85TAHE,Great DVD.  It really puts you to the test.  Makes you feel like you accomplished a work out when you are done.  I only picked 3 of the 5 workout options and the cool down.  It was great!,1458691200,,187,3.8421052631578947

I did all 5 miles but they can be mix-n-match. New moves and liked that she included exercise for the ankle and shins. I don't think I've seen that in a walk video before. I did the bonus ""The Strong Feet & Ankles"" 15 minute workout. Hoping with improvement, I can wear high heels again.",1458604800,,429,4.2439024390243905

7126562,5,B00W85TAHE,"I LOVE this workout! Jessica is energetic and fun without being too talky or annoying. I really like being able to customize the workout for the time or energy I have on hand. Her workout was a step more strenuous than other walking workout videos I have tried, and I liked that! It gave me an extra push without being too high impact or difficult.  It was easy to bump up to more difficulty or stay at a more low-impact rate. I liked that she has walkers in the background to show the variation.  Thank you Jessica for your workout DVD! This was the first one I have purchased from you, but it won't be my last! :)",1458345600,,615,4.203389830508475

I'm not saying it in a negative way, but it IS old.  I walk for exercise already, five miles, about 3 times a week, so I thought this DVD would be a snap.  It wasn't. It's work. It's challenging for me, but, by golly, I'm going to master it!  Ok, maybe I will never master the brain exercise where you alternate thumb and pinkie finger, but I will not stop trying. Jessica is a talented, vibrant teacher and this tape is a terrific way to get those steps in.  I live in Texas where the heat and humidity prohibit walking eight months of the year, so it was a treat to find something I enjoy doing in my air conditioned house. This is hard work, but worth every minute of effort.",1458345600,8,847,3.9940828402366866
7126565,5,B00W85TAHE,"I have been doing Leslie Sansone's workouts for 17 or 18 years and still love them, but I have to say that Jessica's are more challenging.  They work muscles that I have not been working and they work more on balance, which I think is extremely important.  I particularly like the Brain Boosting Walk.  Everyone needs to challenge their brain and this does.  While Leslie has a more professional studio setting, I think Jessica more than makes up for it with her excellent workouts.  She is obviously very knowledgeable.  I highly recommend this DVD.  I really like that it is set up in miles.  By the way, I am 68  and love being in shape.  This does it.",1458259200,,655,4.47457627118644

Jessica has put together a 5 mile  DVD that allows you to customize your daily workout. Her cues are easy to follow. Even though I'm stuck inside for the winter, this DVD has allowed me to get stronger. The 5 different walks are interesting and challenging at the same time.

I also use the gym for classes from time to time.  I have recently realized with the help of my fitbit that I have been totally underestimated the power straight up walking has on cardio.  It beats out many of my 'cardio' videos of the same length in steps and calories burned.  I have many of Jessica's other videos (non walking) and love her as an instructor so I choose to give this type of home workout a try.  I seldom review anything but wanted to review this one to say it is a GREAT workout.  I burned mega cal, got in tons of steps on my way to 10,000 a day goal and had fun without feeling like I wanted to die!

The posture walk on this DVD was impressive to me. I work for a Physical Therapist and her warm up consisting of drawing the chin back to align the neck was exactly what I have been instructed to do for my neck pain and headaches. My Fitbit HR assures me that my heartrate is in the best zone for me and these workouts definitely get the heartrate up!  I plan to collect many of Jessica's DVD's!!,1456963200,,660,4.188976377952756

7126595,5,B00W85TAHE,"I have been working out with Jessica Smiths DVDs for a few years now, and she never disappoints me. I own almost all of her DVDs. This is my favorite of her DVDs. It's a lot of fun and has great choreography. The steps are not difficult. I love the Cha, Cha, Cha segment. She does a forward, side, and backward cha, cha, cha. This helps exercise your mind and keep you sharp. There are a lot of ""brain booster"" moves in all of the segments.

She is encouraging and explains the exercises and how they are helping improve your body, core, and balance. I always feel like I get a great workout with her DVDs. This collection has a good variety of exercises. I like that the DVDs are broken up into segments with varying times. This gives me the flexibility to vary my workout time, depending on my schedule. I have more time on the weekend to do a longer workout.

Jessica is a master at showing you modifications so you can tailor her workouts to your level of fitness (beginning, intermediate, or advanced). And her cueing is excellent. There is very little dead air in her videos. She is always explaining things to you and giving you encouragement. She has a great personality, too. She makes exercising fun for me.

7126596,5,B00W85TAHE,One of the best walking videos I've seen and I own over a dozen  very unique and lots of fun.  Jessica is a doll,1456099200,,112,3.625
7126597,5,B00W85TAHE,I love Jessica's enthusiam and also the workouts.  I was actually sweating after them,1456099200,,85,5.071428571428571
7126598,5,B00W85TAHE,"My friends, all of us seniors (70, minus or plus a few years ) really felt your dvd provided an excellent workout.  We usually do 2 miles during our workouts and we all agreed that this was a very good change from our other dvds.  I especially like the ability to customize the workout .",1456012800,,287,4.2
7126599,5,B00W85TAHE,"I was getting tired of my treadmill and the impact from running was starting to make itself apparent, so I started looking around for an alternative and found this gem. I love the workout, my hips and knees aren't aching after, and I still get in my 10k steps before I start the bulk of my day. This DVD has made a convert out of me, I'm back to get more!",1455840000,,355,4.014084507042254
7126600,5,B00W85TAHE,"I am a 66 year old female and really like the DVD.  Of course I have used it only once but will keep on!  I felt ( I went the hard workout) I should have stayed low keyed.  I have been doing the Leslie Sansone DVDs for years and thought I was in shape.  Nope so I am praying if I keep up with Walk On, I will be in great shape. Thank you!",1455840000,,338,3.527027027027027
7126601,5,B00W85TAHE,"I bought another walking video & I have to turn off the volume because the lady is SO irritating I can barely stand it.  Hence, the reason I bought this video.  I love this!  Great warm up..love the brain booster (which really confuses my brain a bit) and I get my heart rate up...giggle a little & grab a quick 20-30 minutes of exercise I normally wouldnt get.

I am a medium fit person and this video gives me a good work out.  I am trying to lose weight, but do not have any health issues.

I do this with my 8 year old daughter & we have a great time",1455840000,,554,3.945945945945946

7126604,5,B00W85TAHE,"I love the fact that I got my videos so quickly, as well as the personal email I got from Jessica, thanking me for my purchase. That was a surprise and nice to receive from her, that personal touch let me know I was dealing with a professional. Lastly, the video, I have done it 4 times since I received it and like that I can create a workout that works for me. This is key! This video makes my workout go smoothly, and I need that! I have a lot of weight to lose and I am glad I got this video to help me along the way.

P.S. get ready to sweat people, fun, challenging, non-annoying instructor sweat!",1455580800,,603,4.025
7126605,5,B00W85TAHE,Great DVD! Great program! I really like that it's customizable. Great customer service!,1455494400,,87,5.769230769230769
7126606,5,B00W85TAHE,"I love this DVD, it's a fun way to sweat and burn calories!! I have completed all 5 miles and each mile flies by...this is not a boring DVD !! On some days I do this DVD as my cardio workout; if you choose,  you can intensify each mile. Today I was working out with weights and when I finished, I wanted a little more so I walked two miles with Jessica and her crew. I felt great! As I said I love this DVD so of course I highly recommend it.",1455321600,,442,3.8043478260869565
7126607,5,B00W85TAHE,"This exercise dvd is so fun and engaging, that you don't realize you're being challenged.",1455321600,,89,5.0
7126608,4,B00W85TAHE,"I would have given  it a 5 star rating, except that when you customize your workout it doesn't highlight which ones you have picked..
Other than that great workout. I hope she has more DVDS coming.....",1455321600,,201,4.583333333333333
7126609,4,B00W85TAHE,"This is the first of Jessica's DVDs that I have purchased. I found her through her YouTube channel and enjoyed several of her walks so decided to go ahead and purchase this DVD. First off - these walks seem really low key. She keeps you thinking and coordinating more, but I have yet to break a sweat using this DVD. That said, I will definitely keep in in rotation. I think that the pace is nice for a quick walk first thing in the morning or to supplement my strength-training days, but I would say look elsewhere if you really want to get your heart pumping.",1455148800,3,561,4.30188679245283
7126610,5,B00W85TAHE,"This is an excellent workout and or workouts.  Each 15 minute workout works a different area and with a warm up, you can program as many as you want and keep on going.  Your whole body is worked.  As a bonus you get a workout for your knees and feet to strengthen them.  Trust me, as you get older, your feet and knees will not work as well as they once did.  Especially if you are a long distance power walker.  Highly recommend.",1455148800,,430,4.120481927710843
7126611,5,B00W85TAHE,Love her workouts. Ordered 2 more of her DVDs.,1455148800,,46,4.222222222222222
7126612,5,B00W85TAHE,"Working out with Jessica Smith is like walking with a friend. I love her YouTube channel and decided to give this DVD a try. Mostly because of the bonus feet, hip & knees routine included. I love this DVD and have using it for my weight loss journey. The workouts are easy to learn and fun! This one really makes me work up a sweat!",1455148800,,332,4.123076923076923
7126613,5,B00W85TAHE,I love this video! There are many options to choose from to mix up your workout daily. Jessica keeps you motivated and gives great step by step instructions. There is always a low impact version to follow.,1455062400,,205,4.5675675675675675
7126614,5,B00W85TAHE,This is the first dvd I have purchased with Jessica Smith instructing and I'm glad I did. I use this at least three times a week and never get bored with the routine. Lots of fun and is a great workout!,1455062400,,202,3.951219512195122
7126615,5,B00W85TAHE,I was looking for a new walking exercise video as I have used the current one for some time and was getting bored. Of course I had concerns if it would fit my fitness level. I was pleasantly surprised that I could follow for the most part. Some of the steps with practice I will get. One thing I really liked was due to an accident I had that effected my leg calfs and hips which I still get some pain and my doctor has recommended stretches. There were actually stretches that made it feel good and no pain. so far I am enjoying. Of course I have not done all of the sessions. Loving it so far.,1455062400,,595,4.0508474576271185
7126616,5,B00W85TAHE,It's been great to have these DVD's with being stuck inside due to winter conditions.  It's nice there are 3 levels of training.  It's great!,1455062400,,141,4.6
7126617,5,B00W85TAHE,"This program is great. It's not your average walking program. You are working out different muscles and your brain as well as getting your steps in. Your workouts are customizable to your time schedule and intensity.

I would recommend this program to anyone looking for a fun and challenging way to get your steps in and burn calories with out strain on your joints.

FIVE STARS all the way.",1455062400,,392,4.666666666666667
7126618,2,B00W85TAHE,"I really love this workout, but the stupid DVD is very poorly made. I got it as a Christmas present in 2015 (and it's only February) and the inside ring of the DVD has come away and you can insert a fingernail in there. I noticed a problem when it wouldn't play anymore and now it is worthless. I would love to buy another one, but can't afford it, so I guess I'm SOL. I tried the return/exchange feature on Amazon, but that expired at the end of January...eight days too late and now I can't do my favorite bonus routines. This is BULL! Has anyone else had this problem and what have you done about it?",1454889600,2,603,4.162393162393163
7126619,5,B00W85TAHE,"Love this video. Jessica stays on point to get you a fast, great work-out. Time flies on this one!",1454889600,,98,4.2105263157894735
7126620,5,B00W85TAHE,"Tried it today with my Senior Walking Group and know I got a good workout because I worked up a good sweat.  Mile One really tested my brain and the simple moves - or what appeared to be so - were really challanging.  Although some of the moves were familiar from working out with Leslie Sansone, the workout turns out to be really different - in a good way.  We all look forward to visiting all the other miles on this DVD.  Love the fact that you can mix and match the mile and order of the workouts giving the feeling of always doing something new and challenging.  The nice part of this purchase was the email that I received from Jessica.  I'm going to share the pointers with the rest of the group.  Thanks for reaching out Jessica!",1454889600,,738,4.266187050359712
7126621,5,B00W85TAHE,A great alternative to when you can't make it outside to walk.  Really like the versatility it offers to choose the mile segment or segments that will work for me on any given day. The 2 bonus features at the end are an added plus!!!  I have only had this dvd a short time but have had the chance to try all the segments.  I plan to add this to my mix of workouts.,1454716800,,364,3.891891891891892
7126622,5,B00W85TAHE,"I HAVE NEVER LEFT A REVIEW BEFORE, BUT I WANTED EVERYONE TO KNOW HOW HAPPY I AM WITH THIS WORKOUT.
I HAVE BEEN WALKING WITH LESLIE SANSONE WALKING DVDS FOR TEN YEARS.  I HAVE AROUND 50 OF HER DVDS AND LOVE WALKING WITH HER, BUT I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO ALTERNATE WITH HER WORKOUTS.  I HAVEN'T FOUND ANYTHING ELSE I LIKED UNTIL THIS SET.  YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A DANCER AND LEARN INTRICATE STEPS.  A NORMAL PERSON CAN DO THIS WORKOUT.  I LIKE THAT SHE HAS HER MOTHER AND ANOTHER FRIEND WALKING WITH HER.  HER MOTHER DOES THE EASIER WORKOUT WHILE HER FRIEND DOES A HARDER WORKOUT, GIVING YOU A CHOICE OF WHICH  WORKOUT YOU WANT TO DO. IT IS CHALLENGING BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE.  SHE IS ALSO TONING YOU UP WHILE WALKING.  I WILL BE ALTERNATING HER WORKOUT WITH LESLIE FROM NOW ON.",1454716800,,783,4.308219178082192
7126623,5,B00W85TAHE,"I've been using a walk dvd for several months now by a different instructor, I have liked it very much and only bought your dvd because I thought perhaps i'd like to see what other ppl. are doing.  I am very happy with your dvd, altho I only received it a few days ago, and typically only do one mile a day so far...therefore I haven't finished the whole 5 options!  I like the set-up and the room you are in, its clean and open with nothing distracting.  and I find it very helpful to have only your mom and beth with you.  and I do appreciate that while you do talk through the mile to give advice and encouragement, it is at a minimum and there is almost no personal chatter, which after a few times of viewing, I find somewhat annoying.  so thanks Jessica, I totally endorse your dvd walk and will continue to use it as well as ordering additional ones for my personal library.",1454630400,,881,4.220238095238095
7126624,5,B00W85TAHE,"My walking group loves her DVDs! They are challenging and work more muscles than we knew we had, plus we really like the brain boosters! We are baby boomers and know how important it is to keep our brains healthy too!",1454630400,,217,4.317073170731708
7126625,5,B00W85TAHE,I so enjoy walking with Jessica!  I've tried other walking videos (with other presenters) but Jessica is by far my favorite.,1454544000,,124,4.904761904761905
7126626,5,B00W85TAHE,Great video! Amazing instructor!,1454457600,,32,7.25
7126627,5,B00W85TAHE,"I can't even say how much I love Jessica's walking routines.  The variety, the energy and the fact I can choose to do one or all is awesome.  She's like working out with a best friend and keeps me motivated and entertained the whole time.  She is also one of the very few that I can do a dvd and not keep checking the clock to see how much time is left.  I literally get lost in the workouts and then am shocked when she announces it's time to cool down.",1454457600,,454,3.956043956043956

7126630,5,B00W85TAHE,Two words LOVE IT I exercise everyday.  I run and do alot of cardio.  This dvd is fun and you get a heck of a work out.,1454284800,,119,3.3703703703703702
7126631,5,B00W85TAHE,I love this DVD. I really like Jessica Smith all together. I have about four of her DVDs now and like all of them. She makes the exercise fun and the time flies. Lots of different moves in this one.,1454198400,,198,3.975
7126632,5,B00W85TAHE,I was excited to get this after reading reviews....and I wasn't disappointed. I have a few other walking she's but this one is by far the best. I love that she has different fitness levels so you can work your way up. And after the first time doing exercise I could feel it a lil after...so it is working. I just might invest in another...and I definitely recommend!,1454198400,,366,4.397058823529412
7126633,5,B00W85TAHE,"Hi Jessica. I have been exercising with you on YouTube for 6 months now. I've gone from a size 20 to a size 10-12. I have to say thank you for helping me lose weight and fat. I bought 10000 steps to add more steps to my day. I already walk 10000 steps plus, but always looking to add more. I have already completed the video twice, all 5 miles, all at once. I LOVE IT! Thank you, Jessica for helping me lose weight and get healthy. Even my doctor is happy with my results and numbers. Thank you.",1454112000,,495,4.01010101010101

7126635,5,B00W85TAHE,"I'm one of the pickiest exercisers around and I just love Jessica. It's like you're exercising with a friend. She's encouraging, cues well, and the exercises are interesting, efficient and effective. I've never used a workout video where I can vary the workouts so this is really fun!
This one is definitely worth the money.",1454025600,,324,4.909090909090909
7126636,5,B00W85TAHE,Fun video and Jessica is easy to listen to.,1454025600,,43,3.888888888888889
7126637,5,B00W85TAHE,"What you're getting when you purchase Jessica Smith's dvds are the benefits of having a personal coach and trainer. She is motivating, but she will challenge you. On days when I've got a lot of energy I put my all into these workouts. Some days I just need to push myself and do what I can do. Either way, I'm moving and doing something good for myself. I like the customization features and the two bonus workouts are perfect for active rests days or for any time.",1453939200,,465,4.35632183908046
7126638,4,B00W85TAHE,I bought this to give me some variety.  I am a Leslie Sansone walker and bought this for days I want a change.  Great workout.  You can program miles in any order.  Jessica gives great directions and explains moves well. You do have to concentrate on the moves or it's easy to get off track. Her mom is in it and demonstrates the lower impact version while her friend demonstrates higher impact moves. The only reason I marked off one star is it requires concentration to do all the moves and sometimes I like to know what I'm doing so I can concentrate better on putting more energy into the moves.,1453680000,4,599,4.36936936936937
7126639,5,B00W85TAHE,Great workout for anyone. Modified for a variety of levels and easy to follow.  Fun too.,1453680000,,88,4.5

7126643,5,B00W85TAHE,Great walking DVD.  I especially like the brain booster segment.,1453420800,,64,5.4
7126644,5,B00W85TAHE,I love all of Jessicas DVDs- I have the 4 weeks workout plan and these DVDs- I never got tired and I actually like working out with her. The time goes by fast and you feel like she's doing it with you- you are working out together.,1453334400,,231,3.9361702127659575
7126645,4,B00W85TAHE,"Love 4 out of the 5 miles. Great job of mixing things up, great work out using lots of muscle groups.",1453334400,2,101,3.857142857142857
7126646,5,B00W85TAHE,This is a great walking cd. I have used others (Leslie Sansone) and after awhile they are all the same. This one is different and mixes it up with each mile. It is challenging but not so much you can't keep up. You have the choice of doing the low impact version with each movement and Jessica is good at reminding you of this. It definitely uses all of you muscles and gives you a good workout,1453161600,,394,4.12987012987013
7126647,5,B00W85TAHE,Great program.  I love to be able to change my exercise program day to day on one DVD.  Jessica is a fun and motivating instructor!,1453075200,,131,4.2
7126648,5,B00W85TAHE,"This is my first purchase from Jessica. I am not a gym person and prefer to workout at home. I own exercise DVD's by Leslie Sansone, Denise Austin and Richard Simmons. I like them all. I usually buy a new workout DVD for the new year which was this one. I cannot say enough good things about this workout. It has given me the extra boost I need some days for a tougher workout. I like the fact I can do lower impact or higher. I've been having trouble with one knee so I've been taking it easy lately. The bonus workouts for strong feet, ankles, knees and hips are fabulous. I thought the knee and hips were a little challenging but I know they will be easier with practice. I'm planning on adding them at least once a week to hopefully prevent injury to those areas. I will purchase more from Jessica. Her DVD's are a little more pricey than I like but I'm so happy with this one it's worth it. The only thing I don't like about this is on the menu you can't pick each individual workout. She does give an option to customize your own but to keep things fresh and interesting I just pick certain ones each time on all my workout DVD's.",1452902400,,1136,4.191780821917808
7126649,5,B00W85TAHE,Terrific work out.  Have been walking at home for some time and was looking for a more challenging work out.  This DVD fits the bill!  Loved the different levels of workouts and routines.,1452729600,,187,4.606060606060606
7126650,5,B00W85TAHE,"I love this DVD, I like that the steps have been counted for me, since it is pointed out that my Fitbit tacks forward steps mainly. I like that they are broken up into segments, makes time fly by and the countdown at 8 minutes is very encouraging!! Thank you Jessica!!",1452643200,,268,4.2745098039215685
7126651,5,B00W85TAHE,Excellent DVD!,1452297600,,14,6.5
7126652,5,B00W85TAHE,"Jessica is easy to follow and not boring or annoying like other walk videos I have tried.  You can start with 1 mile and build up to 5 if you need to.  You can make the workout more intense for people that have been working out, or, if injured, you can still get a workout and just modify the movements as needed.
I really enjoy Jessica's other workouts as well.",1452211200,,362,4.1571428571428575
7126653,5,B00W85TAHE,"This is my first Jessica Smith workout. I am 61 years old. I would call this a perfect aerobic workout. It is low impact, but very intense. Jessica is an excellent instructor with a very pleasant personality. It has three levels. Jessica leads the intermediate, her mom leads the beginners or less intense moves, and another gal leads the most intense higher impact moves. It includes all levels and physical limitations. I do the moves lead by all of them depending on the impact to my knees. There is walk that concentrates on abs and buns. There is a boogie walk that is almost like dancing without complicated choreography. What I found very unique on this video is the brain booster walk and the posture walk. Also the bonus has knee, feet, and bun work which is not during the walking, but uses a chair and floor work. The bonus is like physical therapy. You can program the workout to do one, two, three, four, or five miles, which I like. On the days I work I do shorter workouts,on the weekends I go for it. Worth the money, and a workout I will use very frequently! Thank-you to Jessica!",1452211200,5,1097,4.49
7126654,4,B00W85TAHE,"I'm not big on writing reviews, nor am I going to break the video down minute by minute.  Suffice it to say Jessica will get your heart pumping and your mind working. Her upbeat attitude is contagious and the different workouts almost guarantee you won't get bored.",1452124800,,265,4.638297872340425
7126655,5,B00W85TAHE,Love every part of this cd. High energy with low impact offered too. I love the brain workout.,1452038400,,94,4.277777777777778
7126656,5,B00W85TAHE,"I am in my sixties and wanted an exercise DVD that would challenge me.  Unfortunately, far too many exercise programs for seniors concentrate on exercises that will not make you sweat.  I love the fact that this DVD leaves me sweating and that I can customize my workouts.  Sometimes, I am in the mood for jogging.  This DVD allows me to set up an exercise routine that will allow me to jog for as many miles as I wish.  Other times, I want to concentrate on my core.  Again, I can customize a routine that allows me to do so,  Jessica is always so encouraging and ready to cheer you on.  Great job!!!",1451952000,10,601,4.256637168141593
7126657,5,B00W85TAHE,"Fun and simple to follow, but still challenging enough to where I'm tired and sweating by the end.",1451952000,2,98,4.5
7126658,5,B00W85TAHE,Jessica does a wonderful job of making exercise fun.  She provides very detailed instructions with each exercise so you don't do them incorrectly. I appreciate being able to customize the order the mile workshops are presented.  The bonus feet and ankle and knee and quads workouts are just the right amount of time to feel a difference in my muscles.  The only con is that I would like to be able to just play the music only after I understand the instructions so I don't have to hear them repeated over and over.  I can tell that Jessica truly wants to help us all to be fit but not be injured in the process.  Good Job!,1451952000,2,622,4.327586206896552
7126659,5,B00W85TAHE,Love the workout. Will definitely get more of her DVDs,1451692800,,54,4.5
7126660,5,B00W85TAHE,"As a person who suffers from myofascial pain syndrome and a back injury,  I worried that I wouldn't be able to work out again.  Not true thanks to Jessica Smith!  I started with her 15 Minute workout dvd and just got this 10,000 Steps edition. I can easily do these workouts and feel like I'm getting a great exercise session.
I highly recommend these DVD's if you are like me and cannot do the traditional exercise routines that most people do. Actually, even if  you can, I recommend them because they're great!

I decided to try a different approach and went with a new walk leader.  Jessica is awesome. She gives 3 levels to follow so you can make it work for you.  I love that she includes her mom. I'm probably her mom's age but I'm able to mostly keep up with the higher intensity one.  And boy oh boy did I sweat, and only 30 minutes.
I will continue to use this and the several other workout dvds I bought of Jessica Smith.  Thanks",1451606400,4,583,4.115044247787611

Jessica isn't pushy, she isn't there to tell you how great she is, or how great you are going to be.  Just coaches you though it and encourages you to give more each time.  This is not a difficult DVD to follow and you can get as much a workout as you want from it.  I really enjoyed it.  Missed them being outside on the deck as in her other videos that I have but that is immaterial to the workout.",1451433600,4,496,3.91

I have her last 5 most recent workouts and they are absolutely great, however, they are all in the SAME LOCATION, TIME TO CHANGE LOCATIONS. THIS DVD is her BEST YET! The first mile is very original, boost your brain and makes you think. It really is different. Her TURBO mile is amazing, WHY? because it's FAST! I HOPE HER NEXT DVD is all FAST, make a 5 mile FAST WALK with HIIT- that would be simply amazing....I would buy it so fast..HIITs are the best way to get fit fast! the other miles are very good also, the moves are different and original.

With the exception of the brain booster walk, which was admittedly harder than it seemed like it should be, the rest of them felt boring and repetitive.  I was seriously disappointed with the boogie walk, which I found to be the slowest of all of the segments.  Despite disliking the work out, I DID like the countdown clock and her co-exercisers showing different intensity levels of the moves.  I'll stick with Leslie Sansone and Debra Mazda.",1447027200,4,585,4.81

7126685,5,B00W85TAHE,"I really enjoyed this workout and it exceeded my expectations.  I was a little skeptical that it would really meet the 10,000 steps like it says on the case since when I do Leslie Sansone's walking DVDs they seem to fall short of the mile marks that are indicated in the workout.  I think that is because some of her steps are not counted on my fitbit.  With Jessica's workout I was able to get a little over 11,000 steps following the advance moves and doing all of the workouts minus the 2 bonus ones.  Also, I was drenched in sweat by the time I was done which is a good indicator of a good workout for me. This was really fun and I liked that you can mix and match the different miles.  I never thought that I would love to do a walking workout since all my life I have been doing a lot of running (which has caused bad knees) and high intensity workouts.  I have found that now that I can no longer run like I use to and I now power walk (w/ some HIIT), yoga/pilates and strength train that I get better results and my knees don't hurt as much.  Everyone needs to find what works for them and then mix it up from time to time so you don't get bored or reach a weight loss plateau.  If you never tried a walking DVD before, this would be a great one to try.",1446681600,,1261,4.016
7126686,5,B00W85TAHE,I love this workout. All of it. I like the fact that there is only 1 warm up at the start and 1 cool down at the end.  Most of the time I do the entire workout. And yes I broke a sweat. Workout is over an hour. It is not boring and there's room to advance. I like the fact that Jessica mentions how to burn fat tips. And how sweating is beneficial -mentioned on a different DVD. I don't find any of her tips offensive and I'm sure they are not meant to be. Another great workout.

None of the low-impact workout moves have bothered my knees, but this may not hold true for everyone. Jessica is a genius when it comes to developing upper and lower body moves that are effective and interesting.  These aren't auto-pilot workouts. You need to pay attention in order to coordinate the upper and lower body moves.  This DVD even includes a brain-booster workout that is challenging. I like the ability to customize the workout on this DVD and the fact that there are five separate workouts.

It is very easy to customize a workout as she allows you to program which walks you want to complete in addition to the warm up and cool down.

As Jessica says, she sets the bar a little higher to give us something to work toward. Jessica has fewer annoying moments than Leslie, too.

I have many other walking DVDs by another popular fitness walker and felt that this DVD was much more of a workout! Jessica has some great moves and really knows how to intensify simple moves.  The only negative for me was the quality of the video. She is front of a brightly lit patio and it makes her and the other walkers look washed out. It almost looks like an amateur video. On the plus side it doesn't take away from the intensity of the exercise. If you are reading this Jessica, please try to improve the quality of your video. ",1442016000,,623,4.226890756302521

7126709,5,B00W85TAHE,"I have just about every DVD Jessica Smith has ever done plus I use her UTube workouts as well.  This is by far her best DVD.

There are 5 1 mile walks, a 5 min. warm up and a 5 min. cool down.  The menu is interactive so you can choose to combine the workouts any way you want or there is an option to do the entire 5 miles.  Each mile is about 15 min. each, some easier than others, the description will pretty much tell you which might be challenging.  She has her mom there for the easier modifications and a friend to do the ramped up ones, while Jessica stays in the middle most of the time.  The music is a good mix, there is very little jumping or squatting that might hurt the knees and as usual her prompts are spot on.

The two extras are about 15 min. each and good add ons when you need a little extra pampering.  I'm pushing 60, have been working out for years but am unable to jog any more because I blew out both knees, I'm unable to work out for longer than about 45 min. any more and don't even think about jumping or anything that might strain my muscles, joints or bones.

I was hesitant to buy this DVD because I was afraid it was going to be a compilation of previous walks, but I'm SO glad I bought it. For one thing, these are NOT repeats. (Of course, some steps come standard with any walking video like side steps and knee lifts.) The best part of this DVD is that it is programmable. You can make your own workout by selecting the Warm-Up, Cool Down, and whatever workouts you want in between. They will even play in the order you choose. Each workout also has an ""almost done"" countdown when you have only 7 or 8 minutes left so you can give it all you've got until the very end. I L-O-V-E this DVD.

7126717,5,B00W85TAHE,"I only recently discovered Jessica Smith, and I'm so very glad I did. Before I bought her 21 days workout set, I had no idea a walking workout could be fun and creative. Not taking anything away from Leslie Sansone here, but Jessica really takes the fun and the intensity to a whole nother level. I especially love the way she integrates core work and posture work so effectively.

Generally, I think the 21 day set is better produced, but this one is excellent and includes pieces the other one doesn't, like the dedicated warm up and cool down. Also, I like the option to do all the segments for about an hour and a half of a workout. Boy did that feel satisfying. Also, there were very few moves I'd seen in the other set. I don't know how she keeps the creativity flowing, while still putting together a doable, effective workout. I am in awe, and very grateful.

A few additional thoughts:  I doubt I'll do the first segment (Brain Booster) again because the pacing was a bit awkward. Also, the bonus that focuses on knees and hips is good, but I didn't see how it was that different from a lower body workout. Still, I appreciate that she's trying to include work that is designed to keep us aging gracefully. She clearly is dedicated to overall health as much or more than to weight loss, which is refreshing to me.",1438992000,2,1322,4.432098765432099
7126718,5,B00W85TAHE,Great DVD. I like that you can mix up the walks so that they are always fresh. I also like that Jessica gives you difference levels to follow so that you can work out at your own pace.,1438300800,,184,3.8684210526315788
7126719,5,B00W85TAHE,"LOVED this one. I really enjoyed all of the segments, but, at 56 find it a tad difficult to do all 5 in one session. Not a problem, do the warm up and cool down with ""miles"" 1 and 2 one day, do the warm up and cool down with the remaining ""miles"" the next. Throw in a strength day, then repeat! I do like to switch up my dvd's, but this has been my routine lately, and I still enjoy it : )",1438300800,,389,3.642857142857143
7126720,3,B00W85TAHE,"I wish I could give this 5 stars. I really like Jessica's sunny, down to earth personality and her routines are fun and feel good.
I did the turbo walk this morning and sadly, as an eating disorder survivor was dismayed to hear her make comments about fat and how we release fat through our breathing and sweating. Then she went on to say something like ""come on, breathe out the fat!!"" several times.
I was instantly triggered and had to tell myself that message was not for me. It really is not a good message for anyone. Body hatred is not helping anyone get thin or healthy. Loving your body and taking care of it sensibly will get you healthy, no matter what your size. Not all of us want to lose weight or should attempt to lose weight. There is a population that has dieted itself into extreme obesity and self hatred. I hope we can stop this message once and for all and just exercise for fitness sake and not fat loss sake. I should have known with ""5 fat burning miles"" in the title. But so many of her walking videos on youtube do not mention fat loss when she is coaching you. I thought I might be ok with this dvd too.
Sadly, I will have to mute her when I do turbo walk. I have not done the ""belly, buns and thighs"" yet, I suspect there will be body disparaging talk in those too. I have no problem with coaching that inspires strength, but when the comments are about trimming the ""trouble zones"" and ""toning the jiggle"" that is just so unfortunate for women.

There is great production and sound and a trio of beautiful women in the video though!",1438128000,9,1562,4.277027027027027

7126732,5,B00W85TAHE,"This is my favourite Jessica Smith walking DVD. I also have Walk On - 15 Minute Fast Fat Blasts and Walking for Weight Loss, Wellness & Energy. This DVD has plenty of variety and is FUN. You can mix and match 5 workouts which run for 13-15minutes each and there is a separate 5 minute warm up and 5 minute cool down. This may possibly be the first DVD where JS has included a countdown timer in the second half of each workout and the first time where you can program your workout allowing you to do as much or little as you like without having to return to the main menu after each section to choose the next workout. LOVE that! Jessica Smith is my favourite instructor. Her voice isn't annoying, her cueing is always excellent, she is encouraging and just has a very likeable persona. I use this for days when I want a low impact workout, or a rest from HIIT and kickboxing. This is suitable for the exerciser just starting out, just watch Jessica's mum! Also, if you've never done a walking dvd before and don't know what to expect. There's a lot of directional changes, arm movements, taps, tiny squats and a bit of boogeying to mix things up and get your heart rate up. If you're looking for a one direction walk like you would get on a treadmill or walking outside then this DVD isn't it! However, if treadmills and walking outside bores you to tears and you want something different you might like this too.",1436659200,5,1414,4.380228136882129

I I was a skeptic at first about walking exercises but she definitely gets your heart rate up and gets you sweating. It is definitely a great workout! If you can't make it to the gym this is a great alternative. The belly, buns and thighs walk is probably my favorite. The brain booster gets you thinking and ready for the day. I honestly enjoy the entire dvd but those are my favorite miles. If you are new to working out or don't think you would be able to do all the moves. She has different variations for everyone.

With everything that has been going on, and more to come, I just felt like I couldn't even TRY to get back into it. I have several of Jessica's DVD'S, and I really enjoy the way she looks at exercise from all directions. It's not just for your body, but also for your mind and to keep you moving as we age. It's all in this DVD. I love the music!! If the music doesn't help move me then it's already a lost cause for me. I know with this DVD and her other walking DVD, I'll be able to fit in and feel like doing at least one 15 minute workout and still know I've done something really good for myself.

7126752,4,B00W85TAHE,"I get bored very easily when I exercise, so I like to mix and match shorter workouts to create a different experience each time. Jessicas newest DVD is going to favor heavily in my rotation. Because the warm-up and cool-down segments are separate, I don't have to worry about wasting time on warm-up moves when I start the next workout. And I love that the workouts on this DVD are customizable, so I don't have to stop and fiddle with the remote.

I enjoy all of Jessicas walking DVDs, but this one feels tighter. Theres not as much repetition within each workout. Theres also less time wasted between moves, so my brain stays engaged. I thought the little countdown clock that appears at the half-way point would distract me, but Ive decided I like it. When I feel like bailing out I just tell myself, Oh cmon, you can hang in there for X more minutes

I hope Jessica makes more of these customizable walking workouts!",1434326400,6,920,4.536144578313253

I try to work out most days and I alternate heavy and light cardio.  This is perfect for the HEAVY days.  I call them ""endurance days"".  I prefer an athletic workouts as opposed to ""dancey""  ones and Jessica Smith is my brand new favorite exercise guru.  Lots and lots of varied moves, but she keeps them going just long enough to learn them without carrying them on to the point of boredom.  One of the faults I often run into with DVD's is ""Over Explanation""  . . fine at the beginning but annoying after the 10th time one has done the workout.  Jessica avoids this beautifully . . just enough explanation to remind one what's coming without endless discussion.  Refreshing.

It's nice because it's customizable, plus it has more bang for your buck, with 5 walking segments plus 2 extra workouts (so far I've tried the strong feet segment and I did like that). I can't pinpoint why, but it's just not as fun. Good to add variety to your other workouts, she does keep the moves fresh.",1433894400,4,393,4.116883116883117

I really appreciate that there are different intensity levels shown. Depending on my ""aches and pains"" of the day ( I have some medical issues ), I can modify how I workout. But I can still workout. I recommend any of Jessica's DVDs.
Being able to pick your own segments is great. You can go with how you feel each day or go for the whole thing.

As always there is great cuing and ways to modify plus Jessica is a great motivator and is always cheerful, energetic and fun to work out with.  I loved the warm up and cool down segments which she hasn't done since her Waking for Weight loss so this was a big plus for me!  I also have knee issues due to a muscle imbalance around the knee caps so the knee and hip segment is great for that, plus I always have to wear shoes when working out so the feet/ankle segment was another plus for me.  A big thank you to Jessica for that!  The only cons I found were I didn't like the music as much as her last walking dvds and the room was a little too white and bright for me.  I know it was that way a little in her last 2 walking dvds but seem to be exaggerated in this one.  Was a little distracting for me.

If you have to choose between ordering this one and one of the previous ones, I definitely recommend the ""21 Days one"". I think it is better overall.",1433462400,,476,4.184782608695652
7126762,5,B00W85TAHE,"As a 44-year-old with tricky knees and perpetually achy feet, I believe I have found the best workout DVDs ever in Jessica Smith's walking workouts.  This one is possibly my favorite.  It has 5 separate workouts (each is supposed to be the equivalent of walking a mile), and you can program it to play any combination of them you like, in any order.  There's also a cool down section that you can add to your ""playlist"", as well as a couple of bonus segments, one for strong feet and ankles, the other for strong knees and hips.  Both are nice to have, and I should probably do them more than I have so far.

Each of the 5 main workouts is about 15 minutes long, perfect if you have very little time and only want to do one, also perfect for combining into a longer workout.  Each has moves that are varied enough to not get boring.  I've been exercising for many years, but I do believe this DVD would work for anyone from a beginner up to an more advanced individual.  The entire video can be done low impact (following Jessica's mom, as always), and, at least for me, is not hard on the feet or knees at all.  She also demonstrates a high impact version of most of the moves - if you follow along with that, you will certainly be sweating by the end.  I use hand weights for a more overall body workout, they are not required.

As for Jessica Smith - another Smith (Kathy) has always been my very favorite at-home workout leader, but Jessica is now right up there with her.  She's so cheery and encouraging, she explains and cues very well, and she DOES NOT ANNOY ME.  Which is so very crucial if I'm going to use a DVD more than a couple of times.

Overall - highly recommended for anyone who needs a flexible and enjoyable routine.",1433376000,3,1736,4.3015384615384615

It's my first tape by her but by far the best I own! Warning- this is not for beginners. If you are just starting walking at home you may be able to complete one mile. For those needing a challenge like me this is it! Fortunately you can customize her workouts cause even at my advanced level I cannot do all five. Oh, the steps are very easy but they are smart steps and her moves are brilliant. Her easiest I would say was her posture mile. She moves at a fast brisk pace throughout all the miles.

I ordered it right away. She is a wonderful instructor with such positive enthusiasm, wonderful direction and lots of encouragement. Sadly, I wasn't thrilled with this one. It is not bad, but not great either. The best way to describe this one is this...if you are looking for a good walking DVD to supplement your daily routine, this is for you. It offers some really nice health benefits with the brain boosting walk and perfect posture walk, etc. However, if you are looking to lose weight or build endurance...this is NOT the DVD to preferentially grab. Choose Jessica's 21 day plan or her 15 minute fat burn walking DVDs. Those are GREAT! This one is not hard / intense enough (in my own opinion). I hardly sweat at all after the 5 miles. The fact that it is called ""5 fat burning miles"" is a bit of a stretch. Maybe it is intense for beginners but for most exercisers...likely not. Overall, a good DVD from Jess, but again, not her best. Love the music in the cool down segment best!",1432512000,74,1162,4.3842592592592595
7126768,5,B00W85TAHE,"Even though I have been doing Jessica's walking routines for over a year now, I am still amazed at how effective they are for re-shaping my body and for making me feel so good and energized.  I used to be one of those intense cardio junkies.  If exercise wasn't super-intense, it wasn't worth doing.  Well, I am living proof that that doesn't have to be the case.  Even though I was pretty fit before, I am now in the best shape of my life.  I also have no aches and pains, which was all too common for me when I was doing intense cardio.

Once again Jessica has created a great walking program.  With this DVD, you can mix and match your 15 minute walks.  All sections, including the two bonus workouts are approximately 15 minutes.  The warm up and cool down are 5 minutes.  You don't need any special equipment for the main sections.

The sections:

Warm Up
Brain booster walk
Belly, buns & thighs
Power posture
Turbo charged
Boogie Down
Cool Down

2 Bonus workouts:

Strong feet & ankles
Strong knees & hips.

GENERAL IMPRESSIONS

My initial take on this DVD was that I didn't think it was as intense, cardio-wise, as Jessica's other walking DVDs. This is just fine with me since Jessica's new moves and new twists on walking made me really concentrate on what I was doing.  The time flew by and the workout was over before I knew it.

The set is the bright, white airy room.  Jessica's Mom, Debbie, does easier versions of the moves.  Beth does the more intense versions.  A little countdown clock appears in the lower right corner at 8 minutes remaining the workout.

Jessica is a master at coming up with new ways to walk.

BRAIN BOOSTER WALK

As the name implies, you will be working your brain during this session!  Jessica has us doing one pattern with our upper body and a very different pattern with our lower body.  Try to picture trying to march in place, all the while patting your head and rubbing your stomach.  Yah, it's kind of like that.

The hardest move in this section was holding your hands in front of you, sticking out your thumb on one hand and your pinky on the other hand.  Then switch.  And you do this all while marching in place.

BELLY, BUNS & THIGHS WALK

This section has the usual knee lifts, side leg lifts, skater taps, puddle jumps. The new fun move here is the heel tap with the funky chicken crunch. How can you be in a bad mood after doing a move like that?

POWER POSTURE

This is good for whatever ails you.  We all sit hunched over our computers and our phones these days.  It's great to move and stretch and concentrate on your posture.  Jessica puts in some glorious stretch moves like the arms out, thumbs up press back, toe tap pec deck, and swimming motions.

TURBO CHARGED

If you want to pick things up a notch here, you can do a light jog. I love the music in this section, it's a fast beat that is perfectly timed with the moves.  You'll jog forward and back, do some jumping jacks and do alternating kicks with your arms overhead.

BOOGIE DOWN

I didn't think this section was that dancey, I think it was named this because of the music.  Either way, it was fun.  Some of the moves in this section include:  toe tap front, toe tap side, alternating heel dig to corner, cha cha front and back, and side step with arms open wide to side.

BONUS WORKOUT - STRONG FEET & ANKLES

Equipment needed:  sturdy chair, towel.  No shoes are needed.

I need this workout.  I do a lot of barre and ballet and my feet are always cramping up on me.

Exercises in this section include:  flex & point feet, ankle circles, spread toes on floor, pick up towel with toes, foot massage.

BONUS WORKOUT - STRONG KNEES & HIPS

Equipment needed:  sturdy chair.  No shoes are needed.

I consider this workout to be ""barre light.""  Many of the exercises are those you would do in a barre class.  I happen to love barre, so this was right up my alley.

Some of the exercises in this section include: seated single leg lift, single balance knee lift, single balance circle knee, clam shell, bridge, inner thigh lifts.

I can't say enough good about this DVD.  If you love Jessica, you will enjoy this workout.",1432512000,123,4135,4.387566137566138
7126769,3,B00W85TAHE,"To start off, I really like Jessica Smith as a motivating, very likeable instructor and I have many of her workout DVD's.  However, this is not one of my favorites.  Thought the choreography could have been better...it was somewhat tedious and quite frankly, a little boring.  So, it's definitely not as ""fun"" as some of her other workouts.  But it's still good for beginner and intermediate levels. As with a few of her other DVD's, Jessica's mom exercises at low impact, while Jessica and another lady will escalate parts of the workout to a high impact level. Don't worry Jessica, you're still my all-around favorite instructor!",1432339200,3,631,4.9245283018867925
7126770,5,B00W85TAHE,"I have almost all of Jessica Smith's workout DVDs, and they just keep getting better and better!  She really is fun to workout to, and her exercises are very unique!  I don't like exercising at all, but Jessica's exercise routines make it painless and fun.  The only thing I think is a little annoying is the background lighting.  There's A LOT of white...it's really distracting.  That being said, I just focus on the exercises, and break some sweat!  I really hope Jessica keeps producing more DVDS!",1432252800,2,501,4.767441860465116
7126771,5,B00W85TAHE,"As usual Jessica has hit it out of the ballpark with her new walking DVD!  Unlike her 15 minute fat blast video there are no warm ups and cool downs for each segment so be sure to do both no matter how many miles you walk as she packs as much as possible into each mile.  Jessica is joined once again by her Mom Debbie (low impact) and friend Beth (high impact), which gives you the option to build up if you're a beginner or get a good sweat on if you're advanced.

There is a 5 minute warm up followed by five walks that are each roughly a mile:

Brain Booster Walk (15 minutes): I LOVED this one as it made your brain work along with your body.  The walking itself was basic but the moves were unique/varied and although I caught on to most of them I did have to think.  It's going to take a while before I can master ""pinkie finger to thumb!""

Belly, Buns & Thighs Walk (15 minutes):  Just as it's described!  Mini squats, torso twisting moves and side steps that target those areas.  If you've done her other walks of this nature you know what you're getting into.

Power Posture Walk (15 Minutes):  This was great.  Jessica focuses on your upper back and shoulder muscles that help with your posture.  I could feel the burn despite doing similar exercises regularly.

Turbo Charged Walk (13 Minutes):  I'm going to have to build up to this one as it was a lot like HIIT workouts (which I confess I hate).  It's fast paced and I did it using the low impact version but it includes squat jumps, skiers, jogging, etc.  There is a lot packed into these 13 minutes!

Boogie Down Walk (15 Minutes): This was my least favorite of the walks.  I loved the dance party walk on her 15 minute fat blasts disc and this didn't come close as far as the fun factor goes.  I'd do this one just to get my steps in but will pop in the dance walk when I'm looking for a good time.

I haven't yet done the bonus ""Strong Feet and Ankles"" (15 minutes) or ""Strong Knees and Hips"" (15 minutes) but I'm familiar with some of Jessica's moves and think they will be greatly beneficial for people who are on their feet all day or have issues with these areas.  I'm so happy that she took the time to add these on as these are spots that are most likely ignored when they shouldn't be.  Thanks Jessica!

All in all these walks are pretty comprehensive and target every muscle group (I'm sure I'm going to be feeling my shoulders tomorrow after the posture walk).  I liked the 15 minute fat blast DVD a bit better but had to give this five stars for the brain booster segment alone.  The music was upbeat, Jessica was a doll (as usual) and encouraging, and I did like the countdown clock that was included with each mile.  That was a great addition.  Highly recommend!",1432252800,16,2743,4.271844660194175

8712498,5,B00W85TAHE,Great video.. whether you're older like me and just need to get up and moving or any age and fitness level.. you can combine her 5 videos into a great workout. I love the brain booster one! And the 2 bonus workouts for feet/ ankle and knees/hips are not to be missed! Ive bought this for others as a gift..,1534032000,,306,4.116666666666666
8712499,5,B00W85TAHE,"This is a great cardio DVD for those who are just starting out, or to use on lighter exercise days for people who are more intermediate. Jessica is upbeat, genuine and motivating throughout the workout without being annoying or cutesy-poo. You can tell she really is passionate about making fitness accessible for everyone. I don't get bored doing this DVD which is really saying something because I bore easily. Jessica is also very careful with cueing and explaining proper form, which is so important! The DVD begins with a gentle warm up and then is broken into short segments focusing on different parts of the body which you can do alone when you are short on time, or you can do them back to back for a more complete workout. I skip the ""brain booster"" segment but if you need help with coordination you might find it fun. The rest are basic, solid aerobics without any fancy choreography to learn. Even the ""boogie down"" dance portion is super easy to master.  The best part is that Jessica has two other people assisting her - one to show higher impact variations and one (her mom!) to show completely non-impact variations. Jessica does a mix of both. There are two bonus segments for healthy knees and feet which I have not tried. I prefer to do a more thorough cool down and stretch than the one on this DVD.

You don't need any special equipment (other than good athetic shoes!) or a lot of space. I easily do this in my apartment living room with the coffee table shoved out of the way.",1533945600,,1500,4.531365313653136

8712501,5,B00W85TAHE,"A few of these programs are ""fun"" but not a huge challenge, this particular program IS a challenge and made me sore almost right away. This one is not one to jump right into, but could be fun to work up to. I can't wait to be able to take part in it again.",1531526400,,256,3.759259259259259

8712505,3,B00W85TAHE,"Not sure if it is my DVD player or the dvd, but I am not able to skip to a certain mile in the dvd. This is defiantly a slow paced walking dvd. I only got my heart rate up on one of the miles.",1528416000,,192,3.2888888888888888
8712506,1,B00W85TAHE,I had this for a while before I opened it and went to play it. The DVD would not play with any of my video programs. I believe this disc is defective because all my other videos play with no problem. Shame on me for waiting so long; now I can't reuturn it.,1528070400,,256,3.849056603773585
