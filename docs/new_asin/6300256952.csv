7807650,4,6300256952,"Combining Live concert audio with video of the concert, vintage clips, and back stage scenes...THIS IS THE FIRST VIDEO to be released as a VIDEO ALBUM & an AUDIO ALBUM ON THE SAME DATE. [Blondie released a video album shortly after an audio version of her album...prior to this one.]

Featuring the two brothers that hate each other RAY and DAVE DAVIES, this concert was one of the last triumphant tours the KINKS enjoyed. This video album features many popular KINKS tunes...LOLA, You Really Got Me, Where Have All the Good Times Gone?, and some obscure tunes like HARDWAY, VICTORIA, CELLULOID HEROES, and LOW BUDGET.

The poor quality of video is typical of 1980's video cameras, and stage lighting...nowhere near the quality of John Lennon in New York City, which was FILM to video transfer.

The quality of audio varies dependent on the VERSION your watching. VHS the worst, as VHS HI-FI hadn't been invented yet. Hey, when it was released...just seeing the artist perform the music was a MAJOR novelty...MTV had just been born!",1263081600,,1032,4.885714285714286
