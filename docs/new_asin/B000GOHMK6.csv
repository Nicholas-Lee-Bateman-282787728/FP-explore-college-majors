If this movie had been filmed using high quality film and been properly distributed it probably would have been a box-office hit.

Excellent martial arts action and very credible acting by the cast.

George Chung has GOT to be the best kicker on the planet. If you can find a copy of this movie- Grab it!",1237420800,,311,4.421052631578948
