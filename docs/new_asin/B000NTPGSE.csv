2781103,5,B000NTPGSE,"Great series.  I watched the whole thing in one day because I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.

If you saw any of the awful American attempt, Viva Laughlin, put that out of your mind.  This series, the inspiration for Laughlin, has an engaging story line, great music (even if the spontaneous dance numbers don't always make sense) and wonderful actors.  David Morrisey, Sarah Parish (currently in Mistresses), and David Tennant (the 10th Doctor Who) are a great ensemble.",1237334400,,484,4.938271604938271
2781104,5,B000NTPGSE,"David Morrissey, Sarah Parrish, and David Tennant headline an outstanding cast in this UK drama series about Ripley Holden, a casino owner (Morrissey) whose dreams of establishing a Vegas-like gambling center in Blackpool, England are dashed when the body of a dead youth turns up on his premises.  He is dogged by DI Carlisle (Tennant), whose righteous pursuit of justice is compromised when he falls for Holden's trophy wife, Natalie (Parrish).  Further complicating Holden's life are his relationships with his business partners, his two rebellious and troubled children, and his generally less-than-savory tastes.

The six hour-long episodes develop all the characters wonderfully, and the three leads give knockout performances.  The truly strange conceit of the series is that it tries to be a musical in addition to a drama, with the characters periodically breaking into pop songs.  None of the actors can really sing, so the musical numbers mostly amount to a lot of lip-synching, some of which works better than others.  But the cheesy song-and-dance routines can't detract from the impact of the story, which is for the most part the story of Holden's seemingly willful self-destruction and the efforts of his nearest and dearest to keep clear of the explosion.  The ending is immensely satisfying on many levels.

Alas, this marvelous show is only available on region 2 DVD, so US viewers would need a multiregion or region-free DVD player to enjoy it.",1229385600,16,1464,5.2

2781146,5,B000NTPGSE,"Blackpool and Viva Blackpool

I absolutely love this dvd.

Blackpool was a superb series  and the music numbers were very entertaining",1399507200,,134,5.285714285714286
2781147,5,B000NTPGSE,"Fabulous! A love story with spontaneous singing and dancing as well as a sweet, plausible romantic  conflict. Great acting. A fun and unforgettable story.",1395878400,,154,5.416666666666667
2781148,4,B000NTPGSE,"Not the best series in the world, but quite entertaining. I've been wanting to see it forever, so finally bought it! Do keep in mind that you have to watch on a player that can read UK discs. The music choices are great, and they're really well incorporated-- not like the cheesy ""Cop Rock,"" this was actually well done. The follow-up movie was painful, and I didn't make it very far into it, but the series was good.",1386720000,,417,4.358974358974359
2781149,5,B000NTPGSE,Loved Blackpool with David Tennant. Great performances by all. The story of Peter and Natalie was so great that I have not yet watched Viva Blackpool as they are not in it.  David Morrisey was great but he is the only one to return in this sequel.,1380672000,,247,4.25531914893617
2781150,5,B000NTPGSE,"I love David Tennant. Not in a healthy, ""oh that guy is a pretty good actor."" kind of way, but in a ""I would kidnap him and keep him in my basement forever"" kind of way. I bought this without really knowing the plot or any other actor other than Tennant. I knew there was music and ""that guy"" who played the Governor from Walking Dead. But holy cow! Never mind David Tennant or that every single person from Doctor Who and pretty much every BBC show ever is in this miniseries. David Morrissey is awesome. He managed to make me genuinely feel sorry for him even though he was a giant dick.

The music was okay..I kind of wish they had either completely lip synced the music or actually sung it themselves. The mixture of both was off key at times. The story was very engaging as well. There were times during the series that the murder mystery aspect felt glossed over for other story lines, but there were enough episodes where they could wrap everything up nicely and not feel rushed.

Although the second series only had David Morrissey's character and his daughter in it, I found the story to be just as engaging and funny as the first. It was actually less bogged down because there weren't as many side stories to follow.

If you are a fan of BBC shows, I highly recommend adding this one to your watch list!",1378252800,17,1314,4.377049180327869
2781151,5,B000NTPGSE,"David Tennant is one of the most talented actors to ever come out of Britain, Scotland in particular.  He has acted on stage, in movies and television, and has also done voice overs and audio books.  He's also got an astounding sense of humor and is absolutely gorgeous.  Blackpool is a very different form of entertainment.  It is a crime drama, mixed with a romance, and somewhat of a musical.  The actors sing in it, but the music is sort of playing in the background as they sing along.  It's strange at first, but when you realize it's basically the characters' thoughts in song, it makes more sense.  It's not like they're singing TO one another; it's more like they're listening to something inside their heads that goes with the situation.  I said it was strange.  But you know what?  It works!  And David Tennant is brilliant in it, as are David Morrissey (appeared in the Doctor Who episode ""The Next Doctor"" with David Tennant) and Sarah Parish (was the Racnoss in the Doctor Who Episode ""Runaway Bride"", also with David Tennant).  If you are already a David Tennant fan, you'll be thrilled with this.  If you've never seen him in anything except Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Barty Crouch, Jr.), you're in for a huge revelation.  I wish I could go back and watch this whole series again as if for the first time.  Thoroughly enjoyable!",1374883200,4,1354,4.606694560669456

2781153,5,B000NTPGSE,"Great movie, the best cast ever, and  just a great love story.  David Tennant is superb as always. David Morrisley is great. A little unnearving with the cast mouth sincking to songs.  But the movie is great, well worth getting.",1362614400,,228,4.65
2781154,5,B000NTPGSE,"It's a very weird concept to try and explain to someone.  A murder plot.  A love story.  And a bunch of singing, for no explicable reason.  Still it's terribly fun.",1362009600,,164,4.366666666666666

2781176,5,B000NTPGSE,I just started watching this and am at Ep 4.  I am from USA and it did not take me long to fall for the muscial aspects.  How FUN.  If you are a David Tennant fan it is a MUST WATCH.  So sad that it didn't continue,1354665600,,214,3.4893617021276597
2781177,5,B000NTPGSE,"I'll admitt that I'm a David Tennant fan. That's what drew me to this marvelous six-part series from the BBC. It's really a combination murder mystery/love triangle drama with some great acting from leads Tennant, Sarah Parish, and David Morrissey. Morrissey plays Ripley Holden, proprietor of an amusement arcade that he dreams of turning into a casino in Blackpool, Parish plays his wife Natalie, and Tennant plays DI Peter Carlisle. Musical numbers are used to further the plot several times per episode, with the actors singing along with the original recordings. I thought this was done very effectively. The songs are drawn from pop music ranging from the 1960s through today, from Elvis Presley to Elvis Costello to The Clash. It originally aired on the BBC in 2004 and slightly shortened episodes aired on BBC America several years later. The six episodes are terrific. I agree with another reviewer that it's great for brightening my mood.

I haven't watched Viva Blackpool yet, which was filmed several years later and is on the third disk. The cast is a bit different for that, as Tennant was already playing The Doctor on Doctor Who.

I love this series enough that I purchased a region-free Toshiba DVD player from Amazon so I could watch it as well as other BBC titles that have not been released for the American market. I'm so glad I did!

2781178,5,B000NTPGSE,"Disclaimer: I haven't seen the follow up - my review is of the original series.

TV drama at its best, and clever into the bargain.

I only rented this because I wasn't sure, from what I had read, what I would make of it.

Now I've added it to my wishlist!

It's a bit of an odd concept - gritty northern drama meets musical meets murder investigation meets comedy - but it's very very well done, with a brilliant cast.

Morrissey is, as someone else has said, born to play this role; sleazy but compelling, by halfway through the first episode I very much wanted to see how he would turn out. A performance that makes what could have been a bit of a one-trick-pony character into a complex and interesting man, for whom, in spite of everything, one still has compassion. An outstanding performance.

Parish and Tennant are the heart of the drama, at turns heartbreaking, beautiful, and sexually charged.

Tennant in particular shines as the disciplined policeman falling into potential corruption and having his life turned upside down. Fascinating performance to watch and impossible to take your eyes off him in so many scenes. Compelling.

All the supporting cast are strong, down to workers at the amusement arcade, Ripley's family, the religious ""nut"" outside the front door (fantastic - better known as Filch in the Harry Potter movies but a brilliant cameo in this role) and, possibly a personal favourite, DCI Carlisle's (Tennant) sidekick Blythe.

Impeccable. Watch it.",1327276800,7,1479,4.884
2781179,5,B000NTPGSE,BBC Management could use a few tips in how to make more money.  Or maybe they don't want any.  I saw this series on BBC America and have wanted the DVD set but have yet to find one which will play in my American DVD player/recorder.  I find it really irritating to find it advertised in a format which is absolutely useless to me and most of America.,1325116800,16,350,4.117647058823529
2781180,4,B000NTPGSE,"It is not the greatest drama ever and I won't spoil the murder ""mystery"" for you, but the solution is really obvious, but the murder was not the main point of this show. It was all about people randomly singing and dancing and that part ROCKS! The musical numbers are at times hysterical and stuck with me long after I finished watching this. Luckily, the DVD lets you go back and watch the musical numbers without having to wade back through the plot. David Tennant singing the Smiths is worth the price alone!!!! There will never be a better TV wedding than the one in Blackpool. Just skip Viva Blackpool. It sort of ruins the fun.",1312675200,3,633,4.4655172413793105
2781181,5,B000NTPGSE,"I have this series on tape and love watching it. It can brighten your mood in no time with all the action. Great entertainment and for every fan of David Tennant and David Morrisy it a Must have.

2781183,4,B000NTPGSE,"After catching clips, I went for the full version of Blackpool. I did not enjoy the follow up Viva Blackpool (included with the set), but the price was worth it just for the Blackpool series. This is a different type of show with the actors singing over songs, but the story is very engaging. I mainly wanted to see this for David Tennant and he did not disappoint.  What really won me over is the music.  The song choices are amazing and really fit the story.",1266192000,4,460,4.337209302325581

8181338,5,B000NTPGSE,"David Morrissey is fabulous as he is in most everything he does.  Even when I don't like a show he is in, I love watching him anyway.  There is no end to his talent,  whether acting, writing, directing...he does it all so well.  And David Tenant of course is wonderful.  This is a funny, sort of dark mystery/comedy with great music and acting and a fun story line that keeps you guessing.  Yes, even when you know Morrissey's character is a jackass you still can't help but like him.  This is true of a number of things I have seen him in.

8181340,2,B000NTPGSE,"Perhaps this 2004 offering from BBC just caught me on an off day; but it's the worst conglomeration of genres I've seen in ages.  The idea of melding mystery and comedy into a musical is risky;  this show failed on all counts.  I love mysteries but don't know whodunit because I could only bear to watch the first disc.  I tried to look at it as a spoof but it still left me cold.  Even favourite actors such as David Tennant, Kevin Doyle, Georgia Taylor, Sarah Parish and David Morrissey couldn't save the day.  Much of the music was unfamiliar and didn't really seem to fit the scene.  Certainly some may enjoy this but I'm not one of them.",1430697600,,642,4.34453781512605
