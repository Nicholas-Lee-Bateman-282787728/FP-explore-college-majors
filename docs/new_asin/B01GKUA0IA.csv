Well, Hasbro on the other hand didn't use their heads when they were making Transformers the 1986 Movie by killing off Optimus Prime & the original Transformers characters in it. Which impacted most Transformer fans & caused the denial of making a sequel . The Transformers cartoon had its mistakes. But this time as for the Jem movie, Hasbro was innocent. Hasbro had nothing to do with the making of this movie. It was Jon Chu who did this. Hasbro is the world's best toy making company, but not the best supportive of their cartoons based on their toys. ""Let's now focus on getting Shout Factory to release the Jem Super Sunday version of the 5-part pilot mini-series that was released in May 1986 just before the Jem series came on."" We Jem fans need that on DVD. ""You know?, the one with Manny Malone going into the one-hour photo store. (""But I'm not talking about the OAV version from F.H.E."").",1516752000,,967,4.563218390804598
