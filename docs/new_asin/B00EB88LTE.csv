8603410,5,B00EB88LTE,"Steve Coogan does it again! His comedic timing is on point in this movie and as always his delivery is top shelf! Multiple laugh out loud moments, the jokes were very smart and well written. Definitely worth a viewing for any comedy fan and there's a great chance you will watch this more than once...",1438300800,,301,4.490909090909091

8603412,3,B00EB88LTE,"Whether you like ALPHA PAPA depends very much on whether you like Steve Coogan's monstrous creation Alan Partridge.  The setting once again is Norwich, eastern England, where Partridge works as a DJ on the mid-morning slot.  He inadvertently becomes involved in a hostage crisis when his erstwhile colleague Pat (Colm Meaney) holds some of the radio station employees, having been deemed surplus to requirements by the new owners.  Needless to say Partridge exploits the situation for his own ends, as he tries his best to enhance his media image while ostensibly working with the police to resolve the crisis.  The script gives Coogan plenty of comic opportunities, as well as allowing Partridge to show- once more - just what an obnoxious person he actually is.  However the film runs out of steam about two-thirds of the way through, and comes to rely for its effect on tired toilet jokes.  The ending is a happy one - needless to say - but this viewer has to admit that they were relieved when it came.",1389744000,3,1006,4.786127167630058
