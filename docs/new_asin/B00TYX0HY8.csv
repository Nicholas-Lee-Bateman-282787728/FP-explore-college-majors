7026040,5,B00TYX0HY8,"I am always open to trying new styles of yoga, new teachers and new practices. That being said, the style in these videos is very different from what I would normally practice or even what I myself teach. I do not think you could get much more different from DDP Yoga than Namaste TV. But often something different is exactly what you need. I can say having done all of these workouts at least once now that they will end up being a regular part of my practice.

The description of this season on Namaste TV's website is that ""is more than just an exercise video- it's an experience that will calm your mind, strengthen your body and inspire your soul. Master yoga teacher Erica Blitz guides you through 13 classes, all filmed amid the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest."" And does it ever deliver on that promise. These are excellent classes and I can honestly highly recommend them. Give these workouts a try you will not be disappointed! And now a quick mini review of each episode.

Episode 301 Soften the Edges
Hips and Hamstrings
This was an awesome flow. As my first introduction to Namaste TV it was a wonderful experience. I broke a light sweat and really felt the engagement during the flow. This style is faster than most styles I practice but slower than some I have tried. To be honest it is a very nice middle ground. I know I will be coming back to this flow often.

Episode 302 Align Your Axis
Twists
This was much more intense than episode 301. There were 2 moves I have not encountered before, which is always exciting and a learning experience. The pace was excellent, at the end I could not believe that the 20 minutes had passed.

Episode 303 Warrior Wisdom
Hip Opening Sequence
This was an awesome sequence. Two odd parts were no guided transitions from warmup to flow, or from flow to cool down. But even with that it was an excellent practice. It was a great workout and the cool down was incredible.

Episode 304 Release and Restore
A Sequence for Your Spine
This was another really good sequence. There were a lot of chair poses during the flow part of this video. Great transitions from warm up to flow and then to cool down. I can see doing this towards the end of the day often to close out my practice for the day.

Episode 305 Create Your Calm
A Grounding Flow for Hips and Hamstrings
I love that when Erica designed these sequences, that she things of small things, like when doing cross legged forward folds, she has us switch which leg is in front and does the pose again. It is some of these small details that make this video and the whole series so great.

Episode 306 Reflect and Connect
Open Your Shoulders, Hips and Hamstrings
There was a lot more floor work on this one. Very different from the first 5 videos. It is an excellent sequence. With some subtle variations to work into the Shoulders, Hips and Hamstrings in different ways.

Episode 307 Balance and Bend
Balance and Connect
This video has an awesome warmup. There is the addition of mudra's for the first time this season. The balance sequence is just wonderful. One of my favorite video's in the whole season.

Episode 308 Bhakti Flow
Open Your Upper Back and Shoulders
This is another of my favorites from the series. Even without the guided transition from warmup to flow. There are a lot of eagle arm variations in this sequence and also a few full eagle poses. Just an excellent flow!

Episode 309 Open and Ground
Stretch Your Shoulders and
Strengthen Your Upper Back
This was one of the hardest flows in the series. It is a great sequence. A number of sphinx and dolphin poses add a lot of variety into this video. This one is intense compared to some of the others.

Episode 310 Stabilize and Center
Strengthen Your Core and Open Your Hips
This was a good flow. It combines elements used in many of the others. I enjoy the subtle variations offered across the different videos in the series. Could really feel this one in the core after all the boat poses.

Episode 311 Prana Flow
Open Your Shoulders and Hips
This was nearly a perfect flow. It was seamless from warmup into flow to cool down. Absolutely wonderful practice. Loved this one.

Episode 312 Grace and Gratitude
Backbending Practice
This was a good practice. But from other practices I have done the backbending was pretty minimal. I was concerned before beginning what the backbending would included but there was nothing to be concerned about. It is good but not one of my favorites.

Episode 313 Reconnect and Refine
Hip Opening and Abdominal Strengthening
We encounter full bow pose for the first time this season. There is a lot of time on the mat, and far less standing work in this sequence. Physically it is much more demanding than some of the other videos.

The length of these videos at 22 minutes each is excellent for short practice or stinging them together into a longer session. You can also combine them with other practice to round out your time on the mat. Some of the sequences start to feel familiar across the videos but that is to be expected and in many ways is a benefit as you become more and more familiar with Erica's style. The Top Pros and Cons of these videos are:

One of the best things about these videos is their length, you can choose to do any one of the 22 minute sequences by itself or string a few of them together into a longer practice. You could even use these to supplement other styles of practice for an awesome change up. Some of the sequences start to feel familiar across the videos but that is to be expected and in many ways is a benefit as you become more and more familiar with Erica's style. The Top 3 Pros and Cons of these videos are:

Pros:
Awesome flows
Amazing cinematography
Incredible production quality
4K resolution for large displays
Focus on balancing both sides in poses others often do not

Cons:
All women cast
Very few modifications offered

These 13 classes are great. I highly enjoyed them and know I will come back to them often. The cinematography is incredible, following the same flow with between one and three examples on screen, in city scapes, nature, on water. The videos are amazing to watch let alone practice with. And the original compositions by Tim McCauley perfectly accompany both the practice and videography. And I am looking forward to trying more from Namaste TV. You will not be disappointed by these great 22 minute practices!",1445644800,16,6396,4.555749128919861
7026041,5,B00TYX0HY8,"This Namaste new Season 3 is also a very nice addition to the previous ones. I love the flow, the energy and the sceneries. I miss the soothing voice of Kate Potter, but keeping an open mind, we practice in a positive light and moving forward, growing and keeping our bodies and minds healthy. Thank you Namaste team for yet another great production.",1445644800,2,350,4.571428571428571
7026042,5,B00TYX0HY8,"Having practiced season 2 4-6 times a week for a year and a half, I was looking for a change.  I was deliberating on this season for a while because of some of the not so positive reviews, but let me tell you, I love it!  The production is beautiful, definitely the best yet.  The flow is really good and I really appreciate how she is very symmetrical - always does both sides of the body with each move.  I found with Kate Potter that a few of the series left one side off at the end of the sequence.  Since you do each move several times, it wasn't too big of a deal, but bothered my OCD and need to be symmetrical.  Also, yoga is about balance...  Anyway, yes, as other reviewers have said, Kate Potter is very repetitive, starting from the beginning with each sequence in the series, which is kind of cool because you find by the end of doing the same posture several times in a row, you have a better stretch and can go deeper.  However, it doesn't tend to keep your attention after a while since you know what is coming.  Erica's style is definitely different but I really enjoy it, and it does feel more like a practice you would get in an actual yoga studio.  It is slightly more challenging, but anyone who can do Season 2 can definitely do this.  I would also say to other reviewers' complaints that yes, Erica's voice is a change, but it really is relaxing and she gives very good instructions.  I also definitely prefer the music in Season 3, more relaxing and less synthesizer.  Another note is that I have noticed sometimes I have either had to move my mat position or face away from the TV because of the flow, which I am getting used to, but even if I can't see the TV for a move, her instructions are so direct that I am still able to follow just by her voice.  Another positive change is that the yoga models' bodies are more yoga-ish and not so dancer-ish as in the Kate Potter seasons.  In the Kate Potter seasons, the models look amazing, but definitely look like they are doing other activities in addition to yoga.  In this season, the models have the softer yoga body type, which I appreciate as it is more realistic.  Also, in this season, the yoga outfits are a little more modest - if you've seen the Kate Potter seasons, you know what I mean!!  If you are getting a little bored with Season 2, I would say definitely buy it - you will love it!",1445644800,14,2372,4.256696428571429
7026043,5,B00TYX0HY8,"I was hesitant to purchase Season 3 based on the reviews for Season 3 Part 1.  It took a few episodes for me to get used to the flow of the main sequence.  By the fourth episode I was loving Erica Blitz's instruction & sequences.  Seasons 1& 2 are Hatha Vinyasa style yoga & Season 3 is Power/flow, Vinyasa style yoga. I can see why some people are turned off to this season.  I enjoy the cardio aspect of Power yoga.  I often combine 2 or 3 main sequences for a longer workout.  I'm so happy I ignored the reviews.  I purchased the complete season directly from the Namaste TV.  I look forward to Season 4.",1444435200,10,607,4.172413793103448
7026044,4,B00TYX0HY8,"I have practiced Kate Potter's AMAZING seasons for five years now, and am enjoying Erica Blitz's Season 3 posture phrases immensely! I love how you almost always stay in Child's Pose from the warm-up and transitioning into the main portion of the sequence  it feels so fluid that way! I love the really slow and controlled release from modified plank to the ground. I love that we have Camel Pose to practice! I LOVE all of the twist variations!!! There are so many things that I wanted in my practice that are now IN my practice! I almost feel like Season 3 was created just for me. I am in heaven!",1429833600,14,599,4.396396396396397
7026045,5,B00TYX0HY8,"I have used Season 1 for quite a while, so I wasn't prepared for a different narrator. At first the narrator seemed choppy. But after a couple of sequences I was used to it. This season is more challenging, which is exactly what I was looking for! I love all of the variety & the fact that my muscles are actually a bit sore the next morning after doing 2-3 dynamic sequences.
I've already recommended this video series to my sister, & I recommend it to anyone else who is ready to step up their yoga practice a bit!",1485648000,7,516,4.222222222222222
7026046,5,B00TYX0HY8,"I think this Third Season is even better than the previous two.  I like Erica's cueing and tone of voice (voice-over) more than Kate Potter's and the video/production quality is superb!  Not for beginners, but for someone with at least some Yoga experience, who knows the basic asanas by their name (in English). Fantastic set, absolutely beautiful to watch, soothing music and great variety of practice.",1480377600,,404,5.106060606060606
7026047,5,B00TYX0HY8,"These are all great twenty minute sequences.  I have all three seasons.  Waiting for season four to come out on DVD.  Although I am a yoga fanatic, I generally only have short periods of time to devote to the practice.  All three seasons present manageable yoga sequences for any level.  Beginners may need some repetition to feel comfortable with this type of yoga.  Nevertheless, none of the dvds are exceptionally challenging, just good mid-range yoga classes.",1479254400,,463,5.026315789473684
7026048,5,B00TYX0HY8,"I now have all three seasons of Namaste. This is the best of the three. Each segment targets a different area of the body or has a specific goal. I found that helpful. Each episode is intense enough to stand on its own, but can be linked with others to get a longer workout. I particularly like Erica's narration; her cues are clear and easy to understand.",1477526400,2,356,4.3283582089552235
7026049,3,B00TYX0HY8,I watch the show but the DVD is choppy .,1476144000,,40,3.1
7026050,5,B00TYX0HY8,"*Free product provided for evaluation and review.*

All these episodes are just beautiful.  The scenery and demonstrators are just gorgeous, and the music is relaxing and throws me into a meditative state.  It's just really a pleasant experience.  There's one scene that is in some beautiful forest with lots of moss- it takes my breath away.  (Episode 3 has a lot of it.)

Each episode has the menu options of:
-Play ALL
 --intro
 --warm up
 --main sequence
 --cool down

The instructions are excellent, and it is easy to follow along with.  Some of the main sequences get very difficult for me, because I am a large woman, but I'm able to modify as I go and keep going.  The cool downs and warm ups are generally quite easy for me to do.
The names of positions is mentioned, so even if you know nothing at all about yoga, you can follow along, follow the directions and look at the screen, and gradually you will learn the names without any additional effort.  At times the narrator/instructor also introduces inspirational concepts and vocabulary unique to yoga.  It's not often, and it's brief with an explanation, so learning is done by simple immersion.

Some episodes do focus on muscle groups.  For instance, Episode 6 really hones in on shoulders, hips, and hamstrings.  I like that one a lot after sitting at a desk typing for a long time.",1471910400,,1349,4.6680851063829785
7026051,4,B00TYX0HY8,If you like big flippers it is recommended. It is heavy and shows a lot strenght. Not easy to flip open and requires some practice. Solid knife.,1471478400,,144,4.37037037037037
7026052,5,B00TYX0HY8,"This season is different than the first two seasons but change is good. I'm a bit of a beginner when it comes to yoga. I have done Bikram yoga many times at different studios, but have only recently started doing yoga at home and these videos are wonderful. They are very well made, have beautiful scenery, which may sound odd for a yoga video, but it makes it easy and fun to follow.  This season is a bit different than the first two seasons, but I really like this season as I have liked the previous two seasons as well.  If this season was the same as the previous two then I would probably just watch those, but I like that this season is a bit different to change things up.",1459209600,,681,4.190839694656488
7026053,5,B00TYX0HY8,"long time practicing season one and two...was a bit of a transition to Erica Blitz...but sticking with it was well worth it! The pacing is a bit faster...the production is fresh...and this series is great ""next step"" in the Namaste series. Very happy to have it!!!",1455148800,,264,4.760869565217392
7026054,5,B00TYX0HY8,"I aim to do yoga every day. Sometimes it's a class at a studio, sometimes it's my self guided practice and sometimes it's a video. I have varying amounts of time to devote to my practice. I often have to squeeze a little in on busy days, which is exactly why I love this video. The 22 minute practices are perfect for a morning or nighttime routine, or just squeezing a sequence in while my son is napping. I often string together a couple sequences to make a 45 minute session.

These sequences have a couple things I really enjoy. First, I can't speak highly enough of the scenery. This definitely helps me get into the mood. I feel transformed out of my family room and into the beautiful scenes featured. I am a pacific northwest resident, so I really feel at home with the scenery. The transitions from scene to scene are flawless and don't distract at all from the practice. The amount of time spent filming and editing these episodes is mind boggling.

Second, I love the actual episodes and variety. There is a brief warm up and cool down with every episode. The bulk of it is the actual workout. Each episode has a focus, such as ""twists"", but I have to say that it doesn't focus exclusively on that one type of exercise. There is still a nice variety of stretches in each episode. I like putting a couple workouts together. I am posting a picture of the menu's so you can see how easy it is to just skip the warm up or cool down and do multiple main sequences.

Lastly, I love that this isn't a step by step guide on how to do yoga. That may be a turn off for some, but I get tired of watching videos where I have to rehash every single time I watch it the correct way to preform each posture. I have one video that goes into depth on the correct way to do each pose and after doing it a couple times I grew tired of the chatter and gave it to a friend. This video gives some brief instructions, but it relies on having some basic knowledge of correct form. I recommend getting a beginners video if you've never done yoga before like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rodney-Yee-s-Yoga-for-Beginners/dp/B001F76OKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rodney Yee's Yoga for Beginners</a>

Overall, I see a wonderful value in these episodes for a light, fun yoga practice. I enjoy using them for brief practices. I alternate them with some of the power yoga DVD's I enjoy and yoga classes. I was sent this DVD for testing and review purposes. That has no bearing on the rating or review I am giving it. I always review products honestly based on my experience with them. This is a just a solid DVD with wonderful,. short sequences for the beginner-intermediate yogi.",1455148800,13,2705,4.605809128630705

8703356,2,B00TYX0HY8,"After reading the reviews I was very excited to order the DVDs. My excitement however has faded since receiving them. I enjoy yoga and believe it is a necessary part of my lifestyle. I want my yoga practice to feel like a workout and recovery from the other activities that rank ahead of yoga for me. I ordered season 3 thinking it would be somewhat challenging, not that I'm any expert at all. This simply does not satisfy my needs. I don't want to feel like drinking a hot tea and watching daytime talks shows after a workout. I will return to the DVDs I've been using for the past 10(?) years. I guess sometime it really doesn't pay to stray.",1504915200,,645,4.338842975206612
8703357,4,B00TYX0HY8,"The quality of yoga sequence, video, location, editing, and voice-over are all great.  I just hope that there is a way to run through multiple segments in one continuous flow.  I understand that this was made for a TV series, but it is disruptive having to play multiple episodes to have an 1-hour yoga practice (with 1 warm up and 1 wrap up session).",1504742400,2,351,4.46875
8703358,5,B00TYX0HY8,This entire series of DVDs is absolutely amazing!!! I've been doing yoga for close to 20 years... with these I get the dynamic flow with some advanced postures that I'm used to from doing Vinyasa yoga.... But without having to go to a class to get it.... which is truly fantastic!!! Would 100% recommend this entire series to anyone wanting to do Vinyasa Yoga without leaving home!,1500336000,,381,4.701492537313433
8703359,5,B00TYX0HY8,"I follow Namaste Yoga on Z Living, channel 662 every single day. I have followed both Kate Potter and Erica Blitz. I like them both and at first thought I would like Kate better; however, I find that she repeats the same sequence three times on each side and sometimes actually has forgotten to do a side. This repetition reminds me of 80s aerobics where you could do this in your sleep. I found Erica's flow to be much more interesting as you do not know which pose will come next and I find her workout to be much more interesting and challenging. I like her soothing voice and her instructions as well as the background, soothing music and scenery. As a result, I am buying season three with Erica Blitz as narrator and still look forward to tuning into Z Living every morning and posing with her flow.  Nothing against Kate Potter, but I get bored with the repetition of the same pose three times on each side. Twice is enough and when she forgets a side, I get all messed up.",1497312000,,980,4.355191256830601
