This movie gives great insight and symptoms to watch out for and how to handle/how not to handle circumstances.

2527947,4,B000EQ5V40,"I am a huge fan of Lindsay Wagner, and I think Olympia Dukakis is a fantastic actress. They both did a great job in FIRE IN THE DARK--especially Ms. Dukakis. If I didn't know better, I would have thought the actress had gone to the Great Theatre in the Sky the minute the director yelled, ""Cut! That's a wrap.""  The only reason I didn't give this movie 4 stars is because it feels dated. Compared to the movies of today, it is paced a little slowly. Even so, I sympathized with both characters. I felt their every frustration and their every fear. I even shed a few tears. If you are a fan of either of these actresses, or if you know someone going through the trials and tribulations of growing old and frail, it is worth adding to your collection.",1315958400,9,749,4.3120567375886525

However, when Olivia falls and suffers a hip injury she and her children realize that ""age is caching up""  This is what the movie is about- the children and the woman ""coming to grips"" with the fact that she can no longer live in her home alone.  The sensitive,and mature way in which the entire family come to a conclusion as to what the next ""steps"" should be is what the movie is about.

2528339,4,B000EQ5V40,"Extreme loss of independence that can accompany advanced aging is a tricky subject to take on in film, without overwhelming one's audience. An ensemble of gifted artists, including Olympia Dukakis, Jean Stapleton, Lindsay Wagner, and Edward Hermann perform in this pretty sobering, engaging, and important film, which zeroes in on an aging woman's and her peers' struggle to master shifting physical and mental statuses; as it highlights its effects on family. That search for both emotional and physical safe space is extremely powerful.  Emily (Dukakis), in the lead, is that spry, crusty, self-reliant 75-year-old, who suddenly finds herself utterly helpless. Jean Stapleton, as Henny, adds a bit of comic relief as she delivers some of the best and funniest lines that define her just-keep-on-trucking philosohy of life.  Janet (Lindsay Wagner) is Emily's committed, decision-making daughter, who is called upon for some really tough ones. This is the nitty-gritty of this stage of life, well told by David J. Hill and solidly directed by David Hugh Jones. A very valuable piece, particularly for families dealing with these life events. Recommend.",1483747200,3,1152,5.430167597765363

I have known for a long time I need to make contingency plans. I do not want to be found by someone. After viewing this film I have made arrangements that my children will email me at least every third day. If they do not hear from me they will call neighbors. Now, everyone feels more comfortable.

OLympia Dukakis plays an 80 something recently widowed woman. Her daughter lives two hours away, her son lives nearer but rarely visits. It is not until she talks and breaks her hip that her children must move out of their lives and think of her. Lyndsay Wagner plays the daughter who loves her mother, but caring for her will change everyone's lives. Facing the hardships of elder care, the finances and all that entails is part of this film. This is not entertainment as much as informational. As I said, a must see for anyone with older parents.

2528525,5,B000EQ5V40,"Very well done in a soft way. It even pointed out the adult siblings who take grandma's things, ask for money yet barely visit and when they do it's to take valuable things out of the house because they feel entitled even if they are the favored child...and offer nothing but excuses when asked to help in little ways, the mother they are stealing from. Family dynamics close to death are horrible.  The acting was right on and the small look into what was happening with grandma's friends too was interesting. A home these days is probably better than staying in the family home with all the low paid CNA help, and high turn over can make it a nightmare. Your house is ransacked by a stranger, stealing, assaults, a whole litany of things that your vulnerability with folks saying it was just in your head is not a good choice...better a home that is legally accountable for a certain amount of care. And no one really wants to be a burden on their family...so it was a really good film to talk honestly about these issues before it's really needed .  SPOILERS: .She was broken into and neither son was concerned, no one called the police. And the robber, that I'm not so sure wasn't the gimme son, the believed was a name in the paper the gimmie son hired and didn't check out. He even told her he couldn't cut her grass and quit. One thing that really hit home was when grown son says he will come for dinner, not even thinking she might need help and that it is a big deal for her and they either barely show up in time to ask for money again and leave quickly. Or cancel at the last minute as if it was no big deal to her, who has been planning, saving money to buy groceries for a meal that won't be eaten.

2528543,1,B000EQ5V40,"I am a 65-year-old woman and wish I had not watched this movie, but for some reason just could not turn it off. The tragedy here is that this was a very ""nice"" family with assets; however, they ALL behaved badly. The son whined because he was a school teacher and didn't have as many resources as his sister who was a college professor married to a college professor (his sister did encourage him to go back to school so he could teach at college too). This 45-year-old brother lived near his Mom and ""used"" her to get his laundry done and as a bank when he needed money which was not the result of him being a school teacher (I know a lot of school teachers who don't treat their Mothers like that!). The 40-ish-year-old daughter lived two hours away in her ""perfect"" world and did step up to help her Mom, but not until her Mom's house was broken into by the jerk the son found in the newspaper to cut her grass. Her husband and son ""made nice"" about it at first, but it didn't take long for the Mom moving into ""their perfect and blissfully successful world"" caused problems. Along the way the Mom lost a dear friend and another succumbed to dementia (her daughter left her with a friend who was turning her over to the state). And there was also focus on the psychology of the son being the Mother's favorite as well as other common family-centered issues that were painful to watch. Needless to say this was an extremely disturbing and sad movie. It ended with the Mom going to live in an estate-like VERY nice nursing facility so everyone was happy. Right! Okay, I get it that getting old is a problem for the rich and the poor and and the smart and the not as educated family who ""have to take care of the old family member.""  Yes, it was a ""painful to watch"" movie for an ""old"" person like me who is only going to get older. And by the way, socially/economically, I fall somewhere between this rich family who had resources to deal with the Mom and her friend who was about to be turned over to the state for care. The moral was if you have money, you get to (EVENTUALLY) go live in a NICE place to be cared for, and if you don't have money you get to go to a state supported place to live out your life -- either way, your family doesn't' want to deal with you once you get old and can't make holiday meals for them anymore.

Every character was on their last nerve and every one of them dragged their feet through the ""burden"" of taking care of business.  What I perceived was the two types of people who totally expect from family members even though their words belie this fact.  And the kind of people who are actually  independent takes care of matters long before becoming incapacitated.  ie: downsizing, getting rid of everything you are no longer using (every year, if you're not using it, get rid of it), instructions on what to do with your stuff after passing,  begin visiting places that you prefer to be taken to after you can't fend for yourself, written down documentation of accounts, passwords, IRA's, talking to families or resident's that have already transitioned to get ideas, names, addresses etc.  This all prepares oneself for the inevitable. No surprises, no burden on others and a much easier acceptance for the self.  Last, but not least, we must prepare spiritually.  We have to stay in relationship with God, we must pray for others, and pray for the Lord to prepare you for what you will go  through and for the courage and wisdom to let go of this temporary life on earth and prepare you for heaven, if that's your choice.  Begin to read your  bible daily, get a book on the ""Promises of God"". Start believing what God says (Isa 7:9) and stop clinging to life that has finished its lessons.
