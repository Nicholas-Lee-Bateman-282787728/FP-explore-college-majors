The UK benefits from a health system that allows the sick or disabled to survive and be supported and go on to have a life. This cannot be said of any other country. If you haven't the insurance or the money... your child will die. So what right do we have to play God? Well, after watching this film I found myself very confused... Nothing to do with the film, but to do with how I feel about the price of life and how we associate ourselves to who, when and how the sick should be cared for.
