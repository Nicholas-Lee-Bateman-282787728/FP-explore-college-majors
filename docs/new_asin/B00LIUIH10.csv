6488036,5,B00LIUIH10,"Being from Cleveland and being a BIG Browns fan and being a Kevin Costner fan, I love this movie. No dull moments. I've watched it many times. The bigger the screen the better. I wonder how close it is to an actual draft day. Very enjoyable. It helps to be a football fan but not necessary.",1426723200,,290,4.196428571428571

6488041,5,B00LIUIH10,A good movie for anyone interested in football.  Loved it!!,1489449600,,59,4.9
6488042,2,B00LIUIH10,I am a life long fan of the NFL but this movie missed the mark for me.  What irks me without giving away the plot is that Costner's character makes series of bonehead decisions leading up to the draft and only gets rescued by blind luck after he makes his selection.  After that the movie props him up as being the best draft guru of all time when in reality he just got lucky,1484179200,,376,4.0675675675675675

6488047,5,B00LIUIH10,"I have wanted to buy this movie since I saw previews of it coming to theaters.  I'm not a Browns' fan (My dad was before he passed away.), but I have a fan of the NFL, and I think this is the type of movie to the NFL fan since it shows the inner workings of what it takes to make a trade (especially on ""Draft Day"" - the actual day, not the movie) and it has a little bit of a bit for those who want a little romance, sans the Viagra.",1458000000,,434,3.6666666666666665
