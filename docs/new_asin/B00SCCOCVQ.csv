6979846,5,B00SCCOCVQ,"This workout is tough and enjoyable.  The chemistry between Amy Dixon and Paul Katami makes this workout fun.  I use two sets of weights and try to use the heavier weights whenever I can in order to get the most out of the workout. I wish this workout contained a ""metabolic finisher"" like her Breathless workouts.",1431907200,2,314,4.589285714285714
6979847,3,B00SCCOCVQ,"Was so excited to receive this yesterday ,as I loved Amy's new Breathless 4 DVD and this got such good reviews. I can't put my finger on what I disliked about this workout-it wasn't too long,at about 45 min
,it was very challenging and I sweat buckets.i can always tell when a workout DVD will have dread factor for me,when I find myself clock watching and instead of feeling that post workout high,all I feel is,Thank God that's over with! I really disliked Amy's first Breathless dvd's- after suffering through those dvds once,they made it to EBay! Yes,this workout was very strenuous and challenging,but so are many others in my rotation. Since I own so many amazing dvd's,my thought is that if I'm miserable the first time doing the workout,why torture myself again! I see myself doing Amy's Breathless 4 often,as I felt so sweaty,yet energized after that one. This one I see as joining all my other  dread factor dvd's,hiding in the way back of my DVD closet",1427328000,6,963,4.6982248520710055
6979848,5,B00SCCOCVQ,"I really enjoyed this DVD, being an Amy Dixon fan. First time around, it felt a little disjointed the way it is with new DVD's, but the second time, I felt the burn and heart pumping. I loved the timer and although they both gave good descriptions, not overly chatty. You can make it easier or harder by adjusting weights and speed.
I always change things not good for my knees but didn't have to very much with this DVD. I also realized I need to work on my balance a little but that is a good thing, never good to ace everything quickly.
I find the mix of cardio and strength well balanced here and that is my favorite type of exercise. I like it even better than her BB 4 which is surprising, being a BB junkie. ; )
It went by quickly for me which is another good attribute, when I look at the clock, it usually ends up on the shelf.",1423958400,3,836,4.072727272727272
6979849,5,B00SCCOCVQ,This is an excellent workout.  I really like the visible timer during each exercise so you can count down as you go.  It is about 50 minutes and goes by quickly.  Left me feeling energized but I also worked very hard.  Nice mix of cardio and strength and the moves are simple but effective.  I would recommend this to anyone of any fitness level because you can work up to the more difficult variations or go at your own pace during each set.  Loved it.  I have been using Amy Dixon's dvds for years and Paul Katami is an added bonus on this one.,1423526400,,546,4.1923076923076925
6979850,5,B00SCCOCVQ,"In Double Down, Amy Dixon and Paul Katami, both great instructors in their own right, team up for a combined cardio and strength-training workout. Two minutes of mostly compound weight training (incorporates both arm and leg movements) are followed by two minutes of progressively more challenging cardio moves. At first the moves seem rather simple, but two minutes add up, and by the end of the interval, your heart rate is up there. The workout clocks in at fifty minutes, and while more core work at the end wouldve been nice (theres some in the cardio and weight moves), its a nice workout for when theres less time or when you don't want to think too hard about choreography.

As with other Dixon and Katami DVDs, you can always modify moves that don't suit you. An added bonus is the instructors chemistrytheyre entertaining and motivating. If you like combining weights and cardio into one workout, this DVD is worth adding to your collection.",1423440000,7,951,4.8343558282208585
6979851,5,B00SCCOCVQ,"Both of these instructors are very solid at presenting workouts and together they are great.  Paul Katami puts together the strength moves and Amy Dixon pushes you through the cardio drills.  There are 8 total components consisting of a two minute strength and a two minute cardio section.  The strength has two levels.  For one minute you learn a base move then add a move (eg- you do a squat and lunge then add a lateral raise and a front raise with the legs.)  For the cardio there are three levels of difficulty which last 40 seconds each.  I like that the strength moves cover the entire body, and that the cardio moves can be modified up or down as you choose.  If you don't want to ramp it up you can always stay with the first option shown.  The other nice thing is that the sections are timed and if you want to go at a faster or slower pace you can.  For some of the strength moves modifications are also given. I would say that this workout is suited to intermediate to advanced exercisers.  Intermediate being that you workout regularly (like 4 to 5 days a week)  Advanced people I define as - able to do high end cardiovascular training and do strength training regularly (2 to 3 times a week)  I would love to see another combo effort from these two!  (And I appreciate that the last cardio section was not too complicated cause I needed simple and strong by that point.)",1423353600,11,1385,4.3843137254901965
6979852,5,B00SCCOCVQ,This one is different from the other Amy Dixon videos and that's a great thing! It combines strength and cardio for two minute segments - Paul with the strength and Amy with the cardio. Your legs and arms will be jello by the end of it. I used 10's and 12's for this but may need to use 8's next time for some of it. Amy and Paul are a great combination - I wasn't sure how well I would like having two instructors and it ended up being really enjoyable. Can't wait to do this one again!,1423180800,5,487,3.979591836734694
8698083,5,B00SCCOCVQ,Im a huge Paul Katami fan. I have most of his DVDs. It was good to have him and another instructor I hadnt tried yet This was just good old school moves. I still got a good sweat going. Each section was in its own way challenging.,1513728000,,230,3.9148936170212765
8698084,3,B00SCCOCVQ,I have had this one for a long time and did it for only the second or third time today. It is a really good cardio workout but not great for strength. The moves are fast and hard to go heavy with the moves used. I switched back and forth from 5 to 8 pound weights and likely could have used 3 pounds for some moves. I feel like I got a good calorie burn but there are much better cardio and weight combos. I like both instructors (have several of their other DVDs); the combos here just don't do it for me.,1511136000,,506,3.9223300970873787
8698085,4,B00SCCOCVQ,"This an advanced, challenging workout. I like the transitions from cardio to weights. To me that is much more interesting than just doing one or the other, and I find I get better results. I consider myself to be a pretty advanced exerciser, but the cardio bursts were INCREDIBLY difficult - I felt like I was going to collapse by the end of each one (if I remember correctly they were a couple minutes long). The cuing isn't great, but it's not bad either. Definitely a heart pounding workout for those days when you need an extra boost.",1496188800,2,538,4.5
8698086,5,B00SCCOCVQ,I tried this DVD last night. I really enjoyed the workout. It has segments of two minutes cardio and two minutes strength training with 30 seconds rest in between them. Even though this is about an hour workout time flew by very quickly. This DVD had my heart pounding and the cardio will leave definitely leave you breathless. That is what Amy says will happen before you start and she was right. Amy is the instructor for the cardio moves and Paul is the instructor for the strength moves. Each move starts out easy and when they say double down it gets harder. With the cardio section it has two double downs as for the strength training only has one double down. I highly recommend this DVD if you are looking for a killer workout.,1490572800,2,735,4.451851851851852
8698087,5,B00SCCOCVQ,"This got great reviews and I have all of Amy's previous Breathless Body DVDs, so I was excited to try this one.  Definitely did not disappoint, especially with the intensity.  Like other reviewers said, Amy and Paul work well together and keep me motivated.  I was sweating by the second drill and pretty weary and drained by the end, but in a good way; I felt like I worked hard without the dread factor.  Will definitely keep this in rotation with her other DVDs!  Thanks, Amy!  I hope you make more of these!",1476748800,2,511,4.440860215053763
8698088,5,B00SCCOCVQ,"The workout is straight forward, perfect instruction and good for different levels of fitness. Would love to have more from Amy and Paul!",1469232000,,137,5.0
8698089,5,B00SCCOCVQ,"This is a great workout which combines cardio with weight training! Amy and Paul have great chemistry and blend so well from one exercise to the next. I like Amy because she may fool you a little - when  you do the exercises it may not feel as intense (it is not easy - don't get me wrong), but you will feel it the next day! Paul on the other hand will ""softly"" hit you hard right from the start!

I have seen great results with both these trainers and I go back to this DVD time and again when I want to do a full body work out!",1459468800,,530,3.853211009174312
8698090,2,B00SCCOCVQ,"I have 3 of her DVDs and found this one to be the most lame and slow moving, it would be good for beginners, her other ones are more of an intense cardio and the weight segments don't burn unless u cause 10# I do a lot of heavy lifting for my job though, but if u like intense workouts do one of her other breathless workouts and then do the Tracy mallet booty barre after and save your money from this one",1450051200,3,406,3.9036144578313254
8698091,5,B00SCCOCVQ,"Excellent workout. It is what I've come to expect from Amy Dixon. I have most of her other workout DVDs and love them all. The addition of weights is a welcome one and done expertly with Paul Katami, a new instructor to me. They work well together and create a whole body workout that will make you sweat.",1446336000,2,305,4.275862068965517
8698092,5,B00SCCOCVQ,"I own several of Amy's workouts and (like the rest of them), this one is intense.  A great combination of strength training and cardio.  It's a 50 minute workout, but feels much shorter thanks to the great variety of exercises and fun personalities of both Amy and Paul.",1436400000,,270,4.604166666666667
