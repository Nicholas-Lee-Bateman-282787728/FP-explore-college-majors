6890865,3,B00QYZJ826,"3 1/2 STARS FOR AN INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE BEDCHAMBER AND BRITISH MONARCHY

As you might have guessed, the actual focus of this documentary is not as sensational or salacious as the title suggests.  It is more of a history of the importance and role of the bedchamber as it evolved along with the British monarchy, beginning with the medieval era.  It is a fairly light overview with a run time of only 1 hour and weaves several topics around the central one of the bed chamber itself.  I won't give much away because historians will already know it and those who have yet to discover it would rather watch the program.  So, I will briefly mention the structure they follow.  The program is narrated by the quirky and animated Dr. Lucy Worsley, Chief Curator of Historic Royal Palaces.

A surprising amount of time is spent in actually describing the construction and fabrics used in various beds from medieval times through the state beds of 19th century aristos and wealthy, to the private chambers of Queen Victoria passing in 1901.  Along the way, Dr. Worsley visits many bed chambers from castles, palaces, and great houses, all which have played important roles throughout the British Monarchy.  We see the role evolve from witnessing consummation, to ceremonial space and access to power, to a statement of wealth and status, to it's decline of importance along with the Monarchy vs. Parliament.  Along this thread of the bed chamber role is woven loosely the story of the Monarchy itself, though that focus often wanes in and out.  Indeed, almost the first 15 minutes was almost entirely about the construction of the medieval bed and it's trappings.  We see later on many lavish materials and many famous beds.  Also woven into this story are numerous anecdotes and examples of critical moments altering the British monarchy, in part, through what happened in the bedchamber and how they went about proving it.

Though I chose to describe this program as several threads woven into a central theme, the truth is it can feel a little unfocused at times as they depart from one theme and focus on another.  Sometimes its about the monarchy, sometimes it's almost entirely a story about furnishings.  For very serious historians, I am not sure how much it will satisfy.  For the casual viewer just looking for a little history, architecture and trappings, it's a light hearted tour through generalities and still worth a watch.  I suggest a rental.",1424131200,17,2478,4.873508353221957

6890884,4,B00QYZJ826,"I really like the documentaries that Lucy Worstley does about the British palaces, clothing and history of the royalty.  She has such a great sense of humor.  For most Americans, the whole aristocracy thing is so ridiculous.  No wonder there is little left of it, except in very few countries.  After all, they are and were only people like all of us.  Still it is fascinating and one can certainly see that the extravagancies almost bankrupted countries.  Certainly, they had the opportunity to create great beauty which still exists and which the public can view in historic palaces and museums.  This documentary is more about the pageantry surrounding the bedchambers of royalty and how it changed through the centuries as royalty lost power to parliament.  A good thing, for sure.",1458604800,3,785,4.984615384615385

The emphasis of this one hour documentary is on the role of the royal bedroom in politics and public perception, but it also covers the evolution of style a bit as well. What I found the most interesting was the costs involved in making the beds themselves, and the show gives costs in modern terms so you can really get an idea of how expensive everything was. I would have preferred a bit more information on the construction of the beds themselves as well as a comparison to the sleeping conditions of non-royals.",1456272000,3,589,4.619047619047619

6890929,3,B00QYZJ826,"This was interesting but could have been done so much better.  I did not care for the narrator.  I understand she is an expert on the subject matter but I thought she was annoying as a narrator.  Someone also should have done a better job picking out her outfits.  I found the clashing colors of them distracting.  The focus should be on the informational content not on what the narrator is wearing but the bright red dress with the purplish shoes and the mint green coat were screaming to be noticed.  They went into too much detail regarding the actual beds.  It should have been called Royal Beds.  I was more interested in finding out about historical events that occurred in these rooms like the warming pan incident than how these rooms were decorated and who wove the fabric, etc.  The later was over emphasized.",1444521600,,820,4.6

6890953,4,B00QYZJ826,"I am an avid Anglophile.  I recently discovered that my Prime streaming account, through our Roku, has begun a number of ""suggested for you"" queues on the main page.  Either it's been there forever and I missed it (b/c I always go straight to my free Prime page) or it's new.  Either way, these high quality programs are NOT on my general Prime pages, so I am glad to have found them (even if I am annoyed that they don't show up in general Prime offerings - with the usual crap).

First of all, I really like that old Lucy Worsley.  I so envy her job - chief curator of  the Royal Palaces - can you imagine?  She's smart, cute and dresses in unusual colors.  Shallow, I know, but she's very watchable, IMHO.  She's natural (with her little speech impediment) and interesting.  I love watching and listening to her.  She's not an overdone phony intellectual...I like that.  My daughter and I were watching another documentary recently and a female professor was talking arrogantly and holding her chin the whole time - what a phony.  Lucy's not like that at all and with her job, you know she has to be the ultimate expert in her field.  Sweet.

This show is light fare.  An historical walk through royal bedchambers from the medieval era to the Victorian Age.  Since I'll probably never get to England, or if I do I could never get to see everything I dream about, this was a nice tour with lots of fun information.

Spoiler:  there is one phony in the show.  Dr. Anna Whitelock is in Henry VII's bedchamber.  Her ginormous red plastic ring and other over the top jewelry (and that HAIR!) totally overshadows what she's saying.  And there sits little Lucy, so sweet and simple.",1439683200,,1678,4.504983388704319

6890982,5,B00QYZJ826,"From the title one could think that this book could get a little raunchy...
But no ... its mostly how the beds have been constructed through out
various centuries  ... and of course for the English royals ... etc.
Another history book on England ... and another good one",1425686400,,270,4.510204081632653

6890985,4,B00QYZJ826,"This is not an in-depth look into history. This is a pleasant and, dare I say it, fun look at the role of the bedchamber in the royal households from medieval times to Queen Victoria. Some of the beds shown here I had not seen before and they were amazing - for example the bed Queen Anne was having built for her, presumably, to die in, although she died before the bed was completed.  Part of why I enjoyed this video was simply some of the textiles and carvings used to decorate the beds. There are some exquisite examples of weaving and embroidery that are worth seeing. I also find Dr. Lucy Worsley, the narrator, charming.",1425081600,8,628,4.413793103448276

8693373,5,B00QYZJ826,Thoroughly enjoyable and so interesting!! Dr. Worsley has an incredible knack of making old England come alive - never boring or just about dates which made history so dull in school...I've enjoyed all her shows!,1501200000,,212,5.085714285714285

8693376,2,B00QYZJ826,"The subject matter is interesting but the audio is atrocious!  When Lucy Worsley is speaking directly to the camera you can hear and understand everything she says, but when she is doing background narration the music increases in volume and you can neither hear or understand what she is saying.  This is a significant problem and it totally ruined the viewing experience.  I don't understand why a BBC program would have been so poorly produced.",1491436800,2,447,4.933333333333334
