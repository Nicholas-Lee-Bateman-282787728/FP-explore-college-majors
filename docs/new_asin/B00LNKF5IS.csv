8666965,5,B00LNKF5IS,"What a beautiful portrayal of a radio program that meant so much to me as a child in the early 1950's.  The period pictures, sound clips and historical narrative helped bring that era back to life for me.  The interviews with the few surviving cast members were engaging and informative, as well as answering the question ""What ever happened to ... "".  The program was very well-done, and could only have been improved by being longer and having more original sound clips.  (But network and financial constraints preclude such things)  I enjoyed the program very much and ended up buying another copy to give as a gift.",1408838400,,619,4.747663551401869
8666966,5,B00LNKF5IS,"This excellent documentary lets the public in on a well-kept secret (or so it seems) -- country music was broadcast over the radio before the debut of the Grand Ole Opry. The National Barn Dance, which preceded the Grand Ole Opry by about two years, was broadcast over Chicago's powerful radio station, WLS. Although that was a long time ago, Mr. Parry was able to interview many people who had significant connections with the National Barn Dance. They helped to explain how a large Midwestern city became the scene of the granddaddy of a musical genre that, over the years, has been known as hillbilly, folk, country-western, and finally country.  If you are at all interested in this unique American phenomenon, ""The Hayloft Gang"" documentary is a must see for you.",1408406400,,768,4.862595419847328
8666967,5,B00LNKF5IS,"For anyone interested in how the ""trail"" was broken to make way for the so-called ""country music stars"" of today this is a must. Great footage and a great history lesson about the National Barn Dance which was performed not in North Carolina, West Virginia, or the hills of Tennessee, but of all places..... downtown Chicago, Illinois. Who would have thunk it? Highly recommended.",1408060800,,380,4.953125
8666968,5,B00LNKF5IS,Saw this on PBS and wanted a copy of my own to watch again and again. What a fun time for the entertainment of Americana. This is a fun watch and brings back memories.,1408060800,,167,3.9411764705882355
