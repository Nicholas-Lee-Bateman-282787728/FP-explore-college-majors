7856369,5,6303949533,"Rally Vincent is your typical Bounty Hunter. Minnie May is your typical ""lolita-ish"" Explosives Fanatic. Put those two together, and any bounty you put in front of these two will result in some mayhem some Bounty Hunters would dream about.
The duo comprise the team of ""Gunsmith Cats,"" a somewhat serious action drama centering around the exploits of this duo.
For starters, Rally and Minnie May capture a Bounty, only to find out their Bounty is involved in some serious matters involving an ATF Agent, a Federal Investigation over Arms Smuggling, and a certain figure in power. When their denied their bounty, their blackmailed (Rally faces some Gun Violations, Minnie May a whole host of Explosives Violations) by our intrepid ATF Agent, who tries his darndest to keep tabs on the duo.
Near the end of Episode 1, Rally has to make a de-facto deal with her ""former"" bounty, who also puts Rally into the difficult Position of shooting the ATF Agent. What culminates next is something to see...
The Second Episode introduces a former KGB Assasin sent to deal with Rally and Minnie May. With some ""help"" from their now slain bounty, they start to uncover the arms smuggling ring, but this puts Minnie May (and shows-off the really neat Shelby GT500 Cobra in action...Animation-wise...) on a Car-Chase Scence Hollywood would never match anytime soon...
The Third Episode has the Girls getting an Award...and the Assasin Seeking Revenge!! What's the real shocker is how everything wraps up into a storyline you never expected. And just when you think everythings all wrapped up nice and neat...
As for the series, what can I say? A Lolita-ish character, Women who seem to destroy everything in sight, the Shelby GT500, Explosives, Political Intrigue, and some surprises you never thought possible...excluding nudity, what more could you ask for?
This is one perfect tape to see...if only not to be surprised at every turn, but also to be amazed at how much painstaking detail went into the movie (The ATF and the Shelby GT500 were studiously studied for the movie, and not hackmead like Hollywood...you know everything is real and all ""correct."")",1009238400,,2143,4.988826815642458
7856370,4,6303949533,"I thought that this would be another example of the ""screechy female"" anime in the same fasion as the atrocious ""Sailor Moon"" but it is not. Containing alot of good gunfights, car chases and explosions, this tale chronicles the exploits of two female detective/gun dealers who live and work in Chicago.
If you want a real treat, you could get the compilation tape that has all 4 episodes of Gunsmith Cats. Action fans, you won't be disappointed.",979516800,2,445,4.792207792207792
