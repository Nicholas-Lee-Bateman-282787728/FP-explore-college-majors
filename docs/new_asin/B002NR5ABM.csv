3965890,5,B002NR5ABM,"I loved it.  I agree with Bob, it felt like it could have been cut tighter to get it moving especial in the beginning.  An it gets all nasty but that gets paid off in the end so hang in there.  Seriously I could watch the second half of the film over and over...But I'm Bias",1348704000,,274,3.857142857142857
3965891,2,B002NR5ABM,"The one rating I saw gave the movie a 5.(??)  Which if you are into killing everyone, blowing everything up and add topless pole dancing, nude prostitutes this is your movie. The main lead ""Shane Wood-THE HITMAN"" has the super build and athletics and acting ability but his miracle escapes exceed even Steven Sagle's.  Several major production problems are; the sound quality (it is very bad, TV shows and radio announcements are impossible to hear) , half the movie shakes so bad it is fuzzy, weapons are like pop guns (rocket launchers just show a puff of flame), hero outruns a LARGE nuclear explosion (that fits in a small case???), they shot everyone, except the leads which they talk to death till the ""good guys"" shot them. They have almost every hate group represented; Hit men, prostitutes, Arabs, Nazis, insultingly stereotyped blacks(ghetto language, kept talking about eating chicken and ribs...), Bad Cops, Bad FBI, Italian mafia, stealing teamsters,... The movie does not lack for action but realism and believability is very bad (yaa I know its a movie but..). In the ending scene, Hit man is shot 3 or 4 times point blank, survives nuclear blast, walks miles through desert, military give him miracle iodine pills but leave him to die in desert,...  and he and the girl live. For the ending the hit man, AKA Shade Wood, ends up working for the FBI. Whoa thunkit?",1270944000,,1378,4.830508474576271

8377308,4,B002NR5ABM,"This is a very typical 1950's western; we've seen many others more or less the same.  Still, it's well done and is worth watching but only if you really like old westerns or if you're a fan of both or either of the stars: Rory Calhoun or Anne Francis",1438819200,2,250,4.1020408163265305
8377309,5,B002NR5ABM,"Frankly, I am taken aback at the poor, basically unhelpful reviews for this fine example of Calhoun's westerns. I know it's not done to criticise other reviewers, but if you take the trouble to go on the page and the film....This Warner Archive Collection of the 1957 MGM film is an excellent Cinemascope transfer (bars top and bottom), clear B/W picture and good sound. It also includes the trailer (but I advise you watch that after the film). Calhoun is ""The Hired Gun"" employed by rancher John Litel to bring his daughter in law (Anne Francis) back from New Mexico to Texas to be hanged for murdering Litel's son. This he does despite Chuck Connors, Apaches, and the lady herself. Director Ray Nazarro goes at it with gusto, and the location filming is spot on. Enthusiasts will spot unbilled Chuck Roberson and William Tannen. An excellent unpretentious western crammed into 64 minutes. Recomended. (5 stars because it's good and the print is too)",1437955200,11,952,4.846625766871166
