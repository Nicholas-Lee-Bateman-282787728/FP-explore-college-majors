7831041,1,6302794757,"When watching this TV movie, there are blackouts and long pauses  between scenes, and the film's heavy hands are so laden with corn that one feels  cheated out of the commercials.  DA and GCS are dragged through syndicated  citcom leftovers in a plot that every viewer knows before watching.  Minimal elderly hijinx ensue, and the life's lesson is regurgitated  shamelessly.  Scott's cliched veediot ""mother"", a slapstickily  inept hitman, and an inexplicable/unexplained mute punk girl provide the  gratuitous sideplots.  In short, anyone who would like to own this movie  should already have taped it of the tele. Lo siento.",967161600,,626,5.285714285714286
