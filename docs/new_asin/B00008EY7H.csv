1841084,4,B00008EY7H,"While Cirque de Soleil is amazing to see on stage, there are some things that can be done on film that don't make it on stage. This is not just a performance of incredible acrobatics, but a story filled with wonder, tragedy and love. The music will haunt you for days afterward, and the feelings stirred in your heart will bring more life into your days.",1068076800,,354,4.378787878787879
1841085,4,B00008EY7H,"This was a good DVD release.  While not having as many features as Varekaki, they tried to put some good stuff on the disc.
As far as the show goes, it was so-so.  I have seen every Cirque show many times, some in person, some on video.  Quidam is my favorite, with Varekai and Dralion tied for a close second.
It was nice to see the show finally, as I have only seen the story-movie Alegria, and it ties in really nicely once you've seen the cirque show.
Personally, I think threre's a LOT of wasted time on this one.  There are less show acts, and more theatrical stuff.  Too many clown acts, and drawn out boredom (much better than some of the older ones, but still not up to par with the more current shows).
I think the Fast Tracks (long trampolines) and the Russian Bars are the best parts of this show.",1066521600,5,809,4.2272727272727275

exciting, and the song ""Alegria"" I think played throughout much of the show.  This filmed production dragged for me.  Not
bad, just not as good as I had hoped.",1393027200,,282,4.403846153846154
1841209,5,B00008EY7H,The passion that these artists put into each performance has me in total awe.  I feel kind of bad that I don't have anyway near that passion for my work.  The music is stunning.  The costumes and makeup are incredible.  The athleticism of the performers is inspirational.

When I visited them last year for their birthdays, I presented them with the Alegria CD and their fantasy costumes.  The night was SO magical.  They put on their best ""show"", dancing to the music for all of us!!  Those memories are SO precious!  The CD was great and really captured the Alegria I saw in person!  Thank you!

1841278,5,B00008EY7H,"Alegria is actually not one of my favourites of the Cirque du Soleil Series. I actually bought this for mom because this was at the top of the shows she loves. Her favourite is the Contortion Act which is shown halfway through the movie. My favourite acts were the Flying Man and the Fire Act. Both are pictured on the cover of the case too. Cirque du Soleil is one of the best series of shows ever done. I had the privilage of seeing ""O"" in Las Vegas. It is well worth to own these on DVD as well as their Soundtracks.

The DVD that I received had one bad sector in the middle of the show. It would start to stutter and continued for several minutes. I contacted Amazon, gave them the information and a new DVD was immediately on the way. Packing and return instructions were added and the entire process was made pain free with no unpleasant incidents.

Way to go, Amazon. Not a lot of you out there.

1841281,5,B00008EY7H,"I have loved this from the moment I first watched it on Bravo about 8 years ago. They showed it around Thanksgiving so to me it has a Holiday feel to it. It is absolutely mesmorizing and the music is so beautiful.. Also, I used this as a way to get my then new-born daughter to sleep every night. It was a guarantee that within the first 15 minutes she would fall asleep. The music and graceful movements of the costumed performers took her right out and at the same time I was able to enjoy a wonderful show. I don't really care for the other Cirque shows, this one just captivated me.",1286841600,,586,4.1946902654867255
1841282,5,B00008EY7H,My 15 year-old son and I went to see this show live and we both loved it.  Watching it on DVD allows us to get to see the show over and over and over.  We've watched it at least 10 times.  One of Cirque du Soleil's best shows!,1272758400,,226,3.6666666666666665
1841283,5,B00008EY7H,I think this was a wonderful DVD.  The music and acts are spectacular. My grandchildren watched it 3 times. I would suggest this for everyone.

The Fire-Knife Dance (#4) was exciting, but it was too long. The rest were boring, redundant and annoying.  I am glad that I found a good used copy and didn't pay full price for this.  I do wish they would release on DVD the shows playing in Las Vegas, they are awesome.",1242777600,,444,4.1395348837209305

A couple of the acts kind of drag on a bit, particularly the fire twirler and the trapeze artists. The ringleader character annoyed the you know what out of me. I do like the music in this show a lot, and would like to get the soundtrack.

Some of the camera angles were wierd, and would cut away from the act and zero in on the audience or sideline performers at the worst times!

Amazing acts include the hula hoops, the strong man and the contortionist! I also like the sad clown.",1169596800,2,578,4.106194690265487

It moves from one spectacular, perfect performance to another--lots of variety.  The music is superb, the characters are delightful. It's my first exposure to Cirque du Soleil. I loved all the acts, but my favorite was Elena Lev with the hoops. She is beautiful, graceful, very flexible, and she gives a flawless performance. I never tire of replaying her.

Included in the special features of this disc is an introduction to the artists behind the make-up and the costumes.  Alegria flows seamlessly and is one of my all time favorites filling the viewer with wonder, awe, and a great sense of joy.  A truly worthwhile addition to any DVD library.",1154390400,,465,4.775

1841327,5,B00008EY7H,"Incredible acrobatics, wonderful music, dazzling artistry...this description doesn't even come close to describing what you'll experience watching Alegra, one of Cirque's oldest (and best) shows. Very revamped from its first years, the show's fresher than ever, and this recording shows it.

Spanish for ""happiness"", Alegra's quite a moody show; don't let that turn you off though, it's not a depressing show, but rather one that can spark your innermost feelings. You'll know what I mean when you see one particular act: the clown's ""Snowstorm"" act. Cirque's creativity is really displayed here, since it's not your traditional ""goofy"" clown; this clown can draw tears from your eyes, it's the most expressive clown act I've seen, and it's woth a look by anyone. Every other act is equally wonderful, including a syncro trapeze, fire-knife dance and Russian bars. The music is a delightful mix of mellow and joyful tunes sung in Spanish, Italian, French, English, and ""Cirque-ish"", all beautifully performed by Francesca Gagnon and Eve Montpetit. The DVD's extras include the very interesting ""Meet the Artists"" feature, a making of featurette, an Australian-produced documentary recorded during the show's stay there, and a multi-angle feature for 2 of the acts.

The show's slightly sad feel may not appeal to the very young in the family, but it will be tons of fun for everyone else; buy it now if you don't have it (or if your budget doesn't allow you to watch it live).",1117756800,23,1476,5.1203319502074685
1841358,5,B00008EY7H,"This was excellent! I have never seen a CdS show live, but I'm looking forward to seeing one really soon since I saw this! The camera angles are superb and the sound is excellent. The Grand Finale and the Grand Entrance is spectacular. I recommend this for everyone! I am looking forward to buying Quidam also!",1110758400,3,310,4.553571428571429
1841359,3,B00008EY7H,"Not as good as others such as Varekai, Quidam, Drallion and Saltimbanco.

Seems as though it has a subtle darkness or negative feel in both the music and the show which slightly overshadows the performances.  The other Cirque shows have music that for the most part seems uplifting and joyous, but in my opinion Allegria has only one or two songs that contain joyous melodic tones.

This is Kind of ironic considering the title Allegria which means ""Joy"".",1108684800,6,455,4.8076923076923075
1841360,1,B00008EY7H,"Given the many glowing reviews of this disk, I am obviously in a minority. The show looks great, but I found the video unwatchable due to the frequent, rapid changes in camera angle. It was impossible to follow the flow of the performance, especially with acts such as the tumblers near the beginning. And the audience reaction shots are distracting and unnecessary. Most people will probably love this, though.",1105833600,14,411,4.971014492753623
1841361,5,B00008EY7H,"My obsession with cirque just after Allegria left Sydney. Live performances are obviously best but this is as close as you can get.  Thrilling performances, great music plus all the behind the scenes stuff make this a must have DVD!!!!!",1101772800,3,236,4.9
1841362,5,B00008EY7H,"All of the acts are in the DVD, except for ""Handbalancing"" which was not in the show very often back in 2001. This show is the best Cirque du Soleil touring show. Francesca Gagnon, the singer on the AlegriA CD, is in the DVD too. This makes it even better. The show is filled with beautiful emotion, from laughter, to moments that bring you an inch away from tears. After seeing the show, you feel a beautiful sense of loving life and you feel very inspired.",1098489600,5,458,4.337209302325581
1841363,5,B00008EY7H,"We recently watched La Nouba at Orlando, FL.  It was our first live - Cirque du Soleil.  We watched a documentary on PBS and it wasn't that impressive.  However, from many people's recommendation, we watched the live show and it was just breath taking!  Cirque du Soleil has very talented people doing very unique tricks, and with very artistic classy presentations and costumes.  So we bought Alegria DVD, because of their extra documentary (it was good with performers).  The DVD Alegria show was so much more than what we expected.  The camera did a very excellent job.  They did rock concerts so they were experienced and know how to present this show well on TV.  It wasn't same as live, but it was still amazing at a good price.  Also, I liked the different view from the camera (i.e. from the top view).  Vocal and music were great, with a pair of good speakers.  This DVD is worth to keep if you like these kind of stuff.",1079740800,11,929,4.497005988023952
1841364,3,B00008EY7H,"What I liked about Alegria was the wonderful costuming and the beautiful voice of Franchesca Gagnon. However, as far as the other Cirque performances go, I have to rate this one as somewhat lacking.
Personally, I think a bit too much time was spent with the clowns. While an important part of Cirque's charm, it takes away time from the acts. It seemed to me that there were less acts than in most Cirque performances and to me they appeared a bit less polished than what I'm used to seeing in this series.
On the good side, though, there were a few outstanding acts such as the tumblers and a Hawaiian fire dancer. The strong man was especially intriguing and well presented.
While entertaining, I'd still recommend Quidam and Dralion to first time Cirque watchers.",1079481600,10,766,4.681481481481481
1841365,5,B00008EY7H,"My expertise, limited, but here it is.  I've seen ""Mystere"" and ""O"" in person.  I own ""Saltimbanco"" and I own ""Alegria"", soon to own ""Quidam"".  Ratings I give ""O"" an 10, ""Mystere"" a 9.5, ""Saltimbanco"" a negative three ( -3)it really sucked, and ""Alegria"" a 9.
Alegria was fantastic.  The music was superb and singers get the highest of marks.  Their voices and presentation were as dramatic as the athletic performers.  The costumes were astounding, at times taking the viewer to another world/dimension. As always, the performers were at the top of their game.  I find it nearly impossible to say what the best acts were as they all brought a significant contribution to the show.  No bad ones.  The clowns were extremley amusing showing both great mime like ablities and deep humor.  The camera work was five stars.  I hope that if and when ""O"" or ""mystere"" are put on tape/dvd, that it is handled by the same group.  If you are ready to go to another world and be put in a perpetual state of awe, then this is the dvd for you.  Five stars.",1073692800,13,1042,4.508021390374331
1841366,5,B00008EY7H,"O.K. I love it.

Quidam is my favorite Cirque DVD with Alegria a close second. Varekai I love but the sound is horrible.

But for Alegria the sound and video quality is excellent.

I love how for the filming they placed mini-camcorders on some of the artists.

A journey to Alegria a special is fantastic.

This dosen't have as many features as Varekai but it has a lot.

I have seen Varekai (Live and not live), Mystere (Live), Saltimbanco (Not Live), Cirque Reinvent (Not Live), Nouvelle Experence (Not Live), Quidam (Not Live), Alegria ( Live and Not Live ), And Dralion (Not Live)

So out of all of the Cirque DVDs  I've seen Alegria is second best after Quidam.",1073174400,2,666,4.53781512605042
