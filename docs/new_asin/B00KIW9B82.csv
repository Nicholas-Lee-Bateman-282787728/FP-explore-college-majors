8659392,2,B00KIW9B82,Love the movie.. but the dvd itself is a knock off.. the sound is slightly faster than what the original sound would be... so be ware of you are looking for an original.,1506038400,,169,4.151515151515151
8659393,5,B00KIW9B82,"I was surprised this film. I have been pretty much buying up anything in Korean to help with my vocabulary but I was truly engrossed in this. Maybe my language skill are getting better but I think it was just damn good acting. A haunting and sophisticated picture of the reality of success without balance. It's a must see no matter what language you speak.

PS edited differently than the Korean version as this is the Chinese release.",1430006400,,436,4.589743589743589
8659394,3,B00KIW9B82,"Rough Play is a South Korean drama about a young actor named Oh Young (Lee Joon), whose intense method acting style prevents him from being employed. One day he is approached by an unscrupulous manager Kim Jang-ho (Seo Beom-seok), who promises the struggling actor to make him a big star. Oh Young accepts his offer, and Kim Jang-ho was as good as his word.

What follows is not particularly new to those who read the stories of stars and celebrities in real life or fiction. The acting is good for the most part, but the story, which often goes between that of Oh Young and of the roles he plays, is confusing, only slowing down the whole film. Also, the idea of juxtaposition of real life and play is not fully explored.

For most filmgoers, the most famous person involved in this project is Kim Ki-duk (Pieta), who writes and executive-produces. Despite his involvement, Rough Play is not original or insightful as it should be.",1423699200,,932,4.642424242424243

8659396,4,B00KIW9B82,"I'm giving this 4 stars because Lee Joon does a great job here (he plays crazy very, very well--just watch his current drama Gap Dong), but I'm not going to lie.  This film was very unpleasant to watch.  There is a LOT of violence and vileness in this movie and the director does not shy away from showing it to you.  The main character was unbalanced to begin with...and he just loses himself completely and then self-destructs basically.  The main criticism I have is that Joon's character is so unlikeable that it's sort of hard to feel any sympathy for him, especially when he does such disgusting things.  It's...an experience...and if you are a fan of Lee Joon I recommend it...however, it's sort of hard to see him now without thinking of this movie.  UGH...not a movie to watch multiple times.",1402704000,2,801,4.6453900709219855
