8409781,2,B002MKEB1U,"The film is a satire set at the end of the Edo period when people in Japan imagined that wonderful supernatural happenings where occurring as the oppressive Tokugawa shogunate came to an end. Basic story is good and the casting / acting are good. However, the film is ruined by bad English subtitles. I don't understand the Japanese language, but I have an understanding of Japan's history. The English translator uses the word ""emperor"" when the word should be ""shogun."" Of course this messes up understanding of the entire story by 180 degrees because the hero is allied with the shogun against the emperor's forces. I had to watch the film several times to clear up this baffling English subtitling. The positive and negative tense are also switched in some of the dialogue translation, again to the detriment of understanding the story. Some Edo place names like the famous Yoshiwara quarter are incorrectly spelled. Given the casting, this film deserved a better subtitle effort. The translator, possibly hired by the Malaysian film distributor, would not be considered an English speaker by readers of the subtitles. Bad tense, bad grammar, and bad knowledge of Japanese history. The film contains one profound exchange between the hero and the Death god, but it is ruined by the subtitles. One low level above computer subtitling!!!",1280534400,,1339,5.0633484162895925
