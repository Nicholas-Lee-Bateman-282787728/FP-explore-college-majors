8463876,5,B001L4I290,"Possibly the most frightening movie I have ever seen. It is filled with suspense. A real whodunit! While I was in shock from the revelation in the movie, even more happened that shook me up.
This is not a bloodbath, cheap, horror film. It is a well-thought out mystery that I was not able to guess in the first few minutes like so many movies. It surprised me.
I may have to invest in a teddy bear to watch it again. It's just that good.",1429747200,,437,4.152941176470589
