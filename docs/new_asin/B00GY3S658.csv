8628610,3,B00GY3S658,"It's the second half of the masterpiece that is The Pet Girl of Sakurasou. If you liked the first half, you'll want to see this. If you didn't like the first half, there's probably something wrong with you.

This is not a dub. It's just a Blu-Ray version of what you can watch free on Crunchyroll, subtitles and all. This means no English language for you, which may alienate some potential fans(including a couple of friends of mine), but at least Sentai didn't butcher the dub like they've been doing for other series lately, which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2.",1419379200,,572,4.447619047619048
