7878485,4,6304794495,"With our renewed rapport with Vietnam it would be good to view or review that area if the world.

This is a well-put together film documentary of a seven-month trip around Vietnam. Not one of those glossy government or fancy travelogue films, but a personal trip that was documented with letters.
There are some parts that may be gory to some people during food preparation times. Others would be appalled at the wanton destruction of forests and wild life.

I was viewing it with my wife to show her a little bit of what it was when I was there. She immediately said that the villages (especially the huts) looked surprisingly like the dwellings in the Yucatan.

Even thought this was a well put together documentary, I was disappointed as my time there was mostly in the central highlands Peiku, An Khe, Kontum and there about. And when she went up the coast she missed all the high spots.

The Montagnards she interviews were Mongol invaders; they were not the Montagnards I was aquatinted with. The Montagnards of the central highlands are approximately 14 to 16 separate people that were in the highlands before the people that call themselves Vietnamese invaded from China thousands of years ago. In essence they are to the Vietnamese the equivalent of our native Americans.

The film was still worth it as I was able to see places that I missed and the rundown state of the country today",1501200000,,1394,4.69672131147541

Our mission was to cover SEAL operations, Navy river patrol forces, local VN outposts and villages. We lived with and worked closely with local South Vietnamese in training them to defend themselves.

I am always curious at to what happened when we left in Feb. of '72. Karin Muller reports her 1998 adventure in a some what non-political, humorous light as she explores some of the places as we operated in and around the Mekong Delta. She starts her journey there and goes north to Hanoi and places in between, finding parts of the elusive Ho Chi Minh Trail, all in search of the ""real"" Vietnam. Her work is a clear-sighted, refreshingly human account of her close encounter in a now forbidden land.

This video, along with her book, ""Hitchhiking Vietnam"", completes the story. A great addition to my historical collection, giving some closure to my time in our turbulent Vietnam era. I recommend her work to any Vietnam vet.",1294704000,,1054,4.85
