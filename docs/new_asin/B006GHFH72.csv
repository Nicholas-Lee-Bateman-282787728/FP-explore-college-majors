4986941,5,B006GHFH72,"So, my girlfriend is all about dancing, and I've always been reticent to get into it.  For starters, I didn't really want to take a public lessons (in a class setting or whatever) because my two left feet are enough to embarras me on my own.  Long and short of it, these two videos (1 & 2) not only gave me the ""up"" I needed to get into it, but also gave me the nuts and bolts that my brain could wrap around.  I'm a hands on kind of learner, so it was great the way they broke it down, step by step.  Very through, very sequential.  By the time I was done with the videos (I practiced every day for two weeks) I was able to feel comfortable dancing with my girlfriend, because as all us guys know, it's all about how the guy ""leads.""  If the dancing duo has got a strong lead, they're set.  I just needed an entry point.  A place to start the journey of 1000 miles.  I'd recommend this for whomever has the same trepidation I had (like, omg there's no way).  I'm a couple months in now and I'm able to go out dancing, learning new steps, confidence in place.  Highly recommend it.",1333411200,6,1081,4.1
4986942,5,B006GHFH72,"i don't even know where to start!!!  They explain everything so well and give you time to practice every move they teach.  They focus on more than just footwork... it's the overall moves so you can watch this, and go straight out to the dance floor and look like you really know your stuff.  Throw in the fact that they're young and hot and this DVD is really fun to watch.  Hubby and I already know some country dance but this DVD made us sooo much better. It has more than just beginner moves.  I now know how our hold should be on the moves and where to put my feet on the dips.  We especially loved the salsa dip!  It seems like the other swing DVD's out there are either focused on jitterbug or they're big hair 80's style, which makes this simply the best choice for up to date, COUNTRY swing!!  Can't wait to watch volume 2!",1325808000,2,831,4.182389937106918
4986943,5,B006GHFH72,These are the same dancers I see on youtube all the time!  We've been trying to figure out their moves for a couple of years and these DVDs made it easy!  I was able to see what we've been doing wrong and why some of the moves weren't working right before.  Best dancing DVD out!,1325635200,3,279,4.036363636363636
4986944,5,B006GHFH72,I loved the video!  Great way to learn in the comfort of your own home.  I had fun sharing this with my family and friends.  We could all use the instruction even though some thought they already knew it all!  Great Job!  Thanks!,1325289600,4,229,4.232558139534884
4986945,5,B006GHFH72,My girlfriend gave me this video along with Volume 2 for Christmas. Her and I have always been into swing dancing and this gift was perfect for us! I absolutely love this video! It helps me with the technical side to swing dancing. I am not a very skilled dancer and haven't been blessed with the ability to keep a great rhythm but this video helped me a lot! Great instructions and easy to learn and follow! 5 Stars!,1325116800,4,417,4.291139240506329
4986946,5,B006GHFH72,"I got this DVD because my girlfriend wanted to me to go out country dancing with her. Needless to say, I was more than a little nervous. I'd always been a little rusty with my foot work. Thanks to this DVD, however, my confidence level has gone through the roof. I can now say that I'm the one dragging her out to go dancing ;-) I can't get enough of the moves I've learned and am anxious to learn more! Great instructors and professional video quality make this DVD an excellent teaching source!",1323907200,,496,4.344086021505376
4986947,5,B006GHFH72,"My girlfriend always wanted me to be more into dancing. She's really into the country dance scene and I always felt like I was letting her down when I didn't come out. We went through the DVD together and it was great! I didn't have any trouble following David and Meghan, and man, those two can dance! The extra footage was great. My girlfriend and I have a great time going dancing now. It made us closer and not to mention I think I'm in wayy better shape now.

If you want to start dancing and your a beginner (like I was) I would absolutely recommend this video. 100%",1323302400,5,572,4.247706422018348
4986948,5,B006GHFH72,"I think the best part about the DVD was not having to leave my house.  I always wanted to learn more styles of dance, but its hard to find time to get out there.  Not to mention the embarrassment of being a beginner :-).  But this was super easy and got me up to speed to I can go out and enjoy a night with my country friends.",1323216000,,327,3.7794117647058822

4986960,5,B006GHFH72,This is a great dance video with good looking personable instructors.  We learned to do the Country Swing basics in one hour and went to a club and did just fine.  Since then we have moved on to the more advanced moves and the instructors make it easy and fun.  Buy it!  You won't be sorry.,1419465600,,290,4.125
4986961,5,B006GHFH72,"My 12 year-old was worried about his first middle school dance.  He didn't have a 'girlfriend' like all of his friends so he was worried that he wouldn't have anyone to dance with.  So, mom sought out a video tape so that we could both learn.  Well, I sent him to this first dance with all the right moves.  He came home with a big smile AND a girlfriend.  I love it when mom can be right...if a boy can dance, the ladies will flock to him.

As for the video, it was well put together and was very informational.  I can't compare it to other videos out there, but I know it did exactly what we wanted it to do.",1416873600,,610,3.9917355371900825

4986965,5,B006GHFH72,Great learning tool.  We learned more from this  than from a 5 week series of beginner lessons.  My husband also loves to watch Megan as she is gorgeous.,1405382400,,153,4.392857142857143

4986967,5,B006GHFH72,"I first saw a couple dance ""country swing"" a few years ago in a local country bar.  Ever since then I've been wanting to learn ""swing"" and I have taken numerous lessons, but what I learned was the ballroom dance.  THIS is what I really wanted to learn.  Dance Country is a video about country swing for beginners.  Country swing incorporates swing-like moves but is a whole different thing than ballroom swing.  It's really fun!  My husband and I met line dancing, and this will be a wonderful complement to our much-loved hobby!  We can do this to virtually any song, so we'll never be bored or wondering what dance to do!

David and Meghan are very easy to understand, and they break down the details effortlessly.  I think this would be quite challenging to somebody with no dancing experience - but not impossible, with a little determination.  For my husband and I, I think we'll catch on quick.  The style of the dance is perfect for our differing preferences.  I like to move fast, and move a lot.  He likes to concentrate and break things down.  Country swing allows him the time and ease of movement to make decisions about what move is coming next and it keeps me spinning like a top!

I am excited beyond words (I love dancing) to master these moves and start with some of the flips and aerials on Dance Country Volume 2.",1394409600,2,1332,4.491666666666666

4986980,3,B006GHFH72,"Fortunately my boyfriend has a rusty knowledge of country swing, or else I think we would have been a bit lost with just this DVD. The presentation is done rather poorly. The girl and guy seem awkward and like they don't know what to say, they don't really explain things. There's only one camera angle so a lot of times you're not quite sure what they're doing. I'd look elsewhere.",1388793600,2,382,4.4714285714285715
4986981,5,B006GHFH72,Easy to follow and alot of fun.  My wife and I have enjoyed the video and have had way more fun at the bars now that we can dance with the best of them.  If you want to learn to country swing this is a must have.,1386201600,,212,3.4893617021276597
4986982,5,B006GHFH72,"I know how to dance a little country like two step and wanted to learn a little more like spins and other stuff. This DVD is very impressive and detailed on every thing. And the instructors show female instructions and male instructions. Then combine them to make the full dance moves, and dance to new and up to date country music. Best country dancing instructions ever. -Arizona",1381276800,3,381,4.701492537313433

4986984,5,B006GHFH72,I bought this dvd to help my fiance and I learn how to dance for our country wedding. We needed something fun and easy and this was just that. The instructors had great talent and chemistry. My fiance and I practiced there moves in our living room and had a lot of fun.,1368144000,,269,4.09433962264151

4986987,4,B006GHFH72,"This is a pretty good instructional video.  It goes through the basics, gives you several mid-level moves, and the a few advanced moves (vol 2).  Definitely enough to get you on the floor and show decent enough skill.  The instruction and hints are well done.",1359158400,,259,4.711111111111111
4986988,5,B006GHFH72,"This video was just the thing we were looking for. My friend and I were probably the worst dancers in our group, but not after this video! The couple was fun to watch and went through the motions very well. They went slow enough so that you could get the move down, but fast enough so you were on to the next steps and not left repeating yourself and getting bored. We even ended up teaching our other friends a thing or two by the end of the night.",1338681600,2,449,4.056179775280899

8497630,4,B006GHFH72,"I am an experienced dancer and wanted to learn country swing and try to mix it in with country two step. This dvd did an excellent job of showing and explaining what country swing is and how to do it. I can now see this dance cannot really be mixed in with the two step, although I can use some of the moves in the two step. I always thought country swing had the same count and footwork as east coast swing, but they are different. The two step and east coast swing have similar footwork and can be mixed, but not country swing. I now understand the leaders are not messing up the footwork and dancing too fast, but are doing country swing correctly.",1491004800,,651,4.216

8497632,5,B006GHFH72,This video was a ton of fun. We bought it to learn for our bluegrass wedding and it was perfect. We are totally ready! They did a great job breaking down the moves and building on the variations. Highly recommend!,1472256000,,213,4.35
8497633,5,B006GHFH72,"I love to dance, but I know little about country dancing.  I saw a video of 2 people dancing country swing and started looking for a video that would teach me as well as the man in my life who really is not a dancer.  In fact we went dancing before I purchased this dvd and when I went out of the room for a bit, the singer went up to him and told him he better ""up his game"" because he did not know how to dance at all.  Anyway, he was a little reticent when the dvd arrived, but he said he knew how important it was to me. So he played it as soon as it arrived. In literally 15 minutes he was dancing!!  The couple are clear in their instructions, they repeat each new step from several directions so you can see each step done from every angle , and they are a lot of fun to watch. We had company visiting recently, and my boyfriend jumped up, turned on music and asked me to dance with him so he could show off his dance moves! We haven't finished learning every new turn, but it's clear that I am  going to have to buy the 2nd tape.  Never never thought this man would enjoy learning to dance.  We are going out Friday at his insistence.
Oh GREAT dvd",1456272000,4,1155,3.9525862068965516
8497634,5,B006GHFH72,Up beat country music and both partners look like they really love dancing together! they break it down barney style for you to make it easy though at some times I felt like it could of been a little shorter on some of the lessons I felt well versed with all the lessons I learned. I learned quick everything that was taught even to the point that I went out that night and tried almost all the moves I learned that same night. which anyone that has taken lesson like this before knows that its one thing to practice them in your living room but its a whole another thing to get out there in front of people on the dance floor and actually try them it was a hit every thing went great.... so in short I would recommend this dvd to anyone looking to step there game up or just start out and learn,1450137600,,795,4.102564102564102
