The opening scene shows men in prison. One prisoner tries to escape; shots are fired. But he finds a car for a getaway. Two tramps talk about free food at the ""Friendly Mission"". One man has a hurt hand; will it be treated? Another man is offered a cigar (in a private room). Wagner recognizes ""Fingers"". ""I'm your friend."" Another man enters the building by a back door and delivers a small bottle. Can they pull a job tonight? Yes. ""Fingers"" opens the safe; has he outlived his usefulness? [Short-sighted?] Karl uses a television to watch his flunkies! [A first for movies?] Karl returns home to his wife. How can he afford those expensive gifts? A jeweler gets a surprise in the morning! The police see a pattern: the body of an accomplice was found at each job. One sergeant hopes for a promotion.

A Professor teaches a class in college on ""Abnormal Psychology"". One symptom is enjoying a life of crime. There are shots from another robbery! A policeman chases this robber. Will he get away? The policeman uses a call box. The robber goes to the ""Friendly Mission"". [Does he look like a crook because he wears no tie?] Policemen arrive at the Mission to search for a dangerous killer! Karl offers a deal to Frankie. ""Good work, Frankie!"" Wagner shows his dirt cellar to Frankie. ""Just a derelict."" Can he save Stratton? Richard wants Judy to give up her job at the Mission. She helps the underprivileged, ""social work"". Frederick has a bad dream at night. Sgt. Crocker reports, ""turn in your shield""! He will get a new one. Can people be distracted so a robber knocks over a jewelry store? Yes, at a cost. ""I've been robbed"" yells the store owner. The police must produce results, or else! The Captain orders a search of the Bowery.

That student sees a man looking into a trash can. Is he down on his luck? Can he dress the part? Richard goes to the Mission as part of his research. Do his manners give him away? Is that Professor Brenner? He is doing research too. Richard goes into his office. Did he ever meet a homicidal maniac before? Does he enjoy taking a life? ""If they get in my way."" ""You can't be serious."" Mr. Dennison learns the hard way. His family reports him missing. The police will search the Mission. Judy visits the morgue and recognizes a face.

The police look for Professor Brenner at home. ""Why, that's Karl Wagner from the Bowery."" The police become suspicious. Mrs. Brenner will be taken in for questioning. But she won't talk! Judy returns to the Mission, then is given a prescription. Is Judy too curious? She enters that dirt cellar! Will Frankie take care of Judy? A police car arrives with a load of policemen to search the Mission. Can Brenner escape? The doctor offers him a place to hide where no one will ever find him! That takes care of the professor. Richard tells Judy about their future. And so there is a happy ending for these two. But what about the others?

Aside from its low budget, it's a fairly good story. Could a Professor lead a double life? [Like Moriarity in the Sherlock Holmes stories.] The word ""Bowery"" comes from the Dutch word for a farmland. Dave O'Brien plays ""Pete Crawford"" the policeman, a change from his usual Western movies. Bela Lugosi plays a professor who has a hidden villainous side [a rle often found in the horror movies of that era]. [The double life of a professor recalls ""The Woman in the Window"", a better story.]",1206489600,,3429,4.569105691056911
