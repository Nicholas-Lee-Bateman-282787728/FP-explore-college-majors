7841204,3,6303222994,"Traditional western fans will appreciate this european-adapted tale of a father and band of brothers toting a coffin around the desert full of yankee cash, with the intended goal of restoring the financial fortunes of the civil war South, post-defeat.  Even though the plot is incredibly thin and contrived the film works well and traditional western fans will appreciate this story but of course spaghetti western fans will love this 1967 Sergio Corbucci creation even more! This film is a Spanish-Italian co-production and some of the ideas were evidently borrowed by Sergio Leone for 'The Good, Bad, and the Ugly' which was produced the same year.  While it is tempting to think of this cross-pollination of ideas as plagiarism, it is clear that tremendous creativity was pandemic in Cinecita and it's associations during a 60's explosion of ideas, when Fellini was contemplating 'Never Bet your Head with the Devil' and 'Satyricon'.  Any chance the media corporations and Big Bux producers can step aside and allow a period of creativity to return in the year 2003? Ziiinggg or as 'cheyenne' might say, 'rap 'em on a stone and they go -- ""diiiiiinggg""'  guess that says it all about today's movies!  Be sure to watch this one: 'Hellbenders' -- you won't regret it!",1059955200,,1268,4.990521327014218
