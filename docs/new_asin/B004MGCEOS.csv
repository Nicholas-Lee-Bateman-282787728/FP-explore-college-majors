8436033,5,B004MGCEOS,"I have been using Core Rhythms for about 5 years now.  I absolutely love it.  This  is not the only DVD for Core Rhythms that I own.  I have the original set that was advertised on TV several years ago and this DVD was a part of that set.  I workout regularly with The Firm, an aerobic workout with light weights, but have been having a hard time slimming my waist and hips as I entered menopause.  Core Rhythms has been the only workout that has been able to noticeably do that for me.  I supplement my regular workout with these DVD's about 2 to 3 times per week.  The workout is fun, never boring and also challenging!  The Buns and Thigh Combo is not only great for your buns and thighs, but also works the core as well.  The moves are very easy to follow, and for any moves that you need help with, you can pause the workout and click on more detailed instruction and then go back to workout at any time.  Core Rythms will always remain and staple in my workout regimen.",1528070400,,975,4.188172043010753

 and although the steps are not
Difficult you get a good and fun workout!

  I use this DVD along with beach body (turbo jam)so I don't' get
bored.  Oh by the way I own a few
core rhythm DVDs and this is the
best!(for workout and not boring)",1384560000,,434,3.6630434782608696

8436036,5,B004MGCEOS,"I saw the commercial for this on Youtube and thought it would be a great product to get, since I wanted to begin a dance fitness routine instead of all regular fitness. So anyways, this is a great way to lose weight, get in shape, and I began sweating within the first 5 minutes. There are different angles to show you how the specific dances are done, and those are VERY helpful.

I really enjoy these Core Rhythms workouts because they are so fun, plus the music is great.

I would highly recommend.",1369008000,,501,4.376344086021505
8436037,5,B004MGCEOS,"This Combo Pack comes with two DVDS, each with one full workout (about a full hour) and two bonus Latin Made Easy couple dance routines. Both workouts will definitely have you sweating by the end.
1. The Jumpin Jive DVD - Like the starter package's workout, you have a warm-up, two different dance style workouts, and then a cool-down. The styles used were: Samba, Swing, and Rumba. The samba routine places a lot of focus on your abs and your thighs. The swing routine is a lot of fun, but I always have difficulty performing the kicks. The rumba routine here mirrors the rumba cool-down done in the starter package's full workout. One of the questions I have is about the jive part of the DVD - I'm not a dance expert, but I've always thought that swing and jive were two different dance categories.
2. The Swinging Sensation DVD - The styles used here were: Merengue, Swing, and Paso Doble (as the cool-down!) All three routines were fun to perform. The merengue routine was particularly challenging and VERY fast-paced for me. The swing routine has moves previously seen in the Jumpin Jive DVD, but I found this routine a bit easier to do than the one in Jumpin Jive.
In both cases, the music is also very catchy.
The Latin Made Easy couple dance routines are also included. Jumpin Jive showcases a swing and a rumba routine, while Swinging Sensation showcases a paso doble routine and another one (at this moment, I cannot remember the genre). As I don't have a partner, I've steered clear of this bonus feature.
Results? Well, for now, it's too early to say, but after just one night of doing Jumpin Jive, I've already begun to notice a tighter core and a straighter spine. I HIGHLY recommend it for anyone who has an open mind or just wants to have fun.",1336521600,,1760,4.555205047318612
