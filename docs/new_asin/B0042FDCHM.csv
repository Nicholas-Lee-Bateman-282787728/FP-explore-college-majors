8413594,5,B0042FDCHM,I enjoyed Sex & Mrs. X.  I had seen part of it before but the dics was lost in my move.  I love Jacqueline Bisset's accent and like the way she handled herself with such class.  Linda Hamilton is one of my favorite actors too.  I have followed her movies for quite some time.  I was glad that I could purchase it from Amazon and was surprised that I got 2 movies for the price of 1.  I haven't seen the other one yet but will be back on review when I do.  Thank You,1430611200,,465,3.831578947368421
8413595,5,B0042FDCHM,This is a movie I saw years ago.  It left a lasting impression especially since I am a huge fan of Jacqueline Bisset.  The story was interesting since it was based on a true story written by a journalist.  A true romantic film.  I highly recommend you buy this one you will not be disappointed.,1427241600,,294,4.290909090909091

8413598,3,B0042FDCHM,Both movies weren't that good . I found that out after I purchased it. Big mistake. I wouldn't watch these movies over and over!,1370822400,,128,4.375
8413599,4,B0042FDCHM,"I bought this double-feature solely because of ""Sex & Mrs X"" (it was less expensive than buying it by it self). I enjoyed it very much. Both Jacqueline Bisset and Linda Hamilton are stunningly beautyful AND capable actresses as well and their chemistry was very convincing. The storyline is classic romantic comedy: Abandoned woman finds ways of getting back on the horse (so to speak). The twist is how this comes about. ""Sex And Mrs. X"" is one of the best romantic comedies I have seen in years.

As for the other feature ""Another Woman's Husband"" I have yet to see it.

8413600,5,B0042FDCHM,"Linda Hamilton was fabulous in this film. I am a big fan of hers and was interested in seeing her in Sex & Mrs. X and she definitely did not disappoint. The second film ""Another Woman's Husband"" was excellent as well. The plot was smooth and interesting to follow. Of course, Dale Midkiff (""The Magnificent Seven Series"") was easy on the eyes and is a terrific actor. This is my first ever review so I hope I get better at this. You will definitely enjoy both movies.",1318032000,5,467,4.379310344827586
