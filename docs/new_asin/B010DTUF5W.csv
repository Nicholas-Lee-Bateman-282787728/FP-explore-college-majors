7309109,5,B010DTUF5W,"Gospel Galaxy Buck Denver from the call center pilots a ship to fix a transponder, why? To bring Gods word to all of Sector 9 Quadrant 7. Here Buck gathers his buddies from the call center, for me, for God, for the people of Sector 9, people of Quadrant 7, did you follow that? Easy peasy lemon squeasy said the engineer with quite the accent like Scotty character in the original cast of Star Trek. Finding a transponder on an uninhabited planet. Seismic activity, sand storm, God want us to do big things and I want to do big things said Buck.
 This planet is not uninhabited, guess who found that out? Gossip galaxy with Pastor Paul, Buck wants nothing more than to get Gods message to all and hes really sick of the tote bag. You are a follower of Jesus? You are in a cave because of Jesus? Said the blue man in a robe , God wants you, nothing more.
 A Gloon (hope I spelled it right) a.k.a Jelly Fish cant go anywhere they need the current to push it through, only when we TRUST the current, Gods will, Gods love for us has our life suspended in his love. Aww . . . so touching and cute!
 I thought this movie will hold a childs attention because the Muppet characters or rather Veggie tale characters and their voices were quite soothing. Simple display of background graphics exploring a uninhabited planet, so they say; however did it capture the essence of what the movie focused on, I really think it did. Children will delight in the characters and its little humor oh lets not forget the strange looking things that lurked on the planet. A little mystery guest on the planet will get childrens wild imagination going, but the word will be heard.
 This had a Star Trek theme, well the spaceship gave that away, no I think the shirt. It was funny, cute and a message of Gods love and spreading the word of his love was truly felt. So with that I give it a thumbs up! Thank you, FlyByPromotions (Laura)",1444867200,,1911,4.359550561797753
7309110,4,B010DTUF5W,"I really enjoyed this movie at first I thought this movie was for children, but its not it's for all ages. This movies is a must read for all especially if you are a follower of Jesus Christ. This movies was about a guy names Buck Denver who works for a company called "" Gospel Galaxy"" and it was a company that spreads the word of Jesus from a pastor named "" Pastor Paul"". Buck found out that a galaxy called ""Tolarus"" which was located in sector 9 quadrant 7 was unable to hear god word from the ""Gospel Galaxy"". Buck found out that there transponder was out so Buck  felt like it was his job to do something big for God and go and fix the transponder, that was his main goal was to do something big for God.

Buck spoke to Pastor Paul about what he wanted to do and pastor Paul told him he needs to be supervised, and Buck got a crew to help him. On there way there once Buck and his crew gets to ""Tolarus"" Buck leaves his crew because he sees the transponder he sees aliens runs away from the aliens and gets lost. Buck  runs into a guy that lives in a cave that explains to Buck that its not about him doing something big for God its about him going what Gods plan for him not his plan. The man in the gave explains to him that God wants to love him and wants him to trust in him and to focus on him.

Buck realizes that it is not about doing something big its about trusting in god and walking with god and to focus on gods plan not his own plan. I really loved this movie and sure did my 5 year old this  movie really had me thinking on how I need to focus on Gods plan more and not just my plans. This movie is a message to all I love this movie and would love to see more movies like this, it was awesome.

7309111,2,B010DTUF5W,"I bought this with great expectation as my family LOVES the What's In The Bible series. I kept this as a family gift to be watched on Christmas Eve. That turned out to be a bad idea. Everything about this new movie fell short of my expectations.

Visuals are worse.
Things are sometimes fuzzy and the surroundings feel poorly put together and even the puppets feel computer generated at times. It's hard to explain but the majority of the movie the visuals felt very disappointing to me.

World
This movie incorporates characters from the What's In The Bible series (Buck Denver, Paster Paul, etc) but those characters are not moving on from their work together on What's In The Bible, they are connected in completely different ways.

Moral
The movie has a good moral, but while my littles do great at grasping the What's In The Bible series, the moral of this one was far more difficult to grasp, not because it is a difficult concept but because of the way it was put forward. Be a jellyfish not a shark is not a clear moral take away and is largely overshadowed by

Scary Story Elements
This story involves unpleasant looking aliens and a variety of dangerous or dangerous seeming situations. (spoiler alert)

These include
- Falling Into an unknown place and being approached by an unknown hard to see person after being made aware that potentially dangerous persons are around
- Approaching potentially harmful persons without realizing what's going on (but audience understands)
- multiple life and death type situations (hanging in a cage over lava, and a recreation of the final gollum scene in Lord of the Rings)

For an older child, less attune, or less sensitive child these elements would not necessarily pose a problem, but the use of music and cliff hanger elements eccentuated the scary and left my six year old with nightmares. She has watched things like Kung Fu Panda and How to Train Your Dragon without trouble.

Even without the Scary issue or before I realized the extent of the trouble it would cause, I was disappointed with this DVD. The moral is still good, and this is preferable to any number of other junky video options out there for kids, but I will not trumpet this series the way I have its predecessor.",1451001600,8,2237,4.705882352941177
7309112,1,B010DTUF5W,"My 6 year old was quite upset by the aliens and other dark creatures, theme, etc. in the movie and we couldn't even finish watching it.",1450915200,3,135,4.230769230769231
7309113,3,B010DTUF5W,"This 40 minute video reunites many of the major characters we got to know through Whats in the Bible?, but forget everything you thought you knew about them.  Much like how the characters of VeggieTales change their role based on the story, we now find Buck Denver and most of the gang working for Pastor Paul, who has an intergalactic broadcast sending the Gospel to the far reaches of the solar system.  Buck and the rest of the crew work in the phone banks, helping people get their tote bags and other goodies.  But Buck isn't satisfied.  He knows God wants him to do great things.

Buck thinks his opportunity has come when a report of a down transponder comes in from Sector 9.  So, under the supervision of Sunday School lady, Buck leads Clive, Owen, and Marcy out to this distant uninhabited planet to fix the transponder so that Pastor Pauls message can still go out.  Only when they get there, they encounter danger and aliens.  Will Buck succeed in his mission?  Or has he doomed his friends?

I honestly had a hard time getting past the new jobs everyone had.  It took me longer than expected to get into the story as a result, although it didn't help that the story was slow, period.  Yes, Im familiar enough with Star Wars and Star Trek to get the fact that we were getting some spoofs of them, but it just wasn't that funny to me.  Instead, I kept waiting for something to happen.

Since we are talking about spreading the Good News we learned about in the earlier videos, I was expecting a little more about that, too.  Honestly, I think the initial idea of Buck and his crew working a phone bank a pretty good indictment of many Christians today.  However, I didn't feel like the story went much beyond that.  But since this is the first of these videos, maybe I was expecting everything at once.

I will say I loved the moral.  Buck has to learn that God wants him just to be available, not to look for big things to do Himself.  Thats very Biblical.  Plus, when you are open to God and His leading, youll find yourself doing bigger things than you ever dreamed even if they aren't what you think are big things.

Yes, I am looking at this as an adult, but an adult who has enjoyed much of Phil Vischers previous work.  Ive always found good lessons mixed in with fun stories and great jokes.  This video had one out of three, at least as far as I was concerned.  Kids might enjoy it more.

Its a shame that Galaxy Buck: Mission to Sector 9 isn't more entertaining because it absolutely has a great message for all to learn.  Heres hoping that the next Galaxy Buck adventure has more entertainment with its lesson.",1447804800,,2632,4.406639004149378
7309114,4,B010DTUF5W,"One could argue that the success of the Whats in the Bible DVD series paved the way for The Muppets to return to pop culture prominence in the last five years. It would be a short argument, but one could try. However, despite a lack of formal relationship between the two, the timing doesnt hurt.

Phil Vischer, a creative kid-at-heart, continues to produce wholesome, thoughtful, and whimsical entertainment for the family to enjoy. He did it through VeggieTales, 3-2-1 Penguins, and the aforementioned Whats in the Bible series. Now, Vischer casts his latest lead, Buck Denver, as an average guy with an above average calling: Save the Galaxy. And this time its personal. (More on that in a bit).

First, the details. Buck answers phone calls for Pastor Paul and dreams of impacting the world in a big way. Bigger than making sure channel subscribers receive their free tote bag. Buck is easily relatable since every job has its share of doldrums and everyone wants to achieve greatness and leave our mark on the world. This leaves us in an internal struggle between chasing our dreams and chasing after God. The two goals are not always in conflict, but the key is remembering who deserves the honor and glory. Bucks journey in the story helps him confront this head on as he travels to the farthest reaches of the galaxy and the deepest corners of his heart and soul.

The gist of the lesson - because theres always a lesson - is that God wants to use you wherever you are in life. You may think you are playing an insignificant role or long for better days and bigger challenges, but doing big things (or anything) for God always begins with obedience in the little things. Buck learns this by way of a mysterious mentor studying the ways of the Gluun, the intergalactic equivalent of the jellyfish.

As I watched this, I couldn't help but recall Vischers own story as captured in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Me-Myself-and-Bob-A-True-Story-About-Dreams-God-and-Talking-Vegetables/dp/B006ZBR4V6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Me, Myself, and Bob: A True Story About Dreams, God, and Talking Vegetables</a>, a book I read years ago and a fascinating read for those familiar with veggies and their tales. With that book as a backdrop, its easy to see Vischer working out his faith through Bucks character, albeit in hindsight at this point, and sharing his personal journey in a new way, perhaps for those who don't read biographies.

Finding the right balance between dream chasing and God following can be confusing to readers and/or viewers - especially youngsters who may take the moral to mean they need to abandon all dreams - but Vischer handles this well enough to offer guidance to all ages. Plus, the humor, production value, and visual appeal all make this a highly enjoyable and definitely worthwhile viewing experience. Im not sure if well see more of Galaxy Buck, but you can always go back and enjoy his other adventures with the Whats in the Bible series.

7309115,4,B010DTUF5W,"My kids love VeggieTales, to be honest, I still love VeggieTales ever since my own childhood. More recently we have discovered, What's in the Bible as well. Now, What's in the Bible's own Buck Denver is Galaxy Buck. While I am still new to experience What's in the Bible, a few episodes in through RightNow Media I'm already enthusiastic about sharing it with my kids and the individual DVD of Galaxy Buck: Mission to Section 9 is a great thing! We were blessed by being given access to an early preview streaming of the DVD to be released on October 20th. My girls loved it! Even the Rascal stayed in the room and watched part of it.

The Princess said that the aliens scared her. While AppleBlossom said she couldn't believe that Buck saved the alien, but that she sees how our own Frontier Girls motto reflects the message in the movie with ""See a need, take the lead."" Then we discussed what Jesus would want and the importance of people who you least suspect like the apostle Paul.

Overall the film was short enough to even entice the butterfly attention-span Princess  but long enough to make the girls think they were getting a movie treat. I think this is the beginning of an excellent new series.

7309116,5,B010DTUF5W,"For quite a few months there has been a countdown going on to the release of the new series from Phil Vischer . . . Galaxy Buck.

Galaxy Buck: Mission To Sector 9
Produced by - Jellyfish Labs
Rating - Not Rated
Ages - doesn't really say, but I'd put it at about 4+

Favorite Features -
Return of favorite characters from the, ""What's in the Bible"" series, also from Phil Vischer.
Strong message about how God wants us, as we are and we can trust Him.
Fun space humor and setting . . . children and parents - and grandparents - will enjoy this new series.

Jellyfish Labs says; ""Buck Denver has a simple dream - to save the galaxy. Working for the Galactic Mission Board, Buck dreams of carrying God's love to every corner of the Milky Way! Except he doesn't have a starship. Or a crew. Or even a captain's license. He just needs a chance. But when that chance comes and Buck finds himself leading a real mission into deep space, things don't go at ALL like he imagined! Galaxy Buck: Mission To Sector 9 is a wild galactic adventure which teaches children a powerful lesson about trusting God with everything - even our dreams!""

Galaxy Buck will take the children you love on a new adventure into space to share God's love with others! Children will experience the excitement of not knowing what is going to happen next and the thrill of seeing how it all works out . . . likely in ways they did not anticipate! There is plenty of fun, suspense and excitement in Galaxy Buck: Mission To Sector 9, so even older children will enjoy this series. I am delighted to say, in this new series, Phil Vischer does not disappoint. Just as with VeggieTales, Galaxy Buck will entertain children while providing humor their parents - and grandparents - will enjoy as well! And, most important of all, children and adults will learn important truths by watching this fun, new series!

I'm so happy to see another series which combines excellent storytelling and solid Bible teaching - children and adults will be encouraged to learn from Galaxy Buck: Mission To Sector 9 about how God wants them . . . whether they do anything ""big"" or not! They will be encouraged to share God's love with others, to trust God and to have dreams and goals for their lives . . . then to expect God will do things far better than they could ever dream or imagine! Fun and a great way to learn and be encouraged; Galaxy Buck: Mission To Sector 9 is an, ""out of this world, hit""! This is a series the whole family will enjoy - I'm looking forward to the next adventure!",1445299200,,2768,4.379377431906615
7309117,4,B010DTUF5W,"Trusting God with everything is difficult.  All to often I find myself trusting in my own strength and ability to tackle a difficult task.  It isn't until things go awry (and they always do),  that I put my focus on God and ask him for help and guidance.

""Galaxy Buck: Mission to Sector 9"" tells the story of Buck Denver. Buck has big dreams of carrying Gods love to every corner of the Milky Way! In order for Buck to make his dream come true he needs a few things...things like a crew, a spaceship and his Captain's license. When the transponder in Sector 9 stops working, Bucks jumps at the opportunity to make his dream come true.  He finds himself leading a real mission trip into deep space, but things don't happen at all like he imagined.  If he is doing what God wants him to do, why is everything going wrong?

""Galaxy Buck: Mission to Sector 9""  is part of the ""Buck Denver asks...What's in the Bible' series.  It is created by Phil Vischer, who is also the creator of VeggieTales.  It teaches our children about God's love through the use of puppets and CGI.

My children had very mixed reviews on the movie.  My 4 year old son loved the show and has watched it twice so far. My almost 6 year old daughter ran from the room crying when a little red alien popped on the screen.  She hasn't come back to finish the show.  I was watching the show as well, and didn't find it particularly scary, but whatever it was spooked her and she won't come back.

The show has a great message to share with our children.  All too often we have big dreams and can't see the opportunities that are right in front of us.  Buck learns the lesson of Love - When God puts someone in your path who needs help, help him.  It's so simple.  We often dream of saving the entire world, but often forget to help that person right in front of us.

""Galaxy Buck: Mission to Sector 9"" also has a strong message of putting our trust in God to lead us through difficult times.  I love the way they explained this, through the use of Jellyfish and the current.  This was particularly relevant since we live on an island and often talk of the current.

""Galaxy Buck: Mission to Sector 9"" is a great Christian movie to share with the family on movie night. Galaxy Buck is available now on JellyTelly, an online streaming site featuring shows and movies to teach your kids about God, The Bible, and Faith.

I was given access to view a complimentary screening of ""Galaxy Buck Mission to Sector 9"".  All opinions are 100% my own.",1445212800,,2505,4.335483870967742
7309118,5,B010DTUF5W,"In a new adventure from ""What's In the Bible"" creator Phil Vischer, the familiar character Buck Denver embarks on a new adventure with many familiar faces. I got the chance to check it out before it was released, and I was impressed.

A space adventure that appeals to parents with it's fun references to Star Wars and Star Trek, it appeals equally to the kids with the fun characters, silliness and adventure they love.  A clear message can be learned by even the young watchers.

My five year old really enjoyed this video.  While not a space adventure fan, she found opportunity to laugh, question, learn and enjoy.  She walked away from watching, and a few hours later I found her making a poster like the one at the end of the video, so she could hang it in her room and remember that God wants her.  She picked up on so much more than I expected, and I was thrilled about that!

Not necessarily a Star Trek or Star Wars fan myself, I have been exposed to it through my husband many times and picked up on several funny references, so I found myself enjoying this video for the lessons it was teaching my kids as well as the entertainment factor.

Phil Vischer does a fantastic job of reaching kids with his characters, and keeps them engaged with the kid humor as well as the lessons they learn.  Another win in my book, and a video I will definitely be recommending to my friends.
