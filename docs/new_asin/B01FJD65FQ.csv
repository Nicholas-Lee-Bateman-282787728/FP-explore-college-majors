8760894,5,B01FJD65FQ,"The film is broken up into three parts: Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3.  Each day is a roughly half hour lecture from Patterson and a half hour of questions and answers from the audience.  The ideas are provoking: unity, duality, gender, conscious love, love of oneself, love of God.  There is a lot to take in.  I would suggest watching each part separately.  What stuck with me was the raw, candid, questions and statements from the audience.  There was something undeniably real that could be felt.  The Movement from Sex to Love is an experience.",1472601600,,543,4.536082474226804
8760895,5,B01FJD65FQ,"I found The Movement From Sex to Love to be incredibly moving and thought-provoking. This DVD shows William Patrick Patterson probing and exploring sex and love and so much more from within the context of G. I. Gurdjieff's Teaching.

It is astonishing how much ground is covered in the three hour long segments. In addition, there are diverse questions and perspectives from many other people that show a real dialog and striving to understand. It is really interesting to see how adept Mr. Patterson is at responding to these questions. I was really struck when he worked with the question from another by stating emphatically, I'm here to raise questions, not to give answers. Indeed, after watching the segments I felt extremely enlivened and full of questions.

The third and final segment is a powerful finale and caused such a welling of feeling. I do not want to speak about it and ruin it for the viewer, but will say it is not to be missed by anyone interested in the Teaching of Mr. Gurdjieff or in the sense and significance of human life.",1471737600,,1050,4.701086956521739
8760896,5,B01FJD65FQ,"Patterson's new film covers many vital topics, not least our longing to give and experience love despite our defensive relating to others. He raises questions, answers questions, and gives much to ponder. The seminar participants are notable for their questions too, as well as their attention, which conveys presence even to the viewer. The seriousness that Patterson evokes is at once deep and light, and we are reminded of our wish for self-development in order to transform subtle energies.",1471132800,,494,5.265822784810126
8760897,5,B01FJD65FQ,"This is another of Mr. Patterson's videos of talks (probes he calls them) three consecutive talks on a theme, followed by a question and answer period. There is a lot of Fourth Way material covered, all from the vantage point of the theme. But what really stood out is that though this is a video, the viewer is offered the opportunity for a real experience. It is certainly an experience of a contemporary teacher of the Work and of the teaching, but what I found valuableof myself.",1468368000,,483,4.563218390804598
8760898,5,B01FJD65FQ,"What is sex? What is Love? Given that sex is a function that dominates much of human life it would seem to be a topic that has already been well explored, but has it? And love, subject of countless volumes of poetry and psychology, but is it understood on a level beyond the feelings and emotions associated with its manifestations?  It would appear; beyond a superficial level, that neither sex nor love is well understood. The DVD by Gurdjieff legacy dives deeply into these subjects. The approaches used are extemporaneous talks and Q&A sessions between teacher and students. There is a going into the subjects on a very expansive level, an exploration, from a Fourth Way perspective, that goes beyond mechanical function and ordinary psychology into what is in actuality happening. And what can, but by no means does happen  a movement from sex to love. A movement from the lower to the higher on an energetic level. The subject is directly and indirectly explored in three parts by this unusual, well-crafted and very interesting DVD.",1466640000,3,1039,4.8977272727272725
