8638059,5,B00I0HY15U,An excellent film for all of those interested in show business.  It's a lot of fun particularly since my father's best friend wrote for vaudeville and radio comedies.,1470441600,,166,4.928571428571429
8638060,5,B00I0HY15U,"If you can somehow relate to the days of vaudeville, this is a delightful read!!  The title he used may not be completely accurate, but suggests his point of view.  And--for all I know--he may be at least close to being the ""last comic"".  Very enjoyable coverage of an era long gone!!!",1434153600,,285,4.4423076923076925

8638063,5,B00I0HY15U,"My S.O. and I (he's a ragtime pianist!) received our copy of LFC a couple days ago, and we've already watched it twice! This film is informative and entertaining and has a lot of valuable historical information: clips, music and visuals as well as oral history. It is well-paced and engaging, and at the same time it tells an important story of the development of a particular brand of comedy in a crucible which will never exist again, and its evolution into television and improv. The conclusion is moving, and the emotional connection of this man to his craft and a long-passed entertainment venue drives home the sense of loss over the passing of true burlesque. Thanks to the filmmakers for making such an important film.

Highly recommended for aficionados of comedy, entertainment history, vaudeville and related subjects.",1400198400,3,829,5.007246376811594
