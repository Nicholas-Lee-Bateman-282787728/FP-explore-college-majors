7870973,5,6304436882,"Really well done for a b-film. Plot twist is good,  cinematography is well done, solid fun film for anytime.",1524355200,,108,4.684210526315789
7870974,2,6304436882,"Suspenseful? Not really. Creepy?  No way.  A solid plot?  Eeeh. It came across as a made for television B movie. A low rated B movie. I watched it for free since I am a Prime Member at Amazon. That's a good thing, otherwise it would have been a waste of money.",1518739200,,260,4.0588235294117645
7870975,3,6304436882,"The Killing Jar

Not very ""thrilling"" despite so many twists. Worth a watch, but only when there's nothing better.",1506902400,,114,5.0
7870976,5,6304436882,"Not a bad Movie! Kind of rare...Never saw, or heard of it before. Arrived in excellent condition.",1504569600,,97,4.764705882352941
7870977,3,6304436882,Watchable and an OK way to spend 1 1/2 hr but the day after tomorrow you will have already forgotten it.,1493596800,,104,4.0
7870978,2,6304436882,"First of all... the cover is decieving. The human in a jar never happens, so points off for that.
Secondly, the plot is good but not carried out well. This movie reminded me of the old 'Movie of the Week' or 'Made for TV' movies by its quality.
It had a very strong story line, but the translation onto film just didn't work too well.
The plot was not seamless and the majority is delivered through flashback. That can work at times, but here too much time is spent in the buildup. It takes most of the film to lead to the 'juicy' parts and then it's over quickly.
The music doesn't go well either. It seems to lessen the effects of the moment.
The acting is middle of the road. The main character's mood swings are too severe with little tangible reasons for it and little credibility to the scenes.
I would like to see this movie reworked (I cannot believe I'm saying that with how poorly remakes are done). I would hope emphasis would be on delivering a more taut and tense film with less buildup and more action.",1189728000,,1016,4.324607329842932
7870979,3,6304436882,"The Killing Jar turned out to be a neat little ""B"" movie, complete with just the right amount of excitement, good acting, and suspense. It had me wondering all the way to the end. Lots of gore, if you are turned off by such things, but just right for me. The only flaw that I noticed is that at the end, they left some strings untied, such as did a couple of the guys who were very badly wounded actually die, or not. Otherwise, I enjoyed it, and I'm glad that I purchased it. My kind of flick!",990748800,,494,4.051020408163265
7870980,5,6304436882,"I saw this movie the other day on cable and thought it was done really well. The opening scenes with the flashbacks were great, and the music was errie. The performances were pretty good as well. It definitely kept my  attention until the very end. I thought I knew who the killer was, but as  in all good thrillers, I was wrong.  I'm glad I could purchase this movie  from AMAZON, a surprisingly good thriller that I'm glad I own!",952300800,5,431,4.35
