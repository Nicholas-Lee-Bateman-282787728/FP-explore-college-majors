7869811,3,6304286147,"If you want a great video tape by Ray Stevens,avoid this video tape and buy Ray Stevens - Comedy Video Classics. I thought when I bought it,it would just have music videos,yet it jumps around too much,it does begin with a music video for Gitarxpzan,yet goes from it to a storyline that is as wacky as it is confusing. According to the story,Ray is wanted by everyone for his songs and wants to do him in,yet it does have a few good moments. The music video on it for ""Ahab The Arab"" was not bad,yet of he did a interview during the who'd tape I might have gave the video tape 10 stars which I rarely admit about things,yet this just is not up to Ray's best.",1342137600,,657,4.181102362204724
7869812,5,6304286147,"This home video was released 15 years ago when Ray Stevens had just released his direct-to-video movie, GET SERIOUS. The movie itself was sold through direct mail originally, in the late summer/fall of 1995, and it sold several hundred thousand copies in the process and then it was released to retail stores late in 1996. The movie became a Top-5 best seller on Billboard's video chart.

This home video takes you backstage and gives a person a glimpse into how the movie was made. Ray narrates the documentary and runs through a list of people involved...several scenes are shot inside Ray's office. On a counter behind him in his office are a row of Music City News awards. Those awards were voted on by the fans of country music/readers of Music City News and Ray won 10 awards as Comedian of the Year from 1986 through 1994. Along the way there's footage of bloopers...those are abundant throughout...and we have comical snippets of Ray's co-stars and stage crew offering their comical opinion of Ray as it relates to the question: Is Ray Stevens guilty? This question is asked because the movie is all about Ray being on the run from the law...in addition to being accused of being politically incorrect by a fictional record executive whose launched an all-out public relations war on Ray for showing him up and refusing to ""get serious"".

The mystery behind the Three Legged Chickens are explored in this home video and we're shown how they were designed and put together. The dungeon wall and the actors playing in that scene are highlighted. The movie director, Rod Thompson, is featured at various times throughout the documentary as are Ray's brother, John Ragsdale, and Ray's co-writer friend, Buddy Kalb. Toward the end of the documentary Ray gives his views on political correctness as video snippets of ""Ahab the Arab"" are played and suggests that his GET SERIOUS movie is meant to poke fun at political correctness.

This is by no means a thorough description of this home video but I wanted to highlight just a few things from it for those who come across it's availability. It's a must-have for fans of Ray Stevens that's for sure!

The movie was shot throughout 1994 and according to Ray's narration editing began in January 1995 and the finished project wasn't released until the summer of 1995. Those familiar with the movie will get a kick out of this behind the scenes documentary.",1275868800,,2405,4.815980629539951
7869813,5,6304286147,"Ray Stevens has been an writing and singing great comidic songs for decades, as well as making many of them into comedy music videos.
The main purpose of the movie is to serve as a platform to tie several of these music videos togather. But they went way beyond
what was needed for that. The tie togethers are just as good or better than the comedy music videos.
In the film Ray faces his worst nightmares. His new boss (a guy who does a pretty good imitation of Paul Lynde) wants him to ""Get
Serious"". But Ray isn`t having any of it. So his new boss sends an army of political correctness protesters after him. Escaping
that nightmare leads to another. He finds that he is being chased down by the characters from his songs who are miffed at being
made laughing stocks.
Stevens plays many characters himself and he has his basic cast of supporting loons that you have seen in his music videos. Plus
a few you would not expect like George Lindsey, Jerry Clower, and Chet Atkins.
There are many music videos included in the film like The Do-right Family, Gitarzan, The Shriners Convention, Ahab the Arab, and
many more. In a way you could say that it`s a musical comedy, but in this case even the music is high comedy.
It`s outstanding comedy and you will not be disappointed.",1267833600,3,1275,4.476394849785407
7869814,5,6304286147,"This perpetually hilarious film by comic genius Stevens is, for the most part, impossible to describe.  It has a weird linear quality that is almost nonlinear; yet, the dream-like plot is thoroughly involving, and sometimes as suspenseful as a Hitchcock chase, from the first scene.  The humor is broad but brilliant--especially Stevens' merciless take-off on Sigmund Freud, and his one-person parody of a family gospel band (I nearly died!).  And the musical numbers alone would be worth the price of the video.
I wasn't expecting a comedy masterpiece, but that's what I got.  And I'm not complaining.  Why hasn't this guy made more movies??  Buy this!",1057968000,4,653,5.113207547169812
7869815,5,6304286147,"This 1995 video is based on Ray's 1986 song ""Dudley Dorite of the Highway Patrol"". in the song, Dudley pulls Ray over for speeding (Ray's going 57 and one half miles per hour!). It seems that the characters that Ray has sung about in his songs really exist and they are fighting mad that he has made them a laughing stock. The movie opens up with a camel roaring in a mock of MGM. we see young Ray playing piano seriously...until the woman leaves the room and he starts playing boogie woogie.

Time lapses and we see young Ray at the piano again. His teacher, adult Ray filmed from the stomach down and doing his German accent, demands that he 'get serious! no more of this monkey business!'.

At that junction, we see an ape beating his chest and the first music video appears: ""Gitarzan"". This home video features ten music videos interwoven with spoken dialogue...sort of like a new twist to a musical. Anyway, cameos by several country comedians make their way into this film. Jerry Clower was more of a supporting player, acting as Ray's manager. In the movie, Ray's record label is bought out by a Japanese conglomerate. Integrity Records has been re-named SoSumi (pronounced ""so sue me"") and the new label boss is a hilarious parody of Paul Lynde.

The boss wants Ray to get serious and become the Pavorotti of country music and he also wants Chet Atkins to drop the guitar and play the accordion! It's then that Ray is caught in the middle of protesters claiming that his songs are politically incorrect...a group of people sent there by Ray's vindictive new boss at SoSumi Records.

Pushed and shoved in the mob, Ray trips and falls backwards and wakes up in Chattanooga...a prelude into the next music number ""The Woogie Boogie"". Charlene MacKenzie, Ray's old flame, shows up hard of hearing and doing a great impersonation of Olive Oyl/Betty Boop. Dudley Dorite then attempts to arrest Ray because the cop's been hired by Harv Newland and Sister Bertha to bring Ray into custody for ruining their reputation, as well as the reputations of Ethel, Clyde, and Deputy Coy.

This is a prelude into the music video of ""Dudley Dorite"". Ray's thrown in cell block 3, a dungeon! Charlene busts Ray out of jail and they hide in the audience of a traveling gospel show, a prelude to the music number ""The Dooright Family"". Along the way Ray and Charlene hide out at her relatives farm...the home of the world's only Three Legged Chicken.

Soon after, the hilarious label executive and his underlings get into the action by joining in the pursuit of so-called armed and dangerous fugitive Ray Stevens. I can go on and on about this zany comedy musical but I'll close by saying: get this movie if you can. It's hilarious from start to finish. It's clean, wholesome, cornball fun. Available only on VHS as of now. A DVD has never been issued.",1043971200,9,2839,4.656686626746507
