3985071,5,B002TNXD50,"I recently saw this move at a screening at Columbia University organized by a student group. I really found this film thought provoking and well done. We also participated in a great Q&A session with one of the film makers which was a bonus, and the film generated a lot of meaningful conversation amongst the attendees and even in my classes. I think What Are We Doing Here? really asks the right questions. Where are my donations going?, What is working? What isn't working? Most importantly, this video gives Africans a voice which we don't often hear in the West. I look forward to more films from these film makers.",1258416000,,620,4.6454545454545455
8380334,1,B002TNXD50,"This is by far the worst documentary I have ever seen. It is not only lacking in any substance, it could be the worst film possible. From the start it is clear that the Klein brothers have little direction as to why they are going to Africa in the first place. They are not well read on anything on the continent. They have to ask around to find out information which is obviously going to be biased. Why they went to Africa is unclear other than that they say they are going to explore aid money being sent to the continent. They really have no reason to go there other than to film something that they think will be controversial, or as it seems, because they are spoiled white kids who want to piss away some money doing something they could claim is awesome.
The brothers (or possibly characters that the portray) are obnoxious at best. They have very little insight into anything. They broach a massive development topic at such a broad angle that the film is completely vacuous and unsubstantial. They will randomly film themselves having a conversation that is supposed to be profound about ""giving money to a person with an eye infection"" and such but come off as absolute imbeciles. They had no reason to make this documentary and prove very little with it. They have no specific path and clearly just packed together the film that they had on an extravagant trip of poverty tourism. Sadly, it is possible that someone was actually pathetic enough to let this affect whether or not they should send money towards African aid. This could mean that this monstrosity has actually harmed African development.
The film does feature a great deal of pretentious beards that were almost enjoyable, so there, one positive statement.
But continuing, I don't think I have ever seen something so shallow ever. These kids came to my school to promote this and, sadly, actually drew attention. Essentially, this film is disgusts me and was likewise received by the class of people who are all actually qualified to talk about anything. Luckily, I think this may be the beginning of a career doing something better (as this was detrimental) for the Klein brothers who need to redeem themselves.",1321228800,6,2188,4.730366492146596
8380335,5,B002TNXD50,"So what does happen to that $20 a month you send to help the child whose picture is affixed to your refrigerator? Unlike so many of us who ask that question, the makers of this film went to Africa to find an answer. Like many seekers of knowledge, they not only found the answer they sought, but in the process unearthed a multitude of additional questions. While one of these became the title, there are so many more. To watch their quest unfold is inspiring on its own, but their insight is contained in the new questions that are presented, albeit not necessarily answered. See this film as part of a group, and the post-viewing dissection of the film will focus less on the cinematic aspects, and much more on the stark realities of how the world should be helping Africa versus how it is appearing to help. You can't view it and not become engaged in the quest.",1263686400,,866,4.452830188679245
8380336,5,B002TNXD50,"To me, this is a film about doing something extraordinary. It's a story of four brothers who woke up one day, turned off the PlayStation, and endeavored, instead, to live like we all wish we could: without regret. They left behind their families and friends, and found enough courage in one another to face Africa. And why Africa? Watch the film, I don't think they understood it themselves until they came back home. Africa called them like Arabia called Lawrence. The photography is beautiful and intimate. The experience of watching ""What are we doing here?"" is deeply personal and utterly heartbreaking. To bring you any closer, the Kleins would have to put you on a train in the middle of the Sudan. So what are you waiting for? Turn off the PlayStation already.",1262822400,,767,4.774436090225564
8380337,5,B002TNXD50,"My impression was that the film was about asking questions, and not about having the answers.

Lots of documentaries try to ask a big question and offer a succinct answer, but to me, the point of this film was to point out that there is no simple answer, and that maybe that's where we should start. The film opened my eyes to the magnitude of government corruption and how it paired with well-intentioned international aid policies and NGO funds flowing into the continent.

So, i just wanted to say that i think asking the questions - big-scary-seemingly-impossible-to-answer-questions - like you did is a pretty commendable thing. Great film. Thanks.",1261008000,,653,4.981651376146789
8380338,5,B002TNXD50,"This film is so powerful because it deals with the core of African Problems. From a diplomatic point of view I think everyone interested in the future of that continent should see it. From top officials to government aides that often times have direct access to shaping things. Again I really enjoyed the fresh look into a continent that has been dominated by the will of other players for so long and how even when the best intentions are prescribed, the outcomes are far from ideal.",1259712000,,484,4.6395348837209305
8380339,5,B002TNXD50,"What Are We Doing Here?  I spent the first 45 years of my life never even pondering this question.  The closest I ever really came to it were the few times I purchased pre-packaged food bags for relief efforts from my local grocery chain and proudly delivered them to the narthex of my church.  Feeding the world's hungry certainly felt like one of those ""no-brainer"" types of noble causes (still does) and it always felt good to do ""my part.""  Since viewing the work of the Kleins, I now recognize that ""my part"" does not need to include an ignorant impression of ""doing good.""  Their film helped me to become a more informed citizen of the world and to understand the good and bad aspects of ""helping"" others.  Their message is poignant and much needed for all of us to make a true difference on an amazing continent filled with amazing people who want nothing more than the things I take for granted.  I highly recommend viewing this family-made movie with your family, and then immediately deciding what you can do to make a difference in Africa.",1259625600,,1050,4.5828877005347595
8380340,5,B002TNXD50,This film is successful because it deals with ideas and arguments about the role of the West in Africa and isn't just there to make you feel sorry for Africans (which so many other documentaries do). It really made me think and question some other assumptions I had about Africa. Great film for anyone interested in understanding the world better - also very entertaining.,1258502400,5,372,4.828125
8380341,5,B002TNXD50,"As someone who is often disappointed with hollywood movies that tend to spend more money on marketing than developing a decent film, this documentary is on the opposite end of the spectrum!  Made in an unconventional and highly controversial fashion,  Klein pictures have  done what few other Africa documentaries have, taken the issues to a wide variety of people on the ground in Africa and let them show the truth and argue the facts in a fresh and challenging manner.  African poverty is often a one dimensional and slightly ambiguous issue that is hard for westerns to understand and digest and leads to a huge amount of ignorance on our side and leave us unsure how to participate in one of the great problems our world faces today.  This film is a fantastic introduction to many of the issues and communicates them in a way that is accessible and stimulating. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in Africa, the issues and intense and adventure filed travel in a land few people see let alone understand!",1258502400,2,1024,4.762711864406779
8380342,5,B002TNXD50,"Wow!  I actually saw this film/DVD at a university screening I am the person who spoke up at the showing and tried to shame the professors whose criticisms were so personal and so irrelevant.

I would like to echo the audiences sentiments - that it was obvious you young men had no agenda when you went to Africa to try to find out why Africa's poverty was so entrenched, and why all of the good intentions and (now) trillions of dollars poured into the country over the past 50 years have not alleviated the situation in any meaningful way.  The ""message"" was that of the hundreds of people you interviewed, and if some people don't like it, well, don't shoot the messenger.  But more about that in a moment...

I am writing to offer two thoughts, from long experience in higher education, and in this area:

One: you are not alone.  Some of those who have worked in this area for decades - as well as some who have decided, like you, to examine, dispassionately, what's been done - have reached the same conclusion that so many in your film have - that ""top-down"" aid does not work as it is intended to.  Alvaro Vargas Llosa (South America), Paul Polak (Africa), and David Bornstein (social entrepreneur) are three writers you should read - and contact, if you can - as they will be able to shed light not only on WHY these earlier programs have not worked, but WHAT ELSE can be done that WILL work.  You will find that what they tell you reinforces what you were told by so many in Africa.

The class I teach (that  (hidden) has taken) is called "" (hidden) ,  (hidden) Development and  (hidden) Policy"" and the section we were discussing the week before your film was screened here was on entrepreneurial poverty initiatives.  The writers I mentioned above - and many, many others - all explain that the initiatives and programs that work best are the most ""entrepreneurial"" ones - meaning, the ones with ""boots on the ground,"" working directly with the intended recipients as participants, becoming aware of their actual needs, wants, constraints (medical, nutritional, topological, climatological, cultural, etc.)  If mistakes are made when these programs are small, grassroots efforts, they can be ""tweaked"" and adjusted while they are still small - witness your African farmer's efforts to create alternative irrigation methods that worked despite droughts - and then scaled UP successfully.  The problem with the big, multi-million (or billion) dollar programs - especially those managed from afar (as nearly all of them are) is that those running the programs have little familiarity with the region, culture, etc.  And so when problems arise (and problems ALWAYS arise), rather than being small problems that can be adjusted, they are widespread, systemic, catastrophic failures that you've just thrown millions at.  But rather than admitting, ""we didn't know what we were doing,"" the ""answer"" is always, ""we need more millions."" Or billions.  And if you oppose this, you become someone who is now somehow not interested in alleviating the plight of the those suffering horrifically.

This accusation is manifestly unfair, but you need to be prepared for it - and prepared to defend against it.  And this brings me to my next point.

I see from your website that you've already been to a number of places with this film.  If you have not already figured this out, you will encounter incredible hostility on college campuses.  I suspected this when I saw the title and description of your film, but I was sure of it once I watched the film.

It was poignant, gut-wrenching, and heart-rending.  But as I said in my comments after your film was screened here on the  (hidden) campus, it skewers a number of sacred cows.  Many, many academics believe that there is no good program unless it is a government program.  No matter how many times dictators take money from western nations and blow it on themselves, academics here will insist that they are just misunderstood, and what's needed is ""more money.""

The first professor who criticized your film last night made me furious, as he just flung a bunch of accusations at you in a diatribe against a film you never made!  He criticized you for not having addressed suffering in America in a film about suffering in AFRICA?  I'm sorry, but what does the fact that the bottom has fallen out of the investment market here have to do with a little girl afflicted with HIV/AIDS in Africa, trying to feed her four little brothers?  Are we supposed to equate the difficulties of someone like me whose lost a lot of money from my pension (for example) with THAT???  He should be ashamed of himself for even trying to assert that those were actual criticisms of the film.

Let me tell you what was really going on last night: the LAST thing many academics want to hear - and that fellow was apparently among them - is that entrepreneurship, individual enterprise, and market initiatives are solutions to poverty.  They will not listen to that message in this country, and they will not listen to it elsewhere.  They loathe capitalism, loathe free markets, loathe individual initiative - and so what your film presented was anathema to them.

And keep in mind, these were not even YOUR suggestions, nor YOUR criticisms, but those of the political leaders, heads of NGOs, villagers, and other community leaders you interviewed in Africa.  For those who purport to want to end poverty, but who refuse to listen to the poor, doesn't that tell you something?

I have been in higher education for nearly 20 years.  In that time, I have heard plenty about how ""capitalist imperialism"" has destroyed nations, reduced them to poverty, etc.  But now it is apparent that so-called ""capitalist imperialism"" has been replaced by a pseudo-intellectualist imperialism.  By which I mean that a worldwide army of ""scholars"" who publish for like-minded others in peer-reviewed journals think they know better than the intended recipients of their ""beneficence"" what those people need.  And God help anyone who tries to - or does - prove them wrong.

You tasted just a bit of their disdain last night.  I would suspect that it was not the first time.  It certainly will not be the last.  My advice (unsolicited, albeit): DO NOT APOLOGIZE FOR YOUR FILM, ITS VOICES, OR ITS MESSAGE.  The people who criticize you cannot abide anyone pointing out their failures.  They profess to ""speak truth to power."" But they have BECOME the power, and will not permit anyone to speak truth to them.

You will notice that they did not actually challenge any of the things your speakers said.  Because they cannot.  And they know it.  And it would be manifestly politically incorrect to mock the Africans themselves.  So they did the next best thing - they mocked the filmmakers.

Don't fall for it, gentlemen.  You did a fine thing.  Be proud of yourselves.  Be proud of your film.  Welcome the attacks - it means you are doing something right.  And I will look forward to hearing more from all of you.

With respect.",1258502400,5,7031,4.798668885191348
8380343,5,B002TNXD50,"The first things you notice watching the opening minutes of the film are the spectacular sights and sounds of a world that most of us have never experienced first-hand.  The picture is raw, yet so alive, and the words of the Africans are so rich and shocking at the same time in what they reveal.  You will learn more than you've probably ever learned from school or a textbook about poverty, aid, development, and Africa in this film...and you will form your own opinions about each of those issues.  The brothers who directed, photographed, and captured their experiences came to NYU for a discussion and you could tell how much their journey had changed their lives and how much they want to affect change.  They did the easy part for us, as we can just sit back and let the journey and thought-provoking issues come to us.....of course, YOU will want to get up and do SOMETHING once you have watched the film.",1258416000,10,913,4.58282208588957
