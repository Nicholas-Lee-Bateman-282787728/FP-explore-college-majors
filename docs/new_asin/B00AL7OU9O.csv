8553278,5,B00AL7OU9O,"Good-hearted good-time girl marries very wealthy, former war-hero Gilbert, who's been jilted by his fiance, on the rebound and a drunk, and doesn't realize what he's got 'til it's gone.  Two damaged people who are basically tough and honest with each other, as they alternately goad and care for each other--potential to go VERY badly, but the movie doesn't go there.  Gilbert is great expressing what his character wished he'd said, even when a scene is ""over""--they don't cut--he plays out his reaction.  Lois Moran is beautiful, and keeps up with Gilbert (you sense he's enjoying the give and take--almost Hepburn and Tracy).  New York sets and [Arizona?] scenery are also terrific.",1481068800,4,685,5.089285714285714
8553279,5,B00AL7OU9O,"I love, love, loooove John Gilbert! I can't get enough of him. What a voice! What a talent! This movie gives Gilbert a chance to show us just how good he was. His portrayal of a soldier (who later becomes an alcoholic) returning from the war only to find his girl engaged to another man is amazing. If you're a Gilbert fan - it's a must!",1393891200,10,337,4.121212121212121
