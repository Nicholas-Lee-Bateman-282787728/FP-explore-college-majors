8130029,5,B000GAKOC8,"Fantastic. I got this today and have learned Bringing home a Baby Bumble Bee (Ark Trav) most of Soldiers Joy and Thompson's rag.  I own a lot of instructional DVDs and this is so far my favorite. Eric is in the zone, funky, in the groove.
 Before buying this I learned Shady Grove and the other songs from his other dvds that are on youtube as teasers for the dvds and that's why I sought this out and bought it. Eric Thompson puts the Joy back in Soldier's Joy.  I will be buying the rest of his dvds soon if not immediately.",1435622400,,526,4.137254901960785

8130031,5,B000GAKOC8,"I have been learning guitar for almost a year, with a strong interest in traditional American music.  I was getting the hang of basic ""boom-chuck"" accompaniment with bass lines, and wanted to take the next step.  A friend recommended this DVD.  It's great because Thompson first plays the songs at full speed, and you can see and hear that you'll be learning real music; then he breaks the songs into parts and slowly works through them, with helpful demonstrations of techniques and suggestions for how to stop and practice the individual techniques and song sections as you go.  Then once you've practiced the parts he plays the song again at a manageable speed so you can play along.  I have found this a great way to learn both some very nice songs and some important techniques.  If you're brand new to playing, or are already somewhat advanced, this won't be right for you.  But if you're in between, (have been playing basic accompaniment) and are ready to move into a fuller style of playing, this is a great DVD.",1274140800,5,1021,4.670391061452514
