3801594,5,B001UJENRG,The images are stunning.  It is in 1080i but still looks fantastic.  Very informative.  Rudy Maxa is interesting to listen to and he gives good tips for travelling in the areas he documents.  I felt I had to review this blu-ray when I saw only one other review from someone who apparantly did not update their firmware and had problems watching the disk and rated this one star.  There are other titles in this series including France and Italy which are also filmed beautifully and are interesting. Also video is 16:9 and not 1:33.  Beautiful widescreen.,1247788800,22,555,4.729166666666667

3801599,5,B001UJENRG,I love all the side trips they suggest in addition to going to London.  I could visit all these places over and over!,1367280000,2,117,4.086956521739131

3801601,1,B001UJENRG,"Too much of the video is washed out. With film you would say it was overexposed, but this was surely shot with an HD camera. Can not understand why anyone would release material of such poor quality. Interesting, but they ruined it with very poor video.",1272326400,3,253,4.521739130434782
3801602,2,B001UJENRG,"When I saw that the run time was over an hour I thought that would make for a relatively comprehensive presentation. It's anything but. Vast regions of the United Kingdom are presented in twenty five minute segments, and of that entire region, a couple little eateries and a historical land mark will be picked at random, quickly glossed over and sandwiched between random images that receive no explanation. Overall, you won't see or learn much from the presentation, and there's not even enough substance for it to be useful as a travel guide. It's plays like a short preview for what could have been something much bigger and better. I guess I've been spoiled by Rick Steves' more thorough product, but sadly, Rick Steves' series is not offered in bluray. I had looked forward to buying this series, but I must stop at just this one. The video is sharp but the lack of content relative to the run time is too disappointing to get past.",1262304000,6,938,4.656626506024097

8343906,5,B001UJENRG,"Rudy Maxa isn't you normal travel host.  He is very upscale and assumes you know a bit more than average about your destination.  I used to live in the UK, was there for nearly a decade.  I learned things and found places through this video that I had no idea existed.  It is good, but not made for the first time or occasional traveler - you need to be adventurous to get much benefit.  We enjoyed it and did manage to visit a couple of places recommended in this video.",1496793600,2,471,4.188888888888889
8343907,3,B001UJENRG,"I bought this because my wife and I are heading to London for business this Fall.  The price was good and I thought I'd give it a try.  I hadn't seen Rudy's work before and I think it's OK, but he's no Rick Steves.

Some of the photography looks OK, but a lot of the video looks a little flat.  He really needs to hire a better colorist.",1495670400,,337,3.911764705882353

8343911,3,B001UJENRG,"I have watched this three different times to be sure my review was honest.  I wasn't thrilled about it the first time I started watching it ...I even just turned it off.  The second time me and my twin boys watched it but we started talking about something else while watching it ...
  This morning I was wanting to watch it and it really isn't anything but average to me.  No really great views or interesting facts .... and once again I couldn't watch it until the end.
  I was hoping for it to spark my interest in the region and maybe the boys would want to learn more about that area but not right now.
  I hope you all know that I do put thought and effort into my reviews because I don't want you to miss out on a great product not do I want you to waste your money on something that isn't really worth it.
Thanks ,cowboy Bramer",1472169600,2,835,4.104938271604938
