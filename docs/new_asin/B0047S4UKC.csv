8622220,5,B0047S4UKC,Great!,1455235200,,6,6.0
8622221,4,B0047S4UKC,I bought this as a gift for my sister's boyfriend and he seems to enjoy it.  I am more of a wrestling fan myself but he enjoys this stuff where they just knock each other out for fun.  Since I've never heard him complain about it I can't say that he loves it but I figure he must at least like it.,1454284800,,297,3.774193548387097
8622222,4,B0047S4UKC,"Your typical UFC KO video. Alot of guys getting dropped with punches, kicks, and knees. Not whole fights, just lead-up to the KO. It is entertaining at least.",1354838400,,158,4.678571428571429
8622223,3,B0047S4UKC,but knockouts happen everyday. nothing too special about any of the knockouts here either. unless you have a favourite fighter who knocked someone out or someone got knocked out that you don't like. don't waste your money,1351123200,,221,5.0
8622224,5,B0047S4UKC,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend.  It came just as described.  Brand new, still wrapped up in plastic.  It shipped within a day or two of ordering it.  Very satisfied.",1299024000,,175,4.212121212121212
8622225,4,B0047S4UKC,"The only special feature is a 7 minute clip of about 15 TKOs.  It's a nice addition to the 30 KO's in the main feature but I really expect more.  The ufc event dvd's always have special features such as press conferences, locker room footage, etc.",1295827200,4,247,4.3478260869565215
