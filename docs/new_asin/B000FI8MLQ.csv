8122816,4,B000FI8MLQ,"This is a low-budget independent film, using actors, crew and locations around the Washington DC area. (Except for one actress, from NYC I believe.) Overall, I thought the acting, direction, editing, cinematography, and original script were all interesting. It is technically horror, but really a meld of horror, mystery, and detective, with a 1940's feel due to some of the interesting costume choices. I would say this is one of the best independent low-budget films I have ever seen. Jason Wauer, the lead actor, and Eric Thornett, the director and writer, are especially notable. I'll be watching out for them in other films.",1320624000,,629,5.116504854368932
