8076419,3,B000A9QKUA,"Now ""Pet Alien"" is one twisted, freaked-out series.  It's about an average young boy named Tommy Cadle who lives in a lighthouse when suddenly his life has changed when a raucous band of aliens pay a visit.  The aliens consist of Dinko(a little green alien who is Tommy's best friend), Gumpers(a big, pink lunkheaded alien), Swanky(a tall, suave blue alien who is rather left alone), Flip(a bird-like alien who speaks his own language), and Scruffy(an alien dog with a tongue for miles).

The animation is basically 3-D, with a few 2-D effects(i.e. whacks and smoke clouds).  But still, it's a really weird series if weirdness is your thing.

The DVD has only four episodes with not very many features, which is better than no episodes at all.  They include ""The Thing on the Corner"", where Dinko is concerned about a mailbox, and ""Stage Fright"" where the aliens help Tommy audition for a play.

So if this series doesn't appease your taste in toons, try another.",1139702400,,963,4.8
8076420,5,B000A9QKUA,"I always enjoy the show because it's CGI. I can see how much effort has been put into the show (images, textures, backgrounds, etc), aside from the writing, jokes, characters designs, etc. It's a really visually stimulating show.",1134950400,2,229,5.052631578947368
8076421,5,B000A9QKUA,My two Grandson's with laughing out loud at something playing on their television. I stopped to take a look and soon joined in. Pet Alien is a throwback show to animation roots with its great timing and over the top humor. The animation looks just like some of the current hit movies but with a Bugs Bunny take. I have just ordered more titles for their Christamas stockings.,1134691200,3,375,4.529411764705882
8076422,5,B000A9QKUA,"Pet Alien is a fun show. Kids just love the fact that nice aliens are living with a child about their age and are making lots of catastrophes by mistake. I remember when I would pretend to fall and do weird noises to make my little cousins laugh. This show does the same. It puts the characters in funny situations with little explosions here and there and KABOOM, you have the children laugh.

I come across more and more kids who have seen the show and they always tell me how much they love Dinko and want to meet him and all the other aliens.",1134691200,,546,4.2

It's worth trying the DVD out.",1134691200,2,572,4.1909090909090905
