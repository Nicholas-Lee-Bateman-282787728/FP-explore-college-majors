8181435,4,6304304145,"Sleepless, the projection of nightmares upon several insomniac Vietnam vets, is less than spellbinding, but earns points for trying.  Consistant with the general mood and flow of the episode and writer Howard Gordon's  style, the episode is dark, dreary and haunting.  While it will never be a  personal favorite, Sleepless sets the trend for future dark, psychological  studies and introduces favorite characters Alex Krycek and informant  X.
Duane Barry is a spectacular episode, an outstanding mythology story,  and perhaps one of the best loved episodes of females everywhere (read:  Speedo alert).  First of three in the mythology arc, the story marks the  innovation in working around actress Gillian Anderson's pregnancy.  Duane  Barry is remarkable not only for it's visual effects, but with regard to  strong character development.  The Oxford educated psychologist in Mulder  is called upon in hostage negotiations with Duane Barry, and the skeptic in  Scully is evident in her thorough research of Duane's mental condition.  Duane Barry is a fine example of a well developed mythology episode and  what's right about The X-Files.",965001600,3,1140,5.417142857142857
