8223553,5,B000WJ2DHW,"Bless you for this, Donkey for a Day. I saw it once with the grand kids, and hungered for it ever since.  Eeyore is of a Taoist Zen nature.
Zen is enlightenment & intuition , Tao is freedom.  I suspected that Eeyore was --since he is so content in his swamp.  Happiness is to be content.
Lao Tzu said he would prefer to live in a mud-hole than in the Emperors castle, but Cloud Painting sealed it.  That took enlightenment and intuition.  Eeyore is a Taoist Zen Master. . I have a large Eeyore who sits in my chair at my desk at home, and several others here and there.  .",1423699200,,572,4.108108108108108
8223554,4,B000WJ2DHW,This is a good collection of some of the episodes from the New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.  One item (that a number of people have already commented on) is if you like the original beginning that is not present in this set of episodes.  The episodes are decent quality and seem to amuse our son (almost 3 yrs old).  I would recommend it for a parent with a child who likes Pooh.,1346457600,2,381,4.191780821917808
