233443,5,6300189503,"I found this movie exciting.  It had language I did not appreciate, including in a twice repeated segment dealing with the film's title, both early and very late in the movie (paraphrased):

BAD GUY:  ""Murphy's Law is whatever can go wrong will go wrong.""

JACK MURPHY (Charles Bronson):  ""No, Murphy's Law is don't mess with Jack Murphy.""  (I use ""mess""; the original word in the movie is one I would never use.)

Besides the foul language, there is nudity and gore which I did not think added anything to the story, but helped get the R rating I believe the filmmakers were aiming for.

Take all that away, and you have an excellent and suspenseful movie.  You have a cop falsely accused of murder handcuffed to a young female thief who tried to rob from him earlier.  The result is a relationship that makes one wonder if it is more of a september-may romance or a father-daughter relationship.

Additionally, there are plot twists that kept me guessing.  I was at the edge of my seat to the end of this picture.

Take the R-rating seriously.  This is not for teens.  But it is a well-done adventure I really enjoyed.",1167955200,2,1120,4.557788944723618

The plot is as cliche as it can be, but this is Bronson, baby!  Us devoted Bronson fans watch his films because he's in them and we all love the charm and presence he brings to the run of the mill 80s action formula.  Actually, we could all care less what it's about as long as Bronson's kicking some butt and shooting people from time to time.  This film is no exception and will please the diehard Bronson lover in us all.  Plus, this movie's got one of the coolest villians that Bronson's been up against.  This woman is crazy and dangerous as hell.  In one scene she drowns some poor schmuck in a bathtub, then decides to throw a lamp in the tub for some added zing!

233445,4,6300189503,"A solid and very entertaining mid 80s Charles Bronson actioner.
Rivalled only by ""The Evil That Men Do"" and ""10 to Midnight"" for the accolade of Bronson's best movie after his 70s heyday.
I've watched this film several times and always enjoy it.  Kathleen Wilhoite makes a sparkling and memorable debut and was seen recently in the first season of ""24"".
Bronson fans are very unlikey to be disappointed in what is - like many later Bronson pics - pretty standard good action fare elevated by the great man's personal charisma.  Therefore, this film is perhaps unlikley to ensnare any new converts.",1059696000,12,597,4.8431372549019605

The two join forces and, as they unravel the clues, the hunters become the hunted.

Snodgrass, a foul mouthed neurotic, began murdering everybody who is connected to Bronson, in order to frame him, and everybody who sent her to jail, including the judge (whom she drowned in a tub) and the prosecutor (plastic bag suffocation).
Bronson himself is handcuffed to an equally foul mouthed female, but the two join forces.

233565,3,6300189503,"Charles Bronson plays a boozer cop with a stripper ex-wife who is being framed for murders all over Los Angeles by a psycho woman that he put away years ago.  On the plus side, Carrie Snodgress is an excellent villain and this is easily one of Bronson's best 80's films at Cannon.  Unfortunately, it could have been a lot better.  Way too often Bronson collaborator J Lee Thompson directs with his usual lack of style and care, taking solid B-movie material and nearly ruining it with his bottom of the barrel filmmaking skills.  Then there's Kathleen Wilhoite as the comic relief sidekick who gets dragged along with Murphy when he escapes from lock-up.  She tries mighty hard to be funny but her seemingly endless stream of bizarre putdowns makes her an acquired taste at best.

The 1980's were kind of a sad decade if you happened to be a Charles Bronson fan.  He was stuck at Cannon churning out bottom-of-the-barrel grindhouse fare like the silly Death Wish sequels and utter crap like the nearly unwatchable Assassination and Messenger of Death.  Compared to those Murphy's Law and Kinjite stand out for at least being adequate B-movies, although the only genuinely good movie Bronson ever made at Cannon was 10 To Midnight.  Murphy's Law had a whole lot of potential but slapdash direction and one piece of highly questionable casting result in a movie that is only OK.",1481760000,,1376,4.796610169491525

233567,5,6300189503,"So glad I pre-ordered Twilight Times new Blu-Ray of 1986s MURPHYS LAW, even though I had seen this several times back in the early days of cable and even own an old VHS tape *which I can now toss*.  Its unlikely that MURPHYS LAW would be named if Charles Bronson fans were asked to pick their favorite film of his, since hes basically overshadowed here by the colorful supporting characters that populate the movie.

Instead of playing a superhuman action hero, Bronson is a divorced, hard-drinking rogue cop who ends up handcuffed to a spunky, foul-mouthed street-punk/petty thief (Kathleen Wilhoite) due to an implausible but nonetheless entertaining set of circumstances as the two try to locate a vengeful psycho whos framed Bronson for multiple murders.

Equal parts action flick, crime drama, mystery, and thriller with a big dose of humor coming from the snarky, crude, hilarious Wilhoite, the pacing of the film is excellent, with no lags in the action, and Carrie Snodgress sinks her teeth into a wicked, diabolical role.

What really makes this disc so great is the commentary. Now if you are looking for a lot of background info on Bronson or the rest of the cast, you may be disappointed. They are discussed, but not at length. However, fans of Kathleen will be delighted. She gives one of the liveliest and most spirited commentaries Ive ever heard, discusses her entire career and digs deep for some juicy stories. Ive loved her ever since PRIVATE SCHOOL where she basically stole the movie right out from under Phoebe Cates and Betsy Russell and if you were around in the 80s, youll know that is quite the feat! Kathleen even sings the closing theme for the film and right now Im off to do an internet search for some of the CDs shes recorded.",1475193600,,1758,4.754098360655738

This one stands out as one of my all time favorite Charles Bronson films.. Bronson is Jack Murphy..A Cop who is going thru a divorce, and not handling it well so, he spends most of his time inside of a bottle. Well apparently in his early days on the force he and his former partner arrested a female who was committed to a mental facility and has recently gotten out. And she has a score to settle with Murphy and anyone else who has wronged her in the past. So as she sets out to have murphy framed and arrested, by murdering his exwife and her current boyfriend, he gets arrested and handcuffed to a car thief he had arrested earlier, the thief Arabella Mcgee played by Kathleen Wilhoite is a foul mouthed, hilarious female companion who knows just how to push murphys buttons. Then the race is on after a jail break, the two desperately try to find out who framed murphy, and it all comes down to a final showdown inside what is called the Bradley Building.

233704,5,6300189503,"I've  seen  this  movie  many  times,  A  lot  of  the  other  actors  aside  from  Charles  Bronson  in  this  movie  I  don't  really  remember  who  they  are  in  real  life  &  who  they  star  as. I'll  have  to  watch  it  again.  Murphy  is  a  damm  good  cop,  &  stops  street  punks  &  thieves,  he's  good.  &  brings  down  his  sidekick  girl  in  the  beginning  of  the  movie  when  she  tries  stealing  his  car.  Murphy  soon  gets  set  up  by  a  woman  named  Jone Freeman  who  threatened  to  kill  him  when  she  called  him  on  the  telephone  in  the  middle  of  the  night.  She  sneaks  into  murphy's  car  while  in  he's  in  a  night  club  spying  on  his  exwife,  &  then  she  hits  him  over  the  head  knocks  murphy  out  &  follows  his  exwife  &  her  boyfriend  back  to  their  apartment  where  she  commits  the  murder  &  frames  Murphy.  2  cops  soon  arrest  Murphy  who's  surprized  to  see  them  &  eager  to  find  out  who  set  him  up.  &  to  my  surprize  he  was  handcuffed  to  the  little  punk  he  arrested.  She  needed  a  good  slap  in  the  face.  Murphy  plots  his  escape  on  a  mission  to  seek  the  one  who  framed  him,  he  hijacks  a  helicopter  &  they  make  their  gettaway.  Its  kind  of  odd  how  they  landed  on  that  barn.  But  no  pigs  or  chickens  or  horses,  This  is  a  dope plant  place  murphy  says.  The  men  there  were  Jerks.  &  have  the  advatage  over  Murphy  for  a  little  while.  When  they  started  messing  with  the  girl  Murphy  made  it  personal  even  though  he  didn't  like  her.  &  they  find  there  way  to  a  friend  of  Murphy's  place  named  Ben Wilko.  A  black  man  who's  on  crutches.  I  got  to  tell  you  I  think  Murphy's  relationship  with  that  sidekick  punk  was  a  complete  downfall.  It  didn't  seem  like  they'd  ever  start  getting  along.
Whoever  she  is  in  real  life  she  must  have  been  in  her  20's,  &  Murphy?  Probably  around  65  yrs  old.  Perhaps  a  little  younger.
Jone Freeman  must  have  followed  Murphy  there  to  the  black  mans  house,  because  shortly  after  Murphy  left  Jone  Freeman  shows  up  &  murders  poor  Ben.  Bens  looking  around  in  his  house  he  knows  something  isn't  right,  &  all  of  a  sudden  he's  shoved  to  the  ground.
Murphy  thinks  Frank Venjenzo  is  the  one  who  framed  him  who's  also  after  Murphy  to  avenge  the  death  of  his  brother  who  was  killed  at  the  airport  earlier  in  the  movie.  &  no  you  don't  mess  with  Murphy.  Nobody  should.  I  like  Murphy!  He  turned  out  to  be  one  tough  ombre!!  Frank Venjezo  gets  beat  up  by  Murphy  &  pleads  to  Murphy  I  didn't  do  it!  I  don't  know  what  your  talking  about.  The  girl  says  I  hate  to  say  it  but  I  think  he's  telling  the  truth.  Frank  looks  like  one  of  those  Italian  guys.  &  he  now  wants  Murphy  more  than  ever.  Jone  Freeman  captures  the  street  punk  to  use  her  as  bait  to  lure  Murphy  into  her  trap.  Frank  Venjenzo  tries  taking  him  too,  he  looses  his  entire  team,  after  shooting  at  Murphy  with  machine  guns,  Then  Frank Venjenzo  dies.  If  you  like  the  action  I  don't  think  it  gets  any  better  than  this.
Carrie  Snodgress  played  her  role  very  well  in  this  movie  as  Jone  Freeman.  The  framing  lunatic,  killed  her  judge  &  some  of  the  jury  members.  Murphy  barely  made  it  against  her  but  survived  &  wound  up  in  an  ambulance  him  &  the  street punk,  She'll  always  have  a  foul  mouth  Murphy  got  to  learn  to  live  with  her,  ha,ha,ha,ha,ha.  I  think  she  was  funny  with  some  of  the  names  she  called  Murphy.  A  lot  of  that  Murphy  managed  to  ignore.  Some  of  it  he  couldn't  when  she  pushed  him  to  the  breaking  point.  I'd  have  broke  out  of  jail  too  he  had  to  get  to  the  truth  &  that  was  the  only  way  for  him  to  do  so,  Try  &  track  down  the  one  who  framed  him.  That  was  heck  of  a  show  down  between  those  2. I kind of wonder what  happened afterwards.  Did Murphy ever get his job back? I think a lot of us wonder. I did like Arabella McGee. She wasn't easy to put up with! She was just young I guess. And your going to find out some people do have that kind of attitude. Believe me its true. I'm not going to lie to you! She did express herself in the most immature way with Murphy.",1413244800,,4521,4.128989361702128

233759,4,6300189503,"There's nothing terribly original or inspired about the joyously politically incorrect Murphy's Law, which sees Charles Bronson's alcoholic cop handcuffed to Kathleen Wilhoite's foul-mouthed petty criminal (who refers to him as `scrotum cheeks' among other more colourful epithets) and on the run after the murder of his stripper wife. He's innocent, of course, framed by Carrie Snodgress' weight-pumping psycho who's working her way through all the people who had her committed and a few who had her released as well (""You never should have let me out, you know. I really am crazy,"" she tells her probation officer before strangling her on an ill-advised home visit). You pretty much know exactly how this one's going to play out every step of the way, and yet it's still a surprisingly entertaining and even more surprisingly well-made audience picture. Bronson actually has something to act for once and responds with one of his best late performances, Wilhoite's punky foil playing off him engagingly enough for you to forgive her the truly terrible end title song while J. Lee Thompson's direction is pretty good here, elevating the picture from the uninspired production-line fodder of his last collaborations with the star. It all ends up with a silly three-way shootout in the ever-popular Bradbury Building (Blade Runner, Outer Limits, Wolf, Quantum Leap) between Bronson, a corrupt cop, some pissed-off mobsters and a crossbow-wielding harpy before a last-minute reprieve for one character you suspect originally didn't make it to the end credits until they previewed the film, but while it won't overtax your little grey cells or compliment your intelligence, it delivers the goods as an undemanding action film with surprising aplomb.

233761,5,6300189503,"""Murphy's Law"" has a special place in my heart because it is the first movie that introduced me to Charles Bronson many, many, many years ago. Charles plays Jack Murphy a burnt out cop who is framed for killing his ex-wife.  Jack (Bronson) is arrested for the murder, but vows to find the real killer.

 Jack (Bronson) ends up getting hand cuffed to a young girl named Arabella McGee (Kathleen Wilhoite). For the record Arabella has a bit of a potty mouth.  As a matter of she calls Jack (Bronson) ""snot licking doggie fart"". Isn't that awesome?  Now it should be noted that Jack arrested Arabella prior in the film for stealing his car.

Jack (Bronson) breaks out of jail, takes his new ""hand cuffed partner"" with him in order to find the killer.  There is also a really cool sequence in this film that takes place in the Bradbury Building.  This movie gives you Bronson at his best, fighting scum, great one liners and a drinking problem that never seems to be addressed.

This DVD provides ""Murphy's Law"" in both wide and full screen, with a crisp picture.  This DVD also features the original trailer/preview.  I don't know why there are so many negative thoughts on this movie.  For people to be upset that there was nudity, violence, profanity and sexual situations in this movie is bizarre to me.  This is a Charles Bronson movie that was made in the 1980s baby!!!  I don't know what people think they are going to be watching, ""Blue's Clues"" or maybe some watered down PG-13 flick.  ""Murphy's Law"" is a crime thriller that doesn't try to be anything else and that is why it is a classic.",1235952000,,1595,4.5473684210526315

7805512,5,6300189503,The audio was monaural but that didn't aggravate me. I did like that the picture was 16:9. I liked the action and violence. The story was the kind that I prefer over all kinds of TV and movies. I liked the shooting and people dying. This is the third of three that were recommended by Amazon Prime in an email. That was the best set of recommendations so far. Amazon is learning my preferences even the one that I prefer 16:9 more than 5.1 and the action and violence. Thanks again Amazon Prime. I'm with you for life. Let's live.,1517702400,,530,4.31

The duo ended up making nine pictures together over the years with this being their sixth collaboration. The only other director to work with Bronson this many times was Michael Winner with whom he made seven pictures. MURPHYS LAW was one of the last major theatrical films Bronson released and thank goodness its a not a bad movie.

Bronson stars as LAPD detective Jack Murphy, one of those tough cops who takes no guff and who gets the job done better than most. Unfortunately hes going through a rough spell, separated from his wife and drinking more than he should. Its even more uncomfortable for him knowing she works in a strip club now.

Things go from bad to worse when a psychopath Murphy helped put away is released from prison with revenge on her mind. Joan Freeman (Carrie Snodgrass) has it in her mind to take out everyone involved in the case that put her in prison ten years earlier. Her method of getting back at Murphy is to kill his wife and frame him for the murder.

Murphy is arrested and when taken to the station handcuffed to the foul mouthed girl who stole his car that he arrested earlier in the film, Arabella McGee (Kathleen Wilhoite). Knowing that the odds are against him he escapes taking McGee with him and set out to clear his name and find out who the real killer is. This sets in motion a back and forth patter between the two as they begin to respect one another the longer they're together.

As the body count rises while Freeman continues down her path of revenge against everyone involved, the clues eventually lead Murphy to realize whos behind it all. But no longer on the force he has to confront her on his own terms now as well as provide the evidence to clear his name.

The use of opposites chained to one another has been a plot device used before, most notably in THE DEFIANT ONES, and it works well here. Both do a great job of fleshing out their characters though Wilhoite seems to do more of that than Bronson whos playing the type of role hed become accustomed to at the time. Their back and forth adds a touch of humor as well as humanity to both characters.

The action is enough to keep fans of Bronson satisfied and has enough story to make it a workable film. No doubt this is not award winning material but it does show why Bronson was once the top money making film star alive at one point. It gives fans exactly what they want from one of his movies and provides enough escapism to keep everyone interested from start to finish.

Twilight Time is offering this film like they do all that they release with the best looking presentation there is or has been. Extras include an isolated score track, a commentary track featuring Wilhoite and film historian Nick Redman and the original theatrical trailer. As with all Twilight Time releases they are only making 3,000 copies so pick one up before they're gone if you're a Bronson fan.",1508716800,,2971,4.500927643784786
