4218433,3,B003XMKUEI,"I have been waiting a long time for the complete series. I am happy it is finally here.
All 17 discs are in paper envelopes!!!! Bad! Very bad!!!!
I will be buying a cd wallet to store my DVDs in-
The picture isn't all that great on some of the episodes-
I wish they had spent a little more $ to make this a better product-
But I got my Commish, so I will take what I can get-
Did I mention I HATE the paper envelopes?????",1287446400,29,421,3.8505747126436782
4218434,5,B003XMKUEI,"I'm so happy that this fabulous early 90's TV series has finally been released as a complete boxed set. It's a detective drama with a definite twist. It's set in a small town, but definitely avoids the cuteness that might have befallen a show with Michael Chiklis' type of character. The crimes are solved every week with cleverness rather than violence, and we've never been disappointed with any episode.

Love it!",1286755200,14,416,4.859154929577465
4218435,5,B003XMKUEI,"I am a complete ""Commish"" fan, and I can't wait to get the other seasons! I never watched one episode of ""The Shield"" because Michael Chiklis doesn't belong there... he belongs as The Commish!!",1285977600,,193,4.705882352941177
4218436,5,B003XMKUEI,I love this series! It was unique for its time and even today it still holds up. The commish is both quirky and dramatic and yet for a crime fighting series it manages to be warm and family oriented. I am so happy to see it finally being released in a complete series pack! I have waited a long time to own this series and now at long last its almost here!,1284595200,5,356,3.9583333333333335

4218477,5,B003XMKUEI,"A christmas present for my husband - Have watched the first disc thus far and am still enjoying after how many years????? Since it was on TV. Michael Chiklis is a very good and very under rated actor.
The light comedy of the series is a welcome relief to the usual cop shows.
Both my husband & I had forgotten how much we enjoyed the show having not seen it for 'million' years.",1420588800,2,378,4.191780821917808

4218485,2,B003XMKUEI,"So....when I saw this offered (I had never seen it or heard of it), I bought the series. Boy, what a major let down. Michael Chiklis was absolutely brilliant in The Shield. In the Commish, he was, for all practical purposes, a dufus. I'm glad this vehicle took him to The Shield, but The Commish was, in the words of only one other reviewer I saw, sophomoric. It looks like everyone else gave this series 5 stars. I sure don't get it. Different strokes, for sure.
I had no problem playing any of the discs (they all played well and clearly). None were damaged and I really didn't take issue with the packaging. It is, solely, the content of the writing that makes this series, in my opinion, a major loser. I watched the whole thing and nothing was redeeming in that effort. I thought it was pretty terrible. It appears many reviewers referred to this as family viewing. Does programming have to be so dumbed down to qualify as ""family viewing""? Yikes!",1413676800,,952,4.508670520231214

4218500,5,B003XMKUEI,"Watched the entire series in a couple weeks.

Grew up watching 'The Commish' as a kid and was thrilled to find the entire series on DVD.

I didn't find it annoying whatsoever that each disc is in a paper envelope. I actually prefer it this way. If you know how to pull the disc out and take care of it, you won't see scratches. Just flip the shiny side up and gently pull the DVD out while making sure the paper doesn't contact the disc..... simple.

Clarity was great for a 20 yr old show. Don't expect HD because it wasn't shot in HD. This is adequate resolution for the time.

I would definitely buy from Mule Creek (distributor of this series) again.",1410825600,2,654,4.2926829268292686

4218502,5,B003XMKUEI,"I bought this back around Christmas of 2010.  We were watching The Commish on Hulu at the time and they only had the first two seasons available.  We love this show.  It's such a wonderful show.  We're no prudes or anything, but shows like Criminal Minds and SVU can go even a tad too dark for our tastes, whereas shows like this are entertaining and light.  I'm glad we have this series for the future so we can share it with our family.  Major caveat, as others have stated, is the packaging is terrible.  All discs are in paper sleeves stuck in a weird thick snap case.  But I'd rather spend $25 on a series set this large than $20-40 more for ""slick casing"".  Well worth a pick up!",1409529600,2,685,4.248062015503876

4218506,5,B003XMKUEI,"It was fun seeing this series again. They played well and seemed complete. You get a lot of viewing time with these.

4218515,5,B003XMKUEI,Good as I remembered it. Enjoyed watching it again. Picture little grainy.  Love how commish figures things out and adds a twist to how he does things,1401321600,,150,4.555555555555555
4218516,4,B003XMKUEI,My husband loved this series and my sister wanted a copy for herself.  She has watched the entire series and just loved it,1400457600,,122,4.304347826086956
4218517,5,B003XMKUEI,I didn't watch this show when it first aired. I have enjoyed it tremendously. Michael Chiklis plays a PC honestly. I recommend this series!,1397433600,,139,4.833333333333333
4218518,5,B003XMKUEI,"I wanted to write a quick review because some of the other reviews were so negative about the packaging, and I was pleasantly surprised by what I received.  I expected a handful of DVD's in sleeves but loose. Actually, they came nicely packaged in a hard-sided box.  They should be quite adequate to last a long time.",1397088000,,317,4.543859649122807
4218519,5,B003XMKUEI,"We first saw Michael Chiklis in The Shield and we really liked that series, so decided we'd try another with Michael starring in it. The Shield was really more my style as it had a lot of action in it, but the Commish was light hearted and enjoyable to watch.",1395878400,,259,4.2
4218520,5,B003XMKUEI,"I remember watching this show when it was on in prime time and jumped at the chance to have it on dvd as I always loved the show.

Michael made it a great series and overall it was casted well and had excellent plotlines.",1395187200,,221,4.0227272727272725
4218521,5,B003XMKUEI,MY husband an I watched these movies when they first came out... Was very sad when they took them off the tv. So glad I was able to find them on amazon.,1395100800,,152,3.78125
4218522,4,B003XMKUEI,"I liked the fact that my DVD's came well wrapped. Only wished episodes would have been filmed in HD, but the series is awesome and looking forward to watching episodes I remember from the original air date.",1394668800,,206,4.594594594594595
4218523,3,B003XMKUEI,"This is a good series about a police chief who is beloved by his men and his family.  The episode where he deals delicately with a rape victim was priceless!  But it has all kinds of junk in it, too, such as a policeman being forced to partner with a sodomite.  It showed corrupt cops, and there are unfortunately all too many of them, and too many good ol' boy networks among police, but it never showed a corrupt DA or judge.  That would have been a great addition, and an admitting of another reality.  Too much cussing for me to be comfortable to view it with my children, but a concept that should be tried again, with less political correctness.",1388707200,,651,4.347107438016529
4218524,5,B003XMKUEI,"Was always my favorite tv show. I've always had a thing for balding chubby guys. This tv series is clean, has humor, and is overall great.",1385164800,,138,4.346153846153846
4218525,5,B003XMKUEI,"Absolutely dynamite TV series...great characters, interesting stories...and all at one very affordable price for the entire series.  I've been taking my time getting through the boxed set (I've finally reached Season 3 after a month or two) and have really enjoyed this.  Every bit as good as other older TV cops shows that I used to enjoy such as ""Hunter"" and ""Starsky & Hutch"".  Highly recommended.  Wish they had shows like this on TV these days.  Great stuff!",1382659200,,463,4.884615384615385
4218526,5,B003XMKUEI,Really like this dvd set and enjoyed watching the show when it was on television.  Would recommend this set to anyone that enjoyed this show while on television.,1376956800,,161,4.75
4218527,1,B003XMKUEI,"This is a lame, sophomoric excuse of a show.  I think middle school children could write a better script than this one.",1376265600,,119,4.409090909090909
4218528,2,B003XMKUEI,"I bought this for the wife. I did like this series, watched a few with the wife. The series is not in order.
For the good if you want a family cop show this is the one to get. I just recommend spending a little more money to get them in order.",1376179200,,243,3.6923076923076925
4218529,3,B003XMKUEI,"My sister & her husband loved this show and watched it every week when it originally aired.  I never did back then, but now my husband and I are hooked.  Sure it's a bit hokey but it's sweet (kinder, gentler days of broadcasting) and makes for a simple date night for us to sit back in the comfort of our empty nest and watch one or two episodes.  The presentation of the DVD set is nothing fancy, and sometimes an episode starts mid-episode instead of at the beginning, but so far we have been able to rewind to the beginning, and while it's annoying we have not yet found any video actually missing.  We are not all the way through the whole set yet.  For what I paid $24.99 (just noticed it is $4 cheaper today!) but either way, I am satisfied 4,421 minutes of entertainment, much of that time spent sitting hand in hand with my husband ... well worth it!",1375833600,2,858,4.271604938271605

4218532,3,B003XMKUEI,Granted shows like this don't always have 2 be in order. on the 2nd season they tried putting too many episodes on a disc but it evens out after the credits.,1373846400,,157,4.096774193548387

4218535,4,B003XMKUEI,"There was probably no way we were going to see the whole series released in the traditional season by season releases, with quality looking, single-sided discs.  This is a pretty good alternative.  They are double-sides discs, which aren't the best option in my opinion, but it does provide the entire series in one box collection.  The Quality of the video and sound are slightly compromised, but more than passable.

As for the series, it was a fabulous show.  Yet another show that the ""Network Suits"" cancelled far too early.  You just don't see this quality in shows nowadays.",1372809600,,581,4.877551020408164

4218537,1,B003XMKUEI,I watched the first few episodes and it was fine. After the first few episodes the discs stopped playing so I have no idea how good it was. I ended up having to return the whole set because so many episodes wouldn't play. I was so disappointed because I was looking forward to watching them. I hope to find this set elsewhere. The box they arrived in should have been a clue when it was broken and then the way the discs were packaged.,1368403200,5,435,4.190476190476191
4218538,4,B003XMKUEI,"Long before he was cracking skulls as Vic Mackey on The Shield, Michael Chiklis was Tony Scali, the Commissioner of the East Bridge Police Department. The show launched Chiklis's career and when you've seen both The Commish and The Shield, you really get the sense that this guy could play any role. Scali was the complete opposite of Mackey, whereas Mackey solved his problems through violence and intimidation, throwing the book out the window, Scali solved crime by using the book to his advantage. Scali would use his cleverness, his charm, and even his wit to get the answers he needed and was the true opposite of Vic Mackey in every sense of the word. The Commish was so much more than just a simple cop show, it was a family show, and during it's five year run on ABC it was way ahead of it's time. The show ran from 1991-1995 and even then was exploring such topics as bullying, gay marriage, the emergence of the internet, and in one first season episode, way back in 1991, Tony states that reality TV was the wave of the future! Scali wasn't just the clever cop who ran a large police department and solved crimes through extremely clever and unconventional methods, he was a family man. Much of the show intertwines his work with his family and he's just as clever, witty, and delightful at home as he is in the station. As I said earlier, this show launched the career of Michael Chiklis who now is a multiple Emmy Award winner and one of the best people you could have on board for a new series. Veteran actress, Theresa Saldana, plays his wife Rachel, and she's more than just a housewife. She's just as intuitive as her husband and is a working mom, another aspect of the show that was ahead of it's time. Their son David, was the first major role for Kaj-Erik Eriksen, who has seemingly been in everything. You may not recognize his name, but you'll definitely recognize his face from one thing or another. I have been watching the Commish regularly for about 3 months now and I can tell you honestly, this show never gets old. No two cases or personalities are the same, and you'd be hard pressed to find award winning novels that are better written. This is one of the most clever, fun, and heartwarming shows I have ever seen, and even though it's been off the air for nearly 20 years, it's still as relevant today as it was then and I can not possible recommend it enough.",1366502400,2,2393,4.478260869565218
4218539,5,B003XMKUEI,Really super to see this old series again- just as fantastic as the first viewing and equally as interesting and riveting as the Commish handles the various crimes and solves them with ease!!!,1366070400,,192,4.848484848484849

4218544,5,B003XMKUEI,"I say ""I love 'The Commish'"" because I love the show. Sometimes the video would break up, but for the most part, it was good. Packaging was sad and cheap. However, ""The Commish"" is one of the best shows ever because:

Michael Chiklis is a woman's dream (as the commish)
it is a clean (no blasphemy and filthy language, sex scenes, etc.) show
there is no unnecessary gore and violence
great storylines
great humor
I love how he uses his compassion, intuition, and wit to solve crimes
he is a wonderful husband and father
the rest of the cast are very likeable (although the ineptitude of the handyman galls me)

I guess I could go on, because it is one of my all-time favorite shows, but you get the point. If you buy ""The Commish"", you won't be disappointed!!!",1362960000,16,760,4.460431654676259

4218558,5,B003XMKUEI,"This is my impression based on watching the first 5 episodes:

Somebody said back before the edginess of cable TV came on the scene that the difference between TV viewing habits and theater film watching was that TV was what people would tend to invite into their home and theaters were for the rougher fare.

This is a TV show that is sweet, alludes to bad things happening in the world that would set your teeth on edge were it handled in a more modern way. Being that this is a cop show, and from the few episodes I've seen, it appears to be aimed at the large female audience owing to the types of crimes they've chosen and light touch of the writers.

It's a feel good show and there's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing particularly challenging about it though. Not a driving mystery with clues dropped asking you to figure it out, when it's there it's dropped in because the story is ending. It's character driven. The characters are very likable, sometimes silly. It's easy for a viewer after a day of work to kick back and smile. It's great for what it is.

True, it would be awesome if each DVD was packaged a bit better. They are all in paper envelopes that you might associate with a computer installation disk.  These are held within a squared off portion of what is otherwise just a very wide DVD case. But unless you're going to be rough with disks or throw around the case without care the disks are going to be just fine. You'll watch the series and then it'll sit safely on your shelf.

The series itself is a lot of fun and rehashed memories of watching the show when I was younger.

In this light hearted police drama Michael Chiklis (The Shield, Fantastic 4) stars as Tony Scali, the police commissioner of a small town. Battling a new foe each episode Commissioner Scali fights to keep his city clean and family safe. Generally playing some sort of trick to catch the bad guys in his net.

But what bother's me more is that some episodes have been edited they run from 44 to 48 minutes (I believe they should all have been at least around 48 minutes) so we know that not all are full episodes. I also believe some of the episodes are not in sequence (the pilot is episode #5 while a three part episode with Telly Savalas the first part is listed as episode #11 while the second part of that episode is listed as #16 on that same disc, they got it right with part three at episode #17).

4218569,4,B003XMKUEI,"I grew up with the Commish, so it's a real treat to have the entire series on disc!! Those that are complaining about the packaging I think are being a little too critical- for $20.00, you cannot ask for more! I have a feeling that if Mill Creek had invested more money into fancy packaging, the customer would have seen a much higher price. I think it's slick how they have all the discs in individual covers, plus, it's very neatly done, and it is a space saver!

My only concern, as I have only watched the first two discs, is this: does anyone else remember when the show was actually airing on TV, in the episode entitled The Best of Families, at the very end, the cops stop a car matching the description of the store robbers? When they try and tell him that they are a singing group, he asked them to prove it by singing right there on the street. In this box set, that scene is completely cut out-- we see them stop the car filled with the guys, we see the one guy tell the Commish that they are a singing group, and next thing you know, the credits are rolling! They cut out the entire part of the singing. Does this happen on everyone's disc, or did I get a dud?

Regardless of this issue, I am VERY pleased with this set, and it's nice to have another show from my childhood on disc!!",1337385600,,1295,4.176
4218570,3,B003XMKUEI,"This commish is a good all around family show with many stereotypical keystone cops type of humor. I enjoyed a flashback to my childhood of watching this every week. However, I felt that after they killed off one of the main officers that it got overly cheesey. Of course back in the early 90's I thought it was a really cool show, and despite the cheese of the storylines, is still good to watch today. I don't want to give away any more spoilers so I will leave it at that.

The packaging is very cheap like other reviewers have mentioned. It comes in a large hard back case, and the individual DVD's are in individual black cd sleeves.

It should also be noted that Season 5 is not really a season, but a series of about 4 or 5 made for TV movies and there is only one disc (for season 5).

I picked up the original season one and season two releases from about nine or ten years ago and waited with bated breath for the rest of the series.  Fans were sure for awhile that it would never happen. Then finally the complete series! All in all I give this four stars.  The packaging is bare bones for sure, but I'm pretty satisfied with the viewing quality.  My only gripe is they couldn't manage to secure the licensing for all music/material used in the series.  There are a couple of pretty noticeable edits to eliminate songs that apparently couldn't get publishing clearance, once in season one and once late in the series.  Other than that I'm not aware of anything else that would have had to be edited (I haven't watched the original run in a long time obviously), so that being said, if you can live with that, you won't be disappointed in this set if you're a true fan of this show.

Frankly, I feel like I'm a kid again with my dad hollering at me to turn up the TV because he can't hear it and the picture being all grainy on our ancient television set (we had the kind with the knob that clicked when you turned the station).

4218577,3,B003XMKUEI,"This review is based on this set, not the show itself.  Seasons 1 and 2 were previously released several years earlier by Anchor Bay.  I never thought the rest of the show would see the light of day on DVD so it's great to be able to have the whole show at a very reasonable price.  I mean, owning 91, 45-minute episodes for less than 30 bucks is a pretty good deal no matter how you look at it.  So for just that reason alone, part of me wants to rate high.

Other people have commented on the lack of extras and the bare packaging - which personally doesn't really bother me all that much for a budget set - I've seen worse.  The paper sleeves the way it is packaged at least I don't think are likely to actually hurt the DVD's themselves - which can't be said for some other t.v. show releases out there.

With that said, there is one drawback for me to this set: Mill Creek (the distributor behind this new release) seems to have reduced the video quality in order to increase the amount of episodes they could put on each disc.  The old Anchor Bay seasons 1 & 2 releases definitely won no quality awards - the video quality was pretty bad on them too. However, rather than keeping the already bad transfers previously done, Mill Creek seems to have went and made them even worse (which is even hard to imagine!) by compressing them even further.  I have no scientific data to back up this assertion - only my eyes.  I own the old DVD's and I own this new set.  I used the same episode, on the same disc, on the same DVD player, on the same T.V. and although quality was poor on both, I definitely noticed a decrease in quality on this new Mill Creek release, where more of the ""blocky"" compression artifacts were visible.  It struck me as even more like a poor VHS quality.

Granted, I have a 46"" HDTV so it's going to be much more noticeable than someone that owns say a 25"" old-style t.v.  I'd sure hate to see these on a 65"" screen - I'm thinking it might be hard to watch some of the episodes on such a setup! Anyway, on my t.v. they are watchable if you sit far enough away from the screen, but I've actually kept my old season 1 & 2 sets (I was going to sell them or give them away) because if I want to watch a season 1 or 2 show, I'll just use those old discs.

After having now watched most of the season 3 and season 4 episodes, I can say that the quality of them seems to be much better (relatively speaking - it's still a far cry from ""good""), so there is an inconsistency in quality throughout the set.

My advice: If you already own the old seasons 1 & 2 and are a fan of the show, you might not want to get rid of them if you purchase this.  If you don't own any seasons, you might try just this first and see if it's ""perfectly fine"" for you.",1327017600,5,2763,4.087037037037037

At the end of the episode Tony asks a bunch of suspects to ""sing"". I recall the original scene actually having them sing. Instead here it just jumps to him smiling and saying guys, escort these gentleman... etc... so their actual singing is ""cut"". Based on the number of discs and the number of episodes per disc, it's probably safe to say a lot of the episodes have bits and pieces cut out of them.

8408423,3,B003XMKUEI,I like this series. It was very good. It did its best to blend some humor and drama. It did ok. I would watch it in spurts. I think it tried to blend the two like 'hill street blues'. It did ok but that's it. It was nice to see Chiklis in a calm role.,1505347200,,251,3.581818181818182

8408426,4,B003XMKUEI,Love this show!!!!!  Artwork on the case is really nice and the video quality of the discs is really nice.  Only thing I don't like is that each disc comes in a paper sleeve.  The sleeves make it a bit clunky to work with and keep things in order.  This is a minor issue and can be overlooked easily in most cases.,1494892800,,314,4.016129032258065
