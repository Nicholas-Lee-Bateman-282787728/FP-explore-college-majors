8751202,5,B01BSW1O76,"A penetrating piece of investigative documentary-making. It reveals the time and temper of Philadelphia, ready for a rough and tumble cop and then mayor after too many gentlemen (except for Tate) in charge.  Interviews are incisive with informed, often witty participants.  I'd edit out the sad-sack singer at the end.",1479168000,,318,5.34
8751203,5,B01BSW1O76,"If you are over 40 years old and lived in the Delaware Velley/Philadelphia area at any time during your life, the name Frank Rizzo would strike a chord in your memory and an opinion. Like many bigger than life personalities, Rizzo grew up in the Italian neighborhood in South Philly (Home of the cheese steak and the Mummers Parade) and first rose in the police force to the rank of Commissioner and then became mayor (going so far as to trying to have the City Charter changed so he could run for a third term). Rizzo was the law and order guy who ignored civil rights and defended police brutality. He also spouted Rizzo-isms.

Rizzos three story image graces a wall in the Italian Market in South Philly and his name is still held high in is former hood. It arose again in the public eye last year when award winning Philly playwright Bruce Graham, crafted a play titled, simply. RIZZO which had a complete-sellout run at Phillys Theatre Exile. (I saw it and loved it.. It was so popular (patrons were turned away!) that it is being re-staged (with the same actor, Scott Green -one of Phillys finest thespians- in the title role) in October 2016 by the Philadelphia Theatre Company. This was perfect timing for home-video debut of Robert Mugges 1977 film Amateur Night at City Hall. Much of documentarian Mugges catalog of music-related films have been released on DVD this year, and though there is no music here, this one is a must see for anyone who remembers Philly in the 1960s or 1970s. Its a time capsule too. Those interviewed include former councilman and mayoral candidate (against Rizzo) Thatcher Longstreth, black candidate for mayor Charles Bowser and TV anchor Larry Kane. We hear a lot from news reporter Andrea Mitchell (who went on to national fame on NBC and later married Fed Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan). There are interviews with Rizzo too (full of those Rizzo-isms). Mugge even gets legendary stripper Blaze Starr to discuss her ""dalliances"" with ""The Big Bambino""!

The DVD will be released on July 26, 2016. I was provided with an advance screener for an objective review.

I, for one, am glad that Music Video Distributors chose to release this film on DVD. Sadly there are no bonus features. (Boy would I love it if Mugge added a directors commentary track discussing how the filming was done. ) Still, I can recommend it to anyone who says Frank when you say Rizzo

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
