416110,1,6302035058,"I thought Id finally found the video I was searching for at Amazon. I have seen the 1984 release with the Georgio Meroder rock soundtrack. I have been searching for a copy of this release for several years. I've been  dissappointed after purchasing several with ""silent film ""  scores. It is difficult to truely appreciate this fine film without the  brilliant soundtrack that brings it to life. Does anyone know where to get  your hands on the real Metropolis?",945129600,11,461,4.7974683544303796
416111,2,6302035058,"Metropolis the movie and Metropolis the video are two entirely different entities. The former represents a genesis in science fiction film-making and should be respected universally as being the fruit of a team of  visionary geniuses (principally in terms of art-direction). In 1926, this  two hour-plus release was a swooshing epic of light, machinery and action,  taking audiences who had been only used to watching films in the cinema  with tinny piano accompaniment into the far future world of robotics,  mass-transit, etc. The actors were good but they didn't have a chance of  flourishing in the shadow of the sheer excellence of set design and  production. This was the world of the year 2,000 (so far off back then that  the comma means something in the writing of the figure). Lang's direction  brought out a sci-fi exposition fused with parable fused with philosophy.  Grandiose by the standards of any time, the film cost over 2 million USD  (in 'then' money) and nearly bankrupted UFA, the backing company. That  alone proves that this was a work of intense sacrifice and conviction: a  mind-blowing excursion into the far-future (then a lifetime away) which,  despite its explicit critique of both Marxism and Capitalism, revealed the  likely development of a mammoth pleasure era to come. The spoilt offspring  of the Commercialist dictator sights the beauty of the People's girl and is  smitten to the point that he will try to change his side of the machine. At  the same time, the girl becomes known to the dictator who, in turn,  commissions Rotwang the inventor (analagous as being the amoral scientific  community) to construct a mechanical replica of the girl to undo the damage  and keep the rumblings low. The girl is abducted, duplicated and retained  for the pleasure of the scientist. Her robotic alter-ego malfunctions and  becomes a Lenin-Hitler, inciting the workers to rise up and destroy the  metropolis of their enslaver......and their own.  That is the meaning of  'Metropolis' the film.  Sadly, not many people have been able to afford  the same respect to 'Metropolis'. In terms of its versions on video, only 2  are worth seeing at this time. This tape and its brethren listed here are  not amongst them. What you should search for is either the 1984 Giorgio  Moroder film (85 mins including a hard rock soundtrack-score, tinting,  visual additions and a brilliant general score which I recorded onto a  90-min audio tape it was so good) or the 1992 release by the British Eureka  corporation (on PAL, sadly). The latter claims to have all 139 minutes and  although I haven't yet bought it (after buying 3 'Metropolis' VHS tapes,  I'm becoming a little weary of waste), I can see from the thickness of the  reel that there really could be all 139 minutes on there. All others are a  waste of money and should be avoided like the plague. This tape has an  unsuitable soundtrack which kills the aesthetics of the film and the print  itself lacks high resolution and is grained in areas. For the 1920's, an  orchestral or piano soundtrack had to do but 'Metropolis' should not be  classified as being a silent film per se. It is a generic 'Metropolis-film'  and demands better academic appreciation. It is sad to see that the minds  behind doing the re-releasing of 'Metropolis' just lack that respect.  Either that, or......or perhaps it's a conspiracy to assassinate the film's  image.",944265600,42,3421,4.933216168717047
416112,2,6302035058,"Thank god I saw this before I bought it. I was not impressed with this version at all. The quality was just not there, for picture & music.
 I'll stick to my 80's version of the classic, it was released though  ""Vestron Video"", and its been modified.
 But this version has  some cool groups from the 80's that performed on the soundtrack, such as  Bonnie Tylor, Queen, Jon Anderson, Lover Boy, ect, and I do belive it is a  classic to be experienced.
 Now, this is not the fully restored version,  but it is very clear and clean.",940550400,,529,4.326530612244898
416113,5,6302035058,"I believe this movie, considering the time it was made, groundbreaking in the sci-fi genre. Fritz Lang obviously went out on a limb making this movie considering the types of subject matter that was consistent with movies of  that time. That in itself overwhelms me along with the story line of  Metropolis itself. The Moroder version emphasized the urgency of the  subject matter more profoundly. I loved both versions.",931219200,,420,5.057971014492754
416114,5,6302035058,I have been trying to find a copy of the 80's re-edit of Metropolis for years.  Anyone know why it doesn't appear to be available on cassette?,927244800,,142,4.2592592592592595
416115,1,6302035058,"Where the hell is Moroder's version of the film.  Have the video companies lost their respect for great films?!  I saw the Moroder version, AND a version accompanied with a live performance by the powerful Alloy  Orchestra!  This is the best sci-fi film ever made!  I'll never forget it!  And these companies that sell these poor copies of ""Metropolis""  are trying to make us forget about it!  Why is ""Metropolis"" such  a neglected and forgotten film.  Just watch this copy, and you'll see what  I mean. And when you do, you'll be just as angry as I and many other  ""Metropolis"" fans have become with these companies!  And that's  not all!  The video companies expect us to be fooled with the labels  ""restored version"", while nothing is being restored.  They simply  slow the film speed down to try and keep us occupied.  I am furious with  the extreme disrespect and neglect these video companies have shown on such  a great film.  Avoid this and any other available version at all costs, and  fight to find the Moroder version!!!",925430400,15,1032,4.674157303370786
416116,2,6302035058,"This version has a lot of footage, but is still missing large pieces that make the continuity very choppy. The picture quality is fair, and my overall sense is that the producers of this video just rounded up the  footage from whatever they could find. There is not a great deal of concern  shown for the overall quality of the product. The most disappointing  element about this version is, that, it has one of the most annoying sound  tracks I have ever experienced with a silent film. I got the sense that the  producers of this version really don't understand the purpose that a  soundtrack serves in enhancing the emotional elements portrayed on the  screen. There is no one credited to the soundtrack of this version and I  can understand why, as it is nothing more than 136 minutes of annoying  noise that detracts from an otherwise remarkable film. I ended up turning  off the sound which helped somewhat. If you really want to experience this  film at its best, hold out for the Giorgio Moroder restored version.",923443200,,1021,4.679775280898877
416117,1,6302035058,"This version is produced by a company called Madacy Entertainment and is sad at best.  The picture is very washed out (The title shot ""Metropolis"" can't even be read) and it isn't even centered on  the screen.  It was also recorded in ""EP"" mode.  The reason for  one star is because it was the lowest score available.  I was extremely  disappointed.
This movie is a classic and deserves better treatment than  this production company has given it.
Also, if there is ever a version  released that is accompanied by music from the ""Alloy Orchestra""  I would highly recommend it.",919296000,9,576,4.7272727272727275
416118,2,6302035058,"This is the 139 minute, tinted version, with the disjointed music, distributed by ""JEF films"" and labeled ""Aikman Archive"" in yellow on the box.  The sound is bad and the video quality is poor.  For  superior video quality, get the version produced by Kino Video instead.  although the Kino version has a bad sound track, at least the video quality  is very good.  For superior sound, get the Moroder version of  Metropolis.
This review assumes that you have already seen Metropolis.  For those unfamiliar with Metropolis, it is considered ""the""  first SciFi movie -- the robot, the cool visual effects of future cities,  and a few mad scientist lab scenes.  But it is only a  great movie IF you  see the right version. Sadly, there are more then 6 versions of the film  floating around --
  Black/white, bad music, slow playback
  B/W,  bad music, fast playback
  tinted, bad music, slow playback
  tinted,  good music, fast playback
plus a few versions with terrible video quality  (the DVD version is such a case) and other versions with missing scenes,  a  non-logical flow to the story line due to bad editing,  etc.
Unfortunately, the situation with prints of Metropolis is a bit of a  mess.  Those looking for the tinted Girogio Moroder sound track should NOT  get this tape.
Although the run time of this version of the movie is  139 minutes, it is actually missing scenes that are in the 90 minute Kino  Video and Moroder versions of the tape.  The reason is that this 139 minute  tape is run at a SLOWER speed than the Kino tape is. Also, the music is  totally out of sync and unrelated to the action.
Unfortunately,  Moroder's copy is not available from anywhere.  At $24.95, I'd hoped that  the folks at Amazon.com had found a copy but  this is not the case.  Someone should find a good copy of the Moroder tape, sell that, and burn  all of the other versions.  Although some people object to Moroder's rock  soundtrack, at least it follows the story line and is an excellent sound  track on its own.
I was fortunate enough to have seen Moroder's copy the  first time I saw Metropolis and I am very glad that I did.
To add further  insult to injury, the CD of Moroder's soundtrack is not the same as the  music that appearred in the movie.  The CD has some additional songs and is  missing some others.  So you can't redub a video from the CD.  So don't get  the ""Moroder CD"" and expect to remix your own copy of the  video.
OK, having provided all of the background info, there is the  review:
139-minute B&W version published by JEF films. The cover says  it is a ""newly restored version"", but image quality is so bad  that I would rather call it ""newly destroyed version"". It has  actually more missing scenes than both Kino's and Moroder's versions, but  runs longer because of slower frame speed.",918950400,299,2813,4.565656565656566
416149,4,6302035058,"I saw this when it was released in theatres in 1984 and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I recall seeing it at one of Chicago's artier venues, and I remember a few film snobs walking out, apparently not appreciating Giorgio Moroder's various rock songs interspersed throughout the film, with the lyrics commenting on the action on screen.  In fact, most of the songs are quite enjoyable on their own (I still listen to the soundtrack album 24 years later, so go figure).  Fritz Lang's Metropolis actually begs for a futuristic soundtrack, and Moroder has given us that, although for my part they could've ditched Freddie Mercury's Love Kills and Pat Benatar's Here's My Heart, but the other songs are perfectly in sync with the mood of the film, particularly Jon Anderson singing Cage of Freedom and Loverboy on Destruction.  Moroder's own synthesized numbers, Machines and Legend of Babel are great in themselves.  Though this music is very '80s, it has aged well, and to be blunt, Metropolis, though it has a place in film history (the robot animation sequence being both stunning and disturbing) is difficult to sit through today (assuming we even had a clue what Lang's original was really like, uncut.  It needed some musical spice, and that's what Moroder gives us. Enjoy it, and ignore those nose-in-the-air film snobs.",1210291200,2,1317,4.963636363636364
416150,5,6302035058,"When Metropolis was brought to America in 1926, American ditributors cut an hour out of the film because they believed that their audiences would not like any film over 90 minutes.  One butcher went as far as to claim that his cut and re-edit was actually closer to Fritz Lang's original vision of the film.  Almost sixty years later, these shortened versions (all slightly different and missing key scenes) were all that remained.  Georgio Moroder restored the story of the film as best he could, added color and provided a modern soundtrack with the intention of giving it the distribution that it should have had in the 20's.  I had been a great fan of the film for many years and was a little worried about this ""modern"" version, especially about adding color (the early colorizations by Turner still sometimes make me wake up in a cold sweat).  Earlier attempts to re-issue films for a modern audience included a version of Gone With The Wind where they cut off the top and bottom of the image to give it a ""widescreen"" look.  It was a great thrill to see Metropolis returned to the big screen.  Moroder's version had a story that was more complete than any previous version, the color was only used sparingly and the ""electronica"" soundtrack worked quite well with the mechanistic themes of the film.  He even used still pictures to restore some scenes which was not done even with the recent restoration.  The only flaw was that he chose to keep it under 90 minutes.  Like the earlier distributors, this was intended to maintain a mass appeal and being that it was the plastic 80's, he was probably right.  I have read a lot of reviews that hated this version and these people obviously love their opinions about how to do a film restoration more then they love this film.  Moroder did a great job and this version will sit on my shelf right next to the modern restoration.",1174089600,2,1880,4.612612612612613
416151,4,6302035058,"This is an unusual and quite special VHS which I'm very glad I came across.  As a silent film enthusiast, I was intrigued by this 1984 version of legendary German director/filmmaker Fritz Lang's most famous silent cinematic masterpiece, ""Metropolis"", and am very glad I bought a copy.  While I can understand why some critics and film `purists' might disapprove of an eighties-sounding soundtrack to such a classic old silent film, I was able to see the positive aspects and thoroughly enjoyed ""Metropolis"" with a very different sound and also some colour tinting to the pictures.  Georgio Moroder not only composed this modern score but also edited the original film and added subtitles, condensing this once-epic film even further to just under 90 minutes in length.  At the same time, however, Moroder managed to retain the essence of the story, and with many original scenes given new and fitting music, it still packs a punch even today.  Even a modern audience unfamiliar with silent films might be impressed to see some of the dramatic, expressive, artistic and powerful images, many of which were innovative and stunning in the mid 1920s, and are still surprising and impressive today.  Also timeless in its effect is the story itself:  although made as a futuristic sci-fi about a high-tech modern city built and kept operating by hard-working labourers who are deemed as lower-class citizens, the ideas are still valid and thought-provoking even in our day.  The film, based on a novel by the same name, has elements of social, class and religious issues, as well as romance and relationships.  Finally, the piece-de-resistance is the quite beautiful and fascinating robot - built by a mad scientist - who leads the suppressed workers to a rebellion.  The many surreal and surprising images in this film are highlighted by Moroder's score:  sometimes a quiet modern synthesizer accompaniment, then Rock for the dramatic and exciting action scenes; the latter being performed by some of the biggest names of the 1980s such as Pat Benatar, Bonnie Tyler, Adam Ant and Freddie Mercury.  It might be hard to imagine this combination of classic silent masterpiece and 1980s pop/rock, but in my opinion it's quite a successful blend and definitely worth a look, whether one is familiar with the original silent film or not.",1153180800,3,2326,5.060209424083769
416152,5,6302035058,"I'm not a silent move buff.  However, the idea of a 1926 sci-fi film sounded interesting and I checked Metropolis out. This is a great classic movie!

I usually resort to vintage silent flicks just to look at the old cars and telephones, and typically bail out after 10 minutes.  Not so with this one.  I was quickly digging this and actually became engaged in the story.

It's a 95 minute tale set in a ""modern"" metropolis (electricity, biplanes, elevators . . . all that futuristic stuff).  Conflict develops between the ruling elite and the oppressed workers, who live in a subterranean city below the machinery that they operate.

Lots of action.  An industrial fatal accident (OSHA implications).  A revolution is brewing among the workers. The lead babe is cloned as a robot and incites rioting.  There is a biblical parable played out regarding the building of the Tower of Babel (worker exploitation).  There's even a little hoochie dance by the ""robot"" (pushing what would now be at least a PG-13 rating).  The sets and costumes are great (Flash Gordonesque but better). Love all that art deco.  There is an obvious messianic message involving the ""eternal class struggle"" and a needed deliverer.

The version I watched had just the old piano accompaniment score, which was pretty good.  I can see that this film would lend itself well to the Giorgio Moroder (Queen, Pat Benatar) soundtrack upgrade.  I'll consider purchasing that.

Great film.  Recommended for a wide range of watchers (sci-fi buffs, silent movie fans, Marxists, etc).  Enjoy!",1150588800,5,1553,4.972762645914397
416153,5,6302035058,"I first saw this film when it was re-release in the 80's with its enhancements and music sound track. I loved it! I wish I could find it on DVD. I purchased the new ""authorized version"" that has restored footage. It's good but to the average movie go'er a bit long and boring. I like the Giorgio Moroder version much better. The over all story is better and makes more sense to me. Also the music keeps it interesting & entertaining. It also helps in the telling of the story in a way the original never will. I think the best senario would be to use the newly restored footage and the effects and soundtrack from Giorgio Moroders version and put it out on DVD. I would buy it in a hart beat!",1116460800,6,692,4.2105263157894735
416154,1,6302035058,"It is sad how one of the great masterpieces of early cinema (or, at least, early sci-fi) has gone through so much editing, re-editing, castration, etc... This copy of the film (if you have ever seen the Giorgio Moroder and/or Kino releases and can make a comparison, you will realise this:) is a testiment to that. There are many, many, major holes in plot in this version. Very important scenes cut, subplots cut, characters cut. The print quality is so HORRIBLE, I don't know where to begin to elaborate. It doesn't help that the ""score"" is just a collection of old classical recordings slapped together that have almost nothing to do with action of the film, either. I bought this back before I had internet access and lived in the small, podunk town that I grew up in where this was the only copy availible for purchase. I bought it for a measly $2.99 and, as soon as I popped it in the VCR, realized I could have spent it on something more valuable... like a pack of cigarettes (caugh, caugh). The version you need to get is the new Kino release or the 1984 Giorgio Moroder version. Those are the best versions that I have seen. One last time: DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND GET THE KINO and/or THE GIORGIO MORODER VERSIONS!!!",1113264000,3,1225,4.497757847533633
416155,5,6302035058,"Metropolis is a landmark of all the films produced in history. Not only is the silent film entertaining, it provides an insight on prejudice and the division of different societies. Just think, this bias was still going on in the movie, set way after Martin Luther King passed away. Parts of the film may be disturbing, since it is very realistic, and could occur in the earth's later years.
  However, there are many different versions released on this film. I have also heard that the Madacy DVD is terrible. True, the movie is over 75 years old, but Madacy spends so little time in putting a convenient quality transfer to their products. The tinted version by Morodor is supposed to be superior to the Madacy AND Allied Artists Releases. I own two VHS versions, and will not risk hunting for a good quality DVD. One version is a clean, sensational print, and this is Kino Video. BUY THIS VERSION AT ALL COSTS! Title cards were even inserted into the missing scenes to tell what is happening. The other VHS version is-- well, it could use some shaping up. This version is by Timeless Video Classics, and is much shorter than the Kino release. The quality is mediocre, and the print is very dirty and washed out in many areas. There are also several master tape dropouts. The title of the film reads ""METROPOLI"". All the other copies released besides the Kino version probably contain this shabby print.
  To appreciate Metropolis and it's action in full glory, buy the Kino video or, better yet, the DVD. Since this is an excellent movie to be watched by critics and moviegoers alike, get the very BEST movie version on the market, and enjoy!",1088726400,2,1645,4.662068965517242

This edition appears to have some color to it and has sound effects with some modern music by Jon Anderson and Pat Benetar to name a few. The music really adds to the film and makes it very enjoyable to watch. I'm sure many silent film purist would disagree and that's cool. But if you want to watch an old silent film that has been enhanced with modern pop music it's worth a try. I do have to add though, the remastered edition is a must.",1060560000,13,684,4.229007633587786

But over the years,this film has been reedited,recut,and shortened which ruins the exact vision of an extrordinary filmmaker.

I DO NOT recommend the following versions:1.the Goodtimes Video release has poor image quality and even worse,NO MUSICAL SCORE! 2. The now-notorious Madacy DVD, which is about 5 times as worse as the Goodtimes video release,contains horrible,blurry image quality,freeze-frame opening titles,and an annoying musical score! Just recently,TCM (Turner Classic Movies) has broadcast the brand-new,beautifully restored 2002 restoration of ""Metropolis"" which I taped off of and trust me,it's well worth it! Buy the Kino restored version on either VHS or DVD,but DO NOT buy the horrible Public Domain versions which can definitely rip you off! A Terrific film and thanks to Kino for making this restored version a definite must-see! I also recommend the 1984 rerelease by Giorgio Moroder (which is now unfortunately out-of-print)and buy the soundtrack to go with it!",1054339200,6,1203,5.543478260869565
416158,5,6302035058,"This restoration of Metropolis is a great achievement.  I was astonished by the quality of the film; the picture is absolutely clear and undamaged for the entire length of the film.  I am sure that the restorers had to resort to pieces of film collected here and there but the finished product is seamless and looks like an original print.  This edition of Metropolis has the original orchestral score by Gottfried Huppertz. There have been several scores written for Metropolis over the year, and some viewers may feel the original lack drama.  This is perhaps true with the scene where the Robot is transformed into Maria. The music is eerie but quiet.  Some composers probably would have used a lot of brass to punctuate the change in the Robot, but the original score is more subdued.  On the other hand, the theme representing the Metropolis itself is quite memorable and dramatic.
The addition of a half-hour of film fills out the story beautifully and with the new inter cards relating the action of the missing footage, the action of the film can be followed easily.  The older, more incomplete version of Metropolis suffered from a lack of context. One example that I recall is when Freder volunteers to take over the operation of a machine from one of the workers.  I found this puzzling because the motivation of Freder was not clear, however, with the addition of the new footage it was easy to understand how idealistic Freder is and his quest of brotherhood with the workers was clear.  The complexity of Freder's character as the one who will bridge the differences between the workers and his father, Joh Fredersen, is reflected in the visions he sees, as when he sees Moloch in the damaged machine and the workers marching into it as if becoming a sacrifice.
In sum, this is the edition of Metropolis to have.  The story is presented in a clear and uncomplicated way with the best available print.  Unless someone finds more of the original footage this remains the authoritative version.",1050019200,8,2005,4.782608695652174

416171,5,6302035058,"During the time that this movie was created Science Fiction was not a re-occurring theme in the social consciousness and or new medias. I greatly admire the futuristic vision that was brought to the mainstream within the plot of this film (although the movie itself states that the time is undesignated). I believe that were this story retold today, it would still make for an interesting one and I would be curious to see how it could be further developed with modern special effects and diving further into the character relationships. Considering the limitations at the time however, the special effects in this movie were groundbreaking, the map scene and elaborate otherworldly buildings overlapping each other. This movie is a story of cold people controlling people who make a wonderful life for other people. The hand that controls the underground, deprived and enslaved workers who build and maintain the city above them are controlled unfairly by the main character's father. The son who finally sees the condition of the underground workers, takes one of the workers place and falls for the woman who spreads hope and peace to those below. When she is discovered by the father, he has a scientist kidnap her and make a robot in her likeness (my favorite image is the viewing of this robot). The robot then spreads discord among the workers so they will be driven out and the machines can take over as the father now wishes. This movie went beyond entertainment to conjure thoughts of what is real, and what is right and what relationships are worth in compared to moral obligations. And as other reviewers have stated, it is not the cleanest cinematography, but that is to be dismissed considering the age of the film, and because it is worth it. This movie is the perfect marriage of sci-fi and silent. A must have.",1033084800,,1827,4.840255591054313
416172,5,6302035058,"Austrian director Fritz Lang and his wife, Thea Von Harbou, made this first-ever science fiction film in Germany in 1926. While all extant copies are in poor to bad condition, the story and cinematography are so wonderful as to still hold the interest of a large audience.
There are many versions of this film on the market, with running times anywhere from 63 to 139 minutes, but this is by far my favorite. While it only has an 81 minute running time, it is actually one of the most complete versions available, because Georgio Moroder went back to the original script, and using still photos from the production, reinserted scenes that were cut from the film for it's American release. (The Nazis destroyed all original German prints of the film, as well as the negative.) The intertitles, which accounted for about 20 minutes of the film's running time, were replaced with subtitles, and his version uses the 24-frames-per-second projector speed that modern films are shown at, while the longer versions are shown at the historically correct 18-frames-per-second. He trimmed more time off by careful editing, to give the film a more contemporary pacing.
He also added a ""contemporary"" score, as well as subtle washes of color, which actually aids in understanding the film, while not detracting from Karl Fruend and Guenther Rittau's marvelous b&w cinematography. In fact, in some of the scenes where the film has been severely damaged, it helps accentuate the contrast.
There are many classic images in this film, including shots of the city (where monorails and bi-planes coexist), but the best known is probably Brigitte Helm as ""Hel"" the robot. In fact, people who have never seen, or even heard of the film have seen clips of Rotwang (Hel's creator) and Hel in the laboratory. Brigitte Helm also stars as Maria, the film's heroine, and hers is a standout performance.
Also of interest is the similarity between the character, Joh Frederson (the ""master"" of the city of Metropolis, played by Alfred Abel), to Adolph Hitler and his Third Reich. Combined with the workers, whose underground city seems like a concentration camp, and whose uniforms bear a startling resemblance to the ones worn in the Nazi concentration camps. This is especially odd considering that the film predates Hitler's rise by almost a decade. Those similarities are just one reason that the Nazis were so keen to destroy any trace of the film. It is truly a shame that Lang did not bring the negative when he escaped from Germany to the USA in the thirties.
In most science fiction, the message is about the human condition, and Metropolis is no exception; the moral is that the brain that plans and the hands that build need a mediator: the heart. That's as true today as it was in 1926.
At this writing, this version is no longer in print, which is a crying shame. Other versions are available, and I can recommend many of them, although some are made from prints that are in horrendous condition, but if you can find an affordable copy of the Moroder version, I cannot recommend it highly enough.",1029628800,67,3081,4.859315589353612

Try to obtain the version from Kino International which seems to be the best one out there in English.
The version by Moroder is also worth seeing. It is a crisp print with lots of restored scenes that are not found in other versions. However, it has been color tinted and has a modern rock scoring.

Because it really is one of the great films.  It is too big to encapsulate in a brief comment, but I particularly like the way the simplistic sentiments and linear narrative of the script are subverted by the four dream narratives (Lang's own on visiting Manhattan; Freder's hysterical hallucinations of everything as celestial or infernal; ethereal Maria's double exulting in dark desires; the sleepwalking life of the workers), the repeated motif of the circle and the post-modern conflation of vastly different historical time-spans.",985910400,3,870,5.258992805755396

In the reviews of the Aikman DVD, Scott D. Nelson provides an excellent summary of the many, many problems surrounding Metropolis (he says there are six different versions floating around).

The cruel story of the fictional modern world which is divided between the rich byrochrats and the poor laughbour people is not as dated as you might think at first. Poverty and luxury do not walk hand in hand in this epic film. No, they are the roots of misery. But the story itself might not be the greatest thing of all in this piece; the techinics and stunning camerascenes are still breathtakingly majestetic, and the power of mob is still impressive, no matter how you look at it. Personally I recommend you should buy the version which doesn't have the later-composed music on it; I'm sorry, but from my point of view, 80's synthetisizer pop just doesn't fit in with this epic/silent masterpiece. I had to put the sound off after 20 minutes, that much it pissed me. But, all in all, this is probably the best movie made until the year 1958 (Vertigo took over).",970099200,7,997,4.575418994413408

416205,5,6302035058,"Metropolis is a brilliant piece of work.  I'll say this up front to get it  out of the way:  I haven't seen the DVD, but I understand the arguments; I  have a slightly different opinion.  Most people absolutely adore the  Moroder release of Metropolis, with the tinted scenes and the modern (for  the 80's) soundtrack... but I personally found it atrocious.  The quality  was great, don't get me wrong.. but when I think of the imagery in this  film, I don't think of Bonnie Tyler and Queen.  I do, however, admire the  effort.  I definitely agree with putting modern scores with silent films,  this one just didn't work for me.
That said, I've noticed a lot of people  dissatisfied with the music on several releases.. I'm a bit of a fan of the  silent films.. I have yet to see one with a decent soundtrack.  If I see  one more 'Nosferatu' with a blaring organ score I swear I'll vomit; and  don't even get me started on the 1990 version of Phantom of the Opera with  score by Rick Wakeman.  But I am a big fan of the films, so this is how  I've managed to get past the horrible music without watching them silently.  Find a CD that reflects the ideas and atmosphere you feel to be present in  Metropolis, and let it play while you watch the film.
I have one of the  many 115-minute versions, and the image quality is a bit rough, but that  doesn't really bother me.. I've always seen Metropolis as an Industrial  film anyway.  The rough quality just adds to it for me (granted, I have  seen versions of this too rough to watch).  For that reason, I chose Nine  Inch Nails' ""The Fragile"" as the score for Metropolis.. it works  very well with my release.. some memorable moments (if you try this, you  may not get these exact moments with the different releases) are the  ""Moloch"" scene when Freder sees the machine explode .. the  workers gather their injured and dead as Trent Reznor screams the lyrics  ""Now you know - this is what it feels like"" - and the first scene  between Freder and Maria .. Freder kneeling at her feet, in a sort of  rapture.. while Trent sings ""I will take my place in the great  below"" .. that song (and the first disc of ""The Fragile"")  ends as Freder kisses Maria's hand and walks away.. But I won't give away  all the quirks.  Anyway, that's the score that works for me.. both discs of  the Fragile and the first two tracks of ""Further Down The Spiral""  at the end, since The Fragile isn't quite 115 minutes long.
But anyway,  having said all that, if you saw Metropolis and didn't like it because of  the quality or soundtrack or just because it was boring, try again, and  make your own score.  Most people who think they don't like silent films  simply don't like the music, or the silence.  This is understandable.. in  silent films the score is 75% of the atmosphere.  Use music that you know,  that you like.. music that will set the mood for horror if you're watching  ""Phantom"" or ""Nosferatu,"" or for Industrial SciFi if  you're watching ""Metropolis.""  I think you'll get a lot more out  of the genre that way.",969235200,22,3052,4.407942238267148

416207,5,6302035058,"I've never seen how a soundtrack destroyed one of the most important movies of history.  The 1998 Peter Osborne's Score sounds exactly like the music of a Nintendo game.  Just an absurd, out of scheme, sometimes even out of time, soundtrack that separates the spectator from the vision that  should be a silent movie.
By the way, some scenes that are supposed to be  tragic, the sound transforms it in a cheap comedy clip.
Now the reason i  gave this film 5 stars is how it's director (Fritz Lang) and author (the  wife of Fritz Lang) got ahead out of their time, showing us thru different  scenarios above the city (a King Kong 30's NY kind of city), with planes  flying around, while below the surface, thousands of slaves are risking  their lives in order to keep working so they could at least eat.
Actors  and actresses do their job in a standard way, making efforts to transmit  emotions (logic in a silent movie).
My DVD version is ""area 2""  and is from AEK or something (i decided to return it to the store beacuse  of the lausy soundtrack) and it keeps a perfect visual, never getting out  of frame.  Even, the presentation with a New Age Sound is incredible,  transporting me to future in my head...

The film begins with disclaimers and a 'moral'. ""The heart is the mediator between brain and muscle."" This is false, the nervous system interconnects the brain and the muscle. The story begins with abstract forms and gears. The time system is decimal rather than duodecimal. Whistles announce the day shift. Men walk in one direction while another group walks in the opposite direction. The city of the workers is below ground. Above ground lies the homes of the master class. A man embraces a woman. They see intruders: a woman with children. They are sent away. ""Who was that?"" ""The daughter of a worker."" Down below men tend machines. But something goes wrong! More workmen are sent through that open door. Casualties are carried out. We see airplanes fly over the city.

John Fredersen is the Master of Metropolis. He is told about the accident. They are unavoidable. Why did he go there? Where do the workers belong? ""In their proper place - the depths."" What if they turn against the Master? The foreman reports about plans found on two of the dead men. One man gets the blame and is fired. [Note the right to carry a concealed revolver.] Fredersen Junior asks for Joseph's help. Another worker toils at his machine. Rotwang the inventor lived in an old house. He created a machine that never tires or makes mistakes. There will be no need for human workers. Plans are being circulated among the workers. The ancient catacombs are beneath the city. The workers gather there. A woman tells them about the Tower of Babel. Those who planned the tower could not build it so they hired thousands to build it; these did not understand the plan. A mediator is needed. When will he come? This robot will create discord among the workers to destroy their confidence in Maria.

Maria plans a meeting in the cathedral tomorrow. Rotwang follows Maria and imprisons her in his house. Federsen Junior tries to rescue Maria but is trapped as the door closes. Rotwang operates his machines. [See the special effects!] Fredersen Junior is released and seeks Maria, who is with John Frederson. Fredersen Junior falls ill and is sent to bed. Will people believe the false Maria? Maria dances. This Robot will try to incite the workers to violence and destroy everything. ""Who are the slaves of the machine?"" But is this the real Maria? The crowd reacts and follows Maria to the Centra Power House. The destruction will flood the homes of the workers. Things begin to fall apart. Waters flood the building. Junior meets the real Maria.

John Fredersen watches the events. ""Where is my son?"" ""Save the children"" says Maria. The workers come upon the master classes and capture the false Maria. Will she be burned at the stake like a witch? People dance around like at some pagan festival. Where are their children? Junior fights Rotwang to rescue Maria. Maria repeats the line about the heart acts as a mediator between the hands and the brain. John Fredersen shakes hands with the foreman. The End.

This story argues for peace between the owners and their workers. Its not much of a drama aside from its use of a false leader to mislead the workers. Does that continue today?

Rotwang being lonely invents a robot replacement for Hel. Rotwang loses a hand in the process. We see the machine person Hel on the poster the same way Joh saw it when he learned of its existence.

Meantime it looks like Jon's son Freder Frederson (Gustov Fr&ouml;hlich) has been smitten by a kindly girl Maria (Brigitte Helm) with a mission. This mission is stated in the beginning credits as the ""Head"" and the ""Hands"" will be brought together by the ""Heart.""

Joh must squelch the son's infatuation with Maria and put the workers in their place.

Looking at the sight of Rotwang's machine person, an evil plan forms in Joh's mind. Little does he know what plan is in Rotwang's mind.

However, we do.

Hel is the name of the queen of Helheim, the Norse underworld.
