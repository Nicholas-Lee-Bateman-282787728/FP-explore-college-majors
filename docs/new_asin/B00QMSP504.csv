I would like to say I hate it and just stop watching, but it still intrigues me for some reason and I'm on the second disc ;-)",1426464000,2,300,4.375
6876638,5,B00QMSP504,"I walws 8 years old when this was on but don't remember ever watching it, I became a big fan of David Carridines later western Kung-fu and was always wanting to see this show..  I was perturbed by other reviews that it was a cheap ripoff of the movie which I also have on dvd but seeing this show I am sad there were only 17 episodes and wish David Carridine had gotten more noriety for this show",1426291200,5,396,4.076923076923077
6876639,5,B00QMSP504,"David Carradine stars as Shane, a gunfighter wandering the Wyoming territory of the late 19th century who hired on as a cowhand to champion the cause of widow, Marian Starett (Jill Ireland) and her young son, Joey (Christopher Shea) who sees Shane as a father figure since the death of his own Pa.

Tom Tully as Tom Starett, Marion's father-in-law.
Sam Gilman as Sam Grafton, the local  saloonkeeper.
Steve Ihnat as R. G. Posey, a down and out cowboy hired to work at the Starett ranch.
Robert Brown as Senator Warren Eliot, Marian's old flame.
Diane Ladd as Amy Sloate, the new school teacher.
Bert Freed as Rufe Ryker, a rancher who claims he has the right to all the land in the area because he was there first.  Whenever tragedy befalls the valley, you can be sure he's behind it.

The following is the episode guide for Shane  which originally aired in 1966 with key guest stars noted.

11
The Day the Wolf Laughed  ( J D Cannon, Skip Homeir )
 A gang of outlaws ride into town and cause so much ruckus that Grafton sends for Ryker, but that's before Shane begs him to let the men have their fun for two days, pay for the damages, then ride out.

16
The Great Invasion: Part 2 ( Bradford Dillman, Charles Grodin )
  That's only the beginning of Hackett's invasion, however. Shane is concerned for the homesteaders, and yes, even Ryker, who live in the valley and tries to warn them to join together to fight Hackett, because he WILL come. Everyone laughs in his face, however, and refuse to leave. Even Marion refuses to leave. When Shane has a talk with Joey, he realizes there is only one thing left to do. He may never see Marion again.
17

It was great seeing Steve Inhat, Gregory Walcott, and Daniel J.

6876659,5,B00QMSP504,"I hadn't read the novel or seen the movie, Shane. So, when I watched the TV series, Shane, as a teenager in 1966, I appreciated it for its own merits, of which there were many. After recently purchasing and watching the DVD of the series and after not seeing it in 50 years, I was reminded of just how special the series was with excellent acting and well-written stories containing action, humor, and romance.

David Carradine played Shane, the gunfighter who tried to overcome his past by working for and protecting the Starrett family--Marian, a widow (Jill Ireland), her son, Joey, (Christopher Shea--the voice of Linus in the Peanuts movies), and Tom Starrett, Marian's father-in-law (Tom Tully). The family were homesteaders in Wyoming in the late 1800s at odds with the local cattleman, Ruf Ryker (Bert Freed), who was determined to drive them and the other ""nesters"" out of ""his"" valley. It was obvious that Shane was more than a hired hand. He cared deeply for the family to the point of being a father figure for Joey and quietly loving Marian. In one episode, High Road to Viator, when Shane risks his life to retrieve Marian's dress from a thief, Marian stated that it was just a dress. To which Tom replied, ""...it's not just a dress, any more than Shane is just a hired man."" Unfortunately, Shane's past continued to haunt him, especially when he was in competition with Marian's other suitors. He felt he had nothing to offer her and Joey, and there was always the possibility of ""some yahoo riding into town to put me in a pine box.""

This quality western was up against tough competition when it aired, and was cancelled after 17 episodes. I'm glad these episodes have been resurrected on DVD so people who missed its original TV showing or a new generation of fans get a chance to appreciate an intelligent, classy western that died too soon.",1465776000,6,1860,4.7024539877300615

The interaction between the family and the other characters is always top notch. Even Ms. Starettts son Joey does a great job acting.  The local cattle baron, Ryker, (Bert Freed) can play both Shane's antagonist and his friend in an on again off again bout of greed and necessity.

I never heard of this series and it was some sort of spinoff of the movie Shane from the 1950's.  The only reason I can think of for its being cancelled is the terrible opening sequence and music.  Perhaps, it didn't grab the audience.  Great show.",1430524800,15,913,4.8076923076923075

I loved the ""Kung Fu"" series David Carradine starred in.  I also am a big fan of the movie ""Shane"" (starring Alan Ladd).  That movie was a REAL classic!  However, for a TV series of only about 17 episodes with less than an ""official"" full-term TV season, this set is not worth over $15, if that!  It obviously did not meet the expectations of many of the fans of the original movie.  This might be worth the buy (sub-$15 levels), just to see David Carradine in a non-""Kung Fu"" character role.  I'm not going to discredit its merits.  However, the short-term existence of this series speaks something of its worth!  Amazon's price finally hit my ""sweet"" spot for justifying purchase, so I bought a copy.  Now I'll be able to see if it was even worth the $14.96.",1427500800,2,904,4.559006211180124

I believe Shane was a show that didn't survive because it was in a brutal time slot against tough competition and it got clobbered in the ratings. In my opinion this was a well-done program that deserved better, it is certainly of interest to fans of the Western genre and to see David Carradine prior to his ""Kung Fu"" success.",1427414400,8,602,4.635514018691588

6876708,4,B00QMSP504,"Shane In Color, and still wearing it's opening abc moniker announcing that it is in color, is enjoyable to watch. David Carradine's Shane is a bit less sure of himself than the older Alan Ladd of the earlier 1953 film, but this makes his character more interesting to watch as he doesn't as easily perservere. Jill Ireland is excellent as a gorgeous widow, and Tom Tully is his surly self as her father-in-law, whose grandson, played by Christopher Shea, was the voice of Linus on Charlie Brown. Bert Freed is the land owner who wants these nesters off his land. I first saw this series on TV Land in 1998-99, when it was being rerun on Saturday afternoons with the likes of Johnny Ringo (CBS 1959-60) and The Rebel (abc 1959-61), in the days when that cable network showed programs not commonly repeated. One of Shane's downfalls had to be that it was one of 3 similar programs debuting in the 1966 TV season, along with abc's The Monroes, and NBC's The Road West, none of which saw a second season. I took one star off, because two of the discs have 6 episodes on them, though the discs play well, and look good, considering this is not a restored series. I'm grateful to Timeless for putting Shane out on DVD, and I wouldn't mind seeing The Monroes (co-starring Barbara Hershey) filmed in the beautiful Grand Tetons of Wyoming, The Monroes were up against opposing forces: Major Mapoy, and the ruthless land baron Barney Wales (Robert Middleton), who used to shout ""Nestors!"", as he and his sons attacked.",1427155200,10,1508,4.630597014925373

8691974,5,B00QMSP504,"SHANE; I learned about this T.V. series while reading a biography on Jim Morrison. While living in Venice Beach in 1966, Jim would go to a friends apartment to watch this show. He said that he loved everything about David Carradine's mannerisms and the way he dressed, especially the conch belt. It was because of his love of the 'Shane' character that he had an exact duplicate, 'pure silver' conch belt made for himself. It cost him $1,000 in 1967 to have it custom made. After watching the series on DVD and being a faithful Jim Morrison fan I noticed how much Jim took from the series and used in his stage performance. Who would of thought that David Carradine had so much to do with how cool Jim Morrison was.",1519257600,3,715,4.465648854961832
