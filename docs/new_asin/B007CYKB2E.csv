8514751,4,B007CYKB2E,Nice video especially for the price but make sure your player can play discs in PAL format. Most US players do not support PAL and are NTSC only. This formatting has nothing to do with the region coding for the disc- I believe this disc is Region Code 9 which is unlocked for all regions assuming the player can support the PAL formatting. I believe this was the issue the previous reviewer experienced with the disk not playing. The Amazon description has the PAL notation in small print and it can be easily overlooked or misunderstood. The disc has 3 segments of which 2 are available in English or German. The third is in German only regardless if you pick English or German language in the menu. That is why I deducted one star. Overall it does a good job of showcasing and telling the history of the cathedral. I learned a few new things even though I toured it this summer.,1506384000,,880,4.438271604938271
8514752,1,B007CYKB2E,"I was looking forward to this video.  The price was excellent and there is simply nothing better than a well-made video (short of actually seeing it in person)to study and get a sense of something as complex as a cathedral on this scale.  Unfortunately, the disc will not play on any of my machines.  I had suspected (and still suspect) that it is a region problem, even though this one is supposed to be either region free or for US-Canada machines.  The cost of sending it back is greater than the cost of the DVD, and I am loathe to invest another chunk of change along with postage to try another copy.  I suspect it is a great video, but as it stands, I would advise extreme caution for anyone contemplating a purchase.",1342396800,7,724,4.413533834586466
