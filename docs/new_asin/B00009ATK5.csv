8179117,5,B00009ATK5,This Pokemon VHS is the only Pokemon VHS that is not done Pioneer. This is a very good Pokemon VHS in episodes contents. It is very high voltage VHS though.,1065312000,,156,4.233333333333333
8179118,1,B00009ATK5,"The High Voltage Series continues with this new entry, ""Crash of the Dairy"". The three episodes featured are ""A Goldenrod Opportunity"", where Ash faces Whitney, the Goldenrod Gym Leader in a tough match, ""A Dairy Tale Ending"" where after his defeat, Ash challenges Whitney to a rematch, and ""Beauty and the Breeder"", with Brock reuniting with Susie, the trainer who gave him Vulpix.
While these are good episodes and all, I have to ask... WHY? These episodes have already been released on DVD (See Road to the Johto League Champion and Journey to the Johto League Champion DVDs) so it just seems like a huge waste to release these three episodes on DVD, when you can get the same on the other two DVDs, plus 11 more.
This is the first Pokemon DVD that is not distributed by Pioneer, so it remains to be seen how the quality will hold up against previous releases.",1052265600,5,863,4.6103896103896105
