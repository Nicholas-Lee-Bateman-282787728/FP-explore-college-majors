1652873,4,B00005R24H,"I must start off by saying that I am a fan of zombie movies, so my opinion is somewhat biased. However, because I am such a fan, I can compare this movie to many others, and I think it does quite well. The plot is nothing extraordinary; there is a SWAT team that is sent to an island laboratory to see what is the matter (there has been no contact since an accident at the lab, and the mainland is not aware of the accident). Once they get to the island, they meet up with several other people who have seen the zombies. Soon the group is trying to escape, but realizes that they will have to go to the lab in order to find a way out.
  The movie has a scene early in with the SWAT team attacking a group of terrorists, and the entire thing feels just like the opening of Dawn of the Dead. Also, several songs were ripped from the Goblin's music for Day of the Dead, and possibly from some of Fulci's movies. However, these details don't hurt the movie, they almost make the movie seem more credible.
  Now, if you are watching a zombie movie, chances are it is because you like the gore. If so, don't worry - there is plenty of gore to go around in this movie. It has some very funny zombie deaths, and that alone justifies buying it.
  The transfer on the disk is very clean for a movie of this caliber, which is another plus.
  Overall, this is a movie that I recommend to anyone interested in zombie - or just horror - movies.",1026172800,2,1430,4.137184115523466

The things about movies like this, is that you just have to sit back with an open mind and let it just rip! Evene if the acting is bad, and the dialouge is horrible, it's still great comedy in my mind. I've never seen a more funny Zombie movie in my life than this one. I still have my old 1988 VHS version ""Night Of The Zombies"" in the non-widescreen, dark, grainy, gory glory. I love this movie. One of my favorites. The stock footage itself it worth the movie, not to mention the gory FX, and the ending sceen with the repoter getting nher tounge ripped-out and her eyeballs gouged out of the sockets from the inside is PURE GENIUS!!!! Obviously you have to think a lot before you have a good Zombie death scene. I love the DVD version. Much more clearer, the sound is better, and the lighting, oh my god, you wouldn't believe how much better it is from the old 1988 VHS version.

1652877,3,B00005R24H,"Prior to purchasing this DVD, I had a very bad copy that was made back in 1988 of the VHS rental (under the title ""Night of the Zombies""), not in widescreen.  Frankly, the picture quality is almost TOO good for this movie, as I was so used to seeing it very grainy and at times incoherrent. The ""native village"" scene is a prime example: when ""Santoro"" is kissing the woman, I never even knew what caused her to scream (the zombie that appeared on the right to bite her which I'd never seen before); also a cut from one SWAT guy shooting to a closeup of a zombie getting hit in the head, wincing and falling out of the frame, very dark and hard to make out in my old copy, was very bright and clear on the DVD. And, of course, the most ""eye popping"" effect of all is more satisfying on the widerr frame :) Overall, the effects seem a little bit better on this print, as Anchor Bay seems to take careful steps in presenting their releases in the best possible light (""Dawn of the Dead"" is another excellent example).  I would've liked to have seen some actor bios or even interviews with some of them, in spite of their obviously meager careers...would be interesting!

1652895,1,B00005R24H,"Hell of the Living Dead (1981)

 Hell of the Living Dead has at least half a dozen alternate titles.  Let's stick with this as it is the most common English Language version.  We can describe this film as Italian movie filmed in Spain and badly dubbed in English.  We could also call it a typical Italian cheapo sexploitation film.  We might very accurately describe it as total trash.
 Most of this thing has no reason to watch it at all.  The acting does not meet professional standards.  The direction sucks, as an example-all the gun fire sounds obviously came to the sound track post production, and apparently without the sound guy watching the film.  There are two guys credited with continuity but there isn't any.  We have people in New Guinea fleeing from the Zombies then the film cuts to elephants running around then back to New Guinea in the jungle then to the Australian desert to watch a dingo chase a wallaby.  I haven't seen this kind of rampant footage stuffing since the hay day of Ed Wood of Plan 9 From Outer Space fame.
 Sometimes the Natives of New Guinea look just like Natives of New Guinea.  In those scenes the clips are clearly taken from some National Geographic special or some other unrelated documentary.  The other New Guinea Natives look like Spaniards with curly wigs and dark make up or sometimes just Spaniards.  I have a hard time believing that something with such a careless attitude to film making could have been produced by professionals.
 Sadly, these film makers have a long list of professional movies on their sheet.  None of them are very good however.  The director-Bruno Mattei- he took the screen name of Vincent Dawn for this movie for reasons that escape me.  Mattei directed the last half of Zombie 3 when shlock legend Lucio Fulci took ill half way through filming.  He went on to direct stuff like Porn Holocaust which shows where his head is at.  He directed scores of similar films.  Before his death in 2006 he made Zombie: the Beginning and Island of the Living Dead so he never lost his interest in Zombie flicks.
 The alleged writer of this terrible disappointment-Claudio Fragasso- also helped to direct the film.  From the utterly disconnected plot line I am astonished that they had enough of a script to credit a writer.
 I say disappointment because these guys are genuine film makers.  There are parts of the film that are good enough to watch without pulling your hair out by the roots.  But inconsistent.  Sometimes the Zombie munching is very good, even excellent for the times.  Ditto for the Zombie shooting-the exploding head sort of thing.  We get some very good effects but they poke their heads up from a sea of Zombies just sort of falling over.  Great potential but not carried through.
 The director (directors) allows his actors to behave in utterly unrealistic ways.  In more than one scene people just watch as Zombies slowly stagger in their direction, reach them and eat them.  The Zombies are so slow moving that one of the characters moves among them taunting them, at yet, slow as the Zombies are, some of the characters just stand still and wait to be eaten.  Phooey.
 At the opening I had high hopes.  A technician in a chemical plant (where the Zombie gas is made) gets eaten by a rat that gets into his protective suit.  Pretty gross and cool but it goes South from there.
 The hero commandos who fight the Zombies are supposed to be crack American troops but they look like Italian hippies and cafe Lotharios dressed in janitor overalls.  Director Mattei did have the good sense to cast Margit Evelyn Newton as the leading lady.  Despite her name she has Rome as a birth place and had a stellar career as a photo model in Italian skin magazines.  Mattei has her infiltrate the native village by stripping down to a few leaves around her lower parts and painting her face and breasts native style (Italian style but never mind).  The camera lingers on her assets.
 Italian films, even low budget Italian films, often have something to offer but not this one.
 Twice in the film we hear the phrase May God forgive us for what we have produced here.
 One brain, and this from a guy that likes pretty, scantily clad girls.  Rated R the film lasts one hour and 41 minutes but it actually is so boring that it seems longer.",1431216000,,4311,4.62532981530343

The other thing which many other reviewers have mentioned is the stock nature and tribal footage, the tribal footage makes sense as to kind of lead up to when they meet up with the tribe but the numerous nature and wildlife shots are just so out of place that you can't not notice it.  Other than that, it's the typical B movie with terrible acting and overbore gore. It's something I watch every now and then when I'm bored.

1652936,1,B00005R24H,"<strong>Hell of the Living Dead</strong> (Bruno Mattei, 1980)

I don't know why I continue to watch Bruno Mattei flicks. Mattei's MO was simple: take the flavor of the week, rip it off with minimal changes, and release the resultant low-budget product to make a few bucks. (Anyone familiar with the work of infamous ""mockbuster"" studio The Asylum knows exactly how the chorus of this song goes....) He did it from day one (his second feature, known in English as <em>SS Girls</em>, is a ripoff of <em>Ilsa</em>, released two years previously) right up until his death (his final feature, 2004's <em>Zombies: The Beginning</em>, is <em>Aliens</em>, but with zombies). So it should be no surprise that this 1980 crapfest is more of the same; it's <em>Zombi 2</em> combined with <em>Cannibal Holocaust</em>. It is, of course, as good as neither, and I say this as someone who thinks <em>Cannibal Holocaust</em> is one of the ten most overrated horror films ever made.

Plot: an accident at a chemical facility in New Guinea turns most of the workers there into flesh-eating zombies (who, needless to say, hunt down the rest of the employees in the opening sequence). Two teams are sent in to find out what's going on--a military unit headed up by (handsome, square-jawed Neanderthal) Mike London (<em>Conquest</em>'s Jos Gras) and a media crew featuring (gorgeous, young, tanned) Lia Rousseau (<em>The Final Executioner</em>'s Margit Evelyn Newton). Let's get those kids together in the midst of the zombie apocalypse, shall we? The two crews team up in a ""strength-in-numbers"" attept to make it to the chemical plant, dodging zombies the entire way, in order to figure out what ultimately went wrong.

The fact that Bruno Mattei's name is on this film should tell you all you need to know; the acting is far more horrific than the special effects Mattei's $2.98 (estimated) effects budget could get him, the pace is ridiculous, the cinematography looks as if the cameras were being operated by drunk babboons. (Actually, the drunk babboons would have probably had a union, gotten certifications, and done a better job). This is intensely, incredibly stupid, and unless you are a hardcore zombie fan who's seen every other zombie movie in existence that was not directed by Bruno Mattei, you can safely avoid this mess. ",1341532800,,2317,5.089473684210526
1652957,5,B00005R24H,"Most of the reviews of this film around the Internet seem to be written by the new breed of B-movie ""fans"".....hipsters who think they've seen it all, and call almost every film they review ""the worst movie ever made"". Most of the Amazon reviews, thankfully, don't go this route, and while pointing out the film's flaws, they also note that it's massively entertaining.

Which it is! It's not DAWN OF THE DEAD or ZOMBIE. It's a sometimes inept, often laughable ripoff of those films. But it's fast paced, full of action and gore, and besides the awful stock footage and terrible kung-fu style dubbing, it's actually fairly well photographed and directed.

The music score from Goblin is ripped off from DAWN, CONTAMINATION, and BEYOND THE DARKNESS (no Lucio Fulci films, despite some ignorant ""reveiwers"" claims) and I never found this to be a problem. In my opinion, HELL actually utilizes the Goblin tracks far more effectively than those films did. (Goblin cut about 10 music tracks for DAWN; Romero only used 3 of those, and for the rest of the film used library music. HELL only uses 3 Goblin tracks for DAWN. As far as CONTAMINATION goes, the Goblin music was the only thing that made that film worth watching. And only one track from BEYOND THE DARKNESS was used here, over the end credits.)

And I love the goofy moments of this film, like the tutu-wearing SWAT guy, the zombie rat, the overacting angry father who gets eaten by his kid. These are classic moments! And the film does have a few memorably creepy (though not scary by at means) moments, like the wounded blonde staggering back to the jeep while the zombie priest persues her, or the dead African outside the village returning to life, or the zombie kid returning to life with a deadened gaze....well, until he grits his teeth and slooowwwly looks at his sleeping dad, that part is hilarious.

All in all, if you're a casual zombie fan, you'll probably like this, but if want a serious collection of Italian horror films, this is an essential purchase.

Until this DVD release, HELL was only available via a crappy full-frame US vhs release (called NIGHT OF THE ZOMBIES) which was pulled from very badly made theatrical prints from the US release in the early 80's (I saw it at my local AMC at the age of 11 with my uncle, who laughed like hell through the whole film) or a not-much-better Japanese VHS release that was commonly bootlegged here....that release was at least widescreen, but was still so dark that some scenes were confusing. This DVD release was like watching a brand new film, relatively speaking....it's bright and colorful and has good sound, though the stock footage still looks awful.

1652958,3,B00005R24H,"Bad dubbing is how I can sum it up for the main thing that made this movie not so good. There are three things that go into zombie movies: makeup/fx, screenplay & T&A. If you can pull off only two of those you will have a decent zombie flick. I think bad dubbing killed the screenplay & it did have some T&A  but, it is not long & does not fit well with the events of the movie. At the tribal village the lady goes in nude & in minutes she is back in her normal clothes (I find that totally unrealistic). I believe that she should have stayed that way either the rest of the movie or at least until they left the village.(Return of the Living Dead pulled that off well) Also, her grass ""skirt"" looked more like a pair of underwear made out of leaves. Either full nude or a real grass skirt would have been better. Other than that the makeup & fx was fair at best (I do realize that it is an old movie with a limited budget). The gore was really good but, makeup & the scene at the end where the girl gets killed is horrible.

The movie itself was not that bad & I actually enjoyed it but, it would not be on any top ten list I would ever have.",1315785600,,1143,3.965217391304348
1652959,5,B00005R24H,"I just recently got ""hell of the living dead"" or what i know the movie better as ""night of the zombies"" and i was scared of the quality of the movie but i was truly surprised when i got it.  I remember watching this movie when i was younger for my father had it on VHS but the quality was so terrible it was hard to tell what was going on.  But after watching the movie and seeing the condition it was in i was so happy and so glad i bought the movie.  The quality looked like they took their time remastering the movie.  I don't really need to give the plot since so many others have gave there summary of the movie.  All you need to know is that the movie has a fairly loss story line that strings together for a pretty dark ending.  If you are like me and love Blood and guts, also T&A this is your movie there is very few boring moments in the movie every 5 to 10 minutes there's a zombie munching on someone and gunfire going off.  This movie also has some comedic moments to it where one of the soldiers dress's in a tutu and begins singing ""singing in the rain"" with a surprise at the end. Might i also add FINALLY! and I MEAN FINALLY YOU HAVE SOMEBODY THAT KEEPS REPEATING SHOOT THEM IN THE HEAD and doesn't keep shooting them in the stomach and chest hoping to kill them.  Also as my title refers to there are moments in this movie where its so gruesome that if your eating you have to stop or turn the tv off cause it finally gets to you.  This movie is not for the screamish but is a good movie to sit down and watch when you have a date with you or having nothing better to do during the weekend.

I'm also surprised with the special features this DVD carries
-Trailer: which seems to be almost remastered unlock other old movies i bought where they have remastered the movie but not the trailer i give them credit for doing it here.

-Bruno Mattei Featurette: I 9 minute mini movie with Bruno talking about Both ""Hell of the living dead"" and ""Rats"" and talking about what inspired him and what he liked and hated about each movie.

-Poster & still Gallery: not bad little special feature showing the original movie posters that came out for it

5/5 in my book truly a guilty pleasure lets hope we keep seeing the Italian horror movies keep coming out and not fade into history and forgotten.

1652960,4,B00005R24H,"I first saw this on a pay-channel back when I was about fourteen...I loved it then, so when I saw it here on DVD, I just had to have it.  Reading some of the reviews, however, I was worried that perhaps my youthful mind made it better in my memory than it actually was, but being a completist (and that it wasn't expensive), I ordered it anyways.

I'm glad that I did:)

Now I wouldn't presume to sit here and say that this is a ""good"" film; I certainly won't perjure myself by saying it's ""well-made"", ""well-written"", or ""well-acted""...none of the above would be true.

I WILL say that if you're even looking at this title, then you should KNOW what you're in for, and for what this movie IS, it's GREAT.

Yes, it is an obvious attempt at a European ""Dawn of the Dead"" clone, following Argento's version of DotD and Fulci's ""Zombi""...yes, it rips off the costumes, music, plot elements, and even LINES from Romero flicks (but what zombie film of the last thirty years HASN'T ripped off Romero on SOME level?)...yes, the acting is amatuerish at best and the dubbing is atrocious...

And yes, it's AWESOME for those of us who sift through the detritus of the horror genre looking for that little gem that makes us retch and laugh at the same time.

The intercut stock footage and weak storyline contribute to this entry as a great 'bad' horror film; sure, it's nice to see a horror flick with genuine social commentary or important backstory to make it relate to us as real live people, but it's JUST as great sometimes to just watch a horror movie to be horrified...and this one delivers.  The gore scenes are inspired; sure, some of it's obviously folks 'noshing on raw meat, but how is that worse than watching actors chewing on latex appliances?  I've watched many many many many (ad nauseum) horror films, and THIS particular entry is in my top ten for original splatter scenes, particularly for that famous scene near the end.  Do all of these make sense (the infamous 'cat in the corpse' scene)?  Heck no!  But it's things like that that make this little movie memorable!

If you're looking for Oscar-winning story, directing, or acting, you're looking in the wrong place...if you're wanting a Romero film, then watch a Romero film...but if you're like me, and occasionally enjoy an old-fashioned, 'bad' splatter-flick, I recommend you at LEAST rent this one for a screening...I myself had to have it for my 'zombie' rack...

1652961,4,B00005R24H,"Bruno Mattei's zombie film Hell of the Living Dead(Zombie Creeping Flesh, Night of the Zombies, Virus) eats the sanity out of it's viewers. Hell of the Living Dead is known for it's gore, inserted stock footage, and soundtrack lifted from other movies. Those infamous characteristics are why people love it or hate it.

Hell of the Living Dead is about an accident at a chemical plant which brings the dead back to life. Meanwhile, domestic terrorists hold a building hostage to get the government to stop it's WMD manufacturing and chemical weapon research. A SWAT team comes in and kills the terrorists. The SWAT team go to Papa New Guinea and meet an athropologist and her cameraman who were attacked by zombies. They are desperate to escape the madness.

The movie is a ripoff of Dawn of the Dead. It has the same score as Dawn of the Dead and the SWAT team are wearing the same suits from Dawn of the Dawn. There is also stock footage inserted so Mattei would save for the budget. The stock footage is of animals and natives. Some of the footage is disturbing showing burial rites and field dressing. Those scenes were probably lifted from mondo films. The stock footage gets annoying. The gore is over-the-top. Plentiful of prolonged feasting and some gore from the stock footage. The gore is out-dated to today's standards but watch out for the stock footage and one of the ending scenes.

Hell of the Living Dead is not the greatest movie but it's not the worst. It's fun and all because of the cheesiness but it's only for those who like cult classics and gore. This movie is also paired with Mattei's Rats on Anchor Bay which is now out of print. Bruno Mattei will remind you as the Ed Wood of Italian horror.",1273708800,,1719,4.592833876221499
1652962,4,B00005R24H,"I really enjoy Italian horror movies, most especially zombie movies. ""Hell of the Living Dead"" and director Bruno Mattei offer a film comparable to Lucio Fulci's Zombie 2. While not as infamous as Fulci's film, this movie offers a decent story line, with good gore and the extraordinary setting of New Guinea. At times my attention was slipping during this film, but there are honestly more zombie movies from 30 years ago that have lost my attention more quickly than this one. At least the gore is good enough to finish it out.

Blue Underground, the company that seems to be releasing this DVD has had some other good releases such as ""Let Sleeping Corpses Lie"", ""Dead and Buried"", ""Shock Waves"", and ""Zombie 2""... to mention some of  their zombie movies. All of these are good for a watch",1270425600,,792,4.690647482014389

That is just one of the crazy and memorable scenes from this movie. I have never heard of this movie before until recently. Being a fan of George A. Romero's zombie films, I just had to have it in my collection. Is it as bad as everyone says that it is? Yes. But it is also still very entertaining, and creepy too in parts here and there, I might add.

I really liked the actors that they picked to star in this movie. They're all great. The dubbed voice actors are excellent too, and even though I have not heard the actor's original voices, I think that they did a really good job matching the dubbed voices to the characters. They just fit really well, in my opinion.

The only downside was that a lot of the movie spent it's time in the jungle. I think that if the movie had stuck with the more civilized areas throughout the entire film that it would have been much better. Still, it was a fun zombie movie that was well worth the money spent.",1257638400,,1171,4.2657657657657655

Footage taken from what looks like old 70's or 80's national geographic shots of animals and tribes people are randomly thrown in throughout jungle scenes. The voices are dubbed making it seem quite silly yet there is enough gore for it to keep the ol' horror fan with an appreciation for older foreign flicks (namely the ending scene and some others). Also as usual Blue Underground has made a clean re-cut of the original film so the picture quality better than average. I watched this movie with a larger group of people and almost the whole time we were hysterical over the stock footage added into the film, the cuts of scenes, the zombie effects and the lines throughout the movie.

1652990,3,B00005R24H,"A scientific experiment goes wrong at a lab in New Guinea resulting in the outbreak of a deadly virus with horrifying symptoms. The disease spreads quickly, and soon the island is overrun by flesh-eating zombies. When a commando squad shows up on the island without knowing the situation, they proceed on dead reckoning, picking up an attractive television reporter and her cameraman along the way. Those that survive make their way to the Hope Centre laboratory where the disease originated to discover it's dark purpose.

""Hell of the Living Dead,"" AKA ""Virus,"" AKA ""Zombi 4,"" AKA ""Zombi 5: Ultimate Nightmare,"" AKA ""Zombie Creeping Flesh"" and a slew of other names, is, in many ways, your typical Italian ""Dawn of the Dead"" wannabe. There's plenty of cannibalistic gore, a swat team, lots of shooting, and they even borrow the music by Goblin. The film also uses stock footage to give the impression that it takes place in New Guinea when it was actually shot in Spain (it's not THAT badly done though).  Nevertheless, ""Hell of the Living Dead"" is somehow more engaging than other films of its type. Perhaps it's the characters, badly dubbed as they are (hate that UN scene). Perhaps it's the breasts. For some, it's probably the butcher shop gore and crocodile gutting scene. There's also the origin of the disease that is revealed at the end, which I think definitely takes the film up a notch. I also love that the film includes a final scene, similar to what Fulci did in ""Zombie"" though not quite as grand, showing that the virus has moved out of the jungle and on to a highly populated area, as I personally prefer seeing zombie films set in more civilized locales to the jungle zombie films. It's just scarier when you see it happening in an area that looks more familiar to you. Overall, if you enjoy zombie films you should see this one, and especially if you're a fan of the Italian entries into the genre. The DVD from Anchor Bay (mine is the double feature version with ""Rats"") looks great in widescreen and includes a trailer, still and poster gallery, a text bio of director Bruno Mattei, and a pretty good interview with the director as well (entitled, ""Hell Rats of the Living Dead"").",1188777600,2,2203,4.71948051948052
1652991,3,B00005R24H,"I don't know if we're even talking about the same movie here -- this is definitely NOT the worst zombie movie ever made.  A big problem on Amazon reviews is that reviewers just say a product is ""good"" or ""bad,"" but give no actual description.  So instead of doing that, I'll just describe a few things about it, then let you decide if it sounds good or not.

Is it boring?  In order for something to be boring, I would say it needs to have pretty much nothing happen for a very, very long period of time.  Thats not so in this film; there are several scenes of zombie attacks, a plethora of zombie shootings, and quite a few zombie bitings (all the makings of a good zombie movie).  Also, there is some pointless (and culturally offensive) nudity.  As far as the acting -- not great, but at least they show emotion (even if it is too much), which is better than a lot of the lifeless acting in most Euro-sleaze.

Is it a blatant rip-off of ""Dawn of the Dead?""  Yes and no; the costumes are clearly designed to look like the SWAT team blue uniforms in Dawn, and they even ""borrowed"" some of the Goblin soundtrack from Dawn (hey, at least they ""borrowed good music).  Other than that, its very different -- the group is constantly moving, not trapped in a single space, the cause of the zombies is explicitly stated to be intentional and man-made, and it is not a ""zombie holocaust"" like Dawn -- for almost the entirety of the movie, the zombies are confined to New Guinea, and several cut-away scenes reveal that the rest of the world is still operating normally (although panicy).

Is the story oscar-worthy?  No, but then again, if you're considering buying a movie called ""Hell of the Living Dead,"" you probably know what kind of story to expect.  The plot is very simple -- nuclear plant-look-alikes are being used to create some sort of super secret project, which has accidentally (or was it?) been released into the Native population of New Guinea. A crack para-military unit is sent to the site of original infection for reasons explained in the film.

Are the special effects bad?  For a 1980 Italian movie, no.  In fact, there are several quite good head-shots.  Of course, there are several scenes where the actors are clearly holding raw meat on the victim and chewing on that, and many of the zombies are simply painted blue -- then again, so are practically all the zombies in Dawn.

The worst part of the movie is the director's annoying habit of splicing in stock footage of wildlife, footage which is clearly of lower quality and not blended into the film well at all.

So, is this a terrible movie?  No, certainly not.  In my mind, terrible movies are movies that are technically inept or that have incomprehensible plots, like ""Oasis of the Zombies"" and ""Children of the Living Dead.""  Other than that, its just a matter of opinion.  If you like sleazy Italian horror, especially Italian zombie movies, you should find this entertaining.  If you're looking for a well-crafted Romero-esque film with biting and deep social commentary, this isn't your film.",1182211200,,3073,4.627306273062731

Synopsis is simple, a New Guinea chemical accident gains the attention of a SWAT team and a news reporter. When the team finally penetrates the chemical cloud, they find flesh eating undead zombies hungry for fresh human flesh. The movie is full of nudity, cheesy gore effects, and terrible acting. While most zombie movies aren't really scary to me, they are eerie for the most part. They usually have good settings and a spooky score to accompany it. ""Hell of the Living Dead"" supplies neither and it was hard to keep from laughing. There are much better Italian zombie movies out there.

I guess these movies are a matter of taste. This one just didn't do it for me (neither have any other Mattei movies).

The best part about this film is the pace it is told at.  The movie does not move very fast, but cannot be considered slow-moving either.  This really sets up the anticipation and suspense and really makes this movie quite enjoyable.

The story is simple.  There is a large, experimental project taking place at a large factory.  The name of the project is H.O.P.E. and things go bad quickly.  There is a sudden leakage of a checmical fume, which infects the body, kills the human, and then brings them back as a zombie, complete with all the typical zombie traits.

Our main characters are a small group of soldiers, sent on a top-secret mission through the jungle.  On their way, they run into 4 travelers and thier young, recently bitten child.  two of these travelers survive the upcoming zombie attack and join the army group on the rest of their mission---for protection.

On the way to their ""final destination"" the group repeatedly runs into zombies and must fight their way through them.

This movie beat all expectations I had.  I love zombie movies and always find something about them that I will like, but this was an even better surprise.  As always, I read all the reviews on this site and so many people have written negative things about this movie, that I was beginning to have doubts.  But, after watching the movie, I see that either they just could not get over the soundtrack thing OR they just don't like zombie flicks; and let me warn you, if you do NOT like zombies, flesh, gore, blood and tension, then do NOT watch this movie!! it's that simple!!

Oh yeah, speaking of the gore; there is more than plenty of it. And the about the whole ripping off of the soundtrack; hey, as far as I',m cancerned, the ""Dawn of the Dead"" soundtrack is one of my all time favorites, so to hear it in another movie, only means I can hear it more.  I know where it originated, so who cares that it was used in another zombie flick...just goes to show that Goblin created the ultimate music to watch zombies to.

Ok, a lot of people need more, but personally, I don't. Then again, maybe I'm too much of a zombie movie fan, I like a lot of zombie movies just because they're gory, they have pathetic stories and acting, but I don't care!

Sure it has an amazingly inept ""Ed Wood-ian"" sort of quality... ok yes, it IS in fact a terrible film, but it does have a lot going for it. #1 - The entertainment value. Like Ed Wood's ""classics"" this film remains totally enjoyable and even has a certain lovable quality despite the fact that it's such an awful film. It's lots of fun and there's never a dull moment.
#2 - There are some truly effective Zombie sequences. The scenes involving the zombie priest at the mission, the zombie kid coming to life in his fathers arms, the dead native coming to life after his ""funeral ceremony"". Also the zombie hag with a cat inexplicably ripping out through her stomach made me laugh. It made no sense, but it was still cool. #3 - Last but not least, the gore. As the producers said, without blood and entrails, a film like this would be pointless. This film will make your stomach turn. It goes far beyond Dawn of the Dead as far as blood and guts. Even farther than Lucio Fulci's Zombie. The gore is probably not as disturbing as in Day of the Dead because Tom Savini's fx were just so realistic in that one. However the use of real raw meat and pig guts definitely helped ""Hell"" live up to the splatter genre and then some. The extreme close-ups of maggots crawling through rotting flesh and a native picking them off and eating them were absolutely nasty! Also there are some well done exploding zombie heads. The zombie attack and gut munching scenes are hit or miss. Sometimes they come off as startlingly realistic, other times they are obviously fake. But this film doesn't skimp on the blood and guts. Also towards the end, there's a facial ""violation"" scene that rivals Fulci's ""splinter through the eye"" sequence.
Overall, if you're looking for Zombie crme de la crme, stick to Romero and Fulci, but if you're just in the mood for something gross and fun, check ""Hell"" out.",1079308800,43,2375,4.577464788732394
1653048,3,B00005R24H,"Movie starts off when a factory filled with toxins is let loose and everyone in the factory is killed and turned into zombies. Meanwhile a Swat team, a chick and a camera dude go to an island to investigate bizarre stuff there, and eventually run into zombies. Later on they find out that the natives there are turning into zombies which later reveals that the factory with the toxic [stuff] polluted their water supply. So it goes on to the end with the battle between the living and the dead.
I love this movie alot, but I felt that 3 stars was a fair  enough score for it for this reason. The picture was really bad. There are some scenes in the movie where you can't figure out what's going on in the movie cuz it was way too dark. The acting was a bit annoying to where one guy tells the others about a thousand times to shoot the zombies in the head and the others act dumb and don't shoot them in the head. All in all, the gore was creepy and sick and the plot is actually not that bad. If it had better picture it would of been a classic film.

1653049,3,B00005R24H,"Also known as ""Night Of The Zombies"", this is possibly the very worst in the countless Italian zombie films. It has many of the same concepts and ideas from a number of other zombie films and also ""borrows"", without shame, some of the musical score from DAWN OF THE DEAD. Bruno Mattei was clearly fascinated by the work of Romero and Lucio Fulci but sadly could not re-create the masterpiece that was DAWN or even the lesser ZOMBIE 2.
HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD involves a chemical spill that causes a zombie plague across the world. An elite but poorly-dubbed SWAT team is sent in to handle the problem. With the help of a female reporter who decides to take it all off in an attempt to communicate with a group of islanders, the team attempts to take on the walking dead. There is a whole lot of ""stock footage"" used for absolutely no reason, which really helps push the odd level through the roof. If that's not enough, we got random cross-dressing and some psycho SWAT guy who won't stop teasing the zombies. The memorable ending is also worth the price of admission but I won't spoil it for you.
If you're not a fan of either gore, Italian zombie films, or just all-around bad movies, you may want to avoid this one but if you are, this one sure is a treat. This one is like ""Lucio Fulci meets Ed Wood"". If you enjoyed it, you may want to upgrade to the similiar but superior ZOMBIE 3.

I must say that I was afraid at first that I had picked up the wrong film.....I hadn't. This movie may disgust some of you (it should) and thats why I love it. I just had to add this to my Horror collection (filed away in the Zombie genre). I admit there are better Zombie films, but considering 90% of this movie being shot in the light (unlike most horror films besides Shock Waves) you have to give it props. I cracked up when it showed the Zombie's biting legs....you could tell they where holding raw meat on someones leg then gnawing it off, LOL.

1653051,3,B00005R24H,"This is the zombie film you get when you've already got all of the decent ones, and just need a complete zombie dvd collection.  Where does one go when you've managed to buy the whole Romero and Fulci catalog?  Well, you can get some good runners up like Burial Ground, Dead Alive, Let Sleeping Corpses Lie, Return Of The Living Dead and Zombie Holocaust, but then what?  You can stoop to getting Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things, and if you're able to still live with yourself, you can pick up this and Zombi 3(both associated with Bruno Mattei!).  This is for the hardcore zombie movie collector, no doubt about it.  That's why I got it.  I was also curious, coz for years I had the cruddy VHS copy under the title Night Of The Zombies.  In that VHS copy, I could barely see what was going on, the quality was so bad.  I basically got this just to SEE it.  I'll admit, I watch it once and awhile, but I do warn you-This is pretty bad, even by the low standards of the genre.  I know alot of Italian horror fans who disown this film.  There's no point in explaining the plot, coz it's not that important or original.  The interview with the director is pretty funny.  He says himself that he doesn't like his films!

1653052,4,B00005R24H,"This movie is really bad, but I found it to be very entertaining.  It starts off well enough in some high tech facility that looks like a nuclear power plant but isn't.
There are two guys in homemade radiation suits.  On guy finds what looks like a dead rat, but isn't.  After holding the seemingly dead rat by its tail to show his comrade, the camera cuts and a live rat is inserted.  The live rat then waists no time in inserting itself into the first guy's homemade radiation suit.  Then a blood squib explodes blood inside the suit, which is a pretty effective scene while the comrade looks on in horror.
Then the opening credits with Dawn of the Dead music happens and the scene shifts to a hostage situation.  A long haired swat team takes out a long haired enviro-terrorist group who are killing people to raise awareness of the impending zombie threat.
Then the long haired swat team is sent to New Guinea, with orders so secret, they aren't even allowed to know what they are.  They run smack into that scene from Night of the Living Dead where the little girl turns into a zombie and turns on her mother, only here, Mattei throws us for a loop by changing the sexes of the principals.  Then they run into the best made up zombie in the whole movie as well as one of the best scenes in the whole movie.  Apparently, he was a priest when he was alive.  But now he's a zombie who likes to eat people and makes no apologies for it.
Then there's a whole bunch of scenes inter cut with an actual documentary on New Guinea after which the movie takes on an Apocalypse Now feel as we come upon an abandoned mansion.
At this point, the cast starts to drop like flies as we make our way to the Hope Center where we kind of learn that the cure for world hunger is to turn people into people hungry zombies.  Then everybody dies, just like in Hamlet.
The four stars are for the entertainment value.  Its probably about one and a half to two stars for quality.",1037232000,2,1957,4.302452316076295

It was my first exposure to Bruno Mattei. And I loved every minute of it. The cheesiness alone makes it worth it. You just have to love the pure cheesiness of the scene where she goes to the New Guinea tribe. Had it not taken itself so seriously, it might have been fuunnier. But the fact it takes itself seriously and has a ""message"" makes it a great addition to any DVD collection.
 The unrated is for great gore, language and brief nudity. If you love cheesy zombie films, this is for you.",1035504000,3,643,4.185483870967742

You can call it what was happening in Italy during the zombie apocalypse of Night of the Living Dead. Its an interesting take and an explanation of sorts (non-canon, of course). It peaks at brilliants and bottoms out with some serious WTF moments. Its Italian cinema, that's what you get. The characters sadly are mostly morons who regardless of how many times they are told to shoot the head they aim for the body. Sigh... they're elite INTERPOL commandos, supposedly. It meanders for awhile. With decent writing the movie could have been awesome sadly its not. There's a bunch of odd cutscenes with animals just go with it. The Goblin soundtrack lifted straight from Dawn of the Dead gives it a good atmosphere. But overall its a so so zombie flick that is good for gore and little else.",1525219200,,960,4.619883040935672

7951676,5,B00005R24H,"After a masterful intro song by Goblin, HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD (aka: NIGHT OF THE ZOMBIES- 1980) begins in Papua New Guinea, where a worker at a chemical plant is chewed up by a re-animated rat, causing horror! Of course, a leak develops, spreading throughout the plant. Workers are turned into arm-flailing zombies, feasting upon the living like bloody pot pies! Meanwhile, elsewhere, a group of terrorists has taken hostages. A team of four commandos, led by Lt. Mike London (Robert O'Neil) is sent in to deal w/ the situation. No problem! With the terrorists neutralized and the hostages saved, it's all over! Next, the team is off for the jungles to investigate the chemical leak. Enter reporter, Lia Rousseau (Margie Newton) and her Jim Croce / Joe Walsh hybrid cameraman. They run into London and his men, after fleeing a horde of shambling zombies (aka: people w/ burnt tuna casserole on their faces). Once they realize that zombies are only susceptible to a shot to the head, the commandos turn their noggins into meat bombs! Next, in order to communicate w/ a local tribe, Lia gets naked. The tribe, busy w/ a dead comrade and disemboweling every animal in sight, barely notices. Then, after some dancing, Lia fits right in. Cannibalism is observed. Then, more dancing! Annnd, here come the zombies! They're bitin' necks and takin' names! Bye-bye village. Next, watch, as one of the commandos -he's the guy who's hat is five sizes too small, due to his enormous hair- keeps having to remind his cohorts to shoot the zombies in the head! Hundreds of rounds are wasted! See, tribesmen running in circles, representing chaos, while the UN chats, resolving nothing! Witness, the cat-in-granny's-belly sequence, along w/ a cross-dressing fashion show! Observe, hundreds more rounds going everywhere but the heads of the zombies! This, along w/ endless nature stock footage, mostly of fruit bats looking for fruit! Of course, nothing compares to our heroes' arrival at the aforementioned chemical plant, where the horrible truth is uncovered. Legions of zombies attack. Still, w/ so many wasted body shots! Finally, the tongue-tearing, eyeball-popping conclusion. A gore-filled fuster-cluck of a film, but a very entertaining one!...",1522627200,2,2237,5.114754098360656

Everyone stands and stares at the zombies as the get close and start to bit them.  Every minor character acts like an idiot or like a lunatic that's lost, at one point or another in the flick.  They have the most clich script I think I have every heard.  They couldn't find one person that could act to be in this monstrosity.  Like Ed Wood they use stock footage of Africa everywhere they can remotely get away with it, sometimes not even very remotely.
