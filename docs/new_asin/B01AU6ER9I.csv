Although the performance was filmed in 2015 and became available to the public in 2016 it was this summer that one of the PBS stations near my home aired this performance and a very great performance it was. You not only had Pavlo but he had some guests and one of those guest was Remeggio Perriera of ""The Tenors"" group who accompanied Pavlo on one song with a guitar and sang on one other. With the DVD you look at the stunning scenery of Kastoria plus also got a look at Pavlo's family. Pavlo is good with his guitar playing that I have to say there Benise and Jesse Cook-watch out. You have some competition.",1535932800,,709,4.220588235294118
