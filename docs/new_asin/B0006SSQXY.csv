2194127,5,B0006SSQXY,"This series is continuing to be very enjoyable in this format for me.  The colors, the widescreen format, the excellent sound effects and music are all very flattering to the PSP.

Story-wise, you get a very deep two part episode on this UMD, which has the main cast going separate ways right away(it's a real good laugh), has some sweet action that will get you giddy, and has some good ol tragedy strewn throughout.  What you liked before will be here as well, but since it's a two-parter on one UMD, you walk away with only one long episode essentially, feeling thirsty for more.

The same exact Title Menu is reused, which is not a bad thing, but waiting two months for another two episodes, it couldn't hurt to get a little more features.  Fortunately they've thrown in 3 times as many trailers for other anime(total of about 9).

This series continues to be extremely enjoyable, and well suited to this format, but the pace of getting two episodes every two months is getting to be aggravating.  It will take great restraint not to abort the UMD's and buy the DVD's or do both.

Let's hope they give us some more extras because seeing the same ol trailers is getting old.",1128729600,5,1177,4.545023696682464
2194128,5,B0006SSQXY,"This is the second chapter in this exciting series, as the ""semi-friendly"" trio search for the ""Samurai who smells like sunflowers."" Follow the trio as they continue their journey through early Edo-era Japan, and laugh at their sometimes funny mishaps, and gnaw on your fingernails at the extreme action that is throughout every episode.

This series is NOT TO MISS! One of the BEST Animated Series that I have ever seen!",1125446400,,421,4.929577464788732

2194130,5,B0006SSQXY,"Samurai Champloo is one of those rare, very special shows that you need only to watch once, and right away you're hooked.  Even if you're not a die-hard anime fan, have never heard of Shinichiro Watanabe, and have never seen Kill Bill, animatrix or a single episode of Cowboy Bebop.  In fact, this is how the show should be enjoyed and valued, in it own rights, difficult as it may be to separate it from the previous works of its stellar creators.  Because this, indeed, is an amazing show -- with solid and very likeable main characters, lightning-speed samurai actions, and breathtaking animation (not to mention the widescreen format).  The hip hop angle is cool, but not essential.  The show works not because it is ""hip"", but because it respects our intelligence, and feels real.

We follow the adventure of three fascinating characters in pre-modern Japan: Mugen, a wild and unruly vagrant; Jin, a reticent, highly-disciplined ronin (masterless samurai) with a dark past; and Fuu, a quick-thinking 15-year old waitress.  Having saved Mugen and Jin from wrongful execution by a corrupt official, Fuu made them promise to help her find a samurai that smells of sunflower.  The three set out on a journey that takes them all over Japan, an unlikely trio on an even more unlikely quest.  Mugen and Jin, both extremely skillful with the katana, cannot be more opposite in nature.  They're eager to battle to determine which one is the better swordsman.  But Fuu forbids them to kill each other until the samurai is found, and has her hands full trying to stop them from doing that en route. The three, however, complement each other perfectly, and as the story develops, so does the bond between them.

Their journey is not an easy one.  Although it is not the warring era, life in late 18th century Japan is harsh and often lawless.  There are plenty of fighting and slashing (especially in vol. 1), with Mugen and Jin raking up body counts everywhere they go.  The violence is consistent with the samurai theme, but makes the show unsuitable for younger viewers.  Even so, this anime is not dark or depressing; episode 7 is a sad one, but all in all the stories are a marvelous blend of suspense, human drama and offbeat humor (my favorite: Jin dressing up as a beautiful woman to infiltrate a yakuza brothel).

Interestingly as well, although the producers made a point of stating that the show bears no historical accuracy, watching it I felt transported back into the past, witnessing the opening of Japan to the West. The settings are meticulously drawn to reflect the era, spiced here and there with anachronistic modern touches (like sporty sunglasses, blonde hair and adidas-like stripes on the kimono). Eps. 5 and 6 relate to actual historical facts: the ukiyo-e picture that inspired van Gogh to paint his sunflowers, and the arrival of the Dutch East Indies ships in Japan that did take place in late 18th century. Although the stories are clearly fiction, they offer a glimpse into what might be the reason for the Japanese enamorment with van Gogh.

This anime is one of a kind (and dare we hope - the first of its kind?) It has acquired such popularity in so short time, I believe, because of the great care that went into making it, that the audience can immediately see and appreciate.  Episode 6, for instance, goes so far as using authentic Dutch dialogue. Added to that is the excellent voice cast, both Japanese and English.  I especially enjoyed Shinichiro Miki (Asato Tsuzuki in Descendants of Darkness) as the ukiyo-e artist in ep. 5.  His style of mixing seriousness and goofiness is always refreshing to watch. Unfortunately, there are only 26 episodes in the series.  Perhaps the rationale has something to do with the difficulties of sustaining high-quality production in a long-running series (such as the case with Inuyasha), that the SC producers did not want to risk.  Let's hope this is merely a creative break, and that more episodes will be produced in the not too distant future.",1120780800,19,4017,4.815138282387191
2194131,5,B0006SSQXY,"I have to respectfully disagree with the previous reviewer: whereas the first volume of Samurai Champloo was good, these four episodes are much better.  Both volumes are full of brilliant animation, unique humor and great music, but the plot thickens in episodes 5-8.

  Whereas the first four episodes were still laying the foundation for the show, these episodes begin to delve into the characters' personalities and past lives.  As in Cowboy Bebop, Watanabe accomplishes this end subtly through brief flashbacks and the characters' dialogue with people that they meet throughout their journey; by only dropping hints throughout the episodes Watanabe really draws the audience in by keeping them in suspense.

  The individual plot lines of these episodes are good, but the supporting characters are phenomenal.  Nagamitsu, a samurai that appears in episode 8, is hilarious, and his appearance alone is enough to warrant buying this DVD.  My only complaint was that the plot of episode 7 (""A Risky Racket"") was a little too similar to the Cowboy Bebop episode ""Waltz for Venus"": I expected some more original plot lines from Watanabe.

  In summary, the series in general and this DVD in particular are brilliantly animated, set to a great soundtrack, and contain well-told plot lines with well-crafted dialogue and engaging characters.  All in all, well worth the money.",1112227200,10,1373,5.238532110091743
8042774,5,B0006SSQXY,At first I didn't really like this volume but I've changed my mind. I think it was the dominant blue color of the DVD that just made this volume seem dull. Here we find and artist that tricks Fuu. An eating contest that brings a strange foreigner. A troubled guy who is a pickpocket. And a moron who tries to become famous. By the end of this volume you either love this show or might want to move on. I hope you stick around.,1473292800,,426,4.083333333333333
8042775,4,B0006SSQXY,When I first watched the Samurai Champloo series I wasn't all that impressed.  After watching it a second time in really does grow on you.  I would recommend this series to any anime fan.,1235433600,,187,4.470588235294118
8042776,4,B0006SSQXY,"Watching Samurai Champloo is, at times,  an uneven experience.

Watanabe brings his audience exactly what they expect: quality. The music is a stellar mix of traditional Japanese folk songs and hip-hop beats. The art is beautiful and the story line is engaging. The characters are interesting and fully developed by the conclusion of the series.

In certain ways Watanabe has improved on Cowboy Bebop. Samurai Champloo leaves no gaps in the lives of the characters or the motives behind their actions. Watanabe fleshes out the story line completely and evenly. The journey of Fuu, Jin, and Mugen moves steadily and the conclusion lasts three episodes; the most important segments of the show take place over more than one episode and have a much more prolonged affect. And unlike Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo effectively introduces elements of past history into its story line: the Satsuma Rebellion and the Tale of Heiki/Genji for example.

However, Samurai Champloo suffers from overflow. No anime in recent memort has provided its audience with side characters of such depth. The villians and friends they meet on their journey feel as real and as significant as Fuu, Jin, and Mugen. But there is simply too many of them and they occupy too many episodes.

Episodes such as ""Baseball Blues"", ""Cosmic Collisions"", ""Art of Altercation"", ""Beat Box Bandits"", and ""War of Words"" have too many eccentric characters and are not relevant to the story. They are single episode stories that drag down the flow of progress. A single season show shouldn't feel like it has filler episodes to reach 23 weeks of airplay. In certain cases - these side-stories provide great entertainment. My favorite episode happens to be a single episode story - ""Gamblers and Gallantry."" But more often than not, the audience may feel like the series is dragging on with extra filler adventures that affect neither the three main characters or the audience to any great degree.

Despite this weakness, I do highly recommend the show. Watanabe does not let his creativity become a distraction nor does he let his refreshing take on the ""hip-hop samurai"" become a gimmick. Watanabe nails all the core elements of story telling and animation on the head. Just be prepared to watch some filler before you get to the meat.

As a sidenote-do not pass up ""Misguided Miscreants"" and ""Elegy of Entrapment."" They are the highlights of Watanabe's work in any show.",1147219200,,2429,5.027363184079602

8042778,5,B0006SSQXY,"If you're even showing an interest to vol. 2 then you most likely own or have seen vol. 1. Even then I recommend this one as much as any of them, since you gotta watch the whole series in order to find out what happens in the end. Anyways, vol. 2 offers the same fun antics the 1st vol. did, BUT unfortunately when compared to vol. 1 you'll see that there are a whole lot less sword fights and basically no violence at all. Any sword fighting that actually occur usually doesn't last long enough to be considered a ""fight"". But this DVD makes up for that with plenty more comical antics than the 1st vol. So enjoy it, I know I did.",1142899200,,631,4.138211382113822
8042779,5,B0006SSQXY,"It's the same formula of hip edgy moods and attitudes that you felt in BEBOP.  Hip hop replaces jazz as the underlying tempo of the show, and characters play great off of each other.  Am saving up to purchase the rest of the series.",1142812800,,232,4.25
8042780,3,B0006SSQXY,"After catching a few episodes on Cartoon Network's 'Adult Swim', I finally decided to invest money and time in this series. While watching the first DVD in the series, I caught myself grinning and marvelling at the great characterization, perfect animation, and ambiance put forth for my enjoyment. I allowed myself to hope that this series was going to hold my attention and devotion for a while. So, it was with such high hopes and expectations that I began watching the second DVD in the series.

Sadly, either my expectations where too high or the delivery fell very flat. The most obvious deficiency to me is the abrupt loss of fine animation. The characters become so poorly drawn, that they look different from scene to scene and are completely flat, devoid of any shading implied depth. This transition happens around the third episode and becomes undeniably distracting by the fourth episode. Some moments are so harsh to watch, I felt like I was watching a storyboard minus ""inbetweener"" frame drawings. Unacceptable after the fantastic work of disk 1. Moreover, the plots and voice acting of the English dub also suffer equally...in the end, I had to stop watching as the glow I felt after watching the first disk was quickly being snuffed out frame by horrible frame.

I hate to say it, but I ended up just skipping through each vingette of the episodes and dared to hope for a return of quality in the third disk (which arrived today). Well, I'm sorry to report, it got even worse. My wife, an admitted anime neophite, couldn't understand why I was just skipping through the disk. It didn't take long for me to explain as all I had to do was compare disk two and three with the first disk in the series...it was that obvious.

It's possible others will not be put off by the quality issues, focusing on the ongoing story line, but I'm done. I should have just been patient and saved my money by waiting for these disks to come to me through Netflix. Look for my copies of disk two and three on eBay very soon. The first disk I'll keep...you'll have to get your own.

Best regards,

Michael",1137715200,2,2102,4.624664879356568
8042781,5,B0006SSQXY,"samurai champloo volume one left many of us in the dust with it's greatness and artistic genious. volume two is no different. i am very pleased with this second installment and hope this traditon of greatness carries on through the rest of the upcoming volumes. if you are a fan of this show, and liked the first dvd, i reccommend this one as well. i have rated the four new episodes on this dvd on a ten star scale. the ratings are below with a brief discription.

episode five: artistic anarchy- jin, mugen and fuu need to cross a river using a ferry. one problem: they havn't any ferry money! as fuu is tricked into being sold as a prostitute, mugen goes around robbing a member of the yakuza and leads to some hilarious scenes. jin tries to get ferry money by playing against an old man in a high-stakes game of what i think is japanese chess. will our heroes make enough money to use the ferry? watch and find out.

i rate this hilarious, yet action-packed episode a 10/10

episode six: stranger searching-our heroes finally reach Edo. starving, they quickly find an all-you-can-eat buffet that claims to be free. but when our heroes find out it costs an item, such as jin's swords, winning becomes a priority. when fuu and mugen force jin to offer his katana's, some hilarious dialogue insues. i don't want to say anymore so as not to spoil the suprizes. this episode has been hilarious.

funny, mysterious and obnoxious, i rate this episode a 10/10, even though there is little action in this episode.

episode seven: a risky racket- our heroes encounter a pick-pocket and go after him in an attempt to retrive their stolen cash. but when fuu becomes attatched to the boy, the story takes on a different, and heart-wrenching, turn in plot.

not much action, but a lot of emotion and some humor, i rate this episode an 8/10

episode eight: the art of altercation- this is by far my favorite episode on this volume, and the most funny out of both.

jin mugen and fuu are out of money (again.) jin pawns his glasses in order to make some dough. at the same time, a dull-witted man by the name of nagometsu is afater jin to make a name for himself. this episode reveals some hilarious moments, and a suprizing fact about jin's shady past.

i rate this episode 10/10, though i think it deserves infinite stars.

well, thats my review for this volume. check out my next if you want more ratings for samurai champloo. my spelling and grammer is very correct, though i do not capitalize most of my sentences and titles, so you'll be able to read them. honestly, i wish some people would at least give thier reviews some effort, so they are legible enough to understand fully. i'm not the greatest, but at least i articulate my words well enough for them to be understandable.

8042782,4,B0006SSQXY,"Okay, so this is above-average anime. It's not insulting or infantile - so what's not to love?

But I have to say that it feels a little flat after Bebop.  And it's *soooo* full of hip-hop post-modern self-referential riffs - these little excursions, while stimulating in a MTV /cable-network-identity-package kind of way, actually detract from the storytelling and pull me out of the characters and situations.

The trio of characters here has nothing like the chemistry of the tripod of Spike, Jet and Faye. Although we go through a similar multi-episodic dribble of information of their pasts, the two male leads, supposedly such opposites, feel cut from the same cloth, while the pubescent Fuu is unable to muster the strong counterpoint that helped make Faye so memorable.

Perhaps the self-consciousness comes purely from riding in Cowboy Bebop's wake.  Watanabe's trying hard not to repeat himself, and that's honorable, right?

What's not to love?  Someone's making tight, reasonably mature anime with the highest of production values.  I just wish I liked it more.",1133395200,2,1073,5.1976744186046515
8042783,5,B0006SSQXY,"I really appreciate this anime.  It has a bazillion great moments and makes me fall out of my seat laughing quite often.  It has a great story and the characters and memorable.  For some reason, I can't help but think that it doesn't compare to Cowboy Bebop.  I think there is something to Samurai Champloo that those who aren't so familiar with old japanese culture and history will miss.  I truly think that a japanese native will get more out of this series than the typical american watcher.

But don't let this stop you from getting the series... it's still worth watching by a great measure!",1129420800,,597,4.584905660377358
