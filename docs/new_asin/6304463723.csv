884528,5,6304463723,"This is a documentary I saw on TCM, loved it and had to have it.  It chronicles the life of legendary director William Wellman who is one of my idols and whose films dominated Hollywood for over 50 years beginning with one of his earliest films, ""Wings,"" that was the first film to win the Best Picture Oscar.  I got it because of my personal interest in Wellman but given the fact that his career pretty much covered most of the history of Hollywood, this film also serves as a pretty good short course in film history and appreciation.",1357516800,4,537,4.414141414141414

7872022,5,6304463723,"This is a wonderful documentary on a prolific and extremely talented filmmaker.  It's also a tasteful tribute from a loving son to his famous father.  It's really two documentaries in one, and writer/producer William Wellman Jr. guides the viewer effortlessly back and forth between the two. The documentary features interviews with cast and crew who worked with the Academy Award winner, including such luminaries as Robert Redford, Clint Eastwood, and Sidney Poitier.  Director Martin Scorsese also appears, offering a thoughtful assessment of the skill and patience required to stage the complex aerial battles in 1927's Wings - decades before the advent of computers.  Alec Baldwin narrates beautifully throughout.

Even those unfamiliar with Mr. Wellman Sr.'s remarkable and diverse film oeuvre will appreciate this documentary and learn a great deal about the movie business.",1416268800,,881,5.593984962406015
7872023,5,6304463723,"These days, as I have mentioned in the recent past, Im getting immersed more and more into silent movies. Im just fascinated by how all the filmmakers of the silent era developed the industry and how it evolved. So, it was a blessing to watch the wonderful Wild Bill, Hollywood Maverick - the Life and Times of William A. Wellman. And what a fabulous life it was, all fantastically documented in this delightful film.

Well-directed by Todd Robinson, the movie goes through Wellmans life from beginning to end, starting with his birth on February 29, 1896, in Massachusetts, and how he spent his early years as a decorated fighter pilot during World War I. It was there that he got nicknamed Wild Bill. Some time later, famous actor Douglas Fairbanks, impressed by Wellmans talents, got him an acting job in The Knickerbocker Buckaroo, but Bill realized that he did not liked acting. He then moved to being a mailman at the Goldwyn Studio, then assistant director, and, finally, director. After helming some silent films, Bill directed Wings (1927), which cost 2 million dollars to make, and was very successful. This movie established him in Hollywood, but, due to his temper and antipathy for the studio, he was banned to attend the premiere of the film, as well as the first academy award ceremony, in which Wings won the best picture Oscar. Despite his disdain for the studio system, Wellman directed some of the best movies in Hollywood history, such as The Public Enemy (1931), A Star is Born (1937), Nothing Sacred (1939), Beau Geste (1939), The Ox-Bow Incident (1943), and many more. He also made five films with John Wayne, and, in a 35- year career, his films received 32 academy award nominations  4 for Best Picture and 3 for Best Director. He also was recipient of the DW Griffith Award for Lifetime Achievement. The documentary includes interviews with some of the people associated with Wellman at one time or another, such as Robert Stack, Robert Redford, Nancy Reagan, Buddy Rogers, Sydney Poitier, William Wellman Jr., Clint Eastwood, Tom Laughlin, Robert Wise, and more.

William Wellman was a rare breed of director, and he was able to survive and thrive in Hollywood, despite his strong character, and not being part of the towns politics or social scene. He was described as a man of strong convictions, deep loyalties, arrogant, with distaste for authority, honest, and with an explosive temper. In fact, Wellman, as well as Raoul Walsh and John Ford were known as the tough directors. In the end, he got tired of Hollywood, just saying, Im not retiring; Im quitting. Furthermore, in his deathbed, he told his son, Bill, don't feel sorry for me  I have lived the life of a 100 men.  This is a fellow that I definitely would have liked to have met. Wild Bill, Hollywood Maverick is a true pleasure and a glorious look to a grandiose career. (USA, 1996, color & B/W, 93 min)

7872024,2,6304463723,"Wild Bill does not chronicle Hickok or even Lumbergh, rather it is the amazing, hard to believe life of one of Hollywood's underrated directors, featuring contributions from the 1% of Hollywood elite actors and directors. Technically it is nothing special and includes nothing valuable in the bonus material area, but the disc serves as a valuable history lesson about one of the more noteworthy moviemakers around when films began, and that is worth the time to view in and of itself.",1391817600,,485,5.0
7872025,5,6304463723,"This came as a surprise to me.  I found out about this video by watching ""NIGHT OF THE HUNTER"" (the black & white movie Wild Bill shot for Warner Bros with Robert Mitchum, released in 1955) in 'cinemascope and color'.  On the ""Night"" DVD, as a bonus, there were interviews with people that made the movie and knew of Wellman.  His son Bill Wellman, Jr. described this video as having been assembled about his father's life.  So I searched for it and found that it was available, and sent for it!
The visuals used in telling of his bio in film are wonderful to see.  It is not a waste of time.  The story of the making of ""Lafayette Escadrille"", with Tab Hunter, is ironic, in that he killed off all the 'love-making-stars' as the finale of the movie, only to have to bring everybody back together several months later, having to re-shoot the ending with everyone living happily-ever-after (according to Jack Warner's demand) that pissed off Welmann.  Oh Hollywood endings!",1390435200,,972,4.649122807017544
7872026,4,6304463723,"One of cinema's ""forgotten"" mavericks, William A. Wellman gets  loving treatment by Todd Robinson in this very good documentary about this fine director.  Not necessarily a ""great director"", ""Wild Bill"" helmed some 76 films and many of them remain today as near-classics.  Titles like ""Wings"",  ""The Public Enemy"",  ""A Star is Born"" (1937, the best version), ""Nothing Sacred"", ""Beau Geste"", ""The Ox-Bow Incident"", ""The Story of G.I. Joe"", ""Battleground""  deserve repeated viewings.  Would like to see ""Wild Boys of the Road"" (1933) which co-starred his wife Dorothy Coonan.  This looked like a little gem, so hopefully one day I will get the chance to see it.  Found it interesting,  discussion of certain aspects of Wellman""s directing style such as action happening out of camera range and faces being obscured during important dialog scenes.  Lots of talking heads in this documentary but all interesting.  Be aware that this is very complimentary (executive producer and creator was Bill Jr., who appearance wise is a spitting image of his dad) , so don't  expect anything too negative about Wellman or his films.  Mr. Wellman led a very colorful life and his early days growing up in Brookline, Mass., and his adventures with the Lafayette Escadrille in the First World War is also well documented.  Read and enjoyed Wellman's autobiography ""A Short Time For Insanity"" back in 1974.  Well worth hunting film book shops to get a copy.  You won't be disappointed!",1389571200,,1466,5.092436974789916
