2638581,4,B000HKIIO8,"Not a bad movie. Interesting enough to watch with the wife but not gory enough to get my full attention until of course the great Geenie appears. Barbara Eden was, when this movie was made still absolutely GORGEOUS. Great genes in that beautiful woman and she has learned to act a bit too. The movie itself was of course predictible but again this is a good movie to watch with the wifey.",1365724800,3,388,4.402777777777778
2638582,4,B000HKIIO8,"Not as good as Vision of Murder.  Daughter was played by another girl.  I did like
it and I am glad that I have it.  Received in a timely manner and in excellent shape.",1310774400,,168,3.8823529411764706
2638583,1,B000HKIIO8,This movie was a sequel of the 1993 TV Movie Barbara Eden starred in. She usually does good acting though the script they gave her was not good. She should have said No. The script was written poorly. The first movie for TV was good. Though this movie is awful. Her character's daughter was 16 in this movie when in the previous movie a year earlier she was only 12. They never should have done this movie. This was the last TV movie she did for NBC TV and it is because this movie is so bad.,1278460800,,492,4.082474226804123
2638584,4,B000HKIIO8,"As a fan of Barbara Eden over the years I did enjoy her TV movie adventure.  Some of the mystery plot is a bit dated and transparent. It is not Sherlock Holmes, and definitely not a CSI but still worthy of a nice bowl of popcorn with the family.  If you enjoy the TV mystery of this period you will enjoy this one.  Barbara does a fine job.",1254096000,,340,3.9705882352941178

2638587,3,B000HKIIO8,"I enjoyed this movie. It was suspenseful but the fact that she could ""see"" what was going to happen in these visions was a bit unrealistic.",1475366400,,139,4.384615384615385

2638589,5,B000HKIIO8,I have watched this movie a few times and still enjoy watching it. It keeps you guessing and gives you a few possibilities as to who the guilty party is.

However, this story was definitely a crash and burn and barely kept my interest I couldn't wait for it to be over!  I only gave it to stars because Barbara still did an excellent job with the lousy plot and her associates also did their best Not worth the money.",1426982400,,333,4.285714285714286

2638612,2,B000HKIIO8,"I like Barbara Eden and I adore Michael Nouri, so I gave this one a try. It always stayed at an even keel, very little in the way of twists and turns or suspense.  It just seemed to drone on. After watching about 2/3s of it, I gave up.  I'd take a pass on this one, folks.",1412294400,,272,3.754385964912281

2638619,3,B000HKIIO8,I wrote the review before what happened to it?  i said this story was ok but she is a cop and she is alone in the house.  She should make the house more secure and watch out for Dr Bellows as he can always come in any way he wants to.  her daughter in the movie did all the heroic work.,1403308800,,286,3.6557377049180326

I wanted to see how Barbara Eden would do in a lead role and she did well.",1396828800,,117,3.72

2638625,5,B000HKIIO8,The movie was excellent. Kept you on the edge of your seat and trying to figure out what would happen next. Barbara Eden played the character well and was convincing. Supporting cast A one. Had to purchase Visions Of Murder after watching this movie.,1392336000,,250,4.704545454545454
2638626,3,B000HKIIO8,Not a bad B movie. Kind of like Lifetime Movie. It has practical scenes and written for general drama. Hope this helps.,1391644800,,119,4.454545454545454
2638627,3,B000HKIIO8,A predictable tale that starts off slow and is difficult to catch all the plot points until well into the story.  If it weren't for Barbara's screen charisma it would be a total bust.  That being said it does have one great scene... you'll need to watch to find what it is.,1388793600,,273,4.230769230769231
2638628,4,B000HKIIO8,I really enjoyed this movie. What is funny is Barbra plays a complete different roll as she did as I Dream of Jeanie. Great actress.,1386979200,,132,4.32

2638630,4,B000HKIIO8,"Dr. Jesse Newman (Barbara Eden- VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, THE WOMAN HUNTER) is a psychologist who receives ""psychic flashes"". After a cop (Michael Nouri) loses his partner to a ruthless serial murderer, he becomes Dr. Newman's patient. She begins having visions of the incident, apparently seeing through the eyes of the victim. She starts sleuthing around on her own, finding clues that help to flesh out what happened. Jesse soon sees that things just might be a bit more complicated -and far more dangerous- than they seem. As she pieces the puzzle together, it's increasingly clear that something just isn't right. VISIONS OF TERROR is an above average made-for-TV mystery / thriller that is a great showcase for Ms. Eden's dramatic skills. Especially recommended to those who only know her from I DREAM OF JEANIE...",1382140800,8,827,5.0

Newman, who has some psychic abilities, gets involved in the investigation of the death of a San Francisco cop, when she is brought in to counsel the dead man's partner (Michael Nouri).

There are a number of familiar themes, as Jesse has flashes of insight, and begins to take a more active role, while also trying to be a good mother to her daughter Kimberly (Missy Crider).  Dependable Barbara Eden, gives a good performance, and the story stays fairly grounded, until the very end, when Newman and her daughter are threatened.  The lack of action or violence may make Eyes of a Stranger a little dull for some, but it's a decent watch while available on Prime.  Rating: 2.5 stars.",1381795200,6,1303,7.068322981366459

2638633,3,B000HKIIO8,Barbara Eden's acting seemed a 'walk-through' type. Other actors & actresses out did her. I wouldn't waste my time  is my recommendation.,1374019200,2,137,5.2272727272727275
