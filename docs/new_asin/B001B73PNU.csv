3484351,5,B001B73PNU,"warren millers 2007 relese is one of the greatest ski films that have come out of warren millers 58 year history. featuring athletes such as jon olfson, shean pettit, and many more there are great atributes to this film and there are segments that will enjoy everyone.",1229299200,,268,4.723404255319149
3484352,4,B001B73PNU,"I have enjoyed watching Miller films for years. Going back to when he did the narration in person. I think the camera work is fantastic, the skiers are exceptional and the fact that there is some groomed skiing is super. The only drawback to his films of late is the music. I like hard driving rock, but there is a big difference between today's music and the Doobie Brothers or Bob Seger of yesteryear. Each to their own choosing. If you don't see this film this year, you'll be one year older when you do. Keep up the great entertainment Warren.",1227657600,,547,4.425742574257426

3484354,3,B001B73PNU,"Great movie, but if you are buying the blu ray, be aware that 40% of the movie is shot in standard definition, very disappointed as this is the only reason i bought it was for high definition action.

3484356,5,B001B73PNU,"We all know that the Miller flicks went downhill once he wasn't involved, but this time around that is completely false!

Johnny hits the narration spot on, the scenes highlight the fun, extreme, serious, and wacky sides of the spot right on, and the music... wow... the music... just wait until the closing montage.

Great flick!",1220745600,5,330,4.875

8282047,5,B001B73PNU,"This is by far my favorite movie (of all films in history). BUY IT!!!!!! great soundtrack, and the grand finally made me all emotional. Portrays  the sport in an amazing way. This movie is an emotional and spiritual journey for me. Its not winter until you've seen warren millers playground. I also loved Higher Ground, really graet, my second favorit movie of all time. here is the link:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warren-Miller-s-Higher-Ground/dp/B000GW8UA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warren Miller's Higher Ground</a>",1306195200,,562,6.594594594594595
8282048,5,B001B73PNU,"After purchasing Playground, I now own ten or more of the Warren Miller ski movies in both VCR and DVD. I have been a fan of Warren Miller for years and knew of him when I lived in Idaho and he was in Sun Valley beginning his career. The movies have migrated into some real extreme skiing and Playground is a good example of this. The movie is narrated by Jonny Moseley who does a great job of explaining the ski sites and the skiers in the movie. There is a lot of footage from Alaska which highlights the vastness of this state. The interview with Body Miller is interesting as he further explains his passion for ski racing and how his focused attitude sometimes gets him in trouble with the sports and other international media. This movie is a must for any ski movie library.",1268265600,,780,4.3493150684931505
8282049,1,B001B73PNU,"I have watched many Warren Miller movies.  Some are good, some are average.  They are generally good motivation, so except for this one, yea, I recommend them.  This is clearly the worst I have viewed so far.  I found myself frequently scanning ahead to find skiing.  Yea, really.  It did not work to get me ready for the upcoming season.",1259539200,,338,4.55
8282050,5,B001B73PNU,Great sequences of winter fun. (and foolery?) Keep bringing the great films you've always made Warren (and crew)!!,1253145600,,114,5.388888888888889
8282051,4,B001B73PNU,"Loved all the wonderful skiing - per Warren's typical, it's awesome. but I sure miss the Warren Miller narative that he used to do.",1236902400,3,131,4.5
8282052,3,B001B73PNU,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Playground/dp/B001B73PNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Playground</a>&nbsp;is kind of a high water mark for Warren Miller documentaries.  Several segments features crisp camera work that seems improved.  All of the locations are amazing, and it's definitely something I plan to watch again. We have Dubai, Sweden, and Aspen among the many locations.  But if you're looking for the maximum amount of actual skiing and snowboarding footage, most of his previous movies have more.

This documentary represents a significant departure from his successful formula.  All of the same elements are here.  We get great ski and snowboard footage collected by a common theme.  We also have some comedic moments and wipe-out footage.  And of course there are plenty of interviews with the athletes.

The difference really is mostly in the ratio of those elements.  In the past the interview and introductory clips for each location were mostly quick segments that were lightly peppered into large amounts of actual riding footage featuring crazy vertical drops and long runs.  Here, the interviews feel like they are much longer than in the past.

And the portions describing the various locations are also much longer, or at least they seem that way.  That in and of itself could be forgiven.  After all the actual theme of this video seems to center around premium locations, so describing them a little bit more is probably to be expected.

Interestingly enough, some of the best footage is the Utah clips.  Utah has definitely been featured in previous Warren Miller videos, but here we get beautiful shots of tons of power flying up into the riders' faces.  It's almost like a Utah tourism video.  Perhaps those clips were shot in HD, since some of those shots seemed much crisper than some of the other footage.  Whatever the reason, there is still some great footage here.  I just wish there was much more.

One of the cuter segments focuses on a group of young kids as they free-ride and tear up a terrain park.  Some of those kids are actually pretty impressive.

As in all Warren Miller videos, this is ski entertainment and not meant to be used for instruction.  The soundtrack is good and used very effectively with the clips.  But with some of the interview sections, it's almost used too well.  It's hard not to notice the prolonged bio segments when it takes several songs to finish them.

If you love to learn about the personal lives of your favorite skiers and snowboarders, those extended interviews will be welcome interludes.  If you are looking for the maximum amount of footage, you may want to check out one of his other videos.

Enjoy.",1231113600,3,2715,5.1068181818181815
