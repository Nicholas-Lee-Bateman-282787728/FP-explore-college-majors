8136078,5,B000H308OS,Brilliant. Amazing gets for interviews. Intimate and insightful documentary of an essential figure and it's political context.,1521763200,,126,6.470588235294118
8136079,3,B000H308OS,"I gave this one three because the film maker's effort to get to the heart of our current international situation deserves respect.  This documentary includes some intense interviews and a lot of personal opinion.  That is why I couldn't give it 5 stars.  She does a great job with every aspect of this film except for being impartial.  The best documentaries ,especially in this political climate, need to present the facts in a way that leaves the viewer with the room to make their own opinions.  Pointing fingers at this country or that or this Intelligence agency or that regime at this point is redundant. They are all corrupt.  All problems we are facing now as a species boil down to greed.  Tigers kill only what they need, no more, sometimes less.  We kill and consume and take more than we need.  This is why we face what we do at this moment.  I elect Chomsky to the Global Guides to the Good Future.  Listen to that man. Check this one out just for his interview if nothing else.",1250294400,5,991,4.4804469273743015
8136080,3,B000H308OS,"Good film if your looking for information about Iraq and Afghanistan.

It starts around 79 to now, but there is early stuff the United States

was involed way be for that, so also check out ""Why We Fight"".",1171152000,3,205,4.368421052631579
8136081,5,B000H308OS,"The film will open your eyes about the USA's foreign policy. Will give you a better perspective to understand just how much the hatred towards America was influenced by the US Government's action since WWII in the Middle East.  The documentary featuring interviews by former CIA director Stansfield Turner, among others who will give insights, that you may not have though of before.  The documentary is well done, but it is a bit short: only runs 63 minutes, as it questions simple facts that all Americans should know about their own ""Democracy"" and Government fear mongering, which is used to stir away the general public from the obvious facts, which are clear when one opens their eyes, ears and mind about the reality of our times. This DVD should be viewed and owned by all truth seekers. No wonder it won 10International film awards.",1162080000,11,841,4.833333333333333
