 I am a fan of Mandy Moore (she does the voice of Sheriff Callie) so it was interesting listening to her western accent. My daughter is only 1.5, but she enjoyed watching an episode which was long enough for me to fix dinner. Anything that buys me a few minutes to accomplish something is a hit in my house!",1447545600,10,721,4.202898550724638

7366005,3,B013IPO1JY,"We love Sheriff Callie in our house and was happy to see a few episodes on DVD.  We have watched the video at least 10 times in the past few days and my complaint is not about the cartoon, but the previews leading up to the cartoon.  It asks you to select main menu or fast play, but if you do not get to it or pass that screen you are stuck either watching or skipping over what feels like 15 Disney movie previews. I have found it easier to completely restart the DVD than the skip/fast forward as my little one is screaming by the time I can select episodes.  Love Callie, but come on Disney these are small children that just want to see their show. We have a pretty large Paw Patrol collection as well; those DVDs are one coming soon screen with a picture of their new DVD releases and onto the show.",1500422400,3,805,4.114649681528663

There are so many little kid shows that are so annoying but I don't mind her watching this one. I love all the lessons that are slipped into the episodes, like working hard, being kind, telling the truth, saying I'm sorry, etc. The songs are catchy and Sheriff Callie is voiced by Mandy Moore so they actually sound good too!

Same great quality as you would see on the Disney Jr station. Ours came with a cardboard scene and some of the characters to play sort of a puppet show.
