8725379,5,B0124KY4PK,"First of all, the review stating that this is the worst movie to come out of Hollywood is clearly inaccurate. This movie was done independently, and likely had no part of Hollywood. The skill levels of the actors clearly varies, and the effects are no doubt low budget. What is most striking is the story telling, as you  get deeper and deeper into this movie the subtle points become more and more clear. I feel profoundly changed after having seen this film, and would highly recommend it to everyone.",1452556800,3,503,4.651685393258427

This movie Half Breed is inspiringly awful. Definitely hands down the absolute worst movie I've watched in 2015. This will go down as possibly being the worst movie in the history of Hollywood.

Buddy Hutchins, Clinger, Creeps, Fester, The Gallows, Knock Knock, Massage Parlor of Death, Tag, Unfriended are the worst movies of the year but at least Clinger, Knock Knock and Tag with McLovin are fun bad. But Half Breed is head and shoulders worst of the year and then some. Classic movie that will go down in infamy.

Worst sound, worst effects, worst acting worst script and worst everything. The aspect ratio is jacked up as one reviewer pointed out. This had to be shot in the 1990's and just edited and put out today for suckers like me to buy.

I highly recommend buying this immediately. Get fat girl wasted and enjoy this mess of a movie. Plus I swear they are all taking this as serious as cancer. There is no metaness going in with the Half Wit I mean Half Breed crew. There is no self awareness. I'm in love with this movie. My 2 year old son Huddy J. and 10 month old Edison could seriously make a better movie than this.

BUY THIS NOW. What a hot mess that I couldn't take my eyeballs off of and watched the whole thing with my jaw on the floor.",1450051200,,1392,4.342307692307692
8725381,4,B0124KY4PK,"I'll agree that the cover is misleading but the movie inside is a great piece of indie work for an up and coming indie company. I checked into wild boar films and this is their first movie. Not a big budget, Hollywood blockbuster or even large indie flick but they put good effort into the script and the story is biblical in nature with a military spin, a combo that surprisingly works. Love the scenery! It's an intriguing script, not a lot of long boring dialogue, just action. The acting varies, you can tell some people have more experience than others, but the villain plays cold-hearted killer well. If you're looking for a big studio production, this won't be for you, but if you appreciate a unique indie flick, check this movie out.",1449619200,2,742,4.586466165413534
8725382,2,B0124KY4PK,"The premise sounded very interesting to me. I am a fan of the Coast to Coast radio show and I am always excited when a movie is released that covers one of their topics, even if the movie is purely fictitious and inaccurate. As well the DVD cover art is well done, so I thought Id give it a try. I was very disappointed to find this was someones summer project and not a professional independent film companys release.
The video resolution on the DVD was so low that the picture only filled a small square in the center of my TV, not the normal 4:3 ratio picture.  The picture quality is that of a low grade digital camera. But that isn't the worst part
The sound must have been recorded using the cameras onboard mike.  Some dialog was so faint it could not be heard. People close to the camera were loud. Other sounds were dubbed in at extremely high volume. The dialog was some of the worst I have heard.
The actors were all adults but the movie looks like a high school project. I have seen much better acting in the few high school plays I have witnessed. I would venture a guess that this was created by a group from a small church. They provide some biblical texts in the beginning that back up the context of the story.
I watched it all of the way through because it seemed like the people involved must of thought highly of the content. It was intriguing to see where they were going with the story, and it is fairly short. Oh, and that cover art I mentioned  there is nothing close to that imagery in the movie.
Unless you know one of the people that made this, I don't know why you would waste your time. I hope the proceeds from sales of this movie go to a good cause.",1449360000,3,1680,4.211180124223603
