8377991,5,B002QW7AZI,I bought this for my son and he loves it.  He said it has better information in it than many of his other survival videos he has.  Ron Hood teaches you how to make the things you need rather than just saying you need this and just using it.  He is looking for more of them.,1357516800,7,273,3.8392857142857144
