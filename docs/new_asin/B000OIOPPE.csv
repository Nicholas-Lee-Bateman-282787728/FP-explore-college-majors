2796435,5,B000OIOPPE,"When it comes to military films, I am very cautious about evaluations and very much a stickler for accuracy, especially as a History Professor, and having spent 25 years in the military.  This is a superior coverage of the infamous Battle of Thermopylae, in that it is not encumbered with unrelated romances, political statements, or outright falsehoods.

This film reveals many aspects of Thermopylae, and adjacent battles, that those who are not students of war may not have been aware of.  The film covers the backgrounds of both sets of combatants, the overall strategies, and the outcomes in understandable detail, and makes a valuable point of demonstrating the long-lived results of the battle itself, and on current governments and societies.

The History Channel has done a great service with this film, for those among us who do want to learn.",1185840000,21,853,5.071428571428571
2796436,5,B000OIOPPE,"Hats off to the makers of this documentary. Nothing beats true life; no fiction, no fantasy, no wild imaginings. Anyone with even the barest interest in history will apreciate this story of courage, heroism, betrayal, the real story behind the clash of the Spartans and the Persians at Thermoylae. Docudrama re-enactments blend seamlessly with historians talking about things like weapons and tactics; what it meant to be a Spartan or an Athenian when Greece was a collection of warring city-states. Maps show the real perspectives.
Who cares about how old Leonidas or Xerxes were? Chances are that with these ongoing slug-fests they didn't live that long anyway. I had considered going to see the movie but I skipped it when I saw this on the History Channel. It's probably the best documentary they've ever produced.
Look and learn. History does not get much more enthralling than this. Absolutely superb.",1185494400,11,907,5.093959731543624

2796438,5,B000OIOPPE,"The History Channel has presented a mixed of bad and good documentaries, but the ""Last Stand of the 300"" is definitely one of the best that they've ever produced! I wholeheartedly agree with previous reviewers that this is an excellent and well-researched documentary about the Battle of Thermopylae--one of history's most famous last stands of all-time.

The overall presentation of this epic battle is superb. Great visuals, music, dramatic reenactments, and knowledgeable scholars provide a very enlightening and fascinating account of the events preceding and following the 3-day battle at Thermopylae. The battle itself is examined and analyzed in meticulous detail--military tactics and strategies discussed from both sides of the war (land and sea).

As reviewer, Raffaele Vardavas mentioned, this documentary does resemble a little like the movie ""300,"" which gives it a more appealing and cinematic look. The fighting sequences--especially during the last stand--are wonderfully depicted.

The performance of the 300 Spartans--and approximately 700 Thespian soldiers and unremembered 900 Helots (Spartan slaves)--has been hailed as an outstanding example of courage against insurmountable odds. Among the Greeks, the Spartan defenders were the 'bravest of the brave' and their enormous sacrifice helped saved the future of Greece and unknowningly ""altered the course of Western civilization."" As one of the world's greatest and most symbolic events in history, this DVD is a must-have for all!

(Note: I have the PBS DVD of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Spartans/dp/B000BITU34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Spartans</a>, and also think this one is NOT as exciting to watch. Instead, the PBS presentation feels like a tedious 3-hour lecture in a history class. ""Last Stand...300"" is way better!!! Don't hesitate to buy).",1180051200,72,1878,5.996268656716418
2796439,5,B000OIOPPE,"Fantastic DVD on Thermopylae and Spartan history. Very well researched and presented. This is the ONLY DVD I have ever seen (using real people) that actually have them keep the phalanx formation. They mention the Spartan agoge and delve quit deeply into the agoge system and Spartan way of life. This is an excellent summarie of Spartan life style. It also covers the Persian side and tells us how the amazing Persian invasion came about, how the crossed the hellespont, how Xerxes was raised, etc. it also addresses all the other city states and battle tactics and takes you through to the conclusion of the battle and the ultimate conclusion of the Greek/Persian wars. (something that my Greek history teacher failed to do :() It also breifly goes over marathon which is nice. The DVD is fun and entertaining. Well worth the buy.",1179705600,48,831,4.818181818181818
2796440,5,B000OIOPPE,"I watched this the very first time a few months ago, and then again over the weekend.  It only got better.  This is the REAL story told historians about the battle at Thermopylae.  Now I want to see Hollywood's version ""300"" now that they've made it into a blockbuster.  I hope they stick to the facts and don't make this great moment in history a joke. Regardless, I'm buying the history's channel DVD. It was excelelnt",1179705600,9,420,4.4868421052631575
2796441,5,B000OIOPPE,"They showed this documentary on the History channel to accompany the release of the movie 300.

In contrast to the movie 300 (which was ok -see my review) this documentary is excellent. It is really a movie-like documentary with a lot of action.

Graphically it resembles a little the movie 300 since it uses a lot of computer graphics and non-realistic red looking skies. However, here Persians really look like Persians.

The content is excellent. Although I have read about the battle of Thermopylae from many different sources, I learned about things I did not know before and gained a more detail knowledge. However, like in the movie 300 here again Leonidas seems to be much younger than he really was by 480BC.

What I particularly liked was that the documentary focused both on the land battle of the Spartans and sea battle of the Athenian fleet. This really showed how brilliant and well coordinated the Allied Greek strategy was. Most other sources just focus on the land battle and pay minor attention to what happened in the flanking sea. The mastermind Themistocles is well represented and a decent length of the documentary is dedicated to him.

The Spartans and their society are accurately represented. They were not fighting for a new era of freedom which was at the time being brought forward by Athenian democracy. They were fighting to preserve their own, non-free un-democratic system and were hostile to the spread of democracy to other Greek city states. However, their last stand was not solely to seek ""a beautiful death"" but instead to cover the retreat of their fellow allied soldiers. Maybe, also to give an example from which the allied Greeks would stay united against the Persians for the sake of their sacrifice.

The sound tracks that accompany the scenes are excellent. However, they could have used them more often and they could have raised the volume a little too.

I enjoyed watching this documentary even more than the other two excellent documentaries on the Spartans (one from the History channel and the other by PBS).

Highly - I repeat highly recommended - to people interested in ancient history and battle strategies and warfare.",1175212800,158,2176,4.926229508196721

So, this 90 minute documentary details the battle at Thermopylae, but it also discusses the players (Spartans and Persians). What precipitated the battle, the battle strategy and environment, who were the Spartans and how did they lead the fight, who were the Persians, the city states of Greece, the aftermath and the effect on the world thereafter--all of this, plus more, is admirably presented in this 90 minutes.

2796515,5,B000OIOPPE,"I had seen this on the History Channel before I purchased the video. This is an excellent production of arguably the most famous Last Stand battle in history. The production is factual where the cinema release was more fictionalized. I disagree with one review, in that this is not a cartoon. There is live action but this is not supposed to be a movie. The back story on all of the players is just as important, maybe more important, than the battle itself.",1386201600,,458,4.530120481927711

This true version of the Battle of Thermopylae sets in place a better vision than the movie 300 although it is nice to know that the producers of the movie did their homework. The Last Stand of the 300 offers just as much or more realization and action of the battle. This would be a great tool for History teachers.,1350777600,,366,4.318840579710145

2796532,3,B000OIOPPE,This is a good introduction to the battle of Thermopylae and the Spartan military system in general.  You'll have a good basic knowledge of these events after watching this DVD.  There are some minor inaccuracies in the documentary but they aren't significant.  My problem with this DVD is that the 700 warriors of Thespiae who stayed to the very end with the Spartans don't rate a mention.  Thespiae is a part of Boeotia in central Greece.  It lost every male citizen at Thermopylae compared with Spartan's 4%.  The Persians destroyed Thespiae for good measure.  Citizens of Thespiae weren't trained in an agoge type system where military skill is honed or indoctrinated since childhood.  Because of that I think they were much braver than the 300 Spartans.  History has pretty much forgotten them and it's time a book or documentary deal with these brave men in some depth.,1344556800,4,875,4.8979591836734695

2796535,4,B000OIOPPE,"I enjoyed this documentary much better than the movie; I felt that the movie was too ""Hollywood"". Another reason I liked this better than the movie is because the movie almost completely left out the Navy side of the battle (but just as important!).

This documentary is something I can watch over and over again, and enjoy it each time. I really liked the detailed explaination of the different weapons, armor, tactics, & strategy that both sides used.

But where are the subtitles? I couldn't get mine to work. My PS3 said ""Subtitles not available"" or something to that affect. Now I'm somebody that likes to watch all of my movies with the subtitles on, so as to not miss anything being said. The lack of a subtitle option is the only reason I rated this a ""4"" rather than a ""5"".

I mean look, this is a program put out by a cable channel with a goal of entertaining the masses and making money. For what it's worth - they've done a good job with this.  There are some things that will certainly make an expert throw the remote at the TV, but I am much more PLEASED that they've created something that anyone can watch and maybe learn about a topic that they hadn't even heard of before.

HISTORY channel programs are not meant to be the final say on anything - they jumped that shark a long time ago.  Instead, they make History alive for folks who may not have cared before.",1274313600,,947,4.297752808988764
2796538,5,B000OIOPPE,"The Greek City-States are an important part of Western Civilization and Western History.  Between them, and the Romans, they truly define a huge part of our culture and beliefs.  And because of the Greeks, who held back the mighty Persian military, in more than one war, we have our ideas of culture, government and freedom.  FREEDOM!
You have seen the reviews.  Many people are happy with it.  Many think it is trash.  I think it is a wonderful DVD to show young adults and kids.  Yes, because it is not boring history, but neither is it trashy.  It is about individuals and the battles they fought and why.  True, the Spartans were not fighting for Athens or the other Greek City-States.  They were fighting for Sparta.  But then the other City-States were also fighting for themselves.  When it comes down to it, they were fighting for their freedoms, their wives, their children, their lands.  They were not fighting for us, or the United States of America.  BUT because they did fight we exist today.  Cool, eh?
The DVD does a very good job of describing the setting.  Why did the battle come about?  Who were the leaders?  What was happening at the same time of the battle?  How did each side fight, how were they armed, what was the result?  True, the Spartan King in the battle was in his 50s, not the young guy they show in the DVD, but that just means he knew what he was doing.  And maybe he dyed his hair?

I only wish the film maker had shown us the actual site today, rather than giving us just maps and computer graphics.  It would have been helpful to see just how side the space was between the mountain cliffs and the sea--also that trail around the heights.  Since I will never be able to go there, this would have given me a better idea of just what the Spartans and Persians faced.

There was considerable repetition of information, as this was apparently made for television with all its commercials and the lack of attention span, as opposed to those who see the DVD in one fell swoop.

2796547,4,B000OIOPPE,"Easily inspired from the smash theatrical film, ""300,"" this documentary by ""The History Channel,"" is as entertaining as it is informative.  Using a panel of historians and actors in sophisitcated, digitally enhanced reenactments, this disc will clearly appeal to the younger set. With a concentration on the battle itself, and to the History Channel's credit, a significant amount of the 91 minute documentary is spent discussing the Spartan philosophy and way of life in contrast to the other Greek city states and the political rivalies they shared.

Considerable air time is also devoted to the weapons and armor used by the Persians and the Greeks as well as the naval battles and the tactical expertise that allowed the Greeks to stave off Xerxes and the Persian army--said to be over 300,000 strong--against a force of about 1,500 men; roughly the legendary 300 Spartans themselves, and a loose confederation of other soldiers from other city states. The commentators and the program itself, in a highly engaging and entertaining manner, illustrate how the Battle of Thermopylae not only changed the course of Western Civilization, but preserved the the concepts of democracy and freedom in the ancient world.

While this installment carries, by no means the depth of Sir Kenneth Clark's ""Civilization,"" (see my review), it is, an acceptable, albeit, glitzy, action-packed, high-tech extravaganza of a documentary no doubt many high school teachers will find useful for the classroom on a slow Friday morning.

2796548,4,B000OIOPPE,"The battle of Thermopylae was one of the most decisive battles in world  history, as well as being one of the most awe inspiring.  If the beurocrats in Brussels truly want to forge a common sense of European identity then perhaps they should ensure that every schoolchild on the continent is at least aware of the story.

Sadly, the battle isn't really as well known as it should be, or at least wasn't until the blockbuster '300' came out last year.  And here we have an American made documentary to companion that film, sticking fairly closely to the events as depicted there (and astonishingly as the events are widely agreed to have actually happened).  In contrast to what other reviewers have written, I didn't find this to be particularly low budget.  True, talking heads take up much of the time, often stating the merely banal and obvious, but the recreated scenes are effective if brief.  In fact, they are so similar in style to the film that I'm sure a lot of the same extras and production team were involved.

Its such an astonishing story that its hard to tell badly and this documentary does quite a sound job.  I'm far from an expert on Ancient Greece but I was suprised at the historians seemingly claiming that the battle of Thermopylae caused the birth of a collective sense of Greek identity which led directly to a united Greece under Phillip II and then the glory of Alexander's empire.  Hmmm...I thought the subsequent war between Sparta and Athens (the peloponnesian) left all of Greece easy prey for the Macedonians (who for hundreds of years had never been allowed to participate in the Olympic Games because they were not seen as sharing in the common Greek cultural identity).

2796552,2,B000OIOPPE,"After only one viewing, I can't even begin to compile a list of the numerous factual errors and slapdash invention that characterize the tedious and shallow ""Last Stand of the 300.""  I was wary going in of the baleful influence of the shamefully dumb ""300"" movie, and this History Channel (tsk-tsk) production painfully lived down to expectations.

There's little point to belabor the obvious -- that this is a tabloid version of history with a LOT of dubious assertions, colored by a movie that was based on a comic book, populated by talking heads I've never heard of (and I have shelves of scholarly books on ancient Greek history) -- except for the ubiquitous Steven Pressfield and he's a FICTION author, for pete's sake -- and garishly illustrated by some  woeful computer graphics  that only add another element of unreality.  (Where was Thermopylae supposed to be, on a fjord in Norway in the middle of winter?  I've never seen a Greek summer portrayed in so many icy blue-grey tones before, and I guess centuries of writers, mapmakers, painters, and photographers never noticed the sheer seaside cliffs of Thermopylae until the makers of ""300"" pointed them out.)  A lot of outrageous allegations are made and accepted without question by the duly deputized historians  -- that ancient Sparta was run like a sadistic US Marine boot camp, based on exaggerated and unsubstantiated tales put out by Roman-era writers centuries after the fact, is a peculiar obsession of Pressfield's, as evidenced in his sadly influential book ""Gates of Fire.""  As if whippings and beatings were the way to forge an unyielding spirit or create the perfect warrior.  Sure, just like kicking your dog repeatedly from puppyhood will produce a loyal and faithful companion.

There is a strange tendency here to mangle the pronunciations of Greek-origin words and names; make up stuff when faced with a lack of actual contemporary documentation; and substitute theory for fact without telling the viewer the difference.  Then there are misplaced locations on the maps, wild speculation in place of sober analysis, and worst of all perhaps, a dreadful  modern ideological perspective that puts events and attitudes in words and concepts no ancient Greek would have understood.  We are subjected to a lot of bloviating about ""saving democracy"" when the Greeks had barely invented the word, let alone embarked on a crusade to make the world safe for it.  Your Greek footsoldier at Thermopylae was there because it was his duty to his city, his clan, his gods and his personal honor -- it was not because of high-minded speechifying put into his mouth by late 20th century partisan blowhards. It's ridiculous to ascribe our attitudes  and beliefs to peoples of the distant past, especially when we have so many of the Greeks' OWN thoughts and feelings from this time  preserved in their own histories and literature (mostly ignored, sadly, by these filmmakers).  You won't find any ""we saved democracy!"" talk in these accounts.  Even the notion that the Spartans were somehow ""professionals"" is more than a bit sloppy -- they drew no pay for their service, they were not ""professional"" the way modern mercenaries are ""professional"".  Spartan citizens (homoioi) were a class of landed gentry with no other designated occupation than war, much like medieval knights.  They would have occupied themselves with training, hunting, politicking, and overseeing their estates. They actually spent less time making war than you might expect, conservative Sparta not eager to rock the boat of its stratified society or risk precious and limited manpower wastefully. Spartan citizens formed a more or less permanent standing militia whose training and discipline and organization and internal cohesiveness were leagues beyond what the typical Greek citizen-soldier was capable of; that was the secret of Sparta's battlefield success.

Enough.  None of what I've written will sway the impassioned ""300"" fanboys who will insist on rewriting history to suit their own power fantasies;  including producers of cable TV documentaries that cater to such tastes.  For a truly well-made and balanced and engaging documentary on ancient Sparta in all its aspects -- a fascinating society badly served by this one-dimensional, third-rate effort -- I recommend to viewers  ""The Spartans"", 180 minutes,  hosted by Bettany Hughes, produced in the UK and aired and released in the US by PBS.

This video is remarkably true to Herodotus' description, and avoids the glamorization typical of Hollywood's treatment of the subject. It treats both the Greeks and Persians fairly, and provides an integrated view of both the land and sea battles and the related battles of Marathon and Salamis, which had previously been confused in my mind.

Unfortunately, the battle of Salamis and Themistocles' role is given rather short shrift. A fuller description is provided on the first disk of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-History-Channel-Presents-Engineering-an-Empire-The-Complete-Series-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000S0GYNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The History Channel Presents Engineering an Empire - The Complete Series (Collector's Edition)</a>, which appears to have originally been part of this disk.

Because the topography around Thermopylae has changed significantly over the past 2500 years, the film relies heavily on graphic representations of the battle, which helps clarify it in the eyes of the viewer. To the extent that actors are used, they look like Greeks and Persians -- dark, swarthy looks, and not inordinately handsome. There is, in the words of Hollywood, no ""love interest.""

It is quite blatantly just trying to cash in on the hype behind ""300"", evident by the filming style and perpetual sunset-esque backdrop.

Kudos to it keeping to history, although it does get wrong several aspects of the battle, and the Spartan nature for soft-spokenness.  The documentary claims ""it's not in the Spartans' nature to be silent"" during battle.  This is completely wrong; even Steven Pressfield, author on two historical fiction books on the Spartans, and contributing interviewee on this documentary, claims that silence on the field of battle was what made the Spartans particularly intimidating.

Information is presented regarding the origin of the disputes between the Persian Empire and the Greek City States, and the events which roused their enmity towards one another, as well as the training that King Leonidas and King Xerxes underwent to assume their responsibilities as military leaders and political rulers. The program provides a rich background of the historical, cultural, and martial disciplines of Sparta and the Persians and the strategic advantages that both had going into the encounter.

In addition to this, the narrators give a more complete picture of the other military and geographic factors of the battle, such as the role of the Athenian Navy; the foolishness of the Phocians and the courage of the Thespians in the battle; the types of armor, weapons that each army underwent, which proved to be advantageous for the Greeks and the tragedy for the Persian army.

The film also discusses the seaborne aspects of the campaign, which were at least as important as the Spartans and their stand at the pass. Where the ground battle was led by the Spartans, the sea battle was the domain of the Atheneans. Both Athens and Sparta TOGETHER would be the basis for Greek civilization and its success.

Unfortunately, the film is bogged down by constant repetition.  Since it was originally shown on the History Channel, it's obvious where the commercial breaks were.  After each of these pauses, there is an obligatory recap of everything that you've just seen, as if the viewer has landed on the program while channel-surfing and needs to be brought up to speed.  The program desperately needed editing for the DVD format.

Visually, the film looks low-budget, and is also very repetitious.  The filmakers show the same static shots of Leonidas or Xerxes simply standing still and staring into the camera over and over.  They also tried to mimic the cinematography of ""300"" -- lots of dark boiling clouds and almost surreal backgrounds.

The computer animations of the weapons, armor, and ships involved in the combined land & sea campaign were interesting, but too often were accompanied by distracting graphic ""flourishes"".  It seemed like every time they showed a map of Greece or Turkey, they would suddenly zoom in or spin the map around.  It's a good thing I'm not prone to motion sickness!

Still, if this if for your kids, it might still be worth watching as its better than nothing; I believe there's another documentary out there about the same and even worse.

The History Channel has put together a roster of experts who walk the viewer through the events that led up to the battle beginning decades earlier.  This includes events such as the Battle of Marathon and other battles that helped lead to full-scale war and the battle at Thermopylae.  There is also good background information on the formation of the Athenian navy and extensive analysis and discussion about how critical the naval battle was in addition to the work done by the Spartans.  The naval battles alone make for a quite an interesting story.

A good summary of Spartan culture is also put forth and is more even handed than it is worshipful. The truth is that there were aspects of Spartan culture that we would find noble and others that we would find quite distasteful. I appreciate that both were presented here to offer a true picture rather than the myth that Hollywood puts forth.

""Last Stand of the 300"" moves along at a good pace, is informative, and interesting. I would certainly recommend it to anyone wanting to know more about one of the most famous and compelling battles the world has ever known.

It is also very well done visually, with plenty of diagrams, maps, and details of weaponry, armor, and tactics on both sides. This is a first-rate production.

Last Stand starts at the beginning by detailing how the Greeks and Persians came to be at odds: The Greeks had supported Persian-controlled Ionian cities in rebellion, then defeated an earlier Persian expedition at Marathon. We also see how the huge Persian army got to Greece without a long detour around the Black Sea: by constructing a bridge across the Hellespont made of surplus ships tied together. We even learn about how the cables were made that secured the ships.

The major omission in '300' was that it nowhere mentioned the naval battles that were critical in keeping the Persians at bay while the Spartans fought the land battle at Thermopylae. And the Greek naval success, in turn, depended on Themistocles' having successfully pressed for the expansion of the Athenian navy, and then launching a daring attack against the much larger Persian fleet. None of that finds mention in '300', but it's all here in Last Stand. We also see what followed the Persian victory at Thermopylae, namely Greek victories at Platea and Salamis that caused the Persians to pack up and head back home for good.

Some will be annoyed by the frequent recapitulations that follow what were commercial breaks when Last Stand was broadcast, but those brief reviews are probably helpful for most viewers.

It however did not have the authoritative standard that I feel should be produced by the History Channel.  Even here there is a fair amount of conjecture, and the fact that the History Channel has managed to get TRUE academics (Paul Cartledge, Arguably THE leading scholar on Ancient Sparta, University of Cambridge) AND (Donald Kagan, Who wrote the definitive 4 volume set on the Peloponnesian Wars, Retired from Yale), both have appeared in commentary on Ancient Battles, especially dealing with Ancient Greece.  Makes me a bit concerned.

Some important details left out, are the fact that Pheidippides, prior to the Battle of Marathon RUNS 154 miles to Sparta from Athens to get help.  The Greeks and Persians are camped for 4 days before they ensue in combat, and during that time the Persian Cavalry HAD been offloaded from the ships.  This production does not even mention Pheidippides going to Sparta, he also runs back, in 2 days; takes part in the Battle of Marathon.

Also the Athenians defeat a small part of the Persian Force as the main body had sailed away, to Piraeus to land and invade from.  The entire Athenian Army marches all night the 27 odd miles to arrive prior to the Second Persian landing, which does not happen and they go home.  This is gross negligence for academics to ignore this, and it is why I question the use of lesser known people for this particular production.

There were some opinions expressed by scholars here that I did not particularly agree with though.  The most important being the comparison of the Spartan Force to Special Forces and Delta Force.  Not so.  The Spartans are undoubtedly the best fighting force of Ancient Greece at the time, but they are heavy INFANTRY.  They are not even close to any kind of special operations unit in the modern sense.  So for me this is a nice compliment, and an argument can be made they were the `closest thing' but authoritatively they are nothing like special operations in training or tactics.

They do not discuss any of the battlefield tactics of the land battle of Platea, which I found disappointing.  Herodotus has some interesting things to say about it.  As to Thermopylae it would have been a nice addition to see some aerial footage of the landscape as it is now, even though it has changed show me the real stuff to give me an actual sense.

In this I actually purchased a very expensive copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Empires-at-War-Three-Volumes-A-Chronological-Encyclopedia/dp/0313332150/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Empires at War [Three Volumes]: A Chronological Encyclopedia</a>.  What a let down.

Yet the volume set is touted as the credibility of the scholar on this special who gets the most airtime, and after seeing it all, I am not convinced he should be considered a subject matter expert of the Persian Wars.

If you have academic background in the field of Ancient History, or are looking for an authoritative account, this only serves as an adequate introductory.  It has almost as many accuracy problems as 300.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thermopylae-The-Battle-That-Changed-the-World/dp/1585675660/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thermopylae: The Battle That Changed the World</a>&nbsp;appears on the History Channel's Decisive Battles of the Ancient World, for both the Battle of Marathon and Thermopylae, which cover the battles much more effectively, and had they been smart enough to combine that with the production or do a re-shoot, what a difference it would have made.

Also featured in the History Channel's Decisive Battles of the Ancient World.  Donald Kagan, now in his 80's is featured throughout the same series, I would much rather have seen these scholars used versus a crew of qausi military historians who don't seem to know as much as they should to narrate this type of production.

I did like the use of Steven Pressfield, and recommend his ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gates-of-Fire-An-Epic-Novel-of-the-Battle-of-Thermopylae/dp/055338368X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gates of Fire: An Epic Novel of the Battle of Thermopylae</a>"" novel of Thermopylae.  He is an excellent story teller, and did such fantastic research that the Greek city of Sparta, made him an honorary citizen a few years ago.  The historical backdrop of his novel is incredibly detailed.

So that is my take.  I am about to begin my graduate work in Ancient Greek History, so I feel like I know something about it.  There are places where Herodotus is translated in ways that are not entirely agreed on by all scholars, and it is presented as if that is the only translation, I am not convinced that the scholars presented in the production have the language skills to do research in either Ancient Greek or Latin themselves, and it felt far too ""American"" of a production.  I would have loved to see one of the prominent Greek Professors from Greece, and at least a recognizable British Classicist.",1186790400,23,5868,5.69151376146789
2796586,4,B000OIOPPE,"I purchased 'Last Stand' to see a historically accurate depiction of the movie '300', and this DVD does deliver.  It has several interesting facts, and good visuals to illustrate, so the info gets absorbed and retained easily. My only complaint is the full screen aspect ratio (cos I'm a widescreen nut, and considering it is produced in 16:9, it is not acceptable!). It is presented in a 4:3 letterbox, so you will still see a stretched image with 2 black bars on your widescreen TV. However, I feel the quality is still acceptable if watched at 'zoom' to fill up the widescreen TV.  Audio is only Dolby 2.0, no surround but clear dialogue.
