2206641,5,B00079F6P8,"This is an incredable journey into the world of the Horse Whisper. There is something here for everyone.

In the unlikly setting of Sundance Square in Downtown Ft. Worth Texas, 3 of the most talented and well known trainers come together to compete, training 3 wild horses in 1 afternoon.

The styles, all diffrent, the results, the same....success!

With patience, understanding, determination and respect, the Whisper accomplishes his goal. Not just a training video, there is allot you can learn about leadership and accomplishing your goals from this beautiful video.",1106697600,12,571,5.322222222222222
2206642,5,B00079F6P8,"This is a brilliantly shot DVD and what a concept! I do not understand the theory of the last reviewers. Are horses anatomical make-ups far less superior than any other mammals? People and animals alike work and work out through their entire growth periods, only making their joints, muscles, tendons and bone density stronger! Why are horses less superior!

This film shows the possibilities of the relationships between humans and horses in a manner that is far less violent than past methods of breaking horses at the same age. This is a beautifully shot film that is entertaining and educational.",1106697600,3,600,5.0
2206643,4,B00079F6P8,Kept us glued. We liked it. If horses are your thing most likely you would enjoy this movie beats the sit com anyways,1379030400,,117,4.130434782608695
2206644,4,B00079F6P8,The video gave me the information I was seeking.  It portrayed the training in an interesting fashion that did not become boring.  It held my interest because it followed three trainers and not just one.,1360627200,,203,4.771428571428571

2206646,5,B00079F6P8,"I really enjoyed watching these three trainers work with their colts.  It clearly demonstrates how the application of natural horsemanship in varying styles and horses (and in a unique setting) can result in positive outcomes for all involved.  We all have our individual styles; what works for us may not work for someone else and this DVD shows that.  I recommend this to anyone interested in having a relationship, whether it be pleasure, competition, working, or otherwise with their horses.",1277424000,,495,5.1625
2206647,4,B00079F6P8,"A great DVD with huge amounts of information, it was great to see all three trainers at the same time and be able to judge for ourseves how we thought each was going.the comentators were a bit annoying and there were times when I wished they'd just shut up for a while, in fact after the first couple of times watching I did turn the sound off and let the picture tell a thousand words.
I do find it hard to understand how Craig Cameron didn't win the challenge as he was the only one of the three to coplete allthe obsticles and then walked trotted and cantered(loped)bridle less all this on a horse that had only 2.5 hours of handling.
all three trainers did a great job and I think the greatness comes into being when we are able to watch this DVD years later and learn from all three men. congratulations to all.",1275868800,,816,4.2709677419354835
2206648,2,B00079F6P8,"I rented it and am glad. It is not worth the buying price. It has a difficult to watch format and while the astute viewer may pick up some information, it is not much. The 3 trainers are good at what they do--HOWEVER--the entire concept of putting this much pressure on very young horses is a bad one. The trainers had to push the horses too fast and too far. This was not training but flooding, even when done with some feel and timing. Parelli makes himself look like an ass at the end, Cameron just pushed his colt too hard through out and Lyons is the best of the worst that day. All 3 know how to properly train a young horse and this venue was not it.",1270857600,4,657,4.10077519379845
2206649,5,B00079F6P8,"This is a good dvd for anyone who is thinking of doing any training or even just riders, because every time you get on a horse you are training it. You can't just ride. I think that the best way to train is through natural horsemanship. These are some of the best in the business and you quickly get a feel for how they do things. Josh Lyons' father John is the first one I ever saw and is still one of my favorites. I've never really watched Pat Parelli, because every time his show comes on it seems to be his wife teaching something about english riding, which isn't my thing. They should call it the Linda Parelli show. The other that I like as much as John Lyons is Clinton Anderson who isn't on this dvd, but this gives you an idea of who's methods you might like best so that you can look into them.",1249862400,2,806,4.1075949367088604

2206651,5,B00079F6P8,I enjoyed this film. Each contestant was good at how they taught. I feel it would have been a better training device if they had filmed each one seperately instead of all three being on the screen at one time.,1223337600,3,209,4.25
2206652,3,B00079F6P8,"Was so anxious to see this video...perhaps that's why it disapointed me. The shooting was very amateur (and low-budget) even as the premise is very exciting. Because three horsemen are on screen at once, and only one of them is highlighted into a bigger part of the screen at a time, it's hard to really see what's going on or to appreciate it. I don't regret buying it, but neither was it what I expected, thus the 3 stars.",1201651200,2,424,4.379746835443038
2206663,5,B00079F6P8,"IN A WHISPER training challenge - EXCELLANT DVD - very interesting and information packed. An insightful & entertaining 2 hour training challenge featuring 3 of the best clinicians in the world; Craig Cameron Josh Lyons and Pat Parelli.

Fantastic DVD I watched it and was very interested in it and am not into horses but had to watch all of this DVD. THE ABSOLUTE BEST.

My daughter was convinced that Josh Lyons was the best ever after this DVD and now will become a horse handler, breeder and hopefully buy her own stock one day soon. She is 17 and admires horses and after this DVD has become convinced to follow in Josh Lyons foot steps.

The desciption is exact and the profile of the trainers and horses does entice you to see the complete DVD in one go.

FANSTASTIC, EASY WATCHING, GREAT COLOUR AND EASY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS HAPPENING.  A MUST BUY PRODUCT HERE. THE BEST EVER. A person that likes to learn visually this is the one for you if you want to learn about what to do with your horse and how to understand the horse.

The packaging of this item and delivery is impecible so is the communication with amazon a great company.",1178928000,7,1144,4.475961538461538

2206665,5,B00079F6P8,I thought this DVD was awe-insprirng.  I had been used to training by breaking.  These three were able to train 2 year old green horses in just 2 1/2 hours to do many amazing things.  To do so they used humane training methods instead of forcing their horses to do what they wanted them to do.  It was unbelievable; the connection between the trainers and the horses was evident.  It was good to see how they each approached the horses differently.,1141516800,19,448,4.481481481481482
2206666,5,B00079F6P8,"First, my order was filled promptly by the distributor.

I have watched the video and it was excellent as I knew it would be.  I have seen Craig Cameron's work before and what he and the other three men accomplished working with a green horse is truly amazing, one could say miraculous.  I was always taught that it takes a certain amount of man handling to ""Break"" a horse.

These men were able to gain the confidence of these animals in a very short time. I would recommend this to anyone.

I have read some of the harshly critical reviews of this training session and believe that they are taken out of context.  This was a one off event showing what could be done in a limited amount of time.  It is not meant to be the end of any work that might be done with these horses.  It is obvious that the horses will need to be worked with subsequent to this event in order to make them a safe reliable companion.

Perhaps those who are so critical have not been quite as successful in there efforts to train young horses.

I am sending the second copy to my cousin in Lousiana.",1140998400,10,1075,4.251231527093596
2206667,5,B00079F6P8,"A Glimpse of Talented Trainers at Work!, October 16, 2005
Reviewer: Invincible ""Invincible"" (Where Cowboys Still Ride) - See all my reviews
This training challenge was FANTASTIC! The horse trainers participating in this challenge were just a handful of the very gifted/skilled horse trainers in this world, and it was a real treat to watch these 3 men in particular work with their horses with such impressive skill- even the person who placed third in this challenge was able to achieve what an ""average"" trainer could only dream of in just 2 1/2 hours.
I have had the pleasure of attending clinics hosted by Monty Roberts, Pat Parelli, Clinton Anderson, Gawani Pony Boy, John Lyons, Craig Cameron, just to name a few, and have found that each & every one of these gifted trainers have an abundance of insight that adds yet another shining facet to our understanding of what it means to train a horse. The years of experience that these men have was obvious to see as they made it look easy - however, we all know it really isn't easy!
Due to the time constraints necessary to maintain a reasonable viewing time, the viewer will not see step-by-step training like the materials these trainers and others like them have available, but you will be able to see that these three trainers are definitely not ""average"" in any way!
The organizers of this challenge used Foundation Bred American Quarter Horses from one well known, respected, reputable ranch, all at the acceptable starting age & proper maturity for the Foundation Bred American Quarter Horse. All horses were healthy and unhandled to keep this competition as fair as possible so one trainer wouldn't have an advantage over the others.
Horse owners - don't pass this one by! This program is most definitely worthy of any horse owner's time, especially when it's something as good as this!! The filming, camera angles, lighting, sound and music were all excellent - top notch!
Hats off to the 'In A Whisper' training challenge creators and the trainers who participated; they made it worth every moment of viewing time for all viewers. It's no wonder why people that have watched this really do appreciate it! MADE IN AMERICA - LIKE GOOD COWBOYS!",1129334400,26,2205,4.8514588859416445
2206668,2,B00079F6P8,"I thought some of our starting techniques here in Australia could do with a little refinement - but this DVD makes our station stockmen and the way they handle horses look like kindergarden teachers, which is just what they should be with horses of this age - equine Kindie teachers, not the slavemasters pictured in the DVD.

Very nasty and only educational in the sense of it demonstrating what not to do with a young horse, as another reviewer has mentioned.",1129334400,18,461,4.691358024691358
2206669,5,B00079F6P8,"This DVD is a simple marvellous demonstration of how to invite disaster - psychological and physical to your horse, and financial and physical to yourself.

FACT - a horse is not sufficiently mature to carry even a light-weight rider at 2yo.

FACT - these horses were not psychologically sound. They were clearly 'shut down' towards the end of the DVD.

FACT - veterinary bills, long-term treatment and a shortened active working lifer are almost inevitable when a horse is started at such an immature stage and in such a physically stressful fashion

FACT - a 'shut-down' horse is not a quiet, safe horse who will respond to the rider in a situations where such response is essential for life and limb.

If this DVD is used as a demo of methods to avoid lest the trainer sets up himself and the horse for one or more of the above problems, then it has served its purpose.

Oh, and by the way, wearing a helmet around young horses is probably a good idea, too.",1129334400,8,960,4.520231213872832
2206670,1,B00079F6P8,"A very insensitive DVD showing how the ego of human beings can corrupt and violate the innocence of a young animal.

Proven research has shown that a 2 year old horse cannot physically and psychologically cope with the demands these three so-called experts throw at the them, in the name of competition.  What is more appalling is that it is done under the banner of ""natural horsemanship"".  I would much rather train my young horses in the un-natural way of slowly, gently, with compassion and understanding.

In order to earn respect one must first show it.",1129248000,30,559,4.791666666666667
2206671,1,B00079F6P8,"I loaned this DVD from a friend and was not impressed.  All I can say is poor young horses.

This 'show' did nothing for the horse, but was all about showmanship and egos of three supposed top trainers.  I hesitate to call them Natural Horsemen for to me they were anything but - maybe in the world of cowboys they would be perceived as kind, but I can't see anything kind in backing a physically and mentally immature horse and subjecting it to hours of stress, just to please the crowd.",1129248000,33,488,4.34065934065934
2206672,5,B00079F6P8,"""In a Whisper"" is one of the most impressive displays of horse training skills I have seen. With a variety of training methods covered in the video, viewers can observe pros and cons of each and choose for themselves which method they prefer.

2206673,1,B00079F6P8,"[...]

A horse is skeletally and muscularly immature until he is at least five years old- this is not airy fairy nonsense, but easily provable veterinary fact. A horse does not even get his full set of adult teeth until five years of age.

The programme that Parelli, Lyons and Cameron put these babies through, would knacker even an older horse that hadnt been in work for a while. Even the advertising hype from the website devoted to this film states ""The In A Whisper Challenge takes place in the historical Sundance Square in the middle of downtown Fort Worth, Texas. An environment that would be challenging for even a well trained and seasoned horse.""

What do you think those poor totally unprepared young bodies felt like after carrying a guy the size of Parelli for over an hour?

Would you take a ten year old kid, from some backwoods area, who has never been to a city before, or seen a crowd of people, and subject him, without any physical, never mind mental, preparation, to two and half hours hard labour, making him run round fast in circles, carrying a heavy weight, making him carry this heavy weight over jumps, and trail a bale of hay round the arena? Do you reckon that he could do this without any muscles aching to the point of being torn? 'Building up a relationhsip of trust for the future'- the commentator says on the DVD. I don't think so.

I am no animal rights activist, but a trainer of 37 years experience, teaching and lecturing worldwide. Parelli in particular, has the biggest ever platform to educate, with an organisation of, I am told, 250,000 members. There can be no horseman in history who has had such an opportunity. It is unbelievable to think that he has taken part in such an exploitative contest, without a single thought for the example he is setting to so many novice owners. Here in the UK, it is the novice owner mostly, who gets into Parelli Natural Horsemanship, because there are many adult riders who are buying horses for the first time and having learnt to ride at a riding school, and with no  ground handling teaching, haven't a clue how to actually handle a horse. Lyons and Cameron are every bit as guilty, but it is Parelli I am especially disgusted with, as the figurehead of the largest membership organisation in the equestrian world, and with it, bears a huge responsibility.

The Parelli distance learning system filled a much needed gap in the market, and, although I disagree with a lot of the techniques used, it has to be said that it has been very successful. But these are the owners who will hang on every word Parelli says, do as Parelli does, and if this DVD is seen by many of those riders, it could set back the education that we here in the UK, have been trying to inculcate in inexperienced riders, by a couple of decades.

2206674,5,B00079F6P8,"I'm not much of a horse person- maybe get out for a ride with my family 2x or 3x per year- but when my wife started to watch this DVD it captured the attention of our entire family!
  I looked at the 'In A Whisper' training challenge from the point of having watched my wife & daughter start & train a couple of our horses- the guys in this training challenge are quick and they know what they're doing!  It was a pleasure to watch these trainers start their horses and bring them to the point of being able to ride in a way that would seem impossible in just a matter of a couple of hours.
  My wife & daughter- the horse people in our family- have watched this DVD over & over and get a little more from it each time.  It was educational for them, but yet it was entertaining for the rest of our family- which I consider quite a feat!
  The 'In A Whisper' training challenge will be something any horse enthusiast, whether it's someone like myself or a horse person like my wife & daughter, will enjoy!",1119916800,11,1004,4.16580310880829
2206675,2,B00079F6P8,"Setting aside ""favorites"" among clinicians and debates about training, and speaking only to the format of the video, this was a definite disappointment. The pace of the training is (of necessity) so quick that the ""split screen"" format is next-to-useless and too out-of-sync to really compare ""apples & apples"". The narrative was not organized explanation, it was the random and loosely applicable commentary of show announcers. And Truth is, the basics behind the methods of all three of these good gentlemen are quite similar and the ""results"" of this ""contest"" were really determined by the individual natures of the horses chosen just as one will find in ""real world"" training. So this video, though it makes the important point of needing to adjust method to fit the ""student"", is not something that allows  much useful comparison of different popular methods. I would have liked to have been at the ""challenge"" in person but the video just doesn't cut it. As indicated in the review title, expect to watch this video once and then be hoping you can trade it to someone for something else.",1114905600,10,1094,4.945652173913044
2206676,5,B00079F6P8,I liked the video idea showing all 3 trainers at once.  It shows each trainers different method of working with their horses.

2206677,5,B00079F6P8,"I thought it was very interesting to see 3 trainers with their different styles training 3 horses to being rideable within a couple of hours. I liked the split screen where you could see how each trainer was accomplishing their goal at that particular stage of the training. You can pick and choose the method you like the most.

2206679,1,B00079F6P8,"The pressure they put these young horses under is horrendous. For three trainers who claim to have the horse's best interest at heart, three trainers who have thousands of followers who think they are doing the best things for their horses, to not only endorse but actively participate in not only riding two-year-olds, but putting them through tasks like those on this DVD, is completely unacceptable.

2206680,5,B00079F6P8,"This was one of the great horse training videos I've seen and I really enjoyed it.  The editing at the end, for the contest, could have been better, the voice over made it sound like some things had taken place off camera, but it didn't really look like that.  If they did, the editor should have shown the entire contest.

I did have to object to the constant reference to training methods that are ""new.""  At one point, the narrator said these were techniques that had developed in the last 25 years.  I started in horses in 1950, and I've broken more horses than I can count, and until about a decade ago I didn't know anyone WASN'T useing these techniques ~ I was taught them, and using them by the time I was 10.  They date back for centuries.

These men were great to watch, and the entire idea was good.  I liked the split screen and I COMPLETELY agreed with the winner.  (I thought Pat Parelli came off an egotistical poor third by comparison to the other two.)  I 100% embrace the methods and am glad they are popularized, but let's stop calling them NEW.  These guys didn't INVENT these techniques, they MARKETED them.",1109030400,20,1128,4.427184466019417
2206681,5,B00079F6P8,"How can I pick just one snarky title for this made-it-big-rodeo-clown? Here's what one reasonably-priced horse trainer thinks about the profoundy perplexing Pat Parelli and his over-priced and over-peddled training practices and products. Just go to this guy's website and get a load of what this scheister and his marketing guerilla's charge to become inducted into his MLM-like levels program. I don't mean to pick a fight, but someone has to speak up and try to save unsuspecting horse people their time and money. And for you folks who like the guy, that's fine too. If he was able to help you with your horse, that's great - I'm just glad you didn't get hurt - I know your wallet might be a little bruised though. I am in no way ambivalent when I assert that jumping bareback with no reins is only for advanced trainers and should not be on the cover of a training book (Naural HorseManShip - somebody hand this guy a dictionary) intended to be used by lay folks as it may give them ideas about doing things with un-tacked horses that may get them KILLED. The guy's obviously great with horses, but he sure doesn't mind lining his pockets while confusing you about the very NATURE of training and creating expectations that could have you end up in the hospital . . . or worse! Also get a load of this vain jerk at the end of the ""In A Whisper"" horse training competition DVD. If this guy weren't so comfortable ripping people off, he'd be funnier. My advice - keep your shirt on and ride your horse in a well-fitting, comfortable saddle that is securly attached. Have at least one hand on the reins and make sure you train your horse to stop DEAD when you want or need him to. By the way, Parelli's book doesn't tell you right up front that STOP is really important for your safety that horses are NATURALLY good at GO. If you are going to jump, try to remember to wear a helmet. Remember though, competence is always your best safety equipment.
