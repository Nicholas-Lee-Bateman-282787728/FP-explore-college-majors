8582897,1,B007USWD7I,This one is goofy AF. The first story is okay but the content wasn't something I like (very rapish) the two following storys go together and are completly stupid and not a turn on. Very old style boy type cartoon stuff. Not like the cool devices episodes Ive seen in the past.  Kind of a cross between pokie'mon and star wars. Youre not missing anything if you don't add this one to you're anime collection,1488672000,,406,4.413333333333333
