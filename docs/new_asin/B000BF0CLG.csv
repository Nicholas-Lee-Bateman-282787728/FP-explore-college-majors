2415101,2,B000BF0CLG,I bought this to introduce the globe trotters to my 8 year old son. We were both bored to tears. It is mostly editorial by famous people associated with the globe trotters. Very little time spent on filming them in action. And the clips shown are very short. You walk away understanding the racial component and who did not get along with who. It would have been nice to see what the globe trotters are famous for. Meadowlark Lemon is breif and at the very end. If you are looking for editorials about the globe trotters this is it.  If you are looking to see the globe trotters doing there thing skip this one.,1136246400,63,611,4.359649122807017
