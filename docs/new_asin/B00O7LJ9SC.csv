8682369,2,B00O7LJ9SC,"From the opening scenes, Egypt was started by aliens lead by Osiris. Their intent was to conquer the world, but somehow they got trapped and buried in a pyramid and can reactivate every 5,000 years when certain stars line up. There is a bronze key that is needed to open it, a bad guy, the professor and Mary Ann all go to the tomb at the right time etc.

The plot was boring. The science has horrible. A few things... There are no stellar alignments that take place every 5,000 years. Sirius was never a pole star. And you can't carbon date bronze, it has no organic carbon.

The movie attempts to be a combination of ""The Mummy"" ""Stargate"" and ""Indian Jones."" And not the good Indian Jones film, the one with the Crystal Skull. The film is too short and formulaic. The characters were shallow. The special effects were above Asylum grade, except for that one insect thing.

Might work for the kids.
