8389376,1,B00361UGD6,"""Juno & the Paycock"" was filmed in a visual aspect of 1.33:1, as were all TV films and programs of the time.  This shady outfit offers you a version that's 16:9.  Now, how do you suppose they did that?  There's 2 ways and either one is a mutilation of the original film.

First, you can cut off the top and bottom of each frame.  This is the way many ""widescreen"" films were made immediately after 1953.  Converting to 16:9 will lose about 1/3 of the image.  You want to pay full price for only 2/3 of the film?

Second, you can expand the image to the widescreen aspect.  This means everyone and everything is bloated.  Try it yourself:  while watching anything that's 1.33:1, use your controller to convert the screen to the wide aspect.  If you like what you see -- say, Humphry Bogart looking like Sidney Greenstreet -- then maybe this travesty is for you -- assuming they didn't just chop it to pieces.

Please note they don't even bother to tell you how they do the deed.  They don't want you to find out how they butchered this film.  These people are not doing you a service.  They're trying to capitalize on the widespread and utterly stupid fear of black bars on the TV screen.  ""This picture has been modified to fit your screen.""  What a bunch of irrational hogwash.  If you're afraid of black bars, maybe TV isn't for you.  There's always radio:  it ALWAYS fits your screen.",1266105600,5,1387,4.446215139442231
