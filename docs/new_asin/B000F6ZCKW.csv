It turns out that Wells Fargo delivered mail on the West Coast; and I associate them with the banking industry.  It said under Nixon the post office radically changed.  I did not know that.  The emblem for the Post Office that I've seen all my life is relatively new.  Like most ""Modern Marvels"" episodes, they spend much time talking about how machines operate.

The work does end by mentioning UPS, FedEx, and email.  It says the regular mail sends far, far, far more than those private companies.  However, this episode was probably made about 10 years ago.  Since then, there are now smart phones, text messaging, and the whole nine.  The Post Office is in terrible trouble.
