8190650,5,B000PDZRU0,"This one hour movie is basically the ""film version"" of Keith Bradsher's HIGH AND MIGHTY, which is a de-facto history of sport utility vehicles in America. If you want to know why America will never embark on a comprehensive energy policy until a crisis occurs, this film will demonstrate that Americans are incapable of ANY honesty about the travesty of the sport utility vehicle. It's all here folks: affluent (and brainless) soccer moms maintaining they ""need"" a 5000 pound, $75,000 SUV to drop little ""Seymour"" off at school. Or how about crass marketing to ""pioneer fantasies"" of frustrated American men, or the fears of American women, who seem to believe they are safer in a poorly engineered vehicle with a high center of gravity? In the movie, Mary Sipes, head of SUV development at General Motors, recounts how she made the male engineers wear skirts and pumps, so they could better relate to women's ""needs"" in a vehicle; door handles are not discussed as a safety or durability issue, but whether the design might break a woman's nails! Jason Vines, who , like a bad NFL Assistant Coach, just seems to keep resurfacing with another team, shows why we should never trust a ""public relations"" representative. He makes a total ""burro"" of himself, confusing pollutants such as nitrogen oxides with the emmission of carbon dioxide, which is directly proportional to the fuel economy of a vehicle. He also maintains a Chevy Suburban with eight people on board would be getting better fuel economy that a Honda(?) Prius(!) with only a driver. Well, no stuff! There is only one problem: on my trip to work, I see 90% of these behemouths carrying only one or two people. Using this reasoning, a school bus carrying 72 kids gets better fuel economy than a Prius with even 4 people; I guess that means everybody in America should drive to work in a school bus! Bob Lutz comes off reasonably sympathetic, since he is pretty up front about the fact that if Detroit can market garbage, and Americans want it, well, that is the ""American way,"" or something like that. I bet the reader did not realize that the Pilgrims came to America, and the New England militia died at Bunker Hill, so that a bunch of obese, self-centered Americans could drive around in motorized phallic symbols. But then, I guess you learn something new every day! So buy this video, and have a good laugh...or maybe a good cry.",1340496000,,2396,4.762019230769231
