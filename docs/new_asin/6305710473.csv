1069002,5,6305710473,"Hello to all you fellow WWF fans out there. We all know that the WWF does  Pay-Per-View like no one else. But let me be the first to say that the 2000  Summer Slam was one of the damndest things I have ever seen. Lets just  start with the Hardcore title match. Everyone must give credit to Shane  McMahon, like him or not. Just buy this DVD and you will see why. And then  there is without a doubt, one of the GREATEST matches in WWF history in the  TLC Match. I will give nothing away about this match. It must be seen to be  believed. And then there is the main event. With HHH and the Rock involved,  that should speak for itself. Hands down, the 2000 WWF Summer Slam is  stacked from top to bottom. But don't just take this fan's word for it. BUY  THE DVD AND I GUARANTEE YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!! ITs TRUE! ITs TRUE!!",968716800,5,822,4.049689440993789
1069003,5,6305710473,I was there and it was amazing. Shane's bump made mick foley look like a amature. T.L.C. was the best match between these three teams ever. The WWF  title match was o.k. but could have been better. Benoit vs. Jerico was  there best match but that's not saying much. But overall a great ppv...buy  it,968025600,,299,4.4
1069004,4,6305710473,"I ordered slam on ppv and i was more than impressed. It's actually worth your 30 bucks which is usually not the case. The hardcore match between  Shane and Blackman was memorable.  Shane climbs 50 feet in the air and  Blackman knocks him off a scalfold.  Shane crashes to the ground in a bump  that would make Mic Foley proud.  Also the Jericho /Benoit best of 2 falls  was a great technical wrtestling match. The match of the night and maybe  the year was the tables,ladders, and chairs match between Edge,Christen/The  Hardyz/The Dudleyz. This match was exciting and brutal. The title match  between the rock/Kurt Angle/Triple H was good but featured the Rock and  Triple H for most of the match. Im sick and tired of these two goin at it  and I think the wwf fans are too. Overall this ppv is up there with Royal  Rumble and Wrestlemania 2000 as the best ppv of the year and will be  remembered for Shane's suicidal fall and the tlc match.",967420800,,942,4.464705882352941

1069006,5,6305710473,"The big draw of this Summerslam was of course the match featuring the greatest WWF champion of all time Al Snow against his all time nemesis the Red Rooster with the Gobbly Gook in his corner in a Wheel of death steel cage nightstick on a pole match.  Other great matches were The Rock Dwayne  Johnson vs. Chris Jericho vs. Joel Gertner in a losers leave wrestling  triple threat match...fortunately Jericho and Rock lose but they soon come  back as Dwayne the Clown and Dink ""The Sawed Off Midgit"" Jericho  and become jobbers.
Another great match is Loch Ness vs. Stunning Steve  Austin for the Intercontinental Championship with special guest ref The  Honky Tonk Man, 5 star bout even though Loch Ness falls down and can't get  up 1 minute into the match.
The European title match features Colonel  Robert Parker against The Undertaker, reknowned match for Robert Parker  insane moonsault off of the balcony Sabu style.
The tag title match  featured champions Jim Cornette and Nancy Sullivan vs. Dusty Rhodes and  Harvey Wippleman in a double dog collar cage match that has to be seen to  believe.
And the big media hyped match is the Grunge Grudge match as Rad  Radford takes on Eddie Vedder in a no holds barred slobberknocker.
One of  the other great match is the women title match featuring Greg the Hammer  Valentine against her nemesis Elizabeth, crazy bloody brawl.

I strongly recommend this dvd,1298678400,,290,4.105263157894737
1069062,4,6305710473,"This wasn't the best Summerslam, but this was actually really enjoyable. Thanks for reading.

MVP vs. Jeff Hardy
This, was actually one of the best matches on the card. These two had a great rivalry going after Hardy was drafted to SD. This had it's moments, but i was disapointed with the ending. With Hardy going for the Swanton but instead god a face full of Gold standered. Then, with MVP getting that freakin' huge kick for a cheap win. I mean, after Hardy moved to SD, its like everyone was after him(For the drugey that he is). But, very enjoyable, and very solid, this actually couldn't have been any better. 4/5

Mixed Tag Match for the Intercontinental and Womens Title
Santino Marella and Beth Phoenix vs. Kofi Kingston and Mickie James
You know, when i found out about this match. I had a huge sigh. I knew from the start of this retarted rivalry. That this match would be a joke. I mean, on Santino's team, Beth was the real man in the match. 2/5

ECW Title
Mark Henry vs. Matt Hardy
I thought this would have potential with the new move to ECW for Hardy. But all this match was, was a donkey took a crap, and this match was the turnout. This was just crap, after Henry got himself disqualified. WTF! -3/5

World Title
CM Punk vs. JBL
Well, this was just another match that didn't belong on the PPV. Because of JBL's blubber, this match was just slow, and boring as f**k. CM Punk won the title about a month before by cashing in his Money in the bank briefcase of Edge. But, for this match, i have really no comment. 2/5

WWE Title
Triple H vs. Great Khali
I had another big sigh, because at the time, i thought i was a big no-it-all about wrestling, and i was actually worried that Khali was going to win the title. But all this was, was a impressive win for Triple H. After being traded, Khali won a retarted battle royal, and this was one of the worst rivalry's i've ever seen for Triple H in his whole career. But, he did end up getting the biggest pedigree i've ever seen. Solid, but not much enjoyable. 3/5

Batista vs. John Cena
FINALLY, WE HAVE A GOOD MATCH! This, right here, was one of the best matches on the card. Cena and Batista had a great rivalry going after they held the tag title for about a week. Then, it just spiraled out of control once they started turning each others backs. But, this had a huge moment, which of course was the leg drop turned into a Batista bomb. But, that was just to sell Cena's neck injury. Then, another huge Batista bomb after it. Great match here, just like there 2010 feud. :D 4.5/5

Hell In A Cell Match
This of course, was the best match on the card. Especially because not only was this a HIAC match, but this was the return/revenge of the Undertaker. Edge, just goin' nuts after he lost his ""coveted"" world title. But, this match had some of the best moments. Like, a spear through the wall, a spear through the announce table, a huge last ride, a ""i understand"" chair elbow drop type thing through a table, the camera shot, a spear from the undertaker, the ca-chair-co to Edge, the winning tombstone, and finally, sending Edge to hell by chokeslamming him off a ladder through the ring, and then setting Edge of fire. Wow, that is a lot of great moments. But, this was a great, great match. Unbelieveable moments, Yeah Come On. 5/5

This was actually at the end of the night, a pretty solid PPV. This had about three or four good matches. I recomend this ppv.",1287014400,2,3427,4.352112676056338
1069063,5,6305710473,"Being a wrestling fan since the late 90's I have seen many WWE/F PPV's and SummerSlam 2000 is by far one of the best ever.  It is entertaing, dramatic, more matches than a normal PPV with 10 and every match is worth watching.  All of the storylines are good and the TLC match is worth the price of the DVD alone.  The intrigue from the Angle-HHH-Stephanie love triangle keeps you on your seat throughout the whole event.  Many of these matches are still played today on highlight reels and superstar packages.  Not only is this event alone a must have, but the fact that it is out of print and unblurred increases its worth dramitically.  It is also great to see many popular or even retired superstars back in their younger days such as HHH, Kurt Angle, Trish, Eddie and Benoit-RIP, Chyna, and The Rock.  The DVD extras are not quite over the top but include great segments leading up to the matches and post match interviews that are often not found on the poor WWE DVD's of today. Whether you are a collector or a casual fan look for a DVD i highly recommend this as a MUST HAVE!",1264032000,,1082,4.38
1069064,4,6305710473,"The year 2000 for the WWF wasn't exactly a favorite of mine.  ""WrestleMania"" was a disappointment.  Steve Austin was out for most of the year.  The Hardcore Title had become more of a comedy show rather than a hard-edged display of violence.  But most importantly, the PPV catalog for the WWF left much to be desired.

""SummerSlam 2000"" isn't exactly a great PPV.  But it's good enough to be seen at least once.  Skip to the end of my review if you want to know how I suggest you check this one out.  Otherwise, read on for a match breakdown:
___________________________________________________

1) Right To Censor v. Rikishi & Too Cool
---The RTC was a fairly new faction, but they quickly became one of the most hated of their time.  How exactly Rikishi & Too Cool caught on is beyond me, but whatever.  This opening contest is a fast-paced flurry of tag action.  It was meant to get a crowd ready for 3 hours of PPV, and on that basis, this is a fun little ride.  I probably wouldn't have enjoyed this one on any other spot on the card, but as a curtain jerker, I enjoyed it enough to want to watch the rest of the card.
""6.0 / 10""
___________________________________________________

2) Road Dogg v. X-Pac
---Honestly, it was about time that DX had split up.  With HHH or Billy Gunn not around this faction needed to go.  Leave it to talented competitors like X-Pac & Road Dogg to finally close it up.  While I commend them for giving us an enjoyable contest, it was way too short considering the history between these two.  It deserved more than 5 minutes for a true sendoff.  Fun while it lasts, but nothing more.
""6.5 / 10""
___________________________________________________

3) Intercontinental Championship
Val Venis (champion) & Trish Stratus v. Eddie Guerrero & Chyna
---Okay, context is everything, so here's what you need to know if you haven't heard about or seen this Intergender affair.  Trish was VERY new to the company, and had very little in-ring experience.  Chyna was the dominant female she'd always been.  And Eddie & Venis do most of the work.  The two men had my favorite match of the ""King-of-the-Ring 2000"" Tournament, and they continued to work very well together on this night.  Chyna could always work well enough with the male superstars, and Trish's minimal involvement is good comedy.  This isn't a throwaway Intergender contest; these four went for something better, and it's a lot more fun than you'd think.
""7.0 / 10""
___________________________________________________

4) Tazz v. Jerry Lawler
---The former ECW wrestler's career in the WWF was less than stellar, such as this bizarre feud with Lawler, that previously escalated in an assault on Jim Ross.  Well, if you can believe that Lawler's fists can hang in there with Tazz's technical array of suplexes & submissions, then maybe you'll enjoy this one.  For me, I had a hard time believing it.  The finish is kinda neat, but other than that, it's a typical Lawler match.
""5.0 / 10""
___________________________________________________

5) Hardcore Championship
Shane McMahon (champion) v. Steve Blackman
---Throughout the night, Shane had been running away from Blackman backstage.  When they finally got to the ring, Blackman proceeded to punish the champion.  eventually Test & Albert interfere to even Shane's odds, until Blackman manages to fight back and chase Shane to the top of the Titan-Tron.  This sequence led to the thing that Shane will always be most remembered for --- taking a ridiculous fall or leap of faith to entertain a crowd.  Oddly enough, this match isn't as much as it sounds.  It feels very by-the-numbers.  Hero dominates.  Villain's buddies come in to even his odds.  Hero makes a miraculous comeback.  Only the finish is anything special...I can't take anything away from that, I guess.
""5.5 / 10""
___________________________________________________

6) Two-Out-of-Three Falls
Chris Jericho v. Chris Benoit
---These two had an on-and-off rivalry throughout 2000, and it eventually ended in early 2001.  Along the way, they had this exceptional display of technical wrestling.  While it's not the kind of masterpiece you'd expect from these two, it's still pretty darn good.  Perhaps the big drawback is that it's a little short, clocking in at about 13 minutes total.  Don't get me wrong, you're going to see some wicked takedowns, submissions, & counters that only athletes of this caliber are capable.  But if you were to compile a list of all of their matches together, this would probably be somewhere in the middle.  Then again, a bad Jericho/Benoit contest is better than 95% of the WWE stuff today.
""7.5 / 10""
___________________________________________________

7) TLC Match - Tag Team Championships
Edge & Christian (champions) v. The Dudley Boyz v. The Hardy Boyz
---If it weren't for all of the DVDs that include this match, I'd say buy ""SummerSlam 2000"" just to see this match.  It was (and still is) my favorite match from the year 2000.  With all due respect to the ""No Mercy '99"" Ladder Match that started it all, and to the Table & Triangle Ladder Matches that took things further...THIS is the true culmination of what these three guys were capable of in high-spot showcases.  Most people will tell you TLC II from ""WrestleMania X-Seven"" is the best of them all, but I prefer this because the rematch repeated a few spots, and because everything flows a lot faster in this one.  It feels like just the right balance of trying win the tag team gold AND trying to punishing your opponents.  Regardless of which is your favorite, you must see this match!
""10 / 10""
___________________________________________________

8) Thong Stink-Face Match
The Kat (w/ Al Snow) v. Terri (w/ Perry Saturn)
---Okay, I'm not going to defend this pointless match on any intellectual level.  However, the point of the match is to see two gorgeous ladies in thongs, trying to deliver the Stink Face maneuver to win the match.  What else did you expect?  I was mildly amused.
""4.0 / 10""
___________________________________________________

9) The Undertaker v. Kane
---I expected way more from this grudge match.  I'd have thought that Taker's new biker gimmick would've allowed for a less supernatural contest, allowing for the two ""brothers"" to let it all out.  Well, they skip the tricks of old for a slugfest of new...and it sucks!  They basically punch & kick each other for a plodding 7 minutes, and it ends in a very strange fashion that was never explained in the weeks afterwards.  Taker rips off Kane's mask, we barely see Kane's face, and then...Kane has his mask back the next time you see him on WWF TV.  It's okay for a match to be more about the storyline than the physical contest, but this WWF had a lot more faith in our love of the characters than they should've.
""3.0 / 10""
___________________________________________________

10) WWF Championship
Kurt Angle v. Triple H v. The Rock (champion)
---Okay, you've probably heard how this all starts.  Because of the love triangle between Angle, HHH, & Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, HHH & Angle brawl before Rock even gets to the ring.  Angle is given the Pedigree through a table, but it was botched so badly that Angle got a real concussion, forcing Rock & HHH to basically have a one-on-one match for most of the main event.  Aside from seeing Rock & HHH duke it out for the 5th PPV in the year 2000, I actually thoroughly enjoyed watching this one play out.  Considering how bad the script had been derailed, HHH & Rock pulled it off so well that I actually believed it all part of the plan the first time I saw it.  If you like HHH/Rock matches with a twist thrown in, you'll like this one.  If you've watched them compete a bunch of times and haven't yet gotten around to this one, I wouldn't look too forward to this main event.
""7.5 / 10""

I strongly suggest you buy the 3rd Volume of the ""SummerSlam"" Anthology, because you get 4 additional PPVs that are equally rare, and for an excellent price.

Rating: 8/10- I wouldn't really call this a match since it never really offically started. All this was filled with was spots and Taker trying to take Kane's mask off which he succeeds in doing at the end.

1069067,4,6305710473,"Summerslam is one of the better ppv's from 2000. This ppv hosted the first ever TLC match and Shane McMahon falling from the top of the titantron.

1. Right to Censor vs. Too Cool & Rikishi
This was an alright opener. Scotty 2 Hotty was on fire during this match, he looked pretty good. Nice opener with a slick end. 3/5

2. Road Dogg vs. X-Pac
This match was put here to end whatever was left of DX at the time. They put on a decent match up with a couple of counters and reversals. A good match but nothing that will be remembered. 3.5/5

3. IC Title
Val Venis & Trish Stratus vs. Eddie Guerrero & Chyna
This is one that will surprise you. On paper it doesn't look all that but it was pretty good to watch. Eddie & Chyna worked pretty well with each other as a tag team. It was mostly all Eddie, Chyna, & Val but Trish got a couple of shots in. Another good match right here. 3.5/5

4. Tazz vs. Jerry ""the King"" Lawler
I have to say this match is the weakest on the card. Tazz was mostly taunting JR throughout the whole match with a little wrestling happening in the ring. Not a good match but JR did get some payback on Tazz. 2/5

5. Hardcore Title
Shane McMahon vs. Steve Blackmon
This match wasn't your typical Shane match. Shane mostly runs from Blackmon the whole time and just getting in little cheap shots here and there. Blackmon just wears out Shane and using his kung fu martial arts techniques to beat shane down. Test & Albert would come out on Shane's behalf and try to help shane. The highlight of this match is of course when Shane falls from the titantron after getting hit by a kendo stick from Blackmon. Decent match at best though. 3/5

6. 2 out of 3 Falls
Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho
I feel that this match right here is a forgotten classic match from these two. The match started out very physical and just got more physical as the match went on. The falls came at perfect times. Benoit and Jericho wrestled a great match with a lot of good counters and wrestling. This match to me is the match of the night. Awesome match. 5/5

7. TLC Match for the Tag Team Titles
Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz
What a match! There was nothing but pure excitement from this match all the way through. All 3 teams really upped their game then from their match at Wrestlemania 16. Bodies were crashing through tables and falling from ladders everywhere. Just a great and exciting match. 5/5

Thong Stinkface Match
Terri w/ Perry Saturn vs. The Kat w/ Al Snow
Not a match by any means. Just here for pure entertainment and to spice things up in the ppv. The Kat wins.

8. Undertaker vs. Kane
This was just an unsanctioned fight where Taker trys to unmask Kane throughout the match. They just brawled the hell out of each other and using everything they could including steel chairs and the steel steps. This doesn't compare to their previous encounters but its worth a watch. A nasty fight. It finally ends once Taker indeed unmasks Kane. 3.75/5

9. WWE Title
The Rock vs. Kurt Angle vs. Triple H
Before the match got underway, Angle made a comment towards hhh & stephanie whiched POed the game to the core. Triple h came out ready to end Angle's career and he almost did just that. HHH would try to go for the pedigree on Angle through the announce table when the table collapses on them which nearly gave Angle a severe concussion. The Rock and Triple h would then fight for the majority of the match with Angle being taken out. Angle however does make a comeback and almost wins the title. A pretty good triple threat match but nothing out of the ordinary besides the table crash. 4.5/5

1069068,4,6305710473,"I posted a review for the WWE SUMMERSLAM ANTHOLOGY, which I concluded that this PPV series was becoming ""one long cold shower"".  Last year's SUMMERSLAM was hyped as ""The Biggest Party of the Summer"", but I felt it was ""The Worst Party of The Year"".

However, I'm pleased to say that WWE's ""Biggest Blockbuster of the Summer"" lives up to its name.

*******************************

1) Jeff Hardy v. M.V.P.
---I wasn't really looking forward to this one, because both men's strange offense doesn't work with a lot of superstars.  But I was pleasantly surprised to see both Jeff and Porter use unique reversals and sensible wrestling from bell to bell.  Seeing these guys put on a match this good makes me regret losing interest in recent weeks.
""7.0 / 10""

2) Winners Take All
Mickie James (Women's champion) &
Kofi Kingston (Intercontinental champion)
v. Santino Marella & Beth Phoenix
---I was also completely surprised by this tag team contest.  This is probably the best Intergender Match I've ever seen.  For starters, Marella & Phoenix have such terrific chemistry; I'd be surprised if they weren't a real couple.  The match flows very well, as each person gets to look good before the finish comes.  But most of all, this whole scenario is flat-out hilarious!  It's filled with little facial expressions and great comedic timing, especially from ""Glamarella"".  Trust me, just give this one a look.  You won't regret it.
""7.0 / 10""
-------------------------------------

***I actually want to address Shawn Michaels' promo, because it's gotten mixed reactions from people.  I personally think everyone involved with this angle has done a tremendous job.  WWE was smart enough to know that if HBK came out on PPV airtime just to talk on a microphone, people were willing to tune in.  First, HBK gave a very heartwarming speech; I almost thought he might actually retire.  But eventually, Chris Jericho interrupted, and delivered one of his best speeches.  And then, when Jericho punched Rebecca, it looked pretty real to me.  This entire rivalry is a multi-layered work or art.  If you don't like to watch promos during a PPV, I understand.  But I urge people to give this an honest watch.  You won't see a better exchange of words between two wrestlers.***
-------------------------------------

3) ECW Championship
Matt Hardy v. Mark Henry (champion)
---Okay, two questions:
1) Who thought a 30-second title bout was a good idea?
2) Is Matt Hardy ever gonna get a decent SUMMERSLAM appearance?

To tackle the second question, I'm not joking when I ask.  After two exciting Tag Team appearances, Matt Hardy hasn't had a decent SUMMERSLAM match since.  He didn't get to compete in 2001, whereas brother Jeff got a Ladder Match.  His 2003 match against Zach Gowen was cancelled at the last minute.  He lost Lita's hand in marriage to Kane in 2004, which actually isn't very funny anymore.  And Edge beat him to a knockout in 2005, in a grudge that everybody knows about.  Hoenstly, what's the deal?

But more importantly, what possible intelligence is there in booking a brand's single PPV match this way?!  This PPV only ran 160 minutes, meaning these guys deserved at least 10 minutes to entertain paying fans!
""1.5 / 10"" (1 point for getting in the ring, and a half-point for the Hardys reunion at the end)
-------------------------------------

4) World Heavyweight Championship
JBL v. CM Punk (champion)
---Before I criticize too harshly, I want to be clear that I do enjoy this match.  However, you need to know that this title contest plays out like a typical Cena-style performance.  JBL dominates most of the match, and Punk wins after very little offense.  These kinds of ""underdog"" matches don't always work, but in this case, I think it does.  JBL got to use some rough offense, and Punk...well, what I can say...he made me a believer.  If you can forget Punk's classic ROH performances, then you might accept this one like I do.
""6.5 / 10""
-------------------------------------

5) WWE Championship
The Great Khali v. Triple H (champion)
---I have similar thoughts on this title match as I do with Punk/JBL.  It's an underdog-style, one-sided story.  But this time, it worked for me.  Even with a 9-minute length, and very basic offense from both men, I still bought into it.  I mean, how else would a fight like this play out if it weren't fixed?  Khali is an intimidating figure, HHH works extra hard to make the match work, and the crowd seemed to enjoy every second of it.  However, Jim Ross deserves the most credit, because he sold this story as well as anybody possibly could.  This wasn't a great match, but a fun one.
""6.0 / 10""
-------------------------------------

6) John Cena v. Batista
---Oh boy, I had plenty of doubts about this one.  The epic modern star clashes rarely work.  Well, was this a ""Bret/Shawn"" classic, or ""Goldberg/Lesnar"" dud?  Actually, it was more of a ""Hogan/Warrior"" battle, where it wasn't great, but good enough to convince skeptics.  At the outset, this match seems like it's going to be nothing but signature moves from both men.  However, what you start to realize as the contest plays out is that both Batista & Cena manage to put nice little spins on each of their moves.  You will get to see the finishers, but in ways you don't expect.  You will get to see the familiar moves, but also a few new tricks.  By the end, I was as caught up as the Conseco Fieldhouse crowd.  A surprisingly entertaining contest.
""7.0 / 10""
-------------------------------------

7) Hell-In-A-Cell Match
Edge v. The Undertaker
---Do I even need to write a review on this main event?  Actually I do, because Taker & Edge have put on five --- count them, ""FIVE!"" --- Match-Of-The-Year Candidates in one year alone.  The opening video package is very crucial to this encounter, because most Cell Matches with Undertaker involve an intimidated opponent.  But as you'll learn from the introductory video that hypes this Cell Match, Edge is even more eager to engage in the fight than Taker.  And once the bell rings, Edge brings the fistfight to Taker much like he did at WRESTLEMANIA 24.  But enough of the psychobabble, how's the match?  Like their TLC Match back in June, this Cell Match is brutal yet sensible.  When tables are set up, they're broken in convincing fashion.  When Taker & Edge escape the Cell, they only fight on the ground level.  When weapons are grabbed, they're used instantly.  Every Cell Match has some ""OUCH!"" moments, but only the best include terrific psychology with the weapons & spots.  Earlier in my review, I called the Jericho/HBK rivalry ""a work of art"".  This rivalry is the SMACKDOWN equivalent.  Come December, I think hardcore fans will have a heck of time picking a Rivalry-Of-The-Year.
""8.5 / 10""

OVERALL
---With the exception of a pointless, mind-boggling ECW Title Match, I enjoyed every single match from SUMMERSLAM 2008.  Even though I've used a couple of ""6"" scores, those matches are ""Sixes"" that I can still have a good time watching.  And speaking of that ECW Title Match, at least WWE included the TV rematch on this DVD.  The rematch is just over 11 minutes long, and isn't half-bad --- a weird (but nice) compensation.

But the rest of the package is the real deal.  Besides, the Edge/Taker Hell-In-A-Cell Match is so good that it's worth buying this DVD, even if you don't like the rest of the card.  SUMMERSLAM hasn't been kind to me over the last few years, but I think I'm going to hang onto this blockbuster for a very long time.",1221609600,5,7597,4.888018794048551
1069069,5,6305710473,"Awesome Hell in the Cell Match.  Boring WWE title match, although the ovation for Triple H kind of upped it a star.  Good intergender match as well.  Santino sells the weasle type character of the 80's Bobby Heenan.  In the ECW title match, it was short but seeing the hardys suplex Mark Henry was cool.  I was expecting Jericho to put HBK's wife into the walls of Jericho, but the punch to the face did just the same.  The Cena and Batista match was pretty good then with all the hype, it made it all the more better.  A little dissapointing that there wasn't much blood or any on the cell moments but this is from a being there live point of view.  There was a bit of a tease when Edge speared Taker through the cell, everyone was on their feet watching for Edge to scurry onto the top.  The spear through the announce table was a nice touch.  As we were leaving, things kept happening so we would hurry back to see, first Undertaker comes back and chokeslams Edge through the ring.  Then as we're going down some more we see flames appear.",1220400000,,1042,4.292307692307692

1069123,5,6305710473,"I witnessed Summerslam live in Conseco Fieldhouse and it was awesome!

MVP vs. Jeff Hardy

This was a good opener got the crowd really into it. MVP had some good counters on Jeff. MVP wins with his kick.

Kofi Kingston & Mickie James vs. Santino Marella & Beth Phoenix

This match was ok. More diva action than anything. Glamazon gets the pinfall on mickie. Poor Kofi he lost his belt without even getting pinned.

Shawn Michaels Announcement

Jericho punches Michaels wife and her lip swells up. Enough said.

Mark Henry vs Matt Hardy

Terrible, terrible, terrible. Lasted like 20 sec. before a DQ. Would have been a perfect night without this one.

CM Punk vs JBL

An okay match. Everyone pretty much knew that Punk was going to win. Couple of nice Counters Punk retains.

Triple H vs Great Khali

Surprisingly a good match. Mostly cuz of Triple H being a veteran and being able to make anyone look good. Triple H finally is able to peigree Khali for the victory.

Batista vs. John Cena

SHOW STEALER! I knew this match would be good and they hyped it up really well. These two men tore down Conseco Fieldhouse. Where I was sitting we ere all into this match. The buliding was split with Batista fans vs John Cena fans. Batista shows up John Cena in this match by using real wrestling moves. The figure Four leg lock, he's also been using Goldberg's Jackhammer as of late. 2 Batista bombs puts away John Cena. Great Match.

Undertaker vs. Edge

Seeing a Hell in a Cell match live is really cool especially when its Edge and the undertaker. No blood really but the action makes up for that. The used tables ladders and chairs, the broke out the cell, and Edge went through the ring. Very well done, a great return for Taker

Overall I was very pleased with Summerslam, especially being there live. A definite buy if you collect WWE DVDs.",1219449600,,1838,4.5212121212121215
1069124,3,6305710473,"Jeff Hardy vs. MVP - Hardy got control of the match early before MVP took over after one hell of a release belly to belly suplex that landed Jeff right on the top of his neck.  MVP focused on the neck & dominated for the rest of the bout before Jeff started to gain some momentum.  From here, Shelton Benjamin made an unknown appearence distracting Jeff for MVP to capitilize & get the win.

Intercontinental Champion Kofi Kingston & Womens Champion Mickie James vs. Santino Marella & Beth Phoenix a.k.a. ""Glamorella"" - This match went a little over 5 minutes & was watchable anything really noteworthy past some entertaining moments like Santino jumping into Beth's arms at one point which looked like something straight out of the old Shaggy & Scooby Doo cartoons.  In the end, Beth lead her team to win both championships & did a victory walk afterwards...with Santino on her shoulders.

Right out here was the big announcement by Shawn Michaels (who was accompanied by his wife) which was that he was going to retire because of his eye & other mounting injuries.  From here, Chris Jericho came out & had a verbal confronation with HBK in regards to why he was really retiring before Y2J ""accidently"" punched Shawn's wife right in the face & knocking her out.  Eventhough this was a real good verbal interaction, this should have been saved for RAW instead of taking time away from other matches on the PPV that people payed for like.......

ECW Champion Mark Henry vs. Matt Hardy - ......this one.  This is the forth time in a little over a year (Judgment Day '07, No Mercy '07, WrestleMania XIV) that the ECW Title match got around a minute of time.  This was a wrestlecrap moment if there ever was one.  First of all, they've been building up Mark Henry as this big monster for the past few weeks as ECW Champion but in the short time they had here (less than a minute), Hardy took out Henry with one move & was ready to win the title before Tony Atlas pulled out Hardy to save Henry leading to a double team before Jeff Hardy came out for the save.  Hopefully to make up for the match on the DVD, they'll put the ""rematch"" between these two on Sci-Fi days later but for the live crowd at home (like me) & in the arena...this was bull.

World Champion C.M. Punk vs. J.B.L. - I swear by looking at this match, you thought that John Cena & C.M. Punk switched bodies because this match was almost an exact replica of the ""WrestleMania 21"" match or the recent Judgment Day match between those two...with Punk replacing Cena in this case.  Eventhough Punk got a few moves here & there, this match was dominated by J.B.L. who was working over Punk's back non-stop with shoulder blocks, a fallaway slam from the top rope, an abdominal stretch, a waistlock, punches & kicks before Punk got the win out of nowhere with the GTS.  This was the typical J.B.L. performance we've seen since his return while we've seen Punk in better matches.  One nasty moment to look out for was when J.B.L. head cracked the back of Punk's head which lead to it being busted open.

WWE Champion Triple H vs. Great Khali - Concidering how Great Khali just didn't a good worker in the ring, this was the more unique Triple H match you've seen in a very long time as he did the exact same thing John Cena did around a year earlier to make the match watchable in that Triple H bumped & sold like a spotmonkey more than I can recall him doing for anyone in recent memory.  The only thing noteworthy here was the time that Khali did the classic Andre The Giant ""caught in the ropes"" spot but after trying over & over again, Triple H got the pedigree & overcame the giant Khali.

John Cena vs. Batista - Before I get started...eventhough the setup for this match seemed rushed, the fact that WWE played off their similar history dating back to when both men won the World Titles at WrestleMania 21 & even to how Cena main evented WrestleMania 23 but it was Batista's match that stole the show helped put this over as dream match more than anything feud related & made up for the lost time to build this match up storyline wise.
Both Cena & Batista have a reputation for being too ""off & on/hot & cold"" during their matches but that wasn't the case here as both men brought forth a strong effort & were on the ball in this match.  Batista used a different type of offense than we normally see from him as he showed signs of Ric Flair's offense of attack the leg & even used the figure four submission along with a rear naked choke later on while Cena also worked on the leg to set up the STFU.  From reversing each others moves like the powerslam into the FU & the leg drop off the top into a powerbomb before Batista unleashed ""the animal"" and proved he was as as Michael Cole put it, ""three seconds better than Cena.""  This was one of those matches where both men came out looking better than they did coming in & if Hell In The Cell wasn't on the card, this would have been the match that stole the show.

Hell In The Cell Match: Undertaker vs. Edge - In the weeks leading up to this match, you saw a Edge's personality change & if was showcased in this match as a different Edge wrestled here than you saw in their previous encounters. Edge came off as insane & obsessed with Taking out taker once & for all instead of being scared, intimiated, and relying on help like his previous encounters.  Throughout the match, Edge utlilzed his specialties in tables, ladders, and chairs throughout match while being very physical & aggressive in his offense like multiple spears through the caged cell wall & ECW announce table.  Undertaker didn't show a sign of ring rust & gave a main event performance like he usually does in this position & eventually overcame everything Edge threw at him, got his revenge using various props that Edge used against him in the past, & finished Edge off with a tombstone for the victory before sending Edge ""to hell.""

In the end, this PPV reminded me of Night Of Champions where if it wasn't for the last two matches...this would have been a passable to average PPV but the Cena/Batista & Hell In The Cell saved the show for me so I would honestly recommend this for a rental & make up your own mind if the entire show or just the main events are worth keeping for your collection.",1219363200,4,6284,4.423743500866551
1069125,4,6305710473,"Going into Summerslam I kind of knew that this would be okay and that the hiac wouldn't disappoint, but boy was I surprised.

MVP vs. Jeff Hardy

I knew theses guys wouldn't disappoint. That had a good and personal rivalry going into Summerslam and it helped the match even better. It was a good back and forth match with actually Jeff dishing out more moves. There was also some good counters on behalf of MVP. The crowd was into this to as you can here them cheer for both Hardy and MVP. Good opener. Overall  7/10

Winner Take All
Women's and Intercontinental Championship match
Kofi Kingston and Mickie James vs. The Glamazon and Santino Marella

This match actually surprised me. I thought it was going to be a very boring match. But it was quit watchable. Santino did the ""comedy"" while everyone else wrestled. Good enough to watch. Overall 6/10

Shawn Michaels segment

  It seems every once in a while Summerslam has a segment or moment people will  talk about. From the Macho Man and Elizabeth wedding to the returns of Triple H and Rey Mysterio. This on the other hand will do three things. Push a feud, push the ppv, and leave people shocked. Overall segment 7/10

ECW Championship Match
Mark Henry vs. Matt Hardy

This could have been an okay match but they turned it into trash. I wish the WWE would at least give ECW a chance of even doing something decent. I do remember the same thing happening at No Mercy 2007. Little faith. Overall 3/10 ( for aftermath)

World Heavyweight Match
CM Punk vs. JBL

This was a decent match. JBL basically dominating Punk with him throwing in some kicks and moves. It did look like JBL was trying a lot harder in this match as you don't see him lately doing a fall a way slam from the ropes. Also good athleticism from Punk. Overall 6/10

WWE Championship Match
Triple H vs. The Great Khali

Boy does the crowd have no fury on Khali. Like they did last Summerslam told him he could not wrestle. Minus that this was better than the last title matches. Triple H really tried all he could to make Khali look good and it worked for me. Its good to see him do the pedigree to Khali. Overall 6.5/10

John Cena vs. Batista

This was a tough one to call. These are two wrestlers that people think are both bad wrestlers and mixed with the crowd. This match was not exciting as hyped but it was a good match. I could tell Cena was getting a little better with him using some good reversals and a leg breaker move. Batista just tried to keep up with Cena. Overall 7/10

Hell in a Cell Match
Edge vs. The Undertaker

My oh my what a match. I would say this is one of the most brutal hell in a cell ever. There was also some nice table spots and things involving the cell. Edge was pretty much all over Undertaker but he kept his own here like back at Wrestlemania 24. There was also a clean chair shot in here that looked like it scrambled someones brain. The aftermath was also nicely done. This is will be talked about for a while and this is up there with the top hell in a cell matches. Overall 10/10

Not up there with most of the ppv this year but good ppv.",1219190400,,3100,4.319516407599309
1069126,4,6305710473,"For the first time in about 10 years, I ordered a wrestling PPV. For the most part, I don't feel I wasted my money. Here is my view on the card:

Jeff Hardy Vs. MVP - Decent opener with some nasty hard shots but I expected better with these two. Ends with MVP getting his ""drive-by"" kick after a missed Swanton Bomb splash from Jeff Hardy.

Kofi Kingston & Mickie James Vs. Santino Marrella & Beth Phoenix (Intergender I-C/Women's Title Match) - Basically, the rules of this match were that whoever got the pinfall or submission would win the titles for their team. Nothing spectacular but it did provide some comedy from Marrella and great athleticism from both James and Kingston. Ends when Beth takes advantage of a distracted Mickie with her double-arm chicken wing slam for the pin and the titles.

Shawn Michaels Announcement - Total filler and a total waste of two great talents. I didn't even bother watching this one.

Matt Hardy Vs. Mark Henry (ECW Title Match) - This match is proof where ECW ranks in WWE. Only 20 seconds?! Come on, I know Mark Henry isn't that good but damn!? Even he deserved better than this and so does Matt! Ends in a DQ when Hardy has Henry beat for the title but Tony Atlas causes a DQ. Jeff Hardy comes down to even the odds after the match and probably the only exciting part of this match!

C.M. Punk Vs. JBL (World Heavyweight Title Match) - I didn't have much hope for this one but near the end it actually got good. There is one nasty sequence where Punk countered JBL's ""clothesline from hell"" with a side kick but as JBL went down, the back of their heads cracked together, causing a nasty gash on Punk's head! Ouch!

Ends with a surprise win for Punk! I am glad to see it for the simple reason he needed a legit win for his title reign.

Triple H Vs. The Great Khali (WWE Title Match) - Let me say from the jump that Khali is one of the worst big men ever to wrestle! That being said, I have to give HHH credit for even carrying him to a decent match! Definitely one of the better bouts I've seen Khali in. Ends with an amazing Pedigree on the ""Pujabi Nightmare"" for the win.

John Cena Vs. Batista - This match, which was their first one on one meeting ever in WWE, was very much hyped. I saw some signs during the match that said ""Match Of The Year."" I don't know what crack they were smoking. I think it could win the category of ""Most Anticipated Match Of The Year"" but not ""MOTY""!

That being said, this is another that turned out better than expected. While they used power moves, as expected, they used some wrestling surprisingly, particularly in submissions. Cena with the STFU, Batista with a body-scissors/chokehold and a figure-four leglock (which was an obvious nod to his mentor ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair)!

Ends when Batista gets the pin after two Batista Bombs on Cena! Surprisingly good match in my view! Not a classic by any means but more than I expected from these two.

The Undertaker Vs. Edge (Hell In The Cell) - These two have had classics everytime out this year and this match is no exception. While it wasn't the bloodbath that HITC's usually are, they did a lot of other things that made up for it. Edge, particuarlly, was doing a lot of high spots. Ends when UT uses his signature Tombstone piledriver on Edge for the win after UT did a lot of Edge's signature moves on him (including the spear tackle and the conchairto)!

Overall, I didn't feel I wasted my money. This SummerSlam, while not the best ever, was better than I gave it a chance to be. While it isn't a card I'd go out and buy right away, it is worth a purchase, especially if you bought the recent SummerSlam set. Anyway, a pretty good card.",1219190400,2,3677,4.391176470588236
1069127,5,6305710473,"I have thought long and hard about how I should rate this PPV.  Really, it got a 5 star because of one match, the main event, the Hell in a Cell between The Undertaker and The Rated R Superstar, Edge.  Up until that we saw a couple different title changes and some lackluster matches.  The night starting off with the MVP vs Jeff Hardy match was actually very good.  They both have great chemistry together.  Then, fast forward to the three title matches.  First, the ECW between Mark Henry and Matt Hardy.  This had the potential to be a great match as Mark Henry is big and strong and Matt Hardy is one of the best technically sound guys now.  Then, when Tony Atlas got involved leading to a DQ, it just goes to show how little faith WWE puts into its ECW brand.  Matt Hardy would be a great champion.  Then, the WWE Championship between HHH and The Great Khali.  This went on a little longer than I thought as Khali isn't good in the ring.  However, it wasn't a terrible match.  I was happy to see HHH nail the pedigree for the win.  Then, the CM Punk vs JBL.  I really enjoyed this match as Punk is a great worker and JBL can make a lot of people look good.  It got a little scary when CM Punk was busted open hardway from JBL's big head.  But he pulled off to legitimize his title reign.  Those were all the mid card of the night.  After those, we had the John Cena vs Batista.  This went back and forth and I got really into the match as I was impartial to who won.  When Batista pulled off the victory, I loved the catching power bomb he did to Cena and was happy to see him victorious.  (I know i left out a few matches and segments)  Then it was Hell In A cell.  My first thought on this match was how tall the Cell was compared to other nights, so I was worried if they'd go on top as I know Edge is good for his high spots.  No matter how long or what reason Taker leaves for, his returns are always amazing and heart stopping.  I loved it when Edge saw Taker, he had to move off camera as he was smiling and just enjoying the aura of the night.  All in all, violent match, taker cut his arm pretty good and Edge took a gash to the back and a welt to his side.  Great finish with Taker winning with a huge Tombstone.  Of course, throwing him through the ring and lighting it on fire was cool, but took away from the match a little bit.  I guess that's a good way to buy Edge time off.  PPV was great and absolutely better than last year.",1219104000,,2448,4.0480167014613775
1069128,3,6305710473,"I watched this Summerslam on PPV last night when it aired, and it was an alright PPV. Here is how I rate the matches.

Jeff Hardy vs MVP-It was a good opening match that got the show rolling pretty well. The match overall was decent. 3/5

MVP wins

Winner Takes All Match, Mickie James and Kofi Kingston vs Beth Phoenix and Santino Marella-No where close to good. Boring match all the way through and short. I expected it to be atleast a little bit better. 1/5

Beth and Santino win, New Champs

HBK's retirement announcement-Very surprising, HBK announces retirement and Jericho comes out and ends up hitting HBK's wife by accident! I won't be surprised if HBK stays for 1 final fight. (Not a Match-No Rating)

Matt Hardy vs Mark Henry (ECW Championship)-Matt Hardy within 20 seconds hits the Twist of Fate and had the win when Tony Atlas pulls him out of the ring to get Mark Henry DQ'ed. Atlas attacks Matt and Jeff Hardy runs out to his brothers aid and they double suplex Mark Henry. Henry retains title, Hardy gets win. 1/5

CM Punk vs JBL (World Heavyweight Championship)- A pretty good match, not that long, and not close to what I expected. Still a good match. 3

CM Punk Wins, Retains

Triple H vs The Great Khali (WWE Championship)-Decent Match. Overall not that great. Khali puts in holds and the Khali Vice Grip throughout the whole match.

Triple H Wins, Retains

John Cena vs Batista-Good overall match, not as good as expected. Decent throughout and than good at the end. 3.5/5

Batista Wins

MAIN EVENT-Undertaker vs Edge (Hell In A Cell)-Basically one of the greatest matches ever! Edge came into the match with a sadistic attitude and made it a hell of a match. Action spills to outside of the ring when cell breaks in one section. Undertaker dismantles Edge at the end even though Edge put on a show. Undertaker and Edge really brang down the house as the whole match was unpredictable and the end was amazing. 5/5

Undertaker Wins

Overall a good, but not great, PPV. I was expecting it to be ALOT better. Unless you get it for cheap, I wouldn't get it, even though the HITC match was great, they have a Hell In A Cell match DVD coming soon that Edge/Undertaker will probably be on.",1219017600,4,2203,4.541772151898734
1069129,4,6305710473,"I wrote a review of this show after it first aired on ppv, and while I normally watch every ppv twice before I review it, I did not like this show enough that I just wrote a review right away.  However, I very recently watched this show again, and I must say I was totally wrong in my first review of this show, because it was actually an exceptional wrestling event.  Therefore, I deleted that first review entirely and I am now penning a brand new review of this ppv.  I don't know why I hated this show so much when I first saw it, but I must admit upon second viewing I think this ppv is definitely worth adding to your collection.  Matches are rated out of 5 stars (*****).

1. MVP vs. Jeff Hardy

Good opener, definitely worth a look.  Maybe not as good as some of the television matches between Jeff Hardy and Shelton Benjamin but this was a great way to start the show.  ***

2. Intergender tag team match for the Intercontinental and Women's championships
Kofi Kingston (c) & Mickie James (c) vs. Santino Marella & Beth Phoenix

Not bad for what it was, as there was some decent stuff.  Santino is always good for a laugh and this wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  Still no classic I assure you.  *1/2

We then had a great segment with Shawn Michaels and his wife Rebecca that had Shawn announcing his retirement, which led to an appearance by Chris Jericho, who struck Rebecca in the mouth (good and proper, I might add, he really got her good).  As great as this segment was, and the acting for all 3 really was superb, I am not a fan in the slightest of having these segments on ppv.  This definitely belonged on Raw, and it's also a shame that two great talents such as Michaels and Jericho did not actually wrestle on this show.  As I said though, the segment was fantastic.

3. ECW Championship Match
Mark Henry (c) w/ Tony Atlas vs. Matt Hardy

This was offensive.  The match lasted 31 seconds before Tony Atlas got Mark Henry intentionally Disqualified.  Just garbage, do not waste your time.  DUD

4. World Heavyweight Championship Match
CM Punk (c) vs. John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield

A lot of people liked this match, and I cannot say I am one of them.  It was not by any means a bad match, but it was not what I would call a particularly good World Heavyweight Title match.  It certainly had its moments, and overall the match was solid, maybe slightly above average, but it's not what I would consider a must see.  Still a pretty good match though.  **1/2

5. WWE Championship Match
Triple H (c) vs. Great Khali

Not as bad as you would think going in, but believe me, you'll probably want to skip this.  The only real noteworthy thing about this match was Triple H's selling...I have never seen Triple H sell this much for anybody, maybe ever, and he did do a good job of making Khali look like a monster.  All you need to know is Triple H retained, thank god, and that the match is not as bad as it could have been.  If you want to give it a look, it's certainly not unwatchable.  *3/4

6. Batista vs. John Cena

The first time I watched this match, I didn't like it at all.  However, upon second viewing, I thought this was a really good match.  Lots of back and forth action and the match had a good pace.  Crowd at first didn't react much to either man, but once the match started they were pulling pretty hard for Batista and booing Cena.  I must say though there was a spot where both men were performing submission moves and I think Lou Thesz rolled over in his grave.  Anyway, the match also had a truly superb finish that had the fans really on their feet.  This was a great match, I would almost say shockingly great considering who was in it.  Definitely should have been at Wrestlemania, though.  ***3/4

7. Hell in a Cell
The Undertaker vs. Edge

This was a truly fantastic match, and one of the best Hell in a Cell matches I've ever seen.  I would go as far to say that this is a candidate for best WWE match of the year.  Lots of great spots with a great finish and great aftermath.  This was the best possible way to end this show, and the feud between the Undertaker and Edge.  ****1/4

I truly cannot understand how I did not like this show when I first saw it.  Between the first and second viewings it was like night and day, and it made me realize why it's important to watch everything twice before you review it (which I normally do).  This was a great show that I would highly recommend adding to your WWE DVD collection.",1219017600,,4476,4.291866028708134

1069183,3,6305710473,"Too Cool & Rikishi VS Right To Censor: I use to hate Right to Censor. This was a decent six man tag match but nothing really speical.

Road Dogg VS X-Pac: I could careless about Road Dogg. X-Pac was a good wrestler but whatever happened to him? Besides the sex tape with Chyna.

Intercontinental Champion Val Venis & Trish Stratus VS Eddie Guerrero & Chyna: Where does this PPV take off? A good match but not the best. Trish was still green.

Tazz VS Jerry ""The King"" Lawler: Tazz was never really that good in the land of giants. This is Lawler's yearly WWF match.

Shane McMahon VS Steve Blackman: Here is where the PPV takes off. Shane O'Mac always put on a great match. Loved the ending.

TLC Match- Tag Team Champions Edge & Christian VS Dudley Boyz VS Hardy Boyz: Everyone who loves wrestling has seen this match at least once before. This is one of the greatest matches in the history of the WWF/WWE and in all of wrestling. Must see

Chris Jericho VS Chris Benoit(RIP): Excellent, fast paced match.

Thong Stinkface Match- Bathroom, restroom, or snack break.

Undertaker VS Kane: Not really a match, just a brawl with no clear winner.

WWF Champion The Rock VS Triple H VS Kurt Angle: Hated the story of the match. Reminded me of the TNA Hard Justice 2007 match of Angle VS Joe winner take all, but instead of Angle being smitten with Stephanie, it was his with own wife. A bad main event and a bad way to end a so-so Summerslam.

The middle of the event-Hardcore match, TLC match, and Best of 2-3 Falls match were the only reason to own this PPV. Main event was disappointing.",1210464000,,1585,4.43448275862069
1069184,4,6305710473,"Too Cool & Rikishi vs. Right To Censor - This was a good opener as the crowd loves to see the RTC get beat up.  This was right around when the Godfather joined & became the Goodfather so Rikishi came out with his former ""hos""...one who just happened to be the diva currently known as Victoria.

Road Dogg vs. X-Pac - This was a match to kill off whatever was left of D-Generation X and it was an decent match to watch but nothing really special or memorable.

Intercontinental Champion Val Venis & Trish Stratus vs. Eddie Guerrero & Chyna - This was the an intergender tag team match with the stipulation that whoever beats either Val or Trish becomes the I.C. Champion.  This was a real good match here as all four worked well together.  This was back when Trish was only hired for her looks & not training in the ring yet so her work is very limited but everyone did their job & the match came together well.

Tazz vs. Jerry ""The King"" Lawler - It's amazing how in less than a year, Tazz went from a big debut breaking Kurt Angle's undefeated streak to being the villian against a color commentator.  Tazz for the most part kept taunting Jim Ross thoughout the entire match based off his involvement in this angle & it was put to a poetic finish in the end with Jim Ross getting involved.

Hardcore Champion Shane McMahon vs. Steve Blackman - This wasn't the Shane McMahon type match that we've seen him have with the likes of X-Pac or Kurt Angle but it was mostly him running away from Blackman while T&A (Test & Albert) were trying to beat up Blackman for Shane.  The only memorable highlight was Shane McMahon taking an unbelievable backwards fall off the top of the set to the floor before Blackman dropped an elbow on him.

TLC Match: Tag Team Champions Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz - The first TLC match and this was the one that topped their WrestleMania match months earlier. Again, this is one of those matches that I can't describe in words that you just have to watch.

(Also available on ""The Ladder Match"")

2 Out of 3 Falls Match: Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit - A technical classic here between these two.  Unfortunally, this match gets overshadowed by their earlier & later matches throughout the WWF but you know you can never go wrong with these two in the same match.

Thong Stinkface Match: The T&A (I don't mean Test & Albert this time) segment of the night that wasn't really anything special past seeing these two in skimpy bikinis.

Undertaker vs. Kane - This was probably one of their weakest matches as it was just an out of control brawl with Taker trying to rip off Kane's mask before Kane backed off & ran away.  Again, just a brawl & doesn't live up to their previous encounters.

WWF Champion The Rock vs. Triple H vs. Kurt Angle -

Triple H stated on his ""That Damn Good"" DVD that this was the most unusual match he's been in. It's more like HHH vs. The Rock featuring Kurt Angle because Kurt gets beat up & carried to the back before the match really starts. On the ""Don't Try This At Home"" promos before the start of any WWE video, you'll see a part where HHH tries to pedigree someone on a table but it breaks...this is where that clip came from. HHH & Rock go at it but after this, Kurt comes back & gets involved in the last 5 mins. along with Stephanie McMahon. Again, this match was unusual but every entertaining.

(Also available on Triple H ""That Damn Good"" & ""History Of The WWE Championship"")

This was one of the best PPV's from the year 2000 as it had a solid card from top to bottom.  I recommend.",1181001600,2,3566,4.364599092284418
1069185,5,6305710473,"Im sure you know the scale 1-10 by now so lets get started.

Six Man Tag Match
Right TO Censor Vs. Too Cool and Rikishi

This was a pretty good opener for summerslam 2000.  Even though most parts it was boring i thought they tried hard to entertain.  Winner: Right to Censor. 6/10

Single Match
X-Pac Vs. Road Dog

This match was a little bit better than the first match.  They can also be boring but this match was good.  They did alot of moves i was not expecting them to do.  Road dog tried to do a pump handle slam for the win but X-Pac comes back.  Winner: X-Pac.  6.5/10

Intercontinental Championship Mixed Tag Match
Trish and Val Venis VS. Eddie Guerrero and Chyna

This match was a pretty good match.  It is funny because of the Story-Line Eddie loves China but in this match he wants to win.(We all miss Eddie)  They tag each other and pretty short match.  Then Chyna pins Trish for the win.  It is funny because Eddie wanted to win but Chyna did.  Eddie still liked Chyna.  Winner:  Chyna  7/10

Single match
Taz VS. Jerry ""The King"" Lawyer

This match had a pretty good story line about Jr. and King hatting Taz.  It was about Taz knocking out the window of the limo and glass getting in Jr.'s eye.  King gets in the and they start to wrestle throughout the match Taz keeps calling Jr. a redneck.  King hits a nice Piledriver in this match and does better than i thought.  Another reason Jr. and King hate taz is because he is from ECW.  I love ECW and still like Jr. and King still i don't care.  But then Taz is Chocking out King and Jr. gets up and hits him with a candy jar glass in Taz's head.  Then King pins him for the win.  SOme people would of thought this match was boring but i liked it.  Winner:  Jerry Lawyer  8/10

Hardcore Championship Match
Shane McMahon VS. Steve Blackman

This was all out for me the awesome match this night.  They start of with steve trying to hit shane with a kindo stick.  Then they get in the crowd and fight with a trash can.  Then Steve jumps off the stands and hits Shane with the trashcan in the head.  They get back in the ring with alot of weapons.  Then Test and Albert come to the ring and help out Shane.  Shane hits steve with a sign right in the face and is awesome.  Then they go to the stage where they come out and fight up there.  Then Steve hits Test and Albert and knocks them out.  Then Shane climbs the Stage Structure and goes 50-75 ft. in the air.  Steve follows with a kindo stick.  When he gets up there he hits Shane in the leg and shane falls 50-75 ft. off the structure to the stage!!!  Then Blackman comes down and hits an  elbow off the structure to Shane and Picks up the win.  Winner:  Steve Blackman  10/10

Two out of Three falls match all single
Chris Benoit VS. Chris Jericho

This match is a good clean awesome match if you like that.  The crowd is still so pumped of what they just saw from Shane and Steves hardcore match which you have to see to believe that no one in the crowd at first cares about this match to much.  Then the crowd gets involved more.  They are so many suspenful parts in this match.  Good wrestling.  Chris Benoit pins Jericho 2-1 for the win.  Winner:  Chris Benoit  7/10

World Tag Team Championship TLC Match
Edge&Christian VS. Dudleys Vs. Hardys

This was an awesome match.  I want tell you everything but i will tell you most parts. Jeff falls off a ladder that hits Matt in the face.  3d through a table.  Matt falls backwards off a ladder through a table.  Jeff does a leg drop over the ladder jumping off the turnbuckle.  Jeff does a Swantom off a ladder on the outside but Bubba moves so Jeff hits and goes through the table and what impact.  Jeff and D-Von hold on to the titles and the ladder falls so Jeff kicks D-von off the ladder and falls far and hits the ring hard.  Everyone chanted Hardys because that is there home town. Then Edge and Christian throw a ladder at him and he falls off.  Then they get a ladder and get the belts.  Winners:Edge&Christian. 10/10

Stink Face Match
Terri VS. The Kat

The only reason i like this match is because of the laddies.  The Kat stinks face terri for the win.
Winner:The Kat 6/10

Single Match
Undertaker VS. Kane

This match never got started but good outside wrestling.  They go in the ring and fight but then undertaker rips off Kanes mask and kane runs leaving it nobody the winner.  But good story line about kane turning against the Undertaker and chockslaming him through the ring.  Good fighting.  Winner: No one  8/10

WWE Championship Triple Threat Match No Dq at first
The Rock VS. Kurt Angle Vs Triple H

This match had a good storyline to it about Kurt and Stephanie.  First Kurt comes out and talks about Steph and then Triple H comes out.  They throw fist then go outside and Triple H puts kurt on the spanish announce table.  Then when The Game Tries the Pedigree the table gives causing Kurts face to go right in the table really hurting him and he is out like a light.  You can tell the Game was asking Kurt are you alright?  Then The Game goes for a sledge and gets it then the rocks music hits.  He comes and they fight in the ring while Kurt talks to medical people.  Then Kurt goes backstage and the rock and the game fight now 1 on 1.  Then later Kurt comes back out for Steph and fights.  Good match too.  The rock pulls off with the win.  Winner:The rock  9.5/10

So that raps up this pay per view summerslam 2000.  If you do not have this you need to get this.  One of the best ever PPV ever in the History of the wwe.  You will be glad you saw it.  Thanks for your time and keep it real yall.",1149292800,7,5589,4.206831119544592
1069186,4,6305710473,"Even though there were a few things here & there that may not sit to well with certain fans, this was one of the better events from 2000 that the WWF actually put out & was a worthy edition of the biggest event of the summer.

Rikishi & Too Cool vs Right To Censor. This was a good opener as the crowd was really into the fact that the RTC members were getting beat up with an interesting fact that one of the girls that came out with Rikishi & Too Cool was actually the future Women's Champion Victoria.

X-Pac vs Road Dogg. This was the match that was there to kill the whole DX storyline but this was just a decent match for what it was & nothing more.

Intercontinental Champion Val Venis & Trish Stratus vs Eddie Guerrero & Chyna. This was a solid match as Guerrero & Venis always worked very well with each other just like they did at King of the Ring earlier in the year while Chyna held her own in the ring but Trish was limited at this point since this was the time before she became an active competitor.

Jerry Lawler vs Tazz. It's shocking to think that Tazz went from ending Kurt Angle's undefeated streak to now feuding with the King & Jim Ross. Anyways, this was entertaining for what it was as Tazz was just yelling at Jim Ross throughout the match with Lawler getting some offense in before Jim Ross got off his announce table to hit Tazz in the head with his jar of candy.

Hardcore Champion Shane McMahon vs Steve Blackman. This wasn't on the level of Shane's classic matches with Test or Kurt Angle as he was mostly running away from Blackman & taking a beating with trash cans, kendo sticks & even a leather belt before Test & Albert came out to assist Shane in attacking Blackman. The real highlight of this match was when Shane took a fall backwards off the SummerSlam platform that really needs to be seen to be believed.

Two out of Three Falls: Chris Jericho vs Chris Benoit. This was a great technical match but then again, when did these two ever have a bad match against one another? This isn't on the level of their previous & future encounters in the WWF but these two still put on a great performance here in another high quality match.

TLC Match: WWF Tag Team Champions Edge & Christian vs Dudley Boyz vs Hardy Boyz. This was the match that stole the show & the match that topped their previous WrestleMania encounter. Moment's include Jeff flying off a ladder onto another ladder with the leg of the ladder hitting Matt in the face, Hardyz going for ""poetry in motion"" but Jeff getting a ladder thrown into his face, Christian taking the Bubba bomb off the top of the ladder, the uses of tables like the 3D to Christian & Jeff going for a Swanton off the ladder but only getting the table, Lita getting involved & taking a sick spear on the floor by Edge, Bubba taking the ""ride to hell"" from the top of the ladder through four tables & Jeff & D-Von fighting from the belt hooks before Edge & Christian took advantage of the situation to retain their titles.

Thong Stinkface Match: The Kat vs Terri. This was the T/A segment of the night & nothing more pass that.

The Undertaker vs Kane. Just a brawl between both men with Taker going after Kane's mask to the point where he ripped a part of it in order to bust him open with the steel steps & eventually ripping the mask off of Kane's face that lead to Kane running away from the match. It wasn't close to their best encounter but I thought it was better than their WrestleMania XX match.

WWF Champion The Rock vs Triple H vs Kurt Angle. Angle & Triple H wasted no time as they got into a brawl before The Rock even came out to start the match that lead to the infamous footage of the announce table spot being botched to the point where Angle suffered a legit concussion. From there, Rock & Triple H did their best & delivered the best match possible until Kurt was able to get back into the action during the last 5 minutes along with Stephanie McMahon. This was an unusual but very entertaining main event that did it's job in pushing the HHH/Angle/Stephanie feud.

DVD extras include the SummerSlam promo along with the making of that commercial, the WWF superstars going to a baseball game & the television ad for the main event.

Overall, this was one of the best events from 2000 as most of the matches here where solid to enjoyable with the main highlight sticking out being the TLC match as that was one of the best matches of the year so I recommend this event.",1136419200,,4460,4.33453237410072

Match # 2 Road Dogg vs. X-Pac: Another poor match...don't have to say much here...X-Pac wins. 5/10

Match #3 Intergender Tag match for the IC Title Chyna and Eddie Guererro vs. Val Venis (c) and Trish Startus: This actually wasn't too bad, except for the ending. Val tried to stay in the whole match, but ended up tagging in Trish and she was pummeled by Chyna. Chyna wins the title...if they were gonna give it to someone new, it should have been Eddie. Val Venis joins RTC sometime after this...7/10

Match #4 Tazz vs. Jerry Lawler: This was GREAT!!! King pile drives Tazz! Tazz looks in the Tazzmission but then JR to the rescue...he braks a glass candy jar over Tazz's head giving King the pin. 8/10

Match #5 Steve Blackman vs. Shane McMahon (c) for the Hardcore Title: This was also a decent match...but I've never been a fan of Steve Blackman so it did nothing for me. Shane O'Mac is the MAN and took one of the sickest bumps EVER in this match!!! You have to see it! Blackman wins. 8/10

Match #6 Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho best 2/3 falls: If only this was about 5 minutes longer it would have been one of the greatest matches ever!!! Benoit makes Jericho submit, Jericho makes Benoit submit, then Benoit reverses a roll up and grabs the ropes to get the third fall! AWESOME! Benoit WINS!!! 10/10

Match #7 E & C (c) vs. The Dudleyz vs. The Hardyz in a TLC match for the WWF Tag Team titles: This was a TLC match so ofcourse it was good! Don't really remember too many highlights, but E & C retain! This was billed as the first ever TLC match but we all know that the match at WM 16 was basically the same thing. 9/10

Match #8 Terri w/ Perry Saturn vs. The Kat w/ Al Snow in a Thong Stinkface match: Who was the heel and face here? Anyways, TOTAL & utter CRAP!!! Kat stinkfaces terri which was garbage...Terri is so much HOTTER!!! 2/10

Match #9 Undertaker vs. Kane: This sucked! The match never even started and it was a no contest. Taker rips Knae's mask off, but you can clearly see no burns or sacrs or anything wrong with his face, HAHA! 5/10

Match #10 The Rock (c) vs. HHH vs. Kurt Angle for the WWF Title: AWESOME!!! This was a great match! We should have known Rock would retain because Kurt and HHH were just thrown in here due to the Stephanie love triangle. Kurt was taken out by HHH before the match even started! Rock and HHH put on a great clinic until Stephania brought Kurt back out to help HHH. But Kurt ""shocked"" everyone by trying to get the title himself (haha). The ending was great where HHH went to hit Kurt, but knocked Steph out instead. Then Kurt knocked HHH out the the sledgehammer. Rock takes out Kurt and gets the pin after the people's elbow! Rock retains and Kurt carries Stephanie off into the sunset, LMAO! 10/10 one of the most entertaining matches I've ever seen!

1069314,5,6305710473,"Summerslam was one of the best Summerslam's in quite some time.

Wow, this ppv was incredible. The last classic WWF ppv before the WWF acquired WCW and ECW. This one had it all.

The ppv features the first Tables, ladders and chairs match, the appearence of the pretty Kat before she was released by the WWF, another return of the Kane vs. Undertaker rivalry,

a rare match with Jerry Lawler and a triple threat match for the WWF championship. Whew!!!

Every match was great and hard fought especially that classic TLC that will stand the test of time as one of the best matches ever with the Hardy, Edge and Christain and the Dudley

Boys.

First match was Right to Censor against Too Cool and Rikishi. A pretty good match, with the former ho's of the Goodfather involved. Overall a decent match.

Second Road Dog vs. X-PAC. The beginning of the end for DX as we know it. Road Dog and X-PAC's days in the WWF after this would be numbered and both do a pretty good show.

Third match.

Chyna and Eddie Guerrero vs. Val Venis and Trish Stratus. One of the first matches with Trish Stratus formerly a valet for Test and Albert. Trish doesn't do much and it's obvious she is

no match for Chyna, but Trish had massive sex appeal despite her limited wrestling talent and that WWF was able to cut her slack for this.

Val Venis has to defend his Intercontinendtal Title against two opponents in this match which was unfair, the outcome is obvious.

Fourth Match

Classic Hardcore match with Shane McMahon vs. Steve Blackman. Wow, one of the best hardcore matches in history. A 10 out of 10. Blackman was tough one of the underrated wrestlers in the WWF. Not too much personality but a hard worker. Shane could wrestle and fight despite the fact that he cheated with Edge and Christain's help to get the title. Blackman puts up a superman human effort hear.

A must see match.

Fifth match

Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho.

The early part of this rivalry leading to Royal Rumble 2001.

Chris Benoit is the best technical wrestler in the WWE today.

He finally won the World Heavyweight Title in 2004 after

four tough years in the WWF. Jericho in the next year would

be the first Undisputed Champion. The contest the two put

is a classic.

The Kat vs. Terri Runnels in a stinkface match. LOL

The Kat is one of the prettiest divas in the WWF, the WWF

though was heading in a new direction with younger stars like

Trish Stratus and Molly Holly. She and Terri put one hot

match for us to remember.

Tables , Ladders and Chairs match oh my!!

Famous TLC Edge and Christian vs. The Hardy's vs. Dudleys for the Tag Team Titles.

The Tag Team titles are suspended in the air while all three teams beat the hell out of each other and use the ladders and tables to win.

WWF Championship

The Rock vs. Triple H vs. Kurt Angle.

This was when Triple H was married to Stephanie McMahon and

began the McMahon-Helmsley era which is ironic because they

are now married in real life.

Great match though Kurt Angle gets knocked out of the competition early the Rock, and Triple H give us a great show,

where anyone could have won.

Kurt Angle vs. Triple H vs. The Rock was a great Triple Threat Match and the real issue was between HHH & Angle but still it was a great match with The Rock retaining his belt.

Rikishi & Too Cool V. Right To Censor

A pretty good opener because it was short. RTC wins. **1/2

X-Pac V. Road Dogg

This match could have been better. The crowd was behind the Road Dogg the whole time, but JR & the King said that the crowd was spilt. X-Pac wins. **

Intergender Tag Team Match for the Intercontinental Championship:

Val Venis (Champion) & Trish V. Eddie Guerrero & Chyna

Umm...ok? the Intercontinental Title is on the line in an intergender match? Give me a break; and Chyna wins?.. What the hell? I thought that the WWF had learned by now? This match was alright. Thank god it was short. **1/4

Jerry Lawler V. Tazz

This match had a good little storyline to it. The King won when JR breaks a glass jar over Tazz's head. *3/4

WWF Hardcore Championship:

Shane McMahon (Champion) V. Steve Blackman

Good hardcore match, could have been better. Shane falls on the stage. This was the first time he had done that, however Blackman wins the title. *** Oh my god, it took the fifth match to get a three star match? That's not good

2-Out-Of-3-Falls Match:

Chris Benoit V. Chris Jericho

Tables, Ladder, & Chairs Match for the WWF Tag Team Championship:

Edge & Christian (Champions) V. The Hardyz V. The Dudleyz

I really never liked this match until I actually sat down and watched it, and it's awesome. I'm a wrestling guy, not a hardcore guy, but this match was just great with some sick bumps. *****. I think it won match of the year in 2000.

Thong Stinkface Match:

The Kat V. Terri

Can you say more buyrates anyone? Kat wins. DUD

The Undertaker V. Kane

This match wasn't even a match, it was a 15 minutes brawl with the bell not sounding. I think it's stupid. The brawl was somewhat good, but it was just a waste of time and I can't even rate it because it wasn't a match and I don't see why?

Triple Threat Match for the WWF Championship:

The Rock (Champion) V. Triple H V. Kurt Angle

The real issue real is between Angle & HHH, but they needed to put the WWF Champion on the show somehow. This match was good except for one thing...Angle was in the match for only three minutes. What's wrong with Angle that they only put him in the match for three minutes? This was suppose to be Angle's first main event and it did nothing for him. This match was a one on one match until the last three minutes. The Rock wins and this match wasn't as great as people say it was. ***1/2. The good thing is that Kurt wins his first WWF Championship two months later in my State Capitol of Albany! and Steph gets knocked out by Triple H!

Overall, a pretty underwhelming show. The Tag Team Championship and the 2-Out-Of-3 Falls match makes this show memorable and that's about it.",1096588800,,2908,4.44234404536862

1069319,5,6305710473,"Now even though the year 2000 had some good ppvs; like wrestlmania, royal rumble, and armageddon, this is still the best of them all. Each match was entertaining, although some are a lot better than others. Three matches will be remembered for the rest of wwe history, and this DVD is definately worth your money.

The opener has Too Cool and Rikishi vs. Right To Censor: This was a good match, not too long, yet the ending was kinda of a cheap one as Steven Richars kicks Scotty 2 Hotty in the face. The two women at ringside are sort of fun to watch because they try to hit the members of RTC when they fall out of the ring. A decent opener. 7.5/10

X-Pac vs. Road Dogg: Come on, this match could have been way better than what it was. These two have so much talent, yet they are no longer in the WWE. Road Dogg is on TNA and X-Pac has disappeared. The crowd was kinda dead in this one. 7/10

Shane McMahon vs. Steve Blackman: A good hardcore match, even Test and Albert didn't mess it up. Trash cans, trash can lids, street signs, and kendo sticks were used. The ending was good as Shane falls 60 feet from the top of the stage set. Then Blackman jumps 40 feet above right onto him. A great match. 8/10

The King vs. Tazz: This was the right amount of time in my opinion, and JR was great when he smashed the glass jar on Tazz's head. The crowd woke up after 5 minutes in this one. A good match yet sort of a card filler. 7.5/10

Val Venis and Trish vs. Eddie and Chyna: This was a good card filler and Chyna becomes champion. Trish looked good in this match, I'm not talking about wrestling, and Eddie looked good too, I am talking about wrestling. A good entertaining match where a female becomes intercontinental champion. 8/10

The Undertaker vs. kane: This was a good brawl, some weapons were used, and the intensity was good also. The Undertaker continued to go for kane's mask for payback after what Kane did to him a few weeks prior to it. The Undertaker eventually grabs the mask off and wins since kane refused to fight. 8/10

Thong stink face match: A waste of good time. Terri looked good though, yet Perry Saturn wrecked a lot of moments in this match. Only okay if you watch it everyonce in a while. 6/10

Triple Threat match for the wwf championship: An awsome match, Kurt and Triple H fight before the match even starts and Triple H tries to pedigree Kurt on the announce table, but it breaks under their weight. Then the rock comes out and its him and Triple H fighting during most of the match. Then Stephanie drags kurt back out and thats when everyone gets hit by either the sledgehammer or each other. The ending is great also. 10/10

First Ever Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match: This was off the page. All three teams took risks no one would even dream of back then. The Hardy boys really shine in this match as they take some of the biggest bumps ever [When Jeff did the Swantan Bomb off the 20 foot ladder and when Matt fell backwards off the ladder through two tables.} When the Dudley boys bring out the tables, that is when the match really goes to another level. Even Lita gets involved when she pushes Edge and Christian off the 20 foot ladder. At the end the crowd gives them all a standing ovation which is rightfully deserved. When Jeff and  D-von are on the ladder that is a great suspensful moment. 15/10

1069361,5,6305710473,"Next to Wrestlemania 17, Summerslam 2000 has to be the best show the WWE ever had. The card was extremely well rounded and I enjoyed every match. For those fans who are into the classic technical style of wrestling, you cannot beat the 2 out 3 falls match between Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit. Perhaps the best match of the night was the first ever Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match between Edge and Christian, The Dudley's, and the Hardy Boys. This match was filled non-stop action from beginning to end. This match brought the term ""hardcore"" to a whole new level. Another great hardcore match pitted Steve Blackman vs Shane McManon for the Hardcore Title. The match went back and forth to the very end. It also features perhaps one of the craziest spots I have ever seen, with Shane leaping off the Titan Tron 50 ft in the air. For those fans who just like to see an all out brawl, Undertaker vs Kane was very enjoyable. The main event for the WWE title between The Rock, Kurt Angle, and Triple H was extremely well done. Each wrestler put on one hell of a performance. They all had very good chemistry together in the ring.
If you are a WWE fan, there is no way you can pass this up. Summerslam 2000 was seriously one of the best WWE shows I have ever seen. The DVD extras are also pretty good as well.

1069362,5,6305710473,"This was one of the better PPVs that Ive seen.  Also, the live audience was incredibly into almost all of the matches.  It makes watching a little bit more interesting when the crowd responds to the action.  The crowd was very into it, and  it was interesting to see how much they responded to some wrestlers.

Right To Censor Vs Too Cool / Rikishi:  When I started watching wrestling, it was in the fall of 2000.  I never saw too much of interest from any of these guys, but the audience was very hot for the action, actively booing RTC and cheering heavily for Rikishi.  The match itself was decent, not worth the audience reaction it got.  Ive seen better opening matches.
X-Pac Vs Road Dogg:  At the time, Road Dogg and X-Pac were members of Degeneration X but were beginning to feud because of an incident in a tag team match where Road Dogg left X-Pac to be taken out.  The match had some entertaining spots, but as a whole it was short and under-whelming.

Mixed Tag Match Val Venis (C) &Trish Stratus  Vs Chyna &Eddie Guerrero: Venis was the Intercontinental Champion, but the stipulation was that if either Chyna or Eddie got the pin (even if it was on Trish), that individual would win the belt.  I was rather bored for this match.  The only thing that interested me was watching Eddie wrestle, but this was fairly blah and ended exactly how you would expect.
Tazz Vs Jerry ""the King""Lawer:  This was junk.  While Lawler is rightly a legend in the business, he fails to entertain in the ring (or as an announcer).  As it stands, this match was more about Tazz and J.R. than it was about the ringwork.

The Kat Vs Terri Thong Stink Face Match:  Even worse than the last match.  This has no place in wrestling as there was no actual wrestling.
Shane (C)Vs Blackman Hardcore Title Match:  For a man who is not an everyday wrestler, Shane McMahon never fails to entertain when he steps in the ring.  Steve Blackman, amazingly enough, also did a good job at working this match and entertaining.  The big thing about this match is the fall Shane took off a 50ft support tower and the elbow Blackman followed that fall with.

TLC Match Hardys Vs Dudleys Vs Edge&Christian (c) for the Tag Team Championship:  This was the very first Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match.  Like the 4 that I have seen, it was incredible.  The risks that these men take to entertainunbelievable.
Two out of Three Falls Chris Jericho vs Chris Benoit:  This was one of the better feuds that I can remember.  Jericho and Benoit have always worked well together, and had there not been a TLC match, this would have been the match of the night.

Undertaker vs Kane:  The Undertaker took off Kanes mask.  Junk match.
Triple Threat for the WWF Championship - The Rock (c) Vs Kurt Angle vs Triple H:  Its hard to get excited for the main event match when it feels like a sideshow the the Kurt Angle/Stephanie McMahon/HHH love triangle.  The match itself was quite good, but it even in the wrestling, it played second fiddle to the story.  Very good match, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations (perhaps unreasonably high.

Too Cool & Rikishi v.s. Right To Censor
A six-man tag team match opens SummerSlam 2000 with the always entertaining Too Cool & Rikishi against the always annoying RTC. Not a bad match at all, but a good/disappointing ending. **3/4
X-Pac v.s. Road Dogg
A surprisingly good match from both men to end their ""friendly rivalry"". The aftermath is also very entertaining. ***
Intercontinenatal Title: Eddie Guerrero & Chyna v.s. Val Venis & Trish
This is an Intergender Tag Team Match, which means it can be guy v.s. girl and all that jazz. The way for Eddie or Chyna to win the IC title is to pin either Val Venis or Trish. Now that the rules are out of the way, the match itself isn't too bad...at least when it's Eddie v.s. Val. Still, a good effort by all four. ***
Jerry ""The King"" Lawler"" v.s. Tazz
This is The King's first Pay-Per-View match since he fought Mankind at King Of The Ring 1997. Tazz has been trying to punk out JR so the King sticks up for him in this match. The match wasn't too bad. The interference from JR was great. **1/4
Hardcore Title: Shane McMahon v.s. Steve Blackman
This match was practically a normal Hardcore Title match, that is, until we get to the ending. I won't spoil anything for you if you haven't already seen it but, trust me, Shane's bump here is even better than the one at Backlash 2001. *** for Shane's bump alone.
2 Out Of 3 Falls Match: Chris Jericho v.s. Chris Benoit
This is the 3rd Benoit/Jericho encounter on PPV, and as usual, it's a dang good match. Jericho and Benoit go at it in a normal 2 Out Of 3 Falls match, and of course, the results of it are great except for the bad ending. ****
TLC Match: Edge & Christian v.s. Dudley Boyz v.s. Hardy Boyz
The first and probably the best Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match ever. All three teams give absolutely everything they had in a classic, unbelievable match. Just plain awesome. *****
Thong Stinkface Match: Kat v.s. Terri
Just in case I get criticized, I'm rating this match on ENTERTAINMENT and not for the wrestling skills of both ladies. Now, as for the match, if your a guy who loves beautiful women in thongs, and beautiful women in thongs attempting to rub their pretty little booties in each others faces, this will be a classic for you. ***
Undertaker v.s. Kane
In what could have been a classic encounter from these two, it instead turns into a brawl and ends in a no contest. Although, as far as brawls go, this one was very good and Undertaker even takes off Kanes mask! **1/2
Triple Threat Match/WWF Title: Rock v.s. Triple H v.s. Kurt Angle
This could have been one of the best triple threat matches of all time, but unfortunately, Kurt Angle got injured before the match even started, so throughout more than half the match, it's another Rock v.s. Triple H match. But Kurt eventually makes his way out to do what little part he could do, which was pretty cool considering he suffered a concussion about 20 minutes earlier. ***3/4
Without a doubt, SummerSlam 2000 is about the best SummerSlam the WWF(E) has ever put on. A must have.",1043193600,,3158,4.465397923875432

In this video, you'll see the 1st Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match. Plus, you'll see Shane McMahon taking on Steve Blackman in a hardcore match in which Shane falls from the top of a 40ft. steel structure!

1069427,5,6305710473,"Summerslam 2000 was a memorable event with lots of hot and exciting action. All the matches had been built up well, the storylines were enjoyable and overall it was just an exciting event to watch. The main event sees Triple H and Kurt Angle battling the Rock in a thrilling triple threat match for the WWE title. There is plenty of stuff on the undercard too, such as the incredible TLC match involving the Dudleys, Hardys and Edge and Christian  dueling for tag team gold, and The Undertaker looking for revenge on Kane after his many vicious attacks. There are 10 quality matches, with 4 titles on the line. I will review each match and rate it out of five :
Rikishi and Too Cool vs. The Right to Censor: Uneventful opener with some sloppy sequences and blown spots. Watchable but not the excellent opener this event needed to keep people watching. At least it is somehwhat short.
X-Pac vs. Road Dogg: Good effort by both involved with some compelling technical wrestling. It was backed up by a decent storyline but the crowd were pretty quiet for it. Never mind, at least it was a good match.
Intercontinental Championship Intergender Tag Match - Trish and Val Venis vs. Eddie Guerrero and Chyna: Eh, decent but not mindblowing. Provides some humour and good grappling from Eddie and Val. The ladies, however, are dreadful in the ring in this battle.
I thought this event was in complete trouble at this time, but I would be wrong later...
Jerry Lawler vs. Tazz: Very short but nevertheless entertaining. Lots of moves done in the limited time they were given and it really picks up near the end in terms of excitement. Very good overall.
Hardcore Championship - Steve Blackman vs. Shane McMahon: Excellent hardcore battle considering a non-worker was involved and some nasty shots with trashcans, street signs, belts etc. Shane takes an incredible match end bump which has to be seen to be believed.
2 out of 3 falls Match - Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho: Another fantastic bout with both men pulling out all the stops in a wicked brawl. A mix of old school grappling and submission wrestling made for a great match.
Tables, Ladders and Chairs Tag Team Championship Match - The Hardy Boyz vs. The Dudley Boyz vs. Edge and Christian: Blinding bout with many crazy stunts and  exciting sequences. Breathtaking match overall, as these men all put their bodies on the line in a truly incredible battle.
Thong Stinkface Match - Terri vs. The Kat: I am not complaining about these ladies wrestling in thongs but this match was abysmal. Absolutely terrible and only served as a little light releif after the stonker before it. Still, the fact both looked great moves the grade up a bit.
Undertaker vs. Kane: This was not even a match as the the bell did not ring and the two men just had a flat out, weapon filled brawl. Kane gets a nasty cut and bleeds, while both hammer each other with chairs, steel steps and more. Ok battle, would of liked it better if it was a proper match and had a finish. ...
WWE Championship - The Rock vs. Kurt Angle vs. Triple H: Brilliant way to end the event as the action is hot, the angle is exciting and this match is a thrilling way to end a mindblowing event. Stephanie gets involved at the end, and leads up to a very exciting finish....
Overall this was one of the best wrestling shows I have ever witnessed. It got off to a bad, sloppy start but soon got much better. I would definately recommend buying as it is worth watching more than once. I really enjoyed this event and am pretty sure most people out there will also. Very entertaining 2 1/2 hours overall, so go and buy. Now!!!
Overall Score - Five Stars ....",1030665600,3,3654,4.5685975609756095
1069428,5,6305710473,"I love this ppv just as much as Summerslam 2001 where Rock made his comeback. Talk about a soap opera, this tops what comes on during the day. The love triangle between Triple H, Stephanie, and Kurt Angle was the best so far. Even though The Rock really didn't care about it, he had to defend his title against two love sick men. When it was all said and done, The Rock stood at the top again. The Hardcore match was the best so far as well. The TLC match was the best idea then Commissioner Mick Foley came up.

The crowd laughed and cheered as Bobby was shown little bits of his anatomy one by one. Hilarious.

Also that night, the Headbangers took on the Bushwhackers only to find out that The Bushwackers were their biological parents.

Intercontinental title was up next as One Man Gang defended against Ahmed Johnson in a Suck My Beard match which took place inside a giant inflatable fishtank. In the end Ahmed pulled it off with an eye rake.

The European title match was gold as Max Mini challenged for it against The Big Show. It was over in about three seconds when Big Show kicked Mini out the ring straight away, right into a fire exit a hundred yards from the ring on the balcony. Mini still won, because Show fell in love with him, and forfeited the title. However due to the demise of Max Mini caused by the trauma suffered at the feet of the Big Show, the title went straight over to Uncle Cletus.

The Womens belt was up next as Sunny, Babe Ruth (well it's a girl's name so why not?), Pamela Anderson and Brooke Shields all went at it inside the Hell In A Cell. For forty minutes they put each other through tables, chucked people off cells, ran each other down with tanks, murdered referees...Brooke Shields used her shields to her advantage but in the end Howard Finkle won it with a thunderous wig, Chokeslamming all the women at once through the mat.

The handicap TLC match was up next as Brother Love, The Iron Shiek, Seargent Slaughter, Duke 'The Dumpster' Drozee, Hillbilly Jim, Tugboat, Earthquake, Paul Heyman, Mean Gene Okelund and Kurrgan teamed up against The Gobbledy Gooker. In a strange turn of events which will never be remembered by anyone, a small dog won the match with a rollup on Sammy Davis Jr by using his tights for leverage. However, the dog's fame got to him. In late 2001 he was found dead after taking an overdose of Creswood Mushrooms.

The main event pitted supreme fighting champion of the Earth Goldust against Earl Hebner. After a bit of riff-raff Sable and Marc Mero won with a cracking score of 176.

The opening match with Too Cool vs. RTC was a DUD, but what else can you expect out of the RTC and two once-great athletes who have succumbed to SPORTS ENTERTAINMENT. The I.C. title match also deserves an FF (Fast Forward), as do all Chyna matches. X-Pac vs. Road Dogg squared off in a BONG ON A POLE match...just kidding.

The Right To Censor had been together for a few months and The Godfather had been the latest one to join. He'd turned on his ""Hos"" and put one of them through a table. Being rechristened as The Goodfather, RTC had gained another member and were quickly becoming unstoppable. Too Cool and Rikishi became the latest ones to try and stop RTC as they strolled to the ring with some of Godfather's ex-hos (one of them being former WWE diva, Victoria). We start with a fun and fast opening bout with the match strolling quite nicely. Too Cool have fun with the match, entertaining like only they could. Rikishi tried to set up Steven Richards for the Stinkface but he got caught with a Scissors Kick from Bull Buchanan. Scotty 2 Hotty took out Buchanan with a facecrusher and went for The Worm, but Richards superkicked Scotty and made the pinfall for the win.

2.) Road Dogg vs X-Pac

DX 2000 had kind of quietly gone their separate ways over the Summer of 2000 and when the dust settled, the only remaining members were Road Dogg and X-Pac. They didn't last long though as they began having their differences which eventually led to this grudge match. At this point, the whole DX shtick was an afterthought and after 3 years of seeing DX, fans had seen enough. While Road Dogg still had slight DX characteristics, it was X-Pac who still carried all the DX traits. The similar DX theme song, green DX lights, DX color clothing, crotch chops, and DX pyro. Perhaps one of the reasons X-Pac had X-Pac heat at this point in 2000 was because he was still running with a gimmick that he had since 1998 and had run to the ground at this point. Nonetheless this was an average match. X-Pac gets a low blow in on Dogg without the referee seeing and hits the X-Factor for the win. X-Pac gets a microphone after the match and tells Road Dogg they're still a great time and asks if there's no hard feelings. Road Dogg responds, kicking Pac in the gut and dropping him with a Pumphandle Slam. And just like that, the DX 2000 run was over. They reunited for one night only in November of that year but other than, it was the last time DX would officially be a team until 2006.

3.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Intergender Tag Team Match: Chyna and Eddie Guerrero vs Trish Stratus and Val Venis (c)

It was pretty much straightforward of this match; if Eddie or Chyna pinned either Trish or Val, they would become the new Intercontinental Champion. I do want to state how much I disliked Val Venis' character during this time. While it was somewhat of a positive to see his character evolve from being something than the same porn star we'd seen (take notes X-Pac), he really didn't have a gimmick during this time. Until he joined the RTC, his character was gimmickless and he just walked around in white tights with a nightclub version of his theme and a serious attitude. Yawn. Trish was far from an experience wrestler at the time and was more of eye candy, so she didn't pose much of a threat to Chyna or Eddie. Most of the match consists of Eddie and Chyna working over Val or the other way around. A double clothesline knocks Val and Eddie down. Val tags in Trish who gets in some kicks on Eddie, but he ends up grabbing her foot, tripping her down, and tagging in Chyna who dominates Trish until Val intervenes and takes out Eddie in the process. Eddie manages to get Val on the outside of the ring and throws him into the steps. Meanwhile on the inside, Chyna drops poor Trish with a Military Press Slam and makes the cover for the win and the Intercontinental Championship.

4.) Tazz vs Jerry ""The King"" Lawler

Tazz had fallen way off the ladder at this point and it was disappointing to see where he was. Here's Tazz; a man who incredibly over as one of the top stars in ECW. A man who made his debut in WWF earlier that year at the Royal Rumble in MSG to a big ovation from the crowd and by the Summer he'd been brought down to the mid-card. Basically, Tazz had turned heel and started this Thug Life gimmick when he began bullying Jerry Lawler and J.R. on a weekly basis, leading to this match-up between Lawler and Tazz. Tazz came to the ring, pretending to be blind as he had temporarily blinded J.R with an assault prior to the PPV. Lawler attacks Tazz during his shenanigans and gets the match started. Lawler controls Tazz going in with lots of strikes. Tazz gets in the offense for a bit until Lawler comes back with a piledriver--which Tazz completely no sells. The referee gets bumped into and Tazz slaps on the Tazzmission. With Lawler completely helpless, J.R. gets up from the announce table and breaks a candy jar over Tazz's head. Lawler capitalizes and makes the pin as the referee revives for the win. Basic match, not a whole lot to be impressed with. J.R. got a great pop though when he rose from the chair though

The fight goes back to the ring, where Blackman turns Shane's kneecaps to hamburger with a trash can lid before tearing him apart with a kendo stick and a trash can. Blackman starts to choke Shane out with a leather strap when T&A interfere and put a beatdown on Blackman, saving Shane's skin. They take Blackman over near the equipment area near the entrance and try to push an amplifier on him but Blackman narrowly avoids it. Blackman makes a comeback and beats the tar out of T&A with a kendo stick before going after Shane. Shane climbs the SummerSlam scaffold and Blackman goes after him, stalking him with the kendo stick. Blackman ends up catching up with Shane and whips him over and over with the kendo stick until Shane eventually falls off the scaffold, taking a near 50 foot, stomach dropping fall off the scaffold, crashing at the bottom of a black top. It was the first big fall that had happened in WWF since Foley's dive off the Cell in '98. Blackman does a jaw dropping elbow drop right off the scaffold, onto Shane for the win to win the Hardcore Championship. This was a short but fun hardcore match that saw Shane take his first big drop in WWE. It's a surprise he wasn't seriously injured. Nonetheless, Shane would enjoy the fall and take several more death drops over the years in WWE.

6.) 2 out of 3 Falls Match: Chris Jericho vs Chris Benoit

The Jericho/Benoit feud is one of my favorites from the Attitude Era and this match will prove why. They had already had some classic bouts back at Backlash and Judgment Day that year and now we were getting treated to seeing these go at it twice in one match. They did such an amazing job at building the hatred Jericho and Benoit had for each other, they tear into each other, the moment the match begins with some back and forth action. Benoit ends up targeting Jericho's shoulder and makes him tap to the Crossface to win the first fall. Benoit immediately starts the second fall, trying to put the Crossface back on Jericho, but Y2J escapes it. Jericho gets the second fall with the Walls of Jericho and Benoit wins the final fall, cheating by rolling Jericho up and grabbing the rope for the win. Extravagant match-up from 2 of the best submission technicians of all time! Benoit and Jericho had a chemistry with each other like no one else in that wrestling ring. We'd have to 5 months to see these 2 face each other again, when they fought in their classic Ladder Match at the 2001 Royal Rumble; but it'd be well worth the wait

7.) First Ever WWF Tag Team Championship TLC Match: The Dudley Boyz vs Edge and Christian (c) vs The Hardy Boyz

This was pretty much a rematch (highly anticipated at that) from their outstanding Wrestlemania 2000 encounter as the 3 top tag teams would again have to beat the souls out of each other and climb a ladder to be WWF Tag Team Champions. However rather than just an ordinary Ladder Match; they threw in tables and chairs and this time they had each tag team have their own specialty weapons.

1. JEFF HARDY VS M.V.P.-this was a great opening match with both guys demonstrating their actual wrestling skills. I loved all the reversals here and the back and forth action. I have never really been a fan of Jeff but I will never deny that he is talented. Add in M.V.P. and it makes for one good match. Really liked that M.V.P. got the win here.

2.[WINNER TAKES ALL MATCH]MICKIE JAMES & KOFI KINGSTON VS BETH PHOENIX & SANTINO MARELLA-in this match the winners would win the I-C and Women's belts. I remember when this was happening live I was a little torn since I like all four of them. Any way this is an excellent match for the comedic value. Also the action is actually good as well with Kofi showing off his athleticism. Beth and Santino are great together and Mickie is great as well. Glad that Beth and Santino won the belts, these two were perfect together.

Here we get the retirement announcement from Shawn Michaels and his wife Rebecca that would see Chris Jericho come out and punch her. This of course caused HBK to come back and continue one of the best feuds he had. But before all that HBK gave what seemed like a very real speech that even had me believing it .

3.[ECW TITLE]MARK HENRY VS MATT HARDY-I was looking forward to this match and had high hopes for it going in. how wrong was I as Hardy looks great at the beginning only to have Tony Atlas cost him the match. Hardy wins by DQ.

4.[WORLD TITLE]CM PUNK VS JBL-now I am a fan of both of these guys and this match is a good one, but it is a typical JBL match. What do I mean by that, well it is mostly him then a comeback. Now other reviews have stated this before me so that is all I will say. Other than that this is a good match with JBL showcasing his strength and Punk coming back to keep the title and prove JBL wrong.

5.[WWE TITLE]TRIPLE H VS GREAT KHALI-now we all know what we are getting when Khali is wrestling. We are going to get him looking like a monster for most of the match only to have a comeback beat him. Well that is what you got here. Not an overly great match but better than a lot of other matches that Khali has been in. in the end Triple H hits the pedigree and keeps the belt. Oh and like they say on commentary TV does not do Khali justice, you have to see him in person. He is huge.

6. JOHN CENA VS BATISTA-I liked the build to this match and how they made it play out going into this match. These were the two ""guys"" for WWE at one time so this was a big deal as far as storylines go. Now I really did not expect much from this match going in but I am happy to say that I was wrong. Lots of high spots and back and forth action make this one of the best on the card. The crowd really got into this one as it went on and the counters were excellent. In the end two Batista bombs had Cena on the losing end of things.

7.[HELL IN A CELL]UNDERTAKER VS EDGE-excellent match like these two always put on with tons of high spots. The thing is this match also had great psychology in it which added to the brutal fight. I liked that Edge was unafraid to go in there with Taker and of course Taker just took it to him. Edge came hard in this match but in the end he lost and was sent to hell by way of choke slam.

Special feature match
8.[ECW TITLE]MARK HENRY VS MATT HARDY-this was the match that took place on 8/19/08 and was much better than the PPV match. Henry of course uses his strength to dominate but Hardy came really close to winning this one. Henry still walks away with the title.

Other features include the SummerFest thing and an interview with HBK and his wife.",1357516800,,3606,4.1239316239316235
7894374,4,6305710473,"Summerslam 2000 is undoubtedly one of the best in the events history. However, this is mostly attributed to the TLC and WWF title matches, which are available as part of other WWE compilations. If you already own those compilations (History of the WWE championship and Ladder Match), this is definitely not worth purchasing; but if not, it is a must have.

(1) RTC vs Too Cool. While its always cool to see faction vs faction tag matches, this match barely lasts 5 minutes. While entertaining in that time, it deserved more. (4/10)

(2) X-Pac vs Road Dogg. Another short match with little back story (X-Pac falls through a table because of Road Dogg). Paying money for Raw quality matches (and not even high quality Raw matches) that can't make 5 minutes makes no sense. (3.5/10)

(3) Chyna and Guerrero vs Venis and Stratus. A solid mixed tag match with the exception of an inexperienced Trish. (4/10)

(4)Lawler vs Tazz. While the story going into this match was interesting, the match was not. Highlights include Tazz mocking JR, and JR breaking some glass over Tazz's head. (3/10)

(5) Blackman vs McMahon Hardcore title. Entertaining match with Blackman working over McMahon with his usual arsenal of sticks and strikes while McMahon employs T & A to gain the upperhand. This match is Remembered for Shane McMahon's huge fall from the titantron, which by itself makes this a must see match. (5.5/10)

(6) Benoit vs Jericho 2/3 falls. A good back and forth match which goes into the third fall. Whilst there are no specific highlights, this match features a variety of well executed submissions and grapples (as opposed to the usual attitude era generic brawling). (8/10)

(7) E&C vs Hardys vs Dudleys TLC. The first TLC match and overall best match between these three teams. A classic match which would virtually be repeated 7 months later at Wrestemania X-7. Being the original, it was the first time we saw many of the amazing spots including going off ladders through multiple tables and hanging from the belts above the ring. (9/10)

(8)The Kat vs Terri stinkface match. This match gets a point because the competitors are unbelievably hot. (1/10)

(9) Undertaker vs Kane. Undoubtedly the worst match between Undertaker and Kane. This match has no back story and is nothing but a pointless brawl. Highlights include Kane being unmasked for the first time. (1.5/10)

(10) Kurt Angle VS Triple H VS The Rock WWF title. This is one of the most unique 3 way matches of all time. The Angle/Triple H/Stephanie love triangle is the focus going into this match and accordingly the match begins with Angle and Triple H finally settling the score (that is until the infamous announce table pedigree, with the table giving way under their combined weight concussing Angle). Rock and Triple H put on a show in the meantime until Angle returns late in the match for a nail-biting finish. (9/10)",1332892800,,2891,4.845841784989858

1. Right to Censor vs Rikishi/Too Cool: For starters the RTC music is awful, it makes your ears bleed, anyway now to the match, this was an ok opener, nothing bad, the ending was botched and hurt the match slighly **1/4

2. Road Dogg vs X-Pac: This was terrible, it was like watching a bad match on RAW! It was so boring and the crowd was just not into it, I was very happy to see the end of this one 3/4*

3. Val Venis/Trish Stratus vs Eddie Guerrero/Chyna IC Title: This match was ok, nothing great, chyna did look good in the ring, eddie and venis had some nice chain wrestling, I was very suprised with the outcome of this one **1/2

4. Jerry Lawler vs Tazz: This wasn't very good at all, the whole storyline with JR was stupid, this was a horrible match for tazz, the ending was ok but it didn't help the match, it only went on for like 4 minutes *1/4

5. Shane Mcmahon(c) vs Steve Blackman Hardcore Title: This was the first good match of the night, a lot of brawling and a lot of weapons used, this gets a good amount of time, like 10 minutes, the ending made this match special, you have to see this match just for the amazing ending **3/4

6. Chris Jericho vs Chris Benoit 2 out of 3 falls match: This was a very good match, nice wrestling, which was mostly technical, I would of liked to see this match go on a bit longer but this match was still very good, this was a great fued alltogether ***3/4

7. Edge/Christian(c) vs Dudley Boyz vs Hardy Boyz WWF Tag Team Titles TLC Match: This was bloody unbeleivable, so many great spots including, bubba going through two tables, jeff crashing through two tables, devon and jeff dangling from the belts and a visious spear on lita, I cant give this match 5 stars because of the match length but it was still absolutley amazing! ****3/4

8. Undertaker vs Kane: This was horrible, for some reason the ref was not disqualifying either man when they were hitting each other with steel steps and were brawling outside the ring for ages! The ending to the match was crap, just avoid this match 1/2*

9. The Rock(c) vs Triple H vs Kurt Angle WWF Title: There was a nice spot at the start of the match where triple h pedigreed angle through the announcers table, after that angle has to leave on a stretcher and it turns into a singles match, this was a very good match, my 2nd favourite of the night, the ending was well done with angle limping back to the ring and attacking triple h ****
