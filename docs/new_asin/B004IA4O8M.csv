4385577,4,B004IA4O8M,"This is a wonderfully offbeat science fiction film from Australia. It's unique, creepy and worth a view.",1483315200,,104,5.176470588235294
4385578,3,B004IA4O8M,"It has its moments, especially towards the second half. Would I pay to watch it in a theater, no, but I would pay to rent it. Just by the illustration you can guess what it's about but it's not your usual, fall asleep encounter of the second kind (aside from the first half). You have to give it some credit taking into account it's almost three decades old.",1483315200,,358,4.279411764705882

4385580,2,B004IA4O8M,"Goes absolutely nowhere for 36 minutes at least, which was where I stopped watching. i don't really care much for the characters, a rural cop with some obvious mental problems, a probably misunderstood ex-con, etc. They aren't truly likeable. the first few minutes gets your hopes up mentioning a UFO and some water disappears suddenly, and there's a crash that's not really shown, but then nothing happens again for awhile.
To add insult to injury, this dark, grainy and scratched transfer is hard to watch and has poor sound.",1482192000,5,527,4.932584269662922
4385581,1,B004IA4O8M,"Believe it or not the first 8 minutes of this movie was actually okay, but it immediately spiraled into an indecisive B movie which seemed to be working on three poorly constructed plotlines that failed to connect.  Also the ending (which couldn't come soon enough) was equally as bad as the movie.  I had high hopes for this movie partly because of the good reviews given by the 4 amazon reviewers and the cover art, but like with most free amazon prime B movies, my hopes were crushed.  Those 4 good reviews were probably from the actors.

  I recommend staying away from this Australian made B movie.",1482105600,2,603,4.588785046728972

4385583,5,B004IA4O8M,This is the second time I've seen this movie. I saw it once years ago and liked it.  I still do. It's a really good Science Fiction movie!,1481760000,,138,3.9285714285714284
4385584,4,B004IA4O8M,"This movie is almost impossible to find, much less in its original format. This DVD is not a good transfer, but it is definitely watchable and a great find (considering the alternatives). One would think this good a film would get a better release, but we'll take what we can get.",1364428800,5,280,4.509803921568627
4385585,2,B004IA4O8M,"Low budget, slow moving and lots and lots of talking. Character driven is what they call it. The movie was kind of blurry and I didn't like any of the characters. It was interesting at times but worth seeing once.",1485820800,,213,4.35
4385586,3,B004IA4O8M,"It was a good late night watch, thought it'd be a tad better fun overall",1485734400,,72,3.8666666666666667

4385588,3,B004IA4O8M,"It was worth watching a second time to understand the whole movie, would watch it again if I felt like that kind of movie.",1485648000,,122,4.125
4385589,3,B004IA4O8M,This wasn't very good but for some reason I watched the entire thing. Guess that says something for it.,1485648000,,103,4.473684210526316

4385591,1,B004IA4O8M,"It's almost as if 2 guys were sitting in the outback on their ranch with a fog machine and a couple bright lights when suddenly one of them says, ""Oy mate! I've got an extra couple thousand dollars in me account, let's make a film! We don't have to hire real actors, we can use my cousin Tessie as a lead, she's not bad lookin'! And off they went to produce this 1 and a half piece of disjointed, no alien shown, innuendo of a crap film.",1484870400,,437,4.0344827586206895

4385601,1,B004IA4O8M,"This movie looks promising all the way to the inconclusive, unexplained ending.
In fact, nothing is ever explained. That is why I'm sorry I gave it a chance.

  Things happen, but I guarantee you won't get any answers. Pass on this.",1483660800,3,232,4.609756097560975
4385602,3,B004IA4O8M,"I've been wanting to watch this for a while, but have never gotten the opportunity. Now I have and I am not sure what to say about it.

It was weird, but most sci-fi is in some way, shape, or form. But, this was weirder than most. I wasn't quite sure what was going on most of the time, but that might have been because I was doing 12 other things at the same time.

I have to also admit that Australians seem to have an interesting take on just about everything.

I was entertained. I was scratching my head. I would recommend it, if you have a tolerance for ""B"".",1483660800,3,564,4.063063063063063

8430489,4,B004IA4O8M,"It's not the best movie I've ever seen, but it was actually pretty enjoyable.  It was weird and a little underdeveloped, so be aware that you may not get all the answers you want.  That being said, the art house style cinematography was pretty consistent, they did a good job of building atmosphere and creepiness, and the characters, while a little bland, are plausible and decently acted.  It definitely may not appeal to everyone, but if you're okay with your movies being less filled out, but higher on style, with a weird aussie ufo story kicking about, give it a shot.",1499040000,,574,4.663366336633663
8430490,3,B004IA4O8M,"It is right there on the cusp of being really good, but just doesn't have the story push to get there. Its not horrible, just wish the explanation of the event was more a part of the story. The acting is great. The movie takes itself seriously. There is entertainment value. It just could have used a little more of a re-write. I do recommend it with the previous caveats.",1497571200,,372,4.328571428571428
8430491,1,B004IA4O8M,"Complete rubbish.  Horrible acting with no plot and no point.  Don't waste your time, because if horror is what you're looking for, then you will not find it here unless you like to be horrified by how horrible a movie can actually be.",1492041600,,235,4.441860465116279
8430492,2,B004IA4O8M,Too hard to see  anything. Never develops any kind of story. Hard to watch. Very close to 1 star.,1490918400,,97,4.105263157894737
8430493,5,B004IA4O8M,"Love 80's sci-fi, especially from Australia.  I love the comedy that was added, not over the top but just right.  Great acting, story and music.  Movie starts off with the classic horror music.",1489708800,,193,4.787878787878788
8430494,3,B004IA4O8M,"This is a great 80's Austrailian horror film. I'm predisposed toward this genre because I like the interesting flavor their culture places on traditional American horror themes. The result is usually something over the top,eg.""Dead Undead."" This is no exception. The film has zombies, aliens, sex, gratuitous violence, a psycho cop, and a punk rock soundtrack. The video quality was reminiscent of a midnight movie; complete with the grainy, scratched film look. Check it out.",1489449600,,476,5.36
