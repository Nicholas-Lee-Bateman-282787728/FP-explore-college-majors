8569789,5,B00BJUAR12,This documentary provided historical depth and perspective to the famed Deutsche Oper -- much needed for a tourist like myself who visited Berlin and had the opportunity to attend an opera in a performance venue that truly has no bad seat in the house!,1483747200,,252,4.75
8569790,5,B00BJUAR12,"I was struck by the friendly atmosphere - the joyful association, Gesellschaft - of the place and fellow members of the audience, when I attended the season's final performance of Les Troyens in April this year. I had paid little more for two prime seats at the front of one of the cute boxes that are plentiful on both sides of the house, than I had at a Philharmonie concert, a few days earlier, where I seemed to be at the back of Scharoun's crazy auditorium and sitting at an awkward angle to the stage. But that's what you get with 360 theatre in the round I suppose, unless you have a premium priced ringside seat. Pass the tux, ball gown and diamond tiara!

The Deutsche Oper solves that problem by giving EVERYBODY A GREAT SEAT WITH A GREAT VIEW OF THE STAGE - the democratic layout of the house is astounding. Surely it could only have been implemented in the context of western political showcasing in the midst of the Cold War sixties and, of course, mega cultural funding the likes of which London, where I reside, has never known and will probably never ever experience due to the mean and pinched attitude towards public funding for the arts in the UK where the mantra of privatisation governs every policy! Thus the ghost of Thatcher and, soon, the arch privatiser, John Major, their legacy, poisons arts provision in (the UK!) this country.

I prefer Berlin's legacy any time. But the love affair of Berlin with opera does not stop here on Bismarckstrasse, with the Berlin Stadtoper and Komische Oper in Unter den Linden just a mile across the city. These have or are currently receiving full refurbishment and restoration and extension within the transformation plan being implemented in this key city.

Being interested in such things, I studied the internal finish of the wood panelling which virtually surrounds one at the Deutsche opera and contributes to the superb clear sound (the orchestra pit is nice and open so it sounds as clear as a bell too!) and the matching grains of the veneers which run uninterrupted from floor to ceiling. This is superb finishing of the internal build which one does not find for example in the Festival Hall, where the veneers do not match. These details are important. The build quality contributes to the overall quality of the artistic effort that will be made for generations following.

I was most impressed with the auditorium for those democratic values, but just as lovely is the external architecture in Bauhaus style and foyer and entrance where strict 1960s economy of the finish, understated elegance, is the white rice to the meat of the performances!

And what performances there must have been! I visited this place too late in my life...in my seat I envisioned past productions and celebrated singers on the stage, household names by virtue of their distinguished recordings.

On this DVD overview, there is a good helping of excerpts from these productions from archive films together with thoughtful contributions by the likes of Christa Ludwig and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau - happily still in fine philosophical form here, but alas to be his last recorded interview - give a sample of what I take to be the defining characteristics of this institution. Memoirs of such greats as Martha Modl and Josef Greindl are there. A commitment to modernity, high artistic values and incredible hard work within the embrace of comradeship and the democratic aim to bring opera within the reach of all living in the city - or beyond.  -An elderly fellow member of the audience I chatted with,  had undertaken a five hour round trip by car to catch this last performance of the season.

When I spotted this DVD I just had to get it. It added considerably to the real experience. It encouraged me to invest in the 5 disc box set of Otello, Don Giovanni, Don Carlos, Fidelio and Die Heimliche Ehe. Altogether I am pledged to return, if possible, to humbly enjoy again this first class musical experience, visually and in sound, and the warmth and openness of the Deutsche Oper Berlin.

I believe Berliners are currently busy constructing a lavish and huge ""grand"" opera house they may feel more appropriate to the renewed status of the city as once more the national capital - that would dwarf the present intimate human scale of the present building. God forbid they will abandon it completely!

If you love opera - get this DVD!",1398643200,,4388,4.78335535006605
