In a world of played out, ""softened"" for an R rating, and just plain s****y films its AMAZING to have such a raw, relentless, viewing experience that's going to tear your emotions to shreds yet keep you unable to look away. A masterpiece.",1377734400,3,291,4.7254901960784315
5838767,5,B00DOQK5NO,"I watched this film on Halloween last year, it was on an online festival and I wasn't quite sure what to expect...and I sure didn't expect this! The first few moments of the film are calm, quiet and represent happiness and positivity, the rest of the film is a journey into absolute hell driven by the 3 crystal meth addicted Neo Nazis, 1, 2, and 3. Hate Crime is obviously intended to shock but also at the same time represents the darkest most brutal reality. I found the script particularly brilliant, some of the one liners had me laughing despite the horror that was unfolding on screen. Within the first 5 minutes you're suddenly dropped into hell and you don't leave until the end of the film.

It's a found footage, home invasion film not for the faint of heart, if you're a fan of extreme films that push boundaries then this is one that you MUST see! I personally think it's an indie masterpiece and James Cullen Bressack is the horror guy to watch over the next few years.",1377734400,2,983,4.461111111111111
5838768,5,B00DOQK5NO,"Just finished re~watching this and have to say I liked it even more this time around. This was a real winner for me!

What do we have here anyway?

Night time, we have a Jewish family of Mom, Dad, two brothers and their older sister celebrating the youngest boys birthday. DSLR at the ready the father is filming the preceedings. Hearing a strange sound he goes to investigate. Three speed fuelled Neo Nazi gimps invade the birthday party. Taking the kids and their father upstairs they wind up shooting the birthday boy. Everything goes to s*** for the family from here on in!

We have 1, 2 and 3, Neo Nazi tugs who originally go in to scare a Jewish family away from their town. But due to the excitement and being drug fuelled they escalate the situation into something truly terrifying for the family that ends in tragedy. 1 and 3 are especially crazy with how they move and their expressions and what have you! Also the whole family truly seem terrified! Film maker James Cullen Bressack certainly knows how to get something special out of his actors that is for certain. with the Neo Nazi's i can only guess he got his actors to get a bit drunk just with how they move, or they are dancers or something it truly is that great.

Yes this is a SOV film and done very very well. No pointless shaking you believe what you see, that it is a home invasion and the perpetrators decide to film it.

Naturally with the violence there is practical effects for the injuries involved. These looked great, nice gore along with other things I prefer not to give away. Also, for me it is important anyway, the blood looks good!

All up for me this is a great film from an up and coming talent who is with keeping an eye on. James Cullen Bressack has big things ahead of him if he keeps it up! Anyway this is getting it's much deserved release and if you like a well made and graphic depiction of the reality of violence this is worth a look at!",1374883200,3,1935,4.346260387811634
5838769,4,B00DOQK5NO,"It's evident early on that Hate Crime isn't playing around when it comes to the violence. It's raw, sadistic, and just as the name implies, hateful. That's not to say it's full of gratuitous gore, or blood splatter, there's hardly a drop of the red stuff, save for a couple of scenes. The violence in this movie is actually realistic, and that's what makes it so disturbing. At times it was difficult to watch because the entire time I was thinking to myself ""this could easily be actually happening right now"". Take heed to all the warnings from reviews folks, I don't know if I've ever seen a meaner flick.

This is a found footage movie, and I know that's going to get groans and eye rolls from a lot of people, but it doesn't really feel like a found footage movie. It's incredibly realistic, it basically happens in real- time, and is beautifully edited. It feels more like you're there, enduring the hell with this family instead of simply watching. Of course all the editing in the world wouldn't help if the cast weren't believable, and thankfully, Bressack managed to find some incredibly talented actors and actresses to bring his story to life. I can't imagine it was an easy feat to get into the right mindset to act out some of the things in this movie, but almost everyone involved turns in a totally believable, flawless performance. Again, it's terrifying because this is exactly what a home invasion of this nature would look/sound like.

Hate Crime isn't a movie to be enjoyed with others, I feel like it would lose it's effectiveness in larger groups. It certainly isn't a ""get drunk with all your buds, and watch a movie"" kind of film. To truly experience this movie, and get the most out of it, I feel like solo is the best way to watch.

From the very beginning, Hate Crime grabbed me by the neck and repeatedly punched me in the gut, and then kicked me while I was down. I lost count at the amount of times all I could do was sit there and stare blankly at the screen. James Cullen Bressack and company deliver a movie experience that actually gets to you, elicits an emotional response, and that's incredibly rare for me. This is guerrilla film-making at it's finest.

This movie will absolutely not be for everyone. In fact I only personally know a handful of people who I think would be able to watch it through to the end. Only those with strong stomachs, and strongly desensitized to violence need apply. Hate Crime is a rare treat for those of us who seek out this type of experience with a film.",1374364800,3,2525,4.518599562363239

Me either...but I imagine what it must feel like after viewing Hate Crime!
This is a relentless ride through ultra violence where nothing is taboo. A Jewish suburban family is celebrating the birthday of their youngest child when an unforeseen home invasion takes over in the form of found footage. Three steroid pumped neo-nazi thugs decide to have some fun by displaying their hatred of Jews in a series of torture, rape and brutality.
Highly disturbing,  sadly real. This will stay with you for a long time afterwards. James Cullen Bressack's brilliance is simplistic in form, driving home a lesson in racial/anti-semitic tension.

I am not a fan of ""Funny Games"" because I feel that it is slow and unconvincing. Compared to this, it is Citizen Kane.

That said, I give credit to anyone (including the creator/cast of this movie) that has the gumption to make a indie film- living the dream, so to speak. That said, if you don't have the artistic talent or cinematic wherewithal to create a grindhouse action-thriller, do a character driven story with less action and more compelling narrative.

Director : James Cullen Bressack
Stars:  Jody Barton, Nicholas Adam Clark, Greg Depetro

Before I get into this one, I must admit, without any intention of comparing a film to another one that if there is something that gets me interested every damn time about film, are subjects such as the one in HATE CRIME. Racism, discrimination, human rights are all things exploited in movies such as SHINDLER'S LIST, A TIME TO KILL, and the extraordinary AMERICAN HISTORY X. These films, for a reason or another all got me to my stomach and I haven't forgotten any of them since. And James Cullen Bressack's HATE CRIME qualifies as one of them. But, nope, scratch that part. Should it be different, HATE CRIME's far closer to a pure horror film than a Drama. Call me a pussy, call me too sensitive, at first I wasn't too sure if I should test myself with this film, but something inside me felt like I had to. So I took the red pill and watched it.

HATE CRIME is the story of a Jewish family. New to their neighborhood, they're about to celebrate their son's birthday. They want to immortalize the event on tape but soon after the party begins, a bunch of crazy, stoned neo Nazi lunatics storm in the house.

This is all I need to give away if you haven't seen the film yet and maybe intend to test yourself. The nightmare that follows starts within about the first 5 minutes of the film and it doesn't let go until the very end. Turning that film into a survival experience, in which a desperate family becomes hostage of a group of people that obviously hate them.

Most of the time, the visual style of HATE CRIME, which involves letting an actor run with the camera surprisingly serves the overall film pretty well with allowing the film maker to get as close as the action as he wants you to be and instead of making you feel for the sympathetic characters, just simply making you resent the fear, the anger, the cries and all the emotions storming inside the protagonists. HATE CRIME manages at times to challenge the viewer. I must admit that I've been tested on more than one occasion as this night which started as a quiet, birthday evening became such a fierce and crazy night of crimes beyond what I could have imagined. And that is why I won't spoil you in this review with much about the disaster that occurs but rest assure that pushing beyond the limits isn't something that this film shies away from, as I thought that only animal cruelty and violence and abuse on child and women could happen to make me uncomfortable in horror films anymore.

There are very few weaknesses for this one that doesn't really bother the entire work. For instance, one of the masked assailants, the biggest one's voice will appear incredibly hard to hear clearly through his mask, making his dialogues hard to understand for the first minutes of the ordeal. But one can thank the need to take himself into such a horrific ride, or the will to see the protagonists' triumph, the film builds a strength for itself that far exceeds the little flaws. I felt like I must see this film and I did. This one is a rewarding piece of indie film overall. And I'm really looking forward into James Cullen Bressack's future in film as I'm looking to have the chance to see more of his past work. Including the intriguing: TO JENNIFER.

You may want to experience this one alone, as it is a certain party crasher. Some people may hate you for starting this flick in the middle of a warm, friendly beer discussion among friends!",1404000000,2,3520,4.507836990595611
5838786,1,B00DOQK5NO,"I have to admit, I think my viewing hopes were set way too high for this film.  I was hoping for something gritty and where I really cared about the characters and the horrors they were going through, but it just never worked for me.  The three men who broke into the home to terrorize the family were all over the place....the slapping and punching didn't even look real.  The family being terrorized never acted the way I felt they should, if I put myself in their shoes, I'd hope I had a bit more fight in me.

In films like this, if I can't feel something for the characters, then I tend to lose interest, far too fast.  I purchased this DVD with a gift card I received, so I'm happy I never spent my own money on it and I truly don't see myself re-watching this film, ever.",1395792000,11,778,4.16

5838793,1,B00DOQK5NO,"Hate Crime (2013)

Rated on a 10 point scale.

WARNING: This review contains spoilers.

Right from the opening scene we are subjected to yet another hand-held, home video style approach to the story, and not only is this completely uninspiring, but downright irritating, considering the plot and events of the movie. (-3 points)

The next sign of an uncreative and mediocre director comes when the home invaders, who happen to be neo-Nazis, immediately kill the little boy, without even a small amount of abuse or torture. It becomes clear this was done, because the director lacked the backbone to portray what would have really happened to the youngest family member in a real hate crime. Giving a clean kill to the youngest child simply because of his age was utterly unrealistic and sets the stage for how often  this film, which is supposedly shocking, pulls its punches and falls short of its goal. (-2 points)

Way too much screaming! Apparently, the director only knows how to portray emotion in one-dimensional ways: hate = you scream, fear = you scream, anger = you scream. Coupled with the unoriginal and jerky camera work, this makes for a horrible watching experience, not because the film is disturbing, but because it is annoying. (-2 points)

Poor production value is also very apparent throughout the movie. This has nothing to do with budget, but more with bad direction and cinematography. Punches that so very obviously never make contact with the target are abundant. Small details, like the ridiculous ropes around the lounge chairs, from which any human could simply slide out, also turn this into more of a comedy of errors than a serious film. (-2 point)s

Final score: 1/10

Hate crime in real life is a horrible, powerful, and prevalent problem everywhere in the world. Hate Crime, the film, fails to understand that some things are best presented in a simple but unflinching fashion, without the use of tired gimmicks and overacting. There is nothing shocking or disturbing in this movie; more importantly, there is nothing worth watching - this movie screams film-school is every possible, horrible way.",1383004800,8,2132,5.0
5838794,5,B00DOQK5NO,"In my line of work... I've seen a lot of films. They are normally repetitive, same scripts with different casts and takes forever for the action to pick up. Not this James Cullen Bressack film! Hate Crime could be the most significant film and socially relevant film that Bressack has made to date. It displays and tackles racism in a way I've never seen before on film. The interesting thing about the film is that the gore doesn't solely drive it... it's the story. The characters ill fated family trip gone ballistic is truly frightening frankly because it COULD happen. Bressack's great pacing thankfully keeps the film moving quickly even though at times you want a moment to process the heinous acts you've seen. But that's apart of the grandiose direction of the young director... dive in the water head first and check for the sharks along with its temperature later! Clearly it's a winning formula because Hate Crime along with ALL its actors' believable (and at times disturbingly gross) performances is definitely a keeper.

5838795,5,B00DOQK5NO,Hate Crime is a dark and disturbing film filled with intensity. James Bressack is one of the top up and coming indie filmmakers of 2013. Look forward to more of his stuff!,1377820800,3,171,4.375
5838796,5,B00DOQK5NO,"I was able to watch a screener copy of Hate Crime, directed by young up and comer James Cullen Bressack, and I was excited to get the chance to watch it early.  I did not know anything about the film upon my first viewing of it other than it was shot in the found footage style.  Going in fresh is key to this film so this review will be completely spoiler free.

Like I said this is a found footage style film, but unlike most films in this genre 'Hate Crime' is not the typical slow burn.  This film comes out swinging within minutes of it starting and does not let up until the final credits role.  While I was watching this film I felt uncomfortable in many scenes, and even had to remind myself that it wasn't a legitimate snuff film.  Is this a bad thing?  Not at all.  This film is not your standard horror film with slashers or a monster, this is a horror film because it is horrific and the acts that happen could have been pulled from newspaper headlines.  Bressack proved that he is able to get his actors to go to very dark places and the performances (sometimes over the top I admit) are on point and you feel the fear, the pain and the anger all at once.  I assume that a lot of reviews will come out and because it is shot in the POV/Found Footage style the reviews will be negative but don't let that deter you from watching it because it is not at all like any found footage film you have seen.  One other note to make is that when the film ends Bressack puts some facts about crimes of like nature in this country which just adds an additional punch to the face because you then realize that yes what you have just watched probably has happened somewhere in this country.  I highly recommend this film to anyone, and those who do not like found footage I say to you give Hate Crime a shot.",1377820800,2,1807,4.175792507204611

Hate Crimes (2012): Directed by James Cullen Bressack

From director James Cullen Bressack comes a film that is brutal, real, unsettling and captivating. Bressack who is considered one of horror's rising film directors on the independent circuit and the director of the psychological debut film My Pure Joy (2011) creates a nightmare of a masterpiece. Hate Crime takes you moments before a gang of three thugs break into a families' home, doing unspeakable things that torture, harm and violate this all-American family during a birthday party.

Known for honest and real films that contain subject matter that pushes the boundaries even in the horror genre, Bressack hits the mark here with the controversial Hate Crime. While the subject matter is taboo breaking and harsh from just about the entire reel, Bressack finds away to hide the truth from us and lets our minds fill the blanks with brutal assaults that smacks the senses and doesn't allow the eyes to stop watching Overall the acting is believable with frightening and great performances by all those involved especially Jody Barton (Number 1), Tim Moran (Number 2) and Number 3 portrayed by the menacing Ian Roberts.

It is understandable why film fests have issues and refuse to show the film, it would cause discomfort to the most harden horror fan. Hate Crime is honest, psychological and real with a brilliant job done by Bressack and cast overall. Powerful and unapologetic only scratch the surface of this independent horror nightmare that makes you feel that you are there with psychological torment, violence and hell that actually is worth watching as a fan real horror filming.",1377820800,2,1748,5.059027777777778

Got a cup of coffee in the morning and started up HATE CRIME.  I watched it and didn't take one sip of my coffee. It grabs your sick interest from start to finish.""

James did a great job with all the action and thrilling moments in one location, which is very challenging.  The attackers will anger you, but sadly some of the smart ass comments that come out of their mouths are a little comical.  Unfortunately, after I giggled I felt guilty.  Especially since this film is highly possible as there's many incidents of this ruthless Neo Nazi group committing heinous crimes.  In the film, right off the bat they commit some shocking acts.

Their actions indicate they must be on something and later it's exposed what's adding to their psychoses.  The family truly act scared and I'm sure feeding off One, Two, and Three made it easier for them.

Bathroom scene being a father made me upset....okay a lot was upsetting but that was a moment of less anger and true psychotic moment. Fortunately the daughter could...well you need to watch it.

In addition to the horror, the film shows how psychopaths are emotionally unstable and when something doesn't go their way, they struggle to handle it.

To summarize, there's a long list of upsetting moments in this film and the reality aspect of it makes it worse.  In terms of shocking the audience, HATE CRIME accomplishes that.",1377820800,2,1590,4.822878228782288

The AP decided this case wasn't national news and after it came out thanks to fox cable news it was originally classified a hate crime as it should have been but then reclassified by the attorneys generals office as not a hate crime, why the victims were white the rabid dogs were black.",1432252800,,1025,4.7

The concept of becoming victims in the sanctity of our own home out of ignorance and hatred. Violated and tormented at the hands of psychotics is a story all to real and James Cullen Bressack puts you at the scene of the crime with pure  cruel intent that is viciously to the point, a point made perfect. This film makes a statement and opens our eyes to how blatant and evil hatred truly is.

Hate Crime is just as the title suggests. One hour and twelve minutes of a continuous hate crime that holds on to you until the bloody and gruesome end. (On a personal note I now am fully assured to check my locks at night, just in case I wasn't before). The story that transpires on screen feels almost unscripted. As if Bressack simply told the actors who their characters where and allowed them to run with it bringing the dialogue to a disturbing realism that is disturbingly hypnotic. Even though the acting and the action seem wild and out of control, the sheer power of the scenes unfolding make you feel every second of this film. That was as I assume the intend of the directing. Because no crime nor violent scenario is ever going to feel controlled or be inherently controllable. That is a good thing. Wild and out of control is the only way you could write or direct such a strong subject material and not come off cheesy. Hate Crime is a truly terrifying tale that lies in the back of all our minds when we shut our doors as the sun goes down.",1431216000,,1647,4.432343234323432
