2567984,5,B000FILVO6,"Finally, versions of Shakespeare that are understandable, thanks to the superb artistry of Olivier. He was the epitome of an actor for this genre. These are the versions to watch for enjoyment of the master playwright.",1232668800,4,218,5.083333333333333
2567985,5,B000FILVO6,Anyone loving or teaching Shakespeare and wishing to see a magnificent actor at the height of his powers (who can speak the verse) should buy this collection. The bonus of the interview with Olivier and the excellent commentaries by Bruce Eder only adds to its value.,1230163200,2,267,4.826086956521739
2567986,5,B000FILVO6,"This wonderful set has Laurence Olivier's best Shakespeare movies-- Henry V, Hamlet, and Richard III.  I enjoyed all three of them, although Richard III  was perhaps the best with a gentle man like Olivier playing a villain!  Such a great actor in versatile roles.  Henry V was fine interpretation of an historical play with Olivier as both actor and director.  I thought he was also very good as Hamlet in creating the melancholic personality of the character.  By all means get this set if you love Shakespeare and Olivier's acting. It is much less expensive than the BBC sets of Shakespeare, and the acting is just as good if not better. Olivier's King Lear and Othello are available on separate DVD's if you wish to watch more great acting.",1190937600,4,744,4.728682170542636
2567987,5,B000FILVO6,"1. Criterion; enough said.

2. Five stars for shelling these three classics together.

3. Laurence Olivier is one of the most captivating and most talented actors to ever grace the craft. His honing and mastering of timing, process and realism is bar none compared to the actors of this day and age as a whole. He was masterfully involved in every facet of a production.

4. Clearly 'Henry V' is his shining tour de force, although the majority will say it was 'Hamlet'. A Classics teacher I had once freshman year, a true inspiration of a hero, said ""Olivier is the crowning jewel of a lost empty space."" Olivier's Henry V unchains Shakespeare from most Elizabethan limits. He commands the performance with mobility and tenderness, yet brings Shakespeares poetry into a new light. He masterfully illuminates the complete package.

I remember seeing Olivier play Master Nikodemus in Zeff's potrayal of the life of Christ in 'Jesus of Nazereth', (I am forever the agnostic, but Zeff's film was mesmorizing) and even there, even there in that simple tiny, forgotten role, we see that illumination at first hand. A gentle hovering spirit that soared to the very upper echelon of his profession.

Thank you Criterion for understanding majestic raw talent, pinnacle acting and directing from a superstar, in which the likes of will surely not be matched for some time, if ever.

Thanks

Ken",1187136000,16,1385,4.943965517241379
2567988,2,B000FILVO6,"While the acting is excellent, the interpretation Olivier gives Hamlet is nauseating. As a lifelong student of Shakespeare, I have always cringed when I hear students of the bard describe Hamlet as a ""man who could not make up his mind."" Oliver tells us at the beginning of this film the very essence he sees in Hamlet. I have *no* problem with him interpreting in a way I do not agree with, but to say this is the ""definitive work, period"" is unfair to some other wonderful adaptations. For my money, Branagh's Hamlet is a more honest portrayal and the excellent dress rehearsal Dvd with Richard Burton is mind-blowing.
I do not dislike Olivier, but Hamlet is hardly his best Shakespearean work. Richard III is much better and Henry V is perhaps better than Branagh's version.

I edited this post on 12-06-2013 because so many people were upset at my use of the term ""scholar."" So now, get over it.",1183507200,15,899,4.61875
2567989,5,B000FILVO6,"It is because of ""Larry"", I came to love and understand the great Bard, all through high school and college, I never could grasp and appreciate Shakespeare, until I came upon the master actor of possibly all time, I would say without fear of contradiction, his work will out live all others, as far as this set of disc's from Criterion, I am sure they just as good as the single one's I have in my collection, the price is a great savings from single purchase, I might add the having seen the great films, opening a book of Shakespeare was a wonderful ""new' experience.",1178064000,2,569,4.428571428571429
2567990,5,B000FILVO6,"Basically, these are three great Criterion Editions boxed together - which gives it a nice sense of continuity between these films.

HAMLET is, perhaps, Shakespeare most widely known and popular work. And Olivier gives it the film performance to which all others are compared. Period. And it is a great film with a striking cinematography and (naturaly) a great cast. A classic. Criterion, as always, does a fine job in terms of image and sound... although this disc has no extras.

RICHARD III tells the story of the evil duke of gloucester and his murderous machinations to get the throne of England. Another great performance. Great Technicolor cinematography. Here, Criterion gives us a two-disc edition full of nice extras: an Olivier interview, a featurette, etc.

HENRY V is another tour de force as the king who must battle all odds in order to achieve the greatest victory. The Agincourt battle scenes are a wow!!! Another Tecnicolor triumph.

So, here you have three great Shakespeare adaptation at a better price (you can buy the separately) by Criterion.

I say look no further.",1156291200,42,1090,5.0
8123181,5,B000FILVO6,"The best all-time Shakespeare actor, ever. He brings three separate plays to life. I loved it all.",1501027200,,98,4.823529411764706
8123182,5,B000FILVO6,All of these films stand as master adaptations of Shakespeare to the Screen. Olivier's Hamlet is the standard for any screen version. Staged traditionally and filmed in black and white it is the Hamlet performance that can be viewed again and again. Olivier's direction and acting are superb as are the rest of the cast and the lines of the most famous scenes are so beautifully delivered as to make them seem fresh again with every viewing. Much the same can be said of the other two plays that are in this collection. Henry V uses the device of showing the play being staged but then the viewer is drawn into the action in a way to make the experience as immediate as if in the theater. For Shakespeare lovers this is a must own collection as Sir Olivier does the bard justice as no other film maker can.,1409875200,2,806,4.416107382550336
8123183,5,B000FILVO6,"Olivier's Henry V is my favorite movie.  I am glad to have a copy of my own, plus it came with Hamlet and Richard III, which is a bonus for this Shakespeare lover!",1406851200,,163,3.9393939393939394
8123184,5,B000FILVO6,Got this as a gift for a friend of mine !  He was delighted . Good move for all to see !,1379116800,,88,3.0
8123185,5,B000FILVO6,Criterion does a good job of issuing good copies of great movies.  All three of these movies are nice copies with good sound and enable you to enjoy Olivier's treatments of these Shakespeare plays.  The Criterion Blu-ray of Richard III is out and is even better than  the DVD copy here.  If you think you want Blu-ray rather then DVD check with Criterion to see  if they plan to reissue the other two in Blu-ray before buying this.  If you are not fussy but just want Olivier in a good clean copy of these movies you cannot go wrong with this.,1370563200,,543,4.326732673267327
8123186,5,B000FILVO6,"No one is better than Olivier...here, he adapts three great Shakespearean plays for the screen - conceiving the style in which the stories should be told, directing them, and starring in them.

He was a master and his work is timeless and inspirational. No one will ever take his place.",1362355200,,286,4.72
8123187,5,B000FILVO6,"For all that more contemporary actors have done to make Shakespeare movies contemporary public can relate to these 3 Olivier produced Shakespeare movies still knock my socks off. I originally saw these as a teen ager and was blown away by them at that time!! Seeing them again all these years later... wow! I still believe Richard III can hold the interest of a Die Hard fan. (Well, maybe they should not it watch after dinner when they would normally take a nap. They do need to pay attention to the storyline.)",1313971200,3,512,4.576086956521739
8123188,5,B000FILVO6,"The three films of Shakespeare plays that are included in this package hold up remarkable well to the modern eye and year. The latest of the fiims, Richard III, was released more than 50 years ago. Henry V was released during the Second World War and the Hamlet is pre-war. None the less, each is engaging as Shakespeare and as cinema and provides insights into these great plays. Olivier directed and stared in each provided us with a record of a remarkable actor's interpretation of these roles.",1287964800,,497,4.724137931034483
8123189,5,B000FILVO6,"Who can deny that for his time, Laurence Olivier was the absolute pioneer in Shakespeare adaptations for the screen.

This masterfully crafted boxed-set by Criterion contains three of his best versions of the Bard.

The first is ""Henry V"", filmed during WWII, and as such it reflects a bit of the mood and the propaganda needs,
that were prevailing in England during those days.
Despite of this, Olivier shows us filming techniques, which for those days, were considered revolutionary.
Of course the speeches are held for an audience in need for motivation and are far less naturalistic than, say,
in Kenneth Branagh's own version.
Yet, the entire production, which actually starts on a stage at the ""Globe"" Theater in Shakespeare's times, just
to slowly switch to actual exterior shots (especially in the final Agincourt Battle), runs smoothly and very
entertaining.
Names such as Robert Newton, Leslie Banks, Leo Genn, Esmond Knight and many other famous British actors of the
time grace and crowd the screen with powerful performances.
The DVD transfer, at least to me, seems extremely well done.
Sharp images, vivid colors and details that on a VHS tape and even on the Laserdisc looked somewhat washed out
are now fully restored to their original showing vision.
The sound is impeccable, despite being in Mono, it is now more rounded up and fuller than previous versions

The second is ""Hamlet"", in which Olivier truly takes center stage, both as a director and as an actor.
This one is in Black and White, but due to the gloomy and complex subject involving the title character, it seems
very appropriate and adds to the ""gray"" mood that pervades the whole plot.
By now, Hamlet had already established himself as a leading actor and this is even felt in his directing of this
movie. One can feel his confidence with the subject, as well as with the optical side and visual depiction of scenes.
This time Elsinore is represented as a rocky island in the midst of nowhere, in a somewhat surrealist vision of
Denmark, surrounded by depressing fog. Rare are the clear and sunny days.
All this contributes to a scene of uneasiness and impending doom looming on everyone involved.
The cast again, is worthy of mention, with again Leslie Banks, Esmond Knight and Niall MacGinnis, almost carried
over from ""Henry V"" as competent Shakespearean actors, and adding later screen household names such as Patrick Troughton
(appearing later in Hammer movies), Anthony Quayle (Lawrence of Arabia, The Fall of the Roman Empire, The Guns of Navarone),
Peter Cushing (another Hammer star and the original Doctor Who, as well as starring in Star Wars), Stanley Holloway
and Jean Simmons.
Again, and like the above, the Digital restoration and transfer are impeccable with smooth contrast variations and its
sound has been greatly improved, compared to earlier versions.
Dialogues are very clear and the sound effects are somewhat discreetly enhanced.

The third and final selection, can be considered to this day, Olivier's masterpiece: ""Richard III"" in a double-DVD version.
This is not your usual screen adaptation, but the dark look in an even darker corner of one of Shakespeare's more hated, and
at the same time, loved characters ever written on paper.
If one would set aside the historic figure of Richard III Plantagenet for a moment and take this, as his stereotyped and
simplified alter ego, then one could immediately jump into the character as depicted in this Elizabethan Drama.
Olivier's vision is impeccable, starting as he does, from the ending of ""Henry VI"" and dragging us swiftly by the hand, into
the plots and handlings of the Man who wanted a Crown, a Kingdom and ultimately be, the sole ruler of England.
Taking as a true premise and excuse the fact, that he was the legal Plantagenet heir to the throne, and therefore the only
true legitimate contender for this title, he then operates his plots.
But poor Richard makes a fatal mistake. He belongs to a long bygone era of battlefield warriors, absolutely not well versed
in diplomatic backstabbing and as such totally unfit to play such games.
The entire plot is revealed to us step by step and we are involved in it, as co-conspirators.
The decision by Olivier to address the Camera (therefore us), every time he is about to dispatch someone to his doom, was a
very risky one, but one that paid off handsomely, considering that he pulls us in with him, into the play and never to let us
lose.
In the end, at the resolution of the movie, one cannot but feel pity for this man's ultimate demise, precisely because by now,
we are one with the character.
As said, a very risky decision, but dramatically very clever and successful one.
Once again we are served with a cast worthy of such a movie. Starting from Ralph Richardson, John Gielgud, Claire Bloom and
Cedric Hardwicke, to Laurence Naismith and again Esmond Knight and John Laurie.
Add Stanley Baker, Michael Gough, Douglas Wilmer, Pamela Brown and Michael Ripper and you have some of the finest actors
assembled in one movie.
Like the other two, we are again served with an impeccable Digital remastering and transfer of the Film elements, and this
time, with more natural looking colors than ever and what seems to be a wide spectrum Digital Mono sound.
On Disc one you get the Movie, a very interesting and thorough commentary.
On Disc two you get an old, but highly informative and interesting interview with Laurence Olivier himself plus various
tiny gems and an essay by film historian Bruce Eder.

If one is really interested to watch true acting, good directing and well adapted versions of Shakespeare's plays, this
collection must be considered an insurmountable one.
It is an imperative one to have, even if you may have learned to appreciate newer versions of the same.
In such a case, they become a comparative study of what was, with what is and nevertheless a must for any scholar, or
passionate classic collector of movie gems such as these.",1252713600,12,5972,4.88560157790927
8123190,5,B000FILVO6,"Of this set, the weakest, if anything has a weakness at all, is Olivier's ""Hamlet,"" and it's still historic and wonderful in its way. Olivier's ""Henry V"" simply has to be experienced, as does his ""Richard III."" Both of them changed acting, Shakespeare on film, and therefore theatre as we know it. It will never substitute seeing Olivier onstage, which I was fortunate to have witnessed, but this shows his early power with the Bard in a way that prepares one for his later, revolutionary ""Othello"" and ""Merchant Of Venice."" Every theatre teacher should have this set.",1242950400,6,568,4.865979381443299
