6337846,5,B00J5SKAOO,"Simply, the best real crime show!",1405036800,,33,4.666666666666667
6337847,5,B00J5SKAOO,"I am fascinated by forensic science and ""Forensic Files"" never lets me down!  There is almost always some twist where I don't see it coming.  When it's a bit obvious, the forensics to ""make the case"" are the interesting part. In some shows they have to design the forensic tests to try to find the answers.  It can be gruesome, but it's nowhere near as gruesome as some of the shows I've watched.",1404777600,,396,4.397260273972603
6337848,5,B00J5SKAOO,love all these,1404432000,,14,4.0
6337849,5,B00J5SKAOO,"It's entertaining and detailed enough to keep my interest.  The only thing that viewers might want to keep in mind is that it can be somewhat gruesome, and it IS about death!  :)",1404172800,,178,4.363636363636363
6337850,5,B00J5SKAOO,The only thing more I could ask for is every original episode on a thumb drive.  I'd literally leave my wife if this show asked me to.  That's the level of dedication and love I have for this show,1482624000,,196,4.0
6337851,5,B00J5SKAOO,Very interesting,1482278400,,16,7.5
6337852,5,B00J5SKAOO,"I absolutely love watching Forensic Files. It's just so interesting to watch how they foil the criminals, and how these criminals think they're smarter than cops and Science. I mean, I ask myself: ""how can these crooks be this dumb???"" They do the most ignorant things, and then most of them plea INNOCENT, which amazes me, when the science proves they're guilty. There's nothing better than true crime.",1482105600,,403,4.9411764705882355
6337853,5,B00J5SKAOO,"These are brief, interesting programs detailing the forensic measures that help

6337862,5,B00J5SKAOO,They are very good shows!,1476921600,,25,4.2
6337863,5,B00J5SKAOO,Forensic Files is really well put together.  It tells stories were there is no make believe and use real people to give the facts of each case.  My wife and I watch these shows together and it is nothing for as to be talking about a particular case days after.  It is very interesting to see how real people are motivated to commit a crime and then try to cover their tracks.  Forensic Files has it all.,1476921600,,403,4.194805194805195

6337867,3,B00J5SKAOO,good series,1476144000,,11,5.0
6337868,3,B00J5SKAOO,"Before today I would have given 4 or 5 stars; however checking up on one of the episodes ""A Novel idea"" about the Michael Peterson case changed my mind. The episode interviewed SBI blood analyst Duane Deaver.  As it turns out Deaver had given ""materially misleading"" and ""deliberately false"" testimony about bloodstain evidence, and had exaggerated his training, experience, and expertise.  Not only that Deaver had falsely represented evidence in 34 cases, including withholding negative results in the case of Greg Taylor, a North Carolina man who spent 17 years in prison on a murder conviction based on Deaver's testimony.

The program producers never question the integrity of the prosecution.  There are countless cases in the US of the prosecution doing anything to get a conviction,  For those who do not know much about the law prosecutors are supposed to seek justice, not win every case no matter what.  Dozens of convicted murders have been released on new DNA evidence (just search ""convicted murderers released on new DNA evidence"").  In many of these cases police and/or the prosecution lied or exaggerated just to get a conviction.  Interesting how there is not a single episode that I saw on a wrongly convicted person exonerated on DNA evidence (there are 25 such cases on convicted murders alone).  The show gives a false impression of justice in the US.",1475884800,,1373,5.039823008849558

6337872,1,B00J5SKAOO,"In the past I have purchased the ""Historic Cases"" and ""Serial Killers"".  Those have about 6 episodes (or more) per disc and loved it.  This also had two discs, BUT only 3 episodes per disc AND only one episode is from Season 4.  This is SOOO not a good buy!!! Buy the compilation DVDs.  They may not have all the episodes that were great (because I REALLY love this show), but you won't feel sooo disappointed!",1474416000,,410,4.355263157894737

6338025,4,B00J5SKAOO,Seasons 3 & 4 were as good as the earlier years and the newer episodes.  Top notch true crime detection.  It's amazing how they are able to get the cooperation of so many people involved in each episode.  Combine that with the short interludes of re-enactments to tie it all together and there's nothing else like it on T.V.  The only downside with the older seasons is that some of the science and technology available now wasn't around back then.  So a few episodes seem rather dated.,1429401600,,486,4.540229885057471

6338038,5,B00J5SKAOO,"Currently available on Amazon Instant Video, The Best of Forensic Files Season 3 and 4 features six true crime cases where forensic evidence plays a key part in the resolution of a crime, or in one instance, proving a man's innocence.

The cases featured in the ""best of"" collection involve murder, rape, infanticide, and other acts of great violence, and are very compelling, despite their often brutal nature.  Typical for the series, production values are high, as the program does a solid job of presenting the facts, without being overdramatic or exploitive.  Proper respect to the victims and others involved is always shown, and the conduct of the law enforcement personnel investigating the crimes, appears to be entirely professional.

The development of DNA forensics was revolutionary, and the technology is frequently a key factor in breaking these cases.  The crimes featured are tragic and often brutal, but at least these particular cases have decisive conclusions, and don't leave many loose ends.  The cases are all of interest, but the episode featuring an investigation to discover the identity of a diabolical serial bomber, is particularly compelling.  For those with an interest in true crime, this collection of Forensic Files is well worth seeing.",1426291200,,1271,5.262376237623762

8648510,5,B00J5SKAOO,"I love this entire show's series. Peter Thomas is absolutely so calm and soothing that I can listen to gruesome details of crimes late at night while falling asleep. Watching how forensic science has been evolving over the years on my own and through this program especially, brings me peace of mind. There is always something left wherever you go, some trace evidence. I especially enjoy the shows that prove that innocent people can be convicted and later cleared since this is very important to me. I'm a law grad and the show has always held my interest because of the truth behind it. It's no CSI...there isn't a dna test back in an hour....it doesn't bluff you or say that all detectives are on top of their game. I love that it shows that those who should get caught by the law - are - and hope that it educates the public as to some of the lenient sentences many get for crimes like rape and manslaughter, while drug dealers are given mandatory minimums. It is a thinking person's show even as it walks you through the science so all can enjoy it. Thomas' narration style is so soothing to me that I put it on a timer while I'm going to sleep at night. I would listen to him read the phone book! He does an amazing job. The actors do too. Thanks to the scientists and lab techs doing good work, people that should be free are now free. Those who absolutely committed the crime should be in jail, and usually the show does give the sentence received.",1486166400,2,1457,4.380073800738008
