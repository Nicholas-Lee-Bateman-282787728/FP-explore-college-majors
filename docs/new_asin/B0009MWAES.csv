8513868,5,B0009MWAES,"I did receive my Joel Osteen VHS tape in record time and in perfect condition.  Since my funds are somewhat limited, I still have a VHS tape player and it was much more in-line with my budget than a DVD.  I've watched it several time with great appreciation.  Many thanks for the great service.
Sincerely and Merry Christmas to all Amazon employees and affiliates.
