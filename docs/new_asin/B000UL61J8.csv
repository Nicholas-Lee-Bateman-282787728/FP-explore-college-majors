8213651,1,B000UL61J8,"This is a rip-off.  The first picture stars The East Side Kids and Ava Gardner plays an extremely minimal role.  The second picture in their own words: ""...this heady drama stars Ava Gardner as the lost love of a dying adventurer/writer who, *on his deathbed, is haunted by her image.*  Wife Susan Hayward nurses him through his delirium, despite struggling to reconcile her husband's love for Garner.  The third picture is a loss, too, although -- at last -- one does actually see Avs Gardner.",1281484800,6,494,4.776470588235294

8213653,3,B000UL61J8,"For a ""signature collection"" this is very weak indeed.

Ava Gardner in ""Ghosts on the Loose"" is a minor back-up for the East Side Kids (Bowery Boys). Ava co-stars in ""Whistle Stop,"" an OK film (as far as George Raft vehicles go),  and the best of this small lot, ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro,"" has been in the public domain seemingly forever. Even here, Gardner plays third fiddle.

GHOSTS ON THE LOOSE-- One of the many hour-length comedies being churned out in the 1940s by MONOGRAM studios. A low-budget mild fright flick featuring Bela Lugosi, the requisite haunted house, and oh yes, Ava G.

SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO-- As a writer lays dying, he thinks about his life. Based on several Ernest Hemingway stories. Even the author didn't like this film.

WHISTLE STOP--  Mary returns to her home town, reigniting bad feelings in the little lover's triangle she had once been the hypotenuse of.
