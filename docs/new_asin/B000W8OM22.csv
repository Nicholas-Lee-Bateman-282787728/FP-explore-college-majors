2963392,4,B000W8OM22,"Although I only gave this  four stars , this is one of the best yes documentaries since Yesyears. This goes to their complete history and leaves off where Yesyears ended in 1991. I was so glad to see Peter Banks , Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes on this one as well as the other classic members of Yes. But it was sad to not see Tony Kaye and only one footage of Trevor Rabin about his leaving the band in 95. The real interesting interview on the 2nd disc is the bonus one of Peter Banks , who was supposed to be a sit in guest on the ""Union"" tour until he claims that Steve Howe said he could not join. It happened to be a a concert at the L.A. Forum that I had attended being a die hard Yes fan. Of course like the Moody Blues dvd, There are only Three full music videos. I was not surprised by this , nor was I surprised that one on the videos was Wonderous Stories. But I was pleased that that with the other two being Tempus Fugit , and the full length wersion of Owner of a lonely Heart , I would had hope that the black and white footage from the beat club in 1969 , and the old footage of Yours is no disgrace was included. In spite of this I do think that this is a great successor to Yesyears and is  a must for true Yes fans.",1200441600,10,1234,3.892857142857143
2963393,4,B000W8OM22,"Great to hear and see the complete story of Yes told by themselves. You have to be a fan and be familiar with their music, otherwise this DVD-set might be a bit disappointing. Because this DVD-set is absolutely NOT ""packed"" with music, video and photographs as promissed. Maybe 10 minutes at the most of video during a 3,5 hour interview is far too little to be called ""packed"". But nevertheless, I enjoyed it very much.",1199318400,3,420,4.613333333333333
2963394,5,B000W8OM22,"Yes, has been, IS, and always will be the soundtrack of my life. I have read everything about them, seen many of their shows, have ALL their releases and  will own this one. Thank you YES for a lifetime of pure enlightenment!",1199318400,2,225,4.357142857142857
2963395,5,B000W8OM22,"I've now revised my original review after watching both the interviews and supplemental material.  This is a great documentary of Yes and comparable to YesYears, the documentary filmed back in 1991.

What makes this documentary unique is that we have many more individuals related to the Yes organization through the years including Mike Tate, Roy Clair (Sound Systems), Eddie Offord, Phil Carson, and a few of Yes's former managers (Except Brian Lane of course).  Peter Banks, original guitarist of Yes is featured here as well.  Bill Bruford is back again as well as all current members of Yes.

This appears to be a British Production and very well done indeed.  The video generally interviews current and former members during each stage of development of Yes's Career.  Many of the same stories are told again, such as Bruford's account of early Yes travel when they drove themselves to the gigs then driving asleep at the wheel on the way back which led him to arrange alternate travel.

Peter Banks for the first time recounts his firing from the band on video.  Steve Howe talks about his feelings on the 80's version of YES in detail and difficulty dealing with the dual guitar role on the Union Tour.  Chris Welch, Biographer of Yes and former Melody Maker writer recounts many memories of the band.  I don't really consider him an authority on YES exclusively, but he was more or less responsible for helping them gain exposure in England.  Since I've heard many of the same re-counting from most of the bandmembers, I enjoyed the blunt honesty of producer Eddie Offord and Mike Tate since they were closest to the organization during that time.

Missing from the DVD are again, Patrick Moraz, Former Manager Brian Lane, however Trevor Horn, Geoff Downes are on here and give very detailed accounts of the recordings of Drama.  Trevor talks about touring with Yes in the 80's as well as the production of 90125 in which he was the producer.

Supplemental Material is excellent, and there is also a small interview with Keith Emerson as he recounts a story of being asked to join Yes.

There were some good moments where Mike Tate told the story of how Yes obtained their first decent PA system from IRON BUTTERFLY.  They generally signed over all publishing rights to obtain this.  Insane.  Bill Bruford on the other hand was told to give half his royalities to Alan White when he wanted to leave the band, due to Brian Lane.  This was brought up in Chris Welch's biography of Yes.

  I have in the past recommended that each current and former bandmember should write a detailed account of their own Yes Story including an in- depth look at Yes's song construction process as well as studio work.  Biographers have tried this but I believe they continually fail.  Chris Welch, Biographer of Yes ""Close To the Edge"", story of Yes for example in his video comments here, gives his negative criticism of such albums as Tales from Topographic Oceans and even the Relayer Album which were still two of Yes's most underrated work yet are still masterpieces, so I could not agree with some of his comments. I believe Chris Welch's over-exposure in this documentary actually hurts it, but I am not taking off points here because there are still many other views.

  Overall, an excellent addition to the YES DVD collection and I recommend it highly.",1196899200,8,3353,4.7843478260869565
2963396,5,B000W8OM22,"This is a great documentary on the history of Yes, featuring not only its current members, but also a big number of people that were important for the band, as Eddie Offord, Roger Dean or Peter Banks, and even Ahmet and Keith Emerson speak a couple of times!

It has a very interesting approach from each one of the band members, giving their very personal opinion in every album or Yes situation.

It does not include a lot of live footage, it's basically interviews and cool pictures. It is very detailed and even funny occasionally.
Excelent DVD!!!",1245369600,,551,4.670103092783505
2963397,5,B000W8OM22,"This is an excellent documentary about the music of Yes directly from those who participated in its making. If you are looking for music, though, this is NOT the video for you.",1235433600,,176,4.53125
2963398,5,B000W8OM22,"This only my 2nd review. I would highly recomend this Dvd to anyone who considers themselves a true Yes fan. I found the product highly entertaining and informitive. I had hoped for more hidden concert shots but never the less a great video for the colletor.

Cheers Richard Glenn",1227398400,,280,4.714285714285714
2963399,5,B000W8OM22,"This DVD apart from being good value for money being over 5 hours long, gives the most comprehensive detailed story of how the worlds best progressive band formed and kept it together for the 40 yrs they have been going.  The DVD is mainly interviews with the band members and the key people who have assisted in the process of making this group what it is today. The interviews are in depth and help you understand why there have been so many band member changes over the years. Whilst most YES fans will know most of their story throughout the last 40 yrs, this DVD goes into greater depth and fills in the missing details etc. I recommend this DVD to all YES fans both young and old. Enjoy the memories.",1219795200,,706,4.3893129770992365
2963400,3,B000W8OM22,"This is a very good documentary and updates the video story of the band after the terrific ""Yes Years"" from 1991.  Sadly, unlike Yes Years, this film is based entirely on the interviews and has precious little video footage from the studio or road.  There's a nice chronology, from album to album (as with Yes Years) but I missed seeing video footage of the guys at those times.  Instead, you get the guys TODAY sitting at home or wherever, reminiscing about those times.  Which is great in its own way, but I missed the archival footage that made Yesyears so great.  In a couple spots, they gloss over the stories behind certain albums much too quickly.  Where Yesyears celebrated ""Going for the One"" and gave it the attention it deserved, this film kinda skips past it, with very little discussion behind the greatness of epics like ""Awaken.""  In Yesyears we got to see footage of the guys making GFTO in Montreaux.  We learned how those songs came together, and we saw the music being made.  Here, it's just talk about it.  Oh, and there's NO discussion whatsoever of the solo albums done by each band member in 1976.  And no disussion of the aborted album from 1979.  I did like how they gave Drama the re-examination it deserved, with interviews from Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes.  That was cool.

If you're a longtime Yes fan, this DVD is a must for the comprehensive coverage of the band's history.  If you're a relative newcomer, you might be best off starting with Yesyears to get a more well-rounded lesson on the classic yes stuff first.",1217808000,16,1548,4.619047619047619
2963401,4,B000W8OM22,"Five and a half hours of great interviews with a few videos and other treats. The interviews cover all Yes albums in chronological order, all the way through Magnification. Almost everyone is interviewed but sadly not Patrick Moraz and a few others. Most die-hard Yes fans will already  know some of the information given but all will walk away with knowledge they never had before. I only wish everyone spoke as clearly as Bill Bruford.",1211068800,4,437,4.826666666666667
2963402,5,B000W8OM22,"This is absolutely the most definitive history available for YES that has been released to this date.  And for a YES fan, any YES fan, it is an absolute must-have.  Not having this would be the equivalent of not owning a copy of Fragile or Close to the Edge.  And like the music that came from those great albums, this documentary is long, thorough, detailed, honest, and very much worth having.

So far there has been a lot of buzz comparing this video to YESYears, which is not an unfair comparison.  But this, and not merely because it is more recent, is a far superior, and more complete YES documentary. And for the record, this comes from somebody who thinks that the YESYears video is not all that bad.  But being completely honest, it was told with a somewhat one-sided and biased view towards the ""80's modern"" YES.  It also attempted to gloss over some of the tensions behind the band's history - all of this in support of the notion that Union was a happy, well-thought-out notion that the entire band really loved.

The main reason that this one is better is because it was not produced to support any particular CD or tour and maintains a much more balanced view with regards to the band's history and the relationships therein.  YESYears has some great footage and some really good interviews.  But again, it is told from the perspective that the Union tour is the ultimate Be-All and End-All to the story YES.  This documentary spends much more time and goes into greater detail regarding the band's formation and history.  And not just regarding the musicians, but the managers, and engineers too.  There is a good chance that you will get to match some names to faces for the first time when watching this video.

What elevates this documentary to the status of superb is the unbridled honesty that is put forth from both principle band members and others who've contributed along the way -- people such as Peter Banks, Trevor Horn, and Roger Dean.  Trevor Rabin's presence is minimal, a short interview with him talking about how he got started doing soundtracks - by giving guitar lessons to, of all people, Steven Segal.  Still, credit where credit is due, the albums from the Trevor Rabin years are talked about in detail by many of the band members and much of what they have to say is both interesting and surprising.  Steve Howe talks at length about touring with Asia and then listening to 90125 for the first time, then half-jokingly half-serious saying, ""they want to be like Asia."" But after talking for a while about both 90125 and Big Generator, one learns that Howe's opinion of 90125 is not as harsh as one might expect.  In fact watching the extended interview clips contained on the second disc reveals Steve Howe talking about listening to the song ""Changes"" many years later and admitting that the song elevates 90125 to the status of a legitimate YES album, despite its commercial nature.  This, for someone who got started with the Rabin era of YES, comes as a ringing endorsement of approval.  Of course his comments on Big Generator were exactly what one would expect - but still significant and actually kind of funny. Then again, Rick Wakeman talks about how he would have loved to have played on Big Generator against Trevor Rabin.  But then YES never was one to agree on things.

Other memorable moments include Rick Wakeman talking about how much he hated the Union album an threw his copy of out the window of a moving car onto a Florida highway and wondering if it is sill there.  Later however he admits that as much as he loathed the record the 8-member tour was amazing.  Trevor Horn has a lot to say about the eighties. Bill Bruford talks cynically about recent YES projects as something that resembles a YES cover band where the members are present in mind and body only.  And of course, there is the endless debate over whether or not ""Tales from Topographic Oceans"" was musical brilliance or tonal trash.  Stories like this, and many others are what comprise this 204 minute documentary.  It does not feel that long at all.  Another mark of its quality

It ends with some out-loud thinking about what YES will do next.  There are thoughts voiced about another album or a farewell tour.  There seems to be a general consensus that whatever they do should be something special and not merely another obligatory farewell tour to sell yet another concert video that can be followed up by yet another farewell tour.  Whatever YES decides, there is something poignant about the unmistakable feeling that, we may be nearing the end of the YES journey.  If that does indeed turn out to be true then watching this documentary should leave any YES fan out there with a sense that they left it all on the stage when they walked away.  And that is a good thing.",1207612800,6,4803,4.644970414201183
2963403,5,B000W8OM22,"Actually, I was struggling between putting 4 or 5 stars... the thing is that indeed as some may say there is indeed a lot of talking on this DVD and not much music or video material... though there are some interesting pictures on it, that is for sure... still I am giving it 5 stars because it is very interesting to hear the story of the group development not only from Yes members but also from other people strongly connected to their fate... besides for the first time you will get to hear commentaries of Peter Banks, Eddie Offord, and Drama members Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes... also there is a couple of interviews with Keith Emerson... though Tony Kaye was left out, Trevor Rabin appears only in a small speech... no Patrick Moraz again... but still, this DVD is very interesting... if you're a hardcore fan, than definitely buy it.. if not.. I am still sure you will like it.",1205193600,,887,4.515527950310559
2963404,5,B000W8OM22,"I'm a big YES fan and this is a great compliment to the YESYEARS DVD that came out in 1991. It answers a lot of the questions about the many changes in the band since then although I agree with an earlier review that a few more Yes-tunes in the background would have been an improvement. Especially interesting as it is done mostly through interviews with almost all past band members. If you're a fan of YES, you should enjoy it, just don't look for a lot of concert footage (get YESSYMPHONIC or SONGS FROM TSONGAS) as well.",1204848000,,525,4.36734693877551
2963405,4,B000W8OM22,"One thing you could never accuse Yes of is restraint. The same band that gave us double albums consisting of four song titles has now released their `authorized' biography, and it is almost as overwhelmingly self-indulgent as ""Tales of Topographic Oceans"" - but I wouldn't want it any other way. I loved Yes in the `70s. They were such a unique animal that they stood apart from virtually anything else on the scene at that time, and to be sure, no other band ever really approached their combination of intelligence and overkill. The Roger Dean-designed cover for this package promises something extraordinary, as if the old band had somehow turned back the time machine to the days of their classic era. Of course, that would be impossible, but there are elements of this collection that revive old sentiments for the band most responsible for creating `progressive rock'.
 Except for background and severely edited bits, the first disk contains virtually no music at all. Instead, the disk rambles on for three and one-half hours of interviews with virtually every bandmember. You could play ""The Yes Album"" six times in the amount of time it takes to view the interviews on disk one. ""Gone With the Wind"" is concise in comparison, but the interviews are nonetheless fascinating. Once you get past the visual image of how each member has aged (Chris Squire was almost unrecognizable to me), it becomes apparent that 200+ minutes of interviews is appropriate for a band known for its bombast and sprawling vision. Each member is extraordinarily honest and candid in their recollections, and amusing as well. The video is edited extremely well, switching from person to person with a continuity that allows us to see various aspects of the same story. It is wonderful to see each member speak with candor, and fans will get to know each bandmember in ways that were previously impossible.
 As if that weren't enough, a second disk contains an additional hour or so of edited interview footage, which is complete overkill. Comparatively, the music content is paltry, with three vintage videos (that are hilarious in retrospect) and some low-tech, extraneous rehearsal footage dating from 1996. In short, the entire package revolves around whether or not you care to hear the bandmembers recount the convoluted story of one of rock and roll's most tumultuous bands. It is long (and long-winded), but it is also a wondrous story. B+ Tom Ryan",1203811200,39,2439,4.9754901960784315
2963406,5,B000W8OM22,"The story of Yes in their own words, where they are now, what they feel now, recent extensive, exclusive interviews of those in the band now and past band members, interviews of those who have journeyed with them in their 40-year career, unseen rehearsal footage, things you may have never known about them, this is IT! The first disc is 204 minutes, the second 134 minutes. You will definitely get more than your money's worth!",1203724800,,428,4.72
2963407,5,B000W8OM22,"DVD arrived yesterday, and I settled in last night to watch it.  I thought it was a well-produced, excellently scripted documentary.  It's an interesting story to say the least, especially for Yes fans, of all the behind the scenes goings on of a legendary rock band, the reasons for management changes, personnel line ups, etc.  I thought this DVD did a great job of pulling everything together in a chronological, straight forward manner.  Cool to hear interviews from various engineers,producers, and record executives as well as the band members themselves.  This is a must have for YES fans, but even if you only have an interest in how a couple of guys can start off from floor sweeping to becoming megastars of rock, you've got to get this DVD!",1202860800,2,751,4.790697674418604
2963408,4,B000W8OM22,"Do NOT think that this is a performance DVD. This is the history of YES, as told by the band members and other participants. There are over 3 hours of interviews, clips and photos. The interviews are all new, and the clips have not been seen in years, if ever. Many of the stories have been told before, but some are being heard for the first time on this DVD

It was interesting to see and hear from some of the former members such as Peter Banks and Trevor Horn. Other people in the background such as Eddie Offord and Mike Tait also add their points of view. They give a different perspective on events than had been told previously.

In the extended interviews on the 2nd disk, it would have been better if the interviewer had been mic'd. It's difficult to hear the questions being asked of the subject.

I really enjoyed this, but even as a long time hardcore fan, I could not sit through this in it's entirety without a break.",1202860800,,932,4.344827586206897
2963409,3,B000W8OM22,"Here's a double DVD of a very detailed history on the group Yes.  This first DVD goes on for over 3 and a half hours.  That's a lot of ""blah-blah-blah"" to have to sit through.  You'd have to be a very big fan of Yes to want to savor every word being said here.  And then you get a second DVD with even more ""even less interesting"" dialogue plus you get to see some videos (unfortunately cropped for widescreen instead of their original full screen format).

I love Yes.  But, I enjoy the YesYears DVD better for a few good reasons.  YesYears is one DVD and it only runs about 94 minutes.  YesYears sticks to very important information about Yes so that even the non-Yes fan may capture interest in Yes.

And, what's very important about the difference between this Classic Artists release and YesYears is that YesYears has a much better video quality.  This DVD video quality is rather fuzzy and muddy.  So it's way too long of an eyesore to have to sit through.  Especially twice or more.

I've rented these two DVD's of Yes: Classic Artists and I just wasn't too impressed.  After I watched them, I then watched my copy of YesYears.  YesYears is definitely more interesting and looks very good on DVD.  Much higher quality picture and sound.  It may be out of print now, but if you're a serious Yes Fan, you should look for it used somewhere.  However, I doubt you'll ever find it easily.  No true Yes fan that has it would give it up, I'm sure.",1202601600,3,1447,4.392452830188679
2963410,4,B000W8OM22,"The production of this is on par with the Moody Blues and Cream bio-pics from CA. However, I just didn't find this as satisfying because I think it goes on a little too long. I would have liked to have seen some tighter editing. The extra unused footage could easily have become special features.

If you're a hard core fan you will have heard much of this, but you might find a few new tidbits. The lack of a new interview with Trevor Rabin or any with Pat Moraz is more than offset by the inclusion of Tait, Offord and others close to the band over the years. Bill Bruford, Chris Squire and Steve Howe are generally the most entertaining and most willing to share details. A better picture of the inner workings of the band are presented here than other documentaries.

I still think YesYears is the best documentary on Yes, but this one definitely fills in a lot of holes and is easily the second best by a long way.

Other than that, I highly reccomend that all YES fans purchase this DVD. It is, in my opinion, the best documentry on the band that has been made. It comes as a 2 disc set. The first is a complete history of the band with great interviews. The second disc contains extra interviews, 3 video's, and a picture gallery. Plus, there is also a 20 page booklet with some very nice pictures in it. A great addition to any YES fan's collection.",1201392000,3,588,4.3545454545454545

2963414,5,B000W8OM22,"Gosh, it was great to finally have this released in the USA, I think all YES fans will find this of interest. At over 338 minutes, I did watch most of it in one sitting, there are extensive new interviews with the main Classic YES band members, including Bill. I thought that Michael, Eddie,Roy and the Dean brothers had the best take on the band. Jon Brewer as a director was just OK. Jon Anderson should never be back lit like that ever again in an interview! Having Rick in a yellow dressing room under florescent lights completely washed him out, Alan and Geoff seemed to be slumped down into wing back chairs, if I had been director none of this would have happened! Chris, Steve, Bill and Peter seemed to be lit better, although the settings were at times very dated. Great to hear from Trevor Rabin and Trevor Horn was very interesting.

YES is a musical and visual feast, I wish the interviews had been better directed from that stand point, and Chris Welch had asked questions not addressed in his book, where was Paul Silviera and Jim Halley?
The NYC rehearshing footage was fun, Rick and Chris seemed in great spirits. I would recommend this double DVD Doc. to any YES music fan, just have some friends over and make it an event. Now that we have finally got 3 Ships offically released, Swiss Choir ( fantastic by the way) Circa, a New Asia CD, Steve and Rick seem to always be putting out material, and Jon touring Canada in March, the boys are up and running. Just a quick note to the management of YES, don't screw up this opportunity to Celebrate the bands 40th, get Michael Tate back on board, Clair Sound, Eddie if only to mix a live taping and give the Deans some real money, take a look at the ABWH stage set, it has not been the same or as good since!
YES deserve the best, and that includes a healthy marketing budget.
Oh back to the DVD.............Buy it Now! YES right now, let's show the management how many YES fans there really are out here, but please guys new music when you can......",1200960000,2,2013,4.411290322580645

Well,....it is a whole DVD of interviews,BUT little music is here.

At a running time of over 2 hours this was a chore to watch even for a big fan,and I am a fanatic for Yes.  Yeah,there's loads of in depth information. But if they just kept putting a few minutes of performance in once in a while or even added a soundtrack of Yes music in the show's background then it might not get to feel so long winded.

This is a one-off watching experience for me. I mean how many times can you view a long set of interviews?  I haven't seen the performance extras yet.  But I am so glad that I paid only $9.72 for this!

I'd recommend this ONLY to the most AVID of Fans!  I wished for more from this.",1200787200,7,813,4.10126582278481

What makes this documentary unique is that we have many more individuals related to the Yes organization through the years including Mike Tate, Roy Clair (Sound Systems), Eddie Offord, Phil Carson, and a few of Yes's former managers (Except Brian Lane of course).  Peter Banks, original guitarist of Yes is featured here as well.  Bill Bruford is back again as well as all current members of Yes.

This appears to be a British Production and very well done indeed.  The video generally interviews current and former members during each stage of development of Yes's Career.  Many of the same stories are told again, such as Bruford's account of early Yes travel when they drove themselves to the gigs then driving asleep at the wheel on the way back which led him to arrange alternate travel.

Peter Banks for the first time recounts his firing from the band on video.  Steve Howe talks about his feelings on the 80's version of YES in detail and difficulty dealing with the dual guitar role on the Union Tour.  Chris Welch, Biographer of Yes and former Melody Maker writer recounts many memories of the band.  I don't really consider him an authority on YES exclusively, but he was more or less responsible for helping them gain exposure in England.  Since I've heard many of the same re-counting from most of the bandmembers, I enjoyed the blunt honesty of producer Eddie Offord and Mike Tate since they were closest to the organization during that time.

Missing from the DVD are again, Patrick Moraz, Former Manager Brian Lane, however Trevor Horn, Geoff Downes are on here and give very detailed accounts of the recordings of Drama.  Trevor talks about touring with Yes in the 80's as well as the production of 90125 in which he was the producer.

Supplemental Material is excellent, and there is also a small interview with Keith Emerson as he recounts a story of being asked to join Yes.

There were some good moments where Mike Tate told the story of how Yes obtained their first decent PA system from IRON BUTTERFLY.  They generally signed over all publishing rights to obtain this.  Insane.  Bill Bruford on the other hand was told to give half his royalities to Alan White when he wanted to leave the band, due to Brian Lane.  This was brought up in Chris Welch's biography of Yes.

  I have in the past recommended that each current and former bandmember should write a detailed account of their own Yes Story including an in- depth look at Yes's song construction process as well as studio work.  Biographers have tried this but I believe they continually fail.  Chris Welch, Biographer of Yes ""Close To the Edge"", story of Yes for example in his video comments here, gives his negative criticism of such albums as Tales from Topographic Oceans and even the Relayer Album which were still two of Yes's most underrated work yet are still masterpieces, so I could not agree with some of his comments. I believe Chris Welch's over-exposure in this documentary actually hurts it, but I am not taking off points here because there are still many other views.

  Overall, an excellent addition to the YES DVD collection and I recommend it highly.",1196899200,8,3353,4.7843478260869565

It has a very interesting approach from each one of the band members, giving their very personal opinion in every album or Yes situation.

It does not include a lot of live footage, it's basically interviews and cool pictures. It is very detailed and even funny occasionally.
Excelent DVD!!!",1245369600,,551,4.670103092783505

The DVD is mainly interviews with the band members and the key people who have assisted in the process of making this group what it is today. The interviews are in depth and help you understand why there have been so many band member changes over the years. Whilst most YES fans will know most of their story throughout the last 40 yrs, this DVD goes into greater depth and fills in the missing details etc. I recommend this DVD to all YES fans both young and old.

3197897,3,B000W8OM22,"This is a very good documentary and updates the video story of the band after the terrific ""Yes Years"" from 1991.  Sadly, unlike Yes Years, this film is based entirely on the interviews and has precious little video footage from the studio or road.  There's a nice chronology, from album to album (as with Yes Years) but I missed seeing video footage of the guys at those times.  Instead, you get the guys TODAY sitting at home or wherever, reminiscing about those times.  Which is great in its own way, but I missed the archival footage that made Yesyears so great.  In a couple spots, they gloss over the stories behind certain albums much too quickly.  Where Yesyears celebrated ""Going for the One"" and gave it the attention it deserved, this film kinda skips past it, with very little discussion behind the greatness of epics like ""Awaken.""  In Yesyears we got to see footage of the guys making GFTO in Montreaux.  We learned how those songs came together, and we saw the music being made.  Here, it's just talk about it.  Oh, and there's NO discussion whatsoever of the solo albums done by each band member in 1976.  And no disussion of the aborted album from 1979.  I did like how they gave Drama the re-examination it deserved, with interviews from Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes.  That was cool.

If you're a longtime Yes fan, this DVD is a must for the comprehensive coverage of the band's history.  If you're a relative newcomer, you might be best off starting with Yesyears to get a more well-rounded lesson on the classic yes stuff first.",1217808000,16,1548,4.619047619047619
3197898,4,B000W8OM22,"Five and a half hours of great interviews with a few videos and other treats. The interviews cover all Yes albums in chronological order, all the way through Magnification. Almost everyone is interviewed but sadly not Patrick Moraz and a few others. Most die-hard Yes fans will already  know some of the information given but all will walk away with knowledge they never had before. I only wish everyone spoke as clearly as Bill Bruford.",1211068800,4,437,4.826666666666667
3197899,5,B000W8OM22,"This is absolutely the most definitive history available for YES that has been released to this date.  And for a YES fan, any YES fan, it is an absolute must-have.  Not having this would be the equivalent of not owning a copy of Fragile or Close to the Edge.  And like the music that came from those great albums, this documentary is long, thorough, detailed, honest, and very much worth having.

So far there has been a lot of buzz comparing this video to YESYears, which is not an unfair comparison.  But this, and not merely because it is more recent, is a far superior, and more complete YES documentary. And for the record, this comes from somebody who thinks that the YESYears video is not all that bad.  But being completely honest, it was told with a somewhat one-sided and biased view towards the ""80's modern"" YES.  It also attempted to gloss over some of the tensions behind the band's history - all of this in support of the notion that Union was a happy, well-thought-out notion that the entire band really loved.

The main reason that this one is better is because it was not produced to support any particular CD or tour and maintains a much more balanced view with regards to the band's history and the relationships therein.  YESYears has some great footage and some really good interviews.  But again, it is told from the perspective that the Union tour is the ultimate Be-All and End-All to the story YES.  This documentary spends much more time and goes into greater detail regarding the band's formation and history.  And not just regarding the musicians, but the managers, and engineers too.  There is a good chance that you will get to match some names to faces for the first time when watching this video.

What elevates this documentary to the status of superb is the unbridled honesty that is put forth from both principle band members and others who've contributed along the way -- people such as Peter Banks, Trevor Horn, and Roger Dean.  Trevor Rabin's presence is minimal, a short interview with him talking about how he got started doing soundtracks - by giving guitar lessons to, of all people, Steven Segal.  Still, credit where credit is due, the albums from the Trevor Rabin years are talked about in detail by many of the band members and much of what they have to say is both interesting and surprising.  Steve Howe talks at length about touring with Asia and then listening to 90125 for the first time, then half-jokingly half-serious saying, ""they want to be like Asia."" But after talking for a while about both 90125 and Big Generator, one learns that Howe's opinion of 90125 is not as harsh as one might expect.  In fact watching the extended interview clips contained on the second disc reveals Steve Howe talking about listening to the song ""Changes"" many years later and admitting that the song elevates 90125 to the status of a legitimate YES album, despite its commercial nature.  This, for someone who got started with the Rabin era of YES, comes as a ringing endorsement of approval.  Of course his comments on Big Generator were exactly what one would expect - but still significant and actually kind of funny. Then again, Rick Wakeman talks about how he would have loved to have played on Big Generator against Trevor Rabin.  But then YES never was one to agree on things.

Other memorable moments include Rick Wakeman talking about how much he hated the Union album an threw his copy of out the window of a moving car onto a Florida highway and wondering if it is sill there.  Later however he admits that as much as he loathed the record the 8-member tour was amazing.  Trevor Horn has a lot to say about the eighties. Bill Bruford talks cynically about recent YES projects as something that resembles a YES cover band where the members are present in mind and body only.  And of course, there is the endless debate over whether or not ""Tales from Topographic Oceans"" was musical brilliance or tonal trash.  Stories like this, and many others are what comprise this 204 minute documentary.  It does not feel that long at all.  Another mark of its quality

It ends with some out-loud thinking about what YES will do next.  There are thoughts voiced about another album or a farewell tour.  There seems to be a general consensus that whatever they do should be something special and not merely another obligatory farewell tour to sell yet another concert video that can be followed up by yet another farewell tour.  Whatever YES decides, there is something poignant about the unmistakable feeling that, we may be nearing the end of the YES journey.  If that does indeed turn out to be true then watching this documentary should leave any YES fan out there with a sense that they left it all on the stage when they walked away.  And that is a good thing.",1207612800,6,4803,4.644970414201183
3197900,5,B000W8OM22,"Actually, I was struggling between putting 4 or 5 stars... the thing is that indeed as some may say there is indeed a lot of talking on this DVD and not much music or video material... though there are some interesting pictures on it, that is for sure... still I am giving it 5 stars because it is very interesting to hear the story of the group development not only from Yes members but also from other people strongly connected to their fate... besides for the first time you will get to hear commentaries of Peter Banks, Eddie Offord, and Drama members Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes... also there is a couple of interviews with Keith Emerson... though Tony Kaye was left out, Trevor Rabin appears only in a small speech... no Patrick Moraz again... but still, this DVD is very interesting... if you're a hardcore fan, than definitely buy it.. if not..

It answers a lot of the questions about the many changes in the band since then although I agree with an earlier review that a few more Yes-tunes in the background would have been an improvement. Especially interesting as it is done mostly through interviews with almost all past band members. If you're a fan of YES, you should enjoy it, just don't look for a lot of concert footage (get YESSYMPHONIC or SONGS FROM TSONGAS) as well.",1204848000,,525,4.36734693877551
3197902,4,B000W8OM22,"One thing you could never accuse Yes of is restraint. The same band that gave us double albums consisting of four song titles has now released their `authorized' biography, and it is almost as overwhelmingly self-indulgent as ""Tales of Topographic Oceans"" - but I wouldn't want it any other way. I loved Yes in the `70s. They were such a unique animal that they stood apart from virtually anything else on the scene at that time, and to be sure, no other band ever really approached their combination of intelligence and overkill. The Roger Dean-designed cover for this package promises something extraordinary, as if the old band had somehow turned back the time machine to the days of their classic era. Of course, that would be impossible, but there are elements of this collection that revive old sentiments for the band most responsible for creating `progressive rock'.
 Except for background and severely edited bits, the first disk contains virtually no music at all. Instead, the disk rambles on for three and one-half hours of interviews with virtually every bandmember. You could play ""The Yes Album"" six times in the amount of time it takes to view the interviews on disk one. ""Gone With the Wind"" is concise in comparison, but the interviews are nonetheless fascinating. Once you get past the visual image of how each member has aged (Chris Squire was almost unrecognizable to me), it becomes apparent that 200+ minutes of interviews is appropriate for a band known for its bombast and sprawling vision. Each member is extraordinarily honest and candid in their recollections, and amusing as well. The video is edited extremely well, switching from person to person with a continuity that allows us to see various aspects of the same story. It is wonderful to see each member speak with candor, and fans will get to know each bandmember in ways that were previously impossible.
 As if that weren't enough, a second disk contains an additional hour or so of edited interview footage, which is complete overkill. Comparatively, the music content is paltry, with three vintage videos (that are hilarious in retrospect) and some low-tech, extraneous rehearsal footage dating from 1996. In short, the entire package revolves around whether or not you care to hear the bandmembers recount the convoluted story of one of rock and roll's most tumultuous bands. It is long (and long-winded), but it is also a wondrous story. B+ Tom Ryan",1203811200,39,2439,4.9754901960784315

It's an interesting story to say the least, especially for Yes fans, of all the behind the scenes goings on of a legendary rock band, the reasons for management changes, personnel line ups, etc.  I thought this DVD did a great job of pulling everything together in a chronological, straight forward manner.  Cool to hear interviews from various engineers,producers, and record executives as well as the band members themselves.  This is a must have for YES fans, but even if you only have an interest in how a couple of guys can start off from floor sweeping to becoming megastars of rock, you've got to get this DVD!",1202860800,2,751,4.790697674418604

There are over 3 hours of interviews, clips and photos. The interviews are all new, and the clips have not been seen in years, if ever. Many of the stories have been told before, but some are being heard for the first time on this DVD

It was interesting to see and hear from some of the former members such as Peter Banks and Trevor Horn. Other people in the background such as Eddie Offord and Mike Tait also add their points of view. They give a different perspective on events than had been told previously.

In the extended interviews on the 2nd disk, it would have been better if the interviewer had been mic'd. It's difficult to hear the questions being asked of the subject.

3197906,3,B000W8OM22,"Here's a double DVD of a very detailed history on the group Yes.  This first DVD goes on for over 3 and a half hours.  That's a lot of ""blah-blah-blah"" to have to sit through.  You'd have to be a very big fan of Yes to want to savor every word being said here.  And then you get a second DVD with even more ""even less interesting"" dialogue plus you get to see some videos (unfortunately cropped for widescreen instead of their original full screen format).

I love Yes.  But, I enjoy the YesYears DVD better for a few good reasons.  YesYears is one DVD and it only runs about 94 minutes.  YesYears sticks to very important information about Yes so that even the non-Yes fan may capture interest in Yes.

And, what's very important about the difference between this Classic Artists release and YesYears is that YesYears has a much better video quality.  This DVD video quality is rather fuzzy and muddy.  So it's way too long of an eyesore to have to sit through.  Especially twice or more.

I've rented these two DVD's of Yes: Classic Artists and I just wasn't too impressed.  After I watched them, I then watched my copy of YesYears.  YesYears is definitely more interesting and looks very good on DVD.  Much higher quality picture and sound.  It may be out of print now, but if you're a serious Yes Fan, you should look for it used somewhere.  However, I doubt you'll ever find it easily.

I would have liked to have seen some tighter editing. The extra unused footage could easily have become special features.

If you're a hard core fan you will have heard much of this, but you might find a few new tidbits. The lack of a new interview with Trevor Rabin or any with Pat Moraz is more than offset by the inclusion of Tait, Offord and others close to the band over the years. Bill Bruford, Chris Squire and Steve Howe are generally the most entertaining and most willing to share details. A better picture of the inner workings of the band are presented here than other documentaries.

I still think YesYears is the best documentary on Yes, but this one definitely fills in a lot of holes and is easily the second best by a long way.

3197911,5,B000W8OM22,"Gosh, it was great to finally have this released in the USA, I think all YES fans will find this of interest. At over 338 minutes, I did watch most of it in one sitting, there are extensive new interviews with the main Classic YES band members, including Bill. I thought that Michael, Eddie,Roy and the Dean brothers had the best take on the band. Jon Brewer as a director was just OK. Jon Anderson should never be back lit like that ever again in an interview! Having Rick in a yellow dressing room under florescent lights completely washed him out, Alan and Geoff seemed to be slumped down into wing back chairs, if I had been director none of this would have happened! Chris, Steve, Bill and Peter seemed to be lit better, although the settings were at times very dated. Great to hear from Trevor Rabin and Trevor Horn was very interesting.

YES is a musical and visual feast, I wish the interviews had been better directed from that stand point, and Chris Welch had asked questions not addressed in his book, where was Paul Silviera and Jim Halley?
The NYC rehearshing footage was fun, Rick and Chris seemed in great spirits. I would recommend this double DVD Doc. to any YES music fan, just have some friends over and make it an event. Now that we have finally got 3 Ships offically released, Swiss Choir ( fantastic by the way) Circa, a New Asia CD, Steve and Rick seem to always be putting out material, and Jon touring Canada in March, the boys are up and running. Just a quick note to the management of YES, don't screw up this opportunity to Celebrate the bands 40th, get Michael Tate back on board, Clair Sound, Eddie if only to mix a live taping and give the Deans some real money, take a look at the ABWH stage set, it has not been the same or as good since!

But if they just kept putting a few minutes of performance in once in a while or even added a soundtrack of Yes music in the show's background then it might not get to feel so long winded.

This is a one-off watching experience for me. I mean how many times can you view a long set of interviews?  I haven't seen the performance extras yet.  But I am so glad that I paid only $9.72 for this!

It's great that John Brewer went to such lengths to be as evenhanded as possible in getting perspectives from most of the folks involved in Yes, past and present, but if you have no frame of reference for listening to their reminisces apart from a vague interest in the 60s or 70s, you'd be hard put to be interested in watching.

It's also unfortunate that Trevor Rabin either declined or wasn't asked to be part of this program, apart from one archived video clip of an interview with him. The absence of interviews with  Tony Kaye, Billy Sherwood, Igor Khoroshev and Patrick Moraz  certainly make for big gaps in the narrative of the band's history, but as the guy who (for better or worse) rebooted Yes in the Eighties, the absence of personal reminisces from Rabin fairly glares at you.",1384732800,,967,4.578034682080925

This DVD is probably the best video out on the band's history.  The only other biographies on the band are Yes Years back in 1991 and Yes Speak in 2004.  Yes Years is very professional while Yes Speak lacks in overall production.  Yes Years also is a quite old (Over twenty years ... has it been that long!  However, a collectors item on DVD if you can find it).  Yes: Classic Artists DVD is a deeper insightful look into the band's history with lots of interviews.  This DVD touches on the last album with Jon Anderson (as of this writing) and right before his departure.

Pros:

Interview with the now deceased Peter Banks and his interesting thoughts and stories with Yes.
Interview with Trevor Horn on Drama and the Rabin-era.
Interviews with various people who were involved in the career of Yes.

Cons:

No interview with Tony Kaye, Patrick Moraz and Trevor Rabin.  The only Rabin interview was a clip from a South African documentary on his career.

Overall a decently produced DVD with interesting extras.  Hanging out with Chris Squire while he drives to what appears to be the Trevor Horn Tribute Concert in 2004 is priceless.  Hearing the Union tour debacle by Peter Banks is classic.  This DVD is probably for the hardcore Yes fans.  Yet I'm sure they already heard these stories before and could write a book about it.  But there might be tidbits here and there they never knew.  Anyways, since this DVD Yes has moved on without Jon Anderson and is currently working with their second replacement singer.

Chris Welch is featured quite a lot, and since he's someone who has followed the band since their start, he has a lot to say about them and most of it is interesting.

The second DVD is a mix of interviews, still images, and a few music videos. I haven't watched all of the interviews yet, but what I did see was interesting. The music videos and still images are worth at least one look.

The film does a good job of showing how people who were around the band contributed strongly to Yes' success. You get to hear from a number of insiders who guided the band during its early years, something most films of the band don't have. It becomes clear Yes probably would not have turned out the way it did if it were not for the influence of those who managed them. You also learn about how some of the band's successes almost didn't happen, or happened by accident, and how other things the band planned (sometimes grandiose) turned out differently than they intended.

8221651,5,B000W8OM22,"Really great insights from a lot of different people in the yes-camp.  The interviews with Eddie Offord and Steve Howe were the most insightful for me.  Steve came accross really, really well.  I gained a lot more respect for the man.  Here, he seems like a very humble guy.  I could have watched for another 5 hours.  Great stuff for the die-hard fan.",1295308800,,352,4.507936507936508
8221652,5,B000W8OM22,"Yes is my favorite band and the interviews are so in depth and well done I think I know just about everything now.  Very well put together and well done in terms of quality of product and packaging.  My only regrets are that not all the members are interviewed and I don't know why.
There may be simple reasons why but I would have liked to hear from Tony Kaye or Trevor Rabin for instance.  Also I don't remember Patrick Moraz either since it has been awhile now since I watched the DVD.
The rehearsal footage is ok but the sound is not the greatest but still, I enjoyed it.  Hope they release the Going For The One and Tormato rehearsal footage I have seen on YouTube one day with better quality of image and sound.
The part I really did not like is the photo section which moves so fast you can hardly get a chance to take in the images which are great.  You have to watch them several times or pause them with great precision.

11/22/2013-  I have watched this more times than I can remember its that good.  So glad this was done by Mr Brewer and Mr Welch and I wish I could figure out a way to get them to autograph it for me.  If you are a Yes fan like me this is a must purchase before it goes out of print.",1256428800,,1214,4.046025104602511
8221653,3,B000W8OM22,"Once again, John Brewer (one-time Yes manager) delivers a visually-appalling piece of video production. Remember the barely-watchable Keys to Ascension video massacre of the San Luis Obispo shows from March 1996? Yep, same guy, who has not a clue about putting together an aesthetically-pleasing visual document.

The content here is compelling and keeps one glued to listen to the now-older Yes members and alumni retell much of the history die-hard Yes fans already know, but it's worth the revisit to hear how opinions may have changed and interpretations of events have evolved.

Visually, where can we begin? Each interview looks as though it was shot by a different video crew. Some interviewees are given TV make-up, most are not. Chris Squire is lit flatly, with a plant sitting behind a couch, a Yes shawl draped over the back. Poor Steve Howe is lit as if he's starring in a horror film--hard light screams from behind casting a frightening white silhouette. Alan White is shot in the requisite lobby chair with adjacent table lamp. Rick Wakeman looks as though he was videotaped in the loo with an unnecessary mirror reflection. Bill Bruford's face is cast in harsh shadows, background over-lit, in full focus with a white door grabbing much of the attention. Jon Anderson is also hit with hard light brighter than the sun on Malibu Beach. You get the idea--it's just an amateur production. Oddly, there is a brief segment with Keith Emerson which looks good--probably shot in hi-def 24p with softer lighting.

Some might not care or notice these infractions. But why take the time and effort to make such a thorough document of Yes's history, and not hire a skilled crew to make it look as good as Yes's music sounds? Yesspeak--another document of Yes interviews, is equally, if not more poorly shot than this one.

For a well-produced, visually-pleasing prog rock document, check out ""Prog Rock Britannia-An Observation in Three Movements."" And for Yes, the MTV Rockumentary from 1991 is beautifully-done piece.",1248393600,6,2024,5.032835820895523
