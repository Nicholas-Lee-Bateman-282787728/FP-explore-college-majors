5788934,5,B00DCBKRKW,"I know that some of you, like me, are somewhat influenced by the cover of CDs, DVDs and Blu-rays. It is, at times, a very important first impression. So, when I initially saw the cover of the double feature DVD Bruce Lee  A Warriors Journey & In Pursuit of the Dragon, I didn't think much of it. In fact, my first thought was, Oh, heres another Bruce Lee exploitation DVD of many. But, my God, how wrong I was!  These two films are some of the best visual documents about the life of the most influential martial artist of all time, a must for any Bruce Lee fan! There is stuff in here that you won't find anywhere else.

The first feature that I watched was A Warriors Journey, perhaps the most significant of both films. In it, we learn a little bit more about Lees involvement in what would be his last film, Game of Death, of which he was a producer, writer, choreographer, and author of the screenplay. Bruce first began filming Game of Death, but had to temporarily stop to make his opus Enter the Dragon, which made him a star around the world. Once Dragon was completed, he would resume filming Game of Death on September 20, 1973. However, that was not meant to be, as Lee died on July 20, 1973. The rest is history, as they say, because Game of Dead was completed by using a double, and only the final fight scenes, which were shot before Enter the Dragon, were used with the real Bruce Lee. And here is when director John Little shines, as A Warriors Journey includes additional footage that has never been seen before of that famous last scene.  We are told that 100 min of footage was available (about 2/3 retakes), but only 11 min were used in the film. The rest and unused material is what we enjoy in A Warriors Journey  and how lucky we are! Of course, there are also segments on Bruces auditions, Yip Man & Gung-Fu, Longstreet TV series, Marlowe, as well as interviews with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Linda Lee Caldwell. Taky Kimura, and others. They all discuss aspects of the final fight scene in the Pagoda, including casting, script, fighting techniques in each level of the pagoda, and much more.

The second film, In Pursuit of the Dragon, is another little gem for Bruce Lee fans, and, as it title indicates, it basically tracks down the locations in which Lee made his movies  or whatever is left of them. For this purpose, a crew of six, from Canada, United States, and Germany, led by director John Little, visited sites in which The Big Boss, Fist of Fury, The Way of the Dragon, and Enter the Dragon were filmed. Some of these locations were at Bangkok, Macau, Rome, and Hong Kong. Among the many things that we learn is that the fighting scenes between Bruce and Chuck Norris in Romes Coliseum were done inside a studio. The filmmakers really tried their best in finding these historic places, of which few are still standing.

Bruce Lee  A Warriors Journey & In Pursuit of the Dragon is just amazing to watch and enjoy. It truly adds new information about Bruce Lee short, but legendary life and it is a splendid addition to his legacy and any collection.

5788935,5,B00DCBKRKW,"If you're a die hard Bruce Lee fanatic and you're sick and tired of all the countless Bruce Lee documentaries that contain the same footage, usual interview clips and a bunch of other ""talking heads,"" then ""In Pursuit of the Dragon"" is a film you don't want to miss. It may not have any new or rare visuals of Bruce, but it does contain fascinating content that most fans will find both unique and educational.

The majority of Bruce Lee documentaries are decent, but once you get past the essential ones (""Bruce Lee the Legend,"" ""Death by Misadventure"" and ""A Warrior's Journey"" come to mind), the rest aren't worth your valuable time. Using the recent ""I Am Bruce Lee"" documentary as an example: Do we really care what Mickey Rourke thinks of Bruce's abilities? So Kobe Bryant practices Jeet Kune Do, and? Should we really give a s*** that an electro house musician was influenced by Bruce? Don't get me wrong, these guys are talented, but they don't belong in a Bruce Lee documentary. An interview with Gene LeBell or Danny Inosanto makes total sense, but Al Bundy? Come on. They might as well interview me.

So what makes Little's ""In Pursuit of the Dragon"" so refreshing and different? In a nutshell, Little and a film crew travel to key locations where Bruce Lee's four completed films were shot: Thailand (""The Big Boss""), Macao (""Fist of Fury""), Rome (""Way of the Dragon"") and Hong Kong (""Enter the Dragon""). To a casual Bruce Lee fan, seeing these locations may not seem like a big deal, but to an avid fanatic who has watched Lee's films countless times, it's a wondrous experience.

Using footage from the actual movies to coincide with the ""what the locations look like today"" is simply magical. The outcome is comparable to seeing what The Beatles' Cavern Club looks like today; or even the actual location where John F. Kennedy was assassinated (not to sound crude or anything).

In addition to the then and now-location footage, Little provides interesting insights and commentary (i.e. what goes on in the ""The Big Boss"" mansion today). He even interviews obscure cast members, such as the bank teller and the Italian beauty from ""Way of the Dragon"". The current ""real"" manager of the ice factory - as seen in ""The Big Boss"" - also provides a few anecdotes.

""In Pursuit of the Dragon"" has been available in the UK for a few years, but it was recently released on DVD for the first time in the U.S. It's currently available as a double feature along with Little's other Bruce Lee documentary ""A Warrior's Journey"" (to read a review for this movie, search Amazon.com).

The bottom line: ""In Pursuit of the Dragon"" is a breath of fresh air. It made me want to cash out my savings account, get on a plane and head to Thailand so I can visit The Big Boss' mansion. Definitely recommended!",1384732800,17,2800,4.669371196754564

5788941,5,B00DCBKRKW,"Easily the most novel ducumentaries done on Bruce Lee (only Bruce Lee The Legend compares) and as good as they get. The main attraction is the lead feature ""A Warrior's Journey"" which retrieves the unused footage Lee had left for his Game Of Death as well as script notes so we can finally see what the released version of Game Of Death should have been like! John Little the Bruce Lee historian has done a great job here with more footage than the bonus feature with the Anniversary Edition of Enter The Dragon had on Game Of Death. Hear Bruce Lee's dialogue in extended scenes and in some instances his character's very thoughts ( a film device that current movies should revive) and the fights uncut at last with the adjoining scenes making sense of it all. If Bruce had lived long enough to complete this film it would have outshined all his previous movies! We also get to see others fight as well; most notably Dan Inosanto using Kenpo's ""Dance Of Death"" sequence on one of Bruce's unlucky companions. Truly must have materials for Bruce Lee fans. This feature is then followed by the excellent ""In Pursuit Of The Dragon"" which documents the surviving sites of the location shot scenes from Bruce's martial arts flicks. It's sobering how few of them are left but there's still plenty to see. Clips of Lee's films are compared to said sites, history of the spots given as well as behind the scenes info of the movies themselves are here as well. This is also the work of the aforementioned John Little who has also done several of the best books on Bruce himself, including a companion book to the  feature ""A Warrior's Journey"". Great stuff all around!",1408665600,8,1658,4.620338983050847

8591656,1,B00DCBKRKW,"The disc itself is perfectly fine, not defective. What is defective is the video stream itself. This DVD has horribly interlaced video that's impossible to deinterlace correctly. No hardware player nor software can deinterlace it without leaving a massive amount of blurring, because in fact, the video was improperly put together. THe interlacing is seemingly insanely random. No avisynth script can solve it, either.
Ultimately, this amounts to garbage. Instead of awesome bruce lee footage, you get a blurry mess.",1522972800,,516,5.4625
8591657,5,B00DCBKRKW,This is a MUST buy for those Bruce fans who want to know more about the man and his philosophies. This disc contains almost the entire seq. filmed for Game of Death (approx. 30 mins) that is only represented by a small amount in the finished film itself so there is no need to painfully sit through the actual film to see Bruce in action. It also contains what Bruce had intended the film to be as opposed to what the finally film actually turned out to be; the filmmakers were forced to some extent to take the little footage of Bruce and construct a coherent story. Personally I think they failed and the director achieved far more in ENTER THE DRAGON than he did on GAME OF DEATH. The 2nd doc gives a great tour of the filming sites of Bruces canon of films and how they look today. All in all well worth the purchase.,1506297600,2,821,4.235668789808917
