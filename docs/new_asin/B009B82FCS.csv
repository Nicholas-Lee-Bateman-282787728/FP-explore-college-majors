5312570,5,B009B82FCS,"In a shocking twist, Shiina Mayuri reveals herself to be a Rounder spy is killed by Moeka Kiryu.  Now Rintaro must go through time travel to rescue Moeka but also tries to find out Moeka's true mission.  Rintaro learns from one time leap that SERN has targeted the lab because Rintaro created a time machine and was publicly about to announce it.

Now knowing the truth that his creation has led to a friend's death, will Rintaro be able to prevent Moeka from getting killed?  Find out in the last half of ""Steins;Gate Part 2!

VIDEO:

""Steins;Gate: Part 2 is presented in 1080p High Definition. Although there are major animation studios who do a great job with some TV series, the fact is that they are busy doing several series at a time. But when you have a company who doesn't have so many things going on all at once, sometimes these anime studios put all they have into an anime TV series, making it so well-detailed, that you can't help but be impressed. My belief is that White Fox, the animation studio behind ""Steins;Gate"" put a lot into this series because it looks fantastic.

I love the amount of detail that goes into the character design but also the backgrounds. If anything, the cool look of what video gamers have seen through the ""Steins;Gate"" video games will notice the the high quality production with the TV series.  There are scenes that are intentionally created to look soft, but colors are vibrant at times and if anything, the series looks amazingly robust and well-saturated on Blu-ray!

As for any problematic issues, I did see some banding mainly scenes that focused on Okabe but nothing terrible.

AUDIO:

""Steins;Gate: Part 2 is presented in English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and Japanese Dolby TrueHD 2.0. As one would expect, the dynamic range for the English dub is much better and also noticed a good use of the surround channels for ambiance.  A lot of bird chirping can be heard in this anime series but overall, lossless audio is very good.

""I actually enjoyed the English dub a lot more because of the 5.1 lossless soundtrack but the more in-depth sci-fi writing. But both are well-acted, it's just a slight difference of what was added to the English dub.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Steins;Gate: Part 2 comes with the following special features:

EXTRAS:

JUDGMENT CALL:

More often, you see an anime's brilliance typically when you start off with an anime series.  From the first half of a 24-26 episode series, you know what you are getting.

""Steins;Gate"" is not one of those anime series.  From its first half, you are introduced to characters and their crazy hijinks.  But its when you get to episode 13 all the way to the end, you realize that ""Steins;Gate"" is not only fantastic, but perhaps one of the best anime series that you have seen in a long time.

In fact, I'll even go further and say that ""Steins;Gate"" is the one of the best anime series on Blu-ray for 2012!  That's how much I enjoyed it!

As a big fan of science fiction, storylines of time travel have always been an interest to me. I love shows such as ""Dr. Who"", films such as ""Back to the Future"" and even the alternate time episodes of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"".

So, prior to watching ""Steins;Gate"", what I did know is that it was a popular video game series and the fact that 5pb. and Nitroplus were behind it and that the series had a connection with ""Chaos;Head"", peaked my interest. But when I heard that the anime series was coming out on Blu-ray/DVD, I was excited because I know the series and the games have done well in Japan.

Watching ""Steins;Gate"", at first, I admit I was a bit confused. The protagonist, Rintaro Okabe, was a mad scientist with a maniacal laugh who was working on a time travel experiment. And I guess at first, I wasn't getting into his character all that much. But then when the series started to showcase character development and introduce characters such as Kurisu, Moeka, Ruka, Feris and Suzuha, I started to warm up to the series because a series solely about a mad scientist who is arrogant, was not going to catch my interest.

But then I realized how clever the writing was for the series. How each of these individuals that were introduced, begin to ask for Rintaro to use his invention to help them out. For example, Ruka is a boy who looks so much like a girl and believes that because his mother ate a certain food, he was born a boy instead of a girl. So, he asks for Rintaro to send a message to his mother, to eat a certain food and see if it changes time and Ruka is born as a girl.

But then we are introduced to the problematic situation of changing time. Once you start meddling with time, it can lead to disaster or situations that Rintaro never expected. And the interesting situation is that because he is the only person that can remember a change in timeline and no one else, his ability can also be used improperly if the invention is in the wrong hands. But also, because he is a person that doesn't have much in terms of social skills, no one knows what to expect when he does meddle with time.

In ""Steins;Gate: Part 2, Rintaro, who has made great friends and brought people as lab assistance for his time machine is taken for an amazing emotional ride.  When Mayuri is killed by Suzuha, who reveals herself to be a Rounder, he escapes being killed and tries and tries to save Mayuri's life, but the end result is the same.  She dies.

But as he tries to figure things out himself, he knows he needs to bring in his friends, especially Kurisu, who is just as intelligent and the only person who knows about the hypothesis of time travel, that can help him save Mayuri.

Unfortunately, having used the time machines to change the life of Kurisu (who died in the first episode but manages to thwart her death), for Ruka (making her a girl instead of a boy) and for Feris (saving her father who died in a plane accident as he tried to apologize to his daughter), he learns that by changing time, he unfortunately changes time enough to where Mayuri is dead because of his time machine and people want access to the technology.

But as he changed the lives of the people he cares about, in order to bring Mayuri back-to-life, all things must revert back to the way it was.  But will he make that call?

And just when you think everything is over, a new twist happens at the end of episode 21 (right after the credits), which sets up the final three episodes.

As for the Blu-ray release, we are treated with two audio commentary tracks and as for the series itself, ""Steins;Gate"" looks amazing on Blu-ray, while the lossless soundtrack is clear and features good ambiance.  Especially the voice acting on both the Japanese and the English end, with the English dub getting a thumbs up for writing but the acting is really fantastic for this series.

Overall, ""Steins;Gate"" has turned out to be one of the most fascinating, smart yet fun, science fiction anime series that I have seen in a long while. But after watching ""Steins;Gate: Part Two"" and seeing these final 13 episodes, it left me feeling that I have watched on of the best anime series yet, and possibly as a nod to FUNimation, one of the best written and best acted anime series that they have done so far.

""Steins;Gate"" the overall series... not only is it highly recommended, it is on my list for ""Best Anime Series on Blu-ray for 2012!",1356566400,12,8105,4.626573426573427
5312571,5,B009B82FCS,"Bottom line up front: Steins Gate cracks my personal ""Top 3"" w/ Code Geass and Beck.  Everything from the plot to the animation to the pace of the story was excellent.  Trina Nishimura delivers an epic performance as Kurisu, and J. Michael Tatum delivers yet another stellar presentation as has come to be expected.  Further, if neither Jackie Ross (Mayurii) nor Tyson Rinehart (Daru) fail to win some sort of award for best newcomer (if such things are actually awarded), whoever makes those decisions should be kicked in the head.

Killer voice-acting aside, Steins Gate has one of the best stories I have seen in quite some time.  The science is easily digested (so long as it is taken with the grain of salt intended), the plot-twists are inserted at just the right time, and the balance between funny-and-serious is masterfully executed.  If I may be permitted to draw a comparison to calculus, the first season is like differentiating a function multiple times, each successive time leap peeling away another layer of the function (story) until f'=0.  The second season takes the function and integrates it back to the original, solving for the unknown with each episode by shedding light on the pivotal moments from season one.

After some thought, the story brings to mind the Back to the Future trilogy; hopefully I am not to old to be the only one.  Had the show ended without the final two episodes (23 and 24), I would have been quite content - the last two episodes were the proverbial icing on the cake and made me think of the ending to RahXephon (again, for those who might remember).  I cannot recommend this show enough for both the casual and die-hard anime fan.

ADDENDUM:
Upon writing my initial review, I had not seen episode 25 (because neither FUnimation's website nor iTunes offered it).  After watching, I believe it gives a more concrete ending to things left, at least in my opinion, intentionally ambiguous at the end of the previous episode. Frankly, though, the episode neither adds to, nor detracts from, the overall sense of satisfaction the end of episode 24 brings.",1356307200,2,2100,4.818941504178273
5312572,5,B009B82FCS,"Raw... unpredictable... nerve wracking... twists that makes sense. there were several series that did rewrite everything to restart anew, but this one keeps the continuity amid all the ""resets"", which simply sets this apart. Wonderful plot. 5 stars only because there is no higher!",1356220800,2,281,5.409090909090909
5312573,5,B009B82FCS,"I got really worried after watching the first five eps that it wouldn't live up to the first half of the series.  But then, it got good, and continued all the way through to the end, better and better!  As soon as it started getting better, I told myself I'd be so pissed if they didn't follow through with a great ending.  They did and I was happy.
I'll definitely be watching this one again straight through sometime in the near future.  It was definitely worth the purchase.  Price would be perfect if it was just $10 cheaper.  But for this, I'm happy support them.",1355961600,,568,4.3619047619047615
5312574,5,B009B82FCS,"First off, if you haven't seen the first season, you might not want to read this review (and what are you doing looking at the second season anyway?)

The first season was split into two uneven halves - the first 8 or so episodes were kind of a wacky slice of life sci-fi story. Then the action hit and the stakes were raised. The second season continues the pace of the first season's latter episodes. Okabe scrambles desperately to find a way to return to the original timeline and save Mayuri. As the only person whose memory remains intact during timeline switches, at first he tries to accomplish this alone. But soon he finds himself turning to his friends for help, especially Kurisu.

Steins;Gate was a huge surprise to me. I was enjoying it when all of a sudden, WHAM!!, and I was lovin' it. The science in it is pretty good, a little thin at times, but that is to be expected. Kurisu launches into some fairly technical explanations on occasion, which are really interesting. But as with all truly great shows, it is the characters that make it special. Okabe starts out as just some funny, wacky wanna be scientist/inventor with wild conspiracy theories. But as we learn about his past and why he is the way he is, he is starting to grow and mature.

Steins;Gate is my favorite series of 2011 and one of my favorite anime series of all time. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys an exciting and well woven story. Anyone who enjoys stories that make them think a little. Stories that have wacky characters that you come to love, science fiction, thrill, or mystery. I'd probably recommend this series to just about everybody really :)",1352419200,4,1650,4.5864406779661016
5312575,5,B009B82FCS,"For those who have watched Steins;Gate Season 1 or have already watched the anime before the Funimation release can arguably state that Season 2 of the series is basically what made them addicted to the show.

I highly urge anyone to buy or watch online this anime as it will knock your socks off and explain why it is a top/highly acclaimed anime.

5312577,5,B009B82FCS,"I'm writing this review partly because I LOVE this series. It's my favorite anime. I'm also writing it in order to get the spoiler comment off of the front page.

I can't say too much of the plot of part 2 without spoiling it. Though I can say that it stays consistent with how good the first part is.

The thing about this series is that it doesn't contradict itself. So many sci-fi stories, movies and shows do this, which totally destroys the sense of reality of the piece of work (within it's own universe of course). Kind of breaks the fourth wall, but that doesn't happen here.

The second thing about this series is that the aesthetic qualities of it are just amazing. If you take any episode and just study the camera angles, the different shots and the lighting conditions that they create all through drawings, you will be astounded. This applies to the first part as well. Hell, even the first 2 minutes of the first episode! It's really cool.",1350864000,11,954,4.502890173410405

5312611,5,B009B82FCS,So I just finished Steins Gate series part 2 and I have to say it was a hell of a ride in my last review I said when it picks up it doesn't stop well it doesn't and it finishes on a strong note. The first dvd focuses solely on the cannon and rules of there time travel well this one focuses on the reactions and consequences of doing such things. This part is very powerful and the story is both thought invoking and moving as Rintarou tries valiantly to save his friend Mayuri while being forced to watch repeatedly the consequences of what he has done. The characters are also very great as these episodes show more centered stories on the support cast.

As this is only half of the full series, it is essential to buy and watch the other half as well, and I'm considering the whole 25 episodes together here.

I also went into it being quite skeptical, as I am admittedly a bit of a time-travel stuffy shirt (my favorite genre of fiction). That being said, once I concluded this series, OVA included (OMG an OVA that CONTINUES the story!), it was a no brainer to consider this story as not just one of the greatest Anime plots I have seen, but one of the greatest series in any medium. The take on time travel Steins;Gate uses is from the skew of the more theorhetical as bantered about by mad scientists, sci-fi nerds, and dreamers in basements, libraries, and other socially dark corners, meaning you haven't seen this story before.

You need to.

There isn't really a way to elaborate on the series without spoiling SOMETHING, so I'll simply say that with a total of 24 episodes and 1 OVA between parts 1 and 2, you have 25 QUALITY episodes, every one with a point, every one with a purpose.

5312695,5,B009B82FCS,"I am going to leave this review on part one and part two seeing as part one is lacking in review numbers.

Steins;Gate is an anime series I picked out on a whim to buy. I have seen the name around on anime forums and I even saw it was ranked ""number one"" on the list of top 100 animes. My cup of tea is mecha and romance so this one was a bit out of my reach; however, I saw someone compare it to Serial Experiments Lain which I hold dear to my heart. So I gave it a shot.

I sat down and watched episode one and thought that the animation was beautiful, a true work of art. I however found my self lost, as if I lost all since of self, it has never happened before during anything I have watched... I had to keep watching! Episode after episode passed and by the time I hit episode three Steins;Gate had me in its grasp. I was hooked. Next thing I know, i'm at episode 25 (the OVA) and I am in complete shock that this show has slipped under my radar for so long... It truly is a work of art. The first thing you will hear is, ""Consider, can the universe be justifiably called infinite? Doubtful. It may not have a discernible end, but it had a beginning; and its component parts definitely have a limited cosmological shelf life. Splitting hairs or not; if history tells us anything it's that scientists make very poor poets: we're all just a ship of fools chasing phantoms, heedless of what really underwrites natural law.""

I am in fact a scientist so I can relate to the struggles of the two main characters. It's sad the amount of times we can fail as humans but we keep trying in order to save those that we love. Time is not something we all can bend to our will to gain what we want and if anything this show has taught that we need to love the time we have with those we care for most because everything can change in an instant...

It was sort of like how life is - just going along when all hell can break loose or childhood is fine until you've lived long enough to be a teen and realize that no one is perfect and life can suck and governments and men have some very base sides to them. Adulthood is realizing those things and dealing with them and making choices. Each choice limits future paths and choices.

Seriously, my friend and I cried a lot here. In most anime's I don't feel sad for somebody dying, I just get really mad. However, steins gate actually makes you feel bad for the characters. Really really bad. Steins gate was an excellent series that has quite a few links to quantum mechanics throughout it, had a little but if romance, adventure, action, Scifi & drama.

5312701,5,B009B82FCS,"Starting when the series takes a sharp turn from comedy to the most thrilling ride i've had in a long time, part two of Steins;Gate could not be a better conclusion to the story of The Future Gadget Lab members. There is a more concentrated focus on romance than in part 1 and tragedy makes a clear appearance throughout this release. I have not yet seen the dvd's and i did not care much for the dub, though this should not affect the series as a whole, since i first saw it with original voices and quite the amount of people say the dub is flawless. The art in Steins;Gate is over the top and you won't find a better picture in any other show, buy it, if possible, after part 1, as not doing so would get most first time viewers confused.",1369872000,,741,4.188811188811189
5312722,5,B009B82FCS,"Steins;Gate is a wonderful show. The first half of the show introduces the mechanics of Time Travel, showing the Okabe Rintaro and co. as they slowly peck away at how time travel seems to work. The second half, however, follows them as they encounter the terrible, terrible price that they must pay for their meddling with the flow of time. Brilliant show, do recommend.",1367020800,,370,4.796875
5312723,5,B009B82FCS,"A well put together anime, both parts. The plot is nice and twisty, and it was a lot of fun!",1366416000,,92,3.65
5312724,5,B009B82FCS,"Steins;Gate is based on a Japanese HD visual novel of the same name. I enjoyed the previous work in the series, Chaos;Head, so I grabbed up the Japanese copy on PC and used a fan-made English translation patch to play the game. The first third of the story is akin to an off-kilter comedy, introducing the bizarre main characters and highlighting their (many) eccentricities. The art style and writing were pretty good, so I kept playing. Then everything changed. Suddenly, I wasn't reading a charming sitcom anymore. I was experiencing the greatest time travel thriller ever made. Suddenly, the purpose of the slow opening scenes was clear; I could never have become so attached to the characters and their struggles without enjoying their goofy antics in the first part of the story. I had watched Okabe Rintarou behave like a fool and scramble cluelessly to try and create a time machine; now, I got to see him use it. What made the experience great was that each time Okabe used the time machine, he had to make an important sacrifice, and the game let you, the player, choose which sacrifices he was willing to make, and that determined which ending you saw. Watching Okabe's evolution as a character was the greatest thing about the story, and the adventure was a pleasingly circular experience, both metaphorically and literally (this is, after all, a time travel story).

When I learned that an anime show was being made, I watched it when it first released with Japanese voice actors (which were phenomenal) and English subs. To my great delight, the show captured everything that I felt was great about the visual novel. There is no branching storyline, but the important parts of each story arc are intact and just as beautiful as ever. Already having experienced the game myself, I watched the show with my girlfriend, with a little persuading. She cried at the same two critical moments that inspired me to tears when playing the game, and ultimately she was glad. The show had a different visual style from the painted look of the game, but it was beautiful nonetheless. The conversion of the original story, as I have said, was spot on as well.

Now, my beloved series has become popular enough to see an English-language Blu Ray release. I've heard the work of the new English voice actors, and I feel that what I've heard is spot on for what I imagined the characters would sound like with English voices. Of course, I'll always have a strong affection for the original actors who played these characters, but this English portrayal has taken up the mantle of their original work quite well. I cannot recommend this release too highly: it has both Blu Ray and DVD copies included, and includes both English and Japanese voice tracks (with English subtitles). It's definitely worth watching (triply so if you haven't seen the series before), and thankfully nothing seems to be lost in translation with this dub. By the way, make sure you let the credits run after the first ""ending""...

Addendum: Note that the Limited Edition Part 1 being sold by third-party sellers here on Amazon is not the only version of Steins;Gate Part 1. The producer, FUNIMATION, is still selling the regular edition, whereas I can't seem to find the regular edition of Part 1 on Amazon. You can get Part 2 here though, and hopefully Amazon will make a listing for the original Part 1 as well, so those who only want to watch the show can get it here at the normal price.",1365120000,,3463,4.739635157545606
5312725,5,B009B82FCS,"Steins Gate is hands down my favorite Sci-fi anime, and I would recommend it to anyone. The time travel theory that this show has is very interesting and keeps you thinking until the very end. The show is something you might have to constantly ponder because, it does get a bit confusing at some points. The art is nothing less than fantastic and the music is well implemented. All in all, Steins Gate is a terrific anime and everyone who likes anime should check it out.",1364774400,,471,4.488372093023256

5312730,5,B009B82FCS,"This is one of the most beautiful, mesmerizing and at times heart wrenching stories I have ever watched.  Part 1 moves slow for the first few episodes but don't give up.  The story starts to pick up around disk 2 and it simply pulls you into it.  Word of caution, you have to watch every second of it or you'll be completely lost.  I advise also buying both part 1 and part 2 because part 1 does end on a cliffhanger.  Just so you know there's no fan service, or big breasts or even nudity and the story is better for it.  The best anime I've watched in the last 6 - 12 months.

All and all I highly recommend this to anyone who not just loves anime but also an amazing story.  Simply en-grossing.",1357862400,6,697,4.111111111111111

8539234,5,B009B82FCS,"A lot of the reviews for this series usually go something like ""slow for the first few episodes, then gets really good.""

There is a real reason for that, but only when you are just starting watching for the first time. The first few episodes are essential to how this series grabs on to you and won't let go. Instead of just throwing you into the story, with no real reason for ""the government"" or ""the corporation"" trying to crush everything, you get a window into the main character's lives. No excessive drama, no wild fight scenes, but rent and groceries and reality. At first, you will wonder what the whole thing is even for. THEN, once you know the characters as people, things go sideways, and you are far more drawn into the story because of the backstory.

Very well done. There are scenes that will kick you right in the feels and put you face first on the ground, and it never seems like the story was forced in that direction just for the drama.",1487808000,,959,4.4124293785310735
