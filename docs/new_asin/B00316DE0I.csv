8386691,1,B00316DE0I,"I am thoroughly disappointed with this disc.  I am an Italian teacher who purchased it for possible use in my early level classes.  First, as noted by the previous reviewer, the disc contains only Level 1, not Levels 1 and 2.  I did sit down and watch the whole disc.  The Italian is spoken clearly and slowly.  It is not content for a complete beginner, although someone with a knowledge of another romance language might do all right starting off with it.  This is definitely content to accompany another learning method.

The disc contains only 7 of the 25 lessons it claims to contain, and they are not the lessons listed on the back of the box.  It basically follows a Swiss family as they arrive in the airport in Rome, go through customs, get a taxi to the city for their hotel, check in, unpack, make arrangements to go on an outing, and exchange money at a bank.  (The money exchange was a bit comical, as the man is in search of lire, which have been obsolete for almost a decade.)

The disc does not contain the ""CD ROM Part"" listed on the box, which should contain booklet and Internet links.  Also, the DVDs chapter settings do not correspond exactly with the beginning of each lesson, which is frustrating.

The box also lists:
  * the time of the disc as being 145 minutes.  It was only 45.
  * English subtitles as being available.  They aren't.  And there is no way to turn off the Italian subtitles.  This is particularly troublesome, as the first part of the disc's method is to watch without subtitles and just absorb the ""real life situation.""

In short, if you purchase this disc, you're getting about $6 of the $20 content advertised.  Don't bother.  For now, you can do much better with many other products on the market.  If, however, the manufacturer were to fix the issues and actually sell the product advertised on the box, I would enthusiastically give it another look.",1271116800,8,1899,4.550295857988166
8386692,2,B00316DE0I,"I am not reviewing the content, only the description of the course as a two dvd set of levels 1 and 2.  Amazon is only shipping a single level 1 disc, I have already returned this product as incomplete, yet received the same product again when it re-shipped. Just a warning so you don't go through the same problems I am having.",1270684800,6,328,4.290322580645161
