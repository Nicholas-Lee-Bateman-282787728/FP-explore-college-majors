8386976,5,B0031EUZXO,"Lewis Jewell grew up playing with homemade wooden trucks and toys that run on imagination. He hates modern toys with plastic parts and batteries. So a few years ago when he decided to make his grandson a ricking horse, he wanted it to be perfect - no plastic parts, no skimpy sticks, just a good old-fashion rocking horse that would last a lifetime and more.

 Unable to find a design he liked, Jewell decided to design from scratch. With the help of his son Russell and his wife Phyllis he experimented in his garage workshop until he found a pattern he liked. Others liked it too. So he named it the Family Tradition Pony and put his patterns up for sale. The design is a national favorite.

 While the instructions and patterns are detailed and complete by themselves, Jewell knows that some people, especially beginning woodworkers, may want a little more help, so he prepared this video.

In this video you will visit Lew Jewell's workshop while he:
: Talks about edge to edge joining
: Cuts the saddle (compound bandsaw cut)
: Cuts the wedges (Resaw on the bandsaw)
: Cuts the rockers (Cut a curve with a router)
: Makes the body/Mounts the saddle
: General tips

Complete construction of the rocking horse requires printed patterns and instructions to accompany this video.
