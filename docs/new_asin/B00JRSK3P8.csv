6389439,1,B00JRSK3P8,Oh dear God! I imagine being reincarnated to watch this over and again would indeed be Hell!,1507766400,2,92,4.470588235294118
6389440,2,B00JRSK3P8,One of the worst low budget films i have ever seen.  I'm a huge horror and sword & sandal fan but this movie sucks,1453248000,,114,3.75
6389441,1,B00JRSK3P8,a waist of time,1424649600,,15,3.0
6389442,5,B00JRSK3P8,"awe print! this is olaf ittenbach's take on the making a hell of heaven - a heaven of hell horror from a excalaber meets dawn of the dead(my perspective) and was financed by his fans all over europe(see the credits). this danish print has the original trailer, making of, outtakes, behind the scenes. running at 80 min at pal RC2 which is 4% faster than ntsc. i got mine 30 days before this version came out.

unless you enjoy institutional horror from the likes of craven, cunningham, and possibly zombie(yes, unfortunately he is beginning to cave to the censors a bit, rather than stick to his grindhouse principles for better or worse), get this film!",1412208000,3,654,4.6869565217391305

8653609,1,B00JRSK3P8,I didn't even get 9 minutes into it (including credits) and had to turn it off. I was watching it for free and felt like I paid too much for it. The acting is already so bad and special effects are just horribly appalling. I think I would rather have a triple root canal while rubbing salt and bleach into my eyes than waste my time finishing this movie.,1514419200,,354,4.144927536231884
8653610,1,B00JRSK3P8,I only give it one star so I can post a review.  The plot could have been played out nicely ... but this was filmed simply as a way for someone to display as much gore as they thought they could get away with.  I had it on in the background while I was doing some computer work and had trouble leaving it on for 30 minutes ... and I totally LOVE action and adventure movies.  This is just not worth the time and certainly not the money if you have to pay to rent it ... it was included with my Prime membership.,1514073600,,511,3.894230769230769

8653612,1,B00JRSK3P8,"No real story. There is an attempt at one, but it never actually gels.
This is just a vehicle for gore without reason or rhyme.
Watch it if you must, if you don't have to, then don't.",1511481600,,183,3.972972972972973
8653613,1,B00JRSK3P8,This is a textbook example of how not to make a film.,1510876800,,53,3.5
8653614,4,B00JRSK3P8,"but its got
gore
decapitation
limbs severed
heads exploding
axes and swords in heads
bodies severed
nothing wrong with that for peeps that like GORE
although it could have been polished up a bit more
sound track (music) over whelming to voice ratio
video quality is good
acting well hmmm its a B movie so no not the best but not as bad as some ive seen on amazon OMG just plain awfull but not this one",1509062400,,401,4.220779220779221
8653615,1,B00JRSK3P8,"This was just crap. Somebody thought they had high ideas of what life and death was all about but had no idea how to convey that to film in a way as to be either entertaining or understood. It's convoluted, confusing, slow, really hammy, and well just plain silly. At one point a guy gets shot four or more times and stands there and just stares then yells like an idiot then after a minute or so starts to slowly fall. A girl's brother's head falls off when hit with a small stick. Just pass on this. It is not worth your time.",1508889600,,528,4.135922330097087
8653616,1,B00JRSK3P8,Turned off after 60seconds,1508716800,,26,5.75
8653617,1,B00JRSK3P8,A B movie in every aspect.  It seems like the actors are reading of a script.,1508284800,,77,3.8125
