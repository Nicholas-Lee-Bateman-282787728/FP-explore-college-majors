2895068,1,B000T7XFGU,"This video has very high quality sound and video. The songs are accurate and has very nice one guitar arrangements.
Except that the authors forgot it is supposed to be a learning tool. Instead it is more focused on the instructor's performances which they include and that is great, but I got it to Learn something out of it.  If I wanted to watch Jamie Humpries Jammin these PF songs I would have gotten another DVD....  "" The video has no different camera angles & the instructor goes very fast over the licks and riffs. Also there is NO TAB included. You will have to keep going backwards to catch the licks and riffs....  which is a pain, you are more focused on rewinding than learning the actual thing.... a waste of time and money!

This is a very expensive DVD for what you get. If you are a beginner I suggest you try the HAL LEONARD series, These in fact have very nice camera angles, slow repetition, backing tracks to practice and TAB for a fraction of the Total Accuracy DVD.  I feel robbed at $30 dollars.",1356134400,,1019,4.398936170212766

2895070,5,B000T7XFGU,"Although I am at best a novice electric guitar player, I am finding (still making my way through it) this instructional DVD very exceptional.  Several sections take more work and much repeating, but very possible with practice.  With luck, I will have completed the disc and will be feeling much more comfortable with most of the songs that Jamie Humphries covers.  Highly recommend for anyone that wants to make some effort in learning the songs contained on this DVD and plays guitar at a novice or higher level.",1215561600,7,514,4.818181818181818
2895071,4,B000T7XFGU,"As an intermediate guitar player, I've always found the music books and the on-line video lessons didn't have that personal and hand's on touch that most of us need. With the Learn to Play video, I was able to watch. learn and play at my own speed. The lessons are clear, thorough and very helpful. thanks to the backing tracks included I can jam along and imagine the giant pig flying over my head at a Pink Floyd concert!",1210291200,2,423,4.367088607594937
2895072,2,B000T7XFGU,"I'm an intermediate guitarist and I wanted to actually LEARN how to play David Gilmore's solos.  The guitarist in this video has tremendous skill and plays beautifully, unfortunately he understands nothing of teaching someone how to play guitar.
Jamie whizzes through the lesson, rolling through it as if you already know the material and fingering.  There is little attempt made to stop, take a moment, and really show you what he's doing, rather he rolls through it and you are unable to keep up because you can't watch what he's doing and find your fingering at the same time.
Totally frustrating in my opinion, but most guitar instructional videos are the same way.

If you want to learn how to play Pink Floyd you're going to need the tableature.  If you already know it and want to refine your technique then this is perfect for you.  I have to teach myself everything once again, and THEN go back and improve my technique with this video.

So if you're new to guitar, don't bother, its just too fast.",1201910400,23,1007,4.661016949152542
2895073,4,B000T7XFGU,"I bought this after i bought the Nate Lapointe ""Dark side of the moon"". I like Pink Floyd and I wanted to learn some of the stuff on the guitar. I give Nate's Dvd a 4 also neither came with tabs and neither came with a book. The teaching styles of both guys are pretty good with a slight nod to Nate. He goes slower and it is alot easier for a beginner to keep up with. Be prepared to use the ""rewind"" button on your dvd player alot. But once you get the songs down these are great dvd's. Both of them. All i can say is I want more floyd from either one or both of these guys.",1190332800,12,576,3.808333333333333
8208093,5,B000T7XFGU,Great instructional dvd for Floyd fans. Check out Jamie's EVH video too.,1522195200,,72,5.083333333333333
8208094,5,B000T7XFGU,I am pleased with the help this dvd provided me.,1520553600,,48,3.9
8208095,4,B000T7XFGU,"As a beginner, I knew it would be a challenge to play 'Comfortably Numb'.........a week and a half in, with 4 to 5 hours with the dvd plus practice time, I can play thru the whole piece!  With a little commitment, this dvd is well worth it.  Humphries does a great job breaking down the rhythmic nuances of the runs.  Would've given it 5 stars if tab was included.",1488326400,,364,4.246376811594203
8208096,3,B000T7XFGU,"Jamie is a fabulous guitar player,but the video is paced at a speed much too fast for a beginning player to keep up. These videos would be more helpful if Jamie showed the fingering and positioning of each note or chord very slowly at first. Maybe a guide with the tablature to follow along with would be helpful also. But consider getting your guitar playing skills brushed up a bit before you attempt to purchase this video. Perhaps it is difficult for a great player to slow down enough to benefit the beginner.",1472515200,,514,4.537634408602151
8208097,5,B000T7XFGU,"I'm a huge Gilmour fan, can't get enough.  I've tried other sources for learning some Gilmour sounds but this one works best for me.  I wish I would have had this DVD a long time ago, but I needed to get some lessons from a guitar teacher first anyway so I had some base level of knowledge.  Jamie is very thorough which I appreciate.  He seems very cool and sensible and has a straight forward method.  It is enjoyable to watch him.  I also have his volume 2.  What he teaches sounds ""authentic"" to me.  I've only been playing for 2 years and I am able to learn from him.  Is it easy?  No way.  But if you practice it gets easier.  It takes a lot of practice to be able to do perfect bends and memorize how to play an entire song.  I'm buying more of his DVD's because I enjoy watching them.",1387929600,4,792,4.064935064935065
8208098,2,B000T7XFGU,"no tab! s much to take in for each piece, that's soon too much and you cannot look it up because there's no tab included in the dvd packaging, so even with Jamie Humphries teaching you very capably, this dvd is not much use I'm affraid..Hence only 2 stars!

Ps I also have the Jimi Hendrix-version, same problem, same problem",1383696000,,325,4.416666666666667
8208099,3,B000T7XFGU,I bought this to learn the solo in Comfortably Numb.  Jamie in my opinion could slow down a biy and do a better job walking you through the solo.---What made it worse was there were no Tabs to help out.  Truth is I have better videos on youtube that are better and free.,1370908800,,270,4.0754716981132075
8208100,5,B000T7XFGU,"I personally find Jamie Humphries to be very accurate and he is also an excellent guitar instructor . I truly enjoy working on his material, the sound he uses on this DVD is a little off of Dave Gilmours sound, but his licks certainly are on the mark. The DVD certainly is paying high dividends for me. When i complete this one, i will move on to another one. I will continue to work with Jamies stuff.",1370217600,2,402,4.233766233766234
8208101,4,B000T7XFGU,The products is everything they advertise. It would be make the learning complete if they provided a printed tab or pdf file so we could print out the tabs. It is quite difficult and time consuming to properly write out the tabs using the correct notation.,1363046400,,256,4.586956521739131
8208102,5,B000T7XFGU,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Valentine's day, and he truly loved it. He told me that the instructions are very good, and really helps you to learn how to play Pink Floyd Techniques.",1362268800,,187,4.371428571428571
