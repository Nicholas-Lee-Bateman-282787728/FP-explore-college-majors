6097715,5,B00GP382YC,"I have always loved Del Shores work. When I saw ""Sordid Lives"" the Series and Movie, I saw people who I knew, People I loved, and People who forever imprinted my life. "":Blues for Willadean"" offered that and so much more! Beth Grant captured honestly what ""trailer park life"" can be like for those who have lost hope,forgotten how to dream or never learned how to. The whole cast captured what that shame, fear, violence, alcohol, the moanings of dreams that lay dying around blowing like the trash in the breeze. It shows up close what quiet shriveling up and dyeing looks like! It shows what it looks like for those who refuse to do it. ""Blues for Willadean""  gives a voice to those who do not have one or for those who have not yet discovered theirs. This is not a story about a victim.

It is empowering, It says and shows things that are familiar to so many of us; but those incidents, and histories are NEVER talked about because of the shame even though decades have passed. This movie is not an indictment of Trailer Parks or Trailer Park People. But it shows us a sea of people trapped in personal prisons for various reasons, and many have no idea they are there. Then you see the one lone brave curious person who sits up and looks around and say's to him or her self, ""Why am I so willing to settle for so little?"" Willadean is one of those people that does that and this film will hopefully others to do the same. DO NOT LET THE INEXPENSIVE PRICE FOOL YOU AS TO THE MERIT OF THIS WORK. I am so grateful because the people who need to see this the most can afford it.

6097716,5,B00GP382YC,"I first found Del Shore's work many years ago when the funky-funny cover art of the Sordid Lives DVD caught my attention from the shelves at BlockBuster. Since then Mr Shores' movies have become an often-repeated guilty pleasure for me. I'll compare that affection to a fresh box of ""banana-flips."" I love to hate 'em and I hate to love 'em... but either way, love is at the bottom of it all. Mr. Shore's stories are all like that. It's always a blurry line between love and hate for both the characters and the viewing audience. Fierce and funny moments alternately compete for control of your emotions.

So Blues for Willadean appeared for sale on Amazon. Of course I had to add it to the collection. I'd read what I could find about the play that was the basis for the film. When the DVD arrived, I let it sit for a couple of weeks. I don't really know why. I guess I was afraid it would be a ""downer"" and I was reluctant to see the famous Shores-irreverent-humor get drowned in an angry, over-wrought, morality drama.

So when I finally pressed the play button, I watched with suspicion. Honestly, it took me a few minutes to warm up, but before long I was lost in the story. By the end, I was ready to watch it again; sort of like the urge to jump right back on a roller coaster that just tore your stomach out.

Initially, the visual style of the film bugged me. The scenes of the club singer were dreamy-rich, warm and smooth-looking. The jump to the trailer-house scenes looked harsh and grainy on my big-screen. It quickly dawned on me that there might be something serious going on here. Intentional? Is it an artsy-fartsy visual reference to the grit of reality tempered by determined hope and force of will. I'll say yes. It works that way at least. This movie feels like a stage-play and the very few scene changes, carry a notable part of the story. So, the message of this movie gets delivered from several directions, but without getting heavy-handed about it.

Yes- this movie has message and layers. I think Mr. Shores' stories always do work on various levels, but this one will really mess with your head. More than once, I changed my mind as to which character I loved and which I needed to hate. More than any other of Mr. Shores' stories, this one reflects ""real"" life. Sure, the laughs are genuine and there are more than just a few, but the pain is palpable and sometimes is a little hard to watch.  But over-all this DVD is worth every minute of your time and every cent of the extremely affordable price! Buy it Wardell, buy it now!",1393027200,5,2559,4.447761194029851
6097717,5,B00GP382YC,Del Shore wrote a powerful and much needed play that is now a movie that is tinged with humor but convey a much more powerful message that needs to be told.  The acting in this movie was magical as each played the part so well that you believed the storey was actually happening and you wanted to intervene.,1392768000,4,307,4.293103448275862
6097718,5,B00GP382YC,"This is an awesome movie because it's realistic and touches home in many ways. It will have you on an emotional roller coaster and laughing yourself into tears as well, but more on the serious side of things... There are a few things that relate to Sordid Lives, but this, as noted, is not your typical Sordid Lives. David Steen will have you on the edge of your seat. He plays his part (J.D.) very well, and aggressive to keep it real. Along with the rest of the cast. Great job to EVERYONE who put this together. A must-have for your DVD collection! If you or anyone you know feels trapped in an abusive relationship, there is help. [...] don't stay trapped.",1392768000,6,660,4.418032786885246
6097719,5,B00GP382YC,"As others have noted, this is not ""Sordid Lives"".  While you will find humor in this movie it had to be an emotional rollercoaster to write and film.  Be prepared to have some tissues on hand for the rough, realistic, and frightening aspects of this story.  The acting in this tale is flawless and the story is timeless.  Definitely not for young kids to watch but it will leave most adults thinking about it for a good while after.  I felt so much better after seeing an interview with the evil husband and realizing, ""This is just a film.  He really isn't that person.""",1392681600,6,571,4.4423076923076925
6097720,5,B00GP382YC,"I remember when I saw the play in LA how moved I was by the performances of this brilliant cast.  Well, the movie is just as powerful, just as brilliant and moves me beyond words.  I'm glad this movie was made and I hope everyone has a chance to see it.  And come on, it stars Beth Grant who, in my opinion, is one of the best actresses out there!",1392681600,6,347,3.9285714285714284
6097721,5,B00GP382YC,"My husband and I enjoyed seeing the original stage show that this film is based on a few years back in Los Angeles.  Originally titled ""The Trials and Tribulations of a Trailer Trash Housewife,"" this little slice of southern Americana combines the disparate elements of ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" with ""The Burning Bed"" to great effect. Director Shores proves that he can direct talent, although the cast he was working with on this film may have needed little more than a call to ""Action"" for the drama to unfold. Film has since screened in a few festivals, which is how we got a press / loaner DVD advanced screener. Needless to say, we're ordering a final copy from Amazon at this great pricing now on preorders!",1391040000,4,711,4.688
6097722,5,B00GP382YC,"This movie is a ""MUST SEE"".  All the actors in it deserve an Oscar for their performances.  It's a heavy movie with violence but in between are hysterical funny scenes.  I've met David Steen several times, a really nice guy!  But after I saw this movie it took me a while to even look at him again.  His portrayal of JD is amazing!  JD's an #sshole, wife abusing SOB!  Beth Grant plays Willadean, the wife of JD who just wants to make her husband happy.  Octavia Spencer plays is the next door neighbor who's seen it all before and knows how this will end, not pretty.  Dale Dickey character is kind of a lost sole, moving from town to town trying to find herself, wanting to put down roots but messes it up every time.  At the end all three women try to band together to stand up to JD.  Like a Del Shores movies, the victim rises!",1390262400,12,832,4.2025316455696204
6097723,5,B00GP382YC,"This is a moving, touching, scary, funny and all-around great movie that tugs at your emotions from the writer/director of Sordid Lives, Del Shores. This is NOT Sordid Lives and does not try to be. There are funny moments as only Del Shores can intertwine needed comedy relief into a very dark and, often, hidden subject: Spousal Abuse. Beth Grant is stupendous as the abused wife of a blue collar worker-husband played ruthlessly and brilliantly by David Steen. He is whoring all around with the likes of a barmaid and neighbor played by one of my favorites, Dale Dickey. Willadean is helped by her other neighbor LaSonia played with compassion, love and a bit of comedy by Oscar winner, Octavia Spencer. And, how can there be a review of this movie without the beautiful songs sung by that incredibly talented, Debby Holiday. Her beautiful singing brings more emotions to the movie and poignant melody to the story. The movie will make you cry, it will make you laugh, it will make you gasp, but it will hold you until that moment that you need to look for when Willadean knows things have changed. Beth Grant's moment in the movie. I highly recommend this film. It addresses a problem in this country that we refuse to acknowledge, especially how brutal it can be. Many were disappointed that it wasn't another Sordid Lives. I was glad to see the range of writing and directing of Del Shores. It is a must see! I am pre-ordering this movie on Amazon for it's release this month.",1389484800,18,1481,4.656488549618321

6097726,5,B00GP382YC,"What an amazing movie. One that will stay with you long after youve watched it. It truly touched me and affected me. Is it easy to watch? NO. Its incredibly difficult infact. But well worth the time. Its upsetting, uplifting, and heart touching. The performances are amazing...simply amazing. Dale Dickey, a local hometown girl, is a revelation. Beth Grant has never been better....I would put her performance in this up against any Streep performance...dont believe me, give it a watch and you will.",1405814400,,500,5.036144578313253
6097727,4,B00GP382YC,"Having seen this onstage in L.A. at the Zephyr Theatre, I was really looking forward to the filmed adaptation of the play.  While the acting is solid, it does seem to suffer a bit in the transition.  First of all, it was ill advised to use the segments with Debby Holiday popping in to belt out her soulful songs.  These worked in the play, and she IS a wonderful singer, but here the performances are just jarring, like something tacked on.  The tone of the movie really suffers from these intrusive sequences, and I would really give it only about 3 1/2 stars if that was an option.

The second problem I see with the film is that the director seemed to be searching for the tone.  Beth Grant's portrayal of her character suffers a bit from this.  The subject matter is quite serious, and I had a hard time buying into her character's overused device of saying, ""I will not disappear!""  It somehow just didn't fit here as well as in the play.  Too bad, because Grant is a powerhouse actress, and she killed it in every single scene onstage.  The inclusion of Octavia Spencer was one of the reasons Grant's performance doesn't veer into the territory of caricature.  As someone else noted on here, she grounds every scene she's in. Still, it is a quite enjoyable movie.",1405123200,,1270,4.502183406113537
6097728,5,B00GP382YC,"This is an important film! All of the actors give OSCAR worthy performances. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!! Very dark subject matter, but Del Shores will always work humor into it somehow!",1403136000,,181,5.275862068965517
6097729,5,B00GP382YC,"I was expecting something similar to Sordid lives, it is not.  But you will not be disappointed.  Del Shores has outdone himself on this one.  The story, cast, setting are all perfect to get this story across.",1397520000,,209,4.594594594594595
6097730,5,B00GP382YC,"The performances of each actor were as powerful as the message of the movies subject line. The movie brings to front the hush and hidden denials of many relationships. It causes the viewer to question their own responsibility for friends or relatives, who they suspect may be in relationships that are abusive. It is a must see for everyone. Because everyone in someway will see their own reflection, some which they may wish not to acknowledge.",1397347200,,445,4.868421052631579
6097731,5,B00GP382YC,"OMG, this movie was wonderful and sad. i can relate to what Willadean went through and good for her for how she showed her husband that she will no longer be his punching bag.

6097737,5,B00GP382YC,"You know, I thought it might be pretty difficult for Del Shores to top SORDID LIVES.  I see I was wrong.  What a powerful movie portrayed by several grossly overlooked actors/actresses.  First, Beth Grant, the lovable Aunt Sissy from Sordid Lives, gives a riveting performance as Willadean Winkler.  Dale Dickey beautifully portrays the ""tramp with a heart,"" Rayleen.  (And, by the way, Dale is the actress I think I'd most like to hang out with!  I know she'd be a riot because you just can't pull a character like Rayleen out of thin air!)  And, how can I not mention David Steen, who plays the despicable, J D Winkler.  Shores brings these characters to life in ways you immediately identify with.  Being a child of the deep south, I totally get where Shores is coming from and easily felt the silent rage and destitution of poor Willadean.  Sordid Lives was comedic, all about laughter and fun and looking at life from the happy side.  Blues for Willadean is somewhere between a drama and a tragedy, about overcoming unspeakable odds and meanness.  It's about hope and survival.  When I told Del (via email) I was looking forward to seeing Beth Grant again, his reply was, ""Well, this is a side of Beth I'll bet you've never seen before.""  Man, was he right.  This movie shows a depth in all three actors/actresses [mentioned above], that I suspect many have never seen before.  Outstanding movie!  And, best of all, filmed entirely in my home state of Georgia!  The movie is very powerful and at times very intense, but wonderfully profound.",1395014400,2,1546,4.726591760299626

6097739,5,B00GP382YC,"This is one of the best films I have seen in a while. There were two reasons I bought this video, Beth Grant is in it and Del SHores wrote it. That's always enough for me. This film will grab you. Beth's performance, along with the entire cast is Oscar worthy. Beth Grant is one of our most talented character actors and in this film she sure doesn't disappoint. The main topic of the film is one that isn't talked about much but needs to be seen by all! If you have or know someone that has been in an abusive relationship, this film is a definite must see. 5 stars isn't a high enough rating for Blues for Willadean. Get your copy today! I bought three. One for me and the others for presents.",1394668800,2,695,4.155555555555556
6097740,5,B00GP382YC,"I saw this film at the Dallas Film Festival and, when the DVD came out, I had to own a copy. It is an adaptation of Del Shores' play, Trials and Tribulations of a Trailer Trash Housewife. As in the original stage version, whose cast appears in the film, it is somewhat darker than Shores' previous works because it deals with domestic abuse in all it's horribleness, but there are also some very funny moments. The acting is superb all around and the music by Joe Patrick Ward and the singing of Debby Holiday are worth the price all by themselves. It is violent and gritty with some salty language. I wouldn't recommend it for children, but would definitely recommend it for adults.",1394496000,,683,4.560975609756097
6097741,5,B00GP382YC,"Del Shores delivers another masterpiece movie. This story comes from his play 'Trials and Tribulations of a Trailer Trash Housewife'. This story had to be told. So many women and men out there go through this abuse everyday. But there is hope. If you have never seen any of Dels work, check out his other projects. He is amazing!!! And such a great person.",1394496000,2,356,4.578125
6097742,5,B00GP382YC,"Why do we hurt each other? This is a story of a woman who tries to break free from abuse. She struggles to maintain a sense of self, when everything but her ability to breath is taken away. It surprises me that we haven't heard more about this movie. Huge talent was involved in making it. I could feel the commitment the actors made to this movie and telling the story. Beth Grant became Willadean.
Anyone who is interested in exploring the complexities of human relationships should watch it. Anyone who has lived with abuse or worked with people who are abused would recognize this story. Anyone who has struggled to maintain their humanity will see their struggle played out here through Willadean. I can see it as a conversation starter  to help people understand spousal abuse.
Blues for Willadean is more than that. The story stands by itself, tragic and tender. I felt enriched by getting to know Willadean.",1394150400,2,915,4.71875

Grant plays an abused housewife that refuses to give up. With the support of her neighbor (Spencer) she begins to step out and do more, like find a job against the wishes of her abusive cheating husband. Grant also finds support from an unlikely source in a trashy new neighbor (Dickey) whom has a few secrets of her own.
