It seems they get into one difficulty after another, but make new friends along the way. I enjoyed this movie & it would be good one to watch with elementary & middle school kids.",1514764800,,350,4.014285714285714

6881824,5,B00QU8E3WM,"Gotta admit it. Anne Heche has gotten a bad rap/rep for reasons I won't get into.
Regardless, she is a single mom in this with a night of chaos on Christmas Eve.
She plays a loving-mother that SHOULD have kept better reins on her kids... and
a sled left on her sidewalk. ~ Maybe that lovable puppy was actually a demon! ~
If you are one of those ""nervous"" people you MIGHT be like the ONE reviewer,
here, that hated it. One other reviewer thought this was ""Okay!""
The rest of use loved it BECAUSE it was the most disastrous evening even you
can possible dream. Indeed, maybe NIGHTMARE is a better word.
Amazing entertainment: several injuries, but NO deaths!",1512345600,4,658,4.491666666666666

6881828,2,B00QU8E3WM,"I've been watching this movie for ""forever,"" so when Amazon offered it for $6.99 (or thereabouts) instead of the Hallmark price of $20+/-, I was thrilled.  I was so excited to watch it.  But it was a serious disappointment.  The puppy was adorable.  The characters that were thrown together for this Christmas Eve were interesting but not terribly believable.  And the string of crises they encountered were over the top--who slipped and fell on a kid's sled and broke an ankle; who broke an arm falling through a hole in a construction site; who got robbed at gunpoint; whose vehicle first died, and then fell through an ice-covered pond to its demise; who narrowly escaped a fire (caused by a puppy); who suffered the effects of smoke inhalation....  I could go on and on, but I won't.  A crisis or two keeps one on the edge of her seat, but sitting on the edge for too long, gives one a butt ache!  The ending where the whole gang exchanges gifts of the heart and has a communal meal together is nice, but not nice enough to make me watch the whole thing over again.  Wearying.",1511913600,5,1080,4.4974358974358974

6881853,4,B00QU8E3WM,"The first time I watched this movie it gave me a ""nervous condition""  because there was so much commotion and couldn't believe that they didn't make getting a collar/harness and leash a priority!  Then I watched it several more times and gradually liked it more.  Part of the reason is in the attached photo.  This was our Abbey, a beautiful young Beagle, less than a year old, that my husband (a police officer) found in the woods in 2006 while working a detail.  We lost her to kidney disease in November 2014 and I'm not over it.  I can only imagine this is exactly what she looked like as a puppy.

Anyway, this is now one of my favorite Christmas movies and it has a very nice ending!  It makes me smile and cry at the same time!",1468368000,13,734,4.268115942028985

6881882,5,B00QU8E3WM,"A perfectly delightful spin on the holidays.  A divorced mother of two attempts to create a magical old-fashioned Christmas, but of course, the kiddos like most kids of this x generation want the latest gadgets and are angry because their oft absentee father is once again MIA.  Through a series of parallel events, a recently laid off mall worker leaves a lost dog on the woman's doorstep.  From there, mayhem and fun ensue as the said man slips on the ice and breaks his arm (kismet perhaps) and the woman and her children drive him to the ER.  From there and onward, many other individuals emerge on the scene and connect... well because of one extremely mischievous puppy.  Each of them discovering that unexpected chaos can lead to some indelible memories and lasting bonds.

One of the best Christmas films ever and certainly one of Hallmark's best.  Also, wonderful because it emphasizes families extend far beyond bloodlines.  Do yourself a favor and purchase this yuletide gift, pop it in to the DVD, and celebrate the best in each of us: as Scrooge observed ""his business was mankind.""

A truly uplifting feel-good gem with tremendous heart!",1431043200,20,1151,4.861538461538461
