8360189,5,B002ARVI4S,"I love Herbie Hancock! This concert is called ""One Night in Japan"", but can be also called ""The New Standard(s) Live"".
It was filmed in the summer of 1996 at the Lake Stella Theater in
Kawaguchi, Japan.
The interpretation of new music/standards is outstanding!

But the moment belongs to Herbie and this collection of All-Star musicians who recorded the original CD--""The New Standard""-- and are now performing with him on this DVD.
Do yourself a favor, buy this one and enjoy.",1318809600,,335,5.203703703703703
8360191,5,B002ARVI4S,"When Mr. Herbie Hancock body of his work missles to best seller status for a significant stretch. I just hope fans understand his countless grammies, oscars, and music awards pale in comparison to the enormous gift of music he's provided over six decades. This man has been the corner stone of so many giants across music genres; the ultimate studio musician, leader, teacher, and human being. I don't know this man personally, but through his celebrity and music. And I must take liberty to say this DVD is arguable the best recording of a jazz concert. The late Michael Brecker is superb; John Scofield on guitar is stellar; Dave Holland is sooo wonderful on bass, Don Alias is the best keeper of time and percussive colors, and Jack Dejohnette is a phenom of epic time keeping proportion without peer. Blooms on an evergreen. Buy this one, quick, and appreciate these living legends, especially Mr. Hancock, while you can.
