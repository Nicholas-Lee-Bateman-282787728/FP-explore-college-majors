8709596,3,B00V8945F8,"Five stars (maybe more) for the singing and conducting...this is, without question, the finest performance of GUILLAUME TELL I've ever heard in my life...but minus four stars for the production, which features shabby costumes, idiotic staging (WHY on earth are two women writhing around the floor during the playing of the overture, and why did the director toss in images from Eisenstein's classical silent film BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN during the final scene?), and a shoot-the-apple-off-Jemmy's-head scene that positions the luckless youth behind a toilet bowl seat with his/her head positioned between two rolls of toilet paper! In addition, the director seems addicted to bringing chairs onto the stage (not nice, solid, wooden chairs, mind you, but those cheap white plastic stackable things that you see in the back of high school gyms), taking them off, then bringing them back again. What the hell is it with those chairs???

But as I say - the singing is fantastic from top to bottom, with the three principals (Howarth, Spyres and Foster-Williams) in superb form. The acting is good, and at least tries to overcome the moronic staging, but it never quite succeeds. (I also got a laugh out of the ""revolutionaries"" going off to fight the Hapsburg oppressors in the last act...bearing such weapons as shepherds' crooks and scythes, which would have been appropriate to that time and place, but also modern-day rifles and hockey sticks!!)

Well, who knows? Maybe the ghost of Herve Villechaize returned to help with the direction, and he kept yelling at the director every two scenes, ""De chairs, boss...de chairs!""",1440979200,7,1618,5.17175572519084
8709597,5,B00V8945F8,"This video of a production from the Wildbad festival in July 2013 and competes videos from the recent Pesaro Festival and from the veteran 1981 La Scala production.
I decided to buy this after hearing the new Pesaro production on Decca, which I found unsatisfying despite some attractive features. More about that later.

The Wildbad production is from a smaller festival with a smaller budget and stage, but the opera is set in a small, poor Swiss village several hundred years ago and the scale here works well. Rossini wrote this as a Grand Opera for Paris, but it focuses on a small group of people and their relationships, plus some wonderful music.
The opening section of the overture is played as a private concert for Gesler and Mathilde on stage, followed by some silent pantomime to the rest if the overture, which fills in some gaps in the libretto. The orchestra is well recorded as set in the space of the theatre, which is not as detailed as the Decca multi-miked blu-ray sound but matches the sound of the scale of this production, an excellent clear stereo sound that contains within it plenty of ambient information. If you have a 5.1 sound system, your amplifier already has a good 5.1 decoder that can process this stereo signal and often provides a more realistic result than a 5.1 soundtrack. The basic stereo signal is excellent on its own.

Hearing the voices singing together in the space adds significantly to the experience. While I might not hear every last detail as clearly, after a few minutes I get the feeling of being at the opera and am able to relax and engage more fully.

Because body mics are not used as far as I can tell, we get to hear the voices in the space, and we actually get to hear them singing together! The Decca video relies on body mics (partly because Florez' voice is rather lean) which leaves the impression that the singers are in different spaces. Body mics pick up the voice from inches away, a big voice needs a resonant space to blossom and combine with others.

And Michael Spyres has a great voice, a lyric heroic tenor that is better suited to this role than is Florez', and he can ACT!
There's also the matter of acting - these singers are fully involved in their roles and interact with each other, which really involves the audience (us) and that's vital especially in a long opera. They were able to hold my attention for much longer than did the Decca - and since we're at home we have the luxury of breaks at will.

The ballet sections seemed shorter because they were done so well, supporting the plot and including some folk dances, plus schuhplattler and a Iittle interpretive dancing. It is Rossini's music and adds to the show when well done.
I hated the ""ballets"" on the Pesaro disc. Inappropriate, immature and brutal.
The level of singing on this production was surprisingly high, but Wildbad is in the center of the Stuttgart/Strasbourg/Zurich/Freiburg area, and tucked away in the Black Forest.

I watched and thought about this for several weeks after buying it - because I find that Amazon's crony reviewers are just feeding their greed in their panic to publish - and found that this Wildbad with Spyres was the most satisfying production, with the highest levels of singing, acting and playing and presented that was presented with dramatic integrity.

I found that the Decca/Florez might be more theoretically ""perfect"" but it didn't hold my attention intellectually and emotionally and tell the human story in depth, and that was Rossini's real goal.",1438560000,8,3535,4.728896103896104
8709598,3,B00V8945F8,"The costumes look like they were picked at random off the rack of a Goodwill store. Four hours is a long time to gaze at people who don't seem to know how to dress. The ballet scenes are gruesome. Remember when Walt Disney choreographed the Dance of the Hours from La gioconda with dancing hippos? Only that thought gave me pleasure as the sadly clad athletes went hopping up and down, sprinting back and forth etc.
The caliber of singing starts out very high. Spyres impresses at the beginning, and Howarth initially reminds one of Montserrat Caballe, and there are not many sopranos about whom such a thing could be said. The singing fails to soar over the long four hours of the opera, however; no doubt the singers lost heart in view of their surroundings. On the blu-ray release that came out simultaneously (filmed the same year) the production values improve as the evening goes on, and the singing ascends with the surroundings. The blu-ray also has state-of-the-art surround sound, whereas this DVD has only stereo PCM. The DVD was the first recording of the opera to follow the critical edition of 1992, but the blu-ray was filmed only a few months later and the timing there is actually few minutes longer.
The booklet summarizes the approach of the production: ""Tell ... may be a great man, but a complex one, and he is not so very likable."" Schiller and Rossini would have said, ""Tell may not always be likable, but he is a truly great man."" For that approach, check out the blu-ray with Florez, who does himself proud.",1432080000,10,1532,4.656826568265683
