5092920,5,B007KAQULG,I think this was absolutely amazing!!!! It was one of the best if not the best idem that I have bought.,1344297600,3,103,3.9523809523809526
5092921,5,B007KAQULG,"At first I wasn't too sure if I was going to like this K-Drama but then I heard Jung Yong Hwa (leader of K-Pop Group CN Blue) sing and that was it.  This show really picked up and was hilarious.  Loved the relationship between Lee Shin and Lee Gyu Won.

Lee Shin is a popular university student majoring in Western Music.  All the girls adore him because he is the vocalist and guitarist of the band ""The Stupid."" Shin is known for his good looks, cocky personality, and strong passion for music. Everyone around him knows him for his cold-hearted and distant personality, but deep down he has a soft side hidden away. He lacks interest in anything unrelated to music and has neither dreams nor plans for the future. At first he is smitten with a dance professor at the university, but this all changes when he meets Lee Gyu Won, a bright, clumsy, outgoing student from a prestigious family.  She is majoring in Traditional Korean Music and her instrument is the gayageum. Gyu Won's grandfather, Lee Dong Gun, is one of the top 3 traditional musicians of his age and his biggest wish is to see his granddaughter become a traditional music prodigy. While trying to live up to her grandfather's expectations, Gyu Won is so involved in trying to please her grandfather, her life as a university student is boring.  She knows nothing much outside of her studies. As her friends are fans of ""The Stupid"", she is forced to go to the band's concert with them. There she sees Lee Shin performing live, and is immediately captivated by him.  However, the two clash and it's an all out war when Lee Gyu-Won challenges Lee Shin to a music duel (Korean Traditional Music to Western Music).

I have watched this K-Drama twice and it gets even better.  The first time I was paying more attention to the subtitles to truly enjoy it.  Second time I watched it, my attention was more on the actors.  The interactions between the characters are hilarious.  Gyu Won is perfect because she is so clumsy and everything embarrassing seems to happen to her while Lee Shin is cold, always dressed in the latest fashions, and the persona of cool.  The two play off of each other perfectly.  Definitely one of my favorite K-Dramas!!!  And like I mentioned at the beginning the music is great!!!  Love Jung Yong Hwa's voice.  :)",1341014400,22,2301,4.6004901960784315
5092922,5,B007KAQULG,"i love this drama it can make you cry or make you feel in love!!! i love this actress and this actor they are incredible, this drama it's really great",1335830400,3,150,4.033333333333333
5092923,5,B007KAQULG,"I loved this drama. The description explains it fairly well. I bought the DVD after some research (I once unknowingly bought a bootleg copy of ""My Girlfriend is a Gumiho"" and ended up paying extra so I could get a legal copy later). YA Entertainment (which releases Region 1 South Korean DVDs) will not be releasing this drama. So, the DVD I received was from PMP Entertainment (out of Malaysia). The subs were good and understandable. The words were a bit fuzzy, though. Not very HD quality. The DVDs came in sleeves inside the hard-case. I prefer when the DVDs snap into the case itself. However, this was a good deal and well worth the price.",1335484800,24,645,4.568965517241379
5092924,5,B007KAQULG,"I am becoming or maybe already am enraptured with Korean drama. I never intended to purchase the series, but every one I see, I just love. The ones that have music are becoming really just great to me. No, I don't speak Korean, but their talent speaks in every language. They put so much into doing a drama it is hard to explain. Watching outtakes which they include in almost every series, gives insight into just what they experience. It is unbelievable filming in sub zero weather in water scenes as they did in Boys Over Flowers. I can't imagine, but one can see how cold it is in many of the series as you can see their breath. In Dream High, they make jokes about no heat. In Dream High Too, they make one scene where the one office is heated and the rest of the sets are freezing. I bought Hearstrings as I liked the cast. It did not let me down. Again, the story was so original. I am considering the sound track from this one too if most of the music is recorded. If you like to laugh, cry, fall in love, feel passion, joy, sadness, and can't always figure out the ending, give Korean drama a try...then the music.",1334880000,35,1123,4.252336448598131
5092925,5,B007KAQULG,Loved it loved it loved it.... Sweet and fun and the music top rate wonderful. The band is real. sing their own songs... they mix traditional Korean music with the rock... we loved that too. Some breaking up is hard to do. Some adult situations... Beautiful people. Its a keeper for all of us.,1447718400,,293,4.444444444444445

5092931,5,B007KAQULG,It is a great story. Love it!,1434412800,,29,3.2857142857142856
5092932,5,B007KAQULG,"This drama is definitely one of the cutest dramas I have seen. It focuses on the love between two university students majoring in traditional (Lee kyu won) and western music (Lee shin). This drama has all the humor, cuteness and actor chemistry you look for in a really good drama. Also, the music is great! It features not one, but two, CNblue members, the lead vocalist and drummer. If you are unaware, CNblue is a Korean band that Lee shin / yong hwa leads. This drama features his music and vocals in both fast and slow paced songs. But going back to the drama. This drama is full of great music, actors, and a really good story line. This drama touches the heart and you will definitely have ""fallen for it"" haha (joke because it is one of the songs from the drama) but I would recommend this drama to anyone, and I apologize for not going to in depth of the plot I DIDNT WANT TO SPOIL IT! Its too good to spoil, you just have to watch it yourself!  I have bought the dvd from a different source, but if I
hadn't I would have bought this in a heartbeat!

P.S
If you are already familiar with the kdrama world, you may have realised this is a drama with go mi nam and kanf shin woo from ""Youre Beautiful!"" He finally gets the girl!

Drama you may like if you enjoyed this one:
Boys over flowers
Playful kiss
Dream high
Flower boy next door
Pinocchio
Shining inheritance
The inheritors

And also check out CNblue if you ove korean music!",1434240000,,1440,4.302583025830258
5092933,4,B007KAQULG,"""Heartstrings"" is an engaging Korean TV drama series with a terrific soundtrack notably the hit songs ""Because I Miss You"" and ""You've Fallen For Me"".  Starring Jung Yong Hwa, leader of the K-Pop male rock group CNBLUE, and Park Shin Hye, who excels in the role of the spirited ingnue taking on life challenges.  Kang Min Hyuk drummer of CNBLUE, plays the goofy, lovelorn drummer of ""The Stupid.""  Excellent supporting cast.

Yong Hwa plays Lee Shin, the campus idol whose rock band, ""The Stupid,"" has a huge following on campus.  Shin Hye is cast as Lee Gyu Won, the leader of an all-girl music group that plays traditional Korean music instruments.  The two bands duke it out in a fun, frenetic battle of the bands.  Add a love triangle between the students' college professors, an obsessive stage mother, the mysterious secret of Lee Shin's mother and Lee Gyu Won's crotchety grandfather and you have a fun, 15-episode TV series that hits all the right notes for an excellent coming-of-age romantic comedy.  K-Dramas have gained global popularity in recent years: ""Heartstrings"" shows you why.  Must See!",1428883200,,1107,4.940540540540541
5092934,5,B007KAQULG,"One of the best drams I've ever watched. Not like the crap produced in the US these days.  Portrayal of young people who respect there elders, very little use of bad language, no adultery, lust ....etc.",1428537600,,202,4.611111111111111
5092935,5,B007KAQULG,One of my favorites. now I can watch it anytime.,1426032000,,48,3.9

5092940,4,B007KAQULG,loved the story when I saw it online.  the dvd did not disappoint. English subtitles were good.,1407715200,,95,4.588235294117647
5092941,5,B007KAQULG,Loved this drama.  The subtitles were good too.,1405728000,,47,4.875
5092942,5,B007KAQULG,"As far as Korean Dramas go, this one is awesome.  With a musically talented cast, good songs, and an interesting story, I was hooked from the beginning.  The chemistry between Park Shin Hye and Jung Yong Hwa is amazing, which might be expected because they've collaborated before.  The grandpa is absolutely hilarious.  It's the music that really gets to you though.  You can't help but be impressed with the talent the actors possess and want to sing along.  It's a feel good sort of drama that makes me smile every time I've watched it which has been quite a few times at present.

While I have the Malaysian copy from PMP Entertainment, it is still good.  There are some small problems with the subtitles as can be expected with a lot of imported things and one episode doesn't sync very well with the sound for about half an episode (there's a lag between when people open their mouths and when the sounds actually play).  The case is a hard case with the fabric sleeves on the inside, but none of the discs got damaged in transport and mine worked flawlessly in the DVD player.",1404864000,,1082,4.536082474226804
5092943,5,B007KAQULG,"The subtitles are exact, and accurate. Plays well. This was my first drama I've ever watched and it will be my all time favorite, I enjoy watching it almost everyday!",1395532800,,166,4.566666666666666

5092946,5,B007KAQULG,"The story itself is just one of typical romantic stories, but I like typical romantic stories portrayed in Japanese girls comics (such as Boys Over Flowers and Playful Kiss) so enjoyed it very much. All the songs and instrumental music chosen for various scenes are excellent. I got hooked to all the songs, and now practice singing them while following lyrics found on a website.",1391299200,,380,4.861538461538461
5092947,5,B007KAQULG,"Loved it, this is one of my all time favorites.  Has two of my favorite actors.  Love the music that's in it",1387324800,,108,3.8636363636363638
5092948,5,B007KAQULG,"After having watched this many times on drama fever, I finally gave in and decided to personally own a copy!  I have seen many and many kdramas and this one is cute!  If you are new to kdrama, this is a cute and sweet introduction, however, this is not close to how your real kdramas can get to being a real kdrama.  I don't want to give anything away but this isn't your typical show where your leads finally end up together either in the last episode or the last few, and that is one thing I loved about this show.  Just knowing the two leads is enough for you to want to give this show a shot, if you loved Park Shin Hye and Jung Yong Hwa in You're Beautiful, you'll love this, especially if you were rooting for them on You're Beautiful.  And I am about to sound bias, being a CNBLUE fan and all, but I couldn't see anyone else playing the male role other than JYH.  The music is beautiful and there are scenes where you will wish JYH was serenading you instead!",1386892800,,966,4.13903743315508
5092949,5,B007KAQULG,I couldn't wait to get this in the mail. I ordered it for myself this time. The music is wonderful. I loved the story. The only thing that I was disapointed about was that the voices were not the original actors from the show. The voices they used were very good and you could follow  along very well.,1377993600,,301,4.189655172413793
5092950,5,B007KAQULG,I collect K-Drama and this one is one of many at the top of my list.  5 stars and highly recommended.,1375833600,,101,3.8095238095238093
5092951,5,B007KAQULG,"Korean movie fan, and this is one of the really good ones.  The main actors are well-matched to the roles they play, plus the music is great!  A very entertaining and engaging series.  Super fast shipping and good Customer Relations from seller....couldn't ask for anything more.",1374796800,,279,5.021739130434782
5092952,5,B007KAQULG,"I had never really knew about Korean Melodramas until I saw my mom so into it one day ever since then I have fallen love with all of them. On this one, I loved the cast from ""You're beautiful"" So, I came to Amazon and purchased it....and guess what? I LOVED IT!

5092953,5,B007KAQULG,"Lee Gyu Won and Lee Shin are students at an art college. Lee Gyu Won is a traditional Korean music major who happens to be the granddaughter of a famed musician of traditional Korean music. Her grandfather is a very narrow-minded and strict man who demands that Lee Gyu Won follow in his footsteps. Lee Shin is laid back, but is a talented and very popular rock band guitarist and lead singer.

Lee Gyu Won hires Lee Shin's band for a gig to help raise money for an ill teacher. But Lee Shin doesn't show up. Lee Gyu Won confronts Lee Shin and they immediately despise each other. They both insult each other's music and decide to have a competition. The loser is the winner's slave for a period of time. Because of an incident during the competition, Lee Gyu Won loses. Lee Shin orders Lee Gyu Won around every chance he gets. When the bet has been completed, they plan to go their separate ways. However, both unexpectedly join the school's 100th Anniversary Performance and they are thrown back together for rehearsals. After spending so much time together, will they end up falling for each other?

I love the main actor (Jung Yong Hwa) and actress (Park Shin Hye) in this story. They were in another Korean drama called ""You're  Beautiful."" I was hoping to find another show where they were both starring and I came across this. They have good chemistry. They are both great singers, I have all the songs from this show on my iPod. (The main actor is from a band called C.N. Blue. All of the band members are on the show too.) It's a romantic comedy about music, love, and pursuing one's dreams. It's my absolute favorite Korean show. I highly recommend this drama. (15 episodes, good English subtitles)",1373155200,,1708,4.57516339869281
5092954,5,B007KAQULG,"I have to say the music is what drew me the most to this. I was familiar with two of the actors from ""You are Beautiful"" and so decided to check it out. It isn't as intense as some or dramatic which was a nice switch.",1372377600,,217,3.739130434782609
5092955,5,B007KAQULG,"I love this drama so mutch that I bought it along with the sound track.  The South Koreans have the drama formula down and they don't disapoint.  This is by far one of my favorites in KDrama shows and I love Jung Yong-hwa (from the group CNBlue)and the mail lead, who is really singing and playing guitar.  The music talent in this show is worth watching.  The story line is original and is family friendly if you have a daughter I know she will fall in love with this.",1371168000,,469,4.235955056179775
5092956,3,B007KAQULG,I have seen the drama on Vicki and Drama Fever and I really liked that I could get this on dvd. I had no problem with some ost tracks cut out because I didn't like the song anyway but it made the scenes look funny because you knew they were not singing that song. Also they cut out the song where they are on the trip and Jung Yong Hwa sings the song for with just a guitar. The sound goes up and down in places and I have tried the dvd's on 3 different players to be sure it wasn't just my player but no it was the dvd sound going up and down. It is still ok as I can get my CN Blue fix. The songs I adore I have on cd's already and the dvds are watchable but with flaws. The dvds come  in a plastic box so they do rattle around but they are protected like with a cd case. It is almost the same thing.  I don't know Korean so I need subtitles but I have watched enough to know some of it is incorrect. The end subtitles and the beginning of the next esp are totally different for the same scene. The beginning ones of the esp are better than when they show the ending. I did still enjoy it as I enjoyed seeing the two of them together after Your Beautiful.,1370563200,7,1157,3.8368200836820083

8519024,4,B007KAQULG,"I liked this Korean series (sub-titled in English) ever since I first watched it as my first Korean drama on NetFlix. It is a slight let-down after bringing together 2 of the stars of You're Beautiful that many people demanded to see in their own romance. The singing and music was very good and the story wasn't too melodramatic but the male lead's character was not well-rounded and that led to a shallowness of the series. After all, what are you supposed to do with 16 episodes but character development? This is not the Hong sisters (You're Beautiful was written by them) and it shows with weakness in development. Park Shin-Hye showed well as a romantic comedy character - I was attracted by all the different faces she could make.",1449100800,,737,4.676923076923077
