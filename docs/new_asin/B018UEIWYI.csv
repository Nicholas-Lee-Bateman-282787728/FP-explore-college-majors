7555597,5,B018UEIWYI,For anyone who enjoys Slash's music or just a behind the scenes look at what it took for Slash to be well Slash.,1458259200,3,112,3.9130434782608696
7555598,5,B018UEIWYI,"Excellent video of the 1980s Sunset Strip with luminaries such as Slash and other other personnel from bands such as Motley Crue etc.  There is also another Sunset Strip DVD that gets much more historical in terms of music styles, deaths of forgotten celebrities at that famous hotel close to Beverly Hills (up in the hill etc.;sorry can't remember the Hotel's name)",1458000000,2,366,4.903225806451613

8743038,1,B018UEIWYI,"My dad got this for me as a gift, so we watched it together. Halfway through, we both agreed that it was the most BORING film either of us had ever seen. A few good short stories of Slashs' shenanigans were thrown in, but 98% of it was not even Slash talking, and excruciatingly boring. We sat through hours of aged rock legends awkwardly talking in painfully quiet rooms. I love Slash's style and admire that guy very much, but this was a low point for him. I recommend buying Slashs' biography. That book is amazing-by far the best book I have ever read, and I don't even like reading. The book has 1000x more interesting stories and information about Slash.",1519776000,,660,4.462809917355372

8743040,5,B018UEIWYI,"I wasn't going to get this because the implication from most of the sources I go by made me think it was just going to be reruns & repeats of video footage or parts of his book, been there done that stuff.  I was wrong!  I was bored and just in a funk, I had woke about 4 am & couldn't get back to sleep, couldn't find ANYTHING to read, watch or play.  I'm normally too cheap to pay for videos because I have Prime & Netflix so it has to really appeal to me to pry any cash from my wallet.  I like Slash & am of the whole G n R generation, read most of the books, liked revolver & the music he has made with Miles Kennedy & the Conspirators so I thought I'd try this movie.  It is not a repeat of old info at all!  It started out with stories from a lot of Slash's friends, which is who the movie is supposed to be about, then it covered some about the sunset strip area.  people from the business end of the music industry spoke & were spoken of, then it went back to more stories about Slash & his time in G n R.  it finished up with stories about his more adult life & the more current music.  No reunion was on the table at the time this was filmed so obviously none of that.  All said I did not feel that I had wasted my money in the slightest, I enjoyed the movie and can easily recommend it to anyone that enjoys rock music.",1462492800,,1331,3.860294117647059

8743043,5,B018UEIWYI,"Hi!  Love Slash for his soulful guitar playing; work ethic; business and marketing expertise; fearlessness to try new things; his excellent entertainment techniques (saw him play live a couple of timesamazing); and now his charity work!

When he gave an old Joe Perry guitar back to Joe Perry, I thought, What a man!  I could date someone like that who is so selfless.  Hopefully it was Slashs idea and not his ex prodding him to do so!

This is a cool DVD because so many other artists contribute and give perspective about the times and eras of bands.  It was fun to see the areas where he grew up and perfected his musical skills.

Glad that Slash wrote his book, too.  It is excellent because it explains his musical training, addictions and getting/staying clean.  I also read Steven Adler, Duff McKagan (surprised how much we have in common), and Aerosmith books.  Most of all, Nicky Sixxs Heroin Diaries really taught me about drug addiction.  Personally, I never had interest in drugs or alcohol (just food and exercise).  So glad that these guys educated me as my friends niece is hooked on drugs and we expect to bury her soon.  We are helpless but at least we now understand her behavior.

I read book, The Girl with Seven Names.  Just know too many women in this world who have or are suffering.  I had to ooohhhh  unfriend Slash because his Facebook page made me so depressed on how the women are belittled on that site.  I wish he respected women more or maybe the women around him respected themselves more.

Looking forward to Slashs new music with GNR!  Who would believe?!  Don't forget to visit Minnesota!

Keep working Slash!!!  Love your artistry!  Hope to enjoy many more years of your amazing music.  I LOVE rock n' roll because it allows me to be a bit wild instead of always a serious business woman!  My friends just laugh because they cannot picture me at rock concerts!!",1459728000,4,1898,4.607784431137724

8743045,1,B018UEIWYI,If you have read his book then you don't need to watch this. It's just a rehash of his book.,1458604800,2,92,3.65
