2620581,5,B000GYHRHO,"With all the 9/11 conspiracy movies out there talking about missiles and passengers being taken to hangers and all kinds of other fringe theories, it's great to finally see a movie that strikes to the heart of the 9/11 cover-up.  The Jersey Girl's brought the Bush Administration to their knees when they forced them to form the 9/11 Commission.  These women and the other 9/11 survivors didn't give up when their Government said no to an investigation into 9/11.  And to this day they continue to pursue the answers to 100's of questions the commission failed to address.  This film is a must see for everyone regardless of political stance or preconceived ideas of what happened on 9/11.  If you are a fan of our Government and it's handling of 9/11, you will be overwhelmed and disgusted by what you see.  If you harbor doubts or are critical of the way the Bush Administration dealt with 9/11, then you will be vilified and empowered.  Don't wait for Christmas to give this film to as many of your friends and family as you can.",1157673600,31,1032,4.60655737704918

2620585,2,B000GYHRHO,"This movie is really for the complete feebs who know nothing about 911 except what is fed to them.
If you have researched 911 this movie will be quite a disappointment.
1 there is no truth ""exposed"" in the film, it simply documents a small portion of the cover up as experienced by these women.
2 Their press is a complete failure. They are duped by gov lawyers(at your expense)and get 2% of the information the requested.
3 Nothing in the movie even implies that US and Israel were involved in the execution of 9.11.
4 its only apparent purpose is to implicate Pakistan as a possible contributor to 911, and of course to show that the US government authority is not to be challenged .

So if you are one of the few with their heads up their----- for the last 13 years please take a look at why some people are angry.
Then move on to youtube for interviews with actual people, firemen and police who were there to experience the explosions first hand, AND demolition experts who all conclude that the 3 wtcs were brought down with explosives.",1414627200,,1042,4.455497382198953

2620594,5,B000GYHRHO,"Another compelling documentary raising legitimate questions/suspicions about the official story (or stories) of what really happened on 911 as unconvincingly relayed by the Bush/Cheney administration and which ended with a shameful Official 911 Commission(or rather Omissions) report planned/supervised and produced by Paul Zelikof. Bush, Cheney and Zelikof (a Condoleesa Rice buddy and book co author) made sure that the majority of fundamental questions raised by the victims' families and by thousands of authoritative experts and distinguished Americans and Europeans remained ignored/unanswered.

All the evidence, omissions,contradictions and authoritative testimonies  emerging since 911 particularly on the Internet,the latest of which 1300 Architects and Engineers petitioning Obama (with no response so far)  for a truly independent and international investigation, point to a shameful cover up meant to protect the real organizers/culprits who are probably hiding in Washington's shadowy corridors of power.",1298592000,3,1018,6.36231884057971
2620595,5,B000GYHRHO,"My husband and I just watched this documentary together. I believe we came away better informed about the very complicated story surrounding September 11. The film does not pretend to know all the answers -- it just lays out the facts we have and encourages all of us to ""press for truth."" Americans who have questioned the sanctioned version have been attacked as un-American or as nuts who should be investigated, jailed, or institutionalized. The level of emotion that has been directed at marginalizing these people has made me believe that there must be something to their questions.

This film does not engage in speculation. Rather, it presents reasonable questions along with known facts to present a story that is quite different from that delivered by the government and the mainstream media. Many people are committed to the simple authorized version of events whereby 19 hijackers, directed by a web of terrorists working out of caves in Afghanistan, took down four airliners with box cutters and flew them into prime targets -- all under the radar of US intelligence. We are told that nothing could have been done to stop this; that no one in our government had ever even conceived of such a thing. This film presents a much more complicated story with no easy answers.",1293926400,4,1282,4.907834101382488

It tells the story of four women whose husbands were killed in the World Trade Center, and their determination to have an investigation of the events of Sept. 11th.  After years of fighting the system and the Bush administration, they don't get all the answers to their questions, which leads the viewer to understand just how little we know about what really happened on Sept. 11th, 2001.

2620598,5,B000GYHRHO,"Having seen the ""911 Mysteries:Part 1 Demolitions,"" I thought my eyes couldn't widen further. I was wong. This documentary, ""9/11 Press
For Truth,"" increases your governmental anger monumentally by exposing near its conclusion the money trail from the White House to Pakistan to our ""enemies"" and Bin Laden, who miraculously gets air-lifted time and again to safety. No warnings? 228 notifications prior. Imagine Lincoln providing trains for Lee's escape at every encounter. Imagine a government taking its intelligence seriously spending $100 million on Bill Clinton's peccadilloes and only $2 million on the largest catastrophe on our shores. What curiosity and amateur sleuthing in ""Press For Truth"" is remarkable beyond belief.  How much additional facts does a public need to mount the ramparts?See the bogus commissioners chery-picked. Hear how the average citizen is treated by our unconcerned representatives. These 911 widows deserve the highest patriot award for their diggings.  Not only do they get lied to and deceived at every turn, but a handful of veteran warrior journalists (Hersh etc.)deserve praise for their dismissed efforts to the large scale of this governmental puzzle. This proves beyond the pulverized cloud that the checks and balances ended that day and what remains as the constitutional bone yard dog is a chichuahua. Do not watch after a heavy meal.",1247529600,7,1381,5.4186046511627906
2620599,5,B000GYHRHO,"This is an excellent documentary for it's focus on hard research.  It exposes the 911 cover up in a reserved, hard research type approach. It focuses on the struggle that victims families went through to even have an investigation done! (911 Commission Report), then explores the fact that the mechanics of the events of that day point to government complicity, then exposes some of the money trails leading to Pakistan. Someone said it merely scratches the surface, and it does.  It is not the most complete documentary out there as far as exposing the government's true involvement,  but  It is a gentle introduction that is a good for those who are wary of ""theories"".
So, see this movie, get mad, then go to something  like Loose Change, Unanswered Questions, The Great Conspiracy with Barry Zwicker.",1198195200,5,804,4.925925925925926
2620600,5,B000GYHRHO,"9/11 has become an Internet phenomenon. There are over 30 million websites, blogs, forums and films devoted to the subject. 20 Million people have watched a documentary on the Internet called ""Loose Change"" which attacks the official version of the events of that day. The movie moguls have taken notice. The documentary is a hit!

There are a multitude of ""Documentaries"" on the Internet that purport the atrocities of 9/11 were an inside job or false flag operation. A government plot to unify the American people and allow them to follow the Government's foreign policies without question. These Filmmakers generally use images whined from the Internet or documentaries, official films, new reports and amateur footage. The resulting effect is professional and more often than not thought provoking.

One rather poor documentary called ""Ripple Effect"" asks questions and points out numerous anomalies surrounding the attacks but unfortunately follows the more ridiculous theories that logic should dispel. The most striking portion of this film is the evidence presented of media bias and intimidation. Fox news being the most shameful culprit.

The raw physics explained in most of these non-conformist documentaries on 9/11 is the most compelling argument that the line fed to the American public by its Government might be a false one. All the Internet documentaries follow the same initial thesis, produce the same circumstantial evidence and ask the same questions. The only difference in opinion is as to the specific, why?

Most theories agree that a controlled drone or missile hit the pentagon. Most agree that explosives were used to bring down the twin towers and the lesser-known World Trade Centre Building Number 7. This building fell to the ground with out a plane hitting it. Flight 93 leaves the most unanswered questions but all theorists agree that the crash site is suspiciously free of debris or bodies.

A recent documentary by the BBC that tried to debunk the accusations made by Internet documentaries like ""Loose Change"" and ""Painful Deceptions"" yet made no mention of the most controversial and persuasive theory; that the buildings fell at freefall speed. The BBC documentary did admit, however, that a cover-up after the event was undisputable.

A new film called ""9/11 Press For Truth"" has the distinction of opening in the cinemas. It can now be seen for free on the Internet. This sober film catalogues the absurd struggle of some bereaved wives in trying to find out the truth about the attacks on 9/11 from their very own Government.  The stonewalling they endure is sinister in the extreme and Condoleezza Rice dodging direct questions posed by the 9/11 Commission is shocking and sickening. This begs the question, what is the American Government so afraid of?

Having watched a number of these films I find myself asking the same difficult questions that all conspiracy theorists have considered.

Why did World Trade Centre Building Number 7 collapse?

Why did it go largely unreported?

Why did the Twin Towers crash down at free fall speed?

Why is there no plane wreckage at the pentagon?

Where is the wreckage of Flight 93 now?

These questions are the hardest to explain and the hardest to refute. The non-conformist view is that controlled demolitions were responsible for the 3 buildings crashing to the ground on the same day. The official explanation offered by the Official 9/11 Report, FEMA, Popular Mechanics and NIST follow the line that the shock of the planes hitting the buildings, the resulting fires caused by burning fuel and office furnishings caused the steel structure to weaken and thus collapse. This of course does not explain the remarkably efficient collapse of all three buildings including World Trade Centre Number 7, which was not even mentioned in the Official 9/11 report.

Popular Mechanics has tried quite energetically to dispute the questions that have been raised by these intrepid filmmakers. Their privileged position has allowed them access to photographic and video evidence that has not yet been made public. On a recent televised debate on ""Democracy Now!""  between the young filmmakers of ""Loose Change"" and Editor in Chief of Popular Mechanics, the latter admitted this special access and used it as defence to an argument about plane debris at the pentagon. ""We saw debris in photographs!"" The young directors asked why they were not permitted to see these photographs.

John Gross the lead engineer of the NIST report, which follows the Governments official account of towers destruction on 9/11, was unaware that three pools of molten steel were reported, filmed and photographed under each of the three towers weeks after their destruction. He was also unaware of NASA thermal images that registered these extreme temperatures and their locations.

The clear up of ground zero also leaves the Internet theorists with an enormous quantity of loaded questions such as; why was the steel of the towers removed so quickly and either sold abroad or buried before investigations could be conducted. These questions have remained unanswered.

A final shocker freely admitted by the FBI is that there is no evidence to link Usama Bin Laden to the attacks on 9/11. This final admition only goes to prove that the story fed to the American Public is inaccurate.

Conspiracy theories abound when information is withheld, subverted, restricted, censored or denied, which is plainly the case here. The lack of desire by the American Government to investigate with integrity and honesty such an appalling crime is shameless.

Maybe the Conspiracy theorists unknowingly are playing into the Governments hands by clouding the issues and obscuring the truth with theory. The scary thing is that an ever-growing cross-section of the American Public can quite willingly believe that their Government is quite capable of such horrendous atrocities.",1192406400,9,5919,5.196428571428571
2620601,5,B000GYHRHO,"I watched this documentary last night -- and though it was excellent. It really doesn't take too much research to find out what really happened - and more importantly - what didn't happen on 9/11.

This film has done an excellent job of putting in one place all the key points that must be ignored for the official 9/11 legend to remain intact.

One thing that I feel this film did (perhaps) a poor job of, is not mentioning the American side of the equation that facilitated the free movement of Mohammed Atta and the other supposed hijackers whilst in America.

The film touched upon the $100,000 wired to Atta via Omar Saeed (Daniel Pearl's executioner) in Dubai from General Mahmood -- but it did not mention the trip Atta took onboard a Suncruz casino cruise ship owned by Jack Abramovich days before 9/11, or the fact that he left that $100,000 on the ship. The film also fails to mention that the man who owned the store where the wired $100,000 was collected from -  Majik Chams - was an employee of Titan Corp. (one of  the biggest beneficiaries of the invasion of Iraq). It might have also been worth mentioning that after 9/11, Jeb Bush personally arrived at the flight school Atta and others attended in Venice, Florida, to seize the records of that flight school. It may have also been prudent to mention the close ties the owner of that flight - Wally Hilliard -has to the CIA. This link to the CIA is best illustrated by the involvement of companies Mr. Hilliard is linked to being used in the extraordinary rendition program ran by the CIA -- and more vividly by the number of times planes owned by Mr. Hillard have flown from Afghanistan to Guantanamo, Cuba. To some it may just seem coincidence that the same man who hosted Mohammed Atta at his flight school -- is also involved in the rounding up of al Queda terrorists, but I think there may be more to this that just coincidence.

An excellent film -- and one that should be shown to all Americans.",1191196800,8,1969,4.50140056022409
2620602,1,B000GYHRHO,"Considering nobody paid any attention to DRG until he tapped into the lucrative conspiracy market with his ""The New Pearl Harbor,"" or to the three stooges of the Loose Change video, Dylan Avery, Korey Rove, Jason Bermas, any independent observer must conclude that they were conscripted by the Bush administration to create dissent and confusion about 911.

With the help of DRG and the Loose Change dolts, Americans are distracted from the obvious inherent flaws in the U.S. intelligence and air defense systems. This is a stroke of genius by the Bush administration since it kills two birds with one stone. The world believes Bush to be a master manipulator and planner of Machiavellian proportions, while simultaneously deflecting attention away from impending divorce.

DRG's lack of historical knowledge makes him an ideal conduit for disinformation. His credentials as an epistemologist/theologian/academic may not shore up his credibility as someone who has anything more than a nodding acquaintance with aviation, demolition, and architecture, but his previous relative obscurity makes him unique among the usual Hollywood Liberals.

The Loose Change trio were thrown in for comedic relief.",1190160000,5,1198,5.5

It shows many mainstream acknowledged details about foreknowledge of attacks and exposes connections between the CIA, Pakistani ISI, and Bin Laden's Al Qaeda fighters.  It could have gone much farther in presenting damning evidence, but it sticks to the details that support a ""let it happen on purpose"" hypothesis.  The film relies heavily on Paul Thompson's timeline surrounding 9/11 and the efforts of the Jersey widows to get the government to respond to their questions about 9/11.  Their testimony reveals that most of their questions and concerns were ignored by the government, as a majority of 9/11 families now support further investigation and distrust the government.  This movie shows that the 9/11 Truth movement honors the dead and their families by seeking the truth and justice pertaining to those events.  Those who truly dishonor the families of those killed in the attacks are the government and media gangsters who suppress new investigations and defend the litany of lies offered by the government.",1187654400,8,1181,5.288770053475936

Our Goverment may not have planned the attacks on 9-11, but it is becoming more clear that they opened the door to our skies and allowed it to happen. Corruption is stinking to high heaven and I'm sure when Richard Clark came out and admitted his guilt, President Bush made calls to some powerful friends to see if they could rub him out.  To give you an example of some unsolved mysteries..they could not find most parts of the airplanes that crashed on Sept 11 because they said that the heat melted them, but can you believe they were able to find the passport of one of the highjackers?

NOTHING! this '9/11: press for truth' is just another evidence in a hearing loss case. i never knew that i was watched until one day when i brought a binoculars to airport just for the purpose of seeking out my wife's arrival at the lax. by using my newly purchased handful binoculars, i didn't have to squeeze myself in the crowd and could watch the exit from afar. then suddenly two plain-cloth guys walked up to me and started harassing me, requested my i.d., driver license, credit cards. they questioned me the reason why i would bring a binoculars into the airport? why i didn't mix with the crowd? why i didn't keep focus on the exit but sometimes moved my bino to look elsewhere? gosh, i didn't feel anything but a funny feeling. since when people who bring binoculars into terminal would become suspicious? if bird watching is not against law, why people watching would become a suspicious subject?

since when a binoculars carrying person would become a suspicious person outside or inside a terminal? so i accidentally became guilty until i could prove that i was innocent?",1172707200,6,2057,4.910919540229885

Nothing included that isn't in the mainstream press - just on the back page, and spread out over five years.  The film makes few of the outright accusations that ""Loose Change 2nd - Ed"" does towards any of the events or people involved in 9/11, but delivers more of damning argument that we've been lied to - there weren't just mistakes made, but distortions and deceit at the highest levels of our government.

They offer SOME truth, but the manner in which they are presented make them (and anyone who believes that stuff) appear as lunatics.  It makes me wonder whose side they are on.  911: Press For Truth, on the other hand, presents things in a logical, questioning manner.

Forget fringe movies like ""Loose Change,"" which undercut their own message by jumping to conclusions and engaging in wild, baseless speculation in many scenes.

This movie puts the 9/11 Timeline to devastating use, completely blowing out of the water the idea that we had no real warnings prior to 9/11.  It also shows what a sham the 9/11 commission was--a modern day Warren Commission--and you'll be floored when you see who was put in charge of it (remember the original choice?  That's right: Henry Kissinger).

The reason this movie works so well is that it doesn't ask and answer questions for you, as ""Loose Change"" did--just lays everything out right in front of you, and you will be floored.

Easily without a doubt the golden standard movie for all those who are interested in the REAL story of what happened on 9/11.

2620628,5,B000GYHRHO,"This is really a fantastic flick in my opinion. They did a spectacular job on this. It's 1 hour and 24 minutes long and very well done. It is not so much speculative as retrospective. It covers the story of the 911 Families' quest to get an independent investigation of the events leading up to and on 9/11, what became known as the 9/11 Commission  (some call it the 9/11 Omission), chaired by former NJ Governor Keane. It shows why the 9/11 Families were disappointed and that the Commission was neither thorough nor independent. It is not so much opinion as many, many news clips of Administration officials making hard to explain mendacious statements on major media outlets which in the context of what has occurred since, now seems absolutely shocking. It gives the inside story of what it took to pressure the government into forming the Commission in the first place and how reluctant the government was into investigating the tragedy.  Clips of Dan Rather and other media people at the end attempt to answer the question of why main stream media has for the most part dropped the ball in reporting this important story to the American people.  A must see for anyone who still believes in the American electoral process. Even if you think you know everything there is to know about 9/11 you will find a few surprises here.",1160611200,22,1330,4.6995708154506435
2620629,5,B000GYHRHO,"Independently made films now seem to be one of the few ways in which Americans can get closer to the facts about what's going on.  Although I am in utter disagreement with the other reviewers:  1) most of the so-called ""conspiracy theories"" are not bunk and should not be dismissed without a deep and respectful hearing.  The perjorative, randomly applied, ""catch-all"" term ""conspiracy theory"" is quite loosely thrown around by people who simply do not know what they're talking about and wish to sound like they do. For instance: ""Loose Change"" IS a heavily researched film that every American should see.  2) ""Farenheit 911"" was NOT the 'partisan' effort that facsist pundits in the employ of corporate media interests wanted and succeeded in getting most Americans to believe it was so that they would not see it.  In reality, ""Farenheit 911"" was an enormous work of ART and a courageous act of patriotism (one only wishes every film, especially this one, was as well wrought).

That off my chest - 911 / Press For Truth powerfully tells the story of the realizations which have arisen since the terrible tragedy of that day through the perspective of family members of a number of those who died in the targeted structures.

Their experience highlights:

1) The U.S. government was specifically evasive and NOT interested in getting to the truth of what happened and in fact

blocked and stalled the inquiries of the bereaved American citizens.

2) The much delayed 911 Commission was a ""whitewash"" - avoiding all tough questions - specifically holding NO accountability - and headed by politically partisan figures.

(Nicely shown by the film is the dissent of one of the few non-partisan commissioners, Max Cleland, the triple Vietnam War amputee, who was later mysteriously defeated for re-election in Georgia through what is now widely suspected to be voting machine fraud.)

3) Paul Thompson's celebrated, but not widely enough known, 911 Timeline revealing a definite link between Al-Quaeda and Pakistan military and government intelligence - and a extensively detailed exposition of Osama Bin Laden's mysterious escape from Tora Bora.

4)  The recognition that we much need some sort of public (not corporate), non-partisan oversight of the media.  Like a national press accountability day?)

5) It's time we start making judicious treatment of those who have innocently suffered most (in deference to those with the most money and/or power) in our country - THE PRIORITY.

There is more here - much more - and YES - EVERY AMERICAN VOTER SHOULD SEE THIS FILM.  But, please try to view it with an open mind. Isn't it time for America to get out of the patriarchial quietism of the 'Bill O'Reilly mode of denial' and finally begin to grow up into the stature of the true world leader this great nation could and should be?",1158105600,67,2831,4.961864406779661
2620630,5,B000GYHRHO,"This film is NOT A CONSPIRACY THEORY.  It simply lays out mainstream news reports in a timeline.  A timeline that becomes disturbing very quickly.

However, the main truth one walks away from when cold hard facts are laid out is that govt., media, and all of us should have been asking some hard questions.  The 9/11 widows and families thru their grief found the strength to do just that.  For that they have been attacked by Republican operatives like Anne Coulter, who called them ""harlots . . . who enjoyed their husbands death.""

The TRUTH is, that the way the US govt., and particularly the Republican Party have treated the 9/11 family members is a disgrace that will drag on our beloved country for many years.

The ONLY way to correct the wrong done to these brave widows and families of 9/11, is to launch a whole NEW 9/11 investigation that looks into EVERYTHING about 9/11, not just what fits with the ""official"" story of the Bush Administration.  Of course we should not just do this for the 9/11 family members who courageously have fought for it, but also for ourselves.  Two wars and now a possible 3rd with Iran are being pushed on Americans using the hammer of 9/11.  This administration, and their friends in Congress have attacked opponents of wars using the hammer of 9/11, and they have hijacked our foriegn policy to a militarist ""endless preemptive war"" policy using the hammer of 9/11 to beat down opponents here and internationally.  The way the 9/11 victims have been used by this administration will go down in history's anals of shame.

Where was the Air Force for an hour and a half on 9/11?

How, after getting specific warnings of planes being used as missiles and the WTCs being possible targets, before 9/11, could our President have thought the first tower being hit on 9/11 was ""a bad pilot or something""?

How did the three WTC buildings defy physics and fall at near free fall speed, becoming the first 3 steel reinforced skyscrapers in history to collapse due to fire and/or external damage?  WTC building 7 was not hit by a plane that day.  Why did it collapse like a classic controlled demolition on that day.

Although this documentary doesn't explore the WTC issue in the depth I would have liked, it is a brilliant expose of the fact that this govt. fought the 9/11 widows every step of the way and that 70% of the victim's families questions remain unanswered.

Again, this film MUST be viewed by every American.  Get it, watch it, pass it on to everyone you know.  Only thru truth can our nation heal.  The truth is being covered up.  This cannot stand.
