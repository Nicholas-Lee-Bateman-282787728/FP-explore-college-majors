7307233,1,B010CG2E82,I have to give it only one star when I can't even make it through the first five minutes.  I've seen school projects that look better than this.  This graphics were ridiculous cut and paste images.  Even the bugs were not and did not look real.  You can tell when she was driving it was a very poorly done cut and paste of the road she is supposedly driving on.  It might be free but that does not make it worth watching or a look at.  This is a watch at your own risk and then regret.  I know nothing about film making and I could put together a better movie.,1449446400,3,560,3.990990990990991
7307234,2,B010CG2E82,"I don't know if you've ever seen a movie by Ralph Bakshi, but he did a couple of movies that used animation and live film that was colorized or painted over. (One was called ""Wizards"" and the other was the first film attempt at the ""Hobbit"")..
Well, this for as long as I could watch it reminded me of that and maybe a poor man's Sin City to the tune a poorly acted zombie flick..
I thought I could endure anything, but this just wasn't my cup of tea..
Check it out as long as it's free, I guess...........................

7307235,3,B010CG2E82,"Nothing really new here. Some effort put into story line. Some effort put into acting. No effort put into dialog. The special effects are cartoon style and give the film a Tank Girl feel, for good or bad.",1448668800,,204,4.394736842105263
7307236,1,B010CG2E82,They should rename this movie Don't waste your time watching this POS. I would like to find the people who made it and ask for my time back that I wasted. It was long before I stop watching this crap.,1479600000,,200,4.025
7307237,1,B010CG2E82,Don't watch.,1478563200,,12,5.5
7307238,1,B010CG2E82,Were they trying to see how bad a movie can be made?  I've seen better special effects on YouTube from HS kids doing class projects.,1472428800,,132,4.28

7307240,1,B010CG2E82,WOW! I CANT! I just CANT! Right out the gate the special effects and lame acting are killing me! I am a fan of a lot of zombie movies and pretty open to low budget zombie movies but this makes it to the top of the list of crap films :P,1468368000,,235,3.627450980392157
7307241,2,B010CG2E82,"Not good, bad acting,bad special effects,watched about 10 minutes. The 2 stars are for effort.",1466985600,,94,5.333333333333333

7307243,1,B010CG2E82,I actually had to force myself to watch a full five minutes.,1465603200,,60,4.083333333333333
7307244,1,B010CG2E82,I didn't enjoy it.,1465171200,,18,3.75
7307245,1,B010CG2E82,That was just awful.  I am trying to figure out how to delete this poor example of a film from my history so it doesn't keep showing up with recommendations based on having watched this mess.  It is too bad I cannot unwatch it.,1460160000,,227,4.136363636363637
7307246,5,B010CG2E82,"What David Allen has been able to accomplish with this masterpiece is completely jaw dropping.

The bird and smoke effects during the vast majority of outdoor shots really help to immerse the viewer into the storyline.

This post-production work also includes blood spatter, explosions, and some of the most effective and important first-person views from a) the zombies, b) the protagonist, c) baby zombies, and d) the bullets fired.

There is patchwork green screen, which the director is using here to pay homage to retro SEGA CD, 3DO, and arcade games - consider ""Night Trap"" or those people jumping around at the end of ""Cruisin' World"" for a fairly accurate representation of the material here. You may have your own favorite FMV video game that you could use as an example as well if you prefer, no matter what,

Just when you think David has used all of the tricks up his sleeve he goes and uses an overlay that shows lightning bugs.

The voice actors who have dubbed over the original language do so with such emotion and skill that it was quite difficult to believe that the film was not originally shot in English.

If I have to make one complaint, it's that I didn't hear the Wilhelm scream a single time.",1455926400,,1217,4.663551401869159
7307247,5,B010CG2E82,"This movie gives John Wick a run for its money in gritty realistic action. Robert Kirkman has openly stated that this movie was so effective at conveying the human condition in a post-apocalyptic zombie wasteland that he feels The Walking Dead was ultimately a failure. Watch this movie for the action, rewatch it for the philosophical quandaries that will change the way you view life and death. 10/10, would buy again.",1455926400,2,420,4.929577464788732

7307250,1,B010CG2E82,I could have have made a better movie in my back yard.,1454544000,,54,3.5833333333333335
7307251,1,B010CG2E82,"What a absolute stupid movie, absolute waste of time, absolute waste of money, this movie is got to be one of the most absolute worst zombie movie I have ever seen..... Please spare yourselves",1452902400,,192,4.676470588235294
7307252,1,B010CG2E82,"I'm like pretty much speechless at how bad this is. I've watched hundreds of zombie movies. This one has got to have the WORST special effects, make up and film quality. I mean it's like a 10 year old did the CGI and that's not really make up! It's masks they bought at a post-Halloween clearance sale. Just don't do it!",1451865600,,320,4.262295081967213
7307253,2,B010CG2E82,"Two survivors with special skills training are traveling on their way to....who the heck knows. They are confronted by two characters who drive around like they are playing ""Death Race 2000"" not caring if they kill humans or zombies. Much of the film includes first person narration which was dubbed lower than the soundtrack making it a chore to hear it.

Absolute Zombies approaches Absolute Zero in name but not quality. The special effects were laughably bad, i.e. so bad it is good. If you have seen ""Birdemic"" (1 or 2), the special effects are seriously worse, about the worse one could do without a crayon, unless it was a talented kid with the crayon.

They should have just filmed those two guys driving around killing things. That was fun.

Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity.  1 1/2 stars",1450915200,,797,4.712230215827338
7307254,1,B010CG2E82,"I could only watch 20 minutes. Hard to hear dialog over lousy music.

OMG, it's garbage. I think the people that made this should have used their ""allowances"" in a better way.",1450569600,2,175,4.46875
7307255,1,B010CG2E82,"They did it! I didn't think that it was possible but they have done it. A movie worse than Oasis of the Zombies. This is worth a look only to see the worst special effects I have ever seen for a film created after 1960. Oye, downright silly. But watch a little bit and scroll around. Seriously, YouTubers have produced better work than this.",1449792000,8,341,4.34375
8721902,4,B010CG2E82,"This is like Adult Swim, Liquid Television and Bad Taste had a baby, a def WTF movie experience into the surreal. It's a generic Zombie 3 plot with over the top characters, devil worshipers, an Indiana Jones like Mayan undead god, and general Monty Python animated weirdness.",1509580800,,275,4.872340425531915
8721903,5,B010CG2E82,"A lot of people are calling this the worst movie ever. I don't think it is. I just watched Maggie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and it was much worse.

This movie has a lot of good things in it. Explosions, zombies, zombie killing, car chases, guns with 2,000 round magazines, a black guy, Nazis, and crazy cult people and a constant bee attack.

I you like visual effects, you're in for a treat. Just about the whole movie was shot next to a green screen. Lots going on here.

I'll admit I didn't hear a damn word anyone was saying because of the low voice audio, but you can figure out the plot without it.",1501977600,,609,4.324561403508772
8721904,3,B010CG2E82,"Struggled with the 3rd star here, but eventually I caved. The best way to describe the production style aesthetic is 80's music video mixed with 90's video game. I at first thought the use of miniatures, bad animation, and bad green screen/digital work was to cover a non-budget. While I'm sure that is definitely part of it, the director keeps this style all the way through the film. They also mix in grindhouse homage like aged film, and car chase scenes appear to have come straight out of 80's arcade racing games. Put it all together and it's avante garde on a shoestring. The director's dedication to this style all the way through, jarring and cringe-worthy as it is, pushed me to the 3rd star. Yeah, the plot is pretty bad and the acting is uneven at best, but if you're a genre fan looking for something a little different and don't mind the cheesiness it's no worse than a lot of the stuff you've likely already watched.",1499558400,,931,4.5476190476190474

8721907,1,B010CG2E82,"The other reviewers have summed it up this mess a lot more elegantly than I ever could.  I'll add that it's no surprise that the sound quality is so incredibly poor that it's impossible to discern the background noise from the blond babbling.  I lasted about 15 minutes before tapping out.
 A real stinker.",1492128000,,306,4.62962962962963

8721911,1,B010CG2E82,"Seriously !!!  I could have made a movie better than this and I've never produced a movie before.  If I could I would have given it zero stars.  No, I take that back.  I would have given it a half a star.  And that would be just for showing how to not make a movie. How did this even make it on Amazon Prime?  This is an understatement, but ""What a disaster"" !!!",1481673600,,362,3.8904109589041096
