8165080,3,B000LXGWC6,"This is a tale of two brothers one who has cerebal palsy and the other in need of help and a bit of love. There is a blatant tale of love and co-dependency but it's the side characters that really add the spice to this tale.  The only fault I had with this movie was I would of liked more dialogue for Ajay and his lady love and less songs but he is playing an introvert. The story is well done and you have your tear jerk moments and your happier moments. Throughout this film there is a complete and honest tale of what it's like to take care of a person with special needs and how easy it is to make that person your whole life ;and how detrimental to both of you it could become without some balance.

 The character Ajay plays is strong in many ways but an introvert. It's easier for him to stay in his comfortable insular world at work and home than it is to try to bond with strangers.  His relationship with the father of the girl next door is his only real friendship. The neighbors daughter has a case of unrequited love for him that is poignant and somewhat derivative of his own experiences..one sided.  His is a strict routine everyday because of his brothers limited ability to adapt to change..or is it Ajays inability to change. One day his old boss asks him to meet his niece. She's on the look out for a good man. Her prior fiance broke off with her because he believed her to be unlucky. Ajay can hardly refuse the man . He will make a polite visit,  have tea, and of course go home. One problem. He is completely floored by her. He is used to a strict routine and no quick changes. This scares him at a different personal level. She will bring about many changes in his life , give him hope and ultimately have to change some herself. This movie is about their possible life together if they can compromise.",1340064000,,1827,4.235632183908046
