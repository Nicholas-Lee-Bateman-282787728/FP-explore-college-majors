8367397,3,B002EAYED8,"This, too -- like most of the Warner's Archive Collection -- is essentially a dvd-r but of better quality than most people make at home. Chapter breaks are every 10 minutes, regardless of plot breaks. I wanted this for my Joan Crawford and William Haines collections, but would have preferred at least a regular DVD.",1497744000,,316,4.763636363636364
8367398,3,B002EAYED8,"William Haines you can take or leave, but all Joan Crawford fans should have this film in their collections. Her make-up isn't always the best, which means there are times when she looks older HERE than she did in 'Grand Hotel' 5 years later (!), but her inherent beauty and STAR POWER are nevertheless undeniable!!!! The way her face, and her EYES come to life and sparkle during the crucial close-ups - evincing all manner of emotion - confirms that she was one of the best actresses of all time. Clearly, the director did a terrific job with her here, and I honestly believe that even if silent films are NOT your cup of tea, you can still enjoy her performance here EVERY BIT AS MUCH as you would in one of her sound films, because her acting is SO VIVID and LIFE-LIKE!! It's like watching a real live, three dimensional person - albeit with all the specificity and effortless artistry that characterize the performances of 'Representational' actors like her (as distinct from actors who simply telegraph on the one hand, or give extreme 'naturalistic' performances that can never qualify as ART on the other hand!!)

There are some fantastic supporting performances too - namely the exceedingly sympathetic father (who will melt your heart time and again throughout the picture!!!!), the entertainingly gruff boss, and the wealthy young widow who wants William Haines' character for herself.

Not a masterpiece by any means, and not one of Joan Crawford's ""best"" films, but a picture that still has a great deal to offer viewers, and an early example of Joan's LUMINOUS LEADING LADY attributes. :)",1441497600,,1602,4.864468864468864
8367399,5,B002EAYED8,"William ""Billy"" Haines with his favorite gal-pal Joan Crawford, or 'Cranberry"" as he liked to teasingly call her, romp in this film centered around golf.  As is typical of any William Haines picture he comes off as immanently likeable and shows off his versatile acting skills  The fact that his co-star, Crawford, is also a great friend in real life, only adds to their on-screen chemistry.  Haines character, Jack Kelly, is a poor boy hoping to make it big in golf and scoop up some cash along the way, which he does.  We get lots of sport, romance, and comedy.  We even get some genuine pathos in the relationship between Jack and his elderly father, all of which add to the appeal of this 1927 silent.",1432771200,4,705,4.563492063492063
8367400,5,B002EAYED8,"Although I am not crazy about silent films, there is something very special about the silent pictures that Joan made. We truly got to see her genuine acting abilities as she conveyed so many words and emotions without saying a world. ""Spring Fever"" is a very early film for Joan, released in 1927 (less than 2 years after she started making films). In this movie Joan plays Allie Monte a rich woman of ""high society"" who meets a young man who wasn't from the same background as hers. This is one of Joan's rarest films, up until this DVD it has never been released on any format (although it is shown on TCM from time to time).",1250640000,5,627,4.367521367521367
8367401,4,B002EAYED8,My six year old son loves Nascar racing.  We rented this movie from our local library and now he has to have a copy.  He loves that the video covers all his favorite drivers and races. The discussions along with the  video are easy enough for a child to enjoy and it covers Nascar with enough  detail so that an adult can watch along too. We recommend this video to  anyone who enjoys the racing circuit.,961632000,2,404,4.2631578947368425
