7788522,5,0766232336,"This is my favorite FIRM video.  Su Mi's energy is endless, and this workout does more in 30 minutes then most others do in 60.  Highly recommended if you don't want to spend too much time working out, but want to get maximum results.  The cueing was a little tricky the first time I watched it, but after a few time, I have it down now. Though I own a lot of different workout DVD's, I've been using this one consistently for several years now, and it continues to be one of my favorites.  I wish Sue Mi Powell had more exercise DVD's.",1359590400,,536,4.174757281553398
7788523,1,0766232336,The item was loose in the case so it was severely scratched. It didn't play right so I sent it back.,1297814400,,100,3.8095238095238093
7788524,5,0766232336,I have been a FIRM fan since the 1990's and have over 60 of their DVD and VHS workouts.  This is my first review.  This fast paced 30 minute cardio with light weights gets the heart pumping.  The music is catchy and the moves are fun to do. I love exercising and this is one of my favorite DVDs when I want a shorter cardio workout.,1241913600,,332,4.0
