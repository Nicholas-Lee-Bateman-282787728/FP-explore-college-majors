4466637,1,B004UA8D1E,This is a blatant rip off by Amazon playing on the current popularity of Bradley Cooper and hoping that no one will research past the 2 minute preview u get online to find out about the movie. I later found out that the movie is an indie film that was done in 2002. The worst part was they charged a HD quality price of $4.99 for a grainy low budget film. The lead character is a young woman who grew up in a carnival where it's the norm to create an illusion and rip the suckers off - and that's exactly what I feel happened here!,1308268800,8,531,4.018867924528302
4466638,5,B004UA8D1E,"Pleasantly surprised!  Just caught this Bradley Cooper Indie on V.O.D. and was impressed.  Smart dialogue and nuanced, well rounded characters.  If you are looking for Hollywood sheen and polish, you won't find it here.  Lots of laughs blended with poignancy and cool Carny flashbacks.  Like most smaller films, it is not without its flaw.  But it definitely wins you over with Smart's and Cooper's ineffable charm",1307318400,,414,5.196969696969697

4466640,1,B004UA8D1E,"I am a Bradley Cooper fan and independent film buff and overlook a lot of issues in the way of production quality in order to pay attention to the heart of a story.  However, it is not possible to either appreciate Bradley Cooper or the plot of this particular movie that is disjointed, not logical, nonsensical, and worst of all, lacking in any decent verbage.  The sound quality is absolutely horrendous.  Forget the lack of plot and terrible sex scenes (in one scene Bradley Cooper's foot is firmly planted on a woman's ear), the worst thing is the straining to hear the actor's voices. The one good thing it does do is make you appreciate most other films you might happen to watch.  The price I paid for this supposed movie is regrettable because it means I paid for a mistake. Bradley Cooper should use his clout and connections and get someone with money to burn to bury this particular film of his and likeise, Amazon should not offend their customers with charging for the viewing of this film. Caveat Emptor!",1307232000,29,1018,4.607734806629834
4466641,1,B004UA8D1E,"Spoiler Alert!!!
Okay, this movie was made awhile back before Bradley Cooper was the current hot shot he is today. I love him. This is NOT a Bradley Cooper gets the girl movie!!! He is one of the two guys going after the main chic in this flick. I'm a big movie goer/watcher yet I know that I don't know all that goes into a movie. But I do know this... this was a cheap movie. The acting is bad. The music, horrible! And the only thing that would make the plot tolerable is if one of the men actually got the girl in the end. Sorry!!! I was excited when I saw a Bradley Cooper movie listed on my Amazon Video on Demand. I hadn't heard of it??? I looked it up on the best website out there, IMDb. Not a whole lot there. In fact at the time, there wasn't even one rating. But the trailer was there. So, I watched it. Hmmm, I thought? Looks pretty good. Looks funny. Well of course, the only good parts are shown in the trailer. I know I sound harsh. I'm sorry. Believe it or not, I give most movies a pretty good rating. Really! And no offense to Bradley Cooper, because, yes, I do love you!!! But I believe this movie was only released on DVD because he's a star now. If you haven't seen LIMITLESS, you must. It's amazing!!! So, just to sum this up, please don't waste your time and money watching this movie... you don't even get to see a bare butt :)",1307145600,6,1352,4.086466165413534

Was it magnificent, by no means, but what do you expect from a B movie. I thought the sex scene was over all hot, but at some points hilarious, which I think was the point. I know a few people said it was stupid, but it was not meant to be taken seriously. The movie is fun if you can let go of your A list standard and just sit back and enjoy. It's very sweet and enjoyable. The sound quality is not that great and some of the scenes seem a bit out of place, but again, it's just supposed to be a fun movie.",1440288000,,630,3.891472868217054

I'm a big fan of chick flicks, but really this is the WORST MOVIE EVER! I saw the cover and thought oh Bradley Cooper in a chick flick, this sounds fun, but NOT!! First it says that was a 2011 movie but then I found that it was film on 2002 but really seems like a 1982 movie made by kids. I don't even know how to start describing, there's no story, sound is terrible, acting.. oh my God! bad bad bad. The actress, OMG, really who think that she can act? all is terrible! First 10 minutes I just want to turn it off but I said ok maybe something good is going to happen, but NOT!
I never write reviews but I think that this stupid movie deserve it.

1.  The acting is so bad in this movie that it makes the cast of Days of Our Lives look like Academy Award winners.
2.  It looks and sounds like they borrowed my parent's 80's camcorder to make this movie.
3.  PLOT?!!!  From beginning to end, I had the same question:  ""huh?""

The only enjoyable part of the entire movie is seeing Bradley Cooper's gorgeous face.  Everything else sucks.  Please rent this movie before you buy it so you don't make the same mistake I did.  I paid 9 bucks for this crap.",1329696000,,732,4.294117647058823

Lame and stupid.  I can't believe this script got made into a movie!!!!",1319500800,,167,4.32258064516129
4466669,1,B004UA8D1E,"This viewer falls into the category of most of those who have written a response to this film - it is just simply feeble. Clue: the film was written and directed by two people Peter Knight and Morgan Klein and the hodgepodge of collaboration shows. Couple the bad script with a cast of amateurs (Note: this was WAY before Bradley Cooper had been transformed into a box office sensation - both acting wise and physique-wise) and the result is a film that should have been left in the can.

Nerdy Kenna (Colleen Porch) is simultaneously dating two guys - DJ Jeff (Bradley Cooper) and Businessman Martin (David Gail). It is an open relationship in that both men know Kenna's proclivities, that she has no intention of settling down, being a hedonist - apparently related to her Carnival background: her father Mortie (Kurt McKinney) is a carny man whose preoccupied with bad mouthing Kenna's mother. None of that information really fits into the story despite the fact that a lot of screen time is devoted to the carny aspect.  Needless to say the three way relationship can't last and how it resolves is the remainder of the story - if you can make it through this mess long enough to see the fuzzy ending.

The sad aspect of seeing this film is the reminder of the many, many really fine Indie films of quality that never make it to the public.  Money backing must be the only answer, though it would seem that finding backers for this cheesy film would have been a supreme challenge.

4466670,1,B004UA8D1E,"I've never written a review for a movie before, but upon wasting an evening watching, ""Bending All the Rules,"" I felt it my obligation to warn others. This movie's plot was not at all concise. It just dragged on and on. There was apparently NO EDITING! Nothing at all must have made it to the cutting room floor. Poorly-recorded dialog from dozens of inconsequential characters failed to propel the plot and just wasted valuable time. I had just seen Bradley Cooper in ""Limitless,"" and expected a movie of close calibre. I like indie films too, but ""Bending All the Rules"" (filmed in 2002) wasn't even up to par with a student film. The leading lady Colleen Porch was bland and intolerable. I actually think Cooper and David Gail's (the other lead guy) acting was acceptable, given the terrible scripts they were given; however, the movie was poorly written, poorly filmed and poorly edited. I was embarrassed for Cooper during the ""sex"" scene because of his laughable facial expressions and the way it was shot. He must have died of shame when he watched the final product. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE!

(And since I mentioned the name, ""David Gail,"" if you want an intelligent, tight, intense plot with twists and a mind-blowing ending, check out the movie, ""The Life of David Gale,"" (2003) starring Kate Winslet, Kevin Spacey, Laura Linney.

I am sorry, because I know there are some fans of the leading man out there, but he stunk also.  Some of the scenes are very fast while others drag on.  PICTURE A MOVIE WHERE ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE THEATER WALK OUT BECAUSE IT IS SO BAD THAT THERE IS NO STINKING WAY YOU WOULD EVER GET $7.50 WORTH OF ENJOYMENT.  I'D PAY THE SAME NOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE!  I would not reccomend renting the DVD either, and it definitely is not worth the dollar spent, or the two dollars extra because you didn't watch it right away. This well could be the worst movie I have ever seen.  Whoever wrote this should be banned from writing forever, and the actress is almost as awful, her performance is flat.

I love Bradley Cooper and really wanted to like this movie, but it looks like a bad student film shot by some friends in college. Very drunk friends. Horrible lighting, no music so it's very dry (yes, the dry feel of a bad porn film with echoy audio and horrible lighting) and the acting and script? ugh... wooden and depressing.

The lead actress WOW her acting skills = there aren't any - monotone, negative, bland, and the actress who plays her mother is even worse. Bradley and the other guy chasing her try to do what they can with the bad material, but if you haven't seen it yet, save your money.

4466681,1,B004UA8D1E,"I am a sucker for a romantic comedy. Over the past few decades I have sat through a lot of garbage just to get to the cheap thrill of a satisfying ending - doesn't have to be neat and tidy - just satisfying. I love them all from the hokey Beach Blanket Bingo to the wonderful Crazy Stupid Love. I even watch ABC's Bachelor/Bachelorette, which is surely the king of all that's cheap thrills romance. Well, I've met my match with Bending All the Rules. Finally, a rom com that even this rom-com sucker couldn't stomach. It's really that bad.

If you're thinking that watching a younger Bradley Cooper is worth it - think again. Rent Wedding Crashers for a sweet love story AND loads of laughs. Even if you've watched Wedding Crashers 10x, you'll still get more laughs and find more surprises than you'll find in this stinker plus get to catch Brad after he's had a few years of acting practice.

SPOILER - And worst of all, worst of all ... the ending is horrible. Someone forgot to follow the rom com formula but is still marketing it as one. I fast forwarded just to find out who ""Kenna"" winds up with and of course, no one. Come to think of it, she's not really that likeable (sorry to her mom) so guess I shouldn't have been surprised.

4466684,1,B004UA8D1E,"So I did not have a choice on whether to rent this as I was on vacation with friends who had rented it. Usually I'm very bad at judging a movie by its title name, but this is probably the one instance where my gut instinct was spot on. The movie is slow throughout, from beginning to end. I felt myself wanting to fall asleep the entire time. I remember getting up to take a shower toward the middle and coming back to have my friends tell me I missed a marathon of raunchy sex scenes, to which I jokingly said they'd be the only ones in the movie (and I was right).
The main character's script seems forced. She narrates the entire movie in her brooding monotone voice, as if I'm supposed to believe she's got any depth or intelligence. I totally was annoyed with her the entire time. Maybe I'm being cruel but I was seriously hoping one of the guys would accidentally punch her in the face in the final bar fight scene.
I'm amazed this movie is even classified as a Comedy, let alone a romantic one, seeing as there are only two remotely funny scenes in the entire film and even then these two scenes only produced a brief single chuckle.
I think the only thing comedic about this is that the directors wasted so much money on this film just to have it be exactly what people use toilet paper for after they do their business.
I'd avoid at all costs but if you are the weird sadistic type and for some reason want to actually see this movie, I'd suggest only getting it from Redbox. I wouldn't even waste Internet Bandwidth to torrent or Netflix this smut.",1309824000,8,1558,4.302721088435374

The leading lady makes Denise Richards look like she has depth. She makes Carrot Top seem like he could win an Oscar. And she makes the muppets look like they're articulate. The entire movie is dubbed, and to call it poorly done would be praising it. It's done so badly, that at one point I wondered if some freak accident happened to the reels and they were forced to dub sound over at the last minute on 5 dollars, on one take. Honestly, every person in this movie is terrible, including Bradley Cooper, which hurts me strictly because of Wet, Hot American Summer. Anyone that gave this review positive marks had to have been in it, and shameless.",1309132800,2,786,4.503496503496503

4466693,1,B004UA8D1E,This is a terrible movie. It seems as it though it was shot by a group of teenagers by a made at home camera. The acting is horrendous and the storyline.......what is worst word for horrendous? Video and audio quality: 0 Stars,1308787200,7,226,4.404761904761905
4466694,2,B004UA8D1E,"I can't exactly say I didn't like it and give it 2 stars. It did have it's places where it was ok.  But to say that I liked it and give it 3 stars is a bit of a stretch.  (Is there a 2 1/2?) You can tell that it was a cheaply made film.  Most of the acting isn't great.  In fact most of the acting it's a stretch to say it's ok.  Bradley Cooper's acting has come a long way.  (Does anyone know exactly when this movie was made?) My brain was having trouble wrapping around the fact that this is the same guy that is in The Hangover movies and Limitless. I've never heard of any of the other people in the movie.  Now if you are a Bradley Cooper fan and don't care about the acting and just go on his smokin' hot looks.......it's not bad from the drooling stand point.  He is pretty darn cute even with the lighter hair.  In fact his looks are probably about the best thing this movie has going for it.

My personal opinion and strictly that, is the people behind this movie are trying to cash in on Bradley Cooper's success.  Too bad because I'm not exactly sure this film should have come out of the basement.  And that's coming from a Bradley Cooper fan that likes both his acting and looks and is pretty much ok with most anything of his I've seen.  I even found All About Steve to be a cute movie.  Not great but cute.  Bending All The Rules..............yeah, should have been left in the basement.",1308700800,4,1403,4.125461254612546

4466696,4,B004UA8D1E,"Smart, small-budget, dialogue-driven vehicle that takes you on a cool, kinetic ride. Grainy, gritty carny flashbacks reveal the depth of an emotionally-scarred lead female character, Kenna, as she tries to keep her distance from two boyfriends. Couple of weaker scenes in beginning had me teetering, but funny sex scene rejiggered me and film moves pretty seamlessly in the final third. Underrated film rolled out b/c of star-status of Bradley Cooper (great btw as conflicted radio DJ/bartender Jeff). Really more like 500 Days of Summer or She's Gotta Have It than a classic Romantic Comedy.",1308614400,,592,5.308510638297872
4466697,4,B004UA8D1E,"So easy to tell that Bradley Cooper was going to be a star from this early performance. It's an Indie film so lacks the polish of the big films, and some of the acting was only so-so, but enjoyed the story very much. If you are looking for something different, you will not be disappointed.",1308528000,,290,4.290909090909091
4466698,4,B004UA8D1E,"This is an Indie film , so not your typical Hollywood formula that wraps up in a happy ending.  The characters were realistic and flawed with out the flaws driving the plot of the movie. I almost expected one of the love interests to turn out to villainous to prompt a choice, but the movie isn't really about making a choice.
Some beautiful scenes of the Tampa Bay area.  And the inclusion of the carny element which is an undercurrent in Tampa provided some interesting characters and background for Kenna.
Definitely worth watching on VOD.",1308528000,,542,4.6947368421052635

I couldn't believe how badly the film was directed.  The acting was uneven, with some actors really failing miserably, and others, like Bradley Cooper, making an attempt, but with what to work with?  This is an absolutely horrible movie.  I'm sorry to say this, because Cooper is a fellow Philadelphian, and I usually enjoy his work.  But, find another of his films and pass this one by.",1458345600,,541,4.583333333333333
