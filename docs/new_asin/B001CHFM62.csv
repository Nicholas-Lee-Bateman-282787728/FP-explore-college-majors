3512304,5,B001CHFM62,My brother is a true fan of Ultraman and I had to get it for him as a gift. He LOVED it! the discs are separated in their own compartment and listed by episodes. Its fun to watch and the picture is crystal clear. He loves the entire series.,1232496000,,240,3.9183673469387754

There have been complaints on this site that some parts are in Japanese, but these parts were clipped from the original English dub making it impossible for them to be in English.  The people who made this are not trying to cheat you they are just giving it to you like it is or was or whatever.  Shuwatch!",1228608000,15,384,4.457142857142857

If you think all these American super hero is cool, you have not seen anything until you see Ultraman. But growing up in Japan would be entirely different than if you were to just grow up in America thinking this is just a made up Asian whatever film! You have to be in it spiritually, culturally, and historically to see the beauty and power of this film. This is THE number one, the MOST biggest, popular, famous action figure on our planet~!!!!!! I would LOVE to see Ultraman A, Ultraman Seven, and Return of Ultraman DVD BOX series ~!!! I may just go home to Japan and bring it to the USA. These are just CLASSIC. MUST HAVE. Watch it in Japanese, and all the Theme song HAS TO BE in ORIGINAL Japanese version which is 100 times better!!!!!",1224633600,4,823,4.456953642384106

The part numbers for each DVD are exactly the same. I was hoping that for this ""complete"" series, they would have resolved the licensing issue and released the entire set in English as was shown on American TV, but no such luck.  Scenes within a single episode randomly switch between English and Japanese. The begining and ending credits are in Japanese with English singing.  There should have been some indication in the promotion of this set that it was the same as the previously released DVD's.",1224460800,33,660,4.6239316239316235

3512310,4,B001CHFM62,"Seen on chanel 44 in Chicago in the 70's, this must have been a budget-priced fill for a lower-tier station to run during the after school hours. The show starts with a jazzy rocking theme song and then rolls through one adventure after another. Like all shows of this genre, they end in a fight with our hero and another guy in a rubber monster suit. What kept me glued as a kid were the story arcs that tied it together, and the always wonderful ""secret agencies"" that were a part of most of the Japanese sci-fi series (think Unicorn from Johnny Soko). Have not seen this set yet, I hope we get a decent copy and maybe some extras. If you are reading this review you probably are already familiar with the series. If not, if you like Johnny Soko or Space Giants check this one out. Also good for kids, but keep in mind in 1970's hero's smoked, women were not always allowed to kick a**, and it's dubbed- brutally so. Still a buy in my opinion.",1219104000,4,945,4.284916201117318

Glad I did-- discs are crap and last four eps don't play at all.
Grab the 2-volume set while it's still available!

3512366,3,B001CHFM62,"This review isn't for the series itself -- if you're a fan of kaiju movies, the craft that goes into them, and a little bit of '60s super-spy cheesiness, you'll enjoy it whether or not you saw it as a child.

The set has a number of issues, however. First, be aware that there's at least one print run with a major error on episode 8 (disc one) that prevents it from playing all the way through unless you fastforward over the the frame that triggers the error. I initially thought I may have had a bad set, so I requested a replacement from Amazon, but it contained the same issue. Currently contacting Mill Creek to figure out what's up.

Assuming you get a set without the major error, however, there are a number of niggling problems that are justifiable only for the super-budget price the set goes for. The video quality is soft, more so on some episodes than others, though no doubt this is the best they could get from Chaiyo due to their not having the original masters (run a search for the absurd and ongoing legal battle between Tsubaraya Productions and Chaiyo to find a rundown on why we're stuck with subpar video masters).

The real issue is the subtitle track, which plays noticeably late or early on a handful of episodes. There's some overly literal translation as well, and instances of simple mistakes like verbs not being correctly conjugated given their context. It's extremely amateurish work.

The DVD case is also the worst possible design -- four discs stacked atop of one another on a single spindle. Prepare to spend a little extra money on a leaflet case to transfer the discs into if you care about protecting them. There's no reason this type of case should exist.

At $8, it's worth a purchase for genre fans, provided the error with episode 8 is resolved. But there are a number of basic problems with the release that are honestly inexcusable for a professional product at any price, and customers should be aware of them.",1469145600,5,1957,4.595988538681948

Now my grandson - at age 7 - has gotten into the old Godzilla movies, so I introduced him to Ultraman!  Today's kids are used to more sophisticated special effects and animation, and he's not overly impressed with some of the model work in the set, but loves the monster fights and futuristic look of the ""Science Patrol's"" headquarters, despite the massive use of magnetic tape devices.  The recording quality of this DVD set is mediocre and can be quite grainy when viewed on an HD set, but is acceptable to my grandson.  I do like the fact that the ""added"" portions that weren't originally aired in the US are subtitled - although a bit too fast sometimes for the grandson to read.  It makes some of the plots much more understandable, and appeals more to me than the straight to the fight plots that characterized what I remembered about the show.

3512376,4,B001CHFM62,"The packaging is not great. There is no insert sheet to tell you which episodes are on which discs. Instead we get small printing on each disc listing the episodes (which have all been renamed) but at least they are all in the proper order. All 4 discs are held on one spindle on one side of the case. They are free to spin on top of each other. It's fine if you leave it on the shelf, but I wouldn't transport it anywhere in this case.

The episodes don't appear to have been remastered in any way. The audio and video look the same as it did when I was young. The video is scratchy, and at several points there is a low hum in the audio line. You can watch it in Japanese with English Subtitles, or you can turn on the English audio track.

The last disc has a 23 minute interview with the American voice cast. It seems to be recorded with a 1980's handheld camcorder. Shaky and bad quality but it's really nice to see it if you're a fan. The fact that they even added it tells you they cared about the product. It also has the American intro as a separate file. (The intro that plays with each episode is the original version.)

Overall, it's a good purchase and I don't regret buying it. Personally I think the audio/video imperfections make it a little better.

Note: I converted each episode to an MP4 file and loaded them into my Plex Media Server so I can watch them on my TVs, phones, tablets, PCs, and laptops whenever/wherever I want. If you do something like this (or if you backup your discs to ISO files incase they get scratched) it's good to know that the data label for each disc is: ULTRAMAN_DISC1, Disc 2, ULTRAMAN_DISC3, ULTRAMAN_DISC4.

3512393,2,B001CHFM62,"This series immediately took me back to my childhood. I was eager to purchase and rewatch the series. Here's some feedback after having finished the series.

1. I purchased this set from Amazon
2. I purchased the set at a reasonable price.
3. The Language setting quality on the set is not good. I would set to English only to have episodes switch to Japanese with subtitles and then back again throughout an episode.
4. The monsters are really silly.
5. The English versions of the stories are campy at best.  Plots are weak.
6. The video quality is okay
7. The specials is just an interview with the English voice actors. The interview video quality is low.
8. The voice sound quality is quiet and lacks a crispness.

For the price its not bad, but i would've loved a higher quality set.",1449532800,,789,4.503496503496503

Though the original show is a bit dated, and hails from a time when ongoing stories were rare and most stuff was completely settled within 1 or 2 episodes. It painfully shows sometimes with shows like these as the pacing in them makes marathons hard sometimes... they were clearly not meant to be watched more than once a day or once a week, at the most.

Still good shows, but marathoning them could ruin them for you.",1428451200,,452,4.5

By the man who came up with idea and creation of our favorite giant green city wrecking machine. But also the title character Ultraman himself,the late Eiji Tsuburaya. But thanks to him Japan and the world,was introduced to not only their greatest local superhero and an  international film icon. Before any of today's stars of the silver screen, were around and they became household names. In Japan  and abroad,and just last year the new Godzilla movie. Thrilling audiences worldwide,for a new generation of fans. And in Japan a new Ultraman series is on the rise which ,I hope they bring more of the classic and new Ultraman series.

3512459,5,B001CHFM62,"I have been debating to get this for a while, but I finally decided to buy it a few weeks before the 2014 Godzilla to see where Ultraman started.  The series is fun and cheesy, much like Godzilla was at the time, and I think it works.  Every episode revolves around the Science Patrol who go around with weapons to try and fight kaiju.  When they fail, Ultraman shows up to fight and kill them.  The only thing I don't like about this is that the fights are short, but the characters are cool.  Some of the coolest kaiju are Jirass, Red King, and Gomora.  Some of the monsters are suits from the Godzilla franchise.  Baragon is used frequently as different kaiju, and Godzilla is Jirass.

The DVD version is good, the discs are stacked on top of each other though.  There are a few cool special features on it and there is both English Language and Japanese with English subtitles.

Overall, I would recommend that you pick this up, it's a fun series and any Japanese monster movie fan will like it.",1421971200,3,999,4.409836065573771

3512508,5,B001CHFM62,"If you're a fan of Godzilla movies (particularly the showa ones) or Power Rangers, or if you just like campy monster movies in general, I invite you to give Ultraman a watch.

Ultraman is a show about a japanese team of scientists (the Science Patrol) that serve as the earth's defense against aliens and other monsters, as well as disasters of any kind. One day, a Science Patrol member named Hayata crashes his spacecraft into another vessel from the nebula M-78. Ultraman, an alien superhero in pursuit of a dangerous spacefaring monster, was in that craft. He offers his own life to save that of Hayata, and from then on Hayata may use Ultraman's Beta Capsule to transform into the colossal superhero. The catch is that his energy depletes rapidly in Earth's atmosphere, and if Ultraman doesn't revert back to Hayata's human form, he will ""never rise again."" Egad, what a premise.

Each episode generally follows the Science Patrol as they investigate some strange phenomenon, always ending in the appearance of a kaiju-sized monster that Ultraman has to fight. The monster costumes are awesomely campy, as are the special effects, and the plotlines are usually filled with little kid logic. I love it.

This show is intended for young children, but I found it to be extremely enjoyable, probably because I'm such a godzilla fan. It does have moments in which monsters bleed and lose body parts, but the special effects are very campy, so I doubt it would give any little kids nightmares.

In short this show is just plain fun, and I heartily recommend it to kaiju fans. If you're looking for a more mature viewing experience, however, I suggest watching Ultraman: Into the Future instead. It is a more serious take on Ultraman.",1397433600,,1732,4.841216216216216
3512509,4,B001CHFM62,What can I say? If the viewer can get past the fact that this was a budget show from 1966 then you should have no problems with it. However I must warn you that it does have some blood in it so if your are squeamish about what kids see then you should preview it first. I personally don't see a problem with it in this case. The dubbing is good to fair in most places. Though there were a few mistakes as the episodes go on and one time it switched to the Japanese track during the first episode for some reason. Like any long running tv show it has good episodes and very bad ones. Most are in the good to fair range.  I recommend it for children six and older or anyone who likes giant monsters.,1397433600,2,697,4.014388489208633

This collection is great because it the original soundtrack, english voice dub, and original Japanese dialogue.  It is the ENTIRE original ultraman series.  Watching this and comparing it to current filmmaking is a fun thing to do.  Whether you like how its made or not doesn't matter, this is a classic.

3512541,5,B001CHFM62,"Finding this set a such a great price is worth it,  there are so many positive things about the series generally. Seeing the infinite number of different monsters they had to come up with on a weekly basis, plus the ""suitmation"" acting as well as miniture set construction overseen by the master special effects artist Eji Tsurabaya. I know many people claim its cheesy or whatever, but when you take into consideration the schedule they had and the budget they were given, they worked wonders. A previous poster pointed out that they added deleted scenes that weren't dubbed in English on these discs, which explains a lot. What I have done when watching them is to go to the Main Menu and choose language English, but also enable English subtitles. Its extremely interesting to compare the subtitled original Japanese dialog, to the dubbed in English one. In some respects they do a good job and in others they miss the points entirely. So when they slip in the cut scenes without English, you still get whats going on Especially the monster names which they almost never mention in the dubbed versions, except to say "" the monster "". With the dual dubbed dialog and English subtitles the episodes make way more sense, and are far more enjoyable to watch in my opinion. It even works on the theme song which in Japanese is 2 verses but on the US distributed episodes was only 1.  So as you see the subtitled translated Japanese lyrics, they just play the English dubbed Ultraman theme twice. Overall, its a great collection, and would highly reccomend it to amyone who liked or likes the Japanes kaiju genre. Either you get it or you don't!",1384732800,,1642,4.678200692041522
3512542,4,B001CHFM62,"I liked the characters, stories and action scenes with Ultraman. But the rubber costumed monsters looked crappy and i hated that they recycled some of the costumes several times.

They would just modify it by adding tails, different textures, colors, feathers, and other attachments. Especially the Godzilla type monster design. You can tell by the basic design that it was the same one from previous episode.

Modern TV shows like Power Rangers, Beatle Borg were inspired by Ultraman, but Ultraman can kick all their butts put together! His fighting style is a combination of wrestling, judo and street fighting. On top of that he doesn't need to shoot any guns or ""zwords"",  because he shoots lasers from his hands, create energy Shields and use telekinesis!

The science patrol team grew on me and i enjoyed their banter in each episode, they also became more effectual when they attacked monsters with more advanced weaponry. Hayata, (the human whom transforms into Ultraman ), was a very likable character, very confident, good sense of humor and was always trying to be supportive of his team.

Some episodes surprised me as the,monsters didn't always die the same way, and it wasn't always Ultraman that defeated them. There's even an episode where Ultraman shows mercy and helps a monster leave earth. He is a true heroe indeed.

The only reason i deducted one star is because the packaging is bad. The distributors compressed 39 episodes onto 4 DVD discs. The sound quality suffers and the visuals were a bit grainy. Also the English dub actors were terrible. So i prefer the English sub with Japanese audio.  But hey, its at budget price and im a new fan.

By the 13th episode, Ultraman also became a better fighter and i noticed he was more aggressive against the monsters. His laser blast, and other special effects have held up well in my opininon. I just got excited when he came into action. Great show!",1383782400,2,1918,4.844036697247707

After watching Ultraman Mebius, I decided to to watch the first series to see how it all began (Ultraman was the second in the series, Ultra Q being the first).
The product was just amazing. It contained all the thirty-nine episodes from Ultraman, with deleting scenes that were put into the episode. This causes it to switch from English to Japanese, however English subtitles to appear automatically when the deleted scenes are shown. Depending on the person, this can be a good thing or a bad thing. I for one consider it a good thing, because including the deleted scenes actually makes the episodes feel more complete, and give them more depth in story wise. The DVD collection also comes with the option to watch the series in Japanese, an interview the English voice cast, and a ""Kaiju encyclopedia.""
I cannot say that I grew up with Ultraman or even that I use to watch it when it was being aired, for the reason I was not born yet. Being as blunt and candid as possible, if you have grown up with Ultraman and enjoyed it, or even if your just a Kaiju fan wanting something new, pick this product up. Keep in mind that Ultraman was made in 1966-19677 so the special effects are the equivalent of the original (Showa) Godzilla series. Great for the family.",1363910400,,1393,4.466666666666667

I think it was the ""beta capsule"" that transformed a human into Ultraman, and sometimes his power supply would run low, and I'd pray that he survived. This series is classic Japanese monster movie type stuff; it's a must-have for lovers of this genre. I recommend this series for something totally different than what kids are accustomed to today.

Except I don't remember them being as funny as I find them to be now! Totally digging this. I am also loving the little extras that are included sprinkled through the episodes! You can tell the stuff that got cut because all of a sudden they will start speaking Japanese with subtitles at the bottom. It's great! It's cool to be able to see the full episodes how they were meant to be, FINALLY.

The quality of the discs is great too! Someone had mentioned in one of the other reviews about how ""the DVD wrecked their player because of poor quality discs"" or something to that nature.. I call BS. operator error for that dude. Don't put peanut butter on your DVD's man, and you'll be golden! :D These discs have a screen printed image on them, not some cheap sticker label. For the cost, I was expecting a much lower quality disc(s) and packaging. Easily a $30+ value in my opinion and I paid under $10.

Also, these DVDs all have the Japanese intros, not the ones that aired on American TV.

Not sure what the reasons were, or if I even got the order correct.  I enjoyed the quality of the Mill Creek set, especially liked the box cover.  The box sucked though, with the separate paper sleeves for each.  Really?  Need to save a few cents that way?  Plus, this set didn't have the booklet that came with the first set from BCI.  I have both and was eagerly looking forward to having the book, but no joy.  Since I had the original set, and someone gave me the set again as a gift, I gave away the second one becuase it didn't have the booklet and cards, and didn't like the box.

The quality of the discs appeared to be the same though.  Menus were set up different, but the playback quality and the subtitles all looked to be the same.  And of course you have the dubbed version available if you want it, and that was identical.

I'm not sure where the future of the Ultra series is headed in Japan, looks as if the fan base is waning over there.  And the quality of the shows and movies seems to be going down hill as well.  Does that mean we won't see any more over here in the states from the old stuff?  I hope not!  We just had the release of the Ultraseven series, and there are plenty of other shows for them to put out here.

3512603,2,B001CHFM62,"I got this for my 5 year old son, as a Christmas gift.  He has become nothing short of obsessed with the original Godzilla franchise, beginning with the 1954 release all the way up to the 2005 release of Godzilla - Final Wars.  I had shown him some of the Ultraman movies available on YouTube and he was quite taken. I figured the Complete Ultraman series would be yet another classic that he and I could enjoy together.

The discs arrived rather quickly, an accolade for the seller, but the product was far, far less than what I had expected - not the seller's fault as they simply offer a finished product.  I can't fathom what group of 8 year olds was assembled to provide an English audio track.  Literally almost every single episode, of the 39 episodes, has more than one section where the audio flips back to the original Japanese - even though the audio is very plainly set for English. Throughout one or two episodes, the audio actually flips back and forth between English and Japanese, from one scene to the next, all throughout the episode.  I'll admit, my Japanese is nothing short of horrific, so I have no idea what they're saying - only that something very grim and serious is taking place and everyone should be fearful.

Seriously, how hard would it have been for the people dubbing to have actually given their finished product a simple once-over to make sure the secondary audio is completely English and not a hodge-podge of languages?

Additionally, I would like to state that this product gets two stars because one star, according to Amazon's rating system, means 'I hate it,' which I do not.  Two stars is, apparently, an 'I don't like it' rating which, I feel, is somewhat more apt; though I feel two stars is one star too many in a real-world rating system.  I just wish the English dubbing ""team"" had done a better than lackluster job.

In closing, I would advise anyone (considering) purchasing this product, BE AWARE:  It will flip between Japanese and English as a VAST MAJORITY of the episodes progress.  If you can overlook this grotesque QC oversight, it's a great set of an historic television series to have and share with your little one(s).",1356998400,5,2178,4.640625

All of sudden my mind was takin back to my childhood and i could remember asking my asking my mom to put it on the T.V. When i was like 5 or 6 years old. Can't remember exactly but i Think it was on T.B.S.. I have not thought about Ultraman for decades. I jumped on Amazon and ordered the Complete series. It took my mind back to my childhood when i first put in the dvd . Amazing experience!!!! Even though the special effects are terrible for todays standards my 5 year old step son and my 13 year old step son love it. They want to watch it all the time. What a great find for the the Family minus mom (she hates it and almost anything else that is not on the wedding channel. LOL.). You can't beat the price either.

As great as this DVD release is, the video quality is hardly up to par, with episodes that look as though they've been transferred from a VHS source. The show's entire palette is washed out and varying patches of noise and other severe video degradation issues consistently bog down the print. The quality does improve somewhat as the series progresses.

An up-scaling DVD player or receiver, as in my case, is absolutely essential. Watching this series with the original Japanese track & English subs, is the way to go for the best experience. But for the older American fans seeking a dose of nostalgia, the English track may be your answer.

All in all this is a dirt cheap set, that's good clean fun for kids, & youngish tokusatsu fans, like myself.

You can tell the sets and props are miniatures.  You have the option of watching the shows in the original Japanese, with English subtitles, or watching the shows dubbed in English.  On the last video, there is an interview with the actors who voiced the old ""Speed Racer"" cartoon, who also did the dubbing for the English version of Ultraman.  It had been so long since I had seen this series, I really did not remember any of the episodes, other than just bits and pieces.

3512623,5,B001CHFM62,"I first want to say I've seen a number of complaints regarding the packaging of this set. The complaints aren't totally unwarranted but complaining about that aspect of the set misses the point. And with that said, the packaging really isn't terrible, just a little sloppier than it could have been. The chief complaint being the disks themselves are inside paper disk holders that are loose inside the case. I've never seen a set of DVD's this way and it's not the best way to store them but they should be fine if the set is handled with decent care. There is also no booklet or literature which would have been welcomed for sure. The outer case is attractive and solid enough to avoid any criticism and will look nice on a shelf alone or with your other DVD's.
  The set includes all the episodes in chronological order including the origin episode that explains Hiyata's relationship with Ultraman and the seldom seen (on tv) final episode that wraps everything up, albeit too soon for many of us fans.
  There have also been complaints about the audio that I feel are uncalled for. The issue comes during the English dub when suddenly they are no longer speaking English but Japanese. These interludes are brief and happen solely because they have included footage that wasn't seen on English broadcasts and therefore never had an English dub made. I personally love that they included the footage even when they didn't have accompanying audio. It shows they gave us everything they could and from what I have read, it wasn't an easy task.
  In addition to many legal issues preventing a proper and comprehensive set being release before there have also been problems with finding acceptable and complete footage. This is the most complete set you'll find. When I discovered this set I was just thrilled to see it available.

  Almost every episode is the same.  Giant monster (or alien who can transform into a giant) appears, the heroes of the Science Patrol and the military fail to stop it, lead hero uses his Beta capsule to transform into the giant super hero Ultra Man, who fist fights the monster until the warning light located on his chest starts to beep and the narrator warns that if the light goes off Ultraman will never rise again, Ultraman then crosses his hands sending a blast that destroys the monster.  Ultraman then files off into the sunset. And so it goes episode after episode.  Sometimes the build up to the monster's first appearence is different but in the long run the episodes rarely differ.

This is a show that has to be taken in small doses in order to be enjoyed  and will only appeal to adults who have fond memories of it from their youth.  Today's jade youth so use to seeing CGI effects may be bored by the cheezee monster suits (a redressed old Godzilla costume shows up in one episode) worn by the stuntmen and the dated model work.  A very interesting thing about Ultraman is that it is one of the very first TV shows that I was exposed to that had a definite beginning and an end.

As to the collection itself these appear to be unedited episodes of the show.  The theme song last longer than I remember and has more verses to it.  Also the dubbing kicks out at times and subtitles are used.  I have no way to prove this but I suspect that when the series was first dubbed for American release the episodes were edited down for more commericals and the portions not used were not dubbed. For this release of the unedited episodes subtitles are used for the undubbed moments. So for Ultraman fan out there (and I do know that they are out there)he is sure to get his money's worth with this collection.",1300233600,3,2066,4.369109947643979

3512656,5,B001CHFM62,"""Ultraman: The Complete Series"" was a great find for me since I loved the show growing up in the late '60s, early '70s and wanted to share this with my family.

This was an amazing series from Japan that featured a pseudo-military organization known as the ""Science Patrol"" that utilized the coolest equipment and weapons to fight giant monsters that seemed to only want to terrorized Japan (I would have moved after the 2nd or 3rd one showed up). It also really isn't clear how the orange and white jumpsuited Science Patrol team handled these giant monsters before one of their members became a shared entity with an equally giant monster fighting hero, but that is only a thought that occurred to me in the clarity of age :-) Also, while the rubber suited monsters, special effects, and plots are often almost laughable by today's standards, they truly amazed and enthralled me back then and still ""work"" for me from a reminiscing standpoint.

It is wonderful to have the whole series on DVD and I really enjoyed seeing scenes that had been cut from the US broadcast (included with subtitles since they were never voiced over in English).

Highly Recommended!

I have to say it's like watching a more smaller version of Godzilla battling monsters. The one thing I was puzzled by was there were subtitled scenes at some points throughout the episode. At times I thought maybe it had switched to the subtitled track which was not the case. It was all in the American editing of the show. Basically all the scenes that have Japanese language with English subtitling is just the full uncut episodes fully restored and those scenes were never in english to begin with. So that clears that up. If you enjoy Japanese sci-fi like I do besides Godzilla, Gamera, Mothra, and the like you will enjoy Ultraman. It's a pretty decent series.

There are some formatting issues- there will be scenes in Japanese with subtitles scattered here and there, but the majority is in English.  It's pure cheesiness with guys in rubber suits and has a strange sense of humor.  But overall, this is a super deal at this super low price.

3512659,5,B001CHFM62,"I bought the complete series for my 7-year-old son after picking up the Season 1 DVD at Target. Both he and my 4-year-old son love the show and watch it often. I watched Ultraman as a kid in the 70s when it ran on afternoon after school TV on the local independent station, so I was pretty sure my kids would enjoy it as much as I did. The series is really just two long seasons, 39 episodes in total. The picture quality, dubs and the optional sub-titles are very good. The viewer can choose between English language version or Japanese language version. My kids watch both and they have even learned the Ultraman theme song in Japanese! If you are a fan of early Godzilla features then you will love Ultraman.

It's about what you would expect from a 1960s Japanese giant monster feature. The monsters that Ultraman battles are as fake looking as those found in Godzilla movies, but that is part of the fun! The Science Patrol is made up of a team of investigators who seek out monsters that threaten the Earth, especially Japan. They have amazing laser weapons and V/TOL aircraft that usually only succeed in angering the monsters but not killing them. Ultraman always comes to their rescue to defeat the monsters in the end. The team car is a Chevrolet Corvair. I suppose the Corvair looked futuristic at the time and the series is supposed to be set in the future.

My favorite character is the lone female on the team, ""Fuji."" She is a petite beauty that was the object of my affection when I was a 10-year-old kid and after seeing her on video for the first time in 30 years, I remember why. The producers usually shove her to the background of the stories (""Fuji, you stay here by the radio while we go after the monster"") but occasionally, they build entire episodes around her and they don't disappoint. In episode 14, ""The Pearl Oyster Defense Directive,"" the producers went out of their way to showcase her beauty. We get to see Fuji in civilian clothes, dressed to the nines wearing jewelry and looking like a fashion model. Another episode shows her in a form-fitting scuba suit. But it's all very innocent and harmless.

In summary, Ultraman the Complete Series is good nostalgic fun that your kids will love and you can't beat the price.",1296518400,,2253,4.558024691358025

3512662,5,B001CHFM62,I have finally been able to enjoy watching Ultraman with a clear picture; and the episodes are really entertaining - even now that I am an adult. I notice that the director tried to use unusual camera angles and crazy lense effects which keeps things interesting. The stories really have heart and the folks that translated the dialogue into English had a good sense of humor. I wonder if the Japanese voices are the originals. They don't seem to fit the characters at all. And I wonder if the additional scenes in Japanese are all that there was to find. When I watch almost every episode it seems like there are intermediate scenes missing. Things happen that don't have any explanation or back story. Things don't seem to flow and the film often gives a little jump when a scene starts - like an editor cut something out. The director seems to have taken such care with his product that I can't imagine this is the way it was originally.,1295481600,,940,4.535294117647059

Non-standard, sure, but the discs do stay in place and the packaging is still sturdy and sound.  Some people also complain about the few non-English scenes; all they've done is insert a few deleted scenes that were never dubbed into English because they got cut the first time.  They only pop up once in a while and aren't a big deal.  And considering the low quality---both picture and sound---of the original show, the quality of this set is pretty darn good!

I can confirm this set has both the English and Japanese version of the theme song.  Like some other reviewers I had chills the first time I heard the English theme for the first time after so many years.

There are some issues with the English/Japensese.  If you are watching in English every once in awhile it will switch to Japanese for a few seconds.  A few of the episodes will play the Japanese theme song even if you have English selected.  This is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

I find it interesting to watch in Japanese language with English subtitles.  The dialogue is quite different.  Ultraman seemed to be more of a badass in Japanese. Compare the scene in the first episode when Ultraman first crashes on Earth and is talking with Hayata.  It made me laugh.

I have not as yet made it through all 4 discs but have really enjoyed watching this so far.  Admittedly, it does not keep me glued to the TV like it did when I was a kid.  I hope my son will enjoy this after he gets a bit older.",1291420800,3,1180,4.1866666666666665
3512674,5,B001CHFM62,"As someone born shortly after the show finished, I saw the episodes as a child in syndication in Detroit in the late 70's on WXON (TV 20). I have observed various incarnations of the ""complete"" series both here and on various other web sites, but never at less than $10. When I saw this box set, I knew I had to add it to my order.

My review:

Packaging: The four DVD set comes in a single plastic case, the four DVDs inside are protected from scratches by being further packaged in CD envelopes (I actually like and appreciate this!). The case did arrive to me (all the way in Afghanistan) with a corner cracked (no DVDs were damaged). One hit to Amazon for a crushed box that had no filler inside (popcorn or airbags).

DVDs: The 39 episode series is from the mid-to-late 60's, so I expected very little quality increase from the episodes available on YouTube. I was surprised to find the quality of this set was actually excellent! The main menu features the title song (in Japanese) and a short clip of Ultraman. You can change the available languages from Japanese (default) to English. The final DVD has bonus interviews with the dub & voiceover actors and a nice slideshow of the monsters.

The episodes are shown in their entirety. This means that when certain scenes were clipped in the U.S. dubbed version, they appear in the episode (not dubbed, but in Japanese with English subtitles). This is where some people are not happy with the series. I did not mind it at all, as it happens very infrequently. I do remember, however, that some of the scenes were actually dubbed and I viewed them as a child on TV. I don't know what happened to the dubbed scenes, but I am still happy with the final product.

At less than $10, how can you go wrong? The episodes are all here and now I am interested in seeing the ""other"" Ultraman series available at Amazon.",1288828800,28,1863,4.48377581120944

These shows are FANTASTIC, I'm sure they were fun at the time, but so many years later, and through the filter of subtitles (you must watch these with the original Japanese dialog!) they are impossibly great!

Exciting, imaginative stories with monsters and the heroic Space Patrol team plus the cheapest special effects possible from the era before computer graphics ruined everyone's appetite -- these shows are to be LOVED! From the cheesy theme song to the inevitable appearance of Ultraman (and the vanquishing of the monster), every single second is thoroughly enjoyable.

It's the kind of entertainment that could not be created today. People are too cynical. Special effects are too slick. No one makes models anymore. No one pulls on a rubber monster suit and crushes a skyline. There are no cool Space Patrol type of heroes who leap into their extremely cool silver VTOL ship to battle evil.

I guess this is a more innocent version of Power Rangers. Without spliced-in English-speaking substitutes for the original heroes in the series. It's formulaic, but it's innocent and HONEST. I just love these shows. Truly entertaining, like nothing else I can think of.

Worth the price? Oh, my, yes, and then some -- twice or three times the price. You simply cannot find entertainment like this anywhere else. Highest possible rating!

When that swirly paint effect came on Saturday mornings, that's when I knew Ultraman was about to start! I had no idea it was such a cheesy show. It makes sense, though. A kids show put together by Japanese men who thought like kids, especially, Eiji Subaraya. He's the same guy who did the special effects for Godzilla. A big shocker came in one of the episodes where a special appearance is made by an old famous monster who got prepped to look like a different creature when in fact there's no mistaking who it is! I'm not giving it away! You just have to watch for yourself. Oh, yeah! It's easy to see that monster suits were recycled to look like different monsters in other episodes. Isn't it crazy all the stuff that just flew over my head as a kid? It's cheesy, special effects weren't that great, and story lines made no sense every week.

If you have children this is the perfect opportunity to show them a series with substance that inspires thought and creativity instead of the nonsense that is aired these days.

However, having said that, I am a little disappointed in these last two DVD releases (this one and the 2006 release) for a couple of key reasons:

First off, not all of the dubbed English is present.  It is not because it doesn't exist anymore; in 1996 a video tape was released to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the show.  It was labeled Vol. 1 and contained the first four episodes.

When I first watched the DVDs I realized that dialogue spoken in Japanese was definitely aired with an English dub.  I compared a couple of scenes with the videotape and those scenes were definitely aired in English.

I think what has happened with these DVD releases is that they reflect copyright and distribution battles between companies.  This is why it took so long to release the series in the first place.  The research was sloppy and hurried.  With more time and care invested I think they could have incorporated most of the missing English.  It is definitely available since various versions of the series have existed in one form or another throughout the years.

The other thing that bothers me is that they used the Japanese opening credits instead of the English version.  This is an American release intended to be purchased and viewed by Americans.  The show has always been available in Japan but here in the United States children saw English titles.

For me personally, the credits and theme songs are just as important as the contents of the show in order to recreate the original experience of having watched these shows as a kid back in the early '70s.

Overall, it is wonderful that the series has finally been released in the United States.  If you loved this show you will love watching these discs.

I just wish that someone would release Ultraman, Space Giants and Johnny Sokko as they were presented on American TV with all English dubbing intact and all opening/closing credits (and themes) intact.

If you are fortunate enough to speak and understand Japanese you could have bought imports of the show all along in their native environments but the opening credits and theme songs that we have come to know are different and should have been preserved for an American release.",1258588800,38,2527,4.726027397260274

You love it and you know you want it, plus the price is unbeatable!!

3512704,5,B001CHFM62,"I used to watch Ultraman religiously as a kid, and was thrilled to see the complete collection release, at such an unbelievably low price too! I have two kids, 13 and 10 and was so excited to show them this. They loved it! It's campy fun, with the most insane collection of giant Japanese monsters. You know, sometimes things I remember as a kid either didn't age well or are just not as good as I remember. Not with Ultraman. It's fun, fun, fun and as good as I remember. Well worth a lot more than it cost, and not just for the fond memories!",1257984000,3,544,4.190476190476191

3512706,5,B001CHFM62,"ULTRAMAN was a 1960s TV series produced in Japan, and then syndicated for re-run in America in the 1970s. (With voices dubbed into English). The creative combination of live action and scaled-down model special effects, and the cuteness of the big rubber suit monsters makes this show perfect for ages 5-10 to enjoy. And still enjoyable for those of us who were that age when ULTRAMAN was airing on some US stations in the '70s.

""The Science Patrol"" are a uniformed group of men and women in Tokyo who stay vigilant about any monsters appearing (happens a lot o'er there) and when the threat is something gigantic, and the military tanks and jets can't defeat it, one of the officers secretly uses a hand-held ""beta capsule"" to transform himself into ULTRAMAN, becoming giant sized himself, costumed in silver and red, and then he wrestles the monster(s).

Episode One explains how he received that device and special power.

One of the best episodes is about children who draw monsters with chalk on concrete and the monsters magically come to life overnight, whereby prompting the Science Patrol to monitor what the school children are drawing.

Another memorable episode is about a cavern where a sleeping monster awakens, causing earthquakes, and the Science Patrol's kid mascot gets lost underground.",1256860800,3,1306,5.032407407407407
3512707,2,B001CHFM62,"This product was very reasonably priced, but the ediiting was not very good. The video would often switch from English language to Japanese and there is no way of changing it. The video was fairly good for footage of that era.",1256515200,6,226,4.536585365853658
3512708,5,B001CHFM62,"My family has an Ultraman movie night every saturday night! When my wife and I were children we never missed an episode of Ultraman. I often wished that I could share that rush of excitement watching my favorite superhero with my little girl. I found Ultraman here and anxiously awaited its arrival. My daughter loved it as much as my wife and I did! Now we can't wait for the weekend! We gather our snacks, load up  the dvd and watch another episode of our favorite superhero save the day! We have a blast! I recommend this dvd to all. There are only two small problem, some moments that the dubbing reverts to japanese,and the english dub dosen't always match the subtitles. But, if you don't mind these problems, and you miss all the campy effects of old, then you will love this as much as my family does.",1256428800,5,809,4.429530201342282
3512709,5,B001CHFM62,"This review is for the Complete Series 4 DVD set released in 2009, not the 6 DVD set released in 2008.  Since this is my first Ultraman DVD set, I am not sure if the quality suffers be squeezing all episodes from 6 DVDs to 4 DVDs.

The DVD case is a double-wide DVD case, but there are no spindles/holders.  The 4 DVDs are each put in a black paper sleeve and are stacked on top of each other.  The sleeves don't move around because they are ""held"" in place by a square shaped molding on the inside of the DVD case.

I was very surprised by this packaging because I have dozens of DVD television sets and have never seen a set packaged like this.  For the price (I paid $10.99 free shipping), I am okay with it, but just be prepared that is a bare-bones budget set.

5 stars for the show, 3 stars for the packaging.",1254873600,81,815,4.088050314465409
3512710,5,B001CHFM62,"First things first...I've seen some of the audio comments (English dubbing intercut with Japanese subtitles) made for this release and the one back in 2006.  Think of your favorite syndicated show.  You know having watched the original that some scenes get cut in syndication.  Now, think of Ultraman in that same vein, only it was already in ""syndication"" when it reached our shores way back.  So, when the complete, original episodes are released on DVD, they include original, Japanese-only scenes which WERE NEVER DUBBED IN ENGLISH.  However, to be a complete episode, they are still inlcuded.

Now, on with the review.  After occasionally catching a Power Ranger show a few years back, I knew that I would need to steer my young son clear of this influence (the kids are always fighting and sarcastic with each other.)  Anyway, my comment in seeing the ""power"" rangers would be, ""Ultraman could defeat these guys.""  My boy became curious as to who I was talking about, and when the Ultraman DVDs were released back in 2006, I was able to show him.

Talk about the memories that this show rekindles.  The first time the show's theme song began to play, I got chills.  I was immediately taken back to my grandmother's house in rural Pennsylvania (we didn't get Ultraman in Texas in the '70s.)  I watched a few episodes with my son and I could still recall some of the details in the story line that I hadn't seen for thirty years.  Over time, I have managed to find Ultraman action figures that my son loves, and even a beta capsule that makes the familiar sound.

I bought this latest release because over the three years, nephews have managed to scratch the older DVDs.  Now, each one will have their own set for Christmas (hard to beat at this price.)

If you remember Ultraman as he was, your memory will probably be stirred by this set.  If you are new to the original Ultraman, you'll have to dial back your current expectation level of special effects and sound quality, but hopefully you will still be able to appreciate the presentation of how things were in the almost forty years ago.

I used this series to springboard my son's exposure to the Godzilla movies of the '60s and '70s.  Enjoy.",1254700800,180,2204,4.660621761658031
3512711,3,B001CHFM62,"I used to watch the Science Patrol and Ultraman when I was a kid. When I saw this DVD set I had to order it for a walk down memory lane. Of course this is 1960's special effects and it's really cheesy but it was nice to ""go back"" and see TV from my youth. There are technical issues with the soundtrack on at least some of the DVD's. At the main DVD menu you can go to the audio menu and choose the language, either Japanese, Japanese with English subtitles or the original English dub over. I chose the original English dub over but there are times when watching the DVD's when the audio suddenly changes to Japanese with English subtitles then goes back to the original English dub over after a few minutes. Not sure what's up with that but it's a distraction. As I mentioned I have not watched all the DVD's yet but the audio problem has been on two DVD's (so far). There is also some popping noises on some of the episodes I've watched that are slightly annoying but hey it is 45 year old audio.",1254009600,10,999,4.208333333333333
