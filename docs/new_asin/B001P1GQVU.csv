8331808,4,B001P1GQVU,"my new tablas are somewhere out the the high seas. while I'm waiting for them to arrive I bought this dvd. it got here like rocket fast. it's for intermediate thru expert and there's nothing about how to tune them or maintain them. but it's a very good teaching tool if you're drumming inclined. the teacher is a very fine young Indian (?) gentleman who has a vocal language that describes each set of rythems. he gets to hyper-speed as he mouths out the sounds! well I'm not young and don't plan to play that fast or necessarily mouth out anything but I learned a lot and plan to re-watch it. meantime I found a place in Santa Cruz, Ca called the Drum Doctor who repairs and fine tunes tablas. I guess they have to be very finely tuned and I'm not sure how. peace..",1457913600,,766,4.289655172413793
8331809,2,B001P1GQVU,Not detail enough for a newbie to understand or learn. This DVD looks like just a demo on Raga-Thala. It is better if the demonstrator showed the position of fingers and characteristics of sounds created in more detail.,1376352000,,219,4.7894736842105265
8331810,4,B001P1GQVU,This DVD teaches alot of advanced patterns. Great DVD for someone who already has the basics down. It was still interesting to watch and dream to obtain that skill level.,1369785600,,170,4.7
