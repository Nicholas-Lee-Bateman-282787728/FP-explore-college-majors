(This little penny is to wish on, to dream on, to dance on, to laugh on and to love on <<sigh>>) I do wish you could get the soundtrack on cd!!
This is one of those movies that are timeless in their magic to move you so much.....",995414400,2,366,3.7662337662337664
468813,5,6302477379,"Although not totally accurate as far as who played in who's band, nevertheless a great story with even greater entertainment. I was in my twentys when I saw this movie. I have the original (very scratched) vinal soundtrack, and oh how I wish they'd release it on CD. Certainly alot of great memories here especially the tunes with Kaye and Louis Aarmstrong. This is a real family favorite. Wish we had this kind of entertainment at the movies these days. Thank God for VHS/DVD ....and maybe someday soon the CD as well? Enjoy!!!",982281600,4,528,4.688172043010753
468814,5,6302477379,"This movie shows Danny Kaye at his best.  Not only do we get to experience his signature comedy, but we also get to see another side of him.  This is a touching story about a father's love for his daughter and should be seen  by anyone who has ever known the kind of love where you would sacrifice  everything for the happiness of another.  This movie is far too neglected  in its recognition as a great film.",935712000,14,409,4.246753246753247

468924,5,6302477379,"As a music teacher elder, I've shown this movie over the years to my current students and they, just as I, love it.  Danny Kaye is a supreme talent and has been a favorite of mine since childhood (1940's and 50's).  Yes, today's crop of young people appreciate such ""oldies"" because of their quality...they know it when they see and experience it just as we did way back when!",1473292800,,376,4.434782608695652
468925,5,6302477379,This is one of my favorite movies! I love the history of big band and Dixieland music and that whole era.. Danny Kaye does an excellent performance and touches your heart.  I looked for a long time to find this movie. The music is the kind I remember my parents dancing to when I was young. Nice to watch and tap your foot.. The storyline shows the devotion of a loving father as well as a great musician.,1470787200,,405,4.1923076923076925

He sing,  dances makes us laugh and makes us cry.  His duet with Louis Armstrong still makes me laugh and tap my feet.  The whole cast is amazing.  I could never understand why this movie isn't more popular.  I give it as a gift to help spread the word.  If you like jazz and  Big Band music and like musical biographies,  get this movie about the amazing life of Red Nichols. Red Nichols plays the cornet for Danny Kaye in the movie and Louis Armstrong of course plays himself.  I still tear up after all these years!  If I could give The Five Pennies  10 stars,  I would!",1469491200,,706,4.3565891472868215

Now I bought it for my grand children, and the magic keeps going. Few of the new generation know Danny Kaye and even Louis Armstrong. This movie brings them together in the amazing story of Red Skelton.",1465171200,,335,4.508196721311475
468960,5,6302477379,"Love this movie.  Danny Kaye gets to combine his considerable dramatic talents with his comedic talents in this loosely-biographical account of cornet player Red Nichols.  One of the best things about this movie is the amazing song trilogy written by Sylvia Fine (established songwriter and wife of Danny Kaye).  The three songs, all beautiful by themselves -- ""The Five Pennies,"" ""Lullaby in Ragtime,"" and ""Good Night Sleep Tight"" -- were all constructed over the same chordal framework and could be sung simultaneously.  The song ""The Five Pennies"" received an Academy Award normination for best original song.",1464998400,,612,5.34375

469042,5,6302477379,"The Five Pennies is Hollywood's semi-biographical account of the career of Loring 'Red' Nichols.

This film provides a partly fictionalized account of Nichols rise to stardom and more factual account of his abrupt disappearance from the limelight, the result of a family illness.  Both comedic and poignant moments abound as the family copes first with life as itinerant musicians and later to overcome adversity.

In addition to the comedic brilliance of Danny Kaye, it features Barbara Del Geddes as Nichols wife, a young Tuesday Weld as his 13 year old daughter, Louis Armstrong and a host of talented musicians.  Of special note:'Red' Nichols plays cornet on the soundtrack and the duet between Louis and 'Red' is an incredible demonstration of cornet virtuosity.

Sadly, this gem is out of print.",1439337600,,801,5.178294573643411

469422,4,6302477379,"I do not know why Danny Kaye's more serious work is given short shrift by those who decide what will be available on DVD. (His movie ""Me and the Colonel"" has never been released.) Only his comedic work is generally available. While that is good, this little movie will tug at your heartstrings and make you feel good without Kaye hamming it up for the camera.

Short summary: Danny plays ""Red"" Nichols in a biographical film that is ""Hollywood""-ized. Nichols plays cornet and finally is achieving some success when tragedy strikes. His daughter with wife Bobbie (Barbara bel Geddes) develops polios. Feeling guilty, he quits music and moves family to L.A. for the weather. Laboring obscurely in a shipyard for years, his daughter begins encouraging him to resume his career after learning what he gave up to take care of her. Needless to say, he struggles to find his ""lip"" to play again, but does, eventually, come back to perform.

There's good music in it, with performances by Louis Armstrong highly noted. There is pathos and there is redemption, all in 117 minutes. What more could you ask for?",1395360000,,1100,4.814814814814815

469465,4,6302477379,"I'm a Danny Kaye fan, but was not aware of this movie. It's very much in the Glenn Miller/Benny Goodman musical biopic genre, but has plenty of Kaye's comedic sizzle. His nightclub pairings with Louis Armstrong are a joy to watch -- beautifully shot. The story runs a little long, but it's worth the view.

I had problems with the audio, particularly in the musical scenes where Kaye & Armstrong's voices seemed to be recorded separately and at different levels. Bass levels drifted in and out, too.",1393459200,,499,4.735632183908046

Like Bix, essentially ignored by Wynton Marsalis and Ken Burns for their ""Jazz"" series. Criminal. And to see Louis Armstrong, the Dorsey's etcetera pay tribute on film to Nichols, their band leader, shows what a significant person Nichols was, rather is, within the history of Dixieland jazz.",1390867200,,393,5.354838709677419

469537,5,6302477379,"I absolutely adore Danny Kaye and his work.  How I missed this one is beyond me.  I watched it for the first time today and it is now one of my all time favorite movies.  This is one of the few times Danny played a serious role and he did such an outstandingly beautiful and tender job.  In the movie Danny plays Red Nichols the famous coronet player of the 1920's.  He and his wife, played by Barbara Bel Geddes, have a daughter, Dorothy, and when she is 5 or 6 years old they decide to put her in boarding school because the road is no place to raise a daughter.  Dorothy contracts polio while she is at school.  In a way, she blames her father and their relationship is strained for awhile.  Red decides to quit the music business and works in a wartime factory and helps rehabilitate Dorothy until she is older.  Eventually, Dorothy and her mother convince Red to return to music.  The amazing Louis Armstrong is also in this movie.

If I could give this movie 10 stars I would.  It is amazing!!!!  It's too bad Hollywood doesn't make movies this innocent and tender anymore.  RIP Danny Kaye!",1386806400,,1096,4.361386138613861

Have had this on my want list (save for later) for over a year, as I really didn't want to pay ~$75.00 for it (YEP - that's the price it was listed for!!) My patience paid off! This classic was a limited release, so there aren't too many of them out there, hence the hefty price. The copy I received is slightly used - but like new! And the price - ~$30 with shipping - was favorable.  The songs is this show were largely written by Danny Kaye's wife, Sylvia Fine, and she protected his/her legacy & estate by issuing a limited release. This movie shows off the talents of the multi-talented Danny Kaye like no other - not just his musical abilities, but his ACTING abilities.  Yes - the depth of character that he reaches in this movie are incredible. He's not just a comedic actor, as he is best known, but also a wonderful dramatic actor. I am a sucker for fact-based biographical adaptations - especially ones of the musical geniuses who were ahead of their time, which Red Nichols was. I HIGHLY recommend this movie.

I can't tell you what a joy it is to hear him perform with Sachmo, I mean you expect Bing or Frank or whomever to sing with him, but the pairing of Danny and Louis is just the cat's pajamas.

Unfortunately, he wasn't a team player (evidently he was a real jerk about it sometimes too) and kept losing jobs because he refused to play any way but his - and Dixie jazz was not so popular.

Fortunately he made some friends along the way and (with a little help from his wife) finally got them to try things his way, and they liked it and formed a band called The Five Pennies. They were good and doing very well when Red's daughter got seriously ill and Red quit the business to be home for her. (A very tough thing for him to do because he loved his music and that career and really really craved being #1 at it and on the top rung of the professional musician ladder.)

Members of his Five Pennies band included the famous Jimmy Dorsey and Glenn Miller (who became individually popular after The Five Pennies broke up and they got bands of their own).  Another famous friend of Red's was Louie Armstrong (who plays himself in this picture) and he performs quite a bit in this movie.

I'm NOT a fan of Dixie or Jazz music (at all) but I DID enjoy most of the music in this movie as well as the story (and yes, there are a couple of tear-jerker scenes in his story).

It's not Danny Kaye's BEST movie, but it's close (the man is talented!) - and Barbara Bel Geddes, the actress who plays his wife, is also very good in this and has a lovely voice too.

It was refreshing to see Danny Kaye in this role where he portrays a real person in a real story, where most of his roles are playing fictional characters. He still maintained his jovial, fun, hilarious self, but showed his ability to portray seriousness as well.

Someone in an earlier review commented that this release was bare bones. What does that mean? No bonus features? Who gives a hoot. This movie is fantastic in and of itself and it needs no condiments.

Danny Kaye plays one of his finest roles ever as a coronet playing family man. He not being funny in this one. He's being darn good and it comes through loud and clear. In that classic style of ""tear tugging"" he riffs this role perfectly, and the film's finale is a mind-blower indeed.

Kaye and Armstrong's duet on ""When The Saints Go Marching In"" is the highlight of the film.

For a classic movie, the stereo in here is amazing, especially on the songs. In one instance, there are three people singing and their voices all coming out separately on different speakers. Pretty good for just a VHS tape. Now that a DVD has been released, I wonder what the sound on that is like?

The story starts to lag a bit near the end when Kaye starts to feel sorry for himself and this goes on and on as he retires from playing. However, there is a nice, sentimental upbeat ending.

The story itself is based on the life of trumpeter Red Nichols and a personal tragedy in his family that he worked hard to overcome.

Nichols himself plays the horn for Kaye off-camera, but Danny has plenty of opportunities to clown and make his own unique kind of music on-screen.  Indeed, a duet of ""When the Saints Go Marching In"" with the incomparable Louis ""Satchmo"" Armstrong is one of the film's highlights.

There is, however, a serious side to Nichols' story.  In the late 1930s, while his band was playing date-after-date on the road, his young daughter came down with polio.  As a result, he decided to quit the music business, going to work in a defense plant and spending more time with his family.  He not make a comeback until after World War II.

The movie was coherent, tightly woven both in the musical and emotional aspects. The duets between Danny Kaye (played by Red himself) and Louis Armstrong - the Battle Hymn of Republic and the Saints are marching - were wonderful. On the emotional side, Barbara Bel Geddes (Mrs. Ewing in Dallas) as Danny Kaye's sweetheart was a loving wife who endured long tours in the Five Pennies group, a devoted mother and a steadfast lady who held the family together. The bonds between the Five Pennies musicians, father and daughter, husband and wife are close and personal.

Susan Gordon, as the couple's daughter Dorothy from 6 - 8 yrs old, was a delight. She was intelligent, passionate for her father's music and love, and would settle for nothing less. The night when father and daughter developed a closer bond over the song ""Five Pennies"", a table of cards, followed by a duet in the bar was touching. Susan Gordon's performance was subtle yet memorable. The dramatic turn when Danny Kaye threw away his cornet and work in a wartime shipyard at a meagre salary to make up for Dorothy in the subsequent years was heartbreaking. When the accomplished cornet player did make a comeback, it was not easy but gradual. The big finale was a tear jerker, but it's worth every tear.

470155,5,6302477379,"How delightful to learn that this movie has been issued again as a DVD. I can do little more than echo the praise of the other reviewers. It's worth its weight in gold.

I first saw it soon after it came out, when I was a young teenager. I was so impressed that, for many months afterwards, I wanted nothing more than to become a coronet player. I eventually settled for piano lessons and, somewhat later, guitar. There's no question in my mind that ""The Five Pennies"" was a seminal influence in my decision to learn music. As a result, playing music is one of those activities I still enjoy as I meander through my sixties.

This movie resides in my deepest memories along with such classics as ""Westside Story"" and ""Breakfast at Tiffany's."" Its best virtue, in my opinion, is the musical content. I still listen to Danny Kaye's rendition of ""The Five Pennies,"" and there is nothing to compare to Kaye's and Satchmo's (Louis Armstrong) duet version of ""When The Saints Come Marching In.""

It goes without saying that the technology of movie production has come a long way since 1959. But technology alone does not ensure excellence. It's difficult to imagine that the cinematography in this movie could have been significantly improved with modern techniques.

I readily admit that nostalgia has colored my attitude toward this movie. But, what's wrong with that? I treasure those few things from 40-50 years ago that are still vibrant in my deepest memories. ""The Five Pennies"" is definitely one of them. You won't be disappointed with this movie; it's one of the select few that are timeless. Enjoy.",1173830400,,1602,4.772563176895307

Danny Kaye, this time out, makes do with less mugging, and, thus, ends up with a warmer, more grounded performance. Oh, he still has moments wherein he resorts to his patented gimmicks of glib double speak and foreign accents, but they're not many.

The film has Nichols writing sheet arrangements which incorporate jazz into the music. From the time when he was merely a lowly cornet player, he's tended to push his ideas perhaps too strongly at people and then having little patience when he is rebuffed. In the movie, he's seen as losing gig after gig because of his unwillingness to adapt to his current place in life, even though he had just gotten married and desperately needed the job. It's a credit to Danny Kaye's likability that the viewer doesn't get annoyed with him and, in fact, the fashion in which he gets axed time and again is played out in a humorous manner. Also, his perfect chemistry with Barbara Bel Geddes as his wife Bobbie and, later on, with Susan Gordon and Tuesday Weld, who respectively play his daughter Dorothy at ages 6 and 14, go a long way to lending Red Nichols empathy from the viewer. The music certainly resonates, but Red's family relationships and his later sacrifice are what gives THE FIVE PENNIES its emotional core. One of many favorite moments in the film is with Danny hanging out late one night with a young, insistently wide-awake Dorothy (Susan Gordon) at their motel room.

The real Red Nichols played the music while Kaye was doing the convincing cornet finger work. I still get chills when Danny Kaye, post vomit in a speakeasy, first plays the ""Battle Hymn of the Republic"" and ends up dueting with Louis Armstrong. Danny's actual wife, songwriter Sylvia Fine, ended up writing four very tuneful songs for this film: ""Follow the Leader,"" the catchy ""Lullaby in Ragtime,"" ""Goodnight - Sleep Tight,"" and ""The Five Pennies."" Another moment I love is the triple harmonizing amongst Louis, Danny, and Susan Gordon, where three of Fine's songs are seamlessly, gloriously interwoven. And then there's the magnificent ""When the Saints Go Marching In"" performance, which truly is the highlight of the movie and shows Mr. Kaye nicely holding his own with ol' Satchmo.

When folks think of Danny Kaye nowadays, if they even think of him at all, the movies most closely associated with him are THE COURT JESTER, HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN, or THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY. But, to see him at his warmest and most engaging, my money's on THE FIVE PENNIES. Highly, highly recommended.",1172016000,,3051,4.9319066147859925
470227,5,6302477379,"My grandmother introduced me to Danny Kaye movies starting with White Christmas and Court Jester.  Later I found movies like The Secret Life of Walter Mitty that were just as funny.  I was hooked on Danny Kaye the actor/comedian.

This is not one of his outrageously hilarious movies.  It's sad and beautiful with a wonderful plotline. A wonderful cast compliments Danny Kaye and the musical score is fantastic-- very jazzy rag. Louis Armstrong duets with Danny Kaye in voice as well as trumpet (coronet).  My favorite song has to be Lullabye in Ragtime, though.  They manage to meld two different melodies perfectly.

The movie focuses on the life of Red Nichol (Danny Kaye) as a small-town coronet player trying to make it big in the music industry.  He falls in love and gets married, but just as he's starting to make it to the big-time his wife gets pregnant.  They take the baby on the road with them for as long as they can but it's no life for a child.  Eventually she is sent to a boarding school where she contracts polio.  Red is so overcome with guilt that he gives up everything he had in the music industry to help his daughter get well and walk again.  By the time she's grown up and able to stand again she has forgotten that her father had ever been in the music industry.  Red's wife and all his old band buddies want him to be happy and get back into music, but Red keeps falling into depression and punishing himself for his daughter's polio.  It ends beautifully with all his band buddies turning out to hear him play and his daughter walking towards him without her cane and them dancing together.  It makes me cry every time.

I would highly recommend this to anyone as a feel good, slice-of-life movie that both has it's joyous highs and rock-bottom lows.",1171065600,,1779,4.529780564263323

470229,4,6302477379,"If you'd follow Danny Kaye anywhere, follow him here. He's at his clever, sometimes apparently improvisational musical best as he brings us the life of Loring ""Red"" Nichols, from the time Nichols brings his cornet to the big city, through the creation of his Dixieland Band, the 5 Pennies -- which gave a start to, incredibly, among others, the Dorseys, Gene Krupa, and Glenn Miller. The story is not the stuff of Pulitzer prizes, but it is very warm and it goes down easy. And I think what makes the film a standout and earns the stars is the foot-stomping dixieland music, and Danny Kaye and Louis Armstrong--the two of them together doing the Saints and Bill Baily; goose bumpy; thrilling!! There is other music written and arranged by Kaye's wife, the extraordinarily talented, Sylvia Fine; and at least one song, Ragtime Lullabye, sung with Barbara Bel Geddes, which still affects me in the most lovely ways decades after I first heard it in the movie theatre.  Here, on DVD and with the sound all cleaned up and presented in dolby digital, it's brand new all over again.

The reason I witheld the 5th star is ONLY because there are no extras presented with the disk. It would've been nice to have a trailer or whatever else might have been laying about to enhance the reasoning for the price.

Of course, for me--maybe for you, too, it mattered not. To spend a few hours watching Danny Kaye mugging, singing, acting, and filling the screen with his larger than life self is worth pretty much whatever the ticket says on it!",1169596800,,1529,4.655555555555556

I was concerned that it might not play on my equipment here in New Zealand as the DVD is Zone 1 and NTSC and the standard here is Zone 4 and PAL, but I had no need to worry as it played perfectly.

The picture and sound were both great.

At last to see it on DVD is a rare gift, I tried to get it transferred from a video print last year, but predictably, the video print was so bad (like so many video releases of movies of the period)that  the transfer  was almost unwatchable . This pristine print taken from original negative is a rich and glowing transfer of a movie beyond criticism and full of glorious dixieland music. Now with the movie soundtrack also available on CD, the movie and its wonderful soundtrack may be better appreciated by afficionados. My only criticism is the film comes with no special features, surely a doco on Kaye would not have been that hard to put together? or at least a retrospective doco and an interview with Susan Gordon and Tuesday Weld who are both still around? Paramount tend to be lazy with this sort of thing, they adapt their films superbly with excellent 16.9 widescreen transfers, then let themselves down by not presenting any extras. (the one exception was the release of ""White Christmas""-also Kaye)....Perhaps now we may see DVD releases of some other Kaye films - ""Wonder Man"", ""Merry Andrew"" and "" me and the Colonel"" would be nice.",1136246400,5,1312,4.626609442060086

The story is well-known amongst Five Penny ""liefhebbers"" and being able to watch Danny Kaye, Barbara Bel Geddes and Louis Armstrong perform in your own home is pure delight! The film was as enjoyable as it was the very first time I saw it as a youngster, and is made the way all good movies should be, no slut, violence or sex. Just pure happiness mixed with good music and human drama, which even makes one wipe tears away at times.

This movie is well recommended, especially for those who appreciate good music! Grab it on DVD before it sells out. Although the DVD is zoned for region 1 (USA) it should be able to play in most of the more recent DVD players and TV sets available today in other parts of the world.",1136073600,,964,4.410112359550562
470298,5,6302477379,"Times change.  Stars fall and are forgotten.  Even worse, an actor is remembered for only one type of role and his unique work is pushed to the background.  It is our good fortune to finally have one of Danny Kaye's finest performances on DVD.  The Five Pennies is now available on a barebones release.

Kaye is known for some brilliant comedies including The Court Jester, and for some more subtle performances like Hans Christian Anderson, but here he combines the best of the two.  In what purports to be the life story of famous cornet player,  Loring ""Red"" Nichols, Kaye is wonderful.  Along for the ride is Barbara Bel Geddes (Broadway's Maggie the cat) as wife Bobbie.  With her close, squinty eyes and squat shape, she is not exactly a movie babe, but she is terrific actress and great acting partner for Kaye.

Three things up the ante of this film to excellent:  the Oscar-nominated color photography in VistaVision by Daniel L. Fapp, the music performed by Louis Armstrong and Nichols himself as Kaye mimes the playing, and the performance of child actress Susan Gordon as Dorothy Nichols.

Kaye's scene with Gordon as he croons the Oscar-nominated title tune (written by his wife Sylvia Fine) is as touching a moment ever captured on film.  Kaye and Gordon seem to transcend themselves to actually become father and daughter.  Their poker scene is charming.  Gordon (who grows up to be Tuesday Weld later in the film) holds her own musically with Kaye and Armstrong and is a movie moppet to be adored.

Illness in the family, quitting show business, and other problems populate the final third of the film, but it is all presented with the proper sentiment.  When Red picks up his cornet again, we are glad.

The Five Pennies, its superb cast, 20 great musical numbers, and beautiful settings would be a welcome addition to your collection.  Kaye will touch your heart, and Gordon will make you smile with a tear in your eyes.",1135123200,80,1938,4.748502994011976

470300,5,6302477379,"This story presents the life of Red Nichols in a truly unique and entertaining way typical of many of the period's better films. However this film rises far above them all by entertaining you from the beginning till the end. Danny Kaye plays Red Nichols a talented and driven cornet player who begins his career with the Will Paradise's band but feeling trap and unable to play his own style of jazz branches out forming his own band The Five Pennies.

Together with his band and his singer/wife Bobbie played by a young Barbara Bel Geddes of ""Dallas"" fame cris-cross the country entertaining local dance and jazz fans. They continue their touring even after the birth of their daughter Dorothy who is played superbly by both Susan Gordon and Tuesday Weld. When Red's wife Bobbie believes the traveling from town to town and the night club lifestyle becomes too much for their daughter they send her off for a more normal life at boarding school. After a crisis involving Dorothy brings the family together again and it is determined continuous care for her would be needed they soon see the importance of sacrifice and what is really important in life. But they also find it's never too late to pick up a cornet again.

The sound track for this film is also amazing.
