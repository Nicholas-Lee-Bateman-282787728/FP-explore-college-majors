8554488,5,B00AN4XPQO,"This is a wonderful yoga DVD. Although the title suggests that it's therapeutic (and it is), it's suitable as an introduction to yoga for anybody, not just people who are looking for therapeutic yoga.

The first section introduces the three practices on the DVD; in addition Aparna provides a brief overview of yoga, yoga therapy and their roles in enhancing quality of life and promoting healing.

The short and extremely helpful section on posture will help students to achieve better alignment.

The three practices, Chronic Pain, Maintaining Health and Strength and Stability, each about an hour long, include gentle, energetic and well-planned flows. One of Aparna's strengths is her intuitive sequencing, and each practice provides a balance of effort, insight and exploration as well as promoting health. There is a relaxing, mindful meditation at the end of each of the three flows. Each of the three practices is a complete unit and is suitable for anybody, especially beginners and those who suffer from pain. All are set to a tasteful and inspiring soundtrack.

A great introduction to new students, full of great ideas for instructors, and an excellent way to establish and build a home practice.",1401148800,3,1208,5.1479591836734695
8554489,5,B00AN4XPQO,"The greatest attraction of this DVD is the competence of the teacher herself.  Aparna gives clear instructions as she demonstrates, speaking calmly in her melodic voice.  Aparna is a supremely confident teacher in a serene setting backed by soft flute music.  Practicing with this DVD is most satisfying because of the quality of the instructor and beauty of the whole production.  I am delighted to have found Aparnas Yoga Therapy for Lower Body.  I recently strained my lower back so I was able to use the gentle level of this DVD to coax my body back to health. There is a wealth of instruction for practice here.  Aparna has us begin with setting our intension for the practice.  I find this most helpful way to set and maintain focus. There are three levels of intensity for lower back work which enables you to work at your own ability each time as well as to progress in strength over time.  There is also a section with several guided meditations to choose from.  These can be accessed whenever you like.  I find them the perfect ending to practice or by themselves before going to bed.  I have been practicing yoga for over forty years; this is the best DVD I have found.",1400371200,,1180,4.571428571428571
8554490,5,B00AN4XPQO,"Aparna is a gifted, perfect instructor. Her balance between teaching you physical discipline, challenging your body just a bit further while teaching a gentle attending to your body's needs and abilities is something you will carry with you life as well as every yoga practice.

The lower body video she has produced here can be for beginners, intermediate or advanced students. This therapeutic yoga video very effectively address your pain, keep you strong if you are intermediate or challenge you if you are advanced.

Aligning your posture: By making you aware of your posture she teaches you how to begin to reduce the most common and most significant source of pain you experience. Then she has you analyze your own tendencies as you stand and walk to help you identify your problem areas. This informs you what you need to work on as you begin the practice and increases your mindfulness as you practice.

Relaxation and centered, mindful practice: Aparna's calm, intentional voice guides you through a short relaxation session prior to each practice and after each practice to help you reset & savor the therapeutic practice. You also have the option for meditations at the end as well.

Aparna has no ego to put forward. You are not distracted by her but rather she very knowledgably guides you through your individualized practice to maximize your benefit.

What I love best about Aparna and a huge part of what makes her the BEST YOGA instructor EVER is she is descriptive enough to allow you to turn inward and proceed with your practice while listening to her without having to constantly watch the TV to ensure you are doing it right. She says just enough. She doesn't talk just to fill the space: when she speaks, it is important. And in spite of her being an excellent role model and instructor, she communicates clearly this is not about being like her, its about being the best you.

The three sessions available here allow you to either address any chronic pain, maintain your current health or provide strength and stability. The chronic pain section helps heal those sore areas and recondition the proper muscles to ensure the pain will, with committed, regular practice, be a mere memory.

The Maintaning Health section challenges you just enough to keep your body nimble, flexible and comfortable.

The Strength and Stability section pushes the advanced practitioner to continue to challenge and further his/her practice.",1400284800,2,2444,4.973039215686274
8554491,5,B00AN4XPQO,"I credit this DVD with helping me improve the strength and flexibility in my back so now I can do Vinyasa Yoga without cringing inside.  I had back issues for so many years that I thought it was something that I just had to live with.  Now I marvel at everything Im able to do.  It is obvious from my results that Aparna is a very knowledgeable yoga therapy practitioner!

8554492,5,B00AN4XPQO,"I would recommend this DVD to anyone interested in great flexibility, strength, and alignment in the lower body. Yoga practitioners will love the focus and deepened understanding of lower body alignment principles and they will see general benefits in their yoga practice. Non-yogis shouldn't hesitate to use this DVD. Aparna's instructions are clear and easy to follow--like having a kind and knowledgeable physical therapist teaching you one-on-one. I have struggled with limited hip mobility and strength for several years in part due to cancer surgery, chemo, and radiation. I practice yoga regularly and use all levels of this DVD to great benefit.",1399248000,,653,5.411764705882353
8554493,5,B00AN4XPQO,"As in her other videos, Aparna does a great job instructing different levels of participants through poses.  My partner and I have enjoyed this DVD on the road when away from her class.  Her tone and directions are clear, yet relaxing.  The work outs are an ideal length.  Buy it!",1360195200,,280,4.54
8554494,5,B00AN4XPQO,"Like several other reviewers, I have been fortunate to practice with Aparna as my teacher in yoga and mediation. Having practiced for a number of years with different teachers, it becomes clear how special Aparna's teaching and philosophy is; it goes beyond any other form I've experienced in connecting body, mind, and breath.
Although I prefer to take her classes (in-person), the DVD's (3 in all) are very welcome when travelling. Even though I then I take classes with other teachers, `at home' practice, using Aparna's DVD's, keeps me well grounded in a responsible practice.
The Yoga Therapy- Lower body specifically is great for addressing certain health challenges, as mentioned in the DVD description, and it is also suitable for preventing such issues. I started yoga in support of my running, but over time has become an essential part of my life. No longer an absolute beginner, the gentle stretches in the lower-body DVD, provide a great source for me as a runner to address and prevent injuries.",1359676800,,1009,5.011904761904762
8554495,5,B00AN4XPQO,"I have the pleasure and privilege of practicing under Aparna for both yoga and meditation. Her DVDs are spot on with her informative, compassionate and unpretentious teaching style that I so enjoy in-person. The Yoga Therapy for the Lower Body DVD is great not only for folks new to yoga who are in chronic pain (like my stepmom who used this DVD with me during the holiday break--never set foot in a yoga class before), but also regularly practicing students like me. Until I tried this DVD, I was not fully aware of how limited my range of motion is. I mean, I knew that during yoga classes, I'd hit the proverbial ceiling in my range of motion, especially for certain poses--and some days sooner than I'd usually expect--but the exercises Aparna guides you through really have shown me that there's much more my body can do if I help it along! The DVD also includes guided meditations--which I greatly appreciate. I find the meditation deepens my capacity for practicing with mindfulness and focused, positive, self-compassionate intention. I highly recommend any of Aparna's DVDs (I own all three), and expect that even seasoned yogis would find tremendous benefit from the physical tune-up this and the Yoga Therapy for the Upper Body DVDs can provide. Oh, and if you are interested in really fantastic, practical yoga tips, Aparna has free YouTube videos to check out. Even as a relative novice in yoga, I was able to finally get into crow and am preparing my body for maintaining a full headstand pose! I believe the link is provided in the description info. If not, you can find her at livingyouryoga.org. Om and namaste",1356998400,,1628,4.797153024911032
