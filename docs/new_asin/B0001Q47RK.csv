8016112,5,B0001Q47RK,"Pirate's Dagger is a wonderful hidden gem.  I first enjoyed this film at a filmmaker's screening and have been waiting to see it available for purchase.

The message of ""choosing your friends carefully"" is subtle and timely.  Lots of good adventure and amazing sets . . . including a huge dark castle and a maze of lava flows.

It's great to have a kids film that is fun and fastpaced with a positive message that is subtle.

I strongly recommend for kids 5 - 10.",1113177600,,463,4.4
