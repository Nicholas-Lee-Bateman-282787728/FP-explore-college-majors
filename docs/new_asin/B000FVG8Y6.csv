8127193,5,B000FVG8Y6,"So, I got the Jim Henson bio a while ago.  All of a sudden, I would not read, I had to many ideas for puppets.  So, I waited a bit and got The Foam book.  Then, I read a few chapters and watched videos online and made my first puppet.

I asked for this video for Christmas.  I started it today at like 4pm.  I did something that I never do.  I sat here, in the middle of the day and watched the entire video.  I did not think of anything else.  My mind was 100% on this video.

I said I had learned stuff from watching a set of videos online.  Well, this guy did things 100% differently than the online guy did.  I much more like the way the puppets this guy makes, are made.  I cannot wait to get more stuff to build a bunch of puppets using these methods.

The guy in this video seems like a nerdy, intelligent human, who loves what he does and likes to show people how to do it.  It was like I was watching a family member.  He has a very fun, soft, slow way of talking.  The video has a home movie feel.  Which only makes it better.  You never get lost or upset; everything is explained in an easy, carefree way.  The video is fun to watch.

This video is expensive.  But, if you are at all interested in making puppets, I would 100% recommend this.  It would be cool if they had other videos.  But, I guess you really learn what you need to know from this one.

They also have outtakes, something funny explaining words he says, links to their dealers, where you can get the stuff they use, an index and maybe one thing else.

One of the best things I have ever gotten for Christmas.  I am 29, have not gone to college yet.  I had a brain injury in 03 that kind of stopped things for a bit.  But this video only added to my feeling that something in my future will have puppets.  I am writing a series of kids books.  I wanted to make it into a cartoon.  Maybe I can do it all with puppets.  Fantastic!  Thank you for the great video.",1421798400,,1939,3.9895287958115184

8127195,5,B000FVG8Y6,Oh my I love this book. If you want to make puppets these guys will et it done. This DVD is packed with great info.,1406246400,,115,3.64
8127196,4,B000FVG8Y6,"The explanations are very clear and easy to follow. Following them one can make their own patterns and get a puppet done in no time. However, the introduction and some parts of the videos are exactly the same in both discs. I would have preferred instead of repeating the introduction and explanations they would have added may be another nip and tuck example or how to make an animal or so. In any case, both dvd's complement each other and it is far easier to follow video than written instructions. It's worth the money.",1312502400,,523,4.574468085106383

---If you have been making puppets for a while, this DVD set may not be a big help. But it may very well give you a few good tips you haven't thought of before. If you ARE experienced, I would suggest getting the printed version instead. (since you already know the basics)

---If you are a beginner, DO NOT MISS THIS DVD!! Buy this DVD set instead of the printed book. Actually watching the demos are MUCH more informative than a few pictures and explinations.

Ok, so I am a University art instructor and an experienced sculptor. But it is abundantly clear that this DVD set provides all the information and step-by-step demonstration ANYONE would need to start making puppets they can be proud of. The presenter, Drew (who's a bit quirky, but fun) gives a whole lot of very, very helpful tips throughout both DVDs.

These videos introduce the viewer to two different styles of puppet making.
  1. The first is called the ""Three Piece"" method. This is a great method for people who like to plan their projects out beforehand. It is easy to yield relatively predictable results with this method and allows for multiple puppets to be made almost identically. This is a great benefit for anyone who is planning to perform the same puppet show over and over again (because a destroyed puppet can be replaced fairly easily).
  2. The second method is by far my favorite, however. It is called the ""Nip and Tuck"" method. This is an excellent (and very exciting!) method for individuals who like to develop projects as they go. It is difficult to reproduce ""Nip and Tuck"" puppets, but they can be the most visually engaging.",1287100800,8,1725,4.707641196013289
8127198,4,B000FVG8Y6,"Its a great DVD set of 2 discs, shows the whole process in an easy way.  Gives some great ideas if you don't follow all the steps religiously you can use it as inspiration, just like the book. The book is great too, its much the same but sometimes its more handy to have a book rather than the DVD so if you are serious about it get both!
One thing that I noticed was the DVD discs are not professionally pressed which doesn't matter at all, or make any difference to most people but it could possibly be a problem for very very old DVD players with playing them. They are burnt using dvd-r discs but ofcourse are official DVDs as they are from Grey Seal Puppets. They have a professional case and DVD label however.
Its a great buy for anyone considering puppet building and wants some tips and inspiration!",1284768000,,808,4.315789473684211
8127199,5,B000FVG8Y6,"I was really pleased with the 2 dvds. I never realised that I would get such clear detailed instructions for making puppets made of foam. The DVD came from USA and I was impressed by how quickly it arrived.
If you want to make foam puppets, muppet style, this is a must!",1251936000,3,270,4.211538461538462
8127200,5,B000FVG8Y6,Both methods of foam head construction are covered here. Fantastic detail....I really think that anyone could build one of these puppets with no prior experience just from carefully studying these DVD's,1196294400,3,202,5.548387096774194
