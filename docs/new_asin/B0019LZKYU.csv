8274454,1,B0019LZKYU,"Amazon should NEVER have listed this DVD.  Amazon shows the format as NTSC; what it does not say, however, is the rating classsification is ""E: Exempt From Classification.""  In other words, IT WON'T PLAY ON YOUR DVD PLAYER.

I got this from Caiman, which is great, and they have agreed to me returning this, but this never would have happened had Amazon gone to the simple precaution, like they do with PAL, of saying this is an E classification film.

Shame on you Amazon.  Hurrah for Caiman for being nice in agreeing to the return.",1222128000,6,534,4.578947368421052
