7955180,4,B00005UOTB,"Fans of slapstick humor rejoice.  This DVD is a compilation of a bunch of random clips of morons hitting each other with chairs, tables, and bats wrapped in barb wire. Oh yeah I'm not kidding.  The stunts and skits are so stupid that they are hilarious.  Some of the things these kids do are more shocking tham funny.  That's why this dvd is not for everyone.  If you like MTV's Jackass, you'll probably love this.  Everyone else might want to rent it if possible first.",1023926400,3,470,4.470588235294118
