742881,5,6303928102,"Our heroes portrayed by Josh Weinstein (POOL DAYS), Raoul O'Connell (FREIND OF DOROTHY) and Matt Nolan (THE DISCO YEARS) embark on the journey called Coming Out.  Hearts are broken, family members are upset and close  friends provide a shoulder to cry on (Anne Zupa, you are just wonderful!)  Films like this provide such a nice diversion from a stressful life for me!  Anyway, these quality films have been given a nice release from Image DVD.  The quality is much better than the VHS versions, but that hardly matters.  Each film is presented full frame only. An interactive menu and scene  selections are the only extras offered.  No trailers (oddly the trailer for  this film is offered on the BOYS LIFE 2 DVD) Buy this for the low Amazon  price and show Image Entertainment that we support such films on DVD.  Who  knows, maybe they'll give us more gay films like the equally entertaining  BOYS IN LOVE series.",944092800,24,915,4.751592356687898
742882,2,6303928102,"I enjoyed the second and first story more than the  last.  The only thing I didn't like about this film (and all gay cinema), is the fear to portray intimacy on the screen.  Had this been a heterosexual film, the couples  would have been butt naked and bumpin' within the first ten minutes.  It  took almost half an hour for one kiss!  Now I'm not saying that I want to  see hardcore anything, but I would like to see the two actually together  without fear from the critics. Other than that I thought it was nice, the  acting was kind of cheesy but who can blame them? I actually give it like 4  stars but if I did would you read my review?",939772800,13,641,4.130081300813008
742883,5,6303928102,"We enjoyed the short films a lot. They are unusually high quality creations and we hope there will be many more of this kind. Although they don't forget the serious aspects of the process of coming out of younger  men, the stort films are created with a message of humor and optimisnm  which makes the viewer feel refreshed after viewing. This is the kind of  films I wished I  could have seen as a teenager.",915321600,4,408,4.4
743185,4,6303928102,"Wow, very good! Much Better than 2. I watched these films out of order but was pleasantly surprised by the vast differences. The films were longer and much more fulfilling. I enjoyed watching this movie from start to finish. Great job! I must recommend this one for the home collection.",1014336000,3,286,4.74
743186,3,6303928102,"These little movies, which seem much more dated, content-wise and technically, than 1995, are like really good junk food -- you will enjoy every minute, but they will not stay with you.  Each one begins and builds like classic gay porn movies, except of course these little films are tastefully erotic, and tell stories of both requited and unrequited love, and of the trials and tribulations of growing up gay. The performances are uniformly unintentionally hilarious, particularly the mother in the final ""Disco Years"" movie.",981072000,3,527,5.2
743187,4,6303928102,"I don't really like ""shorts"".  I like to get to know my characters a little more thoroughly than ""shorts"" allow.  Consequently I'm really pleased to recommend ""Boys Life"" to you.  They're  some problems.  As a previous reviewer noted  ""Pool Days"" ends way  too abruptly.  ""A friend of Dorothy's"" star, director, and writer (Raoul  O'Connell) may have over-extended himself a bit.  And I couldn't buy the  Mom in ""Disco Years"".  But the over-arching themes of not being able to get  away from your true self really stuck with me.  Overall, I felt my money  was well spent.",963273600,2,571,4.802083333333333
743188,4,6303928102,"These short films are great. Another collection of shorts in comparison is ""Boys in Love"". However, ""Boys' Life"" is much better for many reasons. First, the acting is much better. The actors actually  have ranges of emotion and seem more relaxed and real than those in  ""Boys in Love"". Second, the stories are more interesting. They're  not very deep or too ""artsy fartsy"". They're simple stories that  many people will enjoy. Third, cuter guys.
I was fully entertained by  ""Boys' Life"" and I can't wait until I get ""Boys' Life  2"".",952300800,10,532,4.791208791208791
743189,3,6303928102,"BOYS LIFE: THREE STORIES OF LOVE, LUST, AND LIBERATION

(USA - 1995)

Aspect ratio: 1.37:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

Compilation of short gay films on the theme of 'coming out'. Though directed by three different people, these three episodes share the same budgetary limitations and basic point-and-shoot style, all of which serves to roughen their edges a little.

Brian Sloan's POOL DAYS (USA - 1993) follows the exploits of a young pool attendant who tries to suppress the feelings generated by the semi-clad beefcake which surrounds him in his otherwise dull job, before finally coming to terms with his sexuality with the help of a regular visitor to the pool (gorgeous, naturally) who takes a shine to him. It's a likable, sexy film, but it seems to end abruptly, leaving a couple of unresolved situations in its wake.

Raoul O'Connell directs A FRIEND OF DOROTHY (USA - 1994) and casts himself as a nerdy college freshman who's seeking Mr. Right, whilst secretly pining for his apparently straight roommate. Sadly, O'Connell affects a range of tics and mannerisms which translate as geeky rather than appealing, though his film is competently constructed.

And finally, Robert Lee King's THE DISCO YEARS (USA - 1991) depicts the trials of a seriously cute high school student who longs to be accepted by his homophobic peers until their cruelty eventually forces him to confront his true sexual identity.

Many of the situations depicted in all three films have a ring of truth about them, and each story offers its own heartfelt commentary on the lives of young gay men in America, despite the penny-pinching production values.

Followed by BOYS LIFE 2 (1998).",950486400,26,1671,5.050909090909091
743190,4,6303928102,"Heartwarming, funny at times, but honestly true even in todays so called liberal thinking society. The last story being the one that shows times haven't really changed from the 60's and 70's people are still cruel and  narrow minded. All in all the ninety minutes of the film passed by quickly.  the acting wasn't oscar caliber but it was well done. The movie shows that  gays are human beings with feelings, and those feelings get hurt, we find  it awkward to ask for that first date, in fact we are just like every one  else.",944784000,13,527,4.505263157894737
743191,5,6303928102,"This is such a great short film series.  I have had numerous showings for friends and all have either rented it, purchased it or borrowed it from me (cheapo's).  Raoul is the hottest babe.  This is a must see, as is Boys  Life 2.  The only ones that seem bothered by it were people who like their  entertainment real glossy and mainstream.  Got it? Get it!",944438400,10,356,4.303030303030303
7857423,5,6303928102,"Although these three gay short films may seem dated in the era of YouTube, Grindr, and Tumblr, they are charmingly lovable, and they have tremendous heart. My favorite is ""Friend of Dorothy,"" and one can see Kevin McClatchy in one of his first roles. I remember seeing these three shorts as a breath of fresh air in the ""New Queer Cinema"" era in the 1990s, during which time many of the gay films embraced a more gritty realism (Greg Araki, etc.).",1505260800,,447,4.530864197530864

7857428,3,6303928102,This dvd has a few gay themed short stories. There ok for watching one time. Wouldnt want to pay more than 3 or 4 dollars for it. If this tells you anything i sold my copy of this movie.,1349827200,,186,3.7948717948717947
7857429,5,6303928102,"The series of three short stories is well scripted and the actors are perfect in their respective roles. No ""Gone With The Wind"" classic epic, no detailed, in depth script, however, each story is light, to the point and fun to watch. If deep plots with twist, turns and subplots is what you seek this may not be the film for you. But if you want something a little less intense that will put a smile on your face purchase this movie. Enjoyable, lighthearted look at glowing youths coming of age and discovering their gay inner self. A nice change. Noone is sick or dies in this movie.",1190160000,,584,4.416666666666667
7857430,5,6303928102,"I can't say the video quality was terrific but it wasn't bad. The casting in these short stories was very good. The leading characters are certainly quite nice to look at. You won't be disappointed by the view. I enjoyed the whole thing for the most part and can't really think of anything I would want to point out as ""less than desireable"". My only beef with this collection is that the stories are very short. Just when it seems that things are fixing to heat up to steaming, the stories end leaving me wanting more. Each short story leaves you with something to fantasize about in your own mind as you create your own sequel. I will be buying this entire collection of ""Boy's Life"" films. I'm hooked! Each story is very well written and the acting is wonderful! I highly recommend it!",1159920000,,788,4.479166666666667
7857431,5,6303928102,"It's quite an accomplishment that three stories filmed by three very different filmmakers could be simultaneously so insightful about gay & bi-sexual relationships, and their struggles!

""Pool Days"" is about the awkwardness of adolescence, and the mutual attraction between an older man and a younger one. A story about experiece and vulnerability!

""A Friend Of Dorothy"" portrays a common dilemma many gay and bi-sexual people experience at some point in their life: the intense attraction towards someone whom is heterosexual. Sensitively examined, this story truly left me feeling moved!

""The Disco Years"" shows another version of a no-win situation: getting involved with someone who is not only confused about their sexual orientation, but is also terrified of being exposed as anything other than straight! A very empowering story for those of us who have experienced betrayal at the hands of a sexually confused and frightened person!

While these three stories will appeal to anyone who has an iota of empathy towards others, they will psychologically empower those who consider themselves gay, bi-sexual or searching! Each story is uplifting in its own unique way.",1140566400,3,1174,5.398907103825136
