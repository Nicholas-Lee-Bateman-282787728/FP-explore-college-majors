8521265,3,B007R7JUEQ,This is actually a webseries. at least I think it was. The webseries is the same as this only in 2d.  Somehow they went back and redid some shots into 3d and converted the rest?  anyways it seems to be out of print now. I collect 3d flims so I am glad I got it. IT's a lowbudget webseries about a group of safety people who make things worse.  There is probably a lot more episodes of this show. or they took them and strung them together here Anyways this is was not a separate movie shot about the webseries as far as I can find out. It does seem to be the webseries?  This is one of the more strange entries into the 3d cannon of film. So if you collect 3d then you will want it. If not then expect the production values of a webseries. IT is funny though as the idiotic safety monitors cause damage to things. Are there other svi episodes? and things online? yes there are.  So this is one of the more mysterious 3d blu rays out there.  at least it is not a dvdr.,1420848000,,967,4.010416666666667
8521266,1,B007R7JUEQ,This is movie that is not suited for anyone with a brain.  The acting stinks and the script must have been written by a 13 year old..,1395878400,,133,3.925925925925926
8521267,1,B007R7JUEQ,"This is probably going to go down in my history book as the worst movie I have ever seen.  Some lewd comedy, ridiculous antics, the only 3D is the characters faces coming in for head shots!  There is nothing at all redeeming about this comedy.  It will keep me from ever buying or thinking Canadian humor could be funny.",1383523200,,320,4.389830508474576
8521268,1,B007R7JUEQ,"just plane dumb the movie had no story line and was boring/it was so bad that I went to sleep on it 2 times,just a wast of money",1370563200,,128,3.607142857142857
8521269,2,B007R7JUEQ,"another 720p  3D movie out there.  not worth the money.  im not reviewing this as if i want to tell you about the movie itself..  i rate movies that are placed in the 3D category for their 3D quality.  there is NO pop out effect,  looks as if this wasn't even filmed in 3D at all.

if they took 3D off the cover then i wouldnt be so pissed about  about my purchase.

out of 250 3D movies i own now,  this is in the bottom 10 for 3D effect.

BUYER BEWARE,  don't buy this hoping you will see 3D,  its not that way at all.",1339545600,,520,3.792452830188679
8521270,5,B007R7JUEQ,"I liked Safety Geeks.  It is an independent looking thing but frankly it's unique and being a fan of Adult Swim and Monty Python humor I thought I'd give it a try.

Pleasant surprise it's good and it something to actually watch on my 3D TV

Good laughs and cast",1336348800,15,261,4.18

SVI 3D is about comic adventures of a semi-elite force of safety experts; the P.O.S.H. (Professional Occupational Safety Hazard) team. Obsessed with making the world and some bits of Canada safer, the team investigates inane accidents to find out what went wrong and who is to blame. Ironically, their involvement causes far more damage than they prevent, leaving a trail of chaos and destruction in their wake. Fans of Monty Python humor and Adult Swim programs will thoroughly enjoy this deftly acted, cleverly animated, 3D comedy. -  Stereoscopy News

Safety Geeks: SVI from the creators and stars of Invention with Brian Forbes, David Beeler (Reginald Syngen-Smithe) & Tom Konkle (Budwin W. Yaker). Also starring Brittney Powell (Dr. Randi Minky), Benton Jennings (Manservant Hopkins) and Mary Cseh (Sparky Van Der Graaf). The first episode introduces the main characters, as well as starts the story arc that continues through the following episodes. The comedic style of this web series is well written and brilliantly acted out. This series is also a most ingenious one, with its use of special effects. - Jeff Elwell

Bottom Line: Raunchy, wacky and filled up to the brim with one-liners, Safety Geeks SVI is an object lesson in High Camp and a real must-watch for anyone who likes their comedy with a great, big dollop of outrageousness. Steve Spaulding

The creators have described the show as ""a nice mix of surreal Adult Swim humor with a Monty Python take on CSI, Missing, Without a Trace, NCIS etc.."" While I hesitate to compare anyone to Monty Python, because they are legends, that description is well stated. The show is very funny, full of one-liners, and often flying off the rails into the completely absurd. If you're an Adult Swim or Monty Python person, it should be right in your wheelhouse.

SVI follows the exploits of the P.O.S.H. (Professional Occupational Safety Hazard) team, which is made up of Reginald Syngen-Smythe (David Beeler), Budwin Yacker (Tom Konkle), Dr. Randy Minki (Brittney Powell), Sparky Van Der Graff (Mary Cseh), and Dr. Randy's amazing boobs (seriously, they get so many closeups, they deserve their own credit, their own IMDb page, and a spot as the wallpaper on my phone). EDIT: And Hopkins (Benton Jennings)! How did I forget Hopkins? He is, after all, the brains of the operation. P.O.S.H. investigates accidents and safety violations. Fortunately for us, if not the people they are investigating, along the way they cause more problems than they solve.

The first season is now complete, and follows one case of a tragic forklift accident at a warehouse store. The actions of the team range from odd, to stupid, all with huge helpings of cheese. And I mean that in the best possible way. It's all great fun to watch.

That cheesiness also extends to the look of the show. Clearly a lot of time and effort has gone into the effects used, and they take on a quality that I would call fantastically bad. That's not bad in the sense of not being good. It's bad in the sense that many of the effects are so cheesy that they are almost as absurd as the story we're watching. To that end, they fit perfectly, and just add to the experience. - Brett Love

Placevine said Safety Geeks is yet another winsome, winning comedy series from the talented twosome of David Beeler and Tom Konkle, this one an ensemble effort chronicling the exasperating exploits of the P.O.S.H. (Professional Occupational Safety Hazard) team, in both 2 and 3D! The fact that they're basically a bunch of well-meaning but hopelessly incompetent misfits is the basis for their bumbling series of moronic mishaps, which all prove quite counterproductive to their professional mission statement. The troupe's over-the-circus-top antics, which include ribald riffs and goofy gore in the spirit of Monty Python, either rub your funny the bone the right or the wrong way, but there's no denying their seemingly endless supply of inspired inventiveness.

The P.O.S.H. (Professional Occupational Safety Hazard) Team as they investigate a forklift accident that took place at a ""Giant Provisions,"" a Costco or Sam's Club type warehouse store. For safety professionals they sure cause a lot of destruction ranging from death by private plane landing (on you) to electrocution by crime scene tape.  But (spoiler alert) they do solve the ""case"" but at what cost? I'm sure Budwin Yaker would know the penny. Speaking of...

The P.O.S.H on site Team is made up of eccentric British billionaire, Reginald Syngen-Smithe (David Beeler), the inscrutable number cruncher Budwin W. Yaker (Tom Konkle) and ex-stripper turned psychologist Randi Minky (Brittney Powell), who not only adds laughs but is the show's sex appeal. She looks like Sophia Bush's sexier older sister. Then there is the requisite support team at headquarters, crippled techie, Sparky Van Der Graaf  (Mary Cseh) and Reginald's butler, the aptly named Manservant Hopkins (Benton Jennings). All the actors do a really good job. Their performances are quirky and consistent. So much delicious awkwardness.

The whole show was shot on Green Screen, which really created a unique environment. It lent its self to humor you normally only see in animated shows these days. The special effects varied from realistic to silly, which I preferred in the instances of blood spurting.  I was really impressed with the whole aesthetic.

For me, most laughs came from non-sequiturs and witty one-liners, of which there are many.  I occasionally cringed at the crudeness and there were some jokes that just fell flat. But I know that if I took a time machine back to 1998 and spied on myself at 16 watching this show, she would be laughing at completely different moments. There is a variety of humor in SAFETY GEEKS: SVI, something for everyone. And it definitely exemplifies Dave & Tom's credo:  ""silly comedy for smart people.""

Verdict: In the spirit of the show, it gave me a comedic erection. One that lasted over 8 hours. So, someone tell Sparky to clear the grid and let the emergency vehicles through, please. If you didn't get the reference, you haven't watched the show. Have you seriously not watched this show yet?

8521272,5,B007R7JUEQ,"From underneath the brilliant toupees of Dave & Tom comes a show that pokes relentless fun at a society increasingly over-obsessed with safety.

Thus,  Safety Geeks: SVI is a parody on many levels. There are large parts of OSHA, bits of Thunderbirds, elements of Geek Squad and a massive helping of CSI. In a nutshell: a team outside all jurisdictions swoops in to investigate accidents -- the twist being that they cause more damage and harm than the accident itself.

Much of the humor derives not so much from safety and lack thereof but from the wacky characters played by seasoned actors all around. The focus is mainly on the five lead characters and their particular personaes, but there is (unsurprisingly) a big spotlight on the Dr. Randi Minky character and her incongruous stripper-past, played bodyliciously by Brittney Powell (a chest... uhm... face that may be familiar to Xena and Friends viewers). Her acting is solid to say the least, but jokes in reference to her former employment and (in her own words) `heaving bosoms' are frequent and stoop a little low for comedy's sake, and few are the episode where Brittney doesn't get to bust a stripper move or point at the camera... and not with her fingers either. Naturally the hits come clicking in whenever you bring innuendos into the storyline.

Still, all the raunchiness aside (and there is some, so a few episodes may not be entirely SFW, although that depends on your work) Safety Geeks has its comedic merits.

David Beeler and Tom Konkle, two veritable Renaissance Men who besides writing, producing, editing, etc, also play their respective characters Reginald Syngen-Smythe and Budwin Yacker with plenty of mojo. David uses a whacked-out version of his `Invention` character Brian Forbes to become Reginald, the English plonka and founder of the team, while Tom is a dead-pan Oliver Hardy to David's Stan Laurel. Rounding out the crew are Reginald's seemingly out-of-place Butler Hopkins (Benton Jennings) and the deliciously too-hot-to-be-a-computer-nerd Sparky Van Der Graaf (Mary Cseh, and FYI: Brittney ain't got nuthin' on her, y'all!).

The various support-characters deserve a big shout-out as well. So far there is not a single character who stumbles over his lines or seems to distantly read a cue-card. Everyone involved give their most hilarious and they obviously had a lot of fun on the set.

Very much noteworthy is also the execution of the show.  Shot entirely on green-screen, Safety Geeks is professional enough to avoid the infamous echo-effect in their sound recording, so common in most home-grown green-screen studios. The digital sets are very well done and it is a pleasure to see that it is possible to create on a small budget a massive Flying Wing and have it swoop in and blow up a bunch of cars in the process, without it looking distractingly fake.

Safety Geeks is effectively a Theater of the Absurd, much like the other shows by the same creative writing team of Invention with Brian Forbes and Archaeology of Comedy. Albeit not everyone's cup of tea, it has mainstream appeal with its one-lines, non-sequiturs and black humor.

And for everyone else, there are heaving bosoms.  -Alec Corday Reviewer",1336089600,11,3210,5.015037593984962
