4568903,5,B0054JELWA,"I've seen short clips of Godfrey on Youtube and also saw his brief cameo in Louie (if he's cool with Mr. C.K., he's cool with me), but was relatively unfamiliar with him. Just finished watching this stand up and found it absolutely hilarious. Godfrey's material is really for a general audience; nothing too esoteric, everyone will get the jokes, and the humor is upfront. He's a great impressionist, he incorporates physical comedy in throughout, and he's just a great overall performer. Not particularly the brand of comedy that I go for, but I'm absolutely sold. It's a shame that he isn't too well known, while guys like Dane Cook and Mencia have made their rounds...",1341360000,,671,4.843478260869565
4568904,1,B0054JELWA,"A black comedian with only 3 reviews might not be very funny. Also, why is this DVD not on Netflix yet?",1334448000,,103,3.9523809523809526
4568905,4,B0054JELWA,"Godfrey:Black by Accident had me laughing through the entire video, I purchased a used copy through Amazon and was very pleased to receive it in the mail without any scratches or nicks.",1318291200,4,185,4.8125
4568906,4,B0054JELWA,"I have seen Godfrey when he was on Premium Blend years ago, and thought he was funny then and think he is still funny now.  I have seen this performance on Comedy Central and also rented to get the uncut version and I will be getting this DVD soon, but I felt I had to defend Godfrey from a one sided bad review.  My wife and I both think Godfrey is great and as well as everyone I have shown him to (no matter the age or race).

  I hate to disagree with the first reviewer, but I am 29 years old and my wife is 30 (I am white and she is black) and we both found him to be very funny.  His phrase ""Oh my goodness!!"" with his characteristic African accent is what my wife say to each other all the time (from his Premium Blend routine years ago).  He is of African decent (Nigerian) and has often talked about it in previous acts.

  Godfrey's physicality and punch lines work well together.  He does jokes about race but is not too offensive with them.  His level or racial controversy is not on the level of Dave Chappelle or Richard Pryor (both of whom I love also).  Godfrey is not controversial about race, and his level of humor is more accessible to a wider audience and he sells it well with his physicality.  He even does a good Obama impression!  No matter your ideological leanings, it's funny!  I have seen more of Godfrey then the first reviewer, and anyone I show him to (no matter the performance) whatever they're race or age, they have ALL thought he was funny.  So take it from a student of comedy and a long time follower of Godfrey, this performance is funny and he is a great comedian :-)",1317686400,7,1609,4.205882352941177
4568907,2,B0054JELWA,"Maybe I am too old fashioned, but this routine was not very funny at all. This one will be the first dvd on my sale table. And I am Black, so it had to be horrible.",1317081600,,164,3.5833333333333335
8456732,5,B0054JELWA,One of the best stand comedies I've ever seen. Hands down. Watched this with a group of friends and we were crying laughing so hard the entire time. Godfrey is one of the most underrated comedians and the most hilarious!,1499558400,,220,4.525

8456739,5,B0054JELWA,"Saw him in person and then bought this.  Some of the material was the same, some that he did not do in his live show that was after this was recorded. Not very profane (which I like) but does occasionally swear, but in context! Suitable for all ages (over 18) and ethnic backgrounds. Very talented!",1365465600,,298,4.418181818181818
