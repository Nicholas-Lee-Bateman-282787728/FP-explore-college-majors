8538420,2,B009AHNRVI,"I didn't like this dvd only because on your website everything that says new and sealed is not new, its just a copy of the original that has then been sealed as this dvd was... Its cover was even a pathetic attempt of a photocopy, I could barely make out the tiger! very disappointing. After my last purchase i won't be visiting amazon anymore.",1377388800,2,344,4.390625
8538421,5,B009AHNRVI,"So far I have seen only one of the three episodes, but it is excellent! BBC was obviously involved, as I recognize Mr. Attenborough's excellent narration. It's informative with excellent footage, and it focuses entirely on NATURE not scientists, at least so far.
This deserves to be an official BBC product and should be offered on blu-ray disc.",1372896000,3,345,4.9655172413793105
