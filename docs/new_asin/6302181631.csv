435262,3,6302181631,I haven't seen these since they were first aired in the 1960's so I wasn't sure what I would feel when I watched them again almost 50 years later. Unfortunately for me the feeling was not what I first felt but instead bordered on boredom. This is not to knock the series which I enjoyed immensely when I was young but I guess I grew up and my tastes changed. The Transfers are all of very good quality and the packaging is good. I think part of my problem is I keep seeing Robert Vaughn as the corrupt politician in Bullitt or the demon haunted gunslinger in the Magnificent 7. Also it seemed that Vaughn and McCallum get their butts kicked far too often in the movies to qualify as the kind of spies I have come to expect from James Bond and Jason Bourne.  The problem with the series was it couldn't decide if it was serious or a spy spoof like Matt Helm or Our man Flint.,1408665600,,874,4.171597633136095

The stories were a bit like a James Bond film but under budgeted. The actors became world famous and UNCLE was a huge hit for the following couple of years.
I recommend this set to all fans who do not own the series(I do own the series and still have this and watch it.)Robert Vaughn and David McCallum are still the best spy team going.

They are about 90 minutes of a little longer.

The quality is great, they play very well and they are a fun, this was reasonably priced, and it is a trip down a memory path that will put a smile on your face.

Like many of the shows of this genre from the 60's (Honey West, Wild Wild West) that are not on Netflex streaming, they can be a bit salty in price for a trip to another decade.

435367,5,6302181631,"I primarily bought this DVD set so I could see the very first U.N.C.L.E. movie ""To Trap a Spy"" 1964 which has Luciana Palluzi in a role very similiar to her later (not much later) James Bond ""Thunderball"" 1965 Spectre Agent role.
Also this first movie has all of the first Pilot colour footage and more, some of which wasn't used in the first 1 hour Pilot ""Solo"" (later to be re-edited into the B&W Episode ""The Vulcan Affair""). For some reason up until now this first movie had not been released on DVD; the other ones have on a rental DVD (which had the rest of them).
Hence this first movie is very unique as it's basically the reworked Pilot ""Solo"" where they have utilised absolutely all colour footage. In effect for many overseas countries yet to see the TV show this ""opened"" the series and acted as a ""Pilot"". The scenes with Luciana Paluzzi were re-utilised into the 1st Season B&W Episode ""The Four Steps Affair"".
So if you are really into ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."" (e.g. I also have all the episodes as well as ""The Girl From U.N.C.L.E."" DVD's) and if you really appreciate the early days/Season 1 you'll love this. To see all the other U.N.C.L.E. movies (except the first one ""To Trap a Spy"") you don't need to buy this; as the 2nd U.N.C.L.E. movie (""The Spy With My Face"" made during Season 1) onward are readily available through rental DVD.",1345161600,,1356,4.493927125506073
435368,4,6302181631,"The Man from UNCLE was the first of a number of espionage series on TV during the 1960s, and for a time, one of the most successful.  The two films from the first season, To Trap a Spy, an expanded version of the pilot, and Spy With My Face, were the most realistic.  The scripts were written as the series was just beginning to find its style, and come across as more original than later efforts.  By the second season the series had hit its stride.  The premise was similar to the James Bond films, and like Ian Fleming's novels, the scripts were often fanciful.  One Spy Too Many has the agents battling a megalomaniac industrialist bent on global conquest.  One of Our Spies is Missing has an intriguing sci-fi angle involving a search for an anti-aging device, and is somewhat understated.  In the third season, the series degenerated into self-parody, with the result that the two films from that era are mediocre at best.  In the fourth season, the series went back to the original approach of drama rather than satire.  The two entries from that time, Helicopter Spies and How to Steal the World feature good plots, with some real tension.  But even better scripts were unable to revive a series which had been undercut by broader social changes.  In 1965, international politics was dominated by the Cold War, making espionage popular.  By 1968, in the wake of the political turbulence surrounding the Vietnam War, audiences were more interested in other issues, and spy sagas had fallen out of favor.",1340755200,,1510,4.721374045801527

435407,5,6302181631,"I had just purchased an all-region DVD player and the UNCLE movies in PAL format when Warner Brothers announced the release of the entire set of movies.

As a ""first cousin"", one of the most important reasons for having the movies is that they contain additional characters, scenes and storylines not included in the televised episodes. For US UNCLE fans, having all of the movies is a particularly advantageous since the later movies were never shown in US theatres.

I'm in agreement with the well-written Cohen review, which provided a lot of background information about the movies. I can't remember how much the review specifically covered about the episodes from which the movies were created, so I apologize for any redundancies.

First Season Movies:
""To Trap a Spy"" was the original adaptation of the pilot ""Solo"". The guest actors included Fritz Weaver as Andrew Vulcan, Patricia Crowley (""Please Don't Eat The Daisies"" and Vaughn's wife in an episode of ""The Lieutenant""), William Marshall and Ivan Dixon (""Hogan's Heroes""). In watching ""To Trap a Spy"", it appears there were voice-over edits of the name of the nasty organization of evil-doers aiding Vulcan and his plot. Also, based on the date and time period mentioned, it would seem that ""Vulcan"" occurred around 1961; arguably, some of the first season episodes could have occurred before 1964.

Subsequent to the initial filming of ""Solo"", NBC exec, Grant Tinker, wanted ""the K guy"" dropped from the cast. Tinker meant Kuryakin, not Kuluva. Rolfe and Felton held onto their Soviet agent, the scenes done by Will Kuluva as Mr. Allison were edited out (Kuluva later appeared as von Etske in Fourth Season's ""Gurnius Affair""). Leo G. Carroll filmed the scenes as Alexander Waverly, the scenes were used to create the condensed, initial first season episode, ""The Vulcan Affair"", and the first episode aired on Sept. 22, 1964. The series gained momentum in the ratings solely, but ""the K guy"" turned out to be an important part of the appeal of the series.

In addition to cutting Kuluva's scenes, the scenes in ""To Trap a Spy"" with Luciana Paluzzi (Angela) were dropped from the ""Vulcan Affair"" episode. The scenes with Paluzzi were used some weeks later in the first season episode, ""The Four Steps Affair"".

""Spy With My Face"" was expanded from ""The Double Affair"". A couple of Kitt Kitteridge clips from ""Four Steps"", and a lot of additional film footage and characters were added. The main guest star, Senta Berger, as the lovely THRUSH agent, Serena, received box office billing above co-star McCallum in the movie credits.

In SWMF, Sharon Farrell (""Minus-X""; ""Pieces of Fate"") was a flight attendant as well as Napoleon's love interest, Sandy Wister. Jennifer Billingsley (the blonde model pursuing IK in ""Adriatic Express""), did not appear in the television episode. She was both a roommate and a flight attendant with Sandy, and became Illya's romantic interest in the movie.

Second Season Movies:
""One Spy Too Many"" was based on the two-part season premier episode, ""Alexander the Greater"", the only episode without the word ""The"" at the beginning of the title. The main guest stars in ""Alexander"" were Rip Torn and Dorothy Provine.

""One of Our Spies Is Missing"" (OOOSIM) was expanded from the two-part episode, ""The Bridge of Lions Affair"". The guest stars included Maurice Evans, Vera Miles, James Doohan (""Shark Affair"" and Scotty from ""Star Trek""), and Bernard Fox (""Thor Affair""). Anna (or Ahna) Capri (""Birds & Bees"", ""Maze Affair""), had a significant secondary character part in the movie as the model ""Dodo"", but Capri doesn't appear in the television episode. In the episode, Dodo's murderous ways were carried out by the older, trench-coated, hat-wearing Olga.

Third Season Movies:
Third Season was when the powers that were wanted ""camp"". Just as the episodes suffered from weak humor and storylines, the movies from Season 3 weren't on par with Seasons 1 & 2.

""The Spy in The Green Hat"" was a derivative of ""The Concrete Overcoat Affair"". Guest stars included Jack Palance as Louis Strago and Janet Leigh as the infamous Miss Diketon, along with Pia's gang of gangster uncles.

""The Karate Killers"" was adapted from ""The Five Daughters Affair"". The extensive guest list included Joan Crawford, Herbert Lom, Telly Savalas, Terry-Thomas, Danielle DeMetz (""Foreign Legion"", ""Take Me to the Casbah""), and Kim Darby.

The actress slated to play Imogen was unavailable at the time of filming began. Jill Ireland, by that time, had filed for divorce from McCallum, but she stepped in to fill the role. McCallum and Ireland, who had appeared together since 1957 in movies and on television in the UK or US, had their final television and movie scenes together in ""Five Daughters""/""Karate Killers"". Good or bad, ""Five Daughters""/""The Karate Killers"", represented a bit of personal history played out in public. The starry-eyed young couple from ten years earlier did their best to keep the British ""stiff upper lip"" attitude on film.

Fourth Season Movies:
""The Helicopter Spies"" was an expanded version of ""The Prince of Darkness Affair"", and featured guests Bradford Dillman, Carol Lynley, John Carradine, John Dehner, and Julie London.

""How To Steal The World"", the final feature film, was adapted from the final episode of the series, ""The Seven Wonders of the World Affair"". In addition to Leslie Nielsen as mentioned in the earlier review, guest stars included Barry Sullivan, Eleanor Parker, and Dan O'Herlihy (Marcel Rudolph in ""Fiddlesticks"" and Capt. Morton in ""Yo-Ho-Ho"").

For Vaughn's and McCallum's enduring assorted psycho villains; gun-wielding grandfatherish gangsters; scenes blatantly snagged by Bond films; disasterous scripting; and a few real life disasters, to quote Mr. Waverly's words to his agents at the end of ""Seven Wonders"", ""Good job, gentlemen.""",1322265600,,5860,5.146161934805468
435408,5,6302181631,"As an UNCLE fan from the beginning, I can clearly remember the stir the first two films ""To Trap A Spy"" and ""The Spy With My Face"" created when they were released in the movies.  Released during the later part of the series' first season when UNCLE was already becoming a sensation, I can remember standing on a long line on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn, waiting to see them at the Loews Kings, a Golden-Age movie palace.  Later when they got to my local theater, I went again and spent an entire afternoon watching them over and over.
""To Trap a Spy"" is the UNCLE pilot ""The Vulcan Affair"" with some additional footage added featuring Lucianna Paluzzi, soon to be featured in the Bond epic ""Thunderball.""  ""The Spy With My Face"" is based on the great first season episode ""The Double Affair"" featuring 2 Napoleon Solos.  There was additional footage added as well.  Both were in color, while the first season of UNCLE was broadcast in black and white.  (Not that it mattered to me since we only had a black and white TV anyway.)  The success of these films created a demand for more UNCLE films.  The third film was the second season opener ""The Alexander the Greater Affair,"" now entitled ""One Spy Too Many.""  There was nothing new added to this 2 part episode and it basically played as the bottom part of an MGM double feature.  Never one of my favorites, it was the last UNCLE film to be released theatrically in the U.S.
The next three UNCLE films were total mediocrities,the last two based on episodes from UNCLE's horrendous third (camp) season.
The last two films ""The Helicoptor Spies"" and ""How To Steal The World"" are based on two 2 parters from UNCLE's abbreviated 4th (great) season.  I like ""The Helicoptor Spies"" better, based on a tremendous 2 parter ""The Prince of Darkness Affair"" and featuring a great cast including Bradford Dillman, Carol Lynley and a very hot Lola Albright.""  The last film ""How to Steal the World"" is based on UNCLE's final episode, ""The Seven Wonders of the World Affair.""  This also featured a terrifc cast including Leslie Nielsen, Barry Sullivan and Eleanor Parker.
This set is definitely worth getting for the first two films and the last two.  You might enjoy parts of the middle four films, however they were never favorites of mine taking place during the camp period that eventually killed this great series prematurely.
But just watching the first two ""To Trap A Spy"" and ""The Spy With My Face"" brings me back to a period when UNCLE seriously rivaled James Bond in popularity (and Bond was pretty damn popular with ""Goldfinger"" and ""Thunderball"" in release.)  I can't wait to watch these films again.",1321488000,,2649,4.691144708423326
435409,3,6302181631,"Watching these 8 movies made from episodes of the TV series must be watched like episodes of the TV series, a little at a time, as the movies can quickly be looked at as overkill.  They are monotonous, implausible and strictly juvenile.  Remembering watching the series as a kid?  Well, they have not aged well.  M-G-M hired a whole lot of talent for these including Joan Crawford, Janet Leigh, Senta Berger, Jack Palance, Patricia Crowley, Luciana Paluzzi, Eleanor Parker, Herbert Lom, Kim Darby, Vera Miles, Maurice Evans, Carol Lynley, Telly Savalas and many more and the series starred Robert Vaughn and David McCallum.  The writing is formulaic and tends to be pretty good, sometimes making the implausible and melodramatic seem natural.  The entire set has no star directors or crew except ""The Helicopter Spies"" was directed by Boris Sagal the director of Ann-Margret's ""Made in Paris,"" Elvis's ""Girl Happy"" and Charlton Heston's cult classic, ""The Omega Man.""  But it is a nice package to have all of these movies in one place and they are given glowing treatment by Warner Archive.  One can not give them enough kudos for their bringing what they do back to life.  The first few ""U.N.C.L.E."" movies are of a higher believability as they go on ending with some more tedious than others.  The first double feature played in Plainfield, New Jersey at our local theater, ""To Trap a Spy"" and ""The Spy with My Face,"" but the others probably only played overseas where they were basically intended.  Perhaps you should remember them with a certain reverence.  I think it best you consult your wallet first.  The set includes trailers.",1320192000,,1636,4.905454545454545
435410,3,6302181631,"""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" was a dramatic TV series that ran on NBC from 1964 until 1968 and produced in excess of 100 eps. Arguable the most famous episodes and the one that has gone down in history as being the most popular of the series is this one, ""The Five Daughter Affairs"" (parts 1 and 2, respectively).

These episodes originally aired on March 31, 1967 and on April 7, 1967. This VHS includes the 2 eps, they are uncut and the original eps, in color and a total of 98 minutes in length.

The reason why this is such a hot item is because it stars Hollywood legend, Joan Crawford as Mrs. Amanda True. As usual, Joan looks amazing and totally dazzling. It really is hard to believe that she had been acting for more than 45 years prior.

Like most Joan Crawford performances, this one is not without (high) drama. Amanda makes her grand entrance and in typical Joan Crawford fashion starts howling at the top of her lungs about something. It reminds me a little bit of ""Strait-Jacket."" And I loved every second of it.

Although this IS a TV show (that Joan doesn't have a very big part in), Joan Crawford fans know it best as a ""movie."" As it often shows up in her film listings and filmographies. But it is not a movie in the conventional sense at all. The ""movie"" was released to a limited engagement overseas under the auspicious title ""The Karate Killers."" In the US, so as not to compete with the TV series it was not released as a feature film. But it's just these 2 eps that were slapped together and put out, like many of the other U.N.C.L.E. ""movies.""

The basic plot is about the daughters of a late scientist who discover a way to ""extract gold from seawater."" My goodness this can only happen in the '60s. It's almost like ""The Twilight Zone"" meets ""Dynasty.""

OK the plot is rather paltry, but watch it for the great Joan Crawford performance. There's also lots of other stars in it, including Telly Savalas. And get a load of that ""back to the future"" car that the 2 agents drive in the beginning. So retro.

Joan made a slew of pictures during the last 10 years of her career, all with lots of acclaim, most of which are now considered cult-favorites that catapulted her to scream queen status as the hardest working actress in showbiz with the most versatile repertoire.

Below is a list of all of Joan's last major theatrical appearances on film and TV:

What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?  (1962)
laser disc / VHS / DVD / special edition DVD

The Caretakers (1963)
VHS

Strait-Jacket (1964)
VHS, DVD

Della aka Fatal Confinement or Royal Bay (1964)
VHS - released twice, under the first 2 title on VHS, at 2 different times

I Saw What You Did (1965)
VHS, DVD

The Man From U. N. C. L. E.: The Five Daughters Affair aka The Karate Killers #(1967)
VHS and DVD (as part of a set)

Berserk! (1968)
laser disc, VHS

Night Gallery: Eyes (1969)
VHS and DVD (as part of a set)

The Virginian:  Nightmare (1970)
not released on any format

Trog (1970)**
VHS, DVD

The Name of the Game: Los Angeles 2017 (1971)
not released on any format

The Sixth Sense: Dear Joan: We're Going to Scare You to Death (1972)
not released, although a DVD set is in the tentative future

** Joan did not make any other feature film movies in the '70s (after ""Trog""). Contrary to many reports, she did not appear in a 1972 movie ""Beyond the Water's Edge"" (it's also highly likely the that movie was never even produced)

# Incidentally has anyone ever seen a commercial home-video release (from any country) on any format of this ""movie"" by the title ""The Karate Killers?"" As far as I know no such release exists as a home-video release under this title as it was only put out briefly in Europe in first-run theaters.

""The Man From U. N. C. L. E."" was a rather ludicrous story with a flimsy plot that everyone could see right through. Most of the bit players and other actresses were so funny because their acting (or lack of) was so awful. But that was par for the course in just about any of Joan's later movies. As Joan ironically said in ""Berserk!,"" ""it's becoming a nightmare."" But love her or not, you cannot deny that no matter what she did (either a 5-star picture for MGM such as ""Grand Hotel"" or ""Letty Lynton"") or a B-movie that she made overseas because she couldn't find any other offers the girl always gave 110% and acted as if she was giving a first-rate Academy Award winning performance.",1258502400,,4400,4.422552664188352
435411,3,6302181631,"Volume 5 has episodes ""The Off-Broadway Affair"" and ""The Take Me To Your Leader Affair"", both which appeared on Man from UNCLE's third season. The Man from UNCLE series is one of my favorite TV series ever to watch! But I must confess, these episodes do not have great plot (thus the 3 stars) but still I love the episodes! Lots of funny parts! The main characters are Napoleon Solo (Robert Vaughn, ""Bullit"" and ""The Magnificent Seven"") and favorite the enigmatic and quiet Russian, Illya Kuryakin played to perfection by actor David McCallum (another great movie with him is ""The Great Escape"").
Episode 69 ""The Off-Broadway Affair"": When an off-broadway actress is killed after trying to contact UNCLE, Napoleon Solo (Robert Vaughn) and Illya Kuryakin (David McCallum) are sent to investigate. They feel that the murdered actress had information about how THRUSH has recently been getting information through UNCLE's main computers. With the help of understudy, Janet Jarrod (Shari Lewis), they go up against THRUSH agents Machina (Leon Askin) and Linda (Joan Huntington) before anymore of UNCLE's valuable information is stolen. * A so-so episode with fun Shari Lewis, who I'm sure everyone knows her from her TV show, ""Lamb Chops"". We get to see her sing ""All God's Children Have Rhythm"" and watch her perform the song ""Stand Up and March"". And what a surprise, we get to see David McCallum perform his own show ""A Man is a Horn"" while he is working undercover! Lots of funny lines throughout the whole show, my favorite is in the beginning where Illya says, ""I seems a trifle unfair Napoleon. You get to dally around with a lush, young actress while I go prowling around in a dirty basement."" But the reason this episode is so-so is because of some parts in the plot which were pretty stupid.
Episode 75 ""The Take Me to Your Leader Affair"": Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin are sent to scientist Adrian Cool's (Woodrow Parfrey) whose instruments are pointing out that a UFO is approaching the earth! When his daughter, Coco (Nancy Sinatra, the great Frank Sinatra's daughter), is kidnapped along with Illya by power-mad millionaire Simon Sparrow (Paul Lambert), it's up to Napoleon Solo to learn why. With the help of Corinne (Whitney Blake), Napoleon learns that Sparrow is going had faked the approaching UFO to secure power for himself. * Another episode which lacks plot, I still love it for some really great parts. UNCLE regular Woodrow Parfey this time gets to play the good guy. I really like all the parts with Illya and Coco. Coco flirts a lot and gets to kiss him! And for David McCallum fans, I'm sure you'll be interested to find that he gets to play the guitar, plus perform a duet with Sinatra the song which he wrote himself! And, of course, not only does Illya get the girl, Napoleon gets his own girl, the very pretty Whitney Blake.",1012521600,,2855,4.804878048780488
435412,5,6302181631,"""The Foxes and Hounds Affair"" and ""The Discotheque Affair"" are what I think are UNCLE's 2nd season best, besides ""The Deadly Toys Affair"", ""The Dippy Blonde Affair"", and ""The Minus X Affair"".
Episode 33 ""The Foxes and Hounds Affair"": Illya Kuryakin (David McCallum) tries to obtain a thought-reading device from a magician but when they do, he and his companion are separated while Victor Marton (Vincent Price) and his THRUSH thugs are chasing them in Europe. Illya gets back to New York safely but his companion, who has the device tries to come back to New York through another route. Alexander Waverly (Leo G. Carroll) sends Napoleon Solo (Robert Vaughn) out as a decoy for Marton and his THRUSH rival Lucia Belmont (Patricia Medina), without Napoleon having a clue of what's going on! Mimi Doolittle (Julie Sommars), the magician's assistand is drawn into the wild goose chase. While Illya chooses a destination in which the agent carrying the device can land in New York, Napoleon and Mimi are captured. Soon Illya is also captured. Can THRUSH get information out of Illya to find the device? * A definite five-star episode!! Illya and Napoleon are terrific, getting great lines and get to do a lot. One of my favorite scenese is the fight at the funeral house where Illya accidentally punches Napoleon!
Episode 34 ""The Discotheque Affair"": While UNCLE is trying to find a load of THRUSH records hidden under a discotheque, The Bealer's, THRUSH plants a listening device in the apartment next to Alexander Waverly's office. Because Napoleon's arm is broken, Illya is put in charge of the section two's involvement in infiltrating the discotheque and Napoleon is assigned to take care of a rent dispute with a tenant, Sandy Wyler (Judi West). In her apartment, he finds the device. As UNCLE feeds out false information to the planted listening device, Illya infiltrates the discotheque, run by THRUSH agent Vincent Carver (Ray Danton), posing as a musician. Carver tells Tiger Ed (Harvey Lembeck) to kill Carver's girlfriends, Farina (Evelyn Ward), but Napoleon rescues her and she helps him, only to switch sides again. * Another great episode!! I always enjoy hearing Illya and Napoleon banter. Illya looks pretty cool in this episode when he poses as a musician, wearing a white turtleneck, a reddish suit, and dark sunglasses. Well, actually, he looks cool whenever he appears!! I also like all the dancing they do at the discotheque.
UNCLE rules!! If you love ""Man from UNCLE"", don't forget to watch these episodes!!",999302400,,2526,5.002375296912114
435413,4,6302181631,"A groovy two-parter to wrap up the third and campiest season of MFU, ""The Five Daughters Affair"" is the tale of a dying scientist who has developed the formula for turning seawater into gold.  He sends the clues to the formula to his daughter and four stepdaughters, all born to Mommie Dearest herself, the shrike-like matriarch Joan Crawford (kudos to the casting director--she's a natural!  Yikes!).  This quest takes Solo and Illya literally around the world:  Sandy (Kim Darby) in the States; Margo (Diane McBain) in Italy (and married to Telly Savalas); Imogen (Jill Ireland) in London (who is arrested for indecent exposure by constable Terry-Thomas); and Yvonne (Danielle DeMetz) in Switzerland (in the throes of passion with sugardaddy Curt Jurgens).  The fifth daughter, incidentally, is only referenced for a brief moment.
However, the plot, while somewhat repetitious (especially during the first part, since all the daughters are visited by UNCLE just before THRUSH arrives), is entertaining and filled with slapstick comedy.  It's a light one, for the days when you don't want to have to think about anything.  Not too much substance, but sometimes that's okay.",993513600,,1174,5.245989304812834
