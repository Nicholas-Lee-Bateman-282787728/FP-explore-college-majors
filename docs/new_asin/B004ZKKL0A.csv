4509562,5,B004ZKKL0A,"Shout Factory continues to release the works from Director Roger Corman's New World Pictures where young directors were able to refine and mature their talents working in low budget conditions but receiving expert training to go on to the major studios. Because of hearing about the success of Director Jesus Franco's '99 WOMEN'-1969, writer/director Jack Hill pitched an idea to Roger Corman to do a woman in prison film of their own.  Corman arranged to have the film made in the Phillipines where at that time they could get away with much more than by shooting it in the states.  The rest was legend:  'THE BIG DOLL HOUSE' -1971 went on to incredible business making a star our of newcomer Pam Grier and elevated Jack Hill to cult action director status. The film , however ,was not the first to show tough women on the screen.  Countless teenage fifties girl gang films leading up to Director Russ Meyer's classic 'FASTER, PUSSYCAT, KILL KILL'- 1965 is proof of that.  'DOLL HOUSE' was the first to show a gang of women struggling to survive within the prison system. Nine times out of ten, the main actress was incarcerated by accident or deliberately  and spends the films running time revealing her innocence and taking the other girls with her. It was responsible for countless imitations from Director Don Edmond's 'ILSA- SHE WOLF OF THE SS'-1974 and it sequels plus may have influenced the Nazi Exploitation films which came from Italy in the late seventies.  It also showed the underrated acting ability of Sid Haig who would be resurrected in the Rob Zombie duet 'HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES'-2003 and 'THE DEVIL'S REJECTS'-2005 and Roberta Collins who's matter of fact acting styles elevated the films to classic status . This collection contains the first three films which came out of the box office explosion of 'DOLL HOUSE'S' success.  Each film has been released before in box sets and individually.  I have not yet seen this release but I do have the box set that New World released in 2004 'PAM GRIER: UNLEASHED' which contains these three films along with her 1973 Roman epic guilty pleasure, Director Steve Carver's 'ARENA'-1973.  The transfers are full screen and beautiful so Shout Factory may have the same transfers or may have improved on them.  Hopefully, they also will retain the excellent audio commentary tracks by Director Jack Hill on both 'DOLL HOUSE' and its sequel 'THE BIG BIRD CAGE'-1972. The commentaries really give you an excellent behind the scenes look at location filmmaking and working and surviving in primitive conditions.  'WOMEN IN CAGES'-1971 was released immediately after the success of 'DOLL HOUSE' where actresses from the film decided to stay on in the Phillipines and you'll notice that Pam Grier goes from heroine to villain as the prison commandant.  It is directed by Gerry De Leon who made some great cult classics such as 'TERROR IS A MAN'-1959 and was behind the scenes on the infamous 'BLOOD ISLAND' trilogy all made in the Phillipines. 'THE BIG BIRD CAGE' was made to continue the success of the first one and utilizes model Anitra Ford in the lead along with Pam. It contains more over the top sequences such as the simulated sex and rape scene of the gay prison guard which was incredibly daring for its time and just shows what liberties the filmmakers took with the genre. Director Hill directs so excellently that both films could easily be seen as a 3 hour epic. Where 'WOMEN IN CAGES' lacks humor and has more grisly moments in the torture department, its Jack Hill's stamp of humor and innovative direction that made his films groundbreaking in portraying women in tough situations and paved the way for female vigilante and super buffed babe films to come including 'SWITCHBLADE SISTERS'-1975. There was also a women in prison revival in the early eighties utilizing actresses Linda Blair and Sybil Danning but they never reached the exploitive heights of these three classics. Those films will have a future release.  Knowing Shout Factory's past releases, this box set comes highly recommended if you have not yet seen these wonderful time capsules of low budget filmmaking.  Watch Pam in her prime before she made 'COFFY'- 1973,'FOXY BROWN'-1974 both by Jack Hill and Director Quentin Tarrantino's 'JACKIE BROWN'-1997 and makes you see what all the fuss was about.

4509600,5,B004ZKKL0A,"These are the films that started the Women In Prison (WIP) craze, so, I'll review one of the first, THE BIG DOLL HOUSE (1971):

This film, along with THE BIG BIRD CAGE (1972; both directed by Jack Hill), has the distinction of kick-starting the 70's WIP (women in prison) craze. Tough-as-nails Marnie Collier (Judy Brown) is sent to a ""Banana Republic"" prison (actually lensed in the Philippines) for 99 years on a false murder conviction. After being thoroughly searched in every orifice, she is thrown in a dingy cell with Alcott (Roberta Collins), Harrad (Brooke Mills), Bodine (Pat Woodell) and lesbian Grear (Pam Grier), who takes an instant shine to Collier. The prison's female warden, Miss Dietrich (Christiane Schmidtmer), is a Bible-quoting she-b**** who's not above murder to keep her prisoners in line. Bodine plans on escaping after she gets a smuggled-in letter from her revolutionary boyfriend telling her that he needs her badly, but someone snitches to Miss Dietrich about the letter and she has Bodine tortured, first by suspending her in a small bamboo cage in the blazing sun and then bringing her to a dungeon, where she is waterboarded and whipped by brutal head guard Lucian (Kathryn Loder) while some unknown person watches in the shadows. Bodine is brought back to her cell bloody and bruised, now even more determined to escape and join her boyfriend. Two black marketeers, Harry (Sid Haig) and his new partner Fred (Jerry Franks), make weekly trips to the prison and supply the women prisoners with a wide range of goods, including drugs, cigarettes and smuggled information, but it all comes with a price, mainly sex. When Miss Dietrich catches Alcott having sex with the inexperienced Fred, she becomes the next torture victim in the dungeon. Alcott is shocked with electricity by Lucian (she attaches electrodes to Alcott's breasts and private parts) while the same unknown person watches in the shadows. The girls put their differences aside and plan an escape, using a cat and the unwitting duo of Harry and Fred in their attempt. It almost comes undone when junkie Harrad stabs Grear in the neck in a fit of jealous rage, killing her. Collier is then tortured with a cobra by Lucian in the dungeon, but Alcott, Bodine and Ferrina (Gina Stuart) rescue her, overpower Lucian and discover the identity of the person hiding in the shadows (it's Miss Dietrich, who gets her sexual jollies by watching prisoners tortured and killed!). The girls then break out of prison, but not everyone will escape with their lives. During the fatalistic, yet strangely satisfying, conclusion, all the women are either killed or recaptured, but not before Miss Dietrich receives her just rewards.  This thoroughly sadistic, yet highly watchable, exploitationer delivers the goods, thanks to the cast of beautiful female genre vets and the  expert direction of Jack Hill, who also gave us such low-budget classics like SPIDER BABY (1964), COFFY (1973), FOXY BROWN (1974) and SWITCHBLADE SISTERS (1975). Hill only directed a handful of films in his career, yet he always seemed to know what audiences wanted: Namely, copious amounts of nudity and plenty of violence. THE BIG DOLL HOUSE doesn't disappoint, as every female in the cast has at least one nude scene (including a boner-inducing fight between Roberta Collins and Pam Grier in a mud pit) and loads of mind-boggling violence, usually by the hands of Lucian in her torture dungeon. This was one of Roger Corman's earliest hits for his New World Pictures production outfit (both Corman and Cirio H. Santiago are uncredited producers) and it's easy to see why. Besides Jack Hill's direction, the cast gives their all here, stripping-off their clothes, getting into catfights and, finally, working together to escape their hellhole. It's no wonder this film spawned countless other WIP flicks. It's well-made, violent (some of the torture devices are downright bizarre), exciting and, surprisingly, contains some real human drama. One of the earliest WIP movies to take advantage of the R-rating and still one of the best. Pam Grier sings the opening tune, ""Long Time Woman"". John Ashley and Eddie Romero were the Executive Producers. Also starring Jack Davis and Letty Mirasol. Available on THE WOMEN IN CAGES COLLECTION, a collection of three films on 2 DVDs, also including THE BIG BIRD CAGE (1972) and WOMEN IN CAGES (1971), released by Shout! Factory. Rated R.",1416355200,5,4430,5.065753424657534

4509604,3,B004ZKKL0A,"The Big Doll House (1971)

A little slow at times but full of hot eye candy. Seriously.  These women are just too beautiful for prison, lol.  Filming seems better quality than the other two flicks.  This is easily the best of the 3 in my opinion.  A gorgeous redhead is found guilty of killing her husband and finds herself in a medieval looking prison sharing a cell with a handful of other gorgeous barbies.... all wear short nightie-like prison uniforms, of course.  The newbie becomes lesbian Grear's (Pam Grier) little bitch... but the lesbianism doesn't really come through.  Nothing really intimate passes.  Of course they are consistently harassed by the sadistic and flat-chested head guard... who pulls her hair down every time she slips into evil mode, lol.  Lots of comical scenes with the two men who come in regularly to sell the inmates food and cigs.  Eventually an escape plan is hatched and all hell breaks loose.  The ending was hilarious.  No graphic sex portrayed.  One guy is raped by a woman... sorta.  Tons of topless women and some get felt up and fondled.

Women in Cages (1971)

This one is darker than The Big Doll House.  Lots of abrupt transitions from scene to scene.  A pretty blond American is set up by her shady boyfriend and gets 10 yrs in a grimy little prison.  Alabama (Pam Grier) is the evil and sadistic lesbian head guard who basically runs the prison and enjoys torturing and molesting her hot inmates.  One cell full of hot barbies is her special focus... they backstab and betray each other but ultimately plan an escape together.  Loved seeing pretty redhead Judy Brown (Sandy) and pretty blond Roberta Collins (Stokes) again... a lot of the same cast are in all 3 flicks.  Pam Grier is poorly cast as the head guard.  Doesn't quite wield the leadership and power as well as in some of her later flicks.  No actual sex portrayed, graphically.  Just suggested really.  Including a couple of gang rapes.  Nude shower scenes and tons of topless girls, as usual.  Always a muddy pond available for a catfight.

The Big Bird Cage (1972)

Set in a tropical place somewhere... a couple of kooky and misguided revolutionaries (Pam Grier and Sid Haig) set out to free the inmates at a women's prison.  Here all the inmates are braless and wear short shorts.  No cells and bars, just little huts out in the jungle.  And lots of hard labor.  This one isn't about lesbians and sadistic head guards at all, surprisingly.  The guards are amusing gay boys, though.  Pretty silly and random on the whole and not too far from soft porn with all the braless eye candy.  We actually get Pam Grier doing a little singing in the opening.  No graphic sex is portrayed.  Lots of topless women, as usual.  Always a muddy pond available for a catfight.  One female frontal by a woman covered in chicken fat on the run (naked, she's too slippery to catch!)... one possible gang rape on a woman (not sure what that was, really)... and one definite gang rape on a dude, lol... you can't take much of the violence in this seriously, though.  I mean, one inmate is hung all day by her ponytail...",1407196800,2,3112,4.624542124542124

4509610,5,B004ZKKL0A,"""The Big Doll House"" is a classic women's prison films of all time. Jack Hill had it going on with his directing style. Pam Grier, Roberta Collins, Judy Brown, and many others did an excellent job on the film. I loved the commentary from Jack Hill.

""The Big Bird Cage"" is another classic women's prison film. This one had Anitra Ford from the Price Is Right. She was a great addition for this film. Pam Grier was awesome. There was another commentary from Jack Hill. There was also a documentary about the film as well.

""Women In Cages"" missed the boat. It had great ideas but it didn't have a great plot. Overall it was an average women's prison film.",1380585600,2,654,4.441666666666666

4509642,4,B004ZKKL0A,"These three early seventies films also introduced us to Pam Grier's acting debut, ans she kept the ""Badd*ss Cinema"" and the ""Soul Cinema"" dramas alive throughout the mid seventies on on-ward.

Though these films look a little grainy, they still look mastered very well for their time.  I'm hoping these ""Women in Prison"" films continue to be released.  Like for instance, my favorite ""Women in Prison"" film that features Pam Grier is ""Black Mama, White Mama"" which also includes Sig Haig as the typical Sleazeball that works for this genre.  Plus, back in 1981, there's this one called ""Sadomania"", with alot of sweaty hot topless blonde prisoners.  This one was very close to foreign softcore porn.

And check this out: This 3 movie box set is released by The Shout Factory!  Even though Rhino has released some films onto DVD, they still haven't released any Blu-Ray films yet.  So, Kudos to The Shout Factory for getting into releasing Blu-Ray films!

It would be nice if The Shout Factory would release another Pam Grier Trilogy, or even a larger box set.  How about ""Black Mama, White Mama"", ""Coffy"", and ""Foxy Brown?""  This would be a great ""Soul Cinema"" Collection.

Recently, The Shout Factory released the 14 episode series of ""Max Headroom"" on to DVD.  It would be great if The Shout Factory remastered those episodes and re-released ""Max Headroom"" onto Blu-Ray.

And Hey, how about the 45 episode box set of ""Monty Python's Flying Circus?""

Yeah, I know I drifted here, but for The Shout Factory, (who may be reading this), I thought that I would just throw that in!",1315094400,6,1577,4.810408921933085
4509643,4,B004ZKKL0A,"For fans of '70s exploitation and women-in-prison flicks, Shout Factory's ""Women in Cages"" collection is a fun diversion that is well-assembled. We get three Roger Corman films from 1971-72 all shot in the Phillipines starring Pam Grier and other nubile honeys.

""The Big Doll House"" features lots of torture scenes, fun performances from slimy Sid Haig (his scenes with Grier are priceless), and an almost unrecognizable Pat Woodell (the original Bobbie-Jo from the black-and-white ""Petticoat Junction"").

The best of the trilogy is ""The Big Bird Cage"" which throws more humor into the mix and the result is even more entertaining. The gay Phillipino prison guards are hysterical, as is the way the women shamelessly proclaim their sexual frustration (When they finally do get their hands on a man, he's forced at knifepoint to ""Get it up, or I'll cut it off!""). The dialogue in this one just gets better with lines like """"You can't rape me, I love sex"" and ""Never mind the crotch cooties...they have to eat too!"". And when an inmate slathers chicken fat all over her naked body so she can literally slip past the guards, ""The Big Bird Cage"" soars into camp movie heaven!

""Women In Cages"" has Pam Grier in Sybil Danning-mode as the evil prison matron, rather than an inmate, and the results are not as good. The film seems to suffer from a smaller budget too, and despite encore performances from Roberta Collins and Judy Brown, isn't as fun as the first two flicks. I'd recommend watching ""Women in Cages"" first and saving the earlier but superior flicks til last.

There's a lengthy documentary about all three films featuring interviews with many of the actors and actresses that is worthwhile viewing as well as original trailers and TV spots. The picture quality is very good. They've done as best as possible with the original elements, but there are a few blotches on the prints here and there.

If you love bad movies from the early '70s with lots of poisonous snakes, catfights, mud wrestling and pre-silicone boobies, this collection is for you!",1310860800,31,2057,4.882521489971347
4509644,5,B004ZKKL0A,"This 2-disc bargain offers two great Jack Hill classics--1971's THE BIG DOLL HOUSE, 1972's THE BIG BIRD CAGE and both feature commentary tracks by Hill (recorded about a decade ago) and a third film, WOMEN IN CAGES, that was shot in-between those two films (but by Gerry DeLeon, not Hill). BIRD CAGE and WIC share a disc while DOLL HOUSE is on another DVD with a wonderful new documentary, FROM MANILA WITH LOVE that features brand new interviews with writer/director Jack Hill, screenwriter James Gordon White, producers Roger Corman and Jane Schaffer and actors from both films including Sid Haig, Judy Brown, Anitra Ford, Roberta Collins, Candice Roman and Teda Bracci. Sadly, Pam Grier does not take part in the documentary. There is also one other special feature: a solo interview with Judy Brown (this set does not contain Leonard Maltin's interviews with Roger Corman).

All three films are presented in anamorphic widescreen. A note in an insert says that ""Two separate film elements were used to put together a complete version of THE BIG BIRD CAGE--a CRI and the original negative, which had been cut at some point."" Both DOLL HOUSE and BIRD CAGE look and sound sensational.

On the other hand, WOMEN IN CAGES (which reunited three of DOLL HOUSE's cast members--Grier, Judy Brown and Roberta Collins, but appears to have been shot with an even smaller budget and without any of the style Jack Hill brought to his two films) has muddy sound. The same booklet warns, ""We used the only available source material for the audio on WOMEN IN CAGES, which was not in pristine condition. Much of the audio for these films shot in the Philippines was done later in post production, as you'll find that not all lip movements match the dialogue."" WOMEN is the least fun of the trio. It does boast an over-the-top, nasty-as-hell villain performance by Pam Grier (in just her second role), but while the two Hill productions are beautiful to look at and take full advantage of shooting in the tropical paradise, WOMEN keeps its shots claustrophobic and close. The few outdoor shots are usually shot at night or  nearing dawn (with smoke effects to further mask the cheap budget). One whole action sequence on the beach near the end is shot in silhouette, which makes it impossible to even see which of the women is being chased and shot at.  There's such a lack of location footage that you'd almost think it was shot on a NY backlot! WOMEN plays almost like a horror film with Pam's torture chamber almost like out of a German S/M porn film.

But the reason to buy this set is the beautiful prints of BIG DOLL HOUSE and BIG BIRD CAGE and Jack Hill's informative commentaries (did you know that DOLL HOUSE's delicious villain, Barbara Loder, became ill and lapsed into a coma while making the film? She was finally diagnosed as being diabetic and was treated and came out of her coma to finish the film. She looks scary-thin in the film, but she's a wonderful villain--just as she would be a couple years later in FOXY BROWN). Both films are action-packed and have a sense of humor about themselves (especially BIRD CAGE, which is really a parody of DOLL HOUSE). These are not ""so bad that they're good"" movies...these are actually well-made, action-packed adventures with strong female characters. And they all show just how quickly Pam Grier was able to turn herself into a star with vibrant screen presence. Enjoy!",1309651200,30,3414,4.779661016949152
4509645,5,B004ZKKL0A,"All I can say is ""this is exploitation heaven!"". To me these Roger Corman drive-in classics are what prison flicks are all about! Shout has done one terrific job on this two disc triple feature. The three films are finally anamorphic widescreen and look great (especially Big Doll House) and this is a fantastic package! Always have enjoyed low budget drive in classics from the 70s, but these are the icing on the cake!! Women in Prison flicks from early 70s have always been my guilty pleasure.
The special features are numerous (love the from Manila with love doc.) for Big Doll House. Big Bird Cage has audio commentary from Jack Hill, trailers. Women in Cages only has trailer. But all in all, this is worth picking up if you enjoy these Pam Grier classics. Can't wait for the blu rays!",1308787200,15,791,4.617021276595745
8450042,4,B004ZKKL0A,"Enjoyed this. Attractive girls, acting is good, but I see a trend with Pam Grier in her movies: She likes to cover up in the nude scenes.  Some of her nude scenes are a tease---Why does she keep her arms folded, covering up in the shower scene ? Other scenes show her lost in a crowd of men, barely showing her.",1519430400,,311,4.098360655737705

8450047,3,B004ZKKL0A,"It was difficult to watch these 3 85-90 minute movies over a 3 day period.  And I saved -- what is probably the best of the three movies in this very mediocre (at best) collection -- THE BIG BIRD CAGE for last.  I still have not finished watching BIRD CAGE because I just know this Jack Hill directed women's raunchy, gritty prison movie that is not supposed to be taken too seriously (you know, I think I get it) will not get much better.  If you want to laugh at the bad acting that's ok because, apparently, that is supposed to be part of the fun?  I don't buy it.  I believe the dialogue is too often not good because the writing is not good which leads to the lazy performances -- even when lesbian prison ""Matron"" Pam Grier is saying to prisoner bitch-lover: ""Oh, so you wanna' play rough...?""  because prisoner had the nerve -- while in the Matrons love nest -- to bite her shoulder causing psycho warden bitch (Grier) to promptly grab her whip and start demonstrating it's lashing namesake.  And this scene, somehow, comes across uninspired and lazy with some horrible editing (wait...!  Who's on top...?  that's not who just climbed into the bed...)  I laughed at how violent this, somehow, did NOT look.
Yes, I expected my drive-in, border line smut to be radical and outrageous ... not just be thankful the actresses agreed to do this because they got paid (or maybe they didn't get paid...enough).

All of these movies have Pam Grier in them and she has some amazingly broad soldiers for a long, full figured woman but her rear nude scenes had me surprised she was not ""hotter looking"" at such a young, tender age.  I'm nitpicking, yes.  Judy Brown is in two of these prison epics (ha) and she is attractive enough with Director Jack Hill loving her naked nipple shots while Roberta Collins is more impressive in a naked shower scene where she knows a man is watching.  But, damn, what the hell was she doing (Roberta C.) with her acting mannerisms right after her character becomes a badass chick after kicking some ass.  Her naturalistic acting is/was laughable.  I actually said to the tv:  ""What the Bleep is she doing (and the ""Laugh"" followed).
The actress who played ""Herrod"" is the only female actress in this entire thing who acquitted (ha, pun intended considering prison flicks) herself at all.  She played a heroin addict in, um, THE BIG DOLL HOUSE (there is a drug addict in all 3 movies; and a newbie or ""new fish""; and the evil prison Matron or Warden...they certainly blend together).  Her real name is Brooke Mills.
Sid Haig is only mediocre to slightly funny in what -- I'm pretty sure -- is truly supposed to be a comic relief role.
Oh, and Anitra Ford from The Price is Right (from what I've seen of ""the big bird cage"") gives one of the better performances.  That just might tell you something about the quality of these Corman, drive-in 'special' movies.
Almost surprised I gave this three stars.  There is commentary by many involved in the making of the BIG BIRD CAGE.

I did enjoy hearing Pam Grier say to Sid Haig, ""You gonna' do IT through the bars?!"" As he is feeling her up.
Also, Roberta Collins in ""heat"" after her shower scene for the ""man"" saying, ""Get it up, or I cut it off!""

postscript:  After completing my viewing of the third (THE BIG BIRD CAGE) of this triple feature of drive-in exploitation I have come to the conclusion Jack Hill was not a good Director.  I'm blaming him for most of the lackluster performances (He directed Pam Grier in Foxy Brown and Coffey a couple years later, to mediocre results for Grier).  But, pretty much all these girls (young ladies) come across like they were grabbed from behind their secretaries desk and asked to act in a movie.  Oh, wait, that IS how Pam Grier was found.  Well, it shows but at least now we know Grier was just ""honing"" those acting chop skills.
Bu the way Pam plays the Revolutionary in BIG BIRD CAGE and despite that forced dialogue she is just so easy to watch, I suppose, for very obvious potentials and reasons.",1485820800,3,4023,4.534626038781163
