1736591,2,B00006ADFS,"Im here rating ""The legend of The Swordsman"" wich is actually ""Buena Vista Home Vid"" DVD version of a great movie called ""SwordsmanII""...
First of all, A LOT of dialogues just disappeared, scenes were cut and combat sounds effects RUINED ! ! ! I guess thats what happens when u ask a spanish comapny to re-do a HK classical movie.

1736592,1,B00006ADFS,"Legend of Swordsman dvd review - dreadful, dubbed, cut, americanised, renamed, new dreadful audio track, poor disc = do not buy this version! (buy Swordsman 2)
film review - Swordsman 2 was Jet Li's largest grossing domestic film in Hong Kong in the early 90's, even outperforming Fist of Legend and the Once Upon a Time in China Series. Although the cast is very similar to the Once Upon a Time in China series due to the Tsui Hark influence (Jet Li, Yen Shi Kwan, etc). The only cast member from the original Swordsman (King Hu classic 90) is the gorgeous Fannie Yuen (Blue Phoenix).
The wire-fu fighting and fantastical set make this an enchanting film, and the costumes are award-winning. This is not Jet's best film in my opinion, but is right up there with his best.
Conclusion - get Swordsman 2 (Megastar), get an HK import - do anything but buy this butchered version that pays no respect to the culture or ethos from which this movie emerged.",1049068800,11,951,4.6
1736593,1,B00006ADFS,"Another instance of a perfectly good HK film being unnecessarily hacked up, repackaged, reformatted, and retitled for American audiences. The entire run of the ""Jet Li Collection"" DVDs are just plain awful in terms of everything except image quality. Buena Vista (Disney/Mirmax) regularly cuts a considerable amount of footage out of the original movies, rescores them, and for some bizarre reason refuses to offer the option of subtitles, only a very cheesy English Dub. No widescreen option, either. I would recommend avoiding ALL foreign DVDs distributed by Buena Vista, because you are getting an incomplete, censored, altered, and improperly titled version of the film by a company just trying to milk a hot trend for quick cash.
In the particular case of this movie, 10 minutes have been cut all together, which you can see clearly by comparing the technical specs here with those of the imported ""Swordsman II"" DVD (which, incidentally, is the *actual* title of this movie.)
The import versions of these movies sometimes have their own failings -- mediocre image quality and/or clumsy subtitling are the most common problems -- but if you want to see the *real* versions of these movies, I suggest you avoid Buena Vista's releases at all costs, until they start releasing the films as they were intended to be seen.",1045440000,16,1322,5.068807339449541
1736594,2,B00006ADFS,"It is decent, but somewhat ruined by the english voice-overs. If the original Cantonese or whatever had been subtitled, it would be better, but there is no subtitle option with the original audio. The feel of the movie seems tainted by this, along with 70's kung-fu style camera shots and quality. The average Westerner wouldn't like this and I only write for those expecting an earlier version of Crouching Tiger. These reviews seem a little too kind. It's basically cheese, something you'll watch and laugh at.",1035158400,,512,4.965116279069767
1736595,1,B00006ADFS,"...""Swordman 2"" is actually the 2nd film of a trilogy, and also the best one of the three. It is a delightful, hilarious, over the top, kung fu swordplay fantasy film. There are superpowered heroes and villains flying all over the place. If you like that sort of thing (as opposed to realistic martial arts) then ""Swordman 2"" can not be beat for sheer entertainment.
Unfortunately, Disney/Miramax has completely ruined this film. They have added an atrociously amateurish English dub. Where do they find these voiceover ""actors""? They must all be infomercial rejects. Perhaps they are Harvey Wienstein's relatives. Who knows? In any case, they are bad. Bad.
And 9 minutes of footage have been cut from this movie. That is almost 9% of the movie. Imagine watching a movie and every ten minutes someone grabs the remote control and turns off the TV for the next 60 seconds. That's what Disney/Miramax has done with this DVD...
And of course, this DVD only has the horrible English dub track and the edited/censored/ruined version of the film even though it is easy to include multiple audio tracks and even multiple versions of films on DVDs...
Fortunately, the original ""Swordman 2"" is also available on DVD right here from Amazon for around the same price. Do yourself a favor: go up to the area of the ""Product Details"" area which says ""Other Formats"" and click on the link that says ""DVD"". This takes you to the listing for ""Swordman 2"" - the complete, unedited, original language, subtitled version of this film.
Please avoid this ... and instead buy his classic ""Swordman 2"".",1034294400,8,1579,4.851851851851852

7966214,3,B00006ADFS,"Well al was as aspected although I was disapointed regarding
the spoken language in this version of the film, While it sais when you look at the fetures of this movie the spoken language is ""Japanese"" a slight misstake i thought as this is an chinese movie and asumed that it should have said Cantonese but when i recived it the only language that I could select was Dubbed English. And I do belive that this kind of film loses some of its potency when not viewed in its original lanuage.",1222214400,,488,4.373626373626373
7966215,1,B00006ADFS,"If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting JET Li movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to ""Americanize"" and ""Control"". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to ""French version"" or ""Chinese Version"" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap ""American version"" then~! LOL",1139097600,3,922,4.76875
7966216,5,B00006ADFS,"This movie is one of my all time favorites in fantasy martial arts films. While the story may seem strange at first it is handled surprising well and becomes very absorbing. Brigitte Lin IS Asia, her acting is superb. Jet li is very charming in his role and showcases his rarely seen comical talents. One reviewer was confused about Michelle Reis's crush on her ""brother"", so for clarification in this movie she is called Jet li's ""sister"" but they are not actually related. They study under the same martial arts master and therefor become adoptive brother/sister because they share the same master. Hope that makes things more clear. I recommend this film to anyone who's open minded to a fantastic adventure with action, awesome villian, laughs and love.",1104624000,3,757,4.921875
7966217,5,B00006ADFS,"DO NOT BUY ""Legend of the Swordsman"" by Buena Vista. This is an edited and English dubbed version butchered by this studio. Buy ONLY the original HK version ""Swordsman II.""

I'm going to pass on some valuable info to my fellow Hong Kong movie buffs. Do yourselves a favor and visit [...] - they are a terrific Canadian distributor of original HK version dvds. ""Dream Lovers"" is only about $7-$8 USD. Most of their HK titles fall within this price range. ""Hero"" now at theatres starring Jet Li, Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung is also available for this price. Their service is outstanding. You can pretty much find any title with original Chinese audio and English subtitles.

Don't buy any American studio dubbed or edited versions!!!  Always read the packaging carefully - don't judge by it's cover. Boycott Disney and their subsidiaries such as Miramax/Dimension films and Buena Vista until they SHOW RESPECT for Asian cinema. Don't throw your hard earned money away and allow studios to treat YOU THE MOVIE FAN with disrespect! They are buying HK catalog titles and butchering by editing and English dubbing. They edit and dub because they wrongly believe American audiences will be less accepting of viewing HK films with original Chinese audio and English subtitles. Talk about racism and insulting the intelligence of American movie-goers!!! Disney is also purchasing HK titles to keep in storage without release. By doing so, Disney can keep the original HK studios from releasing these titles and have a monopoly on the catalog. Fans are left unable to own their favorite HK films. These studios do not care about art or movie fans by their disrespectful treatment of the original versions...all they care about is MONEY! Talk about DisNazi tactics! If Sony Pictures can release ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" with Chinese audio and English subtitles both at movie theatres and DVD, then why can these studios not do the same??  ""Crouching Tiger"" grossed over $125 million alone at the box office. But Disney still thinks American movie-goers are narrow-minded and ignorant. And Disney probably thought their release ""Freddy Got Fingered"" was the highest expression of the movie art form. The studios know that DVD is a top money grossing format and can save any box office bomb from total annihilation. Miramax is making minor improvement - they did release ""Iron Monkey"" in original audio and subtitled. However, they could not keep their hands from EDITING this great film. They thought it was too long! I believe fans deserve to see the uncut original version regardless of length. Did we not sit through 3 hrs of ""Titanic"" and almost 4 hrs of ""Dancing with Wolves?"" both box office blockbusters. So why the double standard with HK films?

Visit the WEB ALLIANCE FOR THE RESPECTFUL TREATMENT OF ASIAN CINEMA to sign the petition to Miramax. Read all about our mission. I gave you a summary of what is happening to the HK movie catalog. Over 13,000 signatures have been collected. We need all fans to help save the original HK studio versions and preserve our rights as fans to see the original cut as intended by the filmmaker.",1093910400,75,3136,4.943074003795067
