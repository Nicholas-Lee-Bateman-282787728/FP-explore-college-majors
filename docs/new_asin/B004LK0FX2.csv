8434451,4,B004LK0FX2,"In theater, we were confused at what was going on. The theater was house full and crowd was responsive. At certain dialogues they clapped heartedly, but on the other hand also made fun of the film at times. Sometimes at awkward moments. Like the whole theater laughed at the death of Sarpanch. That was supposed to be a very serious scene, but crowd was laughing at his death.. one viewer even said ""Oye eh ethe pahunchya kiwein, adh vichale drakhat de faansi kiwein le layi..."". There was laughter in the cinema, when Ekam's father gets a paralysis attack and the same when he dies. The same happened when Bhagwant Maan died. The whole house was jeering during the climax action sequence. It seems that Ekam couldn't bring about the tragedy all these characters were suffering. The scenes which were supposed to make people cry, actually induced such remarks as ""Oye eh ta Mar Geya Oye..."" ""Jeeb kiwein kaddi a sarpanch ne"" ""Oye pagg ta sambhal la..."" ""Oye Gypsy udd gayi oye"" ""Mera Pulser ta chalang ni Marda... """,1301011200,,1015,4.707865168539326
