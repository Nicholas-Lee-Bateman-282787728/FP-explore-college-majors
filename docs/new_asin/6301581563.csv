335129,4,6301581563,"This story is a good one about addictions and how they can capture your attention when you are not looking.  An insidious disease that only lives for itself.  A very tough experience done well, just not earth shaking!",1388016000,,217,4.684210526315789
335130,1,6301581563,"I just learned that there are 2 movies with the name Cocaine - One Man's Seduction. One with the characters, Hilda Bayley, Flora le Breton, Ward McAllister, and Cyril Raymond. The other movie filmed in 1983, stars Dennis Weaver, Karen Grassle, Pamela Bellwood, and James Spader. I found this movie in the James Spader list. However after reading the character list, it does not look like this is the one made in 1983, with Denis Weaver and James Spader. My reference to this movie is, be aware that it is in the wrong list.",1174780800,6,523,4.574468085106383

335232,5,6301581563,"One of the best movies on drug addiction ever made. This gem from 1983 is well-acted and realistic. It is not as ""Dark"" as ""The Boost"" from 1988.
I highly recommend this movie.",1456012800,,176,4.363636363636363
335233,5,6301581563,"I can not stop watching this!!  Amazing on so many levels:-)....Do yourself a favor and watch more than once, if you like ""after school specials"" this is right up your alley, you will thank me later.",1444176000,,199,4.527777777777778
335234,5,6301581563,"Epic movie--seen several times. A man's life spirals into perilous territory once he gets hooked on cocaine. Great cast featuring Dennis ""Duel"" Weaver and a very young James ""Blaine"" Spader",1442275200,,189,5.333333333333333

335236,5,6301581563,"Wow! What an intriguing story. This movie tells it like it is. Dennis Weaver is very convincing
in the main role as the victim of drug abuse. He really pulls you into his nightmare world
with his portrayal.
When I bought it, it was only available in the ""Instant Video"" format with no SAVE option.
Thankfully, they have since released it on DVD. I've watched it three times.",1411689600,,374,4.514705882352941
335237,4,6301581563,"Excellent casting with that twist that belonged to the 'cocaine delusion' of non-addictive substance. This is the reality that sill exists until . . . until the ending. One would think that the centuries of use would have given a more positive  warning against substance abuse. Unfortunately this scenario is repeated without a Hollywood ending every day. In a way it is 'seduction' for too many . . . usually a friend's suggestion and that friend is  already a user. Consider the timeline and you will find a realistic portrayal of a cocaine user within that socioeconomic lifestyle.

Perhaps it is difficult for me to be objective about this storyline . . . the ER scene is familiar but I wasn't the patient. No, there wasn't that encouraging Hollywood ending or even a resemblance to what had been a young life. Yes, this is recommended as more than ""A Precautionary Tale!""",1398902400,,876,4.788079470198675
335238,5,6301581563,"Dennis Weaver played a very truthful part in this movie. He has always been one of my  favorite actors and showed how
cocaine use can ruin one's life and cause death. I am so glad I found the movie for my collection. Miss him a lot!",1398643200,,232,4.043478260869565
335239,3,6301581563,"Cocaine: One Man's Seduction, is a cautionary tale, about one mans experience, with cocaine. A little dated, but not a bad movie.",1397779200,,129,4.909090909090909
335240,5,6301581563,So good.  Kept me up all night  One for the ages. Kids loved it too. Tambour is a dream boat,1396742400,2,92,3.55
7812830,5,6301581563,"Us 80s kids get the ""watching you"" reference.

This is a made for tv movie that has stood the test of time. The plot is obvious so I won't talk about that. I purchased the dvd after seeing the trailer on that tUbe site YOU all know. The promo I saw had the song ""White Lines"" playing in the background. Watch that video if you want to see more about the plot.

The acting is SUPERB, right down to the supporting cast. James Spader is HOT LIKE FIRE and his acting is superb even though he was acting professionally for a short time. The man is long overdue for an Academy Award.

Do yourself a favor and get the dvd while you can.",1518912000,,629,4.097560975609756

7812833,5,6301581563,I love love love Dennis Weaver he is one of My favorite actor of all time. I love the characters that he plays in films I love the especially the ordinary Husband and Father he always seems to get in some kind of sticky situation and there's a lot of drama that happens and he always have to find aways out Brilliant Actor,1472428800,,322,4.126984126984127
7812834,2,6301581563,"I mean...it wasn't AWFUL or unwatchable, but I only watched it because James Spader was in it...I am working on his filmography so this was just one of the movies on my list. I would have never sought out this film unless I had a reason. Though I can say that they show addiction well and the fathers slow spiral into becoming an addict and how it can affect your family. I guess it is a good education film, though I did laugh a few times mostly at the back round music and when the dad pitched an idea to James Spaders character and he just yelled THIS SUCKED. I don't know I would recommend this film unless you are trying to show your preteens that drugs are no good",1468540800,2,670,4.161538461538462
7812835,3,6301581563,Not much in redeaming social value here but Dennis Weaver gives a pretty good performance with a hokey script. Watch something else instead.,1461974400,,140,5.130434782608695
