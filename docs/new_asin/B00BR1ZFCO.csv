Sometimes, indeed, most of the time, our desires, dreams and wishes for certain things in our lives fails to take into account one important element--the impact and unpredictability of human behavior. Who among us can foresee the future or plan-out human behavior. It isn't possible. This film graphically, sometimes humorously, but most important, dramatically, illustrates this point using couples-swapping (aka 'swingin'), as the backdrop and context. The acting here is superb, the script smart and full of honesty and depth. The film takes us on a journey through the eyes of each of the characters who have, at least for the time being, determined that 'swingin' is the Answer. Whether it is or not, they are determined to truly live life to the fullest by discarding old ways of thinking and embracing new experiences and a new moral 'code' of sexual behavior within committed relationships--a code that passes no judgments, except one, don't fall in love with anyone other than your wife/husband/committed partner. Sleep around all you want in the light of day and the honesty of full disclosure, but NEVER fall in love. Well, as I said earlier, human behavior is unpredictable and that's where the real story begins. If you do not speak Spanish, be prepared to read the subtitles quickly, because these Argentinians (as I also discovered on a recent trip to Buenos Aires) speak exceedingly fast!",1373068800,,1562,5.081712062256809

5668239,3,B00BR1ZFCO,"To be honest I did not expect much from this film and that's exactly what I got.
Having said that although very predictable it did have some decent acting and funny moments",1372204800,,172,4.40625
5668240,4,B00BR1ZFCO,"Adrian Suar is already well-known in Argentinean cinema and has had many successes. It is only fitting that he has the main role in this movie about swingers that pushes the boundaries of the genre. His performance is truly one of the main positives about this film, since he shines above the rest of the cast.

Diego (Suar) and Ricardo (Juan Minujin) are surgeons and partners, who are at the pinnacle of their professional career. Diego's wife, Emi (Julieta Diaz), is a little envious of the fire she sees in the relationship between Ricardo and Betina (Carla Peterson). When Betina confides in Emi as to the secret behind this, everything is set in motion, since Emi starts to think about swinging as a possibility for ""fixing"" her marriage. This is when the best part of this movie starts.

The whole process that Diego and Emi go through, with her wanting to try this new lifestyle and Diego refusing vehemently, is mesmerizing. Suar delivers laughs aplenty and his facial expressions in different situations are priceless. This journey not only delivers laughs, there are also moments in which we feel a little uncomfortable (at least I did), but it is bearable and worth going through the experience. The soundtrack rounds up the positives about this movie, including a closing song by Charly Garcia which I have always loved.

The reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because towards the end, the story turns to a more soap-opera type plot. This was a bit of a letdown for me, but overall I still enjoyed this film greatly. I am a big fan of Argentinean movies, and once again I was not disappointed.",1364860800,,1622,4.724381625441696
