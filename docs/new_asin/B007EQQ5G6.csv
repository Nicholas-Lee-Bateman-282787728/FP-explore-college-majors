It's just a series of ""talking heads"" of a handful of fans gushing about McCartney and reciting common info that even any casual Beatles fan knows.

When referring to a specific place or event, they don't even bother to show a photo of what they're talking about, let alone any video footage.

When one of them, presumably one of the producers of the ""film"", cannot even remember the name of one of the early groups that Paul and Lennon called themselves, ""Johnny and the Moonbeams"", or is it ""Moon Shadows"", she couldn't even be bothered to stop-recording and look it up.  (It's ""Moon Dogs"" you fool!)

And they just lied about the running time.  71 minutes?  BS.  It's 32 minutes (rounded).  You just deliberately lied to us to make us think it was worth buying and watching.  It sure as hell isn't.

This is total junk and not worth watching, let alone buying.

The best par of it is the cover photo, which you can already see.

Avoid this piece of garbage at every opportunity and seek out the other professionally-made bios of McCartney.  Any of them are better than this crud.",1512604800,,1204,4.5092592592592595

While I must applaud and concur with the genuine love and sentiment expressed by the three American interviewees regarding the subject matter (one of whom clearly was not yet even born when the Beatles disbanded, and none of whom have ever even met him), the production of this fan-based ""fan-interview"" was simply sophomoric at best. As soon as I observed all three, and even the narrator, mispronounce Brian Epstein's last name (""Ep-styne"" as in beer stein, not ""Ep-steen"" as in Springsteen), I knew that this was not a real documentary at all but rather someone's high school senior project. Moreover, it's not 70 minutes long as advertised, it's only 31 minutes and 50 seconds! Nice job on the DVD case, though (except for the duration error); I would have never known. Now I regret borrowing it from the library (no, I didn't even buy it). I wonder how much Sir Paul would actually agree to all the sweeping generalizations if he knew. I'll give them credit for the old black and white photos, though (hence the two stars instead of one).",1353110400,2,1118,4.651515151515151
