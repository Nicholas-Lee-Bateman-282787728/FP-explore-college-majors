8681627,4,B00O2FACY8,Great film. Jumped around a lot from art to art. It should have spent more time delving into a few chosen arts. It was very confusing in the beginning. I also wished that there should have been more on the Goju segment. But the filming was great! The shipping was great. No problems with the dvd thus far. Not sure if I would purchase another one though. I give them four stars for the film making efforts.,1525910400,,406,4.285714285714286

8681629,4,B00O2FACY8,"This is a nice documentary on Morio Higaonna's dojo in Okinawa.  In the first 15 minutes or so of the film It has a little history and build-up and  the karateka and historian Hokama explains a few things as well . ( before the segment of Higaonna)
Good  film for the archives.",1465776000,,277,4.288461538461538
8681630,5,B00O2FACY8,"Excellent piece or work.  While not dispensing much of anything new in the way of history, the visit to Higoanna Sensei's dojo and snippets of his classes are well worth the time and price.",1442016000,2,189,4.5588235294117645
