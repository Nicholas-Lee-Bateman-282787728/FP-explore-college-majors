7607890,5,B01ARYG1AG,"This was very well put together and well paced. The Hidden Colors series set a new bar for African-centered documentaries. So I will compare this one to that series. Not because I think Hidden Colors is better or that this needs the comparison and cant stand on it's own merit. But because I feel the production and information on this title meets and even exceeds that bar in some places that HC set. This film covers a lot of what Hidden Colors covered in 3 parts in one film. Lots of great information and opinions are packed into this one disc. Props to the creators for going all the way out and putting their best foot forward in creating this.

I think this is great for beginners and intermediate learners. More advanced learners will find some of this repetitive (maybe even remedial in some parts) but I think even those on that level would still enjoy and appreciate this film. This one should be a must in any African-American's film collection. Let all that you can see this one. It's long, so depending on your audience or circle you may want to break this up in parts over a time period. But for me I was able to watch it all in one sitting. We need more professionally created docs like this circulating around to our people.",1461369600,29,1241,4.466960352422907

7607896,5,B01ARYG1AG,"This engaging documentary powerfully covers all aspects of Black life from rarely discussed ancient times to the more popular, but confusing Black experience here in America.  It's insightful and powerful collection of dynamic speakers leaves NO rock unturned, covering every aspect of racial tensions  between White and Blacks in America in terms of psychology, history, economics, religion and more.  This is a must have for everyone, but especially  the primary  victims of the concentrated system of American White Supremacy.  This is a message that adults and children need to see (Adults screen first to ensure the content is suitable for young children - The truth is tactful, but not sugar coated) Every disturbing and confusing racial event in America can and is explained on this DVD in clear and  practical terms that anyone can understand  ...But as the title suggest, you will not find ""Out Of Darkness"" in public schools where it belongs.  A Transformation Message!",1458345600,31,979,5.2243589743589745

7607923,5,B01ARYG1AG,"This is one of the greatest documentaries I have ever seen! Hidden colors 1-4 is great to, but this documentary goes a little more deeper. It even includes Tim Wise who explains in detail about white privilege. And he's white, so I know white people are furious when they see a white guy like Tim Wise speak the truth about his own race. Claude Anderson, Umar Johnson, and etc. are all great as well. I also love how they included hip hop as a very important tool for our liberation if we use it in a positive way instead of the negative way we are using it today in the mainstream. We need more rappers like Dead prez, K rino, Immortal Technique, X clan, Rass Kass, Brother Ali, Paris, T kash, Saul Williams, Canibus, Prof. Griff, Truth Universal, Nas, Cheif Kamachi, Killer Mike, and Chuck D. Then rap would be more positive and inspiring. But back to what I was saying, this documentary should be seen in all schools no matter what color the people are. I am gonna tell everyone I know about this documentary, and when I have kids, they will watch this documentary too.",1473552000,15,1072,4.446700507614213
