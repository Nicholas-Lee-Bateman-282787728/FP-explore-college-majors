8200068,5,B000REPUN6,"I attended this festival in 1982....it was one big party accompanied by some incredible music. Hopefully one day Playboy will release the entire set in some type of digital format. The limitations of the VHS tape obviously necessitated the need to edit down the set of each artist. For example, Weather Report's set was fairly extensive, but here you only get to see them play Volcano for Hire, a short medley of tunes  and their encore with the Manhattan Transfer, but there was more than that. The same could be said of Ornette Coleman and Prime Time, Free Flight, Dave Brubeck, and probably every other artist. Hopefully Playboy will pull this one out of the vaults one day and present it in its entirety.",1433116800,,708,4.709677419354839
