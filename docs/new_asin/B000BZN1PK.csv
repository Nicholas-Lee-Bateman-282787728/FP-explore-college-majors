2450920,5,B000BZN1PK,"My eight year old loved it as I did when I was young.  She made me play every episode on all 3 disks in less than a week and then started watching them over again.  The story line is simple,a mad, magical trip by a boy and a pricess being chased by the Grump (Wizard Villian).  They travel through various lands inhabited by strange but usually friendly creatures.  The good vs bad storyline is easy to pick up on by mid to upper elementary kids but too violent, though no more so than Bugs Bunny or Road Runner, for younger children.  I suggest you watch it with your child.",1235865600,,575,4.238532110091743

2450922,3,B000BZN1PK,"Yes, ""Here Comes The Grump"" is a silly, senseless maniacal cartoon of an unending chase but if you were a kid at the time it ran on television it is worth the sentimental value to order it and have a copy to watch every now and then just for the sake of memories.",1178755200,4,263,3.981132075471698
2450923,5,B000BZN1PK,I can remember this wonderful series as a child and now seeing it again in glorious colour I am not disappointed with it. It still appeals to all ages and overflows with imaginative creatures that we wished actually existed beyond our child minds and the mind set of the late 1960's/early 70's. The world is too serious today. Lighten up with this cartoon instead!,1174953600,2,364,4.703125
2450924,4,B000BZN1PK,"I've been wondering if, in the wake of the complete Pink Panther, this other DePatie-Freleng cartoon would make it to DVD. As it was a personal favorite, I'd probably give it five stars, but since I haven't seen this set I'll stay with a safe four. The ""Freleng"" in DePatie-Freleng is Looney Tunes animator Friz Freleng, and the dragon bears at least a passing resemblance to the one Yosemite Sam rides in the famous Bugs Bunny cartoon (""dragons is so stupid!"").

Part of this series was already released on single DVDs in Spanish (and the package design is a lot better). What I liked about this show is it was quite unique, being based on a sometimes leisurely and sometimes hurried chase, and didn't follow the Warner Bros. antagonistic animals pattern. It has much more in common with Gulliver's Travels on the one hand and Yellow Submarine on the other, in that the scenery and landscape changes frequently as the characters journey in search of their goal, meeting various curious (to them) creatures along the way. Not to mention their incredibly cool pet/ sidekick, Blip.

The DePatie-Freleng studio had a different sense of style, as shown in their take on the Pink Panther, and the accompanying Tijauana Toads (Texas Toads) and The Ant and the Aardvark, loosely drawn from comedian Henny Youngman. The D-F style hearkens to the starkly graphic, minimalist UPA look mixed with the sort of phantasmagoric psychedelia (another reviewer called it surrealistic) sensibility which Hanna-Barbera also briefly toyed with in Chatanooga Cats. Which, all in all, renders it eminently watchable and hearkens back to the amazing time (in this case late '60s) when Saturday morning was a cornucopia of great cartoons. Now when will they release The Super Six?",1146268800,3,1755,5.006849315068493
2450925,4,B000BZN1PK,"Amazingly, this series is just as much fun now as it was when I was a kid. It's aged well. My kids are now getting into it, watching it with me. The DVD menu is a bit sketchy, but that's okay, I can live with it. The episodes are well presented. The hours of fun:cost ratio is good. I'm happy with this DVD.",1142812800,3,307,3.888888888888889

8094907,3,B000BZN1PK,"I bought this; remembering that I used to watch it as a teenager, because it had some of the best bebop guitar playing on the planet. I was hoping to hear some of the fine work again but this is typical lame cartoon music?
 I don't know what they did with the best part of the cartoon but there is zero guitar on this collection.
One day I will give it to my grand-kids I suppose.",1370217600,,380,4.0
8094908,5,B000BZN1PK,"I loved this show when I was a kid. Still do. I bought this for my four year old son, who upon receiving it told me, ""I won't like it.""  Turned it on anyway and now he asks to watch it all the time.  This is the complete collection.",1358553600,,232,3.7142857142857144
8094909,4,B000BZN1PK,"It was just what I had expected it to be. I wanted my grandchildren to see the kind of cartoons we use to watch when we were little. They enjoyed it, but they found it more boring. But I enjoyed it!!",1323043200,,199,3.8780487804878048

8094911,4,B000BZN1PK,"I have been searching for this cartoon for many, many years. Though sadly the series ended before Princess Dawn could rescue her kingdom from the Grump's spell, I found the DVD collection to be a wonderful way to relive those halcyon days of childhood.

Of course, the constant slapstick, especially the Grump's dealings with his allergy-suffering dragon, are what make the series fun.

I admit the animation is not the best and they repeat a lot of cells (they must have saved a bundle by running the same scene over and over in different cartoons and just changing the dialogue), but the phantasmagorical characters and locations are great examples of the '60s psychedelic art motifs.

And young kids will enjoy the series too.",1252022400,2,729,4.9105691056910565
8094912,5,B000BZN1PK,"As with all children's cartoons viewed later in life, a little of GRUMP goes a long way and the music is annoying.  Watch it as it was broadcast, one episode per week.  But the artwork is fantastic--imagine a composite of Dr. Seuss, Jules Feiffer, and Palmer Brown (who wrote and illustrated a wonderful now-hard-to-find book called BEYOND THE PAWPAW TREES.)  The stories are (of course) childish, but also clever like the Oz books, featuring a ""Blabbermouth"" who was vaccinated with a phonograph needle, a community of talking shoes (including a swamp full of dangerous genuine alligator shoes), a pet with a detachable nose, and the title character, the Grump himself, a crafty wizard who talks and behaves more or less like the rural degenerates in THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (edited for kids of course).",1247097600,,808,5.014925373134329
