4516705,4,B0050O7U40,"A cute romantic comedy that even has Brooke Shields in it. The story is light and breezy, with snowboarding thrown in for the X Games crowd. The Swiss Alps look great, and the storyline is cute. My wife and I enjoyed this 2 hour diversion.",1354406400,,239,4.333333333333333
4516706,3,B0050O7U40,"Cute, but I don't think I'd ever watch it again. I don't quite understand Europe's fascination with public nudity. The language wasn't necessary either.",1352678400,2,152,5.375
4516707,4,B0050O7U40,I first saw this movie on Netflix and fell in love with it!  A surprising amount of celebrities are in the cast and they all work really well together.  It is worth the small price to buy it because you will watch it again and again!  With a couple of surprising plot twists and witty British banter to add the icing to the cake this movie is perfect for a chick night!,1350086400,2,369,4.097222222222222
4516708,4,B0050O7U40,This movies was ok for me... This movie caught my attention because I read in the synopsis that it had to do something with skateboarding/snowboarding (I like sports movies).,1347235200,,174,5.0344827586206895
4516709,4,B0050O7U40,"This was a fun feel good movie to watch. The story plot is nothing new, but has a different slant than most Cinderella stories.  I enjoyed this movie.  The movie is rated R, would say 15 and up for sexual content.  Not over the top, but not for younger people.",1346889600,,260,4.16
4516710,5,B0050O7U40,"This is a cute movie about a girl who is from meager means that becomes a housekeeper in a ski chalet to make money for her family. She meets the good-looking son of the chalet owner who has a girlfriend and a mother that dislikes her on sight, but is clearly intrigued by her. It follows her trials and tribulations while being a housekeeper, a young adult, learning how to snowboard and competing for a $25,000 prize and also her journey in overcoming the death of her mother by finding herself. Truly a coming of age movie. I'd give it a 4.5, so I rounded up.",1336262400,2,562,4.311320754716981
4516711,2,B0050O7U40,"I was very disappointed in this movie.  I had waited weeks for it to come out, thinking it would be a cute movie to share with my little nieces who are in their early teens. I'm awfully glad I watched it before I showed it to them. I won't be sharing this video now.  The trailers and advertisements try to make you think it's a cute little movie about skiing in the beautiful Alps of Austria.  What you really get is a very few clips of the Alps and several of young girls getting drunk, running around naked, and sleeping with boys they've just met on the slopes.  I was surprised that Brooke Shields would stoop to appear in such a shallow movie, however, we must remember that she gained her notoriety by playing the part of a little child hooker long ago.",1329004800,14,760,4.293706293706293
4516712,4,B0050O7U40,"Likeable romantic comedy with beautiful Alps setting, good, mostly English, actors and a fair amount of snowboarding/skiing.

Felicity Jones(the mildly bucktoothed, or is it called an overbite?, star of ""Northanger Abbey"", ""Brideshead Revisited"") plays an ex-champion skateboarder, down on her luck, poor girl, Kim, who takes a job as a servant or chalet girl for the ultra rich- Bill Nighy, Brooke Shields- at their posh ski lodge.

Kim knows nothing of snow, but goes about trying to conquer it and learn to snowboard and perhaps win the local competition plus the love of the rich son, Ed Westwick.

There's a lot of if's and maybe's has she struggles to overcome a past tragedy, support her loving but worthless dad, deal with backstabbing cattiness, and, the obvious social class differences.

The filmmakers shoot some gorgeous outdoor skiing and snowboarding, but the true focus of the movie is the relationships.  The comedy is lightweight but entertaining.  It's not rated, but I would say PG-13 for some language and sexual innuendo; there's a hot tub nude scene made for laughs but with really no ""nasty bits"" shown- everything's covered up.

Turn up the volume to cut through some of the English accents.  Good to watch after a day on the slopes or just when it's cold and snowy out and could use a little romance.",1328832000,27,1326,4.941441441441442
4516713,4,B0050O7U40,"I loved this movie!  It is an adorable, fun film. Great scenery and music!!  I recommend watching it if you are in the mood for a good, light-hearted romantic comedy.",1316217600,13,166,4.5

4516718,5,B0050O7U40,This is another life can turn around for you when it seems everything's gone up in smoke story.  Kim is a strong character who doesn't compromise herself.  There were some scenes  that I could do without but overall the story is encouraging.  To get back on the horse after you've been thrown and follow your dreams.  She even has an effect on those around her to make choices for their own dreams and desires and not to let others or life just pass you by....follow your heart.,1443312000,,478,4.448275862068965

4516720,3,B0050O7U40,"Despite a talented and delightful cast, Chalet Girl falls flat due to sloppy editing. The characters rush through the cliched plot, never pausing to develop the relationships that - we're told - are growing between them. We all know the story of the star athlete fallen from grace who finds their way back to the bigtime by pursuing a different but similar sport. Sure we want some plot twists, but when you pile on a mother's death, a father's co-dependency issues, a new job, and a rich-boy love interest, it's just too much to deal with in 90 minutes. That's not to say there isn't anything enjoyable about the movie -- Bill Nighy and Billy Bailey in particular make the most of their few lines, and Felicity Jones' working-girl sarcasm clashes humorously with the poshness around her. The scenes just never come together into a cohesive movie.",1441324800,,847,4.7687074829931975

4516732,4,B0050O7U40,"While this is generally a Standard Winter Sport Plot, it is executed better than usual. The script is well written, the camera work good and the acting better than average for this genre. I was pleasantly surprised. Recommended.",1400976000,,228,5.026315789473684

4516734,5,B0050O7U40,"Predictable all the way through, interesting to see (Chuck Bass) somewhere other than the upper east end, but  for the most part he may as well have been there because he was still the rich boy with a crush on the amazing pauper that just happened to be a pretty girl with talent and way less than he will ever have. I still enjoyed the movie.",1399939200,,343,4.196969696969697

4516736,3,B0050O7U40,"Would I say this movie was deep and fulfilling? No. Was it a fun way to spend a Friday afternoon? Yes.
This movie was the typical fluff-filled Cinderella story, but that doesn't mean it wasn't enjoyable. I think a nod should be made to Bill Nighy for some quite funny comedic acting. Ultimately this a movie worth watching for free through Amazon Prime, but I wouldn't recommend buying it.
Ratings note: This movie does contain drinking and some sexual content.",1397779200,,461,4.775
4516737,4,B0050O7U40,This is a simple but charming film. Wonderful scenery and some funny characters. I enjoyed the witty comeback attitude of Felicity's character.,1397433600,,143,5.545454545454546
4516738,3,B0050O7U40,A story that has been told many times.  The actors were fun to watch.  Wish they would have showed more camera work on the snowboarding,1397433600,,135,4.36

4516741,2,B0050O7U40,"I chose this prime movie because I like Bill Nighy in almost anything he's in.  But this movie was a disappointment.  Maybe I didn't give it fair chance because it took forever to get it to play on my Kindle Fire.  I was pretty frustrated by the time it finally began to play. I had to contact customer support because I kept receiving an ""unable to connect; try again later"" error.  Support provided some instructions which finally got things going.  Too bad I didn't select a better movie to play.",1396137600,,499,4.5
4516742,4,B0050O7U40,"I have watched this movie twice.  It is kind of a lighthearted, adventurous, movie with a little romance thrown in .  The main character is a hard working girl trying to support herself and her out of work father ever since her mother died in a car crash.  She was an award winning skate board champion but has given it up since the tragedy. She really needs the money so she takes a job as a chalet girl for a rich family near a ski resort.  She is like the common sense person in a cast of superficial characters.  As she learns how to fit in without really fitting in she enters a snow board competition to win some more money. Had a lot of laughs,  There is some drinking, partial nudity and a few coarse worded ideas objectifying women.  The main character sets people straight though.",1395273600,,790,4.333333333333333
4516743,1,B0050O7U40,This could have been a cute movie for pre teens and teens but with the nudity and drinking it cannot be recommended.,1394928000,2,116,4.318181818181818
4516744,4,B0050O7U40,"You won't be shocked or surprised by anything in this movie however its cute.  Bill Bailey is as usual excellent at being slightly insane, otherwise its a very typical RomCom.",1394582400,,175,4.833333333333333
4516745,1,B0050O7U40,We did finish this movie but certainly didn't sit through it.  This movie is definitely not worth your time or attention.,1393891200,,121,4.761904761904762
4516746,4,B0050O7U40,"Predictable, and in a good way.  Sometimes you just want to watch things turn out well.  The news is rarely accommodating.

Chalet Girl doesn't have the staying power of Dirty Dancing or Pretty Woman or The American President, but it's fun.  The poor but gutsy girl glimpsing/working for The Other Half (actually the 1%) and holding her own, has its own rewards.  There's a lot of people helping other people in that casual support system that can emerge in a subculture, in this case snowboarding. The mountains are gorgeous; everything seems so clean.  It's free on Amazon Prime.  What's not to like?",1393718400,,602,4.8431372549019605

4516748,4,B0050O7U40,"Good movie for a rainy or cold day.  Brooke Shields plays a nasty person, something that is very out of character for her, and she does a great job.",1393545600,,148,4.103448275862069
4516749,5,B0050O7U40,"Okay, I wouldn't go get a bottle of Dom for it but it's a very sweet, romantic comedy with just the perfect amount of sass and cash!

Spectacular shots of the mountains with a few helicopter rides to the top of virgin snow mountains and a really dream snowboarder in Felicity Jones who turns up  the volume on British sarcasm with a twist.

Ed Westwick, as per usual, lands the role of the ultra rich boy but this time with a true elegance and a touch of noble care for the slightly downtrodden Felicity with whom he falls in love.

Brooke Shields does a great job of being the overbearing mother who has set her sights on the perfect match for perfect little wayward son, Ed, and her husband is lovely in his ""down-to-earth"" comments. He is the embodiment of graciousness ""the gentleman who makes everyone around him feel better about themselves.""  (Jonathan Swift who originally defined that as the epitome of the gentleman.)

The supporting cast: A bunkabout town Finnish snowboarding teacher, the announcer of the snowboarding contest - in cape and quite the wordsmith, and the purrfectly catty chalet mates in staff who natch come around.

Very sweet way to spend the night with a RomCom, I'd like to see Felicity and Ed do another flick . . . maybe go seeking fortune in the Amazon jungles?",1393459200,,1296,4.633187772925764
4516750,3,B0050O7U40,Mildly entertaining totally predictable piece of romantic comedy. Except for getting to see Bill Nighly who is always amusing the story itself is nothing new. Does have Brooke Shields who is an admirable person but not much of an actress as confirmed here.,1393372800,,256,4.976744186046512

4516752,5,B0050O7U40,Even thow the actors have an accent it is still a great movie remind me of grind mixed with out cold but a chick flick at the same time would recommend for the sports girls out there!,1392336000,,183,3.972972972972973
4516753,4,B0050O7U40,"A fine movie of the chick-flick genre. If you're looking for a cute rom-com (less on the comedy side, but not any of the drama typically of romance), this will not disappoint.

There is mild nudity and mild cussing but a great poor girl falls for rich guy but done in a way I haven't seen before. No shortage on sarcasm, likable characters and fun to watch at anytime but if you are down and out of sorts it leaves you feeling great. I hope you all enjoy as I do so often. Fun for guys to watch if you want a likeable chick flick that they won't complain about because it has lots of guy humor too.",1391558400,,589,4.0
4516759,4,B0050O7U40,A good rainy day (or snowy day) movie. It has all of its basics there boy meets girl story and then a little more depth to the girl which makes this a little better than a hallmark movie.

Most importantly, the underdog steals the show in the end and overcomes her anxiety related to an accident.  Is a good movie to watch at least once, if not twice.  Beats much of what is televised on a good night.",1383955200,,348,4.492063492063492

Makes Westwick look a little wimpy if you ask me. Nonetheless, great soundtrack, attractive cast, somewhat believable chemistry, but in general a super enjoyable movie that makes you want to snowboard and have some hot cocoa. Enjoyed so much I'm watching for the fifth or sixth time now. Not an especially deep movie but ten out of ten for charm and fun atmosphere.",1382486400,,562,4.744897959183674

4516791,3,B0050O7U40,"First, its a movie about a girl who was a champion Skateboarder who disappeared suddenly after the death of her mother in a car accident. She gets offered a job rather on accident as a chalet girl even though she is not at all the type they usually hire. She takes it, needing the money to take care of her dad who has yet to find a job and cant take care of himself.

Through it, they both learn to live a different life. She learns how to snowboard and how to interact with wealthier class people. He learns what its like to care for himself in her absence.

During this she falls for the son of the man who owns the Chalet even though he is taken. He falls for her despite his mother's insistence that he find someone of his own class and a girlfriend who you see maybe twice or three times in the movie and no serious interaction. The reason I give this three stars is that I really would have liked more believable interaction between all of them.

Yes there is implied nudity, but it was a part of the story and did not seem gratuitous at all. Yes there was some foul language, but certainly nothing a young teen hasn't heard a great deal every day in school. It also was not gratuitous.

Otherwise this is a solid romantic comedy with an uplifting story. I liked the characters, I liked the growth and development of those characters into better people. The acting was decent. I liked the ending. It was worth the watch but maybe not a repeat.",1379030400,2,1450,4.281021897810219

Ed Westwick (aka Chuck from Gossip Girl) is adorable and very chic speaking in his true British accent.  Bill Nighy is sexy as ""Dicky"" his father!!!  Brooke Shields as the overbearing snobbish mum is just okay- a bit of an odd casting choice there.

It had a lot of moving parts. I clicked on it over on Netflix because it sounded cute and I love Ed Westwick (Gossip Girl - and it's a bit disconcerting to watch him with a British accent as I'm so used to Chuck Bass) and it has Felicity Jones in her pre ""Rogue One"" days. The whole movie feels like one of those Whack A Mole games where you get surprised every time a new actor you recognize pops up (Sophia Bush! Bill Nighy! Brooke Shields! That dude who was in the TV show ""10 Things I Hate About You""!)

I didn't feel the romance between the two leads. What made him stay behind? What was lacking in his relationship with his fiancee? Why was he drawn to Kim? What would they have in common? (And blech on another cheating character.) There were moments of British wit that I quite enjoyed, and I don't understand why this movie has an R rating other than a couple uses of language that you'd see on network TV right now.

If you want a romantic fix, I don't think this is the movie for you. The cast is really excellent (I especially enjoyed Kim's father), the plot is all over the place as it tries to decide what to be, but it was okay.",1484784000,,1294,4.151394422310757
