1815624,2,B00007JZO7,"Unlike the new Megaman-NT Warrior series, this original syndicated cartoon from the 90s(which also played a little on ABC Family)is NOT anime. This was an original North American production that was dubbed in Canada. In it, Megaman is named Rock and created by a friendly scientist, along with his domestic sister Roll and his flying robopooch. But, the evil Dr. Wylie along with Megaman's prototype Protoman have their own army of robots they use to try and take over the world. Fortunately, Megaman can take their powers away from them and use them as his own weapons(sorta like Kirby!). This series ran for 26 episodes. At least from not being an anime, at least this series has Megaman as a for-real character and not some gameskin in a VR game.",1063411200,,749,4.769230769230769
1815625,5,B00007JZO7,"You've probably read all of the other reviews, so I won't get into what the show is about. I'll just say that if you like action cartoons from the early 90's, you might very likely enjoy this show. If you can ignore the inaccuracies to the games, just enjoy the show the way it is. Of course, what really made me want to pick this up is the sheer amount of...episodes. 13 half hour episodes is DEFINITELY worth the money.",1044748800,3,421,4.275
1815626,5,B00007JZO7,"I haven't bought this DVD, but I want to once I get enough money.
The series is great-and I think some of the reviewers make too much of a big deal about the differences between the series and the game-saying they ""messed up"".
What a load of bull!
Do you think anyone would make such big difference on accident?
They did it to add some spice to the plot-like who wants a main hero character that can't think and make his own decisions?  ""Go out and Defeat Dr. Willy Mega Man!"", ""Yes, Master Light.""
Even take a look @ some of the later Mega Man games and I think you'll see that Mega Man can think, so it looks like the games screwed up too!
Anyway, it's a good series and I highly recomend it.",1044057600,,694,4.140740740740741
1815627,5,B00007JZO7,"I used to be a huge (""Mega"", if you will) fan of this cartoon, and I was excited to see it on DVD!  It's been years since I've lasted watched this cartoon, but now that I've added it to my video collection, I can reclaim those memories whenever I wish.  I only remembered two episodes (""Mega-Pinochio"" and ""Future Shock"") and I couldn't wait to see them again.
The animation is superb, and the shading is very well-done.  Not even most Disney movies do this much shading!  And the reflection on Protoman's visor is just awesome.  Some of the character designs are a bit on the odd side (Where's Ringman's other hand?), but you get used to it real quick.  Though, I forgot that Iceman sounded like a gruff Brooklynite(!).  The voice acting, otherwise, is great, with some very punny lines.
I watched every episode from start to finish, except ""Robosaur Park"", which was just torture.  That was laying on the cheese a tad too thick for my taste.  But, I can't wait for the other volume to come out and I hope they include ""Crime of the Century"", because, technically, that was on the third season.
Even with the ""Robosaur Park"" episode of doom, this still makes a great addition to any anime fan's library, and is a must-have for Megaman fans.  I'm glad I added it to my DVD collection.  No regrets there.  It was one of the best birthday presents I've gotten.

1815628,5,B00007JZO7,"Wow! This is incredible. I never thought that this would happen! I used to watch this show back in the day whenever I had the chance. Before this, I only had a couple of the episodes on tape. But not anymore! Now I have the whole first season! Err.. Anyway. Even though it doesn't really follow the game alot, it's still a great show. The episodes are fun to watch, and it brings back alot of great memories. I've been a fan of the blue bomber since '96. I'm still a big MM fan. I can't wait until Volume 2 comes out! Definately purchase this set, It's worth every dollar.",1043539200,,572,4.209090909090909
1815629,5,B00007JZO7,"The Megaman A Hero is Born DVD is a wonderful 13 episode collection of the blue bomber's first episodes.  The animation in the first episodes are superb, although not quite Anime.  However, in some cases, that's probably a good thing.  This Megaman is somewhat different from the game's interpretation, but is actually surprisingly faithful.  It's not a very deep cartoon, but it's action packed and just a joy to watch.  And thanks to the usage of robots, it's very family friendly.  Pick this one up as soon as possible!",1043193600,,522,4.808988764044944
1815630,5,B00007JZO7,"ADV has been great when it comes to bringing out great animation and this is definitely no exception.  The Megaman series aired here in the USA for a few years, however, the time slots the show was given and the channels the show aired on, caused many people to miss this great show.  For those of you who never saw this show, but did see another show called Captain N: The Game Master, you may remember Megaman being a main character in the show....and based on how Megaman was portrayed in that show you may feel that this dvd is not for you (dont get me wrong, Captain N is by far one of my favorite toons ever)...if your thinking like that STOP!  Megaman in this anime series is portrayed more closely to his videogame self.  Most of the guys from the games are there (Cutman, Dr. Wily, Proto Man, Rush, Dr. Light) and there is allot more game influenced action as well (Megaman gaining powers from his foes, Proto Man's origin,  etc).  This dvd is the first half of the series, the second half will be out this March.  If you are fan of Mega Man, anime, old cartoons, videogames, or are just looking for something new, this is a great dvd to purchase.  If your looking for a load of extras, or tons of blood and gore, then this might not be for you, but you should buy it anyways!",1043107200,2,1285,4.2809917355371905
1815651,5,B00007JZO7,"I remember watching this show as a kid and thinking ""I WISH I WAS MEGA MAN! POW POW BANG! YOUR DEAD STUPID ROBOT!"" When I put this DVD in my player, I had the same feelings. Megaman will always have a special place in me, because he's so cool. When have you ever gone out against a maniacal scientist genius and an army of giant killer robots armed only with a buster cannon and stupid puns? Megaman has. He kicks those robots cold hard metal rears, and then STEALS THEIR POWERS! The sheer madness of it is great! I don't watch this show because im looking to find something that will get an award, I'm looking for a completely stupid anime show with terrible jokes and robot smashin' action. Megaman will always be one of my heroes and a source of mindless entertainment.",1132358400,3,772,4.405594405594406
1815652,4,B00007JZO7,"1.okay this is based off of megaman 1-4 or 5 and 1 epsiode of based off of megaman X

2.okay i think the reason they did not make Megaman 6 7 8 and 9 an amie was becasue the show ended when Megaman 5 was still out i think i mean it would be nice to see Bass Duio Trouble and Centuro Man and Sword man but ahhh somethings come to a braking point look at fatal fury they didn't Relse Road to Victory and Mark of the wolfs amie evan thought those were the only 2 left why i don't know i don't care",1130198400,,494,3.704761904761905
1815653,5,B00007JZO7,"Sure, you kids have your fancy-schmancy Megaman: NT Warrior (or Battle Network Rockman. Exe for you darned Japanophiles) with its high-tech computer graphics and its God Almighty budget animation, but when I was a kid, I had the REAL Megaman cartoon to watch. And frankly, I feel you're all deprived.

Y'see, the original Megaman cartoon had in its favor an unidentifiable charm to it, a charm that anime usually lacks. While Megaman: NT Warrior may have a running storyline, the original cartoon had the basic US cartoon premise of ""bad guy attacks, good guy smacks bad guy, cue canned laughter, roll credits""; a feature that I feel we should see more of. While I enjoy coherent storytelling, sometimes I just want to sit down and watch something I *know* is stupid. Sometimes I wanna see laughably bad jokes and mindless animated violence. Sometimes I want to see goofy robots get their titanium backsides handed to them while watching the hero make sarcastic comments about just how awesome he really is at doing his job. You certainly won't find THAT in your anime, kiddies.

Sure, it's not exactly always accurate to the games, but who are we to complain? It's not as if the games were literary masterpieces to begin with, so one shouldn't hope for Shakespeare when watching this, or any other cartoon for that matter.

I highly suggest this DVD, people; it's got fair-to-great animation, great voice acting done by the Ocean group, and many, MANY bad jokes that'll make you roll in laughter for the wrong reasons. Also, they made Roll hot. What's there to lose?",1125014400,17,1567,4.83955223880597
1815654,5,B00007JZO7,Megaman should be megaboy cause really his human living tissue looks like a boy and his size and voice. Megaman is a robot who saves the world from the evil Dr. Wily who creates robots to take over the world. Megaman had sidekicks his robot sister Roll and a robot dog Rush.,1124496000,,274,4.288461538461538
1815655,2,B00007JZO7,"I love Mega Man, and I loved this show when it first aired in 1994.  And I was stoked when I first got my hands on this 3-disc DVD set.  However, that elation didn't last all that long.

What it boils down to is that it's kids' stuff, and I'm not a kid anymore.  And I wince when I hear the heroes spouting off cliche one-liners so frequently that James Bond himself wouldn't be able to stomach it.

On the other hand, the cool factor remains--seeing the robot masters that I loved so much in my youth on the tube still remains a treat.  For that reason, I don't regret owning this set.  And I don't think any Mega Man fan would.  But nevertheless, before you buy, just remember that my disposition is sentimental, and has nothing to do with these Mega Man episodes being of high quality...because in all honesty, they really aren't.",1113523200,5,833,4.363636363636363
1815656,3,B00007JZO7,"While this is a pretty good cartoon its not really accurate to the games. First off, all the robots are too tall & too muscle bound, secondly their weapons don't work the same way in the show that they do in the game. Another down side is there are none of the later day robots from Mega Man 5-8 which is bad because one of the coolest robots in the whole series, ""Bass"" is not in the show. A third problem is Mega Man himself, the problem is Mega Man is really just a little boy, but this one looks like an adult!
(WAH,WAH,WAH) Why oh why couldn't they make a Mega Man TV show with the same animation as in the cut-scenes of Mega Man 8 ?!?
Last but not least this is not anime but american art. Whats one thing that could have made the show better? How about some plots that aren't down right corny! Want a good example of how corny this show can get? Then check out the fabled Dino World episodes!
Mega Man season 1 is still worth buying but after that its all down hill from there.

Pros: DVD contains 13 episodes, has some good voice acting, contains enemies from the first 5 games, Mega man X makes an appearence in one of the episodes, and Dr. Light has a great voice when compared to Mega Man 8, meaning he dosent sound like Elmer Fudd!

Cons: Mega man looks and sounds like an adult, Both Roll & Proto man's stories have been messed around with!
In the game Rush was Mega man's loyal and helpful companion but in the show he's been made into a bumbling side-kick!
Most of the robots in the Mega Man games were child-like in appearence, but in this TV show they're all muscle bound and look like adults! I mean, Mega man has a six pack for crying out loud! And lastly, some of the episodes have very corny plot lines!

Overall: This DVD is entertaining and well worth buying, but it's not all that hard-core fans will have hoped for. I myself, recomend it to anyone who's a fan of Mega Man.",1104710400,2,1897,4.191780821917808
1815657,4,B00007JZO7,"This was a series that back in it's debute was in terms of animation style second only to Batman the animated series.  This looked really good.  Also the clever mix of action and comedy ensured that this would appeal to all audiences.

The story behind this dvd is that Dr. Wily and his robots are consistantly developing plans to conquer the world.  Wilys primary three robots are Cutsman, Gutsman, and Protoman.  Each episode also features one or more guest robots who assist Wily.  Generally its Snakeman or Bombman, but we do get to see characters through game 5 of the series.

One of the greatest aspects of the series was the opening sequence.  This alone is easily one of the best seen out there with a catchy tune and lots of action to promise what will be seen.

This dvd features the first half of the entire series and is worth picking up.  I am not giving it five stars however due to the fact that there  are no special features at all on this dvd.  However at a three DVD set with the first half of the series you can't go wrong.",1099785600,9,1044,4.352331606217617
1815658,5,B00007JZO7,"Finally a cartoon set that has been done right. It's a shame really that it's Megaman seeing as there is such a vast majority of 80's cartoons that were better than this (You know it's true) but never the less, It's here and it's good. Now all we need is The Real Ghostbusters, Inspector Gadget, Turtles, Captain N, Galaxy High (There are only thirteen episodes, they can't be that hard to release), Batman the animated tales, Thundercats, Ducktales, Super Mario Bros etc to be released in the same way as this.

7976989,4,B00007JZO7,My teenage years SUCKED. I hated the schools I went to in South Georgia (Stockbridge). Nothing but rednecks and black folks arguing with each other. The one ray of sunshine I had was that this cartoon came on in the morning before I went to school. I could never watch it in full because of the timing but now I can. The thing I like most about this cartoon is that it has Japanese artists and you can feel it.,1402099200,,410,4.1375

7976991,5,B00007JZO7,I LOVE Mega Man!!! I grew up with the games and have been a hardcore blue bomber fanatic my whole life. When it comes to the animated series ill be honest and say its not the greatest cartoon ever. I found it to be better when i was younger but I still enjoy it now that Im older. It can be a bit cheesy and corny at times but if your a Mega man fan then you'll love it too!
