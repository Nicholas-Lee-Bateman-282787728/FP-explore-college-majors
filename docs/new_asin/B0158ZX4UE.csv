7431244,3,B0158ZX4UE,"This will only be a review of the Blu-ray quality not a review about the story itself. The video quality is disappointing.  It doesn't seem as if the video transfer to Blu-ray was done well.  As compared to most Blu-ray videos this one does not apear to be true 1080p.  The images look muddy as if they were using a lower resolution (480p or 720i).  If you google ""Why Not All Blu-ray are Created Equal"" they discuss this issue in more detail than I can present here.  If you really like the story and you can accept that this is not a great transfer to Blu-ray you'll be happy with your purchase.",1459382400,119,597,4.294642857142857

7431247,5,B0158ZX4UE,Well -done series. This disc set worked perfectly fine. Only one broken prong across about 25 discs. No scratches. No optical problems with any disc. Only wish I could have gotten the sixth season the same way.,1505692800,,210,4.702702702702703

7431249,5,B0158ZX4UE,"We are now almost through the third season of this package, and can attest to the quality of these discs. Our Blue-ray player is several years old, but has not once choked on the ""region free"" format of these discs. No problems at all. The HD quality is fine, and the sound superb. Only two negatives are barely worth mentioning: The outer wrapper is thin and essentially a throw-away, but everything inside is quality. And it does seem odd for them to include ""extras"" links on one disc that require you to insert a different disc. But everything else is more sensible and not at all a bother. For the price one cannot beat this package.",1504656000,,638,4.508620689655173

7431282,5,B0158ZX4UE,"I watched the first episode of this series on TV.  It looked interesting so I bought the first 5 seasons.  Once I got started on it, I had a hard time stopping.  Plot is complicated but never boring.  It is not history.  It is an adult novel.  Not for children.  There is nudity in nearly every episode.  There are fantasy characters like fire breathing dragons and the walking dead.  Screen play & special effects are fantastic and 2nd only to the superior acting.  I have read that there are to be a total of 8 seasons of this series.  I have seen 5.  can't wait to watch 6-7-8.",1486339200,,580,4.268518518518518

7431338,4,B0158ZX4UE,"First of all, let me start with one of my concers before buying. The cases are standard plastic ones, 1 per season, and relatively slim considering they fit 4-5 discs. At $82 at time of writing, this is probably the cheapest way to get all 5 seasons, save maybe beat-up used DVDs on eBay. A slipcover comes over a cardboard case containing the five seasons. The discs sometimes come with three episodes, and the next one episode, sort of frustrating when binge-watching to switch discs twice in an hour. As for video quality, I wasn't looking closely at my previous blu-rays of seasons 2 and 4 so it's hard to compare, but this set looks slightly more compressed when overthinking. If I had to prove it, I couldn't. It seems to be the exact same as the original sets, save for packaging. Still phenomenal quality. Now, the only annoying part of this set are the UK ratings pasted all over, but when placed by my Battlestar Galactica set with a similar problem, it's less noticeable as it's not just one series anymore.

Anyway, this is the single best option for buying the entire series (Unless you don't have a blu-ray player. Excellent show, good quality, sufficient packaging.",1475798400,14,1180,4.700483091787439

7431340,2,B0158ZX4UE,"Great show even if a lot of blood and guts,  The low star rating is do to the way the menu on the Blu-ray works.  If you do not select play all at the beginning, you have to manually stop the disc and re-start it again and wait for the disclaimers to play (in the language you have selected) and then try and remember which episode you want next, as the menu shows all the episodes of the season not just which ones are on the current disk. (There are 5 discs)  If you let the disc go on its own, it takes you back to the disclaimers and then proceeds to play the disclaimer in all the languages available on the disc, not just the language you selected, and there must be 30 languages before it starts the next episodet.  Hate that aspect of the menu, so I just stop the disc and start over each time I move to the next episode.  Really takes up a lot of time when binge watching.  :(",1475539200,,885,4.0285714285714285
7431341,5,B0158ZX4UE,"It's quite an adventure to watch. Very realistic, but Game of Thrones is not for everyone, a lot of nudity of both women and men. Not for 18 and under.  For someone who wants to watch these series of back in that time, it's for you.

If you have a 70"" TV you will quickly realize that someone messed up in transferring the episodes to Bluray.  The set has gone down from $105 to selling for around $80 now.  I imagine someone at HBO fell asleep while the episodes were being transferred to Bluray.  I guess we will have to wait for the series to end for a real 1080 HD set to come out.

The one we bought was not the newest ""slim"" version because this one was cheaper by about $30, but it works perfectly well. The main difference between the two is that this one states ""UK Region"" or ""UK Version"" or something like that, but it works perfectly fine in the US in our Blu-ray player and our XBOX One (only difference is the rating on the box is UK-style rating system, not US).

7431418,4,B0158ZX4UE,"This review is for the Blu-Rays, not the show.  These are region-free and will play on any American Blu-Ray player.  You will notice the weird looking rating icons, but don't worry, there is English audio and the menus are in English and everything.  I haven't done any of the Extras yet, but we binged all 5 seasons in about 3 weeks, so I can say that all episodes looked good.  The disc menu is the same for each disc in the season, meaning that if you put disc 1 in, you will see options to play all the episodes on the other discs of the season, and options to play extras that are on other discs, so that can get kind of confusing.  That's one of the reasons we never played the extras because it was hard to tell which disc had them on it.  And there are multiple extras on multiple discs.  Also, I'm noticing these newer Blu-Rays don't save your location anymore.  If I Play All and stop after 2 episodes, starting it back up is a 10 minute process of waiting through all the load screens and government warnings about piracy (yeah, we get it already, it's still going to be done), and then finding the episode we were on.  I will say there is a handy feature that when you're bingeing (binging?) and you finish the disc, don't hit enter on the Back option; hit eject and insert the next disc and it will automatically start the next episode so you don't have to wait through all the loading screens and stuff.  Unfortunately we didn't figure this out until season 5.  Heh.  All-in-all, for the price of a couple seasons, I was able to get all 5 of the currently released seasons in a fairly attractive set.  Oh, which reminds me, it comes in what feels like a very solid, sturdy cardboard box/case that all the individually cased seasons slip into, and then there's a paper covering that slips over the entire case.  Like I said, it looks pretty good.  My paper covering came a little dented, a few cosmetic damages, but otherwise ok.  A good buy for anyone looking to add this to their collection.  If you're looking for free, get the HBONow app and watch the entire series before the month-free trial ends.  That's how we watched Season 6.",1468281600,27,2149,4.39746835443038

The story is excellent only to be surpassed by the actors and characterization and the behind the scenes people that have developed them and allowed them to grow, As the name Games of Thrones intimates there will be changes additions and subtractions of characters and that is to be expected though at times brutal and sad yet at times very uplifting in their honor, or in some cases lack of it.

This series is unending throat slashing and boob flashing with full frontal nudity, incest, rape and all kinds of  perversions interesting to 12 year boys.  There are some excellent classic British actors in the cast and also some truly bad ones who deliver truly silly lines.

I have decided I will watch season 1 through 6 again while they play the last season, and pick up the last season after it is over and continue on from season 6 with no interruptions.
I can only remember I was so excited about a TV show when I was chasing 24 and The Walking Dead.... But G O T is a different class on it own.
There is no comparison..... complex story, wonderfully written, beautifully directed.... salute!!",1467072000,5,870,4.409937888198757
7431433,5,B0158ZX4UE,"Great Quality.

Haven't seen them all, but what I have seen so far is just great quality overall.

I use a Playstation 3 as my main Bluray reader, basically because its grate audio output through optical cable into my Sony Home Teather, so as you can see audio is very important for me and this series really delivers in that regard.
There are subtitle options in all languages you should expect including spanish.
The video quality is really good, great photography.
Menus are well designed its just what you should expect from a premium production, nothing I can take away from this product, all this without even going into how good the show is, Im just reviewing the audio/video/user experience quality.

Highly recommend this product at this price tag its a steal (I got it for $130 her in Amazon).

I will update if further in my viewing off all the discs I find something that could contradict my review, so far so good.",1466985600,6,927,4.634146341463414

7431447,5,B0158ZX4UE,"When I began hearing about Game of Thrones, I thought it was some kind of game show and I wasn't interested, besides, I did not subscribe to that network. Then Comcast allowed me to see some shows from premium channels for a week, and I decided to try it. I watched two episodes and was hooked. I went to Amazon and ordered the Complete series. It is a take on the early struggles for supremacy among the separate kingdoms in England, including legends, mysticism, dragons and more. It is so well done, fascinating. I can't wait until the next season is available .",1465516800,4,565,4.495145631067961

It wouldn't go to the menu screen and sat on what appeared to be a screen saver for quite a long time (looked like a tree with red leaves that were moving). No matter what I did I couldn't get it to go to the menu screen to start the episodes, until I hit the tool button on my remote and did a few other things. I'm pretty tech savvy so the issue was not on my end... I just imagine there are a lot of people out there who wouldn't know how to work something that's not user friendly.",1465084800,15,652,3.873134328358209

7431460,5,B0158ZX4UE,"I was nervous when I considered buying this item because a few of the reviews noted that it came damaged or had poor quality. However, I took the leap and bought this because it was significantly cheaper than other options. The box set came unopened and shrink wrapped, but there was minimal wear and tear to a couple of corners that likely could have been from shipping and handling - nothing major and it was hardly noticeable. All discs and booklets were present. The booklets were quite fun because they included family trees and a map to help you follow along with the characters in the show. The quality of the blu-ray is excellent, and I noticed nothing different from any other blu-rays that I have purchased. There are also many special features. I was also a bit nervous because I have never purchased a ""region-free"" disc, and really didn't know what it entailed. However, I have noticed nothing different about the show or content, just a few more warning advertisements in different languages, and a couple more ratings listed on the cases.

Overall, I am super happy I purchased this set - everything came brand new, good condition, and great quality!",1464652800,72,1165,4.767326732673268

Thus far (we haven't made it through the series) this has completely replaced cable tv, AND hulu..... so if you (like me) spend 100+ for your cable, and 15 for a subscription based programming of some sort (in my case hulu) then there is no way for you to NOT be able to justify the $- as this brings more entertainment and last longer than a month (again assuming you watch what most would call a normal amount)

top 4 series i've bought and never regretted (IN NO ORDER).....Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, Sons of Anarchy, Game of Thrones",1463443200,5,835,4.52317880794702
