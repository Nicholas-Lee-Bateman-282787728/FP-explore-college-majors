8393068,5,B003ANP8DI,"My boys love this DVD!  It has Fireman Sam, Thomas, and Bob the Builder which they really love and Barney as a bonus.  They even liked the Angelina part!  All the episodes are about being friends and working together, amongst other great lessons.  The best part though is the DVD has Auto Play which means it automatically goes to the first episode and then continues, unless you choose the menu in the first few seconds the DVD is on.  My 3 year old loves to put DVDs in himself and this way, he doesn't have to hit the play button, just pop in the DVD.  All of these episodes are also super colorful and bright, and have cute music!  This DVD is great for kids to get a variety of characters, as well as their favorites, all while learning something (hopefully!)",1274659200,2,764,4.375886524822695
