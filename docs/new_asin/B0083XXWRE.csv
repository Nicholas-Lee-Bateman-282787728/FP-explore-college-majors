5129282,4,B0083XXWRE,"I wouldn't say this was an all out laugh fest. A few moments were witty, some hilarious. At times you could hear birds chirping in the theater. The characters were surprsingly mellow also. The plot got the story rolling but then seemed to lose steam as it progressed into the second half. The filmmakers wanted to show that Ron had a heart, which is respected on a moral basis. The movie went down a low key, dramatic tunnel toward the end. They could've used the other team members more, they seemed to take a backseat and then would pop up for small scenes. The final battle (hint hint) didn't disappoint. Where The Dark Knight topped Batman Begins, Anchorman 2 really doesn't surpass the original. It's still a fun movie. I hope they do a third and go for comedy gold.",1387756800,,771,4.514285714285714
5129283,4,B0083XXWRE,"Let me first preface this by stating that I am not a Will Farrell fan. I don't find most of his work particularly funny, but if there's one exception that I could make, it's ANCHORMAN: THE LEGEND OF RON BURGUNDY. It's a film that does get funnier as time goes on, and that it's actually something of a smartly-designed film and sometimes brilliantly satirizes some serious issues with newscasting. In the original film, it was the introduction in the mid-Seventies of women anchors. It was surprising to see a broad and juvenile comedy that actually had something to say, albeit in a very roundabout way. And it also didn't hurt to have a great supporting cast in the likes of Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Fred Willard, and Steve Carell. So director Adam McKay and Farrell and the original cast have returned several years since the first film to reunite for another outing with the news crew with ANCHORMAN 2: THE LEGEND CONTINUES.

The film opens in the early Eighties with co-anchors Ron and Veronica Corningstone (Farrell and Christina Applegate) happily married with their seven-year-old son Walter, and now working in New York. But things fall apart when senior anchor Mack Harken (Harrison Ford, in something barely more than a cameo) retires and chooses Veronica as his replacement, and names Ron one of the worst reporters in history. After splitting with Veronica, Ron flounders in a drunken stupor back in San Diego, and is approached by Freddie (the great Dylan Baker), who is looking for newscasters for a 24-hour news network. Ron then gathers the gang of reporter-turned-pet-photographer Brian (Rudd), sportscaster turned fried-bat-restaurant-owner Champ (Koechner), and weatherman and decidedly not-dead Brick (Carell) to join him in NY. Once there, they end up with the graveyard shift of 2-5am, with the prime-time slot belonging to Ron's immediate nemesis, uber-handsome Jack Lime (James Marsden), and they meet their tough female African-American boss Linda Jackson (Meagan Good). While planning for the night shift, Ron comes up with the brilliant idea that instead of telling the people what they SHOULD hear on the news, they instead break with journalistic integrity, and decide to build their newscast on what the people WANT to hear. This sets off a firestorm of ratings, an interracial relationship between Ron and Linda, Brick meeting the perfect woman for him (a PERFECT Kristen Wiig), and Ron's hubris getting the best of him as he alienates everyone and inevitably falls from grace. But with the help of Veronica and Walter, he looks to get back on his anchor-horse, but not before he and the newsteam have to throw down against Lime's cronies and upstarts from other new 24-hour cable channels in the climactic battle royale fashion of the first film, with some incredible cameos.

Firstly, the criticisms. The film, for the most part, is something of a retread of the original. There isn't much new here to see, and some of the jokes, particularly when they all meet Linda for the first time, fall pretty flat due to repetition and flat-out theft; the restaurant scene with Ron and Linda has moments lifted from the first AUSTIN POWERS film. Some cast members are horribly wasted: Harrison Ford could easily have been given a few more screen minutes, and Marsden, a great actor who has yet to be really utilized properly in a big film, is relegated to nothing more than a grade-school bully with no real character. However, when the film is on, it's on like Pong. The ""guess who's coming to dinner"" scene with Ron at Linda's family's home is tear-inducing in its cringe-worthy hilarity. The RV slo-mo sequence is particularly inspired, but stealing every scene with relative ease is Carell and particularly so when he's on-screen with Wiig. They just tear down the walls with awesomeness. And then there is the satirical edge the film is given with its ultra-jingoistic attitude that Ron and the team start up when they don't even really do the news, but just give opinions about how great America is; needless, pointless speculation during a high-speed car chase (which interrupts Veronica's potentially world-changing interview with Yassar Arafat), and lists of the prettiest 'ginas in the world. It's a great, and occasionally scathing attack on almost all of the modern 24-hour news channels, and it's what gives the film the kick it needs to save it from just being a moderately funny film.

While ANCHORMAN 2 doesn't exactly soar to new heights of hilarity, it's edgy enough and silly enough to keep you in your seat for most of the film.

5129284,5,B0083XXWRE,"I saw this opening night and loved it. The humor was raw (not for the weak), suprising cameo's,  and refreshing to see this finally come out. If you loved the first one SEE THIS!  It was interesting see how they mocked an idea that is now on every major news channel. In a wierd kind of way this gives you a better perspective of how things worked way back then.  Enjoy everyone!!!!",1387497600,3,382,4.277777777777778
5129285,4,B0083XXWRE,"What can you possibly say about Ron Burgundy that hasn't already been said? The short answer is nothing. But, for those of you that don't know Mr. Burgundy, he is best described as being a charming, outspoken individual that oozes charisma and attracts the ladies like nobodys business. Did I mention hes also the best news anchorman in the business? Burgundy, along with his news team and co-anchor girlfriend, Veronica Corningstone, conquered the San Diego airwaves, begging the question: what will they conquer next?

Nearly ten years since the release of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, director (and co-writer) Adam McKay reunites with the films star (and co-writer), Will Ferrell, for the sequel, Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues. Since the conclusion of its predecessor, the sequel picks up with Ron and Veronica (Christina Applegate) now married, with a son, and living in New York City. And, rumor has it they might be moving into the prime-time news slot. Unfortunately for Ron, its Veronica thats promoted to the coveted slot, while Ron is promptly fired and called the worst anchorman in history. Begrudged, he ultimately gives Veronica a choice: it's either him or the job. Take a guess how that goes

With his marriage on the rocks and down on his luck, Ron eventually receives some good news when hes paid a visit by Freddie Shapp (Dylan Baker), who asks Ron to come work for an upstart 24-hour news network (which was a laughable idea when it was initially proposed). Excited to be back in the business, Ron sets out to reassemble his news team, who have all scatter since he last saw them. Despite their current, new-found occupations, Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), Champ Kind (David Koechner), and Brick Tamland (Steve Carell), are all more than happy to join Ron on his quest to dominate the Global News Network (GNN).

Now back working in New York City, Ron quickly discovers hes no longer the hottest thing in town. His new rival, Jack Lime (James Marsden), is the big man on campus. However, Ron Burgundy always has a way of making the news exciting and quickly dominates the airwaves once more  leading to a bigger ego, a new girlfriend, and copious amounts of friction with his news team. However, just when you think Ron can't get anymore egotistical, he is surprisingly humbled and sent into a tailspin when he loses his ability to read the news.

In the event that you weren't impressed by Will Ferrell's performance in the original Anchorman (like me), this sequel will quickly reverse your opinion. Ferrell, whose humor is mostly childish and borderline ridiculous, continues with that trend. Some scenes are funnier than other, but he never fails to provide even the slightest chuckle. One particular scene, in which he accompanies his new girlfriend, Linda Jackson (Meagan Good), to dinner at her family's house is a particularly frighteningly embarrassing scene  yet it works well for Burgundy's unfiltered character.

Make no mistake about it  this film is dominated by the presence of Ferrell's alluring portrayal as Ron Burgundy. However, quite a bit of screen time is also allotted to Steve Carell's mentally-challenged character, Brick Tamland. Honestly, the more I see of Carell in feature films, the more I enjoy him. While he may have had quite a few fans that wished he stayed longer on The Office, it's become abundantly clear he belongs on the big screen. Carell's co-stars, however, don't necessarily benefit from this sequel. Neither Paul Rudd or David Koechner stand out here, and are basically just along for the ride. Most moviegoers don't see enough Koechner, so that's a shame, but as far as Rudd goes, his career continues to explode regardless.

To be fair to the script, this Anchorman sequel is anything but predictable  taking countless twists and turns that you'll never expect. You won't anticipate Ron's rebound from losing his job as fast as he does (taking place in the opening scenes), but sure enough, Ron surprisingly takes GNN to new, unprecedented heights. Like current news networks, this film's subplot becomes all about dominating the ratings, and the moguls that run them. In comedic fashion, the film doesn't hold back any punches when sending shots towards the current state of the news media  which are full of fluff pieces, car chases, and telling viewers exactly what they want to hear.

So, here's the biggest question surrounding this sequel: is it as good or better than the first film? Well, that depends on your love for the first film, really. If you casually enjoyed The Legend of Ron Burgundy, then this sequel will feel like what you'd expect out of a sequel. However, die-hard fans might feel differently. The jokes are about the same, meaning you'll get a full does of WHAMMY, plus several similar parallels to the first film. One of those parallels is another major battle between rival news organizations, which is full of humorous cameos  including Tina Fey, Liam Neeson, and Kanye West (for reasons beyond comprehension). Don't worry, I neglected to mention the best cameos.

Even though this sequel is filled with plenty of funnies, it really doesn't accomplish anything earth-shattering like its predecessor. In fact, this sequel feels about 20-30 minutes too long, and clearly incorporates several scenes that were unnecessary or just carried on far too long. The news brawl-for-all, for instance, could have been much more cut n' dry, but with the abundance of cameos and the attempt for them to all get in a line or two simply drags the progression of the film down to a stand-still. The opening half-hour where Ron has to get his team back together is also an area that was too long and add next to nothing to the story.

Overall, Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues is an admirable sequel to a film many fans consider to be a gem. However, while this film does progress the story of Ron Burgundy, there's really nothing monumental about it. You simply get more of the same nonsense (racism, sexism, etc.) that's associated the late 1970s and early 80s. At the same time, we should all thank the lucky stars that an Anchorman sequel was even made. For years, news kept making the rounds that a sequel was dead and the likelihood it would ever happen was minimal at best. But, here we are with one sequel under our belts and ready for another.

5129286,3,B0083XXWRE,"Year ago, producer Stanley Kramer cast movies stars in small,cameo roles in his artsy-fartsy message movies to help sell tickets(""Judgement at Nurembourg""). It worked. They're doing it again.  ""Anchorman 2, the Legend Continues"", stars Will Ferrell, 10 years later, as TV newsman Ron Burgundy. But these days, things aren't so good. Burgundy is fired by the boss(Harrison Ford), and replaced by....his wife(Christina Applegate)! Burgundy becomes the tipsy announcer at Sea World in San Diego. Somehow, that doesn't fly. And then a producer offers Burgundy a midnight gig(2:00 AM) on up-start TV network GNN(think CNN), which plans to broadcast 24-hours-a-day. Huh? This is 1980. Nobody does that. Of course, the new format is a smash, with Burgundy reporting a live-feed cop-car freeway chase. He yells with excitement as the chase ends in a messy crash. He's a hit. It's 1980, and old school humor includes black people jokes, bad language and lots of ethnic slurs. Some of it works. Get ready for Steve Carell as a schizophrenic TV newsman(Brick Tamland). He is so off, that, if you yell at him, he whimpers, and hides behind the couch. Some of this is pretty funny, and Carell is either pretty good, or certifiable. Will Ferrell has struggled for a few years, after bombs like ""Land of the Lost"", and has returned to TV(like ""30 Rock""). He needs a hit. The ending of ""Anchorman 2"" is right out of ""Saturday Night Live"", with a parade of ""celebs"" that include Jim Carrey, Liam Neeson, Vince Vaughn, and Sacha Baron Cohen. Don't blink, or you'll miss the MTV Rocker(4 seconds) played by Kanye West.",1387411200,3,1599,4.9664179104477615

Not just a ripoff/rehash of the first one, which is typical of Hollywood execs. This is one of the nuttiest zaniest comedies I've ever seen. It's absurd (my favorite kind of comedy). Will Ferrel lives his character, and they give Steve Carell the best lines. In addition to being a 'silly' comedy, there are many moments where our shift from real news to infotainment is properly lampooned, and, at the end, rejected by the main character as not important compared to love and family.

5129318,3,B0083XXWRE,"Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues
 Will Ferrell gifts us with a PG-13 comedy that actually has many laughs and has an added bonus-you can safely view this movie with either your mom or your teenage children.  The over the top language and situations of many R rated comedies are absent.  What a refreshing change of pace in this day and age.
 This is the fifth Will Ferrell vehicle that writer/Director Adam McKay has managed and perhaps his best.  TV news reader Ron Burgundy had become one of Ferrells best known and best regarded characters.  24 hour cable TV news comes on the scene in the early 80s, giving Burgundy a second chance at stardom.  The best bits in the film are the savage satires of CNN, the pioneer of the all news concept.  In true Burgundy fashion, he alters the entire concept of news.  Dont give the people what they need, give them what they want he tells his producers.  He does, and becomes a spectacular success with stories of live feed car chases and puppies.  Best of all, he keeps us laughing.
 Ferrell is backed by his sidekicks and fellow newsmen Steve Carell and Paul Rudd.  Carell plays a weatherman who seems to actually suffer from mental retardation, but none of the crew approaches average intelligence.  Burgundy himself is dim-witted and monumentally selfish.  But Ferrell makes us want to watch Burgundy in spite of his obvious flaws.
 Also featured are Christian Applegate as his ex-wife, Harrison Ford as the powerful network owner and James Marsden as the rival and oh so handsome news reader.  If you want a fun three saw blade comedy this week, Anchorman 2 will fit the bill.
 The film cost a reported $50 million to make and took in $40 million in five days.  Anchorman 2 opened on Wednesday instead of the usual Friday, giving it an extra two days of the opening weekend.
 Ferrell has now appeared in or starred in some 34 films.  Some are memorable.  Elf comes to mind and the amazing, over the top Blades of Glory.  He has been successful in bringing people into the theaters with a pretty much one dimensional character repeated in film after film.  Anchorman 2 provides Ferrell with a platform to show his skills to his best advantage.  Fans will flock to see this and non fans like me will also enjoy it.  The movie lasts one minute short of 2 hours.
 Like him or hate him, Ferrell has parlayed his SNL origin into a very successful film career.  The funny man is worth $80 million and that isn't funny.",1469836800,,2458,4.588505747126437

I had  watched the original Anchorman years ago. Anchorman 2, in some ways, is funnier than the original. The story-line has many twists and surprises but above all, there are many segments that are extremely funny. In particular, the scene where Will Farrell's character meets his black girlfriend's family for dinner, was so funny that I could not stop laughing and had to rewind it for several more times. The fight scene near the end of the movie is also very hilarious. Not every punch line was funny though, and I was not so much fond of the scenes where there were a lot of shouting during conversation. The acting by all actors was great for a screwball comedy that this movie was. As in the original Anchorman, Steve Carrel's character seemed somewhat spurious.",1454198400,,959,4.8121212121212125

This movie is incredible comic genius through and through. As much as I love the first one this one blows it away and it gets even better the more times you see it. I don`t think i`ve ever laughed as hard and as much in my entire life as I did with Anchorman 2. I was shocked when I saw how low of a rating it has on this site. Defintely deserves more props than this. I`m really curious what it would be like to watch this with someone who doesn`t care for it just to see why they don`t.

I was horribly, horribly wrong. If you watched the first movie, it becomes very clear that the original content in this is low. So many jokes and situations were recycled from the first movie; and they felt incredibly forced at that.

They also clearly had a much bigger budget for this one, and I think that may have been part of the issue. There was a lot of unnecessary, over the top moments that ended up detracting from the movie and the comedy. Do yourself a favor and stick to re-watching the original, it is superb in nearly every way.

Anchorman 2 misses the mark completely. By far one of the top 3 worst movies I have ever watched.",1451865600,,787,4.304054054054054

5130000,1,B0083XXWRE,Really disappointed in this. The first one was hilarious so I was expecting about the same and it was very underwhelming. Wouldn't recommend.,1448064000,,141,5.173913043478261
5130001,1,B0083XXWRE,The worst. Even made more pathetic by the extra joke (if you can call them jokes) release. As much as the first was awesome is as bad as this one is.,1448064000,,149,3.838709677419355
5130002,3,B0083XXWRE,Actually started out like it might actually be funny. At least funnier than the first one. Then I fell asleep in the first 20 minutes. Not sure if I was bored to sleep or just tired. Probably not a fair review.,1448064000,,210,4.146341463414634

5130027,1,B0083XXWRE,"The cast of characters of this movie seemed to be a good ensemble for an entertaining movie; how could it go so wrong. There are moments of comedy but the take away is how can someone waste so much money to write, film, produce and market such a bad movie. I like the actors, don't get me wrong; to me it seemed like they had a budget of money to spend and really didn't have a plan, little if any script. Each actor has had very good movies, but this seemed like partly a spring break episode that just didn't make it to the party. I really never have high expectations for these type of movies... just numb entertainment to pass the time and have a laugh; maybe even latch on to a catch line to use some other time, but not this movie... just the worst movie I have ever watched.

I was with a boyfriend then, and while the relationship did not last...the cult classic Anchorman did.  I saw the film numerous times and often reference it and quote it to feel good and laugh.  In the sequel, the whole original cast returns.  There is probably not one actor in the film that is not a common face in the professional comedy world.  Steve Carell, Will Farrell, Paul Rudd, Christina Applegate and more appear for a (two + hour long) celebration of the classic character we all knew and loved too well the first time around...the emotional and heroic Ron Burgundy.",1510531200,2,664,4.593220338983051
