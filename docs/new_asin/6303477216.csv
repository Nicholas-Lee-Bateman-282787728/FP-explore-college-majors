While some of the video criticism of this production may have merit, any criticism of the sound quality, in my humble opinion, is totally with out merit. I have no sophisticated sound system, but, simply head phones connected to my video theater arrangement which draws its amplification only from my Samsung TV and the sound is excellent, virtually noiseless and with completely acceptable fidelity. However, as another reviewer has noted, this production is not about the video or sound quality. I have virtually the entire record of the 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics recorded on BETA Tape. To realize the happenings in Sarajevo barely ten years later in light of those wonderfully staged Winter Games is deeply saddening and disturbing as one more historic example of man's despicable ability to inflict pain, suffering and destruction upon innocents and in the name of some misguided religious dogma. It is gratifying that at least some of the Sarajevo perpetrators have had to answer for their atrocities.",1483056000,,1072,5.166666666666667

7850121,5,6303477216,"For all these reviewers that complain about the quality of sound, camera and so on: the choice of visual scenes of war has nothing to do with some kind of ""putting a visual comment to the music"". It only shows how in the middle of the war insanity the power of music gives those people the strength to put this kind of project to its feet. I am proud to have been a part of it, recording such a monumental piece in the ruins of Bosnia&Herzegovina's National Library and not knowing if the ruin's gonna smash us all during the recording. I agree that the sound and video quality is bad, but it's a precious document.",1365897600,3,615,4.310344827586207

However I was unable to receive idirectly, because of term of sales: it cannot be sold outside the USA. So I had to ship it to friends, in order to be able to get it.
Don't you believe that such limits are useless? Except of course for sensitive items!",1239580800,,311,4.114754098360656
7850123,4,6303477216,"This concert is a somber statement of war and man's senseless inhumanity, and also his ability to rise above the horrors he has created. With this glorious Mozart Requiem, God triumphs over evil, and a little light shines in the darkness.
It is a mass for the many souls slaughtered in Sarajevo, and interspersed with the concert is footage of the city being bombed, burning ruins, and its children caught in the conflict.
The performers are on a platform built in what was left of the magnificent National Library, with Zubin Mehta leading the Philharmonic Orchestra of Sarajevo. The sound is dreadful, rather like a bootleg tape, but this is not something to buy only for its musical value, but rather to in some small way, share in the experience. Bass Ruggero Raimondi fares the best among the singers, and though Jose Carreras sounds tired, his phrasing and soulful quality are those of  a master tenor, and his ""Mors slopebit et natora"" (my favorite section in the entire piece) is gentle and lovely. Also singing are Cecilia Gasdia, soprano, and Ildiko Komlosi, alto. Total running time is 50 minutes.
The text of Mozart's Requiem is so appropriate, in its solemnity and also in its ultimate hope of redemption. God bless the courageous participants in this concert.
""Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine,
et lux perpetua luceat eis,
cum sanetis tuis in aeternum,
quia plus es"".
""Grant the dead eternal rest, O Lord,
and may perpetual light shine on them,
with Thy saints for ever,
because Thou art merciful"".",1080345600,5,1513,4.88715953307393
7850124,5,6303477216,"It's not about the music, Dummy.
I found this to be one of the most dramatic examples of courage and the human spirit - related to the arts - that I have ever seen!
To just imagine the evil of their situation in Sarajevo 1994, a city that less than a decade earlier had been site for the Winter Olympics. For this city to become a killing field by Serb snipers in the mountains that surround Sarajevo is my definition of human obscenity. Their library was the very symbol of enlightenment between three different cultures that had existed in community for centuries.
People were being shot while trying to get water back to their apartments and cellars - where they were trying to survive the siege. Imaging polishing up YOUR violin skills in a cold, dark room - alone. Imagine walking down the street carrying your instument knowing that you might be shot dead at any moment. Might make concentrating on Mozart a bit more difficult.
Why would a conductor, a camera team or sound engineer want to even do something like this? To get the best music or video?
Their reason: Not to give in to the forces of evil and brutility and ugliness. To look death and evil in the face and make music!
Astounding.
The reviewer from Florida comparing this to a TV hunger drive and to complain about bad camera angles should pull himself away from his Pro-Wrestling Channel, turn off his TV and read the book, ""War is a Force that Gives Us Meaning"" by Chris Hedges.
Perhaps then, he could be worthy of offering a critique of a Mozart performance. Or Zubin Mehta.
We are honored to have such people - however rare - in this world to show us the way to keeping our humanity.

7850125,1,6303477216,"This Requiem version is such a painful experience to watch. I've never been so dissapointed with a performance of my favorite Requiem. Sound is bad, and not even Dolby Digital, video quality is VHS quality, plus camera work is awful, mistakes everywhere, bad design. When the camera is not in the orchestra, they put some footage from the Sarajevo war, very depressing and manipulative. The last straw was in ""Rex Tremendae"". The lyrics of this majestic movement are about the majesty of God and His glory. These ignorant producers put footage of a building in flames during this piece, a building in flames to describe the majesty of God?!?!? It looked like something satanic instead. I can't believe Zubin Mehta, who obviously had to be aware of this poor choice, and obviously has to know the meaning of the latin lyrics of the Requiem (I hope he does), allowed this to happen. It's a nightmare or a bad joke. Stay away from this version. It should never had been produced. It's an embarrassment.",1016496000,7,999,4.780346820809249
7850126,2,6303477216,"The only reason I gave it an extra star, is because Mozart still speaks to us with his haunting Requiem. The quality of the video and the music is horrendous--not to mention a good amount of war torn Sarajevo. If I wanted  to see painful images, I would of tuned to one of those hunger drives on  TV.",936921600,8,300,4.155172413793103
