8654047,5,B00JVQ7R4Q,"I bought the DVD through Sarina Jain's website.  I got it last week and have been excited to try it out.  Today was my first time through, and I was not disappointed.

I love Zumba because of a really amazing instructor I had before I moved away a couple years ago.  I'd lost 20 pounds in a few months and was feeling really great going to Zumba classes nearly every day.  Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find a suitable replacement for her and have consequently put on a few pounds.  I decided to look for a new workout video that might re-motivate me to regularly shake my booty again.

I heard about Masala Bhangra on a website talking about new workouts, and it said there were classes people could take, but they are in New York and India!  Not so close to me.  So I looked for a DVD and found it.  Because the internet is cool that way.

This video was great for me.  First off, Sarina Jain and all the ladies dancing with her are totally modest.  Their clothing was not a distraction, and I won't be embarrassed playing the DVD with my teenagers around.  They may even do the workout with me!

Secondly, the steadiness of the beat is very appealing.  Sarina Jain keeps it easy to follow by being consistent in her timing.  She also gives clear directions as to what will come next.  There is usually a reminder in the corner of the screen to tell the viewer what the next move will be, too.

Third, it's a fantastic workout!  It's low impact (done without even wearing shoes!) but it is a dance that gets put together by the end.  So I feel like I'm really dancing.  And I love feeling like I'm learning something that I may use later instead of how aerobics is just a series of movements that have no real flow or beauty.  This didn't feel like a workout.  It was a pleasure to learn.  Don't get me wrong  it was tough in some spots to keep moving!  It was challenging but still fun.

I like Sarina Jain's personality.  She has specific phrases she likes to use again and again, but it doesn't bother me.  Her voice sounds like a knowledgeable big sister who is fun and upbeat, but not barking and demanding.  I can see why people like her.

I would recommend the DVD to those who want to try something new and who enjoy Bollywood music and moves.  I would like to try more of them, too!  If I were more ambitious, I may certify as an instructor and bring it to the Western US!",1445817600,7,2391,4.275167785234899
