8052763,5,B0007WFXLW,"""30 Days Until I'm Famous"" is a quirky film about a man who helps to transform a package carrier into a star.

8052767,3,B0007WFXLW,"This movie is a cute love story, though I can see why it was made for TV.  Other than a brief appearance by Carmen Electra (thankfully brief), I thought the cast was well-chosen for this story line.  It helps that Sean Patrick Flannery is adorable.",1231200000,2,248,4.488888888888889

8052769,5,B0007WFXLW,This movie is so much better than you would think you'd get from vh1. It's cute and funny with some pretty good music. Sean Patrick Flanery makes every minute worth watching. Although I have to admit I've had a thing for him for quite some time. I think that anyone who likes light romantic comedies won't be disappointed.,1156723200,12,322,4.568965517241379
8052770,4,B0007WFXLW,"I'll have to agree with Sarah.  I too have a thing for Sean Patrick Flanery and he is part of the reason I have even watched this more than once.  I enjoy Cole and Maggie's onscreen chemistry. I especially love Mindy Sterling's character as the 'cultural identity faciliator'...she's a hoot.  It's a nice 'escape' movie and yes, very much like a romance novel on film.  I enjoyed it and highly recommend it.",1156291200,7,407,4.611111111111111
