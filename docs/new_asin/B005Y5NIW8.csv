8489135,5,B005Y5NIW8,"I was finally able to find this great show that I grew up watching. Why they don't release it in the US, I don't know, but with the simple purchase of a region-free DVD player, I was at last able to own and enjoy.",1332720000,,213,3.8636363636363638
8489136,5,B005Y5NIW8,"You'll need a region-free code-free DVD player with a built-in PAL converter to play this in the US.  (These can be found fairly easily and relatively inexpensively online, by the way.)  Fine transfers and sound.  Why these have never been released domestically I never will understand.  Subtitles can be eliminated by scrolling through the four languages until the 'none' option is available.  Well worth it if you enjoyed the series.

Fine US seller and shipping, by the way.  The only other alternatives are to try to order from Europe (which will be much more expensive).  These have also been released in Australia; again, much more expensive and you'll still need the international DVD player I described.",1329177600,,711,5.068965517241379
