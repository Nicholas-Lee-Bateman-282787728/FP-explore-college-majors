6728858,5,B00O83UPAK,"FINALLY!  Been waiting years for this one. Staged on beaches adjacent to where my wife grew up.  There are actually incalculably more beaches superior to that setting, but Clans holding those places were too greedy to reach financial agreements. Pity...",1415750400,,253,5.3
6728859,5,B00O83UPAK,"We loved Survivor Samoa.  The people were great players and the challenges were hard,  Sad when Mike Barossi had to get Medical and leave the game to go to the hospital.",1412726400,,169,4.419354838709677

6728863,5,B00O83UPAK,"The only negative is the lack of closed captioning and that is the fault of CBS, no Amazon",1471910400,,90,4.055555555555555

I loved it, my favorite ""Survivor 'Opening'"" is probably Kelly B. because I feel that way sometimes, too, you know? Her intro shot, is great. Oh, this's Survivor: Samoa. I really liked, Natalie's ""Survivor 'Opening'"" intro shot, because I feel like, she's going, ""Oh my word""! Or some derivative and I greatly, relate to that moment, in time.",1465776000,,519,6.984615384615385

6728868,5,B00O83UPAK,Bought all 3 seasons with Russell in them.  Just to go back and reminisce the seasons.  Excellent quality DVDs.,1457568000,2,111,4.7894736842105265
6728869,5,B00O83UPAK,"Having seen Survivor: Samoa when it aired, I got this for my father for Christmas, as he watched his first season this past year. Russell Hantz played a flawless game, and my father loved *every second* right up until the end.  Great season, great purchase.",1454716800,2,257,4.711111111111111

6728872,3,B00O83UPAK,"Can't say I care much for the person that won this season in comparison to who should have won it, but this was a great season. Russell made this season enjoyable. For awhile, I was waiting and waiting for the others to vote him out, but the more I watched him, the more I was rooting for him.",1440028800,,293,4.068965517241379
6728873,5,B00O83UPAK,"well, what can I say about Survivor!!!! My daughter kep saying I can't believe that you aren't into survivor!!!!!  So about 5 years ago I started watching it. So I decided that I wanted to watch it from the very first season, low and behold I find out that I am addicted to it......I absolutely love it. I can't wait for the next season to start, however I have purchased around six seasons and I find out that I can't get enough.....I know this sounds crazy, but I am trying to catch up on what I missed. It's great, you find that you can't get enough, and you find yourself binging on a season......I find myself in front of the tv at 1am in the morning just finishing up a season....call me crazy!!!!!",1435968000,,704,4.293233082706767
6728874,2,B00O83UPAK,That season was very boring !,1434931200,,29,4.0
6728875,1,B00O83UPAK,"It doesn't even deserve a star. The winner did not deserve it, and it is an embarrassment to the show. I have watched every season, and it is fair to say, it leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth...even worse then the jury when they voted for the winner. It will be a waste of your time.",1434326400,,294,4.0

Posses their weak minds",1431388800,,70,4.916666666666667
6728879,5,B00O83UPAK,"This series established Russell Hantz as the epitome of ""Survivor"" villains. Apparently Russell was a student of ""Survivor"" villainy, and did a remarkable job of eliminating virtially everyone who stood in his way. I won't reveal how the series ended, in case you haven't seen it, but this is priobably one of the most entertaining of all ""Survivor"" seasons.",1431129600,,358,5.084745762711864
6728880,5,B00O83UPAK,"Up until season 19 the show had become a little stagnant. But then, Russell Hantz energized the game and the way it has been played ever since.  A master manipulator that energized the show like never before. Highly recommended season for anyone that hasn't seen it or for a second viewing as I'm about to indulge in.",1429920000,,317,4.56140350877193

6728903,5,B00O83UPAK,"As with every season, I found myself on the edge, waiting to see what was going to happen next.  From, perhaps the worst conditions, to the never ending antics from one of the most memorable ""bad guys"" ever in the game, this season was exceptional.  If that is not enough, the background of Samoa was so beautiful.",1420156800,4,314,4.491228070175438

6728908,5,B00O83UPAK,"A must see!!!
The way RUSSEL played truly changed survivor forever.  His mission: to lie, use others and and cause misery. He stole tride mates items, hid tools and called the women bitches. With all of this Russel has to be one of the strongest and smartest players of the game.  He found idols without clues and won challenges. He made tribe mates question how they really see themselves in and outside the game",1418083200,,413,4.5675675675675675
6728909,5,B00O83UPAK,Great Season of Survivor. Not the best winner but there where really good players in this season number 1 is Russell best survivor of all time! People are so slack on him. He's plays to win and if he hurts people doing that well that's to bad I would do the same as what he does to get to the end of the game. I hope to see Russell again he's a champion.,1417910400,2,354,3.863013698630137

8682464,5,B00O83UPAK,"i havnt seen so much rain in my life. Physically demanding. Person who won was most deserving. the lying little rat made the finals but didn't win 'sole Survivor. loved the tension. Russell had the very best plan to win, but not get the Million.",1523577600,,245,4.466666666666667
8682465,4,B00O83UPAK,"I gave this 4 stars because there's no option to give it 4 &1/2 stars which is what I really wanna give it, I feel it's worthy of 4 &1/2 but not 5 so in the end I was forced to give it 4, perhaps I'll be in a better position to judge it after I actually watch it ..these are my pre-thoughts on the show in question, stay tuned for further details.",1500854400,,347,3.767123287671233

8682468,4,B00O83UPAK,"If you hate/don't like Russel Hantz then good luck watching this season. To everyone it's it's an entertaining season that has many firsts in the game of Survivor. Not as good on rewatch as some other seasons, but I'd rank it in the top half after 33 seasons.",1483315200,,259,4.416666666666667
8682469,5,B00O83UPAK,good,1482278400,,4,4.0
8682470,5,B00O83UPAK,"Russell Hanz may be a conniving villan, but he knows how to play the game.  He found 2 immunity idols w/o clues (the first person to do that in the history of Survivor) and when the merge came, his team was outnumbered 8 to 4, but he managed to turn the numbers around by getting rid of the opposing team one by one.",1480723200,2,316,4.015873015873016
