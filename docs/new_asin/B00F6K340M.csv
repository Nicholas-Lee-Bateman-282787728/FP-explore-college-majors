8612709,5,B00F6K340M,"Don't let the name fool you. Just because it has ""Yuri"" in it, doesn't make it a Yuri anime. Yes, it has Yuri moments, but when looked as a whole, I consider Yuru Yuri to be more Slice of Life/ Comedy. Really funny! A good time to be had by all. The characters all have their unique quirks and over and above all else, you can't go wrong with watching this show. I originally watched it on Crunchy Roll and I knew I had to buy it. Hilarious situations, funny as well as touching moments, and Chitose.....(You'll know what I mean if you already watched this :D). I give this anime a easy 4.4 out of 5 stars.
