3827381,3,B001XRLWLU,"i gotta say that i really enjoyed the whole series until the very last few minutes.  after 16 episodes and that's how it ends?!  if this was the original ending, then i'm glad that it didn't last beyond the first year!

 i had been planning on buying it but now i think i'll just wait for the BBC version to come to america (besides i liked the BBC version better)",1238716800,6,364,4.1571428571428575
3827382,5,B001XRLWLU,"Just like a person who dies at a young age, this show was dropped right as it was hitting its stride.  I watched this show from the very first episode and LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it.  The acting was superb.  Michael Imperioli and Harvey Keitel were brilliant, as were Jason O'Mara and
Gretchen Mol.  Since I grew up in the 70's, I was amazed at how effective the writers were able to capture that time period.  I couldn't wait each week to see what song choices would be selected for each episode. I was
crushed when it was cancelled but have to give credit to the writers for
closing up a very complicated plot in 10 minutes.  The ending, while rushed, did answer many questions for a very clever show. I will
certainly buy the DVD to have something decent to watch since network
television cannot keep any quality shows.",1238716800,102,818,4.456375838926174
3827383,5,B001XRLWLU,"I watched this show from its first episode and absolutely fell in love with the whole premise of the show.  Was he in a coma, was he hovering near death in 2008 and just dreaming of his time travel, was he perhaps knocked into a parallel universe where he was indeed in 1973?  Even though the plot line was borrowed from overseas, the cast, stories, and acting were all top notch and made Wednesday evenings a MUST SEE night.  Interestingly, I was 23 years old in '73.  It was great to see that time in my life so accurately depicted, which on one hand made me long for that simpler time in my life when I was young, and on the other hand made me wonder how we possibly got by without computers, cell phones and all of todays marvels of technology.  I guess I've become spoiled.  The biggest sin is that they ended this fantastic series so soon.  They could have easily kept us all going for another season or two.  Although one writer suggested that they would like alternate endings to the series, I kind of liked the way everything was summed up.  I'm doing my pre-ordering now, and I can't wait 'til it gets here, but I'm sure gonna miss this show.  BTW, this show also made a huge Gretchen Mol fan out of me. One reviewer referred to her as ""enchanting"".  A very fitting description...Carmine",1238630400,9,1297,4.384937238493724
3827384,5,B001XRLWLU,"I loved this show when it aired on ABC. I never missed an episode. I laughed many times and was very impressed by how it really looked like 1973. The actors? They looked like they belonged in that era. And though I have never seen the British version, I applaud the Amercan version. Sad to see it go, but I will definitely get the DVDs to watch any time I please. No matter how crammed the ending may seem. I think it tied it all up neatly instead of leaving you hanging as some other shows do.",1238630400,67,494,4.103092783505154
3827385,5,B001XRLWLU,"UPDATE: I have since seen the UK version of Life on Mars, overall I think the UK version was a much better series with an undoubtedly better ending! I still like the US version for it's US-familiar references and overall it's good storyline (MINUS the ending...I still just stop the DVD on the last episode before the goofy ending scenes), but once you figure out some of the things they reference in the UK version it is very enjoyable! :)

I liked the plot of the entire series, if only ABC hadn't killed it in the last 10 minutes of the last episode. While i can see how the ending sort of fits, the buildup from the beginning was in a whole different direction. Also, if ABC had put Life on Mars BEFORE Lost instead of after, they would have gotten a lot more viewers. The devoted Lost fans would surely change to their station at least 5 minutes early and say ""hey this looks cool maybe ill catch it next week before my favorite show"" instead of after where the Lost fans are still taking in their show and probably about to go do something else. Nevertheless, it was one of the few shows I truly loved for its idea and plot without it being stupid or just plain funny. But one thing I am hoping for in the DVD: an alternate ending to the last episode!",1238544000,8,1257,4.281512605042017
3827386,5,B001XRLWLU,"...and give them to the actors and writers behind Life On Mars.  That's my prediction...another case of ""posthumous award giving"".  The observation has been made that the American LOM has been adapted from the British version but I understand that the US production followed the original storyline for a while and then took a few radical turns.  Variations on a theme, I guess, but it has been quite a ride.  I assumed that they would have to bring this story to a conclusion within a couple of seasons because the premise just couldn't be strung out forever but ABC sure isn't doing it justice or doing us any favors by cutting it short and telling the producers to wrap it up prematurely.

If you didn't love Harvey Keitel before this series then you owe it to yourself to watch all of these episodes.  Michael Imperioli absolutely rules as Ray...I swear that I knew this character back in the Seventies...really.  Gretchen Mol is just enchanting.  Jason O'Mara makes his lost-in-time character so sympathetic that you can't help but worry about where he'll end up in the end.

So long, Life On Mars...it was all too brief but it was wonderful.",1238544000,112,1146,4.71859296482412
3827387,4,B001XRLWLU,"With a unusual twist to a cop series. You have one of the most inspirational shows that teaches you each day that everyone has a choice, it might not be the easiest choice, but thats life in the 1970s. It is very unfortunate to see a great show that gives people the ability to change ones so called ""fate"". But even if cut short, this cop series is worth taking a look at.",1238457600,2,373,4.123287671232877

3827440,2,B001XRLWLU,"Seemed like a good idea to buy this, based on the positive reviews, but unfortunately it doesn't hold a candle to the original British show.  The main bones of contention I have with this film are a.) the lead is way too bland and uninteresting and b.) a couple of characters are too old to believeably play the parts.  I like Harvey Keitel, but he's just a bit too old for his role, and Lisa Bonet is about twenty-five years too old to play the main guy's girlfriend!  On top of that the period music is not used to good effect, as it is in the British version, and the sense of humor and irony in the original is completely lost here.  I would give it a miss -- gave up after about five shows.",1467158400,5,695,4.125925925925926
3827441,5,B001XRLWLU,I really like this series. It always kept me guessing as to what was really going on in Sam Tyler's life. One thing I like and appreciate - though it only lasted one season - it had a conclusion to the story.  This is the American version of the British series Life on Mars. The first few episodes of both series are pretty much the same. Then the American version starts taking on it's own identity. I like both versions. The British version has nudity in 2 episodes.  While the American version lasts only one season it has 17 episodes. The British version has two seasons but has only 16 episodes - 8 episodes for each season. I watched both the American version and the British version on Netflix before buying the American version. If you decide to buy the British version make sure you get the COMPLETE SERIES.  If you buy Season 1 and Season 2 separately you will be paying around $20 more than if you buy the complete series.,1465344000,3,933,4.412790697674419

3827452,5,B001XRLWLU,"This was a short lived TV series, but such a great one to watch.  Whoever did the casting for this show knew what they were doing because they got such a great group together.  These actors just mesh together so well from beginning to end.  Plus, as a kid of the 1970's, it takes me back to a time that I still look back fondly on to this day.  Were the '70's perfect? Absolutely not!  Were they a much more fun, innocent, and less politically correct time than now?  Absolutely YES!  No show can capture exactly what it was like to have lived back then, but this show comes close.  Forget ""That '70's Show.""  Watch this one instead to get a little better feel for that time period.  I'd say this show is kind of a combination of SciFi, fantasy, and cop show wrapped into one with an interesting story line that will keep you wondering what will happen next.  Was the end of the show a little odd?  Well, yeah.  Initially I didn't care for it.  However, years later, I look back and think, ""o.k., I guess it was an interesting concept for the overall premise of the show.""  If you don't want to watch the last episode to understand what is really going on and get the answers you seek, then you can skip it and it would still be an interesting way for the viewer to end it on their own.  Nevertheless, the cinematography is excellent, the outside street shots and inside sets from top to bottom had such an authentic feel of the '70's (they must have spent a good amount of their budget on this alone and the person in charge should get an award for all the effort - if he/she didn't already), the choice of music was a good selection of hits from back then (could have thrown in a few more, but I'm sure it would have cost too much money for the TV show to handle), and the acting was superb!  I would recommend this box set because it is a great deal for a small price.",1452816000,6,1871,4.21067415730337

I've seen both the British and American version, and despite often identical stories (the American version copied the British one) I have enjoyed them both immensely. People have complained about this one being glossier than the British version, but so what? How does having a larger budget and better effects make something automatically be bad? This series is still story-driven. The computer effects are mostly to remove modern images: it's not as though there are sharks or dinosaurs all over the place.

3827467,5,B001XRLWLU,"If you like realistic law enforcement shows, I encourage you to buy this one. It was adapted from a British show, which I haven't seen. Hollywood almost never gets it right when it comes to depicting law enforcement accurately. I spent six years in NCIS and find that show, together with JAG, to be entertaining but also very unrealistic.

Life on Mars combines real world law enforcement of the 1970s with time travel. Except for a transplant from the Sopranos, I didn't recognize any of the actors. The lead has since gone on to star in Terra Nova. Everyone does an outstanding job of depicting their characters and interacting with one another. The end has an unexpected twist. The only problem I have with this series is that it only lasted one season. This is sad considering the Hollywood garbage that gets renewed.",1435363200,,821,4.741258741258742

3827486,3,B001XRLWLU,"First of all, SPOILER ALERT! I will be mentioning plot points from this product in the course of my review. Don't read any further if this will drive you crazy.
Cards on the table, I am English and I therefore saw Life on Mars in its original two season British incarnation first. I then saw the three seasons of Ashes to Ashes, the sequel series. The five of them turn out a complete story that leaves you clawing at your rent heartstrings and laughing your head off at the insensitive forty years out-of-date sense of humour of the country's toughest cop, Gene Hunt.
All questions are answered, all puzzling elements dragged into the light (quite literally!) and all things explained.
Well, I generally have a low opinion of American television in general and ESPECIALLY American conversions of British products. I was therefore very happy to find myself pretty much enjoying this offering, especially once it found its own feet and started writing for itself. (The first few episodes very closely follow their British counterparts, even to the point of making key shots absolute mirrors!)
Detective Sam Tyler is a modern, techno-savvy, sophisticated police officer in the year 2008. He uses computers, DNA profiling, social media scanning.... Imagine his feeling of being a fish out of water then, when one day he is violently struck by a car and apparently dies on the tarmac, only to wake up in the exact same spot thirty five years earlier! This part is beautifully constructed with Tyler staring in awestruck disbelief at the World Trade Centre in front of him, apparently unscratched and terrorist-free.
He is in 1973. Or is he? Is he truly back in time? Or hallucinating in a coma? Has he gone mad? Is he in a parallel universe? It might as well be on another planet, especially when he finds out how the police work in this place. 1973 is a place of beating confessions out of suspects, planting evidence to frame people for crimes when you can't prove the ones you're sure they DID commit, and kicking doors open rather than waiting for search warrants.
This is all administered by Sam's new boss back here (and apparently they were expecting his arrival - curiouser and curiouser), Lieutenant Gene Hunt. Hunt is an old-school anachronism even by the standards of the 1970's. He's rough, he's tough, he's the darkest knight of knights in the drip-dry tights and just the mention of his name can make most criminals soil themselves in terror.
Here's my first problem. Harvey Keitel is cast as Gene Hunt and on the face of it he might seem to be the ideal American adaptation of Philip Glenister's UK version. But Gene Hunt was a physical, intimidating being. Glenister could do that. He had the physical presence. Harvey Keitel is too damn scrawny (sorry Harvey). He doesn't impose, although he does do his best with the considerable acting powers at his disposal. Standing next to the very solid Jason o'Mara (playing Same Tyler), he looks like a kid brother. It isn't believable when he punches Sam in the guts and doubles him over.
Secondly, when either Gene has mellowed after a few drinks, he shows warmth and a more likeable side. Both versions eventually warm to Sam's modern approach to policing, recognising his cerebral approach, whilst always saying Sam should learn to follow his gut more often. Glenister does this a LOT more convincingly than Keitel. Glenister's Gene Hunt is easier to see a nice guy inside, deeply hidden under all the machismo and hyperbole.
Thirdly, Glenister's version is FAR FAR FAR FAR FAR better at humour than Keitel's. Perhaps some of this is my natural understanding of dry British humour more than anything attempted in the American show, but Glenister could make me die laughing without appearing to be trying to be funny. Keitel's couldn't and the humour seemed very laboured. Shades of the American version of Red Dwarf perhaps? If there is one thing our two countries cannot reconcile themselves over, despite sharing a common language, it is our senses of humour.
But the guts of the series is an enjoyable romp. We love to put ourselves in Sam Tyler's position. Many of us feel just a bit envious at his waking up in a simpler and less politically correct age and an Englishman can enjoy this in the American series just as much as he can in the British one. Perhaps we have the advantage over Americans in this case, as the UK has been culturally colonised by the US ever since the Second World War and most of us would recognise American pop-culture references.
But despite the good writing and the adventurous pace, we have to get down to it. The ending. Prevailing opinion on both sides of the Pond seems to be that the British one is better than the American. Here is where the spoilers really start to kick in folks, so be warned!
In the last couple of episodes of the last series of Ashes to Ashes, the British sequel to Life on Mars, we get the answer to just what exactly Gene Hunt's world is. It's a type of purgatory. A limbo, bridging the gap between the world of the living and the heaven or hell that awaits all souls in the end. EVERYONE permanently resident in it, in the British version, is dead. (Or in Sam's case, very close to being dead.) Occasionally, Gene's World touches the real world and events done by Sam in 1973 can affect ones in the ""real"" 2006 future.
In 1953 a skinny nineteen year old copper called Gene Hunt, a lad with an imagination far greater than his abilities or experience (he's only been in the job a few weeks) is shot dead by a gang of armed robbers he mistakes for a bunch of troublesome kids.
But Gene's internal picture of himself as the sheriff, like Gary Cooper in High Noon (his favourite movie), is so strong that he doesn't pass away entirely. His imagination is so powerful that he creates around him in the limbo a world that is dated to the decade he died in - gradually advancing forward through time.
And so strong is the force of his imagination in creating this world that souls are drawn toward him. Police officers who died with issues, emotional upsets or violent endings at the hands of criminals, are drawn to his spirit like a moth to a flame and here they serve out their time, resolving their issues and then finally moving on. Only Gene stays permanently though; far too attached to the World he's created, far too good at his role of shepherd to the universe's lost police souls to want to move on. Just yet anyway. Everything in Gene Hunt's World takes on the context of cops and robbers essentially and given his self-appointed role of non-politically correct sheriff, the time setting is always a few decades behind the real world. So when Sam is nearly killed in 2006 in the UK version, his soul joins Gene's in a facsimile of 1973.
Gene Hunt's magnetic presence and the strength of his World's reality is so strong that when the UK's Sam recovers from his coma and goes back to the ""real world"" in 2006, he finds himself pining for ""1973"" (as did the whole of the UK!) and his buddies Annie, Ray, Chris and Gene. He then commits suicide by hurling himself off the top of an eight storey police station and wakes up back in Gene Hunt's World, just in time to save his team from a group of armed train robbers.
And in the American version? It was all virtual reality. All the characters were really in hibernation on a spaceship heading to Mars and this was what they were keeping their brains busy with. The year is 2035 and the hypersleep simulation should have showed them being cops in 2008, but then a meteoroid strike on the ship caused a computer glitch which threw it back to 1973.
WHAT?!?!?!?
As series finishes go, this is lamer than a one-legged racing tortoise. I do realise that ABC rather stupidly cancelled the series and the writers had to come up with a finish earlier than they intended, but seriously, this is the best they could come up with? Gene Hunt is a Martian astronaut?!
This is where the series shoots itself in the foot most powerfully. Everything was undone by this. In the British version the worth of people's actions grew and grew until in the last episode of Ashes to Ashes the team were fighting what appeared to be the Devil himself, come to rip apart Gene's World once and for all. People's very souls were up for grabs. In this, oh it was only a game. None of it was real or mattered a damn to anyone.
Not since Pam Ewing woke up to find out that a whole season of Dallas had been a dream and that her dead husband Bobby was taking a refreshing morning shower, has a script-writer taken a bigger steaming dump on a series. Nothing any of the characters had done, felt or accomplished meant anything. It all might just as well have been a video game.
But I can't get away from the fact that I rather enjoyed the first sixteen episodes. If the series had either finished its first season and then renewed for a second, or gone the full twenty two episodes and then come up with something meaningful as an ending, I could only have really grumbled about Hunt's casting. This series really IS rather good.
Sadly with such a smeg-awful ending, it's like eating the world's finest chocolate cake only to find out the icing was made from horse dung.",1426809600,,9211,4.603406326034063

3827528,5,B001XRLWLU,"What a brilliant TV show!!! I've watched the UK original and it is amazing though I think for me the US version is better simply because the show is so based upon the surroundings and slang.....and many of the UK slangs of the time and places completely lose me where US ones and New York is easy to grasp. Many of the same stories are re-told from the original UK show so how can one trash it?

I think the main reason this show didn't last but a season is because, in keeping with the times presented, certain racial and other things that were common in life, moreso in 1970's cop show portrayals, were accurately presented here for the sake of being believable for 1973! I especially applaud the producer's use of film or film simulation when he goes into the past!

This show had enough options and twist to have run strong 5 seasons but we'll never know because MORONS who worry about being 'politically correct' (something that didn't exist in good ol' 1973) are the same MORONS that want to sanitize are children's history books!

As good as the UK version was, I think I prefer the American for its exceptional cast.  Jason O'Mara (Terra Nova) is great and Harvey Keitel steals every scene he is in.  Michael Imperioli (Sopranos) is very fine also.  And I have to admit the careful recreation of American pop culture from the '70's tickled me in a way the less familiar UK playback couldn't quite do.

Since this review is for the American version (starring Jason O'Mara and his gorgeous blue eyes) I will stick with that version.  First of all, the music is phenominal!  So many amazing 70's tunes are used in this series that it is worth watching for that alone.  In addition to the great music, there is an excellent cast of talented actors (who all look suitable dorky in their 70's outfits).  The story goes a little crazy at the end (since they found out they would not be renewing the series and had to wrap it up rather quickly) but it still manages to entertain throughout.  I tricked my friend into watching this (she hates sci-fi and would have refused to watch it if she knew what was really going on) and she loved it (even though she was pissed at the ending).",1407456000,,936,4.541666666666667

Gretchen Mol is hot, hot hot!!! and Jason O'Mara makes me think of a more tough version of a young James Caan circa 1975. In one scene where Keitel kicks in a door and O'Mara asks ""do you have a warrant""? and Keitel responds with the kick and says ""here is my warrant"" probably would not have happened in 1973.  The exclusionary rule was quite alive and well since Mapp vs. Ohio was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1961 so any evidence obtained by the kick-in would have been subject to a motion to suppress.

3827598,5,B001XRLWLU,"This is one of those shows that was well thought out and well executed but for odd reasons that only a fan of Firefly can truly appreciate, it never caught on with the American public...which is a shame.
Life on Mars was originally a Brit show, CBS bought the rights and retooled the concept to the U.S. market, though the themes and and plot lines echo its BBC original.  All that said, this is one of the fee US reboots of a Brit show I can truly say that I enjoyed more than its original (and yes I have watched them both).

The plot involves detective Sam Tyler, a modern cop involved in a hit and run accident.  He wakes up post accident in 1973, right down to the polyester and large collars.  In 1973 he is a cop too, but it is a different world...like living on Mars (get it? get it?).  He now works within the Serpico era NYPD, rife with corruption, violence and sexism and his 2000s morality and techniques stand out like a sore thumb, often rubbing co-workers the wrong way.  Throughout the show Sam wrestles with a number of issues and questions continually rise as to if he is dead, insane, in a coma or other.

CBS was kind enough when the axed the show to let it run out its story acrh, so there is a resolution (I will tell you it is not the same as the Brit. ending) and it does not end in TV Land limbo.

The premise was interesting- Sam, a 2008 N.Y. cop, after being injured, wakes up in 1973 to find things are much different. Weird things happen to him while he tries to figure out what's going on. He also must now contend with crime as a police officer in a totally different decade. The characters are neat- Harvey Keitel and Michael Imperioli are both awesome as Sam's fellow cops. They bring so much to the show. Another good thing about the show is the music played in each episode. I may be mistaken but I believe all the original music from the show was left on the dvd so that is good. And since the creators knew the show was going to be cancelled, all the storylines are tied up so we are not left with a frustrating cliffhanger a la ""Twin Peaks.""

3827627,3,B001XRLWLU,"Saw the British series first. This is a pale approximation despite following the British plots and even the dialogue with only revisions for American instead of British slang. Later shows go off on their own, developing their own style.

None of the characters are developed to the degree that they were in the British series which may be as a result of American TV having more commercials and less running time for the actual show. Hence the different dynamics between the different characters is missing which gave the British series much more depth.

Not bad, and better than much American TV, but it loses too much from the British version. Watch the British version, it has its flaws but is superior to this.

The Second disc improves, greatly. One reason is that it strikes out on its own as far as plots are concerned. The American show is much more plot driven than the British version which is more character driven. The two shows wind up being two different cups of tea (or coffee).

If one hasn't seen either of the shows, I'd recommend that the American series be watched first and the British series second.",1358467200,4,1120,4.698979591836735

I wish more shows were made where the series is short enough to explore the basic concepts without rehashing the story line until you can't wait for it all to end.  The 1970's soundtrack, clothes, cars and social attitudes will just blow you away.  The set contains four DVD's which look and sound great on modern TV sets.  Disk 2 has 5 episodes and the other three disks contain four.

The original was so good that this show couldn't help but feel like a dissappointment. They did try though. You can see the effort they put into the look of the show. I stayed with the show for it's entire run because it had hints of greatness: brilliant flashes of the surreal (the twin towers shot was awesome), a great cast (Imperioli nails it), and just (and I mean just) enough mystery to keep me coming back for more. Two solid episodes are the ones where he meets his parents respectively and they get to some of the core ideas of the premise. Most other episode just seems to meander as a period piece mystery show.
  So what happened? They didn't get renewed and the ending slapped it's audience across the face then gave us a giant middle finger. So yes, I wanted it to be better than it was. But given where they went with the ending, I don't think it ever would have been.

3827636,4,B001XRLWLU,"Having been a good for nothing, pot smoking, Hard Rock loving seventies kid (who grew out of it, thank God!)I had a pretty good prespective from which to view this series and I have to say I thought it was done pretty well. And because I was all of the above I feel that the key to the series was the fantastic use of the music of that period to drive the program. If my description of myself in some way fits your own, then I think you will love the way the music was incorperated into this series.

Not every episode is a stone cold knock out, but overall from episode to episode, the series is solid. The acting is good, and many times the episodes not only look seventies, but also have the feel of a seventies Police drama, which means it is a little campy, but also it has to do with the background music which seems to have come straight from Mannix (or whatever other 70's Police drama you want to name). Having read other reviews I noticed that many people hated the ending. I loved it! I thought it was perfect. So, in that regard, it is to each his own. And by the way, if you have not watched this series, don't read the review below titled ""Life on Planet Imagine"". To a large extent, it gives away the ending.

My only complaint (and that is why I give it four stars) is that throughout the whole series you get the feeling that the makers are portraying the seventies as the bad ole days, vs. our current times, which of course is the ""age of enlightenment"". It is the same old Hollywood stuff that you see over and over again in that regard. For me, that kind of thing gets a little preachy, although I certainly understand that Sam Tyler would suffer culture shock going back to that period, I could do without some of the agenda driven (in my opinion) preaching. But all in all, a worthwhile pick-up for anyone who lived through, or are interested in the seventies.",1335916800,4,1883,4.286516853932584
3827637,2,B001XRLWLU,"I watched, and mostly enjoyed, the british original show a great deal. It had its faults, but its great strength was the unvarnished look of the past. This wasn't rosy nostalgia, there was a harsh veracity to it. The largest , of several , problems with the US remake was that it refused to do that. This was a cosy movie version of the early 70s in NY. It was all golden light and cute hippies, nostalgia minus the sleaze, the grime and the sense of truth.
Also while I love Harvey Keitel, he was miscast. His shouty anger seemed curiously ineffectual, he seemed old.

I had more confidence in this show than the writers because they basically summarized everything in the last five minutes as the entire show being a dream and giving a finger to me and everyone else that liked this show. I honestly can't tell if I hate this ending more than Lost or not.

The ending also annoys me because Harvey Keitel develops by becoming less and less crooked over the course of the show while still being sharp around the edges. All the character development (admittedly not much) is thrown out the window by the ending. The ending is so bad that I honestly question if I should recommend this how.

I will say that the US twist ending was far superior to the UK, HOWEVER when the sequel series Ashes to Ashes came out the wrap up exceeded the US version.
If presented with two choices in a TV show a US knock off or a UK original the UK version will almost always win out.
In some ways it exceeded its originator from the UK (which, along with its sequel, Ashes to Ashes, was amazing in its own right  and the final divergent series ender was unique and brilliant, especially as it was cobbled together at the last moment to wrap up the too short lived series.
 I highly recommend this gem to anyone with half a brain. Then do yourself a favour and get the original BBC version, similar but different enough to be a separate treat. Sadly the Ashes to Ashes is only in region 2 DVD but a region DVD player is cheaply had via amazon.
The one down side was that the US version was toned down. Glennis's Hunt was a misogynistic, bullying homophobic who you were a little frightened of if you against him and wanted him in your corner in a scrap. his Hunt was violent for a reason, Kietel was just a capricious bully randomly throwing a sucker punch and letting a few epithets fly, but he seemed to be more like a school boy swearing because teacher wasn't around. Glennister would have told the teacher to sod off. In a fight? Phil would take Harvey down. Which is odd because I doubt Phil's Hunt could take Mr Wolfe.

That being said, His character was too trite for even him to save. Gretchen Mol was the saving grace (if there could be one) of this show. The throwback acting sensibility she displays in Boardwalk Empire does work wonders in this show but It's just not enough.

MAD MEN has been a big success revisiting the 60s,  but  LIFE ON MARS failed after one season while taking us back to the 70s.

What happened ?

What made one so successful and the other fail so quickly ?

Apparently much of America rapidly lost interest in this show (thus the quick cancellation)

I noticed that I warmed up slowly to this series.
In fact, after the first 3-4 episodes I almost stopped watching.

But I kept watching and I am glad I did, I seemed to enjoy the show more as the season progressed.

My gut feel ?

I think if this show had been able to continue on to Season 2,  Season 3, etc....  that I would have liked it more and my ratings would have been higher (4-5 stars)

The show did not start with a BANG from episode 1  ... like the series Walking Dead did ......  but instead LIVING ON MARS started a little slow and gradually built momentum .

The cast was brillant, accurately protraying lifestyles of the 70's which were full of politically incorrect situations typical of the era. Harvey Keitel & Michael Imperlioni make a great law enforcement team and were definitely a bonus in this tv show!

3827689,5,B001XRLWLU,"ABC pulls the plug on another smart show while offering The Bachelor, Dating in the Dark and The Biggest Loser. Other networks give shows more of a chance to find their audiences. ABC would have axed Seinfeld into obscurity the first season. The same with Will & Grace. NBC beat us over the head with that one until people finally gave in and watched it. (I vowed I'd never get hooked on another ABC show, but that was before Modern Family.)

My father lived in NYC in the 70s and seeing LOM brought it back very vividly. Michael Imperioli and Harvey Keitel were fabulous. Gotta love the white shoes. The entire cast, the writing, set design and music were all terrific.

The last episode was criticized because it was so weird and quirky, but that's the very reason I liked it. People who didn't like it probably thought they had it all figured out but the writers did the unexpected which was very fitting for a  series this creative. I also loved all the ""Easter Eggs"" in it. If you go back and watch, there are little hidden references all over the place like in a store window or an offhand comment.

Having Life on Mars on after Lost seemed to make sense, except that Lost required viewers to digest what had just happened so they didn't just jump into something else that required a lot of thought. The kiss of death was yanking LOM and bringing it back in January on a new night. Let's face it, LOM was just too smart for a lazy public who wants passive entertainment. I'm sorry it didn't continue at least another season.",1285027200,3,1530,4.453571428571428

3827691,5,B001XRLWLU,"I never even heard of ""Life on Mars"" until my sister told me about it.  She was so mad that ABC cancelled this show afer just one season and said what a wonderful, original show it was.  I figured I would check it out since all the shows on TV were in summer reruns.  All I can say is ""Wow""!  What a show!  What was wrong with this show?  NOTHING!  This show is based on the show that originated in England and while I never saw the U.K. version, the storylines  in the U.S. version were fresh and original.  Sam Tyler, played by adorable Jason O'Mara, is a detective in NYC in the year 2008 and while on a case gets hit by a car and when he wakes up, he's in the year 1973.  He's wearing 1973 clothes, his car is an old Camaro with an 8-track of David Bowie's Life on Mars.  When he gets up and is in a daze as to what has happened to him, he looks ahead of him and he sees the Twin Towers.  That was so chilling.... He walks the streets of NYC and sees the culture of 1973 - - the clothes, the music, the hairstyles - - and he ends up at the 125 Police Precinct, who were waiting for him as a transfer detective from Hyde.  At the 125, he meets his fellow detectives - - Gene Hunt, fabulously played by veteran actor Harvey Keitel; then there's Ray Carling, the incredibly macho and sexist detective in the group, played flawlessly by Sopranos star, Michael Imperioli; there's young and naive Detective Chris Skelton; and then there's Annie Norris, the token female cop in the precinct, who is regarded very little by her male colleagues, who has 1973 female cop responsibilities (like filing papers, and getting donuts and coffee for the male cops).  Annie was played by Gretchen Mol, who did a wonderful job of showing the strength, vulnerability and charm of her character.  The premise of the show is for Sam to figure out how he got to 1973 - - Is he in a coma? Is he dead?  Was he abducted by aliens and he's on another planet?  Sam doesn't know, but with each episode he tries to figure it all out, and try to figure out how to get back to 2008.  But in the meantime, he does his police work, using 1973 technology, so there are no computers, no cell phones, no DNA.  There are some funny moments throughout the series when Sam mentions something relating to present day, like wanting his ""cell"" and people wonder why he wants a jail cell; or he says a phrase that wasn't heard back in 1973, such as calling his fellows cops ""tools"".  And as each episode progresses, he's starting to enjoy this life in 1973 and the people he works with, especially Annie.  It would've been great to see a couple of more years of this show, because I think they could've done so many more storylines relating to 1973 and it would've been nice to see more character development of Sam, Annie, Gene, Ray and Chris. I think ABC pulled the plug too soon.  They should've given it a chance to find an audience.  Fortunately, for the fans, when ABC cancelled the show, it gave the producers a chance to give it a finale, and I've read mixed reviews about it.  I won't give it away, but I thought it was a great ending to the show, and the U.S. ending is different than the U.K. version.  I can't say enough good things about this show.  You have an ensemble cast of terrific actors who have wonderful chemistry, you have a unique and refreshing storyline, there are songs from 1973 played in each episode (they should come out with a CD soundtrack from this show) and if you were around in 1973, you would see that they captured 1973 to a tee!  I highly recommend this show.  The only disappointing thing about the show is that it ends, when you wish it could go on for a few more years.  Excellent!",1281052800,2,3685,4.2770562770562774

Each episode is a great ride, drawing you further into the mystery of what's really going on and drawing you into each of the great characters and their relationships.  The series is definitely worth watching.

Be forewarned, the last episode utterly fails the audience. It takes all of the characters and relationships that you've become invested in and throws them in the trash.  Then, pours gasoline on them and sets them on fire.  The series was cut short by the network and needed to be wrapped up in the final episode.  Understood.  But the betrayal by the writers for what they provided is inexcusable.

I definitely recommend watching the series.  Just skip the last episode and live with the mystery and the characters you've grown to love.",1269993600,,864,4.738255033557047
3827711,5,B001XRLWLU,"Life on Mars is a perfect example of how network executives will kill off excellent shows, yet let shlock programs keep going and going.

This program is a wonderful piece of television, somewhat following in the wake of the mysterious serial drama genre, such as Lost. But while a bunch of the Lost knockoffs (like Surface and Invasion) were not that notable, LOM really stood out for it's outright quirkiness and devotion to the genre of 1970s cop shows. In fact, LOM is not so much about the 1970s, or even '70s police work. It is really a program that is aspires to emulate '70s police television shows, but still maintaining its own modern sci-fi twist. So in that sense, it is art, imitating art, imitating life.

Beyond the basic storyline of a 2008 detective finding himself in 1973, it is a sheer joy to watch the level of attention and detail that is lavished on the program. It isn't just the obvious things like clothing, cars, and music that gives LOM that 'Police Story'-like feel. It is also the cinematography, camera angles, action sequences, even how the credits are shown at the beginning of each episode - all done in meticulous 70s fashion.

A number of reviews disparaged this US version as being inferior to the British version, as it had a completely different composition and end-story. I haven't seen the Brit version yet, but I think the American version of LOM stand well on it's own. The show made a pretty decent effort to depict the schism between the mindsets of the 1970s and the 2000s, while revealing tantalizing clues about the underlying mythos. The characters were absolutely wonderful. But while Jason O'Mara was a quite convincing lead, the scenes were invariably stolen by Harvey Keitel's and Michael Imperioli's characterizations of gritty NYC cops.

And I don't think I can listen to David Bowie's 'Life on Mars?' again, without thinking about the scene in the first episode, where Tyler realizes where he is, when he turns and sees the World Trade Center towers looming over NYC once again. In fact, that scene really drove home how the NYC of 1973 is truly a bygone era.

There is valid criticism that the final episode was anything from bad to atrocious. I suppose that while this is true, I think if the series had a chance to play out all of it's storylines, the endstory would have been more palatable. But because the network suits decided to pull the plug, the creators scrambled to bring closure. The rushed nature of the series finale clearly reflects this.

As a final note, there is a lyric in the show's signature song, Bowie's 'Life on Mars?':
""Take a look at the lawman beating up the wrong guy. Oh man, wonder if he'll ever know. He is in the best selling show. Is there life on Mars?""

If you were a fan of this 2009 short lived series ... This is a must have!
On the other hand, if you missed the original airing of this series, you owe it to yourself to check it out. Maybe my affection for Life on Mars is due to my having grown up in the 70's so the setting and characters are very appealing while the soundtrack adds to the 70's aura of the show.
The final episode, although rumored to be the original ending the writers had drafted, for me was unsatisfying. The network shorted us on a series that easily could have carried for at least another season.

Very few TV shows have had endings this imaginative. ""The Prisoner"" being one of them. In a broad sense 'Life On Mars' had a few of the ambiguous qualities that made ""The Prisoner"" so great.

Casting Keitel and Imperioli's superb performances along a beautiful Gretchen Mol's presence set the series with a typical all American fantastic acting flavour. Not unlike the UK's version, this series is heavily dependant on a strong lead character, which finds O'Mara at a disadvantage here. On the technical side of things, Photography and Characterization, are flawless. The storyline is at first anemic but grows well if you let your imagination drive you.

3827731,5,B001XRLWLU,"I'm 57 years old. You need to know that because much of the comedy in this show depends upon your recollection of the 1970s. My wife & I watched this short lived series on US tv and I got her the DVD for Christmas. (One of my best gifts ever, as she has watched it about 5 times already). Any who, the show orginated in the UK and was adapted for the US market. I've seen some of the UK series episodes and while well done, don't resonate with me as much because i grew up in the USA. This is a delightful drama/comedy from beginning to end. Poor ole NYPD Detective Sam Tyler gets hit by a car in 2008 & wakes up in 1973. He is being reassigned to another precinct, so when he arrives no one expects he is from the future. Sam doesn't even know what is going on. The plot is very fertile soil for jokes grounded in the juxtaposition of the time differential. (At various times, Sam asks for things which don't yet exist, e.g. DNA sample, Rape Kit, computer, which draws laughs from his 1973 co-workers). My two favorite moments are when he does the ""moon walk"" at a Christmas party and when he ask for a cell phone. Harvey Keitel (who as usual is perfectly cast), his Precinct boss, is incredulous. ""What's a cell phone"", he asks. Sam explains its a mobile telephone that you can carry with you. To which his boss replies, ""Who the hell would want to carry a 'phone around with them all day""? So...you generally get the picture. There are subplots invovling Sam's residual memories, and mysterious messages about how he can return to the future and insightful takes on how police work has changed as well as social norms, such as womens' limited career opportunities in the 70s. Finally of course, the big payoff is the last episode, where everything is explained. It's too good to give away. This series also has a great musical score that will put you right back in the 60s/70s groove. If you remember the 70s and have a shred of humor, you will love this show.

3827757,5,B001XRLWLU,"As someone who found so much of himself on a series of weekend excursions to New York City with my late father that continued until two years before his death on Groundhog Day of 1978, few television shows have ever so profoundly affected me like ""Life On Mars"" did; 1973 was a very pivotal year in my life (three keynote songs: ""Reeling In The Years"", ""Long Train Runnin'"" and ""The Cisco Kid"" - ever since I heard Badfinger's ""Day After Day"" in the background as I happened upon a birdseye view photo of NYC, it and music have been inextricably linked) and I can tell you, remembering one instance where we came across a still body laying somewhere in Lower, the producers replicated it almost EXACTLY.

While I've never been a fan of Harvey Keitel before this show (his portrayal of Cameron Diaz's unbalanced husband in Head Above Water was nothing short of savage) his slightly grimier but better-natured take on Gene Hunt slowly endeared him to me, but the premature yet surreal series finale, given further common reference points, really made it a done deal and emotionally akin to some now-ancient dreams I once had of my father. Other cast members, especially Gretchen Mol as the sweet but principled Annie Norris (replacing the comely but overmatched Rachelle LeFevre of ""What About Brian"" and the ""Twilight"" movies) and star Jason O'Mara lent very strong performances throughout this series, although I remained indifferent toward Michael Imperioli's character Ray Carling as it wasn't far removed from his work on ""The Sopranos"", a subcultural touchstone I flat-out despise for its capricious, rationalized mayhem.....

And while an avowed Anglophile (""Keen Eddie"", another short-lived entry - on FOX, is one of my ALL-time favorite shows) I was not similarly affected by the original British series in quite the same way - liked its ITC-inspired cheekiness, yes (shades of both Roger Moore's ""The Saint"" and Tony Curtis' ""The Persuaders"" - ironically, someone of whom Keitel reminds me a lot) but nobody - including its own residents - will ever mistake Manchester for 'the center of the universe'.....so many reviews of this American reimagining betray a typical English snootiness and there's NO reason why the 2 versions can't be appreciated for their respective charms.....

The musical accompaniment (""Rocket Man"", ""All The Young Dudes"" and, of course, another obvious David Bowie chestnut, ""Life On Mars"", to name a few) is skillfully chosen and fits well within the scripted time spectrum. The revised narrative is effectively woven together with just enough tantalizing threads to hint at the eventual conclusion.

Most of the jokes are grounded in how outdated the attitudes are of the 70s.

The key to the success of the British show was the role of Gene Hunt. Although the hero of the series is Sam Tyler who has travelled back in time, Gene is the section head of the police station he winds up in. In the American show the role is played by Harvey Keitel. In the British show the role is played by Phillip Glenister playing a once in a lifetime role.

Glenister had such charisma and such a comic flair he was declared a British national hero. (Despite being a fictitious character) Two books have been released allegedly written by Glenister's character Hunt. Both have sold well.

Harvey Keitel is clearly a great actor but he was not able to capture the magnetism of Glenister. In Glenister's hands Hunt is a person who frames suspects, beats up innocent people and has attitudes towards women out of the dark ages. However he is a person who has a love hate relationship with Sam Tyler and over time begins to accept the importance of such things as evidence in police investigations and that women can be successful police officers.

The other issue with the American series is that it provides a more simple answer for how the time travel is possible and the underlying reality of what has happened. The British show has a darker vision. Still while not as great as the British show it is a good effort at entertainment and looking at changing social attitudes.",1261353600,17,1763,4.46583850931677

The sets and clothing seem (affectionately) appropriate. A little of Starsky and Hutch, and a little of Northern Exposure. Harvey Keitel is superbly cast. And the historical depiction?... I'm glad to say 'look how far we've come'. Enjoyed every episode.",1261353600,2,392,5.55

It's worth every penny, not only for interesting story, heartwarming character interplay, and humor, but also for the 70's music!!! WOW! Well done!!  Jason O'Mara is really excellent in this along with Harvey Keitel and the very cute and charming Gretchen Mol.

Disks: 4 single-sided disks that are labeled and contain 17 episodes that are around 43 minutes or so.  Good DVD menus with subtitles available (Yeah!).  Languages: English, Spanish, French.  English subtitles also include MUSIC titles and many of the words!  Nice!!!!  Widescreen, but looks fine on usual monitors/tvs.

Extras: Lots of interviews and good insight to the plot, series and characters.  Also, a behind-the-scene look at what actors do and how they do it-- educational.  Highly recommended!

Disk case: well, another crazy design.  Disk 2 is on top of Disk 1.  Disk 3 is on top of Disk 4 so one must really be adept to remove Disk 1 first.  TOUGH center holders with absolutely amazing stubbornness for releasing the disk.  Interesting concept, andI suppose that it is compact, but each time I put the Disk back in the case, I dreaded the next time that I would have to remove it.  Any engineers out there?

3827770,2,B001XRLWLU,"I was a huge fan of the excellent BBC version of Life on Mars, and was looking forward to the ABC series.
I will use the words of Stephen King to illustrate my thoughts:  ""I wish an American network would run the British Life on Mars, one of the greatest limited-run (16 episodes) television series I've ever seen -- it shuts the American version down completely.""

The difference is night and day, the American version was decent, but the BBC version is comparable, and in my opinion superior, to shows like Dexter, Mad Men, and Weeds.
Even at the low price of $15, you'd be better off saving for the original BBC version finally available on DVD on amazon.",1259280000,8,658,4.5210084033613445
3827771,2,B001XRLWLU,"I've watched the first nine episodes (2 discs) of Life on Mars that I borrowed from the public library. (That's a good way to find out whether or not you want to buy a particular item.) Well, let's just say that the show didn't exactly ring my bell. I will give the Sam Tyler character credit for one thing, though. He did NOT get all indignant at the people who were smoking - and inside, at that. Perhaps it would have been different if he had been a member of the LAPD, rather than the NYPD. Or maybe the writers thought that a scene showing Sam Tyler's shocked indignation at smoking would have been such an obvious cliche that they decided to avoid it.

Whatever the finale of the series entails, it apparently has gotten people into such an uproar that I think I'll borrow that disc from the library - just to see the ending.

LATER...
Everything that I've ever read about writing spoke adamantly against this type of ending. The ending of the series was comparable to, and as bad as, a junior high school composition that ends, ""...and the little boy woke up!""

While it was kind of ""cute"" having the President Obama of 2035 being one of the current president's daughters, it couldn't possibly happen for constitutional reasons.  In the year 2035, whoever is elected president had to have been elected in the year 2032, assuming that the elections continue to be held every four years.  President Barack Obama's oldest daughter, Malia, was born in 1998, which means that she would be 34 years old in 2032.  According to the constitution, one of the few qualifications that are explicitly stipulated is that the president (or the presidential candidate) must be at least 35 years old at the time of the election.  This applies to the vice-president, as well.  Therefore, Malia Obama could not even run for the office of president or vice-president in 2032.  She, of course, would be free to do so in the following election, the one in 2036.",1259193600,4,1946,4.6173913043478265

I am not sorry that I bought it, I was curious about the show. I never knew that a remake was made.

Unfortunately, I started it immediately after finishing the second season of ""Mad Men.""  Big mistake on my part.  I found it hugely disappointing and even at times wholly uninteresting.  But, given my extraordinarily high opinion of ""Mad Men"" -- I believe it to be by every measure the finest dramatic series ever produced -- I suspect that I would have found any other series disappointing as well.  I should have waited a couple of weeks before I tried another dramatic series and watched comedies or horror movies until my expectations returned to the normal range.
So, to be fair, I'm giving this review three stars on the ground that I was still so under the influence of ""Mad Men"" that I could not evaluate ""Life on Mars"" on any sort of objective basis.  But, as for the finale that many seem to find unacceptable, I'd have to say that it was about what I'd assumed it would be.

Brilliant agitation to the female-phobic men's club!

We spent 50 hours this summer, watching the USA, UK and ASHES TO ASHES complete. We felt at a ""loss"" when it was all over. No more Gene Hunt? Oh, no!

But then, someone slipped us the original USA pilot, which has Jason Omara (amazingly handsome for a cop) as Sam, but a whole new Annie and Ray. And in a good attempt at typecasting, Gene Hunt is portrayed by Colm Meany (Star Trek NG) and the whole thing is set in Los Angeles.

3827795,2,B001XRLWLU,"Before purchasing, I try to do due diligence, but in this case I screwed up and failed to notice that this series was produced by ABC Studios. My chagrin is compounded by my having been poised to buy the British series of the same name and by my knowing of myriad examples of inferior American remakes of foreign movies and TV series.

My dismay at learning ABC was behind this is due to the fact that, while I buy a lot of DVDs of movies and cable TV series, I do not watch a lot of TV, and except for some of their sports programming, I no longer watch the regular offerings of the broadcast networks - ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox. These networks, constrained by FCC regulations, skittish sponsors, and an audience that appears to prefer a sanitized, Disney-like universe, produce programming that, in my opinion, is far inferior to that of cable channels. (The exceptions - Homicide: Life on the Street comes to mind - are few and far between.)

Bottom line: If you find the CSI franchise enthralling, or consider 24 to be thought-provoking, you may find this series to be ""groundbreaking."" But compared with The Shield, The Sopranos, or The Wire, the ABC version of Life on Mars is a cartoon.",1256428800,8,1187,4.542056074766355

3827797,5,B001XRLWLU,"Now that I've rewatched Life On Mars, there's two things I'm certain of: (1) There were clues from the very first episode as to the ending, as well as other plot points throughout the season (which makes me love the show even more); and, (2) that I prefer this version to the British Version.  I know a bunch of people are going to attack me for this as the British is the original version, and this version borrowed a number of the early episodes from the British Show, but it won't change my mind.  The trouble I always had with the British Version was that it took itself too seriously.  This is a story that is based on a concept which is a little silly, and plays off the differences between being a person and police officer in the present time and the 70s.  As such, I prefer the lighter tone of the American version, which doesn't take itself too seriously, but still maintains enough of a level of seriousness not to be limited to a comedy.

Beyond the debate over which version exists, this show stands on its own.  The lead is very good in this show, likeable, and gets a little bit of a confused puppy look whenever something happens that shouldn't (which happens all the time).  The rest of the cast is great, playing out the roles of the stereotypes of the time, be it the naive rookie, the hardened chief, the sexist detective, or the pre-feminist feminist.  While I'm sad the show only was on for a season, I'm glad it had one excellent season, where the mystery at least was allowed to be resolved.  And who knows, maybe in time, they'll try and remake the Life on Mars Spin-off, ashes to ashes..

3827799,5,B001XRLWLU,"""Life on Mars"" made its debut in the US on October 2008 and was completed in April 2009.  The series is loosely based on the BAFTA-award winning series shown on BBC back in 2006-2007.

The series revolves around a NYC homicide detective named Sam Tyler (Jason O'Mara, ""Grey's Anatomy"", ""Men In Trees"" and ""In Justice"") who is engaged to Detective Maya Daniels (Lisa Bonet, ""The Cosby Show"", ""A Different World"").  Both are planning to marry but first, they are on the pursuit of a man who is wanted for killing several women by torturing them within the 30 hours they are kidnapped and then killed.

Unfortunately, due to circumstance, the person wanted is released but May suspects that he still is the person they are looking for and tails him.  It is realized later that the man they had in custody was the correct person (who has a twin brother) and when Sam goes to find Maya, all he finds is her shirt which has blood all over it.

This leads Sam to pursuing the perpetrator but while going back to his car to get his radio, he is accidentally run over.  Next thing you know, Sam wakes up but he is in the wrong time period, waking up in 1973.  During this time, he's a police detective who has transferred to New York's 125th Detective Squad as a Detective Second Grade.  Before computers and modern technology, things are handled much differently during this time and it freaks Sam out, not knowing if he's dead or alive, if he's dreaming or going mad.  What is known is that cases that he is handling now, has to relate to his work in 2008 but most of all, things that deal personally with his life.

But it's about Sam getting used to 1973 and his surroundings.  For Sam, being a part of the politically correct and modern technology-based era, preservation of suspects rights and forensic evidence is a priority.  Despite everyone are quite OK with how business is done at the 1-2-5, Sam believes in going by the book and being a respectable police officer and thus putting him at odds with the other detectives while winning the respect of the only person who will listen to him, Annie Norris.

Joining Sam at the 1-2-5 squad in 1973 are:

Lt. Gene Hunt (Harvey Keitel, ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Bugsy"", ""Reservoir Dogs"") - The Commander of the 125th Detective Squad.  Brash, works with mobsters to get information, beats up the people they capture to get a confession and literally a corrupt cop but is dedicated to protecting the city.  He is often at odds with Sam's by-the-book attitude and ends up beating Sam up (or getting into fights with him).

Detective Ray Carling (Michael Imperioli, ""Law & Order"", ""The Sopranos"") - A blunt detective who despises Sam for taking the position he wanted.  Short-tempered and arrogant.

Annie Norris (Gretchen Mol, ""3:10 to Yuma"", ""Girls Club"", ""The Thirteenth Floor"") - A policewoman who has an undergraduate in psychology and a member of the Police Women's Bureau.  Since 1973 was during a time that female's weren't treated in the same capacity as men, she hopes that one day that female police officers will be as equals to men and that she will be a detective one day.  Often treated as someone with a lower status by the male detectives at 1-2-5, she listens to Sam (who babbles about being from the future) but respects him for having an open-mind, even though she doesn't quite believe his story.

Detective Chris Skelton (Jonathan Murphy, ""October Road"", ""Wild Fire"") - The young detective trying to learn the ropes around the office.

Throughout the series, Sam wonders if he is ever going to back to his time period, especially as he gradually starts to see some changes in the 1973 time line and trying to figure out if what is happening is real or unreal.  He realizes certain cases relate to his cases that he handled back in his time period.  But also throwing him for the loop is being around the time his mother was raising his younger version of himself and seeing his father and realizing more about his parents and their life back in 1974.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

While the first episode and flashbacks feature natural colors, it's when we see the 1973 scenes, a filter is used and the colors of the series become more amber with a yellow/orange/brown tinge and is purposely made to look different from the present-time scenes.  But by no means does the colors seem distracting.

Audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  For the most part, the series is front and center channel driven with the dialogue and 70's music coming in nice and clear. Dialogue is understandable and there are sounds that utilize the surround channels.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

For the most part, ""Life on Mars"" is a very entertaining, suspenseful and cool drama series.

""Life on Mars"" (the US version) definitely differs from its BBC counterpart in some ways.  For the US version, the primary similarity is that Sam Tyler uses his 21st Century investigation skills in handling homicide cases and is a bit more politically correct than his 1-2-5 counterparts and his boss Gene Hunt is a crooked cop (although respectful to protecting the people of his city).

But part of the problem was that ""Life on Mars"" was a series envisioned to lasting more than one season.  In fact, despite the series being critically acclaimed at the beginning, the series unfortunately had lower viewership.  It didn't help that ""Lost"", it's lead-in show was also battling with the loss of viewership as well.  So, major differences is that the character of Annie Hunt is portrayed much differently in the BBC version than the US.  Most importantly, the way the series ends for the BBC and US version differ greatly.  And part of the reason of how the season ended is due to the fact that the creators had such a short time of deciding how the series would end.

In fact, fans of the series will probably enjoy the audio commentary for the final episode as we learn what the original finale was supposed to be but also the reason why they made the final minutes of the final episode as is.  But its also important to note that like the BBC version, the final second before the credits run in that final episode carries that same ambiguous feeling that perhaps things are not as they should be.

With that being said, the series finale had an ending that is surely going to either be a love or hate moment for viewers.  I can't really spoil anything but needless to say, even the creators say in the commentary that the response was either love or hate, nothing in between.

As for the series, I felt the writing was well done and the main talent such as Jason O'Mara, Gretchen Mol, Harvey Keitel, Michael Imperioli and Jonathan Murphy were a solid group.  O'Mara and Mol have great chemistry, Keitel is always a talented actor in playing the tough man role and Imperioli did a great job of playing the disgruntled detective.  Each of the talent did well in their roles and even for the short role of actress Lisa Bonet, it was great to see her again on television.

The costume design is top notch.  The hairstyles, the clothing... I was quite surprised because there are a lot of extras featured in this series.  Since the shows take place in New York and Sam is wandering throughout the city, there are a lot of people in 70's outfits.  And it's not just the clothing but also the vehicles and the CG (as the Twin Towers are featured) to make the setting seem realistic.

Also, another positive that I enjoyed about the series is the soundtrack used for each episode. ""Life on Mars"" would feature popular, classic rock or classic 70's music and for those who enjoy 70's music, would probably get a kick out of episodes where there is a police chase and then Mott the Hoople would be playing in the background.

As for the DVD, we get four audio commentary tracks and a good number of special features.  A good number of content and for the most part, ""Life on Mars - The Complete Series"" is a solid DVD release.

Overall, ""Life on Mars"" was a series that was just so fun and enjoyable but it's so unfortunate that the series was canceled.  There was great potential in this series and the finale managed to end the series in an interesting note but it would have been interesting to see how the writers would have carried things off if they had that second season, more time and a few more episodes.

Nevertheless, I felt that this was one of the more entertaining drama series on television and for those curious about the series or missed the series the first time around, ""Life on Mars - The Complete Series"" is definitely recommended!",1254355200,24,12700,4.5283765948086225
3827800,4,B001XRLWLU,"A long life wasn't in the cards for ""Life on Mars"". Maybe there was a lack of oxygen that made the audience out there light headed and miss this unique show. Yes, it's a remake of a British TV series (which is also terrific)but it's not just the material (think of all those plays that are revived and done by different actors, directors and with different settings over the years)it's the performance of the material that matters. ""Life on Mars"" delivered Americanizing the original BBC TV series. The plots are roughly the same and the premise is EXACTLY the same. Detective Sam Tyler (Jason O'Mara) while hunting for a killer in 2008 that has kidnapped his partner gets hit by a car and wakes up in 1973. He has the same name, is still a detective but has been ""reassigned"" to the 125th Precint. His boss Gene (Harvey Keitel)pays lip service to Miranda and gets the job done. He knows the job that sometimes he has affiliations with seedy underworld characters (Robert Klein)and sometimes that means he roughs up the suspect but to him its all for the greater good. Forenics is primative at best but Tyler's unique mind means that he sees connections that aren't there allowing him to gain the grudging respect of his peers. Sam knows that he has to get back and he has to figure out what connection will take him back. He believes he's either 1) in a coma 2) in an alternate universe or 3)? but either way the challenge is for him to survive in this world as alien as the deserted landscape of the red planet.

I'm surprised we don't have a Blu-ray of this. While the show looks quite good it was shot in high definition and would clearly benefit from a high def transfer. The show features a couple of commentary tracks one of which features executive producer Josh Applebaum discussing how they adapted the series for the U.S. audience and their take on how the show should develop, why they made the changes they did, etc.

We also get a number of behind-the-scenes featurettes with the best being a tour of the sets by Jason O'Mara and 70's icon actor Lee Majors (""The Six Million Dollar Man""). The extras here are of a higher calibar when compared to those on the Acorn Media release of the original BBC series.

Both the original BBC series and the U.S. series are terrific. Americans will be able to better relate to American Sam vs. British Sam because of the cultural touchstones but you can't go wrong with either one. Oh, and the conclusion of this series compared to the original British one is quite a bit different so be prepared for an interesting life on Mars.",1254355200,8,2580,4.544086021505376

3827802,4,B001XRLWLU,"Sam Tyler (Jason O'Mara) is a cop living in 2008.  He's actually a very successful New York City Detective.  While working on one particularly tough case, Sam is hit by a car and wakes up to find himself in 1973.  He finds that he has just been transferred to a precinct in New York and finds himself working on a case that just might matter to his 2008 self.

But Sam continues to find himself trapped in 1973.  His modern, politically correct ways are out of step with his new co-workers, especially in their attitude of Annie (Gretchen Mol), the lone female who wishes to be recognized as a real detective.  He finds his more modern methods occasionally help out with cases.  Then there are the cases that bring him into contact with his father, mother, and himself as a boy.

All the while, Sam searches for a way to return home.  Will the weird clues he gets help?  Or is he stuck in 1973 for the rest of his life?

I've never seen the BBC original version, but I got caught up in the hype that surrounded this show when it premiered last fall.  It took me a few episodes to fully get hooked, but when I did, I didn't want to miss an episode.  These characters all grew on you.  This included not only the two I mentioned, but Sam's fellow detectives Ray (Michael Imperioli) and Chris (Jonathan Murphy) and their lieutenant Gene Hunt (Harvey Keitel).  The differences in methods and the storylines brought in from that time period were fascinating.  And I kept trying to figure out what was happening to Sam.

Of course, that also provides the biggest conflict over the show.  When ABC canceled the show, they allowed the producers to make one last episode to wrap everything up.  Fans seem to be pretty evenly divided over the ending.  Initially, I thought it was too far out in left field, but the more I have thought about it, the more I feel it does make sense.  There were clues given through the show that actually make it work.

Even if you don't buy the ending, you can still enjoy the period piece, drama, and comedy of the show.  There are sixteen solid episodes before you get to the questionable finale.

This show isn't for everyone (which is why the ratings tanked and it crashed).  But if you want some 70's nostalgia, give it a chance.",1254182400,8,2256,4.443902439024391

I look forward to viewing it again, having the opportunity to catch little clues which may require multiple viewings to appreciate.

As for reviewing the product, the case is a little flimsy. Kind of like thin, recycled plastic. All four discs fit into the single-disc sized case, so it doesn't take up much space in your DVD storage area.

It is presented in widescreen which fills the entire screen. I prefer that over older square TV format, which if stretched to fill widescreen causes short, fat people effect. Cannon, anybody? A 70s detective-show reference. After viewing the first episode again, I noticed Cannon (as well as Kojak) on the TV in Sam's apartment.

There are bloopers on the special features - not many and mostly laughing, no big whoop - and a trip back to 1973 with Lee Majors.
Also on the special features is a short segment on a day in the filming of Life On Mars featuring O'Mara and stunt people. Interesting enough.

If you liked the series, the DVD set is complete at only $25.99 plus free shipping option.

However, what I failed to mention is that this DVD doesn't include (as far as I can see) the original unshown pilot episode which is an interesting thing in itself.  I would gladly pay my $30 for that alone.  It still had Jason O'Mara as Sam Tyler, but none of the other actors in the eventual aired series appeared.  Gene Hunt was played very ably by Colm Meaney (of Star Trek fame) but it failed to deliver and they completely rewrote the pilot, sacked everyone (except O'Mara) and started over.

It's an interesting watch if you can find it though, as is this whole series.  Just a shame about the ending which entirely ruins the whole previous 16/17 hours of the show.",1253836800,2,765,4.390070921985815

The writing on this show was some of the best I have seen in years.  Reminded me of the first year of West Wing.

Why is it the networks think it's OK to put on ""Wipeout"" with all its 'balls' humor, and why we can watch people eating bugs in various stages of decay (the bugs, not the people) but a well thought-out drama gets whacked after a handful of episodes?

It was smart, clever and well written from start to finish. Well, almost. The last 10 minutes of the finale did feel rushed. I liked the premise of the end, and I read somewhere that it ended the way they had intended it to.

The rest of the story was that it was canceled after 10 or 12 episodes, but ABC eased the pain a bit by allowing the final episodes to run and letting writers to put together a (hastily produced) series finale rather than let us live forever on a typical season-ending cliffhanger. Kudos for that ABC, but that still doesn't make up for killing the show entirely.

As a side commentary, I think that this show was yet another one done in by the TV industry's inability to figure out what to do with DVR's. Since those ratings don't count because they are difficult to quantify, they are never considered when networks make those decisions to cancel or renew a show.

It was a time when we could hang out with friends outside until midnight playing stickball, and not have to lock the doors to our houses until we went in for the night. All these wonderful memories came back to me while watching LOM. Not only have I pre-ordered the DVD, I have bought some of the songs from iTunes.

All of the actors did an amazing job. I couldn't even single one of them out, though I must say that I have been noticing Gretchen Mol a lot and think her time is due. She was also great in The Thirteenth Floor. I can't wait to see what she does next.

3827834,5,B001XRLWLU,"I loved this show and watched it faithfully on ABC!
The cast was one of the best ensembles of actors that I
have seen in a long time!--All played their roles well.
Yes, it was kinda out there, a sci-fi-sitcom & drama
all rolled into one, but that's what made it so unique.
An NYC police detective is on the trail of a serial killer
when he is struck by a car, knocked unconscious, and wakes up
in 1973!--The whole premise is that slowly, through clues and events,
and surreal visits from gadget-like toys from his past, he tries to find his
way back home to 2008. He also uncovers things about his parents, through adult eyes,
that he had no clue of as a child. He also sees & befriends himself as a 9 yr old child.
It kind of took me back to the late 60's and early 70's,
when the concepts of TV shows were way out there, yet the public
was willing to take the journey with them!
(i.e. Gilligan's Island, Beverly Hillbillies, Bewitched, etc.)
Well, in this cynical & jaded day and time, not everybody can get that
free of mind to allow themselves to be torn away from their own self-importance,
over-analyzation and inability to tear themselves away from their reality long
enough to appreciate a truly great & original show like this!--Nah, they want
mindless ""reality shows""!! Which have absolutely nothing to do with reality at all!
Not mention short attention span types that won't go along for 6 to 8 weeks for a plot
to unfurl. Even though there was a small devoted following who loved this show,
apparently it was not enough to persuade ABC to renew it and was canned.
My only point of contention was ""What the hell was the final episode about?""

The design:  EVERYTHING is right about the period set and costume design in this series.

The cast:  This is what really sold me on the series.  I would pay to see Havey Keitel read the phone book; ditto Michael Imperioli.  I am glad that this reimagining of the original did not try to exactly copy the Sam Tyler - Gene Hunt relationship from the original.  O'Mara and Keitel play it as more ""father-son"" than warring young studs. Plaudits for a bit of originality.  I certainly hope we see more of Gretchen Mol in the future.  Also, a hearty handshake to the individual who cast the great Dean Winters as Sam's slimey dad.  Winters, who has seemly been in everything on TV over the last few years (""30 Rock"", ""Oz"", ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"", ""Rescue Me"", etc.) MAKES the episodes in which he appears and deserves to be a star.

But I have pre-ordered my copy of the series,and will get to see the whole thing over and over again.)Most of the time,I had to record them and watch them at a later date and time-due to my job. But always looked SO forward to doing so!!! Great scripts,great actors,great music-and great show!!!! Just wish that the monkey was smarter,cause the show would still be on-and we wouldn't all be missing it like we are..........Wish that ABC would reconsider and bring it back,somehow...........",1241049600,17,1077,5.056179775280899

3827870,5,B001XRLWLU,"Loved this show. Stupid cancellation. The network execs are probably too young to remember the 70's...and didn't ""get"" the show. Too bad for us fans, I guess.",1240704000,6,158,4.888888888888889
3827871,5,B001XRLWLU,"My wife and I watched this show religiously, even after seeing the BBC versions of LoM and AtA. This show could be appreciated as merely an excellent 70s cop drama, but I enjoy the sci-fi arc as well. The only black mark on this show is the ending, the last 10 minutes of the last epiosde. The ending rendered the series meaningless; nevertheless, I'll buy this series when it is released.",1240531200,2,389,4.492957746478873

3827873,5,B001XRLWLU,"I, like many others it would appear, was hooked on the series from the first episode and found myself planning my calendar around the next one. I rewatched episodes during the ""Christmas Break"" on ABC's website, and bemoaned the announcement of the ""Series Finale"". Harvey Keitel is a long time favorite actor of mine, and I cheered and cried with the last shot of the show, one small step for man, one giant leap for white bucks. Mike Imperioli was a hoot, but he reminded me too much of a dorm-mate I had in college back in '67. And face it, Gretchen Mol is a DOLL. The technical aspects were spot on for '73 and the music was ALWAYS SUPERB. I managed to record one or two episodes on the old VHS machine and that will have to tide me over until 29 September. I agree that at least with the DVD of the entire season, it will give me the chance to watch something innovative and intelligent besides the lame same old that the networks peddle to the mediocre middle. Well done, Major Tom!",1239926400,,988,4.345945945945946
3827874,5,B001XRLWLU,"Firefly , Deadwood , Rome , probably Life , and Life on Mars - it never fails , once I start to really like a show it's most likely to be gone soon ! At least they knew they were ending and didn't go out in an unresolved cliff hanger like NBC did with Las Vegas . Hopefully the dvd boxed set will have an alternate ending , since I'm definately buying it having missed the first 4 or 5 eps . The music is so old it shouldn't be a problem making it to the dvd , unlike season one of Life which NBC (AGAIN!) cheaped out on giving a crappy studio created soundtrack in place of it's great music by original artists ! Gritty realistic tv director/series creator David Milch (Deadwood, NYPD Blue,Hill Street Blues ) was working on a 1970s cop drama for HBO which was scrapped , I wonder if the cancellation of LOM had anything to do with it ? Too bad - if LOM proved anything , it would've been great !",1239926400,2,897,4.044943820224719
3827875,5,B001XRLWLU,Couldn't believe it when I saw they were wrapping it up after only one year. The music was great. I hope they create a sound track. Looking forward to the DVD.,1239926400,2,159,4.161290322580645
3827876,5,B001XRLWLU,"I loved LOM- intelligent, thought-provoking with a great cast.  I am sad to see it end.

However, I am very happy that they wrapped it up in a dignified way.  So many shows I get caught up in are unceremoniously dumped by the network in the middle of a plot line with total disregard for the audience.  Eg. My Own Worst Enemy (I'm still stewing over that one).",1239408000,,360,4.25
3827897,5,B001XRLWLU,"When the premise for this show was first introduced I was very excited and intrigued.  Afterall, I grew up in the 70's and have a very deep fondness for the music and that period of time.  1973 was a ""special"" year to me for personal reasons, and so the fact that Sam Tyler was transported back to that year made watching the show even more sentimental and special.  Add to it the wonderful characters, acting,  stories, music and commitment to the look and feel of the early 70's and this show was a winner hands down.  Yes, it still had to get its wings and find its way.  There was a bit of stumbling along ambiguity-wise (How much of it was about Sam trying to find his way back home vs. adjusting to his new life in 1973 vs. tackling yet another intriguing case that may have had a connection with why he was there in the first place?)  Perhaps it was ALL of these things..but in the end, it didn't matter.  What mattered was that with each episode the show proved it had heart.  It touched you on a level most shows don't dare do today.  In an age where we are inundated with reality tv drivel, humorless sitcoms and yet another forensic-themed crime drama, here was a show that gave us back-to-basics drama, not unlke the actual 70's shows of the time (like one of my favorites, ""Starsky & Hutch"").  That it takes place ""now"" in 2008/9 made it hip and fun to watch, imo.  It respected the 70's and what they represented without being TOO serious.  I could laugh in recognition and delight over the 70's references and even learn a thing or two I was too young to even know about at the time.

That the series ended on such a bad note, is the only major flaw I see.  The ending was a huge disappointment and insult, imo..but other than that, if you ""forget"" the last five minutes of the finale, you'll see just how much potential this series had.  I only wish the network had seen fit to give this show a chance so that we could have delighted in many more years of this promsing series.  At least with this DVD release we'll have a bittersweet reminder of how ""Life on Mars"" was a life cut way too short.",1239321600,2,2111,4.290404040404041
3827898,5,B001XRLWLU,"The main reason I started watching LoM was because of Harvey Keitel. I was hooked from the start. Harvey, Jason O'Mara, Michael Imperioli & Gretchen Mol are all great. This was a story that I wanted, no, HAD to follow. Then you had the music which took me back to some crazy happy times. I found myself smiling, I mean a big 'have a nice day' happy face smile.
It was very dissapointing to find out that it was cancelled. At least they gave us a ending (would have preferred another season). I have never bought a tv series on dvd but had to have this. I will watch it again.",1239235200,4,575,4.1891891891891895
3827899,5,B001XRLWLU,"The producers and writers of LoM did an outstanding job in creating an addictive feeling of heart within all of the actors and the humor was irresistible. After you watch this show, just like Sam, you won't want to leave life in 1973.",1239235200,3,234,4.465116279069767
3827900,5,B001XRLWLU,Amazing show. Like many others the ending was dissapointing. I am sad the show got cancelled. The cast is fantastic and the story is worth seeing. There are a good amount of question marks left to ponder after all is said in done.,1239148800,2,230,4.372093023255814
3827901,5,B001XRLWLU,"This was the first non-sitcom series I picked-up from the very beginning since ER, which was great in it's early years.

Unlike too many series which start off strong and then unravel over time due to too many seasons and too little creativity, ""Life On Mars"" certainly didn't fall into that category.  It burst upon the U.S. television scene like a supernova and, unfortunately, lasted about as long.

However, with the DVD set due out in less than six months, LOM's light will remain strong and hot.

I am hopeful that the 'special features' will bring even more to its small, but loyal, fanbase:  the original pilot episode (with a different cast except for Jason O'Mara); interviews with cast, crew, writers and producers (perhaps even their vision as to what a Season Two would've covered); scenes which didn't make it on air, including the original ending scenes to the 17th episode (written as a season-ending cliffhanger, rather than the series-ending episode it turned out to be).

This is a cop show with a sci-fi twist.  It has great humor, mystery, and romance.  It has something for everyone.  Women really like Jason O'Mara.  Men really like Gretchen Mol and the cars from 1973.  And, the music!!!  The show was just put together incredibly well and has the perfect soundtrack for each episode.  From the top notch cast, to the writing, to the music, to the 1973 set, it's exceptional.  Don't miss the DVD!",1239148800,2,605,4.36936936936937

Did anyone besides me notice how much Michael Imperioli's Ray looked like Chuck Negron of Three Dog Night? Harvey Keitel nailed his boss man role;
Jason O Mara played the confused, homesick, great cop very well. I loved the wardrobe, the music ( although there were great tunes from '73 that was left out i.e. Three Dog Night, The Rascals, The Beatles,) My son was born in 1973 as well, and this show gave him a chance to see how life was back in the day...SO happy to know it will be out for my birthday!!",1239148800,,835,4.225

8347699,5,B001XRLWLU,"The series starts out with Detective Sam Tyler (Jason O'Mara) being hit by a car in 2008 and wakes up in 1973.

The series was inspired by the UK version but has its own twists and turns.
As Detective Sam Tyler tries to make since of the situation, he gets a chance to rectify many wrongs and understand what he did not as a child in that time. His primary goal is to go back to 2008.

Clues abound throughout the series; some of the clues are strait forward and others are cryptic. There are just enough clues to keep you going but not spoil the ending that may not be real its self.

The ending comes too soon and is rushed to wrap up and not leave you hanging on a program that never has an end. The irony is that the end allows you to speculate on three different reality dates or none at all.
