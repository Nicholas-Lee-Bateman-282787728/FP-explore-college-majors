5711760,5,B00CBJ53HS,"New York Five Points history is incredible - this series brings some serious production values making Five Points squalor, crime and characters come vividly to life. And you'll be wanting to take most of them down to the East River with a bar of lye soap and a rough rag...",1372636800,,273,4.48
5711761,4,B00CBJ53HS,"Good historical drama set during the backdrop of the American Civil War, all actors due a superb job.
The plots are interesting and often take many episodes to unfold, so it has more of an epic feel to it than a ""solved case"" every episode kinda thing.
Dont care for the Brothel scenes too much nor the woman working in them, don't care much for their character development either.  Im not a fan of prostitution or the glorification of those who work within it. But that aside....
Other than that its a four star show. Police Drama, Action, Unique Characters provide color to the story.

Enjoy",1372636800,,593,4.584905660377358
5711762,5,B00CBJ53HS,"I challenge you to just watch the pilot of this show and will be hooked! It is set in New York during the Civil War era. ""Copper"" is what they called the local police (you know, like ""cops"" these days). The lead actor is very sexy for the ladies out there! He's a tortured soul due to sad circumstances upon his return from the war. For the men, there is lots of action, blood & gore as murders abound in Five Points! For the science minded folks, there is lots of early cutting edge forensics from the equally good-looking supporting male actor who happens to be black. I only mention this due to the period in history we are talking about. He was a pioneer in the field of forensics! He also has a beautiful wife who has tortured memories of her family members being murdered just because they were slaves. For those history buffs out there, I think you will like the authenticity and continuity of the costumes and settings. This Wilke's brothers make their appearance in Season 1 and we all know where this is going. Oh, yeah, and speaking of action, remember the gas that is so dangerous it catches fire without a flame just by being exposed to oxygen? Discovered in 1772? Yep! That's in there also!

Watch the pilot and you will know if it's for you (if you have Netflix, you can watch Season One for free)!

5711764,5,B00CBJ53HS,"I watched Season 1, and couldn't get enough of it. When I found out, there was a Season 2, I was thrilled. It's one of the best series I have seen in quite a while.",1372291200,6,164,3.7142857142857144
5711765,5,B00CBJ53HS,"This series is great on so many levels...depends if you want to rate based on the handsome men of Copper, the excellent costuming of the characters or just the backstory of each of these characters & how they came to be who they are in Five Points.",1372291200,6,248,4.297872340425532
5711766,5,B00CBJ53HS,"There are so many directions this can go, of course we have John Wilkes Booth in the action, and we know where that's going to lead.  Season 1 was great.  I hope I don't have to pay to see season 2, I can't afford to pay when there are so many old movies that are good.",1371945600,,269,3.7857142857142856
5711767,5,B00CBJ53HS,"I thought ""Copper"" was one of those great shows that didn't grab all of the demographics and numbers to satisfy the networks - in other words, a great show that bites the dust to bean counters.  BUT, it's BACK!!!!  Moody, depressed, up and down in quality episodes, overall an excellent representation of the grit and grime of its historical period with a well-played, darkly principled protagonist.  I am looking forward to some great drama in the new season of Copper.",1370822400,33,470,4.85

5711774,1,B00CBJ53HS,"Haven't watched the series, although it looks really good - was on my wish list for a while, and was going to purchase both seasons as the prices are really excellent right now.  After reading reviews that the series ends on a cliff hanger without resolution, definitely won't purchase.  Will never purchase any series that screws loyal viewers like this again - been burned too many times after investing my time and money only to be left hanging.",1449964800,2,448,4.730769230769231

5711779,5,B00CBJ53HS,"Viewer beware! The show is very well written, directed and acted. It will suck you in and have you caring about the characters.

That's why the final episode was infuriating. They present a gruesome mystery that should have been a cliff-hanger for season three but, unless BBC revives the show, will never be solved. Grrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!",1436918400,2,335,5.090909090909091
5711780,4,B00CBJ53HS,"An entertaining series from BBC America that didn't stick around, this show is about the Five Corners borough of New York in the period right after the Civil War.  The stories were a little too dramatic, but the portrayal of life in New York City around the time of Tammany Hall and cronyism captured my attention and was worth spending money to watch.",1436745600,,352,4.587301587301587
5711781,5,B00CBJ53HS,"Well acted with remarkable characters that you will love, or hate, with equal measure.  The stark realism slaps you right in the face and seldom lets up.  My only caveat that there is no season 3 and you are left hanging with no closure to the story line.  Secondly while this series has a NR stamp it should, have been rated R, or have the very least PG-13.  Not so much for the implied sex scene's, which were handled delicately, but for the graphic violence.  It's not for kids!
There is, or was, talk of a movie to complete the story line but like a lot of ""maybe's"" we hear about I doubt that it will happen.",1436227200,,613,4.205128205128205

5711784,3,B00CBJ53HS,Although the overall concept is engaging and enjoyable the writers seem to have run out of ideas and fell back on a trite conspiracy theme to continue the storyline.  If they had merely used old NYPD case histories from the period the series would continue to have been engaging.  The witters forgot that 1860s NYC was the real star of the show.  Any storyline that highlighted that rather than an overused plot gimmick would have been preferable.,1433721600,,447,4.779220779220779

5711786,5,B00CBJ53HS,great series!,1430956800,,13,6.0
5711787,5,B00CBJ53HS,"I'll join the positive reviews of those who loved the series, even though I hate the fact that we're stuck with a cliffhanger that will never be resolved because BBC America gave the people actually writing and making the series no warning whatsoever about its cancellation. The third season had already been planned out with regard to its plot, and that's what the ending of season 2 led up to.
That being said, I loved season 2. I felt it had all the strengths of season 1 when it came to intelligence, gritty realism and great characters and actors, but with a more coherent plot and with less of a character who really got on my nerves (the kid Annie). I don't want to give too much away about the plot, so I will just say that while it goes on telling the private stories of the characters, it now also delves more deeply into the dealings of the powerful businessmen of the city and just how ruthless they are.
Reading some of the negative reviews, my impression is that some of those reviewers didn't realise just how complex and detailled (and great) the plot was. In hindsight, lots of small details that didn't seem that significant or weren't explained at first suddenly made (sometimes shocking) sense. To me, it really paid of to watch it on Blu ray within a few days so that everything eas fresh in my mind. I'll watch both seasons again right away since I'll certainly understand even more details and connections.
This was a really intelligent series that made demands on its viewers. I hate that it was cut off mid-story, but would nevertheless recommend it to people who love a good plot and interesting, realistic characters, but who can handle the fact that there are no 100% good (or even bad) characters and that there's a lot of violence and some sex. It might appeal to you if you liked Deadwood, but series like Justified or even Battlestar Galactica also come to mind for intelligence and gritty storytelling. I just wish the series had been given more seasons - what a waste of talent to cut it off after only two.",1430438400,2,2041,4.548913043478261

Tom Weston-Jones anchors a phenomenal cast who provide a gripping account of the US Civil War period, especially how it pertains to the residents of NYC's ""Five Points"" area. I sometimes think about the movies, Gangs of New York and Lincoln. Interestingly enough, they both feature the best actor on the planet, Daniel Day-Lewis.

While Tom Weston-Jones did a GREAT job as Irish detective Kevin Corcoran in the series, I found really drawn to the complexity of a few of his other co-actors, especially Ato Essandoh (Dr. Matthew Freeman) and Franka Potente (Eva Heissen).

Having said that the Great Sitting Bull ..chief of the Lakota said their cites are piles of refuse and garbage. So I suppose it could be pretty close! But a little blue sky once in a while,,a little breath of fresh air on occasion maybe? Also the doctors role doesn't turn me on.. Why do they have to think that they need CGI stuff in everything!

Each episode left me wanting to watch the next one.  Sadly, in my humble opinion, its inability to attract an audience is much less a reflection on this outstanding series than it is a pointed indication of how shallow and lacking in depth this nation has become.  If it isn't sugar coated, spoon fed and rubber stamped by the liberal elite in this country, most gutty, realistic series with gritty graphic reality, stand little chance of finding an audience.  It is also, a sad reflection of how we are over protected from ourselves and taught that anything violent is bad.

So much so I find myself thinking how horrible everything must have smelled back then.  Everyone and everything looks grimely, which it most likely was. The focus of the show is how the Irish policeman (or copper) became a cliche. The acting is good and the cast mostly attractive (despite the grime). Unfortunately none of the main characters are particularly likeable (with the exception of the good doctor's wife, who lightens up considerly in season 2). And since the writing isn't very compelling; there's no need see what happens next.

All different elements come together, race relations of the time, often echoed today...the class struggle of the area and politics of the City all come alive in this drama. The main character has to struggle with his own moral code as well as the high stress influences of the time period. I liked this series very much from both an entertainment value and a historical look into what the world was like to characters during that era.

It's action packed, a little gory for American tastes (not sure why that would be, either???) and a wonderful time period in New York City. Kevin, is always struggling to do the right thing in a really bad situation. He does NOT have the penetrating morals and ethics of Inspector Reid, see ""Ripper Street"", but he is very close.

He is a family man with a dead child, and a wife on the brink of madness, much like Inspector Reid. However, the stories are very different. The struggles are similar, but not the same.

We also learn much more about Lincoln assassin John Wilkes Booth, Tammany Hall corruption, and various race riots. The actual stories, whether standalone or part of various story arcs, are gripping.

5712144,4,B00CBJ53HS,It has a little history in it that I did not know about and it was interesting.  I gave that rating because they can do away with those naked sex scenes. I could not watch with my family or friends.  Too much nakedness.,1395705600,,219,4.069767441860465

Like my other review the accents are correct unlike Deadwood but it is not shot as well.  In this season more people get stabbed, rapped, killed, peed on, bit by rats, betrayed.  Welcome to Wild West NYC.  This show holds nothing back and the cast has really good chemistry.  As an American it is refreshing to see a show about America with correct accents because it seldom happens.  On a side note I am a Graphic designer and the Graphic Design in this show is also amazing.  The sets, the labeling and even the intro sequence is amazing.  I know it is a small point but to me it is poetry.  Strangely the box design is kinda boring. In any case, this is a great show.  I'm loving it.",1392854400,,822,4.2727272727272725

Likeable main characters and interesting story line. After watching the first season we could not wait for 2....every bit as good. UNFORTUNATELY BBC has decided not to continue. They are contemplating a movie; WHY. Season 3 would start with much unanswered and at a very turbulent time in US history.
Never saw any of these on A&E or BBC but waited to buy complete as a season, probable reason for cancellation but if they want more support for programs then advertise and make everyone more aware of what and when and where showing.",1389484800,,662,4.666666666666667

5712213,4,B00CBJ53HS,"Its really a pity that this season ended so abruptly.

It ends with the promise of more story--but unfortunately the show was cancelled, leaving the viewers hanging with a mystery. (Argh!)

However, before that bit of agony the story is again as tightly written and plotted as the first. Kevin, having solved the mystery of his wife and daughter, now is having to deal with the powers of Tammany Hall. This again, while a very important part of American history, is not something that is explored as often as it could be in the modern American psyche. Politicians are making plays for Kevin's beloved Five Points. Money is of course, the biggest power, and while Kevin doesn't have any himself, he does know people who do. He continues to use his own moral compass to guide himself, operating at times against what the law would have him do.

His friendships (especially with Doctor Freeman) are very tested, and strengthened or weakened at various times. We have a huge leap in character growth for Doctor Freeman's wife, Sarah (which is fantastic! most of the women of the show were a bit too spineless for me in the first season, seeing her step up in a big way was great). We also get some new cast members, Sarah's mother, played by Alfre Woodard, a Baldwin brother and Donal Logue.

Kyle Schmid is especially great as Robert Moorehouse, and of course Tom Weston-Jones does a great job carrying off the title role.",1384992000,,1419,4.686746987951807

5712219,5,B00CBJ53HS,"What will happen next. This movie very interesting. Maybe a little too much sex. Seems like all the movies now have to show some skin but the story kept me waiting to see what would happen next. Can't waiti until the next season. Like a good book-want to know more. Good story, good acting, good everything. Sorry to have missed it on tv but glad to have gotten to see it on Amazon!",1383868800,,382,4.2465753424657535

5712223,4,B00CBJ53HS,"My wife and I have watched all of these and it is quite good.  Reminds me a little of Deadwood but without the cussing.  Set in the 5 Points in NYC, it's about an Irish Cop and his exploits in bringing law and order to an area that was notorious for having very little of either just before the time of the US Civil War.

If you like cop shows, shows like Deadwood, or possibly even westerns, you'll enjoy this series no doubt.",1383091200,,427,4.120481927710843

5712225,5,B00CBJ53HS,"This is a fantastic show. The characters are well developed, the historical setting and background plot are absorbing and the narrative is addicting.  However, if I had one complaint it is that the sex scenes are quite gratuitous.  Not Game of Thrones gratuitous, but gratuitous none the less. Am I that simple minded and base that I need to see people copulating every ten minutes in order to pay attention? The audience needs to be respected a bit more. I am no prude, but this trend in modern tv is getting absurd.",1383091200,3,517,4.608695652173913

5712232,4,B00CBJ53HS,"The costuming, sets and photography of Copper are so beautiful that they should have been on the big screen. I thought the characters were very well developed, but the plots a bit thin and predictable, especially in the second season. If the storylines had been condensed into a blockbuster movie, it would have been very enjoyable.  I actually paid for these episodes, and I enjoyed them.",1381968000,,389,4.893939393939394

The police force is comprised mainly of Irish immigrants, many of them had been soldiers in the Civil War from New York.  You see the poorest of the poor and meanest of the mean, and yes, some very good people too like the doctor and his wife.  The series isn't a family affair even though many characters are family oriented.  It's amazing to me how anyone survived Five Points let alone called it home.  But Kevin leads his fellow coppers down the path of justice and makes for a most enjoyable adult series.",1381708800,,592,4.444444444444445

Why???
Cancelling this show was such a mistake!  It is not that people did not want to watch the second season...The first was already up in completion when people discovered it and watched the whole thing through...So the next season everyone was waiting in anticipation..but now a lot of people watch it at their convenience...but they watch it...it was just gaining ground and boom!

5712241,5,B00CBJ53HS,Copper is a unique series that concentrates on the five points district during the time of Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War. Tensions are high especially for the Irish immigrants and freed slaves. The story of Kevin Corcoran is a tragic but dramatic story that deserved to get another season. If nothing else I would love to see a TV movie to wrap up the story left hanging at the end of the second season.,1381104000,,407,4.44
5712242,5,B00CBJ53HS,Great follow up to season 1 and sorry to see it go... Great performances all around from stellar cast in particular addition of Donal Logue doing villain thing here and on Sons of Anarchy (must enjoy being the bad guy). I almost wish the season had ended with the second to the last episode as it would have been a good stopping point. The last episode was setting up threads for a third season and hopefully BBC America will change their minds and give it one more season to finish things out fully.,1381104000,,500,4.387096774193548
5712243,5,B00CBJ53HS,"I literally shed a tear when I heard this series got cancelled. The writers and directors were brilliant, taking these character on huge emotional and personal arcs. AND THE ACTORS!!! I had only ever seen one of them (Anastasia) in a previous production, so they were all new to me, and I am now amongst their biggest fans.
It seems like lately all the shows and books I'm drawn to are set I this time period- it was just so rife with passion and conflict, and so much about what makes our country what it is today. I love that they set the show in Five Points- it's like a modern-day Hells Kitchen, and people are just so unaware of what living in that type of environment would have been like. Kudos to the actors, kudos to the writers, directors, and production team, boo to BBC America for cutting this amazing series too short.",1381104000,,832,4.409090909090909

The characters and settings are very real and the story, set in the 5 Points district of NY seems as gritty and corrupt as I have read in historical accounts.  If you like a little fighting and a little blood and a big story you will like it.",1381104000,,403,4.141025641025641
5712245,5,B00CBJ53HS,"To this amateur historian and former NYC resident, this series provided an outstanding depiction of life in the lower class during one of the city's most turbulent eras. The attention to detail on clothing, furnishings, weapons, and background scenes really make the story come to life. All that was missing was the smells and that is probably a good thing.

It is regrettable that BBC America dropped this series. It was by far the most interesting and entertaining show in their line up. It would be great if AMC, FX or A&E picked it up.",1381104000,,539,4.673684210526316

5712248,2,B00CBJ53HS,I think this show would be sooo much better without so much gratuitous sex shown. Of course we know historically that this went on but the actual showing of the act being done is pornographic.  I love this time period and the characters.  It just needs to be toned down.,1380931200,2,270,4.38

A true picture of life during the period of Tammany Hall and the daily lives of the many diverse race and immigrant groups is vividly portrayed.

5712278,3,B00CBJ53HS,"This series may have exhausted the potential of its concept unless a lot more effort is expended by the producers/directors and creative staff. The anachronistic language is inexcusable, for one thing. When a mid-1800s persona says ""Do the math"" I want to hurl a shoe at the screen. The constricted Five Points set is not cozy anymore; it's claustrophobic, like watching a soap opera that takes place in one apartment. The acting is uneven and, while some players are first-rate some have that ""high school play"" aura. The principal character (Weston-Jones) is, lamentably, the worst actor of the lot. We all forgave him his lack of depth and polish at the outset, but the boyish charm wore off quickly and now viewers are left with a series ""star"" whose dramatic ability runs the gamut from A to B.

5712294,4,B00CBJ53HS,I like the subject matter and the time of struggle. The acting is believable and good.  At times the beatings and treatment of others is a bit too bloody and over the top.,1379030400,,171,4.181818181818182
5712295,1,B00CBJ53HS,I just couldn't watch this show. I knew it was going to be violent because of the subject matter which interests me but to watch a man cutting into a woman's back with a huge knife within one minute of the show's beginning was just too much.,1379030400,,241,4.148936170212766

5712299,4,B00CBJ53HS,"The show was a Netflix recommendation based on my viewing habits. Of course I was skeptical but I have to admit I do like the show. I did not think that I would care about Irish immigrants in NYC during the 1860's but the show has introduced issues of slavery, the under ground railroad, the civil war, poverty, power, position, status, uptown vs downtown, corruption, politics, loyalty, friendships, race relations, sanitation, poor health conditions, death and dying, infidelity, love, lost,  and conflicts. The main characters have their own weaknesses and strengths to a degree that they could be human and you as a viewer are left to care about them in your own way. This is not your run-of-the-mill kind of show and yet it is not so involved that you get exhausted from watching it.  I have been pleasantly surprised.",1378771200,,823,4.829787234042553

5712305,5,B00CBJ53HS,"Copper reminds me of an Irish, working-class version of Sherlock Holmes.  But, with way more twists and turns.  Be forewarned that the language in this show is not for the faint of heart and is entirely realistic for the era (i.e. use of the N word).  However, the storyline is intriguing and the characters are ones that you want to see triumph at one point and then at others, you want to see them get what's coming to them!  No one in this show is either good or bad.  Every one displays both sides at various points and that is what will keep you coming back to this show.  It's definitely best to start with the first season as the writers do not rehash all of the backstories.  So, while you can watch from Season 2 on, you'll be missing out on a lot of the character development.",1378425600,,786,4.27027027027027
5712306,5,B00CBJ53HS,I love the time period and the political angles that are involved that go beyond just the slavery issues.  It is also interesting to see the American history from the BBC point of view.,1378339200,,185,4.4411764705882355

5712310,4,B00CBJ53HS,"If you want to watch a tv show that gives you glimpses into NYC history, the Irish Immigration and Civil War era this show gives it all.  This isn't a History Channel show but a dramatic interpretation of a period in the formation of NYC and it's cultural diversity. Makes you want to learn more about Five Points section of NY, how crime and racism were viewed & dealt with during the late 19th century. I suggest watching Season 1 to get a better understanding of the characters in Season 2",1378252800,,492,4.406593406593407

5712313,4,B00CBJ53HS,"The historical perspective is interesting but the inclusion of  a Negro physician is a bit gratuitous. It is after all, the mid 19th century.

It's a bit difficult to follow the accents at times",1378252800,,355,5.0

To m Weston-Jones is still excellent and all the actors are doing the best they can, but the material is too chaotic.

I am so sorry about it.",1378166400,,304,4.472727272727273

5712317,3,B00CBJ53HS,"The violence is a bit much, and the contrivances of getting rid of Copper's wife and Annie a bit too convenient.  Suicide is serious and hard to view for entertainment.

The opium is overdone at this point - people got addicted - point made. How did they solve the problem back then without rehab?  The plot needs to be better, less violent, and more to issues and character development - issues beyond the insanity of the Civil War, color, and whorehouses.  The hospital part could be better developed.

Tammany Hall was corrupt but there have to have been people who were not.  Eva's pregnancy - it's almost a given that she's lying about the father. A dagger in the eye?  A madam might have stabbed someone in self-defense, but not in the eye - that was awful.

Cooper himself needs to show another side than the hard-talking cop, or the interrogator.  The man needs to make a plan, and probably move from where his wife committed suicide.",1377820800,,942,4.592814371257485

5712329,5,B00CBJ53HS,"There is a lot of action and suspense. The time period shows a more raw and barbaric frame of mind which people seemed to have back then; and it is about the corruption that existed, but it's also about bending the rules to serve justice, and the star of the show, Kevin Corkran serves as the best example of how this is artfully done. The soundtrack is excellent too!",1377388800,,368,4.3478260869565215

5712335,5,B00CBJ53HS,Copper is a wonderful take on the Civil War era including the societal mindset between classes and races. To me one of the most interesting aspects of the show is the take of the newly immigrated Irish about involvement in the War of the Rebellion by the South. I understand from studying history how the draft riots happened in New York but it is enlightening to really get a perspective into the class war as seen through Irish eyes. It's difficult from our 21st century sensibilities to see how the Irish tended to view slavery and newly made freedmen but it is part of the fabric of our country and its origin sin. I highly recommend this series and hope that it spurs discussion for others as much as it has for me. I must note that I am of Irish descent.,1377129600,,760,4.359154929577465
5712336,5,B00CBJ53HS,"I am not much for faithfully watching a weekly series, but I made an exception for this one. Love it! I like the flow, and that it doesn't beat a storyline for a whole season. The pace is fast, the storyline interesting and the men gorgeous. What more could you want?",1377129600,,267,4.254901960784314
5712337,5,B00CBJ53HS,Loved the historical context and the characters are really brought to life by the actors.  I found the references to historical people and events interesting but not so overbearing as to obscure the storyline.,1377043200,,209,5.147058823529412

5712339,5,B00CBJ53HS,5 Points after the war--the Civil war.  These are very diamond in the rough episodes that hint at what likely occurred in the early days of the New York police (possibly what happens now and then in these times ?).,1376956800,,214,4.35
5712340,5,B00CBJ53HS,"I found this fantastic yarn through Netflix and now and now I'm following up on Amazon.  Last season I wondered many things about Kevin and those very questions were answered in episode three.  I stayed up until 3a.m. to see the entire season 1.

The acting is superb and the sets are most realistic, bravo to the BBC. I was sorry to hear that they couldn't come to terms with ""Hell on Wheels"" to share that set for an episode or two.

The romantic in me wanted Kevin and Ellen to reunite and have another child, you know ""The happily ever after"" scenario. However, after the adultery and the child's murder Kevin should have grounds for divorce, even for the Catholic church.

Ah yes, Little Annie needs to go.  I realize she was rescued by Kevin from a horrible life. but that obsessive, jealous little psychotic
needs to go.",1376956800,,827,4.516778523489933

5712344,5,B00CBJ53HS,"Oh to be rid of reality TV forever and just have series like Copper and Luther both put out by BBC America. There are striking similarities between Copper and the book City of Eros: NYC, Prostitution and the Commercialization of sex, 1790-1920 and I believe that is one reason why I have enjoyed the series so much since the writers are going about the stories from an historical angle. The only problem I have with the show is the amount of eye makeup the actresses are wearing. Eye shadow of so many varying hues weren't around in the 1800's. This, however, by no means takes away from the quality of the production.",1376352000,,618,4.526785714285714
5712345,5,B00CBJ53HS,Copper is gritty and shows openly how hard life was in the bowels of New York.  Irish pride established a desire for incorruptible management of the position of law enforcement.  I so await more...,1376179200,,197,4.764705882352941
5712346,5,B00CBJ53HS,"Copper is an engrossing, fascinating, a riveting story! There's not much to dislike about Copper except Donavan is more of a politician than a police officer and in the first show it seemed like he was more brawn than brain however, this series holds my attention fully. The series is a beautiful hurtful, sad but lovely love story. One thing to point out is I doubt 5 points would allow Lincoln banners to hang throughout the neighborhood but then again I don't watch the series for it's historical accuracies. I'm in love with Copper!",1376179200,,536,4.712765957446808
