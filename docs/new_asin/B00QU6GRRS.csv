6881575,5,B00QU6GRRS,"The main character is disturbing and hateful, yet you can't take your eyes off him. It's a dark film with purpose though. Worth a look.",1425340800,3,135,4.44
6881576,5,B00QU6GRRS,"I run my own Film and Television entertainment website and I was recently fortunate enough to be graced with a pre-screener copy of Misogynist to review. Being a massive fan of thrillers I was very excited about watching this film after viewing the trailer, and let me tell you with absolutely no equivocations; Misogynist is truly outstanding. The story grips you from the very start. It is wonderfully unique and is a refreshing change from all the other generic thrillers that are out there. The writing is just superb and every character has been created with brilliant vision and passion. Michael Matteo Rossi has crafted a wonderful thriller that will have you glued to the screen from start to finish and the performances from the cast are second to none. Misogynist is one of the best thrillers that I have ever seen and it truly raises the bar for any that thrillers that follow it. This is an easy 5 star for me and I cannot wait to see what Rossi brings us in the future. Misogynist will blow you away.",1423267200,11,1013,4.602209944751381

6881578,1,B00QU6GRRS,"Great...MORE sexism and women hate. As if there's not enough garbage pushing pushing female submission, i.e. sexism. Universe forbid women make a movie that seduces men into submission...oh no that'll be man hate...well this is woman hate. Only weak little boys who can't handle strong women do this crap. This is why FSOG should be burned, along with the woman that wrote it.

21st century and women are still fighting for equality...gee, I wonder why...

Now I'll know to stay FAR AWAY from this pos.",1421193600,6,502,4.894117647058824
6881579,4,B00QU6GRRS,"I saw the film at a local festival last year and was pretty impressed. Definitely an indie film, but captivating story and a strong performance by the lead character. Glad to see it's coming out.",1419811200,11,195,4.6
6881580,4,B00QU6GRRS,"MISOGYNIST is a superb drama-thriller with something for everyone.  It's smart and edgy, with just the right amount of twists and interesting characters to keep you glued to the screen.  The writing, directing, acting, and production are overall flawless.  Ultimately it's about a conman/sociopath which has been done before (Matchstick Men is one of my favorites), but I liked that the story is timely with gender politics being such big talking point in our society right now.  I give the movie 4 stars instead of 5 only because I think there could have been a tiny bit more to the whole story, but regardless it's a great film I would recommend.

**NOTE: Don't let the cover art and title mislead you! This isn't a misogynistic film only guys will enjoy.  Guys, girls, and couples will all find something to like about it, and in the end the men are clearly the bad guys.  I can imagine fans of 50 SHADES OF GREY will enjoy this movie a lot.",1419811200,11,944,4.583333333333333
6881581,5,B00QU6GRRS,"I'm extremely proud of our film. It's raw and it's edgy and it's designed to make an audience feel uneasy, scared and angry. Michael pushed the limits on this and achieved what every independent film strives for... Thought provoking storytelling.

The SUPER close ups are annoyingly constant with a s*** for nothing story line.

SPOILERS
The old guy tries to 'train' guys to be self proclaimed a-holes to women, to 'train' them to obey men and receive abuse. This would be a 'fine' story line if they actually did anything other than make a girl look like a whore.
The end of the story comes immediately after the beginning, where the young guy where the young guy forces his new bride to have sex with him, he ends up getting shot and killed by his bride while his bride's estranged father is trying to beat him up.

It's a huge mish-mash of crappy acting and poor story telling.

6881644,2,B00QU6GRRS,"Trevor (Jon Briddell) takes the love torn Harrison (Jonathan Bennett) under his wing and teaches him about women. Harrison in return recruits more students as Trevor has created a cult where he teaches men how to control beautiful women by basically being an a-hole. Much of this low budget  film is guys talking about what women want, lumping them all together as if they are the same and can all be treated the same. There are some flashbacks.

I found the discussions boring. Women might like watching this, thinking it is akin to a Cosmo article on what men are like, but I found it insulting as it too lumps men all together as simply animals that want to completely control women and use them as sex objects. BTW that naked girl on the cover is not in the film.

6881661,1,B00QU6GRRS,"If you are watching this film in hopes of seeing beautiful women submitting to men, you will be sadly disappointed.  I would say 75%-90% of this movie is men talking to men about women, at a couple of different times in the movie I had to fast forward the movie because I wasn't viewing it so look at men.  There are only 3 women in this film, and to me only 1 of the 3 woman is attractive.  The first woman you see (aka woman #1) in this movie, looks like a hooker who has seen better days.  Unfortunately, woman #1 is the woman who gets the most screen time.  The more I think about this movie the more I realize that it's just a sad depressing story of a divorced man who has lost everything in the world that mattered to him, including his soul, in his divorce and now wants to share his psychosis with other men so that they will be like him so that he won't feel so alone in the world.  IF YOU DON'T WANT KNOW ABOUT THE PLOT TWIST AT THE END OF THIS MOVIE,AND OTHER SPOLERS, THEN DON'T READ WHAT I'M PUTING IN ALL CAPS.  WHAT'S MOST DEPRESSING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT THE CENTRAL CHARACTER IS A MISOGYNIST TOWARDS HIS OWN DAUGHTER, AND USES ANOTHER MAN (HIS ASSISTANT) TO TRY AND GET BACK ALL THE MONEY HE LOST IN HIS DIVORCE BY ORCHESTRATING THE ASSISTANT'S MARRIAGE TO HIS DAUGHTER.  NEITHER THE ASSISTANT OR THE DAUGHTER KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON, PRESUMBLY THE DAUGHTER HASN'T SEEN HER DAD IN YEARS.  THE CENTRAL CHARACTER MAKES HIS ASSISTANT PROMISE TO ""TEAR UP THAT P***Y"" (AKA MAKE HER HURT) ON HIS WEDDING NIGHT.  THE ASSISTANT DOES EXACTLY AS PROMOISED AND IMMEDIATELY REGRETS IT AND THEN REALIZES THAT HE'S ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE TURNED INTO A MONSTER.  IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE BRUTAL SEXUAL ENCOUNTER THE ASSITANT WONDERS OUT ONTO THE PATIO NEAR THE POOL TO WALLOW IN SELF LOATHING, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER SHOWS UP WITH A BOTTLE OF CHAMPIGNE TO CELEBRATE HIS PLAN WORKING TO PERFECTION.  THE ASSISTANT TELLS HIM WHAT'S HAPPENED AND THE MARRAIAGE ENDED AFTER HE HAD SEX.  THE TWO MEN THEN FIGHT BECAUSE THE ASSITANT HAD RUINED THE MAIN CHARACTER'S PLAN.  AS THE ASSISTANT IS STRANGLING THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, THERE IS THE BANG OF A GUN SHOT, THE WIFE HAS SHOT HER NEW HUSBUND (IN THE BACK) AND HE FALLS DEAD INTO THE POOL.  SHE THEN DEMANDS THAT THE CENTRAL CHARACTER SHOW HER HIS FACE (HE HAS BEEN AVOIDING LOOKING AT HER DURRING THE ALTERCATION), HE SHOWS HER HIS FACE AND SHE SAYS ""DADDY?"".

Where to start?  Every character was uniquely loathsome, though the virginal fiancee had to be the worst, with her whining and melodramatic sniveling.  The screenwriter ought to hang his head in shame for producing dialogue so cliche I actually had to avert my eyes.  Mentally-challenged high school freshmen have written better, I'd bet.

I have a high tolerance for misogynistic films, for slow-moving films, for weird psychological concept films, and even for gratuitous violence, and yet this film managed to bore, disgust and disappoint even me.  The concept had potential but ultimately the film had little psychological insight to offer and the so-called plot twist was blatantly obvious from the beginning.  The only mystery was how Harrison could be dumb enough not to see it too. The viewer has to put up with foul language, screamed lines, and men punching each other over nothing to get through the film, and the few scenes with the women are not even remotely credible or psychologically interesting.",1429056000,10,707,4.983050847457627

6881669,3,B00QU6GRRS,"Waaay to short a run time for what really could be a great film. No spoilers the movie does that for itself about two thirds the way in. The gripping monster's the mirror moment would have a much greater impact if we saw how deep the devil gets, and how many disposable souls get used up. I can't help thinking if the movie had a full 1hrs 45 min run time the extra 30 min could have really made a tragic story of a poor guy at his absolute low being risen again by a devil only to fall completely trying to destroy that devil. Extra time would have split up certain scenes that accure so closely it connects the dots leaving an ending that can  be seen coming a mile away.

Overall it was very well played and does leaving you wanting more just not as a squeal but in the movie itself. Don't regret buying It, and would say give it a go just don't expect too much of anything from it.",1427932800,,885,4.080459770114943

With a higher budget and some re-writing this could make a more powerful movie and more of a point.  It takes way too long of watching crap that makes you want to throw something at the screen to get to the meat of the story. I stuck with it only because I had been reading some of the other reviews.  I feel this movie misses out on what it could have been. But it really shows you how screwed up people can become over relationships and revenge.  It also shows how weak minds can be manipulated by those whose whole goal in life is to do just exactly that.",1427328000,2,673,4.122137404580153

I believe it's a film that can be watched over and over again. The actors performances where great and very convincing specially John Briddell's, who manages to show a deep and troubled personality with a dark and surprising past. This is probably one of the most unique films I have seen in a while addressing a theme which almost nobody has ever done before. Michael Matteo Rossi managed to create something so different and amazing that will leave you wanting more.

Misogynist very effectively addresses and deals with the subject of ""conquering women"", something most men face one way or another, particularly in 2015.. A big subject to address, yet unfortunately not so much explored in film, at least not quite as engagingly as here... If such big and unique subjects continue being raised by Michael Matteo Rossi so wonderfully crafted and entertainingly in his future works, this might just be the first feature film of one of big names of the next generation of filmmakers!!!",1426550400,3,663,5.205607476635514

6881689,5,B00QU6GRRS,"Well this is my take on the movie!!
I know is not for a lady to see this kind of story on pellicola, but for someone like me that
has been screwed so many times in real time by shrewd ladies the story serves them well!!
I like it! and I say it again, I like it!!! Matteo Rossi should return to Italy as well to make some provocative movies over there,
that country is upside down with the poor political leaders, they are ruining a beautiful culture!!
Back to the movie, it's a very good story and I applaude the Regista for the guts he had to create this disturbing film ( For some in the pink)
But for most of us poor men that recentely we have been put down and rediculed in every turn in our daily life, It's refreshing to see a director bring it on!!!
Can't wait to see more of this kind of racy story on the screen!!

I could tell by their description of it and the characters, I was going to watch Misogynist the minute I could get my hands on it! The trailer pulled me in even more. I have to say if any of you reading this are familiar with Jonathan Bennett from the movie ""Mean Girls"" he's the ""mean girl"" in this movie along with Jon Briddell! Now with that said you think you have the characters and storyline figured out... uh uh not even close. Twists and turns along the way that make you watch every single minute of it because you don't want to miss a thing. This is pure drama at its best. The writing, directing, producing, all expertly done and I can see why Michael has won awards and will win awards for his work. Every actor and crew member deserves awards as well.

8692977,2,B00QU6GRRS,"Okay so like the lighting, the editing, the sets, all of it... looks mostly like a mid-budget drama, but it's not, because the script is weird and hinky, people say things like ""MOTHER I NEED TO HAVE TRUST IN HIM"" which no one has said in real like since the 1960s, and ""Keep your words close to your vest"" which is not an idiom that is remotely normal.

Also it's like... vaguely an attempt to criticize PUAs and misogyny, but manages to like triple down on the virgin/whore dichotomy by having like ""Well it's okay to abuse sluts, but VIRGINAL CATHOLIC GIRLS NO WAY"", and be like... weirdly religious at the same time.  Also like is this movie made by the Catholic church, because it feels vaguely like a ""darker and edgier"" attempt to appeal to TheYouthTM by the church.

ANYWAY it's actually amazing because it's so hilariously bad in a way you rarely see in today's cinema, but also like, it's genuinely bad, not quite ""The Room"" bad, but like funnier because it's almost normal, and then wildly not.",1516665600,,1005,4.572222222222222

Not a bad story line if more of the back story was given. I like a good villainous story if I can see into the heart of the bad guy and understand what made him turn however that was not aafforded to me in this film. A scene or two of him being a loving husband and father married to a calculating money grubbing screw would have made all of the difference.

The film is a psychological thriller?? or true crime?? IDK It's a cross-genre.  I watched it hoping for some insight into misogynistic mentality for a character in my book. It delivered that. It also delivered the pain beneath misogynistic behaviors which I'm not certain is always there. It isn't a feel-good movie. It's a movie about the darker side of humanity. There aren't many brave enough to make a film entirely focused on villains and abusive relationships this film did so with the bluntness of reality and no sugar coating. A jagged pill to swallow. That said I knocked off a star because I personally don't like exposing my mind to so much brutality despite how keenly done. Again it is based on a true story so be warned it's truth you may wish you didn't know. I prefer to believe people are better than this and prefer to be ignorant of the exceptions. So four stars for being well done, accurate portrayal of events, and extreme emotional reactions to the point of wanting to upchuck.",1474502400,,1135,4.563725490196078
