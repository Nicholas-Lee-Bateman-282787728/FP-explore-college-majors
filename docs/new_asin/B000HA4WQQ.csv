I refuse to watch ""Little Shop"" because of the disgraceful colorization of someone's work.  Would have preferred one of Nicholson's other early films in a good print.",1452211200,,277,4.75
8137918,3,B000HA4WQQ,"When I preordered the Jack to Jack edition, the box did not proclaim LSOH colorization.  Upon receipt I considered sending it back unopened.  Actually, I'm glad I didn't.  Cry Baby Killer is a reasonable entertainment that has quite devious and anti-establishment observations about most of the cast, who represent various factions of society.  Though rather stage bound (only three major sets - bar, storeroom, and outside the bar and storeroom), this is overcome with good camera angles and extraneous business from cops, relatives, onlookers, hot dog vendors, and especially the tv crew.  I came away considering it a cheap but effective rip/tribute of Billy Wilder's Ace In the Hole/The Big Carnival.  And Jack Nicholson's part as a young, inexperienced and confused youth comes accross as young, inexperienced, and confused.  Lots to chew on here, such as who is untimately to blame for the situation.  On to LSOH, though I loathe colorization, this particular film, being also very stage bound does get some advantage from the color - Audrey Junior looks much more alien all green with cotton candy interior.  Audrey Senior and the hooker are better eye candy as well.  Would have been a superior package with the B&W LSOH, but I suspect the change was made to challenge the Legends colorized release product.  Overall, I'm happy with it.",1166659200,6,1344,5.091324200913242
8137919,1,B000HA4WQQ,"Okay, first of all, this should be a ""Little Shop of Horrors - Special Edition"" with ""Cry Baby Killer"" as an added bonus feature.  And ""L.S. or H."" should be in black-and-white as it was filmed.  This is disgraceful, and I hope Buena Vista refrains from messing up any more Corman titles in the future.",1165276800,7,302,4.472727272727273
8137920,1,B000HA4WQQ,"After all these years, we finally receive an ""official"" release of Roger Corman's wonderful LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS (1960) -- and Jack Nicholson's film debut is thrown in, too! Wonderful!

Or so I thought. The disc arrived today, and was sent back today. It's COLORIZED. Yep. And no option for B&W, either. Ya wanna watch LITTLE SHOP, you have to see it with that crappy computer color that makes everybody look embalmed. My new choice for WORST DVD OF THE YEAR. What a MASSIVE disappointment.
