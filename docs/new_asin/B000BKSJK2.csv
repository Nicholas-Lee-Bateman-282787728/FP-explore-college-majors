8157903,5,B000BKSJK2,"Del Zamora and Valente Rodriguez are very funny in this Latino family comedy. Valente Rodriguez played George Lopez's best friend Ernie, on the George Lopez show for the entire run. Del Zamora is the lead actor, Leroy in this independent comedy and he is great. Del Zamora is under-rated in show business. He was great as the main Waas Sappening Boy in ""Born in East LA"" (psst, psst, psst), Lagarto Rodriguez in ""Repo Man"", and a truly original comedic turn as Alejandro in Warren Beatty's ""Town & Country"". I recommend ""Never Trust A Serial Killer"". It is a genuine indie movie. Our family loved it and we laughed and laughed.",1247702400,2,627,4.709090909090909
