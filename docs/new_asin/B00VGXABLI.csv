And all the others are just as involving and breathtaking. Worth buying (or renting) a 3d passive/active Tv, Blu-ray.",1434672000,9,265,4.782608695652174
7090038,5,B00VGXABLI,"If you're like me and have any interest whatsoever in the history of the movies, then this collection is an absolute must for a number of reasons. 1) it dispels the notion that 3-D began back in the early 1950s (it was actually in 1915!). 2) it offers a remarkable array of different offerings with everything from early urban panoramas to an anti-nuclear documentary to a CASPER THE FRIENDLY GHOST cartoon. There's even a jaw-dropping short burlesque film complete with full figured stripper and baggy pants comics. 3) it provides not only entertainment but is informative as well. 4) the 3-D isn't necessary to be able to enjoy these 3-D rarities.

Of course anyone  who has the capability of 3-D playback will find an added dimension to these offerings (sorry, couldn't resist that one) but I, who can't watch them in 3-D, was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the 22 short films that make up this Blu-Ray offering. There is something for everyone here. My personal favorites were the two 1940 offerings THRILLS FOR YOU, a look at how railroad locomotives were made and then a thrilling train ride courtesy of the Pennsylvania Railroad and NEW DIMENSIONS which enables the viewer to watch  a 1940 Plymouth being assembled from start to finish through stop motion animation. Even seen flat (in 2-D)  they have a lot to offer.

Other shorts that captured my attention include the promotional film for the Bolex 3-D home movie camera, the boxing match with its early replay scenario, the CASPER cartoon, and the burlesque short (burlesque comedy really was as bad as people say). The 3-D documentary DOOM TOWN was shockingly frank for the time and eerily prophetic. Then there were the numerous trailers for 3-D features. Back in the late 1970s when I was living in Charleston SC, a local arts cinema had a 3-D festival and I got to see the 2 Richard Carlson features IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE and THE MAZE. I would love to see them again as well as other 1950s offerings in the new digital 3-D process.

Maybe it's just because I'm older now (I'm 63) but I find the older 3-D offerings more enjoyable than the new ones. Some of that has to do with the fact that not every 3-D offering today was conceived in 3-D only enhanced after the fact. Also today's movies are so much LONGER and so much LOUDER. Anyway my deepest thanks to 3-D film Archives for lovingly restoring this treasure trove and to Flicker Alley for making it available. I wish that it were possible with this set to just put on your glasses and have the image available without all the special equipment. That would make these shorts accessible to everyone. Still, even without that capability, this collection still ranks as a must see if you're a true movie geek.",1434412800,16,2740,4.686070686070686
7090039,5,B00VGXABLI,"I have received an advance copy of 3D rarities, and all I can say is WOW! if you are at all a fan of 3D (and if you have a 3D capable set-up at home you probably are), then this is an absolute must purchase.
Contemporary 3D films just don't take full advantage of the medium the way these classics did. The sense of depth and in many cases projection is astounding, and Bob Furmanek and crew have done a terrific job of rescuing and restoring these various films from the basements and garages of forgotten history.
The presentation and packaging are first rate, including the very informative booklet. This is a labor of scholarship and love, but also great entertainment. For animation fans this Includes a wonderful rare stop motion film, The Adventures of Sam Space with voices by Paul Frees, and one of the few ""golden age"" 3D cartoon shorts from a major studio, Casper the Friendly Ghost in Boo Moon.
3D blu ray releases in general are becoming too rare, and classic ones are still sadly almost non-existent. I really hope fans will vote with their purchases to keep releases like this coming out.",1434412800,8,1103,4.604060913705584
7090040,5,B00VGXABLI,"I was at the Museum of Modern Art premiere of 3D rarities on June 13 and I am still in awe not only at the diversity of this collection, but at the quality of the restorations and the depth of the 3D itself. I have Amblyopia so my depth perception is lousy, to say the least. I was astounded at the depth these shorts had and at how well I was able to see that depth, especially in The Adventures of Sam Space(1960) a puppetoon that looks newly minted and Boo Moon(1953), a Casper the Friendly Ghost short which I'd seen dozens of times when I was a kid and never even knew it had been done in 3D! These have been so thoroughly and lovingly restored you will swear that they were made just yesterday! Ditto for New Dimensions(1940) where you will see a brand new 1940 Plymoth building itself from the ground up in eye-popping color and in-your-face 3D. All this and more in a collection that is a definite MUST-HAVE for any lover of 3D Cinema!",1434326400,8,943,4.273743016759776
7090041,5,B00VGXABLI,"I discovered film history as a kid. From ""Famous Monsters"" magazine and ""Horror Movies"" by Alan G. Frank, I soon graduated to more serious books of film scholarship at my local library. I read anything and everything I could get my hands on.

Almost every reference I ran across made it seem like 3-D was born and died within a few short months in the early 1950s, and that that death was really a mercy for all concerned. To hear these self-appointed guardians of cinematic dignity tell it, 3-D was purely a gimmick, designed only to make money (as though commerce were a thing to be disdained!) and never worthy of serious exploration by real artists. In my youthful naivete, I assumed ten dozen critics couldn't be wrong.

Then I saw my first 3-D movie. I was stunned. The movie wasn't great, not by a long shot, but even at a young age I could see that the medium had heavy potential. Come to find out, plenty of other smart, creative people have thought the same thing.

""3-D Rarities"" assembles surviving American and Canadian stereoscopic shorts and fragments dating clear back to 1922. The very earliest scenes on this disc, filmed in Washington, D.C., and New York City, show remarkable restraint and compositional mastery. Films from later in the 1920s and the 1930s showcase the dynamic possibilities of off-the-screen action. And how! By the time the 1950s roll around, we find skilled filmmakers, undaunted by either the technical or aesthetic challenges of 3-D, willing to turn the medium to purposes whimsical (the NFBC sequence of shorts, ""Boo Moon"") and serious (""Doom Town,"" ""Miss Sadie Thompson"") and everything in between.

What Bob Furmanek, Greg Kintz, and their colleagues have done here is really nothing short of miraculous. Furmanek personally has rescued more vintage 3-D motion pictures from oblivion than any other single person, and several items presented here literally would not survive apart from his efforts. Greg Kintz has applied his special knowledge to tweak the scanned footage, correcting geometric distortions and the occasional stereo anomaly, and making these films look better overall than they have ever looked before. Their associates, good folks like the late Dan Symmes, Jack Theakston, Thad Komorowski, and John McElwee (of Greenbriar Picture Shows) have made their contributions as well. I know I'm grateful to them all.

If you are at all curious about the trajectory stereoscopic cinema has taken over the years, if you are a fan of classic 3-D, if you are tired of the bland, timid, all-but-flattened-out 3-D of so many recent efforts out of Hollywood, if you are willing to look to 3-D's past in order to conceive alternative approaches in 3-D's future, then you really owe it to yourself to lay hands on ""3-D Rarities.""

It's no overstatement: ""3-D Rarities"" is a must-have disc.",1434240000,11,2835,4.983086680761099
7090042,5,B00VGXABLI,"Hello Everyone!

I write 3D reviews for Home Theater Forum.  I own a collection of well over 100 3D titles and have excellent knowledge of how those titles look on a quality home screen.

I am also very much aware of how awful today's Hollywood 3D releases have become.  The industry has ruined the 3D format.  It's failure has nothing to do with the public's disinterest in the format, but rather Hollywood's disinterest in providing anything thrilling to look at.  Most (or nearly all, actually) of what is released today to theaters and Blu-ray are upconversions done in post production.  This means that filmmakers simply shot their film flat and then converted it afterwards.  This is not how it was done in the 1950s during the ""Golden Era"" of 3D filmmaking, and as thus, what Hollywood is giving us today is a pale comparison of what viewers were treated to decades ago.

The death of 3D is totally the fault of of today's filmmakers.  Nobody believes in shooting natively in 3D, nor wants to provide the smallest amount of pop-out to give audiences something hair-raising to remember, long after the final credits roll.

Allow me to give you some ""highlights"" from my Home Theater Forum review. Some rewording has been done to provide better formatting here on Amazon.

================================================

3-D Rarities is the most prized Blu-ray in my library of well over 100 3D titles.  It is the absolute best 3D title currently available -- and it accomplishes that task without being Avatar.

While some may greatly argue with my opinion, I beg you to read further, as I will attempt to explain why this release is so very, very important and how it succeeds in pleasing all audiences, whether you prefer dramatic pop-out or simply wonderful depth to enhance the onscreen visuals.

It all starts with my first meeting with 3-D Archive Preservationist, Robert Furmanek.  It was not too surprising that he found me through this forum, given the fact that I was touting myself as an HTF 3D ADDICT.  Knowing how much I appreciated the format, he invited to his home to treat me to a showing of classic archive material he was looking to get released.  That meeting took place in 2012.

At that point, I had never seen any classic 3D material.  Everything I knew about 3D was based upon recent releases.  My opinion at the time was that anything from the classic era of 3D could never live up to the grandeur of Avatar or anything being brought to Blu-ray at the time.  I could just imagine Mr. Furmanek's interest in showing me the material he had acquired.

That meeting with Bob Furmanek literally changed my life.

Now most of that material that I was privately shown can be shared with this release of 3-D RARITIES.

One of the most startling moments for me -- which brings home the historical significance of the contained material -- comes at the disc's very first presentation, Thru' The Trees.  Here is a look at our nation's capitol during the early 1920s, including a reunion of Civil War veterans at Arlington Cemetery.  Though the footage is a little rough, one gets a nice sense of depth and spacing while sitting in awe of the documented footage.

There are some terrific pop-outs that include an old hag delivering a poisonous concoction that extends off the screen before being thrown in your face. Later, a delivered hot dog protrudes so far off the screen that it comes inches from the the viewer's lips.  The effect will be quite memorable for those that rarely see this kind of protrusion from their current 3D titles.

But Wait!  Things are about to get even better.  A sequence from 1935's John Norling/Jacob Leventhal tests takes us to the Thunderbolt rollercoaster on Coney Island. I swear to you, watching the coaster car climb to the very top of the tracks and then plunge itself downward, across a 118"" projected screen, was a pretty queasy experience for me.  I would estimate some others will feel exactly the same way no matter what their screen size.

Most viewers should enjoy the 1940 promotional short, Thrills For You, which features the Pennsylvania Railroad, the most elegant method of rail travel for its time.  Though there is no pop-out to be found here, the method of photography provides a very interesting level of depth of the inside capacity of the train and the passing landscape alongside it.

Another highly enjoyable short (though a bit too lengthy for its own good) is New Dimensions, Chrysler's promotional short that premiered during the 1940 World's Fair.  It took nine weeks to photograph the stop motion animation, set to music, which depicts the building of a Plymouth Sedan.  The fascinating short provides an adequate amount of depth as automobile parts are ""magically"" placed into position.  It should be noted that the short has been restored from the only known surviving 35mm Technicolor print.  It looks wonderful.

There are several drawn animated features from Canadian resident Norman McLaren that include: Now Is The Time, Around Is Around and Twirligig.  I found Twirligig the most captivating watch for its animated optics that come right off the screen and dance inches before the viewer's face.  It's almost a hypnotic sort of sensation that should elicit a few ""oohs"" and ""aaahs"" from all who view it.

My favorite segment within this package M.L. Gunzburg Presents Natural Vision 3-Dimension.  Originally shown in 1952 as a prologue to Bwana Devil, this short serves as an educational tool to audiences not familiar with the new technology that had just crept into their theaters.  Not only does the short feature the beautiful Shirley Tegge (1949's Miss USA), but also the very popular Beany and Cecil who get to experiment with their own glasses.  I hope viewers will find this as entertaining as I did, as I feel it is one of the best shorts within this assemblage.

For those of you who cherish trailers, there are plenty to be found here.  We have four from 1953:  It Came From Outer Space, The Maze, Miss Sadie Thompson and Hannah Lee.  Though Hannah Lee succumbed to financial and technical problems prior to its release, in my opinion it is one of the best trailers in the collection due to its noteworthy pop-out near its close.

Perhaps the short that put the biggest smile on my face was the Casper The Friendly Ghost cartoon, Boo Moon, produced in 1953.  You know, I haven't seen a Casper cartoon since I was a kid.  Bob Furmanek had originally shown it to me back in 2012, but I had forgotten about it.  So, when I saw the familiar logo and music suddenly appear onscreen, I felt like a kid all over again.  This time, I was watching a full-fledged 3D cartoon -- and it looked AWESOME -- thanks to its perfectly layered placement of objects.  No doubt, those of you who grew up in the Casper era are going to really enjoy this short.

What puts this collection at the very top of my HOME THEATER FORUM TOP 3D TITLES list is partly historic, but more for the fact that it will please those who love pop-out and those who love only depth that the format provides. Most everything presented here has a very ""exaggerated"" dimensional look and feel to it.  Those who grew up with View-Master stereoscopes are really going to appreciate the intensity of the 3D.  Those who like pop-out, on the other hand, are going to be exceptionally thrilled by a myriad of close encounters with objects that project themselves directly at the audience.  This is the kind of stuff that Hollywood of today won't even consider doing.  And, if you are as bored with today's 3D filmmaking as I am, you will view 3-D Rarities as a breath of fresh air.

I would estimate that because you are reading this review, you love film and have a keen interest in 3D.  Well, imagine yourself going into an old attic, rummaging around the multitude of spider-web covered artifacts that are strewn across the floor.  Suddenly, you uncover an old box without a label.  You open it -- and behold -- you find an aged collection of 3D movie reels.  Your entire body tingles with excitement knowing the treasure you have just uncovered.

That is the feeling I had when I first saw much of this material for the first time back in 2012.  I experienced the same feeling this very week when I watched 3-D Rarities for the first time and discovered even more stuff I had never seen before.

And you know what?  This isn't even the tip of the iceberg as far as what material still lies out there.  I have seen things in Bob Furmanek's personal collection that may never be released.  HTF Members who came out to our 2012 meet were treated to much of the same material that is copyright protected and may never see the light of day.

This is the real stuff when it comes to 3D.  It's the kind of disc you'll throw on to demonstrate to friends exactly what your system is capable of producing.  Don't expect today's Hollywood films to come close to the the level of dimensional enjoyment you will experience here.",1433808000,187,8973,4.7105263157894735
7090043,5,B00VGXABLI,"I recently saw the final master of 3D Rarities and I have to say I am more than impressed by the work done by Bob Furmanek and Greg Kintz on this release. This amazing collection contains a number of 3D shorts that I have seen before projected in dual strip 35mm, but they have never looked better than they do here. Many, remastered in 4K wet gate scanning look brand new on the screen, with amazing off screen 3D. The collection ranges from experimental films from the 1920s through the golden age of Hollywood with trailers, promos, and period shorts. There's the absolutely stunning Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoon BOO MOON, which I've seen many times in 35mm. Another rare item is a short subject produced by the Pennsylvania Railroad for the 1939 World's Fair. Being a rail fan, you can imagine what it's like to see Pennsy steamers and GG1s in action AND in 3D! Then there's SAM SPACE, MOTOR RHYTHM, Slick Slavin's STARDUST IN YOUR EYES, and so much more! The essays by the featured speakers are top notch. With a running time of almost 2 1/2 hours, there is something for everyone on this disc. You will not be disappointed.",1428537600,54,1134,4.5911330049261085
7090044,5,B00VGXABLI,"I also got to see an advanced copy of 3-D Rarities.  We projected it onto a 9 foot wide movie screen via a Panasonic 3D video projector, and all I have to say is WOW!  With a run time of almost 2 1/2 hours, there is something for everyone.  I especially liked the scenes of Washington DC and New York shot in the 1920's, the drive across the George Washington Bridge (between NY and NJ) from the early 1930's, The Pennsylvania Railroad and Chrysler (Motor Rhythm) promos from the 1939 Worlds Fair, Doom Town, a short 3D documentary with actual 3D nuclear bomb test footage from the 1950's, 3D trailer from some great 1950's 3D movies, Boo Moon (Casper The Friendly Ghost), the animated Norman McLaren shorts, Sam Space, etc.  I could go on and on, this disc is an incredible collection from the golden age of 3D motion pictures.

As to the mastering, it is flawless.  I had previously seen some of these shorts projected at a film festival, and have to say that this blu-ray looks as good, and in some cases better, than the 35mm originals.",1428451200,54,1040,4.476190476190476
7090045,5,B00VGXABLI,"I had the opportunity recently to preview the final version of this ""3-D Rarities"" Blu-ray release.

The breadth of material is remarkable - ranging from shorts from the early 20's and going up to the animated Boo Moon, featuring Casper the Friendly Ghost. Some of these films have been shown at the 3-D Expos in California and Suffern, NY, but a lot of it is making its debut here. Having seen many of these on 35mm and earlier test video transfers I can say with absolute confidence that they have never looked better. Bob Furmanek and his technical director Greg Kintz has performed, literally, miracles with some of the faded and mis-aligned footage. With so much on-board I can only recount a few highlights, one being a terrific ""Pennsylvania Railroad"" promotional piece, another being the best-ever version of the stop-motion ""Motor Rhythm."" Unbelievably rare footage from pioneers Kelley, Crespinel, Norling and Leventhal, four Norman McLaren animated shorts from the National Film Board of Canada (presented in stereophonic sound), ""Sam Space,"" Marciano vs. Walcott title fight, trailers, ""Doom Town,"" burlesque, Slick Slaven, Beany & Cecil, etc. etc. An embarrassment of riches.

Nearly 2 1/2 hours long, this program is an essential addition to the collection of anyone interested in vintage 3-D films. Plus there's bonus material including audio commentary by Jack Theakston and Thad Komorowski on several shorts, ViewMaster reels, comics, and even footage directed by Francis Ford Coppola.

NOTE: Fans of 3-D ""Pop-Out"" should play portions of this disc every single time they fire up their systems: tons of off-screen effects are present. And almost all of it better than anything you'll see in a modern 3-D film.",1428278400,128,1726,5.201438848920863

7090076,5,B00VGXABLI,"3-D Rarities is a true historic treasure beautifully restored on blu-ray. As the owner of more than 135 blu ray 3-D movies this is now among my favorites. I watched the Marciano/Walcott fight and when Mariano knocked down Walcott I was surprised to see that Walcott was screwed on the 10 count. I confirmed this by watching the slow motion segment of the 10 count. You will easily see that the referee's count starts out with 1...then...2..and then 4...The referee never says 3. You can see the referee mouthing 1-2-4  as he performs the count.  Also, I find it very interesting that the narrator, Jimmy Powers verbally joins the referee count from the count of four. Why didn't the narrator start with the count of 1? Very strange. But that's not all. Watch the referee swing his arm down for each count. The referee does it only 9 times....NOT 10. It is hard to believe that this film was never used to prove Walcott's dispute. While I have no doubt that Marciano would have gone on to win the fight anyway, it is clear that Walcott was screwed on the count.
I wonder if anyone else who has purchased  3-D Rarities has noticed the bad Walcott count?",1454371200,4,1151,4.550724637681159

There is no documentary-style narration to explain the significance (if any) of each, thus you are just watching one clip after another. Some are a bit more interesting than others and there are some pop-out segments but all in all, for me it was a dud. I think hardcore film historians would probably like it but the replay factor for me was non-existent, therefore I sold my copy on Ebay.",1443571200,6,501,4.456521739130435

7090096,4,B00VGXABLI,Some of the color experimentation segments ran a little long but overall this was a lot of fun. The train sequence and the Casper were a lot of fun. A lot of work obviously went into putting this history together. I would have liked more trailers from the 50's films instead of colors flashing around on the screen. Is it worth the money? Yes,1441929600,5,342,4.359375
7090097,4,B00VGXABLI,"It is amazing and an interesting history lesson. 3D is around for a long time and it is just fun to see old images of New York and Washington. I liked the stop motion animation and a nice 3D episode of Casper the friendly ghost. For those who want to know or this is worth the money. If you expect something like a 3D Transformer film from Michael Bay, then stay away. If you are on the other hand interested in 3D and its history, then this is something for you.
Also it's not the most perfect 3D. Some films were just safed in time, so there are some ghosting issues. The booklet inside is informative and gives all the necessary information. There is one thing I really hate though, It's not fair to have a few very nice 3D trailers included without the films. Now I really want to see these films and of course the're not available anywhere ! Maybe another project for the 3D film archives ;-)

With over 2 and a half hours of content here, some of which dates back to 1922, there really is something here for everyone.

Viewing the scenes of New York shot in the 1920's and witnessing in the best possible stereoscopic 3D setup of today is truly a shining example of old meets new.

The menu is well laid out and easy to navigate, with the ability to choose your favorite segments from the selection.

I have to admit I was pretty surprised at how convincing the 3-D effect was on many of these videos with how long ago they were produced, but I suppose that is also a testament as to how great of a restoration job they have done on this.
Very impressive work indeed.

The bonus photo galleries also look amazing. The 3-D Comic Books were very entertaining. I only wish there were more of them to view.

My favorite videos on this collection have to be Boo Moon (Casper) and Sam Space, as I am a sucker for good old fashioned animation, in both the hand drawn form as well as the 'stop motion' types.

Perhaps they will release another collection along the lines of this one some day. We can all hope.

So if you are interested in where 3-D technology all started and want to see some great examples of ""pop-out 3D"" I suggest you grab a copy today!",1441238400,3,1348,4.304347826086956

It is interesting to know when 3-D first started and to actually look back to 1926 and see tidbits of historic landmarks, cars, trains and the way people dressed. Back then, they actually used the technology to show the audience how things appeared to jump out at you and believe these objects were touchable. With all the computer graphics we have today, they just don't seem to get the same results. Today's 3-D movies are more like looking out a window. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't trade in my TV for anything except a bigger 3-D TV. When watching the new 3-D movies, you get an excellence sense of depth. I love it. The best short sequence that shows objects that look very close is from Despicable Me 2. The Minions are blowing bubbles and you really believe you can touch them.

And other various types of things like 3d trailers and informational type of films and weird cartoons that are figures and flowers that move around in 3d.  SO basically this is a interesting disc filled with many rarities.  NOW, some people want to watch a movie only and will not  enjoy such a effort.  However  I found this to be entertaining and a welcome addition to my 3d blu ray collection.  The cartoon alone would have cost you many thousands of dollars to own a copy of , in order to watch it in 3d.  The rest of this is worth checking out because of it's time capsule effect for sure. This does have a cool 3d puppet show in it though , but most of this is NOT short films made for entertainment purposes.  That being said , it's a important disc that preserves and allows us to see rare 3d efforts of the past.  I would say that the price is very high on this one.  But it's worth it for any 3d collector to own this.  Casual 3d fans might find this boring mainly but I didn't.  However GOG and the MASK (1961) are coming out on 3d blu ray this year.  2015.  So make sure you grab those and other great vintage 3d tiles like 'man in the dark' , 'dragonfly squadron' ,  ""the bubble'  , ""inferno',  'kiss me kate' ,  'house of wax' , 'creature from the black lagoon' and 'dial m for murder' for more great 3d experiences.",1440115200,2,1449,4.169675090252707

The Casper cartoon was pathetic and even worse were the Canadian BC entries 3 long twisting fine sequences,,,3d for sure but to what avail. The reviews of this new release were ecstatic and called it must have,,,,what a joke,,,I am so sorry I put out nearly 40 bucks for this loser and hope to warn off other would be victims. Lately there has been a trend of not introducing the 3d versions of some titles so I got a non regional 3d player reasonably priced from Amazon and get 3d from Germany and the UK.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: These early films were exhibited using the red and green process but the preservationists involved in restoring these films have converted them to the modern polarized process with some astonishing results. We see a travelogue of Washington DC and New York City with some amazing depth, followed by some gag footage that uses the process to its fullest bringing various objects off the screen and into your face. Audiences at the 1939 New York Worlds Fair were the first to see the new polarized 3-D process, similar to the modern 3-D we have today, and the disk features the second polarized 3-D film, Thrills for You [1940], a promotional film from the Pennsylvania Railroad documenting the wonders of traveling by train. This is followed by a Chrysler promotional film, New Dimensions, which features a stop-motion look at building a car with many objects hitting you in the face.

It has taken over 30 years for the 3-D Film Archive to assemble and restore the material in 3-D Rarities; all films have been stunningly restored and mastered direct from archival materials by 3-D Film Archive Technical Director Greg Kintz. Meticulously aligned shot-by-shot for precise registration of the original left and right elements, these historic 3-D motion pictures have never looked this good. 3-D Rarities is the demonstration disc that belongs in the collection of every aficionado of 3-D films. The 3-D effects in this collection put most modern efforts at 3-D to shame. Bob Furmanek, Greg Kintz, Jack Theakston, and the late Dan Symmes have restored these short films to the point that they almost certainly look better than they ever have in the past. The 3-D Rarities has a varied collection of films divided into 2 main categories:

Part 1: The Dawn of Stereoscopic Cinematography

Kelley's Plasticon Pictures [1922/1923] [7:47] This footage includes Thru The Trees  Washington, D.C. which features footage of Washington, Arlington Cemetery, and West Point in the 1920s and has what may be the only existing film footage of Civil War veterans attending a memorial. Then there is Thru the Trees where we have footage, particularly of lives up to its name as the shots are excellently composed to create the illusion to make you feel that ""you are there."" Though it is very old, some of the effects are just wonderful in their use of depth of field.

William T. Crespine l / Jaco Leventhal Tests [1924-1927] [5:44] Most of the photographed footage includes some great money shots like a man pointing a gun, a witch throwing acid, and a Nathan's hot dog on the end of a long stick. It also delivers a range of activities that break through the fourth wall, including a baseball game, a parade and even a Charlie Chaplin imitator.

John Norling / Jacob Leventhal Tests [1935] [3:25] This footage includes Riverside Drive as it enters the George Washington Bridge, the Thunderbolt rollercoaster on Coney Island, and baseball players pitching and sliding towards the camera. This demo gags get a bit more involved, but some things don't change, as more baseball players sends the ball right at the audience.

Thrills for You [1940] [8:26] This film was produced by the Pennsylvania Railroad and promotes the luxury features of its train cars for travellers in the 1940s. It also shows off a luxury train of the era quite well, including a striking look at the manufacturing process, which has good quality 3-D effects.

New Dimensions [1940] [9:08] This film was produced for the New York World's Fair by the Chrysler Motors in 1940 and is a Technicolor remake of Chrysler's 1939 black and white 3-D film In Tune With Tomorrow. The film shows the assembly of a luxury Plymouth sedan with stop-motion animation and it is brilliant animation. It is a remarkably innovative and surprisingly entertaining stop motion short from Chrysler and one of many dawning shorts filmed and released at the outbreak of the Second World War.

Now is the Time [1951] [3:13] Animator pioneer Norman McLaren produced this film for the National Film Board of Canada and you can now see Norman McLaren's work afresh in this stunning new print. Originally commissioned for the 1951 Festival of Britain, Norman McLaren created stereoscopic films in approximately five weeks, the like of which had not been seen before. Now experience the ground-breaking work of Norman McLaren in a new dimension. This is a very well-made 3-D, which also lends itself to 3-D very well.

Around is Around [1951] [7:28] This is an early abstract animated short 3-D film by animation master by Norman McLaren demonstrates some of the best spherical use of 3-D that may ever be seen. Presented in a new restoration of this 1951 short, which the first stereoscopic animated film ever made, in using a cathode-ray oscilloscope to create an incredible 3-D effect, especially with waveforms and made something even more surreal, but which works just as well as 3-D eye candy.

O Canada [1952] [1:32] Take a 3-D trip across Canada with this animated interpretation of a National Film Board of Canada presentation anthem that takes a 3-D trip across the country from coast to coast by Norman McLaren with the national anthem played over animation representing the character of Canada from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. It is a technique later adapted to create the star-gate sequence in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, but it is a very well-made 3-D film and shows off the love for Canada.

Twirligig [1952] [3:35] This early abstract 3-D stereoscopic animation was hand-drawn by Gretta Ekman, a disciple of Norman McLaren's. Offering beautiful, if not bizarre subjects, to create something equally unusual, artistic and it combines the techniques used in the previous three films, to create something equally unusual and artistic.

Bolex Stereo [1952] [10:32] This fascinating promotional film was produced by Bolex Cameras to promote its 16mm 3-D film camera. The film is a travelogue that includes footage from Hawaii. This was slightly the weakest short for me was actually the Bolex Stereo promo. It was a very an Interesting addition to the set, not least for the aspect ratio, but the 3-D itself was not particularly deep and I presume that is was filmed with the home cine camera which they were advertising. It's a product of its time without a doubt, and has great 3-D effects and a look at times long gone.

Part 2: Hollywood Enters the Third Dimension

M.L. Gunzburg Presents Natural Vision Three-Dimension [1952] [5:23] This short features ""3D Beany and Cecil"" which is the American Television classic childrens characters in 3D and are the reason to check this out, as it brilliant 3-D. You also get to meet Miss Third Dimension, and pretty women were a must in the early days of 3-D. Lloyd Nolan Peyton Place and Shirley Tegge, Miss U.S.A. of 1949, preceded Bwana Devil during its theatrical release. We hear about the health benefits of the Natural Vision 3-D process.

Original Trailer: It Came From Outer Space [1953] [3:39] This was the first ever trailer produced in 3-D to promote the actual 3-D feature film.

Rocky Marciano vs. Jersey Joe Walcott [1953] [16:36] This is the first and only 3-D newsreel and feature the Heavyweight Championship match at Chicago Stadium from 15th May, 1953. This was really interesting to view, especially with the slow motion look at the knockout punch by Rocky Marciano, that made Jersey Joe Walcott lose the boxing match. The fight itself is tremendously short, the film deals gets a brilliant 3-D presentation of a sporting event is very intriguing.

Original Trailer: Hannah Lee [1953] [2:07] Approximately 18 seconds of this trailer is presented flat due to some stereo footage remaining lost, but the real enjoyment is in the awkward delivery of star John Ireland as he attempts to sell the film by directly addressing the audience.

Stardust In Your Eyes [1953] [6:10] Stand-up comic Slick Slavin [aka Trustin Howard] presents his impressions of various Hollywood personalities including James Cagney, Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, Peter Lorre and Humphrey Bogart, in this short film produced by Phil Tucker and was originally shot to accompany the 3-D feature Robot Monster.

Original Trailer: The Maze [1953] [2:16] Richard Carlson introduces The Maze to theatrical patrons in this trailer was shot by director William Cameron Menzies. The beginning of this trailer, which has some of the best 3D effects of the entire disc, gives way to very traditional horror filmmaking, and makes the kind of film you want to see.

Doom Town [1953] [15:25] This short documentary features an atomic bomb test in Nevada features some brief footage of Las Vegas and was an anti-nuclear test documentary and the first documentary to be shot in 3-D, is excellent. This short premiered in Los Angeles on 2nd July, 1953, with College Capers and The Maze before disappearing from distribution for decades before recovery of the original negatives by Bob Furmanek in the 1980s. Even so, seeing an atomic bomb in 3-D colour is something to behold and totally spectacular.

The Adventures of Sam Space [1960] [9:13] Two boys, Chuck and Sam find a time capsule in a cave and take it to Professor Seateck. The professor finds that the capsule contains a message that had been sent to the planet Meeca whose inhabitants helped Earth in its defense against attacks by the Space Islands in 1960. Sam, Chuck, and the Professor travel to Meeca with the Meecan robot Robo. They are attacked by the Space Islands en route, but arrive safely to meet with the friendly Meecans. This short was produced originally in 1953 in the style of George Pal's Puppetoons by Paul G. Sprunck, a writer/director who had worked on the Puppetoons. Though obviously aimed at kids, it might be a little too much for some. As a piece of animation history, it's just fun, with 3-D work that gives you the image and a good depth of 3-D.

I'll Sell My Shirt [1953] [9:54] Another oddity from 1953, Ill Sell My Shirt features the so called comedy team of George Beetlepuss Lewis and Charlie Crafts in a burlesque film featuring a swinging (literally) stripper and an uncomfortable bit of the two men doing all they can to get another woman undressed. Its actually one of the rarest of all 3-D films and certainly appeals to an audience of its time. Feminists today will be horrified, but it is an interesting curio nonetheless. This burlesque film produced by distributor Dan Sonney features Dorothy Burke on a swing and comedians George ""Beatlepuss"" Lewis and Charlie Crafts. I thought this was very unfunny, with two men who are misogynous dinosaurs who would not be allowed to be filmed in the 21st Century and a complete waste of film.

Original Trailer: Miss Sadie Thompson [1953] [3:00] This trailer is zoomed in to 1.66:1 from the original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. This was really great to see this, such a shame they cannot release the whole film in 3-D and I suspect the original 3-D film has been lost forever or the negative is damage beyond repair. Rita Hayworth in 3-D seems like a pretty solid business plan, and to cast her in a classic story adapted from a W. Somerset Maugham tale was a pretty smart move. This trailer capitalises on her attractiveness and the more sordid elements of the plot, and though the 3-D isn't mind-blowing, it's 3-D that is worth viewing and gives you another perspective on Rita Hayworth.

Boo Moon [1953] [7:33] Boo Moon is a theatrical cartoon short released in 1954 in 3D format as a Stereotoon and it was produced by the Famous Studios for the Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoon series and distributed by Paramount Pictures. Casper emerges from a subway station, following a crowd of scared strangers. He encounters a man saying ""see the wonders of the moon for ten cents,"" and offering a sight through a telescope. Casper scares the man away, and then uses the telescope to see the moon. He then flies to the moon for a visit. Casper lands on the moon, disappointed to find no man on the moon. He lies down to nap, then tiny moon men emerge from holes. They capture Casper, like Lilliputians did to Gulliver, and then place him in a cage on wheels, in which they tow him to the Ruler of the Moon, King Luna. The King addresses Casper as a monster, and treats him as an enemy. Casper playfully picks up King Luna, and the king has him placed in the royal dungeon. A dejected Casper is imprisoned. Then animated trees attack the city of the moon men. The moon men defend their fortified city with flaming missiles. The tree monsters fight back with water, and then breaks through the town walls. When the fight seems lost to the tree monsters, Casper escapes his cage, and helps the moon men. Casper goes underground. The friendly ghost then pulls trees' parts through the moon surface and ties them together, immobilising the trees. The frustrated trees writhe and strain against the knots Casper has tied. Casper and the moon men have won. Then, and only then, does King Luna embrace Casper as a friend. King Luna knights Casper for the valiant defence of his people. Then all the moon men join in singing the Casper theme song. This Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoon short is presented in 3-D in its original theatrical widescreen aspect ratio. This short has been shown for years on American Television in a pan and scan version with the left and right sides chopped off the screen images. The 3-D imagery and restoration are totally awesome and is really excellent and spectacular; and such a shame there is not more of these fantastic 3-D Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoon shorts. The 3-D cartoon is a totally vibrant animation, which takes advantage of Casper's translucent look to achieve some great fun 3-D effects. Voice Cast: Cecil Roy (Casper), Jackson Beck (King Luna/Moon People), Jack Mercer (Moon People) and Allen Swift (Lookout characters). Directors: Izzy Sparber and Seymour Kneitel. Composer: Winston Sharples. Animators: Gordon Whittier, Larry Silverman, Myron Waldman and Nick Tafuri.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The shorts are presented in a form of good to really excellent 1080p encoded image. The video presentation is really excellent and the Black-and-White footage, particularly in the 1920s, has very good grey scale with solid blacks and fine contrast. As we move into the Technicolor era in the 1940s, colours are rich and vivid with far less in the way of visible print damage than we have any right to expect. The occasional scratch or fibre are visible in the aperture is the exception rather than the norm. The 1920s footage looks terrific with the only major flaw being some fading noticeable between the left and right views. The Casper short, Boo Moon, with its vibrant colours and pristine images, actually looks better than many 1080p encoded image transfers of animated shorts being released from other larger studios. The video presentation is not perfect, but very nearly so. Enough cannot be said about the sublime quality of the 3-D presentation in this release. Alignment issues have been corrected for this release, and other than a few isolated instances where flaws in convergence have been baked into the prints, the 3-D presentation approaches perfection. There is occasional ghosting images was minimal to non-existent when viewed on my active display. This is a definitely a Blu-ray reference quality 3-D presentation. Please Note: The films can also be viewed in 2-D for those without a 3-D TV curious about these historic films, but will miss out on something totally spectacular in 3-D.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The audio is presented in a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound is really excellent for what it is, since directional audio between the 1920s and 1953 was fairly non-existent in film. The audio has greater dynamic range than we have any right to expect, and there is none of the hiss or popping that is often perceptible in releases from this era. Dialogue and music are blended really consistently well for a very fine audio mix.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Kelley's Plasticon Pictures [1922/1923] [7:47] Commentary by Jack Theakston: Here we get a nice Hi from Jack Theaksto and here he tells us that we are watching the oldest surviving American 3-D film in StereoScopic. The Kelly of Kellys Plasticon Pictures is William Van Dorin Kelley, a colour film pioneer and invented in 1913 by William Van Doren Kelley and Charles Raleigh, whose company Prizma Incorporated was responsible for the production of short 3-D films. This particular 3-D short was rediscovered by the 3-D Film Archive in February 2006 and luckily they were able to preserve the film in the nick of time, because the original nitrate film began to degrade very badly. Here Jack Theakston explains in great detail of the technical information on the Prizma colour film process and the problems they encountered. On the 27th December 1942 K William Van Doren Kelley exhibited a 3-D short entitled Movies of the Future at the Rialto Theater in New York City. William Van Doren Kelley would certainly have been aware at the time, of the coming of a number of 3-D films, including a September 1922 screening of the first American 3-D feature The Power of Love, shown in Los Angeles and also inventor Lawrence Hammonds Teleview system, which would premiere 5 days after Movies of the Future at the Selwyn Theater in New York. Many of William Van Doren Kelleys 3-D films had their first booking at the Rialto Theater or the Rivoli Theatre in New York, as to the 3-D short Thru The Trees  Washington, D.C. was never shown to a paying audience, but instead was shown to a Technical Convention in Swampscott in Massachusetts on 27th June 1923 and at the Society of Motion Picture Engineers meeting in October 1923 and both 3-D film demonstration was done by William Van Doren Kelley himself, personally. At these meetings, William Van Doren Kelley explained in great detail of the technical features of filming in his Prizma 3-D format. When the 3-D short was discovered by accident, it was sent to the YCM Laboratory in Burbank in California and Richard Dayton first cleaned up the nitrate negative for damage, but sadly such degrading cannot be stopped or reversed, it can only be slowed down, so preserving this 3-D short was very important, Richard Dayton also repaired the splices and the perforation damage, permitting this delicate print go through an optical printer and then first made a new negative and then attempted colour separation, in order to get discrete left and right images. The final shots seem to have been taken around Coney Island area and the train shot is unknown, but was probably in the New York City area or Brooklyn. The girl on the swing of course is always used in 3-D film shorts or demonstration reels, and it is not a 3-D short without the obligatory roller coaster ride. So ends a very interesting first of three in total audio commentaries and Jack Theakston is a very knowledgeable expert of all aspects of this 3-D short and is well worth a view with this audio commentary.

Audio Commentary: William T. Crespine l / Jaco Leventhal Tests [1924-1927] [5:44] Commentary by Jack Theakston: Once again we get a nice Hi from Jack Theakston and again informs us that we are watching a 3-D Demonstration Reel, that was either filmed by William T. Crespine l or Jaco Leventhal or both of them, he is not sure, as there was not much historic information on the 3-D test reel. As a precursor to the previous 3-D test reel, this one is a 1923 3-D demonstration Test Reel and was shown in the Roxy Theater and was totally rejected for not having enough off screen activity effects. But in 1925 Path took up the baton for 3-D films and designated it as StereoScope films and carried on until 1926. We then move on to the WestPoint Academy shot, which was filmed in 1925 and obviously had more off-the-screen filmed activity and the convergence image was way off and the restoration credits must go to Dan Sims and the wonderful 20/20 3-D film restoration process. The old hag we see on the screen is from 1926 and as will observe there is a black ring in front of the 3-D lenses, well Jack Theakston reckons it was used to inform the person in front of the camera where to aim their finger for the 3-D effect. The next shot is of the horrible gross hand with the long black nails, and Jack Theakston thinks it is the worst 3-D effect ever and I agree, as you get a lot of ghosting images. The boy with the slingshot was filmed in 1926 and again notes the black ring in front of the camera lens. Next up is the cannon shot and again was filmed in 1926 and you get to see some amusing animation at the end and the convergence was also way off to. Next up is the man who is a photographer and again was filmed in 1926 and Jack Theakston informs us that the guy behind the camera, who makes the lens comes towards us, is a gag they used many times to demonstrate the 3-D effect. Next up is the man with the sword and was filmed in 1925 and seems to have been copied from the Path Stereo Cards. Next up is the man in the costume with a gun and was filmed in 1927 and again was based on the Path Stereo Cards of 1925. Next up is one of Jack Theakstons favourite 3-D test film and also the weirdest, which was filmed in 1926 and it is of the animation of the Chinese puppet men who chops of a mans head. Next up is a man with a bow and arrow, which was filmed in 1926. The Chaplin impersonator was filmed in 1927 and again was based on the Path Stereo Cards system. And so ends another audio commentary by Jack Theakston of this particular 3-D Test Demonstration reel, was okay, but he was not very forthcoming with the technical know-how on the 3-D process, especially what we heard in the previous 3-D Demonstration Test reel. But despite this, so do give it a whirl, as it makes watching this 3-D Demonstration so much more interesting, than watching it without the audio commentary.

Audio Commentary: Boo Moon [1953] [7:33] Commentary by Thad Komorowski: Here we are personally introduced by Thad Komorowski and says a big Hi and Thad Komorowski informs us about the Casper the Friendly Ghost and the Paramount Pictures Cartoon entitled Boo Moon, which was brought out in 1953 just as the craze for 3-D was going out of fashion. But Thad feels this Stereotoon were wonderful and were even more spectacular 3-D effects that paramount Pictures were good at, but this particular 3-D animation was very expensive to make and it shows how Paramount Pictures loved these cartoons and especially in 3-D and I personally think this Casper the Friendly Ghost 3-D cartoon is stunning and we are told that at the time, the typical cost of this 3-D animation was around $30,000 and eventually they made two 3-D cartoons at a cost of $70,000 and even if the 3-D craze had lasted, the cost would have been totally prohibitive, especially at the time they made the two 3-D cartoons, which is a shame. But something Thad Komorowski points out and something I noticed, is that the King on the moon, is the same one that was in the Max Fleischer Gullivers Travel cartoon, and was done by the same cartoonist. Thad Komorowski also praised the 3-D animation and especially the brilliant Technicolor images, that seem to burst out of the screen, but originally only saw this Casper the Friendly Ghost with a faded print on American TV, but now seeing it for the first time on this Blu-ray disc, he cannot rave enough over it and I second it, as the colours are spectacular. Thad also tells us that why Casper the Friendly Ghost was so successful, especially with children is because the style is timeless and still today children love these special cartoons, because a lot of thought went into making these Casper cartoons. So ends another nice audio commentary and is well worth a listen.

The Bellboy and the Playgirls [1962] [18:00] This 3-D footage sample was an American-German 1962 film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who wrote and produced this approximately 18 minutes of footage this film and it features June Wilkinson and Don Kenney. The actual film was released with the tagline: June is busting our all over! In COLOR plus the new depth perception . . . it puts a girl in your lap! Showing impressive depth of impressive cleavage and it's also notable for being edited by arguably the greatest exploitation American film director Jack Hill.

3-D Photo Galleries:

The Hunchback of Notre Dame [1923] Producer Carl Laemmle used CameraScope to create 3-D stills to promote the feature starring Lon Chaney, and these stills are presented here in 3-D and what a shame the actual film could have been shot in 3-D as it would of looked spectacular.

New York World's Fair [1939] The 3-D View-Master stills produced for the World's Fair are presented here with spectacular results. I use to own a View-Master and at the time I thought it was spectacular and wished films were in the same stunning 3-D images and these images brought all the magic back. With the 15 pictures from the 1939 World's Fair in New York are more effective in terms of the 3-D on the title side with a moody piece of art-deco design, than the sculptures and exhibits they depict on half of each frame, but they are well worth a look.

Adventures of Sam Sawyer [1950] The two 3-D View-Master images are presented on the right side of the screen with the text narrative presented on the left. The frames advance periodically without the necessity of using the arrows on your remote control, but readers of the text narrative may wish to press pause occasionally before advancing to the next frame. Again the 3-D images are truly spectacular.

3-D Comic Books: This demonstrates how the 3-D Film Archive can transfer anaglyphic 3-D comic books from the 1950s and since into amazing awesome 1080p quality 3-D and is a stunning presentation and the 3-D images look far superior, than when you actually look at the actual 3-D Comic Books, which includes Mighty Mouse, Tor, Captain 3D and the Three Stooges, as well as a selection of ads, Blinkies (which shows a different image to each eye) and a parody of the concept of 3D. As someone who was always disappointed with 3-D comic books and it is really great to see it done in a proper way here in a very professional way and again they look totally spectacular.

BONUS: The beautiful stunning lushly illustrated 24 page booklet with Introductions by Leonard Maltin and Trustin Howard [aka Slick Slavin]. Plus essays by Julian Antos, Hillary Hess, Thad Komorowski, Donald McWilliams, Ted Okuda, Mary Ann Sell and Jack Theakston. Its a really great companion with this stunning 3-D Blu-ray presentation.

Finally, this is definitely reference quality 3-D on a disc that you are likely to watch many times and I can tell you it is that good. The video and audio presentations are consistently excellent on these short films. I hope that 3-D Rarities enjoys the success that it deserves, and that the film studios that are sitting on top of unreleased 3-D films from the Golden Age of 3-D and please take notice of this release and let those films out of their vaults. I hope that we see the release of Volume 2 of 3-D Rarities some day in the very near future. 3-D Rarities is a must-have triumph for any 3-D Blu-ray Collectors Library. Very Highly Recommended!

7090133,2,B00VGXABLI,"I've been fascinated in anything 3D for over 40 years. So I gladly bought this disk to add to my collection. There was quite a bit of promotion hype before its release, so I had built up some expectations. After watching it all, I would say that only about 20 minutes of the video content is worth viewing again in the future. This disk is mainly collection of 3D video trailers and promotional material with the exception of few mini movies that are interesting to watch. So unfortunately (IMHO) the price is too high for that compilation (although I can imagine that a massive amount of work was contributed to get all that video material restored so perfectly).",1436313600,3,664,4.635593220338983
7090134,5,B00VGXABLI,"As I post this review, there are 55 other reviews posted here, nearly all from customers who own 3-D TVs and 3-D Bluray players. Well, I have neither and I came to this product because of two reasons:
1) Flicker Alley has never released a BD package that I didn't find high quality  and loaded with films that I'd never know about. I know they work with French archives often but this time it's the 3D Film Archive
2) I'm a big Stan Freberg fan and there is so little footage of the ""Time for Beany"" show that, when I heard there was some included (It comes right after ""Intermission""), I was hooked.

I love that fact that the 2  hours - comprised of 22 ""ultra rare"" films runs the gamut from 1922 to the early 1960s. These were mostly ""industrial"" films produced to advertise a product or service (Chrysler and the Pennsylvania Railroad for instance.) but they had entertainment value too.  And the quality of these prints is great.

Even on my 2-D 42inch TV set I can tell when a special effect is there - either something (or someone) heading to the foreground or riding a roller coaster (that was big deal in Cinerama films too - and Flicker Alley has released three (I think) volumes of that genre.

The 24-page booklet provides some background and there are some commentary tracks. Flicker Alley has used the high capacity of a Bluray disc to include a bunch of View Master slides - though they don't really look that different in 2-D.

So, yes, if you own the proper equipment to see this in 3-D, this volume is essential. But, if you have an interest in film history - and, like me, only have a 2-D television, I think you'll still enjoy watching this set.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7090135,5,B00VGXABLI,"I saw this yesterday. This is such a treat that I've got tears in my eyes and not from eyestrain.  It was just beautiful!!
The way this is presented reminds me of the days when you could go to the special theaters featuring Cinerama.  In fact, the major cities might want to think about assigning a special 3D theater.  This has been showing at MOMA to completely sold out show over the past week or so.  I have to say that just watching the disc is AN EVENT.
Since I don't have a set up yet, I had to watch it at someone else's house.  I am now watching it again in 2D and it still plays like it's 3D in my head somehow.  I have been listening to it with headphones and the audio alone is incredible.  It is so crisp and clean all the way through.  I didn't notice any changes in the volume and the choice of the music for the silent era footage was just perfect.  As I listened, I got a feeling for each decade that was being represented on screen.  The privilege of hearing the stereo in the IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE trailer is just one reason to be thankful for this set.
If you don't have a 3D set up, you can still enjoy this and purchasing  a copy is like money in the bank for when you do get one.  My 3D TV fund has been started!
To everyone involved in this release, congrats and THANK YOU ALL SOOOOO MUCH!",1436140800,5,1316,4.038610038610039
7090136,5,B00VGXABLI,"This disk is amazing quality, every frame has been lovingly restored. The 1920's footage blew me away, both in the excellent depth compositions but also in an excellent restoration job of such vintage footage. Everything is so unique and special, and perfectly presented. I have a collection of 3D comic books, but they never looked as good as they do on the bonus section of this disk (I just wish they were more complete, most just have a page or two).  As an animator and animation fan I especially appreciated the early stereoscopic work of the brilliant Norman McLaren for the National Film Board of Canada.  And it's also good to have the Casper cartoon Boo Moon the only classic cartoon available anywhere. This is a great showpiece to show off your 3D system to friends. Buy it, you won't regret it. Hopefully there will be more volumes.",1436054400,5,845,4.702702702702703
7090137,5,B00VGXABLI,"""3-D Rarities"" is a wonderful collection of short films and other rarities dating from the 1920s through the 1950s.  Whether you're a fan of old school 3D, classic movies, Hollywood nostalgia, this disc features an amazing wealth of 3D content presented in perfect quality.

Though there's something here for everyone, my favorite bits ended up being the Norman McLaren shorts (entitled ""Now is the Time,"" ""Around is Around,"" ""O Canada"" and ""Twirligig"") - think of the more abstract segments in the original ""Fantasia,"" but in 3D.  They are a delight from start to finish.

The newsreel and documentary shorts are equally compelling - whether it's the stop-motion animated demonstration of how a car is built from ""New Dimensions,"" or the ""Thrills For You"" short documenting the Pennsylvania Railroad, or the horrors of atomic testing as seen in ""Doom Town,"" each of the non-fiction pieces presents a window into the past that makes this essential viewing for any history fans.

Love trailers?  This release has a few 3D trailers for some 1950s films like ""It Came From Outer Space"" and ""The Maze"".  Love cartoons?  You can't beat ""Boo Moon"" with Casper the Friendly Ghost, or ""The Adventures of Sam Space"" which has the wonderful naivety of a classic Gumby along with some of the wit and charm of a newer ""Wallace And Gromit"" cartoon.  There are also a series of camera tests and early true life footage from the 1920s, including some amazing views of Washington DC.

The technical quality of this disc is outstanding.  Each of the shorts has been lovingly restored, with perfect 3D alignment.  No ghosting or eyestrain here.  The type of 3D varies from short to short; some are all about the depth, others have a ton of pop-out, but regardless of the shooting style, each is gripping in its own way.  The disc comes packaged with a wonderfully detailed booklet with information about each and every short contained within that places the films in their proper historical context.

I give this disc my highest recommendation.  Hopefully there will be a Volume 2 someday!",1436054400,4,2071,4.92507204610951

I had to watch it twice. By buying this, you encourage 3-D Film Archive to ""save"" those great 3-D movies of the 50's,most of us missed. A restored
print means that the old  Red-Green style 3-D is now up converted to modern 3-D like we see with glasses at home and in theaters.

Also, I'm hoping that Flicker Alley will release the great old 50's 3-D movies in double-feature editions,that include a cartoon.

Too many people just assume that 3-D was a flash-in-the-pan fad from the 1950s.  By watching these films, you can appreciate that this technology has been around since the 1920s.  The quality varies from short to short, but overall the 3-D effect is present and you can understand why it wowed audiences for 90 years.

There were a few shorts that I would not have included since their release did not particularly enhance the 3-D technology.

Much time and caring was devoted to bringing this material to the best condition possible.  This is a MUST for 3-D fans.  And to those not into 3-D that much, it illustrates why there is such a ho-hum attitude to today's 3-D movies which pale in comparison to what was being done so many years ago with such ""primitive"" technology.  They had it right long ago ----- post production 3-D? Bullpoopie!  Try using the same thing built into our heads ----- a two eyed 3-D camera!  Hopefully this will help to get the major studios of their butts and restore and release their multitude of 3-D catalog titles.  50 titles (of which 48 still exist) from the early '50's alone!",1435622400,4,762,4.634328358208955
7090145,5,B00VGXABLI,"The quality of the disk is excellent and the 3-D convergence is tops. Anaglyph to Polarized is wonderful on the anaglyph movies and comic book samples.
Some of the twenties scenes seem as though they were layered: Washington DC footage keeps trees in the foreground and buildings in the background which gives the 3-D effect but I sense roundness may be missing. I wonder if this is due to how far apart the lenses were and why NaturalVision went to such great lengths on their camera system design (which is pictured) to put the lenses together as the eyes see.
The Technicolor Chrysler 1940 Worlds Fair short NEW DIMENSIONS is a full-scale stop motion animation of the making of a Plymouth and is an achievement taking many weeks to film.
Lloyd Nolans historic introduction to BWANA DEVIL is choice.
The Bolex 3-D DEMO Short is outstandingly interesting and the quality is a surprise.
IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE Preview is fascinating 3-D, being the first preview shot in 3-D for a 3-D movie.
THE MAZE is a good 3-D Preview
HANNAH LEE is a lesser preview that is part missing some of the 2nd view (18 seconds), a theatrical flop with tennis match law suits following.
SADIE THOMPSON Preview like the film shows off good 3-D but is a bit red in the complexion of Rita.
The complete Casper Cartoon is a great example of a 3-D cartoon but 3-D cant save the oft repeated Casper story.
Historical coverage is represented well by two shorts
THE ROCKY MARCIANO VS JOE WOLCOTT FIGHT (shot with multiple angles)
DOOM TOWN (Anti-Atomic bomb testing in Nevada short that quickly disappeared from the public eye-not politically correct, perhaps!)
The low note of the disc is ILL SELL MY SHIRT- low not for 3-D but for content. If it weren't 3-D it would be just as well that it hadnt been seen for 60 years and hadnt been saved from vinegar and shrinkage but it does point out how 3-D was used to exploit Women and Sex.

All in all this disk, though expensive, is a veritable delightful sampling of three D history.

Time to get out the $1100 Bolex system and raise another $1100 to shoot a roll of film in 3-D. But I guess it would be less expensive to get a second GoPro and their 3-D housing and shoot in 4K 3-D.
Alas! Cut to the scene from THE BIRTH OF A NATION and Lillian Gishs admiring soldier leaning on his rifle.

7090147,2,B00VGXABLI,"I was ready to turn ""3D Rarities"" off after the first 20 minutes. But I managed to endure the full 2 1/2 hours so I could give an honest review.
The effort put into this endeavor is appreciated. It took much time and patience and expertise to gather all these snippets and short subjects together. Some of them are quite fascinating to watch, especially some of the 3D demos from past exhibitions. Unfortunately, watching them all, one after another gets to be boring. The best segment was a short clip of an actual baseball game. Honorable mention goes to the movie trailers. The worst segments were two animated shorts, consisting only of drawn figures changing shapes and colors that went on and on and on. The 3D in these weren't very effective either.
The extras are a waste. There's a short clip from a soft core porn flick from the 1960's directed by Francis Ford Coppola that added nothing to the value of this disc. It's kept family friendly. No nudity, just cleavage. The only reason for its inclusion is the notoriety of the director. The other extras consist of 3D still shots and pages from 3D comic books.
The lack of any story or documentary-type spoken commentary made viewing this tedious and, frankly, uninteresting. ""3D Rarities"" might be used to demonstrate for friends one's 3D HDTV, but be ready to use your fast-forward button a lot. There's maybe 20-30 minutes at most throughout the entire disc that is worth an occasional repeat viewing.",1435622400,8,1463,4.7637795275590555
7090148,5,B00VGXABLI,"I've now viewed 3D Rarities and found it absolutely fascinating. Being a film buff it was great to see the trailers for ""It Came From Outer Space"" and ""The Maze"" and hoping the owners of these films get their act together for 3D versions. All the other shorts etc were certainly rare with the early mid 20s films just as impressive as anything done today. As a matter of fact their experiments for sticking things directly into the camera lens showed how I felt when I got my first Bolex Zoom Standard 8mm (but not stereo) in the late 1960s. I still have the camera in my home museum of cameras and projectors no longer used! Back to 3DR. The car putting together sequence was enjoyable with it's Puppetoon style of animation and must have taken a heck of a time, and with no video assist. ""Doom Town"" was fascinating. Couldn't get over the fact that the people seemed to be so close to the explosion or at least shown that way. Maybe it said more for what was not shown! All in all a fascinating glimpse into past and a great restoration work by the 3DArchive Team.

7090151,5,B00VGXABLI,"It's highly entertaining and exhilarating to watch the evolution of 3-D over decades. Part one of the disk is especially interesting and one can really sense the excitement the early innovators felt about 3-D.

It's a shame that, despite the fact we still have films being released in 3-D, few studios attempt to do anything interesting with the format. Inside Out is the latest example of a 3-D opportunity squandered.",1435363200,6,419,4.985714285714286

Viewing both parts while playing the ""Audio Commentary by Jack Theakston"" is extraordinarily fascinating making the 3D experience feel like a special celebration.  The restorative alignment to the 3D venue, visually corrected by Greg Kintz, is so well done that even when viewed as discrete-3D from a head-mounted-display it produces the most pronounced visual depth and out-of-screen pop-out I have experienced from a 3D movie source.",1435276800,7,565,5.714285714285714
7090153,5,B00VGXABLI,"I first really got into 3D during the early 80s revival, and my first 3D film was Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone. I knew that the previous big wave had been in the 50s, but was really somewhat in the dark as to how far back cinematic 3D went. Now that 3D is available not only in theatres but for home viewing, I've learned much more about classic 3D, and this collection is an excellent primer, moving through the silent era into what is now known as 3D's Golden Age.

The first thing you notice in watching this collection of short films, trailers, a boxing match, ViewMaster reels and print materials is how well 3D is utilised. Bob Furmanek, Greg Kintz and company have done a fantastic job making this material presentable on 3D Blu-ray, including converting anaglyphic material to black and white and fixing alignment errors, which reveals fantastic depth and some really great pop-out moments. The comic books really come to life, looking like pop-up books in the electronic realm. If you are a 3D fan, this is a must buy, whether or not you have the necessary equipment to play it, as it's also playable in 2D, but I strongly recommend it to those who do have 3D setups, as it really exploits the format to its fullest.",1435276800,7,1242,4.594594594594595

After looking at the entire 2 1/2 hour collection and being totally wowed by it I've already gone back and re-viewed several of my favorite segments. No doubt that I'll be visiting it again and again and very soon too, something I rarely say about a recently purchased and viewed disc. I can only echo the praise other buyers have bestowed on it here. Even going back to the earliest films represented here (1924-1927) the 3-D effects are absolutely amazing!

A tremendous amount of time and technology went into the restoration of these 22 little movies, and the dimensional effect is awesome. Not only is the depth way-y deeper than you see in any current Hollywood 3-D movie, but the ""pop-out"" effects (objects puncturing the space right before your eyes...you feel you could touch them!) are frequent and astonishing. If you own a 3-D t.v., I suggest you buy a copy of this without hesitation -- you will be supporting potential future 3-D releases of classic films by telling the studios that you want more! If you haven't already invested in a 3-D set, this disc alone makes a purchase worthwhile...and if you need further persuasion, keep in mind that, although Disney has inexplicably pulled support of domestic 3-D Blu-rays (after all, they were a major early supporter of the format and convinced many of us to buy into it), there are plenty of other 3-D titles currently in production from other studios which are almost certain to be released on home video in 3-D here in the USA.

DOOM TOWN is a short film made in the 1950's about the atomic bomb. The early 1920's through the 1940's chapters are great, but the second half is where it really kicks in. There's some Canadian cartoons that are pretty artsy with some bright colors and line animation (literally a squiggle line that moves around into different shapes). The Sam Space is fun. It's stop motion animation in the Rankin Bass style but maybe 10 years earlier. Sort of like Gumby without clay but using little poseable puppets. There's a bunch of great stuff on here, but there's no hour and a half movie. It's a sampling of rare 3d stuff. All vintage and all good. The Casper cartoon is last and is awesome. These are fun old shorts of vintage 3d stuff. There's some stills of old 3d comics. Most of them are just one page but there's one that's complete. It's converted from red/blue to the modern (polarized) style. It's cool to see these because I have most of them as reprinted actual comics, but these were converted and got the restoration treatment. It's a fun blu ray.

7090158,5,B00VGXABLI,"The folks of the 3-D Film Archive, LLC have created something truly special in this disc. The praise is well-deserved for the quality achieved from original elements in vastly differing states of preservation, and the stunning results leave no doubt the work was a labor of love.  I had the pleasure to watch this collection with a group of equally eager cinephile friends, and we were not disappointed. ""New Dimensions"" was a true highlight, it's rock-steady image and flawless sound seemed too good to be 75 years old. The immediacy of the prizefight newsreel got everyone riled up as if the controversial call had just happened. From in-your-face experimentals to trippy animation to classic trailers, each segment elicited amazement that so much could be accomplished so long ago.  For years, I was only able to read about several of the films in this collection, and dreamed of seeing them properly some day.  This collection is that dream come true more vividly than I could have hoped for. I would go through a detailed analysis of each sequence, the stereo imagery is imprinted so clearly into my memory, but since that has been done quite nicely by other reviewers here, I'd rather address the overall effect.

The surprising variety of the random offerings adds up to an incredibly rich, often quirky history of stereo filmmaking. Contrary to popular myth, it can no longer be locked up in its ""schlocky monster movie"" box by ill-informed reviewers. This collection is proof that 3-D movies have been a potent, if underused aspect of cinema throughout the decades. It's not revisionist, but rather it sets the record straight, affording the medium its oft-denied respect. Experiencing the segments unfold chronologically, I felt like I was set down to visit moments in time and space, and then whisked away to the next appointment. No doubt there is more material awaiting assembly (and rights clearances) for a Volume II, however this feels perfectly self-contained and is a thoroughly satisfying 3-D experience. The extra features help round out additional aspects of 20th century stereo imaging and 3-D culture. A disc this complete deserves some kind of award.

7090166,5,B00VGXABLI,"3-D RARITIES, just released, immediately takes its place as an essential part of any serious 3-D collection.  It's a winner in every respect.  I've been fortunate to see a few of these titles beautifully projected at 3-D festivals, and I attended a sold-out preview at the Museum of Modern Art in NYC prior to the Blu-ray release.  What a privilege, now, to be able to sit back and view these in all their glory at home.

I'm at a loss to know what to add to the enthusiastic reviews below.  They're as unanimous in their praise as was that MoMA audience, and it's all richly deserved.  If I had to pick one point to emphasize, it would be that what today's audiences are being fed as 3-D by current filmmakers is (for the most part) watered down, timid, bland, unimaginative and unexciting.  These filmmakers are not utilizing the DIMENSIONS the medium offers, so it's no wonder people are cynical about it, and view it as yet another passing fad.  3-D RARITIES is a very large sampling (two and a half hours worth) of the real thing, spanning half a century.  That real thing is what audiences loved in the great 1950s features -- a few trailers of which are tantalizingly presented on this disc in 3-D -- and this collection proves that creative work in 3-D cinema had been going on since the 1920s.

The material can be viewed in small or large helpings.  It's beautifully organized and easy to pick from.  I found it remarkable how when clicking ""Play All"" and watching it straight through in one sitting, the time just flew by.

BRAVO to restorer Greg Kintz and to producers Bob Furmanek, Jack Theakston, and John McElwee.  While the major studios have finally begun releasing a few very welcome vintage 3-D features, it's rare to find the attention to detail and such an overall level of perfection as achieved by this team.  Be sure to enjoy the informative commentaries by Jack Theakston and Thad Komorowski.  These are people who know their subject.  The accompanying booklet is likewise a treasure trove of information.  Finally, a sincere THANKS to Flicker Alley for having the vision and the dedication for releasing this and other cinematic landmarks with obviously loving care.

These 5.0 superlative ratings of ""3-D Essentials"" reflect my overall excitement, amazement and enthusiastic reaction to the thrilling content and incredible restoration accomplishments Flicker Alley's release of this incredible compilation demonstrates!! Producer Bob Furmanek and 3-D restorer Greg Kintz have made available the BEST reason for the continued viability of 3-D--- by showing us just how GOOD it really WAS all those years ago!! And, by comparison, how anemic most of today's timid product is . It amazes me to think that current producers, studios and mommies don't realize how much kids LOVE 3-D POP-OUT!!

The box reads: ""3-D Rarities: A Collection of 22 Ultra-Rare and Stunningly Restored 3-D Films"" And that says it all. From the early-20th century shorts to 1950s previews (""It Came from Outer Space"" and ""The Maze"" most prominent), a Caspar cartoon in wonderful color, shots of the 1939 New York World's Fair.....I could go on, but just check the listings here for complete contents. And learn all about the films and cuttings through the excellent booklet provided.

If you are a fan of 3-D or just believe (correctly) that it's simply too exciting and viable a format to simply ""go away"" OR be relegated to second-rate timid 21st-century presentations, then ""3-D Rarities"" is for you and your family. And will you all ever enjoy having a truly representative demo-disc for your friends!!!

I can't rate this disc too highly--that's why all the ""5s."" As a 10-year old 3-D fan in the 1950s, I enjoyed many 3-D films in our small-town theatre and owned many of the View-Master (demo'd) and 3-D comic books shown.
Now Greg Kintz and Bob Furmanek have demonstrated that those ""relics"" are NOT to be forgotten or ignored.

Here's hoping that ""3D Rarities"" helps spark more interest in the restoration and exhibition of 3-D films from ALL the eras that the 100 years of this essential release covers!!

This release has a nostalgia factor in that the clips, photos, trailers, documentaries, cartoons, and comics dated from the 20's to the 50's!! The 3D is really AMAZING. Pop outs, Depth, Dimension is all there....and it looks BEAUTIFULLY RESTORED AND ALLIGNED. One of my favorite parts is a comedy skit called ""I'll Sell My Shirt"". This piece has not been seen in 3D in 60 years!! The 3D in this piece had great depth and dimension. Another favorite was the first and only boxing match ever filmed in 3D: Rocky Marciano's first title defense against Jersey Joe Walcott!! As the title of this blu suggests....these clips are rare and have not been seen in years!!! This is one of those 3D blu releases that you just HAVE TO GET without any thinking about it whatsoever!! It is a GREAT RELEASE and probably THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AND STRONGEST 3D blu releases to date...EASILY!!",1434844800,8,1043,4.704918032786885
7090171,5,B00VGXABLI,"The 3-D Archive has done it once again in bringing this wonderful collection of fascinating vintage 3-D material to Blu-ray.  I've been fortunate enough to see most of these shorts on the big screen at the World 3-D Expos but having these beautiful, pristine copies in my own library is a real treat. I enjoyed seeing each and every one of them again, along with a few new surprises.

My favorite moments are the test films dating back to the 1920s and 30s (tremendous off the screen effects in these), the railroad short, the Bolex Stereo reel promo reel, as well as the ""Time For Beany"" film used to introduce ""Bwana Devil"".  The stop motion short ""Adventures of Sam Space"" and the Casper cartoon ""Boo Moon"" have never looked better.  Actual 3-D trailers for 3-D films of the 1950s are great fun also along with some very cool bonus features showcasing View-Master Reels, and rare 3-D footage shot by Francis Ford Coppola. There are even many 3-D comic panels, which make me hope some of those can be presented on Blu-ray 3D in their entirety at some point because they are better than the original 3-D comics!

There is an excellent booklet provided more detail about these rare films as well.

You simply must have this disc in your collection!  It's that good!  Very Highly Recommended!",1434844800,4,1291,4.68141592920354
7090172,5,B00VGXABLI,"I've purchased every project 3-D Film Archive has released, (try finding the ""3-D Movie Trailers"" DVD!), and all are essential.  ""Rarities"" is a true labor of love, and it shows in every way.  A regular film festival in a case!  No need to repeat what others have said-snap this one up by all means!",1434844800,7,299,4.5
7090173,5,B00VGXABLI,"If you have any interest in classic 3D or 3D history, you MUST own this fantastic collection of short subjects dating from 1922(!) to 1962. With the variety of topics, ranging from very simple proof-of-concept and demonstration reels to full-color promotional films, trailers, and animated shorts, there's lots to be excited about.

Some of the highlights for me include a 10-minute Bolex Stereo camera commercial from 1952 that serves not only as a great 3D showcase but a time-capsule into a different era of advertising (it also purports to contain the first underwater 3D footage ever filmed), a beautiful full-color Casper animated short (Boo Moon, 1953), newsreel footage of boxer Rocky Marciano playfully punching the camera and tossing the ol' medicine ball in your face (also 1953), trailers for sci-fi/horror features The Maze and It Came from Outer Space (1953), and  an introduction to the 3D process featuring Beanie and Cecil and Miss USA 1949! (clip is from 1952). Not enough? That's isn't even half the content, and the extras are great too... slide galleries of comic book pages and View-Master images (each image is chapter-stopped so you can navigate with your remote, or just let it play and the images will advance automatically every 15 seconds or so.)

Also included is a full-color illustrated program with descriptions of every item on the disc.  Overall the quality of the video is excellent considering the age and scarceness of the material. On a few shorts the image will shift between 2-and-3D (I'm assuming some frames from one of the reels was missing or beyond restoration), go soft, or show damage, but nothing that spoils the show or renders any of the segments unwatchable.

7090174,5,B00VGXABLI,"Reviewing a modern 3-D movie, an LA movie critic recently stated that the first 3-D motion picture was William Castle's 13 Ghosts. A couple of problems with that claim - it was not the first 3D movie and it wasn't even a 3D movie! That reviewer needs to see 3-D Rarities, as does anyone with an interest in stereoscopic filmmaking and, for that matter, movie history in general.  This wonderful collection presents great examples of 3-D cinema from as early as 1922, up to and including the 3-D craze of 1953-54. Included are historic motion images, sporting events, commercial presentations, animation, 3D exploitation,  and trailers for classic 3-D features, all beautifully restored and expertly aligned for proper viewing in Blu-ray 3-D. As a big fan of 1950s 3-D movies, I was thrilled with the lengthy 3-D trailers for It Came From Outer Space, The Maze, Hannah Lee, and Miss Sadie Thompson, featuring many of the scenes from those films. I still have hope that the studios will release some or all of those titles on Blu-ray 3-D but, in the meantime, it's great to have these teasers. The disc also includes a very nice 24-page illustrated booklet with detailed information about all of the films in the program.",1434672000,9,1219,4.855769230769231
7090175,5,B00VGXABLI,"The more appropriate name for this disc is the 3-D Variety Show. Only this variety show is shown in chronological order, starting with 3-D shorts from 1922.

You'll also be presented with 3-D promotional shorts for Chrysler and the Pennsylvania railroad. New Dimensions, the Chrysler short, was the first polarized Technicolor film ever shown to mass audiences and it was rescued just in the nick of time and preserved digitally.

And for the first time anywhere, experimental animator Norman McClaren's 3-D shorts are shown. And they're absolutely beautiful and hypnotizing.

This next one you absolutely cannot miss if you're a boxing fan. The infamous Rocky Marciano vs Jersey Joe Walcott rematch fight in 3-D. The only newsreel ever made in the 3rd dimension.

You'll also be treated to two color widescreen studio cartoons. The first is Sam Space, preserved from the only existing 3-D print. A stop-motion animation short about a boy traveling to Mars. Like New Dimensions, the stop-motion animation depicted here is very strong and pleasing. The 2nd cartoon, is the famous Casper the Friendly Ghost, in the short Boo Moon, which shows Casper flying to the moon to help Moon Men fight walking trees.

You'll also see a 3-D Burlesque short, ""I'll Sell My Shirt"", presented for the first time in 60 years, a grim documentary, Doom Town, about the dangers of nuclear bombs, a nightclub comic impersonating celebrities, 3-D trailers for 3-D feature films, 3-D comic books, Viewmaster reels, and much much more.

If you own a 3-D television. This is an absolute must-own disc. Unlike modern 3-D films, vintage 3-D is incredibly strong and will push your 3-D television to it's full potential. Even if you don't own a 3-D television, the historical and entertainment value alone is worth possessing.",1434672000,10,1798,5.077966101694916
