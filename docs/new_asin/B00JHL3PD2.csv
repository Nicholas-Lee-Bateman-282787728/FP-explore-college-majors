8651053,5,B00JHL3PD2,"I have tried, off and on, for several years to learn the 24 Form (aka Yang 24, Beijing Form). I have purchased the following DVDs in that pursuit: Simplified Tai Chi Chuan With Applications (Shou-Yu Liang), BodyWisdom Media: Tai Chi for Beginners (Chris Pei),
Tai Chi - The 24 Forms (Dr. Paul Lam), and Tai Chi in Paradise (David Dorian Ross). None of these did the trick. Mainly because they take the same approach. Start at the beginning and add a new posture, do those two and then add another posture. It is exceedingly boring and you never feel any flow since the approach is very stop and start. Also, the teaching is usually unchaptered so it is difficult to simply review one posture - unless you want to continually seek out the portion of the DVD discussing the given posture - and often the instructions have you turn away from the screen, so you have to suddenly turn your body about to re-orient so you can continue watching.

Admittedly, Mr. Hodge's tai chi is ugly as another reviewer implied. I will say that. He is stiff and very angular. So, if you want to see inspiring presentations of the postures or the form, then you will not be happy with this product. However, if you want the easiest way to learn the 24 Form on a DVD, then Mr. Hodge is your man. His approach is very systematic. There are four discs. Each disc has an extended warmup providing various traditional warmup and qigong movements. The next section is called ""Elements"", which contains a demonstration of each (new) posture to be used on the disc. Each demonstration has Mr. Hodges facing toward the camera, then to the side, and then away from the camera. After demonstrating the posture/form, a detailed breakdown is given as to how to do the posture. At the end of the ""Elements"" section, a practice session is available in which Mr. Hodge guides the viewer through doing six repetitions of each posture learned so far. The final section is the ""Form"". The form is shown with Mr. Hodge facing the camera, then with him facing away from the camera, then there is an extended breakdown section where Mr. Hodge walks through the form in a stop and start manner, giving pointers and explaining transitions. Finally, there is a ""follow-along"" repeat of the form.

Beyond this modular approach and the benefit of the practice session which helps you ingrain each new posture, the genius of Mr. Hodge's method is that he creates baby forms on each of the first three discs to get the viewer up and running on transitioning from one posture to the next. To keep it simple, Mr. Hodges makes each such form in the shape of an ""H"", so you don't have to worry about where you should be facing when you transition to the next posture. Even better, each of these ""baby forms""  has a beginning, middle and end so you do get a bit of flow in performing them. This is highly motivational since, unlike the other DVDs mentioned, you are not bored since you feel you are doing a bit of tai chi rather than learning by rote.

On the first disc, he teaches two moving and two static postures. He adds another six postures on the  second disc. On the third disc, he has the viewer do compound ""elements"", where he has you do a couple postures you've already learned and then adds a new posture either in the middle or at the end. On the fourth disc, he gives you a final four postures (the ones which often give a beginner trouble, where both legs and both arms are moving alternately). Basically, he starts you with simple movements on the first disc and, once you are comfortable, gives you the harder movements at the end. So, all and all, well thought out.

On the fourth disc, the complete 24 Form is demonstrated and broken down. And I learned it. In fact, I was able to learn it within three weeks of receiving this product. So, after starting and stopping for over a year with the other DVDs listed above, this product got me there within a month.

Now, the product is not perfect. First off, you should only buy this if you are a rank beginner since none of the nuance of the form or of transitioning are explained. (In example, having read sufficiently, I know that the compound movement usually called ""Grasping the Bird's Tail"" is very important theoretically since it contains the four primary ""energies"" of tai chi (ward off, roll back, press, and push). Nothing about this is discussed and, in fact, the roll back is never taught as distinct from the press. In other words, the entire compound ""Grasping the Bird's Tail"" is taught in a piecemeal fashion since the focus is on learning the movements, not on the ""neigong"" aspects of the form).

In fact, the 24 Form you will learn is actually a simplification of the actual form you will see demonstrated in competition. Many of the floating hand movements in the traditional 24 Form are not explained by Mr. Hodge and, in fact, he has altered certain Postures and, otherwise, teaches a very un-""Yang"" version of  certain postures. Which is to say, in Yang-style, a wide stance with weight shifting from a back leg stance to a front leg stance (bow stance) as the upper body moves is common (which I believe is included to teach ""silk reeling"" - e.g. coordinating the stiffing of muscles so the body's momentum is increased by each new muscle group). Often, Mr. Hodges eliminates the wide stance movement. So, he has the viewer step into the wide stance, however, when the upper body starts moving, he will instruct to take a follow-up step. Accordingly, whereas the Yang-style method for these positions (i.e. Brush Knee, Press, Push) has a sweeping/wave-like motion, the version taught is more like a Sun-style version where force is generated by stepping rather than by turning the hips to accelerate arm momentum. Given the above, you will have to find a second source if you want your 24 Form to be pure. However, Mr. Hodge will take you 95% of the way and, so, a good book like Tai Chi Chuan: 24 & 48 Postures with Martial Applications by  Shou-Yu Liang (great pictures, clear description of movements, realistic examples of the combat purpose of a form) or The Yang Taiji 24-Step Short Form: A Step-By-Step Guide for All Levels by James Drewe (adequate pictures, good description, detailed notes on what to focus on while performing a form) will provide you with sufficient info to make the small changes necessary to purify what Mr. Hodges has taught.

All and all, I really am happy with this purchase.",1411084800,16,6445,4.620087336244541

8651057,5,B00JHL3PD2,"I have been wanting to learn Tai Chi for sometime, but haven't had a chance to take a traditional class.  The Complete Tai Chi for Beginners course, by Ultimate Training, is an excellent way to learn Tai Chi in the comfort of your own home (and at a time that fits your schedule).  I am familiar with Jon and Michael Hodge, and their Ultimate Training DVDs, since I have their Shotokan Karate training course.  All of their courses are first class, comprehensive, and easy to understand.

The Complete Tai Chi course, in 4 DVDs, has been produced in an easy to follow format.  Each DVD has 4 sections: Introduction, Warm Up, Elements, and the Form.  The Introduction tells you what's coming.  The Warm Up gets you ready with simple exercises.  In the Elements section Jon Hodge explains each of the Tai Chi Elements needed for the final section.  In the Form section all of the elements are put together into a flowing Tai Chi Form (a kind of martial arts ballet).

I am only on DVD number 2, but I have learned so much.  At the end of my ""workout"" I feel relaxed and satisfied.  I can't wait to go through DVD 3 and 4.  The breathing exercises along with the Tai Chi movements seem to melt away my stress.  Tai Chi is an excellent way to get much needed exercise in a low impact form.  Tai Chi is recognized by the medical community as an adjunct treatment for various health problems.  The Harvard Health Publications wrote: "" Tai Chi is often described as meditation in motion, but it might well be called medication in motion. There is growing evidence that this mind-body practice, which originated in China as a martial art, has value in treating or preventing many health problems.""

If you have been wanting to learn Tai Chi now is the time.  Jon Hodge does an excellent job of explaining, demonstrating, and teaching Tai Chi.  Each movement is shown from different positions for an easy to follow along demonstration.  Grab this DVD set.  You won't be disappointed!  While you're at it  check out their other courses: Complete Shotokan Karate, Ultimate Karate, Complete Bo, and Krav Maga.

I highly recommend the Complete Tai Chi for Beginners DVD set.",1396828800,8,2161,4.641160949868074
