8556228,4,B00AQ785OU,A very revealing and fascinating look into the hypocrisy of the MPAA. My only reason for docking a star is that I honestly would have liked this documentary to be a little longer.,1407456000,,179,4.454545454545454
8556229,3,B00AQ785OU,"The plot was a bit of a rip-off from the ""Blaire Witch Project"". But instead of hunting witches of the forest, they were hunting the board of film censors.",1395100800,,155,4.379310344827586
8556230,5,B00AQ785OU,"Did you know ... there are NO standards.  There is No training or previous requirement for the raters. The incredible bias of the raters makes them have to remain anonymous, as they reward or ruin the careers of film makers capriciously. Brilliant. Hope there is a sequel.",1380067200,,272,4.787234042553192
