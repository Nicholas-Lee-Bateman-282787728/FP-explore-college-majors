1109569,5,6306004068,"The Prophecy is a battle between good and evil.  A tale of fallen angels on Earth doing battle over the human soul.  Christopher Walken is the  archangel Gabriel, jelous of humans and cast out by God he wants his  revenge.
Walken puts in yet another superb performance, he is edgy and  menacing and not to be missed.  A strong and different story this one will  keep you intruiged right until the very end, and then have you gasping for  more.",965001600,2,443,4.45

1109629,4,6306004068,"I picked this 4 movie Bluray disc up because it was dirt cheap and I kind of like Christopher Walken. I expected kind of entertaining but poorly made B level junk.

Wow, was I wrong. The writing, the acting, the directing, the story, are all excellent.

The only reason I deduct one star is because the second movie is missing from the disc. However, there are two other versions of this collection that contain all five movies. I wish I had it.

Mr Walken is not in the fourth or fifth movies.",1387411200,,494,4.3478260869565215

1109632,3,6306004068,"The Prophecy Collection , 4 Film Set is worth the price. The color does justice to Blu-ray. It's always interesting to see Christopher Walken in any film even campy cult classics with an array of future up and coming actors,(Virginia Madson, Eric Stoltz and especial Viggo Mortensen). The price is extremely competitive and well worth a collector time and money.",1377043200,,362,5.05
1109633,1,6306004068,"This collection to be the four films in a single disk greatly reduces the image quality. Same with the collection of From dusk till dawn. What appears to be an offer, ends up costing you dearly. It includes Spanish subtitles!",1366329600,4,225,4.65
1109634,3,6306004068,All 4 movies are on one disk. When you look at the file sizes they are larger than what would fit on a DVD buy I also bought the The Prophecy / The Prophecy II bluray and the first movie is larger on that disk than on this one. Larger file size IMO equals better picture quality but I have not check compression codecs etc to be able to have a real in depth knowledge. As has been stated before this is missing the second movie of the set.,1358812800,3,439,3.943820224719101
1109635,1,6306004068,"The product detail states:
  Number of discs: 4
But this is actually only 1 BluRay Disc with 4 movies.

None of the Films in this offering contain Subtitles.

The Editorial Review (as of this review) lists the movies in this order:

  THE PROPHECY
  THE PROPHECY: UPRISING
  THE PROPHECY 3: THE ASCENT
  THE PROPHECY: FORSAKEN

The single bluray lists the movies in this order:
  THE PROPHECY
  THE PROPHECY 3: THE ASCENT
  THE PROPHECY: UPRISING
  THE PROPHECY: FORSAKEN

It is misleading because the second movie (THE PROPHECY 2) is not in this set and UPRISING is not the second movie.

If you like these movies, and I do, do *not* add this item to your collection ( ASIN: B006ZL1PAC ) as you will likely be disappointed.",1358121600,4,724,4.653225806451613

1109667,2,6306004068,"The two stars were for a overall combined rating, If they just included the first two editions, I would probably given it 3 stars. They included the last two movies just to re-sell an old movie that was milked to death with sequels.

All four movies are crammed onto a single side of one disk, making for terrible picture quality. And Prophecy 2 isn't even included!  I returned the ""set"".",1353024000,,296,4.481481481481482

As some have mentioned here also, the quality is subpar, but to me it would still have been worth it just to have the entire collection on one disc.

Disappointing.",1345420800,,337,4.106060606060606
1109673,4,6306004068,"Not sure why people are rating 1-star. The four films are definitely better than DVD video and the audio is DTS Master. The menu is super easy to use to pick which film you want to view, no matter where you are on the disc.

Now, this is not reference blu-ray to be sure. Certainly not as bad as the other reviewer's have stated in my humble opinion. I am very pleased with the video and audio quality in this release.

I'm not reviewing the films themselves, just what I thought was good quality blu-ray for the four films on 1 disc.",1335571200,3,534,4.2254901960784315
1109674,1,6306004068,This set is on 1 disc! All four movies on one disc! The grain is so bad it is worse than the clash of the titans was. It never really goes away in some scenes like some movies and even the picture beneath the grain is blurry like some old vhs transfer!

1109675,1,6306004068,1 disc comes with 4 movies crammed on it.  None of the movies are blu-ray quality.  This is a rip-off.  Buy the DVDs instead.,1335139200,6,125,4.125
1109676,1,6306004068,"Short & Sweet:
1) According to the back of the box set, there are no bonus features (on any disc).
2) Prophecy II (2/Sequel), is NOT included in this ""Collection"", despite them all being made & distributed through Miramax (so there's no excuse of, ""Don't have the rights"", etc.)

Summary:
If all they can give Prophecy fans, is somewhat better picture & audio (and even that is debatable, via Standard DVD w/ 'upscaling')... and none of the extras that were contained on the original DVDs (features, commentaries, etc.)... Not to mention, the 2nd Movie, which is after all, the springboard for the 3rd; & anyone unfamiliar w/ the series will have a huge gaping whole in the story-line as a result... Then why waste your money?
Keep your DVDs... and if you're really itching for an HD Experience - pop the DVDs in your PS3 or Blu-Ray player for the 'upscaling'... I'm sure it's just as good as what this is, considering they clearly didn't spend any time or effort on improving anything.

PS: If you are unfamiliar with the series, and don't own it on DVD already - Just buy the DVDs... they're (much) cheaper, include bonus features (on most), and you can get all 5 Movies (which is the most important thing).  Plus, again, the quality won't be all that different anyway, if you have a DVD Upscaler, or if you play them in your Blu-Ray player.

If you watch this film closely, you'll get some interesting insight and you'll get a really satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. Besides, its Christopher Walken at his best here.

Part 2 I do feel helps greatly to understanding part 3 much better although wasn't *as* good as the others, but still in all rights, a great movie!

1109702,5,6306004068,"I have been looking for a boxed set of this series ever since I bought the VHS tapes many many years ago.  I have yet to actually see an actual image of the boxed set.. just references to the fact that there was one... and I missed it.  I think if they take these things off the market I wish they wouldnt advertise them and get peoples hopes up.

Overall though I have bought the individual DVDs of this series and the movies are great entertainment (the first being my favorite - Viggo Mortensen as Lucifer was just totally creepy and to go from Lucifer to the King of Middle Earth is quite a feat..LOL).  I do recommend at least seeing the first to get the true flavor.",1103155200,3,672,4.2265625
1109703,5,6306004068,"I've been a life-long Christopher Walken fan. The first film I can recall seeing him in was ""The Deer Hunter"". He may be creepy-looking, but he's one hell of an actor. In my opinion, he'll go down in history as one of the greatest actors that ever lived. He again proves himself with this trilogy. If you like a good thriller/horror film, this series is the one to get!",1078358400,3,369,4.36231884057971
1109704,5,6306004068,Anyone who has ever thought about philosophy and teleogical substances will find this movie great.  It brings a whole new concept to the classic battle of God vs. The Devil by bringing in good angels who want to be a catalyst to the final end battle.,1049500800,2,250,4.434782608695652
1109705,4,6306004068,"A worthwhile take on the apocalyptic theme - jealous angels, scared people, and an indifferent satan.  God doesn't do a lot in these movies - just mankind (our heroes) vs. angels (Gabriel's goons) in a celebrity deathmatch to determine our fate.  And a few other angels tossed in to make things interesting.
I can't usually stomach Christopher Walken, but am writing this review mainly to say he is perfect as Gabriel.  The first time I can recall liking his performance(s).  I don't generally like movies that require children to act either, but that is fairly easily overlooked in these films.  4 stars.",1034985600,,605,4.892156862745098
1109706,5,6306004068,"This series of movies details a war in Heaven between opposing factions of angels, those loyal to the Word of God and those loyal to the Archangel Gabriel (played superbly by Christopher Walken), who is jealously unwilling to be placed on a lower shelf than human beings in receiving God's love, being that we humans (or ""talking monkeys"", as sneeringly referred to by Gabriel and later Zophael throughout the series) were gifted by The Creator with a soul, which the angels lack.
I won't detail each movie in the trilogy in terms of plot specifics (each movie is reviewed separately under its respective title), but I will go so far as to say that this represents a most original Biblical crisis, foretold in an innovative style.  Each movie has its own merits as well as detractions, but the main reason for owning the full set is of course Christopher Walken.  He's obviously enjoying himself throughout the entire series, and as a result he gives an inspired performance as an omnipotent being who is surprisingly weak in areas that one wouldn't normally expect.
The key element to remember when watching the series is the lack of Biblical verse set in modern times.  This creates a sense of displacement for the angels on Earth as portrayed in the series; Gabriel's fascination for 20th century technology belies his contempt for those who created it, and his inability to drive a car requires him to intercept humans on their way to their Eternal Reward in order for him to move from place to place.  This is a problem that couldn't've occurred even in the New Testament and one that I feel is dealt with by the series'  producers in a realistic fashion.
If you're a fan of Christopher Walken, each of the movies is worth owning, as his development of the Character of Gabriel is well-worth watching.  At the very least I can recommend the first movie in the series to everyone, as it presents a fresh take on a genre of films that lacks many recognized classics, outside of perhaps the ""Exorcist"" and ""Omen"" franchises.",998265600,20,2026,4.7414772727272725
