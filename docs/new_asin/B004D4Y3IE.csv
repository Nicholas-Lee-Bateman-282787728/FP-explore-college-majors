4331452,5,B004D4Y3IE,"The Amazing Race is the best show on tv (or DVD) EVER!!!  I got season 1 & 7 when they came out and wrote CBS 5 times trying to get them to release more seasons.  (By the way I never heard from them)  Imagine how surprised and thrilled I was when I seen the DVD for season 2 was for sale from Amazon.  Please, please, please, Amazon get CBS to realase more seasons... or manybe you can.  I will buy every single one!  I would like to have all the seasons of TAR in my DVD collection.  Truly ... it is the best show ever on tv... bar NONE!  If you ever watch it once... you are hooked and want more and more... At least I am!",1298592000,2,624,3.858267716535433
4331453,5,B004D4Y3IE,"I am so glad that Season 2 of The Amazing Race made it to DVD. I have both seasons 1 adn 7, and I'm glad I can add this to my collecion.

This is such a great show, and works on so many levels.  First, it's a great show. It has a lot of suspense on who will come in where.  I also like how the teams interact with each other.  Will got on my nervest a lot, but it's so much fun to root agansit him. :O)  I also love the different locations that they visit.  The places are so beautiful.  It's just amazing to see the clear, crisp blue waters, and the impressive sand dunes.  I also like seeing teh different cultures, and see how other peopole live.

Another plus to the show is that this is a family show, even chidlren can enjoy it.  There isn't any profanity, or blood, or any other violence. Honestly, it's kind of refreshing to see it.

If you've have seen the other seasons, then this one isn't a let down.  If you haven't seen thsi show, then you need to get it. I can promsie you won't be sorry.",1297900800,2,1003,4.01010101010101
4331454,2,B004D4Y3IE,"I instantly ordered this the moment I saw it because I was anxiously awaiting another season of The Amazing Race other than 1 and 7 to be given the full DVD treatment.  However, this is not what this DVD is - it is only the episodes, nothing more.  I feel as if whomever made it, Amazon, CBS, producers, whatever, were preying upon hard core fans' hunger for this release.

I am very, very disappointed with my purchase.",1297641600,3,420,4.428571428571429
4331455,5,B004D4Y3IE,"I cant believe they finally released the DVD of Season 2, it's been so long.. Wish they would release all seasons prior to Season 8 on DVD. I love this show!
And if you are interested in TAR, check out Phil's documentary film ""The Ride"", I watched it at the L.A premier(and luckily grabed a photo with him), you'll be inspired by him, I promise.",1296950400,,345,4.323076923076923
4331456,5,B004D4Y3IE,"Loved Early TAR, and this season is one of the best, certainly the most down to the wire finish in race history.

4331457,5,B004D4Y3IE,"The Amazing Race has been my absolute favorite show for the past 3 years.  However, since it has only been 3 years, I had missed the first several seasons of this incredible, Emmy-award winning show.  I was thrilled when I was able to order Seasons 1 and 7 and gleefully added them to my DVD collection.  I eagerly waited...and waited...and waited...for the release of the next several seasons.  Nothing...I must have checked Amazon at least once a week...Now, today, imagine my thrill when I saw the announcement of Season 2!  As a world traveller myself and a fan of adventure (especially ziplining), I am excited to see Season 2 of this incredibly amazing tv series released.  The Amazing Race is one of the best TV series due to the stunning scenery, world cultures and stressful competition it offers.  Well Done! I hope to be on the show myself real soon!",1293753600,,861,4.7

4331459,5,B004D4Y3IE,"I agree that The Amazing Race is the best show on any network and I think most fans of the show would enjoy having their own copies of each season. In AR on DVD you are getting not only a beautiful travel documentary, but all the thrills and excitement of a race around the world! This show has comedy, drama, warmth and excitement plus the BEST reality show host on TV in Phil Keoghan. Maybe an ad on the next Amazing Race would be the perfect way to advertise its availability. Let's keep our fingers crossed that we get more Season episodes!",1292544000,2,544,4.3431372549019605
4331460,5,B004D4Y3IE,"This is my favorite show and I have been waiting for years for this set. I was thrilled when they started releasing seasons 1 & 7 but was soon disappointed when they would not continue producing season sets. When they started putting out the Survivor sets via CreateSpace, I held out hope that TAR would be next. Unfortunately it took a couple years for this to happen. Finally, the next season is available and I will be placing my order as soon as they allow. I pray they continue this trend of MOD sets for the future seasons and hope that there are at least a few extras available as an added bonus for fans who have been waiting for a long time. Thanks for this Amazon!!!!",1292457600,12,677,4.338582677165355
4331461,5,B004D4Y3IE,"Thank you Amazon for bringing the two best reality shows back to DVD finally! I was happy enough with just Survivor, but this has left me over the moon! I'm glad to see the first one being released is season 2 as well, as it's one of the best seasons in the shows history. I'll be glad to finally be able to watch this in great quality.

4331463,1,B004D4Y3IE,"I ordered 9 seasons of Amazing Race at one time. Seven of the seasons were so badly scratched, they were unwatchable. When I went to exchanged them, it was past time for exchanges. $181.79 for nothing. I have received a couple scratched DVD's over many years of ordering from Amazon, but 7 whole seasons, with 3 DVD's in each box scratched in one order, That is a LOT of scratched DVD's at one time. I am furious.

The show is great though. The Amazing Race gets 5 stars from me. The condition of the DVD's are terrible though.",1387670400,,527,4.377551020408164

4331465,1,B004D4Y3IE,"I've seen almost all The Amazing Race seasons but if I'd started with Season 2 I doubt I would have bothered with the following ones.  The people in this Second episode were so blah and so boring and uninteresting, if I hadn't actually paid for this, I wouldn't have finished watching.  I didn't care who won at the end.  Yuck, yuck, yuck.  Whoever picked these teams I bet picked no other teams in the following episodes.  If you're thinking about buying this - save your money.  Boring, boring, boring.",1354492800,,504,4.606741573033708
4331466,4,B004D4Y3IE,"After viewing Season 1, I was dying to see how the show really latched itself to our tv screens, as season 2 was what proved it to be a lasting hit. I got my answer and was pleased with the results.

This season went to even more locations then the first, had more innovative challenges, looked A LOT harder then the first and seemed like it just kept going and going and going. (Interestingly for the mole fans, if you watch Australian mole season 5, they use the same bungiee jump in that season).

The teams were interesting to watch and it seemed like the relationships between them, played a bigger role this time, wich I didn't mind.

The end was extremly intense as ***(Slight Spoiler)*** all three teams finsihed the race on the same day.

I do have two minor gripes with this season. I couldn't pick a team I wanted to win the entire thing, I could only pick teams I wanted gone or to make it to the end (Coincidently I had three teams I wanted to make top 3 and they all did). Two (BIG SPOILER) this season had way to many equalizers. Some of you won't mind that, others will.

Still, it's awesome.",1349568000,,1108,4.3076923076923075
4331467,5,B004D4Y3IE,TAR season 2 was great. I received my order from Amazon in just three days. There were several teams to really root for and a couple I could not stand. Of course the finish is a classic. The early seasons are so much fun to watch. I'm looking forward to season 3 real soon.,1345852800,,273,4.074074074074074
4331468,5,B004D4Y3IE,"I've seen every episode of this series and think this is one of the rare reality shows with true value.

The thing I love most about the show are the locations.  It is the next best thing to traveling the world myself.  Not only do I get to see multiple and varied locales, including many that I will likely never get to travel to myself, but the show producers also do a great job of finding the most unique adventures to complete in each area.  I've learned more about world geography and different cultures than I ever learned in any classroom.

It's also interesting to watch the interpersonal dynamics between teammates and between teams.  I'd be lying if I didn't admit to finding the conflicts entertaining . . . and the stress of travel and competition does bring it out.  But I always root for the teams that are nicest to each other.

And it's rewarding to see how the intensity of the race truly brings teammates closer together by forcing them to work together and rely on one another.",1340755200,,997,4.5
4331469,5,B004D4Y3IE,"I am a huge TAR fan and I've been in heaven these past couple of weeks as I've been pouring through the seasons that have been released on DVD.  This particular season began slowly with a few forgettable teams being weeded out but before long there was drama cooking amongst the remaining racers. I thoroughly enjoyed the fantastic locations while the much improved fluidity was noticeable compared to the first season. I will say that I was confused as to why 5 discs were needed when 3 have sufficed for other seasons but I imagine space issues had something to do with it.

The teams were well-cast with one particular team being known for their dysfunctional relationship that was the subject for much drama over the course of the race. Detours and roadblocks were varied but are different in comparison for current seasons. The final legs boil down to some heated competition and feature some team blunders, including a team losing a clue which leaves them stranded, forgive the pun, clueless. The race to the finish line is one of the most memorable as featured an actual foot race to the mat.

This season is memorable and it is exciting, an excellent entry in the storied franchise and a look into the humble beginnings of a legendary show.",1337472000,,1248,4.715596330275229
4331470,4,B004D4Y3IE,There's only 1 to 3 shows on each DVD. They could easily put 4 shows on each DVD. I enjoyed seasons 1 and 7 more.,1332201600,,113,3.56

4331473,4,B004D4Y3IE,"I am a huge TAR fan and love the fact I can get an official copy of Season 2. The picture quality is amazing even compared to the other two seasons that have been released.

The only issue I have with this version is that when compared to the official releases of Season 1 and Season 7, there are no extras - no commentary on some episodes from the teams or no extra scenes that you can see if you wish. That is what made Season 1 and Season 7 DVDs even better.

But all in all, if you are even a slight fan of the Amazing Race, you'll love revisiting a great, early season.",1307750400,,574,3.982608695652174

I live in Australia, and have purchased many DVDs from Amazon (including the Amazing Race 1 and 2) and found this one did not work in my NTSC player at all. As I assume from one of the comments this one is burned, which I found out too late! But Amazon have been great about me returning them, and replacing just in case I had a bad one. I have had 3 copies so far and non have worked. Just a note for all AR fans, so you don't end up as disappointed as I was unable to watch!",1306972800,3,649,5.05607476635514

4331476,5,B004D4Y3IE,"I loved this series and loved rewatching it. The ending is the all time most exciting ending and Will and Tara's endless arguing provides good entertainment. It's a fast paced series and fascinating from the start to the Finish Line.

4331481,4,B004D4Y3IE,"For anyone unfamiliar, The Amazing Race is a reality show about 11 teams (groups of 2 people - twins, siblings, friends, husband/wife, etc..) who race around the world and complete some (sometimes odd) tasks which give them a clue to where they're going next. In 28 days they travel 52,000 miles into 5 continents/8 countries.

It's one of the reality shows that I've really liked as it's entertaining throughout (seeing the odd tasks, the different locations, and the people).

&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Amazing-Race-The-First-Season/dp/B000A6T1JK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Amazing Race: The First Season</a>&nbsp;was released on DVD, with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Amazing-Race-The-Seventh-Season/dp/B000BDGW94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Amazing Race - The Seventh Season</a>&nbsp;out shortly after.. and then nothing.

Fortunately, Amazon is now offering (exclusively) Amazing Race - Season 2.

It's an Amazon Exclusive in that it's part of their burn-on-demand program. That means that rather than being a mass-produced DVD, Amazon will actually burn a DVD (or set of DVDs) when you order, put them in a case and send it out to you.

There are some Pro's and Con's to this - the PRO obviously being that this would otherwise not be released! The CON being that these are DVD-R's (complete with purple-back), usually lack extras, and can sometimes be pricey.

The set arrives in 2 DVD cases (3 discs in 1, 2 discs in the other (5 total)) - labeled ""PART 1"" and ""PART 2"". Fortunately they are sold together and not actually sold as individual parts (like some companies do).

The DVDs are in full-screen format, ranging from 1-3 episodes per disc (most discs being 3 episodes). These are hour-long episodes which come out to about ~44 minutes each on DVD. Audio is in stereo.

Video quality is good - nothing terrible but nothing great (keep in mind it is fullscreen as this was made back in 2002). Sound is the same - nothing great, but it is a TV show.

Unfortunately there are no extras. This is a bit disappointing as the previous DVD sets (season 1 & 7) had all sorts of extras (90 minutes of additional scenes, audio commentary, never-aired footage, interviews, around the world with the hosts/creators, 3 hours of never-before-viewed-scenes, each episode containing never before seen footage, etc..)

These discs are just the episodes.

Besides that, the artwork on the cases doesn't fit with the previous sets (the previous sets coming in slim DVD cases inside of a box, with the logo on the spine - these just say ""THE AMAZING RACE 1"" and ""2"" (with ""the second season"" being very small and not easy to read). A VERY small issue, but it doesn't fit with the other sets, for anyone who cares about these things.

One of the issues I have though - this set costs more than the other DVD sets. Season 1 and 7 were professionally done, include extras and sell for about 20-30 dollars. This set is 35 dollars (usually), for  a 'burned' DVD set and no extras.

Aside from that, I love the show and if you do too, this is worth getting - I only hope they release the other series'",1303948800,3,3199,5.2105263157894735
4331482,5,B004D4Y3IE,"So glad that I received a working copy before it went out of stock.  As far as the quality of the video and audio is concerned, it's good but not great. That doesn't really does not matter since this is the one DVD that makes me take the DEEP PLUNGE for the 55 inch LED TV and blu-ray player. Well worth it on the largest screen to see the part in Australia and New Zealand.

This season is truly amazing compared to the later ones. The action is really fast paced toward the end with tons of twists and turns. Without revealing the ending, the two hours finale is definitely a NAILBITER!

I wish CBS can release more of this AMAZING show, my favorite reality series. Currently only three seasons are available. Truly blessed to have the last few working copies before it went out of the stock! DON""T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITHOUT IT!!!",1303862400,,830,4.341935483870968

I was really happy to see that season 2 would be available and I ordered it right away.
This was at the end of January and I had to wait 2 months before this article was sent to my address.
During this wait, I was informed by Amazon that the wait would be longer than expected and that I could cancel my order if I wanted.
I decided to wait as long as I had to.
I finally received the set in mid-April, but I was surprised to see the mention ""Part One"" on the cover art.
The set I received has only 3 DVDs with a total of 8 episodes, so I'm guessing there is a Part Two with the remaining episodes of the season...
No other comments here mention the same problem.
Did everyone receive the full season (a 5-DVD set) ??
Am I the only one with this problem ?
Of course, I wrote to Amazon's Customer Service, and I'm sure I will get an answer from them very soon.

I will watch it over and over, and especially enjoy the chance to share it with friends who are late comers to fanhood, and haven't had the opportunity to watch some of these teams deal with it when everything was new and unknown.

My favorite Race moment ever...""Swing you fat bastard"" (Kevin, to Drew) Race 1. Television just doesn't get any better than that.

The funniest Race moment ever...Colin and the Ox, Race 5.  (PLEASE HURRAY, Amazon!)

But the most SATISFYING moment in 19 races is watching (and now, thank you AMAZON! RE watching CLEARLY) the Boston Boys run down that !*$#^& Will in the last quarter mile of this race. Even after all these years, and all the jackasses that have been on the show, it just soothes my soul to see that guy RUINED. Over, and over, and over, seeing the smug wiped right off his horrible face--it just makes me believe in justice on a bad day...

It would have been better, obviously if some other team had done it--I'm not fan of the boys particularly--but it's the most satisfying moment of the race that it in fact DID get done.
