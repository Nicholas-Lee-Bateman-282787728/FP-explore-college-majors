Don't get me wrong here, the picture is clean and the sound pristine. Film grain being what it was then, 1920x1080 digital Blu-Ray will likely give you superior quality over a 4K which will only highlight all the film stock flaws, as well as skin complexion and make-up flakes.

Without extras I might as well wait for streaming and a monthly service charge. If the movie distributor is only offering their bare minimum why should I offer them any more in return?

Tommy features The Who, Elton John, Tina Turner, Eric Clapton, Jack Nicholson (singing!), Ann-Margret, Oliver Reed, Jesus Christ himself: Robert Powell, Paul Nicholas (who has acted in more Rock Opera movies than anyone), and all wrapped up in a kaleidoscopic mind-trip Ken Russell movie.

What an embarrassment of riches! In a single movie!

Yet no extras added to the world's first Rock Opera? From a band that remains popular over 40 years later?

The 2014 Sony suits couldn't figure out how to sell TOMMY with extras about The Who, Elton John, and Jack Nicholson? In an era of blockbuster movie soundtracks, TV shows, and even hit Broadway and Las Vegas shows all fueled by 70s and 80s bands?

In a freaking steelbook no less?

Holy cow! How extraordinarily embarrassing is that?",1521504000,,1436,4.738955823293173
