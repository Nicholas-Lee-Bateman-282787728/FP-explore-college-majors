2409401,3,B000B9EYFW,"""De battre mon coeur s'est arr?t?"" by Jacques Audiard - a remake of James Toback's ""Fingers"" - portrayed an angry young man possessed by art.

Despite all the good reviews, I did not find myself pulled into the film as much, no less due to the fact that I speak French as well as Vietnamese as first languages, and was bothered by the role of Linh-Dan Pham being portrayed as a Chinese (that was fine, by all means...) who spoke perfect Vietnamese throughout the film (that REALLY bothered me because she is supposed to be Chinese).

If I tuned out the French, pretended I did not understand Vietnamese and that Lin-Dan Pham was really speaking Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese or whatever...), then I would find the whole premise more palatable.  In case anyone wants to know, Linh-Dan Pham is a French citizen of Vietnamese heritage, who had a degree in business/marketing, and who resides currently in London.

Just imagine a French movie with an American playing the role of a German, but who keeps speaking perfect American English throughout the movie and passes if off as German, and those of you who understand English will also be driven bananas...",1147305600,2,1155,4.788944723618091
2409402,5,B000B9EYFW,"Watching the interviews on this DVD with the director Jacque Audiard and screenwriter Tonino Benacquesta who collaborated in this film remake, you get an idea of how the tension in it originated. Both were at opposite poles in their approach to the project, and the original film, ""Fingers,"" was pulling in yet a third direction. The result is a nervous, frenetic, fast-paced story with multiple plot threads, characters in head-on conflict, and a fascinating, agitated performance by actor Romain Duris, who recalls the electric screen presence of the young Jean-Paul Belmondo.

The suspense here is driven by, of all things, an upcoming piano audition. Mix in the dark underside of commercial real estate, marital infidelity, and a nightlife involving drugs and alcohol, and the movie gives you little opportunity to step back and catch your breath. The music track, especially the excerpts from classical compositions, underscores the intensity of the handheld camera work and jumpy editing.

It's enough to get your heart racing, and seldom do you find your concern for a character center so much on the welfare of his hands - used here for everything from high-speed keyboard virtuosity to holding a knife to someone's throat - and sucking down the last drag of yet another cigarette (has anyone told the French about lung cancer?). The DVD includes 20-30 minutes of deleted scenes, which add wonderfully to the depth of the characterizations. Somewhat less interesting are samples of actors' rehearsals. Definitely for music-loving lovers of film noir, this one even includes an interview with the film's music composer, Alexandre Desplat.",1146355200,2,1645,5.2748091603053435
2409403,4,B000B9EYFW,"Romain Duris is Tom, a 28 year-old bundle of nervous and undirected energy, who, after a chance encounter one evening in Paris, decides to try and resurrect a long-buried ambition to emulate his mother and become a concert pianist.  Since Tom's current occupation is emulating his father as a small-time hoodlum making and enforcing shady real estate deals, the step-by-step to this career makeover surprises Tom's current and would-be colleagues in both worlds.  Duris is amazing, wired to techno music under sleek headphones he wears through the streets of the city, jittery at the piano, obsessively practicing air piano while alone and on the headcracking profession of his father.  This energy eventually spills over into the sexual, including one particularly ill-advised conquest.  He trains for his fateful audition with Miao Lin (Linh Dan Pham), a concert pianist recently arrived from China.  She speaks no French; neither of his professions has enabled him to learn Chinese.  One of the movie's finest scenes comes when, in the tension of preparing his piece for audition, they engage in a shouting match in their native languges, incomprehensible except for the emotion and, thus, completely comprehensible to both.  It's never going to gross millions, but The Beat My Heart Skipped is a small gem, consistently tense and entertaining -- if sometimes a bit difficult to follow -- as Tom wrestles with his present and eventually builds his own future.",1145145600,2,1462,5.222222222222222
2409404,4,B000B9EYFW,"Small time French gangster, dabbling in a real estate racket, renews his passion as a classical pianist, while falling deeper into the sordid world of low level gangster violence. He's got to protect his hands for his piano playing when he beats someone up, which is often, and no one, not his gangland buddies, who all look like they began stealing loaves of bread on the same French street corner, or his gangster father, who sees his son as the heir apparent to 'the big score', can understand his sudden desire for the ivories. This remake of, ""Fingers"", a rather obscure 1978 film starring Harvey Keitel, is a breezy and dramatic romp about one man's last chance to grab destiny by the throat, and strangle it. Does he succeed at his big audition with a famous conductor? You'll be hoping so with bated breath. Romain Duris, in the lead, as the petty criminal nursing an artistic desire, whether hunched over the piano striving for perfection, or slapping around a guy in a resteraunt, is as magnetic and fiery as an approaching meteor, Linh Dan Pham, as his piano teacher, with a talent all her own, harbors a wealth of dimure, ferociously reserved sexual appeal, and Niels Arestrup, as his worldly father, casts parental gazes only a dad could possess. My guess is that your heart will flip over, ""The Beat That My Heart Skipped"".",1142467200,,1337,4.717948717948718
2409405,4,B000B9EYFW,"A story about a son who assists his father but is unhappy and wishes to pursue his dreams would capture a viewer's heart and we'd find ourselves rooting for the person pursuing his dream. But what of the son who is helping his father in business is the son of a slumlord who evicts people from building by storming the apartment and breaking windows, cuts off running water, or releases rats? Would we really care if he one day reaches his goal? In real life, perhaps we wouldn't, but in the film THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKIPPED, we may find ourselves rooting for the antihero in this original and riveting film.

The plot of the film is rather basic. Romain Duris plays Thomas Seyr who spends most of his time funding shady real estate deals and doing his father's dirty work. He doesn't seem to think much about his life until he meets Mr. Fox, the man who once managed his late mother's musical career. Fox recalls that Tom had musical ability and offers him an audition. Tom then begins to pursue his music while still being a part of the underworld. Gradually he begins to think about the direction of his life but never in a sentimental way. The film has a number of twists and turns which keeps it from being predictable.

The plot of the film moves along at a good pace. There is plenty of action but we see a deeper side of Tom. So often French filmmakers do a great job at steering clear from clich&eacute;s and THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKIPPED is no exception.",1140825600,,1468,4.393382352941177
2409406,4,B000B9EYFW,"Jacques Audiard's ""Read My Lips"" was a riveting drama from 2001 that earned Audiard a Best Director nomination and a win for Best Screenplay from the French Academy of Arts.  It made me seek out his newest film with eager anticipation.  After 22 films such as ""The Crazy Stranger"" & ""Peut-etre,"" Romain Duris has amassed a sizable body of work.  However, as pianist/gangster Thomas Seyr, I think it's the first of his work that I've seen.  He carries the film with an edgy performance that both delivers the hairpin trigger temper with a sensitivity that clashes and makes for an incredibly interesting 2 hours of cinema.  On the criminal side, he works for his father Robert played by Niels Arestrup and with his friend Fabrice played by Jonathan Zaccai.  They employ numerous sleazy methods to influence real estate deals such as importing bags of rats before inspection.  Robert gets stiffed by Russian gangster Minskov played by Anton Yokovlev and sends his son to recover his funds.  Tom climbs over the bathroom stall for an intimate encounter with Minskov's girlfriend played by Melanie Laurant and advises his dad to write off the loss rather than play with fire.  The reaction shots that Duris gives when he discovers Robert's violated apartment are priceless.  On the side of sensitivity, Seyr's mother was a concert pianist.  He is sparked to try again to become good enough to perform.  His teacher is Miao Lin played by Linh Dan Pham from ""Indochine.""  His lessons are punctuated with an affair with his friend Fabrice's wife played by Aure Atika who was in ""Bimboland.""  After covering repeatedly for Fabrice's extra-marital adventures, Thomas & Aline consumate their attraction.  Audiard then fast forwards the film several years to conclude with Thomas being the help for performance pianist Miao Lin.  The screenplay careens from violence to beauty like a ping pong match between gladiators.  Enjoy!",1138752000,4,1916,5.050955414012739
2409407,5,B000B9EYFW,"'De battre mon coeur s'est arrt&eacute;' ('The Beat that my Heart Skipped') is another superb and delicate character-driven film from French writer/director Jacques Audiard ('Read My Lips') and his collaborator Tonino Benacquista.  How this director can take such potentially fragile subjects and create enormously powerful and indelible characters would indicate that he is one of cinema's truly important artists.

The story evolves as Thomas Seyr (Romain Duris) is seen as a member of a real estate scam working with smarmy associates who buy and sell buildings at the expense and eviction of poor tenants. The work is distasteful but Thomas is following the lead of his father Robert (Niels Arestrup), a man on the skids  who depends on Thomas to do his 'collections'.  Thomas loathes the work but is devoted to his rundown father.  We discover that Thomas' mother, a former concert pianist, is dead when Thomas encounters his old piano teacher who urges him to practice despite his ten year absence from playing and to audition for a new career.  A light of hope goes on in Thomas' psyche and he is lead to a Chinese immigrant pianist Miao Lin (Linh Dan Pham) who takes him on as a pupil to prepare him for his anticipated audition.

As Thomas practices, his world of crime does not abate and he is intermittently pulled away from his passion  for the piano by his old partners as well as his father's continuing need for his 'dirty services'.  He is torn between the life he has been leading and the promises of a career with his mother's (and his) passion for beauty in music.  When the partition tenuously separating these dual lives is broken, Thomas struggles to find his way back to music.  The ending is unexpected and keeps in step with the verismo of the screenplay.

Romain Duris is a major talent and delivers the kind of performance that indicates he is becoming a powerhouse of an actor.  But the real star of the film is the director who knows how to relate a glimpse of a man's life in subtle, quiet ways despite the  accompanying background of violence. It is  a delicate balance and Jacques Audiard makes it work. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, December 05",1134259200,4,2179,4.788770053475936
2409408,5,B000B9EYFW,"Riveting French drama ""The Beat That My Heart Skipped"" is loosely based on the 1978 film `Fingers' starring young Harvey Keitel. Yes, it's a remake, a French one remaking American film, a very rare case these days when Hollywood produces so many remakes. But ask any French film directors or French actors about their favorite American film, and their answers would be invariably the American films in the 70s, like `Mean Street.' So there's nothing strange about remaking Harvey Keitel film, right?

Anyway, Roman Duris perfectly plays Tom working for a real estate agent, but the reality about his job is far from respectable, such as kicking out the poor residents onto the street, or harassing the tenants with lots of rats carried in a bag. To be fair, Tom is not enjoying the job. But the fact that does not change that he is angry, dissatisfied, and unhappy. And his father who shows up before him with a new fiance is no help. Or perhaps, worse than no help in his case.

But Tom was once a pianist with promising career. One night he meets his former piano teacher, and is persuaded to have an audition. To follow the dream of being a concert pianist, Tom hires a young female Chinese pianist Miao-Lin as tutor, who does not speak French at all. While he keeps practicing, Tom must do his dirty jobs, including the ones that his silently overbearing father gave specially to him, about one deal with Russian mafia.

[ALL ABOUT TOM] The synopsis sounds like a gangster film or a noir film, but ""The Beat That My Heart Skipped"" is actually about one young man Tom torn between the two sets of values. I should not mention much about the content, but back in the 70s they made this kind of films about one person (like `Taxi Driver') and this film remind me of those days. What happens to him is not a big action - you can vaguely feel it from the tone of the film. In spite of the music inserted here and there, the feeling of the film is a very subdued one, reflecting the intelligence of the director Jacques Audiard, whose previous film was a unique mixture of thriller and quietness, `Read My Lips.'

The camera, without using flashy techniques, follows the character of Tom, as if in love with the person. Roman Duris, who was terribly miscast in his previous `Arsne Lupin' as the title role, well-deserves the minute attention of the camera, who is absolutely convincing with nuanced acting as the tormented (but very seductive) youth.

The different ending of the film is justified, which matches the complex personality of the hero. Harvey Keitel and his acting was great in `Fingers,' just electrifying like young DeNiro or Pacino. Roman Duris, who is equally great here, and his vivid acting too, would bring back the memories of the days when one ordinary man's life could be a subject of a fascinating feature-length film.",1133740800,4,2841,4.6626746506986025
2409409,5,B000B9EYFW,"Tom (Romain Duris) works as a sort of real-estate thug. He and his partners trash buildings in low-income areas, buying them low and selling them high for a quick profit. It's a grotesque scam that involves letting sewer rats loose in target buildings so as to scare out squatters and sometimes paying tenants.

Tom's work is morally corrupt and physically debilitating and Tom manifests this corruptness in the very core of his being: he's depressed, violent, short-tempered and vehemently without empathy and humanity. He is only seemingly nice when a good-looking woman is around and that is only so he can bed her.

Then one day he spots his dead mother's music manager who promises him an audition which draws Tom back into his musical training: something he deserted many years before. Tom throws himself into classical music at first as a challenge to recapture his talent. But what he doesn't initially realize is that music will ultimately prove to be his salvation...turning him from the darkness to the light.

Music has always been something that Tom has associated with what little good he has experienced in his life. To him, music recalls his loving mother. To him, music has always meant love. And he grasps at a life in music like a drowning man grasps at a life preserver. He is as neurotic at reclaiming his musical talent as he is at stealing, drinking, drugging and cheating. He has a goal for the first time in many, many years.

Romain Duris (""The Spanish Apartment,"" ""Le Divorce"") heretofore has always been the good guy: young and sweet yet in both of these roles he was always a little devious, a little devilish. Here, Duris is all about Cuban-heeled shoes, black leather jacket, buffed out body, dyed black hair and unflinching scowl. More importantly, Tom has a big black hole where his soul should be and he uses his love of music to fill it...little by little as a compulsive eater uses food to fill an emptiness that is never quite satiated. Duris gives a profound, thoughtful and passionate performance.

Director Jacques Audiard (the sublime ""Read My Lips"") has made a film redolent of darkness and misanthropy on one hand and hope and light on the other. And it is this ambiguity that makes this film snap with world-weary wit and non-sanctimonious truth.

Redemption through the intricacies and beauty found within and between the notes of a Bach Toccata? Oh, yes.",1129507200,30,2400,4.841463414634147
2409410,4,B000B9EYFW,"In ""The Beat That My Heart Skipped,"" a brash young Parisian slumlord named Tom (Romain Duris) spends his evenings bar-hopping, bickering with his partners and occasionally lugging sacks of sewer rats into buildings he wants vacated.

He doesn't seem particularly good at his job; in fact, with his disheveled mod haircut, his scowling brow and his long-sleeved shirts, he looks more like the lead guitarist for Oasis than a real estate crook.

He's also a fidgety bundle of nerves, pushing 30, going nowhere. His puffy, somewhat yellowed father (Niels Arestrup) is into property scams, too, but he's slipping badly; Tom's mother, a concert pianist, long ago committed suicide. Tom once studied piano, too, but let it get away from him.

One night, by chance, he runs into his mother's former manager, who offers him an audition. The gesture seems like just a courtesy, but Tom gets enthused about it and, suddenly takes up the piano for the first time in a decade, relentlessly practicing for his audition. He can't quite explain what he hopes to accomplish; he just knows he needs something new.

""Beat"" is a loose, clear-eyed remake of James Toback's wild but unlikely 1978 drama, ""Fingers,"" in which a young Harvey Keitel played a vicious Mob enforcer/piano prodigy. But it also has a lot in common with a more recent American movie, ""Hustle & Flow."" That, too, was about a frustrated slacker trying to start a new life as a musician, but where ""Hustle"" was warm and optimistic, ""Beat"" is cold and keyed-up.  When the characters in ""Hustle"" create their hip-hop anthem, it makes for some of the best, most joyous scenes in any movie this year. Tom's practice sessions, on the other hand, are the agony of music, not the ecstasy, and at times, as he repeatedly works through Bach's Toccata in E Minor, it seems that music itself might push him over the edge.

Director and co-writer Jacques Audiard mimics this tension with his filmmaking. His handheld camera and his editing are as jumpy as Tom is, and Audiard frequently cuts away from scenes before we even see how they play out. Between those techniques and Duris' intricate, tightly-wound performance, ""Beat"" isn't exactly a lot of fun, but it's engrossing and affecting and it's a film that probably will stick in viewers' minds for a while, whether they want it to or not.",1126828800,7,2331,4.858942065491184
2409411,4,B000B9EYFW,"This film is a remake of Fingers and better!  Fingers was a film starring Harvey Keitel and directed by James Toback which has a cult following but was never considered that good.

A young man with a businessman father who uses him to terrorize and wound people who owes his father money is still attracted to classical music and his late mother's life as a concert pianist.  He decides to attempt to audition for a performance while continuing his day job.  How does punching people affect your hands and fingers used to play piano?

2409412,4,B000B9EYFW,"Thomas is a small-time hood, son of another small-time hood, who goes around putting rats in houses, beating up people and pushing out squatters as part of his illicit real estate business; but Thomas has another dream, buried deep inside until a chance encounter on a busy Paris street ignites his desires: he wants to be a classical pianist. The film explores the conflicts between his day-to-day job, his problems with his randy father who eventually gets himself in too deep with the much bigger and more brutal gangsters, his business partners, and the young Chinese woman he eventually finds to teach him to play the piano on a level that can get him an audition for his dead mother's former manager.

It's based on James' Toback's 27-year-old American film FINGERS, which starred Harvey Keitel and which is much admired; I haven't seen the original but it's hard to believe that Keitel was any better in the central role than Romain Duris (a look-alike for a young Daniel Day-Lewis for all you Brit-fanciers out there), who offers brutality, insensitivity and arrogance in most of his daily life, but with an undercurrent of melancholy and self-doubt that makes him one of the most real characters I've seen on screen in a while. I loved the look of the film; it's shot in Paris but you'd never know, it's all close-ups, cramped apartment spaces and dirty night-time streets, no scenery but the emotions on the expressive face of Duris and a few of the other characters.

The film doesn't talk down to the audience, something I found very refreshing when I first saw this theatrically, after a summer of blockbusters...the first few minutes are a bit chaotic and confusing and they mirror the troubled protagonist. I love that, though he seems at times to be making progress out of his unpleasant and violent existence, you're never quite sure...until the spectacular ending, where everything wraps up beautifully...or does it? See for yourself.  One of the best French films of the last 5 years that I've seen.",1255392000,,2018,4.877551020408164
2409413,4,B000B9EYFW,"""The Beat that My Heart Skipped"" is somewhat of a rarity - a foreign language remake of an American movie.  Director Jacques Audiard has adapted and updated the 1978 gritty American film, ""Fingers,"" in this equally gritty French movie, with Romain Duris taking on the role originally played by Harvey Keitel.  Duris' Thomas is a small-time thug who also happens to be a talented pianist, a skill he seemingly inherited from his mother who died years earlier.  He's torn between these two disparate worlds, with his father continually pressuring him to stay in this thuggish underworld.  When Thomas receives an offer to audition for his mother's former agent, he hires a Vietnamese pianist to tutor him, and he starts to tilt toward this world hoping to escape through his piano playing; however, his associates have other ideas.

This excellent character study contains flashes of violence, but it is not a typical gangster film.  The focus is on how this character attempts to navigate two nearly diametrically opposed worlds.  Audiard and his co-writer (Tonino Benacquista) make some intelligent changes in updating the original script by James Toback, and Audiard's work as director is top-notch.  Duris and the rest of the cast are also excellent, with Duris a bit suaver in his role than was Keitel which helps makes the film seem more contemporary.

To enjoy ""The Beat that My Heart Skipped,"" you obviously don't need to have seen the original movie, but it does provide a fascinating contrast.  The film deservedly nearly swept the Cesar Awards (the equivalent of the French Oscars), winning Best Film, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Niels Arestrup as Thomas' father), Best Adapted Screenplay, and four other awards.  Hopefully, this movie as well as ""Fingers"" will find the audiences they deserve.",1223942400,2,1813,5.13265306122449

Thomas (Romain Duris) is a shady real estate developer, releasing rats in apartment blocks to drive out the residents, then buying up the property before they can move back in. He is torn between this dishonourable profession like his scumbag father (Niels Arestrup) and a career as a concert pianist like his late mother. Seeking a way out of his violent lifestyle, he hires a Vietnamese pianist (Linh Dan Pham) to help him reach a professional level, and though they share no common language, it proves a fruitful partnership.

Though the story remains powerful for much of its length, things seem somewhat rushed towards the end. It is suggested that character of Thomas' father's ex-girlfriend will play a major role, but then she disappears. And the ending itself, which I won't give away, is an ambiguous statement about whether Thomas has found peace with himself or not. Perhaps these flaws were present in FINGERS, I don't know, though I do know that the remake that is DE BATTRE has 17 minutes of new scenes, mainly dealing with Thomas' work with his piano teacher.

Regardless of its plot and the comparison to the original, what makes DE BATTRE an interest effort of its own are the performances. Many viewers will have known Romain Duris only from his turn as the innocent European manchild Xavier in 2000's

2409416,4,B000B9EYFW,"The Beat My Heart Skipped (Jacques Audiard, 2005)

Audiard (Venus Beauty Institute)'s latest (as I write this) film is a combination of existential crime drama and Shine. Which, I have to admit, sounds like a pretty terrible combination, but this is Jacques Audiard. He doesn't know how to do terrible, and the raft of awards this movie won (including the Best Foreign Film BAFTA) would seem to bear that out.

The story concerns Thomas Seyr (L'Auberge Espanole's Romain Duris), who as the film opens is straddling the fine line between being a real estate speculator and a hired thug, the latter of which has him following in the footsteps of his father, who has grown ineffectual in his old age. Thomas' late mother, however, was a renowned concert pianist, and when Thomas runs into his mother's old manager quite by chance, he finds that his desire to play the piano has never really left him (in his spare time, when not chasing squatters out of his buildings, Thomas creates techno music his father loathes), and when said manager offers him a chance to audition as a concert pianist in his own right, he starts taking a crash refresher course in piano with Miao Linh (Indochine's Linh Dan Pham), an even harsher taskmaster than his father. Complicating all this is Thomas' complicity in the peccadilloes of his business partner, Fabrice (Les Revenantes' Jonathan Zaccai); he enables his pal mostly because Thomas is in love with Fabrice's wife Aline (Aure Atika, recently of Tsunami: The Aftermath) and is trying to find a way to use it against him. Yeah, Thomas is a man whose moral principles are kind of on the shady side-- but he believes, and we believe with him, that getting back into the world of classical music may rehabilitate him.

There's the rub, then-- we, too, believe it. Audiard's prodigy is a well-drawn, sensitive character we can identify with all too readily, for the choices he's faced with and the complications in his life are universal, if on a grand and twisted scale. Did Audiard realize this? I can't imagine he didn't, but it didn't get in the way of his telling a good story. And a good story it is, frenetic (and the piano-practicing scenes are even more so than the thug life, which is amazing) and ludicrous and seven different types of fun. If Kirkegaard had written crime films, he might have come up with something like this. A must-see. ****",1198108800,2,2386,4.758454106280193
2409417,5,B000B9EYFW,"There is a distinct quality and style that most French films have, among them, the subtle music that plays on the background, or the use of silence to heighten emotions. But this movie made use of a much `louder' more modern  music to really bring in the characters. Directed by Jacques Audiard, The Beat that my Heart Skipped is actually a remake based on the 1978 American movie Fingers. But unlike some remakes, it surpasses the original, not only because of the vision of its Director but for the powerful portrayal of its lead actor, Romain Duris.

In one of the most memorable performances of any actor of his generation, Duris transformed himself into Tom, a hoodlum who terrorizes poor urban dwellers in order to buy cheap properties and sell them for profits. There is a tradition to his work as he inherits the same `vocation' from his father. There is, however, a certain side to Tom, an artistic side, the one talent he inherited from his dead mother- the love of classical music and an ability (a remarkable talent, actually) to play the piano. As he struggles to maintain some semblance of `humanity' in his arresting and despicable character, he has to make a choice whether to remain loyal to his father and continue in their work or pursue a career in music, perhaps the only way out for him and a chance to redeem himself.

Not exactly your usual combination of talents.  Romain Duris plays Thomas Seyr who is that character.  Duris brings an animal sensuality and an artist's sensitivity to the part.  He is an actor of unusual skills and vitality.  Audiard gets the most out of him.

In the beginning Tom Seyr is in apprenticeship to take over his father's way of life in a French version of the protection racket.  Their particular hustle involves getting properties condemned by trashing them or infecting them with rats or some other vermin, forcibly throwing out squatters or tenants, then buying the property on the cheap, and then finally selling it at a nice profit.  In the end, Tom...well, I can't give you the ending, but I can say that it is entirely agreeable and surprising with just a little twist on what we might expect.

Neils Arestrup plays the father.  There are some other interesting characters and a lot of macho action, a bit of blood here and there, some quick and easy sex.  And then there is an old piano teacher that Tom happens to run into one day who invites him to an audition.  Tom has not played the piano seriously for years, but just seeing his old teacher brings back the thrill and the deep intimacy he once had with music, and recalls to him the career of his deceased mother, who was once a concert pianist who had hoped that her son would be too.  He had the talent.

But of course playing the piano at that level is not something you can take up, let go, and then go back to.  But Tom thinks maybe he can do it with a little practice.  But he needs a teacher to prepare for the audition.  When he tries to get one he is effectively laughed at since he is 28-years-old and is very much out of practice and indeed never really practiced that much.  But by chance (there are a number of plot furtherances in this film that come about by chance--but that is not a problem because the chance meetings seem natural and are events that would probably happen eventually)--and so by chance he is hooked up with a young woman fresh from China who speaks no French, but is an expert pianist who needs a little money.  She agrees to help him.  Her name is Miao Lin.  She is played brilliantly with subtlety and finesse by French-Vietnamese actress Linh Dan Pham, whom I previously saw in Indochine (1992) playing the adopted child of Catherine Deneuve's character.

The acting ability of Romain Duris and Linh Dan Pham are what carry this film.  Audiard's direction is a bit scattered at times and especially in the beginning lacks focus, but a clever storyline and his ability to get great performances from the players overcome these faults.

See this for Romain Duris who gives a virtuoso performance and for Linh Dan Pham who captivates with restrained intensity.",1179532800,2,3003,4.590994371482176
2409419,4,B000B9EYFW,"I missed the first half hour of this film, but still enjoyed it. Tom, (Romain Duris) is a Real Estate Agent. Apparantly, in France, this involves a lot more brutality and thuggishness than it does in Bakersfield (though there have been some indictments recently). Squatters are brutally evicted, debts are collected with force, fires are set, rats released. Tom got into the business like his father, but his mother was a pianist, and he showed promise there, too. A chance encounter puts him back on a musical path.

This could be just a syrapy fable about the power of Art and Music to transform, but it never gets too sacharine. A visceral performance by Duris and a good script makes for a compelling tale well told. When you think about it, it is about a man taking piano lessons. So, to make that come across onscreen is quite an achievement. One scene shows him out with his Real Estate colleagues, waiting in the van to roust some squatters from a property. Tomorrow is his big audition, and he practices a presto movement sans piano. His fingers move incredibly fast, but you can almost hear the music. You feel like he is really practicing his piece, not just wiggling his fingers randomly.

2409421,4,B000B9EYFW,"""De battre mon coeur s'est arrt""(2005)...aka ""The Beat That My Heart Skipped"" written/directed by Jaques Audiard is a French remake of James Toback's cult movie ""Fingers"" (1978) with Harvey Keitel. The film tells the story of a young man Thomas (Romain Duris) who is torn by two different sides of his personality - one dreams of becoming a virtuoso piano player and the other - a ruthless debt-collector and enforcer. I think that Duris's was the one of the best performances of last year - so convincing he was as a man who walked on the edge of two realities. The best moments of the film are the ones between Thomas and his piano tutor, the girl whom he hired to prepare himself for an audition that was offered to him by a man who had been the manager of Thomas's late mother, the talented concerto pianist. The man remembers Thomas who had inherited his mother's talent and used to study piano seriously until his mother died when he was 18 and he joined his father in the ""real estate"" and debt- collecting business. The tutor, a young pianist from China who arrived to Paris recently, does not speak any French and Thomas does not speak her language - so they have to relay to music to understand one another. The film is not perfect, and I am not too fond of director Jaques Audiard's frequent and abrupt cuts of the scenes but it is superbly acted, energetic, and well written.",1175817600,,1387,4.52988047808765
2409422,5,B000B9EYFW,"Since you can read it elsewhere, I won't explain the premise.  Instead, I will simply talk about the film itself.

The cinematography is decent, and the lighting is very good.  It manages to capture each moment in a pale, sometimes almost dull, wash of color - perfectly reflecting the ""nitty grittiness"" of some of the scenes.  The acting is good, and the casting very well done.  The soundtrack is excellent.

All in all, the film is fresh - very different from many of the films I've seen lately, and radically so from any American film.  The protagonist's struggle to recapture the piano is passionate and believable - especially for those of us who have ever endeavored an instrument.  He's a fascinating character, and one well worth seeing.

Definitely check out this film - French language, if you can (I'm not certain if they've dubbed it, but it would really lose something in translation).",1171152000,5,900,4.830065359477124

It is as if the movie evolves along with its main character - this is a feat which one rarely sees achieved in the movie world...

2409424,4,B000B9EYFW,"When he was younger, Thomas Seyr had a dream of becoming a concert pianist just like his mother but abandoned that goal when she passed away, taking the dream with her.  Now, ten years later, Thomas, at twenty-eight, is little more than a professional punk whose job appears to be investing in shady real estate deals then using underhanded and sometimes even violent methods to evict those who cannot pay their rents or mortgages.  However, one day Thomas bumps into his late mother's agent who encourages him to take up music again.  With a renewed sense of purpose, Thomas begins taking lessons from a beautiful Chinese virtuoso while, at the same time, attempting to pull away from some of the more unsavory elements of his life (including his own derelict father who he keeps having to defend against recalcitrant debtors).  But he soon learns that renewal and redemption are often easier to dream about than they are to achieve and that the life we choose early on is often the life we have to live with.

In an unusual trans-Atlantic turnabout, ""The Beat That My Heart Skipped"" is actually a French remake of an American film (it`s generally the other way around) - in this case,  James Toback's 1978 ""Fingers.""  Set in Paris, this is a subtle, low-keyed study of a man fighting the demons of his own personality while trying to turn around a life that has veered perilously off its original course.  Working off Toback's original screenplay, writer Tonino Benacquista and co-writer/director Jacques Audiard avoid making their points with heavy-handed melodrama, choosing instead to show us Thomas as he goes about the routines of his hectic daily life.  Wisely, the film rarely makes moral judgments about the character; it merely records his activities, then allows us to size him up based on what we see.  The fluid handheld camera style employed by Audiard and cinematographer Stephanie Fontaine makes it feel as if the events were unfolding extemporaneously - that what we are witnessing is life caught on the cuff as it were.  The filmmakers also don't find it necessary to tie up every loose plot end or coddle us by taking the storyline where we in the audience think it should go.

""The Beat That My Heart Skipped"" would not be the success it is without the riveting performance by Romain Duris in the lead role.  He brings such an intensity of focus and so much nervous energy to the part of Thomas that we cannot take our eyes off him for the entire hour-and-a-half-plus that he is on screen.  He makes a morally ambiguous character both repugnant and strangely appealing at the same time.  This is one of the strongest acting jobs of the past several years, in a film that provides a rich character study along with much fine classical music.",1157328000,2,2761,4.783157894736842
2409425,4,B000B9EYFW,"Can someone who appears to be a conscienceless thug be redeemed through music? This movie raises various philosophical, psychological, and sociological (let's not get started on genetic) issues. Our protagonist (hero doesn't seem to be the right word) Romain makes his living dispossessing squatters from buildings in order that his remarkably unique real estate firm can sell them. His techniques would make a Mafioso blush. He has apparently learned his profession from his father whom he has to bail out of business difficulties by threatening to kill his father's clients.

By chance his interest in classical piano music is revived. His late mother was a concert pianist, and Romain himself was a child prodigy who stopped playing several years ago. A Vietnamese woman works with him to revive his skills.

Now the question is whether a seemingly soulless individual can be made soulful by losing himself in the beauty of music. History would indicate that this might be a difficult path to follow. The lives of famous artists are not always as beautiful as their art. The great painter Caravaggio is a good example, he having murdered at least one person during his life. Would Romain change if he became not only engrossed in music, but was also removed from his degraded environment? This is a variable that does not take place in the movie. Instead Romain continues with his repulsive day job, and retreats into a life of music at night. As time goes by you can see that these opposing life styles are causing him some mental stress.

Ultimately the director has to provide the answer for us. Is it possible to tame a wild wolf? Will an increasing immersion in the concert world bring out some hidden spirituality? Near the end of the movie director Audiard gives us that answer....or does he?",1154908800,,1802,4.901639344262295
2409426,5,B000B9EYFW,"This is an exceptional film, a wonderful tale of violence and spiritual redemption. The actions lead to a tension building climax. Romain Duris was superb by any measure in the lead role of Tom. Whereas the other reviewers do a super job of telling the storyline and comment upon the excellent cinematography and acting, I would like to point out that this is a wonderful retelling of the heroic myth of the Holy Grail and the Fisher King. I will give a Jungian interpretation of the film below:

Tom, the real-estate thug, is a modern Parsifal. Caught in a world of violence, he has tasted the Holy Grail, the spiritual window opened by classical piano, through his deceased mother. But he now lives in the world of the wounded Fisher King, his mobster father, ill and aging quickly. The world of the Fisher King is always in disarray, which is certainly the case of the world of Paris' low rent dumps and greedy slum lords. Tom and his father's world consist of making and breaking business deals, using insider information for real estate speculation, and driving squatters from deserted buildings. But in the search for the Holy Grail, Parsifal must integrate the feminine into his soul by laying beside his Anima, neither seducing her nor being seduced by her. Tom falls sexually twice in the film, seducing his business partner's wife and then a Russian mobster's girlfriend. But, the Chinese piano tutor becomes the Anima that is not seduced and does not seduce until his personality is integrated. He remains chaste with her until his spiritual task is completed.  The death of his father makes Tom the Fisher King and thus the corruption can end if Tom is able to fully integrate the feminine into his soul. This he does and he passes an ultimate test of revenge and forgiveness in the final minutes of the film. In the final scene, we see Tom, with bloody hands sit in the concert hall, watching his tutor play in concert, and we see in his bright and deep set eyes that he has been redeemed and made whole. A lovely re-telling of the classic myth of male emotional development.

If you are not a Jungian or have never studies Carl Jung, never fear, for the film is 100% excellent for its superb entertainment value alone.",1154217600,14,2232,4.674300254452926

2409428,4,B000B9EYFW,"""The Beat That My Heart Skipped"" brings together two threads of this moviegoer's interest, in that it pairs lead actor Romain Duris (from ""L'Auberge Espagnole"") with director Jacques Audiard (fresh off the amazing, unsurpassable ""Read My Lips"").  For admirers of Duris' winsome performance in 'Espagnole,' prepare for an altogether different viewing experience, as his portrayal as the manic, self-loathing, roiling Tom is about as different as you could possibly imagine.  Like in ""Read My Lips,"" Audiard's depiction of a seedy, nocturnal urban underbelly rules here.

Thankfully, Audiard gets 'Lips' protagonist Emanuelle Devos (surely one of the most compellingly unique actresses ever to grace a screen) to appear to a relatively minor role.  The movie belongs to the combination of Audiard and Duris though, with the director providing a storyline, setting and energy that propels Duris to rip through 107 minutes of searing, believeable intensity.

Still, given the option, this reviewer recommends you see ""Read My Lips"" first, followed afterwards by this one.",1149897600,3,1067,5.561728395061729

His mother was pianist, and he possessed talent although, he already left the practice of the instrument.

8083869,5,B000B9EYFW,"This movie has internal motivation to spare. It begins, riskily, as a tone poem, establishing that it has profound things on its mind ever so briefly before entering almost exposition-free into a world that's gritty and shadowy and yet also not, I think, trying to make any of the usual points of a 'gritty' story. At all. Rather we have a stealth neo-noir piece that comprehends the rhythms of nightlife better than almost any 'late hour caper' flick, and its strung along the high, darkly humourous wire of Romain Duris' incredible performance as Thomas. Visually, there is poetry rather than wit here, as night bleeds into night and Thomas finger-taps and headphone bobs his way from one unpleasant job to another, interlaced with scenes at bars and clubs where he might be with friends, might be getting into fistfights, and mostly looks like he just wants to hear his music. But rather than a 'brooding fellow likes to fight' portrait, we're not in the world noticing him, but in his head with him. Think of an upside-down world Baby Driver, where the editing is just as crucial, except here it has the nastier job of accentuating and empathizing with (but not condoning - see: That Ending...oof) masculine insecurity and misdirection. Scenes are cut short. Conversations slip under and above the ambient sounds. Natural light may or may not let us see all of Thomas, and he may or may not even seem interested in being in frame. Music ranges from pulsing ambient noise (and a great scene of Thomas letting his dad listen to his headphones) to empty-air whisps of echo-chamber piano notes, ringing like something from Kanye West's 'Runaway' era nightmares.

So that's the style, or something of it.

Plot-wise the story here is that of a young man with music in his heart and a lifestyle that is driving him crazy, a desperate need for paternal affection, maternal presence, and fights and fingers that are outlets for his tenderest and terrible(st) impulses. He is boyish and can be gentle and weak, reverting to these at the slightest sense of another person's parental authority or female attention. But he is also a brute, if a reluctant one.

There are elements you might expect from this description, the cover, or other blurbs which are not in fact very present in the film. Crime, though it forms the shell of the narrative, always feels barely there for me. Like it's the day job our protag has in an addiction story (his addiction in this case? Massive sentimentality. Also piano) where, important as it is, it's always more or less and intrusion.

Madness, also, I think is a stretch. This is not a descent into insanity tale. It's neither dark enough for that (thank god) nor normal enough for it. There is a perfectly rational, sweet, and approachable beating heart here. In fact the MOST sane part of it is the music-obsessed core, with Thomas up late listening to his mother's old tapes, spending his afternoons in the tutelage of his new piano instructor (in excellent, naturally-lit scenes that combine language, music, submission, and rare peace of mind in a way that is sexier than the film's sex-related scenes). Yes, he begins slipping from his ordinary pursuits, but considering that they had to do with his father's tawdry minor real estate mobstery, is that a bad thing? In a way, the sypmathies of the audience are reversed. It's a crime film where the crime is entirely unglamorous. But also not in-your-face awful. It's just nasty, briefly seen business that divides our lead from his pals and his family legacy. Driving him further into the arms of music, madness, and his need for love.

Here is a film that is unpredictable without making unpredictability its focus. That is alive and nervous and controlled. That has a heart for sound and the depth of epiphany that music can slide into our lives. A movie that provides us with a tense little hero without praising his anger or reveling in his smallness, but letting us watch as he - and the film - build up a quite, safe, poetic center in the midst of the storm, where Thomas not only hides in music, but trains, learns, and engages in sharing beauty.

There aren't many actors who can pull off the duality and tension in the life of Thomas, but Romain Duris is one of them. Thomas is embroiled in a violent occupation with violent business associates and we see him working his heart out to change his life, while his associates work to pull him back into it at every opportunity. It is very easy to identify with Thomas and want him to succeed, so the tension comes from the fact that we watch and can only hope with each passing violent scene that Thomas doesn't get injured or break his hands and destroy his chance to change his life.

Typically for screeners, there isn't a program menu.  There's no way to access any ""extras"" or ""supplements"" which are advertised on the DVD box itself (interviews, deleted scenes, etc.).

Once loaded, the movie begins immediately.  Every 10 or 12 minutes, a bold, white supertitle appears over the film's images stating ""PROPERTY OF WELLSPRING"".  It remains in place for 10 seconds or so.

This thriller features a thug doing strong-arm work for his personal real estate deals as well as for his slumlord father. You have to watch as he and his gang clear out tenants when their building is sold (it isn't pretty), and you also see his lowbrow father doing his own version of deal making.

The main thug, Thomas (Romain Duris) is ruthless and successful but he has a small crack in his faade, he has a weakness for classical music; his mother had encouraged him to play when he was a youngster (she was a famous pianist) and he had been scheduled to audition for her manager just before she died. When he encounters the manager years later, he is still willing to allow our ""hero"" to audition.

The audition is a painful failure and is abruptly terminated. Thomas finds a classical piano teacher who can rehearse him so he can try again. She is a recent immigrant from Thailand, who is an extremely well-trained and demanding taskmaster.

You watch as Thomas's life splits into three very different paths: His love for classical music; his real estate ""business""; and his father's selfish and unrelenting demands.

There are no familiar names or faces in this one, so it is easy to convince yourself that these people are real!

8083875,5,B000B9EYFW,"'De battre mon coeur s'est arrt&eacute;' ('The Beat that my Heart Skipped') is another superb and delicate character-driven film from French writer/director Jacques Audiard ('Read My Lips') and his collaborator Tonino Benacquista. How this director can take such potentially fragile subjects and create enormously powerful and indelible characters would indicate that he is one of cinema's truly important artists.

The story evolves as Thomas Seyr (Romain Duris) is seen as a member of a real estate scam working with smarmy associates who buy and sell buildings at the expense and eviction of poor tenants. The work is distasteful but Thomas is following the lead of his father Robert (Niels Arestrup), a man on the skids who depends on Thomas to do his 'collections'. Thomas loathes the work but is devoted to his rundown father. We discover that Thomas' mother, a former concert pianist, is dead when Thomas encounters his old piano teacher who urges him to practice despite his ten year absence from playing and to audition for a new career. A light of hope goes on in Thomas' psyche and he is lead to a Chinese immigrant pianist Miao Lin (Linh Dan Pham) who takes him on as a pupil to prepare him for his anticipated audition.

As Thomas practices, his world of crime does not abate and he is intermittently pulled away from his passion for the piano by his old partners as well as his father's continuing need for his 'dirty services'. He is torn between the life he has been leading and the promises of a career with his mother's (and his) passion for beauty in music. When the partition tenuously separating these dual lives is broken, Thomas struggles to find his way back to music. The ending is unexpected and keeps in step with the verismo of the screenplay.

Romain Duris is a major talent and delivers the kind of performance that indicates he is becoming a powerhouse of an actor. But the real star of the film is the director who knows how to relate a glimpse of a man's life in subtle, quiet ways despite the accompanying background of violence. It is a delicate balance and Jacques Audiard makes it work. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, April 12",1335484800,,2164,4.780748663101604
