8326856,5,B001NG41ZU,"I never really read the comic strip although I remember my dad taking about it - along with the very unusual character names.  Looking back, it amazes me how influencial the early comic strips were.  My dad would often call one of his grandkids a comic strip name.

If you like pleasant ""older"" movies that may make you giggle a little or just take you back to a time when things (and priorities) were slightly different than today, you may enjoy these.  If you would like to watch a little light hearted silliness...  well acted and produced...

What a bargain this VCI release is...  6 movies on 2 disks - all great transfers.  There are some ""extras"" also...",1253232000,5,661,4.5423728813559325
