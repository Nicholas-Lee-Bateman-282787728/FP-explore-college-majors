This is why I purchase the film to view it in its entirety but is cheapened for someone has determine to cut such material for viewing.  Is this not censorship?  Stop buying films that producers are trying to get more money but not deliver on the goods!",1402876800,4,436,4.166666666666667
8370693,4,B002I41KRS,"I will admit that this is not for everyone, but if you're on thinking about buying this, you probable are a fan of Monica Gayle, one of the many beautiful ladies who starred in questionable flicks in the 70's.

Apparently, this movie was presented as a Ingmar Bergman movie in Texas, I've never seen the original Bergman film, but I'm guessing this is a very pale copy of the story. Basically, Death comes to take a young lady (Monica Gayle) and she gets an extra day to fulfill her life. She then goes on a few random (naughty) adventures. It's basically a reason to showcase the beautiful features of own main protagonist.

As a Monica Gayle fan, I was happy to find that movie and I did enjoy it. It is strange, but not boring. SPOILER ALERT: I did not see the twist at the end coming.

If you're a Monica Gayle fan, get this movie, if you're looking for a silly nudie flick, skip it.

ps. The two original songs made for the movie are hilarious.",1391385600,3,949,4.344632768361582
8370694,4,B002I41KRS,"It was a cute film, I enjoyed a lot it all sort of connected toward a very nice ending. It was sort of a pg-13 movie",1389484800,,116,3.5
8370695,1,B002I41KRS,"I don't know. Somehow the description intrigued me so I went for it. Maybe there are some lessons to be learned in this movie but I gotta tell you it's pretty bad. Bad acting. Bad music. The only thing that could have saved this movie was if Woody Allen had played the part of Death. I looked the movie up on IMDb and it gets a 2.9 rating. That's out of 10!

So, why did I watch the whole thing? I'm home sick with a Kindle.",1362441600,2,424,3.9302325581395348
8370696,1,B002I41KRS,"Terrible acting, terrible camera work, terrible story.  Just the worst ever.  Total waste of my money.  Director should be ashamed.",1358899200,4,131,5.45
8370697,1,B002I41KRS,"That said, it must be watched from beginning to end for the pure sociological aspect of the seventies and the unintentional humorous fall down laughing lines and cinematography. (Dumb lines delivered in sincerity. Slow motion jumping up and down). If you enjoy making fun of bad movies, put this one in your must watch list.",1355961600,3,324,4.909090909090909
8370698,4,B002I41KRS,"First, the ""sticky"" stuff: I'm not certain if this film is in the public domain or not, so I can't comment about the legitimacy of this release.  I'll have to leave that to the legal scholars.

The DVD's image is better than I expected.  It's even letterboxed  somewhere between 1:66-1 and 1:85-1.  The color is slightly faded, but this film was originally shot on the cheap by low-budget filmmaker Larry Buchanan.

The film is about a beautiful young virgin, who is given one day to experience emotional and physical love before Death will claim her.  She meets three different men, one of whom becomes special to her.  It's a light drama which probably plays best to those who worship at the altar of Monica Gayle.  There is some nudity, but nothing heavy.  Filmed in 1970, the film is a perfect example of that era's softcore product.

Overall, the DVD is worth having, especially for Monica Gayle completists and softcore film enthusiasts.  Compared to a horrible-quality gray market copy that's been floating around for years, this new DVD is much better.  The only downside is that the DVD is missing about two minutes of footage from one of the softcore sequences, as though the previous owner of the master print deleted some footage for his ""private collection.""  There are a few stray markings such as print scratches that further indicate that the new DVD may have been struck from a pretty good 16mm print.",1257206400,21,1418,4.7818930041152266
