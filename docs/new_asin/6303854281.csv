742203,1,6303854281,"This was disgusting! The storyline [stunk] because, lets face it, there was no story just a girl who looked like a 13 year old having sex with someone like 30 years older than her! AHHHH! And other things along that line. But, as usual, Alan Rickman, no matter how much I hated the movie, is a great actor. And Hugh Grant was good too. But not good enough to make me watch all of this disgusting and repulsive gibberish of a movie.",1024272000,8,431,4.2682926829268295
742204,4,6303854281,"Oh, my. This film is eye candy for Rickman fans, but the ending might disturb some. I was captivated by this film, rather as one is glued to the tube, watching, with fascination, plane crashes and train wrecks. Although the film is a fine ensemble work, with excellent performances all around, the fulcrum is Rickman's character, O'Hara. That's not a surprise, as Alan Rickman draws focus in any role he takes on. In this odd film, Rickman's character goes from the cat-bird seat to his own little Hell, and it's no surprise that this gifted actor brings so much humanity and range to the part. Many days after seeing the video, I'm still haunted by O'hara, especially the first bedroom scene where he has a brief laughing fit. I deem any film that highjacks my consciousness like that a success. This film's success is 98% due to the the fine acting of Alan Rickman.",1021593600,23,867,4.636363636363637
742205,5,6303854281,"This film is one of my all-time favorites, as is the novel upon which it is based. Its language, the skill of its actors, its twist, everything is magical and captivating. Most definitely a surprise, and a time worthily spent watching.",1012348800,2,235,4.7560975609756095
742206,4,6303854281,"I highly recommend this excellent adaptation of Bainbridge's dark, quirky novel.  Georgina Cates plays the starstruck Stella with exactly the right combination of yearning naivete and matter-of-fact aloofness.  Alan Rickman is mesmerizing as legendary actor O'Hara and happily is able to attract great sympathy during what might otherwise easily be regarded as a grotesque courtship of the teenage actress.  And Hugh Grant as the odious Meredith is an extremely convincing villain - it's hard to imagine more of a departure from his usual endearing mumbler, but he pulls off this role with great aplomb.  Warning: focusing as it does on a young girl's loss of innocence and the unglamorous underbelly of theatre, this film is for mature audiences only.",980035200,42,752,5.294117647058823
742207,5,6303854281,"The first time that I watched this movie, I thought it was a bit odd.  After watching it a few more times, I started catching on to the meaning of the plot and characters.  Though I would not recommend it for young  children, I think it has both political and social overtones which show the  viewer more about the things that went on during World War II.",945302400,6,355,4.253731343283582
742208,3,6303854281,"The actors in this movie are what drew me to it.  Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman are two of my favorite performers.  To see them in a movie about the theatre, well I couldn't resist.
The film starts out as a lovely  coming-of-age film about a young woman's first experience in theatre.
What it turns into about two thirds of the way through is a sad, sordid  tale of incest, suicide and denial.  It's as if the writers suddenly  started smoking something while they were trying to finish the  script.
The performances in the film are worth sitting through it.  Georgina Cates who plays Stella, the central character, is quite good.
Alan Rickman is wonderful as always as the dashing matinee idol on his  way to being washed up.
The great delight is Hugh Grant as a snotty,  prissy summer stock director.  It's probably the most over-the-top I've  seen him and I loved it.
I was surprised to see this listed as a comedy,  but not sure where else you'd put it.  It's a tough movie to pin down.
Not a movie for everyone, but it is a guilty pleasure for those of us  who would watch Alan Rickman read the phone book.",924048000,47,1109,4.394088669950739

7857299,5,6303854281,"Alan Rickman makes this movie.  At first I thought it was not going to be very good.  When P.L. O'Hara (Rickman) enters the picture, things pick up.  Had to watch it once with the subtitles as I had a little difficulty understanding some of Uncle Vernon's remarks.  But once you understand what is being said,  and knowing how it ends,  it's really a very good movie.  And second and subsequent viewings, Alan Rickman's acting and facial expressions are much better understood and appreciated.  What a fine actor.",1506297600,,513,4.816091954022989
7857300,3,6303854281,"The DVD arrived very timely after I ordered it. The case is in perfect condition. I have not watched the entire movie, but what I have watched of it, the DVD works fine. I am finding the movie boring and I keep falling asleep while watching it.",1342483200,,244,4.212765957446808
7857301,4,6303854281,"Like others have said, I was surprised that it was not a light-hearted comedy and disappointed that Alan Rickman's character doesn't arrive until halfway through; but it was wonderfully cast and though very disturbing, I feel it needs to watched again.",1200614400,,252,5.170731707317073
7857302,5,6303854281,"This movie, at it's core is about OBSESSION, and how it can corrupt any life from functioning healthily. Every character in this film is obsessed WITH someone whether currently or in the past, and the theatre world is the perfect place in which this disease can  burgeon  and play itself to it's hilt! The film teaches that playing make-believe is one of the most subtlely dangerous paths that a person with obsession-disorder can enter. This is a film that may need to be viewed several times. First,whatever dvd or vhs spoilers tell you,THIS IS NOT A COMEDY!!!There is litlle that is ""warmhearted..hilarious..comedic"" (WHAT CRITICS WROTE THIS???) In fact,this is a cleverly crafted tragedy of the highest sort with references to PETER PAN and RICHARD III and even the famous Irish Ballad THE LAST ROSE OF SUMMER all entwined in this incredibly acted and constructed screenplay by Charles Wood extracted from the Beryl Bainbridge novel.

Other reviewers have explained much of the storyline,so I will forego that. What I will say is that because the story is SO multi-character laden in a plot where EVERY WORD,SONG and STAGE REFERENCE is a clue to solving this intriguing and provocative story, it is probably best to watch this on DVD with subtitles. A group of us rewatched this film three times in a row,stopping and rewinding to catch the words being said. The accents are Irish,English and Scottish,high and low,and to this American ear much was lost on the first viewing. After the second and third time around I was totally blown away by this multi-layered gem. To get it all in,it DOES help to be familiar with English literature,theatre and,in this particular case, dialects!

Hugh Grant fans and detracters will be QUITE surprised at his performance. It is very much a departure from his other Mike Newell directed film FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL.

Alan Rickman plays a VERY tragic and sullen/aging Lothario who has been haunted by the memory of a long lost love. His outstanding work in SENSE AND SENSIBILTY came to mind.

Georgina Cates could not have given a finer performance as the disturbed Stella Bradshaw.

Trivia buffs may note the acting presence of a much older Rita Tushingham,who played Lara and Yuri's love-child in DR.ZHIVAGO,as Stella's Aunt. As Stella's Uncle,Alun Armstrong was the original Master of the house in LES MISERABLES:THE MUSICAL.

In conclusion,what started out for me very confusing has left a MOST lasting impression upon me. That IMO is the hallmark of an excellently executed work. 5* is just simply NOT enough.",1170028800,8,2558,4.988262910798122
7857303,4,6303854281,"shows the innocence and naivete of teens until someone takes it away from them.

young stella is infatuated with the quite handsome but gay(unknown to her despite all the very obvious signs and outright displays) director.

eners the aging but always dashingly sexy mr rickman, runored to have gotten a local girl pregnant some years ago in this town, surrounded by women his own age who seemingly would do anything to get him to give them a second look. but, alas, his sights are set on the 16 year old virgin who doesn't equate sex with love but as a way to fit in with the world and people of the theater.

the ending is extremely sad and one wonders if stella will hold herself resposible for the cruel fate of rickman and how this will affect her ability to establish ""healthy"" relationships in her future. luckily, it appears she will never know the dark secret her lover takes to his grave.",1137542400,6,897,4.5246913580246915
7857304,5,6303854281,"I first saw An Awfully Big Adventure on TV at two o'clock in the morning.  It made very little sense, and I couldn't understand about a third of what was being said, but the movie still, as another reviewer succinctly put it, ""hijacked my consciousness.""  It was subtle, honest, unforgiving, amazingly well-acted, and a lot of other good things that I can't find the words for right now.
I recently purchased a copy of the video, and realize now that while it loses nothing upon further viewing, An Awfully Big Adventure benefits greatly from a second watching.  The dialogue becomes clearer the more you listen to it and the nuances of the characters and the story become more pronounced.  Even though my first reaction to the film was favorable, I still think that one cannot judge this movie fairly after only seeing it once (although if you enjoyed it the first time, you probably will again).  I have a feeling that nearly all of the reviews here are by first-time watchers, and while you shouldn't entirely discredit their remarks, keep in mind that, like most complex movies, An Awfully Big Adventure only gets better the more you watch it.
I also feel that it cannot be stressed enough that this is not a happy, uplifting movie.  ""Disturbing"" is a word used often to describe it, but the word that comes to my mind is ""uncomfortable.""  There's really nothing at the end of the film to redeem all of the sadness, as is common in most movies.  Thus, if you don't like to watch depressing movies, DON'T WATCH AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURE.  And if you're an Alan Rickman or Hugh Grant fan (both of whom are great) and insist upon seeing it, don't write a review that discourages others from watching it just because it was too dark for your tastes.
*I haven't read the novel of the same title by Beryl Bainbridge, but I've heard that it helps to clarify the confusing points in the movie, besides being a good book.  Just a thought...",1079308800,30,1934,4.59593023255814
7857305,4,6303854281,"First and foremost, I want to state that this is NOT a comedy.  The summary on the back of the box, describing it as ""hilarious,"" ""warmhearted,"" and so forth, reads as though it was written by somebody who never saw the movie.  It is about as much of a comedy as Hamlet is a go-kart race.
That said, it is a super film.  Set in 1947, the story centers on sixteen-year-old Stella Bradshaw, who has lost her mother in the war and lives with her aunt and uncle.  Stella joins an amateur theatre company and falls instantly in love with the company's slimeball of a director, Meredith Potter.  It doesn't take long for her to be lured into the milieu's seedy underbelly, and eventually she has her first (and second and third...) sexual encounter with P.L. O'Hara, star of the company's production of ""Peter Pan"".
The end of the movie will certainly be found disturbing and/or sad by most (hence my omission of the fifth star in rating the movie), but it's still worth watching - most likely more than once, so you can start to fill in the details you might have missed before.  (There's a whole lot of information packed into this plot, and it's very easy to let stuff slip by!)
The cast, of course, is wonderful.  Georgina Cates is well cast as Stella, and very pretty too.  Her characterization of the shy, unsure-of-herself girl is engaging and well thought out.  (She looks about twelve until a scene where we see her topless.  Then the illusion is pretty much shattered.) Alan Rickman, as P.L. O'Hara, is great as usual.  The big surprise here for me was Hugh Grant's performance as Meredith Potter.  He is actually playing a character here - and a nasty one at that.  That alone is worth watching the movie!  The supporting cast is terrific as well.  It was fun to see such first-rate actors bringing such life to such teeny roles (for example, Edward Petherbridge, who has all of approximately fifteen seconds onscreen).
To sum up, An Awfully Big Adventure - though certainly disturbing in places - is an awfully good film.",1076544000,16,2027,4.607242339832869
7857306,5,6303854281,"This is another in a long line of films I have viewed solely to enjoy Alan Rickman's performance, and what a performance; but more about that later.
Having read all the Amazon reviewers' comments and a multitude of professional critics' articles I was still unable to get a sense of this film.  The plot was somewhat clear, some reviewers having given away the ending (shame on them and what a shame), but the true atmosphere of the film still eluded me.  Frankly, I couldn't convince myself this was a film I would enjoy.  Having now viewed this unusual but very interesting film, I find that nothing prepared me for what it truly was about and what it had to offer as real entertainment.
Lest I reveal more of the plot than I intend, I will instead stick mostly to my point and say that Alan Rickman is an actor of absolutely unbelievable talent.  I say this after every film; he selects the widest range of roles of any actor, and he never gives a less than perfect + performance.  His Captain Hook and O'Hara are sublime characters.  He looks fantastic in both roles, of course.  Again we get to see him dance, not the tango this time, but variety is the spice of his work.  The love scenes, and I feel comfortable identifying them as 'love', because his character displays a sense of love despite his shallow nature; and also exhibits a desperate need for love that would be difficult to believe in this particular character if it were portrayed by a lesser actor.  His comic reactions have perfect timing and his emotional reactions display feelings that overwhelm and pale the efforts of every other character in the film.  This is a considerable feat because this film offers an usual, but solid, performance by Hugh Grant; a side of his talent I had not previously seen and which proved very intriguing.  Georgina Cates as Stella, the naive young girl struggling to find both herself and her past, is flawless.  She wears her feelings as open as a book on her sweet young face and states her thoughts as directly (and comically) as any adolescent innocent would.  Apparently it is like learning the ukulele.

This film is not a comedy; if it were not British, there probably would have been no humor at all.  The British it seems have a way of inserting their own manner of dry wit and humor into the most serious of situations without ever losing their direction.  Perhaps I have been viewing too many English films of late; as I had no trouble with the accents and understood every word clearly.
There are other reviewers here who have certainly bested my efforts at describing Rickman's attraction in this film, as I think unfortunately my statements certainly fail to do justice to the work he does in 'An Awfully Big Adventure'.  I continue to owe him thanks for the unusual scope of entertainment genres I have explored just because I am so awed by his abilities and do not want to miss of minute of an opportunity to watch him work.  Others also have provided more of the plot and I too have fallen short of explaining the true nature of the film.  All I am left to hope for is that I can  encourage any fans of Rickman's or movie-lovers who enjoy the unusual, and who have not yet viewed this film, to get themselves a copy of this rare video and see just what the 'awfully big adventure' is truly all about.  I think you will be awfully glad you did.",1073174400,17,3368,4.524752475247524
7857307,4,6303854281,"Ok, I wouldn't have wathed it, if it didn't have Alan Rickman. One sees his acting so little, Harry Potter -movies really are a waste of time for people like me, who appreciate the fine adult actors in them - and see them only briefly.
Again Alan Rickman has a difficult part and comes in late in the movie. But what the heck: the movie isn't bad. And Hugh Grant can be really sleezy! I can't tell how much I enjoyed his sexually vague, self-centered director. And Georgina Cates is really wonderful. She is the one that makes this a comedy. Stella (Cates) is so determined to become a real actress, that she hangs on every word the director says and writes down his pseudo-artistic ponderings - which he himself doesn't believe after he's said them. She worships even his nicotine-stained fingers, starts wearing a hidden cross after hearing all in the theatre are catholics - she is a protestant - and fakes a venerial disease, because everyone seems to have sex with everything that moves - except her. So she decides to get rid of her virginity as soon as possible.
Rickman enters in a scene that seems to be designed for someone like him, who can hold your attention without speaking or doing anything, just looking. He walks through the theatre, people come and talk to him, say things to him... He hardly stops or opens his mouth. The director isn't happy to have him back, but everyone agrees, that no one can play Captain Hook like he can, so he is invited to join the cast. Again: Captain Hook: who else? Rickman is the villain we love. And the glimpses of Hook are really delicious. It made me again think, how people send different messages, even professional actors playing the same part. When Grant does the Hook, the children are sitting silently, filled with suspence, even fear, whereas Rickman's Hook makes them laugh out loud. Of course it's been directed that way, but it has some truth in it.
I would also like to mention Alun Armstrong, uncle Vernon, who is always good, in this movie also.
And then... In case you haven't read other reviews: this is not an easy film to watch, even though it's at times very funny. Even though Stella almost demands Rickman's character to take her, it isn't always comfortable to watch their relationship. Even though Cates turns out some comedy in it and some kind of real love seems to be budding between them. And the end is tragic, though it didn't come to me as a big surprise after Rickman said - first seeing Cates -: ""I know her."" So I was pretty much aware of the real tragedy, but was still touched by the unnecessarily sad solution.
This isn't a feel-good movie. But it's a damn good one and I do like stories that unfold slowly to let you know bit by bit how things really are and where you thought wrong. But no, this really isn't easy. I suppose I should have expected it. When does Rickman play easy parts?",1067990400,46,2877,4.513409961685824
