321004,4,6301115880,"i was kind of disappointed with this movie. we have a ritual of watching old movies during the thanksgiving holiday when i go to visit my sister. we'd heard about this movie and i purchased it to include in our viewing line-up.  well, it wasn't what i expected; however, i cannot say it was a bad movie.  i just thought it would be meatier like ""a letter to 3 wives.""  i would not want to discourage anyone else from getting this movie because rating a movie is subjective and perhaps i was expecting too much.",1364342400,,510,4.347368421052631
321005,4,6301115880,"I saw this movie over 30 years ago while in college on late night TV and could not remember the name. I discovered it recently, bought it and it was as good as I recalled it was. i was afraid that I had built it up too much in my mind over the years. It never was Oscar worthy but it definitely made an impact on me back then.",1356566400,,326,3.739130434782609
321006,1,6301115880,"G.D. Geroux is quite right, I also would buy it if it had Subtitles. I mentioned this a lot of times already, but it seems the companies are not really interested
in what people say. Besides that, there are a lot of people who cannot hear properly or are deaf. I think theIR life would be better if they could also see a beloved movie with SUBTITLES.",1350518400,7,350,4.2388059701492535
321007,5,6301115880,"I have always liked this movie and have been looking for it a couple of years; glad it has finally been released. It has been under the radar, but I think deserves more notice than it has received. The three women are each afraid to have their ""secret"" revealed. Eleanor Parker had a boyfriend in the Army (I believe played by Arthur Franz) who goes away and, presumably, gets killed. Ruth Roman and Patricia Neal each have equally sad stories revolving around their ""secrets."" Patricia Neal is a well-renowned reporter who travels to the mountaintop to cover the story. All the reportors hole up in a closed-for-the-season resort, and that is where the movie action takes place, in flashbacks. In one scene in the movie, two of the mothers-to-be actually share the same doctor's waiting room. Of course, they don't know each other.  This is a good little movie with a good big cast. By the way, I liked Ruth Roman's story the best.",1347148800,7,932,4.682926829268292
321008,4,6301115880,"An interesting tale and an early directorial effort from Robert Wise.  When a young boy is the sole survivor of a mountain plane crash, three women begin to wonder if he's the child each gave up for adoption.  While waiting for the news, the women all look back on their lives.  We discover the reasons behind their decisions to give their sons up, and what their lives have been like up to this point.  This is similar in some ways to the plot device used in A Letter to Three Wives, which also deals with the pasts of three women, however this film is much more somber in tone.  It doesn't have the crackling, witty dialogue, which made Wives so memorable.  The suspense is quite good, with all three stars doing excellent work here.  It's fun seeing Eleanor Parker, Patricia Neal, and Ruth Roman  all of whom would go on to be major stars during the 1950s; it's a wonderful showcase for their dramatic talents.  If you like films with good character studies, Three Secrets is for you.",977097600,20,987,4.5

Key scenes with crucial plot details were skipped and just prior to the climactic scene and movie's end, the movie just ended! Such a disappointment.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Secrets/dp/B008NNSCKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Secrets</a>",1503100800,,393,7.7555555555555555
7810399,5,6301115880,"I remember watching this movie on regular TV many years ago.  I liked the suspense & acting so much I started taping it, but we know how much of a TV movie is lost to commercials.  I especially enjoyed Ruth Roman's & Ted DeCorsia's performances.  One eye-opening aspect was the attitude towards unmarried women who became pregnant at the time this movie was made - it was horrible & shameful.  Now, women do it intentionally.  My....how times change!",1501286400,,450,4.717948717948718

7810402,5,6301115880,"It's a great movie! If you like Eleanor Parker, Patricia Neal, and Ruth Roman you'll love it too. The three of them ARE the movie. The director is Robert Wise (The Sound of Music, West Side Story) - you can imagine what his direction and the talent of the three actresses contribute for this wonderful film. In black and white, what for me, make the movie memorable.",1424908800,,366,4.477611940298507
7810403,5,6301115880,The DVD was great quality.  I liked the movie.  I am an Eleanor Parker fan.  I enjoyed the story.  Patricia O Neal broke up the scenes with her flavor of color.  She was great in this.  I did not know she could play a tough roll.,1397606400,,229,3.869565217391304
7810404,5,6301115880,"Been waiting for them to release this on DVD for years. Not disappointed. Clean, Clear Crisp print. Toally enjoyable.
With 3 top Actresses all in great form. Parker and Neal Always underated and Roman was always good but Warners put her in a lot of B's. This is a must have title.",1395360000,,280,4.403846153846154
7810405,5,6301115880,Excellent movie. Eleanor Parker is good. Ruth Roman is good. BUT Pat O'Neal is excellent. If this doesn't touch you I don't know what will... I have remembered this movie all these years and couldn't believe it when I saw it on DVD. Had to own it. This is a story that has been re-made but the re-makes never touched this version. Such a joy to see some of the older movies out on DVD.,1393459200,,385,4.1466666666666665
7810406,5,6301115880,I had the newer version and wanted to see if the original was as good and thankfully I loved both versions of the DVD's.,1393027200,,120,4.041666666666667
7810407,5,6301115880,"Ruth Roman, Patricia Neal and Eleanor Parker give sterling performances in this Warner Bros. noir whose ending will surprise you!  Yes, it may be more of a woman's noir film, not as thrilling as MILDRED PIERCE, but emotionally moving just the same.  See it!
