927385,1,6304610408,"Poor old Alf says he kept quiet about his Beatles involvement from 1966 to 1989. It's a pity he didn't leave it that way.
This video is so poorly directed and edited that it is not clear whether you are in Liverpool, London or USA at any given time.
Alf MUST have had some interesting memories from three years with The Fabs, but they're not recorded here ... John pinched a bottle of milk, there was a large crowd at Shea Stadium etc.
At least half the footage is filled with Alf plodding along a street somewhere, plus many clips from Paul's world tour. (Relevance? Alf went to one concert and Paul spoke to him...)
Most of the anecdotes are rehashed (George Harrison didn't like George Martin's tie) and there is little here to interest even a serious Beatles fan.
Spend your money elsewhere!",999475200,5,795,4.527777777777778
927386,1,6304610408,"Don't even consider buying this crap. Alf is trying so hard to cash in on  the Beatles, it is rediculous. Alf retells his really pointless stories  while the viewer looks at crappy stock footage. You get to see Paul solo  for a few minutes but that's about it. I am a die hard Beatles fan who  thought there wasn't any bad Beatles related merchandise. This video proved  me wrong.",968716800,12,380,4.449275362318841
7877499,1,6304610408,"A clich to say ""I wish I could give this NO stars"" so I don't. But this glorified driver does drivel on. He obviously wants us believing how tight he was with history that that is how he comes across: desperate. All of his ""recollections"" are perfectly recalled from his vivid imagination. Good for him. Unfortunately for him, reality is even MORE perfect.
Buy this for a good hearty chuckle or two thousand. It's a real scream.",1497916800,,428,4.571428571428571
7877500,3,6304610408,"If you are a Beatles fan this is an interesting dvd.  However, it's pretty low budget and Alf's stories are pretty low brow. However, there are a few bits that make it a good dvd for the avid fan.",1258588800,,196,4.0256410256410255
7877501,1,6304610408,This is an absolute piece of garbage not even worth the materials used to make it.  I give it a negative 10,1111622400,3,107,3.8636363636363638
7877502,1,6304610408,"Its a 1 star rating only because I couldn't give it zero stars. A horrible home-made video with extremely low production values. I have the VHS version - recorded in EP mode! - and I'd say the signal to noise ratio is about 1:1. The video has nothing for a Beatle fan of any type. Dull, insipid yarns from the one-time Beatles limo driver. You have been warned - AVOID THIS PRODUCT!",1110672000,5,382,4.319444444444445
7877503,2,6304610408,"This DVD is OK in the information dept. Lots of re-hashing of the age-old Beatle tail, but this fellow was there for a chunk of it all. Drove them around, brought them their dinner, runner- go-fer, drove them up to met Elvis. On the sideline but a fairly interesting side and your glad he survived it, some didn't. His tour of Liverpool is quaint and silly but it's the most I've seen of the place in one sitting. This DVD also obviously has a fairly large endorsement by McCartney. He's let Alf use segments of his solo music as background as well as snippets from what looks like early 90's live footage. Pretty nice of Paul helping out his old driver. I would recommend this to the more hardcore fans to add to your library.",1104710400,3,727,4.392592592592592
7877504,1,6304610408,"Examples:

""*I* was there! I drove them home! I kept them safe!""

""Here is the corssing at Abbey Road. Thousands of people have walked across it and now I am going to walk across it."" <camera follows him walking across Abbey Road>

""John, Paul, George and Ringo, I pledge my loyalty to you, always.""

It really is that bad! I wish I could rate this one a negative star.",1093737600,3,369,4.304347826086956
7877505,3,6304610408,"3 1/3 for sure.  I'll tell you what, for the insider it is a very interesting Video,  He tells lots of stories of The Beatles, Mal Evans & Neil Aspinal themselves, Maybe he was trying to make a buck, But I would pay to sit and listen to a road manager tell their stories as well as I paid this bloke, tell his, which were pretty good
Like the story where he didn't strap down a Banjo correctly and John says if you find the banjo you'll get a bonus or when a police man thought Alf Bicknell stole The Beatles car and Alf had John Lennon step out of the car and the policeman just walked away dumbfounded & many more. I think it was interesting for those who like the inside story's, Yes no real Beatles music but it's a great video
But don't take my word for it, YOU GOTTA SEE IT.

7877506,4,6304610408,"I've been a Beatles fan since '67, but had never heard of Alf Bicknell until a friend sent me a VHS copy of this. I think it's great to hear Alf's recollections of his time with the Fabs and to see the actual places that played a role in their lives.  I never knew that Johnny Cash met the lads until I watched the video. Alf seems like a great guy and I hope he releases more things like this.",1071878400,,394,3.925
7877507,1,6304610408,"I was given the VHS of this title several years ago.
It's got nothing much to offer the avid Beatle fan. Some trivial stories and uninspired vignettes from The Beatles' former chauffeur.
I guess he needed some quick $$$.",1065744000,2,220,4.666666666666667
7877508,2,6304610408,"Before you see this DVD you will be asking the QUESTION: ""Who is Alf Bicknell""?  After you see this DVD you will be asking the QUESTION: ""Who cares about Alf Bickenell?""  For TWO-YEARS good old Alf was the Beatles' DRIVER and ROAD MANAGER!  Thrilling, huh?  You get to see a party with the ROLLING STONES!  You get to see the BEATLES in the studio and on the road!  But every once in a while there is some ORIGINAL FOOTAGE by PAUL McCARTNEY!  That has to be worth something!  But you also get a lame interactive TRIVIA section!  If you are an absolutely die-hard BEATLES FAN and you have NOTHING ELSE in the world to buy about the FAB FOUR, then you can pick up this one!  Otherwise, since you already know who ALF BICKNELL is, why bother?",1003276800,4,739,4.328467153284672
