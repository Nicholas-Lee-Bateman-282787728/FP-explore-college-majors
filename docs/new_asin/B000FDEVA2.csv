2561343,2,B000FDEVA2,"I'm a total Robin Williams fan and immediately added this to my playlist to watch, but was so disappointed.  The movie started off a bit slow and the storyline sways around a bit.  As you can see in the movie summary itself its about a man who has a wife which appears to have a mental imbalance and needs money for meds.  Problem I had was there were assumptions that she was faking it and we never got the answer if she was sick or not.  Seemed like the movie was patched piece to keep a plot going.  Sad, sad, sad.

For starring a few A rated actors the director surely didn't have a good story line to keep me awake, although I stayed with it to the end in hopes it would have gotten better.  It didn't.

So this is fare warning for those reading my reviews I'm giving you a choice to save yourself time in your life to watch/read or do something else.  :(

Maybe I just missed the entire plot line itself and may have the courage to give it another whirl.",1499299200,,960,4.112903225806452

A down and out businessman scams his insurance company out of 1,000,000 dollars so his sick wife can get help. Well, have you ever heard about Medicaid! That's what they do, help poor people get medical treatment. No need to scam insurance companies, get beat up, commit a felony, freeze half to death and then half your dimwit brother murder your wife, Holly Hunter.

And....this one. I have never cared much for Robin Williams, I never really thought he was funny, just annoying...and manic. However, he was exceptional in this movie, and I belly laughed a few times! SPOILER ALERT: I was laughing so hard, I about peed myself when he was trying to shoot his brother.

Dark and strangely quirky, this movie has some redeeming moments, but doesn't have enough power to carry the plot to a satisfying conclusion. Just OK, not great.",1412380800,,438,4.9324324324324325

2561381,4,B000FDEVA2,"When you start watching The Big White, you get a sense of a movie that aspires to be very Coen Bros.  Convoluted story, strange characters, snippy, hilarious dialogue.  Coen Brothers it is not, but close, very, very close.  Great cast with Robin Williams, Holly Hunter, Giovanni Ribisi, Woody Harrelson and Tim Blake Nelson.

Paul Barnell (Robin Williams) is a struggling Travel Agent in Alaska, trying to cash in his missing brother's insurance policy to get ahead.  When the insurance company denies the claim since there is no body, Paul is worried since he is havily in debt and searching for a cure for his wife's apparent bout with Tourette's Syndrome.  Along come a couple of hitmen and dump a body into the dumpster out in front of Paul's failing business.  By accident Paul discovers the body and he comes up with a plan.  Staging several clues to his missing brother's return, Paul covers the body in bacon and stages a death scene.  When the body is discovered, partially eaten by animals, with his brother's identification on it, the insurance must finally pay out.  Only several problems,  Paul's brother (Woody Harrelson) shows back up.  The hitmen come back to retrieve their body.  An insurance clerk (Giovanni Ribisi) with a nose for fraud is in the case.

The Big White is entertaining and ridiculous.  Holly Hunter is hilarious as the filthy-mouthed wife.  Williams is just serious enough here so his performance is more visceral than funny.  Overall, like I said before, this feels like a Coen movie. And that's a good thing.  It misses here and there but you won't notice much.  It will remind you of Fargo.  And that is also a good thing.  Worth the watch.

Dig it!",1412121600,,1687,4.784722222222222
2561382,4,B000FDEVA2,"I have been watching Robin Williams films back to back and this is my latest one. I was particularly curious about this one because in the interviews right before his death, he says that it was while making this film he went off the rails again. After twenty years of sobriety, when he arrived in Alaska to make this film, he started drinking Jack Daniels. He didn't stop until there was a family intervention and he ended up back in rehab and wife #2 divorced him. He was never quite well again and this was followed by heart surgery, other drinking relapses and towards the end Parkinson's. I have never seen Williams so sad as he was in playing this role. I know he was a terrific actor but this sadness almost seems like too much for the part. His sadness here borders on the heartbreaking.

In watching his films back to back, I have also been stunned to find how many of them involve a scene about suicide. In this one his wife threatens suicide and they have a discussion about suicide and about how much he loves her and doesn't want to lose her. His wife is played by Holly Hunter and she is nowhere near as sad as Williams in this film yet she is characterized as the suicidal one. Williams always improvised on the script a great deal and I am wondering if suicide scenes or discussion of suicide scenes weren't added by him to the screenplay. There are just way too many of these in film after film not to wonder who put them there.

So if you are considering watching this film for the outrageous, comic Williams, he is not here. He is a very subdued, quiet, at his wit's end character and it is everyone who is around him who is darkly madcap instead. These include Holly Hunter, Woody Harrelson, Tim Blake Nelson and Giovanni Ribisi, all of whom are top notch actors in fine form here.

Some compare this film to ""Fargo"" but at the heart of it that film had the beleaguered but murderous and unloving Jerry (William H. Macy) who has absolutely nothing in common with this Robin Williams character. The Williams character here is sweet, loving and verging on the pathetic as he is almost crushed by the load he is carrying. I suspect the reason this went straight to video with no theatrical release is that the producers upon seeing the final cut of the film were horrified. Williams was supposed to be the world's most outstanding comic starring at the center of a black comedy movie. Instead he was ""playing"" a tragic figure, beset on all sides by forces beyond his control. It's as if he's playing Hamlet while the rest of the cast is playing in something else which somewhat resembles ""Fargo.""

Does it work? If you consider it as one movie playing within another movie, then yes it does.  There is Williams letting us see the starkness underlying his comic persona and that self just happens to be acting in a movie which is a black comedy. It is like being in your car on the highway and you are stopped in traffic, watching them clear off the road because there's been a horrific car crash. You can't look away because the tragedy is so compelling. If you are looking for a night of escapist fun with Williams though, this movie is NOT it.

2561403,5,B000FDEVA2,"It's not confusing, but elements keep popping up and scrambling all you think is happening. Robin Williams is 'way away from what you expect of him. Yes, funny, but profound in a staccato of unexpected happenings which I'm still sorting through. The closest kind
of movie to this is FARGO, in the scramble of expectations and great slamming together of the talents of Williams, Woody Harelson, Holly Hunter and the rest of the ensemble cast. Gotta give credit to Tim Blake Nelson and Alison Lohman, who've I seen before and
never appreciated so much.

The scripting is over the hill, smart and crazy and flipped me every which way. It could be the most memorable movie I've seen this year. Okay, it's just February, but it might as well be December. Williams stirs the funny with sentimental and scary and macabre.

I give seven stars to films I can see and re-see again and again.
This one might be an eight star flick. See it with a friend and argue
about it for days.

And the price of this gem is a pitance; used, $.01 or new, $1.99; it will be the best entertainment you can find and puzzle over and finally get and grin for days. It's made for smart, unconventional audiences. In the first minutes you are lulled; then slammed up against a variety of walls. The pace quickens and never stops. I'm amazed it didn't get a Sundance award for brilliance. (Maybe it did?)

I'm risking raving for the kind of a movie you've never seen before and probably never see again.  See it, you'll see.",1391299200,,1492,4.5315985130111525

I'm not sure why I watched this. I'm not a fan of either Robin Williams or Giovanni Ribisi but this works. Some of the other reviewers give a good description of the movie so I won't.  Basically Robin is trying to commit insurance fraud and Giovanni is trying to catch him. Two hit men complicate their lives.

I would watch this again and I hope it is available soon as an Instant Video.",1336089600,,513,4.425531914893617
2561412,4,B000FDEVA2,"Yep, it gets cold in Alaska.  And it snows alot, too.  Place a dark comedy in such a stark environment and not only does it work, it works wonderfully.  (As it did in the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fargo/dp/B00009W5CA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fargo</a>, although I hesitate to compare the two.)  Throw a near-bankrupt travel agent who finds a body in a dumpster and decides to file a fraudulent life insurance claim on his long-lost brother, the agent's problematic wife, two inept mob wannabes, and a determined insurance adjuster who ain't buying the travel agent's story into this icebox, and you've got THE BIG WHITE, as offbeat as a stripeless zebra, yet still quirky and humorous enough to tickle most funny bones.

The performances in this flick make the dark comedy work, with Robin Williams surprisingly restrained and somber as the travel agent, and Holly Hunter delightful as his zany wife--a lady who thinks she has Tourette's Syndrome.  Tim Blake Nelson and W. Earl Brown are hysterical as the pseudo thugs who try to get the body back by kidnapping the Hunter character, and Giovanni Ribisi is most convincing as the suspicious adjuster on a mission to make a name for himself and get transferred the heck out of the Frozen North.  As a bonus we get to enjoy Alison Lohman playing Ribisi's semi-psychic girlfriend, and Woody Harrelson as the long-lost brother who blows in to demand a piece of his brother's action.  The roles are delivered with tongue-in-cheek deadpan, and it's as funny as it is dysfunctional.  A dark comedy like THE BIG WHITE can't help but deliver an outrageous, over-the-top ending, and it does, but it won't take away its inherent appeal and irresistible charm to those who like their comedy with a definite edge.

I don't know what expectations some people may have had for this, but I didn't really expect much, and I was therefore pleasantly surprised.  Tim Blake Nelson is particularly funny in his unfortunately small role in the film.  Giovanni Ribisi does well with the role of the insurance claims investigator.  If you are expecting a typical Robin Williams comedy, or even something along the lines of his roles in Insomnia or One Hour Photo, you will be disappointed. This movie is nothing like those roles, and if dark comedies are not up your alley, don't bother.  If you have enjoyed other dark comedies, such as Death to Smoochy and Fargo, I don't think Big White is as good as those, but it is definitely funny and especially worth the low price.",1242691200,,822,4.801418439716312

To raise money for his loving wife Margaret (Holly Hunter) who she thinks has Tourette's syndrome, Paul thinks of a brilliant idea: he has a life insurance policy on his brother who has been missing for five years and here is a nearly frozen corpse that might prove his actual ""death.""

""The Big White"" looks like a cross between ""Fargo"" and ""A Simple Plan."" Like these crime films, things often go wrong. Paul Bernell, who is desperate to cover his crime and get money, has to confront one insurance company investigator Ted (Giovanni Ribisi) who is not convinced.

""The Big White"" which includes many eccentric characters is more a comedy than a thriller. To call it a thriller, ""The Big White"" has so many plot holes and its script is predicable. However, in spite of the great cast including Robin Williams, Holly Hunter, Giovanni Ribisi, Tim Blake Nelson, W. Earl Brown, Woody Harrelson and Alison Lohman, I couldn't find the film very funny probably because the film itself tries to be very funny. The film's obvious attempts to make us laugh (like the two bumbling crooks) are sometimes irritating.

Also, some of the (male) characters are, as one reviewer has rightly pointed out, mean-spirited. Ribisi's Ted says nasty things to her telephone psychic girlfriend, but we are supposed to like him as the film's conclusion suggests. The film's narrative lacks the subtlety in telling its story, and Tim Blake Nelson and Woody Harrelson, both great actors, are also wasted, having to play clichd characters.

""The Big White"" fails to make use of the very absurd situations Paul is in. It needs more creative energy to make Paul's story a really funny farce (and I found ""Fargo"" twice as funny as this). The film only relies on small unimaginative gags that are not very funny. Fortunately the filmmakers managed to have secured the great cast and their talents solely lift the entire film to 3-star rating.",1201046400,,2037,4.861671469740634

This is a really entertaining film.
There are a number of long involved reviews of this film so I'll just say that I really enjoyed the film. It's a funny story, that well acted by the leads, but the supporting characters are a riot.
This film does not disappoint, very quirky, a lot of fun.",1198886400,,312,4.305084745762712
2561421,2,B000FDEVA2,"I don't need much of a budget to write a review of a film, only a little bit of my time for watching and writing. That said, I'm confident that if I had ""The Big White's"" $16 Million budget, indie director's dream cast, and lame ""Fargo"" inspired script; I could have made a better and more entertaining film. My first move would have been to throw some of the budget into a major script re-write, maybe just sending the thing off to the Coen brothers themselves for a quick IQ transfusion.

The ""Fargo"" rip-off comparisons are valid, but that does not mean that there is much about ""The Big White"" with which ""Fargo"" fans will connect. The similarities are pretty much confined to setting (Alaska instead of Minnesota), production design (white), and basic plot elements (two bumbling hoods, financially desperate businessman, kidnapped and bound wife), and a side story featuring an odd domestic couple (an insurance investigator instead of a female sheriff).

The ""Fargo"" disconnects are more subtle. Instead of a crime thriller with black comedy elements, ""The Big White"" is a black comedy with crime thriller elements. Which would not be a problem except that ""Fargo's"" occasional ironic comical moments have several times more amusement value than ""The Big White's"" frenzied efforts to inject some humor.

Secondly, on its most fundamental level ""The Big White"" is mean spirited. While ""Fargo"" parodied the great white north culture of Minnesota, the characters themselves were comfortable inhabitants of their strange white world; they had grown up there and were well suited to their environment. In ""The Big White"", the conflict and the character motivations stem from a desire to escape from a remote Alaskan town that seemingly has no virtues.

In The Big White, a failing Alaskan travel agency owner (Robin Williams playing his Jack Dundee character from ""The Best of Times-1986) schemes to collect on his missing brother's life insurance policy by claiming that a dead body he has found in a dumpster is that of his brother. Things become complicated when two bumbling (possibly gay) hoods (Tim Blake Nelson and W. Earl Brown) kidnap his wife (Holly Hunter) because they need the body to prove that they have carried out a contract killing. Hunter's character may or may not have Tourette's Syndrome, a psychological condition which may or may not have comic potential in a feature film. But we will have to wait for a better script and a better to director to find out because the results are inconclusive here.

The main side story involves an obsessive insurance investigator (Giovanni Ribisi) and his air- headed telephone psychic girlfriend (Alison Lohman). Their scenes together provide the film's best moments and the only times when it manages to duplicate ""Fargo's"" almost poetic humor. Ribisi is solid in all his scenes and you wish a bigger part for Lohman.

If you like small off-kilter films (with big name actors having fun with their performances) you would be far better served by ""Dummy"" (2002) and ""The Big Empty"" (2003). ""The Big White"" tries for the feel of these two films but falls short.

The climactic scene ties up all the loose ends in a neat and tidy package, but I found the staging quite artificial and contrived, for which I am docking the movie's rating.  A man passes a dead body he finds in a dumpster off as his brother, who has been missing for 5 years, in order to collect on his brother's life insurance policy.  Meanwhile, the two-bit hoods who killed the guy need a body to prove they carried out their assigned hit so they kidnap the man's wife and set up and exchange; his wife for the body.  Once they complete the exchange, everyone just stands around waiting, and this was the part I found very contrived. No one would be hanging around after they did such an exchange.

2561429,4,B000FDEVA2,"The Big White is a tale of an Alaskan man by the name of Paul Barnell (played by Robin Williams) who has a sick wife and mounting bills, and is in need of some quick cash. Paul decides to cash in a life insurance claim on his long since missing brother. It is here that the chaos ensues.

The Big White was a nice diversion, and a fun film to watch. Robin Williams does a good job of creating sympathy for his situation. Holly Hunter, as Margaret Barnell, is one of the true gems in the film. Her character is very lovable and extremely well acted.

The supporting cast in Big White is put together well. There are plenty of oddball, quirky people like Giovanni Ribisi, W. Earl Brown, and Tim Blake Nelson. Lets not forget Woody Harrelson. Woody is wonderful in the film as well.

The story doesn't have a lot of ""roll on the floor"" laughing moments, but it is funny and a pleasure to watch. Some folks have compared it to Fargo. I don't think that's fair. Just because it is in a similar genre with a classic doesn't make a film bad. Both films are good for different reasons.

I didn't think of Fargo when watching the Big White. The Big White is good enough to stand on it's own.

Couple this with a wife with psychological problems and the insurance industry's typical ""screw the policyholder"" philosophy and you have a FARGO.

2561431,4,B000FDEVA2,"What do you do when you spot a movie with an incredible cast, but it is a movie you have never heard of?  If the movie is ""The Big White,"" by all means, you get it.

 Almost a homage to ""Fargo,"" the movie centers on a nearly bankrupt travel agent in Alaska who tries to cash in on his missing brother's life insurance policy.  But where William Macy's central character in Fargo was increasingly craven and despicable, Robin Williams' Paul Barnell is simply a good man pushed to desperate measures by cruel fate.  In further contrast to Fargo, Barnell's wife, played with manic inspiration by Holly Hunter, is not a callously used pawn, but the love of Barnell's life and the true reason he undertakes such desperate measures.  Finally, the two miscreants who wind up kidnapping Mrs. Barnell are not Fargo's homicidal maniacs, but stumblebums who are, from all available evidence, in fact very closely related to Larry, Daryl and Daryl.

 Needless to say, there are twists to the story, and the main one here, of course, is that Barnell's brother is not dead.  Long gone and missing, yes; but most decidedly not dead.  Not letting this little problem stop him, Barnell ""borrows"" a dead body he conveniently and accidentally finds in his dumpster. Three inconveniences, however, threaten to derail Barnell's plan.  The first is the stumblebum bad guys, would-be hit men who need the body back to prove to their gangster boss that they did indeed dispatch their intended victim. In place of Frances McDormand's Sheriff Gunderson, Barnell must contend with the suspicions of insurance investigator Ted Watters, played by Giovani Ribisi as a rabidly ambitious company man desperate for a success that will get him promoted out of Alaska.  Barnell's biggest problem, however, is the sudden and unexpected return of his n'er do well brother, played with psychotic glee by Woody Harrelson.  The rest of the cast, the locals, are cleverly portrayed so that from one angle they look like rubes, but simultaneously appear from another perspective as decent folks who take a man at his word.  Director Mark Mylod wisely does not label them, leaving it to the audience to decide how to view them and the unspoken commentary they offer on the debate between strict legality and doing the right thing.

 What follows as all these players, each desperate in his or her own way, collide, is the crux of the movie.  While the ending may be a bit too standard Hollywood issue, it is clever enough to remain satisfying nonetheless.

2561499,5,B000FDEVA2,"I just recently got to see this film and it got me wondering.....in a year when the only really good films were foreign, where was this little gem???

Dark enough to give chills in some areas, light enough to make you laugh and even some suspense thrown in, as your never quite sure how far things will go.

Robin Williams is always great....he is an amazing actor, no matter how cliche he may seem.  He can do comedy, he can do drama....this movie falls in the black dramady catagory of which he was made for (see Death To Smootchy!).

Excellant casting in this one, a great story that takes some turns that you don't expect, and of course some you know are going to happen and can't be helped.  Very entertaining the whole way through.  Woody is a scary man when he wants to be, and he comes off 10x scarier than anything he's played before (he was really an anti-hero in NBK), he is straight up villian in this movie and it works very well for the emotion of the story.

Giavanni is a strange actor, and im never really sure about him, as half of his movies are really good (see Boiler Room) and others really fall flat.  He is pretty good in this one as a majorly obsesive insurance investigator....the first scene with him in it really spells out his character perfectly.

All in all, i would highly recommend this film, and again i ask.....where was this one when it came out almost 2 years ago??",1150761600,,1402,4.382239382239383
2561500,4,B000FDEVA2,"I have seen enough Robin Williams films in the past several years where I know the movie night have been made if he had not signed on to do it, but his performance did not really work in the film.  However, the Robin Williams that shows up for ""The Big White"" has managed to strip things down another level, so that he is actually the eye of the hurricane in this 2005 black comedy that lets the rest of the cast go off the deep end.  The rest is not great, but pretty good for a black comedy, a genre that has seen more misfires than hits in the last couple of decades.

Williams is Paul Barnell, who runs a travel agency in the frozen wasteland that is Alaska (at least in this film; not because it is true, but because it makes the title of the film work).  Paul is strapped for cash and has a wife, Margaret (Holly Hunter), who has problems.  She is convinced that she has developed Tourettes, but that would appear to be one thing she does not have.  It has been five years since Paul's brother Raymond disappeared, and since he has a $1 million life policy out on his brother, a criminal type for whom a bad ending would have been predictable, and since he needs the money, he talks to the insurance company about being able to collect.  But he is told by Ted (Giovanni Ribisi), the insurance investigator, that in Alaska when there is no body you have to wait seven years and then the company gets to hem and haw for another year.  So it looks like Paul is about at the end of his rope.

Then he takes some trash out to the dumpster behind his business and lo, there is a frozen corpse just laying there.  After he gets over the initial shock, the wheels starting turning in Paul's mind and he takes the corpse home, stashes it in the fridge in the garage, and plots to pass the body off as that of his brother.  This becomes a bit more difficult than Paul thinks, but the local cops and coroner buy it, so things are going good.  But Ted, who wants to get promoted out of Alaska and back to the real world, is suspicious.  However, this might be the least of Paul's problems because the corpse was dumped there by a couple of low level thugs, Gary (Tim Blake Nelson) and Jimbo (W. Earl Brown), and their boss wants the body back.  Plus, you know that in a movie like this no deed, good or bad, will go unpunished, so it is not surprising when Raymond (Woody Harrelson) himself shows up.

Because this is a black comedy it skates perilously close to a line.  Hunter's character is the one that is in comic overdrive in this particular film, and Alison Lohman as Tiffany, the girl who is living with Ted and running a psychic friend operation out of his dinning room, seems like a throw away character but actually functions as the connection that will bring everybody together on a glacier for the final act to play out.  I was worried that ""The Big White"" was going to turn too dark, but it does avoid that and I actually liked that we suddenly find everybody sitting around in a car taking a moment to collect their thoughts before talking.  Plus the misplace efforts of Gary to avoid letting anybody trace their phone call to Paul tickled my funny bone.

I realize there is a tendency to compare ""The Big White"" to ""Fargo,"" but I do not feel viewers are under an obligation to do so.  Yes, both involve snow and quirky characters, but ""Fargo"" was about a desperate guy trying to scheme his way out of a mess of his own making and ""The Big White"" is the story of a guy who wants to take care of his wife and tries to take advantage of an opportunity that falls into his lap.  That his brother shows up and his wife gets kidnapped are just bitter ironies here and there are also the attendant injuries being added by the people who beat up Paul.  So there are enough significant differences between the two for me to judge director Mark Mylod by a standard he would not be able to meet.  Most viewers will find themselves ahead of the game when they finish watching this one.  Besides, we are getting to that part of the year where a world of snow constitutes an inviting world of relief away from the sweltering days to come.",1150329600,,4134,4.29086229086229

Obviously a paen to the Coen Brothers' superior FARGO, THE BIG WHITE is an off the wall dark comedy that isn't all that funny and not all that dark, but it has some merit.  First and foremost, Giovanni Ribisi, one of our most underappreciated actors, steals the show as the obsessed insurance investigator out to snare a sneaky Robin Williams.  Ribisi who has made a name for himself without matinee looks or physique is purely delightful in the depth he brings to his role, and his performance alone is worth seeing.  Williams is nicely restrained, but his character is neither all that likeable or convincing.  Oscar winner Holly Hunt is fun as his daffy wife who claims to have Tourette's syndrome but is possibly just looney.  Tim Blake Nelson is hilarious as the lead hitman who seems more at home with a casserole than a gun.  Alison Lohman brings a vibrancy to her role as Ribisi's girlfriend and Hunter's telephone psychic.
