3486895,5,B001B8TKHO,"Trying out a new format for reviews. ""Ratings"" are a guess and lean toward the ""safe side"".

Sub-genre: Comedy romance (Harem for part 2).

Situations:  Opening R, series probably PG+  Opening has series of FemDom S&M visuals.
Language:  Probably PG
Nudity:  Probably PG  Limited exposure generally.
Violence:  PG+  Occasionally gory, bloody.

Language options: Dub, Sub and Dub with subtitles. Excellent as you can watch both and compare the translations. (I liked the subtitled version better).

Special Features: Very limited. Just clean open/close and trailers (only one of which is in English, the other 3 are just a clip montage with music, presumably from the show. (Useless in other words).

Box and Menu Art is the same as the subtitle only version with backgrounds changed to red. I guess they didn't even need to do that, so kudos for effort.

Basically this is a twisted comedy about a twisted romance. Boy (Sakura-kun) is destined to accidentally discovery the secret to immortality while trying to create a pedophile world (Accidentally freezing all women at age 12) and an angel (Dokuro-chan) is sent back in time to stop him. Her mission is to kill him, but for some reason she falls for him instead and tries to keep him too busy to study. When he does anything ""strange"" she bludgeons him with her steel spiked bat named Excalibolg, usually turning him into a bloody, gory mess. She then immediately restores him with a chant and they go on with their lives. She becomes hunted by the other angels (especially her sister Zakuro-chan) from the future world for treason (not killing Sakura-kun) gets caught and taken away, but escapes back to the present to be with him.
In the second part (Last 4 episodes), Dokuro and her sister Zakuro are living with Sakura-kun. This arc is more the Harem type romance comedy and continues the in the same general type of situations. Watch the two ending themes for this arc, the final one changes. I say two because each two episodes have an opening before and an ending after, rather than before and after each one.
I'm sure I haven't done it justice. This is one of my favorite animes I've found recently.

One thing of note. There is an error in my first disk that looks like it stops after episodes 4 and 6. Pressing skip takes it to the next episode so I didn't bother returning it.",1291939200,2,2341,4.7481481481481485
3486896,5,B001B8TKHO,"I thought this series was amazing it had all the blood, nudity, and comedy any show can ask for I couldn't think of another show that had the same mix that made it funny. This series is a must get for anyone who is into this kind of stuff.",1281830400,7,239,3.8979591836734695
3486897,5,B001B8TKHO,"One of the best comedies in the wonderful world of anime originally released in 2008 (sub version only) is back to club some skulls this time with an excellent english cast, Bludgeoning Angle Dokuro-chan  is about a boy that will change the future by making a Pedophile's world, fortunately angel from the future Dokuro-chan is on a mission to stop and kill him before this happens.

Sakura Kusakabe is destined to create the technology for eternal life, which (due to Sakura's lolicon/Pedophile tendencies) freezes all women's aging once they turn twelve.  God refuses to allow this, so he sends his angels to the past to kill Sakura before he can do this. But one angel, Dokuro-chan, decides to try to change the future without killing him. Problem is, Dokuro is very temperamental, and is constantly killing Sakura in incredibly bloody ways with her giant spiked club, but she always revives him just for her own pleasure.

The show has a very comedic satire on sexuality combined with references from other anime genres, tons of that smart and clever sense of humor from Japan, each episode is fast-paced, crazy and always funny, the only down side is when we get to the end credits.

PROS
- Series 1 and 2
- Intros and endings songs are very catchy.
- Vivid colors and fluent animation.

Zansu - Kirik Thornton (Kaname Ohgi )

Cons

This is one of those gems that we rarely see here in America, if you are into Ninja Nonsense, Kanokon, Cromartie High School or Indian summer, then by all means buy it, you won't regret it.",1277856000,12,1896,4.585798816568047
3486898,5,B001B8TKHO,"Subtitled only! Unfortunately. Not a single series, but a series and a short sequel. I'd love to see this series dubbed. There's a lot going on in the background and having to read the subtitles makes it difficult to catch the quick drawn jokes. That said, I'd call this a Comedy-horror-romance, but not horror in the usual sense. A lot of blood and gore though, so I can't think of a better genre to label it. Some S&M overtones. So Not For Children. Hopefully you've stayed this far because now I'll say that this is probably the most morbidly hilarious show I've seen in ages! I haven't laughed so much in at least a year. If you're mature enough to enjoy ""low humor"", this is a definite ""worth getting"" series.",1275782400,4,714,4.5
3486899,5,B001B8TKHO,If you like over the top violence and humor check out this show . The only complaint I have is that its pretty short. Wish there were more episodes.,1275091200,,148,4.137931034482759
3486900,5,B001B8TKHO,My major concern when buying this was that it would only be season one but fear not! it includes both seasons one and two!! amazing and hilarious anime! you won't be disappointed!,1263859200,,179,4.625
3486901,5,B001B8TKHO,"Seriously one of the best damned anime around.  Violence and constant fan-service await you in the epic and (unfortunately) short series.  I don't know why it was discontinued; why, I ask you, WHY is it discontinued!?",1238025600,,217,5.0
3486902,5,B001B8TKHO,"This show is hallarious. Everything from the opening song to that freak Zansu is a gut buster. If you like animes with simple stories and ridiculous comedy ranging from simple dialogue to intense bloodshed, you'll love this show. The product itself is as good as it gets. Standard 15mm dvd case, the only special features are four trailers but if you're like me, trailers are all you need because you never get around to watching them. It only has a japanese dub which isn't a problem unless you prefer watching in english. It has 2 discs, so if you're unfortunate like me, the panel in the middle of the case might be broken when you get it, but oh well I have alot of spares. Oh, and Nodoka from Negima! makes an appearance. Obviously not as Nodoka herself, but the same voice actor and pretty well the exact same character.",1236470400,5,826,4.513333333333334
3486903,5,B001B8TKHO,"I saw a fan-sub of this for the first time at a convention about a year ago, and I was thrilled they finally localized it to the US.  This series is choc-ful of hilarious inuendo and wonderful animation.  The series is almost a parody of it'self after a point with all the references it makes to it's own fan service.

For those looking for a wonderful short series in the same tone as Puni Puni Poemy, this is absolutely for you.  While I doubt it will happen, i do hope they Dub this at some point.

The only knock I would give the DVD is the serious lack of special features (the only SF is a sub-title free opening and ending sequence), however for the price this is a minor complaint at worst.

Every anime fan over 16 should own this quirky DVD.",1223769600,2,751,4.216783216783217
3486904,5,B001B8TKHO,"Dokuro-Chan is a mini series that is completely bizarre and hilarious. It also has the heart of multiple viewings.
Dokuro-Chan is an angelic assassin from the future sent to kill a boy who in the future creates the means for immortality. Dokuro-Chan instead of killing the boy moves in with him to steer him away from creating such a world in the future. Geysers of blood, limbs, and other body parts fly whenever Dokuro-Chan gets upset with the boy. Immediately after she brings life back to the boy.
The show is simple but has numerous elements that make the show work very well. Some very strange and have no point in the show at all but that only makes it more hilarious. Highly recommended awesome show.",1223769600,,708,4.626984126984127
3486905,2,B001B8TKHO,"There was literally like 2 episodes on each DVD and there was only 2 discs, don't buy it it's not worth it",1385251200,,106,3.8636363636363638
3486906,5,B001B8TKHO,"As the cover of this DVD suggests, the title character is an exceptionally cute angel girl with a spiked club. But what is the spiked club used for? Its simple- she uses it to brutally kill the main character over and over again. One may think to themselves, how is this supposed to be a comedy? Its quite simple: the show is absolutely insane and all the violence is handled in such a ridiculous way that it ends up being hilarious. The blood content is almost on par with anime such as Another or Shiki.

What is this show about? An angel from the future called Dokuro comes to prevent the main character from committing a grievous sin in the near future, which causes all girls to stop aging after the age of twelve. This is a means of immortality, which offends God, and thus he must be stopped before if ever happens.

As a note to potential buyers, this is a very violent anime, but what may be more surprising is that this is an extremely perverted anime. There are many fan service moments as well as blatantly sexual situations. Its kind of like Excel Saga, but even crazier. The second season is definitely more raunchy than the first, which means its probably the better season, even though there is no plot in the second season, but its not like anyone necessarily watches this show for its story.

This DVD set includes the entire 2 seasons of the series, but the runtime is about 180 minutes. How is that possible? There are supposed to be two seasons. The truth of the matter is that the first season is only 8 episodes long and the second season is only 4 episodes long. Each episode is about 12 minutes long, just like Cromartie High School or Galaxy Angel. Keep this in mind, just so you don't buy this expecting a lot more episodes. The DVD set looks like a standard DVD case, but with 2 DVDs inside of it, and there are no real special features to speak of.

This release comes from Media Blasters, but the English dub is not one you would normally hear from them. Instead the dub cast features veterans like Wendee Lee and Johnny Yong Bosch, which were in anime like The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzimiya, which is a plus. However, most of the other actors are not in this show very long, so you cannot judge them too well. Overall, a very funny show; maybe the funniest anime since Excel Saga, and that is saying something.",1380844800,,2341,4.424593967517401
3486907,5,B001B8TKHO,"I gave it a 5 cause i love it. Although I'm disappointed with amazon's shipping methods, when i got a disc was lose in the case and suffered scratches because of that, the disc that stayed in place is perfectly fine. Not like I can prove that it was amazons fault or the company that shipped it.

The show is good and weird but it's super funny i recommend it to anyone who wants an anime that's funny and wants to sit there and go WTF. That is if you can get a copy",1379548800,,466,3.9574468085106385

3486911,4,B001B8TKHO,"Its a good buy if your doing it for the comdey, and the completely (non)logical about of blood that is in one kid. very little to no fan service.",1306108800,,145,4.0344827586206895
3486912,4,B001B8TKHO,"I loved Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan before it was even made into DVD, so it was exciting the first time through when it was given a DVD release...but without a dub, which to me was pretty crushing, as I was crying for a good dub of the series.

So, because the DVD release was a huge hit and people were begging for a dub to be made, they finally they made one, and even gave it its own release. The cast is absolutely top-notch, with huge-name voice actors and actresses making their presence in the show. It's like a who's-who of VAs, and I was admittedly stunned when I read the cast. I didn't think it was possible to put Wendee Lee, Johnny Young Bosch, Michelle Ruff, and Dorothy Fahn in the same anime, but they managed it here. Very impressive. Even Sam Regal is in there...somehow...err, not sure how he ended up here in the role he's given, but uh...hey, I'm not complaining, I like him too.

I will admit, however, I'm pretty sick of seeing Johnny Young Bosch in what feels like every anime ever released. Why is this guy in everything? Not like it's his fault, and he's profiting from it, but still...anyway, thinking of who could have played Sakura instead of Bosch, I'm thinking Spike Spencer. He probably could have pulled it off. Just, anyone but Bosch.

The only weak point I have, and this is really significant, is that season 2 is nowhere near as funny as season 1. The difference is huge. We're talking, like, Love Hina versus Love Hina Again-level difference, maybe worse. They changed quite a bit in season 2, including the color of Dokuro-chan's hair (uh, huh?), and it reeks of ""We had to make a season 2 for the fans, but we're not going to put the slightest bit of effort into a single scene."" Season 2 is absolutely *crammed* with fan service, including a bath scene with Zakuro (who, for the record, is nine years old), and just a ton of out-of-place scenes that were clearly thrown in because, well, think of the bath scene. I sat through the four episodes of the second season, which is thankfully totally unnecessary to the plot, so the fact that there is no ending or conclusion episode isn't a big deal. I'm guessing season 2 didn't go over so well while it was airing, so they pulled the plug on it early. Understandably.

tl;dr version: Season 2 sucks. It's like getting beaten up on a daily basis by your ex's new boyfriend who happens to have a history of violence, especially against you. It's like the catastrophically nightmarish result of watching the second half of The End of Evangelion while already tripping and thinking you actually understand the plot.

But who cares? We got a top-notch dub of Dokuro-chan. That's all that you really care about, right?",1301184000,4,2701,4.572314049586777
3486913,3,B001B8TKHO,"I've become very cautious over the past few years when it comes to buying anime.  I can't even count how many times I've been fooled into thinking that the anime I'm buying will be awesome.  Perhaps I'm setting the bar too high or it could be that I tend to buy an anime that just has cool cover art or an interesting sounding story from the synopsis on the back of the DVD.  Well, I can safely say that this was worth the money.  I intended to watch it with the Japanese audio, thinking it would be the better choice, but the English dub was very entertaining.  Both lead characters are funny and likable that make for a continually interesting story.  So I guess in summation, this was a very good, interesting, funny show that I would recommend to any anime fan.",1297728000,,765,4.352112676056338
