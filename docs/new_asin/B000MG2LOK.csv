Fundamentally, movies are not about big budgets and name stars - they are about telling worthwhile stories in an effective and engaging manner.  ""Always Will"" is clearly a product of filmmaking passion, and it will leave you feeling warm and happy that you invested your time in watching it.  Many of us have wondered - if we could go back in time and change our lives, would we?  With charm and grace and humor, ""Always Will"" explores this universal theme in a relatable and entertaining way.  It's nice to know that a ""small movie"" can deliver a ""big message.""  Kudos.",1205884800,11,723,4.744

8168426,1,B000MG2LOK,"An incredibly plodding story even for the average adolescent viewer.  Not very compelling.  Actually, this film wasn't compelling at all.  Forget the ""SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF"" since this movie is pretty much unbelievably sophomoric anyway.  Pass.",1508284800,,246,5.942857142857143

8168429,5,B000MG2LOK,"and very watchable.  It speaks to the awkwardness of growing up.  I, too, wanted to change things.  This movie was ell done on a small budget. I applaud all the actors and production staff.  Thank you!!",1506038400,,202,4.527777777777778
8168430,3,B000MG2LOK,"Our family wanted to like this but just couldn't really- we didn't hate it but were not engaged. The acting wasn't the worst ive seen but was just ok. The movie however was so slow. The story in general was a good idea but not well executed. Not casted well either- This kid that looked like he would actually be in no more then 8th or 9th grade was supposed to be portraying a senior in high school along with a red haired stoner type with a mustache and goatee that looked like he was too old to be in high school (you'll see briefly in the movie). No special effects whatsoever even though you think there might be by reading the description and looking at the picture for the movie. I did like that it was a fairly wholesome film that didn't have anything too inappropriate that i wouldnt want my kids seeing. However, my kids got bored with it cause it was slow and took off outside to play about 2/3rds of the way through. There were was one or two plot twists farther along that was a nice addition. Its something to watch but if your time is limited you might want to keep looking for something better cause you might end up feeling like you wasted it watching this unless your looking for something to watch with older elementry school age kids and up that doesnt have too inappropriate content. There is one short scene of some kids smoking and others kissing on school grounds just to let you know. Hope this helps you decide.",1499990400,2,1437,4.345724907063197
