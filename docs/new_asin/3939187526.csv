Though the resolution is low, it doesn't hurt me for I had dozens of memories to fill the details in.  The costumes for the dolls are so delicate.  However, the visual might only work for experienced viewers, or it might count so 'rough'.  I'm also thrilled to listen to this version.  It is so clear, a true soap opera quality.  I also found it was fun that San Francisco Opera was using almost the identical staging from the ACT IV for a good three decades.",1437264000,,625,4.517857142857143
