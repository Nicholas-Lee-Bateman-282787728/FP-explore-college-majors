 Many fans complain that these dvd sets are too expensive and I agree, I've recently spent over $100 to complete my CatDog season set collection and CatDog was not exactly what I would refer to as a top tier cartoon series, so the price is outrageous but I purchased it any way because I wanted to finish my collection ^_^

8526245,5,B0089BSN2E,"I've watched this cartoon since I was in jr. high. It became one of my favorite cartoon shows after watching afew episodes. I was even more happy when I first heard all the episodes were coming out on dvd. I thought these episodes would never come out on DVD, I was also glad that the shipping didn't take too long. I'm looking forward to the final season coming next month. I think everyone who hasn't seen this cartoon should definetly check it out.",1373500800,,451,4.445783132530121
8526246,5,B0089BSN2E,"I have loved the past DVD's that Shout Factory have released and this one is not different, you get another 10 great episodes of this funny cartoon series that ended too quickly in my opinion. For me in watching these last episodes of the series, I found myself laughing as well as a bit nostalgic on the rest of the episodes that were made and a bit amazed at the number of episodes that were created for only two seasons. This was a series that will definitely keep you engaged and by the end you will want to come back and watch the episodes again (or at least I did). Shout Factory did a great job at pulling the episodes together and providing a high quality production! If you are already a fan you will want this to complete your collection. If you have never seen this series, this is a great collection of cartoons that are funny, and witty and ones that I would highly recommend!",1346198400,2,889,4.3293413173652695
