8660275,5,B00KNDW8GI,"Fascinating and compelling.  However, not much different than ""ET Disclosure and the End Time Delusion.""  If you see one, the other is virtually identical.  Nonetheless both are very informative.",1422489600,,195,5.655172413793103
8660276,5,B00KNDW8GI,"Every Catholic needs to see this. The Vatican has been open about their belief that Aliens are coming who are our space brothers and that we will have to adjust out beliefs and our Gospel when they do. How many Roman Catholics know that? Not many. And the rub is this is all a great deception predicted in the Scriptures. Jesus tad us that before his second coming the world would be like it was before the flood, so how was it, read for yourself Genesis chapter 6. Its all about Fallen Angels and those are who this Alien deception is about. I encourage all Catholics and all Christians of every denomination to see this DVD now.",1411862400,5,630,4.3931623931623935
