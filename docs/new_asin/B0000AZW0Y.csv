That was the best parr because she alone is brilliant. Other than that, the docomentary was a little boring as comparted to other documentarys such as THIN. But it was pretty good over all :)",1371340800,2,328,4.140625
7997937,4,B0000AZW0Y,"I had to watch this for a class, but would recommend it to any family who is suffering from an eating disorder.  I would also recommend this to younger women who are considering an eating disorder, or for an early education intervention to educate them on eating disorders.  Very sad, very effective.",1184284800,4,300,4.75

7997939,5,B0000AZW0Y,This movie was very helpful for me.  I have struggled with an eating disorder for a very long time and the movie helped me feel lIke I was not alone.  There was very good explanations of how the family structure can effect a person going through such a disorder and how they can help the individual get well. I would recommend this book to any parent raising girls as well as boys.,1130112000,8,381,4.277777777777778
