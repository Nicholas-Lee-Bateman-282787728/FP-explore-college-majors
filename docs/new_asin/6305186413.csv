977149,3,6305186413,"This is early early Barker, at his most experimental.  These two films are short and silent with a modern score overlaid.  Transfers are rough, and scratchy, but that may be deliberate.  If you've seen the AFI-Lynch shorts  you know the mood of these pieces.  I cannot make a general recomendation  but for those of us with an unhealthy interest in Clive's work its a decent  investment.  Be warned though Redemption Video has an over-long and  somewhat silly pre-movie video sequence that is basically an ad for their  other releases.",937699200,16,535,4.910112359550562
977417,1,6305186413,"Holy crap!  What a stinker!  I've seen better films made by junior high students with the old wind up film cameras.  I am a huge Barker fan and even loved the ultra cheesy 80s films such as Rawhead Rex and the like, but this one?!?!?  Eep!  The filming all in negative hurt my eyes, as did the wang-shot.  No thanx, man.

I don't care if you are a goth, horror buff, OR artsy-fartsy film maker hopeful.  It sucked no matter how you slice it.  This film (or was it two?  Aw who cares) should have been left in the vault.

The only good part was the half naked ""Redemtion Films"" vampire chicks, who sort of did the horror host trip at the beginning.

I don't know, maybe if you ""dropped"" first you might get what's going on, but even having read the books, it was too ambiguous for me.",1166745600,,783,4.181208053691275
977418,5,6305186413,"Clive Barker's Salome & The Forbidden are marvels of eccentricity and artistic freedom. Both shorts, within its silent contents, are provocative food for the eyes and mind and an example of Barker's early talent for film making. These include eye opening performances by Doug Bradley, Anne Taylor and Clive Barker. A must see for all!",1161907200,,334,5.090909090909091
977419,5,6305186413,"This is a rare example of Barker's early work, featuring a young Doug Bradley (Pinhead from the Hellraiser series) as a surreal incarnation of a celluloid nutter and electroconvulsive therapy boy next door.  These two short films 'Salome' & 'The Forbidden' were restored under Barker's supervision and are accompanied by filmed interviews with Barker, Bradley and other key players.

First we have 'Salome' Directed by Clive Barker, Music by Adrian Carson, Cast by Ann Taylor, Graham Bickley, Clive Barker, Doug Bradley, Phil Rimmer, Lyn Darnell, Susan Bickley and Julie Blake, filmed in 1973.

Second we have 'The Forbidden' Cast by Peter Atkins, Clive Barker, Doug Bradley, Phil Rimmer, Lyn Darnell and Julie Blake, filmed in 1975-1978.

Both short films feature early footage of Barker himself, who also did most of the special effects.  In 'The Forbidden', Pete Atkins plays Faust, who is rather convincingly flayed toward the end of the film.  Atkins later wrote the screenplays for the three 'Hellraiser' sequels and more recently wrote the screenplay for 'The Wishmaster'.  Also featured is the inspiration for Pinhead's amazing appearance - a square block of wood covered in 6"" nails.  The anatomical etchings of Vesalius are also rather convincingly brought to life.

The discovery of these early shorts came about when an independent television production company interviewed Barker about his work.  Clips were needed for the documentary, and so the task of restoring both shorts was undertaken.  However, although 'Salome' was more or less completed, 'The Forbidden' remained in an unfinished, unedited state.  With Barker's assistance, this was achieved, and he approved the final cuts of both shorts for this release on DVD.

If you are a fan of Clive Barker or just want to own all the strange movies like I do (trust me I have a lot), then purchase this one and enjoy my friends.  You have to enjoy the early works of famous directors.  They have to start somewhere.  Look at Peter Jackson's first films (Brilliant I might add).  Dead-Alive, Meet The Feebles or Bad Taste.  Or David Lynch's Eraserhead.  Or Cronenberg's Videodrome, The Brood, Scanners, Shivers or Rabid.

You can appreciate that these directors can make movies like 'Lord Of The Rings', 'eXistenZ', Spider, Naked Lunch, Lost Highway, Twin Peaks, Lords of Illusion or even Hellraiser, but look into the early stuff that the great directors have produced/directed.  There is some great stuff that is hidden/forgotten out there that should be in everyone's collection of the strange, weird or abnormal movie collectors.  Here's another great one 'The Short Films Of David Lynch'.  To find out more, read my review on 'The Short Films Of David Lynch' or any of my other reviews.  Look folks I didn't make these movies, I just enjoy stuff that is NOT mainstream.  It's not every day you get to see movies like these.  I swear it even opens new doors in your imagination.  I'll keep on watching these movies and then writing these reviews, if you keep on reading them.  Enjoy KIDDIES!",1140825600,6,3060,5.066
977420,2,6305186413,"If you're a maniacal fan of the Hellraiser series, you may find these two short films interesting for historical reasons, since they include some of the actors and themes that turn up in Barker's more professional later films.  There are also a couple of interviews which enlighten us (sort of) on what the films are supposed to be about! The adjective ""murky"" (in more ways than one) best describes these fuzzy 8-mm efforts.  Not being, I confess, a big Hellraiser fan, I found my primary emotion to be not horror but boredom.",1075075200,4,527,4.717391304347826
977421,5,6305186413,"An excelent peace of master work, i see this movie for the first time in a concert in mexico city in a place called ""La Victoria"" it was part of a fetish festival and i get amazed by all his dark beauty,now that i i could finally watch al over i get stuned by all the details and all the dark impresions in my mind.
its a must have for any self called gothic or night creature.",1013644800,12,377,3.909090909090909
977422,3,6305186413,"Clive Barker made these two silent shorts, shot in black-and-white with music, in the early 1970s in Liverpool and even appeared in them.  ""Salome"" is an 18-minute version of the tale based on the Oscar Wilde play, with Anne Taylor as Salome and Doug Bradley as King Herod.  Peter Atkins plays Faust in ""The Forbidden,"" a 35-minute short that is the better of the two works.  Uniquely stylized, these short films are powerful precursors to his late works involving a puzzle book sequence and a skinning segment that hint at what was to come from this modern master of horror.  I am surprised these were not simply included as bonus features on the ""Hellraiser"" DVDs.  These are clearly going to be of interest almost exclusively to Barker's fans, who might not want to own these short films but who certainly would be find them fascinating to see a couple of times.",997660800,17,865,4.701986754966887
977423,4,6305186413,Weird to see this old movie of ours on DVD.  This was filmed mainly in the basement of my sister's florist's shop in Liverpool where some of the paintings for the set are still on the walls. We seemed to recut and re film so many times over a period of years that I can't recall ever thinking that the movie was finished. Still there it is for you hardened Barker fans - would have been nice if they spelt my name right!!! Ann Taylor,984960000,62,433,4.094117647058823
977424,3,6305186413,"I love his work, but I found this a bit hard to get through. It's all images, no text or dialogue (save for the interviews), and though it is visually compelling, it may not be appealing to those who don't like surrealistic art flicks. The Forbidden is beautiful to see, as is Salome...very different from what we're used to. The bizarro introduction put forth by Redemption Video is pure tripe; fast foward through it.",973728000,8,419,4.675675675675675
977425,4,6305186413,"These films are a fascinating look at Clive's early work.  If you have only a mild interest in Clive Barker, these may not be for you, as they are a little difficult to follow at times.  ""The Forbidden"", Barker's  retelling of the Faust legend, is by far my favorite of the two--the part  with the skin peeling is amazing!  What makes the DVD worth owning is, of  course, the interview with Barker about the making of the films.  What  makes no sense is the arrangement of the DVD.  Instead of taking you  directly to the menu, the disc runs completely through the program before  the menu pops up.  Another minus is Redemption Video's ridiculous,  soft-core porn introduction that is nothing more than a glorified  advertisement for their video line.  It seems silly to take a star away for  that, I know, but it really does detract from the overall experience.  Trust me.",957657600,8,873,4.6381578947368425

7884407,3,6305186413,I love all of Clive Barkers writing and most of the movies he has sanctioned. I wasn't fond of these 2 college films from him. The second is interesting for the connections to the visuals of Hellraiser. What I enjoyed most (and almost only) was the interview with Clive at the end... That at least was really good.,1370736000,,314,4.431034482758621
7884408,5,6305186413,Good to see the beginings of Clive Barker and his directing career. The interviews are insightful and entertaining.  I wish it were longer.,1368144000,,139,5.043478260869565
7884409,3,6305186413,"Clive Barker's two early films are excellent. I found Salome a bit tedious after a while (though still interesting), but The Forbidden is stunning. It's an excellent look at his very early work, and the Barker feel and obsessions are immediately recognizable. The Forbidden could easily be part of the Hellraiser universe.

HOWEVER, the two films are packaged by ""Redemption Films,"" and hosted Elvira-style by the most tacky woman I've seen in a long time. She's dressed up as some sort of vampire demon, she drinks the blood of other women, and there are lots and lots of bare breasts flopping around. It borders on pornographic, and not in an exciting way. I was shocked, and it takes a lot to shock me. I'm glad I didn't screen this in mixed company at a movie watching get-together. The hostess also talks way too much about some sort of mythos she's invented involving incestuous lesbian vampire countesses, which should be totally gratifying but  ends up just being a waste of about 10 minutes before Barker's movies actually start.

Bottom line: It's worth it to have Clive's rare films on DVD, but you'll need to fast forward and try not to barf in your popcorn for the opening debacle.",1356566400,,1194,4.758454106280193
7884410,5,6305186413,"this is the one that started it all. and folks are wondering why cliver barker and doug bradley have NO connection to the recent hellraiser stinker part 9. these two gentlemen grew up together and are life long ""blood"" brothers along with peter atkins. some fans don't understand atmospheric/goth horror which is what these are. so is f.w. murnau nosferatu from 1922 which is in fact the free worlds first horror film and is/was a goth horror, in fact horror started off goth(thematic/symbolic). in my eyes to truly appreciate modern horror, i very strongly suggest
starting off with this one if 1922 is too old for you. in seven years nosferatu will be 100 years old.

ps. clive barker apparently has little respect for the hellraiser franchise after part 3 hell on earth. i in fact
don't care for bloodline,inferno,deader,hellworld though i had the decency to buy and watch them at least once, but the current one? clive barker hates it! and his words are NOT KIND!! if clive barker hates it, so do i!

my favorite hellraisers are parts 1-3 and part 6 hellseeker which goes back to part II in story-line.
