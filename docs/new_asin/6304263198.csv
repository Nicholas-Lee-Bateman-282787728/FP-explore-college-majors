826697,5,6304263198,"The film Latcho Drom is a unique product, which is more like a 2 hour long music video, showcasing gypsy music (and sometimes dance) from all around the world.  This is an amazing way of seeing the common treads that unite  Roma (or gypsy) culture in all parts of the world, but also how these  people have adapted to their surrounding by adopting bits and pieces of  local traditions.  This is also finally, a positive and maybe even  objective look into Roma culture, free of stereotypes and prejudice.  For  fans of ""Deep Forest"", one of the songs from the film, the one  from Slovakia, was sampled for one of their pieces on ""Boheme.""  This film has rapid beats and heel-taping rythms, but also sad and  melancholic songs and laments.  Some images will make you want to get up  and dance, while other can move you to tears, for example the old Roma lady  singing about gypsy persecution at Auschwitz during WWII.  A true pleasure  to watch and listen to.  I just hope there would now be a Latcho Drom 2 to  explore the other regions of the world where Roma culture flourishes, but  which were not included in the film.",963360000,22,1122,4.52

The Roma have  survived because they understand this centrality. Gatlif and the many  incredible singers, musicians and dancers, give us the priceless gift of  sharing this knowledge. We need to be raising our next generations with  films like this.",942364800,22,449,4.717948717948718

826700,5,6304263198,"If you've ever been interested in learning about Gypsy (or more  accurately, Rom) culture and history, this is the film for you. Made by Tony  Catlif, himself a Rom, the film (the title means ""Safe Journey,""  a serious blessing in this culture) takes the viewer on the same path  travelled by the gypsies themselves a thousand years ago. It begins in  India, showing a gypsy band in a desolate spot, telling their own story in  dance and song. He travels ever westward, through Egypt, Turkey, Eastern  Europe, France, and finally Spain, where the stunning beauty of gypsy  flamenco dance and music will hold you spellbound. There is no dialog:  Catlif lets the lyrics of the songs, the language of the dances, and the  unforgettable faces of the gypsies themselves tell the story. You'll feel  like you've been given a brief but magical tour of a mysterious, rarely  seen world. Gypsies have always been persecuted and ostracized; this film,  made by one of their own, gives them a voice in their own language.  END",906768000,52,1015,4.791907514450867

826934,4,6304263198,"Throughout watching the film ""Latcho Drom"" the audience can get a feel for the history and importance of culture these nomads had. This film really takes audience to the journey and lifestyle that most people would think it was something that happened a long time ago, but sadly occurs in countries still today. These nomads engaged in dangerous activities around their children such as hammering fire around them, or the children even hammering it themselves. This shows the audience how much other cultures teaches their children by doing, even if it is dangerous, but that is how children in other cultures get jobs at an early age, and that is how children from other cultures do more labor work and are comfortable doing them. Throughout this film, audiences can truly understand the hardships that other cultures go through on a daily basis, but their hardships is what makes them proud of who they are.
Latcho Drom also shows a lot of what is like to fit in from another coming to a new one. These Hindu nomads, even though they lived in a close community of their own as they traveled around from India to Spain, they were ostracized from others. This reminds me of what is like coming from a different country, and then coming to the United States and being stereotyped or categorized to only be around people of their own kind. Although this film is more about the culture and the music of their country (as audiences see the importance of dance and music throughout the film from characters dancing throughout their travel), this movie also highlights the struggle of being different. All in all, this movie was very intriguing because it teaches audiences the pre-judgement that we have of other people. Instead of looking at this movie with confusion one should look at this movie with admiration and admire that we no longer have to go through that, but sadly other people do.",1391472000,,1890,4.782874617737003
826935,5,6304263198,"Incredible film but being a DVD with region 3, I could only play it on a computer.  That was very disappointing.",1391212800,,112,4.333333333333333
827070,4,6304263198,"It was hard to tell whether Latcho Drom was trying to tell a fictional narrative, or simply offer a window into the lives of the Romani exiles, who are often dismissed as petty thieves and street entertainers. By the end, both were true. The Romani are portrayed as clearly harmless, yet misunderstood by the outside. Often the subject of purposeless violence, the Romani travel with no destination, entertaining out of passion.
 The original reason for their choice of exile has not been proven, but it is speculated that a drought in India caused the first Romani to leave their homes, and today there are populations all over the world. The film shows how Romani people adapt and conform to a degree, perhaps mostly externally. It seems that they will adapt their clothes and language somewhat, but their lifestyles of entertaining and bombastic personalities do not change.
 While theres no argument that there is an unfair prejudice against the Romani, the film does not capitalize on the dark prejudice, save for a few scenes. Instead, the film depicts the Romani as positive, energetic, and synergistic within their group. One particularly enlightening scene takes place at a train stop. A child and mother waiting for the train see a group of about 20 Romani. The mother gives the child some money to offer them to play a song. They refuse to take the money and play a rousing, lighthearted tune anyway, each member finding a part to play and performing passionately, clear that they enjoy making the child and mother happy. The scene illustrates how the Romani are truly harmless entertainers and deserve none of the hate they receive.",1391040000,,1644,4.931407942238267
827071,5,6304263198,"The film Latcho Drom depicts the life of the traveling Roma all over Europe. The Roma are a traveling people who perform for a living, even though their style of living leaves them towards the lower class of society. They are looked down upon by society for virtually no reason, and are somewhat exiled from normal life in whatever their region may be.

Latcho Drom peeked into the life of many different types of Roma. Even though they perform different dances and songs in their specific regions, their lifestyles are very similar. Their life does not make them much money, but that does not seem to be a deterrent to their life, as across all of their regions, they persist with their performances. My personal favorite part was how at the beginning of the movie, the Roma are seen traveling through the desert in search of water. As they struggle, while living off of droplets of whatever water they have. They arrive at their destination, and rehydrate, then go right back to their dancing and singing.

How the Roma lived is a unique lifestyle, but as Latcho Drom showed, it is not an easy one. The Roma almost cherish their ability to live solely as performers, without all of the distractions of the modern world. They live vicariously through the freedom of their music, and take the struggles of their lives as they come.",1390953600,2,1331,4.683760683760684
827072,5,6304263198,"Before watching Lacho Drom I was not ready to watch such a unique different type of film that portrayed the life of the gypsies and their culture. When the film opened up I didn't know what a lot of the different types of sounds and performances that the gypsies put on. The culture that they all shared opened my eyes to different religions and lifestyles that the others had. The type of life that the gypsies lived was also a huge factor that kept my attention throughout the film. The journey that took place from India to Spain truly displayed their nomadic culture and the life that all ages in their group had to live.

One of my most unique and interesting scenes in the movie was when the gypsies traveled out to Hungry and performed at the wedding. The ways their movements, songs and rhythms all portrayed a different meaning to their religion showed how much respect and loyalty they had.

Lacho Drom, meaning safe journey from rom, is a very unique title to name this movie because of how much we see them travel. That is a very small part of many underlying meaning and symbolism that is shown throughout Lacho Drom. I enjoyed viewing this film and almost idolizing their free spirited attitude and carefree life. Although many people did not like and respect the gypsies, they did not let that get to the way of life they wanted to live.",1390953600,2,1352,4.536885245901639
827073,4,6304263198,"Latcho Drom tells the story of the Roma people and their journey as people and a community. It shows their progression from from north-west India to Spain covering areas between such as Egypt, Turkey and France. It has taken them about 1000 years to get were they are today, starting in India and making their way to were they are now. Yet they still stick together and continue on to their journey to pursuer.

The film shows how they still use dancing and music to express themselves. They have not lost what they hold close and dear to them because it is all they have left from where they are. The whole movie follows them with little to no dialectical at all. The use of the music is what makes the movie so powerful because it is the way you feel the emotion of the the people who are walking through the places. It is somehow like the music is speaking for them and only for them. They are not playing it for no one else other then themselves and the ones who care to listen.

The film over all really did show the pain that the gypsies go through and have went through all this time. You can't help but want to listen to their music to feel what they feel because they deserve to tell their story and they deserve to be listened too.",1390953600,,1241,4.254237288135593
827074,5,6304263198,"The Rom people are performers and musicians, adapting to the fashion, instruments and styles of music in which country they are. They move around most of Western Europe working together as a unit in harmony. In their music you can always hear the running of a horse, turning anything they can into music, including a broken guitar string. Even though they are uneducated in the traditional sense they can tell a story through song and dance, which are beautiful in sound and sight. Most of these stories are of suffering that the Rom people have encountered over the last 1,000 years since they left India.
They are chameleons molding to everything and maybe that is why people fear them. People have treated them as outsiders. Shunned and chased away, even though all they wanted was to blend in and move on. They are so hated, that at a time they were persecuted, hunted and killed as though they were dogs. Even rewards were given for every person killed.
How are they so scary and horrible to be killed? Is it because they live outside of what we deem the norm? Maybe it is the fact that they have the freedom to move from place to place with no attachment. Or even, wanting to do nothing but their art, living inside it and never leaving it. All of these reasons are not worthy to be treated as dogs, or as said in the film worse than dogs.
I think this movie gives people a better look at what they truly are, people who travel and play music as a living, nothing more nothing less. I think their culture is beautiful, focusing on something they love no matter what everyone else thinks of them. I hope this video makes peoples opinions change about the Rom people.",1390867200,,1671,4.5
827075,4,6304263198,"Exile. Latcho Drom, directed by Tony Gatlif, features the Romani peoples journey as they travel from north-west India to Spain covering areas between such as Egypt, Turkey and France. Often referred to as gypsies, the Romani people have been traveling all across Europe for over 1,000 years since fleeing from India. Instead of restricting themselves to one particular place, they choose to be in continuous exile surrounded by their families and tribal groups. They are the representation of freedom, free from stereotypes and prejudice and free to go wherever they please. They are a very tight knit community and adapt easily to whatever culture they find themselves in.

The film itself has very little dialogue and uses only what is necessary to grasp the meaning of a song or a conversation. Instead of using words to express emotions and communicate with each other, they use music to tell their own story through dance and song. The use of music is highly important, to them music is always free and anyone can enjoy it for no cost. The Rom people aim to entertain, whether it is playing the sitar or singing and dancing underneath the moonlight, everything consists of music. If its one thing that this film proves, it is that music and dance are almost as important as air and water for our species survival.

Overall, this is a rare film that recognizes just how important music is in our lives. Everything about the film including its recording, cinematography and vivid imagery are very well done and are shown in such a way that the director enables us to see into a world we would never otherwise see and crosses the language barrier with music. With the Rom people always being persecuted and victimized for their way of life, this film gives them a voice in their own language.",1390867200,,1794,4.802588996763754
827076,4,6304263198,"Latcho Drom tells the story of the Roma people. Known primarily as gypsies, the Roma are nomadic people and live wherever they can. They are seen as outcast and are looked down upon by every culture that they come across. Tormented and excluded but, prefer to live apart from the main stream culture. They are saved and cursed by their lifestyle. Wandering from town to town adapting to the culture to try to fit in while still being a secluded set of people. The Roma sing and dance basically giving away their art to everyone. They live together and try to blend in with others outside their tight nit culture.

This film depicts these same aspect of the Roma people and their problems. The film begins with a group of Roma traveling from place to place in need of water and having to work together and adapt to survive. This same occurrence follows the people across borders and through several different cultures. Each one more difficult for the Roma people to fit in and be accepted. They perform and speak in native tongue to make others feel more at ease around them but, still people look down and show nothing but hate towards them. A little boy offers them money to play music for his mother. The Roma give the boy back his money. They feel music is free. The more that other people despised them, the more you feel bad for them. These people are just trying to be free and live a joyous and free spirited life.

When i first stated watching this film i was very confused because of the lack of subtitles. Upon further discussion and watching more of the film i realized that the words aren't necessary for the most part to understand how these people feel. They want to be accepted for being free. They want to perform and be who they are and not be condemned to live like criminals or thrash. At the end of the film, when the women is singing how people treat her worse than they treat animals was a very shocking moment. These people just want to be who they are and left alone. People are scared of what they don't know and people don't know what it's life to be truly free like the Roma are. They have such a unity with each other and work together so well. Their music is always very upbeat and has many percussion sounds and instruments. The Roma are passionate people and their art is in a sense just who they are as performers and people. These people are exiled for being free, passionate and unified people and this film does an incredible justice at pulling back the curtain with these people and giving you a glimpse at the truth.",1390780800,,2553,4.44136460554371
827077,4,6304263198,"Latcho Drom is a unique film that captures the sense of exile that the Roma feel because the alternative lifestyle that they live. This film borders on musical, fiction and documentary however, does not fall into any one of these. The techniques that were used in filming and directing this movie provide the viewer with a deeper insight into the struggles that the Roma people faced as they fulfill their nomadic lifestyle by traveling to different countries while constantly performing for others and themselves.
 The film clearly portrays their struggle with being such outsiders to the locals at every place they visit. It depicts them being looked down upon, being chased away and sometimes just ignored. This is the lifestyle that these people choose to live. Although they feel as though they do not get the respect they deserve they keep to themselves in their close knit community and continue to travel. Their ultimate freedom is sometimes what ends up scaring the people they come contact with.
 One of the abilities of the Roma that the movie displays is their knack to adapt so well into each country that they visit. They dress like the locals sing in the local dialect and hang out in popular spots to perform their music for everyone. This ability is almost counter-intuitive to their way of life as outsiders. They have the ability to blend in yet they still choose this outsider lifestyle thats gets them noticed in a negative way.  The negative way that they are perceived leads to endless struggles that they have to deal with on their journeys.",1390780800,,1565,4.853932584269663
827078,4,6304263198,"Exile. Before watching Latcho Drom I was unaware about gypsies. I knew nothing about their culture or the kind of lives they lived. In the beginning of the film I was confused but also intrigued. It began with a boy singing about being married while walking through the dessert. I was confused because the entire song he was singing did not have subtitles. I realized; however, that the subtitles were not necessary to figure out the mood of the scenes. The gypsies were nomads traveling through the dessert searching for water. It amazed me how far they were able to travel to find the resources they needed to survive.

 My favorite part of the film had to have been when the gypsies played the music for the little boy. The little boy offered to pay them money to play music for him, but the gypsies turned it down. They do not believe that music should be payed for. They lived to play music and entertain. I love this about gypsies. It seems that all they wanted out of life was freedom and happiness. The music they played really grabbed my attention. I find it crazy that every hand motion/dance move they perform has a meaning behind it. Especially during the one scene where they show a marriage ceremony. There are so many hand gestures going on in that scene. I though it was just a way of dancing. I found it even more interesting to learn that each movement they did actually meant something meaningful to them. Another thing I think is interesting about the music in the movie, is that every song the gypsies played had the rhythm of a horse running in it. I think that is probably because they were always on the move and traveling, and they wanted to honor that by using the sound of their transportation.

To be honest, watching this film almost made me want to be a gypsy. They are such free spirits and everyone fears them. The gypsies stick together and secluded themselves from everyone. They stayed within their own group and wanted to be left alone. I do not understand why people viewed them as such a threat. It astounds me that in Germany gypsies are killed/hunted for a reward. There is a scene in the movie where one of the gypsies say ""Some evenings, like many other evenings, I find myself envying the respect that you give your dog."" That is horrible to me that people treated their dogs better than they treated the gypsies. The gypsies were treated just as poorly as Jewish people were back in the day. All in all, the movie mostly intrigued me. The life of a gypsy is one of the most interesting things that I have learned about. This movie really gave me incite into the lives of gypsies and they way that they felt.

827079,4,6304263198,"Latcho Drom is a very insightful film that uncovers the harsh exile of the Roma people. This movie takes you on their brave and spiritual journey from India to Hungry (with the intention of ending up in Germany). With very little dialogue, this film educates us about the conflicting stereotypes towards the Roma and the general history that has been overlooked worldwide. All the embellished jewelry and thievery is just a small fraction of a dying culture. The movie defines the Roma philosophy into two different categories: political and social.
During the Holocaust, it was the Roma people who were the first to be ostracized and killed. This historical fact presents itself at the end of the film when a Roma Holocaust survivor sings a song about her time in Auschwitz. Throughout the film each song gets a little darker than the next and reflects each country they are currently in. On the way over to France, this little Roma girl sings a song on a train and says, The whole world is against usWe survive as hounded thieves, but barely a nail we have stolen at the foot of a bloodied Jesus. During their short stay along the fields of southern France, two French men, one with a shotgun, approach their campsite and forbid them from living on the countryside. While in earlier scenes in Romania, the Roma people were treated as equals and they congregated to play Balkan music with the locals. It seems that the more north-west they travel, the more scrutinized they are due to their status within more politically sustained countries.
Socially, the Roma are despised by most people since they are nothing more than drifters. They live their life by their means and live a mostly artistic lifestyle. They are looked down upon because they do not follow the norms of society by applying themselves for jobs and are seen as thieves. There is a scene where a young French boy offers to pay 3 Euro for entertainment from the Roma. The Roma turns down the childs money and plays a song for free. It seems that the Roma do not want to be omit to any request because they have to, but rather they want to be able to express themselves freely without any loss or gain. Though, thievery of course can occur with the Roma, it doesnt mean that this stereotype should define their culture. Romas are very crafty people who provided a variety of art into daily life such as classical guitar and woven utensils. Ultimately, this film has really broaden my knowledge about the Roma people and possibly every facet of their life.",1390435200,,2521,4.693002257336343

When I first started playing flamenco guitar years ago, I had purchased numerous books & videos about the history of flamenco music. This film is perhaps the best at presenting where the roots of the gypsy flamenco music originated. Although, there are many excellent books, they aren't as visually & musically exciting as experiencing it on film. The books give you a more in-depth study but the film compliments any knowledge you can gain from the books. Many people associate flamenco with Spain but they don't realize how much of the gypsy influence originated from as far as India & Egypt, etc. For example, much of the flamenco dancer's hand works originated in India as you can observe in the film when the dancers in India demonstrate their dance. Throughout the journey you get to experience the various cultures of gypsy music including France's guitarist Tchavolo Schmitt, who is influenced by the legendary Django Reinhardt.

I don't remember whether I employed VHS or Betamax because I was using both at the time, but its obvious that both are essentially dead formats, simply because analog formats do not stand up well to the ravages of time. A couple years ago I bought a DVD copy in PAL format, but I misplaced it, and although I think I could have had it converted to NTSC it would probably cost an arm. So I was surprised when I ran across this Korean dub on Amazon. Seems to work fine. You can get lots of similar music from commercial groups such as Taraf de Haidouks, but that's sort of like comparing Atanarjuat the Fast Runner (a fine film) with Nanook of the North, one of the best films ever made.

827535,4,6304263198,"Tony Gatlif, a French film maker of Roma origins, tells us the history of the Roma (Gypsy) people primarily through music, song and dance captured in unforgettable poetic, artistic photography. He takes the viewer on a magical tour of many countries, including Rajasthan, India, Turkey, Egypt, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Spain and France. Having left their original homeland over one thousand years ago, after wandering over many centuries, the Roma settled in different countries in the Middle East and throughout Europe. The film captivates the viewer via the strong sense of family, community and camaraderie depicted throughout, no matter the country in which they live. Wherever they are, the Roma express their traditional values which includes music, song and dance that is both joyful and sad. At times, the songs speak of separation, loneliness and isolation because of their unique lifestyle which often clashes with the mainstream culture in which they reside. It is totally fascinating to view the continuity of the traditional values expressed by the Roma despite living in different countries. It is equally fascinating to view the differences in music and adaptations which naturallly evolved as the Roma developed roots in the respective countries that they now call ""home.""

Since the film is not narrated, it relies heavily on artistic photography, real life images, and the lyrics of songs to provide a lasting impression and ultimate message to the viewer which can be both a plus as well as a  minus. For instance, I had difficulty determining the exact country which was the focus during the filming which detracted from my understanding and enjoyment of the film. It was not clear to me when there was a change of venue. Although, it is clear that flamenco dancing expresses the Roma influence on the Spanish culture I am still unsure when the filming crew entered France. I would love to know in what country the Roma build tree houses that include a wooden platform for the floor and narrow tree branches to make a ladder. The fact is, at times I had to guess which country was featured and this reduced my enjoyment of the film. Despite this drawback, the creative cinematic images and impressive selection of music, lyrics and songs casts a mesmerizing spell over the viewer leaving indelible impressions which are worth savoring and remembering.

827541,5,6304263198,"Latcho Drom is mesmerizing, the people magical and the music unforgettable.

There is no dialogue, but this does nothing to detract from the film's integrity or entertainment value.  Although Rom diaspora has resulted in the Roma living in just about every country on earth, Latcho Drom presents the viewer with a tranche de vie of the Roma people in Africa, Egypt, Turkey, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, France and Spain.

The Romanian Roma (the two are mutually exclusive) instantly pulled me under their spell. Upon first impression, the Romanian ""gypsies"" might look like a ragtag band of amateurs.  In short order, however, this misconception is swiftly dispelled as these musical maestros fill the air with their art - all deftly orchestrated and delivered.

The women of the Romanian village are peripheral figures in the sense that they are not part of the music making, but prominent nonetheless as they emerge, one by one, upon hearing the first strains of music.  While the men take up their assorted string instruments as well as cymbalom, flute, accordian and clarinet, the women stay outside, but on the sidelines. There they engage in the merriment -  dancing, clapping and laughing -  while occasionally stirring the huge black pots of stew that sit outside the houses.

There is another group shown - but not nearly long enough - and that is the Hungarian Roma.  The scene opens with a young woman and small boy waiting for the train.  The woman is morose and despondent on the gray, drizzly winter day; it's hard not to feel compassion for her but especially for her little boy who seems desperately in need of a plan to cheer her up.

Succor comes swiftly in the form of a passel of gypsies who conspire to entertain the woman from the other side of the railroad tracks.  The woman's child mimes them from across the tracks, complete with clapping, knee slapping and other antics.  By the time the scene has ended with the train arriving, the mother is no longer dour and we are left wishing the train had been late.

Latcho Drom is both an auditory and visual gift to yourself or to whomever you wish to give it.  Most of all, though, the people and music in Latcho Drom will leave their special signatures on your heart and soul.",1225497600,2,2247,4.752577319587629
827542,5,6304263198,"Years ago, when Latcho Drom was playing in theaters in the San Francisco Bay area, I went to see it as many times as I could.  Due to its popularity, it was even re-run occasionally, over the years, at the independent art theaters, and paired with the equally beautiful movie ""Baraka"" (what a fabulous double-header THAT was).  I've also rented it many times on DVD and was sad when my favorite indie movie store closed down a couple of years ago...I was sad for the store, of course, but even sadder that someone on the staff nabbed their one copy of Latcho Drom before the doors were opened to let the public buy out their stock.  Sigh...the staff knew what all the best foreign films were and the top three I was hoping to get were all gone.  Latcho Drom was at the top of the list.

I wish that they had continued into England and Ireland, but that is a minor quibble. Each scene goes directly into the performances, with so much feeling and joy.

827643,5,6304263198,"The Gypsies left their original homeland in northern India around 1000AD. This much has been established by historical and linguistic research, but the reason for their exodus westward is less certain. They reached Europe by the early C14th, crossing from Asia Minor by way of Crete and the Peloponnesus, and continued their dispersal westward and northward. By the end of the C14th they were already settled in large numbers in the Balkans and Danube lands, where an undeveloped economic structure and primitive technology gave Gypsy smiths and cobblers the chance to compete with local artisans. Early accounts of their arrival suggest that the curiosity and sympathy they originally aroused were accompanied by suspicion and hostlity, and soon their status changed dramatically from protected guests to persecuted outlaws. Within a 100 years of their first appearance, most countries in western Europe had passed savage laws for their expulsion: some even legislated to include the death penalty. 'Lacho Drom' is a wonderful travelogue of Rom music which traces this migration. The music and demeanour of the people says it all; languages that transcend regional barriers. Clearly, by Czechoslovakia, we have entered the Rom estate popularised by European literature's cliches, extolled by the excessive practice of all vices known to Man. The film's concluding lament caps an increasingly sad tale of persecution born, nevertheless, with brave equanimity. The appropriate footnote, if you can source it, is Joseph Koudelka's grave portfolio of Gypsies that was published by Aperture in the mid 1970s. I hestitate to trumpet aesthetics here, where it obviously hurts, but Koudelka's images are some of the most stunningly beautiful you'll ever see. There's nothing vouyeristic about Koudelka as in nearly every instance he's acknowledged by his subjects. And that implicit trust is rarely evinced anywhere, anytime, resulting in a candour that might well move you to tears.",1159142400,7,1976,5.46078431372549

827813,5,6304263198,"This is an astonishing film. It traces the Rom people from India to Egypt, Turkey, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary, France and Spain, through their music and dance. There is very little dialogue, and little explanation, except at the film's beginning, which briefly states that the Rom left India hundreds of years ago and made their way north, for reasons now unclear.

Further explanation is not really needed, however, as one can see for oneself the poverty, misery, and oppression that the Rom suffer worldwide, to this day. In one particularly poignant cut, an elderly Rom woman sings about Auschwitz. ""In Auschwitz we had no bread,"" she sings. ""The kapos were so cruel."" She holds a small photograph, perhaps of her father or husband who perished, and one sees the number tattooed on her arm. Other songs remark upon the Roma's constant flight from hatred and oppression. One sees, here, in this film, as they are chased from camp sites, forced to move their caravans.

In the closing segment, a family is chased from abandoned buildings in which they had been squatting. They sing as the doors and windows are bricked up, and the police arrive. ""Why does your evil mouth spit on me?"" a chanteuse wails, in the same style and strain of music one had heard from her Roma compatriots at the film's beginning, in India. ""Why do you treat me like a dog?""

Most remarkably, however, this film juxtaposes the Roma's dignity with their suffering. We see, firsthand, their poverty, the social ostracism they face ubiquitously. Yet we also see their ingrained joy of living, their indomitable spirit. The film provides a magnificent, delightful musical display of multi-lingual Rom genius, recounting in song and dance their history and the extent of their travels.

It is a gift to--and from--the Rom, to all humanity.

This is a fabulous journey with groups of Gypsies throughout the Middle East and Europe. A truly outstanding documentary that I highly recommend -- but it's more about visuals than about words. Writer/director Tony Gatlif, who is descended from the Rom himself, has created a memorable and poignant film in Latcho Drom. It won at the Cannes Film Festival in 1993 (the Prix Gervais, specifically). In this film, you travel with various groups of Gypsies through Rajasthan, Egypt, Turkey, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, France and Spain.
There's no dialog, and the songs these Gypsies sing are only partially translated. It's a ""fly on the wall"" experience, where the images speak for themselves. You will watch the joy, the pain, and the hardship of these people, all under the unblinking eye of the camera.
I think it will stay with you long after the movie ends, and as many times as I have watched this, it never fails to move me. It's a marvelous film, that probably could never have been made if Gatlif was not of the Romany people himself.",1047427200,23,1235,4.9423076923076925

The sound and video often do not match up which is very distracting and the quality of the video suffers quite often.  I have seen this movie on a vhs tape which did not have any of those issues.  I was so happy when I found this available on dvd, playable in my region... but now I am very disappointed due to the very poor quality.... it's almost as if this copy was made in someones basement bootleg business.",1454716800,5,716,4.386363636363637

and the DVD is defective. It gets to about 10 minutes before the movie ends and stops. You can't finish watching it.
This movie is so good and I was so excited to share it. I almost gave this to a friend for a birthday gift. Thing is, all
I can do it return it and get refunded. I just want a copy that is not defective, and I don't think I should have to go through
the pain of taking it some place to get it back to wherever it came from to get a copy that works for my $24.99. When
I got the wrong item once from Amazon a few years ago it was much simpler; they just sent me the correct item and
didn't ask me to send anything back. Oh well...If you are looking for an amazing movie, just watch this online.",1453593600,3,833,3.793103448275862
