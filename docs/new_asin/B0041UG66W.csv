8588165,5,B0041UG66W,For a musical reunion just after Holy Week and Nikolaus Harnoncourt's death I played this DVD. It's a concert in a very beautiful benedictine chapel in Austria. Played with ancient instruments as it's usual with Harnoncourt and his Concentus Musicus Wien and with an incredible cast of singers. All I can say is we were all enthralled and moved by this concert. By the way the sound and image are top notch.,1459987200,,407,4.666666666666667
