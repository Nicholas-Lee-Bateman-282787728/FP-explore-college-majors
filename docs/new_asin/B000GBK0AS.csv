I found a similarity in the two films in that we see rather than hear the intense emotions in both female protagonists. This experience is not unusual in a silent film but somewhat of a novelty in a modern one.

Fonteyne accomplishes this intensity by filming the pivotal scenes without dialogue. What we see is Emmanuelle Devos' face and eyes expressing her intense feelings. We viewers know, without being told explicitly, that tragedy awaits her. We see it and we feel it intensely. There is no grand summary or confrontation; there is no mediation of language to protect us from her sadness and her tragedy.

Additionally, natural symbols abound. After the beginning of the affair in summer, frigid winter falls. Her sadness deepens and her suspicions are confirmed. She works; she gives birth. She nurtures her selfish and childish husband as he suffers from Victorine's rejection. Her downfall follows her triumph over Victorine, when she realizes she lives with an empty shirt she scrubs clean.

All in all La Femme de Gilles is a magnificient silent film.",1205107200,3,1181,5.010204081632653
8130519,5,B000GBK0AS,"I absolutely loved this film.  I saw it in theatres, and was moved by its beautiful cinematography and intense emotions.  It is the story of the hardworking Elisa and her husband, Gilles; her entire life revolves around her tiny home and her family, whom she dearly loves.  I won't say anything more than that, so as to not ruin the ending, but I will say this - you won't see it coming.  Even if you're not a fan of French or foreign films, give this one a try.  It's truly wonderful.",1165795200,2,485,4.285714285714286
