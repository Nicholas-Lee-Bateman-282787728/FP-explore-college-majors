At last we can see this film in excellent print and the better for it; now it can truly be appreaciated as it should:-))

Vera Zorina glows in this - her finest as an actress:-))",1443571200,3,351,4.318181818181818
8661943,4,B00KVPC17Y,"Nothing the least bit boring in this film. Very interesting watching Lorre & Von Stroheim working with Ms Zorina. Great character actors,Sig Rumann,Cora Witherspoon among them. The team of Lorre/Zorina/Von Stroheim pass off paste as heirloom jewels. Greene is an intended target,but Zorina falls for him.",1439683200,3,304,5.630434782608695
