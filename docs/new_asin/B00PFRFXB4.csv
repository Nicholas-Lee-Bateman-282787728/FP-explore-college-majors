6798086,5,B00PFRFXB4,"With the huge sales success of the first three ""Little House on the Prairie"" seasons on Blu Ray Lionsgate has come out of the ball park and released season four. These ARE the uncut original NBC episodes that have not been seen since the network first aired in them in the 1970's and are an immense improvement over the paltry DVD sets a Canadian company had put out years ago.

 The 1977-1978 season of ""Little House on the Prairie"" would be a banner year for the show. The series ended up as the 7th most popular show on U.S. television and many believe this is due to the incredibly strong writing and story changes that made the series even better. The first episode deals with the loss of Jack, Laura's beloved shaggy dog and how she deals with losing him. However, the real big story archs occurred at the end of the season when Mary goes blind permanently and Walnut Grove becomes a ghost town. This is the last we see of school teacher Miss Beatle.

 Talk also has it that Lionsgate plans to release seasons 5 and 6 this year so look out for those sets!!!

 UPDATE: February 2, 2015. News out today that ""Little House on the Prairie-Season 5"" will be released on April 14, 2015!!! Look for a review of that here!!!! Enjoy!",1421971200,5,1230,4.420353982300885
6798087,5,B00PFRFXB4,Happy they have finally released LHOTP in the uncut version. Has good picture and sound. Happy to see the scenes that cable networks cut.,1421712000,2,137,4.75
6798088,5,B00PFRFXB4,"Only the Digital Remastered version by Lionsgate that's coming out a season at a time is what we're buying.  The picture and sound are perfect.  We've bought the first 4 seasons and my two teens (16 & 15 yrs old) are addicted.  They actually cheer that we get to watch LHOP tonight!!  Good, clean, true family movies!!  Extremely happy to own!",1421625600,18,343,4.557377049180328
6798089,5,B00PFRFXB4,"This is one of my favorite shows, and I am so happy it is now in HD.  Any fan of the show will love the H.D. version.  Awesome.",1421452800,5,127,3.5
6798090,5,B00PFRFXB4,"Lionsgate has done another fantastic job with the season four blu-ray and dvd releases of LHOTP. Like the first three seasons, this set looks incredible and is a vast improvement over the original dvd set. The show is presented over 5 discs in its original 1:33 full frame format. All of the episodes run 48-49 minutes long and all appear to be uncut and are not time compressed.

The audio (English, Spanish, and French 2.0) is also an improvement. By no means would I use this to demonstrate my new sound system but the audio is clear and the pitch of the actors' voices are correct as the episodes are no longer sped up as in the previous dvd set. There are English subtitles only in this set.

I highly recommend this set and looking forward to Season 5. Lionsgate has released four seasons in less than a year. I hope Lionsgate releases the rest LHOTP seasons this quickly and with this much care. If you own the previous dvds and are on the fence about double-dipping with this one, trust me, sell the old set and buy this. This is one double-dip that is really worth it.",1418428800,35,1077,4.434343434343434

6798150,5,B00PFRFXB4,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

It seems as if television has abandoned family programming these days. Even shows that I enjoy feel more geared towards adults than to kids. Perhaps networks feel there is no hope in gathering young viewers when they have to compete with iPads and PlayStation. It seems they also feel that they must pander to the most basic of instincts, sex, to get viewers rather than realize that a good storytelling will draw in everyone. What surprises me more is their insistence to ignore the fact that family movies do so well at the box office. The recent release of WAR ROOM, a Christian based film, stunned Hollywood when it did so well at the box office. The same holds true for Disney films that continue to dominate the box office when released. So why cant they do the same on TV? Who knows?

Until they come to their senses those seeking something their entire family can watch can turn to the world of DVD that brings back the shows of the past that the whole group can watch. And one of the most successful of those shows was LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE. Led by Michael Landon both in front of and behind the camera, the series presented the Ingalls family and their struggle to survive as settlers in the Midwest. Based on the popular series of childrens book it was a hit that stunned the same execs that are mystified today. Maybe they won't learn.

Lionsgate has been offering the various seasons of the hit show in individual sets or in one huge box set for the whole series. If your budget is like mine the single seasons make sense. So what does season 4 offer? Well the same things we saw in the first three seasons basically but with each season having its own specific share of stories.

Many of the stories from this season seemed to take place on the road. Either Charles (Landon) was trying to find work elsewhere or taking someone to a different town or on a trip to a city like Chicago. This resulted in a story involving a hired hand on the farm that sent tongues wagging. The series also began to show that Mary Ingalls (Melissa Sue Anderson) was growing up, having her take on a teaching position at a school that presented a confrontation.

Of course Laura (Melissa Gilbert) remained the focal point of the series with several adventures of her own. One involved finding a baby to take care of and another had her working alongside a friend to solve a mystery. An interest in boys for Laura wasn't quite yet a mix in the plots but the seeds were being sown.

The season also featured friend of the Ingalls John Garvey (ex-football star Merlin Olsen) in several shows as well. This was his first year on the series and he stayed on until season 7. Garveys son on the show became a close friend of Laura and the possibility of young romance could have happened. Watch subsequent seasons to see if it worked out.

Perhaps the most important thing to happen in this season involved Mary. Working as a teacher was her goal in life. That seemed to become a problem in the last two episodes when Mary began having problems with her vision. Would she be able to carry on with her dream if she became blind? Fans already know the answer to this question and what happened. If you aren't aware then its time you started watching this series.

What made this series work was that it wasn't something that you had to worry if your kids could watch it or not. At the same time it was one that kids enjoyed as well. That combination of something for both adults AND kids made it a staple for years. As I said earlier, it seems thats not the case these days. With less than savory hijinks on shows like GOTHAM (which appears during what was once known as the family hour) and with political correctness being included in THE MUPPETS new series, shows that families can feel comfort with are rare. Perhaps it does make sense to return to the ones you trusted in the past. This release makes that possible.",1445904000,,3966,4.460689655172414

6798166,5,B00PFRFXB4,"""Little House On The Prairie""
Season 4
(NBC/Lionsgate, 2015)
. . . . .

In its fourth season, NBC's ""Little House On The Prairie"" rebounded in the ratings, becoming one of the top ten shows of 1977-78, with strong scripts and solid performances across the board. It was a well-oiled machine by that time and, as in earlier seasons, a welcome respite from the harder-edged, more cynical entertainment that proliferated in movies and TV during the 1970s.

The earnest, family-oriented show toughened itself up a bit, though, with a reality-facing season that begins with the death of the Ingalls family's beloved dog, Jack, and goes on to include episodes that deal with an accidental death by drowning, child kidnapping and -- following the lead of the original books -- the blindness of Laura's older sister Mary, the result of infection by what they believed to have been scarlet fever. It's a lot to handle, particularly on a show that cultivated an air of innocence, but the drama was compelling and Season Four of LHOTP proved to be the highest rated of the series.

As ever, Melissa Gilbert anchors the show as the ever-charming, ever-honest Laura, though other actors gain in stature as well, notably Alison Arngrim who gets deliciously wicked as Laura's antagonist, Nellie Oleson - one of the great, classic ""bad guys"" of kids TV.

""Little House On The Prairie"" holds up remarkably well for a forty-year old TV show, particularly one aimed at a younger audience. The timeless quality of its historical setting helps -- the show is just as much an escape from gritty modern violence now as it was then -- though its sometimes hokey production values are also charming, as are the formulaic, evenly paced scripts. The one enduring criticism of the show is its lack of ethnic diversity, with practically no significant non-white characters. This is just something you have to accept with the territory, and will be more troubling to some viewers, less so to others. But all in all, this was a quality production, and remains compelling to modern viewers, particularly those with an interest in historical fiction and frontiers-y Americana. Recommended!

6798173,4,B00PFRFXB4,"Like most season's of Little house on the prairie, this one also is somewhat uplifting. A lot of hardships face the Ingalls and they eventually tackle their problems. Still, it lacks in portraying the real life of a pioneer family living in the 18th century. Most people are familiar with this show and for those who enjoyed it, that fact obviously didn't bother them. Personally speaking, I like to see the characters of whatever show/film I'm watching to represent accuracy. Yet, that can easily be overlooked. The show has a way of getting the viewer accustomed to its imperfections and overall, it's a nice, wholesome show.",1430697600,,627,4.9245283018867925

6798187,4,B00PFRFXB4,"Show is still great, but it definitely loses a bit of steam in the fourth season, primarily because Mr. Edwards is gone and kids are getting older (call it the Brady Bunch Syndrome). The Blu-Ray picture is stunningly clear, perhaps too clear. It can be a tad disconcerting seeing Doc Baker and Reverend Alden up so close! I actually prefer watching the show on DVD.",1427673600,,365,4.630769230769231
6798188,5,B00PFRFXB4,You really won't find me rating a LHOP boxset any less than 5 stars simply because they are the best. I love this series a lot. It was dear to me as a child and brings back wonderful memories when I watch them now. I also enjoy sharing them with my own children.

6798194,5,B00PFRFXB4,"I purchased Seasons 3 and 4 as a gift for my 16 year old Grand Daughter, who has fallen hard for the Series! She is working her way through all episodes,and learning ""history"" along the way. She has commented to me how the children's individual chalk boards on which to practice letters and math skills was an eye opener for her!!  This was a generation of strong, hardy individuals - probably hard for our children ,who live now in the world of fast moving technology, to comprehend.",1425254400,,484,4.563218390804598

6798197,5,B00PFRFXB4,"My wife loves these. Great video and sound quality and -- apparently -- chunks of the shows have been restored that had been left out in earlier ""Complete Season"" compilations. I like the fact that we get both the DVD and the VUDU versions so, unless the Internet goes down, we can put the DVDs up on the shelf and only use them in ""emergencies.""",1424822400,,346,4.338461538461538

6798200,5,B00PFRFXB4,"TV is dead to me basically, the trash and filth we see is just disgusting.  There's no better way to erase that trash than watching Little House on the Prairie. This is absolutely the best the shows have ever looked, and sounded. Not to mention there are scenes on nearly every episode I havent' seen before. Nothing has been cut, nothing at all.  Keep your kids with the Ingalls family for as long as you can, God bless to all.",1424649600,32,428,4.3375

6798204,5,B00PFRFXB4,"First of all I want to point out that I haven't seen that older DVD release of the show. I'm sure the quality of this Blu-Ray release is from another planet compared to that but since I have only seen this, there are a few complaints in the picture I've noticed.

One, episode 12: feels like they have done the restoration of the title sequence with left hand, it's a bit grainy and not as sharp as the rest of them.

Two, episode 19: first two shots at the beginning of the episode give me a cause of complaint. First one is extremely grainy and in second one picture wobbles a bit. After that there the picture is clear during the rest of the episode.

Three, episode 21: same as with episode 12, but this time in end credits. Picture isn't as sharp as in rest of them.

Now, as I stated in headline, I'd give this release four and half stars if it was possible because of these observations. But since it's not, full five stars is absolutely correct star count, those points being only hairsplitting. Being a perfectionist though (I wish I wasn't) I find it frustrating that they have left those there, I'm sure it would have been an easy job to clear them out.",1424304000,,1164,4.325688073394495
6798205,5,B00PFRFXB4,Great. The price is amazing.  I grew up watching Little House. .  can't say enough good about it.  I do wish it had an insert like my old set that told you what each episode is about.,1424217600,,183,3.891891891891892

The sound is amazing, and David Rose's music has never sounded better.  The scenes are not hacked at the commercial breaks either, unlike the older DVD version.  If you have the older Season 4 from several years back, this is well worth the upgrade, especially on blu-ray.",1423267200,,485,5.0375

6798214,5,B00PFRFXB4,"This is the best season. The HD quality is outstanding. If you really want to see them fresh than the HD prints online from VUDU and Amazon Instant Video are the best.
Michael Landon actually filmed these in Panavision. On my 42 inch screen when viewing through VUDU or Amazon the aspect ratio is 1.37:1. The prints are more relaxed and not stretched or compressed like the syndicated garbage we have been watching all these years. It is pillar boxed meaning black borders on all 4 sides. No full screen bloat. The camera angles and vistas are just wonderful. It is like viewing them for the first time.
The colors are vivid and I can actually see Melissa Gibert's acne on her forehead in a few scenes. Just wonderful!",1422921600,,718,4.573643410852713

I enjoyed the programming showing the old All-American values of honesty and virtue.  The programming teaches little lessons in life without the profanity now found on television.

PROS:
- Basic values of a time long gone
- Clean programming that can be viewed by all
- Teaches life lessons and challenges to kids
CONS:
- None",1533600000,,455,4.524390243902439

This last season- most of the episodes were solid but one of the DVDs is filled with all silly, romantic episodes that were frankly, just nonsensical.  My daughter didn't like them and I didn't either.  The rest were good.  This is the first season where I thought some of the shows started to lose a little bit of narrative quality.",1515888000,,432,4.3625
