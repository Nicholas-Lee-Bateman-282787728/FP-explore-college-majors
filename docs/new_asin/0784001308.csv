71581,5,0784001308,"This is my favorite version of this movie. All the actors and actresses are so colorful and real.

Every character was played well. Chris Sarandon's portrayal of Sydney Carton was nothing short of haunting. I'll go through my take on them.

Lucy - privileged to a degree, but refined and poised in the best sense of the word, possessed a kind, gentle spirit. And, of course, she was attractive.

Madam Defarge - a woman who by nature seemed devoid of compassion, was dealt a hard hand in life. She was not unattractive, but her difficult life showed in her face. Great casting. A cruel act was committed by Marquis Evrmonde to Defarge's child, and his response was just as cruel. This fueled her growing feelings of hatred and justified in her mind, taking pleasure in others' pain. It propelled her to her own acts of cruelty, which, in turn, increased her hatred, which hatred removed the normal barriers our minds have against cruelty. Her barriers kept crumbling and her cruelty and determination kept increasing, though it never seemed to be enough. At some point, while dwelling continuously on that cruel act, she became obsessed with destroying. At first Marquis Evrmonde, then the entire Evrmonde family, then anyone who dared stand in her way. Even her husband said it was too much.

--> Side note: Skip the paragraph that follows if you'd like because it's not directly about the book, but my feelings about hatred, resentment and forgiveness, all of which were portrayed stunningly in this film.

The ""Madam Defarge"" in all of us. Hatred is like that, isn't it? We're all capable of it. The only way out is letting go, forgiving. Some mistake forgiving for justifying a perpetrator's act, or providing an excuse for what someone did. It is neither - we should never justify or make excuse for another's harmful action. It would be wrong, and that's probably a part of how they became capable of harming others. No, forgiving is nothing more than choosing to not resent, hate, or have bad feelings toward someone because they harmed us. The reason it's the only way out and the only real closure, is that it's impossible for any of us to hate or resent a single person. Instead, hatred and resentment are always felt toward two people, our target and ourselves. Forgiving another is having the mind set of: ""What you did was wrong and did great damage. I can't and wouldn't take away your responsibility to own it, to be deeply sorry, and to undo the damage and make recompense the best you're able. But whether you choose to or not, I refuse to have bad feelings toward you, because I'm the only one who actually feels these bad feeling."" Choosing to forgive someone is only choosing to love ourselves. Sorry for being off topic, but if I can help one person break free from the misery caused by harboring feelings of resentment, it was worth it.
<-- end of side note.

Miss Pross, Lucy's caretaker - older and skinnier than the strong and substantial Defarge. Very protective of Lucy. This spunky, witty, wisecracking caretaker had spine and backed down from no one. I won't spoil it but just say she stood toe to toe with the younger, bigger and stronger Madam Defarge, and held her own.

The Banker - did a superb job of portraying both a realist when it came to money at the same time as being a kind and decent man.

The Chemist - Even the Chemist, who played a short part in the apothecary that Carton visited. The way he insists on payment, even the way he looks at Carton with one eyebrow raised. Excellent acting.

Servant girl to the aristocrats - wondering why she was dying, but trying hard to be brave;

Charles Darney - Played a gentleman, a good and decent man, a selfless and brave man.

Sydney Carton - The two acted so differently I didn't realize at first they were both Chris Sarandon. He played man who's life was a failure in his own eyes, and thought of himself as not a good person. He was melancholic and resigned, and said something to the effect, ""The way I grew up is now way for a boy to grow up."" - mangled I'm sure. Someone please correct it if anyone knows it. Yet had some fight left in him, which he spent trying still to win Lucy's heart. This movie had great acting and a number of compelling characters, but if you asked me who this movie was about, I'd say Sydney Carton, without hesitation. This character was more than compelling. His portrayal was nothing less than haunting, and left you thinking about his life long after the movie ended.",1101513600,12,4493,4.60375
71582,5,0784001308,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I thought this presentation was far superior to the Ronald Coleman version. I believe that Chris Sarandon showed a much wider range of emotion and feeling in the Carton role than did Coleman. Moreover, the person in the Coleman version playing Charles Darney hardly resembled Carton, which was essential for one to believe that such an ending could occur. Further, in this version, I could actually believe that Carton had found some semblence of peace and joy in the sacrifice he had made--dying--so that the person he loved would be happy. Up to then his life was a mess--dissipation, cynicism, and recklessness. It shows how genuine love can sometimes turn a person's life completely around.",1097625600,16,730,5.041322314049586
71583,5,0784001308,". . .it was a good watch anyway.  Chris Sarandon was outstanding in the roles he played of look-alikes Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton.  He captured Carton's sardonic humor well, and evoked his melancholic fatalism and innate dignity with much pathos.  A quite elderly Kenneth More put on a great performance as the officious but kindly banker, whose character provided much humorous dialogue.  The character of Miss Pross, the sharp-eyed chaperone, was absolutely wonderful.

I never expect a movie to follow a novel very closely -- books and films are two completely different art forms and cannot be translated one to the other with good effect.  As the movie begins we see the words ""Based on the novel by Charles Dickens.""  With those words we are given fair warning that what is to follow is an interpretation of Dickens' vision.
What this film did was capture what is so wonderful about Dickens' novels -- the alternation between the humor and the darkness at the center of much human experience.  The scenes were knit together flawlessly, so that a rather complicated plot taking part in two different places came together without confusion or awkward transitions.  The pacing was artfully done, and the last 40 minutes or so were very suspenseful.
It's too bad the movie received so many bad reviews because it didn't follow the book.  I've read the book and found it, like many of Dickens' works, to be wonderful, but also probably inaccessible to many readers.  This film takes a good story and opens it up to those who may never open the book.",1087344000,62,1556,4.833962264150943

71608,3,0784001308,"This 1980 film adaptation of Dickens' novel is superior in costume, set design, and cinematography to the 1935 version starring Ronald Colman as Sydney Carton but sadly, it is inferior dramatically.  The acting of the main characters in this version is comparatively wooden (lacking in expressiveness).  In particular, the portrayal of Lucie Manette by  Alice Krige is a pale shadow of Elizabeth Allan's fine performance in the 1935 version.  Nor does Sydney Carton's anguished worship of an idealized ""spiritual"" Lucie quite come off in this 1980 version.  However, David Suchet gives a very convincing performance as the French spy, John Barsad.

While I note the absence of complete fidelity to Dickens' masterful work, the overarching reality is that the basic elements of the story are in the movie version. The majority of my students would never consider voluntarily reading anything Charles Dickens wrote, or books of most of the other writers required in High School and College English/Literature courses. That is fact. These books are all required readings in most liberal arts curricula and literature courses. For sake of worldly reality, it is important that this movie portrayal be watched, learned, and remembered. Dickens' written ""Tale..."", and this movie version that faithfully presented the major detail of the French Revolution as well as a movie could (a movie is limited in what it can portray. It must fit into a small time window--one to two hours at most--whereas a book does not have that limitation.) did accomplish something significant: It portrayed what usually happens when the underdog suddenly becomes the top dog without the necessary preparation. It did portray very well the change in the ruling of the royal, aristocratic, and church class to the ruling of the third estate and the peasants. It also portrayed the effects of over 300 years of church influence on the third estate and peasants in France. NONE!!! This is significant because the church, according to the Bible, is supposed to generate people transformed into the image of Jesus Christ who would not kill, murder, or maim for any reason except possibly for defense of life and limb. So, a larger issue in the French Revolution, graphically portrayed in the Book and the movie, is the effect of Christianity on Frenchpersons. This may seem like a little thing, but it is a big thing in life and reality. Christianity is supposed to promote love and forgiveness and common fellowship in life's realities. The church in France to that time produced the opposite, despite over three centuries of church activity in that nation. The scary thing about the realities portrayed is that Church today is supposed to have the same effect on people now as it did then. That effect is the one of being conformed to the image of Jesus Christ, or as pertains to this movie and book, of not killing your enemies who in reality have done you nothing. As historians know, the church was kicked out of France and replaced with Libert, galit, fraternit.

In sum, not to write too much about this, this movie portrays what can happen when the underdog suddenly becomes the top dog. The reaction to the French Revolution is seen in what happened ultimately because of and to Napoleon. Beethoven tore up the dedication of his Third Symphony (Eroica or Heroic in reference to Napoleon's victories in restoring order in France, etc) because Napoleon set himself up as leader of France to the dismay of many. When he first emerged, the third estate and the peasants thought he was fighting for their cause. Turns out he was fighting for his cause. He was ultimately defeated and the rest is in the history books. However, the end effect of Napoleon was to restore the rulership of the top dogs again and all Europe embraced what Napoleon had accomplished. Political practices and laws were put into effect so that never again could ""the people"" rise up against a government and suddenly become a top dog. Our own Civil War was, in a way, based on the exact same premise: The underdog becoming the top dog, or in the case of our Civil War, two top dogs refusing to become an underdog. In the matter of the Movie, this version with Sarendon et. al. was masterful in its use of time, location, and scenery in its reproduction of the realities of Dickens' Tale of Two Cities. It is a movie people and a good one at that. I will continue showing it to my students. IF I can get them to read the book, I will encourage that as well. But for realities sake, I found it better to show this movie to my students than to require reading the book. I know all of them saw the movie. I was an eyewitness. Finally, for purists, please forgive the many over simplifications in this short narrative.",1371254400,,4372,4.892183288409703

Alice Krige is the loveliest Lucie Manette imaginable - You can perfectly believe that a man would give his life for her sake. Everyone else is splendid - and I have to make special mention of Dame Flora Robson's terrific Miss Pross, and the magnificent Billie Whitelaw (You'll remember her as the original Mrs. Blalock - the Nanny from Hell - in THE OMEN) as Madame Defarge. Dickens said that this character is the Spirit of Revolution personified - displaying both its fierce courage and determination, but also its terrible lack of pity and compassion.

Overview:
Chris Sarandon plays both Sydney Carton and Charles Darnay. Film adaptation remains relatively loyal to the novel, although much dialogue is cut. For example, Dr. Manette's condemnation of the Evrmonde family, especially the Marquis Philippe de Saint Evrmonde, is nearly eliminated. Furthermore, Roger Cly's character is completely eliminated, John Barsad's character is significantly altered (not Miss Pross' long-lost brother), and Jerry Cruncher's character greatly compressed (e.g. no grave robbing scene and no mention of his son).

PS:
In this adaptation, Lorry's bank is unnamed (not Telson's Bank, as it is called in the novel). Also, Gasper clearly murders the Marquis, where in the novel, this is only implied.

Sequence [reveals the plot in detail]:
Film begins with Marquis Evrmonde leaving his home in a carriage. Scene shifts to Gasper's son and some pals who have stolen some food. While running away, Gasper's son falls down and is run over by Evrmonde's carriage, killing him. Evrmonde makes some cruel remarks about how members of the peasant class are always in the way. He throws a coin from the carriage to Gasper as recompense for his son's death. Monsieur Defarge tells Gasper to have faith and that his son is better dead, having died a quick death.

""It was the best of times. It was the worse of times. It was the age of wisdom. It was the age of foolishness. It was the epoch of belief. It was the epoch of incredulity. It was the season of light. It was the season of darkness. It was the spring of hope. It was the winter of despair."" (During this time, the film shifts from clips of aristocracy to clips of peasantry.)

Jarvis Lorry enters an establishment to find Lucie Manette and Miss Pross. Jarvis Lorry tells Lucie that her father has been found alive. Lucie faints.

A red wine cask falls off a carriage bed and exploded, pouring red wine all over the cobblestone street. People lick up the wine from the street. Gasper writes, ""BLOOD"" on the wall of the wine shop. Monsieur Defarge scolds Gasper for his behavior (although the film does not say whether the word was immediately erased or not.)

Back inside his wine shop, Monsieur Defarge meets with Jarvis Lorry, Lucie, and Miss Pross. Collectively, they go upstairs to see Dr. Manette. They found Dr. Manette working on shoes. When Monsieur Defarge ask Dr. Manette his name, he says, ""105 North Tower."" While Dr. Manette does not recognize Jarvis Lorry, he does seem to recognize Lucie's blond hair. He compares the hair with a sample he had kept for many years. They matched.

When leaving the wine shop, Dr. Manette asks for his tools. Monsieur Defarge goes back into the shop to retrieve them. While Monsieur Defarge retrieves the tools, Madame Defarge keeps Dr. Manette's journal to read.

Marquis Evrmonde shoots pigeons as they are thrown up into the air. At this time, Charles Evrmonde visits his uncle to tell him he is leaving France forever. The Marquis emphasizes his cruel behavior by saying regarding the peasants that ""fear and starving keep the scum obedient."" The Marquis warns Charles that England is not fond of spies.

Gabelle begs Charles Evrmonde's permission to accompany him to England. Charles says he cannot afford a servant. However, Charles promises Gabelle that he will never allow any harm to come to him.

While taking her father from the carriage to the ship, Lucie requires help. Charles (also traveling abroad the same ship) offers to help. When Jarvis Lorry asks Charles' name, Charles Evrmonde replies, ""Charles Darnay.""

Before leaving France, Darnay relinquishes all titles and property in France. The Marquis' spy, John Barsad, watches from a distance.

(9 months later)

Jerry Cruncher and Jarvis Lorry leave Tellson Bank to attend Charles' trial for treason. Jerry mentions that the jury always finds the accused guilty.

At trial, Charles is accused of spying for the Americans and George Washington. When Dr. Manette is asked whether he can identify Darnay, he says no. Next, Lucie is brought to testify. She identifies Darnay as their fellow traveler from France to England, as well as admits that papers passed between Darnay and some other men.

The next witness is John Barsad. He tells lies about Charles Darnay, saying that he saw Darnay giving secret military papers to spies. Barsad says other false things about Charles. During his testimony, Sydney Carton receives from Jerry Cruncher the spy's real name. Certain that Barsad does not want his real name revealed, Carton shows himself besides Darnay: the two appear almost identical. Then, Mr. Stryver (Charles' lawyer) asks Barsad - using the Barsad's real name  - if he is positive the prisoner is the same men he saw pass the confidential papers. Barsad replies that he cannot be certain that Darnay was that man.

After deliberating, the jury found Charles Darnay ""innocent of all charges.""

After being found innocent, Jarvis Lorry congratulates Charles Darnay. Before the verdict, Jarvis Lorry had refused to speak with Darnay.

Darnay and Sydney go to the bar to drink. Carton says he thinks there is little good in the world for him, except for wine. The pair toasts to Miss Lucie Manette. Carton says that for a woman like Lucie, he would give up his life of dissipation. Carton also tells Darnay, ""I care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me.""

Charles Darnay tells Dr. Manette that he may soon receive a post at a university teaching French.

Lucie and Charles go on an open carriage ride in the country with Miss Pross. They talk until Miss Pross begins to resent their intimacy.

A drunken Marquis Evrmonde returns home in his carriage. While the gate to the Evrmonde estate is being opened, Gasper sneaks underneath the Marquis' carriage. While the carriage hands help the Marquis into his home, Gasper removes himself from underneath the carriage and begins climbing toward the Marquis' bedchamber. Gasper enters the Marquis' room as the Marquis sleeps. He stabs the Marquis twice with a long, thin knife.

Lucie answers the door to see Sydney Carton. Sydney asks Lucie to accompany him to a social event. Lucie apologizes saying that she promised to accompany her father to a medical conference on the date in question. Darnay leaves, and even refuses the glass of wine Lucie offered him.

Charles asks for Dr. Manette's consent to marry Lucie and receives it. Charles tries to tell Dr. Manette about his past. The doctor says that if Lucie should consent, he will hear about Charles' past on his wedding day.

Stryver tells Sydney that Sydney ought to end his dissipated life and get married. Sydney points out that Stryver is not married. Mr. Stryver says he hopes soon to be married to Lucie Manette. Sydney laughs hysterically at Stryver's words.

At a party held by Dr. Manette, Sydney hears Dr. Manette tell everyone that Lucie is engaged to Charles Darnay. On their way home, Stryver expresses his disbelief to Sydney that Lucie would have agreed to marry Charles Darnay. On further thought, Stryver reasons that he must not have made his attentions toward Lucie clear enough. Stryver also reasons that Lucie will soon repent to marrying Charles when she is living a life of poverty with Charles.

Marquis Evrmonde's murderer, Gasper, is hung. A woman (one of Madame Defarge's friends) asks Madame Defarge whom Gasper murdered. After Madame Defarge responds, the woman says, ""Excellent choice."" As the stool is pushed from under Gasper, a few members of the crowd (which includes children) remove their hats.

The spy, John Barsad, enters the Defarge's wine shop. He attempts to get Madame Defarge to speak sympathetic words about Gasper. Madame Defarge does not fall for the trap. During their conversation, Madame Defarge's knitting comes up. However, Madame Defarge does not tell Barsad the true purpose of her knitting.

When Monsieur Defarge joins the conversation, Barsad tells him that Lucie Manette is about to be married ""to the nephew of the Marquis Saint Evrmonde."" Barsad also tells Madame Defarge that this nephew's name is Charles Darnay. After Barsad leaves the wine shop, one of Monsieur Defarge's own spies tells him that the man the Defarges were just talking with was John Barsad, a new royal spy sent to asses the mood of the district. Madame Defarge records the names, ""Barsad,"" and ""Charles Darnay"" into her shroud.

Charles, with Lucie beside him, tells Dr. Manette everything about Charles' past. When Charles reveals his real name, Dr. Manette appears shocked. (However, nobody except the film viewer notices.)

Charles and Lucie are married in the church with their friends and acquaintances watching.

While Charles and Lucie are on their honeymoon, Dr. Manette regresses back to shoemaking. Miss Pross informs Jarvis Lorry of Dr. Manette's regression, hoping that Jarvis Lorry can discover a way to help Dr. Manette recover.

While in bed on their honeymoon, Lucie and Charles talk about Sydney. Charles tells Lucie that he thinks Sydney was in love with her. Charles emphasizes that if Lucie had rejected him, he might have become like Sydney.

Dr. Manette has recovered. Jarvis Lorry visits him and tells the doctor of a story regarding a man in the exact same condition as Dr. Manette had been. By the end of Lorry's narrative, Dr. Manette realizes that Jarvis Lorry was talking of him. Dr. Manette asks if Lucie has been told of his affliction. Jarvis Lorry responds that she has not been told and need not be told.

Jarvis Lorry and Miss Pross destroy Dr. Manette's shoemaking equipment (after receiving Dr. Manette's consent).

(London: 5 years later)

Mr. Lorry, Dr. Manette, and Charles Darnay talk about the unstable political situation in France. Miss Pross comes up to them at the table and says that Charles' five-year-old daughter has run away with a biscuit. Sidney Carton arrives back with the child and acts as her defense attorney in a mock trial.

Sydney Carton and Lucie Darnay talk. Sydney says he appreciates the visits to the Darnay family. Sydney tells Lucie that he ""would embrace any sacrifice in the world for you. Indeed, I would gladly give my life.""

(14 July 1789)

Defarge's lead the French peasant patriots in an attack against the Bastille. While some patriots die, the Bastille is taken. Madame Defarge kills the governor. The Defarges take no prisoners.

~~ Scenes of the aristocracy being taken from their royal lives by an angry mob ~~

Charles meets with Jarvis Lorry. Lorry says he must go to his bank in France to retrieve important bank documents before the mob destroys them. Jarvis Lorry tells Charles he has a letter for him. The letter is from Gabelle, Charles' former servant, who has been arrested for serving under the Evrmonde family. Charles resolves to go to France and try to save Gabelle.

Charles lies to Lucie and says he must go away because of one of his classes. Instead, Charles leaves for France. However, Charles does leave Lucie a letter telling of his real business.

On the way to Paris, Charles Darnay's carriage is stopped. Charles is told that France has passed a new law condemning to death any aristocrat who returned to France. Once in the city, Charles is sentenced to La Force, after being told that aristocrats have no rights under the republic.

Monsieur Defarge, accompanied by other soldiers, take Charles Darnay to prison. Monsieur Defarge tells Charles that Charles is a fool for returning to Paris to save his servant. Monsieur Defarge refuses to help Charles in any way.

Charles Darnay is locked into a cell at La Force. The cell contains many rats.

Jarvis Lorry watches the chaos in the street from his room. Jerry Cruncher enters the room and tells Jarvis Lorry that Charles was arrested and is being held under the name Evrmonde. Jarvis Lorry writes to Dr. Manette telling the doctor that Charles was taken by the revolutionaries.

Dr. Manette resolves to go to France. Lucy begs to accompany him.

Sydney Carton asks personnel at Jarvis Lorry's bank in England where Jarvis Lorry is. Sydney Carton is told that Jarvis Lorry left for Paris three weeks prior.

Dr. Manette and Lucy arrive at Lorry's bank in France. Dr. Manette promises Jarvis Lorry and Lucie that he will do everything in his power to free Charles.

Dr. Manette speaks to the revolutionary masses. He tells them his story. The people take Dr. Manette to La Force. They allow him to see Charles.

Monsieur and Madame Defarge visit Jarvis Lorry. They deliver Jarvis Lorry a message from Dr. Manette. They deliver Lucie a message from Charles.

Lucie begs Madame Defarge to help her free Charles. Madame Defarge refuses saying, ""Do you think the troubles of one wife means anything to us now?""

The president of France refuses to allow Charles to go free. Dr. Manette and Jarvis Lorry converse confidentially about how the tribunals are forming everywhere, and people are making jokes about the guillotine.

Sydney Carton arrives in France, appearing half-drunk.

Lucie Manette and her daughter wave to Charles from his prison cell. They watch as people are taken to the guillotine by the angry mob. Madame Defarge tells Lucie that Charles' trial will be tomorrow.

Charles testifies in front of the bloodthirsty tribunal that he had (1) relinquished his title, (2) relinquished his land, and (3) worked and lived in England through his own industry. He tells the tribunal that he returned to France in the hope of helping a servant (Gabelle) who had been arrested. Now that the servant had been guillotined, Charles simply wanted the ability to return to England with his family.

Dr. Manette testified that Charles was devoted to him and had not, while in England, ever spoken in front of the aristocracy. The jury unanimously acquitted Charles.

Madame Defarge, in attendance at the trial, pulls out Dr. Manette's journal. Speaking with a woman beside her, Madame Defarge confides that she had been patient, but that Charles Evrmonde will still receive justice (i.e. death by guillotine).

Soldiers arrest Charles Darnay again. Dr. Manette desires to know who denounced Charles this time. The soldiers say it was Monsieur and Madame Defarge and ""one other.""

Sydney Carton and Jarvis Lorry have a conversation. Jarvis Lorry says that Dr. Manette has done everything he could to help Charles. Jarvis Lorry says that he doubts even God could save Charles now. Sydney replies, ""In that case, maybe the devil can accomplish it.""

Sydney views Lucie Darnay and her daughter from a distance.

Sydney discovers that John Barsad works in the prison at La Force. Sydney blackmails Barsad by telling Barsad to accompany him to Lorry's bank. There, Sydney demands that Barsad allow him to have access to Charles Darnay once, or Sydney will renounce Barsad as an aristocratic spy. Barsad responds by saying there is no way of getting Charles out of La Force but agrees to allow Sydney to see Charles once if Charles' next trial goes badly.

After Barsad leaves, Sydney dumps his glass of sherry into the fire.

Sydney goes to the apothecary and purchases some drugs, which the apothecary warns not to mix together.

Guillotine blade is sharpened.

During Charles' second trial, Madame Defarge reads a portion of Dr. Manette's journal. She explains to the tribunal that Dr. Manette was thrown into prison for reporting the death of a woman who had been abused (raped and beaten) by Marquis Philippe Saint Evrmonde. In his diary, Dr. Manette denounced the Evrmonde family to the last of their race. The jury returns a unanimous guilty verdict.

Barsad allows Lucie and Dr. Manette to say goodbye to Charles. After Charles is taken back to La Force, Lucie faints. Sydney takes Lucie home. Sydney kisses Lucie, who is still unconscious. Sydney whispers to Lucie, ""Soon.""

Back at the wine shop, Madame Defarge makes it clear that Darnay's five year-old daughter and wife (Lucie) must also die. Monsieur Defarge pleads against it, but Madame Defarge says that Marquis Saint Evrmondre murdered her sister, and that all Evrmondes must be killed.

Sydney Carton gives Jarvis Lorry plans for their leaving Paris, including his own papers. Sydney claims all the Evrmondes and Lucie are in danger of the guillotine. Jarvis Lorry promises to have everything in order for the next day's departure from Paris.

Barsad takes Sydney to Charles. They change coats with one another. Then, as Charles writes, Sydney uses the medication received from the apothecary to make Charles unconscious. Barsad takes the unconscious Charles from prison - leaving Sydney in Charles' place.

Dr. Manette, Lucie, Lucie's daughter, Jarvis Lorry, and an unconscious Charles leave Paris. Miss Pross and Jerry Cruncher stay behind to take a later carriage. The first carriage leaves Paris without incident. The passport checkers were satisfied that Charles Darnay was an ill Sydney Carton.

Madame Defarge says that Lucie Darnay is an Evrmonde and must also die. Madame Defarge says that she will go to Lucie, that Lucie will plead with her for Charles' life, and that she will then report Lucie to the tribunal as an enemy of the republic. (Madame Defarge does not confide her plans to Monsieur Defarge for fear that her husband is soft toward Dr. Manette's interests.)

While being taken from La Force to the place of execution, Sydney Carton and an innocent seamstress condemned to die talk and hold hands. As Sydney and the seamstress ride, mobs throw items at them, while shouting.

After arriving at the place of execution, French aristocrat after French aristocrat is guillotined.

Lucie reads Sydney's letter as the carriage progresses toward safety.

The seamstress is guillotined. Madame Defarge's friend asks if anyone has seen Madame Defarge. The friend finds Madame Defarge's absence very odd, since Madame Defarge has never been late for an execution. (Why would Madame Defarge miss the execution of a man she hated: Charles Evrmonde?)

Sydney Carton's last words are, ""It is a far, far better thing that I do then I have ever done. It is a far, far better rest that I go to then I have ever known.""

Final scene shows the guillotine's blade falling on Sydney Carton.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
I thought the adaptation was worth nine dollars and my time to view. This adaptation might also be interesting to show students in school who have read Dickens' ""A Tale of Two Cities.""

However, I do believe the film could have been done better. Too much plot was elimiated to make this adaptation truly memorable.

I would recommend the 1989 Masterpiece Theatre production over this one although the price is much higher (See my Masterpiece review for specifics.)",1249084800,2,18638,4.96113074204947
71630,2,0784001308,"The movie is OK, I suppose, if you read the book and want to now watch some images to go along with that book.  And that is the crux of my criticism; given the dated production, one can only watch this movie and not partake in it.

More specifically, compared to today's productions of Austen, Dickens, etc. from the BBC and elsewhere, this production is rather bland.

The lines are delivered as if they were being read, passion is reserved to the level that one wonders if it exists that all.  There is no heated exchange, no believable human interaction, the scenes are devoid of the dirt and chaos of reality.

In total, compared to today's productions, there is no ""suspension of disbelief"".

The best I can say about this production is perhaps it would have gotten four stars back in 1980 when he was released.

For now, I'll keep it on a shelf while I live the most recent realistic renditions of Austin, Dickens, and the other classics.

71631,5,0784001308,"The person who wrote that ""The lead role was poorly acted"" just doesn't know a good act when they see it. I consider this one of, if not the finest performance by Sarandon, a talented actor. He played a double role, but really seemed to be two different people. It's been years since I saw it, but I never forgot how much I enjoyed it and thought Sarandon should have won an award. I saw the 1935 version on tv just last week, and it made me want to search for this version. I'm buying it today.

I took one star because the movie did not show much of the characters' passion!

Interest never lags as this rich drama unfolds, set against the sweeping backdrop of the French Revolution.  Sarandon convincingly carries off his double role as both the noble Darnay and the dissipated Carton and Billie Whitelaw gives a bravura performance as the ferocious revolutionary leader Madame DeFarge, poisoned by her hatred of aristocrats. There isn't a bad performance anywhere, although Alice Krige is perhaps a bit *too* pale and wan, even for a sweet-natured ""English rose"" character.  Kenneth Moore does stalwart service in a supporting role, Flora Robson is indomitable, and David Suchet makes a convincingly oily spy and snitch.  Peter Cushing produces genuine pathos as Dr. Manet and the final sequence in the tumbril, where Carton redeems a life misspent, is quietly poignant.  There's even some humor amid the blood and thunder and treachery.  History teachers would find much in here to use in the classroom.
