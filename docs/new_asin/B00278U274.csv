Of the three movies featured, STIGMA (1972) is the only one that doesn't appear to have been cut. It's also the only one of the three that's really worth watching. Directed by David E. Durston (""I Drink Your Blood""), the movie centers on a small seaside town's doctor (a young, pre-""Miami Vice"" Phillip Michael Thomas) trying to stamp out a killer venereal disease while simultaneously battling a racist sheriff (Peter Clune). A mixture of horror, sexploitation and hicksploitation, two-thirds of ""Stigma"" is actually pretty entertaining drive-in trash before clumsily becoming a PSA about V.D. in its final act. It's not a polished movie and Durston's script is pretty uneven, the tone jumping from comedy to horror to medical mystery, but there was at least some effort to make ""Stigma"" more than just a cheap exploitation movie even if, ultimately, that's what it is.

As the 1970s wound down so did the late Jim Kelly's acting career. By the end of the decade he was reduced to making movies for schlockteur Al Adamson. Though THE TATTOO CONNECTION (a.k.a. ""Black Belt Jones 2,"" 1978) was directed by Tso Nam Lee, its production values are only a notch above those of an Adamson movie. The plot is fairly pat, Kelly playing an ex-CIA agent sent to Hong Kong to retrieve some stolen diamonds, but the kung fu sequences provide a modicum of thrills. However, whenever Kelly isn't kicking a-- ""Tattoo"" becomes a bit of a slog. Kelly was never much of an actor, but he's especially terrible here. Not helping is the awful dubbing. The print used for this DVD is pretty ragged, but I could forgive that. I'm less forgiving about the movie appearing to have been trimmed. Other DVDs of this movie list a running time of 90 minutes; on this disk it's barely 86. Other online reviews also refer to a sex scene that's not seen here.

At least ""The Tattoo Connection"" wasn't totally neutered, retaining most of its T&A. The same can't be said for Fred Williamson's MR. MEAN (1977). The running time on a VHS copy of this movie, as well as the movie's entry on IMDb, notes that ""Mr. Mean"" is 98 minutes long. The copy on here is only 78 minutes. Though rated R, there is no nudity, no sex scenes, no graphic violence and the language is surprisingly tame, leading me to suspect the print used here was edited for broadcast TV. Not that ""Mr. Mean""'s  quality would improve were it uncut. Williamson's directorial debut is pretty shoddy, with bad acting (Lou Castel, looking and acting like he is suffering a nasty hangover, is particularly awful), sloppy storytelling, poorly staged action sequences, and more than a few continuity errors. Even Williamson's innate coolness can't save it. It would have been better to have left all the ""good parts"" in and instead whittle down that superfluous scene in which Williamson chases a cab through Rome.

""Super Urban Action"" was made on the cheap (hence the low price), so I wasn't surprised these movies didn't look any better than they did. I did, however, hope I was getting the movies uncut. If you're interested in any of these movies, better to spend more on the individual titles than get chopped-up versions in this cut-rate triple feature.",1375228800,,3429,4.795262267343485
