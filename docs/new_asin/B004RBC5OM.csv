4460312,4,B004RBC5OM,"love the old movies of science fiction, been looking for this for some time. only wish that it had CC on it",1359158400,,107,3.909090909090909
4460313,5,B004RBC5OM,"I think the protagonist's name is ""Apollo."" Maybe its something equally predictable. It's the future, and war has been replaced by giant robots dueling in massive arenas. The two warring factions? The ""Union"" and the ""Confederacy."" Deep stuff. But don't worry: robots in this movie can launch their fists, and they also have known ""weak spots."" So you'll at least get some truly deep drama.",1340064000,,390,5.015384615384615
4460314,4,B004RBC5OM,"It's the future, and shoulder pads are back in style. These movies have everything you fondly remember about bad early 90's sci-fi. Computer displays filmed straight off a CRT? Check. Vehicle occupants shaking and lurching out of sync with each other? Check. Gratuitous bad one-liners? Check. Horrible blue-screen halos? All. Day. Long. What's not to like?

Out of the two movies included, Robot Wars is easily the more dated, with 90's hair and ""futurist"" fashion all over the place. Crash And Burn holds up surprisingly well, with only a few characters hamming it up for the camera or dated by their hairstyles. Sure the story's derivative, but there's only so many variations on the ""which one of us is the alien/monster/psycho/robot"" genre to begin with, and for a low-budget film, it does just fine.

The conversion itself is wonderfully awful as well, with visible film grain galore. Crash And Burn has a few more transfer flaws than Robot Wars, and during the final battle, it seems as if someone were purposefully messing with the video tape on which this movie had been kept for the last 20 years. Somehow, though, even that made me smile. I half-expected a ""technical difficulties"" card to pop up, accompanied by some bad lounge music. This is a must-have addition to any guilty pleasure movie collection.",1329350400,7,1315,4.9457013574660635
4460315,4,B004RBC5OM,"I had some of the other giant mechanical robot movies. Robot Wars appeared to be out of print for a while

 well they are not. They are 4.3 Standard prints.

4460317,3,B004RBC5OM,"Judge Mac McEntire, DVD Verdict -- ""The cheesy B-movie is an interesting flavor of movie. It might not be quality in a classical cinema sense, but when you're watching a ""good"" bad movie, you know it. Such is the case with Crash and Burn and Robot Wars. They are clunky, plot-holed, low-budget, and sleazy, but there is that intangible yet all-important fun aspect to them that can't be beat. After the apocalypse, most of the world has been reduced to uninhabitable deserts, and yet everybody's hair looks great. Crash and Burn gets off to a slow start, as we're introduced to this future world and the evil corporation/conspiracy running it. After the lengthy info-dumps are over, our giant-haired hero reaches the TV station, and the robot mayhem finally kicks in. It's true that movie fans have seen it all before--the ""killer robot that looks just like a human"" is a lift from The Terminator and the ""testing the blood to see who's human and who isn't"" scene is straight out of Carpenter's The Thing--but it's played with just enough earnestness that you can't help but go along with the ride. But, hey, it's all about the giant robot action, right? That's what the movie promises, right? Well, I'm telling you right now that if you want giant robot action, then you've got...to wait until the last ten minutes of the movie. Robot Wars ups the effects ante with a lot more stop motion robot fighting, but somehow it just isn't as much fun as the first. For one, the filmmakers are thinking a lot bigger, so instead of a small group of folks in one remote location, we're following a bigger cast as they traverse the nightmarish future landscape, visiting numerous locales. I can't fault the creators for wanting to go epic, but they bit off more than they can chew. We don't get to know the characters as well as we do in Crash and Burn. Also the comedy is bigger and broader; there's a joke every couple of minutes in the flick, and not once did I laugh. The actual robot fighting is decent, with the big showdown being between a giant scorpion-shaped 'bot and the heroic MEGA-1. It's up to you if you want to sit through a lot of tedium before you get to that point. The video and audio could be better. The full frame image is soft throughout, and the sound is middle-of-the-road, not really as immersive or booming as you'd expect giant robot fighting to be. Not only are there no extras, but the disc is so bare bones you don't even get things like chapter titles.""",1310515200,3,2475,4.576576576576577

4460329,4,B004RBC5OM,"DVD seem to play OK.  One issue is with Crash and Burn, DVD messed up in places near ending, not sure if this is DVD issue or original recording.  I watched movie on a VHS long time ago and remember it messing up in same place as DVD so not sure about problem.  DVD problem was not bad enough to send back for another copy.",1455494400,,323,3.9384615384615387

4460331,1,B004RBC5OM,"Really disappointed with this one.  A ""PG"" movie packaged with an ""R+++"" rated movie.
ROBOT WARS was fun to see, again (after many years ago), however, ""Crash and Burn"" has only 5 minutes of ""robot"" action toward the very end, no noticable plot, way too much ""sex"" (and flesh) for the kids (yup, what would you expect being combined with a PG movie?????).  I would like to return it and just get the ""Robot Wars"" by itself.",1436572800,,423,4.48051948051948

4460340,4,B004RBC5OM,before 'pacific rim' and 'atlantic rim' we had these films about giant robots. in crash and burn the robot only has a cameo role as the film is more about fighting an evil corporation that has developed 'synthoids' to infiltrate the population,1403049600,,243,4.809523809523809
4460341,1,B004RBC5OM,"The movies recommended, just watch terminator or. Crash and burn was another version of terminator but without time travel. The picture of the robot on front was only seen for 2 full minutes of the whole movie... The cover is ""bate"" to make it look interesting, action packed, futuristic and vintage.  Not worth it... Not a sequel to Robot Jocks

Robot wars, at least it has scenes with the robot through out the movie. Not worth it. However not ad bad as crash and burn.",1402099200,,471,4.529411764705882

The android in Crash and Burn was diabolically evil reminiscent of the android in Alien. Robot Wars was too short and the characters were unbelievably shallow but again, some great robot fights.
