5111219,1,B007V2LN4M,"I wonder, how long it will be, before someone does an actual porn/undead/rape film where the action is REAL. They would go to jail, but the film would be legend. This is in no way intending to give, or inspire, anyone to actually make said film. The way the sickness and violence is attaining popularity in films of the day simply make me wonder, not why, but when...",1349136000,,367,4.411764705882353
5111220,5,B007V2LN4M,"Saw Bled White when it debuted in the Chicago area near where it was filmed.  It's got some real interesting twists, good concepts, well executed.  Later, I read that it won some awards in Hollywood for it's genre. Not surprised.  I've been saying for a couple years that I wanted to get this movie for my home collection. Now, finally, it's available and I'm pre-ordering.  Won't surprise me if it develops a cult following.  It's that good.",1342828800,7,442,4.688311688311688
5111221,2,B007V2LN4M,"We purchased this collection for the movie Bled White, which was partially filmed in my small town. The movie was OK for a low-budget independent film, but if you aren't watching to recognize local landmarks, you might not enjoy it to the degree we did. (We saw them filming some scenes and the zombie makeup was really good in person--looked very convincing). Bled White was the best of the movies on the collection. The others don't even rate a B-movie distinction. The gore doesn't make up for bad dialog and worse acting. But you weren't expecting George Romero quality in a collection with titles such as ""Porn Star Zombies and ""Santa Clause vs. the Zombies,"" were you?",1369612800,,674,4.769230769230769

5111224,2,B007V2LN4M,"First let me say I am not a Zombiephile or a film critic.
Some were horrible! Bad acting bad lighting, makeup, camara angles and more. Others I never got too far into because I was so bored and they dragged.
One movie makes what I paid worth it. ""Bled White"". It had a nice new look at zombies that made you think. It really made you care for some of the characters. Even found myslef talking to the screen.",1357689600,,407,4.1645569620253164

5111228,3,B007V2LN4M,"Definitely a good value for 8 movies. Worth it if you are looking for new zombie movies, and are not expecting too much.",1350691200,6,120,4.260869565217392
5111229,4,B007V2LN4M,"More than satisfied with this collection.  I wanted to kick back with a beer and watch some Zombies.  I hoped to be entertained by some never before seen scenes, some unknown names, some creativity by new directors and their casts.  That's what I got.  Some are better than others.  One reviewer said real zombies can't run.  Who says so?  Ha! If I wrote a Zombie movie, my zombies might climb trees if the plot needed them to do that.  Zombie movies aren't for the closed-minded.

If you're  in the mood for zombies, and you don't have arbitrary zombie rules in your head, than buy this set of eight.  It's an Extreme Value.  LOL.",1349481600,10,631,4.486725663716814
5111230,1,B007V2LN4M,"Where should I begin.  These films, (& I use the term loosely) are atrocious & that's not because all of the actors are unknown.  This is not what I base my opinion on at all. Honestly, I've only watched one of the 8 but I think that speaks loudly in reference to the other 7.  I have started watching another with hopes of redemption for the rest of the collection but it's just more of the same.  They don't even look like the traditional zombie & they definitely don't move like one.  These zombies run extremely fast.  This can't be compared to any of today's zombie flicks.  The Walking Dead it's not.  I should've known something was up when the 1 reviewer only commented on 1 of the movies.  He said he wouldn't be suprised if it became a cult classic.  I don't see that ever happening.  Another big clue should've been the fact that one of the movies has porn in the title & Santa Clause in another. Go figure!!!  So I tried to watch the remaining films in this set but I couldn't get past the first 15-30 mins. I'm sticking by my original review.  I have yet to see a real zombie.  Please, go & buy a book or something else.  Anything!",1349395200,,1144,4.255813953488372

8522074,2,B007V2LN4M,"I puyt i don't like it because the dvds don't work, see there are two discs and each disk they say plays 4 films. NO THEY DONT! i tried and tried and the ones i really wanted to see are the ones that don't play, so what am i left with ..well llot of filler, which i could of been ok with but i didn't get to see the films i ordered. So why not return it, well you see i order allot and i have a job so when a package drives i open it and sometimes weeks go by before i can get around to watching the dads i order. So the packaging is far from  gone so i have no way of sending it back or asking for a disk that works. I will say that the films i did see were a bit of a mixed bag on the campy side i did enoy the christmas zombie film but there were two other i didn't like and 3 i couldn't watch, So i give a two stars for the christmas x]zombie tim that was fun but the rest who knows, don't say its an 8 film if you can only get l\4 to work.",1412380800,,944,3.5384615384615383

The movies I can watch but where did they copy them from???
I think I still have some VHS takes that will play like these.
So, be warned, you will NOT be getting DVD quality here.
Just accept it and sit back and watch.

8522077,1,B007V2LN4M,"I have purchased some pretty bad movies in my lifetime but this collection tops them all (one exception may be Flesh Eating Mothers, but that is another story).
The scripts were horrible, the acting was bad, the audio was terrible and the color looked like the film had spent several months in the bright sunlight. Remember - this collection had a movie called Porn Star Zombies in it. I only paid about six dollars for the movie, including shipping & handling, and I feel that I was ripped off!",1379548800,2,495,4.573033707865169
8522078,1,B007V2LN4M,Avoid this tripe at all costs.  The first disc had skips and digital issues making it painful to use.  The movies were so bad you'll fast forward to get to whatever you really want from each... and still be disappointed.  The second disc was badly scratched and unreadable by my player.  Looked used and was not loose in the case.,1376870400,2,330,4.45
8522079,3,B007V2LN4M,"It was cool to see all the different directions these movies went with the zombies. Some ideas were okay... most were plain and predictable and only one stood out for me. When I buy low budget movies like these I personally look for humor. Why??? Because that's about all you can take away from this low budget genre and is the only thing that leaves me any memorable moments.

So.... I sit down and crack open a beer and begin to watch and gradually find myself more entertained with peeling the label off my bottles of beer than the majority of the movies UNTIL I get to Porn Star Zombies. I LAUGHED MY ASS OFF!!! Finally, my purchase wasn't a complete waste. This flick probably had to be one of the lowest budget films in the collection and shined in the script category above all the rest. It reminded me of the first time I saw ""Clerks"" only with zombies. The set is minimal... the zombies are really minimal (kinda like Night of the Living Dead) and the majority of the cast is amateur, but you can tell that they must have all had a blast making this film. It's shot in black & white, there's decent T&A, some dude's shlong flapping around, some awesome kill scenes with a decent amount of gore and lots of profanity with sick humor dialog. LOVED IT!

My advice if you consider purchasing this collection is to not expect a lot for your money. Lower your expectations and for the love of god have some beers to wash 'em down with. You're bound to find at least one movie with potential that you may watch more than once. The other great thing about Porn Star Zombies is it's short enough to re-watch twice in one night (which is what I did).",1370476800,,1649,4.368078175895765
