310694,5,6300986608,"We first watched this video 5 years ago, and I'm sure I've never laughed so hard in my life.  Bill Cosby's observations of the aging process are so universal and so hilarious that we can all relate;  we can all see something of ourselves in this video. I highly recommend it to anyone over the age of 30 especially.",996710400,16,315,4.322033898305085
310892,5,6300986608,"I watched this on youtube with my husband and my kids and we all laughed our butts off! He makes growing old so much fun! My kids favorite part was when he was talking about his time in the navy and the drill sargent kept yelling at him ""I'm not your mother!"".

310895,5,6300986608,"I watched this video in the 1990's with a friend, and we never laughed so hard in our lives!  The ""Cos"" outdid himself with ""49"", and I have been looking for it for years.  He talks about mid-life, and it is so true that it's hilarious!!!",1284595200,2,238,4.1521739130434785
310896,5,6300986608,"Cosby is the master humorist. Taking life and showcasing it in all its foolishness, flavored with his dry wit and observations, his shows are a continuous belly laugh.

310899,5,6300986608,"Bill Cosby:49. Classic Stand-Up Video. I wish this was on DVD,but we shall see if that ever happens.  My favorite parts of this tape is Cosby reflecting on getting a new pair of glasses and ""How did they know he was THE Bill Cosby"". Buy this tape NOW!!!",1175126400,,253,4.270833333333333
310900,5,6300986608,"I thought I would die laughing when I first watched ""Bill Cosby - 49"" about a dozen years ago! My husband and I enjoyed this so much that we ended up inviting friends to laugh with us at Cosby's antics during our 49th birthdays. Cosby is at his best as he relates his experiences with the indignities of growing older.  Suddenly, age related struggles like memory glitches, and failing eyesight, became incredibly funny!  It was particularly comforting to know that I am not alone in the aging process.  Being a ""Boomer,"" I'm surrounded by peers who are trying to deny that they are getting older.  As Cosby says, ""It's a fact.""  So, lets have some fun with it!  Let's enjoy the humor in it! My only regret about this video is that, when I wanted a DVD copy for a friend's 49th birthday, I found that only used VHS tapes were available.  And, those are copy protected. Come on!  Somebody should put this on a DVD.  I'm sure they'd make a mint!  Boomer stuff usually does. Personally, I have many other friends who will soon turn 49 and neeeeeed their own copy of this hilarious video! It's great medicine for what ""ages"" you.",1170979200,3,1125,4.497536945812808

7809566,5,6300986608,I have been a fan since I was a kid and yet had not heard these routines. Cosby is in top form.  A fantastic addition to my collection.,1397520000,,135,3.8214285714285716
7809567,5,6300986608,"Oh, man!  I had seen this for the first time, many years ago, when I was in my late twenties/early thirties, and thought it was funny, then!  But, after I had watched it again (now that I'm 50), it's a whole lot more hilarious, because now I know exactly what he's talking about!  Ironically, my favorite part of the routine was his bit about ""boot camp"".  My older brother is an army veteran, and even though Bill is describing the Navy, it sounds the same as what my brother used to talk about!  Some things don't change, haha!  Would recommend  ""Bill Cosy-49"" to ALL ages, but especially those 40 and over!",1388016000,,609,4.4324324324324325
7809568,2,6300986608,"I received the VHS tape in a timely fashion, however it is almost unwatchable.  It is decaying tape and the audio cuts in and out.  The video does as well.  In short, it's just too old and worn of a tape to really even watch.  Would have been nice if someone had previewed the beast before selling it.",1379116800,,301,4.137931034482759
7809569,5,6300986608,"Billy Cosby being, well...Bill Cosby! In this performance, he mainly talks about a lot of the things that happen as you get older (ex. being more forgetful, eating way too much, marriage, etc.). Funny as usual and a great watch. I just wish it had been released on DVD at some point. Maybe some day?",1377043200,,299,4.454545454545454
