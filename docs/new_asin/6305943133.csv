1087557,4,6305943133,"Well if like Anaconda you will probably like this one too. IT starts out with a young boy and his family living on a island. The kid incurs the  wrath of one of the Komodo's and his parentts are devoured as a result.  Then the movie jumps forward to the future and the boy comes back to the  island at the advice of his therepist and the slaughtering begins anew. The  special effects were great, the plot cheasy, in other words a great Friday  night movie with your friends.",966211200,,475,4.292134831460674
1087558,3,6305943133,"""Komodo"" is an enjoyably silly, occasionally creepy thriller.  The premise of a bunch of Komodo dragons (the world's largest lizards, and  very nasty beasties in real life) living on an island off South Carolina is  preposterous, and the script and acting never rise above the standard for  this kind of thing, but the lizards are impressive and worth checking out  for fans of movie monsters.  It's basically an old-fashioned ""giant  animal"" b-movie (a la ""Them"" or ""Black Scorpion"")  with slightly more believable monsters, some nice effects work and a splash  of gore here and there.  Not a great movie by any means, but then it  doesn't try to be.  Have a few beers, chuckle along with the stiff  dialogue, enjoy a scare or two, and cheer on the dragons! (For anyone  interested in a fascinating take on the real Komodo dragons that manages to  be both scary and quite funny, I heartily recommend the book ""Last  Chance to See"" by Douglas Adams.)",966038400,14,950,4.771604938271605
1087559,2,6305943133,"I watched the DVD free demo ""screener"" of this movie and I still wanted my money back!  I work for a major video store chain and get to  watch almost all new movies before they get released- and most are pretty  good.  When I recieved my demo copy of ""Komodo"" I got all  excited.  The cover artwork is great- there is a big red reptile eye  peeking out at you- with referrences to Jurassic Park and Anaconda- but  that's about it!  This story takes place on ""an island off  Florida"".  In the opening of the movie we see a shot of an island off  Florida with nice rolling hills and cliffs- and such.  Well, I've lived in  Florida for over 15 years now and I haven't seen a hill or a cliff yet-  Florida is FLAT!  But still- we see hills and mountains in some shots.  The  acting is good dough- the little boy in the movie does a great job and so  does most of the cast.  The special effects were not so great- the viewer  could tell the lizards were ""filmed in"".  The guy that did the  special effects for Jurassic Park directed this movie- maybe he should of  spent more time on the ""special effects"" for this movie.  I still  recomend this movie- it's worth seeing it at least once- we can hardly keep  it on the shelves at my store- so maybe it's just me who didn't like it?  I  don't know- just watch the movie and see if you like it. lol",966038400,2,1341,4.108949416342412
1087560,1,6305943133,"I read the reviews and I hoped for a good monster flick. What I saw was mishmash of poor editing, dialog, writing and acting.  The entire film was  one big ""WHY?""  Why were these people on the island and NEVER saw  a coupla dozen 20 foot lizard running around after they had been there 20  years? Why was this kid noosing lizards in the middle of the night? Why did  he ignore his parents yelling?  Why did everybody NOT shoot the lizards  when they were sitting in the middle of the road. Or just run em down.  Why  (and how) did the kid steal a lizards heart and run off with it?  Why would  a oil company who apparently hit water instead of oil even bother covering  up anything and just leave? Why was it a mystery to the scientist what  happened to his wife?  Why would the police suspect him anyway? And finally  why is there the dramatic walking thru the deserted village sequence?  That  was a white knuckler I can tell you. Why would a cop act like he knows  whats going on keep going when people are hurt?  The acting:The kid in  the movie's entire acting porfolio seemed to be staring straight ahead and  not caring.  He kept the same expression on his face when he caugh a  lizard, seeing his parents die screaming, lizard attacking or ""in  shock from what he saw"".  Like anyone could tell the difference. My  friend Alex could show better emotional depth and he's a cocker spaniel.  The rest of the characters were just there for filling.  The shrink was a  fine display of what not to do when you flunk drama class because of  cheerleading.  The Tosseled overprotective never explained whoever. The  easy go lucky island hopping boat captain. The happy go luck Merc (I  suppose that is what he was) and finally the Ruggedly handsome, Good with a  gun, Tough under pressure, Lives by the seat of his pants...Biologist?  Nothing is explained. Who, what or why in anyway reasonable. Everyone is  dumber than a bag of hammers. Going in holes, high grass, middle of an open  field. Almost always because of the dumb kid. (Who turns into jungle boy in  less than 20 minutes for some idiot reason) You can tell who lives or dies  because you can see the relief in the eyes of the Lizard food as they end  thier session in this film. I can imagine the shooting was the worst 4 days  of thier lives. The Lizards. I seen lizards.  Gimme a Raptor if you want my  to applaud good special effects. This film could been done Waaaay better  with a coupla mutations and someone who can actually write. And excuse me  but there is supposed to be a FINAL BATTLE SCENE in this kinda films. It  would at least made this thing come sorta conclusion of win or lose. I say  the real achievers in this film were the salesmen who actually got someone  to front the money to cover this. I hope I never meet them in a dark Used  Car Lot....",965692800,3,2827,4.362934362934363

1087812,5,6305943133,"Anaconda meets Jurassic Park in this horror movie that features the real life lizards called Komodo Dragons. Seriously, this movie can actually happen and yes, there are lizards this big...FOR REAL. They vary little and are usually inbetween a crocodile and an alligator in size but their appearance is more like a monitor lizard. Their saliva is as deadly as snake venom. They are found only on remote islands in the vicinity of Indonesia. However, this film apparently takes place off the Florida coast. A boy turns up in shock and his family is found brutally maimed and murdered in what appears to be an animal attack. Psychological damage results and the boy is given mental treatment. His doctor decides to take him back to the place where the event happened. BAD...MISTAKE. They soon find themselves running not only from large lizards but also from the corrupt corporation that now runs the place! The doctor realizes that not all patients are hallucinating, a lesson she learns all too quickly. This movie is rated PG-13 due to violence and animal attacks. The movie is full of scares and violent action. These lizards are in it to win it!",1455580800,4,1148,4.83248730964467

1087817,5,6305943133,"The Komodo Dragon has fascinated me since I was a child, & continues to fascinate me as a adult!!!  I recently learned that their saliva is no more full of bacteria than the average 5 year old human.  The tendencies for septicemia & infection are more do to the tropical atmosphere & bacteria filled water any open wounds would be susceptible to.  They have recently discovered that they are venomous though, they have poison glands that inject several protein based toxins that cause a myriad of problems ending in shock, paralysis or death!  They also can reproduce Parthanogenticaly!  Females denied the presence of males have hatched fertile egg's on their own!!!  The hatchlings tended to be all male this is believed to be a survival mechanism rarely seen in large reptiles.  I have a nice collection of animal v.s. man movies & was delighted to add this to the collection.  I don't like to give spoilers so I will just say this is a great action adventure with good acting & special effects.  If you enjoy the primal struggle of man against ferocious animals than this is a smart entertaining bit of fun!!!  I have man against Killer Apes, Whales, Sharks, Bears, Lions, Snakes , Crocodiles, Ants & Bees, Boar's & Spiders so how could I pass on one of the animal kingdoms most interesting top predator's!!!  A venomous lizard 10ft long & 300lbs...that's larger than all the big cats except the Lion & Tiger!!!  Most scientist say the Komodo Dragon is so big because of Island Gigantism, why when most animals suffer from Island Dwarfism?  I wonder if in a more comfortable habitat if Megalania  is waiting to make a come back out of the genome of the Komodo Dragon?  If your into these creature feature action survival films Amazon.com has this increasingly harder to find gem priced just right to add  to your collection!!!",1448928000,5,1830,4.743670886075949

This gives information about Komodo, and the special affects are wonderul.  They look like live reptiles.  Komodo are like living Dinosaurs.  They're beautiful majestic creatures.  They've ruled their environment for their species's entire existence.

So:  This shows what would/could happen if a large number of Komodo were dumped in a new environment.  One that's similar to their original habitat.  They'd dominate the island, of course. They'd be at the top of All Food Chains.

Beyond that an oil company poisons the island.  So the only things alive on the island are plants, humans and Komodo.  These fictional Komodo were so dangerous because they were starving.  They'd eat anything slower than themselves at that point.",1419292800,,881,5.282608695652174

1088046,4,6305943133,"Outrageously ridiculous and sublimely entertaining.

Peter Benchley and Steven Spielberg sort of crafted the template for animal as predator horror films with Jaws. Then Joe Dante added the slight twist of corporate greed/genetic enhancement with Piranha. That template has been used and used over and over again to varying degrees of success.

Watching Komodo is a guilty pleasure, because you know what's going to happen just from looking at the DVD box. There are no real surprises, but what is surprising is that it isn't as bad as you might expect it to be.

You've got a couple of decent actors: Jill Hennesey (Law and Order) and Kevin Zegers (Transamerica, Air Bud) leading up the cast. You have a rather interesting, if not outlandish premise for the whole thing, but you've got some decent camera work and not too bad direction. The script is not up to par, but the actors do the best they can with it.

The special effects work well and the Komodos, while not always realistic looking, are less CGI than they are super-imposed (but hey, I'll be darned if I would have worked with a live Komodo - or for that matter - at large monitor lizard).

The gore is prevalent, but I don't remember it being near the slasher movie level.

Creepy, night-time action and just waiting for the creature (s) to jump out at us is half the fun!",1413849600,,1336,4.639830508474576
1088047,4,6305943133,"Some yahoo dumps a few komodo eggs on an island.  The island in question is occupied by an oil company that doesn't mind polluting the local environment.  There's also a vacation home that a small family uses during the summers.  The komodo population increases as the food source dwindles.  It isn't long before a boy and his dog show up looking like meals on wheels.  Unfortunately for this boy (Kevin Zegers), his dog was only the hors d'oeuvre, his parents became the main course.  Fast forward to whenever, to a tug of war between a psychiatrist (Jill Hennessy) and the boy's aunt (Nina Landis) as to who has the better treatment: coddling the boy or taking him back to the scene of the crime to force him to face his demons.  The third option is a mental institution.  I think the third option would have provided a better alternative considering that a trip back to the island causes the deaths of not a few people.  The komodo are still hungry and can't built rafts, having their next meal(s) show up on cue was definitely in their best interest.

I will say the komodo are impressive looking (part CGI, part animatronics).  The plot though, is a bit generic.  It's not helped by inconsistent acting skills and stereotypical characters.  Still, there is enough excitement, and those terrifically misunderstood komodo, to make this an old favorite watched many times.

1088121,4,6305943133,"Komodo is a pretty good creature flick that delivers the goods, providing fear, excitement, and a story holds together well enough, as these things go.

Jill Hennessy is Victoria Juno, a psychiatrist treating a teenage boy traumatized when his parents were killed mysteriously on a small island.  She believes that returning the young man to the scene of the trauma may help with his recovery.  Once back on the island, the komodo strike swiftly, and soon Victoria and a small group of companions are on the run from the deadly creatures.

The story's resolution may be a bit weak, but slick action sequences, cool special effects, and acceptable dialog and acting, make this a pretty entertaining ride.  Though in somewhat unfamiliar territory, Hennessy's performance is solid, rarely missing a step.

Michael Lantieri who has extensive experience doing special effects on numerous A-List blockbusters like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and the Jurassic Park films, makes his directorial debut in this feature shot in the Gold Coast, Australia.  His excellent commentary track is very frank, with lots of interesting and informative insights.  The budgetary limitations and production tradeoffs are discussed extensively.  Even with the economic constraints, Komodo is very nicely done and stands up to repeated viewings.",1154304000,,1328,5.3768115942028984
1088122,5,6305943133,"I love this movie!

Thank you Amazon for having it!!",1143331200,,52,4.2
1088123,3,6305943133,"This movie is full of cliches and full of itself, although the premise is no stupider than ""Jurassic Park"" with an aging hippie in a van dropping smelly eggs in the middle of nowhere. Of course several years later the eggs have hatched and this island with apparently one vacation home and a huge oil refinery on it are covered with these things. The dragons eat Kevin Zegers' parents and dog, and he is dutifully traumatized. Here is my first warning: get ready for about 45 minutes of Zegers staring blankly into space. A good looking psychologist (Jill Hennessy) and a female relative of Zegers (whose relationship to the boy is a bit unclear) take the kid back to the island under some ridiculous theory of mental therapy. Needless to say, the komodos are still there and chase everyone all over the place for a while, and get a couple of snacks along the way.

The oil company, which is evil of course, plots to get rid of the visitors. There are subplots involving a wrongly accused biologist, komodo saliva (the movie has excellent dragon drool effects), and evil Australians. Interestingly, despite the presence of two attractive leading characters, there is no romance in the film.

The plot is fairly implausible, but despite that and other shortcomings (like the extremely loud, annoying, and omnipresent musical score) there are good points about ""Komodo."" By far the best thing going for the movie are very good computer generated images of the dragons themselves. The dragons are actually a combination of hand puppets, robots, life size puppets, and computer generated images. A couple of the puppet shots look a bit hokey, but in general the lizards look excellent. My favorite computer generated lizard shot was the komodo trying to get into the back of the moving Volvo station wagon. Fans of creature films will like this movie for the effects if for nothing else. The acting isn't Oscar caliber, but it is consistent and generally well done (except the hyper over-the-top evil Australian oil executive) with no major complaints. I will complain about the script, though. There are moments of good dialogue in the film, but then there are passages that are so stiff and cliche ridden as to make even a B-movie connoisseur blush, like the ""culture medium"" quote of my title, a passage which got more convoluted (and full of improperly used scientific terms) as the scene progressed, although Billy Burke did a decent job throughout the film, even with lines this silly.

There are a few extras, such as a ""Making of Komodo"" short, which accounts for a one star deduction in my rating. The Director, Michael Lantieri (a special effects wizard) seems like a nice guy with a good grasp of filmmaking, but the Producers seem really self-important and pompous. First, Executive Producer Devesh Chetty makes the assertion that the film is not a creature feature, but is a sophisticated psychological thriller, and then Producer Tony Ludwig has the nerve to say ""It's probably close to what Hitchcock had always liked to do."" Uh, no. It is not at all what Hitchcock ever did or aspired to do. Get real.

There is another documentary on komodos and on the computer generation process (called ""Maximum Fear"") which was fairly interesting. Also included is a photo gallery, cast biographies, a game of some sort (which I did not look at), a trivia game, and a ""Komodo Facts"" section. In other words, there are a lot of extras for a B-movie DVD.

Although this movie is totally implausible (komodos don't live in South Carolina, and most biologists don't know how to fly a helicopter) and has a very uneven script the actors are generally good, and for fans of monster movies, it is decent, mindless entertainment.

1088218,2,6305943133,"In any movie that takes place on an island, the writer needs to come up with a way of getting the characters to the island. Plane crashes and boats run aground in a storm are a couple of good ways. One of the worst ways would be to have a therapist take a traumatized kid there as part of his therapy, to overcome his fears (which of course turn out to be real). Does anyone picking up a cheezy monster movie want to sit through the drudgery of a solid hour of little what's-his-name staring blankly into space, while his therapist prattles on about who cares what?

 The complete lack of intelligence in this thing is also a drudgery. An oil company has poisioned the environment on the island, but they also tell us the oil company didn't find oil, but struck water instead. So, did they have a big water spill on the island or something? Or did the employees just throw too many Twinkie wrappers on the ground? Not to mention that whole subplot point isn't even necessary. It's a cheezy monster movie - we'll accept that the komodo's want to eat the people without having to explain it.

 The concept is terrible, the writing isn't much better, the acting is lackluster (or in the case of the kid, non-existant), and the whole thing just drags and drags and drags. Pick up any moster movie at random and you'll almost surely do better than this thing.",1090627200,8,1354,4.44758064516129

Years later a psychiatrist wants to take the boy back to the island so that he can confront his fears.  It seems like a good idea scientifically but the monsters are real.  Somehow the oil company controls the island but the family still owns a house there.  The two groups clash together and with the dragons.  The boy goes off on his own and turns savage and takes vengeance on the lizards.
The dragons were designed by the same man who did the dinosaurs for Jurassic Park but the great effects are not supported by the rest of the film.  Bad acting and writing pull the movie down.

There are some richly intense scenes, and Lantieri does well in creating atmopsheric tension.  Unfortunately, there's no explanation as to why the Komodos have grown so huge; and why didn't the oil company get rid of them sooner?

Set in North Carolina -although filmed in Queensland ,Australia -this deals with a group of people being menaced by Komodo dragons who are running riot on an offshore island  having been dumped there some years previously .A teenage boy ,Patrick ,witnessed the dragons slay and devour his parents and his therapist ,who is unaware of the story somewhat unwisely decides he should be returned to the island to try and confront his phobias .While there the dragons attack and the pair are forced to battle for their lives ;meanwhile an oil company working on the island has engaged hunters to slay the dragons and any humans who might expose the problem and embarrass the company
Lots of action and some scenes are reminiscent of Alien as the therapist heroine stalks the corridors of a power station seeking the beasts .There are signs in its hasty and unsatisfying ending that perhaps money and /or inspiration ran out ,while the hint that Patrick in his thirst for revenge on the dragons is reverting to man's more  primitive and bestial instincts -at least the beasts have the excuse of hunger for their actions while he is driven by revenge-is not developed.

Some illegal importer of exotic pets tosses about a dozen Komodo Dragon eggs into an off road ditch on an isolated North Carolina Island, not realizing the scope of what he's doing.  Approx 12-15 years later some of the dragons are full size and have established a regular colony, much to the distress of the island's tourists and lone business (an oil company.)

1088224,2,6305943133,"I don't know what it is about DTV creature features that attracts me so, but in the past few days, I've seen Blood Surf, Mosquito, Shark Attack 2, the Octopus movies, and now Komodo (Octopus is easily the best of the bunch).  In case you couldn't tell from the title, this is a movie that features a bunch of komodo dragons slavering for some human flesh.
More specifically, it's set on a place called Emerald Island, where a teen named Patrick (Kevin Zegers) witnesses the death of his parents at the hands of komodo dragons.  Flash forward sometime later, his psychiatrist, Victoria (Jill Hennessy), brings him back to the island, thinking it'll do his psyche some good.  Unfortunately, all the ""keep out"" signs do little to dissuade them, and soon they're stuck on the island, teaming up with a small group of komodo hunters to find a way off.
Komodo has one asset that surprised me: the special effects are very good, and quite superb for a movie released straight-to-video.  Unsurprisingly, I'd heard this was almost released in theaters, but it's not hard to see why it was pulled back.  While the creature effects are first-rate, nothing else about this movie really is.  Most of the action sequences lack tension and thrills, most of the komodo encounters fail to produce much in the way of fun and are rather sluggish.  Director Michael Lantieri paces the movie way too slowly and he fails to make the komodos appear as a genuine menace.
While I applaud the effort Lantieri puts behind trying to push in some character development, nobody here makes an impression.  It's a bland, boring group we couldn't care less about.  And really, what was the point of making Zegers go ""Lord of the Flies"" on us?  That's not to say the performances are awful, the acting is simply unexceptional.  At least I can say I can't recall a moment I cringed during the movie.
Komodo ultimately also lacks a climax.  The big, action-packed finale we keep expecting (or at least I did, especially considering I saw this after the very fun Octopus) is nowhere in sight.  All we get is a komodo burning up from a flare, which is admittedly very cool to look at, but even Lantieri sort of screws it up by cutting away from the scene too quickly.
There's an obvious attempt here to mine the style and success of Jurassic Park and Anaconda.  A lot of the sets closely resemble those in Park, but they're never really used to their advantage.  Silly as Anaconda was, at least it used its settings to its maximum potential.  Komodo just sort of slogs by on-screen, nothing worthy of note really happening.  Movies like this are determined by whether or not they're fun for the right reasons, and while Komodo is surprisngly almost never awful, it's not fun, either.",1045353600,3,2745,4.685416666666667

1088226,4,6305943133,"""Komodo"" is (obviously) a movie about a bunch of komodos running around on an island. The beginning of the story is very interesting. It sort of explains how the komodos actually got to the island. It's quite logical....but a bit unbelievable at some times. Well, dumping komodo eggs might be a good reason for them to begin existing there. But, how are the komodo fledglings supposed to survive, especially on an island that isn't compatible to them? Well, I'm sure there's a good reason.
  Well, the storyline is interesting and can make you forget what's going on around you. Although, the idea of ""traumatized"" might have been overlooked. Patrick Conally (Kevin Zegers), apparently, lost his family to the komodos and is supposed to be ""traumatized"". Of course he looked traumatized in the photo at the police department, but he seems to be brave and healthy enough to run around freely at the island where his family was killed. Besides, he survived the island(the second time he arrived there) without any weapons and the others have a lot of trouble even with huge guns!
  Plus! The ending seems to be a bit.....abrupt They got off the island on a helicopter, got back at the harbour, sits down on a pavement and that's it! Although I think the idea was to show that Patrick's gotten better:
 Police  : you guys okay?
 Patrick : ...Never better...
  Well, even though I made more comments about this movie than compliments, I still say that this movie is absolutely great! I don't know why....Well, for those who already watched this movie, think the flaws over a few dozen times and it'll make sense.....eventually.....",1037404800,2,1627,4.844765342960288

However there was one short scene that redeemed this movie from [being] so bad. That scene was towards the beginning of the movie when they are in their old station wagon and a komodo dragon jumps in the rear window. At this point you see a rear view of the dragon hanging out of the car and it seem to be fornicating with the station wagon. It is the funniest thing ever and it shakes back and forth and seems very pleased. Then it falls out of the station wagon which is also quite funny.

1088398,4,6305943133,"I have to admit that I'm a bit of a sucker for a good monster movie, and when I heard about KOMDODO (awesome  creatures who have amazed me ever  since I saw one eat a cow whole on a documentary programme!) I couldn't  wait to see it.
Having enjoyed ANACONDA I was expecting more of the  same from KOMODO and more or less that's what you get.  For a low budget  flick it's cast more than come up to scratch, with some nicely judgd  performances all round, and the script is competent enough for the movie to  flow without hardly any cringe worthy dialogue sequences to speak of.  The  young teenager who revisits the island where his parents were brutally  attacked and killed the beasts of the story, particularly impresses,  especially as there's a neat twist near the end where his character seems  to undergo an unexpected but effective transformation.
The direction is  also top notch, with a nicely judged sense of pacing, boasting some  brilliantly executed scare moments (along with fingernail chewing scenes of  creepy moments before the attacks), and the special effects guys and gals  deserve a huge pat on the back for producing some quite awesome looking  Komodos. What's more, unlike ANACONDA (where the big snake moved too  unrealistically during some CGI scenes), the Komodo's actions do hold a  close match to their behaviour in the wild.  The blending of animatronics  and CGI is also impressive, so much so that you begin to even forget which  is which.
It's a shame then, that just when the movie seems to be  building towards a classic monster finale, it falls short and wraps up far  too abruptly.  It really does feel that the company ran out of money and  that the director had to come up with a ham fisted end scene because he had  no other choice.  The last scene after the Komodo mayhem is particularly  poor, and it does harm the film's lasting impression upon you.
Still,  there's some great work beforehand, and I wouldn't hesitate in recommending  this to any monster movie fan, or to anyone who doesn't mind a bit of  fantasy entertainment.
The DVD itself boasts an impressive anamorphic  widscreen print and the use of sound will have you jumping out of your seat  (there's a choice of Dolby Suround 2.0 or Dolby Digital 5.1).  There's also  an audio commentary from the director (but not from the actors as stated on  some sites), trailers, a fascinating real life facts of the Komodo text  file, and two featurette making ofs (although with my copy these could not  always be accessed successfully).

I should also point out that I love reptiles and  actually own a Savannah Monitor, a nicer smaller cousin to the Komodo. I  combed the city for the DVD, but could not rent or buy it anywhere. This  was my second clue, the first being that it went straight to video. I  located the VHS in my local Hollywood Video and raced home. The movie  starts off in the typical way, and then uses the old Aliens aproach of  ""facing your fear"" to get the protagonist back in the action. The  action is pretty slow through most of the movie. When you do see the  dragons, they look awesome, maybe half a notch below the quality of the  dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. There were a couple of cool sequences like when  the dragon comes and knocks over the table, or when the girl is hanging on  to a hung dragon while another looks for her below. The supposedly dead  dragon begins to thrash and the girl says ""this is not  happening"".

I was not  impressed by the story, which was disappointing.
Some exotic animal  smugglers accidentally dump a bunch of komodo dragon eggs on an island in  South? Carolina, and 20 years later, starved and hungry, they attack a  family.  An evil oil company has been covering up the existance of the  komodo's, as they are an endangered species and their discovery would  interrupt their oil pumping.  To make a long story short, the komodo's  chase a bunch of people around the island, and try to eat them.
Don't get  me wrong, I love horror movies.  But this one?  It wasn't horror as much as  it was just plain sad.  It just seemed so senseless.  In the film Cujo,  Cujo is violent and terrifying because he has rabies.  In the Birds, you  don't really know why they're attacking, which is part of the fun.
But  this flick, the Komodos weren't meant to be there, they were just eating  folks because they were hungry, and I don't know, I guess I just felt sorry  for the big lizards.  I know, I'm a softy when it comes to critters.
