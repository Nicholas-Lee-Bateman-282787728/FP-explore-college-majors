8493838,5,B0066D5NZC,I saw this somewhere over a year or so ago and finally ordered for myself.  So relaxing and I can't wait 'til the holiday season - - will be the perfect backdrop for family gatherings and Christmas gift opening.,1489968000,,211,4.410256410256411
8493839,4,B0066D5NZC,"This is a very nice DVD set.  At the time of ordering, I failed to realize that the bonus Blu-ray disc did not have all of the fireplace options that the regular DVD had.  Knowing that now, I still would have purchased it.  However, on Christmas Day, we had to put the regular DVD on rather than the Blu-ray in order to have the Christmas-themed option. Everyone enjoyed having it on, especially since the temperature was unusually warm (far too warm for a real fire) in our nook of the woods.",1485302400,,493,4.395604395604396

8493841,5,B0066D5NZC,"Nice picture clarity and sound effects. Soothing, romantic, and/or great to play on tv in background while having guests or shooting pool. Inexpensive visual imitation of new tv type electric fireplaces. Noticed last night that local tv station played this video during their shutdown for the Christmas Eve/Christmas holiday. Great to have a Blu-ray copy for main player in living room with dvd for bedroom.",1419465600,3,407,5.276923076923077

8493843,1,B0066D5NZC,"The fires are just not realistic. The logs don't burn down, it's as though they filmed a gas fire with fake logs. The beach fire could be in a warehouse.

This one is better - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BVB33G/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1",1401321600,7,260,6.222222222222222
8493844,5,B0066D5NZC,"It's true.  He thought I was crazy for ordering a DVD of a fireplace, but last night he asked if he could play it on the TV in his office while he worked on his school work.  Since this particular one came with both a DVD and a Blu-ray, we can use one in his office and the other in our living room.  It made Christmas feel more special, and I'm looking forward to to some evenings with it in relaxing with my husband.  I'm so glad I bought it!",1358812800,4,444,3.9
8493845,5,B0066D5NZC,"We had both a Wood Burning and Gas Fireplace for 30 years. We moved and have not had a fireplace for the past ten years. We miss not having a fireplace and thought about purchasing and installing a gas fireplace, but after checking out the total cost, we decided there had to be a substantially cheaper way. We checked out Electric units and new fuel burning units, but again, the Electric units costs seemed much too high for what you get and the visual appeal and sound of a crackling fire didn't impress us much on these. We also checked out the new Ventless fuel units but the fuel costs would be really expensive if it was used used a lot. Why have it if not to use?
We saw this DVD at Walmart and decided why not give it a try. What a surprise, this is awesome! The flames and sound make it feel exactly as if you have a good roaring fire going. We don't have a Blu-Ray player, just a Sony Home Theater DVD Player with Surround sound and a 42"" Samsung LCD Unit but after playing, it is totally worth the money. In our opinion, it is great! We're already thinking about setting up a cheap LCD Monitor and mounting it low on the wall and using it as a ultra modern fireplace display complete with sound, year round. Would be cheaper than paying for an Electric unit with just ""so so"" visual appeal & sound or the high cost of installing a Gas unit. Enjoy it! No smoke, no fuel cost, no flames or sparks, great sound and stunning visual appeal, what could be better?",1322611200,19,1469,4.25
