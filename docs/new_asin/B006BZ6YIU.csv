They have only two original members and none of the guys who started the band. From the title, I was hoping for origanal footage.
Disheartening!",1506556800,2,171,4.733333333333333

8496178,2,B006BZ6YIU,"Like many Styx fans, I was excited to see this presentation.
I grew up listening to Styx and went to many of their live concerts.
I still listen to their original music today.

After about 4 songs of this presentation I simply looked at my wife and groaned.
NO Dennis DeYoung!

Tommy Shaw and the few original band members who were there are fantastic parts
of Styx but without Dennis they are just a cover band playing at an Indian Casino.

Too many bands are doing this these days, substituting their lead vocalist for someone
who copies and sounds a bit like them... like that filipino kid jumping around and singing
like he is a tenured member of Journey.

To me it is fake and disgusting for tenured bands to keep the same name and present the same
songs when such an integral part of their sound is missing.",1484784000,,813,4.436241610738255

8496181,5,B006BZ6YIU,"This is an excellent live concert event. The band is in top form as they perform these 2 complete albums. The camera work is great with many angles and close-ups as if the camera men knew when to catch the performers at opportune times. And the camera stayed on the guys for longer times. This was very enjoyable to watch. The documentary about setting up the show was also highly entertaining! From the lighting, sound, guitar techs, drum tech, bass techs, video behind the stage and more. I've seen The Band's ""The Last Waltz"", The Talking Head's ""Stop Making Sense"". And some other great rock shows. I've got to tell you, this rock show is pretty darn good too!",1436486400,,664,4.588235294117647
8496182,5,B006BZ6YIU,I taped this show on VH1Classic (with commercials) and have watched it many times.  It reminds me of when I saw Styx back in 1981.  We are moving so I will be losing all of the movies I've saved on my DVR so I am going to purchase it.  I think these 2 albums were Styx' BEST and the live show is so great!!!,1426032000,,307,3.765625
