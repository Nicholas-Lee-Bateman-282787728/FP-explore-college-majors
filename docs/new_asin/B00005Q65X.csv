7949831,5,B00005Q65X,This is the rarest of the rare anim-wise. Yet only 30 hours of video of the Angels was ever made!,1492128000,,97,3.9
7949832,5,B00005Q65X,Fell in love with the whole dirty pair series,1469577600,,45,4.111111111111111
7949833,3,B00005Q65X,I don't know why this is on my list. I don't actually have this on DVD but I have seen the Dirty Pair OVAs and I do like them.,1424736000,,126,3.3793103448275863
7949834,5,B00005Q65X,"As an avid watcher of the Dirty Pair on cable in the late '90's early 2000's, I got hooked on how the girls worked and their inane banter.  If you are a follower of the Original Dirty Pair, this should fit right into your collection as it completes the episodic series before the feature lengths were created.  The copy is good and the audio tracks cover the scenes well.",1398816000,,371,4.36231884057971
7949835,4,B00005Q65X,"Like I said on the first volume, this 80's anime is really cool. Kei and Yuri are two really great chracters. The episodes on this disc are a bit more serious than the first, but they are still very fun to watch. My favorite episode is the one about the little girl and her robot dog, for I thought the suspense is really good.",1181347200,,327,4.125
7949836,5,B00005Q65X,"This is the 2nd part of the OVA, and it's really good. My favorite episode was ""Sleeping Beauty""; the interaction between Kei and the little girl was sooo cute. My least-favorite episode (although, oddly enough, the most timely) was ""Revenge Of the Muscle-Lady"", which is a cautionary tale about the dangers of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs. Just like Part 1, there is no graphic nudity and no sex (although there are plenty of beautiful women in revealing outfits). There is lots of violence, and most of it is quite graphic. Overall, lots of fun to watch! My rating: 10/10.",1115596800,2,592,4.93
7949837,4,B00005Q65X,"This DVD completes the series with the last 5 OAVs. This time around the stories have a greater feeling of substance. Supporting characters are more fleshed out especially in episodes like ""Revenge of the Muscle Lady"", and ""Sleeping Beauty"" where they draw on the 3WA's past. Madame Beryl appears as a recurring character, as well as ""Q"", an obvious homage to Bond. The weakest episode is probably ""Red Eyes are the Sign of Hell"". Audio and video are still quality stuff for such an old TV program, and the dubbing does the show credit. I was pleased to see the credit-less ending sequence appear on this disk, not the only such duality that makes this a satisfying bookend to the first DVD. Anyone who likes Dirty Pair, especially if they own the first DVD, owe it to himself or herself to complete this fine set.",1008633600,7,814,4.620689655172414
