6600347,5,B00MRDWEPM,"I had just terminated a nursing assistant during the week. A single mother making $10.00/hr.  She violated policy. After watching this documentary the weekend after that termination, I cried for the girl in it and the girl I had just let go. I have always had someone in my life helping take care of me - father, grandfather, husband. I have always lived in the middle class world & never had to even think about where I'd get my next meal nevermind having to worry about feeding and caring for children. This documentary was such an eye opener. It made me change the way I manage these young girls with whom I  employ & manage. I am less quick to terminate and more often counsel & teach. I try to educate & make them valued employees. As far as the nursing assistant I terminated - I called her from my home after seeing this documentary. I asked her to come back to work. She told me that she was so appreciative for the opportunity & she would be the exemplary nursing assistant from then on out. And she was. I recently changed nursing homes & this young lady is one who is following me to my new facility. She has become one of the best nursing assistants that I have ever worked with. Thanks to those who made this film. It may have been intended to start the discussion about women & poverty, but it helped me be a better director of nursing! And for that, I thank you.",1417305600,23,1377,4.312741312741313
6600348,5,B00MRDWEPM,"A touching and powerful documentary, that gains much from its plain, heartfelt telling.

A year in the life of one of Americas working poor.  People who have jobs, sometimes more than one, or lose them and desperately want to make a life, but cant seem to get a break.  It would be hard to imagine even the most hard hearted call Ms. Gilbert a taker -- watching her struggle to do the best she can for her three children while earning $9.49 a hour.  She works as a Certified Nursing Assistant at a nursing home, a job that demands expertise both human and medical.  Yet she earns too little to be able to do anything but barely scrape by.

A stinging and powerful rebuke to those who feel the poor somehow deserve their fate, the film does so much by letting us get to know one woman and her story, instead of only trying to paint a huge canvas to tackle one of the most important crises facing our nation.",1408233600,5,906,4.3

6600350,5,B00MRDWEPM,"If you ever take a min wage job, you will meet people exactly in these straits.  Some turn to drugs, to alcohol, to daily lotto, etc.  Others, like this woman, just keep plugging on, in spite of it all.  The sheer grind and impossibilities of this daily life would bring most people to their knees.  This documentary shows exactly what life is like living at minimum wage.  Every thing the person has: time, money, labor, assisting others, has to be calculated every single day because there's not enough of any of it to go around.  We all make mistakes, most of us still get ahead because we squeeze through or we limit ourselves to paths that won't result in additional hardships for us.  Should we penalize young adults who don't make good choices for their future?  As low-income parents, breaking the poverty cycle in our children could be impossible because they'll face the same choices as we did , & our mistakes become their example of a ""do-able"" lifestyle.  The help our Society can consistently offer is positive compassion for one another--it's free, and lightens the load.  And, we can use tax dollars to invest in programs (like this pre-school) that give the family better options later in life.  We can't just leave struggling people by the side of the road and say, ""you made your bed..."".  People will always have sex and have kids, Society has to keep an eye on the big picture and make opportunities available for those families struggling to overcome misjudgments.  A big thanks to you, Ms. Shriver, for keeping the life of poverty within our vision & thoughts.",1480118400,8,1583,4.733576642335766
6600351,5,B00MRDWEPM,Wonderful documentary!,1479254400,,22,10.5
6600352,5,B00MRDWEPM,"This is a wonderful film that shows how hard it is to support a family:1- if you are a single mother and 2- If you are trying to do it on minimum wage. The typical stereotype of ""the poor"" is that they are not hard working- however, as seen in this film- they work harder than most CEOs in America. They have to develop an ""art"" of stretching a dollar and to provide for their children without their childrenbeing aware of their sacrifices. This is one woman's story but you can multiply it hundreds more and still not come close to the number of Americans living at the poverty level or below- especially women and children",1477353600,2,624,4.387931034482759
6600353,4,B00MRDWEPM,"Chronicles the existence of a 30-year-old gal who has three children and is separated from her husband because he had been a pill popper and was unable to keep a job. She works as a nurse's assistant in a retirement home making $9.49 an hour. She has medical issues and aspires to go to school. Additionally she has an on-again-off-again boyfriend.

Sad and insightful as she aspires to make end$ meet. Despite scraping by she does manage to spend $80 on getting her hair done for a treat to herself.",1454803200,,500,4.555555555555555
6600354,5,B00MRDWEPM,"I use this video (and the supporting viewing guide available online) in my Human Service course. It really humanizes the realities of the working poor. It does so without being overly dramatic or shoving the situation down your throat. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to learn more about the life experiences of a working mom with children, who is in a situation that she never intended to be.",1447200000,2,403,4.690140845070423
6600355,1,B00MRDWEPM,This was a horrible documentary. Nothing was explained. Why did they lose their food stamps? What was the deal with the trailer? Did she own it and was renting it out to her husband? Did her boyfriend own the house where they moved? Why were his daughters taken away from him? Where did the puppy come from and why did they have to get rid of it? What was the point of this movie? To show that this one person had a hard time supporting her family? It could have been more informative about the plight of the working poor in general.,1441324800,8,533,4.235294117647059
6600356,5,B00MRDWEPM,Very well done. Thought provoking.,1440374400,5,34,6.0
6600357,5,B00MRDWEPM,"I WAS Katrina and know her struggles.  I'd would just really like to know that the proceeds of this moving and most TRUE and heartbreaking documentary are in some small way, helping her and her family. Is there a follow-up on how she is doing?",1439856000,,243,4.4
6600358,4,B00MRDWEPM,"This documentary shows the resilience and character of the working poor. Katrina Gilbert and the teachers at Chambliss Center are caring for our most precious family members: the elderly who themselves sacrificed to raise us and the children who are our future. These workers are doing a good job, they are doing it for minimum wage, and they are sacrificing the well being of their own families to do it. Katrina's story is a valuable lesson in how to keep up your spirits, establish loving relationships, and work toward improving you life in the face of enormous setbacks. It also underscores the truth that the people we depend on to keep our own families afloat need and deserve more than a minimum wage. This is an eye-opening film about how families in our society survive when they are living on the edge.",1437609600,5,813,4.732394366197183
8674267,2,B00MRDWEPM,"I am not without empathy but can't help but cringe at the stupidity of having pets when you SERIOUSLY can't afford them, and don't have the time and energy to clean up after them.  Does Katrina really think it does her kids any good to have a puppy and then force them to say goodbye to that pet?  Treating the cats like pieces of trash in the way, including kicking one to keep it outside really was sad.  Then another cat having kittens.  Not good.  Tattoos, hair coloring, and frankly, too many kids at a young age, with a loser partner has set her up for nothing but failure and hardship.  Katrina seems like a very wonderful person with bad decision making skills.  There was no mention of her parents or in-laws stepping in to lend a hand, so she may come from the same upbringing she is giving her kids now.  Or maybe her parents are disgusted with her decisions.  Too bad there seems to be no family to help her out.  Her kids will probably grow up with the same mindset.  It's all they know.  The unfair wage scale in this country is horrific.  Knowing that, I hope young people base their life decisions on their personal well being before having children, buying expensive cars, etc.",1533427200,,1194,4.422018348623853
8674268,4,B00MRDWEPM,"Had to stop watching after 15 minutes. This woman's life is no picnic. Faced with the same situation, I wouldn't know how to cope.",1532131200,,130,4.458333333333333
8674269,5,B00MRDWEPM,Great peek into a CNA's life working every day with very little pay and living check to check. Much respect to all CNAs!!,1503014400,,121,4.304347826086956
8674270,4,B00MRDWEPM,"I've watched this on the HBO channel.  very insightful on how a majority of single parents are living.  at least she is putting her kids first and doing for them, instead of those who just worry about themselves and not their kids.  I would recommend watching it",1497916800,,262,4.531914893617022
8674271,5,B00MRDWEPM,"A heart rending look at the shear abandonment of our society for those raising our next generation. Yes, she could have made ""better"" choices _ like not birthing the future taxpayers who will pay for our Social Security. But when her boy'friend' relies on her generosity for lodging in her trailer home and, then, has the gall to stress the importance of her going back to school to benefit ""all"" of them.... It's high time we appreciated the enormous amount of unpaid labor family caregivers provide.",1496534400,,501,4.837209302325581
8674272,4,B00MRDWEPM,"Good and honest story. The lady who provided daycare is a real hero, her positive attitude is sure to rub off on the kids in her care.",1496534400,,134,4.0
8674273,5,B00MRDWEPM,Excellent.,1489795200,,10,10.0
8674274,4,B00MRDWEPM,"very well documented. This is an all too common situation in our country. People think our social programs go to lazy welfare bums, but this is the type of person it goes to. Someone who works constantly and who still can't make ends meet because of such a poor paying wage.",1489017600,3,274,4.392156862745098
8674275,4,B00MRDWEPM,"Depressing, but it'll make you appreciate your situation (assuming it is better).  The woman in the documentary does a few things she shouldn't, but it's just part of the cause and effect of her life.  The better person in the whole thing is the teacher's assistant who seems to really be balanced and enjoy her job.  It raises good issues, but it doesn't present any solutions and I'm not sure if there are any easy ones.  What she's really missing short term is a good support system of family/neighbors/community.  Perhaps they aren't shown to the same extent.",1488672000,3,563,4.762886597938144
