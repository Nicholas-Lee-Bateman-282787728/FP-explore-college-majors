8405582,5,B003U1K4Y8,"I chose the five star rating because the advanced vhs is what I use the most.  I purchased it in 1998, but because it is so old, it is starting to come apart.  That is why I purchased it through your organization.  I workout to the advanced Taebo between five to seven times a day, six days a week.  It is my favourite one. It has just the right intensity I need to burn calories, lose weight and keep the weight off. The Basic Taebo is also very good. Yes I would suggest these items to everyone.",1393200000,,497,4.092783505154639
