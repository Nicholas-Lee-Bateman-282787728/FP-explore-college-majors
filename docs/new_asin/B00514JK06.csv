4519401,1,B00514JK06,"Totally not a reliable running movie to show to new runners at the HS or College level, it just talks about the life and drama of a running club called ""Bandidos"".  In most of the movie there was just people talking.",1355270400,,216,4.2682926829268295
4519402,2,B00514JK06,"I liked the women in this movie. I liked what they were trying to accomplish. I was rooting for them. That said, I have seen better crafted (produced, shot, edited) documentaries done by 6th graders. The production value was seriously atrocious, and I would venture to say, maybe the worst I've ever seen. Would I recommend watching it? Yes, I think so. But only if you can overlook the homespun, ""I did this in my basement as I had time"" feel.",1351641600,8,444,4.493827160493828
4519403,4,B00514JK06,"interesting view into the goals of a handful of incredible athletes from arizona.  We're not sure why these women were chosen per se, out of the thousands of other equally incredible athletes who have overcome equally challenging odds, but we're engrossed in their effort to succeed nonetheless.  In hindsight its strange that we never got into the training... at all.  and we never REALLY got into the personal lives of any of them.  I give it four stars cause only three minutes after the movie and I'm wondering what I actually saw.  These are real people reaching for incredible goals and you kinda, just a little bit, get to go on 1/2 of the emotional roller coaster with them, maybe a 1/4 of the training with them, and a 1/4 of the races with them.  it sounds bland as a write but I was captivated till the end.  I chalk it up to runner's envy.  Ill never reach their level of success and its always great to see humans reach so far.  thanks for the documentary 26 TWO PRODUCTIONS.  Time to make another, even better one!  :)",1347235200,,1032,4.46524064171123
4519404,3,B00514JK06,"Ya know, it was okay. Not incredibly inspiring, and at times somewhat confusing. Was this a movie about women who run fast, women who want to qualify for Boston, women who want to qualify for the olympic trials, or about the Schumacher's divorce? The commentator is talking about their divorce as they show pictures and video of apparently their wedding day. Or were they celebrating their divorce? I don't know, not clear on that part.

I enjoyed the comeback story of June. THAT was very inspirational, she lives in the same city I do, and I hope to meet her someday. The whiney Karla was a bit much, but hey, we all have running friends like that. Suzy and some chic whose name I can't remember were interesting figures in the documentary if only in the fact that they, as Masters, qualified for the olympic trials.

I guess I was expecting more.",1342828800,2,849,4.578947368421052
4519405,5,B00514JK06,I really enjoyed watching Fast Women because I love running and it was nice to see women embracing the challenges and fulfillment that come along with competing in marathons! This video is great and you'll love it too!,1341878400,,218,4.7631578947368425
4519406,5,B00514JK06,Very inspirational and well made. Follows more than one runner while maintaining a coherent pace. Well worth the rental cost! I'd love to see a sequel.,1334620800,3,151,4.846153846153846
4519407,5,B00514JK06,"Great documentary here. If you are a sociable runner and enjoy running tales to give a bit of inspiration, this is a 5 star.

This is an interesting documentary/docudrama looking at the challenges and successes of a few women engaged in the lifestyle and the art of running/marathon training. As a marathoner myself I enjoyed each of the runners' stories and felt inspired to run immediately after (although it doesn't take much to make me feel this way).

It is a movie sociable runners will enjoy. It is a great contribution to the videos out there on running and would fit well into your collection especially if you have others like:

If you own and enjoyed any of the above - I think you will also appreciate this one as well.

It could also be a wonderful course video for Applied Media students as the style and simplicity of the film is one new videograpers and those whom want to produce their own documentaries.

It is probably not a movie for non-runners, or more specifically for folks not looking for inspirational tales from athletes.  It could be, but I just want to point out that this is not a Hollywood blockbuster here. BUT - I need to stress again, if a runner the rating will probably be very high.",1323216000,10,2163,7.42578125

4519411,1,B00514JK06,"Looooong narratives and really horrible audio make this impossible to watch.  I made it to the second ladies story, she was so soft-spoken it was almost impossible to hear her, especially over the background music someone added (bad idea).  There was also kid noise and questions form the interviewer who was not on mic.  I wanted to be able to follow this, but its just impossible to do with this audio.  Can I have my money back?",1432339200,,431,4.558441558441558

4519414,3,B00514JK06,"It was ok - good for motivation as others said. I was hoping for something that spoke more to masters who didn't have their eye on elite aspirations though and more about the challenges masters women face and how they handle them, things like that.",1413072000,,248,4.533333333333333

Weird sound quality, endless uninteresting stories. I can't help but wish these runners well, but the documentary did them a disservice. Boring.",1412640000,,296,4.711538461538462
4519416,1,B00514JK06,Not worth spending a cent on. I would suggest to Delalis that this be put on youtube where people can see it for free. Long interviews with nothing but the person sitting there talking. Poor production and sound quality. I still haven't made it through the whole movie and not sure that I ever will. It's probably not worth it.,1409788800,,327,4.466666666666667

4519418,3,B00514JK06,If you watch this you will fell like you sat near the front runners before and after they ran at a moderate to elite level.  The filming is something you could probably do yourself with a couple hours training.  It has some value but if you are wanting to learn how they train in any detail then you need to look elsewhere.  If you want some insights on what it is like then watch this.,1403481600,,386,4.12
4519419,3,B00514JK06,This is a good runner's documentary... And there are not many. Watching the runners and hearing their stories of progression and failure alike make for an interesting show. There is a lot of personal information on the runners -- almost too much for me but it still was able to keep my interest because it cut to running frequently enough.,1399334400,,339,4.666666666666667
4519420,1,B00514JK06,"But this was not a good movie. Too much talk, not enough running. Seemed kind of home made video -like.",1392422400,2,103,4.2
4519421,5,B00514JK06,"Watched while on the treadmill for a longish run.  Great movie.  One part made me a little nauseated when the camera was flipping around, but overall excellent, informative and heart-warming",1391558400,,190,5.3

4519424,4,B00514JK06,"I'm a runner and if you're a runner you'll love this piece.  It's ""running drama"" about as best as can be described. Follows a group of runners, their families and coaches on their journey to Olympic trials. Each of the women has a different style and approach to running, as well as their coaches.

Some drama with coach infidelity puts them to the test. This is NOT an instructional video.
Women and masters runners will find this piece very inspiring.",1375315200,3,454,4.6625

4519426,5,B00514JK06,This documentary is an awesome way for a new runner to become motivated and energized through their first workouts.  When I did not want to exercise. I watch it.  This was well worth watching and worth the time.,1360108800,2,211,4.526315789473684
4519427,4,B00514JK06,The only thing that I did not like/understand was why it was necessary to mention the coach's infidelity to his wife. It detracted from the story and made you take your focus off the runners and their accomplishments.,1358899200,,217,4.7368421052631575

8452278,2,B00514JK06,"very slow, low quality, much of this is simply filmed in same rooms, not enough out in the field coverage, poor editing. Not material, if you absolutely love runningas I do this will still be a slow , somewhat boring watch.",1475020800,,223,4.463414634146342
8452279,4,B00514JK06,"Just another group of women creating drama in their lives over nothing.  What else would you expect...

They run fast, though - really fast.

So, if you like watching women have drama over something very simple like running, then go for it.  One person has a high-pitched child's voice, and it is like listening to nails scratching down a chalk board.",1473638400,,351,4.704918032786885
