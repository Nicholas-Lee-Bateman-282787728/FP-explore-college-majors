7970820,5,B00006JY42,"I liked a lot this most excellent, albeit unusual, British war film. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

First, two IMPORTANT precisions:

1) This is a REGION 2 DVD - it will NOT play on US DVD players.

2) This movie looks much more like TV theatre than a ""real"" film. All action occurs only in a handful of rooms, without I believe ever going outside. Some original war footage is inserted and some music from 1940s is occasionally played, but other than that ""Bomber Harris"" is really rather a theatre piece, and its strength reposes mostly on dialogue.

This film tells the story of Marshal of the Royal Air Force, Sir Arthur Travers Harris, 1st Baronet, GCB, OBE, AFC (13 April 1892 - 5 April 1984), commonly caled ""Bomber"" Harris by the press and ""Butcher"" Harris by the RAF Bomber Command crews. He was the commander in chief of Bomber Command from February 1942 until his retirement in September 1946. Soon after taking his functions Harris was ordered by the War Cabinet to launch a campaign of powerful area bombings of German cities using large formations of bombers - it would replace the previous campaign of precision attacks by small groups of planes, which proved to be a complete failure.

""Bomber"" Harris proceded fast and in the night of 30/3& May 1942 he launched the first of the terrible raids on Germany - it was the operation ""Millennium"", in which 1000 bombers attacked Cologne (Kln). From that time until the end of war Bomber Command would relentlessy and mercilessly pound German cities, causing enormous destructions and killing tens of thousands civilians. There is no question that those attacks greatly contributed to Hitler's defeat, but they were hard to accept to many people in United Kingdom. A particularly great outcry was caused by the attack of RAF and USAAF on Dresden on 13 February 1945, in which at least 25.000 Germans were killed. Harris was particularly targeted by the press following this raid, even if in fact the request for the obliteration of Dresden came from the highest levels of power, as it was ordered by Churchill and Roosevelt, after Stalin requested it in the strongest possible terms to help the Red Armly advance deeper into Germany, towards Berlin.

Just to be precise, this film covers ONLY World War II years of life, from his appointment as Commander in Chief of Bomber Command in 1942, to the Victory Day (8 February 1945).

John Thaw is EXCELLENT as ""Bomber"" Harris (he in fact looks quite like him) and he is the main reason of the success of this film. Obstinate, strong minded (even pigheaded...), impatient and having little use for diplomacy, his Harris appears as an extremely interesting person and a very efficient soldier, forcing respect even if one doesn't agree with him. Other actors also did very well, especially Robert Hardy, who plays Churchill.

This film shows both points of view in the debate about allied bombing campaign against German cities, without openly picking its side - and I think it is a good choice. This film also is not in any way a hagiography - errors committed by Sir Arthur Harris during the World War II (like his fixation on Berlin as target) are not forgotten.

Although not very long (only 85 mn) and made clearly on a little budget, this is nevertheless a powerful and important movie, from which it is possible to learn a lot. I will keep my DVD for another viewing in the future. Enjoy!",1372809600,3,3428,4.767284991568297
7970821,4,B00006JY42,"Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris was the commander of RAF Bomber Command from 1942 to the end of the War. He was in charge of the British strategic bombing campaign which brought the war into the heart of Germany at a time when the German Wehrmacht controlled almost all of Europe.  After the fall of France in 1940 there was no way the British, isolated on their island, could confront Germany except by bombing from the air.  Thus, due to the fact that losses were unacceptably high  and bombing accuracy unacceptabley low in the original program of daylight bombing of ""precision targets"" like munitions and aircraft factories, it was decided to carry out ""area bombing"" tactics which meant bombing of the German cities in order to disrupt the life of the cities and the economic and military production that went on there. It must be emphasized that although Harris is criticized for this policy HE DID NOT INITIATE IT. It was a government decision made before he took charge of Bomber Command. One major problem was that this decision was hidden from the public which was lead to believe that ""precision targets"" were being hit, although anyone who thought about it would realize that would be very difficult at night.
This film shows Harris as he took command and his persistence in keeping the Command going against criticisms that its ""area bombing"" policy was ineffective, too costly or immoral.  The actor portraying Harris does a good job in showing his dogged determination and brusque manner in dealing with those around him. It also shows his concern for those working for him and how they should be properly treated regarding supplies and working conditions. It must be remembered that all the Bomber Command aircrews were volunteers and even during the worst periods when losses were at the highest, such as during the so-called Battle of Berlin in 1943-4, there was no lack of new volunteers . Harris had a ""can-do"" attitude that inspired his men to keep going no matter what.
The film deals largely with Harris' ""political"" problems in dealing with the Air Ministry and the government, including Churchill. Unfortunately, the film does not show how the airmen under him reacted to him and he to them and the immense pressures they were under. The fact that they did not call him ""Bomber Harris"", but rather ""Butcher Harris"" does show some sort of ambivalence, but they stuck with him in the end.
At the end of the war and after, the British government changed its view of Harris and the bombing campaign and a negative view of Harris became popular. This film, to its credit, shows that Harris was carrying out goverment policy, and in particular, the controversial Dresden firestorm raid in February 1945 is shown clearly to have been carried out under direct orders from Churchill and Eisenhower at the behest of Joseph Stalin who wanted German military and civilian activity in eastern Germany facing the advancing Red Army disrupted. To this day people ask ""Germany was on the verge of defeat at this point and did surrender several weeks later, so this raid was unnecessary"". A statement like that is make with 20/20 hindsight. As the Allies closed in on Germany, Germany resistance, particularly against the Russians was stiffening. Allied casualties were continually increasing.  No one knew how much longer Germany would hold out and every day the war was continued meant thousands of casualties on both sides. The Dresden attack, in addition to disrupting the German eastern front, showed the Germans that continued resistance was futile and they would pay a high price for it. In the end, 100,000 Soviet soldiers died in the final battle for Berlin.

Harris did make many mistakes and they are shown. He fervently believed that massive area bombing would cause Germany to collapse WITHOUT the need for an Operation Overlord-like ground invasion. Although there was some reason to believe that this might happen, due to the fact that the German's collapsed with their armies still outside their borders in 1918 at the end of the First World War, but the Nazi regime was different and used mass coercion and terror to keep the population fighting.
Harris was badly wrong about his offensive called ""the Battle of Berlin"" in late 1943-early 1944. Casualties were very high and the amount of damage done to Berlin did not justify the efforts and losses, especially considering there were other targets that were easier to hit at a lower cost. Still, Harris carried on when others were not willing to.

Historians in the last 20 years have re-evaluated the rold of Bomber Command and the US 8th Air Force which carried out daylight raids. They have reviewed the data and found that the bombing was far more effective in disrupting German arms production and it did have a major effect on the morale of the German population than was believed in the years after the war. It is true that the German people did not turn on the Nazi regime, but the massive bombing made it clear to them that they were going to lose the war and that their leaders lead them into a catastrophe. Germany lost World War I decisively, but the war never touched the German homeland, so 20 years later, they were ready for another round. After the Second World War, the Germans had felt on their own persons the horrors of war and this finally convinced them to turn away from the Prussian militarists who had dominated them for so long and they embraced democracy and peace, which has held in Western Europe since 1945.  This is the true legacy of Bomber Harris and his valiant aircrews who sacrificed so much to bring the victory.",1345593600,6,5631,4.8279792746113985
