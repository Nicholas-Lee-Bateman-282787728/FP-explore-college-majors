8428612,4,B004GCGCRI,"I thought 20 Cigarettes was a beautifully realized, deeply moving look at the naivete of some who enter war zones only to leave with a profound realization of the terror and potential for unimaginable damage they actually contain. Vinicio Marchioni is superb in the leading role of a videographer who during his first full day in Iraq is mortally wounded yet survives to provide us with what I felt was an incredibly realistic portrayal of the aftermath of devastating injury and loss. The rest of the cast was excellent as well. 20 Cigarettes is visually arresting, very well written, and entirely believable. I recommend it although it should be mentioned that the scenes depicting the explosion and the medical treatment of the protagonist are not always easy to abide.",1367539200,,772,4.992248062015504
8428613,5,B004GCGCRI,"A remarkable first film, made by Amadei from his own real life
experience of going to Iraq in 2003 to be an assistant director on a
movie, and almost winding up dead.

The war sequences are terrific and powerful in execution; harrowing,
cinematic, real and yet stylized, largely seen from a subjective
camera.

The film is quite moving in the end, and Amadei is willing to let
himself (played very well by Vincio Marchioni) come off as a flawed,
real human being. Re-examining one's self and one's traumatic
experience with a sense of clarity, but without losing emotion would be
a challenge for any artist, but as a first feature it is very special.

I also liked that the film wasn't afraid to be a very disturbing film
about the realities of war, but still have a comedic edge at time. Life
is both tragic and funny, but rare is the film that can walk both sides
of that street.

Once in a while the style gets a bit overdone, to the point of breaking
a sense of reality, but that's a small fly in a very rich ointment.

I hope Amadei's will continue to make films, and that his immense talent
can translate to telling stories other than his own.

BTW: The blu-ray looks great, and Amadei does a commentary in
English which is both interesting and further humanizing.",1355529600,,1270,4.5
