7912707,4,B00000JN2N,"""Marlene"" is an absorbing and haunting documentary on the life of Marlene Dietrich.  The movie pivots around several days of interviews between Marlene Dietrich (interviewed towards the latter years of her life)  and director Schell.  Due to contractual arrangements, the director is  unable to photograph Marlene during the interview.  This forces Schell to  create a documentary which will hold the viewer's interest.  Using the  recorded interview as a background, Schell surveys Marlene's extraordinary  career through movie footage and news reports.  It is apparent that not all  went well during the interview - Mr. Schell apparently became upset at not  being able to photograph Marlene's face during the interviews and Marlene  makes a lengthy comment about this in the film.  To his credit, Schell does  create a very interesting film BUT at times, I thought Schell's approach  was a derivative of the master's (Orson Welles) ""F for Fake.""  (Marlene - commenting on Orson Welles in this movie states that ""he  was a genius."")  This movie is definately a MUST for Marlene fans and  Schell is to be applauded for his efforts.  Marlene's integrity and acuity  shine in this movie.  For the Marlene fan who knows her films intimately,  it's like Falling In Love Again.  Informative, honest and haunting, this  movie earns four stars.",959299200,,1338,5.193396226415095
