581690,5,6303060013,"First off, you have to watch this movie.  They do not have it available from Netflix or Blockbuster, so you have to buy.  Just kick it old school with a VHS.  It is cool if you watch it by yourself, but I suggest get some friends together and prepare them for an awesome movie.  You just have to watch it.",1211155200,,305,4.033333333333333
581691,4,6303060013,"Blend ""The Terminator"" with ""Hell Comes to Frogtown"" and set it in a Post-Apocalyptic Charleston, S.C. (I am not making this up) and what do you get?  Well, probably a bad case of ocular herpes, but in this case you get ""American Cyborg: Steel Warrior.""

See, as the introduction tells us, it's 17 years after the nuclear wars and humanity has been herded into cities controlled by computers and their Cyborg enforcers.  The population is infertile and the computers are watching over them until they are all eliminated.  BUT ONE WOMAN IS NOT INFERTILE!  She is introduced carrying (literally!) a fetus in a jar who smiles every now and then in a really creepy way.  Her name is...(wait for it) MARY and she is played by the uber-hot Nicole Hansen.  Mary's goal is to break out of the city and into a waiting ship which will then carry her to a free territory controlled by rebels where she will re-start humanity with her super-fetus in a jar (whew!).  She gets the basics of the plan, but before she can be adequately briefed by the rebels, the evil CYBORG (John P. Ryan) breaks into the top-secret facility and kills the rebel scientists.  In the ensuing chaos, Mary manages to escape with the fetus.

  Mary heads towards the ocean and is pursued by the evil Cyborg (who looks like a member of Judas Priest circa 1985) but luckily runs into AUSTIN (Joe Lara), your regular-issue Post Apocalyptic loner/ anti-hero.  Oh, that Austin!  He's so independent!  Austin has some cool weapons that he uses and some interesting loser friends that he and Mary run into while fighting off the typical cannibal mutants and of course, the unstoppable Cyborg who pursues them a la Pepe Le Pew: slow, but steady. The best special efects in the movie are the cyborg's eyes, which appear as green dots.  He looks cool lurking through the darkness, stalking our heroic couple as they flee through the streets of Charleston.  No she-crab soup for them, no sir!  They'll be lucky if the cannibal mutants don't make THEM into soup!

  I won't spoil the ending, but this is a good Post-Apoc. movie with plenty of special effects and a sort-of unexpected ending (depends on how you interpreted the title of the movie).  The actors aren't bad and the plot moves along as steady as the Cyborg's metal feet.  I'd heartily recommend this to fans of  Post Apocalyptic movies as a hidden gem.  Don't get me wrong, it's not so good that fans of bad movies won't like it, it's so good that fans of good movies won't think it's so bad.  Buy it or rent it already!",1116892800,7,2534,4.612975391498882

581694,3,6303060013,"In the not so distant future, humanity is challenged by it's own totalitarian tendencies.  Evil is present in the form of a ruthless government not concerned with the well-being of the people, but in maintaining their power.  To achieve this aim, they have developed a breed of cyborgs to maintain order at any cost and squash the underground resistance.  The Resistance has developed an embryo that can perhaps match the strength and intelligence of these cyborgs, but it's up to a woman, Mary, and a man with a mysterious past, Austin, to ensure that this hope for the future is safe from a cyborg that stalks their every step as they move from one Resistance laboratory to another.  Watch as Austin discovers his dark secret and must move toward a self-realization, and new vision of humanity.",971568000,2,796,4.830882352941177

7839607,5,6303060013,"This is another extremely cool little movie that popped up in 1993, a post apocalyptic sci-fi action movie, After the nuclear war people are sterile and ruled by the artificial intelligences they created, The only woman who was able to give life to a child has to take the child through the dangerous city to the ship to save it. She is followed by an immortal killer robot through all the dangers, and only one guy tries to help her survive and protect her from the killing machine, The movie looks great with good budget locations and sets and costumes, the effects are all practical and look great with some cool cyborg gore in places too, the cast is really good, Joe Lara plays a cool lead action hero and Nicole Hansen plays the sexy female character, the movie soundtrack score is great too and blasts out well with the action etc, if you love good old retro sci-fi and action this is a must check out, quite a little 90's gem.",1420848000,,934,4.436046511627907
