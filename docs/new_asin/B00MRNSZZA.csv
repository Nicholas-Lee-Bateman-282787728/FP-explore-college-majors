4 stars though for the DVD. Almost all the deleted scenes are on either YouTube or on another episode. Only a couple weren't.  The inside jokes was already aired on TV.

6600616,3,B00MRNSZZA,"5 Stars for the show - love the show - and I find them hilarious even re-watching them, so purchasing them makes sense - I had already done so on iTunes.  So I bought this for the extras - but was disappointed in the quantities.
The inside jokes is text that comes up on the screen to talk about insider things - really good insight for fans of the show and I really enjoyed, but this was on only 1 episode - would have been great for more to include this.  There are only 3 audio commentaries.  Each of those had two guys (not all four together).  The Joe and Murr commentary was entertaining, but Sal and Q was not so much (I can hear Sal now: ""'I will never forgive you' for this review"").  Very few behind the scenes or deleted scenes - and some were on YouTube, so not exclusive to the DVD set - very disappointing to be sitting there excited to watch something new and be 'I've already seen this!'.
I'll absolutely continue to watch the show - but if people have a collection of these episodes already (e.g., iTunes), I don't know that I would recommend buying this set.",1418428800,,1076,4.254901960784314

Ever since then I've become a loyal fan/watcher of the show--and a fan of The Tenderloins. The DVD is packed full of all of season 2 antics that the guys give to one another--even the punishments. I loved seeing them all again--binge watching IJ from season one DVD to season two DVD was a lot of fun and highly recommended.

I've personally seen the guys LIVE in person 3 times now and it's true. How they portray themselves on TV is how they are in person. And that's what made me more of a super fan, I guess you could say. Either way, Q, Murr, Joe & Sal put on an amazing show both on TV and in person. The only down fall I have for this DVD is the commentary. I was hoping for more of them. Also more outtakes would've been nice, too, but overall, I loved it.",1417132800,,862,4.130952380952381
