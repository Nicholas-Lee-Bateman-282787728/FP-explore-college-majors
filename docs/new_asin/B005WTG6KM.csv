4899975,1,B005WTG6KM,Absolutely the worst animated movie I have seen. Well except older 1980 Japanese movies which I'm guessing this is. This movie is just absolutely horrible.,1332115200,,155,5.24
4899976,1,B005WTG6KM,My wife rented this for our son to watch and it was awful. We thought the poor audio quality was due to a setting on our DVD player. No such thing. This movie is just awful. The picture quality is 1980 cartoon quality at best. No interest from anyone watching.,1330473600,3,260,4.22
4899977,1,B005WTG6KM,"This is the worst animated movie I have ever watched . It appears to have been made by a 1st year animation student and then had his little brother do the voice over for all the characters. If you rent this movie you will regret spending any money on it.

Horrible. Voices don't even match any mouth movement.
So Bad.  So ,so bad.
I cant believe amazon let this movie be rented.
Don't be tricked by the cover. The animation is much much worse.

I think the voice overs were done by a call center in India over the phone.

Wow  ..this movie sucks!!!",1327276800,11,548,4.230769230769231
8488113,5,B005WTG6KM,"We love this feature, from acting of Rob Scheider, the fantastic story (Plot), and (of course) the never-ending song at the end. I deserve the full rating for title.",1428192000,,165,4.724137931034483

8488115,1,B005WTG6KM,"All the other 1 star posts and the sarcastic 5 star are so right. Right at this very moment my daughter (4 1/2 years ) is watching this movie and she seems barely is interested. I think only watching it because she wanted to watch a movie while eating her lunch ( a special reward ). I got this at the Dollar General for $10, knowing nothing at all about this film ( unfortunately ). Haa silly me -  the cover looked cute and she loves ocean related things so I thought what's $10. It is $10 I can never get back, maybe 10 cents is more likely it's worth and that is generous . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. The animation, the dialogue, the jokes ( sorry Rob Schneider ), the songs, everything is boring. I never post reviews but I want to spare someone else the boredom they will in fact endure. I watched the first 15 minutes and decided to do lunch dishes - dishes for goodness sake, that is how boring it is. Came back into the living room to see if I was just being to critical - apparently not after reading the reviews on a couple sites!

P.S.
 So my review is done and I turn to see if she is still enjoying it - she is asleep - No joke making zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz's  !",1392076800,,1168,4.065217391304348
8488116,1,B005WTG6KM,"Contrary to how it may seem at times, I hate giving overly negative reviews.  Movies, like any form of art, are often great labors of love: The result of love, sweat, tears and toil.  But at the same time, to hold back and try to list only a project's redeeming qualities because of this fact does you absolutely no good when trying to decide if a film is worthy of your collection, your time or even a rental.

Enter 2012's Legend of the Sea.  How a project in this state of disarray manages to make it to market is truly beyond me; especially to a market so competitive that industry giants like Disney (Pixar), DreamWorks and Sony Pictures invest hundreds of millions into a single film and still have no guarantee they'll break even.  Yet somehow Legend of the Sea, through Phase 4 Films, has managed to occupy shelves and Red Box kiosk space right next to Finding Nemo and A Shark Tale, vying for your dollars.

Before determining if this one is right for you, let's take a look at the plot and some of the hard facts first.  Phase 4 Films has created an entire catalog of direct-to-dvd computer animated feature films that begin life as foreign theatrical pieces that are then redubbed in English.  In this case the source material comes in the form of a 2007 Singapore movie of the same name made by Cubix International.  It was rated G originally and while the American version is unrated, it would likely retain the rating.  It comes in at a runtime of 76-minutes and features the voice of Rob Schneider.

The plot, while undoubtedly far less coherent in action than it will appear in this summary, goes like this:  Draco the Little Dragon Prince, son and heir to the throne of the Dragon King, is a playful and irresponsible lad.  Hoping to get away from his life of lessons and schooling, he grabs the Luminous Pearl, the ruler's treasure and source of power, so as to initiate a game of ""pearl ball"" with pals Sam Squid and Ping Puffer.

Ruining an otherwise lovely day of theft and irresponsibility; the threesome becomes entangled with the evil 3-legged octopus (triopus?) Ocho, archenemy of the dragons, who just so happens to be scheming (aloud at that) her plans to get a hold of the elusive Pearl.

Capturing Draco, Ocho decides to ransom the Dragon King on some ""you give me the pearl for the safe return of your son"" action.  But let's not forget that Draco stole the very pearl she's lusting after and the Dragon King has no idea where it went.  Add in a bunch of clueless lackeys, annoying voices, and animation that gets absolutely smoked by the very worst of broadcast television standards and you start to understand what's happening here.

I mentioned above that the piece was originally designed for Singaporean audiences and hence recorded in Mandarin Chinese and hence the mouth flaps line up to an English vocal track with all of the subtlety of a vintage king-fu movie.  Add to this the natural mis-timing that accompanies a foreign film adapted to western audiences (think scenes that run abnormally long and muddled plot points) and things start to get ugly really fast.  As if this all weren't enough, the onscreen antics are absolutely driven into redundancy- we witness the villain plotting on the pearl, are told by a narrator that she's plotting on the pearl, hear that she's plotting on the pearl by her own confessional dialog only to have one of her lackeys ask her if she's plotting on the pearl and then have her answer that she is indeed plotting on the pearl.

This cycle turns what should be quick and painless sequences into absolute torture-fests for adult viewers.  Young children may be able to overlook this redundancy but everyone else is going to lose patience within the first few moments of what will undoubtedly feel like the longest hour and 16-minutes in history.  The truth of the matter is the whole of this story could have been told in a 10-minute animated short.

Even the visuals offer little in the way of distractions.  Textures are jagged and flat, backgrounds are simple and lifeless.  Never does one get the feeling that the film is taking place underwater.  $3.7 million dollars in 2007 should theoretically have resulted in something better than this!  Perhaps a majority of the budget went to paying the vocal cast.  One gets the distinct feeling Rob Schneider did what he could but all comedic genius in the world couldn't salvage what essentially boils down to a kindergarten-era script.

In all, it is nearly impossible to recommend this film to anyone outside of an aspiring computer animator or film student hoping to study what to steer clear of in future projects.  I knew going into this film that it had received an endless stream of negative reviews, have done nearly everything in Phase 4's catalog (check my other reviews) and literally went in with low expectations and still found this one nearly unwatchable.",1364774400,2,4895,4.710093896713615
8488117,1,B005WTG6KM,"I'm concerned my son has suffered brain damage as a result of watching this ""movie"" ... it is an insult to our children's intelligence.  He thought it looked promising and begged, so there we were.  Halfway through, he turned to me and said, ""Hey, at least we can make fun of it and be sarcastic like those robots, right?""  It is jerky, random, and poor in quality, makes blatant use of beaten-to-death stereotypes and at most points makes you want to think about your grocery list.  Please don't make the mistake of buying/renting/telling others.",1359936000,2,547,4.787234042553192
8488118,5,B005WTG6KM,"The Legend of the Sea: It may sound like a generic brand of canned tuna, but trust me, this is the best film you could choose to watch. I found it on Netflix while browsing other films, and was intrigued by the fact that Rob Schneider had voiced a character in it. I noted this to a friend, and we remarked on other marvelous films made by Schneider, such as Deuce Bigalow: European Gigalow and The Hot Chick. We knew we had to watch it, and that was the best decision we have made thus far in life. The storyline is fantastic. It follows young Draco as he defends the Kingdom of the Eastern Sea from the evil octopus Ocho. Every facet of the writing is brilliant, right down to the names of the characters (in case you didn't know, Draco is Latin for dragon, and Draco is a dragon!). The voice acting is superb, and the characters are so diverse. The starfish was even of mixed Latino and Asian descent, as his accent switched between a Spanish accent and an Asian accent between lines. The animation is some of the best animation you will see this year, and the action scenes are full of suspense. And don't even get me started on those musical numbers! You will never want the ending song to end--and luckily, it never does!

The Legend of the Sea: the most important $10 investment you will ever make.",1339545600,4,1305,4.37037037037037
8488119,1,B005WTG6KM,"My seven year old cried her eyes out...the worst movie ever made..It was a free rental.. I should have read the reviews first... we suffered thru the entire sucky movie only to be hit with uncalled for violence at the end..There was a battle scene with shrimp and swordfish battle ... they show all the dead bodies on the ground...some of them are wriggling around like they are in pain and die while you watch... The Father Dragon is speared by the ugly nasty bad guy... the death scene is too graphic for little kids... the father uses his last breath to talk to his son, the son sings a stupid song to his father with flashbacks..the sons hands are shaking like crazy and he is crying nonstop tears..you watch the father take his last breath and die.... my daughter cried for an hour... who the hell came up with stupid stuff ??????...

8488121,1,B005WTG6KM,"The only reason this movie has 1 star is because Amazon won't allow less than that. It deserves NEGATIVE 5 stars. It is easily the worst movie I have ever seen. If you accidentally rented or purchased this pile of garbage for your child, let me assure you, I feel your pain. The sale of this movie should be outlawed and all copies should be collected and launched into the sun.",1334275200,4,378,4.338028169014085
8488122,1,B005WTG6KM,"I had the displeasure of renting this and would have rathered to watch paint dry. The never ending song at the end was way too much and just dragged out an even more painful experience. I agree with other reviews about the poor animination, mismatched voice with lip movement and overall quality of storyline and characters. This is a poor mans version of Finding Nemo. If you get this as a gift, clearly this person hates you!! Bad, bad, bad!",1333929600,,443,4.55
