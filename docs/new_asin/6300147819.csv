7802901,4,6300147819,"Luddy Dublin (Patricia Carmichael) is released from prison after 30 years, for dismembering her mum w/ a big axe. Luddy's homeless now, but lucky for her, a pretty young woman named Ellen, who just happens to live in a mansion w/ her rich aunt Delilah (Agnes Moorehead- THE BAT, HUSH HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE), takes her in. Soon, Luddy is working for Delilah, pushing her around in her wheelchair. Of course, this is a southern-fried gothic, so we quickly learn that Delilah's family is packed full of dubious characters w/ not-so-hidden agendas. One night, Delilah announces her intention to give her home and land to the state. She also tells her relatives about a hidden fortune she's uncovered. Will her ""loving"" family be able to get their hands on it?  Will Luddy be able to hold her shaky sanity together, or will circumstances bring out her maniacal side? DEAR DEAD DELILAH is a tale of greed, multiple murder, and madness. Co-stars Will Geer and Michael Ansara...",1401148800,,969,4.872727272727273
7802902,5,6300147819,Who can resist these films? Older actresses letting it all hang out in the Baby Jane manner. In her last theatrical film  Dear Dead Delilah it is Agnes Moorehead's turn. She gives a wonderful performance as always. But like Joan Crawford and Bette Davis her last role was a B film. If you are a fan it doesn't matter.,1364515200,,317,4.372881355932203
7802903,3,6300147819,"Typical seventies, horror movie involving a buried treasure and a family's murderous attempts to find it and dig it up. The plot is thin and predictable and the ""horror"" scenes are more laughable than terrifying, but a wonderful cast and strong acting pulls this one out of the dumpster.

Agnes Moorehead, as the title character, gives an especially standout performance. Worth a look. END",1285632000,2,389,5.078125
7802904,1,6300147819,"Picture & sound quality rate 1 star, movie itself, rates 2 stars.

Horrible transfer brings little enjoyment of this movie.

Defeats the whole reason for having DVD.

As for the movie itself, low budget ""southern gothic"", slasher film.

Last film role for Agnes Moorehead.  She's wonderful in the film, but even she can't save this dud of a movie. In the same vein as Dementia 13.",1171324800,9,380,4.696969696969697
7802905,3,6300147819,"Growing up in Nashville in the 70's I remember vividly when they were filming scenes for this movie which everyone was talking about. The plot and the characters are pure camp but if you like a good old fashioned blood and gore flick then here it is if you can locate a copy. Agnes Moorehead (Endora from Bewitched) in her last role before dying plays Delilah Charles who lives on an old plantation that her papa left to her when he passed away. He is buried in the old mausoleum on the property. Poor Delilah is surrounded by  her dysfunctional siblings Michael Ansara (ex-husband of Barbara Eden)who plays Morgan. He shows up when he hears that Delilah is near death. He brings along a daffy girlfriend named Buffy. Dennis Patrick and Anne Meacham play the other two sibs. Will Geer (Grandpa Walton) makes an appearance as a cousin and family attorney. One by one each sib is hacked to death in an attempt to gain the inheritance. The main suspect is the new caregiver Luddy who axed her own mother to death many years before and spent most of her adult years in an institution. If you liked Prom Night,Terror Train then you will love Dear Dead Delilah.",1108684800,,1155,4.552884615384615
7802906,2,6300147819,"I think this was the last of the ""has-been actress"" horror films
Or maybe that honor goes to ""What's The Matter With Helen"".
Warning:Spoilers
I remember watching this movie on TV when I was a kid. Then a couple of years ago I rented the video and couldn't believe how gory it was. Even though this movie came out in 1972, it's just as gory as any ""Friday the 13th"" film. A man's hand is chopped off, a guy is shot point blank in the eye with blood and brains oozing out of the socket, and a woman in a wheelchair has her head lopped off with blood spurting from the neck. It's a lousy movie and not scary at all, but the gore shocked me. Too bad this was the late, great Agnes Moorehead's last film.",1055808000,,699,4.109489051094891
7802907,2,6300147819,"Agnes Moorehead was the best supporting actress of the 40's, the 50's and the 60's in americans movies. She played in more than 60 films such as ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Magnificents Ambersons"", ""Johnny Belinda"", ""Caged"", ""All that heaven allows"" and ""Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte"" and she was, of course, Endora the witch (Elizabeth Montgomery's mother) in the long running serie ""Bewitched"". She was nominated 5 times for Academy Award, won 2 Golden Globe, was nominated more than 10 times for Emmy Award and won the New York Critics Award in 1942... But like many very good actresses (Bette Davis in ""Wicked Stepmother"", Joan Crawford in ""Trog""...), she finished her career very sadly, in a bad horror film... ""Dear Dead Delilah"" is good only for the OK performance of Agnes Moorehead, and that it ! It's violent, sadic, very hard for a 1972 picture ! Mrs Moorehead died in 1974, two years after the release of this film. If you want to remember her beautiful career, don't waste your time here...",1010016000,3,994,4.852941176470588
