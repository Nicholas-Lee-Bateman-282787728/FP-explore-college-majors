man suppose to be married to one particular female. Why? Its a mystery considering most of the world practicing polygamy.
In addition movie very fond of rich people lives not shlob like me surviving on minimum wages.",1504224000,,335,5.222222222222222
8045729,5,B000788084,Exactly the movie which I wanted to buy. The quality of the DVD is not very good because it made from the old video cassette. Excellent service.,1381449600,,144,4.37037037037037
8045730,2,B000788084,"Although the big name here is Veronica Yip, don't expect to see much of her in this category III washout. Yes, Miss Yip gets naked, but she does it ""Yip tease"" style. Unlike Amy Yip, however, who is known for concealing her nipples in her nude appearances, Veronica does show her entire breasts--but covers up everything else. In both of her dimly lit love scenes, there are strategically placed objects hiding her crotch: a boat railing in the first as she gets fondled while standing, and a sword in the second. A couple of times she puts her hand over her bush lest you should see it. You won't see her derriere either.

Fortunately she reveals more of her wares in films such as 3 Days of a Blind Girl, Cash on Delivery, and the ultimate place to see her--Pretty Woman. But not all is lost in Hidden Desire. There's plenty of full frontal nudity on the part of other performers, especially Japanese hottie Rena Murakami, who generously showcases every intimate part of her firm, petite body.

As for plot, it's as meager as Yip's nudity: a hard-to-please man dates several women during the course of the movie and dumps every one of them. Luckily the viewer gets to see his sexual encounters with the ladies.

One scene worth mentioning occurs on the top level of a double-decker bus, where a bare-breasted babe gets felt up as the bus races through busy Hong Kong streets. Unfortunately many nicely shot moments such as this one are hopelessly marred. First, the aspect ratio is 4:3, a horizontally cropped version of the 16:9 theatrical presentation. This results in truncated images at the sides of the screen, most annoying when actors are cut in half or smaller. Moreover, image quality is horrendous. The film is grainy and dirty, sporting scratches, streaks, and blotches. Oversaturated reds predominate in a few scenes. The audio is flat and uneven. English subtitles are burned in.

Only a Rena Murakami fan would want to pick up this shoddy, overpriced disc. For Veronica Yip fans, there's not much to be gained here but Yip-teasing frustration. As for all other viewers of the genre, with the exception perhaps of the bus scene mentioned earlier, you won't see anything here that you haven't already seen in other cat III flicks. Save your money.",1302652800,,2261,4.774936061381074
