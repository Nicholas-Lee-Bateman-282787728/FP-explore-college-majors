8546117,5,B00A285UOQ,"Ok I have watched tons of these trailer collection DVDs and this one is my favorite. Plus you can get it in blu ray format. Top notch collection features my favorite trailers for infra man, stunt rock, black samurai, the list goes on and on. Plus the special features are great including commentary on each trailer that will make you laugh . Also a great behind the seens look at the Alamo film archive. And great interview with joe Dante on making trailers back in the day. I hope a part two is in the works buy now!",1386633600,2,517,4.285714285714286
8546118,5,B00A285UOQ,"This is a great selection of classic B grade movie trailers.  Each one of the trailers seem to have some wear&tear quality to them,but since this was put out by Drafthouse Films I guess they wanted a Grindhouse touch done to them. Either way the trailers are all fun to watch.",1360540800,,276,4.411764705882353
