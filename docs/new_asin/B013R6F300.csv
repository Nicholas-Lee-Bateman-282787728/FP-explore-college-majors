8728542,1,B013R6F300,Just got this and it only came with transylvania 1. Not what the description says add I wad expecting blue ray of both the 1st and 2nd hotel transylvania movies.,1451260800,,161,4.4
8728543,3,B013R6F300,Thought it was over priced for what we received .,1449619200,,49,4.0
8728544,5,B013R6F300,"I love this movie! Its great for kids and adults. It's funny and exciting. I love the actors (voices) in it as well.
I got a great value when I purchased this. I was a little disappointed with the ""activity bundle"" but it was exactly as pictured. I guess my expectations were off, but that falls on me because I was extremely excited to receive this movie. I still love the activity bundle because the items are still fun and its like a present with the DVD!
I'd recommend for all ages.",1447977600,,486,4.293478260869565
8728545,5,B013R6F300,"Such a good deal. You get the first movie and the second movie for the price of one, on blu-ray none the less! As an even greater bonus you get some coloring pages and stickers! There is also printable material you can access following the links posted above. The coloring pages and stickers are the size of the movie case. So the size of a DVD case. While small, it is still a good deal, since you are paying the price of one movie and receiving two. You will get a code sent to you in an email after your order of the first movie has shipped to purchase a pre-order of Hotel Transylvania two. The code lets you purchase the movie for free. The free movie ticket was also emailed and is a link to receive your free movie ticket. Which I had no problem using. Both movies are super cute and family friendly. The movies are appropriate for all ages, from young to old. They are also movies that are re-watchable and still as cute from the first viewings.",1446854400,2,953,4.2707182320441985

So, if you already have a Hotel Transylvania DVD, you can download ten pages of PDF file for free and print them on your color printer. This may be why some reviewers are complaining that the package only contained stickers. This may also be why Amazon has made this product temporarily unavailable due to customer complaints.

The MOVIE is worth five stars. BUT the deceptiveness of including already-free materials from the web to supposedly increase the value of the package is why I brought the score down to three stars. (One star for their deceptiveness. The average of 5 and 1 is equal to 3.)",1445817600,4,760,4.9140625
8728547,1,B013R6F300,I only received 1 dvd and stickers. I could have gotten Hotel Transylvania cheaper.,1445731200,2,83,5.0
8728548,1,B013R6F300,I returned it immediately after I opened the package. Basically I paid for 1 DVD 30$. Oh and couple of stickers.,1445040000,2,112,4.380952380952381
8728549,5,B013R6F300,"What a great value! If you have fans of this movie in your household, this is GREAT buy. I actually bought a bunch to pass around to all the kids in family and it was a BIG hit. They get some $$ off tickets to see Hotel Transylvania 2, which is exciting for them and the metallic tattoos are a HUGE hit. This is the video that sold me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8homqa2c1A

Anyway, I don't often submit reviews, but I came out looking like a hero to kids after handing these out. Good early Halloween treats :)",1444003200,4,517,4.442105263157894
