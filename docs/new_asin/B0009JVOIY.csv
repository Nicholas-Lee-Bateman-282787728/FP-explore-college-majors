8062118,4,B0009JVOIY,"This performance took place outdoors at the Opernfestspiele Sankt Margarethen. The ground is the stage and it is almost a football field in length. The set and costumes are mostly traditional. Ancient Egyptian statues are lit by a multitude of torches. The opera begins at dusk and it is completely dark by Act II. A couple spotlights illuminate the singers along with the the torches.

The vocalists are discreetly miked. All voices come thru at about the same volume no matter where they are singing from in the massive structure. The title character is Eszter Szumegi and she sings well. She shades her voice when appropriate and she has the acting skills to make a convincing Aida. Almost as fine is the Amneris of Cornelia Helfricht. The men perform satisfactorily. I detected no vocal strain in anyone. Perhaps the miking allows them to sing without having to push hard to make themselves heard in such a large venue.

Perhaps the most exciting direction involves the horses and chariots. Unlike a Met production where the horses, if any, must enter at a walk, the horses and chariots enter at a trot and often exit at a gallop. The elephants are full grown and huge. Watch as soldier dismounts on. The Sacred Dance of the Priestesses incorporates at least two dozen dancers as does the dance sequence after the Triumphal March. There is also lovely dance high on the altar by a soloist but the camera doesn't catch her well. This is truly a grand production.

On the downside is the camera work. The view shifts about every two or three seconds. The camera zeroes in on vocalists well but doesn't catch the many dancers well. I would have preferred the camera to hold a frame for a few more seconds. The orchestra is from the Nationaltheater Brunn and performs reasonably well but the brass section lacks impact in the Triumphal March. The second big dance sequence just after the Triumphal March was problematic. The choreography just didn't strike me as appropriate and the costumes were bizarre. The women wore what appeared to be halter tops and shorts.

I didn't go thru the entire score measure by measure so I can't say if there were any cuts. I can say the performance lasted 147 minutes. My CD of Aida from the Met on Sony with Levine lasts 145 minutes so if there were any cuts in the score on this DVD they were insignificant. I would not recommend this as your only DVD of Aida but if you like the opera this makes a nice second or third version.
There are no extra features.",1445558400,2,2494,4.635746606334842
8062119,5,B0009JVOIY,"This a beautifully presented and filmed outdoor festival production of Verdi's ""Aida"".

If you are looking for virtuoso arias, buy something with virtuoso soloists. These aren't bad, but they are regional artists, not the cream of the crop

If you are looking for a first-rate orchestra, a splendid ensemble company, good dancing, and spectacular pageantry, this recording is worth every dollar you will spend on it !!!

Soloists notwithstanding, this has become my favorite ""Aida"".",1361145600,2,482,5.4
8062120,5,B0009JVOIY,"I have seen many productions of Aida both in the theater and on DVD, but this one is the best. Act II is so very wonderful--great singing, dancing and scenery including elephants and many horses.",1317945600,,195,4.6
8062121,1,B0009JVOIY,"This production is the worst production imaginable.  The opera is cut by half.  The singers are paralyzingly mediocre, especially the tenor.  He hasn't learned that classifying yourself as a tenor doesn't necessarily make you one.  The costumes look as if they had been designed by fourth graders.  To top everything off, the orchestra (which appears seriously reduced) is crammed into a mini-temple on the side.  A total joke!  Purchasing it is a waste of money; watching it is a waste of time.  I wondered if any other operas butchered at this so-called festival have been recorded.  I could only imagine what they would do with a work of real quality, i.e. Wagner.  The thought has me already breaking out in a cold sweat.",1293321600,,725,4.821138211382114
8062122,2,B0009JVOIY,"They have spared nothing insofar as the sets, costumes and such are concerned. In fact, caricaturisation or not, the effect is good.
The video has been shot very well, is clear and crisp and does at no point of time show any lack of detail. Excellent, I would say. Kudos to the cameramen and production people.
The voices, although not well known, are quite adequate for the roles and I could detect very few hiccups.

Why then, just two stars?

To begin with, bad sound engineering. These guys may be good recording in halls, but I think they have a lot to learn while recording and post production for the open air. The orchestra sounds detached or too thin in the soft passages and overpowering the voices in the loud ones. A sense of balance in the treatment of brasses is quite evident too. I am sure it was just great when people were watching it live, but in the DVD, it flops miserably.

The ballet... less said about it the better. It is just next to pathetic, both choreography as well as dancing. The costumes in the Triumphant march ballet is more ideally suited to the Eurotrash that we see sometimes in the so called minimal modernistic productions. The dancers are dressed like they are going to do a BDSM right after the event. Actually they kind of do it to a 'beautiful' boy/man who is just as confused and lost as the dancers are. He is sacrificed anyway at the end of the dance.
The dance director was confused as to whether he should introduce Egyptian motifs (which he does not) or European (which again he does not). It is a kind of fusion between Greek, French and Broadway at various times. The result is an unattractive hotchpotch.
I would any day sit back and see a production of this on the DVD from say, the Met or La Scala. At least those fellers know from experience how to record a piece and definitely have better directors and choreographers.
Unfortunately, it is rather harsh on the singers, all of them, who did a neat job. A lot of money spent is all I can infer. Wonder who the funders were...",1283817600,2,2031,4.454301075268817
8062123,4,B0009JVOIY,"Every summer there is a opera presented in an open air quarry in St. Margarethen, Austria.  In 2004 the opera was Aida.  There was a huge set and cast including horses and 3 elephants.  I thought the singing and conducting was excellent.  I was disappointed that the orchestra was pint sized and the trumpets really let us down in the triumphal scene.  Also, the ballet, where girls in swimsuits sacrifice a cute blond boy in a bikini, is best forgotten.  But a very stirring third and fourth act left me with quite a positive impression.  Excellent audio and video, also.",1150934400,9,572,4.66
