7800996,3,1890228605,"Moon over Tao is a film that is going to leave the viewer wondering what did they just watch? It starts as a period piece for the first thirty minutes then three alien women in enviro-suits show up. All three are actually played by one actress, Yuko Moriyama, and didn't realize that until the credits. Kudos to the make up artists on that one. The women are here to capture the alien monster Makaraga, who was encased in a metal sphere and buried on a moon. The moon blew up and the sphere eventually landed on Earth. The warlord Kakugyo has his blacksmith make swords that can cut through rock with the meteorite ore. The sphere is now just a small lump that is actually the monster. The heroes of the story are Suikyo, a calligrapher and staff-master who once served as military advisor to Hayate's lord. Hayate is a samurai tasked by his lord to find the source of these new swords. Renge is a teenage girl they meet along the way and joins them. The film has lots of WHAT? moments and is definitely B-level material. The monster awakens when blood touches it, grows to thirty feet tall, and rampages about the bandits village. Directed by Keita Amemiya this 2001 film is only for those that don't mind wasting ninety minutes on cheap SF material. Paid $12 but seriously don't pay more than $5.",1386288000,,1298,4.504237288135593

7800998,3,1890228605,"There are glowing reviews of this film, and I would suggest caution before you rush out and buy this particular DVD. Rent it first. This is one of those types of films that may not appeal to many viewers. ""Moon Over Tao"" is not a bad film, but it is not a very good film either. Once again, rent it first. This fantasy film was directed by Keita Amemiya in the late 1990s. The film centers around a warring clan which happens to make swords out of a meteor which landed on earth. This meteor has properties which enable the clan to produce powerful swords from it. Therefore, a swordsman and a monk are sent to find out where these swords are being made.

Inside the meteor there is a powerful weapon, and guess who's looking for it? Yep, the aliens from another world. The film is set in medieval Japan, therefore you have a samurai sci-fi: Which is appealing in itself. The swordsman and the monk come across a young girl who tells them of three alien warriors who are all women. They are: Abira, Marien, and Kutzo, which are all portrayed by (Yuko Moriyama). There is a falling out between these aliens, and the girl is given a bell by one of the survivors which can control the evil inside the meteor. The evil is an alien monster: Makaraga.

This film is interesting, and will appeal to some viewers, therefore, I do not wish to discourage others from viewing the film. I liked it when it first came out, however, after viewing it again last night, it did not seem to hold up too well over time. One of the pluses in the film is the portrayal of the swordsman Hayate (Hiroshi Abe), and the monk Suikyou (Toshiyuki Nagashima), I thought there performances were very good. Not that a film such as this is what viewers are looking for. However, it is always a plus in any film.

Moreover, for a very low budget film, the action is pretty good and very well done. Therefore, if you don't mind silly, weird and just plain fun in a film you will probably enjoy the film. I have seen this film going for much less at many of the Asian video stores that I purchase my films from,  than the price listed here on amazon. However, if you decide to purchase this film, do not go into the film expecting a great film. It is average at best. But once again, it will appeal to some. I do recommend however that you rent it first. And if you're into monster flicks, then the evil monster inside the meteor, MAKARAGA, will not disappoint those of the genre.

7800999,4,1890228605,"How's this for a combination?  Samurai, sorcery and sci-fi?  Well, that's what's in store for you if you check out Moon Over Tao-Makaraga.

It is the Sengoku-jidai, or the Period of the Warring States, sometime during the 16th century, in Japan.  Lord Tadaoki, a player in the game to take control of Japan, sends his former military advisor Suikyo, now a hermit-priest/sorcerer who has come down from the mountains, to seek out the source of a sword made out of ""a special, superior kind of steel.""  He is accompanied by Hayate, Tadaoki's laconic chief samurai.

Their quest takes them through the woods, where they meet Renge, a plucky self-reliant young girl armed only with a dagger given her by her late grandfather.  Together, they track down the source of the sword's steel to a cold-blooded archenemy of Suikyo who wants nothing more than ""a power strong enough to place absolute fear into the hearts of men.""

And what is the Makaraga?  Without giving anything away, Renge says it best:  ""something that is never to be used.""  And the Tao is a gun-like device with a yin-yang motif.

The battle scenes are great but the blood spills like wine (or should that be sake?) in many scenes.  Suikyo comes through as a reliable fighter whose main weapon gives a new meaning to the phrase, ""the pen is mightier than the sword.""  The recurring music theme is contemporary light drum machines with a violin that comes in, and helps set the atmosphere.

Toshiyuki Nagashima gets a big-up, playing Suikyo as someone with a dignified, compassionate nature, a great contrast to the gruff and rough Hayate.

Yuko Moriyama (Iria in the Zeiramu movies) has a triple role as Abira, Marien, and Kuzto, the three aliens who have tracked the Makaraga to Earth, and the makeup between the three are different enough that one forgets she's playing all of them.

However, Sayaka Yoshino is appealing as the pre-teen/early teen Renge.  Her shorts and high boots give the same eye-opening sensation like Silvana Mangano's outfit in Bitter Rice.

Roots of this movie include the usual samurai movies, but Suikyo is a variation of Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the aliens bug-like helmets reminded me of either Zuckuss or 4-LOM in Empire Strikes Back.  Their suits are clearly based on SCUBA gear.  And Renge's statement about the Makaraga hints to Japan's being the only country to have experienced nuclear devastation.  An interesting twist on the samurai movie.",1157673600,3,2435,4.902200488997555
7801000,5,1890228605,"Moon Over Tao is samurai science fiction.  On a quest for the source of a magical sword Suikyo, a warrior monk, and Hayate, a samurai, meet Renge, a young girl.  At night she sees lights in the sky and witnesses the landing of three alien women, all played by Yuko Moriyama.  An evil stone (the Makaraga) has crashed on the Earth and fallen into the hands of Kakugyo, a dark priest.  The Aleans seek to recover the stone but they are not in agreement about what to do with it and have a falling out.
In the meantime Suikyo, Hayate, and Renge seek a bandit hideout whre the swords came from.  By a twist of fate, the swords were made from the meteoric metal that protected the Makaraga on its trip through space.  Thus, everyone converges on Kakugyo as he works his plans for conquering Japan.  Renge bears a secret weapon - the Tao - a gift from one of the alien women who died of her wounds in Renges arms.
There is quite a bit more to the story that is surprisingly rich for an action film.  Amemiya spends a great deal of attention to making the setting a believable 16th century Japan, and then overlays a science fiction flavor, and does this without sounding a false note.  Character development gets a surprising amount of attention.  Of course there's plenty of sword fighting and flying parts.  All of these compontents are carefully balanced.
Of the three major Kieta Amemiya films, Moon over Tao has become my favorite.  Admittedly, It lacks the space opera silliness of Zeiram II, and the non-stop special effects of Kakaider.  But on the plus side is the well crafted plot plot and believable acting.  For those of us who like special effects, there's magical spellwork, alien costumes, and a superb monster.  Amemiya demonstrates that, given the necessary resources, he can produce a superior product.",1087344000,4,1815,4.64576802507837

7801002,4,1890228605,"Moon Over Tao is yet another Sci Fi film by Ketia Amemiya staring Yuko Moriyama and it's a good one at that.

The film starts when a Shogun assigns the task of aquiring some extremely powerful swords to a samurai, Sir Hayate, and a wondering monk, Suikyo.  The swords happen to be in the hands of a group of bandits run by Lord Kakugyo, who can also use magic.  On their journey, they rescue a young girl named Renge, who happens to be an orphan living on her own in a forest.  Prior to meeting the two men, Renge is given a device by an alien female, which is used to stop a creature called the Makaraga.

The three eventually make it to the bandits hideout where they battle the bandits, as well as the Makaraga.  They also have a showdown with Lord Kakugyo.  The three are aided by two different aliens played by Yuko Moriyama.  In fact, there are three aliens in the film, all of whom are played by Yuko Moriyama.  However, the aliens are in a dispute over the use of the Makraga as a weapon on their own world and are also in battle with one another.  I'll let you find out the rest of the story when you see the film.

Moon Over Tao is an excellent balance between a Samurai film, and a Sci Fi film.  There are tradtional Samurai battles, as well as some B movie special effects which come across well.  Ketia Amemiya creates an intersing world and adds some nice action scenes between both the humans, and the creature.  Yuko Moriyama does a nice job of playing all three aliens.  They are easily distinguished by threir hair styles.  And the film is shot in a way that dosn't make it confusing.  The film also has a catchy soundtrack which is a cross between modern and traditonal Japanese music.  (Unlike any soundtrack I've heard) To be fair I will say that the creature looks a little strange at times, due to some lower grade CGI effects, but not every film can be a Hollywood budgeted film.  Once you get used to it, it's not a big deal.

Tokyo Shock is the release company on this film, and they have both Japanese and English dubbed language tracks on the disc.  The English version is actually pretty good. But that is about the extent of the special features, except for some trailers of other films.

Overall I would say this is one of my favorite Japanese films, due to the freshness of the story and the creativity of the film.  (A nice break from Hollywood releases)  The film got a 4 only becuase the begining of the film was a tad bit slow.(a minor inconvienence though)

If you're into films outside the scope of Hollywood, Samurai films, or Sci Fi Films, give Moon Over Tao a try.  It's worth a watch, and in my case, it was worth buying.",1069286400,9,2663,4.329292929292929

7801004,4,1890228605,"I first saw ""Moon Over Tao"" at a screening in Hollywood, with  director Keita Amemiya present, and boy was it a good time.  A fast-paced,  exciting action film, with some darn cool fight scenes, and good  performances from all its leads, particularly Yuko Moriyama of the Zeram  series, Hiroshi Abe of Orochi the Eight-Headed Dragon, and Yukijiro Hotaru  of the Zeram series and the 90s Gamera triolgy.  The effects aren't  perfect, but they're pretty cool.",968803200,,457,5.0
7801005,4,1890228605,"""Moon over Tao--Makaraga"" has everything... a spell-casting monk, a hard-bitten samurai, and a plucky roguish girl sidekick on a quest to stop an evil sorcerer and uncover the secret behind a magical sword; a  pair of superpowered, sexy alien women on a quest to retrieve a weapon  forged by their hyper-advanced culture before the evil sorcerer uses it;  and a giant rampaging monster that threatens to destroy Earth if our heroes  can't stop it.
I'm not much for having bizarre monsters like the one here  in live-action movies (hence the 4-star rating), but everything else in the  flick is perfect! The script is well-crafted, featuring excellent pacing,  interesting characters, and witty dialogue. The fight scenes are equally  well-staged. This film also does quite well in the special effects  department... which is where many Asian films fall down when compared to  American standards. Heck, even that goofy giant monster is tolerable  because of the well-done costuming and animation work. The cinematography  was also well above average for what I have come to expect from this kind  of movie. Last, but far, far from least, ""Moon over Tao"" sports  an excellent cast of actors. Everyone gives top calibre performances, even  the woman playing the aliens... a remarkable feat since she hardly shows  any emotion. She radiates presence, though.
""Moon over  Tao--Makaraga"" is a fine merging of several Japanese film genres and  well worth a look. It features *some* graphic violence, just enough to earn  it an R rating--I don't recall anything beyond what I've seen in  ""slasher flicks""--so it's probably not appropriate for  kids.
Oh, one final note... this film was directed by Keito Amemiya, who  (according to the liner notes) also directed the ""Zeriam"" films.  If you've seen those and enjoyed them, you should definately pick up this  one. I for one did not even know that ""Zeriam"" had been made into  live-action features... all I'm familiar with are the ""Iria--Zeriam:  The Animation"" series.",950832000,6,2010,5.145510835913313
