8110395,5,B000EHT5NW,This is the most complete documentary on the topic that I have even seen.  I like the details on the Celts of the time and the battles details. The disk arrived quickly and in good condition.,1494028800,,191,4.305555555555555

8110398,2,B000EHT5NW,"I read a short story about Boudicca in the book THE BOOK OF LOVE by Kathleen McGowan. I wanted to find out more about her so I bought the video.  It was very poorly made, there are ways to create a documentary so it's interesting.  Donated it to the library",1374624000,2,257,4.12
8110399,4,B000EHT5NW,"I found this programme more convincing than many of its kind, for the very reason that the previous reviewer seems to dislike it.  It is not a fault not to take sides even if one is led by a woman who is also Celtic.  No matter how romantic the images that that combination may evoke all it amounts to is material for a romance.

I did not find the argument pro-roman.  In fact it expressly endorses a judgement at the end that the whole episode was a disgrace to all concerned, in human terms.  The presentation of the maps is merely a matter of taste, I can't say it bothered me either way because the narrative was convincing.  History is rarely pretty - what is of the greatest importance in studying history is to avoid the mistake of seeing things in terms of easy answers, of goodies and baddies.  This programme steers clear of this trap, whilst suggesting an interesting insight into which power group may have been pulling the strings behind this challenge to the great Roman Empire.",1194134400,15,993,4.5139664804469275
8110400,2,B000EHT5NW,"There have a been few Boudica specials and one film in the past few years.  This one, Boudicca - Warrior Queen has the distinction of being the only pro-Roman one of the lot.  While most are subtle in their pro-Celt, pro-woman stance, this one is open and clear about the positive effect of the Roman eradication of the Druids on Ynis Mon and the Romanization of the native British. At one point it calls Catus Decianus ""far from a coward"", when every other account (even Tactius, the Roman historian agrees that his fleeing to Gaul was out of fear) call him just that, and dismisses Catus' role in the beating of Boudica and the rape of her daughters.  A final point of its pro-Roman appeal is that it suggests that the beatings and rape of Boudica and her family was a story used by a Druid conspirsicy to stage a revolt against the Romans.  The narrater then states simply that whatever the reason, the British were better off after the decimation of the druids because the Roman brutality couldn't compare with the bloody nature of their own native religons and traditions.

The other great failure is in presentations.  Unlike the vast majority of historical specials, this one stayed clear of living re-creations and maps, and instead used historical-like art (not original artwork but art done for the show that looked ""old"".) The few costumed recreations were of the major Roman figures (see the above point).

The History Channel recently did a ""Warrior Queen Boudica"" special.  The two could easily be confused by title but the History Channel one was far more entertaining and less biased.",1168473600,52,1600,4.792727272727273
