8749114,5,B01B2LTMEA,"This film dating from 1982, has for many years enjoyed something of a cult status. It explores, amongst other issues, the relative roles and inequality experienced by women in the workplace even when cast in starring film roles. It even does this through cross gender casting and, in this, the performance by Dustin Hoffman is little short of extraordinary offering both compulsive viewing and serious humour - not as contradictory as one might imagine.

However, this review is not intended to discuss the actual film as by now it will have both its supporters and detractors. Entering into those conflicts is not the purpose of the review which is aimed squarely at the many supporters of this film.

Essentially, for all of those who are keen supporters of this film and who have bought the previous DVD version of this disc, the only issue of vital importance will be whether the Blu-ray offers an improvement technically sufficient to justify the additional expense.

For this reviewer the answer is a clear affirmative. The upgrade offers a clear advance on both image and audio quality with the imaging being a marked improvement. The colours are firmer and there is an increase to the perceived depth of the imaging. The whole film simply becomes more 'real.' The film, which is so concerned with close characterisation, benefits considerably from this enhancement of reality even if that is not likely to be a real reality - at least one hopes not!

The degree of improvement experienced from this BD will also inevitably depend on the replay equipment used.

The screen used for this review is only of moderate dimensions being a 40 inch television screen. However, the television is a high performing 4K unit which delivers a compensating positive effect. The moderate screen size lacks the impact of larger screens but is less critical of film faults.

However, the contributing player is, unusually, able to separate the audio and visual signals before they leave to both the television and pre-amp. That feature enhances both the visual and audio elements of the output. The audio, not so critical in the case, delivers an unusually wide-ranging and revealing performance as one would expect from a musician. Its precision is equally revealing of film scores.

Readers with alternative equipment will have to interpret this review bearing in mind their own equipment and its comparative advantages and disadvantages.

The disc offers purchasers with suitable replay equipment a substantial improvement over the previous DVD

In summary this BD is a transfer from good quality 1982 film stock and has responded well to the upgrade and well worth considering",1474070400,,2670,5.077625570776256
