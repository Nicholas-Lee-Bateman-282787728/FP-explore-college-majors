7004485,5,B00TDWD0GM,"LOVED THIS MOVIE, it stayed TRUE to it's genre. Great script and actors who fit and worked very well together. Great directing that made sure everything kept moving and NEVER lagged. There was about two scenes where after breakup's ( not with one another ) the two leads were shown down & out; ( the scene lasted less than a minute, ) the guy was sitting on the couch with his room-mate in his boxers and had a scruffy beard watching t v. The other scene with the girl after the break-up was laying on the bed crying and sobbing w/ a pile of used tissue laying nearby, ( again this lasted less than a minute ). Following scenes showed them back up functioning and going on with their JOBS. This is a TRUE ROMANTIC COMEDY. If you are a true fan of this type of movie I PROMICE YOU, you will not be disappointed.",1434758400,,810,4.232258064516129

7004487,1,B00TDWD0GM,"This movie makes no sense.  You will be sitting their wondering in what world is there a Dog psychologist?  Why do women need to pay other woman to keep men away?  Is he really a great wing man or just a decent human being? None of these scenarios make sense or are believable.  All the lines are there to drive the plot or present exposition, or are dumb and cliche, none of the characters feel like people.  The plot itself doesn't work, why would it bother someone that he a match maker?  There was no manipulation, all the people who bought his service were there to pick up chicks, and he didn't trick any woman in to doing something they didn't want to do.  The story is Hitch done wrong.  If you want to watch a movie like this that's tons better just go see Hitch.",1430956800,2,772,4.239726027397261

Some movies start well and then die out after 20-30 minutes, this one saves the best for last.  Money well spent!",1428710400,2,246,4.674418604651163
7004493,4,B00TDWD0GM,Wingman is a funny flick with a little bit of everything for everybody. It has a little romance for the ladies and some crude (but not too crude) jokes for the men. Overall a very funny romantic comedy with some clever writing. You'll definitely get some laughs out of it.,1428624000,3,272,4.46

8701264,5,B00TDWD0GM,"This is a low budget movie that is intended to be light hearted and funny to cheer you up. I see all these negative reviews and I think people miss the point of the movie is not to be deep and realistic. Its a romantic COMEDY. Its only intended to make you laugh and cheer you up. That being said, I have studied pickup from professionals and its weird but there were quite a few things subtly presented in the movie, if you know what to look for, that are actually true. It teaches about frame control, s*** tests, going with her energy, creating abundance, and many other principles that are consistent with guys who understand pickup. I remember first watching this when very depressed last year over relationships. It cheered me up. A year later I am in the most meaningful relationship of my life with a kid on the way. Erin Cahill was beautiful and sexy. The supporting male roles were optimistic and funny. The lead male role was meant to be a goofy, hopeless dork who ends up becoming successful and ""gets the girl"" in the end by being himself.  I give it the max: 5 stars and recommend it to anyone searching for a better dating life.",1478131200,,1143,4.4170616113744074

8701271,3,B00TDWD0GM,"Dr. Robert Tompkins aka Bobby (Kristopher Turner) is a dog psychologist. His girlfriend recently broke up with him. He has three roommates, a ton of debt, and a business that is not doing that well. What Bobby does have is a way to talk to the ladies which result in gratifications for his friends. His friends decide to turn his talent into a business. Bobby meets Kristy (Erin Cahill) who gets paid to keep predatory males away from women who go out and want to have fun. Neither one knows what the other one does.

The film is predictable and cliche. What it is not, is a teen sex comedy. There are no gratuitous nude scenes. The sex scenes are off camera. I don't recall any F-bombs, although the language was very sexual including C-block and Dirty San... The main problem with the film is not the overly predictability aspect, but the fact the jokes didn't work that well. It is situational comedy that needed a laugh track.",1435968000,,930,4.535714285714286
