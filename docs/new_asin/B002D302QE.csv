8364737,5,B002D302QE,I bought this DVD solely because of Michael Shanks playing a lead...but even without him in it I would have loved this movie.,1262822400,8,125,4.478260869565218
8364738,4,B002D302QE,"I was so frustrated tying to find the movie and watch it so when I did finally find part of the movie I was very happy. In this film Michael Shanks stars as a fantastically handsome school counsellor who's very down-to-earth and natural. The story unfolds with laughs mingled with the requisite tradgey and though I am leery of afterlife apparitions it seemed to blend enough that you could appreciate the sorrow and also the frustration of the boy and his mother who do a remarkable job for the production. I recommend this film for a light, sweet encounter with Shanks who's the all-star and have a pleasantly sci-fi free evening.",1251417600,34,632,4.702702702702703
