Upon receiving my 2014 Fiesta Bowl game DVD, I was excited to relive the historic UCF win. When I played the DVD, I was VERY disappointed at the video quality. I obviously didn't expect HD broadcast quality, but this isn't even DVD quality video. The picture is very pixelated and not crisp at all. To be honest, this looks like something I would view on YouTube.

I give it 2 stars because it's watchable. But this is NOT the quality I would expect on a memorabilia item like this.",1393200000,5,571,4.438095238095238
