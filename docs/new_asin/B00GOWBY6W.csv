8625731,5,B00GOWBY6W,"The Boeing 767 received it's type certificate from the FAA on July 22, 1983. For more than thirty years now it has been an airline workhorse and is primarily responsible for the ETOPS qualifications that have revolutionized the use of the big twin engine jet aircraft, especially in operations over the North Atlantic. It has successfully demonstrated that four engines on jet aircraft are not required for safety purposes. I have enjoyed three particular flights in this category; an AA flight from Miami to Madrid, an AA flight from San Juan to Los Angeles, and a KLM flight from Amsterdam to Houston, all of which were completely satisfactory and uneventful, though none was as lengthy as many twin engine flights today. This video is so interesting to me in seeing the pilot's showing the instruments as this aircraft had one of the earliest uses of the ""glass"" cockpit though it was limited in it's initial configuration. I have an extensive collection of Just Planes videos and the Air Canada productions tend to be some of the better ones.",1478304000,3,1046,4.882022471910112
