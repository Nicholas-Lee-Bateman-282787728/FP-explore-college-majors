8222705,5,B000WCUWPO,"Absolutely one of my favorite series in the history of mankind.  They do stuff in this show that you're like, ""Wait.  You're not allowed to do that on television?!""  The writing is top notch.  The acting is top notch.  The editing is unreal it is so good.  The score is amazing.  I wish I could give it eleven stars!",1404604800,,316,4.254237288135593
8222706,3,B000WCUWPO,"I wasn't planning to write a review of Green Wing, but it seems I am not going to be able to sleep until I do. First, let me start by saying this is a weird show. I have no problem with weird. There were a lot of things I enjoyed -- enough to keep me watching through almost 20 hours of television in the hope of a satisfying resolution -- but there were other things that pretty much ruined the show for me.

There is one warning I think is important to give to anyone who has not seen this show: There is an episode in which one major character explicitly sexually assaults another, and not only do the writers of the show treat it as a ""funny"" joke, but the perpetrator never suffers any consequences for their actions. Consider yourself warned.

I really liked Mac and Caroline. Both characters clearly cared for their friends and for the feelings of others. They are proof that the writers *know* what constitutes decent behaviour in a human being. They are both framed as sympathetic protagonists.

I had pretty much decided within the space of the first episode that Guy was The Worst. He is the kind of jerk who is always chasing tail, and never cares about the feelings or interests of a woman except insofar as expressing interest will get him laid. He's shallow and self-centered, and even the small moments of positive character development he gets do not redeem him. Worse, his bad behaviour is consistently rewarded. Mac continues to be a better friend than he deserves, never giving him more than mild or joking rebukes; Martin, who is otherwise a pretty decent guy, idolises him and tries to emulate his behaviour towards women; and Caroline agrees to become engaged to him, even knowing all the terrible things he has done, many of them directly to her. I have known and dealt with too many men like Guy in real life to find his antics amusing. But for Sue White, he would have taken the title of The Worst easily.

I actually really liked Sue at the start. She was wacky and unpredictable. She was a complete troll and sociopath, but in an entertaining way. However, she was stalking Mac. No matter how many times he brushed her off or treated her with indifference, she continued to pursue him, even going so far as to commit acts of violence against those whom she saw as coming between them. And then, while Mac was in a coma, she sneaked into his hospital room and committed an act of sexual assault in order to impregnate herself. Which is apparently a hilarious joke because it's a woman raping a man, don't you see? Part of the reason why I hung on to the end of the show was in the hope that some sort of justice would be done, but no one, including Mac, ever found out what she had done. She suffered no consequences for her actions whatsoever.

I am so angry at the writers for portraying sexual assault as a joke. When these kinds of things are portrayed in print and on the screen, I believe in giving them their proper names. Sue raped Mac. It happened. It's part of the canon of this show, and it should not be ignored or dismissed. At least in the cases of manslaughter on the show, the characters acknowledged the seriousness of their actions and expected to suffer consequences for them. It was pretty gross, though, the way one of the victims was utterly dehumanised due to his dwarfism.

Did I come away from the show with anything positive? I suppose I did. It's nothing new, but there was a reminder that the things that are worth having in life are worth some risk. If one doesn't try to have the love that one wants because one is scared of looking foolish or being rejected, one might miss one's chance at happiness. A good message, certainly, but too little too late.",1362182400,11,3710,4.472673559822748
8222707,4,B000WCUWPO,"Green Wing is a ""quirky"" comedy series that ran on Channel 4 between 2004 and 2006, consisting of two series of 9 and 8 60minute episodes respectively and a one-off special (not included here).

The series is set in a hospital and follows the fraught and often tortuous relationships of the various employees and their fractured character traits. The series covers a lot of ground and a brief synopsis is almost impossible, but the two highlight plot arcs are:

= An ""on-off"" love triangle between the three surgeons, Caroline Todd, Guy Secretan and Mac MacCartney, (Greig, Manganand Rhind-Tutt) and the attempts of the monumentally wet student doctor Martin (""Fartin"") Dear (Karl Theobald) to break into the triangle and win Todd's affections.

= A rather unconventional love interest between the pompous, stuttering and deeply disturbed radiologist Dr Alan Statham (Mark Heap) and the aging, insecure but sexually aggressive administrator Joanna Clore (Pippa Haywood).

The series relies for its humour on peurile, eccentric, extreme or even surreal behaviour of the protagonists and for the most part it works with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments interspersed with fair doses of ""cringe comedy"" and less extreme forms of amusement.

If I'm honest, though, the concept is sarting to wear by the second series and while the humour remains it seems to be taking second place to the somewhat soapy relationships themselves (by the special, I became a little tired of the whole thing). Some of the surreality goes a little too far and Sue White, the Scottish staff liaison officer played by Michelle Gomez failed to raise a single laugh. Overall, however, this is a great example of good British Channel 4 comedy (a genre in itself, I think) and well worth the expense and effort.

I have to say, though, that the one shining star throughout is of course Mark Heap's wonderful performance as Alan Statham and, if other story arcs or characters are losing a little of their comic gloss, you can be sure that Heap will get you rolling on the floor, breathless with laughter. You can hardly call such a parodical character ""well observed""; I think that ""fine tuned"" is probably a better description. Credits also go to Olivia Colman who plays the disorganised and absent minded admin office worker - a far gentler comic performance.

8222708,5,B000WCUWPO,"Having watched the entire series almost twice through now, I can safely say that I wish more American comedies were as inventive and gutsy as Green Wing.  It takes a couple of episodes to really get going, but once you get into the story I promise you won't be able to stop watching to find out what happens next.

Although Scrubs is the show Green Wing gets compared to most often, I'd say the only real similarity is that both are set in a hospital - but that's where the comparison ends.  Where Scrubs definitely has elements of the surreal, Green Wing takes it to a whole other level. There's also zero concern for political correctness here - however zany or inappropriate something may be, this show just goes for it.  What other show can make murder, incest and cannibalism (among other things) hilariously funny?  The story of Green Wing is really how these bizarre characters relate to each other - and that, I think, is where its genius lies.  There's very little medicine discussed and there's nary a sick patient in sight - there are a good number of surgery scenes but it's largely a showcase for how Mac, Caroline and Guy (the three elements of the story's central love triangle) play off each other.  The humor here veers between the over-the-top ridiculous and the cleverly subtle, and is so well-written that despite these characters' foibles and quirks and occasional downright nasty behavior, there's enough pathos and emotional turmoil there to make you genuinely care about them.  A perfect example is Guy, who we find out actually does have a heart despite being thoroughly (and hilariously) smarmy.  Very few shows today can have you saying ""eewww!"" and squirming uncomfortably at certain scenes while laughing your butt off at the same time. That said, this is probably not something you want to watch with the kiddies, or with particularly uptight relatives in the room, but if you've got a wicked sense of humor and an appreciation for the absurd, this will be right up your alley.  The camera work and music are also of note - while they may seem a bit odd at first, once you get a couple of episodes in they really add to the story and the humor.

On a side note, if you're fans of Stephen and Tamsin (Guy and Caroline), (and really, who wouldn't be after watching this?) I'd also suggest Episodes (their current show together) or Black Books (for more Tamsin).  The entire cast here are some incredibly funny, talented folks.",1321920000,,2454,4.707943925233645
8222709,5,B000WCUWPO,"The complete Green Wing includes every episode, plus extras, from this amazingly funny and creative BBC Channel 4 series.  Hi-lights of the extras: cast & staff commentary is entertaining & illuminating and some of the deleted scenes are beyond belief.  Only two complaints about this collection: it's still not available in Zone 1 (US) format, and saddest of all, it ends.  In my opinion, Green Wing is both profoundly & disturbingly funny and at the same time powerfully moving.  Nothing else like it.",1304208000,2,503,5.024096385542169

8222711,5,B000WCUWPO,"Top to bottom, amazing, hilarious show.  Its like scrubs, but it's not sappy, and 10x as funny.  Dr. Statham is one of the funniest characters in any show in the history of T.V.

How can you not love a sitcom with... *SPOILER*

hilarious instances of murder, incest, and cannibalism?

*END SPOILER*

Great show, watch it now, you will not be disappointed.",1293926400,2,355,4.737704918032787
8222712,5,B000WCUWPO,Found this on Hulu and now am getting the set.  I should hate this show because its often offensive and awkward but unlike other shows that rely on shock factor this show makes every topic hilarious.  Pretty much constant sidesplitting humor and perfectly mixes physical comedy with verbal and the absurd with intelligent writing. Over the top in ever way without going too far. Love it.,1287187200,,387,4.848484848484849
8222713,5,B000WCUWPO,"Lovely, sexy, gloriously outrageously funny, I have watched GW over and over and nearly always see something new. Would like to have known the special was included in this set, but the set and extras are marvelous!~ I was able to watch it on US computer easily.",1259193600,5,261,4.574468085106383
8222714,5,B000WCUWPO,"A few years ago BBC had aired Green Wing.  After watching a few episodes, I fell in love. I had recorded four episodes and watched them repeatedly till  i dropped the tape in a bucket of water. Least said, that was the begining to my search to replace my Green Wing.
  BBc America had aired the first season of Green wing, and litterly left me with a cliff hanging ending.
  Thanks to Amozon.com I got the two season disc set at a great price.  And am now enjoying episodes that I have not seen.

Thanks  M.E.Pyle",1249516800,3,513,4.260416666666667
