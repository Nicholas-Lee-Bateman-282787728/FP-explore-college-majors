8525006,5,B0009XRZT2,"This is a really nice collection of documentaries on several people who helped shape the 20th century. It focuses on kindness, compassion, forgiveness, charity, and social giving rather than war and aggression. I used this for a bible study class and it fit well with the themes we were discussing.",1366675200,,298,4.98
8525007,2,B0009XRZT2,"I have seen 2 episodes of this DVD via local data casting. I agree some of the personalities featured have had a profound effect on the last century and into the present. Most have had a focused ongoing passion dominating and guiding their lives often with a great spirit of courage and generosity.
I personally was put off by the inclusion of Mother Teresa and Pope John Paul II. I think both have done great damage to the fabric of the Roman Catholic Church. Both are identified with a conservative authoritarian view of Catholicity retreating from the opening up spirit of the Second Vatican Council. Since John Paul II's papacy liberally minded people across the world have left the official Catholic Church in droves seeing it as a backward looking voice of the past with less and less meaning in their lives. Many still adhering think the Catholic Church is a private exclusive club. Conform or get out!
I doubt, as mentioned in the program, that Mother Teresa, early in her life, had any admiration for the great past Indian civilization but was instead motivated to save and retrain souls.
I must admit I did enjoy the orchestral pieces composed for each episode. Good on you, Virginia Beach Symphony Orchestra.",1339372800,,1219,4.809523809523809
