8139117,3,B000HEVZBM,"This boxed set could have all been on one DVD and save me some storage space and money.  The entire 3 DVD set is 2:30. Volume 1 contains 2 shows from the original Def Jam in 1992 and 1993 hosted by Martin Lawrence.  There were some hilarious moments and some funny moments.  It brought back great memories of the early 90s.  Volume 2, hosted by Steve Harvey was okay and also only contained 2 shows.  Both Vol. 1 and 2 are available separately so Vol. 3 is a bonus and therefore only contains 1 show.  I was expecting 5 or 6 hours of material since it was broken into 3 DVDs.  What was I thinking?",1168387200,19,597,4.139130434782609
