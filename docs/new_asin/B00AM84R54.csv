5450351,4,B00AM84R54,"I love, love, LOVE the Avalon CD and I was very excited to purchase the live Blu Ray/DVD. (Sadly no way I could afford the special Avalon Box Set) I would note to anyone who misses the obvious - Blu Ray and DVD are sold seperately! I figured the Blu Ray would come with the DVD (so many do these days, especially in the $20 + up price range.) My bad. So I had to eventually buy both formats. Bummer - I should have paid better attention.

I really enjoyed seeing the live version of the Avalon show, especially special since it was taped in Sully Erna's hometown. Great to see the band, the interactions, the stage show, etc. There were some awesome surprises (the encore medley is a total treat!) and the overall quality of the concert recording are excellent. (No surprise that Daniel Catullo III does a good job of showing off some of what's best here. He's also directed documentaries for Godsmack so he has a great feel for quality and what a fan might want to see.)

I was hoping for more ""behind the scenes"" stuff, either the story-like introductions you often get at a concert or a bunch of added footage. Seems to be few song intros and not a lot of new footage I hadn't seen online.

My only other - admittedly picky - note would be the editing. It seems like the quick smash cuts from player to player are intended to underscore the music and add excitement for the viewer - nifty idea. However there were several times that I wished the camera would have held on folks a little longer than a blink.

Overall very much worth buying and I will enjoy repeat viewings.",1372809600,,1576,4.368600682593857

5450354,5,B00AM84R54,"Sully really out did himself on this DVD (witch is by no means is a surprise) You can tell he really dug deep and put his soul into these songs. It's so diversified, there will be at least one song that will touch everyone in some way or another. Not to mention picking the perfect ensemble to back him up. Lisa Guyers' vocals are absolutely awesome to Irina Chirkovas' flawlessly Cello playing. Even if your not a Godsmack fan you will still love this DVD. A Must Have for any music lover. You won't be disappointed. I Rate it 10 out of 10",1360281600,3,540,4.252427184466019

5450370,5,B00AM84R54,"Great performance and great looking/sounding blu-ray.  One other great thing about this disc is that it captures Lisa Guyer and other members of Mama Kicks as Sully's supporting band.

5450373,5,B00AM84R54,"Great show at the Wilbur Theatre in Boston! There was a great vibe in the the theatre...front row seats made it even better! I never knew that Sully played piano. I knew that he played drums, and sang, of course, but I was impressed when he tickled the ivories of the baby grand. It was awsome to see live. Now I have a Disc to hear and see the show again!

I have always loved the cd, so when I watched this(disc) I very much regret not getting to see it live. I would have travelled across country to see this show. AMAZING! If you are not familiar with Sully's solo cd's then you are missing out on some great music and vocals. So you know... this is nothing like Godsmack... at all. Other than his distinctive voice, this is very original and unique. I just want to say thank you to whoever is responsible for making this video possible/available.",1489449600,,578,4.411214953271028
