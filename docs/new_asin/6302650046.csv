491924,5,6302650046,by far the most imaginative animated film period.  (spirited away comes next) i watched this film when i was young and i am in college now and i love this film just as much as i did when i first saw it. this film obviously rubbed off into my life somehow because i study animation in school right now.,1042848000,,301,4.101694915254237
491925,5,6302650046,"This has been my second favorite movie for years.  It's so hilarious that even though I've watched it a hundred times I still laugh at the same parts.  It has stood the test of time and I would recommend it to everyone.  Little Nemo In Slumberland just plain kicks and it's hard to find, so I'm telling you to buy it now!",1005177600,,321,4.145161290322581
491926,4,6302650046,"It amazes me that none of the previous reviews mentions the comic by Winsor McCay!  This is truly one of the most faithful adaptions to the  ideas of any work that I have seen.  Winsor McCay would be proud.
Mickey  Rooney does a fine job as Flick, the shifty and miscievous imp.  I have  read that French artist Jean Giraud (aka Moebius), and Ray Bradbury are  both involved with this film.  It shows.
This movie has an interesting  plot, fascinating characters, and beautiful animation.  As with most good  films, there are occasional scenes which may frighten younger viewers  (anyone remember the witch from Disney's Snow White?) but do not let this  dissuade you from giving this film a try if you can find it.
My only  complaint was the superfluous character, Icarus.  At least this time the  ""cute animal"" was relatively low key and did not distract from  the rest of the film.
I hope that it is re-released post-haste!",965606400,7,925,4.68125
491927,5,6302650046,"I think this is a great movie! This movie goes pretty fast so that your always at something new and never bored, but not so fast that you can't  enjoy it. The animation of Slumberland is beutifuly made. Most animated  villians I've seen are not even really imtimidating looking but the  Nightmare King actually looked scary. The jester goblins escaping from  Nightmare Castle are adorable and funny. I really wish that they would come  out with a sequal so that we can find out what happens to Nemo when he  comes back to Slumberland.  -Julia 12",946857600,2,545,4.614583333333333
491928,5,6302650046,"I first saw this movie in the theaters when I was about eight years old, and I fell in love with it. I bought the video and six years later it is still my favorite movie. In the film, Nemo is invited to slumberland by professor Genius to be a playmate to princess Camille. There, he finds a  world of happiness, where crocodiles are friendly and carriages are pulled  by giant peacocks. After betraying King Morpheus, the king of Slumberland,  Nemo must make-up for his transgression. The characters are hillarious and  unforgettable. This movie is a must for any video collection.",945648000,2,581,4.7227722772277225

492060,5,6302650046,"Bought this movie out of nostalgia from of childhood, and enjoyed reliving the surreal adventures of Little Nemo. Then gave it to my niece and nephews, who seemed to enjoy it too. They just don't really make movies like this anymore, at least outside of certain Japanese movies. I don't know why so many modern movies baby children these days. A few dark elements of a children's story or movie is good for them, if done properly, which LIttle Nemo does. If you've never seen it, and are on the fence, check it out, especially if you have kids.",1513728000,2,544,4.505050505050505

A staple film in both mine and my sister's childhood: we watched the movie way too much, played the game, wanted a sugar glider we could name Icarus, ogled Princess Camille's dress, and yelled ""shazama pajama!"" over and over and over again...

I used to rent this movie a lot when I was younger. The animation is beautiful and detailed, the characters are likable though Nemo has been called a bland character. The only character I don't like is Flip because he is a jerk.

I watched this on YouTube and remembered the good times I had with this movie and bought it on Amazon. Despite its anime look, this film was actually a combined effort of both Japan and North America. This is also one of the few times I disagree with the Nostalgia Critic.",1411689600,,533,4.32

After reading several reviews for the DVD vs the Blu-ray version, I decided to splurge on this Blu-ray version. Mostly this was for the sake of the extras. I have yet to watch all of the bonus material, but I am glad to have it on file for when I do wish to.

Little Nemo is one of my all time favorites, with great animation and a whimsical storyline. Although the story progresses in a way that does not always make complete sense, I love it just as much as I did as a child. As an older animated film, there are certain themes that parents these days might not find kosher for younger children (a character who chain smokes cigars/is a huge troublemaker and some scenes that /may/ have given me nightmares as a kid). Nonetheless, I still believe it to be a great story and, while parents may wish to screen it before deciding when their kids are old enough to watch, one that should be shared to newer generations.",1408406400,5,1029,4.276923076923077

I hope this review helps others out there in making a choice. It's not a movie I could turn on for my children, and go about my business like My Neighbor Totoro or Mary Poppins.

492857,5,6302650046,"I thought I'd chime in because all of the reviews are still for the DVD (I hate that Amazon does this mixture). This is a must own blu-ray if you have any appreciation for this movie. Let me tell you why:

- You finally get stuff that was only on the ephemeral Japanese DVD which goes for about $250 now. This most notably includes the two pilot films produce by a couple of directors. They are basically short films in themselves not looking much like the movie or following the story, but charming in their own right.

- It has the making of stuff from the laserdisc. These aren't that great though since it just focuses on the writers and voice actors of the movie, which were the great failings here. It would be nice if any of those features had given credit to the animators or their process, but no dice. This movie apparently has a long troubled history with rotating staff and joint efforts from a Japanese and U.S. studio. I hope someday we might get a nice big history book here.

- Finally some concept and production art! I don't know if these were on the Japanese DVD, but I have been looking for some of this stuff forever. There's a Japanese art book but there's hardly any pictures and it's mostly storyboards, so this Blu-ray has a lot of new great stuff. I don't think it  has the Brian Froud concepts though, which I still would like to see one day.

- The Japanese dub is available for those that want to pretend that this is an anime. :)

There are a couple of downsides. The transfer could be a little bit sharper and there's some jitter, but I'm guessing Eastern Star did the best they could. I kind of wish the American opening was cleaned up and intact with the main film as the Japanese opening is just incredibly boring and long credits, but I have never seen this before so it's very interesting. The U.S. opening is still available as a special feature. Also I really wish companies would stop using this awful cover. It makes the gorgeous movie look like it will be badly drawn. The artist who did this cover was obviously inept and I wish it would disappear from circulation.

I cannot commend Eastern Star enough for finally making these special features available for the first time for U.S. audiences and putting this movie on blu-ray. Finally someone does it right after the slew of cheapo and sloppy DVD releases we've gotten through the years.",1358985600,46,2381,4.472350230414746

492859,5,6302650046,"I bought this because I had a copy of it on VHS when I was a kid. I can distinctly remember two things about this movie:
1) it scared the living daylights out of me for some weird reason (kidnapping and alternate realities just spooked me)
2) I watched it over and over and over and over again.

Eventually I got past whatever it was the scared me (I was very young the first time I saw it) and I came to appreciate it for the work of art that it is.

This movie is not your ordinary children's film.  While it is aptly suited for viewing by children it possesses a great deal of unconventional creativity for a movie in this genre.  For example, you are frequently left to wonder throughout the film whether Nemo is awake or still dreaming as there are a number of ""dream-within-a-dream"" sequences.  The plot is engaging and runs the gamut from innocent betrayal, uncertainty, and fear to wonderment, courage, and perseverance.  The film accomplishes this in a format that is both relatable to children and thought-provoking.  Little Nemo is a film you will enjoy sitting down with your children to watch.

492935,5,6302650046,"What do you get when a story from a classic comic strip gets conceptualized by a sci-fi writer, developed by the minds behind Tron, The 5th Element, the Abyss, Castle of Cagliostro, and Sherlock Hound, written by people who worked on The Goonies, Duck Tales, and Gummi Bears, animated by a Japanese staff, voice-acted by an American one, and directed by people who worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle and Initial D (with songs by the duo who made the songs from Mary Poppins? You get.... a trippy musical fantasy adventure with a plot that's Nights into Dreams combined with Inception. And it is AWESOME.

Where and What is a Dream?

This movie is almost indescribably out of joint. It starts with Nemo having an exhilarating dream, which turns into a nightmare, which ends with him waking up. From there he has a short adventure outside, and then quickly finds himself invited to Slumberland as play-mate to the Princess. From there it's a series of dreams that find Nemo jumping back and forth between the real world and the dream world as he befriends a trouble-maker, spends time with the Princess, gets declared the king's heir, and had to journey to Nightmareland to undo a terrible mistake and save the day. On the way there are random musical numbers, and multiple times Nemo wakes up to find that he's still asleep! The whole trippy, random nature of travel and awareness in this film is pure genius. Just like in a dream, you are only as far away from somewhere as you think you are (Nemo goes from an endless see back to Slumberland from waking up in moments, and journeys back into Nightmare land seemingly just by WANTING to go there, whereas shortly before a map was needed. Great stuff, when you consider he's a kid who's having a series of dreams (or is it only one REALLY long, trippy dream?).

The Nightmare (fuel) King

The jumble of styles in this animated film is just great. It literally has everything. Extreme moments of peril at random times, a Princess, a super-powered magical MacGuffin (the king's scepter), a super-silly semi-talking animal side-kick, lessons to be learned, musical numbers, and yes, a climax I would definitely call nightmare fuel for very young children (the Nightmare king would have given me nightmares as a child for sure).
The whole manages to stay pretty light-hearted throughout however, and there is no SUSTAINED danger to traumatize you hours later (like, say, the climax of Toy Story 3 that left me feeling downright DISTURBED).

Little Nemo is definitely an uneven movie, and I don't mind that much. It's flawed as well to be sure, but again, there's so much good stuff to be found that I just don't care. Flip's sole purpose is to cause trouble and give kids warnings about smoking cigars, and Icarus will doubtless drive some people insane with his squirrel-speak. For me though, those are very minor points.

""Hey, don't apologize to me. Apologize to my rat!""

This movie really needs to get WAY more recognition than it has. In addition to all the great points already mentioned, it is LOADED with breath-taking backgrounds, spectacularly fast-moving action sequences, and gorgeous animation. Truly at the pinnacle of Japanese traditional animation. The  script is also full of clever dialog, the characters are all very well developed, and the voice-acting is top notch. Heck I even like the theme song that's sung at the opening and ending of the film. There's an excellent quality of work that pervades the entire film from start to finish. If you are a fan of animation, and the high quality animation from the 80's in particular, a fan of American Anime (Japanese Animation for an American audience like Rainbow Bright, The Flight of Dragons, or The Hobbit), or just like trippy fantasy adventure, give this film a watch. I love it!",1339459200,,3794,4.817204301075269

492975,4,6302650046,"I have to admit I'm not into the  whole dvd thing too much. I have the VHS. I love this film . Its about the elaborate dream had by a little boy named Nemo after falling asleep one night. He journey's to a lovely world called slumberland and it's polar opposite the land of the nigthmare king.  He learns all about the consequences of making and breaking promises, fixing problems and taking responsibility for his own actions.

The plot is very good as is the animation and the songs The Only thing that lost this film the last star is the actions of the character named ""Flip."". While most of his actions are  Mischievious and witty, I lost my patience with him when he looked up under a woman's dress. The scene is  brief but still it's too much. This would'dve been an excellent  movie for kids were it not for that scene.

I'd have also taken another star off of this review  for flip's constant smoking had not this action been greatly disgouraged  by Nemo and Princess camille. He is sentenced to stop smoking forever by the two of them.

The nightmare King and Goblins  might be a little too scary for children in addition to the dream where King Morpheus is calling Nemo's name in a very eerie voice but I think it'll depend on the age of the child and how sensitive they are when it comes to those. The ending is wonderful  and left me  relieved, happy and  just a little sad.

492977,2,6302650046,"""Little Nemo: Adventures In Slumberland""
----------------------------------------------
This cartoon/anime adaptation of Winsor McCay's fabled newspaper strip is a bit of a letdown, at least if you grew up reading the original. It borrows many of the same ideas as the strip -- a boy named Nemo enters a fantastical land in the sleeping world, where he meets many odd characters and has some trippy adventures in his dreams. However, it adds some elements that are unfortunate: a cutesy-wootsy, slightly anthropomorphized squirrel that was not in the original is meant to provide comic relief, but is a distraction; more importantly, the big-picture story arc that the movie studio crafted feels tacked on and is kind of a bummer: instead of just moving through a sea of weird dreams, Nemo has to confront his own dark emotions and fears, and defeat a satanic, evil Lord of Nightmares, who is menacing and scary and a little too devilly for my tastes. It all seems so unnecessary, and so completely against the grain of the McCay original.

Yeah, sure, if you took some of the more anxiety-provoking scenarios in the newspaper strip seriously or literally, it would indeed seem rather scary - but ""Little Nemo"" was never about terror or peril, it was about surrealism and absurdity, and above all it was about the incredible glory and imaginative splendor of McCay's artwork.  Some of that sense of wonder is replicated here, but not enough. Instead, he see McCay's vision crammed into a boring Hollywood template of peril and triumph, whereas a more weird, experiential, episodic film, one that honored McCay's wild psychedelic fantasies would have been oh, so much cooler.  Oh, well.  We still have the print version to blow our minds.  And that version is a real treat, if you haven't read it yet. (Axton)",1301097600,3,1808,4.9933554817275745

A great old classical fantasy adventure movie I would recommend to young children And parents should pick up their credit cards and buy this movie for their young children, Trust me they will love it.",1252195200,,646,4.666666666666667

493068,4,6302650046,"I had heard that the Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland was back in print from the IMDB message boards. After making sure that it wasn't false information, I checked retailers everywhere online to make sure it's back, and sure enough, we have another release!

It's finally good to know that I don't have to worry about trying to find it anywhere at a pawn shop, or bid online for it, or even have to cash out over $30-$50 for an out of print version, but the relatively small price for the DVD is worth it!

The DVD is subtle enough and contains a nice widescreen transfer, a runtime that is well suited and NOT cut, 3 Sing-Alongs (if your into that), and a Make Your Own Royal Scepter.

It's good to see the film I enjoyed so much as a child has come back to DVD, and I can enjoy the fantasy and fun back on DVD without having to worry about every paying a high price for an Out of Print version. Definitely recommended if you love the film! This will be the best way for you to view it for now.",1235347200,3,1001,4.176165803108808
493069,5,6302650046,"REVIEWER'S NOTE: This review was written in 2009 for the DVD version of Little Nemo released that year. Please be aware that Amazon -- as usual -- has ported ALL the old reviews over to listings for newer editions of the film on both Blu-ray and DVD, and which may differ slightly (including added Japanese audio tracks) from this edition.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Though this film deserves a full-blown special edition designed with adults in mind--or at the very least a book detailing its troubled production history--the best treatment it's had to date was the 2004 TMS/Funimation/Our Time Family Entertainment DVD from 2004. That disc has long been out of print and fetching inflated prices via eBay and various Amazon Marketplace sellers.

But now it's back. And despite Amazon incorrectly listing the aspect ratio as 1.33:1 and the distributor as Platinum Disc, rest assured that this is EXACTLY the same disc content as the 2004 edition: the film is presented in ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN, with 5.1 Surround Sound (plus a basic Stereo option) plus all the extras from the original release, which are decidedly aimed at children unfortunately. You get: static-screen character profiles; a Slumberland Singalong featuring three songs from the film; a ""Make Your Own Royal Scepter"" craft project (text frames) and four trailers, one of which is for a computer-animated children's feature called A WOBOTS CHRISTMAS that looked so horrendously out-of-date even in 2004 that it could only be a Christian film, plus three other trailers for much better productions: the likewise computer-generated Canadian feature SANTA CLAUS BROTHERS (2001), the flat-animated short NOEL NOEL (also from Canada), and a lengthy spot for one of the early ARTHUR DVDs.

As with the Funimation edition, the packaging states the film runs 100 minutes, while the film itself actually runs 95 minutes. No big deal, and at least it's not the heavily cut version that appeared in the days of VHS.

But the real gem here is, as mentioned, the WIDESCREEN presentation of the vastly underrated LITTLE NEMO. If you're a fan of either American, Disney-style animation, or Japanese, Miyazaki-style anime, you OWE it to yourself to pick up this budget-priced release to see what you missed.

If you're looking for proper extras, your best bet these days is YouTube, where you can find several ""Making of"" features from around the time of the film's release (look for these ones: =mhS6jPZvURI  ,  =IJ6f81ZYIfI) as well as Osamu Dezaki's 1987 pilot anime film (=fCLXfJFOlUY&NR=1) and the rare and spellbinding Miyazaki test footage (=fnL-6yLzgWA) that never made it to the final production once he left the project.

Fantastic to finally have this film back on DVD, and at a decent price to boot!",1235174400,57,2787,4.900212314225053

But till this day I could not forget images of a movie I have seen years ago (seems like forever). Little Nemo is a movie I have seen 12 years ago and although I don't even remember what it was about and what the name was, I couldn't forget this movie and was sure that it had something to do with ""Nemo"". Now that I've found it, I just have to tell you: this is a great movie worth seeing over and over again, no matter how old you are (I think I remember my parents enjoying the movie with me!)!",1120435200,2,633,3.9147286821705425
493073,5,6302650046,"When I was small, I was completely obsessed with Disney cartoons. I had them all, and still do, although, its been a while since I've popped one into the player. But to this day, and I think even when I am 40,60,80 I will NEVEREVEREEVER get tired of this miraculous animated gem! This film proves that animation can be more than just a way to keep the little kids distracted. Little Nemo transports you into a whole 'nother magical world-you feel the dazzling atmosphere of the places Little Nemo visits all the way through. The animation is brilliant, and unique, making the journey all the more delicious to watch.
Little Nemo is an animated film like no other. It takes you to a world you have never seen before. It is dazzling, and atmospheric and miraculously pleasurable, and I urge any person out there, whatever your tastes in film to curl up with this delightful animated gem for the heart, soul and senses.

The last time I saw it I was 4 probably and i could remember (almost everything) it like it was yesterday. almost none of my friends had seen it and i went around asking them telling them how wonderful it was so my girlfriend bought it for me for my 15th birthday :) and it is wonderful Everyone should buy it.

493100,2,6302650046,"You'd think a 35 million dollar anime would turn out a bit better. I was very surprised at how bad this movie was. I saw this for the first time when I was 8 and I thought it [stunk]. I saw it again recently and it didn't get any better. It's just another example of a movie that tells too much story in a short amount of time. They should have used that money to make this into a standard 26 episode T.V. series or an OVA series. On top of that, Nemo and the Princess's recording sessions must have been done in one take or something because they sound HORRIBLE!! The poor sound quality didn't help either. I will give it some points for the great looking animation and the good music. This is what happens when you put all of your money into making the movie look good and not paying attention to anything else. Not recomended to anyone.",1079568000,5,839,4.217391304347826

When you're young you don't necessarily care about the titles of movies, but I fell in love with Little Nemo's adventures. I have since forgotten the title of the story and was blindly searching for it with not a single clue. I could not even remember the main character's name. All I remembered was a little boy, something about a kingdom and a locked room, a scepter, and the nightmare-goop stuff. Finally, about two weeks ago, I saw a commercial for a cartoon called Finding Nemo and I remember thinking that the name Nemo was already somebody else's. And then it clicked. I jumped onto Amazon.com and searched for Nemo and found him. 10 long years of searching and finally reunited with my childhood hero.

The animation takes from such a vast array of ideas and molds them into a friendly yet extravagent dance of imagination and fun. The plot is easy to follow yet it does not bore you and the fast pace story will keep children , as well as adults, in attention. Slumberland is a colorful and beautiful paradise while it's opposite, the land of nightmares, is the epitamy of all things evil and scarey to a young child. The triumph over evil is not played as a cliche and really leaves you with a sense of happiness. I recomend this movie to children of all ages who enjoy a good adventure in the world of imagination.",1050537600,,779,4.3061224489795915
493108,3,6302650046,"The animation is great, the background designs are awesome.  But if you going to expect to fullfill your Winsor McCay quality expectation, don't count on it!  The whole movie is rather just a long episode of a typical Japanese anime movie.  There is no essence of the McCay magic towards it.  Everything is just there for you to see and no surprises.  The story drags way too long; the characters interact with each other more than actually anticipates in the events of the story.  They talk more than actually getting the story going.
The music is not bad, but I could hardly hear what they are singing.  And it is not as well written and scored as the early 1900s Little Nemo musical (rare to find!).  It seems like they did the music because they need it for the movie.
It is a good movie to rent, but not good enough for any animator or animation fan to keep in the shelf.  But this is the western society, the asian society might have a different point of view.  Afterall, it is made in Japan.",1044748800,2,998,4.375
