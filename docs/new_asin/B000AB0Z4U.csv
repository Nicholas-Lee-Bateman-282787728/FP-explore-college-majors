2384372,5,B000AB0Z4U,"In order to bring this important early sound era documentary into proper cultural and natural historical focus, one must bethink of the prodigious changes which have altered the face of Africa and its humanity and fauna during the more than 70 years since the film's production. One can only imagine the reaction of a 1930 audience which viewed the extraordinary events presented and filmed by Colorado-based explorer Paul Hoefler, including the death and mealtaking by a family of lions of one of Hoefler's expeditionary native assistants, total decimation of the expedition's surrounding flora by a massive winged horde of locusts, and remarkable animals and people of many varieties. Narrator Lowell Thomas' somewhat casual comments of events which could not have been greeted in such cavalier fashion at the time that they occurred can be offputting, and his attempts at whimsy consistently fall as flat as the veldt being traversed, but withal the narration provides a raft of historically fascinating data. Hoefler's book of the same title, published shortly after the release of the film, differs insofar as the expedition actually travelled from east to west, rather than the reverse, but for purposes of visual impact actual events were edited in order to produce dramatic action.",1135900800,,1289,5.2926829268292686
8077629,5,B000AB0Z4U,"This documentary, filmed in Africa, traces the expedition of two explorers through the African bush. Billed as the Strangest Adventure Ever Filmed, I found it fascinating to view all of the major African animals in their natural habitat and several African tribes going about their daily business. There are also several hunting scenes, both by the animals and the native tribesmen. Animals kill humans, and humans kill animals. For the time period, even with some corny dialogue, this is a well done documentary. If you have an interest in the animals and the tribal culture of Africa, I would highly recommend this film",1526083200,,621,5.038834951456311

8077632,5,B000AB0Z4U,"My wife and I loved this from start to finish. How refreshing not to have political correctness holding back very human and sometimes funny remarks.
The locust plague was amazing to watch and the tribes where great just being themselves.
please dig up more like these.",1477612800,,268,4.8478260869565215
8077633,3,B000AB0Z4U,Offensive yet anthropologists would find this interesting. Not intended disrespect but racism and arrogant view of animals and people of the Congo.,1477008000,,147,5.7272727272727275

8077635,1,B000AB0Z4U,"This is a censored version of Africa Speaks (1930).  What's missing is the segment on the so-called ""Ubangi"" and the custom of lip-stretching, which was featured prominently in the film's original advertising.  The final scene is also missing, and the segment of the Masai hunting lions is so damaged and badly spliced you'll want to return the disc for a refund.  I compared this DVD from A2ZCDS.com with an old VHS from independent distributor Video Sig.  While the image is, of course, better than the VHS, this DVD is missing approximately 15 minutes that appears in the Video Sig VHS.  Repeat:  this is a damaged, censored print.  Plus, as another reviewer pointed out, the photo on the box is a composite featuring people from Papua, New Guinea.  While on the subject of the box, it's the most poorly designed graphic I've ever seen on a commercial DVD.  Do I regret spending $20 for this DVD?  Absolutely!",1414108800,,912,4.788461538461538

8077637,5,B000AB0Z4U,"I found this DVD to be an interesting bit of history and an example of the limits of colonialsim.

For those of you who don't know, as late as the 1930s most Americans did not  know anything about Africa that they  hadn't learned from Tarzan movies.

Most people thought of the continent as a wild land ruled by savages - even though it was the cradle of civiliation.

In order to find the real africa these filmakers aparently went down and tried to film the first real documentary ever about the continent.

What you get is some surprisingly rough, yet honest footage. Because there has not been a good deal of editing, there are some rough patches here, but for a project that mostly just wanted to teach Americans that there were real, civilized people in Afrida, the documentary works very well.",1146700800,2,800,4.598591549295775
8077638,5,B000AB0Z4U,"I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewer - this DVD is great!

When you read about Africa in the news today it's hard to imagine a time when it was a new place to explore and most people had a very limited understanding of the continent.

This DVD shows you Africa through the eyes of explorers as they discover, docement and show America what Africa is really like.

It is a must have for anyone who wants to see this part of the world from a new perspective.",1145923200,2,466,4.2727272727272725
