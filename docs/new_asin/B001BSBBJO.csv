3498090,5,B001BSBBJO,"Taken from the 1952 episode of ""The Colgate Comedy Hour"", what distinguishes this version of the ABBOTT AND COSTELLO THE CHRISTMAS SHOW from other releases is that it can now be seen in color. Of course, if you want to see the special as it originally aired, this DVD also includes the option to watch it in black and white. Although the routines were rehearsed, the show was broadcast live so it makes some of the skits even more memorable because anything could have happened. A couple of the skits include one where Lou stuffs a Christmas turkey and another where Bud and Lou deliver Christmas presents to a married couple's home.  Guests on the show include Sid Fields, Dorothy Granger, The Nicholas Brothers, Margaret Whiting, the Four Pipers, a dance team, and the acrobatics of Tom and Jerry. The show is interspersed with vintage 1952 commercials which makes the show even that more entertaining.

The bonus features on the DVD are a series of individual Christmas messages from different celebrities promoting the sale of Christmas Seals. I'm not sure if Christmas Seals even exist anymore, but I know what they were because my mother's parents used to have hundreds of them lying around their house. They bought them every year, but were never able to use most of them.

In terms of quality, this isn't the best DVD. However, compared to many other mass produced DVDs of television shows from that era I have seen, it's actually not too bad. In many ways, it's just like watching the show on an old-time tv.

Overall, ABBOTT AND COSTELLO THE CHRISTMAS SHOW is a nice bit of Christmas nostalgia from a time long past. Fans of Abbot and Costello will appreciate it as well as anyone else who enjoys television from the golden era.",1417824000,,1738,4.726072607260726

3498095,5,B001BSBBJO,"It was everything I hoped it would be. Wish they had done more films toward the latter part of their careers. I did like Lou's pictures he did by himself, died too soon. Have talked with his daughter. She has shared things about the boys with REPS in Seattle. So mush false info about them out there. We have no one like them today, such a shame.",1373760000,,346,4.17910447761194
3498096,4,B001BSBBJO,"I love Abbott and Costello and thought I'd seen at least clips from this but.....no! Wow ,this is a gem and the transfer is better than many recent TV releases. This is like going back to the early fifties. The colorization works on this show. The fact that they have left the original commercials in place is really smart. The ""Leave it to Beaver""style moms in the commercials make me miss that era.
Finally, Abbott and Costello started in Vaudeville. This show lets you clearly see their exceptional talents as live stage performers.
The movies they made never capture that as good as this does. It's LIVE and you know it,you can feel it. IT'S GREAT!For around $5
I really got my moneys worth. Plus it makes my ""Abbott and Costello"" collection more complete. I don't think anyone under 40 would like this. This really is 50's varitety show entertainment that might be best appreciated by those who were there.",1370563200,,911,4.7
3498097,5,B001BSBBJO,"I bought this cause the VHS tape we had of this from 1988 had finally seen its day. We wore it out!!

I can't say too much about anything on here cause it would basically give it all away. I'd hate to spoil it on anyone. But take my word when i say its probably some of the best sketch comedy you'll ever see in your lifetime. Fun and clean as well. My folks first bought this for me when i was 10 and i still laugh just as hard at it now (if not more) as i did back then.

Trust me when i say you can buy this risk free. You're guaranteed to laugh for years to come. You will not be disappointed in any way. It's a shame that comedy like this doesn't exist anymore.",1365465600,,666,3.818840579710145

christmas DVD did not disappoint.",1202860800,,93,5.714285714285714
3498101,5,B001BSBBJO,"The very positive reviews for this disc persuaded me to purchase it, and I was not disappointed. There is a spontaneous, under-rehearsed quality to the sketches and it makes for some hilarious moments. Lou's frequent ad-libs add to the fun, something you don't get to see in their films. The makers of this disc are to be commended for providing great sound and video, and for the inclusion of the original television commercials.",1198022400,,430,4.904109589041096
3498102,4,B001BSBBJO,"This DVD is a must for Abbott & Costello fans. This show reminds of the old Carol Burnett Show in a sense where Lou tries to hold a straight face while delivering his lines, but fails. This makes it all the more funny. This DVD also showcases a good variety of guest stars.",1197936000,,273,4.169811320754717
3498103,5,B001BSBBJO,"This 1952 episode of ""The Colgate Comedy Hour"" has made the rounds before, but Legend Films now offers a new colorized version. This writer wondered whether a kinescope (a black-and-white reference copy filmed off a TV monitor) could be effectively colorized, and the answer is a definite yes.

Bud Abbott and Lou Costello are at their very best in these Colgates, performing their familiar routines in front of a studio audience. The shows were broadcast live, so the anything-can-happen atmosphere is electric, giving Bud and Lou new spark. This one is notable for three routines: Bud trying to get Lou assaulted so they can collect damages; Lou singing ""White Christmas"" with Al Goodman's orchestra, leading into the old Milt Britton arrangement of ""Poet and Peasant"" where the musicians make a shambles of the stage. By far the funniest bit is the ""recipe"" routine, in which Lou stuffs a Christmas turkey... with Bud! Lou can't stop breaking up when he prepares Bud's ""noodle"" for the turkey, and this delightfully low comedy routine is worth the price of the DVD. There is also a lengthy variation of the team's ""Pack, Unpack"" routine involving Christmas presents, which looks under-rehearsed: the cast members casually improvise most of their dialogue on stage.

Veteran comedy foils Sid Fields and Dorothy Granger are on hand, with musical specialties by The Nicholas Brothers, Margaret Whiting, The Four Pipers, and dance team Buster Shaver and Olive Brasno, plus Tom & Jerry, a good acrobatic act. The vintage-1952 commercials are also included.

Great print quality (especially for a kinescope) and great entertainment for the whole family. This new color version is highly recommended.",1196208000,,1696,5.205128205128205
3498104,5,B001BSBBJO,"Every year, I look forward to new Christmas releases of shows and specials from long ago. This year, I was thrilled to find out that the original Christmas special from Abbott & Costello's Colgate Comedy Hour would be released.

This was long overdue, but worth the wait- it's wonderful. It features a restored, colorized version of the hour long special, as well as the original black and white version, for those who want it just as it was shown. Abbott & Costello's routines are very well timed, as usual. It's fun to see them in a different light, compared to the many Universal monster spin-offs that we all love. Sprinkled in between the acts are original commercials for household items like Palmolive soap, and Colgate toothpaste, and last but not least there are special guest appearances from musical talents such as Margaret Whiting, the Four Pipers, Al Goodman and his orchestra, and other great guests such as Tom and Jerry the acrobats.

The bonus features add a nice touch to this nostalgic release. There are individual Christmas messages promoting the Christmas Seals program from stars like Virginia Mayo, Rosemary Clooney, Ingrid Bergman, Gary Cooper, Ray Milland and many more (8 different messages to be exact). These add even more holiday enjoyment, reminding us of those times when issues like tuberculosis were at the forefront of our every day living.

So, when you choose this great vintage treat, sit back, relax and enjoy your Christmas season with two of the funniest men of all time, and Christmas wishes from our very best stars. This is not only a piece of our holiday history, but it's something any family will enjoy, young or old.",1194998400,,1665,4.897163120567376
