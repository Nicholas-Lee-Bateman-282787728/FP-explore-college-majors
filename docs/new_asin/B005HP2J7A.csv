4702595,4,B005HP2J7A,"Documentarian Errol Morris turns his camera to a peculiar would-be love story in ""Tabloid"", an enormously entertaining film due in large part to its subject and star: Joyce McKinney. McKinney was a former Miss Wyoming and dominatrix-for-hire with an especially romantic, and obsessive, view of love. When she was 19, she went looking for that ""special guy"" with whom to spend the rest of her earthly days. She found him in Kirk Anderson, a devout Mormon whose lifestyle she did not embrace. But she says Kirk loved her and proposed marriage. Then he took off to England on a religious mission. Joyce followed and, with the help of friend Keith May, kidnapped Kirk at gunpoint, whisked him to a cottage in Devon, tied him to the bed and had sex with him for several days.

McKinney believed she was liberating Kirk from Mormon brainwashing. She says that Kirk did not leave when he easily could have, and they made plans to marry...until Kirk saw his kidnapping in a newspaper and had to come up with a story to save himself from excommunication. Kirk said he was genuinely kidnapped and raped by McKinney. The British tabloids had a field day. Kirk became the ""Manacled Mormon"", and Joyce was presented as a hopeless romantic or, alternatively, as a manipulative vixen, depending upon which paper you read. The authors of the competing tabloid visions, Peter Tory of The Daily Express, who publicized Joyce's point of view, and Kent Gavin of The Daily Mirror, who dug into her past, are interviewed for the film.

Joyce McKinney tells her own story. She may not possess the mischievous charm that so many men found irresistible 34 years ago, but she is still nutty in a sort of endearing, occasionally frightful way. She never wanted for ingenuity, and she tells a good tale. The part of the story that's missing, unfortunately, is Kirk Anderson's. He would not be interviewed for this film. Too bad. Though I suspect that Joyce is lying or delusional about some aspects of her account, it does seem that Kirk may have been complicit. Joyce's eccentricity has not dulled with the years, though she seems to have abandoned social interaction in favor of dogs. And she seems still to regard love for one individual as permanent and irreplaceable, whether for human or canine.

4702596,5,B005HP2J7A,"When is an Errol Morris documentary ever uninteresting? The acclaimed filmmaker has been crafting award-winning docs for decades now, and Tabloid, proves he still has what it takes. Of course, it certainly helps if your subject is Joyce Bernann McKinney, the former Miss World contestant with a colorful past who turned up in the news again when a woman going by the name of ""Bernann McKinney"" traveled to South Korea in 2008 to have her pet dog cloned. As chronicled in Tabloid, McKinney was previously tied to a 1977 investigation in which a Mormon missionary living in Surrey, England alleged that McKinney kidnapped him, chained him to a bed, and raped him. Tabloid isn't Morris's most thought-provoking work, but it's nevertheless a smart, spirited, and engaging look at tabloid culture and one very fascinating woman, and that makes for a solidly entertaining film.",1320710400,9,871,5.0979020979020975
4702597,4,B005HP2J7A,"Here's a crazy, endlessly fascinating true story literally ripped from the lurid pages of British tabloids. Documentarian Errol Morris shapes a bizarre yet oddly gleeful portrait of a sordid event and its delusional players.

Back in the mid `70s, the UK tabs were warring to top each other with rival views about beauty queen Joyce McKinney (IQ 168) who became obsessed with Mormon missionary Kirk Anderson.  It was rich with sex, religion and outright nuttiness.  A perfect combo.  Archival and new interviews recreate Miss Wyoming's story about her notorious globe hopping kidnapping of her former beau Anderson and tying him to a bed to deprogram his religious beliefs by having nonstop sex with him.  The tabloid headlines referred to it as ""The Manacled Mormon"" story and they milked it for all its sordid worth.

Truth trumps fiction every time and this fantastically entertaining, salacious ""misadventure film"" delivers on many levels, but especially the addictive power of romantic fixation.  I loved it.",1320537600,4,1013,5.254658385093168

4702610,3,B005HP2J7A,"There were two smaller documentaries inside this hash -- either one would probably have been better alone.  They both purport to tell the story of a young North Carolina woman, Joyce McKinney, who fell in love with a Mormon missionary, pursued him to the U.K. in 1977, and with the help of friends kidnapped him and put on a full-bore sex offensive in a remote cottage in order to secure his love and free him from Mormon ""training.""  Other documentaries I've seen by Errol Morris had more respect for their topic, I feel.  Even VERNON, FLORIDA, whose citizens and ambience go from weird to a kind of transcendental weird, stayed with the mood of that quiet and isolated small town and let town citizens, abetted by the camera, speak for themelves.  TABLOID was about half that, about half Michael Moore kneejerk irony (as the central figure reminisces about her teenage years, a clip of a strutting majorette is shown).  The problem with this injected camp is that it tends to drag us away from the subject.  After the film was over, I found myself wondering about her -- did Joyce McKinney finish college? -- how did she wind up in Wyoming? -- did she ever have a full-time job? -- omissions or partial omissions which seemed a little unfair given the assault on her erotomania and (one could argue) insufficient socialization.  I left with the feeling that I'd learned a little about the tabloid treatment of a singular woman who may have been even more wack than the ""cult"" she affected to despise, but ultimately that no one got it right, least of all the normally insightful Errol Morris.  If you're a Morris fan at some point you'll probably wind up seeing TABLOID, but be prepared for some letdown.",1422144000,3,1706,4.682274247491639
4702611,4,B005HP2J7A,"I saw this documentary on Netflix, and the more I watched, the less I liked this woman. I found Joyce McKinney a ridiculously self-centered, narcissistic imbecile. At some point, she claims she's a genius. But I'm not buying it. If she's a genius, geniuses aren't what I believed they were, and perhaps genius is overrated.  No matter. That's only a minor point to what the real attraction is to this documentary, which is the examination, up-close, of a self-absorbed flibbertigibbet.

McKinney was one of those young women who specialized in her youth in beauty pageants, which clearly informed her entire world view. Upon winning Miss Wyoming, she exploited what she could from that success by working as a nude model in salacious photos.  If that was useful to society, she provided nothing else after that.  Her story gets more interesting only after she became romantically involved with a young Mormon man. The relationship had more meaning to her than it did to him, because as a Mormon, ""missionary"" is not just a sexual position: The church assigned him to England, and he ended the relationship with Joyce so he could be free to do the Lord's work.

Joyce was having none of that.  Recruiting a couple of men to assist her, Joyce flies herself and her team to England, where she kidnaps the young man by gunpoint. They whisk him off to a country cottage, which she described in cloyingly romantic terms, where she attempts to ""deprogram"" him by -- according to the alleged kidnap victim -- handcuffing him to the bed and forcing him to have sex. That's the ""tabloid"" part of the story referenced in the title. The key attraction of this documentary is Joyce herself, a condescending nitwit talking with that phony countrified sweetness, affecting a greeting-card purity, acting like she's still some starry-eyed girl in love. No bumpkin cliche was spared in describing her aspirations for emotional fulfillment. I can't emphasize enough how stupidly disconnected she is from reality, unaware of how her obvious insincerity is failing to impress, so wrapped-up in herself the way she is. She inadvertently insults the listener in her belief that they're stupid enough to fall for her unmitigated phoniness. It's fun to watch, in a way, just for that simple-minded sugary attitude she has.  She was a so-so beauty queen after all, with a stock view of the world that fails to comprehend subtleties and depth.  Her descriptions of her emotions sound like they came from greeting cards printed with glittery expressionist romantic images.

Recommended (if you're in a certain mood).

4702614,3,B005HP2J7A,"Some of you may have heard of Joyce McKinney--that is if you were reading trashy tabloids more than 30
years ago! Oh don't be so snootyyou know youve sneaked a glance at those terrible papers while
waiting in the supermarket checkout line! You looked a little longer than you should at headlines about
minor mishaps of the stars or recent monumental screw ups from has beens. But how come you never
see a headline about a monumental screw up of a nobody from yesteryear. Enter Joyce McKinney,
crowned Miss Wyoming back in... oh, who cares. She is the subject of a new IFC Films documentary
called Tabloid, and she made her mark not as a beauty queen but by kidnapping the man of her dreams
and evading authorities for years.
As IFC Films puts it, Joyce's ""labyrinthine crusade for love takes her through a surreal world of
kidnapping, manacled Mormons, risqu photography, magic underwear, and celestial sex-until her dream
is finally realized in a cloning laboratory in Seoul, South Korea. Tabloid is a vivid portrayal of a
phenomenally driven woman whose romantic obsessions and delusions catapult her over the edge."" And
boy does that about sum it up.
You feel Joyce's enthusiasm today as she retells the story from 30 years ago of how she tried to save the
man of her dreams from an apparent Mormon cult in the U.K. Her eyes light up as she recounts being
caught by police, put in jail, and escaping while on bail back to the U.S. Director Errol Morris made
excellent use of film and photo images that captured the spirit of the tale without trying to dramatize it with
look-a-like actors or reenactments.
The cutaways were stylish, although some of them may have been too jolting or dizzying. The characters
were well placed, told their sides of the story well, and gave you a full picture of one beauty queen's epic
fail! But in the end, you pitied the main character yet couldn't truly identify with her. How many of us would
have gone to the lengths she did for a partner who clearly was only ""sort of"" interested in her? Okay so
maybe some of us can relate to that more than others--but when you see the lengths she went to you'll be
hard-pressed to find application in your own life or reflection in the life of someone you know.
Still Joyce is an eccentric that is very entertaining to watchas are all of the other characters. So if you're
into trashy tabloids, or just into watching the ranting of a mad woman who was in the headlines for weeks,
see this film.",1408406400,,2471,4.5801354401805865

4702619,4,B005HP2J7A,"There are some extremely stupid people who shop at Amazon, and it looks like every one of them has reviewed this movie.

Joyce McKinney is not a nut, she is not crazy, and she did absolutely nothing wrong in trying to liberate the man she loved from a dehumanizing cult that had (and still has) him in its clutches. Her mistake was in thinking he was worth saving, but love often isn't rational.

She is a very colorful person, but that's good, not bad. The world needs more colorful people and a LOT fewer mindless clones (they're the ones who think she's crazy).

The life she led in LA before the incident in England had absolutely nothing to do with that incident, and she had done nothing illegal in LA either. But the slimy British gutter press smelled blood, and they went tearing into her for all the blood they could spill.

They're disgusting. That they are STILL gloating over their assassination of her character 35 years later - one of the slimiest even having the gall to call HER a vampire, while smiling the creepiest vampire smile I ever saw - is testament to their total depravity.

I greatly admire McKinney for having survived what they did to her with most of her charm and sense of humor intact. She's a survivor, and she hasn't faded away among the millions of Stepford Wives like a good little girl. She's still her colorful, charming, open, vulnerable and feisty self after all she's been through, and I greatly admire her for it. SHE gets four stars.

I would give Errol Morris one star for showing the British press scum as the gutless, amoral, grinning creeps they are - but he gladly plants himself with them in the ""Joyce is barking mad"" camp (it sells tickets and wins awards), so he gets nothing from me but the contempt he and all those ""press"" sharks deserve.",1384387200,5,1793,4.535603715170279

Morris has such great access to his subjects and I would recommend this to those who enjoy a really juicy story such as this one.,1383264000,3,474,4.163043478260869
4702621,1,B005HP2J7A,"There is a moment, about 45 minutes into Tabloid, in which Peter Tory, a reporter from the Daily Express who covered the ""Manacled Mormon"" story, admits that he and his colleagues at the Express had become the voice of Joyce McKinney.  Tory bemoans this fact saying, in essence, that they had become the mouthpiece of a total nut job.  Director Errol Morris, who is on the other side of this exchange, seems to agree that that is what McKinney had made the Express into.  The irony of this exchange is that Morris seems entirely unaware that he too (apparently unwittingly) was becoming the voice of McKinney, only telling her side of the story.  She gets the laugh word on everything in the film.  His ""foils"" to her story are weak, agenda-driven, and biased and the fact that she is crazy receives only passing mention in one half-hearted exchange (again between Tory and Morris) near the end of the film.  This is an irresponsible piece of film making which does not seek to tell a true story but rather to simply present a narrative; an one which is the view of a paranoid and severely disturbed woman.  There is no attempt on the part of the film makers to research the stories they are told, no thought to examine the logical and factual inconsistencies of the story that anyone of there interviewees is telling them.  The only apparent attempt and this comes in the line of questioning presented to McKinney's primary ""enemy"" the reporter from the Daily Mirror who was the first to bring the world's attention to McKinney's life as a prostitute.  The supposed expert on Mormonism: a former Mormon-missionary-turned-gay-activist whose agenda makes it impossible for him not attack Mormonism.  The use of footage from The God Makers, one of the most offensive pieces of anti-Mormon propaganda ever produced, the complete acceptance of or attempt at clarification for, the misrepresentations of the doctrines and beliefs of a large religious body, and the overwhelming number of intellectually dishonest, evasive, and patently false statements that are found throughout the film make this one of the worst ""documentaries"" ever made.

4702625,4,B005HP2J7A,"Errol Morris has a knack for making documentaries. Some are of headline level stories. Others are of left of center stories. ""Tabloid"" hits on both fronts.

Here's the scoop. Joyce McKinney is an ex-beauty queen from South Carolina. She falls for a guy (Kirk) who, as it turns out, is a Mormon. One day he ups and disappears. She hires a detective who locates him in London. Turns out the Mormons figured she wasn't good enough for him and took him away to do missionary work and keep the two apart. She heads to London to get him back, which means kidnapping him, giving him good food, massages and sex for some number of days. Now she's arrested for kidnapping, thrown in jail and becomes the tabloid star of all time. Deeper digging reveals a side of her that she probably would have preferred stayed under wraps.

This is nifty documentary. It's such an odd story one could easily see it as tabloid fodder. Sex, love, bondage, kidnapping and on and on. It's told fairly straightforwardly with an array of talking heads who were principals in the story as either participants or news folk. It's told in mostly chronological order until the bomb goes off and then they send things back to near beginning and re-examine parts of Ms. McKinney's story. There are certain hints early on that she might not be exactly what she claims, but the reality of it is a real humdinger. She gets a lot of the screen time telling her side of things. She's very animated and rather clever in her speech. You like her and I would guess her story is mostly true in what she says, but she lies by omission. When you get a glimpse of her past though, you wonder how she ever fell (head over heels) for this blubbery, Mormon dude, and why she went to such lengths to ""rescue"" him.

McKinney sits down with Morris for a series of fascinating interviews. Her personality in her twilight years, as bright and captivating as it was in youth, is proof her infamous escapades of the 1970s were fueled by an unusually fast-talking charisma.

The focus of an hilariously lurid 1977 scandal (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joyce-McKinney-and-the-Case-of-the-Manacled-Mormon/dp/B0055POP56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joyce McKinney and the Case of the Manacled Mormon</a>), McKinney traveled from the U.S. to England to kidnap Kirk Anderson, a Utah-bred Mormon missionary with whom she had fallen in love. Armed with a fake hand gun, she forces Anderson into a car and drives him to a cozy British cottage where she promptly ties him to the bed for a three-day love fest. As she says in modern interviews, this was the man of her romantic dreams imprisoned by a repressive Mormon ideology. She was saving him from the cult clutches of inhibition. Plus, she was hoping to become pregnant and marry the strapping man. By the time he returned to aghast Mormon protectors, he had changed his story to kidnapping and rape so as to avoid excommunication. How much of this is literally true matters little. The bottom line is she tied this virginal man to a bed, burned his clothes in the fireplace and insisted on him experiencing a forced honeymoon of his lusty dreams.

McKinney was promptly arrested and imprisoned in England and the tabloids had a field day of ""He Said She Said."" Her initial story of being an innocent ""Juliet"" to Kirk's ""Romeo"" is soon exposed as farce by London's The Daily Mirror when a trunk full of nude photographs are discovered. McKinney evidently made a nice living as a California escort and dominatrix, complete with classified ads promoting a variety of steamy skills. Mr. Anderson probably didn't know what hit him.

All of this silly mess is wonderfully detailed by Morris, arguably one of the great American documentary filmmakers (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Errol-Morris-DVD-Collection-Gates-of-Heaven-The-Thin-Blue-Line-Vernon-Florida/dp/B00094AS8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Errol Morris DVD Collection (Gates of Heaven/The Thin Blue Line/Vernon, Florida)</a>).

""Tabloid"" is best when detailing the eccentricity of McKinney, a true character with the ability to steal the spotlight from Joan Collins at a British premiere of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jackie-Collins-The-Stud/dp/B000BTITYE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jackie Collins: The Stud</a>. Morris weaves in fantastic recollections of the British tabloid reporters of the Mirror and The Daily Express. They provide radically different versions of the sexy weekend, though have strikingly similar opinions of McKinney with such terms as ""hysterical"" and ""manipulative."" McKinney also hired a pilot to fly her to England, and he provides Morris some of the most revealing detail of the epic misadventure.

I suppose when documenting a tale rooted in differing ""his and her"" stories, you need to have a his. Anderson refused to be interviewed and we learn he's apparently living in domestic Salt Lake City bliss with a heavy-set Mormon wife raising a family. We see a couple of hazy photographs of him leaving a grocery store, driving away in an old Mustang. His absence guarantees the documentary will not achieve true greatness, but McKinney is such a complete nut she keeps the entertainment quota moving at a fine clip.

""Tabloid"" is enjoyable, racy fun that truly soars when detailing a most unusual woman living within a fantasy world. Whether she deserved having a talent as great as Morris documenting her 15 minutes is not for me to say. But those nude photographs are real, no matter her hysterical denial.",1327190400,7,4588,6.04147465437788
4702647,5,B005HP2J7A,"We rented this on Amazon Prime last night on a whim (via our Roku).  What a pleasant surprise!!! The movie is well done, and the story couldn't get much more bizarre.  I love how the filmmaker shows objectively both sides of the story.  I don't want to ruin the plot for you, but overall this isn't your typical documentary. It's really entertaining, and miss Joyce Mckinney is the star :)",1323907200,3,389,4.5285714285714285
4702648,4,B005HP2J7A,"If you've seen Errol Morris's previous documentaries (including the Oscar-winning ""The thin Blue Line""), his filming technique will not be new to you. For others, it will take a few minutes until you become comfortable with his clever tongue-in-cheek editing of period TV clips and advertising into the full-face interviews to highlight certain points. I love Morris' work so I was really looking forward to this DVD.

I'll leave it to fellow reviewer ""Mirasreviews"" to give you the background on the story of Joyce McKinney - a really creepy lady (former beauty model in the 1970s who kidnaps her former Mormon  boyfriend, takes him to England, and rapes him - see I told you it was creepy). After she serves some jail time she does some other non-sexual creepy things too. (You'll learn about cloning and even a pit bull that can dial 9-1-1! Got you interested yet?)

What's great about Errol's film is that you realize as the credits roll that for the last 88-minutes you've only heard the interviews of SIX people: McKinney and two reporters (one from each of the two rivaling London tabloid newspapers). And you have not been bored! THAT is filmmaking.

For someone who enjoys offbeat documentaries and or something different, I can highly recommend this film. I rated the DVD only four of five stars because there are no bonus features and this film calls out (LOUDLY!) for a Director's commentary from Morris. We are all left with wondering how he found out about McKinney, how he got her cooperation and - at least for me - what interview parts were edited out.

8473375,4,B005HP2J7A,"Morbidly fascinating documentary about a bat-guano crazy woman and her delusions and obsessions.  I have four observations.  One, no young Mormon just ups and leaves on a church mission.  If McKinney didn't know about Andersons mission plans, either she didn't know him very well or he simply didn't ~want~ her to know he was leaving.  Two, McKinneys protestations that all the nude photos and call-girl stories are fabricated don't jibe with all the moneywads of cash in an envelopeshe spent in pursuit of Anderson.  The facts that she soaked up all the publicity like a sponge and traveled with a huge modeling portfolio are all you need to know about her motivations.  Three, nothing is made in the film of the substantial age difference between McKinney and Anderson; assuming the latter left on his church mission at the customary age, 19, she could have been up to 8-9 years older than he.  She actually obscures this fact by implying she herself was 19
when she was introduced to Mormon boys, but she was ~29~ when the relevant events went down.  And, four, some people question the applicability of the title ~Tabloid,~ but this is a story that could ~only~ have been big news in the British tabloid press.  And once McKinney became a big celebrity in the UK, it was extremely naive of her to think the British rags wouldnt delve into her past in all its cringeworthy glory.  What does it say when its asserted that every Brit can remember where he was, and what he was doing, when he first heard of Joyce McKinney?  The story would never have made it past three news cycles in the US.",1514160000,,1593,4.6535714285714285

Then she says, ""I lost the fingers on my hand after my dog...(was overdosed with a prescription medicine and attacked me)...and my intestines fell out where he bit me."" Paraphrased, sorry. Hilarious and creepy documentary about a woman who's a stalker and kidnapper. the rape part boggles the mind only because we're not able to understand, as a society, how a woman rapes a man who hasn't been drugged ONLY tied down, after being forced to a temporary prison at gunpoint with a fake weapon.

8473384,5,B005HP2J7A,"HOW COULD I HAVE MISSED THIS STORY?  I don't mean the movie, I mean the actual story on which it is based!  I was in my 20's when this began unfolding.  The filmmaker Errol Morris, who did the excellent Fog of War, here turns his attention on a much smaller [and much more amusing] story, one Joyce McKinney [if even that name can be believed] who came out of the deep south, and in Utah met a man she was instantly smitten with [and he with her, not least because she had the physical beauty to match Marilyn Monroe, and an attention-seeking eroticism matching her as well.  But Joyce's was not the needy-dependent type of personalityit was more complex and kinkier.  Well, back to the film & trying not to give it all away, this nice young man naturally turns out to be Mormon.  Nevertheless she determines hes the only man in the world for her and ignores his familys insistence that he ought to marry within the faith.  Then: OMG!  He disappears [AKA going on his mission].  She determines to save him from this cult and get him to marry her, like family members sometimes try to save someone from Scientology or Branch Davidian or whatever.  But her methods are moreuhunorthodox.  I should leave it at that.

Morris succeeds in obtaining interviews with the now considerably older McKinney herself, as well as a couple of journalists who covered her story, an ex-boyfriend, and an ex-Mormon who has a few interesting things to say about how the church and the missions operate.  I found the whole thing  fascinating.  B+.",1436832000,2,1526,4.620817843866171
