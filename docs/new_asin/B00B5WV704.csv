8563088,2,B00B5WV704,"The opening explanations of rigging are the most useful part of this very long DVD.  Once it moves to the fishing sequences, it quickly goes down the tubes.  Want to see the same thing over and over and over with virtually the same narration for a couple of hours?  I didn't think so.  What's more frustrating is that at a number of points the voice-over narration describes something different from what's actually going on in the video sequence, or contradicts something said earlier in the sequence.  If this DVD were one-third its length, and some attention had been paid to editing the audio, it would be worthwhile.  At the moment, Aaron Jasper seems to be the most prolific guy in fly-fishing; it seems like he has an article in every magazine, and the DVDs are coming fast, too.  It would be nice if his future focus turns from sheer volume to clarity and conciseness.",1387411200,,876,4.64935064935065
8563089,5,B00B5WV704,"So, I'm a 3 year fly fisherman.  Things are really starting to come together for me, but I don't have the stream time I'd like.  I have a family and a wife, so I have little time for guided trips and my stream time is 3-4 times a month.  This is the kind of video I'm looking for to up my game.

I spent a week in Alaska where indicator nymphing is the norm when I just stared.  I wish I'd have had this exact video before I went. I'm an engineer by training, so I like to see a formula and then execution, and this is what you get.  I'd equate it to class and lab time, and without actually going on a guided trip, this is the next best thing.

The first section, ""Classroom"" is all about set up, tackle, rigging, casts, mending etc.  The second section ""Fishing"" puts all this in action.  Is there glory shots and fish catching shots?  Yeah of course, how else are you going to see it done.  Lets face it, we've all youtube'd something to find out how its done, only to watch the hero demonstrate it, but not actually catch a fish.  Well this guy shows you catching fish.  There's a couple of scenes where its hard to see the drift, but I think that's the nature of the beast.  If anything, there's plenty of visual repetition to reinforce the ideas.

I've seen a lot of videos and read a lot of books.  Most deliver little information, but this is the whole package.  It's already helped me up my game.",1361491200,,1405,4.163568773234201
8563090,3,B00B5WV704,"This dvd started off well, good educational points made in the classroom segment, you can tell Aaron is a teacher. Unfortunately the on stream segment felt interminable with very little educational value. The premise is good, stand along side while watching the process- the reality is that the camera showed too many gratuitous shots of Aaron catching and landing fish while the focus of the film (the indicator)is out of the frame! Too much time spent on landing and not enough of seeing the mending and the indicator take. Too bad, could have been very helpful. His verbal points are good, its too bad the filming did not match the expected quality.",1361059200,2,652,4.830357142857143
