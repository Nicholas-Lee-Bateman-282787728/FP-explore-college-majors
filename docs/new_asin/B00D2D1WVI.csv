5767461,2,B00D2D1WVI,"Nice idea but a bit late to market.  I own all the DVD's in this set and only spent around $50.  The only thing I am missing is a nice box to put them all into so they are together.  If you must have a complete set in a pretty box, wait a while and the price will come down.

BTW...  I love all of the Jesse Stone movies and would purchase a new one in a heartbeat.  Great mystery entertainment without all the gore and sex.  Bring on a new movie, I am sooooo ready.",1378252800,11,466,3.7916666666666665
5767462,2,B00D2D1WVI,"I LOVE this series, own them all... would give this 5 stars for content, but value?  ALL of these DVDs can be found for $5 each (that is $40 total folks) online or at discount stores...they have been available for some time and their value has dropped as DVDs often do.  What we have here is the latest idea to package them all together and bundle them with a hat and list price it at $100.

Long time fans of Tom Selleck should enjoy his turn as a middle aged man with a complicated past. This series is an adult treat. Not a ton of action but  a very enjoyable character study and this series is populated with terrific co stars like William Devane,Saul Rubinek, Stephen McHattie,Kathy Baker and William Sadler to name but a few.

My review isn't the series...that is 5 stars, Own em all, and I've watched them all at least twice. I'm reviewing the actual product that goes on sale next week. I saw it tonight at my local Barnes and Noble and was hoping it was something new... like maybe on Blu Ray or featuring some bonus disc with interviews and behind the scenes or ANYTHING new to justify a consideration of purchase ..alas no it's just a hat.

Unless you want a clumsy box or desperately want a PPD hat.... there are almost unlimited ways to purchase this excellent series that are 50% less than this way.",1377820800,134,1313,4.382716049382716
5767463,5,B00D2D1WVI,"Tom Selleck rules. All Jesse Stone movies are great entertainment. Jesse Stone for president! Well acted, intelligently written, unraveling mysteries keep you interested.",1377475200,,170,6.434782608695652
5767464,5,B00D2D1WVI,"If you like a detective series with a soul, this Jesse Stone series offers it up in the form of haunting and original music, inspired scenery and sets (love Stone's waterside home), quirky and realistic plots, insightful casting, gorgeous cinematography, and a sensitive but tough detective with Tom Selleck playing Jesse Stone.

Jesse has a few of his own mysteries to solve, along with the ones he confronts in his work.  Is he ever going to not answer the phone when his ex-wife calls and just forget about her?  Will he be able to stop drinking?  Can he keep his community happy in the small northeastern town he polices and hang onto his job?  Will he ever find a woman who is sympatico?

In between battling his own demons, therapy sessions with his shrink (William Devane), and cryptic conversations with just about everybody including his dog, Jesse manages to solve quite a few crimes with his non-police manual methods.

In analyzing why this series is compelling, one reason is that it just feels real.  Selleck inhabits the role of Jesse Stone with ease.  You feel like he's playing some aspect of himself.  The secondary characters are strong.  You don't feel like you are watching a show.  You feel like it's real life.  And you care about the characters.  Even the crooks have a sort of likability in some instances.

This is the kind of series you could watch every year.  Although another show hasn't been purchased by CBS, Selleck said in an interview that he thinks someone will want to produce another episode.  We hope Selleck is right. In the meantime, you can just re-watch the episodes in this complete set until they do.",1373587200,126,1645,4.735915492957746
5767465,5,B00D2D1WVI,"I LOVE the Jesse Stone movies! They are very well done and Tom Selleck sells the character brilliantly! However, I question just how complete the series could be unless there is a new movie this year that I haven't heard about.

5767481,1,B00D2D1WVI,"This review is not for the shows themselves, which are fine, smart, austere modern cop mysteries; I own them and like them. This 1-star review is for the absurd rip off price of the product. So you get 8 shows which shouldn't cost more than $40-50 + a Paradise Police Dept. cap. That would make it a $250 cap. I didn't see any description of the cap here, but at that cost I'm wondering if each and every one spent ""head time"" on Tom Selleck's noggin. Does anyone know? At $80 or $100 this might be a fair deal. As it is, one of the biggest DVD rip offs I've ever seen.",1432944000,5,569,4.089285714285714

5767548,5,B00D2D1WVI,"As I told my friends and family, if you like the first in the series, you'll like them all.  That being said, if you didn't like the first one, then don't bother with the others.  This makes testing out the series relatively painless and without a lot of money flying out of your pocket.  Just rent the first (Night Passage) and see if you like it or not.  BTW, the current price of this set (May of 2014) is three times the price I paid 3 months ago in February of 2014, so either buy them individually or the set when it is properly priced (hat or no hat).

If you're looking for intense plots or non-stop action, this isn't the series to get.  If you're looking for pristine picture quality and deep, wall-slamming bass, this isn't the series either (it doesn't come in blu-ray format).  However, there is nothing wrong with either the picture if one's player has up-converting capability, or the sound.  Actually, the soundtrack is appropriate and nicely done throughout.  This is a very laid back character study of a homicide detective fired from the LAPD. for being drunk on the job.  The back story is his wife cheated on him, then divorced him, which led him to hit the bottle harder than usual, which then caused his firing.  What also keeps him drinking is his daily conversations with his ex-wife on the phone (we never see her).  Neither Jesse or his ex-wife can cut the cord, even though they've been divorced for 5 years.  He's obviously a very good and experienced detective even though he says he's not in the ""right and wrong business"" but in the ""legal and illegal business"".  Yet, he's more than either of those things, but his continuing struggles holding on to his ex-wife often causes a downward spiral ending in booze.

After being fired from the LAPD, Jesse leaves Southern California with his 10 year-old dog and not much else.  He has been offered a police chief job in, of all places, the fictional town of Paradise Massachusetts -- a small sea-side community of around 25,000 people and not too far from Boston.  It was obviously one of very few jobs, if any, offered to him.  But Stone wasn't born yesterday, and immediately wondered why they wanted to hire him.  It doesn't take long for him to find out.  They were looking for someone they could control and have him look the other way.  It's an easy paycheck for a drunk if he could just write speeding and parking tickets, police small-town petty complaints, mind his own business and leave well enough alone, or so the community leader / leaders thought.

The cast of characters are all rounded out very nicely and the acting is first-rate throughout.  Tom Selleck is in top form here, as is all of the regular cast and guest cast of well-known supporting actors/actresses.  These are very believable, everyday characters and not cartoon cutouts.  These are people with minor or not so minor flaws that try to get by day-to-day.  Even many of the bad guys aren't all bad, although there are a few.  It makes for a very enjoyable, although not what I would call thrilling, ride.

Here's another thing I found out after I began watching this series.  It was difficult not to immediately put in the second movie, then a third.  It took me all of 3-1/2 days to view them all, and I was trying hard to pace myself.  That is called being hooked.  It hooked my friends the same way it hooked me.  They couldn't stop at the first one either, and played two or more per night.  It's also a series one will be happy to revisit surprisingly often.

Between 1 and 10, I don't think it deserves more than an 8, or 4 stars (I do have a few minor complaints).  However, this series hooked me like few others have, so I am going to give the Jesse Stone series a marginal 9, or 5 stars.  It has an intangible quality that is hard for me to easily explain.  One of my all time favorite series was Firefly (a no-brainer 5-star series for me), yet I know I'll revisit the Stone series more often than Firefly.  Heck, I've already been through the series twice in three months, and could probably pull it out again today and enjoy it thoroughly.  Matter-of-fact, after writing this, I think I'll do just that.

Here is the order of viewing:

Night Passage (prequel to Stone Cold)
Stone Cold (aired first, but second in the series)
Death in Paradise
Sea Change
Thin Ice
No Remorse
Innocents Lost

5767551,5,B00D2D1WVI,"I love this series.  I only got to watch the first 5 in the series on TV.  For some reason they would not show the other 3.

5767553,5,B00D2D1WVI,"I was (and still am) a huge fan of the late Robert B. Parker. Like most Parker fans I think I was most taken by Spenser. But after reading all of that series I turned to the Jesse Stone series and found I liked them a great deal. It's quite extraordinary for a writer, any writer, to create two hugely successful lead characters each in their own series, but Parker did it.

And Tom Selleck was the absolute perfect choice to play Stone. I really never paid that much attention to Selleck as actor, but in this series he won me over big time. This is one of those cases where, once you've seen an actor in a particular role, you simply can't imagine any other actor succeeding in that role. Selleck is a subtle and his character pained and emotionally wounded without being maudlin or boring. He is tough without throwing it in your face a lot (something Spenser did a bit, but it worked for him). He is really a joy to watch.

I waited for this series to drop in price (I paid $42 right after the Xmas holidays, when it went on sale) and I'm so glad I bought it. I find it extraordinarily comforting to toss one of these discs into my dvd player (a Sony blu ray player actually) and just lay in bed late at night watching one of Mr. Parker's great books come to life.

Tom Selleck plays Jesse Stone, and in the words of the author of the books exclaimed, ""There he is.... Jesse Stone came to life"".

5767565,4,B00D2D1WVI,"I ignored this cycle of films during its first run frankly because it was hyped as a downer-and-proud-of-it when I was still in mourning for the semi-comical gumshoe Thomas Magnum, he of the Ferrari and bouncing eyebrows. I'd been afraid that Selleck would do like a lot of ""fun actors"" have done when given a totally straight role and overplay it. Example--John Goodman's somewhat wooden Speaker Of the House subbing for the Prez in ""West Wing"". But I ran into a dry period over at Netflix where everything worth watching wasn't even on disc yet and started renting the old 1950s Hitchcock suspense series while I bought this box set here to meet my movies quota. Really, if you approach this from the angle of Parker's character Jesse Stone rather than imagine Thomas Magnum at the age of his straight man co-star Higgins, you get a character as semi-dysfunctional as Eastwood's Dirty Harry but a bit less violent. It isn't always easy if you haven't read the books (which I haven't) but it can be done. I also love to picture the reactions of knee-jerk cop critics (the type who are in denial because they don't use the word ""pig"") when they see the occasional scene where Jesse bluntly and calmly threatens a suspect he doesn't have enough evidence on to arrest yet. They all start with a phone conversation with Stone's ""let's part as friends"" ex-wife (does the actress playing her qualify as a ""voice-over"" like Don Pardo?) and somewhere along the way he has his visits with his two shrinks--the one played by William Devane and Dr. Johnnie Walker Red, who makes evening house calls. Now that I already have the complete ""Magnum"" series--as well as having just added this box--all I have to do now is wait until ""Blue Bloods"" runs its course into box set status and my collection will include The Three Ages Of Selleck. The hat's even useful as an off-season substitute for my usual Yankees hats (which sometime get me told that I'm a bit old to be a 50-Cent fan).",1395792000,,1970,4.663793103448276

5767600,5,B00D2D1WVI,"Tom Selleck really does a fantastic job bringing Robert B. Parker's ""Jesse Stone"" to life.  I've been a fan of Parker for years, and I'm one of those readers who feels protective of the characters a good author creates.  I am pleased to be able to say that the entire cast here does an excellent job with Parker's cast of characters.  I bought this for my other half and we thought we had seen all of the movies, but the collection has two movies (Night Passage & Death in Paradise) that we did not even know existed.  Bonus!
Now, about WHY this collection is as good as it is:
First and foremost, with Robert B. Parker writing the original books and Tom Selleck playing the lead, how can you go wrong?  One of the things that made Parker such a great writer is that he put a lot of humanity into his characters.  They weren't anywhere close to invincible super-humans.  They were just human, prone to the same flaws and foibles any of us are.  With a little help from readers, they had the capacity to become real.  Same goes for Selleck's acting style.  He gets to know his characters, and his genuine concern for playing true to the part is obvious, even though he never appears to be working hard or reaching for it.  Which brings us to the next point...
Selleck fills this role as comfortably as a favorite pair of jeans or those old sneakers you just can't toss out.  From the beginning, it seems he has been playing Jesse Stone for years.  Correction:  he's not playing Jesse Stone; he IS Jesse Stone.  As a Parker fan, I have a habit of playing the ""who could play them?"" game with the characters.  I hadn't with this series yet, but I couldn't have cast it any better if I had.
The supporting cast is just that... supporting, but indispensable and incredibly well cast.  Moviemakers seem to sometimes forget that the supporting cast is there for a reason and that, no matter how big a name you have in the lead, it's hard to carry a movie with just one person.  No a problem with the Jesse Stone movies.  Rose, Suit, Hasty, and Dr. Dix... they are all strong enough to carry their scenes.  I don't know how things actually were on the set, but the finished product has that familiar rapport between characters who have known each other for years.  Kathy Baker (Rose Gammon) and Kohl Suddeth (Officer Luther ""Suitcase"" Simpson) are wonderful, playing in perfect balance to Selleck's brooding, imperfect Stone.  They are feeling characters, drawing you in and making the story real.  Saul Rubinek is councilman Hasty Hathaway... a snake-oil-selling carpetbagger who really does care about his friends in his own bizarre way.  Even the dog, Reggie, is as solid as a... Stone.
If you like good drama, movies with heart, soul and a purpose, I definitely recommend the Jesse Stone collection.  I've seen a lot of comments about it being far too expensive a set, and maybe I agree.  $60 or more is a lot to pay, and you may be able to find them individually in the cheap bins at your local big box store.  Then again, for 8 brand new movies worth watching again, I'm not complaining.  It all depends on how much you value good... really good... entertainment.",1394064000,,3161,4.5371024734982335

It is fun to see who recognizes the PPD hat when my husband wears it out of the house you never know where Jesse Stone fans will turn up! The women come and go and seem a bit more desperate than reality would have you believe -  to have sex with an older alcoholicish public servant - but they are interesting. I hope they don't end the series any time soon.,1393200000,,452,4.183908045977011
5767612,5,B00D2D1WVI,"Love this series and I really hope for more, but this is set is very straight forward. The hat is a cheap one, minus the 'Chief ' across the back. Wish they were on Blu-Ray.",1393200000,,173,3.9714285714285715

5767617,4,B00D2D1WVI,"In this series Tom Selleck wasn't at the top of his game, still the acting was excellent. The story line was good but by episode 4 I had figured out who the main bad guy was. The other actors did an excellent job bringing their characters to life and jelled together. Should have had a scene where he fired a deputy that would have added to the story. Didn't like that as Chief of police he would fire almost as if on a whim. The constant drinking and ""love"" for his ex-wife who married and moved on was a distraction to the series. Would like to see the last book made into a show just to complete the series.",1393027200,,610,4.1344537815126055

5767622,5,B00D2D1WVI,"This is a fantastic collection!  I was able to catch a few of the Jesse Stone movies on Hallmark but wanted to get the collection as I wanted to watch them again and again.  The collection gave me 3 movies I had not previously seen, which was a treat.  I think Tom Selleck is in his element as the aloof Jesse Stone.  After making some bad choices, Jesse ends up in a small town position - seen as his last chance.  The town council has little respect for him and the police staff are having issues giving up loyalty to the previous police chief.  Jesse is perceived as a loner who walks outside the box and ruffles feathers.  While most individuals see him as incompetent and troublesome, Jesse is busy putting the pieces together and honing in on the killer.  Tom Selleck does an amazing job portraying the hard drinking, troubled loner and you vary between feeling sorry for him and wondering why he can't get it together.  On the flip side, you get to see the incredible talent he has for never missing a clue and quickly connecting all the dots so he is miles ahead of anyone else in targeting the killer.  GREAT SERIES!",1392854400,2,1125,4.41747572815534

5767632,5,B00D2D1WVI,"What could be better than Tom Selleck portraying one of Robert Parker's finest characters?  Jesse Stone, as in the novels, is a flawed character with a strong moral compass.  Some things go right for him, some don't, but Jesse Stone never loses his pursuit for what's right and his core decency.  My only criticism is that the movies aren't put in chronological order for the viewer; it might be wise to get the movies in order before seeing them.",1392422400,,447,4.632911392405063

You have the perfect weekend entertainment.  The only fault I could find was the problem of ordering the movies so as to watch the entire series in order.  The movies are dated on the back of their individual cases, but it takes a strong light and a magnifying glass to see the dates.

Tom Selleck does an awesome job portraying the police chief of the small town of Paradise. The storylines in each movie reflects the characters caring for each other as they work through problems of their own, or on a crime scene. With each movie, you feel like you really get to know each of them personally. There isn't a disappointing movie in the whole collection. And it's great to be able watch them when we want!

I had been watching various sets on both Amazon and Ebay. I was holding out for the complete 8 movie set and hoping for a 'sale'... which I got, through Amazon.  I used part of my Christmas gift money to purchase this, something that BOTH my hubby & I can enjoy. The hat, a bonus... the movies... LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.

5767654,5,B00D2D1WVI,"A nice collection, not new, but at the sale price is cheaper than streaming.  And if you look at the picture of the set, you can see the PPD ball cap, which is included for those who wear ball caps.  Suggest a marathon viewing, as Selleck turns in one of his best performances, not hampered by the cliches of the 70s and youth.  He plays an older, and if not wiser, certainly experienced man who struggles through each day.  Stone still gets outraged by unfairness, but chooses his battles more carefully.  The occasional come on by a leering female responding to Stones rather battered good looks fits nicely as parody of the younger Selleck's roles.  Highly recommended, especially if you are a Robert Parker fan.",1391472000,,715,4.68

There are no regrets, and now seen all the collection. At present running in Australia is the series ""Blue Bloods""

Much of what Selleck did he patterned after Garner as far as how he treated his co-stars and the crew and writers. On the Jesse Stone series Selleck shows that he has grown as an actor with age. He is hands on all over this co-writing later episodes. He had hoped to continue but apparently the almighty network demographics in the almighty age group said otherwise.

The only thing is you kinda have to watch the second installment first then the first one or it won't make sense. Not sure why this happened but trust me......",1389484800,,628,4.367521367521367

THE REASON FOR MY TWO STAR RATING
Format: AC-3, Box set, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen is the description except only one is widescreen,  I think the last one is  the other seven aren't.  Also, not in high definition.  Why can you order the video in high definition??  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!  Secondly, I think you can purchase them separately for cheaper.  So you are paying an awful lot for the hat.",1388534400,3,629,5.009708737864078
5767725,5,B00D2D1WVI,"in this day of anything goes its nice to see a movie about a man who loves his wife even though she cheated on him. Personally me I would never cheat on a man like Selleck, first he is very handsome, then he is very honest, he is a little closed up but a lot of men are and did I say handsome?  Tom selleck has been a man on film who is honest and has been delt a severe blow in his life.  Look at Blue Blood, his character is the same but different.  I love the charactors  Selleck plays.  These movies are amazing in the production and the charactors and the plot, I will give these mpvies 5 stars ~",1388534400,2,601,3.8934426229508197
5767726,5,B00D2D1WVI,"Indeed, this series rewards discriminating viewers who favor character, story, and atmosphere over the whiz-bang, handheld, sugar-high style that predominates just about everything else these days. This series is a kind of oasis from the tiresome, typical ""frenetica"". The contemplative tone where ostensibly little is happening (except volumes are being communicated), is a brave approach to take and I salute the filmmakers for so doing. This is a show that returns us to an older form of storytelling, featuring substance over style, and an ability to actually end a scene without an accompanying explosion sound to signal that we're supposed to be excited now. Many scenes tell the story visually, in the purest way. Proof that less is more and that the adornments of skakey cam and other mere flourishes don't add much in the final bargain. If you appreciate Selleck, this one's a no brainer. And, P.S., I unashamedly dig the cap they've added to this package.",1388534400,,965,5.113924050632911
5767727,5,B00D2D1WVI,So happy to get this set. Great deal. Don't listen to others its cheaper to buy this way. Buying seperate its $61.42 before tax or shipping. Paying under $50 dollars is a awesome deal for great movies. My friend ordered me a set while this deal is going on (have to pay her back of course lol) before it goes back up to the original price. Watched the first four movies on netflix and loved them. Can't wait to own them and watch the rest. Love the character of jesse stone. And love tom selleck. My dad loves these movies as well. These movies just aren't for the older crowd. I'm in my late twenties and think this is an amazing series. :) love when I can catch these deals on amazon!! And also I don't understand why people would be complaining about the box the movies come in or the hat that comes with it..its all for fun..that's what makes a box set..and why I prefer buying them over movies individually..that's the whole point to get a good deal and a little something fun and extra in a box for lack of a bettter explanation lol why did you buy it in the first place if you are making those complaints...that won't disuade people like me from buying..I know what I like :),1388448000,4,1182,4.28125

5767730,5,B00D2D1WVI,"I have watched and greatly enjoyed all eight ""Jesse Stone"" movies. Hopefully, ""Benefit of the Doubt"" won't be the last, because this series is so well written and well performed, it's like Selleck and company are just hitting their stride.
This is a very old fashioned series, meaning that it relies on intelligence, substance and patience, rather than the current style of micro-fast editing, totally rad dialog and trendy clothes and hair that similar ""police"" movies rely on. Fortunately, in Paradise, there are actually people over 35 years old.
The Jesse Stone series is a very reflective and highly atmospheric series, and there is indeed an audience for this type of show, as every ""Stone"" movie has been a ratings winner.
Sadly, the powers-that-be at CBS who have been producing them claim they won't be doing any more in this series, because they are giving in to the younger (and larger) demographic that prefers the super-fast style and minimum (if any) substance. It's really their stupidity and their loss if this all proves to be true.
Tom Selleck, who is perfect for this role,  has stated that he's not tired of this character, and perhaps a cable channel will pick up the series. Millions of intelligent fans hope that this is true, and will happily look forward to eight more in the series.
As it stands, I am a very happy fan of the eight movies thus far, and I applaud CBS for giving them to us. It's just a shame that they are choosing to toss quality over trendy demands.",1388448000,3,1493,4.7203065134099615
5767731,5,B00D2D1WVI,"When I was younger I watched all of the Magnum P.I. series.  I really, really liked Tom Selleck in them.  But the ones tha
impressed me the most is when he played a serious role - i.e., ""Did You Ever See the Sunrise"".  I knew then he had the capability to be a really fine actor.  And this serious side of him is played so well in the Jesse Stone series.  I, also, have
every one of them.  My husband and I also enjoy ""Blue Bloods"".  If you don't have this Jesse Stone set I encourage you

Well written, if not complicated, story lines kept us interested until the very end.  The only problem with this series is that the episodes were not marked anywhere on the set and we watched the first few out of sequence before a trip online set us straight on the order of play,.

I would have given this 5 Stars ~ the acting is that good.... but we had to goggle the movies to find out which was the 'first', 'second' etc. May its just us... but,  we felt it was important to view #1 where Jesse moves to Paradise to take his new position as Police Chief before we watched one where other characters get introduced...etc.",1383177600,13,434,4.216867469879518

5767771,5,B00D2D1WVI,"The Jesse Stone movies are very good, I've seen them all several times.  The story line is engrossing, the characters mesh well together. Jesse is a trouble man but a good cop and one nice thing is you get glimpses into his personal life that help you understand him.  In a sense you could call the movies quitely haunting. The musical score is and absolute perfect fit to the movies. Another nice thing is the thread of thought and ideas follow through all the movies.  The one thing is the show that should be #2 Stone Cold 2005 is actually, date wise #1 and #2 is Night Passage.  If you change the order, making Night Passage #1 then it keeps the story thread in line. Really good movies, I don't think you could go wrong buying them.",1382313600,9,737,4.357664233576642
