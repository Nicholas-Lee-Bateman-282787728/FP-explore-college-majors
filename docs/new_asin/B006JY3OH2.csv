4999731,5,B006JY3OH2,"Once again the series ""Singlehanded"" in its Season two (2) provided superior and wonderful entertainment.  Season two (2) of ""Singlehanded"" is on three (3) discs with two (2) interrelated stories on each disc that are over an hour in length for each part of the episode.

Once again, former ""big city"" cop Jack Driscoll (superbly acted by ""hunky"" Owen McDonnell) is back in a small and very beautiful seaside village on the coast of Ireland.  This little village is ""ripe"" with crime involving, extra marital affairs that lead to murder, child prostitution, rebellious teens, illicit love affairs, ""shady"" businessmen, etc.  Jack Driscoll all by himself must confront a host of well written, ""spine tingling"" criminal activities.

Jack indeed confronts some really nasty situations this season that again seems to involve everyone including his own family in this small Irish village.  Remember that the inhabitants of this village before Jack were very use to a much ""looser"" enforcement of the laws and of justice.  Jack's father (his predecessor as ""head cop"") tended to turn ""a blind eye"" to the crimes occurring in the village.  Jack Driscoll is a far ""tougher"" enforcer of the laws on all no matter who they may be which leads to some fascinating confrontations between him and the inhabitants of the village.

I really enjoyed Season two (2) of ""Singlehanded"" because it is so well acted, written and directed.

(By the way, I used the subtitles because the Irish accents could get a little thick.)",1334188800,24,1505,5.032258064516129
4999732,5,B006JY3OH2,"Watched Set 1 and set 2 and I hope there are more to be found. Well acted, the scenery is beautiful, it's a fantastic show and I highly recommend.",1333929600,18,146,4.068965517241379
4999733,5,B006JY3OH2,"Oceanside Irish crime, believable characters, & Single-Handed sensational entertainment. Sgt. Jack Driscoll (Owen McDonnell) has beautiful faultless Irish brogue, since the actor was actually from Galway, the filming local. I was astounded with Set 1, now blown away with Set 2. Not as bloody as most UK crime shows, but with more emotional suspense, some romance, and...did I mention the dramatic rural beauty? A solid regular cast including Finbarr (David Herlihy) & Costello (Sean McGinley (The Hanging Gale).
This is Irish Copper Drama but could almost serve as a scenic views documentary if muted; since it is filmed in the Tully Cross & Connemara, arguably the rugged quarter of Heaven.  Even see peat dug and stacked, all that's missing is the aroma & Guinness.

3 episodes each divided into 2 parts, each part 50 min. Each story has its own main plot, but the sub-plots and relationships developed in the first carry on through the entire set. It's compelling enough you may have to watch it all in one setting.

SUBTITLES included
THE LOST BOYS: An old man's body is found, and a local teen accused. A couple travels to Co. Galway with a mystery. Brian (Matthew McNulty-&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lark-Rise-to-Candleford-The-Complete-Season-One/dp/B002EWD0I6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lark Rise to Candleford: The Complete Season One</a>) & Gemma (Simone Lahbib- Monarch of the Glen) look for his family, and a surprising family link is found with the help of Jack's mom, Eithne (Ruth McCabe). There's a deeper darker mystery that Jack must solve while finding a reason for an old recluse's death. Stephen Rea also guest stars.

BETWEEN TWO FIRES: An insurance arson case suddenly looks to be murder. Once again Jack's personal life conflicts with his Garda duty. Are friends involved in crimes? Former Garda Costello is pushing local nightclub plans. An insurance adjuster (Conor Mullen- Island at War), Jack's former boss, is brought into the case.

A COLD HEAVEN: A sexual relationship begins for Jack as well as a local teen, she with a Dublin high flier or worse. This time it is Jack's temper that causes conflicts with private life and duty, even harming the safety of those he's paid to protect. Some adult content, fast violence, and strong language used here.

I've been to the Connemara, this show is picture perfect.",1328313600,47,2387,5.318302387267905

4999755,5,B006JY3OH2,"Okay, not British is the strictest sense, as Single-Handed takes place in Ireland, but I tend to lump these shows together.  If you're bothering to read reviews of Single-Handed, you're probably familiar with other excellent British offerings.
While Single-Handed is no ""Prime Suspect"", it certainly holds its own against 'Suspect' and even my personal favorite, ""Luther"".  Part of the reason is surely Owen McDonnell's portrayal of Jack Driscoll, and an excellent supporting cast. The storylines are good and the Irish landscape is a change from the urban settings of the above mentioned shows.
Please give Single-Handed a look...especially if you're a fan on other British television mysteries.",1400803200,,696,5.4953271028037385
4999756,5,B006JY3OH2,"Set in a rural Irish setting. A sincere cop who loves his job, who will not compromise his principles. But will stand by his friends.

4999757,4,B006JY3OH2,"Late in the final episode of this gripping Irish police series, a character describes Connemara, the area of Ireland where the series is set, as bleak but beautiful. That pretty much sums up SINGLE-HANDED. Each episode contains a number of beauty shots which features the incredible natural beauty of the landscape. This attention to topographical detail suggests that the canvas upon which each episode is painted is virtually a character in the drama. Thats not a bad thing, but it does mean the viewer must come to the series with a mindset that mirrors the slower-paced, expansive yet claustrophobic world which the flesh and blood characters inhabit.

And what is this world? Its a place where the pace of life is slower and few of the people who are featured are likable, especially the principal player, flawed and haunted local Garda (Police) sergeant Jack Driscoll. But there is also a mystical quality that hooks the viewer and draws them in, even while frustrating them with the slow-as-molasses pace of the show. Perhaps its a valid representation of the mass of contradictions that makes up every human being. This runs the risk, however, of gradually wearing down the patience of the viewer.

SINGLE-HANDED is top-notch drama on its own terms. Arguably unnecessarily vulgar in places (a fair smattering of meaningless swear words), the writing is crisp and allows for a great deal of brooding. And while the show avoids many Irish stereotypes, it runs the risk of promoting the inhabitants of Connemara as an unattractive bunch who could do serious damage to Irish tourism.

I wouldnt want to meet any of these characters, especially Jack Driscoll, who seems totally devoid of a sense of humour. While shown to be a person of deep principles, he is also deeply flawed, becoming involved in relationships that invariably prove to be personally and professionally disastrous. If Jack is supposed to be the embodiment of old-fashioned values, then how about some restraint in the jumping-into-bed-with-the-next-attractive-woman-who-comes-along-department? Especially in light of his frequent protestations lets take it slow, which apparently means lets not have sex until weve had something to eat.

No one expects heroes to be flawless in this day and age, but I firmly believe audiences crave a protagonist they can admire; someone who is, in some way, better than themmore principled, stronger, braverwithout being annoyingly perfect. After all, the appeal of a traditional hero is that, just for a moment, we can imagine being in their shoes and doing more than we think we`re capable of. In classic tradition, the hero endures injustice or bad luck or whatever adversity they are dealing with, just long enough until we cant stand it anymore and are desperate for them to take action. This is what justifies extreme behaviour (usually violence) and provides relief (or catharsis) from unresolved tension.

While this reasoning does not fully apply to SINGLE-HANDED, the overall principle still applies: without sufficient resolution an audience feels cheated. SINGLE-HANDED works very well on many levels, but it comes dangerously close to robbing the audience of this precious feature of good drama. Youve got to care about the central character. At the end of the last episode I wasn't sure where Jack Driscoll was going or what he had learned. Or maybe I just didn't care. Im not sure which is worse.

Others may not judge the show so harshly. I certainly don't want to diminish the high standard of production or the impeccable performances that pepper the series. And there was certainly a glimmer of hope at the end, though it was tentative, like a single ray of sunlight peeking through a stubborn Irish cloud rather than a full-blown clear sky. Its just that after all that has been endured, the audience deserves more than the potato crop might not be ruined after all kind of tempered optimism.

All in all, SINGLE-HANDED is a very good show. But I was glad when it was over. Sort of like a long trip through the winding Irish countryside. Lets get to the pub before it rains. And hopefully it won't be in Connemara.",1397433600,,4142,5.029154518950437

4999767,5,B006JY3OH2,"This series avoids the cliches of police dramas and feels more real, as the complex characters each have their dark sides and their redeeming sides.  The stories are not so much told, but evolve and the viewers mind races to understand the twists and turns.  It is a very telling allegory of modern Ireland, always reminiscing about its past, but fearful to return to it. Highly recommended.",1368921600,2,391,4.82089552238806

Not only does Single-handed portray the countryside accurately, it's stories are complex and intertwine the way life only in a close-knit community can be. We love the continuity, the emotional depth, and the complexity of the crimes he has to solve. We also bought season 1 and can't wait for season 3.

4999774,2,B006JY3OH2,Acorn was deceptive in issuing and packaging this DVD. It's a repitition one first season episodes I've seen. It was deceptively advertised by (1) calling it Set 2 (2) there were no episode numbers or titles (3) the description of the episode content picked one of several story lines and carefully selected it so it was so incomplete as to be misleading. Apparently this is a hit for them and until they develop new episodes they will repackage the old in this fashion. Shame on them.,1353715200,7,485,4.651162790697675

4999776,1,B006JY3OH2,"I agree with the previous reviewer who thought this show was not worth watching - I could hardly make it to the tedious end.  It is theatre of the absurd at its worst.  Yes, the scenery is breathtaking, the locations are wonderful [I know the area well] but the story line is so badly written, the dialogue so mundane, the plot so absolutely ridiculous that I wondered what was wrong with these people that they were behaving as mindless idiots.  Yes, the 'idiot factor' is indeed strong here - it might make the story progress but it renders it all just plain daft. It lacks credibility.

There must have been some desire to present the west of Ireland in some 'reality' light but it fails at this because the writer decided to just throw prostitution, drugs, corruption all against the wall and see how it looked.  It looked awful - the characters and the story line don't make sense but I don't want to render a spoiler here.  I could only give it one star - and that's for the location.",1349654400,5,990,4.441988950276243
4999777,3,B006JY3OH2,"My partner and I were so enamored of _Single-Handed, Set 1_ that we could hardly wait for the next set to be released.  The tension that Jack, the lead character, must endure to do his job with integrity in the shadow of his father's corrupt-cop role in the community was so well-balanced in the first release that we were singing its praises to all who would listen.  Not so with Set 2.

Without revealing the events and so-called plot, let me say that the personal drama throughout this set was so overbearing as to have us groaning and debating whether we should even keep watching the set... something we almost never do.  After a while all the endless back-story and personal machinations nearly obliterated any sense that this was a police procedural, or that there was even a crime under investigation.  This was compounded by the writer's sloppy use of ""idiot factor"" on the part of nearly every character (and not the kind that produces Brechtian distanciation, but the kind that makes you wonder if the characters are making their decisions on barbituates).  Well, the whole thing just got grating.

I would gladly pay the price of the DVDs again, if I could only buy back the several hours of my life wasted on watching this set.  Perhaps it should be renamed Heavy-Handed, Set 2?",1347494400,9,1291,4.706666666666667
4999778,5,B006JY3OH2,"Am a big BBC/UK fan and purchased Part 1 without knowing anything about it.  The basic premise is about the relocation of a Dublin cop, somewhat tarnished, to the hinterlands where he grew up.  Now an adult, he finally realizes that there is crime and corruption even away from the big city.  Each episode is, of course, about him solving another crime (not just your basic murder, but more convoluted and complicated crimes). I was pleasantly suprised and impressed and, as you can see, went on to purchase Part 2.  The stories do not insult your intelligence, the actors are superb, and you can't help but be in awe of the fabulous northwest Irish scenery (makes you want to take a trip there to see the real thing!).  The cast draws you in - they're real people, not Hollywood pretty faces.  You become so engrossed in the story that, when done, you find yourself wanting more.  I highly recommend this series for anyone who wants to see something a little different and done so very, very well.",1345852800,16,998,4.604519774011299
4999779,5,B006JY3OH2,"I just finished the last episode of this series which made me appreciate all of the preceding episodes even more. It sort of all came together at the end. However, there was the usual ending where one could only hope to find another series or episodes. Not sure if anything is planned or what the release date might be, but it will be on the top of my list if something is announced. The scenery is spectacular (I often thought that it was filmed in the Pacific Northwest somewhere around Port Townsend) as it seemed so similar. The accents were a bit heavy and I found myself replaying the scenes so that I could follow everything. I am sure that I missed some of the subtleties, but it really wasn't a distracter. Jack always gets his man or his woman and his high morals are always on the verge of compromise by the exigencies which developed to deter him from his convictions. It is refreshing to see a story about the police (GARDA) where there are no guns and shoot em up scenes.
Overall, I would rate series II as the better of the two series, but it would be difficult to enjoy the second series without watching the first. I enjoyed the episodes and it was another production of Acorn Media that further enhanced its reputation for top quality productions ! I hope that you enjoy this series as much as I did
