8522287,2,B007VQ2ONM,"The film opens up with a laugh as a man with a cheap digital camera uses it as a ""carbon detector"" to locate diamonds inside a block of ice.  The van they are in gets stopped by the cops and a shoot out occurs which allows a group of guys driving by to pick up 3 million in diamonds. They try to fence them locally which leads to their discovery by the bad guys. There is a pair of cops on the case too.

The film used every cliche line from 80's if not the 70's. Who says, ""You get 3 guesses and the first 2 don't count"" anymore. The dialogue dragged the film way down. Acting was stereotyped for Italian gangsters.
