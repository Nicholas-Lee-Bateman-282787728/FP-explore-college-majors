6872785,1,B00QJN32ZC,"This film was very boring. I kept hoping it would get better, but it didn't. Don't waste your time or money. We accidently bought it thinking it was the newest movie ""Ouija"" made in 2014. Big mistake. I actually fell asleep. Very drawn out, very boring, bad make-up, bad effects, bad camera work.",1422576000,3,296,4.60377358490566
6872786,5,B00QJN32ZC,"Another Ouija movie! Good, and this is better than the big budget one that came out a while back. This is the sequel to the Ouija Experiment. I  own that and now I  own this one too. This is a better movie than the first, I do believe.  Ouija is an interesting subject to me and we have millions of slashers and gore movies, so why not some more Ouija movies?",1422316800,,359,4.028169014084507
6872787,1,B00QJN32ZC,"There are many great mysteries in the world. Atlantis. Roanoke Island. The Bermuda Triangle. None of them compare to the following question: How in the world did they get this thing funded?!?

As if this first one wasn't bad enough (it was), they made this thing? And I didn't think anything could be worse than the original (that one was so badly acted that I thought it impossible any of them would work again), but this one manages to pull off the impossible: a more poorly acted, zero scare, zero thrill, time-waster than its predecessor. The DVD artwork is, by far, the best part of this c-movie, microbudget, community college ""horror"" video.

The only positives from this sequel are the fact that some of the actors from the first are not in this one, and... nope. That's it.

Trust me. Stare at the DVD artwork... There. You just saw the best part of this movie.

Now, use the money you just saved and go rent something watchable from the GOOD microbudget indie horror movies on the market.",1421884800,12,998,4.621468926553672
6872788,5,B00QJN32ZC,"As a fan of the first The Ouija Experiment, which managed to make me jump out of my seat a few times, I was looking forward to the sequel. I didn't expect it to go in a completely different direction, but the results make for a fun party flick that I could see getting airplay on SyFy or the Chiller Network.

The found footage format of the first film is gone. This time, the cast from the original movie is attending a screening of it at a haunted theaterso you don't need to see the first film to check this one out. A group of fans wins a chance to stay in the theater overnight, and along with the first films cast members, they are soon being pursued by a freaky looking zombie witch ghost thingy.

Part 2 injects humor, has plenty of jump scares, and features a main girl who makes it clear that she has no intentions of making the same mistakes girls usually do in horror movies. The film is left open for a 3rd sequel, and I hope it involves her, because she ROX.",1421884800,,972,4.164893617021277
6872789,5,B00QJN32ZC,"Great sequel to [ The Oija Experiment ] This time it takes place in an old theater where the group has set up a haunted house open house exploration for the public. If I was a guy the pretty blond girl I don't care how hot she was no way would I be trying out that dorrway to hell Ouija board aka devil board. This was well done the special effects are great and creepy the demonic entity looks authentic and scary as hell, I know some don't like it but I do to each their own. For anyone who hasn't seen the first one [ The Ouija Experiment ] it is really good and the actors and their characters are excellent",1421798400,2,611,4.016393442622951

6872791,2,B00QJN32ZC,"The film opens with brief flashbacks of the original film, which one does not have to view to watch this one as the plot from the first film has no basis in this one. The cast from the first film let us know that the first one was only a movie and not real, in case you haven't figured that out. They are playing the film at a small town in northern Texas at the haunted Ritz theater. The original film plays to a sold out audience who cheers as if this was a major cult classic. (Make a second film in an attempt to sell the first one.)

There is talk of small town inbreeding, a Texas sheriff (Tom Zembrod) who warns them about the Ouija Board and the haunted theater, and Eric who thinks himself a player. Eric uses the bard in an attempt to get some sugar and violates rule # 3 and leaves it open for the creature you see on the DVD cover.

I felt like the people on the tour when they see a person cut in half, shrug their shoulders and say, ""They did that pretty good"" but they don't get excited. If you didn't like the first one, this one doesn't get any better.

6872803,1,B00QJN32ZC,"To quote Mariah Carey, ""I can't even know what to say.""

This was a bad movie in the company of terrible films that one can find on Prime.  I was frustrated by this sequel because it was such a silly departure from the first iteration.  Mind you, the first iteration wasn't exactly a chef d'oeuvre, but even though the plot was hackneyed, the filmography redeemed the film and made it somewhat watchable.  In this sequel, you get a combination of ridiculous filmography and a still-terrible dialogue and plot, and you end up with a patchwork of embarrassment and stupidity.

Here's the premise without spoilers:  The original film was apparently an actual found-footage movie that has turned into a cult classic.  Three of the original cast members show up to promote the movie in a what looks to be a hillbilly of a town.  Cue in the hilarity that is the acting and plot:  a feral demon, a sheriff who thinks he's acting well but is nothing more than a caricature of a real actor, original actors that definitely look great but who haven't taken a single acting class since the first film.  If anything, they took classes on how to prove that it is plausible that you can surpass subpar acting by even lower subpar acting by showing up on set drunk on arrogance and high on self-adulation.  And not to be outdone, the three protagonists are worse.  Yes, this is possible.

The main protagonist is a girl who, for some odd reason, has a British accent, but with no explanation about how a sophisticated girl like this from England shows up in Podunk, Texas.  She wears an Elvira's amount of make-up, with a worse coif.  She is passably pretty and absolutely annoying.  She has zero sense of style and looks as if her wardrobe were picked out by Stevie Wonder and her make-up by the Abominable Snowman.

Her best friend can be classed as the biggest queen I have seen since watching an episode of ""RuPaul's Drag Race.""  It irritates me that directors find it acceptable to put gay characters in movies for the sole purpose of making them caricatures or forcing them into offensive, tired tropes of what people think gay men are.  Nothing wrong at all with effeminacy in gay men; it exists, of course.  But it's not the entire picture of us.  Some of us are masculine.  Some are halfway in between.  Some overcompensate by running around and challenging the biggest, buffest straight men to arm-wrestling matches.  #Dumb.  The point is that we're not ALL or ALWAYS ridiculous, hypersensitive, sexually incontinent people.

Putting that aside, he's a terrible actor with a halfway decent look.  His clothing is way too tight for someone of his young age, that is, if he's playing an older teen.  Again, you can never tell, because his acting makes him emotionally and visually ambiguous--unintentionally.  When he's afraid, it's hard to tell whether he really is or is just constipated.  If at all possible, he's the worst actor out of them all.

The third protagonist is the typical odd person out.  She's gothic, dreadful to be around, and uncomfortably quiet.  She's not terribly attractive, has an atrocious style of dress, and instead of seeming downtrodden, just looks irritatingly depressed, like someone stole her puppy 10 years ago, and she never got over it.

The rest aren't even worth writing about.  Here's the bottom line:  If you have nothing to do, including filing your taxes while driving 80 miles per hour into a brick wall while being doused in gasoline and sugar, by all means, watch this movie.  Otherwise, drive yourself into the aforementioned, fire-covered wall and avoid this drivel like it was covered in SARS.",1433721600,4,3634,4.784565916398714

6872807,1,B00QJN32ZC,"If you've watched the movie Ouija and you sought this movie out looking for an awesome sequel to that movie, then don't watch this.  It has nothing to do with that movie other than the title ""Ouija,"" and the fact that it has a Ouija board in it.

The special effects are campy, the plot makes no sense, and another reviewer took the words right out of my mouth, the cover is the best part of this movie.  Except there is no creepy child in this movie, the ghost behind the child is in this movie and it looks better on the cover than it does in the movie.

This movie is just bad, low budget, campy and it's honestly not worth the 90 minutes it takes to watch it.  Skip this one.",1430611200,,679,4.075187969924812
