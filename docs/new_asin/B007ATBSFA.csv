8513628,3,B007ATBSFA,"What there is is indeed gorgeous; I could see myself abandoning life here in the cold, cold Midwest for life in Polynesia.  However, sometimes Maxa needs to SHUT UP and let the viewer enjoy the sights and sounds of the South Pacific.  He often gets in the way.  Oh, and how about some authentic Polynesian music?  He spends too much time with himself as a tourist, yet doesn't really offer any insights except the same banal cliches we've heard too often.",1393459200,,455,4.580246913580247

8513631,5,B007ATBSFA,"We just got through watching  ""Escape to French Polynesia"" and enjoyed it very much. Underwater scenes of fish and coral, airplane views of those incredible mountains, perfect beaches, cheerful people. We don't travel. We stay home and watch  videos. But now I wonder if maybe we're really NOT too old to enjoy such an adventure as a trip to French Polynesia. How much can you get from looking at pictures of delicious freshly caught seafood?  Not as much as eating it, I'm sure! We enjoyed visiting Hawaii, way back when. Who knows? It's something to consider. At least we can enjoy this gorgeous video again and again! This DVD was bought via Amazon.",1355184000,4,652,4.752212389380531
8513632,5,B007ATBSFA,"This 53 minute episode of Rudy Maxa's World-French Polynesia with vivid natural colors of this romantic paradise is just absolutely stunning. Rudy starts his personal journey on the islands of Bora Bora, Moorea and Tahiti then off to the Tuamotu Archipelago of numerous islands and finishing on the lonely remote Marquesas Islands. From this program I now have a better insite to the geography of French Polynesia and will plan a trip there.",1350691200,5,441,5.054794520547945
8513633,5,B007ATBSFA,Watching this video made me want to go to this area of the world right now.  This video has stunning pictures in high definition.  This video is great like all Rudy Maxa videos I have seen.  It should not be missed.,1341360000,4,215,4.195121951219512
