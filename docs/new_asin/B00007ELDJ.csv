1808264,5,B00007ELDJ,"While Run Man Run is often cited as the inferior sequel to The Big Gundown, I think it is actually a superior film. The Big Gundown is a much more formulaic movie, and although Run Man Run does not have Lee Van Cleef, Donal O'Brien holds his own in this movie and is not overly derivative of other spaghetti western characters. This movie is pretty funny and is more effective as a comedy than the Trinity movies. In addition, the theme song has a beautiful rousing melody that provides Run Man Run with an energy that it maintains throughout. So, I disagree with other reviewers, I do not think this movie dragged at any point.

I think this movie would appeal to just about anyone who enjoys the movies. It really provides a light-hearted, good time at the movies, and this print of it is also very clear and clean. I have seen it three times since I bought it and I'm sure I will see it again.",1190678400,,896,4.333333333333333
1808265,3,B00007ELDJ,"I bought this film shortly after I saw The Big Gundown. I was hoping it would be as good but it wasn't. I wasn't bad but some of it was lame. Tomas Milian was funny at times with his Cuban accent when he was cursing. As in The Big Gundown, you don't get to see too many knife throwing scenes but the ones seen where cool. If you can locate, get The Big Gundown. The DVD quality is fantastic as all of Blue Underground releases.",1173484800,2,427,4.035294117647059
1808266,4,B00007ELDJ,"Italy cranks out another great western and further proves why they're better at films about the wild west than the Americans are.  The plot on a whole isn't terribly original, but there's enough cleverness sprinkled throughout the film.  The always lovable Tomas Milian's a Mexican bandit who holds the key to 3 million in gold.  On his search for it, he's persued by just about everyone under the sun including bounty hunters, mexican revolutionaries, a badazz gunslinger, a chick from the salvation army, and his own fiancee.  Milian is no Eastwood(that role's left to Italian regular Donal O'Brien), his hero is more like a weasley sidekick you'd see in a Leone western.  He's a whiz with the throwing knives, and isn't afraid to put a bit of humor into the character when it's needed.  The title of the film refers to numerous scenes where someone(sometimes himself) is telling him to ""Run!"".  While it may not be as good as Django or Companeros, Run Man Run is a worthy addition to your spaghetti western collection.  Plus it comes with a cool 60s documentary on spaghetti westerns and a 17 minute interview with Milian and director Sollima.",1154304000,4,1146,4.841025641025641
1808267,4,B00007ELDJ,"Only a smudge of oil would spoil whipping egg whites, so I can't give Run Man Run 5 stars. It's either perfect or not so, but I can rate it a strong 4/5.
Tomas Milian is one of my favorite actors in the European Western category, along with Cleef, Eastwood, Strode, and other notables. Milian always packs a strong punch when he delivers his performances. Milian's character Cuchillo grabbed me from the opening scene when he walked into trouble. That's a classic moment that I thoroughly enjoyed, and Milian held his character throughout the film. Donal O'Brien seemed just a bit too reserved. And the voice seemed pretty muddled. I feel Milian deserves much more credit for his work, ad I see that he is still going strong in the movie business.
Director Sergio Sollima (one of two other Sergios, the other being Corbucci) kept this on a lighter and somewhat faster pace than Corbucci's more solemn films.
The film transfer to DVD is terrific, with a fine mono audio and video track presented by Blue Underground. I don't know if I've done the right thing since no one else has mentioned it (like a Sixth Sense secret) but I've discovered that this DVD also has at least 3 Easter Eggs hidden. A review of the DVD If You Live, Shoot! also has 3 Easter Eggs, so if you ever get a Blue Underground DVD, look closer and you may find some presents.
I really enjoyed the script that was followed. It wasn't too heavy but wasn't too funny, like at least one film, ""My Name is Nobody,"" if I can recall it correctly. One really hilarious moment happens when Cuchillo is strung up and has words with one of his oppressors. Talk about insulting! If I were the military official, I would have pulled an Indiana Jones on Cuchillo.
This DVD was part of the Spaghetti Western Collection I purchased, and of the four (Django, Mannaja, Run Man Run, and If You Live, Shoot!), I enjoyed this one the most. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this again, and it would help round out a fine collection of films for the lover of macaroni flicks. Tomas Milian fans would really love this (I think it's one of his best roles), and I think Donal O'Brien fans might be a bit disappointed. I would not compare this to the Leone classics, as the format is so different. Like comparing apples and grapes. They're both similar in very basic ways but fly into different directions as European Westerns. I wouldn't call the violence ""shocking"" by today's standards, at all. This isn't nearly as shocking as If You Live, Shoot! was.
Tech Specs and EASTER EGGS: A region- free NTSC DVD of 121 minutes in a nice transfer from original stock in its original theatrical release of 2.35:1 (widescreen only) and enhanced for 16X9; English and Italian mono tracks; optional English subtitles; poster and production stills gallery; a 1960s documentary on filming spaghetti westerns; Run Man Run: 35 Years Running documentary with video interviews of Sollima and Milian; trailer. There are also 3 Easter Eggs I found. The knife that Donal O'Brien holds on the main menu page can be highlighted scroll over Play but scroll LEFT); an invisible knife can be highlighted across Cuchillo's face in the chapters page (scroll to Main Menu then push UP); an extra trailers selection can be highlighted in the extras page (scroll to Main Menu and scroll LEFT).

1808268,3,B00007ELDJ,"Run Man Run is a sequel to one of the great Spaghetti Westerns ""The Big Gundown"" unfortunately The Big Gundown isn't released on any format here in the US,so unless you've seen it on Cinemax or purchased an import,this movie might not appeal to you as much.
This is basically the continuing story of Cuchillo (Tomas Milian) the Mexican knife-throwing bandit,and his search for lost gold,with a Mexican Revolution spin thrown in.
This movie is a wannabe Leone type epic that comes off being episodic. At times this is a very good film but at others it drags on. Sorely missed is Lee Van Cleef who would have greatly improved this film,Donald O'Brien's character is a good one,but the chemistry was much better with Van Cleef. A decent Spaghetti,but way too long.",1044662400,8,761,4.7727272727272725

1808272,4,B00007ELDJ,"A western from 1968, by Roman director Sergio Sollima, also known as ""Corri uomo corri"" or ""Corre Cuchillo Corre"". Ok, this movie should fit your expectations should you be looking for an entertaining Spaghetti Western. The movie has a fast paced and entertaining story, with lots of killings (some blood but no gore), several bad guys, and the usual Mexican revolutionary frame that moves the story. However, the movie is to a good extent, and action and adventure gest. In short, our hero, ""cuchillo"" (played by Tomas Milian) gets involved with the revolutionaries and is sent to a crappie town in southern Texas to get hidden gold that will fund Mexican revolutionaries. As you may guess, not only Cuchillo has an interest on this gold.

Director Sergio Sollima directed other two movies with Tomas Milian palying the ""Cuchillo"" character, namely The Big Gundown (1966; also acted by the great Lee Van Clif), and Face to Face (1967). For those who have seen The Big Gundown, you should see some evident parallels with Run Man Run. In particular, the character played by the great Lee Van Cleef in Sollima' 1966 film and the character played here by Donald O'Brien. More clearly the duel scene is not to be missed. Overall, I give 4 stars to this movie for being entertaining and with a good story.

Technically, a nice DVD transfer presented in Widescreen format. The nice picture and scenery of this picture probably deserves a Blu-Ray edition. The movie runs for 120 min (the original length according to IMDB). Audio comes in English or Italian, with English subtitles. Extras include the trailer, a documentary with interviews to Sergio Sollima and Tomas Milian, and then a second documentary with interviews to several Italian directors and behind the scenes footage from the Great Silence. So, pretty good piece of extras to me. In case someone cares, the DVD is region free (0).",1414886400,,1888,4.915360501567398
1808273,5,B00007ELDJ,"THIS IS A GREAT FILM AND WORTHY FOLLOW UP TO THE CLASSIC""THE BIG GUNDOWN"".ALSO-TOMAS MILIAN IS A VERY UNDERRATED FINE ACTOR",1401753600,,123,4.904761904761905
1808274,4,B00007ELDJ,"Run, Man, Run! takes its title from the song in The Big Gundown, with Tomas Milian reprising his role as Cuchillo, promoted from supporting player to main character and, unfortunately, singing the title song so badly that you'll pine for Lee Marvin's dulcet tones. The last and probably the least of Sergio Sollima's three political Westerns, it's a step down from the remarkable Faccia a Faccia but is still far from negligible, an anarchic treasure hunt romp that sees Milian dodging firing squads and assorted bandits, revolutionaries, ex-lawmen, the French secret service, the Salvation Army and his girlfriend: no prizes for guessing which is the most dangerous.

Sollima used the genre like a Trojan Horse and he doesn't abandon the politics entirely: the title sequence places the colors of the Italian flag over sketches of the dead and dying of earlier revolutions while when one revolutionary hero dismisses another's sacrifice - ""Letting himself be killed when the lives of these people probably depended on him. And only for one woman"" - it's Milian's amoral hero who remonstrates ""But the people for Ramirez at that time was just that poor woman."" It's just that here he's having more fun with it, eschewing anger for black humor and gleefully subverting the genre staples wherever possible. A gunfight is delayed so the crowd in a bar can place their bets in a scene with a great payoff, John Ireland's revolutionary leader's mother goes with him on his campaigns to make sure he eats properly and doesn't smoke, another doesn't want his wife to give birth in Texas, Milian's girlfriend turns down $3m to betray him but accepts $1000 because ""$3m would be a disaster but with this $1000 I could buy a house and a stable and finally marry the son of a pig!"" while Sollima even finds a literal new spin on the obligatory torture scene, tying Milian to the sails of a windmill. With dialogue like ""Filthy son of a generation of trade workers!"" and ""Is he dangerous?"" ""Very. Senor Ramirez is a poet,"" it's clear he's almost bemused by the whole thing even if the violence still hurts.

It does tend to run out of steam towards the end, with Sollima seeming to lose interest in the obligatory action finale in a deserted town shot in near darkness, but there's more than enough fun along the way to forgive it. Blue Underground's US DVD has both the original Italian soundtrack and the dubbed English version, a featurette with interviews with Sollima and the amiably egotistical and mad as a box of frogs Milian (""If there is one thing I know, it is that I am ******* talented!"") as well as 1968 TV documentary Westerns Italian Style which features footage from the shooting of The Great Silence and interviews with Enzo G. Castellari, Sergio Corbucci, Jean Louis Trintignant, Chuck Connors and others, the Italian title sequence, stills and poster gallery and trailers. Now, if only someone would release The Big Gundown...",1374796800,2,2934,4.866

1808276,4,B00007ELDJ,"Disclaimer:  This film is included in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gunslinger-Western-Collection/dp/B002GOAGP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gunslinger Western Collection</a>, which is the version I saw.  As such, I cannot comment on the quality of the item offered on this product page.  My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

While it still hits all the staples of the Italian Western genre, 'Run, Man, Run' is notable for the first of it's kind that I've seen to step out of the Django/Sartana/Man with no name gunfighter convention.  There is still gunfights and gunfighters, but in a supporting role, and instead the lead is taken over by a slippery scoundrel, a thief and knife-thrower named Cuchillo.  This was actually somewhat jarring at first, but as the film progressed, I began to appreciate its differences.  Like most of its kind, the plot of 'Run, Man, Run' is too convoluted to accurately summarize in only a few words - as a hint, I'll just say there is a lot of gold, which is meant to supply Mexican revolutionaries, and several different parties dying to get at it.  Cuchillo hears the location of the gold from the lips of a dying man, and from there on, it's 'Run, Cuchillo, run', as gunslingers, bandits, French operatives, and even the Salvation Army chase after him, ready to pry the gold from his cold, dead hands if need be.

This film is a pleasant surprise - almost everyone involved hits a high note, especially Milian and his devoted, ruthless intended Dolores (Chelo Alonso is hot, hot, hot).  The product description touts John Ireland's performance, and I agree that he chews up the scenery - for the entire five minutes or so that he's in the film.  The others range from fair to good, with bandit leader Riza (prolific character actor Nello Pazzafini) enjoyable in a minor role - Donald O'Brien, as the former sheriff and revolutionary Cassidy...not so much.  At any rate, 'Run, Man, Run' conforms to these films' habits of mixing and matching surprising and offbeat elements - sometimes forcing a belly laugh from me when I wasn't expecting it - which is part of their charm.  In fact, 'Run' is more of a comedy/adventure - but not in the slapstick mode of the 'Trinity' films, as it's mixed together with several violent and graphic scenes of the grim Mexican experience during the revolution.  The first five minutes of 'Run' illustrates what I'm talking about - I don't want to spoil it, but I get a chuckle thinking about it even now.  Gallows humor, I think is appropriate to describe it.

In short, I think it's safe to say that if Italian Westerns haven't impressed you in the past, then you shouldn't expect much different from this one.  But those who do will find an alternate take on the genre, or at least told from a different point of view (sort of if Tuco had been the primary viewpoint in 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly).  It has its weaknesses - although I enjoy both genres, the Italian Western is similar to Noir films.  In both cases, I haven't yet seen any director completely live up to the potential inherent in the material (I'm not saying it isn't out there - I just haven't seen it).  But perhaps their weaknesses are inextricable from their strengths.  Either way, this one is highly recommended for genre fans - and even those who aren't may still find it funny and enjoyable.

The version of the film I saw was put out by Pop Flix, and also times out at 2 hours, as well as having an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  This tallies with the Blue Underground release offered on this product page, though BU has some extras that I think deserve consideration.  Usually these types of films are completely serviceable in these multi-pack releases - and the Pop Flix transfer is certainly acceptable - but it's dubbed, and BU lists Italian w/English subtitles as an option.  Also included is an interview with Milian and the director Sergio Sollima, and a documentary about Italian Westerns.  With the inclusion of these extras, I would suggest that collectors of Italian Westerns should at least check out the individual release first.",1293148800,,4169,4.878014184397163
1808277,4,B00007ELDJ,"If you're a fan of Italian Westerns and haven't seen this one, it's definitely worth a watch. Usually when a Spaghetti Western tries to mix humor with grit they fail and it detracts from my enjoyment, but this one works. The main character is fairly likeable and has some pretty humorous moments. His constant bad luck is a joy to watch (in a cartoonish sort of way) and makes this picture a fairly pleasant way to spend a few hours.

Again, if you're a fan of the genre I suggest you see it. If you're curious about Italian Westerns, this would make a nice place to start exploring the genre after seeing the Leone/Eastwood trilogy.

The package is great! Nice print, widescreen format, good audio, and an interesting little booklet.",1257206400,,734,4.638461538461539
1808278,4,B00007ELDJ,"While Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci get much of the attention from spaghetti fans, and deservedly so, director Sergio Sollima had his fair share of quality spaghetti westerns, and this sequel to The Big Gundown may be the best one.  Picking up where TBG left off, Cuchillo is arrested for running away from a soldier even though he didn't do anything, and thrown in a cell with Ramirez, a revolutionary leader who preaches peace.  Cuchillo helps him escape, but when they run into a bandit gang, Ramirez is killed, but not before telling Cuchillo where $3 million in gold is hidden across the border in the Texas town of Burton City.  Wasting no time, Cuchillo hits the trail with bounty hunters, bandits, French assasins left behind by Maximillian, an angry fiance, and a pretty Salvation Army officer giving chase.  As I was watching this, I thought 'if It's A Mad, Mad World' was ever made into a spaghetti western, this would be it. Don't get me wrong though, that's not a bad thing, I loved the movie.  A lot of fun from beginning to end with some good laughs and action that does not disappoint.  Adding a score that Sollima admits Ennio Morricone did even though Bruno Nicolai is credited, this is a must-see spaghetti westerns for fans of the genre looking for above average movies in the vein of Leone or Corbucci.  Don't miss it.

 Continuing his portrayal of Manuel Sanchez, ""Cuchillo,"" that he started in The Big Gundown with Lee Van Cleef, Tomas Milian is great as the knife-wielding Mexican peon who stumbles into an opportunity to pick up three million in gold. Milian made his fair share of spaghetti westerns, but for me, this was his best part.  Character actor Donal O'Brien has a great part as Nathaniel Cassidy, a former sheriff and revolutionary who now only fights for himself, although he does eventually team up with Cuchillo in search of the gold. John Ireland is good in a small part as Santallina, a revolutionary leader who hopes to use the gold to support the people and his troops. The very pretty Chelo Alonso plays Dolores, Cuchillo's angry fiance who wants nothing more than to settle down but ends up on the trail trying to protect him. Linda Veras is good as Penny Bennington, a Salvation Army officer traveling across Mexico who Cuchillo meets along the way. Marco Guglielmi and Luciano Rossi are creepy as Col. Sevigny and Jean Paul, French assasins on Cuchillo's trail. Nello Pazzafini seems to be enjoying himself as Riza, the bandit leader who says he fights for the people but is really in it for himself.  And in a small but effective part, Jose Torres plays Ramirez, the peaceful revolutionary who befriends Cuchillo and ultimately trusts him with the secret of where the gold is hidden.  Milian is great in leading the movie, but top to bottom, the cast is good.

 Thanks to Blue Underground, there's some high quality DVDs out there with special features, especially Run, Man, Run.  It offers a great looking widescreen presentation that really shows off the Almerian locations.  The special features include ""Run, Man, Run: 35 Years Running,"" a great 17-minute documentary with interviews from Milian and Sollima, as well as ""Italians Western Style,"" a highly enjoyable 37-minute feature narrated by Frank Wolff with interviews from Sollima, Corbucci, Enzo Castellari, Jean-Louis Trintignant, and Chuck Connors that tries to explain the appeal of the spaghetti genre in a campy sort of way.  Other features include a trailer, a still/poster gallery, the Italian credit sequence, and bios on Milian and Sollima.  Fans of spaghetti westerns shouldn't miss this one.  It's a great movie with Milian leading the way and offering plenty of good extras.  Don't miss Run, Man, Run!",1220486400,,3724,4.880952380952381
