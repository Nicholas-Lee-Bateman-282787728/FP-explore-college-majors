8355495,2,B002826Q3S,"This is NOT a Best of the FBI files. This is Seasons 1 and 2 with the last disc of Season two missing. Due to the title of this so called ""collection"" I ordered seasons 1 and 2 only to find that I had WASTED My MONEY. All I got for my $40 plus dollars was 1 NEW disc of episodes in the fourth disc of Season two. The so called collection is SIX discs. Seasons one and two required an extra disc, or disc FOUR in Season two. So, when one orders this ""Best of"" collection they are actually buying all of season 1 and 3/4 of season two. What a complete waste of money it was for me to buy seasons one and two. So, I gave the ""Best of"" collection to my brother. So again my lil' bro gets something for NOTHING and I got almost NOTHING for $40 plus dollars. Actually it was more like $35 but still I just gave my money away for almost NOTHING.",1351209600,10,838,3.9064327485380117

8355497,4,B002826Q3S,"The FBI files filled a vacuum in UK television programming, as there is very little 'true' serious crime with emphasis on forensic research. Most of the series shown on TV are pure fiction.
I was more interested in the programmes that focussed on forensic science, of which there were not very many.
The mafia dons and lunatic bombers are less interesting to me than the apparently ordinary family, within which a member is deranged enough to premeditate a very serious crime, often in order to profit from a surprisingly small insurance policy, for instance.",1290556800,,559,4.957446808510638
