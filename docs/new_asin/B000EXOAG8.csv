2544377,5,B000EXOAG8,"Let me start off by saying that G-Gundam is one of the most memorable collections of the Gundam Universe. It takes the viewer out of the story lines that we all know and love to deposit them in a future century time frame where all wars between nations are fought in one collective tourniment every 4 years. Every country spends the time between competitions creating a new and more powerful Gundam (the nations robotic fighter/symbol) that represents their culture in order to have a chance of taking control over the others in the next tourney. Through the course of this series, the viewer is introduced into many unique groups of people and the interesting situations they find themselves in for the glory of their home nation. The character development is all about making creative individuals that the viewers can like, even if they are not exactly ""good"" or ""bad."" All in all if you love Anime, or just love Mobile Suit Gundam, you will definatly enjoy this collection. There is something that appeals to everyone in this series, from action and adventure to mystery and even the greatest force in the whole universe, love! If you are interested in finding out more, I suggest you purchace collection one of this series, then pick up the set I am reviewing, your money will be well spent!",1277337600,6,1295,4.76
2544378,5,B000EXOAG8,"This second half of the series is truly the better half of the whole. Domon's journey to defeat Master Asia and the dark Gundam, as well as finding his brother Kyogi is both action packed and heart wrenching. As a whole, this series is more engaging than many of the other gundam series. The story is spectacular and plausible. The Gundams included are amazing and very unique. The series also surreptitiously includes Gundams from other series in the final battle against the Dark Gundam. A great buy.",1247788800,6,502,4.781609195402299
2544379,5,B000EXOAG8,"After a bit of research into which seller to choose I found DeepDiscount.com to be the cheapest and safest retailer to choose from (aside from Amazon.com). Many of the other retailers do not have verification on their websites that indicate a safe and secure transaction. Some don't even have a proper return policy. If you want to buy this item at a lower price but want a safe, expeditious transaction, then I would recommend DeepDiscount.com.",1246406400,2,445,4.946666666666666
2544388,3,B000EXOAG8,"Im giving this dvd set 3 stars because im not overly satisfied. The order of this set i received only 5 of the six dvd's work, so im not getting my money's worth. so shame on Amazon.",1411257600,,182,3.945945945945946

2544390,5,B000EXOAG8,A great and memorable series!,1404604800,,29,5.0
2544391,4,B000EXOAG8,I miss G-Gundam and wish they would make more I love their story and it is a joy to watch,1393545600,,89,3.5
2544392,5,B000EXOAG8,Great service! There is nothing that needs to be improved at all. Will buy from again sometime in the near future.,1393459200,,114,4.476190476190476
2544393,1,B000EXOAG8,"First off, I will say that I love this series, but it is not a review of the show but rather for the product and trying to bring awareness of the product's availability and bootleg problems plaguing the marketplace. This is not a seller problem, but these will be found at conventions, online retailers, and brick and mortar stores that don't know better.

In 2012 Bandai Entertainment USA went out of business. Since then many bootlegs have hit the market, especially for the popular shows.

These bootlegs typically come in a clear case and are nearly indistinguishable between the retail copy. These bootlegs are using the same disc count, disc art, and are copying the DVD sleeves art and information as you would see with the official retail release  1:1. This particular series was never released with clear casing and came in a thick black box. The DVDs they're using for these are DVD-5's, meaning that the max they can put on the disc is about 4.75 Gigs while the official retail releases use DVD-9's. Due to the fact it's impossible to tell by looking at the DVD set, the only way to know for sure if you have a bootleg or retail copy is to check the disc's properties in your computer.

The only way you will know for sure that you got an official retail copy, will be:
1. If you buy *directly* from Amazon or Rightstuf. Their warehouse stock comes directly from the publisher.
2. If you buy new it will come with a security sticker.
3. The final test to see if it is legit is to put it into your computer and see if the disc is less than or greater than 4.75 Gigs. If it's greater than that, then you should be good.
Example: [...]
(note: the bootleg on the right was not an Anime Legends bootleg, so they may have copied the disc file name for these as well)

I hope you found this information useful. There's not many people who know about this and I'd hate for people to continue falling prey to buying bootlegs.

Not only is this happening to Bandai's Anime Legends sets, but it's also happening to Discotek Media's sets as well.

2544395,4,B000EXOAG8,"Where do I even start with this series? A lot of people say Gundam Wing is one of the worst gundam titles and then there are those who say G Gundam holds that distinction. Me? I've seen both series and enjoyed both of them. This series is very playful and then takes on a darker tone in the second half of the story. Overall, this anime does a good job of blending a whole bunch of different elements into this alternate take on the gundam mythos.",1388534400,,447,4.209302325581396
2544396,5,B000EXOAG8,I watched the series on late night TV and never saw it again after that . To find it on DVD is great and I allow only two episodes a day.,1385942400,,137,3.4516129032258065

2544409,5,B000EXOAG8,"The second half of G Gundam kicks off a tournament style format of battles and boy do the matches get intense, the fights between Domon and the shuffle alliance are some of the best in the series, but nothing beats the final battle with Master Asia.",1357084800,,249,4.434782608695652
2544410,5,B000EXOAG8,Lol this show takes me back to when I was a kid and coming one from school and watching Cartoon Network. Great show!! My favorite gundam series,1352246400,,143,4.333333333333333
2544411,5,B000EXOAG8,"This Gundam series is an interesting one...100% enjoyable, a little tongue and cheek, goofy story, and kinda profiles all the countries in hilarious Gundams.  A bunch of gundams fly to Earth for a battle royal to see who will run all the space colony countries.  Not as deep as the other Gundam Series but, as I say, enjoyable and the most hilarious robots ever.  Worth adding, starts off slow, finishes pretty well.",1344643200,,416,4.75

2544416,1,B000EXOAG8,"Ok fine, so nations have Gundam fights to not have bloodshed.  They put too much emphasis on Japan, with the main character, how was it that Japan was allowed to have two upgraded Gundams while other nations had one and stayed with one?  Then the fighters produce special abilities like you would in Street Fighter or Dragon Ball.  If you're a kid, it could appeal to you, but as an adult.  I rather settle for Gundam Wing.",1316131200,,423,4.454545454545454

8115502,4,B000EXOAG8,"just like the last one, watch out for the G- Files. in this one we see the fights leading up to the battle royal. we meet some new enemies and some new friends. we also learn why master has gotten involved with the dark gundam and what the true purpose of the dark gundam really is. we also see what really happened to Domon's brother. and it all ends with all the nations of the world coming together to fight the Dark gundam and Domon tells Rain that he loves her.",1496448000,,466,4.131868131868132

8115505,5,B000EXOAG8,"When we say there is a Gundam for everyone this was the one for me it combined the Gundam aspect with pro wrestling when I stilled enjoyed wrestling, but also it had some mma styling's as well. There haven't been many Gundams I've gotten into since except for IBO, definitely worth buying. Even in the second part of this series you find out a lot about Dommon and the real reason why Koji betrayed Neo Japan stealing the Master Gundam watch it until the end.",1461024000,,459,4.411764705882353
