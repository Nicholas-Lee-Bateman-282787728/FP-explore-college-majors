3152753,5,B00166UFSY,"at the end of season two, you see things start to unravel, doug wilson's marriage, his affair with celia, and peter scottson getting killed.  nancy right now, needs some downtime to regroup and start to cut her losses.  i have been watching the video clips on the shotime website and i can't wait to get season 3 on dvd.  i don't care what the naysayers say about season three.  i will be a loyal weeds watcher until the end of the series no matter when it ends.  and also, it would be nice to see heylia get out of the kitchen for once, but i don't like the addition of mary kate olsen.",1210982400,10,587,4.15929203539823
3152754,2,B00166UFSY,"Weeds Season 3 was a ""good while it lasted"" type of season. The first season really caught my eye and had me wondering what would happen next week, while the second season continued that want of mine to see what was going to happen next. Unfortunately, after I laughed once or twice per episode in season 3, I realized all good things come to an end and that is what I think now of Weeds. The storyline of selling weed, gangs and the upkeep of the community turned more into a ""Days Of Our Lives"" venture rather than a good fun-loving comedy/Satire. It MAY be worth renting but other than that, it's done. Even if they continue the show, I no longer have the desire to watch it.",1210550400,24,678,4.3046875
3152755,2,B00166UFSY,The story weakened significantly in this 3rd season.  The way it ended I really hope this is the end of the series.,1210204800,8,115,4.2272727272727275

3152758,3,B00166UFSY,It's kinda silly in some instances. One minute they're friends with one another next minute they turn on one another. Not a lot of realistic happenings. I guess it's somewhat entertaining but far fetched.,1485820800,,204,5.029411764705882

3152873,3,B00166UFSY,"Suburban mother of two, newly widowed, becomes a pot grower and dealer to support family.  She progresses from PTA mom to naive pot-seller at soccer games, to increasingly slutty, devious, and bent drug dealer. This series preceded ""Breaking Bad"", and the plot parallels are shockingly similar,  (for instance, BB's Walter White has a DEA brother in law  and  Weed's Nancy Botwin has a DEA boyfriend) however the treatment of the subject is entirely different. ""Weeds"" is a comedy and largely a spoof.  Death, grief, drugs, crime, very graphic sex (including pubescent) is played for laughs. ""Weeds"" is VERY gross, profane, and very funny.  I know I am in the minority here, but I can't stand Mary Louise Parker in the lead, or anything she has ever done.  However, the rest of the cast is so hilarious, that I just put up with her. Parker has two expressions: ""deer in the headlights"" and ""fake toothy smile"".  I think she was cast for her bodacious bod. Supposedly her character, Nancy Botwin, sells but does not use pot.  However, Parker herself, always looks high.  I don't find her even mildly appealing and think the show would have been much better with a different actress. And for the record, ""Breaking Bad"" is just about my favorite series of all time .  If you haven't seen it, skip ""Weeds"" and go straight to ""Breaking Bad"".",1407628800,,1336,4.765217391304348

3152901,5,B00166UFSY,"I wonder if Weeds might have been approved of by Kurt Weil and Bertolt Brecht who wrote Three Penny Opera? To me it's a sly and wonderful satirical soap opera about our present delusional fantasies of what it means to keep up with the Jones's in America today and the nature of what our class ideas are as to what constitutes success at any price. This is the funny sunny side of what Breaking Bad is the dark apocalyptic evil version. I love the characters, the premise and the sarcastic twists of plot.",1378598400,,504,4.43010752688172

So savour this last trip around the McMansions (complete with a crooked real-estate developer), Celia's last meaningful contribution to the show, and the lighter more comic side of Weeds. Season Three hits most of the high notes well and if you continue past this season you'll be sad that we can never really go home again. Weeds has some very funny bits this year, lots of satire, and less of the hopped-up faux drama that takes over the series when the Botwins bug out at the end. Highly recommended, but newcomers to the series should clearly start at season 1.",1350172800,5,736,4.7578125
3152929,1,B00166UFSY,"This show was good for 2 seasons and went terminal in the 3rd season, the rest of the seasons just cash in on the name.  How it eeked out six more seasons is beyond me, maybe everyone kept watching to see if it would get better.

Now that isn't to say the first two seasons didn't have their problems but they were interesting and well written enough to assume it would get better.

The problems on this show stems from how unbelievable it is, some of the situations the Nancy character is put in and how she gets out of them stops being realistic sometime in season 1.  It doesn't make sense that experience people would follow a novice in the world of drug dealing.  It's more of a lead character role/hollywood thing and it kills the show.  Real criminals pounce on females trying to walk the darkside unless they prove to be a force to be reckoned with, ""nancy's"" force is the writers.  The character just does whatever she wants and suffers no real consequences, she would have attracted attention from people she couldn't handle.  Basically in the real world she would have been dead or turning tricks real after(or before) getting in debt to uturn.  Being 150k in debt doesn't make you a personal assistant, it did on the show but really, he would have had her dancing in clubs and servicing people on top of selling drugs to make his money back.  I'm sure the star didn't want the character portrayed that way but that's what really would happen.

They show some truth in this with how she dealt with the small time pot dealer but the follow up of her brushing him off after is bull.  He would have dictated her terms not the other way around. Her sleeping with him one time then he's working for her, I don't think so.  He wouldn't have been trying to romance her, he would have tried breaking her and pimping her off.  They say art mirrors life and that's the issue here, it should, even i it's one of those gaint wavy funhouse mirrors.

I also question Conrad leaving her in there with uturn, I don't see that happening, it betrays the character.  I think it was just a way to break the onscreen chemistry between the two and so fans would grow to dislike him.  I saw him walking out with her out of the grow house and then cutting ties for good after they got some distance away from uturn.  They still could of had uturn pop in and control her after finding out the truth, it would have made a lot more sense that way. The writer apparently like the ida of her hooking up with mexicans more and that's fine, just don't portray the Conrad character as eating out of her hand.  He would have moved on, period.  I guess that's what they were trying to accomplish but they went about it all wrong.

After that the show pretty much falls off the tracks, it remains a bit entertaining and you hope it improve but it just gets worst and worst.  I really hated how the cecilia character devolved into a punching/abuse bag.  I just don't see it especially given the jail time even if she was someone else's plaything in the story it should have harden her.  Not make her all weepy and willing to accept abuse, she never reached her breaking point and should have instead of just being comic relief.

To sum it up it's like friday meets desperate housewives and after they gains some popularity they ditch the African american actors(who made it funny) and apparently the good writers as the show starts going downhill during and after the 3rd season.  The guy playing andy does ok but he worked best with the Dean character and the two never got enough screen time together.  The coyote thing should have went to the forefront and the Nancy character's storyline should have taken a backseat.  It wasn't entertaining.  She get's old really quick, they try to angle her as a manipulator but in the underworld she would have been used abused and tossed aside.  You can't write a show about ""empowered"" woman when she has no power base, no angle...absolutely nothing to leverage.

Watch the first two seasons and maybe the third but trust me it's not worth it after that, it becomes a waste of time.

I really hope all the suburban kids watching this aren't influenced by what they see, it never ends like the movies.  It's always worst.",1347494400,2,4238,4.469440832249675

Then On season 5 had the same problem but gave up on trying to get a GOOD replacement. I truely think Amazon bought up a huge amount of bargin sets and dumped them off on the public.

After viewing the season the first time, I would have given it a 4 but now I believe it is a 5.  This is a swan song to Agrestic the housing community that houses Nancy and her crew.  The original cast was together for the last time and would never be back together again.  The Botwins and friends would be homeless and heading towards Mexico.  The greatest loss would be Conrad who would never be back.
This season has Nancy dealing at gunpoint with the death of her second husband, men at gunpoint and Celia who thinks she is above the drug business until financial ruin stares her in the face.  Disaster looms and Jesus Christ doesn't seem to be the boon or protector anyone thought.  Agrestic is being threatened by a takeover by the neighboring community, Majestic, a bigger Christian variety of suburbia.  The pot somehow fits in with Jesus and the cross is used in an amazing way.  All the jokes are there and the shows are a lot of fun especially those with U-Turn, a gangsta who makes Nancy a member of his crew through coercion.

The series took on a bad, bad puerile collegiate-preachy tone that's pretty disheartening at times. Characters have become flat, insipid and inane.

The characters still treat each other with the requisite malice and distaste, but the spark seems to be going out. (Thankfully I'm in Season 4 now and things are back to normal.)  The production values are shoddy, the humor is weak/scatological, the satire is diluted, the new characters are boring and killed quickly or hang around far too long (one S.

3152959,4,B00166UFSY,"Showtime's ""Weeds"" continues its comic savaging of Suburbia with Season 3.  This new season opens with the resolution of Season 2's definitive cliff-hanger - a Mexican standoff with all the guns pointed at Nancy Botwin, America's favorite amateur pot dealer.

Season 3 sees the Widow Botwin and her extended family of misfits, fools, and noblemen plunge even deeper into the maelstrom of having everything you've worked for ripped asunder.  Whether it's losing a beloved spouse, saying good-bye to a cherished job, or even leaving a loveless-but-comfortable marriage, everyone in Season 3 seems to be losing something . . . and we're not talking just a few toes here.

Through it all, Ms. Botwin soldiers on with her unique combination of bravado, naivete, and occasional ruthlessness.  If you're a fan of ""Weeds,"" Season 3 offers more of the same - extremely funny dialogue, rampant and bizarre sexual affairs, the occasional spot of violence, and plot developments so ""out there"" that they work.

The third season never gets as dark as the previous season, and Nancy has grown more confident from all the scrapes she's endured, laying things down more often on her own terms.  On the less appealing side, sometimes the eccentricities of some of the other characters became a substitute for truly inventive writing, and seemed almost like a condescension to an audience the writers assumed might not notice the difference.  The prime example is this business with her younger son Shane talking to an invisible entity he claimed was his dead father.  From the very first season, I never liked these touchy-feely segues with the kids, and this was the worst yet.  Because the show tries at times to be too quirky, I was distracted by wondering how far the writers were willing to go with this nonsense, that the series, while thinking it's cutting-edge, might devolve into the truly ridiculous.  It was annoying to have to consider how this bit of silliness will conclude.  Regardless of what it turns out to be, it's an absurd divergence from what I watch this series for.  It's not even remotely believable that a boy his age would be enthralled to an overactive imagination to this degree; and it would be just plain stupid if he's not and there's an actual poltergeist about.  Whichever they pick, neither works, as neither fits in with the rest of the series.  Still, it's a series with a lot of other hooks, and we watched the entire third season in two days.

Unlike the second season, there was no dire cliffhanger in the finale.  It ties up nicely, with some intriguing possibilities dangling in front of Nancy, with no exigent circumstances attached. The series could have ended right there.  However, there was in fact&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/a-fourth-season/dp/B001AQBGM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">a fourth season</a>, and it's due out on DVD in June.  From the clip I've seen, it appears that it'll be even darker than the 2nd season, with Nancy joining an established smuggling ring.

The Blu-ray suffers the same flaws as the second season, in that the palette gets too smeary or too yellow in bright light.  Some facial details are lost behind the glare of the oversaturation.  I've checked with Blu-ray review sites and they've noted the same thing.  Why this series can't get a great transfer that could be recommended on its own right is probably due to the original film elements.  Like most series, clarity -- not cinematography -- is the main objective.  However, it looks great most of the time, and the price was too good to pass up.  At the time I ordered this set, it was cheaper than the standard definition DVDs.

It should be noted that the second disc of the set operated peculiarly.  Instead of returning to the episode list when an episode ended, the episode started over.  Not a big deal, because you could still access the menu manually.  That wasn't the case, however, when I tried to watch an extra feature titled ""Kush Kush and Away.""  It wouldn't play, and instead went through the entire loading cycle for the disc, returning to the topmost menu.  Amazon exchanged it, but the replacement had the same error.  So obviously there's a defect through at least a batch of these discs, if not the whole line.

Among the other extras that DID work was a faux public-access talk show called ""Good Morning, Agrestic,"" hosted by the series characters Dean Hodes (Andy Milder) and Pam (the goody-two-shoes busybody played by Becky Thyre), interviewing other characters from the series.  Produced strictly as an extra feature for this disc, it was a goofy affair, having a video-taped deadness to it.  It didn't gel.  Parker was conspicuously missing from the fun.  Justin Kirk (who plays Andy Botwin) gets a separate special feature titled ""Uncle AWOL,"" in which he acts the prima donna, encouraged by two lovely young sycophantic assistants.  It, too, was just so-so.

3153015,3,B00166UFSY,"Like Little Children, American Beauty, and Edward Scissorhands, Weeds portrays a planned community as a forgotten circle of Dante's Inferno.  Suburban life really isn't the gated paradise the brochures from the housing committee promise; rather, it's a cesspool of petty people with too much money and nothing to do with their lives.  We've see these kinds of shows and movies before.  What's unique about Weeds is that there really aren't any sympathetic characters.  Even the children in the show come off as selfish demons (who seem far too wise and ironic for their respective ages).  The cast is superb.  The things they do and say make you alternately cringe, laugh, and open your mouth wide to say, ""He did not just do that!""  And it's worth mentioning that the end credits to each episode generally feature a very funny and sometimes dirty folk or pop song that serves as an audio metaphor for the entire episode.  I enjoy the show's attempt to tell a quirky and increasingly unrealistic tale that must be a tremendous challenge for the writers.

On the other hand, the show doesn't evolve much further than a writer's delight: So much of the dialogue is simply a stream of creative, new curse words and phrases.  These start off as shocking and funny, but the veneer wears thin when you realize that it's just a device to divide your attention from the fact that very little is happening in the show, because all of the characters are made of the same selfish mold.  It reminds me of how Family Guy uses the same device in nearly episode: Something happens and Peter will be reminded of the time when he [fill in the blank], and the show proceeds to randomize the plot with a barely relevant flashback.  Again, funny for a while, but it gets old fast.

I should say that I'm not at all put off by Weed's liberal politics, with which I tend to sympathize, and which is probably the most consistent (biased?) part of the show.  Yet something essential is missing from the discussions on race, immigration, drug trafficking, teen pregnancy, single motherhood, suburban life, religion, draft dodging, and so on.  In the end, I have a sinking feeling that the show itself is selfish.  The show, like the characters in it, wants to gate itself off from the views of dissenters like conservatives and the religious.  But that's the way extremism works: Just as fundamentalism breeds no irony and imposes a black/white morality onto humanity, material secularism obfuscates personal responsibility and self-discipline.  In short, the show preaches to the choir who thinks the world would be better if everyone was a little higher, and the show only rarely entertains the possibility that maybe that's not really true either.",1233532800,3,2725,4.848812095032398
3153016,5,B00166UFSY,"This show never fails to satisfy. The cast has been so well chosen, and they work so well together.

3153023,3,B00166UFSY,"I like the show and we sailed through Vol III in about a week's time, but it is pretty forgettable!  Nothing in the previous seasons prepared us for the unbelievable dips in the storytelling, particularly those involving Andy, Nancy's affable, ne-er-do-well brother in law.  If I was the actor, I would be crying every day, realizing that a once promising part had apparently led the writers into thinking they could just ask me to do anything and my contract would require me to do it.  There's no other excuse for the Andy joins the army storyline or even worse, the one in which Andy joins the adult film industry by using his foot.  It is a black mark on TV, though who knows, some may think it funny.

It's almost as though they have one crew of writers for two weeks, then another one comes along and sweeps everything out.  How about Nancy longing for friends and growing obsessed, to the point of sketching her repeatedly on a pad of paper, with her husband's former wife and stalking to stalk her so that they can be pals?  And whatever did happen to the money both women were searching for?  They just dropped it, probably because they were fired.  I don't know how the actors keep track of how they're supposed to be feeling and who they've not slept with by this point.  Mary Kate Olsen -- lots of bad karma.  Matthew Modine -- not appealing.

Never thought I'd say this, but I'm getting tired of drugs, and also tired of the way WEEDS, which seemed like sort of a progressive show to begin with, treats its black actors and characters.  They are either Mandingo type studs, or drug mules, or dumb as posts.  When Conrad and Nancy had their big lovemaking scene, where she's sitting down and he's standing before her, the camera just gawks at his naked hips grinding away, as though his butt was the biggest thing ever to appear on TV.  And then cut away, and then back to it.  It's still playing in some lunatic chamber of my mind.",1231372800,2,1944,4.4645892351274785

3153027,5,B00166UFSY,"THE CONTENT: I'll put it this way.  This is the longest season of Weeds so far, and I watched it ten times faster than any season before it.  In two days, I'd muscled through all fifteen episodes, which make have contributed in small part to how COMPLETE the thing just felt.  Like no season of the show before it, it tests all the characters and takes the story to the next level.  While all of the other seasons were almost sinfully entertaining, this one is so excellent in all levels, from character development to the intricate plot that picks up on the cliffhanger that ended&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-Two/dp/B000Q6GUKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season Two</a>&nbsp;and produces the most cohesive story so far.  This brings everything from the first two seasons together for such an incredible climax that it makes me want to watch the whole Weeds catalogue all over again.  While it's not pitch perfect (as funny as the Andy military stuff was, it was a bit too much for me to buy), it's the best season so far.  Superbly acted (I mean... Mary-Louise Parker... c'mon Emmys), humbly but excellently written, and visually stunning, Weeds is one of the best shows out there.

THE PACKAGE: I get the whole going green thing.  I even think the fact that Weeds went green is a bit funny.  However, I stopped getting it and I certainly stopped laughing when I realized that this flimsy, recycled packaging causes the DVDs to fall about and get scratched.  As sympathetic as I am to the cause... I don't want to keep buying the third season of Weeds over and over because the box can't hold a DVD.  A show this superb deserves packaging that will support it, and Weeds was not given that.  They should re-release this in the same format as the first and second seasons, because this is truly a disservice to the loyal fans.  The packaging is obviously rated a negative... let's just say fifteen, but that has no impact on how many stars I give this.  Just let this passage serve as a warning that the packaging is awful... the worst I've ever seen.

3153032,3,B00166UFSY,"You've heard the drill in these TV-on-DVD reviews: if you liked the first two seasons of Showtime's ""Weeds"", you should like the third.  Having said that, season three isn't inspiring me to write a jump-for-joy, rave-filled review.  For one thing, I can cut a break for a widowed soccer mom forced to deal drugs for a while to make ends meet, but Nancy has been doing this for going on three years now, if not longer.  I know that one doesn't have to admire what a series character does to enjoy a particular show (I like ""Dexter"" and ""The Sopranos"", after all), but for some reason it's bugging me that Nancy continues to embrace criminal behavior.  I know, I know... it's a silly criticism of a show that's not really meant to be taken seriously.  It's probably because Nancy is cute and fun and an otherwise good mom that I want her to stop being a felon.

Also, the season-long story thread was a bit choppy this time, with plotlines starting up and then quickly abandoned, or left unsatisfyingly under-explored.  In the case of the brief, pointless ""Andy grabbed by the army"" plotline, that one shouldn't have even started in the first place (though I admit it did have a laugh or two).  Another missed opportunity was the presence of those usually-reliable-for-laughs cable comedy mainstays: loony evangelicals.  But even here there were misfires.  Oddly, in the episodes where the crazed born-agains appeared, they either weren't ridiculed enough or were ridiculed too much (which isn't easy, let me tell you).  Never a happy medium.  Weird, huh?

Good moments?  Yep, still a lot of them.  Celia's husband and Councilman Doug finding ways to work on a porn movie set, and their response to being there, are a riot.  Good-looking women in those episodes, too.  And speaking of good looking, Mary-Louise Parker remains cute as a button.  But I think I said that already.

The ""Weeds, Season Three"" DVD delivers fifteen episodes (the longest season to date), some commentary tracks, and a few goofy extras of no real consequence.  The episodes look and sound great.

I still like ""Weeds"", and will seek out the fourth season when it comes out on DVD (it helps that there's a pretty interesting close to the season, which genuinely makes us ask, ""what will these characters do next?""), but I'm hoping that the show's junior year mild slump is only temporary.  If season four gets fully back on track, mainly by delivering sharper, interesting storylines on a more consistent basis, I won't even mind if Nancy still keeps dealing drugs.

I thought this season showed us a new side of many characters, Celia, Silas, Shane, Andy and Dean.  I liked how the cliff hanger from season 2 was dealt with.  And in each half hour there was enough drama that at the end of each show you were ready to watch the next one to see what was going to happen.

My only complaint with Weeds is that the plot seems to be repeating with regards to Nancy and nearly getting caught selling, then her being in debt to someone etc.  I've finished season 4, and that's what has made me a little dismayed at the fact that it does seem to be the same formula over & over...but I'm waiting till Season 5 to make up my mind on that.

She then becomes the pupil of a violent gangster who treats her like his little sister, after suggesting to another character that he intends to rape her, but this plot line too is just dropped.
A ridiculous subplot about Nancy Botwin's brother-in-law being accepted into the army, with a wound that would clearly exempt him from service (missing most of the toes from one foot), again goes nowhere, being dropped almost immediately.

I have read of other people with the same problems. I returned it. The season content was a major disappointment anyway, so I am well glad to be rid of the whole thing. The whole ""Weeds"" scenario just keeps going from bad to worse.

  Even if the Side B's were able to be viewed, it is doubtful that those missing episodes could save this ""Dark Season."" Nancy is my girl, but when will she wise up and get down to business? She cannot afford to have friends and she cannot afford to be financially kind to her friends. What was she trying to do with Agent Wonder Bread's Ex-start a Disney movie? She got into the the life for the money for the kids and she needs to stop messing around in the Latte Circuit and concentrate on Business. Burning down California wasn't such a stretch-I was just glad they did not film yet another actor watching the fire with himself well in hand-again. There is way too much guys taking matters into their own hands and thinking that this junior high humor is big time funny again and again, when really, an allusion to it may be chuckle worthy once, maybe twice. ""Weeds 3"" runs it into the ground and it is no longer funny. They do a lot of things that way..

  I hope they put Season 4 on quality disks and put more intellect behind the plot, and perhaps they can save the show.",1217116800,4,1799,4.2

3153063,4,B00166UFSY,"Weeds is really an interesting show. The show itself examines life in a way  that is kind of fair while being pretty amusing.
as the program has progressed we've seen some changes
not a huge surprise for a family supposedly adjusting to life in an underground world of semi-exceptable behavior.over the course of the season some things do get slightly blown out of preportion
or exaggerated. I guess this has to happen to not only show the changes that take place living life on the black market. But also to kep the show moving.
I Recomend this DVD highly-however to be fair I strongly suggest that the show be watched from begginning to end in other words get season 1,season 2 then this.
tuning in to season 3 might seem a bit out of context for a person who isn't familiar with the show.
I have seen that many Dope smokers like the show.
I think that may suggest some basis for reality in some of the suggestions made by the stereotypes.
on the other hand if your just interested in a good Drama/comedy  with a rather uniuqe social angle. I think you'll be more likely to enjoy Weed's than not.
I have some limited history with Pot smoking in high school and early college
and have met some people that remind me  very much of some of those people depicted in the show.
I also have run across many of these ""Types"" in my Non Stoned life.
the Story line is very fresh,funny and keeps you interested without being overly ""Stonerish"" while still probably being pretty funny to those that can apreciate ""stoner humor"" .
I'm fairly conservative and anti -Drug etc.

What could be more American than Mom, apple pie, and weed in the grow house?!  I started watching this gem of a show because of Mary Louise-Parker.  I've continued watching because of the fine ensemble acting, stellar writing, and general shock and awe fun of it all.  What more can happen to 'Lacy LaPlante'?  If ever there was a living, breathing example of Murphy's Law in action, it is Weeds.
Season One, episode one got me hooked....um....addicted....um....made me a fan.  Season Two just strengthened my addiction....my love/hate affair with Agresstic and all the characters who stream on and off camera.  Season Three got me fired up and anxiously awaiting the buzz of season four.
Whether or not you have ever been in that life or known anyone in that life or even like people in that life, the superb direction, the phenomenal scripts, and the amazing cast make this a character study for even the most straight-laced right-wingers.

3153081,5,B00166UFSY,"I'm amazed at all the negative reviews given for Season 3 of this brilliant, addictive funny show.  When I bought the first series of Weeds, it took me a few episodes to really get into it, after which I was totally hooked.  Season 2 was equally brilliant and season three certainly didn't disappoint.  All the characters have fully expanded into the extreme of their type - which is exactly what I would expect of an entertaining show.  This is not reality - this is an extremely funny parody of stereotype characters.  For viewers to suddenly get moralistic about various aspects of the comedy, such as not showing religious fundamentalists in their positive light, completely misses the point.  I, for one, am very grateful that the writers have not degenerated into the mire of political correctness that has completely ruined many a good comedy in the past.  (Not to mention life in general)

Some of the scenes in Season three had me laughing to the point of tears.  Couldn't stop myself watching the whole thing in two nights.  Love the quirky music.  Roll on Sesaon 4!!",1214179200,2,1077,4.767567567567568
3153082,1,B00166UFSY,"I loved the first 2 seasons of Weeds. 3--not so much.

For starters none of the characters are very likable. The characters have always been different shades of gray (which is what has always made them so interesting), but with season 3 several of the characters just become too unlikable to make me care about them. I always found Nancy likable enough, and her story interesting enough, that her story was enjoyable to follow. Not so with season 3. Nancy is annoying, overly-promiscuous, arrogant, a bad parent, and nearly void of any and all morals. She just doesn't have enough redeeming qualities for her to remain a good protagonist. In fact, I can't think of any redeeming qualities the character has this season. Maybe persistence? That still isn't anywhere close enough to make up for scene after scene of Nancy constantly, and uncaringly, hurting the people around her. (Also, she usually follows up by throwing a temper tantrum and trying to blame the other person, and even though the other characters sometimes buy her blame-reversing rants, her logic just never seems to work as well from this side of the screen.)

Writing-wise season 3 is also much more inferior to the first 2 seasons. Several of the stories end up going nowhere and serving no purpose other than to be cute; the way new characters are introduced is always sudden, stupid, and contrived; and several characters throughout the season behave in such unbelievable and absurd ways that it makes it hard to go along for the ride.

I thought the first two season were really clever, with season 3, however, it seems they've turned it all in for cheap laughs.

The one redeeming thing about the show is the ending. The ending is really good--especially if you're someone like me who isn't planning on returning for season 4. The ending makes it really easy to walk away from the show, which is what I'm doing. ""Kooky Nancy"" and her ""wacky troubles"" have just become too stupid for me to care about.

I hate to say it because I absolutely loved the first 2 seasons, but Weeds REALLY jumped the shark with season 3.

At least they gave us an easy way to say goodbye to the show.",1214092800,27,2152,4.694960212201591

The criticisms I have read about Season 3 are a bit odd, considering the premise of the show.  Yes the 6 episode resolution to the Season 2 cliffhanger might have been a bit overdone, but a lot of it was funny.  I think that Season 3, by the time it got to Episode 11, may represent the best Weeds season yet.  I hope that Season 4 continues to carry on this odd cycle.",1214006400,,460,3.9565217391304346

But unlike other reviewers, I found it thoroughly entertaining, proving one doesn't need to smoke pot to appreciate it. Sure, there are some missteps along the way, but one thing about a show is that is always changing. It is evident that Weed's take on suburbia was starting to get repetitive. I did however, still get a kick out of stuff like the huge cross and the new town of Majestic. So enjoy this season for what it is. Hit and miss, but mainly entertaining. I won't spoil the show for those who haven't seen it, but creator Jenji Kohan did get the message that perhaps the suburbia aspect was running out of fresh material and is making some major changes for the fourth season.",1213660800,,774,4.457746478873239

3153089,3,B00166UFSY,"My expectations for this series not unlike a gifted child were high, and while season 3 is far from a failure, one just wanted so much more.  The characters are all here, (perhaps too many for a 26 min an episode show) and they generally act like themselves but the overall lack of character development coupled with very convenient writing which has many acting completely out of character drain the life from an otherwise amazingly entertaining show.  Eventually turning into a satire of itself Weeds Season 3 goes from decent to maudlin and revives the spirit of renewal in its final episode, perhaps too late however.  The people I used to care about start making ridiculous decisions, as the writing becomes basically a filmed graphic novel with outrageous plot twists set in motion to further situations and happenings that just border on the inane or downright unbelievable.  Shanes character becomes the breath of fresh air as he expresses the writers general feeling toward our culture and social climate, but it is almost too much coming from a kid his age.  Again it is a fine entertainment value overall the BluRay discs look great and the extras are fun, Kush Kush and Away is a great little diverison (flash game) but in the end I was glad I rented rather than bought this season, and Season 1 will probably be the only one I keep in my collection.  Great TV compared to what is on, but really could have been SO much better if they had stayed a little more grounded and focused on fewer characters.

3153090,5,B00166UFSY,"I'm disappointed to see many negative reviews of the 3rd Season. I got mine from Amazon last week and have already watched the whole season and it was great! I was nervous going in because I had heard from various people that season three wasn't as good, but after I got watching I was not at all sure what the fuss was about, the show is pushing itself and growing in new directions like it needs to if it's going to survive. The show challenges you to think about ""drugs,"" what's right and wrong, and examines the inter-workings of suburbia with such cleverness that I am always pleasantly surprised.

Nancy Botwin is the perfect character, you love her, but sometimes want to slap her. Parker is an amazing actress and makes this show work from beginning to end. I also love her youngest Shane, he's excellent this season and glad to see him getting more and more airtime. This show is both funny and heartbreaking and blows most shows on TV right now out of the water.

It is not better than the first two but I would still recommend it.  ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** I think this could be the last season of Weeds for some(possibly myself) as it kind of leaves you with an ending where you feel the characters will be fine.  I don't feel as though it would need to continue.  I have also heard that Conrad and Heylia are not going to be a part of the main cast this next season which is really disappointing! Weeds just won't be the same without them and I think this will disappoint some viewers.,1213228800,2,596,4.247787610619469
3153093,4,B00166UFSY,"Okay, Nancy Botwin herself might be included in the category of nefarious nitwits; that's only fair.  She is so very naive about the world of drug dealing, and finds out just how much she doesn't know in this third season of the series.
She has experiences with U-Turn and Marvin that are both hilarious and unpleasant, and then along comes Guillermo, a new kind of thug who ends up wreaking havoc on Agrestic/Majestic that Nancy never imagined.
Celia is by turns sympathetic and hateful, given her behavior towards her former husband and their daughter; yet we can also see how much she wants to love someone and how she drowns her sorrows in alcohol.
Kevin Nealon, for my money, is the one who really shines. The SNL alum does his best and funniest work here as Nancy's CPA.
I'm surprised to say this, but Mary-Kate Olsen does a nice job as Silas's religious girlfriend.
Alexander Gould as Shane gets more screen time, and it is well deserved.  It's too bad that he and Celia's kid couldn't have spent more time in the religious school, where they were shaking things up.
Yes, things change drastically by the end of the season, but there's nothing wrong with that.  They couldn't stay in their little boxes forever.  Now we will have a long wait to see what transpires in their new location in S. 4.",1213142400,2,1302,4.599137931034483
3153094,2,B00166UFSY,"I saw that Season 3 of Weeds had come out recently, and was tempted to purchase it as I had thoroughly enjoyed Seasons 1 and 2.  However, since I own way too many DVDs that I will never watch again, I opted to be patient and Netflix it instead.  I'm so glad I didn't buy this, as it will never get a repeated viewing from me.

There was an excellent cliff-hanger at the end of Season Two, although if the truth be told, even by that point things were getting a little too crazy in the show (but I was still left completely engaged).  After the first couple of episodes of Season 3, however, I started to get a sinking feeling.  It turned into a show about gangsters and thugs, and was a far cry from the 'soccer Mom who deals pot in suburbia' that the series began as.  Sure, there are still some funny parts, and I guess they were enough to make me get through the Season (but just barely), but even Doug and Andy's antics became a little too unbearable and ridiculous to fully enjoy.  There are so many plot twists that simply don't make sense, and many subplots that don't go anywhere and have no place in the series (what the heck did Andy's stint in the Army have to do with ANYTHING?).  Issues get 'resolved' in the most ludicrous ways; it almost feels like the writers want the show to be dumb.  I feel the show 'jumps the shark' a million times and becomes too unrealistic to take seriously.  As another reviewer stated, sometimes the show feels almost 'cartoony'.

I was glad after the last episode was done.  It was a hard watch, but for some reason I felt I had to see it through until the end.  For me the season finale felt like it wrapped the entire series up, and I don't care where Nancy goes now that Agrestic is up in flames.  I am done with Weeds, and I will not watch Season 4.  It's really a shame to know that a series that started off so strong sunk so low.  But this seems to be the trend all too often.

As for the DVD quality itself, of course the picture and sound are excellent.  I can't comment on commentaries or other special features, as I had no interest in watching/listening to them.",1213142400,21,2118,4.239401496259352

However, I was shocked when I saw the ""Green packaging"" thing on the back cover... yay, another cheap cardboard package. This is every bit as bad as the ""There Will Be Blood"" packaging... and that's saying something. It took me about 20 minutes to get disc 1 out alone!!!

3153096,5,B00166UFSY,HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE THIS SHOW!! THEY TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER EACH TIME! THEY NEVER LEAVE OUT COMEDY OR DRAMA! ALL THE ACTORS REALLY BRING IT ALL TO THE TABLE!,1212192000,,158,3.96875
3153097,4,B00166UFSY,"Weeds is a great show, but with the Blu-ray DVD Disc having the compacity to hold 50 Gigabytes of space why not put the entire season on 1 Disc and not having to wast Blu-ray DVD Disc due to the 50 Gigabyte Compacity. Why use 3 Blu-ray Discs when you have more than enough space to use on 1 Blu-ray Disc

1 season of any tv show can be put on 1 Blu-ray DVD",1211846400,4,356,3.810810810810811
3153098,2,B00166UFSY,"I'm assuming anyone reading this already has a grasp on what the series is about and the basic characters around this. To recap, the show surrounds the life of Nancy Botwin and her attempts to acquire enough money to keep up with her rich lifestyle. Her occupation: pot dealer. Naturally Season's 1 and 2 capitalized on the obvious plotline here which is how to get a business going, keeping the secret from the right people, and still being a Mom at the same time.

One would think that Season's 2 finale gave them plenty to work with. Nancy is caught up in a Mexican Standoff with drug dealers on a deal going poorly because Cilas stole the pot she was about to sell. To make things worse, Cilas is on the verge of getting busted by Ceila and the cops for possession of the motherload of all pot, while Shane is with some crazy loon on a trip to Mexico.

I won't go into too many specific details of the series, because doing so would ruin the cliffhanger that those who don't have showtime haven't seen. But the biggest complaint is that the character storylines are completely changed and abandoned throughout the season. You see Andy for instance have a brief run-in with the army again and try out a porn career none of which has anything to do with Nancy or her secret. Shane's purpose in the series, along with Ashley Olsen, who is seen in 3 episodes for 10 minutes each (tops) seem largely irrelevant to everything. Perhaps my biggest problem with this season is that the series might have jumped the shark. Nancy's secret for (while keeping details out to the greatest extent possible) becomes ""too public;"" too many people know she deals and grows, so the tension that existed in Season's 1 or 2 completely dissipates.

With all this said, there are some highlights are Season 3. Doug Wilson and the drug dealers Nancy encounter are hilarious and definitely provide some good comic relief. And the new town Majestic, an even richer and ""better"" Agrestic (and more Christian) provides some good ridicule of the ultra-religious right (even though it does get a little repetative). Even Andy's various storylines, if pointless, do make great comedy.

All-in-all, Weeds is still funny but the the episodes and characters in them lack any sort of direction or unity, which significantly hampers its enjoyability. Weeds this season seems more like a cartoon comedy like Family Guy; Weeds wants to have a new funny skit to put on each episode, but keeps running into the problem that it must continue from past episodes, and keep a story going.",1211414400,32,2548,4.70627802690583
3153099,5,B00166UFSY,"Season Three cranks up the action and raises the stakes another notch, piling up the trouble on everyone.  Sure it all becomes a little more fantastical this season, but the satire of self-righteous suburbanites gets even more biting and scathing.  The dash of extra vinegar is delicious.  Nancy's deal with Guillermo (involving the trunk in episode 7) is pure genius.  Her second disastrous deal, leading to the season finale, is stupefying.
I love the way Nancy capitalizes on the way people underestimate her.  Her apparent naivete is her ace.
The kids' involvement in the operation (including Isabel, ultimately) is both charming and disturbing.
I'm ready for season four!  The soundtracks to seasons 1 & 2 also rock.",1210982400,14,721,5.119658119658119

3387251,2,B00166UFSY,"Weeds Season 3 was a ""good while it lasted"" type of season. The first season really caught my eye and had me wondering what would happen next week, while the second season continued that want of mine to see what was going to happen next. Unfortunately, after I laughed once or twice per episode in season 3, I realized all good things come to an end and that is what I think now of Weeds. The storyline of selling weed, gangs and the upkeep of the community turned more into a ""Days Of Our Lives"" venture rather than a good fun-loving comedy/Satire. It MAY be worth renting but other than that, it's done. Even if they continue the show, I no longer have the desire to watch it.",1210550400,24,678,4.3046875

3387370,3,B00166UFSY,"Suburban mother of two, newly widowed, becomes a pot grower and dealer to support family.  She progresses from PTA mom to naive pot-seller at soccer games, to increasingly slutty, devious, and bent drug dealer. This series preceded ""Breaking Bad"", and the plot parallels are shockingly similar,  (for instance, BB's Walter White has a DEA brother in law  and  Weed's Nancy Botwin has a DEA boyfriend) however the treatment of the subject is entirely different. ""Weeds"" is a comedy and largely a spoof.  Death, grief, drugs, crime, very graphic sex (including pubescent) is played for laughs. ""Weeds"" is VERY gross, profane, and very funny.  I know I am in the minority here, but I can't stand Mary Louise Parker in the lead, or anything she has ever done.  However, the rest of the cast is so hilarious, that I just put up with her. Parker has two expressions: ""deer in the headlights"" and ""fake toothy smile"".  I think she was cast for her bodacious bod. Supposedly her character, Nancy Botwin, sells but does not use pot.  However, Parker herself, always looks high.  I don't find her even mildly appealing and think the show would have been much better with a different actress. And for the record, ""Breaking Bad"" is just about my favorite series of all time .  If you haven't seen it, skip ""Weeds"" and go straight to ""Breaking Bad"".",1407628800,,1336,4.765217391304348

This is the funny sunny side of what Breaking Bad is the dark apocalyptic evil version. I love the characters, the premise and the sarcastic twists of plot.",1378598400,,504,4.43010752688172

So savour this last trip around the McMansions (complete with a crooked real-estate developer), Celia's last meaningful contribution to the show, and the lighter more comic side of Weeds. Season Three hits most of the high notes well and if you continue past this season you'll be sad that we can never really go home again. Weeds has some very funny bits this year, lots of satire, and less of the hopped-up faux drama that takes over the series when the Botwins bug out at the end. Highly recommended, but newcomers to the series should clearly start at season 1.",1350172800,5,736,4.7578125
3387426,1,B00166UFSY,"This show was good for 2 seasons and went terminal in the 3rd season, the rest of the seasons just cash in on the name.  How it eeked out six more seasons is beyond me, maybe everyone kept watching to see if it would get better.

Now that isn't to say the first two seasons didn't have their problems but they were interesting and well written enough to assume it would get better.

The problems on this show stems from how unbelievable it is, some of the situations the Nancy character is put in and how she gets out of them stops being realistic sometime in season 1.  It doesn't make sense that experience people would follow a novice in the world of drug dealing.  It's more of a lead character role/hollywood thing and it kills the show.  Real criminals pounce on females trying to walk the darkside unless they prove to be a force to be reckoned with, ""nancy's"" force is the writers.  The character just does whatever she wants and suffers no real consequences, she would have attracted attention from people she couldn't handle.  Basically in the real world she would have been dead or turning tricks real after(or before) getting in debt to uturn.  Being 150k in debt doesn't make you a personal assistant, it did on the show but really, he would have had her dancing in clubs and servicing people on top of selling drugs to make his money back.  I'm sure the star didn't want the character portrayed that way but that's what really would happen.

They show some truth in this with how she dealt with the small time pot dealer but the follow up of her brushing him off after is bull.  He would have dictated her terms not the other way around. Her sleeping with him one time then he's working for her, I don't think so.  He wouldn't have been trying to romance her, he would have tried breaking her and pimping her off.  They say art mirrors life and that's the issue here, it should, even i it's one of those gaint wavy funhouse mirrors.

I also question Conrad leaving her in there with uturn, I don't see that happening, it betrays the character.  I think it was just a way to break the onscreen chemistry between the two and so fans would grow to dislike him.  I saw him walking out with her out of the grow house and then cutting ties for good after they got some distance away from uturn.  They still could of had uturn pop in and control her after finding out the truth, it would have made a lot more sense that way. The writer apparently like the ida of her hooking up with mexicans more and that's fine, just don't portray the Conrad character as eating out of her hand.  He would have moved on, period.  I guess that's what they were trying to accomplish but they went about it all wrong.

After that the show pretty much falls off the tracks, it remains a bit entertaining and you hope it improve but it just gets worst and worst.  I really hated how the cecilia character devolved into a punching/abuse bag.  I just don't see it especially given the jail time even if she was someone else's plaything in the story it should have harden her.  Not make her all weepy and willing to accept abuse, she never reached her breaking point and should have instead of just being comic relief.

To sum it up it's like friday meets desperate housewives and after they gains some popularity they ditch the African american actors(who made it funny) and apparently the good writers as the show starts going downhill during and after the 3rd season.  The guy playing andy does ok but he worked best with the Dean character and the two never got enough screen time together.  The coyote thing should have went to the forefront and the Nancy character's storyline should have taken a backseat.  It wasn't entertaining.  She get's old really quick, they try to angle her as a manipulator but in the underworld she would have been used abused and tossed aside.  You can't write a show about ""empowered"" woman when she has no power base, no angle...absolutely nothing to leverage.

Watch the first two seasons and maybe the third but trust me it's not worth it after that, it becomes a waste of time.

I really hope all the suburban kids watching this aren't influenced by what they see, it never ends like the movies.  It's always worst.",1347494400,2,4238,4.469440832249675
3387427,3,B00166UFSY,"I fell in love with Weeds after first season...second...third season. Fourth season left me feeling disappointed and disillusioned. The characters personalities morph and the story line fades away from weeds into deeper illegal exploits. What ended the ""love affair"" for me was, season 4; when Nancy pistol whips Ceilia; shocking, to say the least. I asked around my social circle how they found the series? they didn't get past season 4 either. Hmmm...interesting Weeds lasted 7 years.

Then On season 5 had the same problem but gave up on trying to get a GOOD replacement. I truely think Amazon bought up a huge amount of bargin sets and dumped them off on the public. I have read on a number of sites that I'm not the only one that got stuck with duds.  Buyer beware!

After viewing the season the first time, I would have given it a 4 but now I believe it is a 5.  This is a swan song to Agrestic the housing community that houses Nancy and her crew.  The original cast was together for the last time and would never be back together again.  The Botwins and friends would be homeless and heading towards Mexico.  The greatest loss would be Conrad who would never be back.
This season has Nancy dealing at gunpoint with the death of her second husband, men at gunpoint and Celia who thinks she is above the drug business until financial ruin stares her in the face.  Disaster looms and Jesus Christ doesn't seem to be the boon or protector anyone thought.  Agrestic is being threatened by a takeover by the neighboring community, Majestic, a bigger Christian variety of suburbia.  The pot somehow fits in with Jesus and the cross is used in an amazing way.  All the jokes are there and the shows are a lot of fun especially those with U-Turn, a gangsta who makes Nancy a member of his crew through coercion.  Good show and I feel I mourn for Agrestic and home base that the Botwins had.",1317254400,,1199,4.433789954337899

The show is ok because compared to numerous other and terrible programming on Showtime (akablowtime) its alright. They call it a dark comedy but its not really dark either. To be honest everything about this show is pretty misleading, the fact that people call it really good with good acting is misleading onto itself. Avoid this one and watch shows about our real planet like The Great Migration, or Man vs Wild something that's not bull.

While the writing in the first two season was deep, consistent, mature and kept the story line, this third season has pretty much decimated any good the first two seasons had. The series took on a bad, bad puerile collegiate-preachy tone that's pretty disheartening at times. Characters have become flat, insipid and inane. Situations tend to solve themselves rather trivially and almost in a sit-com fashion. I truly think this was originally a 2-season show that has been artificially drawn out due to the immense popularity the show enjoyed in its first two season. Nothing short of an atrocity.

The characters shamble through increasingly uninteresting and crude scenarios. The show's dark, satirical wit is gone in favor of poop jokes, porno, and lazy sex scenes. The characters still treat each other with the requisite malice and distaste, but the spark seems to be going out. (Thankfully I'm in Season 4 now and things are back to normal.)  The production values are shoddy, the humor is weak/scatological, the satire is diluted, the new characters are boring and killed quickly or hang around far too long (one S. Graff--BORING)) All in all, a trite effort from such a promising, fledgling series.",1267315200,,744,5.048780487804878
3387456,4,B00166UFSY,"Showtime's ""Weeds"" continues its comic savaging of Suburbia with Season 3.  This new season opens with the resolution of Season 2's definitive cliff-hanger - a Mexican standoff with all the guns pointed at Nancy Botwin, America's favorite amateur pot dealer.

Season 3 sees the Widow Botwin and her extended family of misfits, fools, and noblemen plunge even deeper into the maelstrom of having everything you've worked for ripped asunder.  Whether it's losing a beloved spouse, saying good-bye to a cherished job, or even leaving a loveless-but-comfortable marriage, everyone in Season 3 seems to be losing something . . . and we're not talking just a few toes here.

Through it all, Ms. Botwin soldiers on with her unique combination of bravado, naivete, and occasional ruthlessness.  If you're a fan of ""Weeds,"" Season 3 offers more of the same - extremely funny dialogue, rampant and bizarre sexual affairs, the occasional spot of violence, and plot developments so ""out there"" that they work.

It's believably resolved and new predicaments are immediately introduced.  Nancy seems on the verge of losing it at times, yet always survives with bedraggled grace and concessions to various foils here and there.  The third season never gets as dark as the previous season, and Nancy has grown more confident from all the scrapes she's endured, laying things down more often on her own terms.  On the less appealing side, sometimes the eccentricities of some of the other characters became a substitute for truly inventive writing, and seemed almost like a condescension to an audience the writers assumed might not notice the difference.  The prime example is this business with her younger son Shane talking to an invisible entity he claimed was his dead father.  From the very first season, I never liked these touchy-feely segues with the kids, and this was the worst yet.  Because the show tries at times to be too quirky, I was distracted by wondering how far the writers were willing to go with this nonsense, that the series, while thinking it's cutting-edge, might devolve into the truly ridiculous.  It was annoying to have to consider how this bit of silliness will conclude.  Regardless of what it turns out to be, it's an absurd divergence from what I watch this series for.  It's not even remotely believable that a boy his age would be enthralled to an overactive imagination to this degree; and it would be just plain stupid if he's not and there's an actual poltergeist about.  Whichever they pick, neither works, as neither fits in with the rest of the series.  Still, it's a series with a lot of other hooks, and we watched the entire third season in two days.

Unlike the second season, there was no dire cliffhanger in the finale.  It ties up nicely, with some intriguing possibilities dangling in front of Nancy, with no exigent circumstances attached. The series could have ended right there.  However, there was in fact&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/a-fourth-season/dp/B001AQBGM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">a fourth season</a>, and it's due out on DVD in June.  From the clip I've seen, it appears that it'll be even darker than the 2nd season, with Nancy joining an established smuggling ring.

The Blu-ray suffers the same flaws as the second season, in that the palette gets too smeary or too yellow in bright light.  Some facial details are lost behind the glare of the oversaturation.  I've checked with Blu-ray review sites and they've noted the same thing.  Why this series can't get a great transfer that could be recommended on its own right is probably due to the original film elements.  Like most series, clarity -- not cinematography -- is the main objective.  However, it looks great most of the time, and the price was too good to pass up.  At the time I ordered this set, it was cheaper than the standard definition DVDs.

It should be noted that the second disc of the set operated peculiarly.  Instead of returning to the episode list when an episode ended, the episode started over.  Not a big deal, because you could still access the menu manually.  That wasn't the case, however, when I tried to watch an extra feature titled ""Kush Kush and Away.""  It wouldn't play, and instead went through the entire loading cycle for the disc, returning to the topmost menu.  Amazon exchanged it, but the replacement had the same error.  So obviously there's a defect through at least a batch of these discs, if not the whole line.

Among the other extras that DID work was a faux public-access talk show called ""Good Morning, Agrestic,"" hosted by the series characters Dean Hodes (Andy Milder) and Pam (the goody-two-shoes busybody played by Becky Thyre), interviewing other characters from the series.  Produced strictly as an extra feature for this disc, it was a goofy affair, having a video-taped deadness to it.  It didn't gel.  Parker was conspicuously missing from the fun.  Justin Kirk (who plays Andy Botwin) gets a separate special feature titled ""Uncle AWOL,"" in which he acts the prima donna, encouraged by two lovely young sycophantic assistants.  It, too, was just so-so.

3387512,3,B00166UFSY,"Like Little Children, American Beauty, and Edward Scissorhands, Weeds portrays a planned community as a forgotten circle of Dante's Inferno.  Suburban life really isn't the gated paradise the brochures from the housing committee promise; rather, it's a cesspool of petty people with too much money and nothing to do with their lives.  We've see these kinds of shows and movies before.  What's unique about Weeds is that there really aren't any sympathetic characters.  Even the children in the show come off as selfish demons (who seem far too wise and ironic for their respective ages).  The cast is superb.  The things they do and say make you alternately cringe, laugh, and open your mouth wide to say, ""He did not just do that!""  And it's worth mentioning that the end credits to each episode generally feature a very funny and sometimes dirty folk or pop song that serves as an audio metaphor for the entire episode.  I enjoy the show's attempt to tell a quirky and increasingly unrealistic tale that must be a tremendous challenge for the writers.

On the other hand, the show doesn't evolve much further than a writer's delight: So much of the dialogue is simply a stream of creative, new curse words and phrases.  These start off as shocking and funny, but the veneer wears thin when you realize that it's just a device to divide your attention from the fact that very little is happening in the show, because all of the characters are made of the same selfish mold.  It reminds me of how Family Guy uses the same device in nearly episode: Something happens and Peter will be reminded of the time when he [fill in the blank], and the show proceeds to randomize the plot with a barely relevant flashback.  Again, funny for a while, but it gets old fast.

I should say that I'm not at all put off by Weed's liberal politics, with which I tend to sympathize, and which is probably the most consistent (biased?) part of the show.  Yet something essential is missing from the discussions on race, immigration, drug trafficking, teen pregnancy, single motherhood, suburban life, religion, draft dodging, and so on.  In the end, I have a sinking feeling that the show itself is selfish.  The show, like the characters in it, wants to gate itself off from the views of dissenters like conservatives and the religious.  But that's the way extremism works: Just as fundamentalism breeds no irony and imposes a black/white morality onto humanity, material secularism obfuscates personal responsibility and self-discipline.  In short, the show preaches to the choir who thinks the world would be better if everyone was a little higher, and the show only rarely entertains the possibility that maybe that's not really true either.",1233532800,3,2725,4.848812095032398

3387520,3,B00166UFSY,"I like the show and we sailed through Vol III in about a week's time, but it is pretty forgettable!  Nothing in the previous seasons prepared us for the unbelievable dips in the storytelling, particularly those involving Andy, Nancy's affable, ne-er-do-well brother in law.  If I was the actor, I would be crying every day, realizing that a once promising part had apparently led the writers into thinking they could just ask me to do anything and my contract would require me to do it.  There's no other excuse for the Andy joins the army storyline or even worse, the one in which Andy joins the adult film industry by using his foot.  It is a black mark on TV, though who knows, some may think it funny.

It's almost as though they have one crew of writers for two weeks, then another one comes along and sweeps everything out.  How about Nancy longing for friends and growing obsessed, to the point of sketching her repeatedly on a pad of paper, with her husband's former wife and stalking to stalk her so that they can be pals?  And whatever did happen to the money both women were searching for?  They just dropped it, probably because they were fired.  I don't know how the actors keep track of how they're supposed to be feeling and who they've not slept with by this point.  Mary Kate Olsen -- lots of bad karma.  Matthew Modine -- not appealing.

Never thought I'd say this, but I'm getting tired of drugs, and also tired of the way WEEDS, which seemed like sort of a progressive show to begin with, treats its black actors and characters.  They are either Mandingo type studs, or drug mules, or dumb as posts.  When Conrad and Nancy had their big lovemaking scene, where she's sitting down and he's standing before her, the camera just gawks at his naked hips grinding away, as though his butt was the biggest thing ever to appear on TV.  And then cut away, and then back to it.  It's still playing in some lunatic chamber of my mind.",1231372800,2,1944,4.4645892351274785

3387524,5,B00166UFSY,"THE CONTENT: I'll put it this way.  This is the longest season of Weeds so far, and I watched it ten times faster than any season before it.  In two days, I'd muscled through all fifteen episodes, which make have contributed in small part to how COMPLETE the thing just felt.  Like no season of the show before it, it tests all the characters and takes the story to the next level.  While all of the other seasons were almost sinfully entertaining, this one is so excellent in all levels, from character development to the intricate plot that picks up on the cliffhanger that ended&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-Two/dp/B000Q6GUKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season Two</a>&nbsp;and produces the most cohesive story so far.  This brings everything from the first two seasons together for such an incredible climax that it makes me want to watch the whole Weeds catalogue all over again.  While it's not pitch perfect (as funny as the Andy military stuff was, it was a bit too much for me to buy), it's the best season so far.  Superbly acted (I mean... Mary-Louise Parker... c'mon Emmys), humbly but excellently written, and visually stunning, Weeds is one of the best shows out there.

THE PACKAGE: I get the whole going green thing.  I even think the fact that Weeds went green is a bit funny.  However, I stopped getting it and I certainly stopped laughing when I realized that this flimsy, recycled packaging causes the DVDs to fall about and get scratched.  As sympathetic as I am to the cause... I don't want to keep buying the third season of Weeds over and over because the box can't hold a DVD.  A show this superb deserves packaging that will support it, and Weeds was not given that.  They should re-release this in the same format as the first and second seasons, because this is truly a disservice to the loyal fans.  The packaging is obviously rated a negative... let's just say fifteen, but that has no impact on how many stars I give this.  Just let this passage serve as a warning that the packaging is awful... the worst I've ever seen.

3387529,3,B00166UFSY,"You've heard the drill in these TV-on-DVD reviews: if you liked the first two seasons of Showtime's ""Weeds"", you should like the third.  Having said that, season three isn't inspiring me to write a jump-for-joy, rave-filled review.  For one thing, I can cut a break for a widowed soccer mom forced to deal drugs for a while to make ends meet, but Nancy has been doing this for going on three years now, if not longer.  I know that one doesn't have to admire what a series character does to enjoy a particular show (I like ""Dexter"" and ""The Sopranos"", after all), but for some reason it's bugging me that Nancy continues to embrace criminal behavior.  I know, I know... it's a silly criticism of a show that's not really meant to be taken seriously.  It's probably because Nancy is cute and fun and an otherwise good mom that I want her to stop being a felon.

Also, the season-long story thread was a bit choppy this time, with plotlines starting up and then quickly abandoned, or left unsatisfyingly under-explored.  In the case of the brief, pointless ""Andy grabbed by the army"" plotline, that one shouldn't have even started in the first place (though I admit it did have a laugh or two).  Another missed opportunity was the presence of those usually-reliable-for-laughs cable comedy mainstays: loony evangelicals.  But even here there were misfires.  Oddly, in the episodes where the crazed born-agains appeared, they either weren't ridiculed enough or were ridiculed too much (which isn't easy, let me tell you).  Never a happy medium.  Weird, huh?

Good moments?  Yep, still a lot of them.  Celia's husband and Councilman Doug finding ways to work on a porn movie set, and their response to being there, are a riot.  Good-looking women in those episodes, too.  And speaking of good looking, Mary-Louise Parker remains cute as a button.  But I think I said that already.

The ""Weeds, Season Three"" DVD delivers fifteen episodes (the longest season to date), some commentary tracks, and a few goofy extras of no real consequence.  The episodes look and sound great.

I still like ""Weeds"", and will seek out the fourth season when it comes out on DVD (it helps that there's a pretty interesting close to the season, which genuinely makes us ask, ""what will these characters do next?""), but I'm hoping that the show's junior year mild slump is only temporary.  If season four gets fully back on track, mainly by delivering sharper, interesting storylines on a more consistent basis, I won't even mind if Nancy still keeps dealing drugs.  Which is pretty much a given anyway, I'm guessing.",1226275200,4,2590,4.8099547511312215

I thought this season showed us a new side of many characters, Celia, Silas, Shane, Andy and Dean.  I liked how the cliff hanger from season 2 was dealt with.  And in each half hour there was enough drama that at the end of each show you were ready to watch the next one to see what was going to happen.

My only complaint with Weeds is that the plot seems to be repeating with regards to Nancy and nearly getting caught selling, then her being in debt to someone etc.  I've finished season 4, and that's what has made me a little dismayed at the fact that it does seem to be the same formula over & over...but I'm waiting till Season 5 to make up my mind on that.

3387538,3,B00166UFSY,"The third season of Weeds is extremely uneven in its execution. The stories seem to start at one place, begin to progress in a particular direction and then end abruptly with no real resolution.
We begin the season with our protagonist, Nancy, being held at gunpoint in a standoff between two drug gangs, a tense situation that is resolved in a fairly lame fashion. She then becomes the pupil of a violent gangster who treats her like his little sister, after suggesting to another character that he intends to rape her, but this plot line too is just dropped.
A ridiculous subplot about Nancy Botwin's brother-in-law being accepted into the army, with a wound that would clearly exempt him from service (missing most of the toes from one foot), again goes nowhere, being dropped almost immediately.
I love this show and even found some humor in the antics of the characters in the third season, but the story telling in this season could have been so much stronger.

That's the way Season 2 worked, and that is the way they planned for this season to work. But they cut some corners, or used some substandard material, or something that didn't work as I tried it with 2 DVD players and 2 sets of Season 3 of ""Weeds"" and it did not work in any player on any back side of ""Weeds"" Season 3. I have read of other people with the same problems. I returned it. The season content was a major disappointment anyway, so I am well glad to be rid of the whole thing. The whole ""Weeds"" scenario just keeps going from bad to worse.

  Even if the Side B's were able to be viewed, it is doubtful that those missing episodes could save this ""Dark Season."" Nancy is my girl, but when will she wise up and get down to business? She cannot afford to have friends and she cannot afford to be financially kind to her friends. What was she trying to do with Agent Wonder Bread's Ex-start a Disney movie? She got into the the life for the money for the kids and she needs to stop messing around in the Latte Circuit and concentrate on Business. Burning down California wasn't such a stretch-I was just glad they did not film yet another actor watching the fire with himself well in hand-again. There is way too much guys taking matters into their own hands and thinking that this junior high humor is big time funny again and again, when really, an allusion to it may be chuckle worthy once, maybe twice. ""Weeds 3"" runs it into the ground and it is no longer funny. They do a lot of things that way..

3387560,4,B00166UFSY,"Weeds is really an interesting show. The show itself examines life in a way  that is kind of fair while being pretty amusing.
as the program has progressed we've seen some changes
not a huge surprise for a family supposedly adjusting to life in an underground world of semi-exceptable behavior.over the course of the season some things do get slightly blown out of preportion
or exaggerated. I guess this has to happen to not only show the changes that take place living life on the black market. But also to kep the show moving.
I Recomend this DVD highly-however to be fair I strongly suggest that the show be watched from begginning to end in other words get season 1,season 2 then this.
tuning in to season 3 might seem a bit out of context for a person who isn't familiar with the show.
I have seen that many Dope smokers like the show.
I think that may suggest some basis for reality in some of the suggestions made by the stereotypes.
on the other hand if your just interested in a good Drama/comedy  with a rather uniuqe social angle. I think you'll be more likely to enjoy Weed's than not.
I have some limited history with Pot smoking in high school and early college
and have met some people that remind me  very much of some of those people depicted in the show.
I also have run across many of these ""Types"" in my Non Stoned life.
the Story line is very fresh,funny and keeps you interested without being overly ""Stonerish"" while still probably being pretty funny to those that can apreciate ""stoner humor"" .

What could be more American than Mom, apple pie, and weed in the grow house?!  I started watching this gem of a show because of Mary Louise-Parker.  I've continued watching because of the fine ensemble acting, stellar writing, and general shock and awe fun of it all.  What more can happen to 'Lacy LaPlante'?  If ever there was a living, breathing example of Murphy's Law in action, it is Weeds.
Season One, episode one got me hooked....um....addicted....um....made me a fan.  Season Two just strengthened my addiction....my love/hate affair with Agresstic and all the characters who stream on and off camera.  Season Three got me fired up and anxiously awaiting the buzz of season four.
Whether or not you have ever been in that life or known anyone in that life or even like people in that life, the superb direction, the phenomenal scripts, and the amazing cast make this a character study for even the most straight-laced right-wingers.

When I bought the first series of Weeds, it took me a few episodes to really get into it, after which I was totally hooked.  Season 2 was equally brilliant and season three certainly didn't disappoint.  All the characters have fully expanded into the extreme of their type - which is exactly what I would expect of an entertaining show.  This is not reality - this is an extremely funny parody of stereotype characters.  For viewers to suddenly get moralistic about various aspects of the comedy, such as not showing religious fundamentalists in their positive light, completely misses the point.  I, for one, am very grateful that the writers have not degenerated into the mire of political correctness that has completely ruined many a good comedy in the past.  (Not to mention life in general)

3387579,1,B00166UFSY,"I loved the first 2 seasons of Weeds. 3--not so much.

For starters none of the characters are very likable. The characters have always been different shades of gray (which is what has always made them so interesting), but with season 3 several of the characters just become too unlikable to make me care about them. I always found Nancy likable enough, and her story interesting enough, that her story was enjoyable to follow. Not so with season 3. Nancy is annoying, overly-promiscuous, arrogant, a bad parent, and nearly void of any and all morals. She just doesn't have enough redeeming qualities for her to remain a good protagonist. In fact, I can't think of any redeeming qualities the character has this season. Maybe persistence? That still isn't anywhere close enough to make up for scene after scene of Nancy constantly, and uncaringly, hurting the people around her. (Also, she usually follows up by throwing a temper tantrum and trying to blame the other person, and even though the other characters sometimes buy her blame-reversing rants, her logic just never seems to work as well from this side of the screen.)

Writing-wise season 3 is also much more inferior to the first 2 seasons. Several of the stories end up going nowhere and serving no purpose other than to be cute; the way new characters are introduced is always sudden, stupid, and contrived; and several characters throughout the season behave in such unbelievable and absurd ways that it makes it hard to go along for the ride.

I thought the first two season were really clever, with season 3, however, it seems they've turned it all in for cheap laughs.

The one redeeming thing about the show is the ending. The ending is really good--especially if you're someone like me who isn't planning on returning for season 4. The ending makes it really easy to walk away from the show, which is what I'm doing. ""Kooky Nancy"" and her ""wacky troubles"" have just become too stupid for me to care about.

I hate to say it because I absolutely loved the first 2 seasons, but Weeds REALLY jumped the shark with season 3.

Yes the 6 episode resolution to the Season 2 cliffhanger might have been a bit overdone, but a lot of it was funny.

But unlike other reviewers, I found it thoroughly entertaining, proving one doesn't need to smoke pot to appreciate it. Sure, there are some missteps along the way, but one thing about a show is that is always changing. It is evident that Weed's take on suburbia was starting to get repetitive. I did however, still get a kick out of stuff like the huge cross and the new town of Majestic. So enjoy this season for what it is. Hit and miss, but mainly entertaining.

The characters are all here, (perhaps too many for a 26 min an episode show) and they generally act like themselves but the overall lack of character development coupled with very convenient writing which has many acting completely out of character drain the life from an otherwise amazingly entertaining show.  Eventually turning into a satire of itself Weeds Season 3 goes from decent to maudlin and revives the spirit of renewal in its final episode, perhaps too late however.  The people I used to care about start making ridiculous decisions, as the writing becomes basically a filmed graphic novel with outrageous plot twists set in motion to further situations and happenings that just border on the inane or downright unbelievable.  Shanes character becomes the breath of fresh air as he expresses the writers general feeling toward our culture and social climate, but it is almost too much coming from a kid his age.  Again it is a fine entertainment value overall the BluRay discs look great and the extras are fun, Kush Kush and Away is a great little diverison (flash game) but in the end I was glad I rented rather than bought this season, and Season 1 will probably be the only one I keep in my collection.  Great TV compared to what is on, but really could have been SO much better if they had stayed a little more grounded and focused on fewer characters.

I was nervous going in because I had heard from various people that season three wasn't as good, but after I got watching I was not at all sure what the fuss was about, the show is pushing itself and growing in new directions like it needs to if it's going to survive. The show challenges you to think about ""drugs,"" what's right and wrong, and examines the inter-workings of suburbia with such cleverness that I am always pleasantly surprised.

Nancy Botwin is the perfect character, you love her, but sometimes want to slap her. Parker is an amazing actress and makes this show work from beginning to end. I also love her youngest Shane, he's excellent this season and glad to see him getting more and more airtime. This show is both funny and heartbreaking and blows most shows on TV right now out of the water.

 I'm really excited to see how season 4 plays out. I think it's a great sign that they are breaking out of the ""little boxes.""

Don't listen to the negative reviews. If you liked season 1 and 2 you will love season 3!",1213315200,48,1191,4.4

3387589,4,B00166UFSY,This third season of Weeds was one that I laughed at more than the others.  It is not better than the first two but I would still recommend it.  ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** I think this could be the last season of Weeds for some(possibly myself) as it kind of leaves you with an ending where you feel the characters will be fine.  I don't feel as though it would need to continue.  I have also heard that Conrad and Heylia are not going to be a part of the main cast this next season which is really disappointing! Weeds just won't be the same without them and I think this will disappoint some viewers.,1213228800,2,596,4.247787610619469
3387590,4,B00166UFSY,"Okay, Nancy Botwin herself might be included in the category of nefarious nitwits; that's only fair.  She is so very naive about the world of drug dealing, and finds out just how much she doesn't know in this third season of the series.
She has experiences with U-Turn and Marvin that are both hilarious and unpleasant, and then along comes Guillermo, a new kind of thug who ends up wreaking havoc on Agrestic/Majestic that Nancy never imagined.
Celia is by turns sympathetic and hateful, given her behavior towards her former husband and their daughter; yet we can also see how much she wants to love someone and how she drowns her sorrows in alcohol.
Kevin Nealon, for my money, is the one who really shines. The SNL alum does his best and funniest work here as Nancy's CPA.
I'm surprised to say this, but Mary-Kate Olsen does a nice job as Silas's religious girlfriend.
Alexander Gould as Shane gets more screen time, and it is well deserved.  It's too bad that he and Celia's kid couldn't have spent more time in the religious school, where they were shaking things up.
Yes, things change drastically by the end of the season, but there's nothing wrong with that.  They couldn't stay in their little boxes forever.  Now we will have a long wait to see what transpires in their new location in S. 4.",1213142400,2,1302,4.599137931034483
3387591,2,B00166UFSY,"I saw that Season 3 of Weeds had come out recently, and was tempted to purchase it as I had thoroughly enjoyed Seasons 1 and 2.  However, since I own way too many DVDs that I will never watch again, I opted to be patient and Netflix it instead.  I'm so glad I didn't buy this, as it will never get a repeated viewing from me.

There was an excellent cliff-hanger at the end of Season Two, although if the truth be told, even by that point things were getting a little too crazy in the show (but I was still left completely engaged).  After the first couple of episodes of Season 3, however, I started to get a sinking feeling.  It turned into a show about gangsters and thugs, and was a far cry from the 'soccer Mom who deals pot in suburbia' that the series began as.  Sure, there are still some funny parts, and I guess they were enough to make me get through the Season (but just barely), but even Doug and Andy's antics became a little too unbearable and ridiculous to fully enjoy.  There are so many plot twists that simply don't make sense, and many subplots that don't go anywhere and have no place in the series (what the heck did Andy's stint in the Army have to do with ANYTHING?).  Issues get 'resolved' in the most ludicrous ways; it almost feels like the writers want the show to be dumb.  I feel the show 'jumps the shark' a million times and becomes too unrealistic to take seriously.  As another reviewer stated, sometimes the show feels almost 'cartoony'.

I was glad after the last episode was done.  It was a hard watch, but for some reason I felt I had to see it through until the end.  For me the season finale felt like it wrapped the entire series up, and I don't care where Nancy goes now that Agrestic is up in flames.  I am done with Weeds, and I will not watch Season 4.  It's really a shame to know that a series that started off so strong sunk so low.  But this seems to be the trend all too often.

As for the DVD quality itself, of course the picture and sound are excellent.  I can't comment on commentaries or other special features, as I had no interest in watching/listening to them.",1213142400,21,2118,4.239401496259352
3387592,1,B00166UFSY,"Don't get me wrong, I love WEEDS, and have every season avaliable on DVD. I was very happy when I got this DVD, I had never seen Season 3 and was anxious to watch it. However, I was shocked when I saw the ""Green packaging"" thing on the back cover... yay, another cheap cardboard package. This is every bit as bad as the ""There Will Be Blood"" packaging... and that's saying something. It took me about 20 minutes to get disc 1 out alone!!! I am never putting the DVDs back in that case again... I put the DVDs in regular CD cases after getting them out. The discs came out all scratched too when I finally got them out. It's like one of those ""expanded"" hallmark cards just with DVDs thrown in. I know it's good that they care for the enviroment, but geez, give us a decent DVD package!!",1212451200,5,786,4.211920529801325

3387594,4,B00166UFSY,"Weeds is a great show, but with the Blu-ray DVD Disc having the compacity to hold 50 Gigabytes of space why not put the entire season on 1 Disc and not having to wast Blu-ray DVD Disc due to the 50 Gigabyte Compacity. Why use 3 Blu-ray Discs when you have more than enough space to use on 1 Blu-ray Disc

1 season of any tv show can be put on 1 Blu-ray DVD",1211846400,4,356,3.810810810810811
3387595,2,B00166UFSY,"I'm assuming anyone reading this already has a grasp on what the series is about and the basic characters around this. To recap, the show surrounds the life of Nancy Botwin and her attempts to acquire enough money to keep up with her rich lifestyle. Her occupation: pot dealer. Naturally Season's 1 and 2 capitalized on the obvious plotline here which is how to get a business going, keeping the secret from the right people, and still being a Mom at the same time.

One would think that Season's 2 finale gave them plenty to work with. Nancy is caught up in a Mexican Standoff with drug dealers on a deal going poorly because Cilas stole the pot she was about to sell. To make things worse, Cilas is on the verge of getting busted by Ceila and the cops for possession of the motherload of all pot, while Shane is with some crazy loon on a trip to Mexico.

I won't go into too many specific details of the series, because doing so would ruin the cliffhanger that those who don't have showtime haven't seen. But the biggest complaint is that the character storylines are completely changed and abandoned throughout the season. You see Andy for instance have a brief run-in with the army again and try out a porn career none of which has anything to do with Nancy or her secret. Shane's purpose in the series, along with Ashley Olsen, who is seen in 3 episodes for 10 minutes each (tops) seem largely irrelevant to everything. Perhaps my biggest problem with this season is that the series might have jumped the shark. Nancy's secret for (while keeping details out to the greatest extent possible) becomes ""too public;"" too many people know she deals and grows, so the tension that existed in Season's 1 or 2 completely dissipates.

With all this said, there are some highlights are Season 3. Doug Wilson and the drug dealers Nancy encounter are hilarious and definitely provide some good comic relief. And the new town Majestic, an even richer and ""better"" Agrestic (and more Christian) provides some good ridicule of the ultra-religious right (even though it does get a little repetative). Even Andy's various storylines, if pointless, do make great comedy.

All-in-all, Weeds is still funny but the the episodes and characters in them lack any sort of direction or unity, which significantly hampers its enjoyability. Weeds this season seems more like a cartoon comedy like Family Guy; Weeds wants to have a new funny skit to put on each episode, but keeps running into the problem that it must continue from past episodes, and keep a story going.",1211414400,32,2548,4.70627802690583
3387596,5,B00166UFSY,"Season Three cranks up the action and raises the stakes another notch, piling up the trouble on everyone.  Sure it all becomes a little more fantastical this season, but the satire of self-righteous suburbanites gets even more biting and scathing.  The dash of extra vinegar is delicious.  Nancy's deal with Guillermo (involving the trunk in episode 7) is pure genius.  Her second disastrous deal, leading to the season finale, is stupefying.
I love the way Nancy capitalizes on the way people underestimate her.  Her apparent naivete is her ace.
The kids' involvement in the operation (including Isabel, ultimately) is both charming and disturbing.
I'm ready for season four!  The soundtracks to seasons 1 & 2 also rock.",1210982400,14,721,5.119658119658119
