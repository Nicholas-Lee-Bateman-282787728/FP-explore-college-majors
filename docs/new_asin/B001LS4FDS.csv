8319668,5,B001LS4FDS,"This is another great Tae Bo basic workout,recorded live at Billy Blank`s World Training center. It is from 1999 and it is 30 minutes long. This is great for people who are just getting started working out with Tae Bo or any other fitness program,of course the people who want to start a serious vigorous, serious sweating,hard core workout. As a boxer in training and somebody who has struggled with weight problems throughout my childhood these Tae Bo workouts really get me fired up. These Tae Bo live workout series including Basic,Advanced,and the 8 minute workouts are some of the best workouts ever put out in  workout video series. They have the best moves that are easy to follow but let me tell you they are not easy,they are probably the most rushed up series of punches and kicks that I have ever done. I am saying this is the real deal without all the fancy hard to follow moves which are just confusing and get really boring to me. This is Tae Bo live Volume 1 basic,this is the volume in the basic series that is the best introduction to the great sweating power of the Tae Bo working out method. After doing this you will feel the power and all you women will feel like nobody could mess with you. Pilates and yoga are a great way to get your stretching in and get you flexible but it will not give weight loss results or give you that great muscle look and strength. Only a workout like Tae Bo and other vigorous sweating workouts can give you the results you want along with a good diet,not starving yourself and sitting on the couch. And I think you can get what you want to get done with these workouts. Tae Bo live Basic Volume 1 is a great workout with the classic punching and kicking and of course floor work for the abs and the glutes. And Billy Blanks makes it easy for you with his great instruction and teaching. So Tae Bo live Basic Volume 1 is a must have if you want to get in serious shape.",1283904000,3,1922,4.338888888888889
