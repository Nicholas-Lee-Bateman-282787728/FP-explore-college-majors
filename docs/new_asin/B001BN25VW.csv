But when I went to watch it, I couldn't believe how different cartoons are today to back when I was a kid.  The animation had to be cool way back when, but now it's a joke.  I found myself laughing at how easily amused I must have been as a kid, rather than having a nice moment of nostalgia that I hoped for.",1388188800,2,405,3.7857142857142856

3495446,5,B001BN25VW,"I don't know exactly what makes this series so awesome, but it could be the fact that I grew up with it- AND that I don't need to be on any kind of drug to understand the plot, the animation, and/or the main characters. Sometimes, it's just comforting to know that in almost all of the 80's era of cartooning, the line between good and bad is clear cut, and the good guys always won. I don't quite get the physics of Limbo space (there's obviously plenty of air to breathe, and you somehow fall DOWN when The Mob knocks you out of Seymour's cab), but it's still fun to watch. Also: Slythe's great-great-(great x 1000) grandson makes a pretty mean engineer (Thundercats fans will know what I mean).

For great old-school cartooning, this is definitely worth the purchase. =)",1381104000,,773,4.521428571428571
3495447,5,B001BN25VW,"An evil planet master named Mon-Starr leads a cornucopia of nefarious mobsters through Limbo (some inter-dimensional pocket universe that's so many light years from a future earth). They terrorize Limbo with racketeering, robbery, and all (the usual crimes associated with intergalactic mobs), and disturb the chief commander of Limbo's Justice Department (an old space patrolman named Bert Stargazer). He enters a plea to the future earth's government, asking them to send up some help. And the government's Science and Military Department takes a citizen of a planet of mutes, an airman, athletic fraternal twins and a musician/jet pilot, and turns them into the SilverHawks Anti-Crime Unit. And these SilverHawks rocket to Limbo, joins Stargazer at HawkHaven (their new homebase), acquire TallyHawk and other bionic attack birds, and proceed to thwart Mon-Starr's Mob at every turn.
Quicksilver, The Copper Kid, Steelheart, Steelwill, Bluegrass, Hotwing, Condor, Moonstriker, and Flashback, make an impressive law enforcement team. They all have distinctive characters, and are good fighters. And they face a good set of villains. But despite the good animation and storytelling, 'SilverHawks' has a little way to go before it becomes another Thundercats.",1377388800,,1258,5.661375661375661
3495448,4,B001BN25VW,"Other than Transformers, my personal favorite 80's cartoon.  SilverHawks has one of the greatest openings and theme songs of the 80's and some of the neatest character designs, but there are some glaring flaws.  The main characters are portrayed either flat or buffoonish and at some point the show becomes more about Semour the cab driver and Zeek the Beek.  If the show had been written as well as it was designed, it would've been the greatest action cartoon of its era.  Alas...",1375833600,,482,4.771084337349397

The show itself is pure nostalgia.  I used to watch this show when I got home from school as a kid.  Looking back now, I do wonder what I was thinking, but none the less, I enjoyed it.

The show really is Thundercats in space.  Even the way the show is drawn and the main villians transformation is the same!  lol.

3495476,5,B001BN25VW,"I recently purchased SilverHawks, Vol. 1 for a bit of 80's animation nostalgia. I loved this cartoon as a kid and was happy to discover that I loved it as an adult too. The SilverHawks are a retrofied spaced-out off shoot of the ThunderCats. It was created by Rankin-Bass Productions, Inc, the masterminds behind ThunderCats, who, ironically used many of the same voice actors for both cartoons.  Rankin-Bass was responsible for other animated favorites like the Christmas animated nightmares of Rudolph, The Little Drummer Boy, Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town, and Frosty The Snowman. They also created the aquaticly awesome off shoot of the ""Cats"", TigerSharks.

Much like ThunderCats, The SilverHawks battle an evil nemesis, who transforms into a creature of doom and destruction. Except he never gets to really destroy anything, because the ThunderCats...uh...I mean SilverHawks are always there to stop him. Mum-Ra - oops, sorry again, I mean Mon*Star  (come on, both characters were voiced by Earl Hammond) has a motley crew of misfits to help him wreak havoc on the cosmos. My favorite is Melodia, the siren of the stratosphere. She's like a marriage between Joan Jett and Cyndi Lauper. Much like their feline counters the SilverHawks were comprised of rag-tag team of three men, one lady and an alien mime! The plunky Snaf, was recast as a heartless metal beast known as Tally Hawk. Actually the whole mess of them have scary bird beasts but they are rarely seen, as aposed to Tally Hawk who is featured in some way in almost every episode.

The DVD is a collection of the shows first  32 awesome cartoons. The introduction of most all of the major characters are contained on the collection's four discs. Episode 21, ""Hotwing Hits Limbo"" is one of my favorite episodes. The cartoons are all roughly the same plot, bad guys do something bad - SilverHawks kinda beat them up. Next episode they do it all over again. Nevertheless, I find SilverHawks, much as I did ThunderCats - a fantastic animated masterpiece with 3 dimensional characters and great stories.  Make no mistake,  Rankin-Bass were amazing storytellers if nothing else.  I highly recommend this collection of cartoons if you ever watched the show in the 80s or if you have any love whatsoever for 80s cartoons.",1354492800,,2279,4.947643979057592
3495477,4,B001BN25VW,"When I was a kid, along with Transformers, Thundercats, and Voltron, Silverhawks was one of THE shows to watch. There's just something about 80s cartoons that you can't get with modern shows. They were more inventive and original. Even when they weren't original, they gave it their own little twists to make it entertaining...which Silverhawks does in spades. The dvd case was a surprise. I wasn't expecting, from the pictures online, that there would be a slipcover or that it would be shiny and bumply. Very cool. Just wish that the second, and last, volume wasn't so expensive.",1352505600,,581,4.938775510204081

This was delivered on time without scratches or marks and I was extremely giddy when this came in. Silverhawks is a great childhood classic that I used to watch every weekend with my family and every now and then I find myself humming the song. I've already watched it several times and I can't ge enough of my childhoos cartoons and I am so happy that they are on DVD now.,1343865600,,529,4.145631067961165

3495493,5,B001BN25VW,I remember this great cartoon series as a youth. Excellent show(Some may not agree with this comment)but I thought and liked it better than the Thundercats. This cartoon series definetly represents what a 80's cartoon series is suppose to be like.,1336608000,,247,5.048780487804878
3495494,3,B001BN25VW,"I love this show but it isn't consistant. I don't know if the ""T Great Galaxy Race"" was out of order or not but in that episode Melodia was disinagrated by mistake, it was suppose to be the Copper Kid in his vehicle, but she was in episodes after that. How could she be disinegraded in one episode and healthy in later episodes. They brought on a new Silver Hawk, but they continued to use the same silver hawks without as if he never existed. And I don't like the way the episodes are listed. I have catarax and it is hard to see from my sofa. I have to get close to the tv to see the names of the spiodes. I wish they had the episode list bigger. And I also don't like the last disc being double-sided. If they wanted bonus features and there wasn't enough room on 4 one-sided discs then they should of had a 5 disc set. For these issues I had to take off 2 stars.",1333152000,2,866,4.011560693641618
3495495,4,B001BN25VW,I bought this as a gift for my brother and he loved it.  Brought back memories of being a kid in the 80's.,1331424000,,106,3.608695652173913
3495496,5,B001BN25VW,"Very awsome, love this series... The seller was also awsome lover ordering from them... Now I can relive my childhood over and over and over again thanx to this series!!!",1329782400,,170,4.7
3495497,4,B001BN25VW,"First I will start by saying that this was once of my favorite shows as a kid.  I remember when it was on (it followed ThunderCats), and it was a pretty unique show.  I do like that there is a mini documentary on the 4th DVD (this is a dual sided disc side A contains episodes 25-32, and side B contains the bonus features.  It is a bit surprising that they didn't create a dedicated disc 4 (for the episodes), and 5 (for the bonus features), but whatever.

I was really impressed at how fast this arrived at my door, and in only 2 1/2 days.  That's awesome.

Now why did I not give 5 stars?  When I was getting ready to remove the DVDs from the sleeve jacket I noticed a VERY nasty 3 inch cut on the upper back of the packaging (where the UPC code resides).

3495526,4,B001BN25VW,"Loved, loved, LOVED this underrated gem when I was young! A lot of members of today's audience complain quite a bit that this was a cheaply made knock-off of the more popular ""Thundercats"" (as pointed out in the interviews on the DVD, as Silverhawks was supposed to have been released first). And what would be wrong with that? In much the same way that Filmation was responsible for both He-Man and She-ra, Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass, the geniuses behind the creatively named Rankin/Bass, were responsible for both ""Thundercats"" and ""Silverhawks."" In essence, they are being accused of ripping off their own shows.

Anyway, back to the subject at hand. A lot of my favorite episodes are on this collection (""Journey to Limbo,"" ""One on One,"" ""Sky-Shadow,"" etc.) The minor complaint that I have though is that I owned ""The Origin Story"" (actually, five intertwined episodes) on VHS and, therefore, I know that roughly five minutes of the first two episodes is missing from the DVD release. I don't know if it was also missing from television broadcast and the DVDs are using abbreviated episodes or what the deal was but, clearly, a portion of ""Journey to Limbo"" (including a battle between my favorite villain, Mo-Lec-U-Lar, and hero, The Copper Kidd) was missing. Also, clearly, the title card is missing from ""Sky-Shadow."" These are minor inconveniences, however, and easily overlooked by the casual observer.

On to my major complaint as promised: while this is a nice opening collection with the first 32 of 65 episodes, I would kind of like to see Volume 2 eventually actually get released.

This show is slick.  From the rockin' intro to the cheesy yet fun-loving dialogue, you can't go wrong.  Yeah it's a bit old school... but I'll play hooky from the new stuff to watch this.

3495557,3,B001BN25VW,"Ah the 1980s, a period of great music, questionable fashion, and unrivaled animated series succession. Animation insiders are quick to point out that the early to mid 80s were a time of uncertainty thanks to organizations that insisted that most all cartoons were merely cleverly disguised advertisements designed to push toy-lines and yet its tough to argue the success of programs such as He-Man and the masters of the Universe, Thundercats, Transformers, and G.I. Joe. As a kid of the era, I wasn't complaining; after all, the cartoons were great source material for the action to continue in toy-form. Disguised advertisements or the inspiration for hours of imaginative play? Blurred is the line. But I digress. The reason you are likely reading this is to ascertain a better feel for Warner Brothers' recent DVD release of the 1986 hit cartoon series Silver Hawks.

From Rankin Bass, the individuals responsible for the wildly popular Thundercats series, Silverhawks was created to act as a follow-up with a slightly different dynamic and setting without straying too far from the animorphic roots that made its predecessor so successful. To begin with a confession, let me state for the record that I was not a fan of the show when it was new and nor did I have any of the corresponding toy line. Memory fades as to what series managed to distract me directly but I'm leaning toward Transformers or G.I. Joe. I did however manage to catch it on a rare occasion of channel surfing (after all, we did have only four to chose from at the time) and I recall thinking that it was similar in look and feel to Thundercats (a show that I did enjoy greatly).

Looking back there were a few things that didn't sit right back then and still manage to cause a cringe even now: For one thing the tagline ""Partly Metal and Partly Real"" never sounded quite right to me. Of course it was easily dismissed at age ten but these days I've come to realize that the little scientist in me must have been offended by its suggestion that metal is, for whatever reason, not real. Perhaps partly metal and partly human would have been a more scientifically correct wording or, and yes I know kids would have really hated this one: ""Partly metallic while still maintaining biological characteristics"" would have trumped them all.

Anyway, taglines aside, the show may have shared its animation quality and voice actors with Thundercats, the actual structure was a bit askew as well. Doing away with all of the unique fantasy elements that Thundercats brought to the table, Silverhawks focused a bit more on the science fiction side of things (even if the science was continually overrun by the fiction). Our heroes are, for lack of a better term, cyborg cops sent into space to do battle with a gang of intergalactic villainous mobsters. Even if we take that at face value (and even some Trekkies may have a hard time swallowing that one), there was nothing particularly engaging about the abundant cast on both sides of the coin. The gruff leader of the good guys was a Telly Savalas wannabe with some gold plating and a robot lens/ eye occupying half of his baldhead. Below him was perhaps the most generic good guy in the history of animated television in the form of the one-dimensional QuickSilver, a guitar-wielding, mohawk-sporting colonial Bluegrass, the male & female twin duo of Steelheart and Steelwill, and a coppery colored mute alien youngster creatively named The Copper Kid. Okay so maybe I'm exaggerating a bit- Copper Kid could communicate with a strange combination of English buried beneath a digital effect with some whistling thrown in for good measure.

The bad guys had a lot of potential that was, sadly, lost to either the restrictions of children's programming of the time or a simple overload of the production staff as it was later admitted that Silverhawks was actually sold into 65 episode syndication before the first episode of Thundercats even aired (a show that would go on to run a whopping 130 episodes itself).

The show's producers realized that if it wasn't broken, no need for repairs and kept the villain formula very close to its Thundercats baddies counterparts (Mon-Star's transformation bit, for example, is not at all unlike Mum-Ra's). Unfortunately much of the cast is completely devoid of any sense of personality. Take for example the intimating mechanical humanoid bull, Mumbo Jumbo, or the robotic assassin Buzzsaw- unlimited potential, terrible on-screen presence. These examples may actually fall into the rare category of toys being far cooler than the animated characters they attempt to emulate.

Cast aside, the story structure was usually quite basic: Mon-Star hatches up some ridiculous scheme to conquer the galaxy, the Silverhawks get wind of it and thwart his efforts without any real violence or confrontation to speak of. Each and every plot basically ends the same with the villains escaping to scheme up their next corrupt ambition while the heroes laugh off their folly in failing to get the job done. This is especially disappointing considering the very first episode (Origin Story) actually opens with some potential as Mon-Star has been apparently imprisoned for his crimes on the Penal Planet only to become exposed to the radiation that not only transforms him but allows him to break out (and take his buddies with him). Unfortunately, this bit of plot potential fades out immediately after and returns only momentarily in Episode 7, The Backroom.

For the most part the story falls victim to many of the same pitfalls and shortcomings that plagued earlier shows like Superfriends and Filmation's Masters of the Universe: One-dimensional characters, plots simplified to the lowest possible degree, wacky weapons (a guitar that jams lethal music notes and a corresponding key-tar wielding female). Side note: For those of you either too young to remember (or old enough but blocked the memory out), a key-tar is a synthesizer that was worn over the shoulder and played like a guitar so that keyboard geeks could get the kind of recognition usually reserved for the lead guitarist. If nothing else the 80s was a period that prided itself on looking out for the nerds in society.

Perhaps the biggest deviation from the Thundercats formula, however, would have to be the setting itself. Yes the eternal good versus bad (or in this case cops versus mobsters) takes place almost entirely in space. While this may have sounded appealing to the show's writers at the time considering the fact that space is infinite and all, in actuality it doesn't work very well at all on screen (a lesson Kevin Costner would learn much later on in filming his epic failure Waterworld). See it turns out that the backdrop for the action is, in many instances, as important as the action itself. Suffice to say, constant battles over a the drab background of space (blackness and stars) never really captivates the viewer the way a canyon battle or romp through the fortress like Thundercats did (even if the show's artists did try to use a lot of blue paint in attempt to break up the monotony of space).

Worse still is that the physics of space are inconsistent and downright inaccurate about 95% of the time. A crime that could be forgivable in children's animation if not for the closing of each episode with a quiz for the viewer about events and true science of our solar system. I can just imagine what Dr. William A. Gutsch Jr. of the Hayden Planetarium (who provided the scientific Q&A for the show) must have thought at the near-constant depictions of humans soaring through the vacuum of space without helmets, planets being a stone's throw apart, or evil space mobsters cruising around in convertibles (top down, solar wind blowing through their hair). Perhaps it's better that we don't know his exact sentiments after all!

If you've gotten this far and think that I'm being mercilessly cruel to what was ultimately intended to be good clean fun for kids, I'm just having some fun with it. Having just dropped $30 on this four-disc DVD compilation myself, I would have been sorely mistaken had I expected purchasing the equivalent of The Discovery Channel's Greatest Moments in animated form. This is mindless entertainment from a simpler time when children (well, most of them anyway) didn't worry about the nuances of science or physics. Partly metal, partly real, all that mattered was that they battled evil while your Pop Tarts were still warm.

Enclosed in this compilation are four discs containing the first 32 episodes of the show. Three of the four contain unique disc art while the fourth is dual sided to make room for a sweet little documentary/ commentary on how our metal friends came into existence and why they worked well as toys.

If you happen to be an astrophysicist looking for some conversation starters with the guys at work, perhaps you should look elsewhere. For nearly everyone else, this is cleverly disguised toy advertising at its best and the stuff of nostalgic induced dreams.",1231459200,11,9055,4.9188481675392675

3495583,5,B001BN25VW,"As someone who grew up in the greatest cartoon decade of all time, the 1980s, I was very excited to learn SilverHawks was getting out on DVD. It's just another classic to add to my ever increasing collection of classic toons (like complete Thundercats, Transformers, He-Man AND She-Ra, Ghostbusters, Defenders of the Earth, etc.).

The two characters I admired the most were the two musicians: Bluegrass with his Hot Licks guitar and Melodia with her Sound Smasher keyboard. In the case of Melodia, I nearly went out and bought a red-colored keyboard to be like her. It sure was fun to have those two go at each other with blue guitar notes vs. red keyboard notes. The best ep with these two is definitely ""Music of the Spheres,"" where they are battling for control of Halley's Comet (the big deal of 1986).

Oh, the fun of having the partly metal, partly real bunch back in the game all over again after around 22 years. Hey, Tally Hawk, go check on Mon*Star's bunch, will ya!?",1226016000,2,978,4.614942528735632
3495584,4,B001BN25VW,"This attractive 4-disc set comes in an embossed slip-cover box with metallic foil printing accenting the characters and text. The disc case is the thickness of a standard dvd, with two interior hinged flip 'pages' holding all four discs (vertically offset rather than laid directly back-to-back), all fashioned from clear (flexible) polypropylene to showcase the illustrated menu printed on the inside of the cover (similar to Sony's ""Transformers: the Movie"" 20th anniversary special edition dvd, if not prettier). The discs themselves likewise have an admirable design with their labels, using reflective text for the SilverHawks logo; the fourth disc (unfortunately) has no label because it's double-sided to hold the bonus features.  It all looks highly impressive as far as packaging goes, possibly scoring a new high in my dvd collection (if excluding deluxe box-set treatments).

Setting aside the package glamour, the dvds have eight episodes per disc.  Their menus are accompanied by the SilverHawks theme song and look appealing enough, but are not animated or anything fancy.  Although there's no mention of remastering work, picture and sound are pristine, with no apparent age artifacts apart from an occasioned darkness to some episodes (in particular, sections of ""The Bounty Hunter""); on a few of the middle episodes (eg., ""Darkbird"", ""Gold Shield""), a minor horizontal tracking flicker is visible along the topmost edge during the closing credit scroll. The show was not originally recorded in stereo, so it's all unseparated center-channel audio, with tracks in English, French, and Spanish, plus proper subtitles (not Closed Captioning) in English and Spanish.

Teaser preview segments (""...find out on today's exciting episode!"") are included prior to the intro sequence for each show, but there are no circa-1986 TV promo ads among the dvd extras, nor any toy commercials.  As with many other 80s cartoon dvd releases, the bumper segments (commercial lead-in / lead-out animation) have been omitted; in my opinion, some of the original broadcast drama is lost without the zing of those flashy bumpers.  Also, the first episode on disc 2, ""Sky-Shadow"", is missing its title card altogether.

The epilogue of each episode takes the format of an educational astronomy quiz. (...Did you know the Earth is 93 million miles from the sun?) For some reason, the lesson presented here for episode 2 is different from the one seen in the 1986 airing, whose Q&A were originally: 1.""Closest natural object to Earth? Moon""; 2.""Planet which makes closest approach to Earth? Venus""; 3.""Ringed planet with the most moons? Saturn.""  This absented segment is not found elsewhere on these discs -- I checked every episode, some of which have repeat lessons between disc 3 and 4.

The bonus material on disc 4 consists of a 10-minute documentary with comments from supervising producer Lee Dannacher and a few other creative staffers discussing the origin of the series, primarily from a marketing perspective.  There's also a fantastic sneak preview of DC's animated ""Wonder Woman"" (see details below), plus a couple of trailers for ThunderCats dvds.  The slipcase additionally promises a ""Gallery of Characters and Action Figures"", but no such bonus item can be located on the disc, and the few glimpses of action figures shown within the featurette are obscured by an ill-placed graphic effect of simulated video scan lines.

SilverHawks first aired as a one-hour special preview in mid-1986, which was later split into the first two episodes of the ongoing series. However, in that hour-long presentation there was a musical interlude sequence (roughly a minute or two) spotlighting Bluegrass playing guitar during the heroes' departure from Earth and their space flight to the Galaxy of Limbo, which was trimmed for time considerations from between those first two series episodes -- you only hear the very last bit of said missing scene fading in after the inserted ""Journey To Limbo"" title card as the second episode begins. This deleted footage has not been restored and is sadly unavailable on the bonus disc.

As for story content, this was a kids' action cartoon and it doesn't pretend to anything grander.  Lee Dannacher describes the show's creative intention as ""cops and robbers in space"".  Plots are simplistic and the dialogue is largely juvenile, sometimes losing viewer attention amid overlong, speechless battle scenes or the vapid cackling of several villain characters.  Still, it all has a wonderfully high-spirited tone -- the music is positively addictive -- with richly textured background paintings and cool reflective shading on the figures.  Watching the episodes dubbed in French or Spanish is an amusing novelty should you feel a need to escape the familiar English voice cast -- be sure to check out the opening theme and Copper Kid's voice (haha) en espaol.

Warner Bros did a very fine job assembling this dvd set.  Other than the absence of the promised ""Character Gallery"" and other bonus features suggested (delayed for inclusion on Volume 2, we hope?), I can't find anything to genuinely complain about.  The gorgeous packaging definitely deserves praise.  The scripted material of the show itself is the weakest link in this equation, which is the only component I can deduct marks for.  As long as you're prepared for storytelling delivery aimed to charm a younger demographic -- complete with absurdist liberties in the show's depiction of physics -- you'll be happily enamored by this kid-friendly 80s-retro offering.

Riveting enough to practically warrant its own review, the included ""Wonder Woman"" direct-to-video animated movie preview is actually a 10-minute mini-documentary and not the routine trailer expected.  Between interview clips with the wowing voice cast, as well as insights from the director, producer, writer, and DC Comics personnel, we are treated to a history of iconic Wonder Woman comic book covers, glimpses of character design sheets from the movie, and a progression of storyboard sequences conspiring to excite anticipation even though no finished animation is seen...

3495585,5,B001BN25VW,"For years, my only surviving connection with the favorite show of my youth was a VHS of one episode, living somewhere in my attic. When Cartoon Network briefly ran the show back in 2001 or so, I was ecstatic. Now, finally, I own (half) of what to me is the quintessential 80s cartoon show, and it seems to be lovingly prepared as well!

Let's be honest; we all expected this to be as cheaply done as possible: Thundercats was always the flagship series. However, they've come through with a great release for Silverhawks! The slipcover is wonderfully silvery and embossed, and the interior case is sturdy and protective. They did skimp a bit with one flipper disc to keep it down to a 4-DVD set, but I can forgive this.

The show has never looked better. It's certainly no benchmark transfer, but considering the source material, it surpassed my expectations. 32 episodes are included in this volume, which is a pretty nice episode-to-dollar rate. And if you're curious, yes, the Bluegrass-Copper Kid quizzes at the end of each episode are intact.

All in all, no fan of Silverhawks or 80s cartoons in general should be without this set. With any luck, we'll see Volume 2 before too long.",1224547200,2,1188,4.701923076923077
3495586,5,B001BN25VW,"I can't tell you how excited I was a year ago when [...] broke the news that WB was considering a Silverhawks release. Now, a year later, it's in my hands. And it is beautiful! I was literally blown away by the packaging on this Silverhawks Volume One release! Blown away! The dvd case comes with a slip-cover...and it's the most spectacular slip-cover EVER....I think! Completely unexpected to see a slip cover, let alone, one like this. The whole thing is embossed and raised on the front, sides AND back! The coloring is awesome! It is hands-down the best slip-cover that I have ever laid eyes on.
The case is a normal size dvd case and it's white/clear. Inside is a dual ""flipper"" holding the 4 dvds. If you're familiar with the Red Dwarf style dvd cases then this is very similar, expect that it holds 4 instead of 3 dvds. Since the dvd case is clear-ish they put an episode listing on the back of the insert, which is nice cause they list all 32 episodes and which ones are on which disc. The 4th disc is a dual sided one with 8 episodes on one side and the special features on the other.
How do the episodes look? I play my cartoons through an XBOX 360 using an HDMI cable and a Samsung 1080p LCD 46"" tv. Why do I say that? Cause it ""could"" mean trouble. With a set-up like that you see a lot of crackle and pop that you normally wouldn't see on an SD TV. I can happily say that WB actually cleaned up the episodes! In my opinion they look better than the WB Thundercats release. The restoration process is on par with the BCI Bravestarr or classic He-Man/She-Ra releases....it's nice.
The menu screens are also in widescreen!!!!
Overall, I'm shocked WB put such an effort into Silverhawks. From experience, I figured it would be similar to a Thundercats release but WB has surprised me.
This thing is freaking nicer than Fox's latest Simpsons release and that's just crazy. This Silverhawks set won't even sell a fraction of what that Simpsons season 11 will sell and it's 50x better. The only thing that could have sweetened the deal more would have been a booklet detailing each episode...but WB isn't BCI.

My last comment: If you are an 80's cartoon fan or even a mild one, don't pass this one up! If this volume one has poor sales there is a good chance that we will never see volume 2 and that would be a shame. Please, get off the fence and buy!

Thundercats was the first and are avalable on dvd. Now bridge the gap and please release TIGERSHARKS! This was the little know cartoon between Cats and Hawks that ran with the multi show THE COMIC STRIP, featuring Monster Camp, and the Karate Cat, and those rapping frogs. It was the same studio and the same animation. Am I the only one that remembers this show? It was my favorate from the three.",1223856000,3,658,4.314516129032258
