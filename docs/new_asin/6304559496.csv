900943,4,6304559496,"A Bullet for Joey, 1955 film

The story begins in Montreal Canada. A man takes pictures surreptitiously. A Mountie is suspicious, but the hurdy-gurdy man gets away. Elsewhere in Lisbon Raphael Garcia buys a drink for Joe Victor. He has a job for him: kidnap a man for $100,000. Doctor Macklin visits the inspector to tell about that organ grinder. Joe Victor arrives in Canada as a new immigrant. They develop a plan to get close to Macklin. Joe calls his boys. Joyce is recruited. They try to identify that organ grinder. But its too late. One man photographs people leaving an electronics plant. One of the gang, Jack Allen, romances a secretary, Yvonne. Joyce's job is to get close to Macklin. She takes up golf, and lets Macklin advise her. Macklin then teaches her chess at his place. Yvonne's sister complains about her; Joyce hears about this. Yvonne figures out what Jack is up to, and breaks up with him. But she won't tell anyone.

Jack Allen asks for his money so he can return to Los Angeles. Inspector LeDuc notices that three murders involved Macklin. A murder creates a search for a light blue convertible; they get the fingerprints and find a match. Joyce gets closer to Macklin. Macklin is told about his secretary's murder. Victor knows how to handle this problem efficiently. The list of long-distance calls to Los Angeles provides a list of suspects. They also find a list of recent immigrants from Lisbon. [Note the technique used to follow a suspect in a car.] The crooks spot a telephone repairman, and are warned. Squirrels chewing on the lines again? LeDuc asks Macklin about Joyce, an American. Macklin visits Joyce's house and gets a glass of sherry. Joyce discovers what is happening, and gets a surprise.

Eric Hartmann takes both Macklin and Joyce to a freighter. A radio transmitter is used to track a truck. This truck is brought to a harbor and loaded onto a freighter. LeDuc tries to call headquarters but his signal dies out. What will Victor do next? Has he got the money? LeDuc and Hartmann have a discussion about this operation. Hartmann works on principle. Is he a master of deception? LeDuc asks Victor to do something decent for once. A distress signal is fired to warn the River Patrol. Eric walks Macklin out the door. Victor meets him and they converse loudly. There will be a happy ending for the good guys.

This is an interesting mixture of gangsters and spies that provide a mystery. It seems like a documentary in showing the techniques used in investigations and undercover operations.",1317772800,2,2536,4.756818181818182
900944,4,6304559496,"The film noire was a bit tedious.  However, compared to modern films, at least it did not last too long.
In some respects it, for some unknown reason, reminds me of the black and white first two seasons of ""The Adventures of Superman,"" with the heavy music and the straight, if not boring cop, except that the cars were less interesting.
I never figured out why the gang of apparent communist lackeys did not just snatch the scientist rather than leaving beheld a trail of cadavers, but, then, ""A bullet for Joey"" could have been a thirty minute episode on a cop show.
Still the movie is not uninteresting and worth at least one watch.
The DVD quality was quite good in terms of picture and sound.",1310860800,2,697,4.488188976377953
900945,3,6304559496,"""A Bullet For Joey"" is really not a bad story, but the dialogue is extremely flat, boring and Edward G. Robinson and George Raft are simply going through the motions with their monotone voices. Neither actor seems like they really want to be in this movie.
Some nice police procedural activity is seen with mid 1950s radar systems in use.
For EGR and Raft fans only !!
I am still debating on whether to purchase it or not !",1296777600,,423,4.367088607594937
900946,5,6304559496,I was so glad to get a chance to watch Edward G. Robinson.  I don't believe his works have been fully appreciated.  He is really a great actor and more of his work should be brought to DVD so that people will have exposure. There are so many facets to him.,1256601600,2,256,4.0
900947,3,6304559496,"Not a great film, by any stretch of the imagination. Too stagey, creaky and obvious. But Robinson really delivers (the shot after he sends up the flare is absolutely stunning -- look at the resignation on that face!), and Audrey Totter does a nice job as the moll who turns out to be a soft touch. Those two performances turn a two star effort into a three star film.",1217548800,2,367,4.333333333333333
900948,2,6304559496,"I must admit that I bought this disc because I was intrigued with the idea of casting Edward G. Robinson and George Raft as adversaries in the same film. Of course, these gentlemen are two of the ""giants"" of the crime/film noir genre. Unfortunately they are let down by a hackneyed script and mediocre production values.

The film takes place in Montreal during the ""cold war"", and ""the other side"" wants to kidnap a brilliant scientist and the details of a top-secret project he is working on. Their agent, who poses as a book-seller ( ruthless Peter Van Eyck ), hires an American gangster ( tough, no-nonsense George Raft )--exiled to Portugal--to come to Montreal, reassemble his old gang and grab the scientist. As this plan takes shape, a couple of related murders get the attention of an RCMP inspector ( a cerebral Edward G. Robinson ). Can the inspector foil the plot and save the scientist before he is whisked off somewhere behind the Iron Curtain ?

As I have indicated, this is not a very good film, but Messrs. Raft and Robinson still have a formidable presence. George Raft is perfect as a guy you really don't want to cross ! On the other hand, I agree that the great Edward G. Robinson is wasted here--this role couldn't have been much of a challenge for him, and it could have been played by any competent, journeyman actor. There is another reason to sit through this movie--Audrey Totter. As Mr. Raft's ex-girlfriend who is ""recruited"" to charm the scientist, Ms. Totter gives us another rivetting performance that has made her one of film noirs' best ""femmes fatales"".

I have yet to see a truly complete definition of ""film noir"" and I am certainly no expert. I suspect, however, that ""A Bullet For Joey""s status as film noir could be open to debate.

The disc has a decent full-frame, black and white picture, and mono sound.

On the cover of the DVD is a terrific representation of Robinson, Raft and Totter, and all three are very watchable. However, on the back I see words like ""pulls out all the stops for excitement and edge-of-your-seat suspense""--""explosive""--""breathtaking""--""pulse-pounding""--""crackling""--""rapid-fire""--""action-packed"". If you swallow all this hype, I have some ""Ocean-Front Property in Arizona"" that you might be interested in !
Apart from the stars, this one is disappointingly routine.",1187654400,23,2336,4.918781725888325
900949,2,6304559496,"what might have been a taut thriller is hampered by a meandering plot that sluggishly makes its way to a mawkish ending (Raft's calculating hood isn't such a bad guy after all). What little style and authority the film has  is due to Robinson, a dynamic actor who is wasted in this film. If you are going to buy any of the MGM film noirs, get The Stranger or Woman in the Window, both with Robinson and both superior to this turkey.",1187568000,4,432,4.2682926829268295
900950,1,6304559496,"If there's ever an award for ""Most Boring Film Noir Ever Made,"" this little stinker would be in strong contention.  It is a miserable, plodding police procedural with essentially nothing to recommend it.  About the best you can say is that the last 15 minutes are marginally less dull than the rest.  Edward G. Robinson is squandered.  Set in Montreal, the film has all the French-Canadian flavor of Frank Sinatra singing ""O Canada.""",1185753600,9,433,4.890410958904109
900951,4,6304559496,"Edward G. Robinson stars as Inspector Leduc of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, conducting an investigation into the murder of a Montreal constable in ""A Bullet for Joey"".  Robinson soon realizes that he's stumbled into an intricately woven plot that involves the kidnapping of French Canadian physicist Dr. Macklin played by George Dolenz.  The scientist apparently is working on cutting edge technology desired by the other side.

The kidnap plot is masterminded by rare book dealer Eric Hartman played by Peter van Eyck.  He recruits deported mobster Joe Victor played by aging tough guy George Raft secreting him through customs.  Raft assembles his old mob including now reluctant temptress Joyce Geary played by Audrey Totter who will try to seduce the unsuspecting Dr. Macklin.

Robinson is hot on the trail of Raft and his cronies who have abducted the poor doc and follows them onto a freighter bound for parts unknown.  He tries using whatever means possible to thwart the plot, ultimately appealing to the patriotism of Raft.

Both Robinson and Raft slightly beyond their prime nonetheless do well in their portrayals in this decent flick.",1181520000,7,1152,5.155913978494624

7874608,5,6304559496,"Why'd we watch this movie? Because Edward G. Robinson is in it. Because it's the Pluto of the Film Noir solar system - not really a planet, but close enough. It's an alright example of ""Cold-War/Spy-Noir/Atomic Threats"" types of movies. It lacked in explaining exactly what the communist spies were after with their plan to kidnap the physicist. We feel that we must recommend but another Spy-Noir/Commie Pic: ""Walk a Crooked Mile"". WACM is an earlier and more intriguing example of the aforementioned propaganda genre. For some reason, we always hope that these movies will end with detonation of the secret device! But, alas, this is no ""Kiss Me Deadly"". This is a warning against the Communists. In this case, they'll use the mob to do their ""evil deeds"" so that they may overtake the free world. But, Hollywood shant allow it! Furthermore, we shant allow this movie to be purchased for $25.99! Watching it is one thing, but as you know, NASA only funded the race to the Moon, never to Pluto...

7874609,2,6304559496,"This self described""film noir"" from MGM of A Bullet for Joey(released Apr/55)starring,among others,Edward G. Robinson as Insp. Raoul Leduc and George Raft as Joe Victor aka Steiner,is unfortunately a bust. I do not believe for a second this film falls within the film noir category like a Big Sleep or DOA would. To me it's a just a plain melodrama of cops vs the bad guys. The pairing of these two pros was,on paper,fantastic,but on screen the paper thin plot falls as flat as Raft's feet.
The story finds a gang of origin unknown,after the brains of a professor working on secret project involving,the soup de jour of the cold war 50s,the A-Bomb. The location funny enough is not New Mexico but Montreal. The gang plans to kidnap the professor and sail him away to an unspecified foreign government,and they employ the efforts of a well known U.S.gangster(Raft)in doing that. Raft calls up three of his best men from the old days along with an old flame from Cuba. Her job is to put the hussle on the professor and lure him into their clutches. Things start off well as one of Raft's boys pretends to fall in love with the prof's secretary,but after she spills the beans on what kind of work the prof's working on and its' location,she winds up dead in a field. Things start to slowly unravel after this. He goes back to L.A.while Raft,in his absence,finds out about his deed. Raft makes sure he never sees the next sunrise again.
Robinson is the local Inspector for the Montreal detachment of the RCMP and he has been working on the case,unbeknownst to him,from the start,after a fellow RCMP officer was killed early on in the film. The same gang that killed the cop are also involved with the planned kidnapping. Robinson's leads get he and an associate kidnapped and taken aboard a ship the gang has paid for. When Robinson lets a flare off alerting the local Canadian Coast Guard,the gang now has to dispose of the professor. Raft who has now been paid,also has been wanting off the ship but has gotten no where. He originally planned to leave when the Coast Guard arrived,but has a change of heart after Robinson had earlier tweaked his conscience. Raft disposes of the chief gang member before he can kill the prof. However he gets fatally wounded in the process and dies in Robinson's arms.
Robinson essentially is the #1 star here. With his presence and acting ability,he steals every scene he is in. But the script is pedestrian stuff and fails to excite at any stage of the game. Seeing old gangster buddies Raft and Robinson together once more was a delight but there was nothing for them to do,and was all for naught. The final scene with Raft dying in Robinson's arms,even looked and sounded comical. Funny enough 1955 was the last year founder UA member Mary Pickford was to have in her company. She sold her stake in it for about $1.5 million. UA had become known as the studio without a studio,financing independent projects elsewhere,thus reducing overhead.
Technically speaking the film is full frame and is grainy off and on,especially noticeable in dark scenes. It needs a good remastering,but I doubt if MGM,for a film of this""calibre"",would be interested in spending the money.
All in all,what should have been an exciting pairing of two old pros in Robinson and Raft,turns into a flat yawn fest very early on. Robinson steals every scene he's in but in the end it is all for nothing.",1362787200,,3408,4.691151919866444
