2885076,3,B000SIWHAU,"Land surveyor K is summoned by ""The Castle"" to an unnamed town, ostensibly to do some surveying, but he is prevented from doing so by a multitude of petty, albeit insurmountable, obstacles erected by a seemingly indifferent bureaucracy. Director MIchael Haneke does a fine job of adapting Franz Kafka's unfinished ""fragment"" (some viewers are going to be put off by the fact that the film ends literally in mid-sentence) to the screen. The problem lies, however, in the fact that Kafka's paranoid surrealism is better suited to the printed page and the reader's own imagination than to a literal rendering on the film screen. The fact that a good part of the film's exposition is spoken by an off-screen narrator only serves to underline this. Still, this is definitely worthwhile for those viewers interested in screen adaptations literary masterpieces, and those viewers who are simply interested in occasionally viewing films that are quite different from run-of-the-mill film entertainment.",1364256000,3,994,5.2974683544303796
2885077,3,B000SIWHAU,"I'm not an expert on Kafka.  I only read a couple of his books years ago and have not seen any other films based on his books.  He died before this book was finished and there is only speculation concerning how he intended it to end.  So the film ends abruptly. It is another story involving frustrations of a common man dealing with an inane bureaucracy.  There is some humor in the satire but not exactly a laugh a minute.  There always seems to be veiled or vague threats to the main character, K. The Land Surveyor. He has been summoned by The Castle to be their Land Surveyor.  However after traveling there he is told that this was a bureaucratic mistake. He is unfamiliar with the way things are done in the area ruled by The Castle.  He is always offending somebody and he's not the nicest guy in the world himself. His friend one day is his enemy the next. However the authorities seem too inefficient to finally settle his situation favorably or unfavorably. The film is made with choppy scenes separated by a momentary blank screen. I watched this primarily out of curiousity and I can't say I enjoyed it. If you're looking for something different or your a Kafka fan or curious about him, you might find this worth watching.  If you're looking for something lighter and more conventional - this aint it.",1363046400,2,1315,4.518987341772152

2885079,5,B000SIWHAU,"The Castle is my fifth Michael Haneke film. I read many of Franz Kafka's novels in my younger days and I find this adaptation by Haneke to be both entertaining and in keeping with Kafka's world. It is a world of bureaucracy run amuck. Every large corporation and government is Kafkaesque in the sense that orders and directives are made so obscure that accomplishing anything but confusion seems impossible. But Kafka adds a frightening dose of paranoia which adds despair and fear to the mix. By adding a touch of humor and downplaying the fear, Haneke's vision turns the film into Kafka lite. This is not a bad thing because it makes the characters seem more realistic.
Steven Soderberg, another of my favorite directors, made the film Kafka in 1991. I remember it as an outstanding film. Unfortunately it is not now available in a region 1 DVD. I hope it becomes available soon.",1277596800,4,881,4.7272727272727275
2885080,4,B000SIWHAU,"I can't speak for the wisdom of remaking FUNNY GAMES for an American audience, but that aside, Michael Haneke's films since THE PIANO TEACHER have steadily shown more daring. Haneke has attained the stature of a Welles: all of his work deserves to be seen, even his lesser work. Thanks to Kino, that is now almost completely achievable on home video.

THE CASTLE, made for Austrian TV, looks like a lot of European TV. It is shot in a much more conventional style than other Haneke films: more cross-cutting, shorter takes, more close-ups. It not only fails to give us the spatial sense of the novel, it can hardly be said to be production designed at all. Mostly, it is shot against nondescript backdrops.

Despite these constraints, THE CASTLE is an entertaining extract of Kafka's novel. It is wholly a Michael Haneke movie, while still spotlighting some aspects of Kafka that can easily get lost in the dense overgrowth of the author's prose. Among these things is the fact that Kafka, as we know from his diaries, was a fan of Chaplin. Ulrich Mhe, too old and too Gentile to be the K. of the novel, nevertheless captures the put-upon Everyman at the heart of the character. The Chaplinesque nature of K., as it turns out, was right there in the novel all along. The same goes with Dickens/Kafka connection. Simply by allowing supporting actors to show a bit of ham, Haneke keeps the proceedings lively and colorful in a way previously camouflaged  by Kafka's style.

As a personal film by Haneke, everything remotely evoking psychological states or tending toward metaphor has been surgically removed. We never see the castle. We see the village once in a drawing on the door of the Inn, and that is underneath a sheet of newspaper that blows to reveal the drawing only when the door is opened. The messenger Barnabas doesn't appear all dressed in white, an important detail in the novel that motivates K. to believe he is more intimately connected to the castle than he is. He looks like what he is: the cobbler's son.

A MAN ESCAPED, by Robert Bresson (one of Haneke's acknowledged influences) is the likely model for the voice-over style of THE CASTLE. We hear the narrator relate events exactly as we are witnessing them. As with Bresson, it is an ""alienation device"" out of Brecht; like Bresson and Brecht, though, Haneke is, in spite of himself, too good a dramatist to keep us at arm's length for long.

THE CASTLE has previously been made into a very good film, in 1968. That version tried to smooth over the unfinished nature of the book, yet managed to capture its elliptical essence. Haneke's conceit is to dwell on the fragmentary aspects of the book, to the degree that he often cuts to black in the middle of scenes that are continuous in the novel. (!) Still and all, he has made the more accessible of the two adaptations. By fashioning his script as a twisted love story between K. and Frieda (the exceptional Susanne Lothar), he has embedded a familiar plot arc into an otherwise unresolved story. The result is an enjoyable film, and a unique critical take on one of the 20th century's great authors.",1188518400,38,3124,4.6916058394160585

8205427,5,B000SIWHAU,"This is the best film adaptation of a Kafka story, novel or short story, I've ever seen. Haneke understands that what made Kafka great was not recreating some vague sense of weird ""Kafkaesque"" atmosphere, but the deep and profound sense of the Absurd of life, as Camus talked about, seeping through in scene after scene in a propelling narrative, pushing and moving ahead as we follow K. from situation to situation in a cobweb of oppressive bureaucracy  a bureaucracy of life and not specific to economic/political agendas ...",1393977600,3,527,4.988636363636363

Maybe the story was lost in translation since it was subtitled but I could not follow it.

8205431,4,B000SIWHAU,"Kakfa has been brought to the big screen -at least as I know- in three oportunitties. Orson Welles (The process), Haneke (The castle) and Valerie Fokin in 2006 with The Methamorphosis.

Haneke recreates the oppressive atmosphere of a man inside a struggling world of rules, bureaucracy and existential isolation with a steady narrative pulse, with the snow and cold as silent witnesses.

If you are not acquainted with Kafka, then please refrain to watch it. Because Haneke's personages are always at the border of desperation.

Good cast in plain shape.",1376784000,5,554,5.133333333333334
8205432,2,B000SIWHAU,"Kafka may have written a 5 star novel but this director certainly hasn't found a way to make it visually engaging.
