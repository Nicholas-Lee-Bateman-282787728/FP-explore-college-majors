7982806,5,B00008G5WE,"Porn is one of the largest and fastest growing forms of media in the United States. The industrys profits have skyrocketed as we become increasingly reliant on technology for our entertainment. Why has this happened, and will the trend continue? You would not know that especially when the king of all Playboy stopped printing nude pictures. You will witness how the industry operates and makes shocking millions of dollars from willing and able couples and singles. They have so many avenues of making profit from a singe hour of operation that will blow your mind away. Considering the subject and the language covered in this documentary, you will see why it really is a billion dollar business in B. Forget about what you know when it comes to sex since this is THE BUSINESS of making money from sex. Sex really sells in billions, even on PBS but more importantly for AT&T wit no fuss. Amazing amount of information about how porn is marketed even if you think you know porn. Very well done documentary.",1447977600,,1007,4.76

7982808,3,B00008G5WE,"There is probably no such thing as discussing porn too much.  In that way, this Frontline episode was pleasant.  However, it doesn't mention anything that porn fans haven't heard before:  Porn makes a ton of money, but the industry also risks censure.
This work stands out as it aired on public television, but had cursing and female and male dorsal nudity.  It repeated the message ""Not for sensitive viewers"" not just at the beginning, but approximately four times.
Did you ever think you'd see Janet Reno speaking about porn!?  Well, she does it here.  The work predicted that the industry will hurt under Republicans.  Well, we have a Democrat in the White House again.  Also, given W's war efforts, fighting porn took a backseat during his administration.
This work is director-focused, rather than star-focused.  Many interviewees speak of porn as viewing for couples and I would think of it as a solo thing, if you know what I mean.  Seeing videocassette covers, rather than DVD covers, gave the work a pass'e feel.  The work never once speaks of 1980s feminists who opposed the industry.
As a cursory look at blue movies, this was fine.  I just think others, especially fans, will want to hear discussions that go deeper.",1245888000,2,1229,4.855769230769231
