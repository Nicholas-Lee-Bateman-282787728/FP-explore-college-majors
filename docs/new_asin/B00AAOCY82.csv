8549254,5,B00AAOCY82,"The movie is a reminiscence of life in Bohemian town in early 20th century. Very funny picture of beautiful wife of a brewery clark who is highly anxious, while she is downright hedonic in everything she does.  The movie based on a novel of one of most beloved Czech writers - Bohumil Hrabal. Tthe main actress Magda Vasaryova is beautiful inside out. I also recommend ""Marketa Lazarova"" (a different role about middle ages in Bohemia) which was declered bezst Czech movie of 20th century.",1360022400,4,489,4.821428571428571
