8117037,5,B000F3UO8A,"Steve Kaufman is a very well-known bluegrass player but with this DVD you get something a little different.  Steve takes you through the calander year of holidays with songs:

The songs (and their associated holidays) that you'll be learning on this unique lesson are: Let Me Call You Sweetheart (Valentine's Day); When Irish Eyes are Smiling (St. Patrick's Day); Dayenu (Passover); America the Beautiful (Memorial Day); Battle Hymn of the Republic (Fourth of July); We Gather Together (Thanksgiving); Who Can Retell? (Hannukah); Winter Wonderland, Jingle Bells, We Wish You a Merry Christmas (Christmas season); Auld Lang Syne (New Year's Eve).

Who are these songs for?  I think two distinct guitar players will benefit from this most well-done production from Homespun.

1.  Beginners.  It is always a great accomplishment for a beginner to learn a complete song.  It feels great after practicing the chords for so long to have something come together.  Steve gives an easy version of each song for just that purpose.

2.  Intermediate.  Besides Steve's ""dressing up"" of songs (of great benefit to the intermediate player) there is another reason that this DVD might appeal to the player who has advanced beyond the basic chords:  if you are working hard in your lessons, and working on scales, alternate bass, learning the fretboard, etc...

you deserve a break!  you deserve a once per week, well earned break from the deeper material and the songs here are just what the doctor ordered.  These are great songs that friends and relatives love to hear, and they are fun to play, and for the intermediate, it is nice to add them to the growing library of songs memorized.

Steve has an easy going personality, and slows down just enough to let you work through the TAB with his assistance, but gives you enough to dress up and make these songs your own.

I am so glad to have purchased this DVD.  Working hard, concentrating, and doing drills with seemingly endless repetition is so very important; but so is just stopping and enjoying your guitar.  Combine these songs with judicious use of the capo to change keys, and relax and enjoy.  Tomorrow, you'll get back to work.",1179705600,,2176,4.923076923076923
8117038,4,B000F3UO8A,"80-minute DVD (with music and tab) - Three time National Flatpick Guitar Champion Steve Kaufman knows that guitarists like having ""a song for every holiday."" In this lesson that was originally released on video in 2000 (but is now available on DVD), Steve teaches eleven songs for various special days from Valentine's Day to New Year's Eve. The majority are in the key of C, but a couple others take us into the keys of D or F.

Emphasizing his technique of strumming through chords only up to the song's melody notes but not past them, Steve demonstrates an easy method to provide both rhythm and melody. The ear hears the highest tone in chord's voicing. Therefore, this is good direct approach to learn songs. On the songs for Hanukkah (Dayenu, Who Can Retell?), we're shown how to break out of the chord occasionally and how to provide light strums to fill gaps with time and chord coloring.

The videography is very professionally done, but Steve's loose wrist watch does provide a slight annoyance to the viewer trying to concentrate on the multiple screens illustrating both the right and left-hands. Adding holiday songs to one's repertoire is a wise thing to do. It's also good practice for learning new licks, chord shapes, phrasings and patterns. The songs taught include Let Me Call You Sweetheart, When Irish Eyes are Smiling, Dayenu, America the Beautiful, Battle Hymn of the Republic,  We Gather Together, Who Can Retell?, Winter Wonderland, Jingle Bells, We Wish You a Merry Christmas,  and Auld Lang Syne.
