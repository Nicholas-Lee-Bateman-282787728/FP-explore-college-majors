8277285,5,B001AFUNMY,"The one off single drama used to be prolific in British television broadcasting. It would be progressive in subject matter, highlighting an area of political/social concern and would be a place for new writers to showcase their work.

Such a writer was Dennis Potter who wrote Vote and became one of Britains most loved writers. He was responsible for Pennies from Heaven, Brimstone and Treacle and The Singing Detective.

Vote charts the political rise of a Labour candidate: Nigel Barton and the relationships he has with his wife, the local party and his political agent, whilst battling realities against his own ever challenged idealism. The same territory is covered in The Candidate with Robert Redford. Keith Baron plays the part of Nigel and does so brilliantly in what may well be a career defining role. The play starts with the death of the incumbent at a hunt: the Tory grandees having more pity for the fate of the horse than for the man who has just fallen. Nigel then becomes the Labour candidate in the bi-election. The initial meetings he has with the local party faithful are hilarious: the distance between his intellectualism and their emphasis on trivialities represent a bigger gap than that between him and his political opponent.
Nigel has two consistent voices in his ear  that of his agent and his wife, played by Valerie Gearon.

His agent tries to take care of Nigels political electoral potential: their trips door to door canvassing are extremely enlightening both for Nigel and the audience, at one point he has to stop to vomit, his agent talking at regular intervals directly to the camera providing us with the insider POV. A visit to the local hospital proves especially poignant: an amputee is asked f there is anything that he wants. He wants his leg back.

Ann Barton reminds him of his duties to himself, wondering all the time why he would choose to put himself through such an ordeal. To be a candidate is to subject yourself to a humiliating experience. Theirs is an acrimonious relationship from the time he decides to become a candidate. In the final sequence we see Nigel giving the speech of a lifetime, with wife present, only to let himself down by putting a v sign to the audience who is by now banging their cutlery on the tables.  It is as fresh and relevant today as it was when it was made  politics as brand and what that does to individualism has wide and broad significance.",1434672000,,2431,4.746445497630332
