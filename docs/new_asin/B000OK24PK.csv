8405033,2,B000OK24PK,"Due to the general lack of Diana Ross content on DVD I was not expecting much from this two DVD set either. The Diana Ross In Concert DVD content has some execellent songs, however the video quality is really bad and the audio is not much better. Obviously this DVD was re-mastered on someones home PC with an original recording that was very bad to start with. Diana Ross Live the Lady Sings the Blues, well if your a fan this is a DVD for you. Diana truly up close and personal so enjoy.
