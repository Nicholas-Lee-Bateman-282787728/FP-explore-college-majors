8327573,4,B001NOMOJC,This movie was a surprise for me. Though it is a mixture of Indiana Jones and British Spy movies it comes across as a very good action movie with good location settings in Turkey. Fast paced with  a pretty good plot and worth a large bowl of popcorn.,1485388800,,250,4.208333333333333
8327574,2,B001NOMOJC,The movie at best is a c . The film itself is of very poor quality. the color is faded and the audio seems off . There is no real excitement that holds the viewers interest. pass it bye.,1403395200,,186,3.7948717948717947
8327575,4,B001NOMOJC,"Good story, well executed for a B movie that has a late Sixties feel to it. The lead is the guy who played James Coburn's IRA friend in Duck, You Sucker! Turkish setting is same place as in a Commissar X movie I have (which is also a bad print). Check out the crazy musclecar chase in the boondocks of whatever Turkish desert they are in. Overall, a good little adventure knock-off of Raiders of the.",1393891200,,400,4.276315789473684
8327576,1,B001NOMOJC,Take an old vhs cassette copy and scan it to a disc and you have this beautiful looking dvd. Movie starts off widescreen and goes to full frame after the credits and then you have nothing more than a dark vhs copy of a cinemascope movie presented in full frame recorded onto a dvd. AWFUL!!,1337644800,2,289,4.2727272727272725
