797563,5,6304167954,"I remember I used to watch this movie when I was like 15 years old and it was one of my favourite ones. Why? Because of the erotic contents. You won't find a really sexual movie here, but instead, a really EROTIC and captivating movie. It makes you want more and more. I am really happy to have found this movie again after so many years. And of course. Lisa Barbuscia is one of the most beautiful girls around.

Cheers.

People with intellectual pretentions will only mock it, since it's obviously in bad taste and not ""clever"" enough for them. And I doubt it would appeal to women much, since it is completely lacking in mysterious smoking-hot men who won't take no for an answer. So, not a date movie either.

This, after the opening scene showed the previous tenant committing suicide there! While touring the place, the Bennett's can see the burn marks -it was set ablaze- as well as the cryptic, red message painted on the wall! Undeterred, they move right in. Weird things begin happening almost immediately, and the weird music lets us know that it's only going to get weirder. Sam, their ultra-suave neighbor, seems too good to be true. Their new cat also seems odd, causing alex to feel threatened. Meanwhile, Tom's dreams take a turn for the more erotic. When a cat-caused ""accident"" puts Alex in the hospital, a woman named Lillith (Lisa Barbuscia), claiming to be the sister of the former occupant, stops by. Lillith is a dazzling beauty, and winds up alone w/ Tom in the apartment for the evening. It's obvious he's having trouble keeping his eyes off her, and it's not long before Tom forgets he's married to what's-her-name! For some reason, more cats arrive. When a nosy neighbor complains, he has a ""heart attack"". Soon, Lillith makes her move on Tom. She's not one for small talk, either! Yikes! Luckily, Tom's mother in-law stops by, putting the kibosh on Lillith's plans... temporarily. Sadly, Tom has no idea what he's really up against, as this is not a normal woman. In fact, she's not even human! Therefor, Tom just might be doomed. A movie like SERPENT'S LAIR is all about building, sexual tension, w/ the consummation thereof leading to total destruction. Lillith, being a wicked spirit, is insatiable and unstoppable, even barging in at Tom's job, bringing his work to an abrupt halt. The ensuing ""office chair"" scene is as humorous as it is sensual, w/ Tom's imbecilic business partner Mario, listening through the office door like some overgrown, demented kid! When Alex -finally- returns home unexpectedly, she discovers clear evidence of Tom and Lillith's shenanigans. Is his marriage finished? Simultaneously, even more kitty cats seem to be hanging around. Will Tom realize what's truly going on? Will he snap out of his Lillith coma in time to defeat her, before she reduces him to a smiling sack of dust? Will he be able to afford enough food and litter boxes for his growing multitude of felines? Oh my friends, let nothing in heaven or on earth keep you from witnessing Tom's freak-out, occult, demon-cleansing, fiery, final throw-down / showdown! It goes nowhere, but it's fun to watch!...",1507593600,6,2578,4.942396313364055
7863516,3,6304167954,"From 1995, this is more like psychological torture than horror.  Yes, there's a succubus (sp?), but most of the movie is about the mild erotica and the victim who can't escape the villains and their enchantments, so to speak.  If you have ""stalker scars"" then you will want to avoid this movie.  It has no scares, but the cats are beautiful.  As always, Jeff Fahey makes having eyes a wonderful thing.",1506556800,,401,4.605633802816901
