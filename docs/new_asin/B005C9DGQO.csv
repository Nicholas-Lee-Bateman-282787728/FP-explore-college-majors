8464939,4,B005C9DGQO,A bit long but fine acting and a beautiful leading lady. Amusing the  way the writers work around the strict censorship code Hindi films are subject to.,1503792000,,152,4.62962962962963

8464941,4,B005C9DGQO,"This film has a very strong and intense climax.  That said, be aware that ""Bollywood"" films are not like typical western films.  Dramatic content is interrupted by song and dance numbers, which can be unsettling if you are unfamiliar with the genre.  ""Murder 2"" has a pretty good storyline although it is uneven in several instances.  The male lead seems too young for the role, although I am unfamiliar with Hindu actors and he may have been cast for his popularity.  On the other hand, the leading lady is gorgeous, sexy, and vulnerable.  The villain, also, is perfectly evil.  These three actors do a very good job of driving the plot to its inevitable conclusion.  As a final comment I would say that the cover art is misleading.  Although there are a number of scenes suggesting nudity there is none.  That shouldn't take away from your enjoyment of the film, but it should not be your reason to purchase the Blu-Ray.",1490486400,2,922,4.670807453416149
8464942,5,B005C9DGQO,"This was one of the most intense and nerve wracking films I have seen in ages. It was over before I knew it ,and  so wrapped up in story, that I didn't even realize I was reading subtitles.  The acting from everyone was fantastic.  Wow!!!",1486684800,2,238,4.2444444444444445
8464943,5,B005C9DGQO,"Best murder thriller produced since ""Silence of the Lambs"" , remember the phrase,"" it rubs the lotion on it's skin"" well in this Hindi thriller, a modern day mentally twisted individual mixes old techniques with a sadistic purpose.  Great acting, script and more, just wish I could get more friends to watch Hindi movies!",1411171200,2,321,4.944444444444445
8464944,5,B005C9DGQO,This movie isn't like all other Bollywood movies out there! Jacqueline is hot as hell but despite that the storyline is just absolutely freakishly amazing. It's not something you see everyday!,1313366400,2,192,5.225806451612903
