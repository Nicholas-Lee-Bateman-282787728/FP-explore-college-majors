2377563,5,B000A7BQOW,"I remember watching this on Nickelodeon back in the day. The only thing that gave me pause was the quick flash of a pentagram at the beginning when that Vincent Price like voice was bellowing the origins of this narcissistic duck.

But it was a really fun show. Clever writing, british in nature and just loads of fun and innuendo. I can't wait to see this set!",1127260800,3,361,4.388059701492537

If you're a real 80's baby, next to The Teenage mutant Ninja Turtle's, Thundercat's, The Simpson's, and a few other's this is 80's nostalgia at it's best. Would like to see You Can't Do That On Television, Monster Squad, The Tom & Jerry Kids Show, and a number of others on DVD. Consumers need to get on these companies holding the right's to these classic's. There's sooo much of nothing on television these day's.",1124668800,4,444,4.632911392405063

2377568,5,B000A7BQOW,"A humorous cartoon I used to watch obsessively. A fresh take on the whole ""vampire"" genre. Duckula was a classic egotist and aristocrat who often tried to do the right thing...even if he fired Igor and Nanny several times. Like any good long-suffering British-type servants, they always returned. Duckula and Igor seemed at times to enjoy ganging up on Nanny, who had no brain because she was all heart, especially for ""Duckyboos.""",1187568000,2,431,5.0

2377571,5,B000A7BQOW,I used to watch these when they were on Nickolodeon. I am so glad they are on DVD and I am enjoying them greatly. The sound and picture quality is superb. They did a great job of restoration. I am looking forward to season 2.,1171065600,3,225,4.022222222222222
2377572,5,B000A7BQOW,"I love old cartoons I grew up with, but many don't look to good when i watch them on my tv, but Duckula looks great and is an awesome cartoon. The UK amazon.com has season 2 to come out in March, but its not coming here yet. :(",1169424000,4,227,3.75
2377573,5,B000A7BQOW,"I loved this cartoon when it was on Nic many, many years ago and was so thrilled to find it on DVD.  The charachters are all just as delightful to me now as they were back then.  I still love to watch cartoons but I don't think there is a single one today that can compare with Duckula, the stories and graphics are just fantastic and the jokes, well you have to experience them for yourself to truly appreciate them.  It's really a lot of fun, no matter how many times you watch it.",1162166400,3,483,4.117021276595745
2377574,5,B000A7BQOW,"I truly missed these shows of the 80s, and Duckula was one of them when they were shown on Nick (when Nick was a ""good"" channel to watch), but, as times go by so do the shows and they either become forgotten or end up on season sets by demand. So true with this cartoon. Very cool to watch and you'll laugh your heart out when memories of stupid Nanny come about and then you really wonder why there are no more cartoon shows like this. The show only lasted two years (if i recall), but, oh how those two years catch up with you and remind you how old you are (yikes!!)..but, if your a ""kid"" at heart like me and have kids of your own, don't pass this up. Highly Recommended!!",1157846400,7,676,4.090225563909774
2377575,4,B000A7BQOW,"Very enjoyable! They have my 4-year old daughter asking to watch ""Duck-u-lar"" (as Nanny would say it)!

The fold out packing style lends itself to the discs coming loose and scratching (and they scratch very easily).

The slip cover that slides over the main packaging is a hassle to take off/put on after every viewing.

Hopefully they will come out with a slim packaging design (similar to MacGyver Season 2).",1137974400,4,411,4.8428571428571425
2377576,5,B000A7BQOW,I asked for this DVD for Christmas.  I am thrilled to be able to watch the entire first season on DVD.  I hope that Amazon is able to get the remaining seasons.  I WANT THEM ALL!,1135900800,6,178,3.888888888888889
2377577,5,B000A7BQOW,"Wow, I am a huge fan of Duckula. He is not like regular vampiric waterfowl because he is a vegetarian. I got this for my sister and made myself jealous of her.",1131580800,3,159,4.0
2377578,5,B000A7BQOW,"Ahh...another show from my childhood comes to DVD.  I, like many of you, watched this on Nickelodoen all those years ago.  It's been so long since I watched it, that it's like new and fresh to me.

  Count Duckula is from a long line of vampire ducks.  But, there's something different about this Duckula.  This new Count Duckula doesn't suck blood!  He just loves brocolli sandwiches.  This non-evil Duckula greatly offends Igor, the evil butler that tries to make some evil pour out of the Count.  Nanny crashes through walls (and everything else) in attempts to serve Count Duckula.",1130976000,2,585,4.818181818181818
2377579,5,B000A7BQOW,"Talk about a great blast from the past! I remember Duckula not only from his Nickelodeon days, but also from the limited Marvel Comics series that only ran for about 17 issues, but was cool, considering Warren Kremer (of classic Harvey Comics fame) did the art for the first several issues.

I've enjoyed the episodes so far, if you like cartoon before they became shallow, merchandising icons, then this series is for you.  Also you notice that Castle Duckula's unique transport system was inspired by the castle in Rocky Horror Picture Show.

Basically, I recommend it to all ages because Cosgrove-Hall injected a lot of unique humour into the series and some considered it better than Danger Mouse, since here the characters did more dialogue and physical humour without the narrative running throughout the story.

Hopefully Duckula will become a Toon Classic for Captial Entertainment to bring out other volumes for the series.  Now if Marvel Comics could get permission to bring out a Trade Paperback collection of Duckula...",1129680000,3,1031,5.076923076923077
2377580,5,B000A7BQOW,"You know, I was a little apprehensive at first.  I bought this dvd set after having not seen any Count Duckula since I was at least 10 years old.  Now, at 27 ripe years of age, I wondered if my memories of the cartoon hadn't just maybe exaggerated the true quality of it just a little bit.  Did I remember a show, or did I just THINK that I remembered it?

My fears have been allayed after only watching the first couple of episodes.  The cartoon is just as clever and silly as I remembered it to be.  To those who are unfamiliar with Count Duckula, there are some things you should know: first off - you MUST enjoy terrible puns, delivered in an understated British manner.  Such as: ""Where is Igor with that bread?  He must be a loafer.""  Get it?  If not, then this show may not be for you.

Second, this show is just as good as DangerMouse, in my opinion.  Cosgrove Hall has made some amazingly creative cartoons, all done with a cheekiness and subtle brilliance that must be commended.  I imagine the studio as the kind of place where the animators and writers have a lot of great fun, and it translates into the cartoons.

Third, that theme song, man.  Buy the DVD just for the theme song.

I'm so glad that this set came out.  And just in case you're wondering, the picture and sound quality are VERY good, considering this is a cartoon that has been largely lost (though not forgotten) for 15-20 years or so.  If you have any fond memories of Count Duckula - any whatsoever - don't hesitate to purchase this dvd set.  You will NOT be disappointed.",1129593600,15,1554,4.333333333333333
2377581,5,B000A7BQOW,"WOW!  It is really good to see so many of the shows I grew up with coming to DVD.  I was so into this show, but even so, I can't truly remember one distinct episode.  I agree with the previous comments.  The stories were great and the characters were funny.  I do remember the theme (which I still love) how a bottle of ketchup was left in the cantainment when Count Duckula was created and instead of blood, he drank ketchup.  A very clever plot and it was truly sad that it didn't continue.  I have a very strange association with the show in that one summer as a child I was very sick and watched nothing but Nick and because ""Duckula"" was on a lot and I loved it, I later associated it with the pain I experienced while I was sick.  Strange, but I am dying to see this show as an adult.  Can't wait!",1129161600,4,803,4.063694267515924
2377582,5,B000A7BQOW,"The days when cartoons were cartoons and suits knew their place(well maybe not all the time, but were better controlled than they are now). Count Duckula is here!  A classic example of fabulous cartoon fun.  Wean the kids off of that 3d junk and make them watch this!  It's a cartoon with bite!",1128470400,5,294,4.509433962264151
2377583,5,B000A7BQOW,"As a huge fan of Daffy, Donald, Scrooge McDuck, and duck animation in general, I simply cannot believe that Count Duckula is being released on DVD.  All I can say is WOW!

Count Duckula got his start in the popular British Cosgrove-Hall cartoon Dangermouse and eventually got spun off into his own series on Nickelodeon which ran for 65 episodes.  The count's voice was done by David Jason who also did the voice for Danger Mouse.  Duckula was joined in his castle by his servant Igor and a housekeeper called nanny who botched up Duckula's return to life by bringing ketchup instead of blood turning Duckula vegetarian.  From this outrageous premise we got one of the truly underrated and hysterical animated shows in recent memory.

2377584,5,B000A7BQOW,It doesn't get any better than Count Duckula. Nanny with the broken wing and the very proper butler are so funny. My kids and I used to watch this on TV every afternoon. I've been looking for it forever! So happy to see it come out.,1127433600,4,232,4.065217391304348
8075378,5,B000A7BQOW,its great to own Count Duckula because I have missed this show so much back in the day Count Duckula was originally aired on Nickelodeon along with Danger Mouse too bad they only released the complete first season of Count Duckula on DVD because they have never released the complete second season of Count Duckula on DVD as well as the complete third season of Count Duckula on DVD and the complete final season of Count Duckula on DVD in America because I think that it's one of those cartoons that came out in England instead of America because Nickelodeon is going downhill with garbage shows like SpongeBob Squarepants which the show SpongeBob Squarepants gets on my nerves but Count Duckula is a great show gotta love the characters from Count Duckula such as Duckula himself the lovable Nanny and Duckula's butler himself Igor Nanny calls Duckula as Duckyboos  and I can tell the difference that the whole story of Count Duckula is loosely based on Bram Stoker's novel classic book Dracula but Duckula is just a Vegetarian Vampire Duck because in the heart of Transylvania in the vampire hall of fame yeah because none of the vampires zanier than Duckula,1494460800,,1161,4.776119402985074

Turns out it was from the first episode where Duckula goes to Egypt in search of a saxaphone. Brings back great memories!",1343088000,,292,4.528301886792453

Recently I went to Mexico for business and guess what?... I found Count Duckula with english and spanish audio tracks, not only 3 DVD, but 9 DVD with over 60 chapters!!!. That's right. Two complete seasons (season one with 30 chapters and season two with 39). Believe it or not Count Duckula exists with more chapters than this colection.
Of course my first impression was ""This is a bootleg DVD"". But not. This is the real McCoy for Latin America. Count Duckula (or Conde Ptula in spanish) was transmitted for two complete seasons. Maybe Amazon could try to offer this product maybe for colectors or just for another curiosity in DVD's zone 4.",1225670400,2,720,4.677165354330708
8075387,5,B000A7BQOW,"This collection is wonderful to own.  I have long considered Duckula to be a high watermark of 20th Century culture.  I have chosen Igor to be my role model to follow in most tense situations calling for dignity and tact.  Duckula himself is a paragon of joyful, childlike hedonism in a cruel and crazy world.  May he live forever.  However, did you know that the remaining seasons of Duckula are now available in the United Kingdom on DVD?  And that for some inexcusable reason they have not been made available in a DVD format playable in the North American region?  If I owned a teleporting castle and had a hulking manservant like Igor in my employ, I would certainly be paying a visit to Fremantle Home Entertainment to chat up the person responsible for that decision.  Come on Duckula fans, isn't there something we can do about this?",1203897600,6,841,4.635135135135135
