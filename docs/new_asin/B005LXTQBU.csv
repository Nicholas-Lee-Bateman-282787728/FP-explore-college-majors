The movie was sweet and the rest of the cast was awesome. Anyone who likes the 'loser makes good's kind of film will enjoy this one.",1405987200,,270,4.211538461538462
8478754,4,B005LXTQBU,Ok I admit that I bought this movie only for Josh Holloway.  I was not disappointed.  This movie is sweet and funny and a throw back to 80's movies.  I enjoyed it. It made me laugh and I'm glad I bought it.,1382313600,,206,3.857142857142857

He meets old buddies, faces off with enemies, and goes after the girl he liked in high school.  Overall, a pleasant movie, was entertained.",1370304000,,315,4.216666666666667

There's a okay story in this movie, but nothing to special to see. I watched it because Hilary Duff in this one and I've seen all her movies. Hilary Duff is just there for eye candy and has no major role in the main story line. She just there to support the main guy actor story plot and without her there - halfway through the movie it would just end. That's why they needed her in the movie. In fact, towards the end of the movie, you can tell that she wasn't really needed, because she says ""that's it? Good bye?"" She never seen again.

It's supposed to be a romantic comedy, but I didn't see neither in this movie. The actors didn't make me feel for them. I was just kind of bored with it honestly. Mainly about a guy that didn't get his high school crush and comes back 20 years later and falls for her all over again. But, her jealous Ex gets in their way all the time and it seems to stay like that throughout the movie. At the end, the Ex beats up the guy and leaves him there. Then, the main guy and main girl sleep together at the end and the guy leaves.

I think the movie would had been better if there was a 3 way love triangle with the main guy and the two females in the movie, but there's not. Then, threw in some comedy into the mix. Also some comedy with his gay best friend. Then, make more out of the relationship with Hilary Duff's character. That would make this movie so much better.

If you run out of things to watch, then you rent it. But, you can watch this only after waiting until you seen everything else you like to see first. There's no hurry to see this one and it's not a buy for sure.",1337126400,,1635,4.068322981366459
8478757,2,B005LXTQBU,"Other than Winona Ryder there's not much to recommend this film.

A 38-year-old guy (Mark Polish) returns to give the commencement speech at his old high school. He's now a successful author (we're told), though no one seems smitten with his celebrity. Indeed, when he says, ""I'm not a celebrity,"" we believe him. But then, why'd the school ask him to give the speech?

This is an oddball story, in that all the characters seem stuck in time, sort of, all except Polish and Ryder. I say sort of, because there are some odd inconsistencies.

Polish's parents treat him like a child. Dad (Michael Gross, from TV's FAMILY TIES) seems like a mental case, as do many characters. Gross seems to be in love with his car. Seriously, emotionally, in love with the car. I suppose this is meant to be funny, but it's just weird, in a non-funny way.

You'd think the principal (Chevy Chase) would be thrilled to have a celebrity author return to give the commencement speech. And he says so, early in the film. But then, inconsistently, Chase later treats Polish like a child, suspending him from ... class? Calling him and the coach into his office for fighting (really, just arguing), and treating them like children. And Polish and the coach sulk in Chase's office, like children.

How is it that Chase no longer treats Polish like an honored guest? Why doesn't Polish just say -- Screw this! -- and leave? He's shown that he can behave like an adult (even if other characters can't), and he has no motivation to stay; he's not interested in giving the commencement, only in seeing Ryder, the cheerleader he tutored and secretly loved. So why does Polish became a child in Chase's presence?

The film's conceit may be that ""going back"" to high school forces us to become children again, but the film failed to convince me of that premise.

These characters are not childish in a surreal, GET A LIFE/Chris Elliot sort of way. GET A LIFE was a hilarious sitcom. STAY COOL is more toned down, so that these weird character mannerisms (adults behaving like high schoolers?) is not weird enough to be funny. Just a little weird, just enough so that the characters fail to engage or connect emotionally with the audience.

The story is just a haphazard sequence of events as Polish meets people from his past. He dates Ryder. He deals with her angry ex (the coach). He goes to the prom (something he didn't do when he was 18) with a high-schooler 20 years his junior (Hilary Duff).

Sean Astin is the obligatory gay friend. He's a broad caricature, who works as a hair dresser. I'm guessing that his character's main purpose is to show us that Polish is a decent guy, because he's not homophobic. Lazy writers will sometimes give a white male lead a minority friend just to signal that he's a decent guy. Astin's character has no depth, so that seems to be his only reason for being in the film.

In fact, all the characters are flat caricatures. Ryder brings some emotional depth through her acting, but there's not much she can do with this material.",1334707200,,3037,4.628252788104089
8478758,3,B005LXTQBU,"this film is empty, and by empty i mean there is nothing to expect, nothing to wait for while watching it. i only bought it because of Hilary duff.",1327795200,,147,4.103448275862069
8478759,4,B005LXTQBU,"This is a light comedy. Henry McCarthy (Mark Polish) is an author of some renown. He has written a fictional book about his High School years, although in reality it is about his own experiences with some name changes. There is a bunch of first person narration in the film which are actual readings from the book. The names of the characters he reads don't match up with those they refer to making it slightly confusing at first until you realize Lauren is Scarlet.

Henry comes back in town and lives at home with his parents and borrows their car. He is at his old High School to connect with the current senior class so he can be the commencement speaker at graduation. During this time his whole teenage angst returns as he tries to connect with Scarlet. Scarlet is a pharmacist played by Winona Ryder, which is humorous on a different level. Her ex-bf Brad is the gym teacher. He and Henry get into it and are sent to the principle's office, who is played by Chevy Chase. In order to make things more difficult, bombshell student Hilary Duff throws herself at him. Toward the end of the film, some people from his high school finally read his book and realize they are in it. The book Henry wrote was about how Lionel (Ritchie) got him laid, although it was a Kenny Loggins song that inspires him at the end of the film.

Sean Astin was perhaps the bright spot, playing a gay. Except for him, much of the acting was flat. Mark Polish, who wrote the script was dull as the lead. The movie attempted to create those wonderful indie characters, but failed primarily due to the lack of good memorable lines and Polish's flat performance. I could picture Adam Sandler playing that part.

The movie is clever in that it is able to recreate the entire high school scene for Harry as an adult. This is a chick flick written by a guy. It might suffice as a date night rental. I perhaps overrated the film because I enjoy watching Sean Astin, Chevy Chase, Hilary Duff, and of course Winona Ryder can steal any scene.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. 3 1/2 stars",1327190400,,2053,4.452127659574468
8478760,2,B005LXTQBU,"Precious is a big fan of ""Lost"", and she especially likes wise guy Josh Holloway's character.  This is the only project that Holloway has done since ""Lost"", and we both are hoping that ""Lost"" was the springboard to a great career for Josh Holloway.

This movie is a step down.  This type of roll is more suited for some penniless and homeless starving actor rather than an established up and coming headliner.

The movie identifies itself as a comedy, but it's not funny. The main character was supposedly a dork in high school and 18 years later still hasn't gotten over it.  The audience is supposed to believe that Winona Ryder was the hottest chick in high school, but they made her up to be emaciated with pasty pale skin - totally unattractive.  Winona is a talented actress, but she tanked.  Then Sean Astin plays an effeminate latent homosexual man who works as a hair stylist and wears feminine clothing.  He should be ashamed of himself; his acting was so pathetic.

Above all the movie just wasn't funny.  I did't laugh once throughout the entire hour and 25 minutes.",1325548800,,1078,4.656084656084656
8478761,5,B005LXTQBU,"Henry McCarthy (Mark Polish) was not a popular guy in high school. 15 years later he is now a best-selling author and is invited back to his high school to give the commemoration speech at graduation. While visiting his home town, he reunites with his two best friends from high school (played by Sean Austin and Josh Holloway). He finds himself in a whirlwind when he decides to get in touch with his high school crush - a popular cheerleader (Winona Ryder) and a pretty high school student (Hilary Duff) has a crush on him.

This is a comedy film that's very comparable to Napoleon Dynamite and Juno. The movie is set in the mid 1990's but the set looks very realistic and not cheap at all. The cast is very strong in my opinion and the plot is exciting enough to keep the momentum up throughout the entire film. Mark Polish does a great job playing the lead character and his acting is very believable. The chemistry between him and Wionona Ryder is amazing as well. My biggest surprise was how great Hilary Duff's acting was. She was very convincing as a flirtatious girl interested in the Henry and has grown much stronger as an actress since her ""Lizzie McGuire"" days.

I was able to see this movie because a friend of mine from the Netherlands was visiting and happened to have this DVD, which was a nice surprise. It is such a shame that this movie is not available for release in the U.S. because this movie is good enough to be compared with other great indie films such as  ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" and ""Juno"" among others. When this DVD is released in the U.S., I highly recommend this for a feel-good, entertaining movie for adults.",1300752000,3,1665,4.543333333333333
