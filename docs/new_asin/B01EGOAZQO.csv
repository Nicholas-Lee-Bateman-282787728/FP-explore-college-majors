7734879,5,B01EGOAZQO,"Ip Man Trilogy, in a Steelbook is a perfect combination of great packaging and an even greater bio and story of one of the truly best Martial Artists that ever lived",1465171200,,165,4.354838709677419
7734880,5,B01EGOAZQO,"Very awesome packaging and great transfers of the three main Ip Man movies on Blu-ray. If you have these films on Blu-ray already, no need to double dip. It's the same discs with nothing new added to them. The only reason to get this set is for the steel book packaging and/or if you don't have them already. Great films!

As of October 2016...Donnie Yen posted on his social websites that IP Man 4 has been green lit!!!  Awesome!!!",1462752000,10,432,4.455696202531645
7734881,5,B01EGOAZQO,"I have watched all three movies and they are excellent.  The fight scenes of course are choreographed to demonstrate wing chun, and the action is fast and vicious. The characters are likeable, the culture of old China from the 1920's, 30's, and 40 ' s is interesting to my Western eyes. Of course the movies have subtitles in English, but they did an amazing job of not making it corny and still having a quaintness. Donnie Yen is the star of the trilogy.  He brings or the ""lone sherrif"" quality almost like a western,  but his character is kind, protective and honorable. The trilogy of movies would be awesome to have for any martial arts fan!",1461888000,16,646,4.551724137931035

7734883,5,B01EGOAZQO,"The IP Man Trilogy is an outstanding package consisting of 4 Discs. Three of the 4  Disc's are represented by stories associated with time and history. The First Disc is a story about World War Two with The Empire of Japan attempt to conquer  China. There are simply terribly effective engagements between the Japanese and the Chinese martial artists. The Second Disc has a true distinction of an example of some of the real differences between Chinese Boxing as opposed to Western Boxing. The Third Disc is about a corrupt waterfront when we learn that the Kingpin to all the troubles plaguing a school is portrayed by Mike Tyson. This has as well very good fight scenes with children and wives and mothers being an integral part of the developing action. The many times these films draw on a moral undercurrent the more poignant the martial art triumph really is. It is very effective in this Disc number three. Disc number Two tries to explain through action what IPMan established with the foundation of a School to teach the Martial Art of  Wing Chun. The greater Hong Kong community does not recognize ""Master "" status of IPMan. until he can prove he is indeed a ""Master "" of the Martial Art. A big-time fight in which there are a number of Martial Artist ""Masters are present occurs with the highlight of this round of fights is about between Master Hung(Sammo Hung) and IPMan(Donnie Yen). Master Hung wishes not to forget though it appears a draw has occurred. They fight again in another scene, however, this is a film with big political ideas and should not be missed. The history places Hong Kong in the hands of the English who show a great deal of animosity toward the Chinese. There are excellent even tremendous fight scenes with the Martial Artist being exemplified by modesty and an unmistakable desire to right a wrong. I think this particular disc may, in fact, be so dramatic that it be mentioned as the best of the three films. The Fourth Disc is interviews with the performers, it is in this Disc that all become mere mortal. I might suggest I was not terribly happy because these historical characters have such a name that it is not simply a Mr. or a Miss. An example is nearing the end of  Disc 2 as a young boy is brought into meet IPMan, the young boys' name was Bruce Lee. When Bruce Lee turned 16 years of age he was to become a student of the Wing Chun teachings through masterly teachings of IpMan. Disc two may very well be the strongest of the three Disc's.",1526169600,2,2490,4.551339285714286

7734895,5,B01EGOAZQO,"IP man gives a new, different look at another Chinese martial artist's unique fighting style or techniques.  The story lines are pretty much the same as in all Chinese martial art flicks, and these stories are no different;The competition between rival martial art schools and their head masters are as old as time.  In on of these series we are reminded of the tragic tale of another famous Chinese martial artist ""Hou Win Ja"" - seen in ""Fearless,"" who died after being poisoned by its Japanese nemesis. The fight scenes are well done and some even look spectacular!  The dialogues are lame, as usual; After all, what can we expect to hear from men who are about kill each other in a vicious hand to hand and feet to feet to combat. Enjoy the fight scenes, but do not expect much more from the series of these 3 productions.",1513036800,,825,4.523489932885906

7734897,2,B01EGOAZQO,"I love these movies. Great price, on time delivery. The reason i gave it a low raing is all four discs have scratches on them. Unlike most multi disc cases where each one has its own insert they are all stacked into one insert with no way to protect them.",1509926400,,255,4.12
7734898,4,B01EGOAZQO,"Terrific fight scenes as Ip Man goes from serene and revered kung fu master to homeless worker following Japanese invasion in 1938, he battles a martial arts practicing general.

Ip Man tries to set up shop in 1950's Hong Kong and quickly runs afoul of shady gangsters led by Sammo Hung.  He then has to represesnt all of China against an arrogant English boxer who killed his opponent in a Rocky IV style takedown.

Hong Kong 1959 and Ip Man squares off against a bizarrely cast Mike Tyson to save a school Mike wants to take over.  Then it's off to fight a younger Wing Chun practitioner to see who will represent the style going forward.",1508976000,,640,4.491379310344827
