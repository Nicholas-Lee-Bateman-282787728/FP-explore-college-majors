6290630,2,B00IS9HZR6,"We are big fans of both Bill Frisell and Ron Miles, but we were disappointed with this film. There just wasn't enough context and information about what was being shown, and the very long scene with images from the Sears Catalog was unnecessary, and almost impossible to watch. We enjoyed the historical footage, but I really can't recommend this film to anyone.",1428969600,,362,4.854838709677419
6290631,2,B00IS9HZR6,"A little more ""arty"" and a little less substantive than I expected.",1420329600,,67,4.666666666666667
6290632,5,B00IS9HZR6,"Breathtaking and sad, eloquently presented. Beautifully weaves vintage video with vintage photographs. No speech, title pages and music only: very effective.",1416009600,5,157,6.523809523809524
6290633,3,B00IS9HZR6,Educational but adding captions explaining the name of the cities being shown and some narrative  would have helped.,1415923200,,116,5.444444444444445
6290634,5,B00IS9HZR6,"Though you'd be underestimating the quality of the documentary, as well as creativity if not originality of this musical cinematic presentation (not the first time broadly similar projects, if rare, have been produced).  And for most, this DVD -- I purchased the HD streaming version, as inexplicably no blu-ray is available, despite it's being the format this project deserves -- will be the only opportunity to view the film or listen to one of the best musical compositions from Frisell in some time.  Should attract and appeal to more sophisticated cineasts and audiophiles, especially fans of Morrison's previous media projects, Bill Frisell and/or contemporary jazz.

To date, no separate soundtrack is available, nor is one apparently planned.",1408406400,7,750,5.3931623931623935
6290635,1,B00IS9HZR6,Very disappointed. It should have been more clear in the description that there is no narration to this documentary.,1407801600,2,116,5.157894736842105

6290637,1,B00IS9HZR6,"Horrible! Calling this a documentary is misleading. It's an art film at best. Deteriorated found film images supported by music and no commentary might be ok for a YouTube video, but not for a 79 minute film. I was expecting something that presented the facts with a narrative.",1404000000,3,277,4.791666666666667
6290638,5,B00IS9HZR6,"Stellar music! Powerful images! I highly recommend this extraordinary work. My mother at age 7 lived through this great calamity. She was evacuated by steamboat from Greenville to Vicksburg. When she saw the footage today at age 93 showing evacuees on the dock in Vicksburg, she cried.",1402790400,6,285,5.085106382978723

8644931,1,B00IS9HZR6,"Don't buy or rent.  This documentary needs a narrative.  Music is good, but it needs more documentation.  Sometimes art for art sake is too self indulgent.",1491782400,,155,4.884615384615385

8644934,5,B00IS9HZR6,"A thoroughly enjoyable pairing of musical and visualsmany surprising visualsthat enriched my perspective on the Great Flood and its role in the Great Migration. And the soundtrack is gentle, lovely and unpredictableanother work of genius by Bill Frisell",1457049600,,253,5.684210526315789

8644936,5,B00IS9HZR6,"I was fortunate to see this performed live at Duke University, with the musicians on stage and the film projected behind them, and it was spellbinding. I was thrilled to see it come out on DVD, and bought it immediately. I admit I've only watched the film again once since then, but I listen to the soundtrack at least once a week - it's that good. As one of the other reviewers noted, this is worth it for the music alone - it's a mix of melancholy and joy, and can be both calming and exiting at different times. If you are a fan of Bill Frisell, or just jazz and blues more generally, pick this up. As other reviewers note, the film is not a documentary - it's clips of archival film footage set to music, vignettes that, alongside the music, make you feel like you were there by the river when the flood happened, or that the events of those days are appearing to you in a dream or distant memory.",1449792000,,901,4.213872832369942
8644937,4,B00IS9HZR6,"My mother has talked about this event all her life, and when we watched it together it made quite an impact on the way I now hear the stories.",1447286400,,142,3.9310344827586206
8644938,4,B00IS9HZR6,"I'd probably give it a split review of 4/3: 4 because it's an innovative use of period film (yes, from 1927) and the music is very enjoyable; 3 stars b/c I won't be watching it a lot. There is no voice-over to tell you about the flood and the fallout, although there are occasional black screens with section titles and a little writing. But being a Frisell fan this was very much worth it.",1439769600,,390,4.283783783783784
8644939,3,B00IS9HZR6,"Love the river, love the images from the Great Flood of 1927, love Bill Fresell (seen him live and enjoy several albums a lot), but this film left me flat! I felt the music, while enjoyable, was not in sync with the images in many places. I also was yearning to know the stories captured in the images that the music couldn't tell.",1431043200,,331,4.26984126984127
