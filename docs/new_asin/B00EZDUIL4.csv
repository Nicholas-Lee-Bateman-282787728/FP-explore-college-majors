8610828,3,B00EZDUIL4,"the number of stars has NOTHING to do with the DVD its self and EVERYTHING to do with the hassle it took to even get it. i had pre ordered it when US pre orders came up and it took a month and a half for it to even start to be shipped. will i buy overseas DVDS from amazon again? who knows. as of this review no i won't be. but like i said i ADORE the DVD its self. it was my 1st time doing this type of overseas buying and im happy i did, even if it doesn't have actually concert footage. when its comes to K POP you just have to take what your given and wear it out!",1384300800,,568,3.6260162601626016
