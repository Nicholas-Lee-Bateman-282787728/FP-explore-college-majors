309206,4,6301016416,"Please don't get mad at me for only putting four stars for a production of ""Le Nozze Di Figaro"" that has Te Kanawa as the countess and Von Stade as Cherubino.  They are absolutely perfect, and most of the cast is, too.  However, I was dissapointed with this when I watched it because I hadn't realized that it would be an actual movie.  It just didn't have the opera feel to it because it was not filmed on stage.  Also they did special ""effects"" like flashbacks and things, and having the singers ""think"" their arias.  I was so mad that ""Se Voi Ballare"" wasn't actually sung!!!!  The whole point of opera is that it's the one place where people can voice their thoughts vocally and no one else will hear!  So the costuming and settings are lavish and lovely and the singers first-rate, but this is a movie, not a staged production.",1110499200,22,832,4.434210526315789
309207,4,6301016416,"Overall an excellent Figaro, though not as well-acted as I hoped.  For an older recording it looks and sounds great.  I only wish the New York City Opera Sep 1991 Figaro televised on PBS were available on DVD, with interviews by Hugh Downs and a much better acted (though non-famous) cast.  I thought the Count was especially good in this production.  Kiri fans should be quite pleased as well.",1108080000,6,394,4.666666666666667
309208,5,6301016416,"This is a truly lovely jewel-box of a production that is a triumph of simplicity and traditionalism.  ""Concept"" opera can work, don't get me wrong, but what a treat it is to sit back and wallow in the pleasures of a beautifully staged, designed and -- most importantly -- sung performance as this.  There isn't a weak link in the cast.  Particularly, Cotrubas may be the best Susanna ever, shining with an inner radiance that brings a smile to your face whenever she's on stage.  And Te Kanawa is as beautiful as ever, her customary richness of tone and heartbreaking expressiveness solidly on display.  The director has given the perfomance terrific pace and momentum (as does Pritchard in the pit) and has gotten his singers to be terrific actors as well.  I was concerned that the picture quality would not be the best (given that this is 30 year old video), but it's clear as can be.  The audio is less than wonderful at times (not too bad and not for too long), but that may simply be my copy.  In any event, look no further if you want a ""Figaro"" for the ages, one that honors the intent and brilliance of its creators.",1105056000,57,1125,4.480392156862745
309209,5,6301016416,"This production is a delight from start to finish. It has really great singing and acting from everyone.
I had the pleasure seing Knut Skram at the Norwegian Opera in Tosca and Flying Dutchman as Scarpia and the Dutchman and it was simply stunning. What a great actor and singer he is. His performance of Scarpia was his farewell performance, so the world won't be seeing him again on stage. Therefore we are so fortunate to have his Figaro on this performance. His great abilities as an actor is in full effect and his singing is top notch too. He has done so much on the Norwegian Opera's stage, practically every major baritone role in the German and Italian repetory.
Ilena Cotrubas is also totally great as Susanna. This has to be one of the most convincing performances of the role on DVD and record. Kiri Te Kanawa's Countess is also such a delight. It was just the beginning of a brilliant career and she proves here that she was the reigning Countess for the next couple of decades.
Benjamin Luxon was also extremely good as the Count. I had never heard of him before, but he had the appropriate mixture of noblity and arrogance making his plead for forgiveness at the end all the more effective. Frederica von Stade was also the most convincing Cerubino I have seen and heard. Her acting and singing alike are so much at the heart of the boy page who has hormones going all over the place. The Marcellina and Bartolo duo was also exceptionally good.

John Pritchard's conducting was so in tune with the great demands of Mozart's great opera, mixing great lyrical and comical moment perfectly. It was also a delight that the whole 4th act was done with both Marcellina's and Basilio's arias, which are normally cut.

The sound here is really good. It is presented in PCM stereo sound. The picture is also quite good. The colors are a bit too saturated, but it is very good considering that it is 30 years old.

This DVD is very highly recommended to all lovers of this great opera.",1102377600,12,1990,4.553072625698324
309210,5,6301016416,This production is marvelous!  It is so enjoyable and fresh and sparkling.  These singing actors are up to the challenge Mozart laid out before them.  I love this opera and I adore this production.  It is well worth the money.,1098921600,6,226,4.575
309211,5,6301016416,"Divine!  Without doubt the most delightful Le Nozze di Figaro I've yet seen.  Cotrubas IS Susanna.  Von Stade IS Cherubino. Has there ever been a more irascible, arrogant, demanding -- and totally convincing Count than Luxon?  And after the great performance of Skram as Figaro, why has the world of opera not seen more of him?  A pity.  I've scanned the Web and other than recitals as solo bass, he has done nothing else in music.  He spent five years in the U.S., studying music and architecture at Montana State U.  A strange combination.  Anyone know more about him? (xyzcolin1)

  Kiri te Kanawa.  What can one say about this great lady that has not been said?  Beauty, grace and the voice of an angel. The Glyndebourne version of Figaro was made two years after her debut in London featuring the same opera.  I did not see the debut -- is there film extant?-- that brought the world to her feet, but certainly it could not have been less of a performance than that of Glyndebourne, which was perfection itself.  A bonus of the latter was the view of Kiri at twenty-nine years of age.  The fresh and near startling beauty resulting from the racial mix of Maori and Irish.  The princess of opera.

  The princess of twenty-nine is now the queen of opera at sixty years of age.  Hard to believe and even more incredible is to see her at sixty.  She is not the fresh-faced kid of Glyndebourne, but certainly could pass for a lovely and young forty.  This is not a fancy on my part.  I did see her for the better part of an evening from a distance of not much more than a dozen feet.  It happened on Sept. 8, 2004 in Nashville at the Opening Night of the Tennessee Performing Arts Center.  What?  Nashville, the home of country music?  Yes, we do have a faithful opera following; testimony to that was the sellout of Kiri's one-night appearance.  I did not learn about it until Sept 7 and I despaired of getting a ticket.  I tried to get a pair of 'best available' seats.  Zero.  Tried for a single.  The Gods of Opera smiled down on me and I came away with a seat on the first row.

  She wore a red, trailing gown, a sleek and simple one that hugged her body, unlike the flouncy ones she seems to favor.  Her entire repertoire consisted of but six arias.  I was a bit disappointed that she sang only one of my favorites--Depuis le jour.  I did so want to hear what has become a Kiri trademark, and sung in so many of her videos and CDs--O mio babbino caro.  What happened next I still find hard to believe, since the act on my part was brash and I am a retiring sort of person.  However, a physician and his wife seated next to me congratulated me on my action and its outcome.

Bear in mind, though, that this happened in an atmosphere of decorum, so unlike most American musical affairs where the audience believes in laissez faire to the utmost.

  At the end of her final number, while Kiri was bowing to a standing ovation, I shouted, ""Sing, O mio babbino caro!""  The ovation was so loud she did not understand me and I repeated the request.  She smiled and I thought she nodded her head.  Alas, she did not sing the aria, took one final bow and left the stage.  After a few moments she reappeared, smiled and sang O mio babbino caro.  There are some skeptics who'll say the selection was in the plan, since she often includes it in an encore.  But I believe that the act was in keeping with her reputation for graciousness and generosity.",1097798400,15,3447,4.356466876971608
309212,5,6301016416,"This 1973 production from the old Glyndebourne Festival theatre has as starry a cast as one could possibly put together at the time and strikes me as well above what passes for top-drawer these days. The cast is simply marvelous. Oddly, it includes a singer as Figaro that I'd never heard of before, one Knut Skram, and I was a little apprehensive about that. I needn't have been. He is a tall handsome 36-year old Norwegian whose bass-baritone is rich and whose acting is superb. He looks the part better and moves more nimbly than any Figaro I've ever seen. And he sings in his arias and ensembles with dash and musicality. As the for the rest of the cast just look who is in it. Kiri te Kanawa, in the first flush of her international stardom, as a Countess who is ravishing both in sound and in looks. Her 'Porgi amor' and 'Dove sono' are radiantly beautiful. Her resistance to the Count's bulldozing is both feminine and strong (not that those are contradictory qualities, of course). Her conspiring with Susanna is delicious. In the final scene, where she forgives the Count, she is noble. Indeed in that scene the entire ensemble right through to 'Corriam tutti' is splendid. Benjamin Luxon is a proper Count who is more than a bit of a rascal. He plays the bullying Lord believably but does not come across as an unlikable heel, and one feels there is the chance that he may indeed change his ways. He is in marvelous voice and acts well both physically and vocally. Mezzo Frederica von Stade has made a specialty of the role of Cherubino, and with good reason. She has both the figure and the voice for it. Add to that the ability to seem both callow and devilish and you have a combination perfect for the role. Her 'Voi che sapete' is perfection. The secondary roles are well cast, well acted, and very well sung. One couldn't ask for a better Don Basilio (John Fryatt) or Don Bartolo (Marius Rintzler of the cavernous bass and the wicked buffo ways; his 'La vendetta' is choice). Nucci Bondo makes a likeable Marcellina and she sounds good, too. Even the Barbarina and Antonio are well-done.

The singer who should come in for the most praise, though, is the young Ileana Cotrubas, who of course went on to major international stardom (she was one of the best Violettas I ever saw), and in this performance she not only sings like an angel, but her comic acting (and think of the timing that's required for the part) is in a league with a Carol Burnett or a Tracy Ullman. Her Act III duet with the count, 'Crudel! Perch finora,' demonstrates not only her superb singing (and Luxon's) but also her teasing way with him. Delicious!

In the pit is the ever-trustworthy John Pritchard conducting the London Philharmonic. The stage production was directed by the legendary Peter Hall. The video production was done by Humphrey Burton, a stalwart of these sorts of television specials, and it was directed with expertise by Dave Heather. The rather traditional, but quite beautiful, production design was by John Bury.

I do not own any other DVDs of 'Marriage of Figaro' and cannot compare this one with the ones available. I find myself not impelled to obtain any others, however. I must comment that the color and stereo sound are of their time, the early 1970s. These are certainly not a hindrance, but one does recognize that this is a classic production.

I predict I will be returning to this performance many times over the years.

Everything in this video is excellent, sung by the most popular and best singers like Kiri Te Kanawa, Illeana Cortruba,Benyamin Luxon and Frederica Von Stade, undoubtedly the performance is magnificent and excellent. However, disappointedly the recording is quite poor that the pure notes of the singing were not quite heard in this video. It is still enjoyable to watch and listen to this video, however if we want to listen to the pure notes of the music and singing, we better take an audio CD. Unless this video is reissued with the recent recording stereo technic system, I recommend to get another version or issuance of this opera, consequently also with different singers.",993081600,4,802,5.037593984962406

My only tiny complaint would be that the subtitles are a little lacking in both the amount and translation, but really, who cares!  It's the music that matters, and this is a beautiful rendition of, in my opinion, the greatest opera ever!",1303862400,,370,4.841269841269841
309309,2,6301016416,"As one of the top-rated ""Figaros"" on these pages, it should be better than this. Yes, the singing is wonderful; and almost everything about the production as seen in the theater was top-notch, although the orchestral playing was not of the same quality as the singing. The orchestra may, however, have been better than can be heard through the poor audio quality, which makes it sound as if they're all playing on cheap starter instruments. The sound from the orchestra pit is dead, while the sound from the stage is as if from a gym heard through a tunnel and then trapped in a honky old loudspeaker. Live pickup was still an underdeveloped technology at the time of this recording in 1973. There is no stereo separation and almost no sense of space; so it might as well have been mono. At first I couldn't stand it and turned it off, but then I gritted my teeth and ventured back in for about half of it. I am surprised that so many of the reviewers here have ignored or dismissed this deficiency as irrelevant. What could be more important than the sound?

Fortunately, there are alternatives, one being the delicious film by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, also featuring an all-star cast (also including Kiri Te Kanawa as the Countess) and the estimable Mozartean, Karl Bhm, conducting the Vienna Philharmonic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Le-Nozze-di-Figaro-The-Marriage-of-Figaro/dp/B0007P0LNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart - Le Nozze di Figaro (The Marriage of Figaro)</a>. To be fair, however, the Ponnelle film is one of those strange hybrids between movie and opera--not a live stage performance. Made only three years later than this video, the film benefits from having the sound recorded in a studio, even though it meant that the singers had to lip-sync their arias. More directly comparable is a much more recent Covent Garden production, stunningly beautiful on Blu-ray&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Le-Nozze-di-Figaro-Blu-ray/dp/B0028O34SG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Le Nozze di Figaro [Blu-ray</a>], but a little lacking in the vocal department on the women's side. To find a stage production on video that did full justice to this miraculous score, I had to return to the 1985 Met performance with Kathleen Battle and Frederica von Stade. Alas, it is not available for sale; but one can stream it for a modest price from the Met's Website. The picture quality is comparable to that on this release (not very good, but bearable), and the audio is better.

Back to the performance at hand, it is wonderful to see Te Kanawa and von Stade in their younger days, and this would make a good one-time rental, but is definitely not for the opera library if one cares about the sound. As far as the video is concerned, I did not find it particularly objectionable; unlike the audio, it is not critical to the enjoyment of the music; and it is quite serviceable in terms of showing the costumes, action, and sets. Its quality is slightly better than standard-broadcast TV, though well short of the best available on DVD. (The aforementioned Bhm DVD, on the other hand, having been made from a film rather than a TV broadcast, comes close to the full quality available on DVDs, even though, like this video, it is in the old non-wide-screen 4:3 format.)

Returning again to the merits of the performance itself, the singing is about as close to perfection as it gets; but the ensemble between the singers and orchestra is just OK, suffering from the lapses that are all but unavoidable in live performance. If this production were available on a DVD that was of at least average quality, or if the performance itself were so miraculous as to brush aside any technical objections, it would be worth owning; unfortunately, neither is the case.",1253577600,19,3841,5.191935483870968
309310,4,6301016416,"I'll try not to repeat what has already been said about this performance, but rather just give a quick impression.
Firstly I have heard this conducted better and the title role as played by Knut Skram was a tad weak, both in the way he acted and sung. Pritchard actually led the orchestra very well but a few times the singers seemed to be going one way and the orchestra another.

Benjamin Luxon and Ileana Cotrubas sing their roles to perfection, but the real jewels of the opera are Kiri Te Kanawa as the Countess and Frederica von Stade, who sings the best Cherubino I've yet heard.
I'm of the opinion that a good Susanna can carry this opera (and no doubt Cotrubas could) but there is no question Kiri Te Kanawa is the center of the show here. The other players were great as well. Marius Rintzler as Dr. Bartolo stole his scenes.

My personal preference is the Haitink/Fleming/Finley/Hagley Nozze done in '94 at Glyndebourne for a DVD performance though taken individual by individual this '73 performance is better.",1242950400,2,1022,4.6722222222222225
309311,5,6301016416,"Even after many years, this production, with the marvelous Kiri Te Kanawa as the Countess, is still the best Marriage of Figaro production I have ever seen.  Frederica von Stade is outstanding as Cherubino, and Benjamin Luxon is a wonderful Count.  I initially didn't care much for Ileana Cotrubas as Susanna, but after repeated viewings I have come to appreciate how sublimely she performs.  Knut Skram is an excellent Figaro.",1238112000,2,427,5.071428571428571
309312,5,6301016416,"GLYNDEBOURNE FESTIVAL, 1973

What is it with Mozart? His symphonic music and concertos are charming but, after so many years, do rather show their age. Yes, everything is wonderful and the notes are all in the right place, but somehow it's all a little too formal, formulaic even. It's nice music to dance a waltz to or introduce a tone deaf friend to the riches of classical music with, but...sometimes you feel if you've heard one piano concerto you've heard them all.

Now this is definitely not the case when we examine Mozart's operas--and particularly the three almost perfect operas he wrote with the Italian librettist, Lorenzo Da Ponte. These three works are as alive today in the operatic repertoire as they were in Mozart's day: or even more famous now really as, at the time of composition, Mozart was in a largely losing battle with Salieri and Martin Y Soler for courtly recognition. The Duke of Vienna famously remarked to the composer on hearing Figaro: ""A beautiful work maestro, but too many notes"", to which Mozart (equally famously) replied: ""Just as many as necessary my lord"". It seems amazing to us now that the ears of the listeners of the time didn't immediately inform them that this was the work of a majestic genius and that the tinkling tunes of Salieri and Co. were no more than workaday stuff. Yet as Ezra Pound informs us in his poem Hugh Selwyn Mauberley, ""no one knows at sight a masterpiece"".

With Figaro, probably for the first time, Mozart fully realised the intricate complexity of his musical art. This is exciting music. This is character driven music. This is music where the intertwining vocal lines express cynicism, hope, love, hate, ambition and sly craftiness. Each individual vocal and instrumental line perfectly unfolds the inner drama of a character, yet at the same time adds something to the contrapuntal and emotional whole. Duets and trios abound and slowly but surely Mozart builds up to his overwhelming sestets that usually close an act with sublime confusion, joy or fear. The orchestra in Mozart's operas is never merely present to give an ""oom-pa-pa"" accompaniment, but interacts in a symbiotic way with the vocal lines: gurgling woodwind underscores the irony of Musetto's claim that he knows Don Giovanni to be a ""cavaliere"" or gentleman and flashing strokes of the violins bring Figaro to its joyful conclusion.

So what about this 1973 Glyndebourne production? As a teenager, it was this televised production that fully stirred my interest in Mozart and opera in general. Yes, I fell a little bit in love with the Countess, Susanna and Frederica Von Stade's stunning Cherubino; yet looking back after all these years I can only commend myself for my good taste. The leading singers--Kiri Te Kanawa, Ileana Cotrubas, Von Stade, and Benjamin Luxon--really are superb. Knut Skram is very good as Figaro and the fact that he subsequently decided to spend most of his time in Norway should not blind us to the fact that he is a very good singer. The secondary roles are also exceptionally well sung. Nucci Condo as Marcellina comes in for a special mention because she brings this somewhat dull part to multi-faceted life with her protestations and sly exclamations. John Pritchard conducts the orchestra with a keen ear for sonic effect within a small auditorium, and the costumes and direction (the latter by Peter Hall) are both quite superb.

If you don't have any other performance of Figaro on DVD, then this is the one you should get.

309313,5,6301016416,"As Cherubion, Frederica Von Stade made tingles race up my spine when she sang Voi che sapete che cosa. This to me is what opera is about- timeless beauty, energy, and dramatic human emotion.
  This is the first time I have heard Kiri Te Kanawa, she was divine. The energy and connection between The Countess and Susanna was delightful.  Ileana Cotrubas as Susanna was fantastic; she brought a sense of playful, mischievous fun to the role.  Ileana made her character feel real for me. Her timing was perfect. She portrayed Susanna as a well rounded flesh and blood young woman- humorous, warm, loving, and loyal as well as being jealous, sneaky, and cunning when necessary. From the women you couldn't have hoped for more.
  I bought a copy after I saw it. I had temporarily hooked my DVD player straight to the TV- once I pick up another optic cable and run it through the sound system the sound can only get better.",1217980800,2,917,4.595092024539877

The Glyndebourne Festival Opera is done on a small stage, making it a more personal presentation. Get it and enjoy it.",1202515200,4,385,4.422535211267606
309315,5,6301016416,"The reviews I have read hailing Kiri Te Kanawa's performance were fully justified. She has a beautiful voice which she uses to effortlessly explore the full range of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro.

I would rate the overall sound quality a 4, considering the cast as a whole did not fully enunciate as loud as the accompanying orchestra. Other nitpicky things: The recitatives were overly fast, as if they were trying to rush through to the next song, and I thought Frederica von Stade was a bit too feminine for the part of Cherubino (yes, it's a female part playing a young boy, but again, that's my opinion).

The chemistry of the duets was exceptional. I particularly enjoyed the Countess and Susanna singing the song to the air. Te Kanawa and Cotrubas sounded especially inspired. Again, the word ""effortless"" seems appropriate for such a beautiful performance.

The Marriage of Figaro is by far my favorite opera, and this is the third performance I have bought on DVD. Having worn out the DVD of the first performance I bought, I had to get different ones to appreciate the variations in other performances. And being resistant to change, I am always surprised when I prefer a subsequent performance to a previously viewed one. It is easy to see though, why this 30+ year old performance still retains a high demand with viewers. In short, it is a welcome addition to my collection, and I highly recommend it.",1195603200,5,1417,4.775510204081633

I am personally quite taken with some of the Met productions I've seen, but this is right up there with them, and in some cases (Contrubas' Susanna, Skram's Figaro), this production exceeds any of the Met performances I've heard. Of course, Frederica von Stade is THE definitive Cherubino, in singing and acting, and Kiri Te Kanawa is brilliant as the Countess.",1174780800,6,517,5.166666666666667

309383,5,6301016416,"This surpasses the old Guilini set as the best Figaro on record, either cd or dvd.

Its hard to imagine a better Susanna than Cotrubas in her prime, a better countess than Te Kanawa in her prime, and a better Cherubino than Von Stade in her prime.  The other parts are nearly as good, with Luxon shining as one of the best counts ever. I found Skram's Figaro a bit dull, but its a very steady performance nonetheless.  Bartolo, Marcellina, Alfonso and Barbarina are all excellent.

Pritchard's conducting is very sharp and disciplined, the kind of conducting that one can listen to over and over and never tire of.  It does not have the hushed sense of magic that Guilini often evokes, but at the same time is more straight forward and less self-conscious.  The playing is for the most part, immaculate.  The wood wind shine especially, which means alot in Figaro.

Its also well staged and filmed rather naturally and has another benefit of excellent subtitles and switching of camera's to help make sense of the text for those new to the opera.  Of course there is so much wit and fast comedy in Figaro, not everything can be captured, but they manage to get alot in, much more than, for example, Haitink's recent Glyndebourne Figaro which has very vague titles and poor camerawork.

With all these plusses, the minor minus of Skram's mediocre Figaro hardly detracts from this magnificent issue.

There is unfortunately however, a rather major minus: the sound quality.  The whole thing seems to have been recorded with a pair of mikes sitting in the orchestra pit and the resulting sound is strident, completely lacking in dynamics.  It starts to tax the ear that everyone seems to be singing and playing at the same volume all the time, and the soundstage is very cramped.  You might be able to work some wonders with equalization, but I found the sound a rather large blot on this otherwise top shelf favorite of all my opera recordings.

Nevertheless, when you see and hear Cotrubas in the part she was born to play, playing it to perfection, or Te Kanawa capture the sorrow and nobility of the Countess so meetly, or Luxon's lovely suave voice matching his guilefull looks so well,I think you will agree this is still one of the best opera discs out there.",1159315200,14,2263,4.679292929292929

309385,5,6301016416,"When I first dabbled into Le Nozze di Figaro I decided to start at the library. I chose the version from the two they had because:

1. It has Kiri Te Kanawa- one of my favorite opera singers of all time

2. It was a Glyndebourne production (in which I had already seen Die Zauberflote and Don Giovanni.)

I was not too enthusiastic because I tried to get into Cosi Fan Tutte but that didn't go very well. But the vivid plotline and talented singers quickly changed my mind. Though there were some-very, very few- bad things the good things cancelled them out. The bad things were: it was a rather old-fashioned production with very sterile sets but the singers make the sets bright with color when they are singing. The good things are innumerable but I will TRY to sum it up: Kiri Te Kanawa is a very lovely and luscious singer and handle her voice with a certain dignity yet anguish in her role as the countess. Benjamin Luxon was great as the count and made me believe he really loved Susanna. Speaking of Susanna, Ileana Cotrubas was a very good Susanna as was her husband Figaro. Knut Skram is virtually unknown singer and makes the best of that by having at least one good performance. Nucci Condo and Martius Rintzler are very believable as Marcellina and Bartolo. Marcellina was THE best I have ever seen. In her duet with Susanna she holds her own and in ""Il capro e la capretta"" one of the greatest I have ever seen. Fredericka von Stade is a perfectly believable Cherubino-the best I had ever seen. John Fryatt is very believable as my favorite character Don Basilio. He has a certain sneakiness to him  that makes him very believable. His ""In quegli anni"" is a highlight of the DVD. Which brings me to a very confusing situation. At the library all they had was the video version of this and it had Marcellina and Basilio's arias cut. I have no idea why so I went to Borders and found the DVD. It was 185 minutes while the Vhs was 165 minutes. I couldn't find and explanation for it so I bought it and watched and there they were Basilio's and Marcellina's arias not cut! I was very happy because these are my two favorite arias in the whole opera. Even the minors were good and held their place. The best minor character was Elisabeth Gale as Barbarina. Overall the best ""Figaro"" I have ever seen.",1146700800,9,2310,4.441037735849057
309386,5,6301016416,"Let me start off by saying that this an early seventies telecast of a Glyndebourne production, so the picture and sound quality aren't as pristine as you're likely get from, say, a recent Met broadcast. The picture is grainy, the colors occasionally garish, with video ""ghosts"" trailing the performers. The sound isn't as balanced between singers and orchestra as it would be in a modern recording, and the singing sounds rough, just a little, at times. No matter. That shouldn't deter any prospective buyers. This is a great Figaro at a great price. Why? It's Glyndebourne of course. And, more than anything else, it's the singers, baby, the singers!

The three female leads could not have been more ideally cast. Just imagine Kiri te Kanawa as the Countess, Ileana Cortubas as Susanna and Frederica von Stade as Cherubino. Then imagine all three of these lovely, obscenely talented young women in the same cast of the same production. Your heart's already beating a little faster? Okay, imagine them onstage AT THE SAME TIME, as they are during Act Two. Then be prepared to take a trip to Mozartean heaven. Each woman was born to sing her respective role, and it shows here, with nary a false note among them. Von Stade's Voi che sapete and te Kanawa's Dove sono are as fine renditions as you are likely to hear.

The men fare almost as well. I had never heard of Benjamin Luxon before, but his Count simply blew me away! His voice is overpowering, and his dramatic skills just as good, portraying all the arrogance, self-delusion and blustery confusion necessary for an exemplary rendition. Knut Skrum, our Figaro, was another new name for me, and to be honest, I wasn't nearly as excited by his performance as I was with Luxon's. Skrum hits the right notes, and he takes away the buffoonish elements that are often given to the character, which I feel is appropriate, I like seeing Figaro as a suave and savvy individual. I just feel that his portrayal is missing something, both vocally and dramatically, that extra ""oomph"" that would have sent it into the stratosphere. Still, this is hardly a fatal flaw, or even a flaw at all. When you have a good Figaro, and a great everybody else(the supporting cast is quite good), then this is a Nozze di Figaro for the ages.

John Pritchard leads a jaunty, uncut rendition of the score(all the act four arias are here). The traditional sets are so good as to be inconspicuous; in other words, the set designers have created such a convincing interior of a Count's estate that the singers blend in naturally with the surroundings, and the audience is left to admire the wonderful music.

The other Glyndebourne release of this opera, with Rene Fleming as the Countess, is quite good. Apparently the Met will release its unconventional production very soon(it features a couple of rare arias and a mezzo-soprano, Cecilia Bartoli, in the role of Susanna). Still, this Figaro is the one to own on DVD, it's certainly the one I am likely to return to more than any other.",1143244800,37,3013,4.744274809160306

This is music DVD and audio quality is so bad that it is almost noise.
This DVD is a crime against Mozart, and the producers should be sued.
I can't judge how good the performance is because the audio quality is so bad.
Can't just enjoy this marvelous opera since the audio quality so annoyingly bad.
Listening to this DVD is like a torture. I had to stop in the middle.
One of the major problems, I found, is that the recording level is so high.
Most of DVDs do not hit the high ceiling of the equalizer in my system.
This DVD hits the ceiling of the equalizer most of the time. When sound is recorded
like that, it is most likely that the signal is distorted (over-saturation), which is
in this DVD's case.

Video quality is not any better than its audio quality. I have a bunch of DVD transfer from
my old VHS tapes. None of them is worse than this DVD.

I endured to skip over to Cherubino's ""Voi che sapete"", and it is not as worse as its audio/video quality,
but still worse than many other wonderful performances. Orchestra performance
is the same low quality.  Clarinet, bassoon, and first violin could have been much
better -  I heard even amateur orchestra playing better than this for accompayning
""Voi che sapete"".

The duet, Sull'aria is wonderfully performed by Kiri Te Kanawa (the other singer was just OK).
Sadly, the bad audio quality completely dumb'ed down her beautiful voice.
This happens not only in Sull'aria. In many other her arias also.

This DVD is for rent. Not for keep. If you want to keep one (or two) copy of
Le Nozze di Figaro, please keep looking. You will probably enjoy much more with
CDs than this DVD. I have so many Le Nozze di Figaro's in various media - LP,
cassette, CD, iTunes. And this DVD is the worst.
I have absolutely no clue about how other reviews gave this DVD five stars.
Besides the audio/video quality, the performance lacks enthusiams, imagination,
and creativity - which are the most important factors in art.

Please watch James Levine's Magic Flute. You will probably give it five stars.
And this DVD is not in the same/similar league as Jame Levine's Magic Flute DVD.
What we need is Le Nozze di Figaro of  James Levine's Magic  Flute qaulity - sound/video/performance.
Sadly, James Levine left for Boston Symphony Orchestra.",1117324800,20,2361,4.575829383886256

A good cast can't overcome the bad conducting of this divine opera.  The beat is too relentless, so the true beauty of the melodic phrasing is not given enough expression.

7809405,2,6301016416,"While I am a frequent critic of the vulgarity and excess of some modern productions, this one is perfect example of the silliness of some of the past, and perhaps it is productions like this that give a clue to what modern directors are trying to avoid.

I got the DVD mostly due to Frederica von Stade, whose recording of Cherubino sounded marvelous to me, even though it was apparent that today's style of singing this piece is different.  Yet I wanted to see her live.  Well, if we start with her, she is not a very convincing Cherubino.  It is the first, but not the last time when I will point to a masterpiece film of the same opera -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Le-Nozze-di-Figaro-The-Marriage-of-Figaro/dp/B0007P0LNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart - Le Nozze di Figaro (The Marriage of Figaro)</a>&nbsp;but there the director was Jean-Pierre Ponnelle,  so everything was a perfection, at least when it comes to acting and mise-en-scene.

Here, von Stade does not look or act like a young Don Juan - even her gorgeous singing does not mesmerize enough to see a well-behave good girl, a perfect Cinderella, but not a garzon malnato.  One can compare ""Voi che sapete"" on this DVD with a video of  the same aria from the Met's 1985 production, also von Stade singing, and what a difference a set makes!  The link is in Comments section of this review.  But again, it is Ponnelle who made the Met's staging, and then everything shines, while here everything bores.

This Glyndebourne production relies heavily on Susanna's sugary smiles, which are so indiscriminate and so out of place that they make Ileana Cotrubas look like a little cute monkey, always grimacing.  It was especially silly when the awkward and so typically English-looking Figaro sand with utmost dullness ""Non pi andrai"" and Cotrubas is giggling so foolishly throughout, although the scene is actually very sadistic - poor Cherubino is scared to death to go to the army, and as it is often in this opera and in all of Mozart's mature operas, laughter and tears are interwoven.  But this production does not even rise to the level of such subtleties.

Figaro stands still like a pagan idol when singing ""Se vuol ballare"";  Contessa is also mostly immobile and she behaves like a Jane Austin personage, with no hint of the boiling sensuality that is embedded in her role.  The Count is truly a bizarre appearance - I have never seen a bearded Count before!  Everyone knows that a man in such a hot desire, or simply a lustful but elegant seducer, plus an aristocrat in this case, is cleanly shaven!  Ovid speaks of a necessity of clean face, but the certain Peter Hall, a stage director for this pathetic ""Le Nozze"", was obviously left unaware.  The image of the Count is a prefiguration of Don Giovanni, and can anyone imagine a bearded Dissoluto???  But as throughout this performance, it is not just an incongruous visuals, but also disappointing audio - the singing is devoid of any expression, left alone bringing out the depth of a role's character.  The great  aria ""Vedr mentr'io sospiro""  (where on can catch a glimpse of a theme Beethoven used in  ""Waldstein"" sonata, dedicated to a Count!) is completely bland, sung by the Count whose image exudes only propriety and zero mischief.

Susanna here is just a silly girl, and Cotrubas singing is as flat as everyone else; the same vocal quality goes for the zombied Te Kanawa, who in Ponnelle's film is an amazing vulnerable yet sly Countess!

Add to all this the inept orchestral direction; the orchestra is either too fast or too slow for just about any number in this spectacle.  Anyway, it is not worth to dedicate more to describing this non-entity of ""Le Nozze"".  I cannot reproach it in being vulgar, but it is hopelessly unexciting.  There are many productions on DVD vastly superior to this one in all respects;  and YouTube version with von Stade is an incomparably better alternative to this amateurish tepid staging.

Last time I have seen ""Le Nozze"" in La Fenice, with Alex Esposito in the title role, Markus Werba the Count, Rosa Feole as Susanna and Carmela Remigio la Contessa.  The action was placed in the atmosphere of Oliver Twist, grim and dark, with the Count whipping ans spanking Cherubino, raping Susanna, tying up his wife - a true British hypocrite and a monster in the style of Dr. Jekyll.  The problem with that staging was that it was not funny at all, even if the singing was superb.  The Countess in that production jumped out of the window, unable to bear the abuse of her husband.  That director probably was much impressed by Tosca,  yet in a way it was such a shocking interpretation that it produced boisterous boo - audience was definitely not sedated by what they've seen.  But will I boo this one?  I'll be too bored to do that.

A severe disappointment.",1343088000,4,4879,4.846618357487923
7809406,5,6301016416,"You won't find a better ""Nozze di Figaro"". Any quibbling about the sound and video quality must be tempered by the fact that techonlogy has advanced exponentially since the 1970s. VHS, a deeply flawed format even then, ruled. There was no hi-def or digital. How did we ever get by? But how much would we give to hear Mozart conducting, even through ancient recording techniques, had there been any?

First of all, there can never have been a Countess or a Cherubino to rival Kiri Te Kanawa and Frederica Von Stade. They simply are the characters. TeKanawa's every move, every glance, every note contain such elegance, charm and sympathy that she touches me deeply. And she is not above a little harmless flirtation, but never for a moment is she less than a great lady.

You can literally feel Cherubino's hormones raging. This boy can think of nothing but sex, and always turns up at the wrong place at the wrong time, which keeps the pot boiling.

The relationship between the Count and Countess has so many layers that it is staggering. Their entire complex situation is spelled out fully in Mozart's music. Their knock-down-drag-out marital brawl in the Act Two finale changes from second to second. One moment he is an abusive jerk, the next a pleading puppy-dog. One moment she is the wronged wife, the next moment she uses her situation to her advantage.  When Susanna steps out of the closet, she relishes all aspects of the moment, and her look of phony innocence and surprise is priceless. The Countess' heart literally stops right at her throat. A delicious comic moment, perfectly timed.

Luzon embodies the Count, although his Italian is a bit flawed in his great Act III aria. Skram makes a fine Figaro. Cotrubas is a smart Susanna who is a true friend to her mistress, but she needs a few more expressions (if only the greatly missed Lucia Popp had been Susanna in this production). The rest of the cast are expert in their roles, right down to the drunken gardener Antonio. How Mozart keeps him completely in character during the chaotic Act Two finale is just one of a million miracles in this inexhaustible score.

The director, Peter Hall, has taken every single cue from Mozart and DaPonte, doing them full justice from start to finish. The small scale set for the small Glyndebourne stage is detailed and always apt. The closing chorus in the final moments of this opera rises to the heavens. The final moments literally explode in a burst of joy, complete with fireworks, as all cast members face the audience and declare that the comedy is over and it is time to party. Was there ever a better ending to a comedy?

This is as close to what Mozart would have produced as I can imagine. Anyone who goes through life without knowing ""The Marriage of Figaro"" has missed out on one of its great treasures. By all means enjoy other productions, but this is the one to keep. You will smile from start to finish, and end up maybe even a little better for it. Mozart's genius makes me happy to be alive.",1333670400,3,3017,4.638576779026217
