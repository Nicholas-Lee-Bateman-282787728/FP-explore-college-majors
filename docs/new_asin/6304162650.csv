8606829,5,6304162650,Thank you for the service with the Cosmos-Heaven and Hell series.  I teach astronomy and there is a section in the video that shows a location in Siberia where a comet or asteroid struck in 1908.  Really interesting and it shows the footage from the 1920s when it was investigated.,1351036800,,281,4.6
