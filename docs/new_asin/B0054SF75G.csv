8457007,5,B0054SF75G,"Regarded with great affection by children of a certain age, the classic 80's/90's British television programme T-BAG has now been released on DVD, after years of tireless campaigning by the fans who'd never let it die.  One of the most imaginative series of it's time, T-BAG ran for nine seasons, each one a complete adventure in itself.  The basic premise was simple: a little girl would have to collect a certain series of magical objects in an effort to stop power-mad witch T-Bag from destroying the world.

In Series 3 (T-BAG BOUNCES BACK, 1987), an old musical box in the Curiosity Shop becomes the latest home for T-Bag (Elizabeth Estensen) and her evil weed, the T-Plant.  With T-Shirt (John Hasler) firmly back under her control, she banishes Major Happy (Tony Haygarth) from his mansion and scatters the bells from his magical golden glockenspiel throughout the various lands painted on the sides of the musical box.  For the last time, Debbie (Jennie Stallwood) must ""think small"" and gather up the bells so that harmony can be restored to the world.

By this point in the series, the educational aspect was dropped and it truly started becoming a full-on comedy/adventure.  Writers Lee Pressman and Grant Cathro peppered their scripts with material that tickled adults as well as children - one of the reasons why the show has kept on appealing to it's ever-ageing original fans.  Sadly it's in T-BAG BOUNCES BACK that fans had to say goodbye to Jennie Stallwood's feisty Debbie.  On the edge of her teens, Stallwood decided to leave the series, and left fans devastated in the process (in the subsequent years of the show, very few of the girls had the amount of smart-alec spunk that Debbie had).

I have very fond memories of watching T-BAG as a child.  It was most often screened during school holidays here in Australia, and I used to have to arrange the rest of my holiday actitivies around the show!  I loved it so much - and still do.  To have the show on DVD is an absolute dream come true.  This DVD includes all 10 episodes from the series, plus special bonuses supplied by production designer John Plant and writers Pressman and Cathro.",1316995200,,2160,4.771505376344086
