8601546,5,B00E5ONIQU,I sent this to a paralyzed Razorback fan and he really enjoyed it.,1425254400,,66,4.153846153846154
8601547,5,B00E5ONIQU,"My excitement for this coming season just doubled after seeing the new Razorbacks Football DVD. Two years ago, the head coach (Bobby Petrino) had the personality of a Grumpy Old Man. Last year, the ""temporary"" coach (John L. Smith) had the credibility of a stand-up comedian. But the new coach Bret Bielema is the real deal folks! Smart, focused, disciplined and proven. He seems like a really nice-guy too, but only when appropriate because he's clearly bad news for the other teams on game day! The video has a lot of interviews with coaches and player discussing strategies for the 2013 season, and lots of new footage from practices, scrimmages and training. This is a must-see video for all Razorbacks fans, but keep it quiet when talking to other S.E.C. friends! We don't want this year's opponents to be prepared for the whooping our Hogs are about to deliver on them! Whoop-Whoop-Woo-Pig-Sooey!!",1377216000,,903,4.947368421052632
8601548,5,B00E5ONIQU,"I'm a big-time Arkansas Razorbacks Football fan.  So I've pretty much seen-it-all, and feel like my standards are set very high.  That's why my wife and kids were so impressed when we watched this video, as it hits a professional high-mark that college sports DVDs rarely achieve.  The opening sequence brings goose-bumps of excitement, and the content of the rest of the program (mostly the coaching staff and sports media analysts - intercut with team footage and player interviews), is snappy and to the point.  And what is the point?  I won't do a spoiler here, but let's just say that a lot of competitors in the S.E.C. are not going to expect what they're about to get when they take on this impressive 2013 Arkansas team!",1377043200,,728,4.700787401574803
