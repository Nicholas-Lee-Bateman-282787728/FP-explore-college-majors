I happened upon this show and loved it more than any of the PR or Sentai that I've seen--which at this point is probably more than I needed to watch. I love how this show spoofs and celebrates the Sentai shows. Not knowing the original shows does not break the allusions because of how the delusional--and lovable--characters explain the world around them.

I can watch Power Rangers and Sentai shows and enjoy the production of rubber suits and explosions. This is one of the shows that packages it in a way where I want to really dig into the stories. Zebraman and Zebraman 2: Attack on Zebra City do the same.",1499212800,,733,4.389705882352941
