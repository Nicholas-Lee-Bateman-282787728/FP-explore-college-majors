7981791,5,B00008DAMB,"This was the very first Swedish film I ever watched.  I watched it as an American exchange student in 1984 with Swedish classmates.  Although I did not yet speak Swedish, there was not a great need for translation.  Not only is this movie well done visually which helps to tell the story but the music/songs really make the movie.  Hands down, it is still my all time favorite movie, one of the very few I can watch over and over.  Humor, adventure and some mild suspense as well.  Highly recommended for upper elementary children and up.  (parts might scare small children).",1259366400,9,575,4.633663366336633
