3674593,4,B001KZH2I2,"Funny movie with some great one liners. If you want to watch a goofy comedy with a little heart this is for you. Paul Rudd is a very underapreciated actor and shines in this movie. Sean William Scott and Mc'lovin are quite funny as well, this is just a really good movie all the way through. Yes it has some bad language but it's funny the way it is used. If you enjoyed the 40 year old virgin, american pie, superbad you will like this movie.",1236124800,,443,4.162790697674419
3674594,5,B001KZH2I2,"It's Stifler, McLovin, Paul Rudd, and a scene-stealing, foul-mouthed mini-Chris Rock, as if this movie had any chance of being anything other than hilarious.

Essentially the story sets up as a Big Brother, Big Sister meets Animal House. It's wild antics, hilarious situations, and little kids dropping the F-bomb. The cast works perfectly together, with not only comedic chemistry, but also the mentorship feel expected of people involved in an organization that helps youngsters.

As a pair of immature pitchmen for an energy drink called Minotaur, Danny (Paul Rudd) and Wheeler (Sean William Scott) tour through schools together preaching a stay off drugs message, but in life they are moving in different directions. Danny hates his job and equates it with poisoning and killing children. Meanwhile, Wheeler, who wears the actual big-headed Minotaur costume, absolutely loves his daily existence, wearing his ""game face"" daily. Each of their love lives plays a large factor into how their outlook on life is shaped. Danny's lawyer girlfriend Beth (Elizabeth Banks) is becoming increasingly irritated by his attitude. Wheeler's successfully promiscuous lifestyle couldn't make him happier deviant. When Danny acts up one too many times, his life falls apart and he presents himself and Wheeler with a not-so-difficult decision: go to jail or serve 150 hours as a role model in a program called Sturdy Wings, run by an insane, BS-proof, ex-drug addict Gayle (Jane Lynch).

They meet Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson - who absolutely steals every scene), young boys with unique difficulties for their ""Bigs"". Augie is a nerd; imagine that. He's immersed in a world of a pseudo Dungeons and Dragons lifestyle that has him in capes, wielding foam swords, and talking in a pathetic attempt at old English. He's a kid who needs manly advice and guidance; the pairing with an apathetic Danny couldn't be worse. Ronnie is a wise-cracking, foul-mouthed, boob-obsessed child of a single mother. He drops the F-bomb like he's reading for Goodfellas 2, and is purposefully confrontational with any father-figure. He yearns for and requires a more delicate approach, a person to fight through the tough faade and find the little boy who needs help. A hyper, inattentive Wheeler is the opposite of ideal.

The resulting riot provides a million laughs, a few digs at Ben Affleck, a final battle involving the land of ""Kiss MyAnthia"", some clever yet crude humor, and a good deal of heart, as the four reluctantly learn from one another while becoming friends and overcoming love and life difficulties.

Highly recommended for a great blend between crass comedy and loveable life lessons.",1235865600,,2706,5.225806451612903

3674596,3,B001KZH2I2,"I had high expectation for RM, given positive reviews and a stellar cast.  The story also seems intriguing. It revolves around four guys, two adults and two teens, each lost in their own way.  They manage to find friendship and acceptance in one another and their families by the end of the film.

Well, after seeing it, I have to say I was underwhelmed.  The comedy is just not there.  I only chuckled once or twice.  It is painful to watch talented Paul Rudd, Seann William Scott and Elizabeth Banks get buried by an inept script and dreadful dialogs.  The movie deserves 2 stars.  I added one more for the final staged medieval battle scene--many 12 year old boys' fantasy.  For quality raunchy buddy comedy, look elsewhere.",1235174400,2,727,4.661417322834645
3674597,4,B001KZH2I2,"The trailers didn't do this movie any favors. Judging by those I never even thought about seeing Role Models in theaters, but when I saw all the positive reviews from critics I decided to give it a chance. I'm really glad I did.

The chemistry between the cast is very good, especially Seann William Scott and Paul Rudd. They easily carry the movie and provide loads of laughs, but lets not forget about all the wacky side characters. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays a nerd like no one else, Bobb'e J. Thompson spits out the worst language you will ever hear out of a young kid and Jane Lynch straddles that weird/crazy line yet again.

I also can't fail to mention the great use of the band KISS. The songs ""Love Gun"" and ""Detroit Rock City"" get play in the flick. Just wait until you see the fantasy battle at the end with the four main characters dressed up as KISS. My theater erupted with laughter.

It's great to see a funny comedy that balances being crude and having some heart. Role Models has both and is also quite unique to boot.",1234396800,7,1040,4.463157894736842

3674599,5,B001KZH2I2,"Having worked with children as both an overnight camp counselor and a day care worker, I can identify easily with our ""Role Model"" heroes and the children in their care! This magnificent film pushes all the right buttons.

You start out with two very self-centered and immature men and you get to watch an amazing metamorphosis take place! These two guys, who are as different from each other as the characters from ""The Odd Couple,"" learn to care about someone other than themselves!

This story has so many layers! It's first, and foremost, very funny! Being originally from the New York metropolitan area, I found the frank and very direct foul language to be quite refreshing!

Since one of the story's characters was involved with LARP (costumed, role-playing games held outdoors), I actually got inspired! When I got home I hopped on the Internet and found out that Maryland has America's oldest LARP-type organization! So this is NOT just make-believe from a Hollywood film, but a highly organized form of recreation for adults!

By the time the final scene from Role Models crossed the big screen my eyes began to mist! This outrageous comedy is actually quite moving and profound! Was I pleasantly surprised!

3674651,4,B001KZH2I2,"This movie is pretty typical of Paul Rudd's more recent comedies.  He was actually a co-writer on this one.  He plays Danny, a guystuck in a dead end job, pushing energy drinks on high school students in a stay off drugs campaign.  Sean William Scott, plays yet another version of Stifler (he has basically become a character actor playing a version of Stifler in every movie he does).  He is the mascot for the energy drink and fine being a slacker with no responsibility.  When they end up getting in trouble with the law, they are sentenced to community service acting as big brothers for a couple of kids at a place called Sturdy Wings.

From there it is a pretty formulaic, raunchy comedy with lessons about growing up, responsibility and to some extent family.  Rudd and Scott play their characters well, but the stand outs are Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Augie Farks, who follows up his great performance in Superbad, as a different kind of nerdy kid, who is into live action role playing D&D like games, Bobb'e J. Thompson as Ronnie Shields a foul mouthed 11 year old only child of a single mother, Jane Lynch as Gayle Sweeney the director of Sturdy Wings and former cocaine addict who has no problem oversharing about her days as a junkie, and Ken Jeong as King Argotron, the leader of the role playing group.  Elizabeth Banks is also in the film as Danny's girlfriend and lawyer.  She does a good job with what she has to do, but once the kids are introduced her character is pretty much sidelined for most of the movie.  The R rating, is well deserved, mostly for the language.  There are a couple brief flashes of nudity and a lot of suggestive sexual dialog, but there is not much in the way of actual sex.  But a ton of swearing all throughout.  So if that would bother you, then it is best to skip this.

For those who get the blu ray, for extras there are a couple making of, and behind the scenes features, a gag reel and 40+ minutes of deleted scenes.  There is also a commentary track on the theatrical version of the film with the director David Wain that is pretty funny in parts, but mostly just talking about the various aspects of production.  Good for what is there.

This is definitely not a movie for everyone.  But if you are a fan of the recent adult comedies (think most of the Apatow movies) then you will likely enjoy this.  It is not deep or complex in any way, and does not really try to take itself too seriously.  It is not something that was every going to compete for an Oscar or even be mentioned with the greatest comedies of all time, but if you accept it for what it is and what it is not, it is an enjoyable way to pass an hour and a half or so.",1462147200,,2688,4.348697394789579

Very crude, don't watch it if you're easily offended.  I've seen both the unrated and the rated version. They're practically the same, but there are two very brief scenes that I can recall in the unrated version that are hysterical.  Mainly just adult language, nothing too bad.

3674758,1,B001KZH2I2,"1st this movie isn't at all funny. Not only is the depiction of the black kids racist (he is constantly cursing and it was ok for the grown ups in the movie to curse in front of him, including Lynch's character saying she gave a blow job to the judge). I guess he wasn't good enough to be put on the cover like the white kid. The dinner scene at the house was not at all funny, it just depicts pathetic parents who don't appreciate having a good son. I mean, he was going out and getting fresh air and exercise by playing in the tournament instead of sitting at home playing video games or just hanging out at the mall. There is nothing remotely realistic about this film and yes I know it's (supposed to be) a comedy, but why would a judge make two men who did what they did be role models, I mean Paul Rudd's character did what he did at a high school and this made judge think he would be good with kids. Why wasn't that statue damaged from that big a** truck landing on it? I also want to know why was this midevil event held during the week when everyone would be at work and the kids at school. Seeing that the earlier in the film they were supposed to be talking and selling their monster drinks to kids at school I know it was not summer. I know this because Paul was supposed to be at court and the courts are only open Monday through Friday. They never establish who the guy is at Paul Rudd's mentee's house is. I mean is he the mother's live in boyfriend or husband, because at the end he is hitting on Jane Lynch's character. I just don't see Jane Lynch with a guy. At the end, the guy pushing the hot dog in the bun seemed more happy about the implied p***s joke then she did. Stick to acting Paul, writing is not your forte.",1408406400,2,1738,4.099706744868035

3674821,5,B001KZH2I2,"""Stiffler"" and Paul Rudd are in top form in this hilarious slacker comedy that combines awesome comedic innovation with unparalleled writing and delivery. In no other comedy that I've ever before seen, has there been such absurdity when it comes to thinking outside the box. Who else would involve LARPING (Live Action Role Playing) in the story of their tale, much less with Ken Jeong as the ""king"" of this medieval fantasy world? I can't count the number of times this movie forced me to laugh aloud, and what's more, it's got a surprising amount of heart. Many slapstick-style comedies attempt an ill-fitted dose of heart late in their delivery, and the results are less than desirable, with mixed tone and messaging. With ""Role Models"", however, this difficult balance is struck marvelously, and the end product is fantastic. I can't say enough good things about this movie, and I highly recommend it for adult viewers (DON'T watch this one with your kids!) who love comedy! Enjoy... this one flew under the radar, but it should not be missed!",1372809600,,1047,4.887640449438202

3674834,5,B001KZH2I2,"I'm a pretty big fan of all the cheesy comedies Sean William Scott's been in, from American Pie to this latest romp.

Basically he and his comedic cohort get sentenced to community service at a ""Big Brother / Big Sister"" type organization with a kinda' crazy lady as a director. Comedic hilarity ensues. It's all low brow comedy, which is to be expected. Plenty of drug and sexual humor. But it hits all of its marks pretty well.

I especially enjoyed it because of the sub-plot around one of the kids' hobby of ""LAIRE"" which is very similar to ye old live action roleplaying game Amtgard, which I used to participate in way back when. And they captured the feel of that pretty well...

The Blu-ray comes with both the theatrical & unrated cuts of the movie. It also has a pretty good set of special features, with some bloopers, on set, and how they went about creating the live action roleplaying system used in the movie (seems lifted pretty directly from Amtgard, though I seem to recall they deny it came from any one LARP system in particular).

Anyway, overall, if you like this kind of low brow, sophomoric humor (like American Pie, Van Wilder, et al), you'll probably love this movie...",1372032000,,1195,4.596244131455399

I have nothing against movies trying to push the envelope.  That said, I found nothing funny about an eight or nine year old spouting profanity some of it of an extremely scatalogical nature.  The adults in the film don't seem offended but respond to the kid in kind.  This to me smacks of exploitation and I don't think its as cute as the makers of the film seem to think it is.  Where's trying to maintain a child's innocence for as long as possible?  When I was a kid I heard profanity.  I learned not to repeat it in front of my parents after getting my mouth washed out with soap which I'm still tasting some forty years later.

Given the choice between a short jail sentence and one month working with a kids' organization, the two try their luck at babysitting and, predictably, learn a few basic lessons about fatherhood, maturity and responsibility along the way. The generic plot won't buck even the most gullible audience, but in truth it's really only there to give the trove of supporting comedians something to riff on in every scene. Jane Lynch and about two thirds of the cast of MTV's old cult favorite The State make routine appearances, but the best lines come from Bobb'e Thompson, the kid under Scott's supervision. Though he's paired in almost every scene with Christopher Mintz-Plasse (better known as McLovin in 2007's Superbad), Thompson lives and breathes his character while Plasse is merely filling a stiff, redundant role. Produces a few good laughs, with plenty of opportunities for Lynch to make everyone on-screen and off feel totally uncomfortable, but at the end of the day it's no better than average.",1324080000,,1240,5.024271844660194

All I could think of was how was the boy's mom (in the movie or real life) was able to put up with this...I liked the film, but it's not a PG affair, so don't mistake it for a Disney telemovie.

As a comedy, this was a lot better than Knocked Up!, or Zack and Miri Make A Porno. But nowhere near American Pie, Superbad, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, or the 40 Year Old Virgin.  That said, ROLE MODELS has few surprises. Its strength is in its execution.

Paul Rudd is in his inscrutable form and Seann William Scott brings his American Pie pedigree with him (he will always be Stifler to me).  Jane Lynch is as brutal as it gets - was this before Glee??

3674944,5,B001KZH2I2,"An R-rated comedy, Role Models is not your traditional raunchy, sophomoric flick that relies on nonstop slapstick gags and potty humor a la Animal House, American Pie or Something about Mary.  Rather, it is a cleverly scripted, brilliantly cast comedy that also contains a heartfelt, feel good story.

Paul Rudd and Sean William Scott star as Danny and Wheeler, underachieving best friends who have yet to ""grow up"".  Following a bad day at work, they find themselves on probation and court ordered to do 100 hours of community service work as, ironically, Big-Brother mentors to adolescents from broken homes.  Danny is paired with Augie, a nerdy, lonely kid who's sole source of happiness comes from his weekend participation in a local medieval, fantasy role playing game.  Meanwhile, Wheeler is paired with Ronnie, a brash, foul mouthed, pint-sized 12 year old who thinks he knows everything about being a grown up.

Contrary to some of the other reviews I read, I feel that the story that unfolds is not necessarily predictable.  The pair find themselves in hilarious, laugh out loud situation after situation and yet the relationships they form with the adolescents is both tender and believable.  This is not to say that Role Models is a cinematic classic but it is an intelligent, well made comedy that has a good story line and is genuinely funny.",1284249600,,1356,4.969026548672566

3674976,5,B001KZH2I2,"FINALLY I get to watch Role Models!  I must have sat through the commercials advertising this film at least 100 times the last couple years.

Surprisingly, the focus of the storyline is NOT on the ""What?  I don't wanna take my pants off!"" little boy.

Instead the plot focuses on two guys who are forced into a program where they have to take care of two children- two children that have a hard time making friends and need someone to support them.  If the two guys refuse to look after them, they go to prison for the crimes they committed.

The two guys who look after the two kids are both goofy, stupid, vulgar, and just... the wrong choice for ""role models"", haha.  But I guess that's what makes the movie so darn good.

By the way, the small running joke of whether that's actually Paul McCartney who wrote a song with the Wings called ""Love Take Me Down to the Streets"" is in fact, NOT true.  The guy singing the song is really a guy who imitates McCartney's voice flawlessly, and I must say, he fooled me VERY easily, haha.  I could have sworn this was in fact a lost Paul McCartney song from the 70's.

Must of the storyline focuses on the two kids (one of which has a VERY dirty mouth- so viewer discretion is advised for this movie).  The other kid has an obsession with the dragon warrior-type, sword-swinging land of fairy tales, which plays a crucial part in an otherwise really ridiculous, nonsense storyline.  You'll see what I mean when you watch the ending.

Somehow though, I laughed several times despite the immature nature of the storyline, in addition to the immature characters portrayed by Seann William Scott and Paul Rudd.  One scene that caught my interest was when the two of them broke out into a fight on an elevator with a mother and her child stuck inside the elevator with no choice but to deal with the two of them fighting, haha.

Several jokes cracked me up.  I'm a little surprised the youngest boy with his bad boy attitude and the kid obsessed with swords didn't ever get involved in a fight.  The two of them seemed to keep their distance from each other for the most part.  They definitely couldn't have become friends though- that was obvious.

Yeah, Role Models definitely falls under the category of immature, but the humor and storyline work for the most part.",1264204800,,2306,4.510843373493976
3674977,4,B001KZH2I2,"Role Models (David Wain, 2008)

I originally had no interest in Role Models. The whole adult-comedy thing has taken a turn for the terminally stupid in the past few years, spearheaded by the braindead comedies of Judd Apatow, and I kind of turned away from the entire genre for a while. Then I saw The Hangover, and was blown away. Soon after, I remembered that some critics I respect had tabbed Role Models as one of 2008's best movies, so I checked it out. I liked it a whole lot more than I expected to, though I think it may have resonated more with my inner D&D player than with the part of me that was so wowed by The Hangover.

Plot: Danny (Apatow alumnus Paul Rudd) and Wheeler (Seann William Scott of the seemingly-neverending American Pie series) are energy drink reps. To Wheeler, it's a job he was born to do. Danny, however, wants something more out of life. This existing tension between them is exacerbated when Danny's girlfriend Beth (The Uninvited's Elizabeth Banks) breaks up with him. Through a complicated, and silly, series of events, the two of them end up arrested for wrecking the bull-mobile they drive to promote energy drinks and end up sentenced to one hundred fifty hours of community service apiece, which they are supposed to fulfill in the world's worst Big Brother program. Wheeler is assigned Ronnie (That's So Raven's Bobb'e J. Thompson), a foulmouthed delinquent who may be the best kid on a screen since Tanner in the original Bad News Bears, while Danny finds himself paired with Augie (Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse), an uber-goober who lives for LARPing. Needless to say, Augie and Ronnie don't get along too well, and neither kid is fond of Wheeler and Danny, but eventually things start going well. Until, of course, Danny (with the best of intentions) and Wheeler (in his usual self-absorbed way) find ways to screw things up, and need to reconcile themselves both with the kids they've come to love and with the insane head of the Big Brother program (Glee's Jane Lynch).

I expected it to be funny, and I expected it to go for the heartstrings (what was the last American comedy that didn't, or that didn't at least attempt to). What I didn't expect was Bobb'e J. Thompson, who absolutely steals this movie. I made the comparison to The Bad News Bears' Tanner Boyle before, and there's a lot of Tanner's politically incorrect attacks on anything and everything here (though Wain isn't willing to go quite as far as Michael Ritchie did thirty-odd years ago). Thompson obviously has fun with the role, and it slots well into what Wain is trying to do with this picture. I also didn't expect Wain to get nearly as far into LARPing as he did; this movie is the flipside of the IFC documentary Darkon (or its much lower-budget, yet infinitely superior, cousin Uber Goober), not playing the LARP community straight at all but getting just as many laughs out of it while portraying it in just as dysfunctional, but far more positive (in my opinion, of course), a light. Serious amounts of fun to be had with this one. *** ",1263600000,,3067,4.705772811918063

Donahue's ongoing arrogance and apathetic attitude start to wear on his relationship with girlfriend/attorney Beth Jones (Elizabeth Banks) while Wheeler's a Kiss-obsessed playboy whom no one can really take seriously.  Well, after a mishap involving their Minotaur truck and the local law enforcement at one of the schools they visited, the two are court ordered to act as the ""big brothers"" to two children who lack a ""father figure"" in their life.  Donahue's assigned to care for the extremely introverted and fantasy-oriented Augie Farks (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) while Wheeler must look after the foul-mouthed Ronnie Shields (Bobb'e J.

Now, this film wasn't so much outwardly funny as much as it had consistent humor from start to finish.  There was an amazing pedigree of talent that stems from two main players:  The State (David Wain wrote, directed, and acted in the film while Kerri Kenney-Silver, Joe Lo Truglio, and Ken Marino all had acting roles in the film) and Judd Apatow (Paul Rudd, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Elizabeth Banks, Ken Jeong, and Jane Lynch have all been in Apatow films).

I don't need to recap the plot, such as it is; two aging losers have to do community service, and end up being ""big brothers"" to two younger boys who need them.  Because each pair is very different from one another, comedy ensues!  ""Role Models"" did two things that comedies don't do as much as I'd like - it surprised me, and it made me laugh.  That's five stars right there.  While certain aspects of the movie were predictable, it didn't go for each and every cliche that a less-well-written movie would have.  The fact that LARPing saves the day, and that I actually rooted for young Mintz-Plasse to be the best LARPer of them all, is a testimony to the skill with which this film was made.  The actors are great; Jane Lynch is always fantastic, and our four main characters are well-cast and really know how to deliver comedy.

I expected a serviceable comedy that would be OK; what I got was a very funny and entertaining movie.  As an extra bonus, at slightly longer than 90 minutes, ""Role Models"" doesn't overstay its welcome.

The common thread among the one-star reviews before me seems to be that those reviewers find the movie offensive in language and therefore unfunny.  Fair enough; if you're one of those people, it's best to give this a pass.  For the rest of us, ""Role Models"" is at least worth a rent.",1254182400,,1487,4.548872180451128

We've got actors from the apatow circle and we have others that have hovered around this latest comedy scene and made quite an impression.

Recently we're seeing comedy with funnier improv than script.  Superbad was a great example.  Role Models follows with a little less improv but still a fair amount of laughs are generated.  The movie survives because of actors like Paul Rudd, Jane Lynch, Ken Jeong, Ken Marino, A.D. Miles, Joe Lo Truglio, and Matt Walsh.  The movie is enriched and made funny by these people, otherwise it wouldn't last.  The other actors in the film Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Sean William Scott, and Bobbe'j are great additions to the mix of your standard Improv-ers.  The give the film a little more reality with the mixed perspectives of comedy.  With too much improv and satire you'll forget what the film is about.  All and all the film turns out to be a great buddy buddy comedy about our relationships with younger people.  I think it has a lot to offer, however don't expect to be viewing Apatow's next film here.

The special features are actually very good for a Universal movie.  The U-control is less tiresome and the extras are consistenly funny.  I was satisfied with my blu-ray version.  I reccomend viewing them even if you don't normally cruise the special features.  These filmmakers are making special feature specific comedy for us and a lot of people are missing out on great fun.

Role Models doesn't have much to offer besides simple laughs.  However they are good laughs, and they may be some of your favorite jokes.  Rent it/Buy it pop it in and don't expect an awakening.

3675012,4,B001KZH2I2,"Like its two lead characters, ROLE MODELS is a movie that doesn't seem to be expecting too much of itself as it lures us into familiar man-child territory.

Seann William Scott and (co-writer) Paul Rudd are Wheeler and Danny, two low-achieving coworkers paid to travel to schools with an act that preaches against drugs while pushing powerful energy-drinks as the safe alternative.  The difference between them?  Wheeler loves his work and thinks of Danny as his friend.  Danny hates his job, the fact that he should have done more with his life and can't commit to being more than a colleague to Wheeler.  Danny's mean, sarcastic and rude to coffee shop baristas.  Clearly he doesn't deserve a girlfriend like Beth (Elizabeth Banks), who rejects his spontaneous marriage proposal and dumps him instead.  Danny's dejection leads to a tangle with the law and soon he and Wheeler are sent to perform 150 hours of community service at the local mentoring program, Sturdy Wings.

This is where the movie grows some wings of its own and really takes off.  The flight path may be familiar, and there are no surprises when it comes to a predictably happy landing.  But the journey becomes a lot of fun when Wheeler and Danny become ""Bigs"" to two very different ""Littles,"" Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson) and Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse).

It's clear that on paper at least, our two ROLE MODELS lack all the traditional skills required to teach anything to the kids.  Fast-talking, foul-mouthed Ronnie is the product of broken home in need of a father figure, not a ""booby"" obsessed party lover like Wheeler.  The costume-sewing fantasy game participant Augie shouldn't expect much sympathy from the snide Danny.  Bad mentoring leads to chaos, confusion and near-tragedy.  But somehow, everyone develops the sturdiness of wing to make it to the end having taught something to someone else--and discovered something essential about themselves.

Supporting characters add to the fun throughout, especially Jane Lynch as the ex-coke-addict who founded the Sturdy Wings program and the various costumed characters who take the game of ""Laire"" very seriously indeed.

It's not the sort of comedy I expect to see someone like Paul Rudd doing, which is in part why it comes off as more grown up humor than I generally attribute to Seann William Scott.  Jane Lynch characteristically brings the tone up as the overbearing caregiver, though neither she nor Scott are stretching their acting or comedic boundaries.  They are basically playing the same shtick they always do--neuromaniac and goofy hornball.  That aside, the whole cast is great and its chemistry conveys well, particularly between the Littles and their Bigs.  The pitch is still mostly gutter humor, not for the whole family, but it's in keeping with Judd Apatow's smart comedic style.

The standards have truly been raised/lowered (depending on your opinion) by over-the-top folks like Sasha Baron Cohen and Will Ferrel. The genre has also received some maturity by those Kings of the latter 00's Comedies, Apatow and Co. They gave and continue to give comedies the over the top laughs a la Kevin Smith but with their own true heart that isn't the usual contrivance of most 90's comedies. Role Models is a warm film but is more likely to be a minor classic than anything. It has all the bare breasts, raunchy humor and drug use but it really delves into what it takes to be a role model to someone and the flaws in common mentoring. Jane Lynch's character is fantastic. Her deadpan comedy caught my attention in the 40 Year-Old Virgin (that song she suddenly sang in Spanish made me literally spit out my drink) and she is rather well showcased in this film. The only make or break point is... How much you really buy the whole LAIRE (Kind of a live action RPG for nerds) thing. If participation by the whole cast makes you giggle then this is the best comedy you've ever seen. If it makes you sad to see grown men wear medieval costume and play make believe, then the third act is really going to annoy you, although the denouement is done quite well. The two kids in need of mentoring aren't just two hyperboles of troubled youth. We all went to school with kids like them and this adds to the heart of the film.

The plot is of 2 coworkers, who sell a power drink to schools in an anti-drug program, who get into legal trouble and have to serve time in a volunteer youth program in lieu of going to jail.  Paul Rudd plays the straight man to Seann William Scott's goofy, bad boy and the two youth actors are perfect accompaniments to the adults.  The story is silly but a lot of fun.

Jane Lynch is particluarly hilarious in her role as the director of the youth program and Elizabeth Banks does well in her minimal role as the attorney\ex-girlfriend of Paul Rudd.  As a side note, if you are a KISS fan, you will enjoy many parts of this movie.

Having just seen ""Superbad"" and ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" (both outstanding), I was psyched for more is this seemingly good streak of movies, esp since it got relatively good reviews and took in almost $70,000,000 at the box office.

Maybe I watched a different movie, but this movie seemed like a 2nd rate version of ""Dude Where's My Car"" with pretty mean spirited characters who magically turn into unbelievable human beings once it's time to wrap it up. The great Paul Rudd (who also helped pen the script) has rarely been less funny and the jokes felt derivative with a much greater degree of homophobia and mysogeny than most of the flicks these guys usually make. Nothing against any type of humor, but at least be funny about it.

Sean William Scott is playing exactly the same character that he played in ""Dude"" and even the generally spectacular Jane Lynch is given a flat role in which she only has one funny running gag about a hot dog.

I can't recommend this movie unless you've seen every other movie made by any one having 6 degrees of separation from Apatow and loved them all; otherwise stick to the better ones that his troops have taken on.",1245542400,3,1369,4.817021276595745
3675021,3,B001KZH2I2,"It happened quietly, but I couldn't be more pleased: Paul Rudd is a movie star. He's been a stellar talk show guest for years, whether charming David Letterman or dancing with Jon Stewart. He's had a major role in a string of terrific movies, dating back to Clueless all the way to Knocked Up. And now suddenly, he's the man: the lead in successful comedies like Role Models (Universal; $29.98), a typical goof with Rudd and Sean William Scott as power drink pushers who have to do community service that was a strong box office hit; and I Love You, Man (opening Friday) with Rudd as a sad sack guy trying to find a male friend so he can have a Best Man at his wedding. Throw in voice-over work on the blockbuster-looking animated flick Monsters Vs. Aliens (opening March 27), and a clutch of upcoming projects like a caveman comedy with Jack Black and a James L. Brooks project and Rudd is on top of the world. In fact, he's appeared in movies that have grossed just about $1 billion in the US alone and $1.6 billion worldwide.

He's been charming ever since that breakout role in Clueless (hey, if he were your (step) brother, wouldn't you make out with him too?), including notable TV stints on Friends and Reno 911, as well as cult faves like Wet Hot American Summer and the solid hit but still under-appreciated Anchorman.

Frankly, I'm besotted with the guy, who turns 40 on April 6 but still looks almost the same as he did in Clueless 14 years ago. (Do he and Dick Clark have the same deal with the devil?) He's shown greater range on stage, but in movies Rudd has been mostly limited to comedies, which clearly he has a flair for. Still, it would be nice to see if he could have the range of a Cary Grant and sink his teeth into at least romantic dramas if not even weightier fare instead of just wise-cracking comedies. Clearly, Paul Rudd has the talent and the fan base. All he needs is some smart director to realize how much bigger a star Rudd could be.

3675023,5,B001KZH2I2,"After seeing `I Love You, Man' (I really need to review that) I came to realize that Paul Rudd is brilliant.  He has this stellar way of making his humor so lovable and totally believable.  You can see yourself in him and you want to be his friend.  Even when he's being a sarcastic, stuck-up, pompous moron you can't help but want to reach over and pinch his cheeks.  He just wears `everyman' so well, and it bleeds effortlessly into his acting (I mean, seriously, I'm thinking he needs an Oscar nomination for her performance in `I Love You, Man').

So, with all of this in mind, I had to see `Role Models', a film that I was marginally interested in before I saw `I Love You, Man' (it's funny how a singular cinematic experience can change your views on a lot of things).

What I expected to find was your typical raunchy buddy comedy with the occasional clichd moments of forced emotional warmth.  What I got was a hilarious non-stop comedy with the right amounts heart and the right amounts offensive (yes, it is offensive) to make this a memorable and rewarding time at the movies.  I laughed throughout its entirety and I actually felt the human connection as the film delved into the warmer aspects of the plot, as I knew it would.  What makes this film so different from your typical comedy is that, while it has some of the same clichd elements as every other comedy out there, it goes about them in a refreshing manner (much like `I Love You, Man'); so instead of a boy breaking up with a girl only to get back together (or in this case a `big' breaking up with his `little') they have elements surrounding these `break ups' that make the whole premise feel somewhat new and exciting.

The premise is that two men get in trouble for defacing public property and are sentenced to community service at a center for kids who need some adult guidance.  Wheeler is the laid back party guy who would rather spend countless hours with obnoxious children then find himself prey to countless men in prison (he is a pretty boy).  Danny on the other hand hates his life and hates pretty much everyone around him and so he just wants to go to prison.  Wheeler gets himself set up with Ronnie, the foul mouthed little boy living in a single parent family, while Danny gets set up with Augie, the strange kid living in a fantasy world alienated from his mother and step-father.  The two men have a lot to learn about life, but surprisingly they actually teach these two young kids a thing or two as well (and not just how to check out a girls rack without getting caught).

I am not usually a fan of Seann William Scott (I find him a tad over the top for my taste) but here his wit is so sharp (and the pairing of him with Rudd was genius, since they play so well off one another) that I was instantly a fan.  Rudd is by far the more controlled and more endearing of the two, especially since his character has the biggest arc.  He actually transforms into a real man by the films end, which is wholly believable and actually quite charming in the end.  Christopher Mintz-Plasse (McLovin') and Bobb'e J. Thompson are both pitch perfect in their respective roles and the rest of the supporting cast (especially the hilarious Jane Lynch) are delightful and really help carry the film.

Yes, `Role Models' is not (and I repeat, NOT) a film for children despite the fact that it stars two of them (how old is that Thompson kid anyways, I mean, he never seems to age).  It is littered with foul language and suggestive material and the characters have horrible attitudes for a good portion of the film and they even teach the kids some very questionable things, but the film has so much heart to go along with the offensive that it makes it a joy for any adult to watch and serves as some very, very funny adult entertainment.",1245110400,4,3818,4.434907010014306

There are so many things that are so wrong about this movie but the worst aspect of ROLE MODELS is that it is NOT funny.

I don't know who Paul Rudd is, but he has zero screen presence.  I sat through his abysmal movie THE TEN and could not for the life of me understand what kind of person would laugh at that.  In ROLE MODELS, he plays a selfish jerk with no redeeming qualities.  He's not funny.  His acting is flat.  His character goes nowhere.  You never believe for a second that a severely-wasted Elizabeth Banks could ever care about a lout like him.

My friend turned me about halfway through and asked, ""Do you think the studio people screened this and thought they had a winner here?""
To the people who made this movie, it's all about formulas and the deal.  Get Stiffler from AMERICAN PIE and McLovin from SUPERBAD and you can't miss...no matter how awful the final product is.

I hated SUPERBAD, which had absolutely zero laughs in it.  Although ROLE MODELS did manage to have a couple of weak chuckles, it had so many dead air misfires that it was more embarrassing than SUPERBAD.

Another lame, horrible ""comedy"" by someone (Paul Rudd) whose talent has been exhausted (like Seth Rogan) and yet they keep making movie after movie.  That's Hollywood.  Hooray....",1244160000,11,1400,4.544

3675028,4,B001KZH2I2,"In this new ""golden era"" of R-rated comedies (KNOCKED UP, 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN, SUPER BAD, etc.)...there are a few ""MVP"" actors who have made a real impact on a broad swath of these films. Seth Rogan is certainly the name that first leaps to mind, if only for sheer number of appearances. But my personal favorite is Paul Rudd (to my mind, he's the best thing in KNOCKED UP...a very good film). He's a handsome actor with mischief and intelligence in equal measure twinkling in his eyes. He's one of the actors who plays a character who actually says funny things because his character would say something funny, rather than just because the script demanded it. He seldom pushes himself physically, but verbally he's capable of the most subtle work imaginable.

His appearance along in ROLE MODELS made me want to see the film. He's not had a truly starring role before, and since he also co-wrote the script...I knew this was a must see.

But I must also admit that Seann William Scott (Stifler in the AMERICAN PIE films...the series that bridged the gab from PORKY's era R-rated comedy to today's current ilk) was also a draw for me. He's capable of the most explicit raunch, but also doesn't seem to have a single malicious bone in his body. There is something infectious about his ""let's party"" attitude that makes you believe that this actor is genuinely enjoying what he's doing and would, in fact, be the life of any party. The prospect of these two together was just too much to resist.

BUT THEN I realized that Jane Lynch, that most spectacular of under-rated film comediennes (VIRGIN, A MIGHTY WIND, BEST IN SHOW) was also featured. She's difficult to describe, frankly. A tall presence, her characters often teeter on the line between being the smartest person in the room and the most insane.

ROLE MODELS tells the story of two guys (Rudd & Scott) who work selling a Red Bull like concoction called Minotaur to high-school kids. They drive their tricked out Minotaur truck to schools and Scott, dressed as a minotaur, hands out free samples and makes minotaur noises. Rudd, dressed in a suit, gives whimpy anti-drug speeches (""Don't do drugs...drink Minotaur""). Scott LOVES his job...Rudd hates his job and hates himself for being stuck in it for a decade. Scott thinks he and Rudd a great friends. Rudd considers Scott a barely tolerable co-worker. One day, after Rudd's girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks) breaks up with him, Rudd finally looses his cool and causes a rather spectacular accident with the Minotaur-truck.

Rather than be sent to jail, the two are sentenced to 180 hours each of community service work at ""Sturdy Wings"", a kind of Big Brother organization run by Lynch. Scott is assigned to Ronnie, a young, black and EXTREMELY foul-mouthed eleven year old (I'm guessing at the age) who has never had a Big Brother who lasted more than a day. Rudd gets Augie, a 16 year old (Christopher Mintz-Platz...McLovin from SUPERBAD)...a kid who lives to play in a one of those groups where everyone dresses up likes knights and kings and bashes each other Styrofoam swords.

You can pretty much guess where this movie is headed about 20 minutes into it. These reluctant father figures will learn to appreciate their kids, learn lessons about life, themselves and each other. The kids will feel better about themselves. Everyone will be happy.

It's the journey getting to this point that is so much fun. There are some very clever ideas...many of them centered around the rock band KISS. The film also manages to milk a lot of humor out of the whole knights & ladies scenario...many of them more insightful than you would expect.

But what truly makes the film successful are the performances from the folks you expected to see deliver. Paul Rudd is, flat-out, hilariously dry. Early on, he launches into a venomous tirade against a barista...all about how their coffee is tall, grande and venti. It's full of gall...and it's totally relatable to anyone who's ever been frustrated at the way a store conducts its business. But when he begins to melt, he never strays from the truth of his character. He doesn't lose that cynical sense of humor...just the self-loathing behind it. And Scott is nearly a revelation. His character isn't quite as raunchy as Stifler, and he develops a rather touching relationship with his young charge...one which he takes very convincingly seriously. Although it isn't exactly high praise, I would say this may be Scott's best-rounded, most ""human"" performance. He's been given a script that actually asks him to act and not just be a clown. And he delivers.

Jane Lynch steals all her scenes. When she decides she's angry at Rudd and Scott, her diatribes against them are a joy to behold. On the surface, they seem reasonable...but they actually make virtually no sense. Lynch plays them with the straightest of all possible straight faces...to hilarious effect.

The young boys Bobb'e Thompson and Mintz-Platz are quite up to sharing the screen with their older, more experienced co-stars. Thompson in particular manages to be touching without ever once abandoning his basic assignment as the smart-*ss.

I only dock the film points for a rather tepid performance from Elizabeth Banks (in an underwritten role) and for its core of unoriginality. As I said, the journey is fun...but where it leads is unmistakably familiar ground...trod by about a million movies ahead of it.

3675042,4,B001KZH2I2,"Role Models falls into the ""funny and raunchy but has a heart"" category of comedy.  It is a pretty popular format these days but one I've not tired of yet.

There is something about the characters in these flicks - you want to live vicariously through them in some respects and get away with doing some of the things they do.  Who wouldn't want to come back at some bratty insulting kid the way Wheeler (Sean William Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd - who plays some of the best socially awkward characters ever) did at the beginning of the movie.  I was sold at that point.  Or just go nuts on the officer and tow truck driver as they try to take your vehicle - which action, spurred on by some relationship issues, does admittedly land our characters in a spot of trouble.

Our energy drink selling duo end up doing community service as ""bigs"" to a couple of kids.  Ronnie, a foul mouthed and violent (and boob loving) little guy and Augie a live action role playing (LARP'ing), cape wearing misfit.  The formula will be familiar to you from the troubled beginning through to the eventual friendships at the end but it's the journey that takes you there that is the fun part.

Great bits of dialog and funny characters are peppered throughout the film.  There's the director of the Big Brothers type organization who really doesn't like BS but does like hot dogs quite a bit, Ronnie's mom who is very animalistic, Augie's parents who aren't so great but do some growing of their own, the LARP'ing king who loves the Burger Hole, the annoying guy who volunteers to work with the kids over and over again and of course Beth (Elizabeth Banks) as Danny's romantic foil.  There are plenty of little moments among these individuals so that you'll be constantly entertained.

The role playing actually plays a big part in the film and is critical to the climax as a matter of fact.  Whether you are a LARPer or not you'll probably find these scenes funny, albeit for differing reasons.  The movie pokes fun at LARPing without putting it down or making fun of it for which I commend it.  And if you've ever wanted to see KISS LARPing... well this is the place.

In the end some lessons are learned, some friendships and relationships made and you've had some laughs and may even end up with a warm and fuzzy feeling.  I suppose you can't ask more than that from a light hearted and fun comedy.",1242172800,,2382,4.502325581395349

3675052,4,B001KZH2I2,"Paul Rudd can carry anything; this is one of the Ten Commandments of contemporary comedy (I'm not sure what the other nine are; ask Rudd).  In any other hands, ""Role Models"" would fail--it would be a raunch buddy-comedy with some kids thrown into the mix.  As is, ""Role Models"" is the oddly touching tale of Wheeler and Danny, the former of whom is a party animal, the latter too cynical for his own good.  One bad day, Danny proposes to his girlfriend (the ever-charming Elizabeth Banks), and she turns him down.  Danny gets drunk, and crashes a truck that looks like a minotaur into a statue of a horse.  His punishment: He and Wheeler are forced to work at Happy Wings, a sort of Big Brothers/Big Sisters organization.  Danny is paired with a role-playing outcast; Wheeler with a foul-mouthed victim of a single-parent household.  Together, these four very different individuals will form a unique, lasting bond that explores the depths of male relationships.

""Role Models"" could easily have sank under the weight of its own good intentions.  Instead, with Rudd added as star and writer, it soars.  To the film's credit, there's talent elsewhere as well. Sean William Scott isn't anywhere near as annoying as he is in every other movie he's starred in; in fact, he's downright relateable at times, and absolutely hilarious.  Christopher Mintz-Plasse (he of McLovin' fame) and Bobb'e J. Thompson are talented beyond their ages, and more than hold their own with the film's stars.  Ken Marino and the afore-mentioned Banks are the standouts of the supporting cast, though the true scene-stealer is Jane Lynch as the psychotic director of Happy Wings.

Overall, ""Role Models"" is an engaging comedy with some genuine depth to it.  Sure, there's a lot of crudity; but beneath it all is a true heart, and the film features some genuinely touching/funny moments.  All-in-all, it's a buddy comedy that exceeds the expectations of its genre, and manages to stand on its own as one of the year's funnier films.",1238889600,,2004,4.905044510385757
3675053,5,B001KZH2I2,"I expected to like this movie because it looked like a fun comedy and I think Paul Rudd is a funny actor, but I didn't expect to laugh as hard as I did throughout viewing this. There is a great assortment of characters in this movie from the leads (Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott) to the kids they mentor to the hilarious characters that engage in fantasy role playing battles to my personal favorite - the woman who runs Sturdy Wings, the organization that Paul & Seann must volunteer at.

Sometimes I watch a movie that is supposed to be a comedy and I feel like every 10 minutes there is a joke. This movie felt jam-packed with jokes and it even had a bit of a feel-good message at the end. My one disappointment is that I didn't think the character played by Elizabeth Banks (love her as an actress) was developed enough. Some of her best stuff ended up in the deleted scenes, and it would have been nice to see more of her comedic chops in the actual movie.",1238457600,,965,4.273224043715847
3675054,4,B001KZH2I2,"Paul Rudd and Sean William Scott make a great team in this feel good comedy.  Its a bit raunchy, but that doesn't bother me.  Its hysterical, especially the battle at the end and the new country.  I think what makes it so funny is how ridiculous it is.  Overall, my husband and I love this movie.",1238025600,,296,4.232142857142857
3675055,4,B001KZH2I2,"I never know what to expect from Seann William Scott films. Recently he has had a few weaker roles.  Not expecting much from this film, it turned out to be really funny and not as perverted as expected. It wasn't just a sexually perverted movie, but a decent story about 2 guys that have a bad day that end up in the end becoming better people themselves as well as being an example for others.  Funny, some good one liners, worth a chuckle on a weeknight.  Check it out.",1237939200,,471,4.269662921348314
3675056,5,B001KZH2I2,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. When I first saw the trailer I thought it looked interesting, but apparently no one else did. After seeing the positive reviews and hearing from friends that it actually was a very funny movie, I decided to pick it up on BRD (my first BRD btw). While the story isn't particularly original and a bit predictable, it walks the line between having a heart and over-the-top-and-frequently-crude humor perhaps better than any movie since the original American Pie (the fact that Sean William Scott is in this movie is just coincidence). And this is a comedy after all; people are expecting feel good laughs--not crazy plot twists.

I think most people know about the main characters, who do an excellent job, as well as the plotline, so it's worth mentioning that the auxilary characters are hilarious, especially Jane Lynch. Her friendly and well-meaning but borderline-psychotic demeanor is hysterical. I also enjoyed the overzealous dweeb who's volunteered for over 5 years for Sturdy Wings (the ""Big Brothers"" type of organization Lynch runs), and the ""King"" and his minions in the fictitious role-playing game that Augie (McLovin') takes part in. Almost all the characters add a little something to the movie, which is great.

As for the added content, the deleted scenes are, as expected, hilarious. Blu-Ray exclusives include things like Blu-Ray Live, which connects you to the internet for some exclusive content, and the ability to cut out certain scenes. I haven't gotten too much into it, but it adds some longevity to the entertainment of the product if that's your thing.

Anyway, if you thought the previews were ho-hum, don't let that fool you. This movie was perhaps one of the biggest surprises of the year, with a light hearted but solid story and, most importantly, huge laughs.",1237939200,,1825,5.0364238410596025
3675057,1,B001KZH2I2,"Ok, so I can take raunchy humor- Wedding Crashers is one of my favorite comedies ever.

Paul Rudd and Sean William Scott have really decent chemistry- and this film follows a pretty usual format... they keep it going with shallow humor, etc- and i laughed a bunch of times-

HERE IS MY ISSUE: the explicit language that was written for/subject to the 10 year old boy. Now, i get it if kids say something off color, or are sometimes put into a seemingly compromising situation on camera for the effect of the film, however, what innocence that kid possessed was completely compromised by the script.
The values put across in this movie are just dirty, which i can deal with in one sense, but NOT when it comes to children.

IT IS NOT FUNNY BECAUSE A KID SAID IT, THE KID AS A HUMAN HAS NOW HAD HIS VALUES COMPROMISED.

child actors are children first, the acting is an offshoot of that- they are quite impressionable, and doing this to him is an absolute violation of his human rights where he should not be subject or made to say overtly sexually charged statements prior to adulthood/development.

What elevates ""Role Models"" and other good ones like 40 Year Old Virgin, Superbad, Pineapple Express is a great script, memorable and believable characters and a point...and a moral...to the story. Maybe because I have sons, I just hugely enjoy these smart and sensitive guy comedies from the ""frat pack,"" the whole Judd Apatow crew. NICE JOB PAUL RUDD, who stars and wrote this. I have loved you since Clueless.",1237680000,,518,4.8977272727272725
3675059,4,B001KZH2I2,I picked this movie up last week after seeing the blu-ray previews on TV. It started and ended w/ hilarious lines. The middle of the film was no slouch either. Seann William Scott and Paul Rudd prove to be a formidable comedy duo.,1237420800,,230,4.372093023255814
3675060,3,B001KZH2I2,"Role Models is not a particularly deep or innovative comedy, in fact it's plotline will be familiar to anyone who has ever watched a movie, period.  But that doesn't mean that it doesn't provide lots of laughs and much needed escapism for it's 90 plus minutes.

Paul Rudd And Sean William Scott star as two slackers who find themselves sentenced to 30 days of community service following a work related blow up by Rudd's characther that comes on the heels of being dumped by his longtime girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks).  The two are ordered to do their hours of community service at a Big Brothers and Sisters type of organization where each of them are paired up with a ""troubled"" kid.

Can you guess where this is going?  The two men will learn to look past their own self indulgence and care for the kids.  A valuable lesson is learned by all.  This plot really doesn't matter.  What does matter are the performances.  Rudd and Scott are hilarious as the overgrown man-children and they share an effortless chemistry.  Rudd especially is in top form, spewing sarcasm and self loathing with every line and garnering laughs from his facial expressions alone.  Rudd is clearly in his element here.

When Rudd turns into an unselfish nice guy at the end, it's a bit of a stretch for the audience to accept that he made such a quick transition.  Rudd's performance may be hilarious, but his character is not that well developed for his transformation to be believable.  But hey, this ain't art.  It's a largely entertaining buddy comedy with lots of smart and raunchy humor that should be viewed as exactly that.",1237334400,35,1608,4.71326164874552
3675061,2,B001KZH2I2,"This had a few more funny moments than I expected.  Not enough to make this a worthwhile movie, but gave me a few laughs.  The whole medieval dress up portion of the movie went on way too long.  It became boring and uninteresting.  I do have to say it is a little disturbing that parents will let their actor kids (little black kid) say and do things in movies that are completely inappropriate.

Don't but this one, but almost worth renting.",1237248000,7,442,4.407407407407407

3675063,4,B001KZH2I2,"Thought I was getting the usual, unreflective guy comedy. Instead, I got a surprisingly smart, sweet movie with a healthy sense of irony. Pleasant surprise.

Paul Rudd has elevated snark (and snark-repentant) into an art form, and if you like that, this is a fun movie to watch. Plus, he ends up in KISS makeup and Ren-fair attire at the end--so surreal, you've just *got* to see it.

Sure, there are moments of stupid guy comedy, but gals, Seann William Scott gets nekked and Paul Rudd is easy on the eyes.  This almost makes up for the momentary but gratuitous silicone shots. Also, the ladies the hold their own. Elizabeth Banks gets in some good, funny lines in and Judy Lynch has a brilliant knack for playing off-kilter characters.

And yeah, the kids do all right. Let's put it this way: I hate kids, and this movie was still funny, so the two underage actors must have been doing something right.

All in all, I found this movie well worth watching. Look, if you don't like guy comedy (and you know who you are) don't watch it. But if you can get over the occasional fart/boob/etc. jokes,  there's a lot to enjoy, and the movie is smarter and sweeter than you might expect.",1236988800,,1181,4.52112676056338
3675064,2,B001KZH2I2,"This movie could have been great. It had the right cast . . . but, for the most part, the plot sank and dragged on. Of the film, I'd say about 15% of it is somewhat funny.  The rest of the time, it is just plain dull to watch. Danny (Paul Rudd), one of the adult characters, is going through a mid-life crisis.  Wheeler (Seann William Scott), better known and remembered for his role as Stiffler in American Pie, is a happy-go-lucky guy who works with Danny and is his friend.  Danny erupts because he is unhappy with life and ends up doing something that causes both Danny and Wheeler to be sentenced to community service with kids (as if it sounds like a good idea to put mild criminals with kids!).  In any event, the two get paired up with equally screwed up kids.  Danny's kid is a dork who enjoys the role-playing ""dungeons and dragons"" type of thing. Stiffler is assigned a foul-mouthed black kid who, like Stiffler, has an interest in boobs, getting laid, etc.

The film has a few good laughs sprinkled into the mix.  But, in large part, you have to plow through a lot of boring plot to get them.  Stiffler is the primary source of the comedy.  But, even his generally funny demeanor and role does not save this POS.  Like American Pie, the jokes involve him trying to score with ladies and getting laid a couple times.  Not much to work with here and not really all that funny.  It doesn't come close to the more edgy (and funny) comedies like American Pie, Road Trip, Sex Drive, Wedding Crashers, the Heartbreak Kid, etc.  If you are an adolescent boy that wants a quick flash of some topless women, this film might be good for that.  But, I think it'd be cheaper, quicker, and less painful to simply shell out the money to buy a playboy.

The worst part of this ""film"" is the extended footage of the live action role playing (LARPing or LEATing or whatever its called). This dragged on for what seemed like an eternity. It could have really poked fun at these people or had some other good comedic elements. But, in the end, it was really, really weak because it just showed these guys fighting and acting stupid.  However, the inclusion of these scenes might be a reason why the DVD will sell as there appears to be a cult following for this crap.

Overall, save your money and look for another comedy. This one will not make you laugh.  Indeed, if you purchase the DVD, it will make you question why you wasted $18.",1236988800,5,2428,4.3937360178970915
3675065,5,B001KZH2I2,"I expected this to be ""sexual funny"" with Seann William Scott but Paul Rudd added something a little extra to the mix.  Although he never had a bad role, Rudd shined in his first major leading role.  All of the movie, start to finish, was non stop laughs.  McLovin' did a great job as a super geek taking part in LARP, or LAIRE in this movie.  I have never heard of that before (i have a girlfriend) but it seems funny enough for a movie.  The little black kid was my favorite in the movie.  I can see my kid being like him.  It's hilarious.  See this movie, buy it if you want.  I'd highly recommend it.",1236816000,,604,4.094017094017094

When Danny is having the worst day of his life, he trashes a company truck. Him and Wheeler either go to jail or spend 150 hours doing community service and working with kids. Danny gets Augie Farks, a nerdy kid obsessed with 14th century stuff. Wheeler gets Ronnie, a bad-mouthed little black kid. When they really screw things up with the kids, they forget going to court, and help Augie in a fake 14th century battle.

I can't speak for the quality of the Blu-Ray, the special features, or the extra unrated footage yet, but as long as this is still the same film I loved back in November on the big screen, the extras can only serve to try and somehow bump my 5/5 stars to 6/5.",1236297600,3,648,3.946564885496183
