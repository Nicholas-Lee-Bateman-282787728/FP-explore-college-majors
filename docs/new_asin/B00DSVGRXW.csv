5853902,5,B00DSVGRXW,"The title of my review says enough. Definitely enjoyed the movie !  I enjoyed seeing Romeo is a different character role, mishon carried the movie very well.  The new face and surprise was Quentin aka richard john reliford.  Very strong acting performance and I hope to see him in other projects soon.",1386374400,,301,4.75
5853903,3,B00DSVGRXW,"This film was so not worth the 17 bucks that it cost. Anyway, this was more of a watered down version of ""Stomp the Yard"" only the brother doesn't die here. Mishon, Romeo Miller, and the great Darrin Henson attracted me to this, but even the talented eye candy couldn't save this shallow story. The movie was off to a strong start, but kept getting off track with unrelated topics. The love triangle story has already been done. If you're going to do a fraternity movie, give us something we haven't seen before. It just seemed kind of silly to me that a father would fall out with his son over a fraternity, also with the two brothers. A frat is a frat, tradition or not. I expected more. but it is still a pretty decent movie.",1383004800,6,728,4.321167883211679

8597343,3,B00DSVGRXW,"The movie brought back memories of my college days. I remember when the Alpha's and the ''Q""s, would step, right in front of the library at my university. The part that I love most about the movie, was how the brother's really loved each other, especially the actor who played Mishon's brother. The movie was a little ""campy"", and their steps were not always in ""sync"", but it was a movie for the whole family. The actor Mishon is really on his way, as he continues to grow as an actor, I look forward to see him in more things to come.",1410134400,,536,4.264705882352941

8597345,4,B00DSVGRXW,"I enjoyed Frat Brothers. This film focused on what college students have to go through in order to pledge with a college fraternity. There is also a nice love story in the film. The importance of family is also stressed in this film. The plot, acting and directing were well done. Romeo did a good job as the bad guy. This film would be rated PG or PG-13. No profanity, sex or nudity. This is a clean family film. Recommended for fans of Stomp the Yard and films about brotherhood.",1402099200,,481,4.355555555555555
