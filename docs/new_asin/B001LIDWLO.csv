8361867,5,B001LIDWLO,"I absolutely love the firm ball workout. Tina talks you through it really well and after a while you feel as if you're really working out with her. I own both the dvd and the sculpting ball but I had recently moved and left it in storage but I just had to have my sculpting ball workout so I ordered another dvd. That's why I call it my old standard. I have been working out with it for about 4 or 5 years and even now, I still feel the burn. You never get tired of it. Plus, it really works out your waste, getting rid of the love handles.",1402444800,4,540,3.918181818181818
8361868,5,B001LIDWLO,"I bought this DVD w/ the sculpting ball over a year ago, intending then to start regular exercise.

Which OBVIOUSLY didn't happen a year ago. Let me also add that I'm a 38 yr old female, have had 1 child, am 5,7 & 113lbs. I'm in no way overweight, but I wanted to tone & get in some cardio.

I started The Firm sculpting ball routine about a week ago, they say after 10 work outs you see a difference, which I believe, I've done 4 over 5 days & I feel better, my body overall does looks more lean but that might be wishful thinking.

The DVD is 32 minutes, with only 1-1&/2 minutes dedicated to the intro. The warm up is well paced & doesn't last FOREVER like some workout DVDs. After a 2-3 minute warm up, you're off & moving.

I like the instructor, Tina Smalley, she sets a nice pace & isn't annoying like a lot of video instructors. She recommends that you leave out the sculpting ball until you learn the routine, I didn't but I'd tell anyone in their late 40's & above that hasn't exercised in a while or anyone extremely out of shape to follow her advice. Leave the ball out until you know the routine. There's an instructor doing the routine sans ball & Tina always instructs well.

The sculpting ball is 5 lbs (decent weight) & easy to grip, though if you get very sweaty & you will take care to NOT lose your hold on the ball because the surface can get slippery. I kept a small sports towel nearby & had no problems. The biggest time for this concern is the abdominal work when holding the ball between your knees.

All in all you get a total body workout in 30 minutes, the ""cool down"" actually starts w/ the floor/ab work but your heart rate doesn't plummet, it stays elevated & slightly slows down safely. Then it's about 2 minutes of stretching not 5-10 which I hate in most DVDs. You start the DVD, jump right in & then end it quite the same. It's a great workout for people who don't have tons of time each day, like me. I have a 7 yr old & a 16 year old demon beast step daughter so my time is tight.

I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to add in a solid exercise routine. It fits nicely with my twice weekly 55 minute Yoga sessions.",1357862400,11,2153,4.1610576923076925
