3650349,5,B001IZNJ2C,"This DVD was excellant , well worth the price, it takes alot to scare me but this DVD is scary, excellant DVD to watch anytime, but especially on Halloween!",1259020800,2,156,4.413793103448276
3650350,4,B001IZNJ2C,"These are very good shows. The haunting in Georgia is based on a true haunting and it is very interesting. The haunting in Conneticut is based on truth also and is very good, and it leaves you with an eerie feeling as far as ghost documentaries go.",1240012800,3,248,4.297872340425532
3650351,4,B001IZNJ2C,"My family and I enjoyed this double documentary feature. Picture quality was just average but sound quality good and well directed. Even though these were just documentaries with visual recreations of real events, it gave my mom and sisters the shivers.

Hope to be able to order other episodes from this documentary series through amazon soon.",1339977600,2,344,5.142857142857143
3650352,5,B001IZNJ2C,"This is a must have for all ""A Haunting"" fans.  These are the original two documentaries that premiered on the DIscovery Channel which led to the series entitled ""A Haunting"" (which is available in a 39 episode set composed of Seasons 1-4).  You won't be sorry you bought it.  I have watched each episode at least a dozen times and I still find it entertaining.  You will definitely get your money's worth.  I was practiacally in tears when the series ended.  I guess they ran out of real-life hauntings.  We'll just have to wait until some more haunted homes become available.",1336003200,,577,4.653465346534653
3650353,3,B001IZNJ2C,"At least it was low cost. Kind of OK, but certainly not great or scary. I appeared to be a documentary, but after a while it became boring",1323561600,,138,3.9642857142857144
3650354,5,B001IZNJ2C,"I am a big fan of the ""Haunting"" movies, and these are the best, in my opinion. Good deal to buy the double feature and get 2 great movies. Great for Halloween, too!!",1319068800,,166,4.0606060606060606
3650355,5,B001IZNJ2C,"These two shows are the most interesting and most convincing of the entire Haunting series. While A Haunting In Connecticut is at times frightening, A Haunting In Georgia is much less so and its conclusion, that sensitivity to supernatural entities is probably inherited, is quite convincing.",1313625600,,292,5.369565217391305
3650356,5,B001IZNJ2C,"These are fascinating true stories. The people are really good at acting out the parts of themselves. It's quite amazing. The stories are chilling and much more believable than the gory movies that are made for release.  When you think about it - if this stuff happened to you it really would be terrifying!
I really enjoyed The Haunting in Georgia the best. It's excellently acted by everyone.  I really felt sorry for what the family went through. Being sensitive to the spirit world is obviously not fun!
 Some of the other shows in the series were a little harder to swallow but mostly they were very good shows.",1306540800,5,616,4.63302752293578
3650357,5,B001IZNJ2C,I like the history.  Sometimes it is fascinating to see that in our short history (compared to Europe) there are still so many ghosts in our closets.,1303084800,,149,4.518518518518518
3650358,5,B001IZNJ2C,"I bought the whole series of ""A Haunting"" and loved it!  These DVD was great too..more like a movie version ..great quality!  Don't watch at night..you will be thinking about what you just watched..scary!",1290556800,,204,4.970588235294118
3650359,5,B001IZNJ2C,"As a fan of the Haunting Series featured on the Discovery Channel, I would rate these two shows as the best of the series both in terms of interest and in terms of believability. In both shows a paranormal investigator is summoned to evaluate the evidence that a real haunting is taking place and the evidence supports the reality of the haunting. A Haunting in Connecticut is the more frightening of the two shows while A Haunting in Georgia realistically portrays the extraordinary sensitivity of some people to the paranormal and how that sensitivity impacts their lives and those around them. These are two shows no-one with an interest in the paranormal should miss.",1277942400,8,671,4.894736842105263
3650360,3,B001IZNJ2C,"There were the precursors to the series 'A Haunting', one of my favorite shows.  I never watched these or the series when they were new but my sister found the 'A Haunting' box set  in a store for $15 and bought them for my Dad for Christmas.  I saw the box set on a shelf a few times when visiting but never borrowed it but one Halloween when I was there thought 'what the heck'.  Anyway, added these to my Halloween shows I watch during the month of October and was surprised to find out that there were two movies that inspired this series.

These are those movies.  They are presented in the old square aspect ratio so if you have a HDTV they won't look as good as the series.  They are presented in the same manner of the series, very 'Unsolved Mysteries'esk, which I really like.  But these are long, maybe it's because I'm used to the 45 minute episodes of the series, but they drag on a little.  The entire time I thought they could have fit the entire story in 45 minutes, they didn't need the 94 that they use.

I'm taking off one stars just because the quality wasn't very good, it was sub par even by DVD standards.  I'm not talking about the aspect ratio but because the video is grainy.  The other star is just because they are so long, it seemed to me that they struggled to make these 94 minutes and drug their feet.  The would have been much better as 45 minutes.",1268524800,2,1380,4.221374045801527
8311600,5,B001IZNJ2C,"A Haunting in Georgia is very well told. I actually believe this could have happened. A haunting in Connecticut is very good, but not as believable as
A Haunting In Georgia.  I do believe there is more between heaven and earth than meets the eye, and these two cases are well told. I would buy again.",1453161600,,300,4.357142857142857
8311601,5,B001IZNJ2C,"Both movies are documentaries, are very interesting.  I am a believer of the paranormal, so I was happy with this purchase.",1437091200,,123,4.857142857142857
8311602,3,B001IZNJ2C,Love it a great double feature DVD featuring the first two episodes of a haunting that started it all... and great DVD for anyones collection,1422921600,,141,4.68
8311603,5,B001IZNJ2C,The DVD was delivered on time and in good condition.  I really enjoyed this DVD and plan to buy more in the future.  One happy customer for sure.,1388620800,,145,4.142857142857143
8311604,5,B001IZNJ2C,"This is a double feature from the series ""A Haunting,"" which comes on Discovery networks. A Haunting in Connecticut is the story that was supposed to be portrayed in the motion picture a couple of years ago. However the movie changed the story. This documentary tells the real story, which is much better. A Haunting in Georgia is just as good, and is a long story. Both of these documentaries are an hour and a half long. They are a great addition for any fan of horror and paranormal stories.",1382486400,,494,4.5
8311605,5,B001IZNJ2C,"The ""Haunting in Georgia"" is good but not exceptional. The ""Haunting in Connecticut"" is excellent! I would recommend it for fans of the genre!",1381795200,,142,4.958333333333333
8311606,4,B001IZNJ2C,"Case was a beat up, and DVD had a few scratches but it worked non the less, worth the price defiantly.",1366761600,,102,3.9047619047619047
8311607,3,B001IZNJ2C,I loved this movie but halfwaly through it suddenly stopped then when i fast forwarded it worked i tried everything to make it work for that 10 minute segment. Anyways I wrote the seller and all she said was is her content is basically never flawed. She didn't even offer to replace it. Anyways I would have given this 5 stars if the seller has of corporated.,1364515200,2,359,4.373134328358209
8311608,5,B001IZNJ2C,"I ordered this DVD and must admit that I am very pleased with it. I watched the original series on the Discovery Channel and would try and catch it every time it replayed in reruns.

I must admit that I was very pleasantly surprised  because watching the dvd was like watching the shows new, because of the included material that was not the shows when they ran on television.

I actually found out that the A Haunting in Georgia actually takes place north of Columbus, Georgia and I live about 60 miles south of Columbus. When watching it on television, I always figured it was set in North Georgia.  Of the two, I like A Haunting in Connecticut better, but only because it seemed to have better closure.  When I went to see the  movie version, I was not happy, because of the liberties they took with the original and it felt like I was watching a very inferior rip off of the original or possibly, I may have like the movie if I had never seen the original.

I hate that they ended the series and I have a pretty good collection of them. I purchased the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Haunting-of-Winchester-House-2009/dp/B002S1MJEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Haunting of Winchester House (2009)</a>because one of the producers also produced the A-Haunting Series. Don't bother with this movie. It really isn't all that good and I remember seeing the Discovery channel show about the Winchester House and Sara Winchester and the only thing that is the same is the Winchester name. This movie sucks, although it does have some of the episodes from the Fox series Ghost Stories, which are not even close to A Haunting.",1356566400,,1663,4.981949458483754
8311609,5,B001IZNJ2C,"I first saw the ""A Haunting"" series on the discovery channel and I still enjoy watching re-runs whenever they air. What I like about these documentaries is that they watch more like movies due to the reenactments but with the added bonus of the people commenting first hand at how they felt when these things happened.  When I saw the dvd's were available I had to buy it! It makes for a great for a halloween marathon.

A Haunting in Connecticut is my favorite of the series. It was truly frightening to see what this family endured. A couple of years after I first saw this documentary I learned that there was a movie being made of this story. I went to see it opening weekend and all I can say is that I was so utterly and completely disappointed. This documentary was just SO much better in every way...ok maybe not the image quality...but in every other way.

A lot of horror movies of late are very superficial... just blood, guts, and a lot of sudden loud noises...none of which I find scary. What makes a really good scary story, in my opinion, is the psychological and emotional effect it has on you while watching it. This series does a great job of making you feel a connection to the people it documents, really makes you feel what it was like to be in their situation, the fear, the disbelief, the loneliness, the helplessness...and that's what's so spooky about this series.

The two stories featured in this DVD capture two situations:
Connecticut- What happens if you movie to a house that was haunted?
Georgia- What happens if it's not just a location that's haunted. What happens if you can't escape?",1345248000,,1619,4.553264604810996
