8316702,1,B001KZVQD4,I was a very disappointed in this documentary. It dosn't go into great detail. Should've been a lot more quotes from the Herndon papers. I've seen much better Lincoln documentaries then this. Really didn't learn anything new about Lincoln as expected. Especially when this was about letters and interviews from Lincoln's close family and friends. I found this documentary slow and boring. Overpriced and wouldn't recommend this to a friend.,1505174400,,440,5.3

8316704,5,B001KZVQD4,"This program, originally a two-hour presentation on the History Channel (94 minutes without commercials), gives us an intimate look at Abraham Lincoln's life from his birth in a log cabin in Kentucky to his death at Ford's Theatre in Washington DC. Most of the words come from interviews conducted and letters collected by William Herndon, Lincoln's first law partner and a good friend, who took testimony from the President's closest family, friends, and associates after he died. Eminent historians as well as actors who look remarkably like the original participants in history analyze Lincoln's character, behavior, feelings, and motivations to achieve a deeper understanding of the man and his times. Numerous hitherto unknown facts are revealed and skillfully woven together with period photographs to create a tapestry of a real life, flaws and all, that only increases our respect for the 16th president of the United States. We marvel at his ambition to transcend the poverty of his childhood, the loneliness of his young adulthood, the torments of a sometimes hellish marriage, the despair of depression, and the trials of office to become a fine person and a great leader. This 2009 video makes a superb backgrounder and an essential companion to the 2012 Steven Spielberg film ""Lincoln."" Highly recommended.",1372464000,4,1319,5.285714285714286
