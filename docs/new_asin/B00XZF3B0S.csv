7204537,5,B00XZF3B0S,Great film. The cinematography was beautifully done. The opening story by Primo is masterfully done and sets the tone for an equally powerful film.,1439856000,2,147,5.166666666666667

7204539,5,B00XZF3B0S,"Very much moved by this film.  The power of Primo's words - his story - the film resonated deeply with me beyond a gang film - it's not really a gang film per say as its the story of growing up - the struggle - and when does one actually become a man.

Primo puts his heart and soul into it, and so do the other actors.

It deeply affected me, as coming to terms with my own quest to enter manhood and understanding it all.",1439078400,4,423,3.895348837209302
7204540,4,B00XZF3B0S,"The complexities, the danger, and the seductiveness of the gang lifestyle are often explored in Hollywood cinema, but rarely with the authenticity and emotion seen in Keith Miller's Five Star. As stories of the streets go, this one relies on relationships rather than acts of violence, more closely resembling the works of David Simon than anything you'd see in Menace II Society or New Jack City. While there is a mystery spurred on by an untimely death, the film is really a collection of well-observed interactions, and one towering, charismatic performance by James ""Primo"" Grant.

Using non-actors can be a gamble, but Miller struck gold with Grant, a real-life member of the Brooklyn Bloods. He exudes authenticity out of every pore, every word rings true, especially the dichotomy that comes with being a father and the leader of a gang. It's the protective, paternal instinct that drives Five Star from dramatic start to thrilling finish. Primo is what's known as a ""five-star general"" in the Bloods; which basically makes him the untouchable Don Corleone figure of the gang. What he says goes; his word is law; nobody would dare cross him or they'll pay the price. So when Melvin, the man who mentored him dies, supposedly by a stray bullet, Primo takes it upon himself to care for his teenage son, John (John Diaz). Against the better wishes of his mother, John becomes swept up into the life of the father he barely knew, perhaps a bit too closely. Because of his lineage, he's greeted on the street with a combination of jealousy and respect. Like in any gangster movie, those who mean the most harm come with smiles on their faces.

John's energetic bravado belies his inexperience, while Primo solemnly tries to tame the young man's spirit. He knows full well how tough this life can be, and make no mistake that this is a life. Once you're in, you're in until somebody takes you out of it permanently. He grips you instantly with a somber, intense monologue about being in prison during the birth of his son. The experience shaped him, and now as a father of four with another child on the way, Primo does what he does to provide for their future. The irony is that he also recognizes the gang life could be the reason he's not there to witness that future. Grant's presence fills the entire screen; his words are carefully calculated and powerful. He may be following Miller's screenplay but you'd never know it. This is a man who has lived this life and is bringing the full weight of that experience.

While the final scenes, in which John begins to piece together what really happened to his father, may bear too much of a resemblance to less-refined gangster films, it's built on such an honest foundation that it never feels out of place. Richly observing themes of fatherhood, respect, and power, Five Star is an understated and deeply satisfying urban drama that raises the bar for the entire genre.",1439078400,7,2922,4.759368836291913
7204541,1,B00XZF3B0S,Good movie but the sound stopped working half eat through the movie,1439078400,,67,4.666666666666667
7204542,5,B00XZF3B0S,"You can feel the raw and real emotion of Primo Grant in his powerhouse performance as a version of himself. This is not your typical gang movie, don't watch this if you're looking for mindless action and violence. This is what gang movies should look like: a mindful meditation on the allure of gang life, violence and the ever-present societal precepts of manhood. This is a movie about two men struggling to find their place in a world with few options due to the systematic injustice imposed on them.",1438819200,5,503,4.662921348314606
7204543,5,B00XZF3B0S,"Shot like Nic Refn's Pusher Trilogy with an even keener eye on the humanity of its characters. Five Star brings a unique and genuine look into the life of a hardened five star general of the Bloods who wants to retire to a more family-centered lifestyle and a fresh juvenile attempting to fill the shoes of his absent father. This narrative, shot in a documentary style, with its actors playing characters that closely resemble their real-life personas, blurs the line between reality and fiction with powerful results. Five Star blew me away with it's candid depiction of real people driven by relatable desires and emotions that span generations. This is an indie crime hit that should not go unnoticed!",1438732800,3,705,4.932773109243698
