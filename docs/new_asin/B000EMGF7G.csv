8111370,4,B000EMGF7G,"This is a great sequel to the first Munto. Animation style is better, plot is better, and character development is WAAAY better.
And to be honest, there is only ONE reason I only gave it four stars.....
The later episodes didn't come out until several years after this was made, and so far, there is no release in the U.S. for it, so thus, there is also no dub.
But if you don't mind an open conclusion, watch this. NOW.",1383004800,,420,4.2625

8111373,5,B000EMGF7G,"Munto 2 is even better than Munto.  The fight scenes and relation of the chacters are greatly enhanced.  However, while it lets you visit the world of King Munto again the ending leaves you hoping for another movies to see the continuation of the characters actions at the end.",1190764800,,277,4.63265306122449
8111374,4,B000EMGF7G,"Well, I guess for being the first to review this anime I will try to give a detailed review, as much as it is possible, without giving to many spoilers away.

To begin with, if you have not watched the first movie (OVA) than you should watch it first because it is basically the continuation of the first one and many things, or plots of the story, are based on it. Furthermore, it starts exactly from there where the first one ended.

Apart from it, a brief outline of the story (SPOILERS included for the ones who have not watched the first movie!)

After saving his Magical world, which happened because magical king Munto combine his powers with the ones of Yunami - a girl from our world, Munto is facing problems from his enemies who try to destroy the heavily world blinded by the new power released. Problem is that the heavily beings are getting weaker as they continue to fight and Munto is basically in deep s...Yunami on the other hand, has started again to `connect' with Munto and wants to help him. The issue here is that Munto is afraid to call her back again, when thinking of how much pain he put her the first time and hesitates (I am referring to mentally pain here but also that Munto saw a vision that if he would call her back she might die. Additionally, it is implied that both of them are in love with each other, something that will become clear latter on). On top of that his enemies, by having seen Yunami (from Munto 1), want to find a way to draw her back to the magical world and use her and her powers. Finally, she tries to find a way to break through the barrier of space and time and enter the magical world so that to aid Munto, who will also get some help from her two other friends and school mates.

Now, to be honest why did I give it four stars, what is my recommendation and why:

To begin with, the animation is astonishing, mind-blowing I would say, especially during the battle scenes. Moreover,the story gets very emotional and in parts depressing.
Yet, if you have seen `The Last Exile', `X-One etc' or `Infinite Riviyous' (I apologize if I have misspelled it), although Munto 2 is higly recommended, you should not expect such strong story, plot and background story, as these animes had. The only excuse that I can think of is that the OVA lasts for about 100 minutes while the previous mentioned series last for at least five to six hours. This comparison made me give it four stars.(Not to mention the fact that the show has the potential and a strong 'base storyline' to become an entire series)

As for the dub, if you prefer the dub version, actually it is very good and professional orchestrated, as is the music too. Thumbs up...

As for extras, well the typical stuff that you usually find in any other anime DVD, like trailer previews, not credit opening/ending, drawings etc.

Now to the final verdict, buying it or not?

I personally recommend this show but I also have to be honest to the reader. If you have seen the first OVA and liked it than you will not be disappointed with this one (lasts for double as long as the first one), is definitely better than the first Munto and the answer is: Yes.

If you like this kind of anime genre like - let us say Fushigi Yugi, and do not mind of the few drawbacks (as I have explained above), than the answer would be Yes, otherwise: No.

As for the price, when comparing it with other anime OVAs, it is cheaper than the other ones (which spectrum is around 23-29 dollars), than go ahead and buy this one.

To conclude, it is worth at least to rent it, but as I said earlier it is up to you to make the final decision, and if you do not mind of its few drawbacks than I can recommend this show. If on the other hand, you prefer anime shows and story depths like Evangelion, FMP, CB, X, The Last Exile or Kenshin than I believe you might not want to buy this one.

As I said it is entirely up to you to decide.

I hope that I could help... ^_^",1161734400,,3947,4.30188679245283
