Season 1 the weird music is loud, annoying and almost constant, hoping the other seasons are better. Just watched CSI Miami on tv.. their music was low and in background not overriding their voices.

LOUD  background music.",1499990400,3,408,4.513513513513513
5644220,5,B00BLN4V4G,I love this series.  Hard to put down once I start watching them.,1496880000,,65,4.0
5644221,5,B00BLN4V4G,"I bought this whole series after watching 2 shows back to back on commercial TV.  I then proceeded to binge watch the series.  I don't know how this series went off the air.  The humanity of this series at its final was much warmer than the other CSI francises.

The transition between crime scenes was done better on the original and even CSI Miami, but the character development was much better in CSI-NY.

Gary Sinese is a movie star and it shows in his screen presence.  The New York natives playing on this show really make the Big Apple shine.

There are a couple episodes that approach the ""Jumping the Shark"" category, but on a whole it was a very pleasant and entertaining watch.",1496707200,,688,4.5
5644222,5,B00BLN4V4G,"Like CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and CSI:Miami, this show follows a similar format. In New York, the investigation folks are referred to as CSU (Crime Scene Unit), but the technology is the same as with the other two shows. Like CSI:Miami, the CSU folks are actual police officers, whereas in the original series, they are essentially scientists who do/can not make arrests, etc.,

The appealing part of this series is that the performers are actors who either now live or have lived in New York and understand what life is like in that compact city. This series reveals a better look of New York that is missing in shows such as Castle and White Collar, which are both, in their own way, good series.

The amount of dependency upon the CSU for not only resolving crimes and ""who did it"" is amazing. In most instances, we never see the outcome of any trials, only the evidence that the person or persons apprehended actually committed a crime.

Having the entire series as a package is wonderful because we can binge watch this show to our heart's content. My wife and I are now watching the second season and I love the characters, though CS:Miami remains my favorite.",1493510400,2,1172,4.679611650485437

5644245,2,B00BLN4V4G,This pack of seasons is messed up. Some episodes are duplicated in the earlier seasons. Many through out are out of sequence. I sent it back.,1490745600,2,141,4.461538461538462
5644246,5,B00BLN4V4G,"Because TV shows go into syndication pretty fast (and the production quality tends to be just so-so on most), you can always find what you're looking for at some point during the year so there is usually no pressing reason for us to actually buy a series on disc.  And that's what we've been doing recently...watching all 4 series in the CSI franchise.  I watched the first few years of CSI (Las Vegas) when it first aired but didn't continue after the 2nd year.  But thanks to re-runs, we've had the chance to watch all 4 and came to one obvious conclusion:  CSI:NY is, in our opinion, by far the superior installment of the CSI franchise.  While I had my own opinion of it, I noticed that whenever it was on, my husband would not only watch it but I could tell he would get really involved in it.

Why did we like it so much?  To us, the cast, the writing, the direction, the story lines, the characters, the production quality...all top notch.  They were never smarmy nor talked down to the audience.

Few opinions on the other shows in the CSI franchise:
...While the original CSI was pretty good, after a while it got to be too reminiscent of a soap opera and it was obvious the network was desperate to try and keep people interested by making too many changes.  It also stayed on longer than it should have.
...CSI:Cyber had potential but in our opinion, since it was late to franchise  CSI:Miami most likely killed it.  Aside from trying to find it's footing and letting the characters gel, the first season was pretty much ""information overload"".  And while they did their best to demonstrate each term, it got confusing.  Someone in the production must have noticed the same thing about the ""information overload"" because season 2 got much better at explaining a term each episode showing how it worked.  The characters also started to gel with each other and the audience.
...I have no idea how CSI:Miami lasted more than 2 years other than becoming a Chamber of Commerce tourist video for the city of Miami Beach  (It's sad when out of so many characters there winds up being 2 or 3 you like.)  By the time CSI:Cyber premiered, CSI:Miami was off the air only a few (3) years but it was so bad it probably burned a lot of people on the franchise.

We watch a lot of TV (we DVR all first run shows so we can FF through the commercials) and CSI:NY stands out among them all.  Even though there were a few shows we really liked, I noticed we don't watch them in syndication.  Thankfully CSI:NY is one we WANT to see again and we can't wait to start watching this show from beginning to end...again.",1489881600,7,2606,4.457805907172996

Because of surgery on my foot, it took until 5 days ago to open the package up and play some of  the discs.  I played 6 of the discs and they all had the same two episodes on them despite having different pictures on front and being in boxes from different seasons.  I was also missing some CD's all together.  I was so disappointed as I rarely like shows this much; however, this has been a favorite and I've missed it. I've sent it back for and exchange. I hope I get the all of the right disks this time. I spent a lot of money on this product and was amazed, and not in a good way, that there was so much wrong with what I'd received. Maybe the worker who filled my boxes was out all night for many nights running and was dysfunctional at this time I'm almost afraid to exchange it for a new set as I want the complete set, what I'd paid for .
