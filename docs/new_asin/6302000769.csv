7819585,5,6302000769,"My niece is attending her Jr. prom tonight---and I am watching one of

the sweetest films of her childhood.  The Marzipan Pig would lull her to

sleep with a smile on her face when she was a tiny one. . . . Lovely.",1178236800,2,214,3.9302325581395348
7819586,5,6302000769,"I find numerous rave reviews for this product which describe it at some length.  Therefore, my review will be brief.  This is the most charming little film I have ever watched.  I'm 70 now, and my entire extended family has loved watching this beautifully animated and narrated film.",1165017600,2,283,4.854166666666667
7819587,5,6302000769,"Narrated masterfully by Tim Curry, I have to say this is probably one of the most touching cartoons I have ever seen.  Brilliant work, differing from the original book version only because it skips two lines.  I'd recommend this one to just about anyone, of any age.",1064448000,5,266,4.638297872340425
7819588,5,6302000769,"For those of us adults who are tired of Disney's kistch fantasies or the violence of so many other cartoons, watching The Marzipan Pig is a most refreshing experience.  It's about the innocence, the pure love we once had, as children, but that the cruelty of this world has robbed from us.  This story is pure poetry, visual poetry.  I would gather the war-loving world leaders to make them watch this video until they gave up war altogether -just remembering when they were children and life was still full of mysteries.  It reminds me of that Supertramp song, ""The Logical Song:"" as we grow up we become cynical.  So, please, watch this wonderful video and get in touch with your inner child: our world needs it badly these days",1053907200,6,730,4.627906976744186
7819589,5,6302000769,"My friends and I watched this movie together at a CTY reunion - if you know what that is you should buy this movie/ try to see it right away/ share it with everyone you love - one of us had received it from another friend.  I always looked for it at independant video stores, but nothing.  My friend finally just sent his copy to me so that I could show it to my mother.  She and I watched it.  Then she watched it again a few days later.  It's a beautiful little film.  I trust that anyone who watches this film will laugh, but I will admit to having shed tears- in pity, empathy, whatever we call that helpless loving feeling.
It's so beautiful.
p.s. this is my first review, so if it's not convincing you...
well...it doesn't have to.  I'm just glad it exists.",1046736000,7,763,4.184931506849315
