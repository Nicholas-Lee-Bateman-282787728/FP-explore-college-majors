2640817,3,B000HT3P4W,"I was so excited for Armada to be released on TV. I held my breath in anticipation, and made sure nobody bothered me the day of the premiere. And, like many G1 fans.... I was disappointed. I didn't make any effort to watch the show for quite some time. It was these episodes on this set that made me accept, and even LIKE the show. I don't have this set yet, but I would definately buy it. The episodes near the end with Prime, Megatron, and Unicron all confronting each other... that's really good stuff!",1160524800,,505,4.326315789473684
2640818,5,B000HT3P4W,"This is perharps one of the best Transformers series, just Unicron is all you need to know.  Very good investment your kids will love it and people fans of G1 would love it too.",1157846400,,177,4.205882352941177
2640819,5,B000HT3P4W,"I was thinking that this half of the series would never get released (like the gijoe sets)but for whatever reason hasbro has allowed rhino to release the rest of this series..it basically comes down to this,part one of the series was [...],second half of the series ROCKED!!!!Unicron shows up,some autobots/decpticons die,the kids aren't in it as much,more violence and fighting less p.c. bullcrap in the second half of the series..so thanks to hasbro and rhino for getting the good episodes out there instead of us fans getting stuck with JUST the first,crappy,half of the series....",1156896000,8,584,5.157894736842105

8141218,5,B000HT3P4W,"While this segment of the Transformers franchise is not one of the most popular, I certainly enjoyed it. The quality was good and I had no problems playing it. My only qualm is that it lacks the original Japanese audio.",1347235200,,219,4.5
8141219,5,B000HT3P4W,"Armada got off to a rocky start for most people, but it more than makes up for it with this box set. There are a total of four disks, and they cover mostly the Unicorn Battles ark and most important of all, a few actual deaths in the series! (Although two of them later come back to life...make of that what you will.)

I grew up with Armada, so it's personally my favorite series. I highly reccomend this to fans of Armada, but I would suggest other fans who are looking to get into it or G1 fans to get part 1 first. Most diehard Generation 1 Transformers fans rate Armada based on its new concept. They usually complain that Peter Cullen doesn't voice Prime, or that Bumblebee and Jazz aren't in it. The fact is, this is a completely different series from Generation 1.

The animation has also improved greatly with these last episodes. Unlike part 1, there's much more action (especially in the last episode when Prime and Galvatron go at it.) and generally a more diverse story, instead of the central ""get Minicons, crush opposing army,"" we get ""Unite armies, kill giant planet-eating monster, evil is vanquished.""

Overall, I defenetly reccomend this to anyone, be you a kid or teenager. I only suggest that you get part 1 first or at least have a general idea of what the main plot and characters are, otherwise you won't have a clue when they make drawbacks to previous episodes.",1302134400,,1388,4.544
8141220,4,B000HT3P4W,"1980s G1 Transformers was epic sci-fi for kids, teens, and discerning dads.  1990s Beast Wars Transformers was a flat out awesome sci-fi series too and it's darker sequel Beast Machines was great but should probably be reserved for the 10+ fan.  Armada part 1 was pretty decent.  My kids liked it enough and I really enjoyed Beast Wars Optimus (Gary Chalk) and Megatron (David Kaye) reprising their respective roles which they do in the subsequent Energon and Cybertron Transformers Anime series.  So kudos for that.  But you sit through part 1 to get to the last 10 or so episodes of Part 2 here which takes on the title ""Armada: The Unicron Battles"".  And its pretty epic.  It reprises the awesomeness of G1 when the transformers take their battle off earth and into outer space.  My kids really enjoyed the minicons, Unicron, Unicron's evil minions, and Megatron cum Galvatron.  My kids were cool with the kids inane banter in the series.  Dads will just have to tough it out.  When scripting for the American release they're backing into the way the characters were animated speaking Japanese so it tends to be choppy and not have the elegant awesomeness that really peaked with the ever quotable Beast Wars episodes; however, the dialogue seemed to have been elevated for the series conclusion- the whole Unicron Battles portion.  Except for one of the last episodes when one of the main Autobots is giving his assessment of Unicron but the voice coming out of his mouth is that of series crazy Decepticon Demolishor.  Even my 4 year old snarfed his chocolate milk at that one.  So anyway, definitely worth renting especially for the last 10 or so episodes.  More hardcore trans-fans (the kind that didn't cry about Optimus being zombie-fied way back in the mid-80s) may want to pick it up for their ""collection"".  The kids will like it along with the Energon series(haven't seen yet) and Cybertron series(seen it and it's also pretty decent- see my review for that one) and that's what really counts here. Til all are one.",1298505600,2,2028,4.801152737752162
8141221,1,B000HT3P4W,It's japan's take on transformers and less interesting then the american transformers it's something only small children could ever like while the original has entertained teenagers.  Would save my money if I had it to do over,1297382400,,226,5.108108108108108
8141222,5,B000HT3P4W,"My son is Transformer mad, when I seen these dvd's I had to purchase them as it was costing me more by renting them every holidays. They were spot on with the description and in A1 quality. The delivery was very prompt. Thank you Amazon for fantastic service. I have since ordered more dvd's in Ben 10 and Bakugan. I have one very excited boy!",1283731200,,343,4.292307692307692
8141223,5,B000HT3P4W,"It's true, the second half IS better than the first. I definately recommended this DVD set. I really enjoyed this series and it was great to see the character's development. Very emotional and deep for a kids show! It is different from G1, but then again, has some similarities, and can be enjoyed by G1 and non-transformer fans alike.",1240790400,,335,4.694915254237288
