2952883,3,B000VTHYAE,"I love HBO shows so when I found this on sale for $19.99 I grabbed it.  I wouldn't recommend paying more than about $30 for it - if I'd paid more I would have been very disappointed.  I haven't had an experience with a show like this before - by the second episode I thought it was one of the best TV shows I'd ever seen, up there with ""Six Feet Under"".  It was fascinating to see a very realistic view of four different relationships, shown very realistically, even including very real sex scenes.  That somehow made the couples even more human.  By about the seventh episode I got tired of the characters' slow, meandering everyday lives, and the whining.  I started thinking the sex scenes were just interfering with the progress of the story, and I realized, it's difficult to maintain interest in very realistic lives when you're living one yourself every day.  I guess I learned I enjoy more drama and excitement in a TV show than I realized.",1214352000,35,948,4.508771929824562
2952884,5,B000VTHYAE,"This show is controversial due to the explicit sex scenes. If you are not into HBO shows in general, this is not  for you. These scenes are absolutely necessary for the show.

Overall, the show is impeccably written and seems so real. This show is about relationships, love, sex, and marriage. It shows the ups and downs, the perspectives of different age groups within relationships, and numerous bumps along the road for each of them.

It's real.",1207958400,3,448,4.792207792207792

2952886,1,B000VTHYAE,"What a snore-fest!  About all I saw in the first episode, were 3 couples talking (or, actually, arguing & debating each other for the most part) about their relationships, falling out of love, wanting more attention from the other, wondering if they should get more serious or back off, etc.  ...Jeez, if I wanna hear this kinda stuff, I can go visit my grandparents!

2952887,2,B000VTHYAE,"The previews leading up to this show filled me with anticipation. I was heartbroken with 'John From Cincinnati' ending and hoped that this could make up for it.
What I anticipated was a show with intelligent, gripping writing. What I got was one boring episode after another with some Skinemax thrown in for good measure. What happened in this show? I could of watched the first and the last episode and not missed anything. The stories moved so damn slow, but I hung in there and watched every episode waiting to be rewarded for my patience. And I got nothing.
All in all, the most disappointing HBO series to date. To top it off, this gets extended (no doubt plenty of people loved the graphic sex scenes), and JFC gets cancelled.",1202169600,9,732,4.595419847328245
2952888,4,B000VTHYAE,"Earlier this year, HBO offered yet another ground breaking series - this one revolving around marital strife and therapy. Opting for realism, the stories are interspersed with intensive therapy sessions, some of the most realistic and explicit intimate scenes ever presented on television, and the daily routine of couples in three stages of relationships (four if you count therapist May played by Jane Alexander and her husband of 43 years, played by David Selby).

David and Katie (Tim DeKay and Ally Walker from ""Profiler"") have been married 12 years and have grown so far apart that they are not longer intimate. Katie wants therapy to repair their distance while David just wants to skate by and pretend everything is okay. Palek and Carolyn (Adam Scott and Sonya Walger) are yuppies who have everything they could ever want except for a baby (though Palek wonders if he even wants that). Jamie and Hugo (Michelle Borth and Luke Ferrell Kirby) are an engaged couple who break up early on due to Jamie's trust issues with Hugo's fidelity. But soon another man enters her life (Ian Somerhalder, the brother from ""Lost"" who loved his sister a little too much), forcing Jamie to face the truth about her own past.

Extras include reactions to story lines by real life couples (which really don't add much), as well as behind the scenes and the usual making of shorts. It's a heavy series and oftentimes depressing; there is nothing light to the storylines, in fact viewers will wonder if any therapist can save some of these crumbling relationships.",1196035200,16,1551,4.916030534351145
2952889,5,B000VTHYAE,"Much hyped and sensitively written HBO series analyzing the marital and other problems of three couples, plus their therapist's own back story in what most people would consider late, late middle age.  You'll be surprised to see the vigor with which Jane Alexander puts into her fervent love scenes with David Selby (yes, from DARK SHADOWS).  Alexander has never struck me as being much of a softcore type, but here she looks great and she puts everything she has into it, a risky move for the former head of the NEA which might get her into trouble with her former constituency, but I think the risky work she does here gives her more credibility, and flows neatly into the scenes she has with her clients.  In a way it will remind you of Lorraine Bracco treating Tony in THE SOPRANOS and cynical minds will assume that TELL ME YOU LOVE ME is like Dr. Melfi on ecstasy, but give the show a chance, it definitely has its own rhythm, and you won't pick up on it right away if you're used to the rough and tumble rapidfire cutting of most US made hourlongs.

Here the pace is positively molasses, Ingmar Bergman style, long, long scenes of domestic life interspersed with some pretty amazing bedroom scenes (what they call ""random play"" on Facebook).  You won't believe you're watching this on TV.  But it's all mixed in with hours and hours of nothing at all, in which it's up to the actors to convince us that there are real people behind those insertions and releases.  Some of the actors are better than others, though none is really horrible.  At first I wondered, how did they talk these actors into having such realistic sex scenes?  Did they recruit them from porn movies?  But I recognized some of them from other legitimate work and I guess the answer is, they went for the gusto of it.  Dave and Katie are pushing forty, they've stopped making love and just live for their children and homelife, always repaving the patio et cetera.  Their little girl has started having her period even though she's ten.  Ally Walker plays Katie, the dissatisfied wife who wonders where all the romance went in her marriage, while Sherry Stringfield from ER plays Rita, her no nonsense pal.  La Stringfield still acts as though she were the undisputed star of the show (in fact of the entire entertainment world), but she is pared back to the point where you can actually believe it.  Tim DeKay is the husband who prefers to bring himself off under the covers rather than face another go round with his wife.  It's bleak and miserable.

Adam Scott and Sonya Walger play a somewhat younger couple, Pawlik and Carolyn.  They make love by the clock so that Carolyn can fulfill her dream of getting pregnant.  But petulant Pawlik doesn't like being made to perform at gunpoint, so he starts balking and expressing his deep dislike of his wife.  She's quite a piece of work and the script does little to soften her up.  More power to the actress who plays her because this is a tough part to play.

Finally there is Jaime, a young sous chef at a trendy restaurant, torn between two good looking guys, incapable of being faithful to either.  It was really this girl who plays her whom I thought initially wasn't as much an actress as an inflatable doll with a helium voice.  Poor Jaime can't keep her clothes on for twenty minutes at a time.  One of the boys in her life is played by former LOST star Ian Somerhalder, the other by some other dude.  One is called Nick, the other Hugo.  I can't remember now who is who, but stand back folks because, as it turns out, Michelle Borth as Jaime is the one who really wins your heart by the end of the season's run.  I began to see why she was the way she was, and credit Miss Borth for a sensitive unfolding of real depth.

The show is slow, no doubt about it, and goes to some painful places.  Will the unabashed focus on sexuality make it an audience winner?  Hard to say, but it was well worth trying out!  Give it a chance, you might learn something!  I did, about Ian Somerhalder...",1194912000,53,4019,4.491735537190083
2952890,2,B000VTHYAE,"I managed to get through maybe 45 minutes of the first episode, and could not continue this contrived story, and the characters, a vapid, self-absorbed and implausible group. The mother who finds her daughter's first period at age 10 ""sickening?"" There's been no indication of her true meaning, which I would hope was her lamentation that a 10-year-old must now cope with the responsibility of having her period instead of being allowed to be a child a few years longer, because her character has only been portrayed as one preoccupied with her marriage instead of life around her. DItto for the newly engaged couple whose obvious and flagrant PDAs indicate their hot-for-each-other sexual attraction and not any deeply meaningful connection as shown in her aversion to having a cake at the engagement party (talk about first world problem) but which is portrayed as a eyebrow furrowing glitch in their stroking of one another. As for the couple trying to get pregnant--well it's obvious of the latent hostility they share, obvious from the first moment we see them.

2952892,5,B000VTHYAE,"When it started I thought: Oh great, another reason to show people having sex...not that at all!  I felt this was about real people.  Not always making the right choices, but wanting to try and make something good from failing relationships.  I liked it a lot. I thought the sex was well done, actually...real.  Not romanticized or phony.  I forgot most of the time about the actors and saw them totally as the characters they were playing.  No one was perfect. Everyone had his or her part in the problems and in the solutions.  Life is tough on relationships, and people have to fight to make them work.

2952893,1,B000VTHYAE,"This was dull as ditchwater.  The therapist spouted commonplaces she must have picked up in Psych 101 or in some self-help book, none of the characters was developed well enough to make you care about their fate, and some of the dialogue was stultifyingly boring.

2952894,4,B000VTHYAE,"Wow, this series is a huge negative advertisement for long-term relationships!  It's truthful and does not candy coat what happens to some relationships, maybe all relationships, to a greater or lesser degree.  But there's NOTHING romantic or exciting about what transpires.  Being in any relationship is a choice and the choice is one you have to make each day as well as the choice to find yourself contented and happy there (happiness truly is an inside job).  This series demonstrates this is a very clear way.  Since it got cancelled after the first series, we're left to our own devices to figure out how this all comes to pass.  I see only two couples of the four having a chance at a surviving relationship.  Half of all marriages, right?  It's a statistic for a reason!  Don't watch this if you live in a world of rose colored glasses and want to believe that once in the right relationship it will all just be fantastic.  We're all human and all subject to the weaknesses of being such...",1515196800,6,998,4.619318181818182

Self obsession-not with who they are on a deep level, but tromping down the weary path and cycle of uninspired traditions and ideas.  Even an inkling of character development--what they are passionate about, any interests whatsoever that might spark some kind of life into these constricted, narrowly focused people.

2952905,5,B000VTHYAE,"So I think this is a great piece, for all 21+ ages to watch and think.

People first either got shocked/offended by the intense sex scene, or like me attracted, because the actresses and actors brought up the real marital and relationship here. And deep down, it's about how couples understand each other -- we do not communicate our needs and feelings as much as we thought we had done, and we have fear if we bring those feelings and issues out, our partners will disappoint us in their reaction, like Hugo, or even worse they will leave us. So we mute ourselves, avoid talking about them, like Dave and Katie. So one of the couple tries to the their partner happy but themselves don't agree, and eventually that unhappiness will drive them away, like Palek.

If we happen to go to therapist for relationship issue/advice, the therapist's role could be like help us to explain ourselves better to our partners, encourage us to express our unspoken feelings, and sometimes be the moderator to suggest some practice to hold a healthy relationship.

No one is born to know how to have a lasting healthy relationship, so try not to just sit there and let it 'develop' -- it will go nowhere.",1513296000,2,1188,4.62085308056872

Especially offensive was the otherwise sexy *looking* Jaime character insisting that her boy friends be object raped with con dumbs so as to physically match a ""plastic fantastic lover"" DILDO.  Then there's the obsessive insistence on littering the landscape with yet more programmable illogic devices that Carolyn was inflicting on Palek, then telling him to masturbate when he wants sex for any purpose other than population littering.  For Katie and Dave it's having their interest in each other as sexual humans obliterated after inflicting a pair of children on themselves.

2952920,4,B000VTHYAE,"The therapist is supposed to tie the characters together, but I don't think she does. The fact that we know about her and her life makes it seems unreal. It's too much of a coincidence that the same therapist knows all of these people, or that all of the characters are tied together. Granted, it makes the drama more doable. But the likelihood that the same therapist sees all of these people, is really not very real. As well, getting any man to a therapy session at all, let alone getting them to talk, is not very common. So the fact that all these guys go to therapy, and talk while they are there, does not seem real either. At the same, time, the therapist does not slant her comments toward the female in session, which is actually quite common if it is a female therapist. Guys talking about their feelings in sessions like these can be really shocking to the males senses. These guys act like they have already been in a few sessions and know the therapist. Near the end of the plot sequence, after all of the sex scenes, the plot seems more real, because they are starting to deal with their problems. In this, we get a more real picture of what real conflict is like. There is give and take. There are real, raw emotions. In that sense, this is rare.

Even the sex was i felt very appropriate for the relationships. and i loved that there wasn't crap loads of airbrushing and what-forth! I hope to see a season 2. This show was extremely accurate for couples in a similar situations. again the realness in the episodes was astounding. from the infertility and miscarriage to the confusion of wanting or not waiting to be a  parent. from the bouncing in and out of relationships and spur of the moment marriage. I love that they showed the therapists personal life! its effeminately a one of a kind show i loved!",1485216000,,937,4.544378698224852

2952960,1,B000VTHYAE,Couldn't even get through the second episode. Some of it rings true (I am married with children) but the characters are so unsympathetic and the therapy sessions seem to contain nothing remotely enlightening that it just isn't even entertaining to watch. The casting is almost insulting in its whiteness and the characters are all very stereotypically attractive (except Adam Scott who is admittedly a little less typical looking for Hollywood). The characters also seem unable to be honest with themselves or to be reflective. All the sex? Pointless and stupid and not even interesting to watch (people who have this much sex should at least have some technique!). People who are engaged do not randomly have sex in daylight in parking lots or in apartments they are considering renting. There is no chemistry between the actors and practically no story line that I could determine from 1.5 episodes. And practically the worst part? The beige color palette so popular for the time this was made but very unappetizing now that we are used to seeing actual COLOR and contrast in tv shows.,1484697600,4,1087,4.978021978021978
2952961,5,B000VTHYAE,"I really miss In Treatment and while this is very different, giving much more emphasis on the lives of the clients (couples in this case), it still gave me that peek behind the door of the therapist's office and into the lives of the people who reach out to her to help improve theirs. So, even if In Treatment was too clinical for you, I would suggest giving TMYLM a chance. I think most adults can relate to parts of at least some of the relationships and maybe even feel inspired to reflect and work on your own. On thing to note: it is fairly sexually explicit.

2952979,5,B000VTHYAE,"I find this series to be an excellent exploration of various couples problems relating to sexual adjustment within and outside of marriage in the modern era.  What is most ironic about the relationships explored is that the oldest couple in the series has the most well adjusted and healthiest sex life, while the younger couples are floundering in various forms of psycho-sexual dysfunction.  The story line of each couple demonstrates that a healthy sexual life involves a lot more than just the coupling of bodies and is actually a lot more about achieving genuine intimacy between the two partners than anything else.",1482969600,2,621,5.078431372549019

The script and directing are very predictable and nothing is good or good enough ever, even when something should be.  These actors have little chemistry and the change of emotions are on a dime.  happy, happy ANGRY....  o.k., o.k., NOT O.K.!  There are a few scenes of sexuality that are meant to feel real, and in some ways they seem to be, but the follow-up conversations and reactions are over the top and ruin what may have been legitimate moments.  I want to feel for these characters, but the only likeable character is the goofy dad guy, but even his scripting is poorly written.  It could be a decent real-life feeling program, but it's not there yet.

2953020,3,B000VTHYAE,"This series is about three couple, the challenges of relationships, in particular, the challenges that are relative to their sex lives and their interaction with the therapist (Jane Alexander) they are each seeing to understand and resolve these dynamics.  Because the relationship of the therapist and her husband is also included, it is actually about four couples. The episodes dealt with very real situations that can occur in committed relationships. Their issues run a full gamut: Absence of sex in relationship; inability to get pregnant; fear of commitment.  I think I can safely say that it is actually a series of soft porn.  There are alot of very specific sex scenes. Jane Alexander gives a believable performance, as she always does.  Although the basis for the series is realistic, much of the acting of the other people was lackluster and mediocre, The chemistry and acting between Dave and Katie is the most believable and authentic in performance.  In my opinion, Carolyn and Palik do not make sense to be paired as a couple and have little real chemistry to make their performances believable.

2953127,5,B000VTHYAE,"Unfortunately, I missed this show the first time around.  I am now watching this show on Amazon Prime.  Despite reading several negative reviews, I applaud the show for two reasons.

First, It is ""spot-on"" in its depiction of so many marriages where any passion that may have once existed has long fizzled out; it's only remaining purpose is to masquerade as a ""union"" for the sake of the kids.  The only way they can stand it is by distractions such as ""redoing the patio.""  No wonder ""couples therapy"" is a booming profession today!

Secondly, I applaud the depiction of older couples as sexual beings.  It is high time for stereotyping to end for for those of a certain age.  Older people, just as younger ones, do indeed express their love for each other physically.  Sexual expression of love is not limited by the number of candles on one's birthday cake.  The stereotype of the sexless older person needs to be smashed to bits!  This series does a great job of doing just that!",1470960000,10,984,4.630057803468208

Although the problems the characters encountered were real and difficult to manage, the dialogue was limited, predictable, and punctuated far too frequently with ""you know, shit, f---"".

2953227,5,B000VTHYAE,This category of t.v. series is intoxicating for me.  I've thus far watched this and In Treatment with Gabriel Byrnes.  The opportunity for character building and intimacy with the characters is the the success of this platform.  I'm a Barber so you would think I would get enough of people but I just love going on this ride of our human psyche. I'll be looking for more like this.,1468713600,,382,4.507246376811594

2953232,1,B000VTHYAE,This video is ideal for people with a love of hard-core porn. Love me a video that features lovemaking that shows sincere feeling and maybe EVERYTHING else. This is not it.

2953239,4,B000VTHYAE,"This show requires a lot of time and patience, but it is as real as it gets in relationship & captures the nuances of non verbal communication between couples, which is hard to do. The casting is excellent & the therapy sessions are well executed. The show is well written overall and it's a real shame/loss it didn't get a 2nd season.",1468540800,,335,4.419354838709677

2953251,5,B000VTHYAE,A great picture of relationships between men and women in all stages of the complicated unhealthiness asking the way.  I think it will appeal more to women than most men; but I think it does a great job of showing both the male and female (hetero only so far) perspective.  The sex scenes are graphic and realistic.  I appreciate the fact that they show older couples.... I'm talking over 60.  You never see that in TV so it shows that people are still sexual even when we're get old!!,1468540800,,485,4.415730337078652
2953252,1,B000VTHYAE,"It is a bunch of couples who have real issues...however; it just came across as a bunch of whiny, self involved couples.  The show seemed to rely heavily on the gratuitous sex scenes to get the stories through. The only time sex was not involved was when the story line focused on the couple who were not having sex and that was their problem. By the time I was done watching the series...I was rooting for all the couples to separate.",1468540800,,435,4.37037037037037

As I move along into the season I have a feeling they will become more intertwined.  This show is more ""sex""y than others, meaning it shows more of the real sex than the hidden scenes behind what appears to be sex, definitely not for kids or even young adults maybe but for mature adults being able to watch these scenes you get more of an emotional attachment to each character with these types of scenes.",1468454400,,500,4.606741573033708

Why do some reviewers complain about the ""slow pace"" and boredom?  My suspicion is that those viewers have no interest in the ordinary lives of ordinary people. And this film is a study of such lives.
The credits reveal that WOMEN were pretty much in charge of this entire production. So... kudos to those ladies!
Jane Alexander as the therapist was excellent.
Michelle Borth and Sonya Walger were both absolutely GORGEOUS, and so very sexy!!  They were also effective as actresses. Ms. Walger had the more demanding role and was awesome.
About the sex scenes--if they all were simulated, it was done with more finesse than I have ever seen in mainstream films. Many of them looked totally real to me. Even my wife appreciated that touch of honesty.

2953443,3,B000VTHYAE,"I had high hopes about this series, and stuck with it for as long as I could.  Unfortunately with the exception of the therapist (played by Jane Alexander), all of the characters were completely unlikable. The one strength HBO has in almost all of their series (from the charming and lighthearted comedy ""Dream On"" to the violent and edgy ""Game of Thrones"") is their character development. Regardless if the viewers love the character (Martin Tupper) or despise the character (King Joffey) we are invested in the arc of the character. We as viewers continue to view the characters to see what direction they will take us and give us the necessary reaction to ask ""what are they going to do next""?

With ""Tell Me You Love Me"" the characters are not only unlikable, but exhausting, uninteresting and flat. To listen to their tiring minutia about the conflicts they encounter regarding their sex lives makes you want to tell every single one the couples to simply break up and inject a new love interest in their life, for no other reason than to introduce us to new and hopefully more interesting characters. I will admit the sex is quite hot, and somewhat realistic, the way people (who actually WANT to have sex with one another) do have sex. Unfortunately you have the sexual engagement, then they start to talk again, and it all goes downhill from there.

The most interesting parts of the series was with the therapist, and I was hoping the show would go further with that dynamic (and develop more engaging dialogue by the characters). In fact I can see that portion of the show being a prelude to the fantastic HBO series ""In Treatment"". I hated almost everyone in that series, but man was I invested in the patients and their sessions. ""Tell Me You Love Me"" never took me to that place where I said ""can you believe he/she/they said that?"" I had some hope for the younger couple given that at that age you're figuring things out about love, life and relationships in between their multiple sex sessions. They even went as far as to break up and explore relationships with other people.  But once again they open their mouths with trite dialogue, and once again I lose interest. The creators of the show seem to lost in knowing where to go beyond ""let's screw"" followed by ""you don't understand.""  It became emotionally taxing for the viewer to see this endless cycle of conflict with no meaningful progress, let alone resolution.

I guess the one thing that did maintain my interest was as unlikable as the characters were, I enjoyed seeing how much they argue over and over again about the same relationship issues (""why doesn't he want to f*** me any more"", ""his negativity is preventing us from conceiving"", ""you are interested in other women"") where I'm hoping one or more of them will either have a full-blown meltdown, an emotional explosion or engage in such reckless behavior to the point where the meltdown or explosion will occur.  I know that's cynical and mean-spirited to wish on the characters.  But at least that will make them interesting.  And I guess that is what I was hoping for in ""Tell Me You Love Me,"" and why I stuck with it: to have that unexpected ""holy sh*t"" reaction I've been used to in an HBO series.  The show was ambitious, but certainly didn't live up to my expectations.  Purchase or stream it if and when you feel the price is right.",1423440000,6,3374,4.653781512605042

2953477,4,B000VTHYAE,"Though my husband almost ran from the room gagging when the elder characters were getting it on, I found those scenes very tasteful. The actress who played the doctor (forgive me, I don't have the names, so I will refer to them in character) was excellent. Not so excellent was the performance of the actress who played ""Katie""--a young forty-something, uncomfortable with her own sexuality and place in mid-life. She put a lot of crap on her husband. In the end, Katie and Dave's relationship ""works"", although watching some 20 hours of Katie's grimacing/weird facial expressions, was more than enough for me.

Great performance by the actor who played ""Pawlick"". His wife was a major pill--I could hardly stand her. WHY she called him from the doctor's office is beyond me. Good riddance girl, you ARE a lawyer! Dump the loser! The writers didn't do young professional women any service there (trying not to give anything away here).

I liked ""Jamie"". Though a little shallow, I remember the age. Being in our early 20's wasn't easy. I wouldn't want to do it again. Jamie was not hard on the eyes...although the entire season it looked as if she needed her hair washed...maybe her whole body scrubbed down and disinfected after all of those sexual partnters, lol. The chemistry between she and ""Hugo"" (great name) was noted.

Overall, this is a great DVD to kick back and enjoy a glass/bottle of wine with. I'm sorry there wasn't a second season. For those uncomfortable with seeing body parts like testicles, naked women over 55, graphic masturbation, or people urinating on pregnancy test strips, this DVD is probably not for you.",1366934400,,1634,4.870503597122302

2953483,4,B000VTHYAE,"I'll admit I was lured to this show for the sex, the nudity.
It delivered, though thus far I've seen only the pilot episode (Season 1).

In the 80's and 90's, I loved the TV series ""Thirty-Something"", with Patricia Wettig, Ken Olin, Tim Busfield et al.
And during my separation from my wife, and through our divorce (in 1995), I watched that show's re-runs, seeing certain elements of my marriage revisited.

""Tell Me You Love Me"" (the pilot episode) reminds me sooooooooo much of that show!!
It has the cinema verite-style of filming, the always-serious discussions of love, marriage, sex, affairs, the beautiful 30-something (sic!) characters (even if one or two are in their 20's), the drama.

What ""Thirty-Something"" did NOT have was the nudity or graphic sex, even if Michelle Borth says the sex was NOT real!!
Thus, ""Tell Me You Love Me"" seems to be ""Thirty-Something""-Revisited......with sex and nudity added!!

And Jane Alexander, a consummate actress, whose character seems to have a sex life of her own, at 60-plus!!

I definitely will buy the entire first season, and recommend it to anyone who loved that 80's show, or shows like it!!",1348704000,3,1146,4.917098445595855

2953486,5,B000VTHYAE,"I love that this show does not hold back the way people feel in the situations that they're in. Also, I love this show's vision as it breaks the fairytale life that people grow up thinking marriage is. It's not going to be rainbows and sunlight all the time. There will be hardships along the way and you need to communicate with each other or all is lost, but even then it might not work out, which is why I loved this show. All 3 (technically 4) couples represent a stage in the development of a ""Relationship"". The engaged couple, the 1-2yr married couple, the 12 year married couple w/kids (oy), and the silver-haired old couple. Each with their own real problems that can come up in our very own relationships that we have. You watch this show wanting to know what comes next but at the same time not wanting to see what happens because you care for these people. There people are REAL to you.

You can't bare to see what happens to them Maybe it's because you can totally relate to one of them cause you're afraid. Maybe you were that person and you're seeing yourself being played out on TV and it's sorta embarrassing. Maybe you want to know what ""would"" have happened if you did take that coarse of action, well.. you see it play out here. It also gets you talking and discussing with people why the person did what they did, would your spouse/significant other really spazz out if they were put in that position, etc. Amazing show, the cast is great. Recommnded for anyone who wants to see a great REAL show about relationships and inadvertently make your own stronger, this is it.",1321574400,3,1591,4.4673539518900345
2953487,5,B000VTHYAE,"I bought this about a year back and watched episodes 1-9 in a marathon. I got about 20 minutes into the final 10th episode, and knowing it was going to be over for good, I could not complete it, because I didn't want it to be over. I recently just did.

Tell Me You Love Me revolves around three couples, Jamie and Hugo (Borth and Kirby), Katie and David (Walker and DeKay) and Carolyn and Palek (Walger and Scott), each with their own problems concerning intimacy in their relationships. They seek the help of therapist May Foster, who herself has relationship issues with her partner Arthur (Selby). [from Wiki]

The amount of true, honest character studies in this show is immense. Mind you I'm 21, and am a Psychology Major who has taken 12 Psych related courses over about 3 semesters, including a dirty but enlightening Human Sexuality course in 2009.

This is where careers were started for many of today's more popular stars. Go on back to filming in 2007-2008 and no one had probably heard of the following people:

Michelle Borth as Jaime, currently portraying Dr. Rebecca Gordon on ABC's ""Combat Hospital.""
Tim DeKay did some fine work as David, the frustrated dad; currently known as Peter Burke on USA's ""White Collar.""
Adam Scott as Palek, currently known for his role as Ben on NBC's ""Parks and Rec.""
Sonya Walger as Carolyn, also known for Penny from ABC's ""Lost."" Boy, was I lost at that ending. Who wasn't?
Ally Walker as Katie, best known earlier as the cute detective on ""Profiler"" in the mid 1990s. Currently in Lifetime series ""The Protector."" I knew I recognized her face elsewhere!

et al.

The show caused people to be ""up in arms"" about the very real depiction of sex. For those who think it was real; you're sadly mistaken. The Actor's Union does not; and will not allow for actual sex (i.e. penetration, adult ""actress"" style) on camera. It was simulated very well and filmed with a touch of brilliant lighting and camera work to make you think they were having sex. Michelle Borth was the most featured here, and she has said: ""Yeah, we can't do it for real. It's simulated.""

My guess is they were wearing certain things to protect themselves and the ""believe it at face value"" minds, like a ""patch"" over that area and maybe a ""sock"" over his.

With that said, Dr. Cynthia Mort (creator, executive producer, writer, etc) as a future doctor myself (a few years away), I really don't see why they canceled your brilliant, honest, and true show. It firmly stands as the pinnacle of truth for any couple in any relationship. Like some, I would've loved a second season.",1314316800,6,2595,4.663019693654267

The show aired on HBO - not surprising given some of the graphic sex scenes.  But also not surprising that there was no second series despite great potential. Although the topics explored are highly relevant and important, some of the scenes are laughable and make a mockery of what should be very emotional to the viewers.

The premise -> we are watching the lives of essentially 4 couples varying so differently in age (20s-30s-40s-50s) that the show is NOT targeted to any group in particular.  So you just jump from one couple to another couple when you find their scene painfully boring.  You crave some action.  You want a character you can actually like and identify with but these characters do not make it easy.

It's like being a fly on the wall and finding out that there are similarities among all of us - we want to love and be loved.  It also makes you realize that people are not always what they appear to be, and that sex doesn't end just because you get older.

2953500,4,B000VTHYAE,"I snagged this after one of the creators of ""Spartacus Blood & Sand"" listed this series as one of his favorite and said the somewhat graphic sex scenes were 'ground breaking'.

'Tell Me You Love Me' was sort of like the R-rated version of ""Thirtysomething"", lots of whining and a smattering of humping. It's the story of three couples (actually two couples and one extra whiny Hipster twit) who go and see Jane Alexander's relationship therapist.

One couple is decidely Yuppiesh -- they live in a swank architecturally daring house that looks like it cost millions and Sonya Walger's lawyer wife is extra manipulative to her effeminate, dead boring husband, played vapidly by Adam Scott (and his floppy hair).

The second is a skinny grasping young saute chef played by Michelle Borth and is probably THE most annoying character. She's in a twist because her fiance admitted he didn't see himself being faithful to her for all eternity when they tie the knot. She retaliates by dumping him, humping a couple of different guys (including 'Lost's' Ian Somerhandler) and then going to Jane Alexander's therapist who promptly detects that the gal has never been faithful to any of her lovers.

Personally, I didn't give two figs for the Yuppie couple or the Hipster and her problems. The meatiest plot and characters were reserved for Tim DeKay and Ally Walker as the Old Married Fuds, David and Katie. They're both excellent parents, devoted to their kids, furiously busy homemakers (there's a lot of renovating) ... and they're terrible lovers, sensually completely lost to each other and 'in a lot of pain' as Alexander's therapist aptly puts it. This couple seemed the most believable probably because they're the most flawed. Walker's Katie has a big problem. She's can't bring herself to masturbate and she's terrified her husband knows. Seeing as how self-gratification is the first stop on the orgasm bus, Katie's in trouble. In the finale ep, when David and Katie find each other again sexually there's a lot of good acting and it's appropriately steamy. The Married Fuds were the couple I really cheered for.",1278460800,,2115,4.966101694915254

The director's habit of exploring the fine details of an actor's anatomy generally establishes nothing about the characters or the relationship between the characters, with a couple of important exceptions. Once it's established that the characters are having sex, there's no need to observe the mechanics, especially when it comes at the expense of observing the impact of the act. I found myself fast-forwarding through the sex scenes, because in general they were long, tedious, artless and irrelevant. It's rather like spending two minutes watching a scene of someone silently eating a plate of spaghetti, with closeups on their fork, plate and mouth. The point of it is what exactly? That said, the performances in this show are phenomenal. The pain and dysfunction on display is raw and honest, but nevertheless it is deeply affecting to watch the characters in the show struggle against their own imperfections for the sake of their spouse.

2953508,2,B000VTHYAE,"This series of 10 episodes ran on HBO a couple of years ago. It was supposed to continue but never did. After viewing this first and only season, I can understand why. The series began with great promise but ultimately petered out. It lacked characters compelling enough to want to follow and plot lines strong enough to sustain more episodes.
I guess it will ultimately be remembered most for the very gratuitous sex which occasionally borders on the pornographic. One of the achievements of the series is to portray how sex can be used to cover up problems or compensate for them -- but how its absence too can be so terribly destructive to a relationship. Ultimately, I got tired of the sex. Characters were forever throwing off some or all of their clothes to indulge in briefing panting, grunting bouts like animals coupling in the woods. It got to be unsavory and ultimately boring.
The series circles around three couples and their therapist played by Jane Alexander, who with her husband and former lover forms a fourth menage. I was struck by how useless she was as a therapist. For her banal observations I certainly would not shell out $110 an hour.
Couple one, Dave and Katie, live a middleclass life with two kids in the suburbs and seem happy -- except that they haven't made love in a year. Dave prefers quiet masturbation. It's not clear why. Is there a reason, other than the fact that the scriptwriters decided it should be so?
Couple two, Carolyn and Pallack (not sure of the spelling) are rich and successful and self-absorbed. She wants a baby but can't get pregnant. Couple three are Jamie and Hugo, 20-somethings about to get married. They split up when Hugo can't verbally commit to remain faithful for the rest of his life. Jamie falls straight into bed with Nick.
None of these people was tremendously compelling or interesting. None of them seem to have much of an intellectual life. They don't appear to read or listen to music or attend the theater. It's all work and screwing.
The series sells the view that being and staying married is tremendously difficult. Is it so difficult? Many of us manage just fine.
The real problem with this series, as compared to other HBO offerings that I have so admired such as ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Wire"" is that those dramas were packed full of memorable characters bursting with life, while the characters in ""Tell Me You Love Me"" seem to be sleepwalking through life.",1242086400,,2436,4.707259953161593

2953513,3,B000VTHYAE,"(NOTE: SOME SPOILERS BELOW--TREAD LIGHTLY!)

I have to admit that, as a clinician myself, I'll watch most anything that has a mental health angle in it. Typically, they never get the therapy (or the therapist) done right, at least for more than a fleeting moment. This show is no exception. The premise is interesting: several couples is a mid-size metropolis are seeing the same shrink, and we see them both during therapy and in their 'real' lives. The shrink, too, has her own life outside the office, and we (the audience) are a busy fly on many walls as we follow them all around each episode. We hear the outlines of their problems in therapy, and we go deeper when we are with them outside, comparing the two evolving versions & seeing where the truth comes up a little short, and where they are copping out. In one sense, we are used to this device as it was used religiously (and very effectively) in the Sopranos. So we see a bit of the sociopathy of everyday life, to coin a phrase; or, maybe just an honest look at the flaws of human characters.

You can see where this mid-western novella is going to go--it's a small town and their paths are going to cross, eventually, and realize they are all therapy sibs. But, we only got a hint of that by the end of season one. Too bad--I thought there were going to be some pyrotechnics when all those fuses started to catch.....but....oh well! I guess the producers were pretty confident about getting a second go round.

Along the way, we flies are witness to the most raw, naturalistic sex scenes that I have ever seen on TV/cable. That is not to say it is sexy stuff--it is pretty unpolished & non-stylized. You see all the anatomy, somewhat obliquely and in natural low light conditions, but nothing is left to the imagination. The only thing I was wondering was, are those prosthetic phalli or the real thing? And the sex scenes tend to drag on, and there is no pretense here to make the trysts hot, sexy, kinky--they are just pretty run of the mill, daily grind kind of stuff. Some highlights you ask? Well, we get to see the husband in the sexless marriage treat himself to some solo satisfaction--and boy was I sorry I watched that scene! And, for the geriatric set--there is included a pretty raw scene with Jane Alexander and her husband getting it on in a recliner. There was one reviewer who said how great she looked in this scene--well, I would say that with her clothes on she is indeed a classy, elegant grand dame. But, nude and vigorously humping? Please, this was not sexy and not entertaining. Good commercial for Viagara, but that is about it. In fact, whenever there is a sex scene one feels as if it is very private and this is the time to go fix a sandwich or shut off the sprinklers, rather than do so at the commercial. It is a rather interesting artistic achievement, to say the least.

Here is the BIG problem with this show, as I see it: none of the characters are likeable. None. Not one. Their stories are somewhat interesting, but you cannot develop a liking for any of the people. Most of them are professional class, and they are all whiners, wimps, phonies, narcissists, sex-addicts, or anhedonic icebergs. Or some combination of the above. They are SO bland and/or neurotic that you don't want to spend an hour a week with them, not a one of them. Oh, and don't you be looking for any persons of color in this show--unless you count different hair colors as evidence of diversity. It's all Oscar Meyer on Wonder Bread with mayo on a paper plate. A plain, white paper plate.... There is no diversity among the characters, between the character, or within the characters. Imagine 'All in the Family' and every character is an insipid, vacuous version of Archie Bunker. Guys like us we had it made....

Even in the Sopranos, you could develop a liking for those greedy psychopathic killers and their various sycophantic partners--THAT was part of the incredible achievement of that show. To make you forget that these Jersey guys with the SUVs who are wolfing down franks at a bbq are stone-cold killers, and they are just regular folks with mortgages, PTA meetings, mid-life crises, etc. And--you identify just a little with the lure of the larceny and of getting away with it....But here? You wouldn't want to share a cup of joe with any of these people. This to me is the main crisis, as a viewer.

Another main weakness, ironically, is the whole therapy device. I thought Jane Alexander was earnest in the anchoring central role as the therapist, but she was stuck with some of the lamest therapist dialogue yet concocted for a TV show. And, we are dropping in at the moment when her big book is being released, so we are led to believe she is really some kind of expert, but I found her verbal interventions wordy, trite, unrealistic, patronizing, and untherapeutic. But, she was earnest and sincere, for what that is worth: the cases move along more or less disastrously for each of the couples. Nice work! This tendency to romantic decline includes Jane's own marriage, imperiled by the mid-season revelation of a past affair, which threatens to resume when her ex-lover just happens to turn up in this ever-shrinking cesspool of a town.

So, while I stuck it out for the entire season, I was ready to bail about a third of the way through, but my gal and I were committed to seeing it through. Probably the most interesting aspect was that the producers attached about 5-6 minutes onto the end of each episode that featured real life couples who were watching and commenting on the show's progress and how it sort-of mirrored their own struggles. Now, these people WERE very likeable and interesting, more so than the actual cast. That was another problem with the show, as far as I was concerned. And, similarly, the show did spark good discussions between my partner and I. So, in the end, it was a case of life imitating life that was imitating art that bore no resemblance at all to life, at least any life you would want to be living.

Well, I guess maybe see it for yourself and decide, but if you are not into it by the 3rd show, it ain't getting any better!",1222041600,52,6161,4.564195298372513
2953514,5,B000VTHYAE,"I wish, sometimes, that the general populace of this United States were not so screwed up when it comes to sex.  However, this is not the case and as a result of this slack-jawed, priggish mindset, the rest of us are robbed of one of the most intelligent, insightful programs this viewer has seen in some time.

Cynthia Mort has depicted a laser focused and thoughtful portrayal of intimacy in ""Tell Me You Love Me"".  She has stripped the inner workings of an intimate, sexual relationship bare with four couples in different stages of their lives.  The effect is at once disturbing, hilarious, frightful, and hopeful as these adjectives are really the bones of any relationship.  This is a series every person involved in an intimate, sexual relationship should watch more than once.

The cast is brilliant, if not to mention, courageous. Michelle Borth (who knew she was more than just a femme du jour?) and Luke Kirby portray the ""new loves"" preparing for their wedding day. Sonya Walger (Mort shows her genius in recognizing this woman's talent) and Adam Scott play a childless couple struggling for a baby. Ally Walker, of ""Profiler"" fame (too long away from the view of the masses) and Tim DeKay of ""Carnivale"" are the married-for-years-with-kids scenario.  Jane Alexander (formidable!) and David Selby (a far cry from  ""Dark Shadows'"" Quentin Collins) play and older, mature couple.  All of these actors bring precise candor to their portrayals provoking intense reactions from the watcher.

As you find yourself muttering under your breath, ""You bitch!"" or ""You bastard!"" you ultimately realize that you would be the ultimate hypocrite to even attempt to choose sides.

And, yes, they all have sex.  It would be silly to present a discourse on intimacy in sexual relationships without the act of sex.  So, get over it and watch this show!",1216339200,6,1846,4.954545454545454

By about the seventh episode I got tired of the characters' slow, meandering everyday lives, and the whining.

3187385,4,B000VTHYAE,"Earlier this year, HBO offered yet another ground breaking series - this one revolving around marital strife and therapy. Opting for realism, the stories are interspersed with intensive therapy sessions, some of the most realistic and explicit intimate scenes ever presented on television, and the daily routine of couples in three stages of relationships (four if you count therapist May played by Jane Alexander and her husband of 43 years, played by David Selby).

David and Katie (Tim DeKay and Ally Walker from ""Profiler"") have been married 12 years and have grown so far apart that they are not longer intimate. Katie wants therapy to repair their distance while David just wants to skate by and pretend everything is okay. Palek and Carolyn (Adam Scott and Sonya Walger) are yuppies who have everything they could ever want except for a baby (though Palek wonders if he even wants that). Jamie and Hugo (Michelle Borth and Luke Ferrell Kirby) are an engaged couple who break up early on due to Jamie's trust issues with Hugo's fidelity. But soon another man enters her life (Ian Somerhalder, the brother from ""Lost"" who loved his sister a little too much), forcing Jamie to face the truth about her own past.

Extras include reactions to story lines by real life couples (which really don't add much), as well as behind the scenes and the usual making of shorts. It's a heavy series and oftentimes depressing; there is nothing light to the storylines, in fact viewers will wonder if any therapist can save some of these crumbling relationships.",1196035200,16,1551,4.916030534351145
3187386,5,B000VTHYAE,"Much hyped and sensitively written HBO series analyzing the marital and other problems of three couples, plus their therapist's own back story in what most people would consider late, late middle age.  You'll be surprised to see the vigor with which Jane Alexander puts into her fervent love scenes with David Selby (yes, from DARK SHADOWS).  Alexander has never struck me as being much of a softcore type, but here she looks great and she puts everything she has into it, a risky move for the former head of the NEA which might get her into trouble with her former constituency, but I think the risky work she does here gives her more credibility, and flows neatly into the scenes she has with her clients.  In a way it will remind you of Lorraine Bracco treating Tony in THE SOPRANOS and cynical minds will assume that TELL ME YOU LOVE ME is like Dr. Melfi on ecstasy, but give the show a chance, it definitely has its own rhythm, and you won't pick up on it right away if you're used to the rough and tumble rapidfire cutting of most US made hourlongs.

Here the pace is positively molasses, Ingmar Bergman style, long, long scenes of domestic life interspersed with some pretty amazing bedroom scenes (what they call ""random play"" on Facebook).  You won't believe you're watching this on TV.  But it's all mixed in with hours and hours of nothing at all, in which it's up to the actors to convince us that there are real people behind those insertions and releases.  Some of the actors are better than others, though none is really horrible.  At first I wondered, how did they talk these actors into having such realistic sex scenes?  Did they recruit them from porn movies?  But I recognized some of them from other legitimate work and I guess the answer is, they went for the gusto of it.  Dave and Katie are pushing forty, they've stopped making love and just live for their children and homelife, always repaving the patio et cetera.  Their little girl has started having her period even though she's ten.  Ally Walker plays Katie, the dissatisfied wife who wonders where all the romance went in her marriage, while Sherry Stringfield from ER plays Rita, her no nonsense pal.  La Stringfield still acts as though she were the undisputed star of the show (in fact of the entire entertainment world), but she is pared back to the point where you can actually believe it.  Tim DeKay is the husband who prefers to bring himself off under the covers rather than face another go round with his wife.  It's bleak and miserable.

Adam Scott and Sonya Walger play a somewhat younger couple, Pawlik and Carolyn.  They make love by the clock so that Carolyn can fulfill her dream of getting pregnant.  But petulant Pawlik doesn't like being made to perform at gunpoint, so he starts balking and expressing his deep dislike of his wife.  She's quite a piece of work and the script does little to soften her up.  More power to the actress who plays her because this is a tough part to play.

Finally there is Jaime, a young sous chef at a trendy restaurant, torn between two good looking guys, incapable of being faithful to either.  It was really this girl who plays her whom I thought initially wasn't as much an actress as an inflatable doll with a helium voice.  Poor Jaime can't keep her clothes on for twenty minutes at a time.  One of the boys in her life is played by former LOST star Ian Somerhalder, the other by some other dude.  One is called Nick, the other Hugo.  I can't remember now who is who, but stand back folks because, as it turns out, Michelle Borth as Jaime is the one who really wins your heart by the end of the season's run.  I began to see why she was the way she was, and credit Miss Borth for a sensitive unfolding of real depth.

The show is slow, no doubt about it, and goes to some painful places.  Will the unabashed focus on sexuality make it an audience winner?  Hard to say, but it was well worth trying out!

It's truthful and does not candy coat what happens to some relationships, maybe all relationships, to a greater or lesser degree.  But there's NOTHING romantic or exciting about what transpires.  Being in any relationship is a choice and the choice is one you have to make each day as well as the choice to find yourself contented and happy there (happiness truly is an inside job).  This series demonstrates this is a very clear way.  Since it got cancelled after the first series, we're left to our own devices to figure out how this all comes to pass.  I see only two couples of the four having a chance at a surviving relationship.  Half of all marriages, right?  It's a statistic for a reason!  Don't watch this if you live in a world of rose colored glasses and want to believe that once in the right relationship it will all just be fantastic.

3187402,5,B000VTHYAE,"So I think this is a great piece, for all 21+ ages to watch and think.

People first either got shocked/offended by the intense sex scene, or like me attracted, because the actresses and actors brought up the real marital and relationship here. And deep down, it's about how couples understand each other -- we do not communicate our needs and feelings as much as we thought we had done, and we have fear if we bring those feelings and issues out, our partners will disappoint us in their reaction, like Hugo, or even worse they will leave us. So we mute ourselves, avoid talking about them, like Dave and Katie. So one of the couple tries to the their partner happy but themselves don't agree, and eventually that unhappiness will drive them away, like Palek.

If we happen to go to therapist for relationship issue/advice, the therapist's role could be like help us to explain ourselves better to our partners, encourage us to express our unspoken feelings, and sometimes be the moderator to suggest some practice to hold a healthy relationship.

No one is born to know how to have a lasting healthy relationship, so try not to just sit there and let it 'develop' -- it will go nowhere.",1513296000,2,1188,4.62085308056872

Then there's the obsessive insistence on littering the landscape with yet more programmable illogic devices that Carolyn was inflicting on Palek, then telling him to masturbate when he wants sex for any purpose other than population littering.

3187417,4,B000VTHYAE,"The therapist is supposed to tie the characters together, but I don't think she does. The fact that we know about her and her life makes it seems unreal. It's too much of a coincidence that the same therapist knows all of these people, or that all of the characters are tied together. Granted, it makes the drama more doable. But the likelihood that the same therapist sees all of these people, is really not very real. As well, getting any man to a therapy session at all, let alone getting them to talk, is not very common. So the fact that all these guys go to therapy, and talk while they are there, does not seem real either. At the same, time, the therapist does not slant her comments toward the female in session, which is actually quite common if it is a female therapist. Guys talking about their feelings in sessions like these can be really shocking to the males senses. These guys act like they have already been in a few sessions and know the therapist. Near the end of the plot sequence, after all of the sex scenes, the plot seems more real, because they are starting to deal with their problems. In this, we get a more real picture of what real conflict is like. There is give and take. There are real, raw emotions. In that sense, this is rare.

Some of it rings true (I am married with children) but the characters are so unsympathetic and the therapy sessions seem to contain nothing remotely enlightening that it just isn't even entertaining to watch. The casting is almost insulting in its whiteness and the characters are all very stereotypically attractive (except Adam Scott who is admittedly a little less typical looking for Hollywood). The characters also seem unable to be honest with themselves or to be reflective. All the sex? Pointless and stupid and not even interesting to watch (people who have this much sex should at least have some technique!). People who are engaged do not randomly have sex in daylight in parking lots or in apartments they are considering renting. There is no chemistry between the actors and practically no story line that I could determine from 1.5 episodes. And practically the worst part?

There is good in-depth character development hence the 3 stars. It was originally an HBO show but didn't make it to its second season. hmmmm",1480636800,,285,4.5
3187509,2,B000VTHYAE,"I really like HBO programs.  They can be edgy and real and out there, but well done.  This one is not very well done, 'm sorry to say.  The script and directing are very predictable and nothing is good or good enough ever, even when something should be.  These actors have little chemistry and the change of emotions are on a dime.  happy, happy ANGRY....  o.k., o.k., NOT O.K.!  There are a few scenes of sexuality that are meant to feel real, and in some ways they seem to be, but the follow-up conversations and reactions are over the top and ruin what may have been legitimate moments.  I want to feel for these characters, but the only likeable character is the goofy dad guy, but even his scripting is poorly written.  It could be a decent real-life feeling program, but it's not there yet.  To quote another reviewer who wrote it best: ""...got tired of the characters' slow, meandering everyday lives, and the whining. I started thinking the sex scenes were just interfering with the progress of the story,...""",1480636800,2,1017,4.6

3187513,4,B000VTHYAE,"Well written, well acted and well produced.

Along the lines of ""In Treatment,"" ""Tell Me You Love Me"" is a warts-and-all depiction of romantic relationships. I especially appreciated the depiction of a sexually vibrant older couple, and the imperfect love between Dave and Katie, a long-married couple who are plagued by what feels like unwanted celibacy.",1479168000,,355,5.339285714285714

3187517,3,B000VTHYAE,"This series is about three couple, the challenges of relationships, in particular, the challenges that are relative to their sex lives and their interaction with the therapist (Jane Alexander) they are each seeing to understand and resolve these dynamics.  Because the relationship of the therapist and her husband is also included, it is actually about four couples. The episodes dealt with very real situations that can occur in committed relationships. Their issues run a full gamut: Absence of sex in relationship; inability to get pregnant; fear of commitment.  I think I can safely say that it is actually a series of soft porn.  There are alot of very specific sex scenes. Jane Alexander gives a believable performance, as she always does.  Although the basis for the series is realistic, much of the acting of the other people was lackluster and mediocre, The chemistry and acting between Dave and Katie is the most believable and authentic in performance.  In my opinion, Carolyn and Palik do not make sense to be paired as a couple and have little real chemistry to make their performances believable.  Carolyn was the most unlikable of the characters, being very demanding and self-absorbed.",1479168000,4,1202,5.107142857142857

3187624,5,B000VTHYAE,"Unfortunately, I missed this show the first time around.  I am now watching this show on Amazon Prime.  Despite reading several negative reviews, I applaud the show for two reasons.

First, It is ""spot-on"" in its depiction of so many marriages where any passion that may have once existed has long fizzled out; it's only remaining purpose is to masquerade as a ""union"" for the sake of the kids.  The only way they can stand it is by distractions such as ""redoing the patio.""  No wonder ""couples therapy"" is a booming profession today!

Secondly, I applaud the depiction of older couples as sexual beings.  It is high time for stereotyping to end for for those of a certain age.  Older people, just as younger ones, do indeed express their love for each other physically.  Sexual expression of love is not limited by the number of candles on one's birthday cake.  The stereotype of the sexless older person needs to be smashed to bits!  This series does a great job of doing just that!",1470960000,10,984,4.630057803468208

3187729,1,B000VTHYAE,This video is ideal for people with a love of hard-core porn. Love me a video that features lovemaking that shows sincere feeling and maybe EVERYTHING else. This is not it. Found it to be rather depressing actually.  Won't be watching anymore of this series.,1468627200,,258,4.733333333333333

3187736,4,B000VTHYAE,"This show requires a lot of time and patience, but it is as real as it gets in relationship & captures the nuances of non verbal communication between couples, which is hard to do. The casting is excellent & the therapy sessions are well executed. The show is well written overall and it's a real shame/loss it didn't get a 2nd season.",1468540800,,335,4.419354838709677

3187739,2,B000VTHYAE,"I really liked the story lines particularly for the two older couples and the therapist and her husband.  Maybe I'm too old to not just shake my head in dismay at the young girl's story.  But yikes! the sex is everywhere.  I think it's gratuitous and unnecessary...and I am not a prude.  For those looking, there never was a Season Two.",1468540800,,336,4.459016393442623

3187748,5,B000VTHYAE,A great picture of relationships between men and women in all stages of the complicated unhealthiness asking the way.  I think it will appeal more to women than most men; but I think it does a great job of showing both the male and female (hetero only so far) perspective.  The sex scenes are graphic and realistic.  I appreciate the fact that they show older couples.... I'm talking over 60.  You never see that in TV so it shows that people are still sexual even when we're get old!!,1468540800,,485,4.415730337078652
3187749,1,B000VTHYAE,"It is a bunch of couples who have real issues...however; it just came across as a bunch of whiny, self involved couples.  The show seemed to rely heavily on the gratuitous sex scenes to get the stories through. The only time sex was not involved was when the story line focused on the couple who were not having sex and that was their problem. By the time I was done watching the series...I was rooting for all the couples to separate.",1468540800,,435,4.37037037037037
3187750,4,B000VTHYAE,"The series Tell me You Love Me took you on a journey through the very different nuances of people's love lives through different stages of their life whether they were single, dating or married. And the common bond they share through marriage/sex counselor that tries to help them navigate them through the pitfalls of their lives. I did find alot of the story lines very informative, enlighting and entertaining and it's too bad that this series was cancelled.",1468540800,,461,4.923076923076923

3187769,4,B000VTHYAE,"Really like this show, great story line intercepting three couples into one therapists life.  As I move along into the season I have a feeling they will become more intertwined.  This show is more ""sex""y than others, meaning it shows more of the real sex than the hidden scenes behind what appears to be sex, definitely not for kids or even young adults maybe but for mature adults being able to watch these scenes you get more of an emotional attachment to each character with these types of scenes.",1468454400,,500,4.606741573033708

Why do some reviewers complain about the ""slow pace"" and boredom?  My suspicion is that those viewers have no interest in the ordinary lives of ordinary people. And this film is a study of such lives.
The credits reveal that WOMEN were pretty much in charge of this entire production. So... kudos to those ladies!
Jane Alexander as the therapist was excellent.
Michelle Borth and Sonya Walger were both absolutely GORGEOUS, and so very sexy!!  They were also effective as actresses. Ms. Walger had the more demanding role and was awesome.

3187940,3,B000VTHYAE,"I had high hopes about this series, and stuck with it for as long as I could.  Unfortunately with the exception of the therapist (played by Jane Alexander), all of the characters were completely unlikable. The one strength HBO has in almost all of their series (from the charming and lighthearted comedy ""Dream On"" to the violent and edgy ""Game of Thrones"") is their character development. Regardless if the viewers love the character (Martin Tupper) or despise the character (King Joffey) we are invested in the arc of the character. We as viewers continue to view the characters to see what direction they will take us and give us the necessary reaction to ask ""what are they going to do next""?

With ""Tell Me You Love Me"" the characters are not only unlikable, but exhausting, uninteresting and flat. To listen to their tiring minutia about the conflicts they encounter regarding their sex lives makes you want to tell every single one the couples to simply break up and inject a new love interest in their life, for no other reason than to introduce us to new and hopefully more interesting characters. I will admit the sex is quite hot, and somewhat realistic, the way people (who actually WANT to have sex with one another) do have sex. Unfortunately you have the sexual engagement, then they start to talk again, and it all goes downhill from there.

The most interesting parts of the series was with the therapist, and I was hoping the show would go further with that dynamic (and develop more engaging dialogue by the characters). In fact I can see that portion of the show being a prelude to the fantastic HBO series ""In Treatment"". I hated almost everyone in that series, but man was I invested in the patients and their sessions. ""Tell Me You Love Me"" never took me to that place where I said ""can you believe he/she/they said that?"" I had some hope for the younger couple given that at that age you're figuring things out about love, life and relationships in between their multiple sex sessions. They even went as far as to break up and explore relationships with other people.  But once again they open their mouths with trite dialogue, and once again I lose interest. The creators of the show seem to lost in knowing where to go beyond ""let's screw"" followed by ""you don't understand.""  It became emotionally taxing for the viewer to see this endless cycle of conflict with no meaningful progress, let alone resolution.

I guess the one thing that did maintain my interest was as unlikable as the characters were, I enjoyed seeing how much they argue over and over again about the same relationship issues (""why doesn't he want to f*** me any more"", ""his negativity is preventing us from conceiving"", ""you are interested in other women"") where I'm hoping one or more of them will either have a full-blown meltdown, an emotional explosion or engage in such reckless behavior to the point where the meltdown or explosion will occur.  I know that's cynical and mean-spirited to wish on the characters.  But at least that will make them interesting.  And I guess that is what I was hoping for in ""Tell Me You Love Me,"" and why I stuck with it: to have that unexpected ""holy sh*t"" reaction I've been used to in an HBO series.  The show was ambitious, but certainly didn't live up to my expectations.  Purchase or stream it if and when you feel the price is right.",1423440000,6,3374,4.653781512605042

3187974,4,B000VTHYAE,"Though my husband almost ran from the room gagging when the elder characters were getting it on, I found those scenes very tasteful. The actress who played the doctor (forgive me, I don't have the names, so I will refer to them in character) was excellent. Not so excellent was the performance of the actress who played ""Katie""--a young forty-something, uncomfortable with her own sexuality and place in mid-life. She put a lot of crap on her husband. In the end, Katie and Dave's relationship ""works"", although watching some 20 hours of Katie's grimacing/weird facial expressions, was more than enough for me.

Great performance by the actor who played ""Pawlick"". His wife was a major pill--I could hardly stand her. WHY she called him from the doctor's office is beyond me. Good riddance girl, you ARE a lawyer! Dump the loser! The writers didn't do young professional women any service there (trying not to give anything away here).

I liked ""Jamie"". Though a little shallow, I remember the age. Being in our early 20's wasn't easy. I wouldn't want to do it again. Jamie was not hard on the eyes...although the entire season it looked as if she needed her hair washed...maybe her whole body scrubbed down and disinfected after all of those sexual partnters, lol. The chemistry between she and ""Hugo"" (great name) was noted.

Overall, this is a great DVD to kick back and enjoy a glass/bottle of wine with. I'm sorry there wasn't a second season. For those uncomfortable with seeing body parts like testicles, naked women over 55, graphic masturbation, or people urinating on pregnancy test strips, this DVD is probably not for you.",1366934400,,1634,4.870503597122302

3187980,4,B000VTHYAE,"I'll admit I was lured to this show for the sex, the nudity.
It delivered, though thus far I've seen only the pilot episode (Season 1).

In the 80's and 90's, I loved the TV series ""Thirty-Something"", with Patricia Wettig, Ken Olin, Tim Busfield et al.
And during my separation from my wife, and through our divorce (in 1995), I watched that show's re-runs, seeing certain elements of my marriage revisited.

""Tell Me You Love Me"" (the pilot episode) reminds me sooooooooo much of that show!!
It has the cinema verite-style of filming, the always-serious discussions of love, marriage, sex, affairs, the beautiful 30-something (sic!) characters (even if one or two are in their 20's), the drama.

What ""Thirty-Something"" did NOT have was the nudity or graphic sex, even if Michelle Borth says the sex was NOT real!!
Thus, ""Tell Me You Love Me"" seems to be ""Thirty-Something""-Revisited......with sex and nudity added!!

And Jane Alexander, a consummate actress, whose character seems to have a sex life of her own, at 60-plus!!

I definitely will buy the entire first season, and recommend it to anyone who loved that 80's show, or shows like it!!",1348704000,3,1146,4.917098445595855

3187983,5,B000VTHYAE,"I love that this show does not hold back the way people feel in the situations that they're in. Also, I love this show's vision as it breaks the fairytale life that people grow up thinking marriage is. It's not going to be rainbows and sunlight all the time. There will be hardships along the way and you need to communicate with each other or all is lost, but even then it might not work out, which is why I loved this show. All 3 (technically 4) couples represent a stage in the development of a ""Relationship"". The engaged couple, the 1-2yr married couple, the 12 year married couple w/kids (oy), and the silver-haired old couple. Each with their own real problems that can come up in our very own relationships that we have. You watch this show wanting to know what comes next but at the same time not wanting to see what happens because you care for these people. There people are REAL to you.

You can't bare to see what happens to them Maybe it's because you can totally relate to one of them cause you're afraid. Maybe you were that person and you're seeing yourself being played out on TV and it's sorta embarrassing. Maybe you want to know what ""would"" have happened if you did take that coarse of action, well.. you see it play out here. It also gets you talking and discussing with people why the person did what they did, would your spouse/significant other really spazz out if they were put in that position, etc. Amazing show, the cast is great. Recommnded for anyone who wants to see a great REAL show about relationships and inadvertently make your own stronger, this is it.",1321574400,3,1591,4.4673539518900345
3187984,5,B000VTHYAE,"I bought this about a year back and watched episodes 1-9 in a marathon. I got about 20 minutes into the final 10th episode, and knowing it was going to be over for good, I could not complete it, because I didn't want it to be over. I recently just did.

Tell Me You Love Me revolves around three couples, Jamie and Hugo (Borth and Kirby), Katie and David (Walker and DeKay) and Carolyn and Palek (Walger and Scott), each with their own problems concerning intimacy in their relationships. They seek the help of therapist May Foster, who herself has relationship issues with her partner Arthur (Selby). [from Wiki]

The amount of true, honest character studies in this show is immense. Mind you I'm 21, and am a Psychology Major who has taken 12 Psych related courses over about 3 semesters, including a dirty but enlightening Human Sexuality course in 2009.

This is where careers were started for many of today's more popular stars. Go on back to filming in 2007-2008 and no one had probably heard of the following people:

Michelle Borth as Jaime, currently portraying Dr. Rebecca Gordon on ABC's ""Combat Hospital.""
Tim DeKay did some fine work as David, the frustrated dad; currently known as Peter Burke on USA's ""White Collar.""
Adam Scott as Palek, currently known for his role as Ben on NBC's ""Parks and Rec.""
Sonya Walger as Carolyn, also known for Penny from ABC's ""Lost."" Boy, was I lost at that ending. Who wasn't?
Ally Walker as Katie, best known earlier as the cute detective on ""Profiler"" in the mid 1990s. Currently in Lifetime series ""The Protector."" I knew I recognized her face elsewhere!

et al.

The show caused people to be ""up in arms"" about the very real depiction of sex. For those who think it was real; you're sadly mistaken. The Actor's Union does not; and will not allow for actual sex (i.e. penetration, adult ""actress"" style) on camera. It was simulated very well and filmed with a touch of brilliant lighting and camera work to make you think they were having sex. Michelle Borth was the most featured here, and she has said: ""Yeah, we can't do it for real. It's simulated.""

My guess is they were wearing certain things to protect themselves and the ""believe it at face value"" minds, like a ""patch"" over that area and maybe a ""sock"" over his.

With that said, Dr. Cynthia Mort (creator, executive producer, writer, etc) as a future doctor myself (a few years away), I really don't see why they canceled your brilliant, honest, and true show. It firmly stands as the pinnacle of truth for any couple in any relationship. Like some, I would've loved a second season.",1314316800,6,2595,4.663019693654267

The acting is off the charts good, as is the writing.  The sex scenes are explicit, but if you're looking for incredibly hot sex scenes, look elsewhere because it isn't about that.

The show aired on HBO - not surprising given some of the graphic sex scenes.  But also not surprising that there was no second series despite great potential. Although the topics explored are highly relevant and important, some of the scenes are laughable and make a mockery of what should be very emotional to the viewers.

The premise -> we are watching the lives of essentially 4 couples varying so differently in age (20s-30s-40s-50s) that the show is NOT targeted to any group in particular.  So you just jump from one couple to another couple when you find their scene painfully boring.  You crave some action.

3187997,4,B000VTHYAE,"I snagged this after one of the creators of ""Spartacus Blood & Sand"" listed this series as one of his favorite and said the somewhat graphic sex scenes were 'ground breaking'.

'Tell Me You Love Me' was sort of like the R-rated version of ""Thirtysomething"", lots of whining and a smattering of humping. It's the story of three couples (actually two couples and one extra whiny Hipster twit) who go and see Jane Alexander's relationship therapist.

One couple is decidely Yuppiesh -- they live in a swank architecturally daring house that looks like it cost millions and Sonya Walger's lawyer wife is extra manipulative to her effeminate, dead boring husband, played vapidly by Adam Scott (and his floppy hair).

The second is a skinny grasping young saute chef played by Michelle Borth and is probably THE most annoying character. She's in a twist because her fiance admitted he didn't see himself being faithful to her for all eternity when they tie the knot. She retaliates by dumping him, humping a couple of different guys (including 'Lost's' Ian Somerhandler) and then going to Jane Alexander's therapist who promptly detects that the gal has never been faithful to any of her lovers.

Personally, I didn't give two figs for the Yuppie couple or the Hipster and her problems. The meatiest plot and characters were reserved for Tim DeKay and Ally Walker as the Old Married Fuds, David and Katie. They're both excellent parents, devoted to their kids, furiously busy homemakers (there's a lot of renovating) ... and they're terrible lovers, sensually completely lost to each other and 'in a lot of pain' as Alexander's therapist aptly puts it. This couple seemed the most believable probably because they're the most flawed. Walker's Katie has a big problem. She's can't bring herself to masturbate and she's terrified her husband knows. Seeing as how self-gratification is the first stop on the orgasm bus, Katie's in trouble. In the finale ep, when David and Katie find each other again sexually there's a lot of good acting and it's appropriately steamy. The Married Fuds were the couple I really cheered for.",1278460800,,2115,4.966101694915254

3188002,3,B000VTHYAE,"It is said that the suggestion of violence can be more powerful than the image of violence. The same can be said for sex. The director's habit of exploring the fine details of an actor's anatomy generally establishes nothing about the characters or the relationship between the characters, with a couple of important exceptions. Once it's established that the characters are having sex, there's no need to observe the mechanics, especially when it comes at the expense of observing the impact of the act. I found myself fast-forwarding through the sex scenes, because in general they were long, tedious, artless and irrelevant. It's rather like spending two minutes watching a scene of someone silently eating a plate of spaghetti, with closeups on their fork, plate and mouth. The point of it is what exactly? That said, the performances in this show are phenomenal. The pain and dysfunction on display is raw and honest, but nevertheless it is deeply affecting to watch the characters in the show struggle against their own imperfections for the sake of their spouse. I winced, laughed and pondered as I saw many a moment from my own marriage portrayed in each episode.

3188005,2,B000VTHYAE,"This series of 10 episodes ran on HBO a couple of years ago. It was supposed to continue but never did. After viewing this first and only season, I can understand why. The series began with great promise but ultimately petered out. It lacked characters compelling enough to want to follow and plot lines strong enough to sustain more episodes.
I guess it will ultimately be remembered most for the very gratuitous sex which occasionally borders on the pornographic. One of the achievements of the series is to portray how sex can be used to cover up problems or compensate for them -- but how its absence too can be so terribly destructive to a relationship. Ultimately, I got tired of the sex. Characters were forever throwing off some or all of their clothes to indulge in briefing panting, grunting bouts like animals coupling in the woods. It got to be unsavory and ultimately boring.
The series circles around three couples and their therapist played by Jane Alexander, who with her husband and former lover forms a fourth menage. I was struck by how useless she was as a therapist. For her banal observations I certainly would not shell out $110 an hour.
Couple one, Dave and Katie, live a middleclass life with two kids in the suburbs and seem happy -- except that they haven't made love in a year. Dave prefers quiet masturbation. It's not clear why. Is there a reason, other than the fact that the scriptwriters decided it should be so?
Couple two, Carolyn and Pallack (not sure of the spelling) are rich and successful and self-absorbed. She wants a baby but can't get pregnant. Couple three are Jamie and Hugo, 20-somethings about to get married. They split up when Hugo can't verbally commit to remain faithful for the rest of his life. Jamie falls straight into bed with Nick.
None of these people was tremendously compelling or interesting. None of them seem to have much of an intellectual life. They don't appear to read or listen to music or attend the theater. It's all work and screwing.
The series sells the view that being and staying married is tremendously difficult. Is it so difficult? Many of us manage just fine.
The real problem with this series, as compared to other HBO offerings that I have so admired such as ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Wire"" is that those dramas were packed full of memorable characters bursting with life, while the characters in ""Tell Me You Love Me"" seem to be sleepwalking through life.",1242086400,,2436,4.707259953161593

I have to admit that, as a clinician myself, I'll watch most anything that has a mental health angle in it. Typically, they never get the therapy (or the therapist) done right, at least for more than a fleeting moment. This show is no exception. The premise is interesting: several couples is a mid-size metropolis are seeing the same shrink, and we see them both during therapy and in their 'real' lives. The shrink, too, has her own life outside the office, and we (the audience) are a busy fly on many walls as we follow them all around each episode. We hear the outlines of their problems in therapy, and we go deeper when we are with them outside, comparing the two evolving versions & seeing where the truth comes up a little short, and where they are copping out. In one sense, we are used to this device as it was used religiously (and very effectively) in the Sopranos. So we see a bit of the sociopathy of everyday life, to coin a phrase; or, maybe just an honest look at the flaws of human characters.

You can see where this mid-western novella is going to go--it's a small town and their paths are going to cross, eventually, and realize they are all therapy sibs. But, we only got a hint of that by the end of season one. Too bad--I thought there were going to be some pyrotechnics when all those fuses started to catch.....but....oh well! I guess the producers were pretty confident about getting a second go round.

Along the way, we flies are witness to the most raw, naturalistic sex scenes that I have ever seen on TV/cable. That is not to say it is sexy stuff--it is pretty unpolished & non-stylized. You see all the anatomy, somewhat obliquely and in natural low light conditions, but nothing is left to the imagination. The only thing I was wondering was, are those prosthetic phalli or the real thing? And the sex scenes tend to drag on, and there is no pretense here to make the trysts hot, sexy, kinky--they are just pretty run of the mill, daily grind kind of stuff. Some highlights you ask? Well, we get to see the husband in the sexless marriage treat himself to some solo satisfaction--and boy was I sorry I watched that scene! And, for the geriatric set--there is included a pretty raw scene with Jane Alexander and her husband getting it on in a recliner. There was one reviewer who said how great she looked in this scene--well, I would say that with her clothes on she is indeed a classy, elegant grand dame. But, nude and vigorously humping? Please, this was not sexy and not entertaining. Good commercial for Viagara, but that is about it. In fact, whenever there is a sex scene one feels as if it is very private and this is the time to go fix a sandwich or shut off the sprinklers, rather than do so at the commercial. It is a rather interesting artistic achievement, to say the least.

Here is the BIG problem with this show, as I see it: none of the characters are likeable. None. Not one. Their stories are somewhat interesting, but you cannot develop a liking for any of the people. Most of them are professional class, and they are all whiners, wimps, phonies, narcissists, sex-addicts, or anhedonic icebergs. Or some combination of the above. They are SO bland and/or neurotic that you don't want to spend an hour a week with them, not a one of them. Oh, and don't you be looking for any persons of color in this show--unless you count different hair colors as evidence of diversity. It's all Oscar Meyer on Wonder Bread with mayo on a paper plate. A plain, white paper plate.... There is no diversity among the characters, between the character, or within the characters. Imagine 'All in the Family' and every character is an insipid, vacuous version of Archie Bunker. Guys like us we had it made....

Even in the Sopranos, you could develop a liking for those greedy psychopathic killers and their various sycophantic partners--THAT was part of the incredible achievement of that show. To make you forget that these Jersey guys with the SUVs who are wolfing down franks at a bbq are stone-cold killers, and they are just regular folks with mortgages, PTA meetings, mid-life crises, etc. And--you identify just a little with the lure of the larceny and of getting away with it....But here? You wouldn't want to share a cup of joe with any of these people. This to me is the main crisis, as a viewer.

Another main weakness, ironically, is the whole therapy device. I thought Jane Alexander was earnest in the anchoring central role as the therapist, but she was stuck with some of the lamest therapist dialogue yet concocted for a TV show. And, we are dropping in at the moment when her big book is being released, so we are led to believe she is really some kind of expert, but I found her verbal interventions wordy, trite, unrealistic, patronizing, and untherapeutic. But, she was earnest and sincere, for what that is worth: the cases move along more or less disastrously for each of the couples. Nice work! This tendency to romantic decline includes Jane's own marriage, imperiled by the mid-season revelation of a past affair, which threatens to resume when her ex-lover just happens to turn up in this ever-shrinking cesspool of a town.

So, while I stuck it out for the entire season, I was ready to bail about a third of the way through, but my gal and I were committed to seeing it through. Probably the most interesting aspect was that the producers attached about 5-6 minutes onto the end of each episode that featured real life couples who were watching and commenting on the show's progress and how it sort-of mirrored their own struggles. Now, these people WERE very likeable and interesting, more so than the actual cast. That was another problem with the show, as far as I was concerned. And, similarly, the show did spark good discussions between my partner and I. So, in the end, it was a case of life imitating life that was imitating art that bore no resemblance at all to life, at least any life you would want to be living.

Well, I guess maybe see it for yourself and decide, but if you are not into it by the 3rd show, it ain't getting any better!",1222041600,52,6161,4.564195298372513
3188011,5,B000VTHYAE,"I wish, sometimes, that the general populace of this United States were not so screwed up when it comes to sex.  However, this is not the case and as a result of this slack-jawed, priggish mindset, the rest of us are robbed of one of the most intelligent, insightful programs this viewer has seen in some time.

Cynthia Mort has depicted a laser focused and thoughtful portrayal of intimacy in ""Tell Me You Love Me"".  She has stripped the inner workings of an intimate, sexual relationship bare with four couples in different stages of their lives.  The effect is at once disturbing, hilarious, frightful, and hopeful as these adjectives are really the bones of any relationship.  This is a series every person involved in an intimate, sexual relationship should watch more than once.

The cast is brilliant, if not to mention, courageous. Michelle Borth (who knew she was more than just a femme du jour?) and Luke Kirby portray the ""new loves"" preparing for their wedding day. Sonya Walger (Mort shows her genius in recognizing this woman's talent) and Adam Scott play a childless couple struggling for a baby. Ally Walker, of ""Profiler"" fame (too long away from the view of the masses) and Tim DeKay of ""Carnivale"" are the married-for-years-with-kids scenario.  Jane Alexander (formidable!) and David Selby (a far cry from  ""Dark Shadows'"" Quentin Collins) play and older, mature couple.  All of these actors bring precise candor to their portrayals provoking intense reactions from the watcher.

As you find yourself muttering under your breath, ""You bitch!"" or ""You bastard!"" you ultimately realize that you would be the ultimate hypocrite to even attempt to choose sides.

And, yes, they all have sex.  It would be silly to present a discourse on intimacy in sexual relationships without the act of sex.  So, get over it and watch this show!",1216339200,6,1846,4.954545454545454

8219909,3,B000VTHYAE,"Having American television/film grow up finally and not be afraid of sex is a breakthrough.  Americans somewhat perversely and sadly can stomach violence more easily than sex.  That being said, some of the sex scenes worked, were organic and illustrative of emotional undercurrents, and some seemed gratuitous and protracted.  My major complaint is that I ultimately didn't really care that much about any of the characters; in fact because of their lack of insight, empowerment, and inability to communicate, I became rather annoyed and actually skipped a few episodes to avoid the tedium.  Granted their problems are common garden variety that most couples face, but ultimately they are all self-induced and rather puny and parochial; not like facing death or war or illness.  I also think the direction and cinematography and pacing kept me distanced.  How I could have used some sharper writing (inability to speak does not necessarily mean deeper turmoil and understanding) and some humor/wit (which is far more reflective of intelligence).  In the end, series seemed too naval gazing and indulgent, very anemic Bergman or Paul Thomas Anderson.",1518998400,,1149,5.314917127071824

It was a honest portrayal of real life issues in relationships, just drawn out with nothing really happening.
