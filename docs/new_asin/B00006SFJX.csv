1792686,5,B00006SFJX,"My family stumbled across this movie several years ago, purely by accident.  Luckily, my uncle had the foresight to hit record on the VCR.  Since then, we have probably made 20 dubs off of that tape as we continue to wearout tape after tape!  No matter how hard we searched, all attempts to obtain an original copy have always come up short--until now!
""J-Men Forever"" is the definitive screwball comedy!  The guys from Firesign Theatre splice together old cliffhangers and their comedic dialogue to make a comedy that is truly unbelieveable.
If you don't find yourself quoting the Caped Madman or Rocket Jock after watching this movie, you must have fallen asleep.",1034899200,6,665,4.910714285714286

1792741,4,B00006SFJX,I think that this mainly geared for an older age that has retained his sense of humor.  It features old serial characters splice together in a very funny context.  I thought it was great; I am sure that a youth might just scratch their heads and wonder what's going on.,1395014400,,269,4.36
1792742,5,B00006SFJX,J-men Forever What a movie. Has everybody from Flash Gordon to Captain America. Even Lenord Nimoy before he was Mr. Spock,1394496000,,121,4.809523809523809
1792743,5,B00006SFJX,"I was so happy to find this on DVD.  Was one of those people that wore out a bootleg VHS.  Loved Firesign since I was a kid, and Bergman's J-Men Forever is a perfect compliment to any Firesign Theater collection.",1379203200,2,212,4.275
1792744,5,B00006SFJX,"I saw this movie in the 80's on the USA network's Night Flight and I loved it, and when I saw the DVD it was a must have, if you like MST3k you will like the humor throughout this whole movie",1364169600,,191,3.682926829268293
1792745,5,B00006SFJX,The item was received on time and as described. It was packed for shipment in a careful and protective manner. I recommend this vendor.,1351036800,,135,4.666666666666667
1792746,4,B00006SFJX,"...but when I saw this on the USA Network in the 1980s, I was curled up in a ball on the floor laughing so hard I couldn't see or breathe.  When I saw some of it again many years later I couldn't see why I thought it was so funny - it just seemed inane - but maybe part of the humor was due to coming upon the movie completely cold; no idea what it was, who it was by, or anything.  Also, this was early enough that I realized that I was seeing old movie serials dubbed with new dialog, strung together with new bits into a semi-sensible narrative; a running gag is that in order for that narrative (such as it is) to make any sense at all, our ""team"" of heroes (actually not a team at all...the films used are from completely different serials) are battling a single villain (actually several...likewise) who simply uses a string of different disguises from scene to scene.",1339459200,,874,4.259036144578313
1792767,5,B00006SFJX,"We originally had this movie pirated from a late-night TV program on VHS. It is great to see it on DVD format, and the movie is still as funny and quirky as ever.",1305590400,,162,3.9393939393939394
1792768,5,B00006SFJX,"Man, This is so good, I thought they had beat MST 3k to it. NNNot. Still dammed funny. Loved the thing about the bitch being made horny by the dorks! Biggus Jimmus",1288224000,,163,4.125
1792769,5,B00006SFJX,"For those who remember this Night Flight classic, this is a long overdue treasure. For those who have never seen it, get ready for a  very funny movie done in the style of Woody Allen's (back in the 60's when he was just funny) ""Whats Up Tiger Lilly"". An overlooked comedy made by some members of the Firesign Theater, this is in my top ten list of favorite comedies of all time.",1262131200,,379,4.263888888888889
1792770,2,B00006SFJX,"What do you get when half of The Firesign Theater cross the videos from a bunch of Republic Films cliffhanger movies with a campy, sarcastic soundtrack involving denizens of the Moon invading Earth with Rock and Roll and cannabis?

A surprisingly boring 75 minutes.

Never mind that Philip Proctor and Peter Bergman wrote the script and star in the production.  They're not even on stage for more than 10 minutes.  Never mind that the DVD cover suggests this is Reefer Madness on steroids.  The drug angle doesn't even show up until 40 minutes into the video.

I gave this a 2 star simply because I loved seeing those Republic Film shows on TV in the 1950's.  However, what Bergman and Proctor add to this is really lame.  I guess if you got hit with a 'hash bomb' from the DVD, it might scramble your senses enough to think there was something funny here.

You'd do far better by listening to the Nick Danger segment of 'How Can You be in Two Places at Once When You're Not Anywhere at All"" or Steve Martin's underrated ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid"" if you want a funny send up of classic films of the '30's and '40's.",1255564800,3,1117,4.436274509803922
1792771,5,B00006SFJX,"If I could have been involved in the making of a movie, right after GWTW, this would be next. The facetious premise is that Rock and Roll is evil, and it is so evil and deadly, that by blasting Smaltzy Music with large doses of Rock and Roll from the moon, Smaltzy Music, along with others on earth will be destroyed, or at least driven crazy. Commando Cody fights the moon men who are trying to destroy him with a ray gun. When I was a kid it was my good fortune to see many Republic Cliffhanger serials before the main feature at the town cinema. J-Men forever is made of clips from these serials and new words have been overdubbed into the rather convoluted, but wonderful story. Sometimes the voices are appropriate for the faces they are coming out of and sometimes they are not. This adds to the hilarity. J-Men is chock full of gay banter, rapid reparte, gifted gabbiness, heartfelt harangues,  and zesty zingers. It is a gold mine of trite expressions, double entendres, euphemisms and non sequiturs. A boon to the complicated overdubbing is the fact that the speaking players often have their backs to the camera, have on bulky masks, or are shot from a distant camera range. What really ""sends me"" is the plethora of special effects these old serials had including, space ships, deadly ray guns and robots. Some of the dialogue includes, ""you send me, the caped mad man had a statue made to honor himself against his will,"" and my favorite, ""wait in the damn hall!"" Who of us has not had to deal with an obnoxious person that we would like to simply tell with authority to ""wait in the damn hall!"" This movie is about creativity and I have deepest admiration to the crew that masterminded and produced this wonderful flick. Contrary to popular opinion, you would not have to be stoned to enjoy it--you just have to be an artiste.",1249257600,3,1839,4.539156626506024
1792772,5,B00006SFJX,"I've been enjoying this movie since the old NightFlight days. I remember the serials from when I was a small-fry and love the way they've been integrated into a tale only Firesign could add their with their twist.
My two boys grew up watching this, and wanted a copy for their very own. How could I refuse? We never get tired of it.",1184976000,,332,4.285714285714286
1792773,5,B00006SFJX,"When this first came out, I taped it off the TV and wore the tape out. Then I taped it again. And I wore THAT tape out. That was 20 years ago.  Now it's available on DVD as I've just discovered. In short, Best. Movie. Parody. Ever. The use of the old Republic serials (Commander Cody and others) is BRILLIANT! It's MST3K meets What's Up, Tiger Lily.",1172448000,,349,4.208955223880597
1792774,4,B00006SFJX,"This is one of the absolute funniest movies that I've ever seen in my life.  The only negative that I can think of about this movie is the fact that this movie is in black and white.  Black and white movies are okay, but I personally prefer to watch colour or colourized movies.  I love this movie.  This is the type or kind of movie that I'll watch repeatedly.  Get yourself a great big tall glass of your favorite beverage, get a big bag of popcorn, roll yourself up a big ol' fat joint and sit back and watch an absolute classic cult film that will never get old.",1169078400,2,566,4.155963302752293
1792775,4,B00006SFJX,"Since I grew up with USA's night flight, I loved this movie then and I find I love it now! You either love or hate this Firesign Theater take on Woddy Allen's What's Up Tiger Lilly. A fun romp that is not for children or those offended by drug humor. This is a classic B-rated-on-purpose cult film that should be in every cult film enthusiasts library!",1168819200,3,352,4.348484848484849
1792776,5,B00006SFJX,"Argueably the funniest movie ever made. Bits and pieces of 40's serials spliced together with Machine Gun Kelley voicing the insanely comic villain ""Lightning Bug"" (""you dug? I mean dig?""). Where to begin? I had no idea Captain Marvel machine-gunned people in the back as they ran away, or threw guys off of rooftops. Captain America looks pretty absurd in his woolen long-johns and riding a motorcycle through the desert. And the names: ""Jam Armhole"", ""Sleeve Coat"", and ""Juicy Withers"", just for starters. It has the frantic energy and layered esoteric references and fabulous wordplay of the Firesign Theater boys, but Kelly really steals the movie with his wild threats and demented ""Hahahahaha!!!!"" I think you could easily watch this a dozen times and STILL not catch everything going on - the first 2-3 times you'll just be laughing too hard. Do yourself a favor, 4-ears, and pick this one up before the Supreme Court decides you don't have a right to be amused.",1147392000,18,969,4.914634146341464
1792797,4,B00006SFJX,"The late night ""you wouldn't believe this crazy move I just saw on Night Flight"" flick J-Men Forever hits DVD. Considering such classic as Star Wars aren't out yet, but here we have one of the most obscure and least likely films on DVD. I expect its reediting and overdubbed of Republic serials (Captain Marvel, Captain America, Commando Cody, etc) will appeal to the Mystery Science Theater crowd as there are a lot of common elements and it's a very outrageous and funny send up of those 1940's serials, some of which have appeared on MST3K.",1132704000,8,543,4.666666666666667
1792798,5,B00006SFJX,"This movie is one of the best ever movies i have seen on latenight TV. had 2 recordings of it and both were defeated in the same week 4 years ago. Like the rest of you I have searched for the elusive J-Men ever since and am over joyed that my holidays will be filled with J-Men cheer. ""what do you think of this? looks like a bad case of the crabs boss.. HAHAHAHAHA thats not funny.",1069804800,4,382,3.9740259740259742
1792799,5,B00006SFJX,"It's time to retire that fuzzy, 20-year-old beta-max tape you pirated off of ""Night Flight"" (remember when USA Network was actually a HIP cable channel?)- a true buried treasure has turned up on DVD! Woody Allen may have done it first (""What's Up, Tiger Lily?"") and the writers behind ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" may have run the concept into the ground, but Phil Proctor and Peter Bergman did it best with ""J-Men Forever"". The concept of taking footage of old, corny and/or low budget films and re-dubbing new dialog is certainly not a new idea, but in the hands of Firesign Theater veterans Proctor & Bergman, it becomes a comedic art form of the highest (er-so to speak...) order! The creators obviously had a sizable archive from the old Republic serials to dip into; unlike Woody Allen's ""Lily"" they were not restricted by the original ebb and flow of one individual film. As a result, ""J-Men"" benefits from a quick-cut style that keeps perfect time with the rapid-fire one-liners, double entendres and high-energy rock music soundtrack. Above all, there is the outstanding writing, which ranks up there with the Firesign Theater's best moments of inventive comedic anarchy. It is interesting to note that the film preceded (and undoubtedly inspired) Carl Reiner and Steve Martins's higher-profile, mainstream offering ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid"" by a year or two. Fans of irreverent (but smart) comedy will not want to miss this one.",1061942400,10,1442,5.0125
1792800,5,B00006SFJX,"That music made me so horny even those three geeks look good. A little lower and I'd be the caped mad-woman. Ahhh! Rubber spider venom! Lood at your boobs, now look at me. He was following me closely, I pretended not to notice. Owww! My knee! These are a few of the lines that my husband and I have been getting strange looks for ever since taping this off of Night Flight back in the 80s. Now maybe someone else will finally know what I'm talking about when I affectionatly call my husband Yank Smellfinger. If people keep telling you that you have a weird sense of humor and you find yourself laughing while others around you are looking confused, YOU MUST see this movie!!",1055980800,5,675,4.408
1792801,5,B00006SFJX,"I've been looking for this movie for over a decade.  At long last it's here, and on DVD of all things.  It still has the charm of the hisses and scratches from the original film clips, and of course the same corny jokes as always.  There aren't any extras to speak of, just an interview with the original Commando Cody which is interesting in a ""why was that included?"" kind of way, and a not-so-amusing chat with the creators of the movie.  But J-Men fans won't mind, since the movie is the real gem anyway.",1052092800,2,508,4.315789473684211
1792802,5,B00006SFJX,"My wife and I loved this movie when it was on USA's Night Flight. We managed to record it but that recording was getting pretty worn out. We've been making a list of all the clips we've found in their original movies. This DVD has some nice extras including an interview with Commando Cody, aka George Wallace.",1048204800,6,310,4.456140350877193
1792803,5,B00006SFJX,"""They often call me Speedo but my real name is the Lightning Bug"".............. ""Touch your head""....."" You bomb the snatch.."" ""Huh?"" ...""I mean snatch the bomb""......
Yes, these phrases DO mean something, but not until you've seen J-Men. Proctor and Bergman did an outstanding job developing original dialog to fit the screen clips they used to create a totally new context for the old serial movies from Republic Pictures and others. Even though this is a 24 year old effort the humor is just as sharp and witty today. The soundtrack would now be considered retro, but the entire concept of conquering the Earth with Rock and Roll music makes you wish the Lightning Bug would've won. I managed to tape one of the ""Night Flight"" showings and I'm looking forward to the DVD.
My kids know this movie as well as I do, and I've even adopted my email address from it. BUY THIS AND GET A BOX OF DEPENDS - you'll need 'em from laughing so hard.",1048204800,4,938,4.556213017751479
1792804,5,B00006SFJX,"Folks, you cannot imagine how long I have waited for this to be released.  If you have no clue about J-Men Forever, take all the movie serials from the 30's and 40's, jumble them together and add voice-overs creating a whole new story which makes Woddy Allen's What's Up, Tiger Lily? look like .... Great 70's rock music backup this great story of the Lightning Bug who resides on the moon, trying to take over the Earth with Rock-N-Roll and pot.  There are so many quotable lines in this movie, it will change your life. Maybe....

1792805,5,B00006SFJX,"Like most fans of this movie, I saw it several times in the 80's on the USA Network's ""Night Flight"" show, but somehow never had the foresight to tape it.  When I found that it was to be released on DVD, I was delighted, but a little apprehensive.  After all, it had been at least 15 years since I'd seen the film, and I was a bit afraid that it had lost it's humor in all that time.
Well, my fears were unfounded, both my wife (who'd never seen the film) and I have watched the new DVD several times, and found it to still be laugh out loud hysterical.  This is a very welcome release, well worth the wait, and as funny as you remember it.",1038873600,16,640,4.0236220472440944
