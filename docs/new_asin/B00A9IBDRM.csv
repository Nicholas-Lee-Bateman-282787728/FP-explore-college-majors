8548737,5,B00A9IBDRM,The True-Life Adventures series by Walt Disney are a must own!  Nobody puts together a story about animals better.  This was one of the few in this series that was actually affordable (for me).  Most of them are way over priced - in my opinion - but if I can ever afford them I may still by them...they are THAT good!,1358985600,,317,4.163934426229508
