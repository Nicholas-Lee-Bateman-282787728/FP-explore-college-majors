8482039,5,B005OUE9F8,"Funny, sharply satiric documentary about the modern art world, especially that of the street/graffiti artists who now command hundreds of thousands
for their work.

The film started out as a documentary about street artists like Banksy, being made by a very eccentric unknown amateur French film-maker, without much obvious talent. But somewhere along the way, the tables turned, and Banksy took over and made the film about the film-maker, who himself finds success (still not showing much talent) as a street artist.

Endearingly weird, perhaps partly a set-up or a put on (who could know?) this is almost like an Andy Kaufman performance piece.

But along with the laughs, it has something serious to say about ""what is art"" and the awful interaction between art and commerce that can drain all the art from ""art"".",1447113600,,817,5.037037037037037
8482040,1,B005OUE9F8,"Not sure how to respond here -- it arrived and could not be played ""in my region"" so I guess buyer beware is the best review.  Be careful in trusting Amazon oversight to shady groups.",1369699200,,183,4.228571428571429
