8144357,5,B000I8OFKK,"Definitely superior to the other ""Manon"" I own (the one with Nathalie Dessay and Juan Diego Florez).  This one follows the plot without adding any trashy re-interpretation from the stage director.",1405296000,2,196,5.32258064516129
8144358,5,B000I8OFKK,"This 1983 live performance was not a compilation of several performances put together, but a single take.
Reviewers may complain of the cuts made, but it does not hurt the plot a single bit - the ballets, etc. are for French grand operas, for sure, but NOT one single DVD production offers the full version, so really no reason to complain against THIS one!
The sets and costumes by Ponnelle are truly reflective of the 'grand style'.  Plus the fact that the two lead characters are portrayed by top singers in their absolute prime - both Gruberova and Araiza weren't even 35 years old at the time of this performance, makes this production the most convincing both dramatically and musically.
The conducting of Fischer is good - he makes the music come alive, much more so than the MET version of last year.
The singers, however, are the real gems. Surely, with a cut version, the focus becomes entirely on Manon and her Chevalier Des Grieux.  Lescaut and Guillot are both side-lined, so is Bretigny, but who cares for these minor characters in a pre-dominantly romantic work such as Massenet's Manon?
Back to the leads - for a long time, Manon is a very popular opera.  Divas rushed to sing this role: de Los Angeles, Sills, Fleming, Dessay, Netrebko...One DVD, however, there is really but ONE Manon, and that is Edita Gruberova.
Gruberova, at the height of her powers, looks the part, sings the part, acts the part to utter perfection. Plus the fabulous costumes by Ponnelle, her presence on stage becomes an individual event in each single scene; and she sings so well that each time she opens her mouth, it is an operatic phenomenon.  She is far better in this Massenet role than even her Mozart roles, in which she isn't really able to surpass the likes of Lucia Popp, Arleen Auger and Gundula Janowitz, but to name only three.
It doesn't need any seasoned opera watcher to discern how much more finesse is being brought to the role by Gruberova than the modern stars like Dessay and Netrebko.  Dessay's outing was did, alas, far too late, and she hardly looks the part.  Netrebko never owned the requisite coloratura technique required of this role.  Fleming looks stunning, but the timbre is too mature for a 16 year old.
As the 17 year old Chevalier Des Grieux, Francisco Araiza has the bonus of an ultra innocent and gentee look, and he sings the part well, too. Vocally his mellifluous and ardent singing is a perfect match for the top-flight Gruberova, and his Act 2 and Act 3 great duets are dramatically even more convincing than Gruberova. The last Act also sees his Des Grieux in the noblest demeanour.
There really is no need to present this great romantic masterpiece in any pornographic manner.
This vintage production deserves more than 10 stars.",1352592000,6,2767,4.728215767634855
8144359,4,B000I8OFKK,"This is an excellent performance by the Vienna State Opera with soprano Edita Gruberova as Manon.  Gruberova not only excels in the dazzling coloratura parts, but also in the subtle melodic arias.  Her acting as well as that of the tenor Araiza are first rate as is the orchestration.  The two principals are not native French speakers but diction is accurate and clear.  Visual and sound quality are quite good.",1313884800,3,412,4.8428571428571425
8144360,3,B000I8OFKK,"be warned: this performance is heavily cut...almost every act has a HUGE chunk taken out of it.  I was glad I had checked this out from the library to preview before buying it.  Tons of act 3 and 4 especially are cut.  All of Manon is great music, so this was just really disappointing.  I can tolerate a few cuts, but this...

I give it three stars anyway because Gruberova and Araiza are really good and the production is visually stunning in the old grand manner.

By all means get this if you are a fan of these singers, but if you are a fan of this opera you will be appalled by the cuts.",1206489600,18,593,4.113043478260869
8144361,4,B000I8OFKK,"I bought this on the strength of the recommendations here, and on previous experience with Francisco Araiza and Edita Gruberova and it was defintely worth it.

The staging is very traditional and a bit stagy looking, but not distracting. The orchestra is wonderful, albeit too loud in some passages- especially the harp! I never thought I'd ever say a harp was too loud, but it's obviously over-mic'd. The singers sing very well, even the supporting roles are well done. Gruberova handles all of the coloratura with ease. She also has a great pianissimo. Her acting is good and she TOTALLY looks the part- but some of the stage directions are distracting. I'm guessing this is the director's fault. Being a singer myself I realize that they have to sing facing the audience, but some of the angles were strange looking. But the main kudo (and from watching the ovation the audience there agreed with me) is Araiza. While Manon is traditionally a soprano's opera, the role of Des Grieux is a difficult one, with a high tessitura and that can very tiring to the voice. Plus to do it well, requires a singer with the ability to act, which Araiza can. His is a standout performance, and like Gruberova, he looks the part. She looks simply ravishing, like Manon should be and he is handsome and gallant like Chevalier Des Grieux should be (but they so seldom are). Once again, there does seem to be some disturbing (at least to me) stage movements that do not seem to fit- but then one has to do what the director tells them to.

Overall, this is a wonderful rendition with very good singing & acting. Oh, and one of the best parts- TERRIFIC costumes!!! Sincerely, very glamorous and befitting. This one's a keeper.",1195948800,14,1710,4.677740863787376
8144362,5,B000I8OFKK,I will not add anything to the former reviewer. It doesn't get any better. Buy it!!!!!,1183334400,10,86,4.4375
8144363,5,B000I8OFKK,"It was an unfogettable evening at the Vienna State Opera and more than 20 years later you can still feel it. Just look who is there: Production is by Jeane-Pierre Ponnelle: Edita Gruberova is Manon: Francisco Araiza - Des Grieux: Adam Fisher is conducting. Can't be better.

This performance takes you in from the first moment the curtain rises to reveal the picture perfect setting for the inn. It is traditional, but not stale, staging, just perfect for the story to unfold. Great costumes, good lighting.

Singing: Araiza is outstanding Des Grieux. I have not expected him to act so well. I like his singing very much. I have few DVDs with him and he sometimes act a bit wooden. (Mind you, how can you act as Tamino or Belmonte?) Here he is flesh and blood character, every emotion is in his voice and on his face.

His singing is outstanding and he gets an ovation in his convent scene.

Gruberova is Manon. From young girl, so open to life and love, so wanting both love and money, so amoral and at the same time lovable. Her singing outstanding. Perfect notes, crystall clear, nice pianissimos. Superb.

Manon is not my favorite opera. I bought it for Gruberova. My prior atempts to hear/see Manon were disappointing. I was bored, and never could get to the end. The one with Fleming.. what a bore. This performance is very vibrant, very dynamic. Very exciting.

Applause at the end goes on and on.

DVD Quality: Audio and Video is completely remastered. Sound is great. Image is great.

It is 5 stars all the way. Highly recommended.",1179187200,31,1540,4.636029411764706
