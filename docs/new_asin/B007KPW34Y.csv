8519147,4,B007KPW34Y,"This is an extraordinary example of someone not letting hatred and horrible, unimaginable experiences consume their mind and soul. Jaycee Duggard was abducted at age 11, sexual abused, confined for years, and held captive for 18 years. Her demeanor now is not what you would expect. I show this to psychology classes as an example of both learned helplessness (why didn't she run away when she finally had the chance), and not letting horrible experiences continue to dominate your life. It shows how she has chosen to live a happy life now. I didn't like the segment where they got away from the interview and pretended to be righteous reporters that hound those who failed in the system. Overall, this is truly inspiring.",1384646400,,723,4.8861788617886175
