Perhaps you know you're in for a treat when you learn that a certain writer or producer is involved in a film. Maybe all it takes is hearing the familiar Warner Brothers animation theme.

  Me, I know I'm all set when I hear a manly chorus singing:

  The mighty sons of Hercules they thunder through the years!
  They will never know the pain of a coward's fears!
  The mighty sons of Hercules are men as men should be!
  They burn with dreams and turn those dreams into history!

  This one starts out promisingly enough. The Devil of the Desert (DOTD) manages to infiltrate some fancy pants sultan's palace during the sultan's daughter's wedding, and then has his men lay waste to the entire household. Everyone is either stabbed, set of fire, dragged through the streets behind a running horse or pushed down on the ground really, really hard. The Sultan succumbs to a massive case of poisoned arrow-itis.

  As DOTD is rampaging through the palace he stumbles into the bed chambers of a rather slinky looking young lady. Her name is Zorias or Psoriasis; it's hard to tell with the dubbing. But it doesn't really matter because she looks like an Evil Ann-Margaret (EAM) which as you know is one of the best kinds of Ann-Margaret.

  DOTD chuckles evilly and tells EAM that he is going to wed her so he can legally claim the throne. Now I know he's the DOTD and all, but her reaction still seemed a little extreme. Without hesitating a second she hurls herself out a window and crashes into a river many stories below. There must have been some really nasty gossip going around about DOTD, like he had a case of the Lip Crispies or swung a tiny scimitar or something.

  The next scene introduces the hero, Antar, and I have to say I was not very impressed. He looked like a cross between the guy who played the evil karate instructor in Karate Kid (There is NO MERCY in THIS DOJO!!!) and Baby Huey. It didn't help that ""Huey-cules"" was more or less wearing a huge diaper.

  He was sitting on the shore of a river and wading out of the river is a skinny teen-age boy, also wearing a diaper and carrying a tiny fish. Huey-cules takes the fish, violently spits it through the mouth on a pointy stick, and mightily declares that it will take more than a morsel to satisfy HIS mighty appetite. The boy laughed, nervously I thought, and I felt a little bit uncomfortable.

  Huey-cules' sharp eyes spot someone unconscious drifting down the river. He swims out and rescues her and of course, it's evil Ann-Margaret!

  Unfortunately watching this all happen is a large group of heavily armed bandits who are literally about 10 feet away yet entirely unnoticed by Huey-cules and his lil' fella. They drop Huey-cules like a beeyotch with a blow to the back of the head and make off with the girl.

  Huey-cules wakes up and destroys a few of the bandits dumb enough to linger around and then is off in hot pursuit of EAM. The rest of the movie is pretty standard ""get back the girl"" stuff. There are some highlights though. They action is not bad at all, and there are plenty of mistakes you can make fun of when the going gets slow. Also the skinny lil' fella I told you about? Not only is he mute, his name actually is Mute! If they're going to name people after their drawbacks why not call Huey-cules Musclebound or Ponderous Thigh Dude? There is also a Chamber of Death in which Huey-cules and DOTD fight to the death and an all too brief scene where Huey-cules fights a rhino. In most scenes it's actually a real guy attempting to wrestle a real, if not young, rhinoceros! The best part is the look of determination on Huey's face. He looks like he's thinking ""Yeah, I can really do this."" Priceless.

  Another favorite scene is when the Sultan's son takes a thrown knife in the back. He grabs his gut and grunts in pain, then looks up and off camera, pauses for a split second as he realizes what he did and then reaches back and grabs the area where the knife was supposed to have struck him, grunts in pain and falls to the floor.

  It's a bit slow at times but all in all a fun diversion. You should check it out if for no other reason than how often are you going to get to see a man fight bare-handed against a rhino?",1266883200,5,4365,4.411764705882353
