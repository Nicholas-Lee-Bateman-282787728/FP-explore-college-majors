7788823,2,0767812662,"Having absorbed as much Titanic information as possible in all media areas I was disappointed in this video simply because it was not what I expected.  The video dealt mainly with the research vessel, its equipment and personnel rather than the Titanic herself.
  Undersea shots were minimal and left me wanting much more.  If you are interested in the technology it takes to capture Titanic's image from the 2 1/2 mile depth where she lays, then this may be a video you'll enjoy.",1018742400,3,480,4.746987951807229
