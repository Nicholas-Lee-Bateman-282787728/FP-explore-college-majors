8432778,4,B004KDYR7A,"When I was growing up in Hawaii, we had several Japanese movie theaters showing samurai films with English subtitles.  Kinnosuke Nakamura was one of the handsome leading men the girls went back to see over and over again. In Secret of the Urn, he plays a one-eyed/one-armed ronin (masterless samurai) with a big chip on his remaining shoulder - hard drinking, whoring and rough voiced (how does he keep his kimono so white?). But when the camera turns to his unscarred side, you can see that he is still a handsome man and very fit. The movie is typical of the genre, with humorous insults, goofy characters, noble/honorable/dishonorable conduct, gangs of swordsmen being routed by our lone hero and good wins out in the end. Kudos to the producers of the DVD for a clear transfer of images and sound from the film. In addition to English subtitles along the bottom, there are helpful definitions of terminology displayed along the top, repeated in the Extras. The Extras-which I did not even expect to have for this old film-also include a few bios of the stars and writer, and a still photo gallery.",1390780800,2,1101,4.734375
8432779,4,B004KDYR7A,"A very entertaining samurai yarn. This story has apparently been made several times with varying details  and approaches. This version takes a middle road, being more drama than comedy. The sword fights are good, and production values of high quality.",1389052800,,251,5.275
8432780,4,B004KDYR7A,A  little slow (Japanese style) but enjoyable. Sword fighting is very brutal and I always marveled at how well the actors portray it without serious injury.,1364428800,,156,5.0
8432781,5,B004KDYR7A,"I love Japanese Samurai Cinema which is a kind of (theatrical) soap opera AND a genre of period films.

That said I recommend ""The Secret of the Urn"" featuring a half-blind, one-armed expert swordsman defending a fief from the overarching Tokugawa medieval government of the times. It is pure fiction but we love it so.

In addition to the strong hero played by Kinnosuke Nakamura (1932-1997) we have the strong heroine played by one of my favorite Japanese character actresses Keiko Awaji (1933-Present), young and hot back in 1966 and still alive and a character today.

This is one of those movies where you either borrow it, buy it, or view it online. It's great.",1340841600,4,667,4.782608695652174
8432782,4,B004KDYR7A,"I saw this recently on netflix(they need more old-school samurai films on there) and was surprised as to how good it was.  Then came here and was surprised to see only 2 positive reviews for it.  So i decided to make it 3 for 3.  I actually by-passed this film a few times cause of the cover art.  Well, never judge a movie by its dvd/cover art.

The movie has colorful characters, a fun atmosphere, and best of all is briskly paced with quite a few action scenes sprinkled throughout its run-time.  The main character is not very likable, but he will win you over eventually.  This is just a flat-out, pure-entertainment samurai flick.  For a more serious one, with the same lead actor and a brutal fight scene at the end, try the b&w REVENGE(no reviews on amazon?  Really?) that's also available on netflix.

Honestly, if i had bought/rented the dvd unseen, i would have been happy with my purchase.  Will have to find a cheap copy to add to my collection even though i can access it anytime on netflix.  Btw, i am no expert on samurai flicks so take my recommendation with a grain of salt.  I have seen and enjoyed throne of blood, sanjuro, ran, sword of doom, shogun assassin/baby cart series, zatoichi, samurai assassin, etc as a point of reference.",1333843200,8,1254,4.52
8432783,4,B004KDYR7A,"Great Samurai film about a classic Japanese character.  Kinnosuke Nakamura is never better in his role as Tange Sazen, the one-eyed, one-armed swordsman, in a film directed by Hideo Gosha, who is well known to be one of the best Samurai film directors in Japan.

This 1966 version of the often-filmed Tange Sazen is possibly the best one of the lot.  The acting, the sword fighting, the characters, the story, when compared to the other films from the past 8 decades, is hard to surpass.

Kinnosuke Nakamura also starred in another AnimEigo release, the 5-film/5-disc set ""Miyamoto Musashi"" series.  As usual, he is in top form as Tange Sazen. His sword fighting skills are a joy to watch, slashing and slicing with one hand.",1304899200,11,725,4.814516129032258
8432784,5,B004KDYR7A,"Tange Samanosuke (Kinnosuke Nakamura) has been summoned by his Director because a woman has been caught and is being tortured, suspected of being a Shogunate spy. He learns that there is a second spy, and Samanosuke is directed to kill the man, who turns out to be Kamajima Kojuro, whose fianc&eacute; Hagino is a childhood friend of Samanosuke, much to the samurai's dismay. But it must be made to look like a duel. Samanusuke takes Kojuro for a ride and challenges him to a duel with honor, but the other man realizes that he has been outed and refuses, knowing that he cannot win, before turning on him treacherously. In the following melee, Samanosuke loses his right eye as well as his right arm.

A year passes. In Chiyoda Castle, in Edo, Lord Guraku, on behalf of the Shogun, selects the Yagyu fief for the honor of seeing to the Toshogu Shrine renovation. It seems an odd choice, as the fief is small, only possessing some 13,000 ryo, which is not a lot for such a major task. In fact when the heads of the fief check into the matter, they discover that the previous fief entrusted with the renovation, some twenty years before, spent some 250,000 ryo and were ruined in the process. It took them ten years to recover from the honor, an honor which the Yagyus can ill afford. They turn to an old man named Ippusai to figure out what to do; he is known as the ""living encyclopedia"" and is said to be 120 years old. He tells them of a secret stash possessed by the Yagyu clan. The secret of this stash lies inside the ""Earless Monkey Urn"", which was a gift from Ieyasu Tokugawa many years before. Seems simple enough, send for the urn, which is at the fief, right?  Wrong, nothing is ever quite so simple when money is involved.

Guraku does not wish the Yagyus to succeed, being covetous of the fief's valuable position near Kyoto--indeed, he has set them up for failure.. He dispatches Taiken to steal the urn, promising to make him a magistrate of the Yagyu fief. His plans are overheard by sheer chance by a thief named Yokichi, who rushes to tell his sister, who is a con artist, like him, and their leader, the news. They decide to steal the urn for themselves, but they aren't the only ones who have that same idea, and when the boat containing the Yagyus and their valuable urn lands, it is immediately beset upon by many people intent on securing the prize for themselves. A great handoff ensues, with the urn passing from person to person, last of whom is a small child who leads the adults a merry chase, winding up in a small hut, from which a single man emerges--a man with only one eye and one arm, who fights off the intruders. When Genzaburo, the younger brother of the Yagyu lord, thanks him for his help and asks for the urn's return, the ronin--who calls himself Tange Sazen--refuses, escaping with the help of Yokichi and his sister.

Sazen holes up with the con artists, and has his hands full keeping the urn from them, as well as the child, and everyone else. In the meantime, realizing the ruination that is sure to come with accepting the task of renovating the Shrine, Lord Tsushima, of the Yagyu, attempts to decline the honor, but that doesn't work so well for him. In fact, he's invited to a tea party on the 13th at Kan'ei-ji Temple, and the Shogun (through Guraku) requests that the Yagyus bring their special ""Earless Monkey Urn"" for the occasion. Tsushima can't very well refuse the Shogun's request, and now, unless he gets control of the urn back into his hands, he is doubly screwed.

I've seen the character of Tange Sazen before, in Samurai Vendetta. Apparently he is a very popular samurai character in Japan, on a par with The Lone Ranger or Zorro in the West. It's an interesting film. After the tragedy which changes his life, Tange becomes a ronin, a bitter, disinterested man who lives by his own rules. Forced to develop his own unique one-handed style of sword fighting, he is indeed a force to be reckoned with. But perhaps he is not as hard as he seems when Lady Hagino unexpectedly turns up, looking for him. Kinnosuke Nakamura is masterful in the role of Tange, and the secondary cast of characters is great - Yokichi is the comic relief, playing the perfect foil between Tange and Yokichi's sister Ofuji. The thieves whom Tange utilizes to find a matching vase are also priceless. There is the usual violence to be expected in a samurai film, and a lot of blood. But the plot is a good one, and keeps you wondering up until the last minute which way it's going to go. The part about the tea party and the request to have the urn there, reminds me of the Three Musketeers, where the Queen is requested by King Louis XIII to wear her special diamond to a party, but the trouble is she doesn't have them all because she gave a couple to her lover, so it's a race against time to see if they can be returned or duplicated in time.

I've learned from watching samurai films that just because there is only a minute or two left in the film doesn't mean someone doesn't have time to die.  It's not over til it's over. This film is a keeper, and a good addition to your samurai collection.",1300838400,34,5138,4.459574468085107
