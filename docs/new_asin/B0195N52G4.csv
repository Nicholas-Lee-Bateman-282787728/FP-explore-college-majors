7563077,5,B0195N52G4,Wonderful comedy-mystery.  I had seen the movie in the 1970's and enjoyed it.  I was very happy to find it and purchase it for my collection.,1457049600,,141,4.384615384615385
7563078,5,B0195N52G4,"This movie is so Bad its Fantastic.  This is part of the history of my sister and me .  In 1945 we should have gone to a Western matinee,  we ventured across the street to See Murder in the Blue Room.  We never told the folks,  this was our secret, and now we were able to see it again.
It was wonderful, one laugh from the start to the end.
Thank you Amazon,  I had looked for this for years now we both have a copy.",1455753600,,417,3.7906976744186047
7563079,4,B0195N52G4,"One of the funniest films I ever saw as a kid. Funny, silly, ridiculous yet a load of fun. I laughed till I hurt, still can't find it to own.",1422748800,,141,3.7333333333333334
7563080,1,B0195N52G4,"This is a copy of a copy of a copy from a non-original source. Hot spots all through it and scenes cannot be viewed. Returning it tomorrow to: imdebtfree15 in Nashville, Tennessee. It is a joke to charge $20 for this piece of junk. Years ago Amazon had original VHS copies. Some people sure have their nerve. He is not debt free as his address states.",1402358400,3,351,4.333333333333333

8744055,4,B0195N52G4,"I love '40s film-noir and crime films.  This film combines humor with a ""whodunit"" flair.  I saw this for free, streaming it from somewhere, and liked it so much I ordered the DVD.  If you like older feature films you'll likely be highly entertained by this one.",1522108800,,262,4.531914893617022
8744056,4,B0195N52G4,Saw this movie as a kid late one night....laughed so hard I looked for it for years. I bought it as soon as I found it and I enjoyed it just as much as the first time I saw it.,1489708800,2,176,3.425
8744057,5,B0195N52G4,This was a gift.  The recipient enjoyed the movie and the quality of the disc.,1485129600,,78,4.2
8744058,4,B0195N52G4,"Not bad 1944 comedy-mystery.  People start disappearing from a particular bedroom in a reputedly haunted mansion.  (By the way, it is haunted).  Among the suspects are a trio of amusing poor-man's Andrew Sisters knock-offs who weren't even around for the first disappearing act.  They perform a couple of fun musical numbers.  I remember seeing this film back in the 70's and have been waiting to see it again ever since.  The DVD'R I ordered is not bad quality but the film needs re-mastering.  Highly recommended.",1484956800,3,515,4.988235294117647

8744060,5,B0195N52G4,"I remember watching this fun film.....more of a mystery comedy than a horror mystery....on Sunday Afternoons on our local station when I was a child.  It took long enough to get it released on ANYTHING.  All that was floating around out there for years were bootleg copies which were of terrible quality.  While the film transfer of this DVD release is not the best, it's still better than a bootleg copy.  The images are clear but at times, somewhat grainy, but not enough to even matter.  I love this movie, mostly because of the three girls who steal the picture with their comedic antics in trying to solve the mystery of the ""Murde in the Blue Room"".  There are two musical numbers they perform as well which are very enjoyable.  This is a fun movie to watch on a rainy day or on a Sunday afternoon after church or before dark!",1483315200,3,832,4.470198675496689
8744061,5,B0195N52G4,"An unusual movie on the ""Blue Room"" subject, but I think, highly underrated. It has a rare combination of mystery, humor, dancing and a bit of
supernatural stuff. The 3 young women were excellent, and I wonder why they did not have more starring roles after this movie.",1474934400,2,269,4.625
8744062,5,B0195N52G4,Good copy of this movie.,1471392000,,24,4.0
8744063,5,B0195N52G4,First time I watched this movie I was 8 years old at March Field AFB in 1944 with my father who was stationed there and it scared me.  Been looking for the film for a long time and watched the film with my wife and we enjoyed it and very funny.  She couldn't believe it scared me.  I couldn't either.  My grand kids will find it quite amusing.  The DVD quality was very good.,1463961600,,375,4.013513513513513
