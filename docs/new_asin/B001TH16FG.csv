8341394,3,B001TH16FG,"This is an unrestored video produced from poor quality source material.  It's grainy with poor contrast and tonal values and a lot of detail is lost.  Visually it's a bit of a struggle to follow, but worth it.  The product details list a run time of 90 minutes, but it is actually 59.  For these aspects the video is 1-star.  What brings up the rating is that the story is told in a moderately interesting way and the film is an important early example of Gothic horror films.  The source book (also called Trilby) influenced the writing of the novel Phantom of the Opera, and the film of Trilby influenced the creation of the 1925 film Phantom of the Opera.  The book is highly anti-semitic, and most of that is explicitly removed in the film.  Svengali is referred to consistently in the film as evil, but never Jewish, only referred to as coming from the East.  However, the appearance of Svengali (hair, beard, clothing, mannerism, etc.) is a common treatment of Jewish characters in early cinema (even into the 1930s), so viewers of the time would have recognized Svengali as being Jewish.  Being silent, the producers were limited in what they could do to show Svengali hypnotizing Trilby, and the hand/arm gestures and piercing gazes come across today as kind of silly.  In the book, Trilby and Billie both die (though not at the same time).  In the film they are reunited at the end.",1515888000,,1391,4.63265306122449
8341395,4,B001TH16FG,"Two major films were made of the successful but flawed anti-Semitic book Trilby. The first is the silent 1915 film. Both films make changes in their presentation of the book. Each deletes the flaws of the multitude of French which non-French speakers could not understand, and more importantly ceases to describe Svengali as a despicable Jew. In fact, there is not even a hint that he is Jewish. I suggest that people interested in reading a review of this film also read my review of Du Mauriers book Trilby.
This 1915 film has not been restored. It is very granny, but everything is visible enough. Since the film is only about an hour in length, much that is in the book is absent. For example, Little Billies mother had a hand in stopping the marriage of her son to Trilby: this episode and its consequences is absent. There are other inconsequential changes, along with a significant one: for while the novel ends on a very sad note, this film ends on a happy one.",1508889600,,969,4.574712643678161

To start it has all the original title cards and no graininess. So that is a plus. The music was neither distracting or a bad fit, though it wasn't by any means exceptional. Average. and my cheapo DVD player had no trouble loading it.
  The movie started with a laughable bit of the Svengali guy leading the girl. Incredibly silly I thought. Then (or was this first?) what appeared to be original text (but I soon realized it was an added bit) about the origins of this story, the author and where it played and then when It kept going on and on, then 1961 was mentioned ...for pete's sake! 1961?they added about 3-4 minutes of text to set the stage or ramp up the picture like you were going to see a masterpiece or something. I just said cmonget on with it!
  Finally the movie started. I like any silent but I have to say this one seemed predictable pretty from much the beginning. And the motivation for the evil Svengali to lure the lady to do his bidding seemed completely illogical based on an important detail in the story.(making a silk purse out of a sows ear so to speak).  The romance also seemed a surprise based on the early scenes as it appeared the suitor was repulsed. The movie is an hour long and they'd drawn it out... some bits inordinately long, like for example the opening scene of Paris: usually a backdrop city scene last a 2 or 3 seconds, but this was about 10+ seconds. Odd.
There was the sporadic bit of innovation, but it was sprinkled pretty sparsely. We just seemed to know exactly where this movie was going within about 10 minutes from the start. No surprises, no twists. It just went from point A to point B with no innovations, so as a movie it was average at best, even with the screwy character of Svengali leading the show. I suppose for 1915 it is a better than average production, but that said Ive seen better from this period too.",1386633600,,1958,4.32425068119891
8341398,4,B001TH16FG,Excellent story line and good acting. The DVD picture quality was fair to good. If you love silent films this is a good buy.,1376438400,,124,4.208333333333333
8341399,4,B001TH16FG,"This film is a fine example of French director Maurice Tourneur's outstanding talents and pioneering work in the early days of cinema.  Famous for directing classics such as ""The Last of the Mohicans"" (1920) and working with fledgling movie studios in America during the 1910s, his smooth, sophisticated style stands out from those of his contemporaries.  Not only was he one of the first great masters of the `narrative film', but his artistic flair is reflected in beautiful sets and designs, quickly making him one of America's most famous directors alongside D.W. Griffith, Cecil B DeMille and Thomas Ince.  This unique aesthetic touch makes his films of the 1910s appear to be much farther advanced in cinematography, thereby making this 1915 version of ""Trilby"" as entertaining and enjoyable to watch as a film of the mid or late 1920s.

Based on a French story of the late 19th century in the gothic horror genre which was popular at the time, ""Trilby"" is part romance and part chilling suspense, revealing the subtle nature of early horror films, namely a strange man from the mysterious East who has extraordinary mental powers and abilities bordering on the supernatural.  The mystique of such people from India and similar places were fascinating and exciting to Western audiences at the turn of last century, but the story of ""Trilby"" is just as interesting in our day.  The mysterious stranger, known as ""Svengali"", sees an opportunity for wealth and fame by controlling a young woman with the power of his mind so that she becomes like a mindless puppet, doing his will and becoming a great diva all through his special powers.  But before she falls completely under his spell, she becomes engaged to be married, and the young groom is heartbroken by the sudden disappearance of his bride, and later sees her perform on stage while under Svengali's spell.

Famous silent screen actress, Clara Kimball Young, plays the role of Trilby perfectly with a balance of girlish energy and charm, and appropriate pantomime to convey the state of complete hypnotic control she falls under at the hands of Svengali.  So popular was this story in the early part of the 1900s that it was remade as a sound film in the 1930s with the focus on the enigmatic Svengali, in which John Barrymore gives a brilliant performance in the movie simply entitled ""Svengali"".

This version by Alpha Home Entertainment has an introduction to the film, its stars and director, and a classical music soundtrack that does not always fit the scenes.  Furthermore, the picture quality is a little poor, with faces often appearing too white, general blurring and frequent flickering.  It is still a reasonable standard for a budget label like this, but to enjoy this film as it was originally meant to be seen, I recommend the version by the Reelclassicdvd label, also available on amazon.com.  This version has much clearer picture quality, some tinting, and a piano score made to suit the film.",1268352000,4,2974,4.935871743486974
