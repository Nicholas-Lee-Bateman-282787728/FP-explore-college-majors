2475091,4,B000DWMZLW,"""Lie With Me"" is a sexually charged love story that somehow got away from the MPAA with an R rating. I think the filmmakers must be in the MPAA, because this movie's got some graphic scenes. We're talking full frontal male & female nudity, with sex that looks very unsimulated. You don't see full penetration, but...Well, you'll have to see it. This movie is adapted from a book and I hope the book had more depth than this, because I feel something must have been lost in the transition from book-to-screen. The movie is about Leila (Lauren Lee Smith), a girl a lot of people would call a ""slut."" Leila likes to have sex and she likes to have it a lot. She doesn't seem to understand love or a relationship, but she understands sex. Could this be attributed to a bad homelife? It could be, but the filmmakers don't really show her with a bad homelife. Her parents are getting divorced and her sister is about to get married, despite having had sex with her ex just a couple nights before the marriage. It's kind of bad, but not this bad. Anyway, Leila ends up at a party where she hastily drags a guy outside and begins performing oral sex on him. Meanwhile, a guy she met a few minutes ago named David (Eric Balfour, 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre') is sitting in a truck watching her with his girlfriend. As the girlfriend begins copying Leila and as both Leila and David have sex with their respective partners; They look at each other and something is there. They may not be sure what, but it's there. The next day, David goes looking for Leila and he finds her. She begins to masturbate on a playground for him, which freaks him out a bit, but he returns to her and they both have sex that I swear isn't simulated. There's almost no way it could be. Anyway, for some reason; We have to find out that David is caring for his invalid father. But is this really important to the plot? I mean it's a bit heartwrenching, but not very important. This movie could've poignant, but that's where it misses. The performances are good enough and the movie is entertaining; It's a vast improvement over another sexually charged movie called ""9 Songs"" (in which the sex wasn't simulated and was slightly more graphic than this). Balfour and Smith make a cute couple; The sex scenes are great. But, overall, it misses a bit.

2475092,3,B000DWMZLW,"* SPOILER ALERT: This review reveals key elements of the plot *

I liked it. But it didn't resonate with me like the first five minutes promised it would. When the movie began, I felt Leila, the anti-heroine, promising me, ""You will relate to me.""

At first I did. The blankness in her eyes as she went out to get what she both needed and hated I had felt myself too many times. When Leila and David were playing their cat-and-mouse game, the ""I'll show you mine if you show me yours,"" they both seemed six years old: emotionally, they both are. Things began to get uneasy for me as the viewer.

The next seventy percent or so of the movie was filled with more sex than you can shake an, er, stick at, and nothing about that bothered me (especially Eric Balfour's totally nude body). When the relationship between Leila and David began to unravel, it became apparent to me that both of them likely were diagnosable borderlines, a personality disorder, and from that point, my hopes for a successful resolution to the movie were nil. Would they live happily ever after? Would they continue their cycle of alternating emotional abuse? How would the movie end?

Ultimately, the ending DIDN'T satisfy, as I was afraid it wouldn't, but then, wasn't the whole movie about NOT being satisfied?

Director Cl&eacute;ment Virgo's use of harsh lighting, fast panning, and extreme closeups is very effective in this film. I would consider watching some of his other work, but I'm not sure whether I'd recommend this one on its intellectual merits. On its more visceral merits, however, it fits the bill almost as well as Larry Clark's Ken Park.",1152144000,109,1632,4.6923076923076925
2475093,5,B000DWMZLW,"If your a fan of Eric Balfour, from Six Feet Under, you'll love this! My jaw dropped more than once! (In a good way!)",1151539200,4,117,3.9166666666666665
2475094,4,B000DWMZLW,"This was fun to watch yet at the same time rather disappointing (maybe depressing would be a better description). Fun if you go into it expecting sex, pretty faces and writhing bodies. But disappointing because there is little else besides. Depressing because the main characters appear so selfish, self-absorbed and are not in fact very likeable. Its main theme is about two emotionally immature individuals, learning rather late in life, the difference between lust and love. It's based on a short story by Tamara Faith Berger who also happens to be director Clement Virgo's wife. To its credit it tackles the lust vs love angle reasonably well.

For our protagonist Leila, life is one sexual encounter after another, free of emotional attachment, free of commitment, free of love. It opens with a naked Leila (the lovely Lauren Lee Smith) alone on the couch, masturbating while watching a porn video. There is no major dialogue until at least 10 minutes into the film and even then it is pretty banal if not trite, reflecting in a way the shallowness of these individuals. Director Virgo notes that he was trying to make a visual film as opposed to a talkie. And visually, it is beautifully shot. Leila goes to a party, meets David (Eric Balfour), with whom she feels an instant and mutual attraction. However he is with his girlfriend, Victoria (Polly Shannon). So she snares another lucky male whom she proceeds to bl__ and fu__ in the parking lot, in full view of David and his girlfriend, who naturally do the same thing, both couples more interested in the opposite pair than in their own partners. David of course is enthralled with Leila and hooks up with her. They have sex. Then they have more sex. And that's all they have. They don't really have a relationship. They don't communicate. They just copulate. Like rutting animals. Throughout the film, sex is depicted as mechanical, selfish and purely physical and although arousing, it is emotionally empty. The main impression I was left with was one of emptiness, hollowness and how sad these people were, physically connecting yet mentally and emotionally all alone. So much so that when David's ailing father whom he's been dotingly caring for dies, Leila cannot empathise, much less give solace. And neither is David of much help when Leila struggles with her parents' own breakup.

Luckless girlfriend Victoria (Polly Shannon) is, for me anyway, the most sympathetic character here. Of the three she is the only one with any insight into their relationship. She is also given some of the more memorable lines in the movie. During her confrontation with Leila, she warns him against David, ""He's got intimacy issues. He needs a mommy,"" and more cruelly but to the point, ""You can suck a guy's dick all you want. It doesn't mean he's ever gonna love you."" She may be cast as the ""other"" woman but you can't help sympathising with her and thinking that she's better off rid of him. Virgo's need to have a ""happy ending"" where the characters come together after realising their love for each other is simply not convincing. It's hard to believe that these self-absorbed, narcissistic personalities could suddenly develop the insight to relate to someone, other than on a purely sensual level. The odd result is that, apart from the sex scenes, the movie when viewed as a whole, has a pretty depressing feel to it. Still, quibbles about the film aside, the sex scenes are not in the least bit disappointing. In fact, they are hot. Very much so. They are a lot more erotically arousing than in the bulk of porn material shot today which is so clinically anatomical as to no longer be erotic.

Although the DVD is unrated, it would most likely merit an NC-17. The sex scenes are as close to hardcore as you can get without it being X-rated. The missing elements are the money-shots and scenes of actual penetration. Otherwise everything else is there, right down to Leila playfully handling David's little thingie.

Lauren Lee Smith is gorgeous to look at and a very good actress. It took guts to do what she did here and I hope it pays off for her in the future. She should be in more films if only she could make time in between shooting ""The L Word."" In the commentary, director Virgo and Smith discuss how they first met when he directed her in her first lesbian scene in ""The L Word.""

The film has been beautifully transferred to DVD in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio (enhanced for widescreen TV). The film as we learn in the commentary was shot on Super 16mm so there is a slight graininess throughout as would be expected from this medium. Otherwise it looks gorgeous. Colors are vibrantly rich, black levels are accurately set, the golden summer palette that Virgo chooses for the film comes through handsomely. Sound comes in both Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby 2.0 Stereo. Dialogue is recorded at a very low level and is at times barely audible while the pounding music from the nightclub scenes are overwhelmingly loud. Rather like a porn video. I was constantly reaching for the remote to raise and lower the volume. There is an accompanying trailer, a photo gallery and of course the commentary by director Clement Virgo and Lauren Lee Smith who breaks into infectious laughter whenever she's asked to comment on her sex scenes. There is however no behind the scenes footage as advertised by Amazon. In the end, it may not count as a truly thought-provoking or even very credible film but it is arousingly enjoyable nonetheless. From the other reviews here, I take it most viewers will be seeing it for the sex. So, as far as the star ratings go: Five stars for the sizzling hot sex and for Lauren Lee Smith, three and a half for the movie itself.",1148774400,503,5710,4.740442655935614

2475096,5,B000DWMZLW,"Lauren Lee Smith is great in this movie.  Yes, she is very sexy although a little anorexic.  The sex in this movis is explict and hot.  When I ordered this movie (unrated edition) I expected a hot movie, what I did not expect was a movie that also had some profound messages.

Ms Smith's character was frantic and needy, and sex was a way for her to get (love, approval, etc) immediate gratification on an emotional level. Her sexual responses are greedy and lustful.  When she falls in love, she runs away from the feelings.  The process she goes through is painful, but neccessary for her.  The viewer is drawn in with her and becomes involved whether or not they want to be.

Her love interest took care of his elderly father.  They had an excellent relationship.  He would bath him and cook for him, and was his caregiver.  The movie showed in graphic detail what being a caregiver means.  When he passes, he breaks down and takes the viewer on a journey that is rare in films.

In short, if you like graphic sex and this movie has it, the sexual scenes are graphic but not vulger or sleezy.  The story line is excellent and profound and I suspect that most women could watch this movie and identify with the main character. Good movie folks and it is a shame that only the sexual aspect is focused on.",1146096000,52,1306,4.410041841004184

2475142,3,B000DWMZLW,"I've waited a long time to see this and finally broke down.  It's much better than its detractors say--even here on Amazon--and could be as good as its aficionados claim.  The plot is tenuous, but don't believe those who say this is plotless.  As E. M. Forster said, ""`The king died and then the queen died' is a story.  `The king died and then the queen died of grief' is a plot.""  And there are causal connexions here, but they're submerged under the protagonist's voiceovers, which offer her tortured reflexions on love and sex.  She starts out--spoiler alert--wanting to be like a man, as sexually adventurous and emotionally uninvolved as a man, and her triumph turns into her potential tragedy.  She's not an everywoman character and she may even be somewhat repellant to some people, but she has as much right to her own voice and opinion, and as much right to her own narrative space as Mahatma Gandhi.  The film celebrates the body, whether in virility or infirmity (the body, as an intransigently material social artifact)--to such an extent that religious people and spiritualists may find the movie unsettling.  Eric Balfour is statuesque in the extreme, with bodylines more compelling and fluid than any justifications Leila gives for wanting them pressing against her own.  Basically the film takes the clich of the devoted woman and the restless man and switches it around.  But it does much more than that and the riches it offers turn up in unexpected places.",1332720000,2,1476,4.864

I'll keep my reasoning short but sweet: It's an incredibly weak story with pornographic material. If you want an entertaining story, this movie is not for you.

2475145,2,B000DWMZLW,"Sadly I expected something more then this, or something a bit more revealing like other videos I watched. This movie is an embarrassment, actually. The story though was a typical one where couples don't feel interested in what they got and traded off secretly, yet openly.... which is a normal american life portrayed well, but you would think with it being a sex movie there would actually be more then this. The entire movie is nothing but quickies, lucky to last up to two minutes... then you don't really see anything then the body movements itself. No zoom in's to see the goodies or nothing. Worse off they have a dialog during their acts... not thats a bad thing but when you want a sex movie, you want to see the sex, not listen to important dialog that actually means something. Worse off is when you try and listen your forced to watch the entire scene over again because both a computer and dvd player won't let you rewind or adjust the progress bar. Poor development there as well.

I seen some good porn films.. and there is better hentai then this piece of crap, and their crappy engrish-dialog is better then this tidbit. Before the end of the movie  you actually sit back and think 'well no wonder why they are sexually frustrated, they stop after the first round.' If it lasted more then two minutes, I might actually enjoy it.

I do not recommended this movie, at all... don't waste your time. This movie is only worth 1 one and a half stars, but it got two only because the guy in the movie does not have a soda/beer belly.

But one night she meets a guy(David) at a party and they are both instantly interested in each other. Lyla knows that she wants to be with him, but struggles to change her lifestyle. As she is with David who by the way is taking care of his dying father she fights to let herself feel more towards him then just a sex partner while David's ex who only appears in a few small scenes is trying to get David back. Most of the show is Lyla and David in bed together and Lyla telling her feelings in the background. There is no excitement in any of the scenes in the show. Almost every scene takes place in David's house which only includes serious conversations and sex. The sex scenes are great though and it does have a good enough of an ending, but to enjoy this show you need to be willing to watch a slowly paced movie with little creativity!",1293062400,6,1030,4.15

2475150,4,B000DWMZLW,"Bottom-Line: To be sure Lie With Me is not destined for the Oscar's, or even release in American theaters, but the movies was meaningful, timely, well directed, and well acted..

The American--and apparently Canadian--dating scene(s) is a mess.  If my eighteen year old daughter is to be believed, traditional dating for this generation of young adults is pass&eacute;, hooking up (getting together just to have sex) is the norm, these days, not the exception.  Virginity is no longer a commodity to be cherished, but a badge of shame to be discarded the moment the opportunity presents itself.  Fellatio is now performed in bathrooms, dorm rooms and in groups settings with points handed out to the girl who performed the most BJ's in one sitting.  While I can see how men benefit from this arrangement, I fail to see how women survive this ritual emotionally unscathed.

I am not implying the women are weak, but they are more emotionally vulnerable than men at this stage of the game as it relates to sex and sexual gamesmanship.  Men after all are biologically built to relate to sex as unattached minions moving about the world planting their seed in as many willing females as possible.  At this stage in our development we men see sex as a road to domination and pleasure, as well as a biological and physiological imperative.

Women on the other hand, invest much more emotional baggage in the act of sex, no matter the age.  I don't see how acting like men and floating from partner to partner engaging in meaningless sex, does not emotionally and philologically harm women, if not on the surface of her soul, then far deeper where the scares can and are life long roadmaps all leading to emotional dysfunction.  That is how nature made women, and therein lays the difference between the genders.

Lie With Me (2005) attempts to tackle this changing landscape with a story that is laced with graphic sex, prodigious nudity and foul language, and no shortage emotionally charged messages that pay homage to a tradition well worth respecting, not rejecting.  Released in 2005 Lie With Me sets about showing the shallow nature of relationships that are based purely on sex in our instant gratification based society.

Directed by Jamaican born Clement Virgo with screenplay by his wife Tamara Berger--who also wrote the novel the movie is based on--Lie With Me begins with lead character Leila portrayed by Lauren Lee Smith (The L Word) lying topless on the couch in her apartment in Toronto, masturbating while watching a porn video.  She soon finishes without climaxing and leaves her apartment to go crusin' for a piece; in other words she is looking to hook-up and she tells us a much in a narrations as we watch her enter a club, and make her way to the bathroom, all the while being groped by anonymous hands.  But I got the impression that she enjoyed the detached enjoyment; it turned her on; as she puts it, she is good at fu_king and not very good at relationships, because they take work.

While in the bathroom Leila meets a stranger, David portrayed by Eric Balfour (In Her Shoes, The O.C., Conviction) and forms an instant connection.  But there is a problem; he has a girlfriend, Victoria portrayed by Polly Shannon (Earth Final Conflict, Direct Action), but Leila wants to have sex with David so she sets about seducing him by having sex with a nameless man in the parking lot of the club while he watches and has sex with Victoria in the front set of his car.  Leila is in this for herself, and while engaged in intercourse continually warns the poor slob not to climax.

My Viewpoints

Lie With Me is not for the faint of heart or for those easily offended by graphic depictions of sex and nudity, not to mention language only a sailor used to utter.  Within the 93 minute span of the movie we are treated to almost everything: masturbation, undulating nude bodies, a woman holding a man's erect penis (2x), a man with his face buried between a woman's thighs (2x), repetitive scenes of simulated intercourse (anal and vaginal), and plenty of frontal male and female nudity.

Both Lauren Lee Smith and Eric Balfour need to be praised for their unabashed portrayal of their characters; most of the nudity and sex belonged to them.  Lie With Me owes its authenticity to these actors shameless and real portrayals of twenty-something's searching for a connection real enough hold on to.  They hide nothing, hold nothing back in their depictions; it helps that their chemistry on screen was almost palpable.  Some many argue that the sex became repetitive after a few scenes, but I would argue that it is through the repeated sex that the two principle characters formed their connection.

To be sure Lie With Me is not destined for the Oscar's, or even release in American theaters, but the movies was meaningful, timely, well directed, and well acted.  And the movie is titillating without going overboard.  If you watch Lie With Me keep the kiddies far, far away; this movie is for adults only.",1290211200,5,5017,4.767630057803468

2475152,4,B000DWMZLW,"As I am reading other reviews for this film, I think people missed the point. It's not about how good the sex scenes were. It's not porn. Those scenes were fine and pretty realistic. For the plot and content of the film, the characters were alright and pretty realistic as well. What was interesting about the film was that we see a person who cannot connect love and lovemaking. It was pretty ironic when David's girlfriend told Leila that he had intimacy issues with Leila herself having intimacy issues. This obviously comes from the parents. Leila's mom blatantly states she does not want to be married anymore. She doesn't need to. Leila's parents were already pushing senior citizenship by then. So I think Leila's seen a lack of intimacy in what love requires for a long time already. Her sister doesn't help either.  She continues to have an affair with her ex because he is well endowed. I really liked how they showed David taking care of his dad. This sets off Leila's thinking of David as something more than just a good time. Then David's father dies, which leads to the downfall of the relationship. David needed Leila there to help him emotionally, something of great difficulty for Leila. So she leaves him. What was also realistic is that Leila watches porn. I think the number of females watching porn has risen. I liked the part where she tried to control the hobbit she picked up from the club earlier.

OK, I know this movie has gotten some negaive reviews for being too ""pretentious"" and trying too hard to be artsy, or being unrealistic, or having unlikeable leads, but I, personally, will give credit where credit is due. First of all, this movie is VERY real. I know, Ive lived the life of Leila. Ive said the things she's said to herself, Ive thought her thoughts, Ive done her deeds. She is basically emotionally bankrupt. She doesnt know love. She only knows pleasure, and what she can get out of a man. She knows men are the predators, and wants to see herself as one as well, and she's conditioned herself to it. When she meets David, thats all he is at first too, prey. But she starts to see intimate details of his life the longer she's with him, and realizes, um, this is a person with emotions and feelings, and a mind. and that she loves him. She has never felt this, it scares her, she doesnt know how to handle it and she abandons him...only to realize, that she um, loves him?!
David is emotionally needy, and, hey, when she left, he checked out...only to realize that he loves her too.
Pesky love sneaking up on bumping buddies.

I like the paralelling of scenes, where in the beginning, he's running after her out of lust, and at the end he's running after her out of love. I love the voiceovers. I think they ADD to the atmosphere. They are beautifully written, spoken, and true to a cold heart, as well, as a broken one. The music is lush and atmospheric, and the leads, while, not the most sympathic of the bunch, ARE likeable in their imperfect way.

This movie is very saturnine, its lingering, and lazy, but at the end, all is reclaimed. And I think, sweet.
It feels to me like a warm blanket when Im dealing with real-life drama of my own, because I can empathize with Leila so well.

2475165,3,B000DWMZLW,"Clement Virgo's Lie With Me is a very unconventional love story. There are moments in our life that lead us into new territory. What starts out as a casual encounter can turn into something deeper and more powerful.

Leila (Lauren Lee Smith) is a young woman living alone. One night she crashes a party and flirts with David (Eric Balfour). In all respects the relationship should have ended there as he was with his girlfriend Victoria (Polly Shannon) but it doesnt. What happens over the course of that summer is the story that makes up Lie With Me. The central question to be asked is when do emotions come into an affair that is purely sexual. When does the real world intrude on our conception of what love is. The performances in the film are  groundbreaking for both of the young stars. The erotic nature of the film may put some viewers off (or turn them on) depending on their perceptions coming into the film. Given a chance the story the film tells is quite real this is not the made up love story that we are used to. It's gritty and dirty like life itself. Things do not always go the way that we plan for them to go.

2475166,3,B000DWMZLW,"I guess the big lessons here are A) Sex is easy, B) Love is hard, and C) Ms. Smith's costumer should be fired. Lesson A should be obvious to anyone who's learned to grope themselves. Leila clearly fits into that category, as she so ably and repeatedly demonstrates. Lesson B should also be obvious to anyone who ever applied the word ""love"" to anyone but Mommy. Lesson C comes from the fact that curvier figures and sleeker ones can each look good, just not in the same clothes. Ms. Smith has a lovely, slender bust, but just about all of her outfits were tailored for DD or higher. Those collpased bodices, crumpled in on themselves and sulking for lack of the filling they expected, did nothing to set off her kind of natural charm. In fact, she would have looked better with nothing at all - and did so, quite frequently.

Plot (the thing that ties the steamy scenes together) centers on the fact that strong emotional relationships have to be learned, and the trial and error learning that can be painful. The loveless relationship between Leila's parents didn't give her much to work with initially, so there's plenty of error once she does head in that direction. But, once she starts looking at men above the waist, she can't look back. Unfortunately, the frustrated need for something more than physical contact and the incompetence at getting it comes out in tantrums.

I have no problem with pretty people getting physical, quite the opposite. I just didn't care for the junior-high emotional level housed in very adult bodies.

The only reason I'm reviewing it is because I saw it in my recommendations list and I had to try to save any other human being from wasting 2hours of their lives.

After watching it the first time, I remember thinking. ""What was the point?"" Then I watched it again, just to be fair, and therefore concluded that this was the dummest movie ever.

Another point worth mentioning. The lead role, who is having sex with this girl, has the smallest [...] I have ever seen on a man. If he knows his thing is so small, why do a movie with real sex scenes? You know that girl was faking it. Not to mention it was compeletly embarrasing that he was over in about 20 seconds.

2475172,5,B000DWMZLW,"Wow, for those who say the movie lacks depth or emotion are you ever wrong!  I thought this would be the perfect movie to psycho-analyze in my Women's Studies classes.  You have a young woman, Leila, who has sex because she seems to think the thrill of turning men on and pleasing them is what she wants.  But she really yearns for a relationship that she can derive pleasure from -- sexually & emotionally (she doesn't get that last part until later).  As a result, we often see her masturbating, and toward the end, forcing a guy to please her sexually in order to fulfill that need for pleasure.  But she's never satisfied (because she's not fulfilling the emotional cavity).  Then she meets David.  When he sees her, he is immediately attracted to her sexually, and they hook up based on that.  Thus, Leila continues to use sex as her means of connecting.  But, something is different with this guy.  Not only does she enjoy sex with him (not just pleasuring him), she starts to feel an emotional connection seeing him care for his Dad.  She doesn't know what to do with these feelings.  All she knows how to do is ""f---.""  So when David needs her most, she leaves him.  And though he was initially attracted to her based on sex, he wants more.  When he realizes she can't/won't give it to him, he gets angry and doesn't take her back.  Leila realizes sex alone is not satisfying; she needs David as a true companion.  David realizes he loves Leila, and desperately wants to learn who she is.  In the end, he tracks her down and sees her among family & religious tradition -- a very personal side of her.  She runs away, scared to let him see that same vulnerability he had shown her (it always seemed easy just to f---). But David refuses to let her go, and we realize these two are going to be okay.

This movie is about understanding extremely sexual people and their search to make themselves whole by connecting with another person. No doubt what they are really searching for is another extremely sexual person. But they are also going to use their bodies to test other people until they find the right person. If that's not OK with you, then don't watch the movie. You won't like it. But if you want to see how two extremely sexual people discover that they are complete by each other, then you'll love it.

Not only was it daring and bold but it was sexually stimulating, breathtakingly sensual and emotionally moving. The character study of both David and Leila was in depth and the storyline of the two characters needing each other, yet, needing to learn how to love each other and to be loved was stunning.

The nudity and sexual encounters in the movie only added to its intensity and were never overdone nor just blantant sex. Every moment was full of meaning and the characters emotions.

2475198,3,B000DWMZLW,"To be honest, I am not really sure what to think about this movie. The characters are so damaged, so confused and unsure of their feelings, desires, actions and of what they want that, as a viewer, we are not only confused, we are unsure as to whether we want these characters to be together or as far as possible from each other.

The movie is about Leila, a happily unattached girl in her 20s who enjoys sex without any deeper emotions or commitment. It is not that Helena fear commitment, it is just that it appears as if she has not experienced it. She goes through her days enjoying casual sex until David, another quite messed up guy with abandonment issues, comes along.

Now, a woman that cannot commit and a man with abandonment issues make up a rather difficult couple. The movie goes along showing their weird relationship. Their meetings, as well as their experiences all seem rather fleeting and trying to grab on to ""the moment"" that, for this movie, is simply not there. They start a relationship based on very little and become quite attached and involved in a relationship that neither is ready for.

As I mentioned before, I am not sure what to really think about this movie, nor am I sure if I liked it. I felt rather conflicting thoughts and feelings about it and about the resolution I would have wanted to see.

That is more evident in movies then in any other source of entertainment. If you want porn, you could view it as such.

2475202,4,B000DWMZLW,"The movie opens with a topless redhead in fishnet stockings masturbating while watching porn.  It pretty much sets the tone for the entire movie.

Lie with Me follows the daily exploits of a porn and sex addicted whore named Leila who fills days and nights with sex, drugs, clubbing and bad acting.  She has Sex in the City monologues, as someone in search of intense and unending pleasure, without Sarah Jessica Parker's tone, fake coolness, horrible wardrobe, or resemblance to a horse.  Although, she does come off as self-absorbed, confused, ignorant, and lost while thinking she is aware of herself and her needs...so I guess they are pretty similar afterall.  But the comparison ends there, because Lauren Lee Smith blows SJP out of the water otherwise.

Leila relives her early promiscuity while courting a guy who looks like Luigi from Mario Brothers; he's the next guy to whom she'll eventually give VD.  To woo her new found love (read: lust) interest, she performs a striptease at a playground and begins some mutual masturbation.  She even goes so far as to give a BJ and have sex with a guy in a parking lot while Luigi performs similarly with his current girlfriend in a car (first dual BJ & dual penetration in non-porn history!).

Anyway, she manages to land her guy, and has sex with him despite the fact that she has spent less than a day with him and said less than two sentences to him.  She has the poor man's versions of dependancy and dominance issues Maggie Gyllenhall had in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secretary/dp/B00008DDSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secretary</a>.  She tries to be edgy by saying cock instead of penis, but even in the face of unimpressive, full-frontal male nudity, it still feels forced and contrived for some sort of shock value that simply doesn't hold firm.

The movie is devoid of acting, character development, script, or story;  it's insipid nonsense shoved in between good sex scenes that were obviously the puprose of the movie.

Perhaps what irritated me the most about this movie is the stupidity of the ill-fitting emotional content of the movie.  There is no real need to give Luigi any sort of family story line, nor Leila.  And to make her shy, or him jealous, is completely preposterous, especially when the basically fell in love between yawns and two sexual encounters.

2475215,1,B000DWMZLW,"What can I say? I'm sure I bought this for the same reason everyone else did, and boy what a let-down.

 Not to be ignorant or apathetic, I will focus my review on the film as a whole, not just the much talked about ""graphic scenes of real sex"" *cough cough*.

 Allow me first to point out all the good things, then all the bad:

 GOOD: The female lead is gorgeous.

 That's it.

 I guess the score has its charm too, but only cos it's always set to shots of her attractive face, so I'm gonna lump that all in as one bullet point.

 NOT SO GOOD: Where do I start? Although the girl is very attractive, the scenes of her having sex are not in the least bit exciting, so she might as well not be.

 The male lead is UTTERLY miscast, as a romantic lead, as an erotic lead, this guy totally misses the mark on ALL counts. And did I say romantic? Come to think of it, did I even say erotic?? Sorry guys but this film is a big fat neither. The much hyped ""real"" sex scenes are nothing short of completely pathetic, with not a single sexual encounter between the two ""stars"" (of which there are only two or three in the whole film) lasting more than a minute - literally, a 60 second minute. And these aren't artfully composed edited highlights, these are beginning-to-end realtime scenes. Think I'm kidding?

 I can understand the first time they're together and there's all this sexual tension and electricity and lust (although as a viewer I just had to assume this, I certainly didn't feel any of it coming from the two actors) and the guy just can't contain himself, but this and every subsequent time they're together he finishes in less than a minute.

 Which leads to another thing; throughout the film the girl narrates a contrived monologue sprinkled liberally with new-age promiscuous pleasure-seeking slang, this girl obviously thinks highly of herself sexually, yet the whole point of the film is that she becomes consumed by physically being with a man who cannot last more than 60 seconds in the sack. Even within the shallow parameters set by the film itself, this film fails to convince; and on any real level beyond that, it completely falls flat on its face. At one point he tells her he thinks about her all day and all night etc. etc. and I was left thinking ""Whu?"". There's just no passion between these two whatsoever, not as people, and not as bodies in a bedroom either. The simple and usually obvious dialogue is left to convince us of something entirely lacking in any other place we might look for it.

 At one point after being with the guy the girl tells us, ""I always thought a man loved with his c_ck"", as if she now knows real love and a man who can love her with something other than his c_ck, after what? A one night stand with a guy whose only interest was to have sex with you??? How does that work?

 Well, quite simply, it doesn't. Neither does the rest of this film. Not for a second.

 If you're only interested in the real sex scenes, I can open a raincloud on your parade and tell you that the films entire sex scenes tally less than a few minutes, and are utterly uninteresting anyway. If you're interested in this film in a more holistic way, I can tell you that you're barking up an even wronger tree.

 If this review is all over the place it is only cos the film itself is an equal mess.

 STAY AWAY!",1185667200,121,3341,4.353796445880453
2475216,5,B000DWMZLW,"Lie With Me is more than just lust and sex. David for example doesn't know what he wants they show him with his dad, which we know is an invalid. He has trust issues just like Leila. When he first sees her, I think that he is infautated with her. He helps her at the party when she becomes dizzy, he watches her when she is walking through that wooded area. Basically he is in love with her. When Leila is having sex with that guy he can't help but feel lust for her at first. I mean the guy watches her and then they make a connection. Leila is dealing with the collaspe of her parents marriage and struggling with herself and what she wants. She meets David and she feels actual love i mean she can't be away from him for one second without wanting to feel him. She talks about how when she has sex that she can feel the pleasure inside of her but wants to feel something completely different with someone else. You guessed it that someone is David she wants to love him but she doesn't know how that is why she leaves him. Then she realizes how much she wants to be with him and he pushes her away. She is persistant and then she shows herself to him. In turn he rips out her heart and tells her he doesn't want to be with her, but that is all a lie cause the hurt in his eyes shows through. I think that Leila freaks out because she doesn't know how to comfort him when his dad dies, because you comfort the ones you love in their time of need. Plus i think Eric Balfour has a nice everything in that movie. Both are passionate towards each other even in those scenes when he gets jealous or is still grieving he hurts and the one person who he loves, leaves him. I don't think that he needs a mommy i thinks he needs a lover and someone to show him who he is. Also when they show Leila like having sex form behind i think that she is scared to let someone make actual love to her but David changes that i mean he asks her out on a date. You don't date someone you just want to have sex with. I love this movie i mean yeah theres graphic nudity but its hot and steamy and the actors make David and Leila come to life.

2475217,5,B000DWMZLW,"I bought this movie out of curiosity.  I love this movie because of the range of emotions many of us experience when one desires and loves.  Virgo uses long scenes with few cuts and dialogue to show what's felt when one falls for another.  There's lust, attachment, uncertainty, and resolution.  The movie shows how one may grow or regress because of these feelings.  Rather than lots of dialogue, Virgo uses the nonverbal communication to show what's felt - the trembling of the lips with anticipation, the attachment to another when kissing their arm while asleep, or the misery and disconnect from being without the other.  The plot is simple, but many of us have felt the contents of the movie at some point in time.  This movie is the first that has delved into the depth of these feelings and put it brillantly on film.

If you're looking for erotic scenes, they're definitely there, and add to the content of the movie.  However, if you're thinking this movie is about nothing but sex, you're misled.

Lie With Me will make you think and feel for these characters.  Take the 90 minutes; it's worth the time.",1182556800,22,1114,4.661538461538462
2475218,2,B000DWMZLW,"I've learnt to spot the danger signs of an impending bad movie. One of them is when the director is also the screenwriter and producer -- in short, there's no one there to put the brakes on when the film starts to get too self-absorbed. Such is the case with this Canadian indie film that seems to have gone straight to video.

Based on Tamara Berger's novel of the same name (published by the appropriately named Gutter Press), we meet Leila (Lauren Lee Smith), a young woman at a party. She's more than a little tipsy, and looks to be on the scrawny side, dressed clearly with the message that she's there to get laid -- oops, I mean have a good time. One man there is pretty bold about eyeing her, and the pair end up in the bathroom, where he helps her to sober up a little with a drink of water. It almost turns into sex, but his girlfriend calls for him outside and he leaves. He, we find out, is named David (Eric Balfour).

She leaves the party, taking with her Shy Guy (Michael Facciolo), and proceeds to have sex with him outside, up against a chain-link fence. Sitting in his car, watching the pair, is none other than David, along with his girlfriend. David and Leila watch each other getting laid, mimicing each others actions, as it were. At this point, I had a pretty good idea of what this film was going to be about, but as I have this thing about finishing the book or film I start, I didn't turn it off right away.

Eventually, Leila and David meet up again, this time in a public playground, and in a daring moment, she exposes herself to him, making her own interest pretty well known. They move onto his apartment for sex, and the sexual compulsion between the two of them gets going. And in fact that's what most of this film is about -- we're either watching Leila and David going at it like deranged rabbits, or she's letting us know her thoughts and experiences in a voice over that supposed to be titillating and erotic, but sounds more like a bad memoir.

The relationship is pretty predictable -- lust, jealousy phase, playing house together phase, she tries to get it past sex, he withdraws and treats her like trash, they break up, and so on and so forth. Yawn. We've seen this before. While I have to say that the sex at least looks real and honest, the rest of the film isn't that interesting. David, in particular, strikes me as the sort of young man that is fashionable these days -- unshaven, grungy and without any visible means of support. He does take care of an elderly, ailing father, so I guess that's something in his favour. But who in their right mind goes about in dirty jeans without underwear? I had a strong urge to go dip him in a vat of lye.

Leila's not much better. She's perpetually rumpled in skimpy clothing that looks to be ready to fall off at anytime. It's a cheap and sleazy look, and if she's looking for true love or respect from men, it's not a way to really inspire it either. Her personal life isn't that much better -- her parents are going through a divorce, her job is a dead-end job, she seems to spend her free time on the couch watching porn, or partying it up with weed and alcohol. She's not someone I would really care to know in reality either.

In short, this is a couple made for each other. Neither one of them are very responsible, and frankly, he treats her like a piece of meat. I suppose this is what makes this a modern, young adult relationship, sex without strings or emotion. And while the sex does get interesting, I've seen far far better in x-rated film, the only thing this lacks is what is known as the money shot in the trade.

Indeed, Virgo tries to make this as arty as possible, with lots of soft lighting, on location shots in Toronto, use of colour and texture, and I guess that works. But there isn't any sort of plot in this except for the so-called romance between the two leads, and their sexual shenanigans. Oh, there's an attempt or two with the illness of one parent, and the impeding divorce, but the central relationship is so tawdry, the viewer is left with the attitude of so what? by the end.

I don't demand syrupy romance, as long as there is some sort of passion there, but these two are so out of touch with themselves, how can they possibly make it work with each beyond the rubbing together of two body parts? That was the other big complaint with this one -- no one hits a climax that fast, and here it's the slam-bam-thankee-ma'am sort of sex. I kept thinking that she must have had insides of old leather to put up with that.

This is not for children of any age, and I would suspect that most adults would find it a bit on the disturbing side. There is quite a bit of sex in this, with male and female frontal nudity, sex in public, public exposure, sex in public, in cars, with lots of foul language and every form of straight sex that can be performed. There's plenty of drug and alcohol abuse as well. But they do try with a bit of condom use -- after all, this is the age of safe sex, I suppose.

No subtitles, some lackluster trailers for other films, and a voice-over commentary from the director. Nothing really special to watch either.

This is certainly a D-list film. Those who prefer their film to have sex and be honest about it might find a few minutes worth watching, but this 100-minute clunker has nothing else going for it. Those who are looking for a love story will be turned off by the callous brutality and attitudes. It's not a likeable film at all, and I urge you to spend your time with something, anything, else.

2475219,5,B000DWMZLW,"I saw this movie on cable one night and couldn't help but purchase it on DVD. There were some elements that if you take them one by one, are not great by itself, but taken as a whole, it sorta worked. The 2 main characters were openly flawed; both had their own background stories,  but to me, the movie was really about the heroine. Leila (Lauren Lee Smith) was your typical hookup girl. She looks like a disheveled model with committment issues, and she has a face that sorta grows on you-- she's not pretty right away. She also doesn't say anything new (how guys don't feel love, all they think about is sex blah blah), but just like what my title suggests, it's something you can't help but watch anyway. Part of that feeling too is that the two protagonists look like they can be a real-life couple. They both look like models, but not typical (annoying) Abercrombie, just good-looking without trying too hard. David (Eric Balfour) did his part of looking good and sexy...I didn't focus on his acting too much; He certainly looked desirable enough that would merit the fuss over him. I really appreciated the scenes that showed sexual restlessness; it's late in the afernoon, there's-nothing-to-do-and-I'm-lonely/frisky and Leila is by herself...It was a relief to see that after a rebuff, Leila didn't go out shopping or hang out with the girls and sputter self-righteous crap.",1181347200,18,1383,4.7866108786610875

The movie is also helped by a subplot showing the young man taking care of his invalid dad, which for a few minutes here and there allows us to view scenes not about self-centered lust.  At about 90 minutes, ""Lie With Me"" doesn't overstay its welcome (but just barely), though I wouldn't recommend it for anything more than a rental.  The DVD features a crisp yet warm widescreen image, a commentary by the film makers, and or two other modest extra features.",1174608000,15,951,4.5
2475224,2,B000DWMZLW,"An interesting film about a sexually charged woman who takes control of the situations.  It is all right, but the film is really more in the amateur category than of a finely crafted film.  Some obvious gaps in continuity, perhaps due to the short shooting schedule.  Avoid the commentary, as the director is so full of himself, and Lauren Smith mainly laughs and giggles.

On the positive side, a lot of the movie is conveyed without dialogue, and I am referring to the tension between the characters.

Are the people attractive?  Yes.  Is the story conveyed interestingly?  Pretty well.  Are there better movies to spend 93 minutes with?  Yes.  Was it a wasted 93 minutes?  Not really.",1171756800,6,687,4.777777777777778
2475225,5,B000DWMZLW,"For once a film that shows character development that is worth watching.  It has fantastic sex scenes between a man and a woman that will knock your socks off.  The characters are ""real"" and and draw you into the film like an excellent film should:  No violence.  Absolutely no violence.  Which is wonderful -- I love the conflict between the two characters when the woman is American and kind of an air head -- but she has the ""English Gentleman"" wrapped around her finger.  He loves her so much -- and she does love him.  However, was it enough to keep them together?  You will have to watch the movie to see.  The punk rock band was fantastic -- It made me feel like I was right their in England -- being one of the groupies just hanging out.  I love how the movie made the ""couple"" the center of attention when they needed to be -- yet it has a way of viewing them as just part of the crowd that you would never pick out -- just an ordinary couple having a very extraordinary relationship.  Since I like a movie with a lot of classy sex scenes and with lots of music with no violence what so ever.  It is a must see.",1171756800,8,1120,4.158139534883721
2475226,2,B000DWMZLW,"I commend the director, producer(s) and actors for being daring.  It would be great to see risks of thematics and/or action (no pun intended) in other even mainstream movies -- ""Closer"" was close, but J. Roberts never, ahem, bumped or grinded on screen.  Unlike ""Closer,"" the dialogue in this one was LAME.",1169078400,3,306,4.865384615384615

While you will see boobs, dick, and butt, the three don't come in contact for the viewer to see. Overall, this is a farely decent movie that will help get your sex drive going.",1168819200,4,316,3.876923076923077

2475229,3,B000DWMZLW,"It was not at all what I expected, but for an independent film it's alright, it has a storyline, not a very interesting one but none the less a storyline.

2475230,3,B000DWMZLW,"There is alot of penis in this movie, wow, the other reviews are all correct, more skin than the playboy channel, even late night showtime adult movies. Everything except actual penetration.

As far as the rest of the movie this is far from standard hollywood movie direction, and it is film purposefull in this alternative style. For lots it is a let down, as the story line is very simple. Minimal dialog. If the direct was serious about this style of directing, it was a noble attempt with the subject matter. Otherwise this film is just soft porno.

Interesting movie, to each their own money.",1162252800,17,597,4.6761904761904765
2475231,5,B000DWMZLW,"Fans of actor / musician Eric Balfour, who has played in
a number of character roles, most famously as Claire Fischer's
troubled boyfriend ""Gabe"" in the landmark HBO series ""Six Feet Under"",
will love this film because you get to see this sexy hottie
in all of his god-given finery! (WOOF!!)
I mean, the plot is kind of paper thin, but who cares!!
I would've bought it for the realistic sex scenes alone!
Which I'm not sure if they were acting in them because...
well, buy it and you'll see for yourself!
Eric shows everything!...frontal, rear and even an erection
in at least 8 different hot scenes!
This dude is FINE!!
That scene where he's salsa dancing with the girl
in the complete buff!---OMG!!
The acting does get better towards the end when Eric's
character's father dies and he and the female lead's sexual
relationship begins to disintergrate into something unexpected.
Overall though, I liked this movie and didn't feel
short-changed at all! Eric Balfour cut through my usual
cool mature veneer and got right to my inner lustful teenager!",1160092800,27,1049,4.833333333333333
2475232,5,B000DWMZLW,"This movie is very close to real life and what people think in thier minds about each other when they first meet. We all develop relationships in different ways. What I also found interesting about this movie is the ""balance of interest"" between the two people and how it shifts back and forth throughout the movie.  People that won't like this movie probably have never lived life to it's fullest. Eric Balfour is also very pleasing to the eye.",1159574400,7,445,4.632911392405063

2475234,4,B000DWMZLW,"This movie takes you on a roller coaster ride of sexual banality.  While the two protagonists are pretty to look at (and you do get to look at them front and back, up and down) it's the slick sick overlay of the girl's narration that really lifts it above a porn flick.  Just barely, pardon the pun.  Yet it is hypnotic in some strange way.  You can't pull your eyes away from the train wreck.  You can't stop looking at the victims. I guess because you're suprised that an actor and actress of this caliber would expose themselves voyeuristically this early in their careers.",1154908800,8,576,4.5
8102643,3,B000DWMZLW,"The movie is okay.  The plot is not overly complicated (a sexually adventurous woman, meets an emotionally complicated guy and the two try to have a relationship), and the writing is pretty weak.  The visuals are pretty good (for a low-budget indie film) and while it is slow in parts the does not seem much longer than the hour and a half running time.  There is a lot of sex in the movie and it borders on being graphically explicit.  There is full frontal nudity, both male, and female, so if that is a dealbreaker for you, this is not for you at all.

The US version of the film is almost impossible to find at a reasonable price since the DVD is now out of print.  If you look around you can get international versions (I got the UK version), but you just have to make sure you have a region free DVD or blu ray player in order to play the disc.",1522972800,,850,4.152439024390244
