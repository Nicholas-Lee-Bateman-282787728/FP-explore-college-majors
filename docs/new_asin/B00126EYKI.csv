8244234,5,B00126EYKI,For Adults.  Purchased as a gift for a hockey family and they enjoyed the sit-com but said there wasn't as much hockey involved as expected.  Wouldn't recommend for children.,1385251200,,174,4.9655172413793105
8244235,4,B00126EYKI,"Compelling name for the main character.  Cake has had prior personal ""conflicts"" resulting in the need for some form of life direction.  Hence, the ""code"".

Cake, while working as a barista at Cafe Primo, runs a temp agency of sorts for hockey goalies.  Goalies gather at the cafe waiting for the phone to ring and a day job as a gun for hire.  Note this this is not the NHL.  Goalies are rented for pick up games, recreation league games, etc.

Adding to the mix is that the owner of Cafe Primo (a friend to Cake, as well as an employer) may be connected to the local mafia, Cake having an on-again-off-again affair with the owners recently arrived buxom daughter Francesca, a claustrophobic goalie, a girl goalie (played by Mayko Nguyen of Regenesis fame et al) and a rival goalie rental firm run by an arch nemesis.

Fun show that relies on wit and situational comedy.  This is a 3-season series of which only the first series is easily available.  If you hunt seasons 2-3 can be found.",1336521600,,989,4.50561797752809
8244236,4,B00126EYKI,Rent-A-Goalie was in short entertaining.  It lacked chemistry between the cast and came off a little cheesy due to performances and bad writing and plot concept.  I rated it high based on the show premise and being a hockey fanatic myself.  I would only recommend to curious hockey fans though I am still interested in seeing the second season.,1325030400,2,344,4.796610169491525
8244237,5,B00126EYKI,This has to be one of the best newer shows out of Canada.  It really is too funny. It may take you a few episode to get to know all the characters but it is worth the effort. My only complaint is that only the first season is available.,1265328000,,236,3.816326530612245
