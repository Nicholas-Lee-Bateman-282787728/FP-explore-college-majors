6205296,5,B00HSMO37Y,"I cannot say enough good stuff about this DVD/CD. I remember the Jazz/Funk/Fusion era and honestly I did not like it except for a few albums. HOWEVER, Bonamassa has made a DVD/CD that updates the style and makes it GROOVE!

Joe also has Ron De Jesus along on ""rhythm guitar"" - he's actually strong enough to carry most any band and Ron and Joe do some great guitar interplays together (just watch the dvd) These guys have played with all the great musicians of this genre.

This album may be even BETTER than their studio We Want to Groove - the band has been playing longer and I like their live sets better than the studio album, IMO. Plus, seeing their interplay LIVE really makes the music come alive.

ahhh ... one more thing this music really got my wife and I into kissing and dancing and that turned into a long and very fun time making love!  You can definitely get into a groooove out of this! Try it - but with your own sweetheart :)

6205349,5,B00HSMO37Y,Just awesome music by some high caliber musicians. Sound quality and footage is 1st grade quality. These guys jammed at the Baked Potato in Hollywood. We locals are very proud if these guys. Everybody in the band holds their ground and more. Their versions of the cover songs is outstanding. I haven't taken the CDs out of my car and the DVD is still in my Blue Ray!!!!,1399852800,,369,4.4411764705882355

6205352,4,B00HSMO37Y,"I would have given 5 stars, but I would have liked to hear the players really cut loose a little. It is impressive how tight this group is and I would love for them to follow up with another session.",1397001600,,199,4.0
6205353,5,B00HSMO37Y,The concert was great. Different stuff for Joe.  I like his electrical blues and acoustic better. But this was a fresh breath of fresh Blues,1396742400,2,140,4.6
6205354,5,B00HSMO37Y,"I listened to the audio of this set a few times before watching the Blu-Ray and really enjoyed it. The video provided a completely different perspective. I had no idea how much talent and artistry there was on the audio tracks. Joe Bonamassa, always a master, plays at a level I have not seen with him before. Ron DeJesus' guitar work was exquisite.

They say 'speed kills' and these guys killed it with speed. In the final song Tal Bergman's drum solo was so fast, his hands and arms are just a blur - while his head barely moves. I am not typically a fan of drum solos, but that visual was worth the price of the Blu-Ray. The keyboards and bass were also amazing. I get the whole funk dimension, but in some ways this album is reminiscent of Frank Zappa's fusion work. I am not sure I like all the songs, but the talent was so mesmerizing, I cannot look away. It is an outstanding piece of work.",1396569600,5,897,4.276470588235294
6205355,5,B00HSMO37Y,This DVD blows the top off any room you watch it in!  Superb musicians having fun- funky grooves- highly recommended!,1396137600,,117,4.85

6205357,5,B00HSMO37Y,"I cannot say enough good stuff about this DVD/CD. I remember the Jazz/Funk/Fusion era and honestly I did not like it except for a few albums. HOWEVER, Bonamassa has made a DVD/CD that updates the style and makes it GROOVE!

Joe is playing with some well respected musicians like Ron De Jesus along on ""rhythm guitar"" - he's actually strong enough to carry most any band and Ron and Joe do some great guitar interplays together (just watch the dvd)  Each of guys have played with all the great musicians of this genre and now Joe is bringing it forward.

This album may be even BETTER than their studio We Want to Groove - the band has been playing longer and I like their live sets better than the studio album, IMO. Plus, seeing their interplay LIVE really makes the music come alive. You have to watch the DVD.

ahhh ... one more thing this music really got my wife and I into kissing and dancing and that turned into a long and very fun time making love!  You can definitely get into a groooove out of this! Try it :)
