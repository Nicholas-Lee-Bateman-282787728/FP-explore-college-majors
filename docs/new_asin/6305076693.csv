963372,3,6305076693,"None of the Casper movies that came after CASPER(starring Bill Pulman and Christina Ricci)are as good,but this is still cute. Casper the Friendly Ghost meets Wendy the Good Little Witch,and they form a friendship.(There is a wicked wizard called somebody Spellman in this and I figure he must be a relative of Sabrina..??)",1032307200,,322,5.09433962264151
963373,5,6305076693,"This is an excellent family movie.  Casper has been a childhood classic for many-a-year, and always seems to become updated with the times.  He is one cartoon character you can't help but love, and could appreciate if he were really to exist.  This is like a sequal to the Casper that featured Christina Ricci.  Instead, this time around we have Hillary Duff.  Ms. Duff plays Wendy, The Good Little Witch.  She lives with her aunts, who are essentially more mis-behaved than she is.  Due to some ""trouble"" Wendy doesn't start, the quartet is forced to take a vacation, and do so at the Sunny Brite Resort...the same place Casper and his uncles, The Ghostly Trio, are headed to as well.  Eventually Casper and Wendy do meet up and become friends, despite what their guardians have said about the other parties.  To try to make a change for the better, a plan is constructed to have the witches meet up with the ghosts.  As a result, the friendship is tested, and in the end....well, not to spoil it, but you can probably guess what does happen, as this is a movie for young and old alike.  For the most part, this movie is great.  It's an amazing feel-good flick that anyone can enjoy.  Hillary as Wendy puts the movie in an even better light.  I suggest anyone who enjoys good family entertainment check out this movie.  Casper movies are always a treat, and it's a wonder who he'll be meeting up with next??",1009152000,4,1408,4.531746031746032
963374,4,6305076693,"i was flipping throught the channals,  on cable,  and i got in on the last half of the movie. i remember in the casper comics,  wendy is refered to as ""wendy, the good little witch"".  it does not say that  she is teen witch. i loved casper the movie.  i think the idea is original and fun. im 29 years old and love all types of movies. i fell in love with cathy moriatry (sp) when i saw her in soapdish.  (by the way that movie really needs to be on dvd) i was very impressed by the special affects the move had to offer. i really recommend this movie for the entire family.",999993600,,574,3.982456140350877
963375,1,6305076693,"FIRST of all, Wendy has got to be the youngest teen-age witch I've seen in a looooong time! And what was up with that red thing? It seemed to me like the movie makers got bored with this whole idea. The Josh kid was retarted, he acted like he owned Wendy after talking to her for less than a minute, and the witches attitudes were pointless and farfetched. The whole basis for the movie was weak, the witches and ghosts reasons for hating eachother were totally stupid. I must admit that the scene at the dance was funny, but this story moved much to fast, and was all in all retarted. Wendy didn't seem at all upset when she found out about the Mystic Abyss, and the oracle and the warlock was pointless. Hilary Duff did a good job as Wendy, but the plot was a sad excuse of a Casper Movie.",972172800,,791,4.2105263157894735

Ironically Halligan is still credited in the closing. This is disappointing because no Casper movie is complete without the theme song.

964067,5,6305076693,"Casper Meets Wendy is a 1998 direct-to-DVD family comedy based on the Harvey Comics characters and a continuation of the Casper movie series. Featuring a stellar all-star cast(George Hamilton, Teri Garr, Cathy Moriarty, Shelley Duvall, Richard Moll, Alan Thicke, Ben Stein, and Pauly Shore)and the acting debut of Hilary Duff(Lizzie McGuire). In this movie Casper and his uncles  spend the summer at a vacation resort and much to Casper's displeasure, the Ghostly Trio start scaring the people. There, Casper befriends a shy little girl named Wendy(Duff), who happens to be a witch, and her aunts(Garr, Duvall, and Moriarty) are actually enemies of Casper's uncles. Now, Casper and Wendy must bring peace to both their familes, and to make things worse, a diabolical warlock named Desmond Spellman(Hamilton)has his sights set on Wendy and will stop at nothing to rid the world of her. The special features includes a behind the scenes featurette and trailers of other Fox family films.

I dislike the feelings that Wendy's aunts treat their niece like she has no friends and her family treats her to be a witch and not being with a friends that she made so far.

964154,5,6305076693,"When I got it in the mail I immediately began to watch it. It left a strong impact on me. I have never seen such a nice, cute and touching film as this one. Hilary Duff was excellent as Wendy. I could watch this film all day if I had to. This film also rekindled my interest in Casper and Wendy and someday I will buy a plush of both of them and they will be my computer mascots. Very nice movie with a great message of friendship, I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice family film to watch with their children or looking for a film in you which you can show sympathy for the characters.

I also recommend the episodes of the New Casper Cartoon Show, which also features Casper and Wendy. The only way to see the episodes of the show is on YouTube and I think they have been released on DVD with the rest of the older Casper cartoons.

Very nice movie that will have a special place in my heart. It may not be as classic as the original Casper movie but it is still a well done film that needs more credit then what it deserved.",1326672000,,1041,4.024154589371981
964155,5,6305076693,I remember when I was six years old and it was the first time I saw this movie and I loved it ever since. It takes place after the first film. Casper and his uncles are on vacation and Casper is not having a good time and his uncles are scarying everyone and bullying him a little bit. Mean while Wendy and her aunts are on the run from Desmond Spellman an evil wizard who want to kill Wendy so he can be the most powerful sorcerer in the world and Wendy won't. Wendy and Casper while they get upset all of a sudden meet each other and have a fun day and plot to get Wendy's aunts and Caspers Uncles together so they can get a long cause ghosts and witches don't get a long. I won't give away too much because not everyone has seen the movie. But this film is great for all ages and you'll laugh a lot during it. This is also Hilary Duff's first movie as Wendy!,1319414400,,861,3.9826589595375723

The story is kind of cute, but the script and direction are unbearable for anyone over 10! I'm giving it two stars because I think it deserves one and my daughter thinks it deserves four.",1263168000,,349,4.303030303030303

964223,2,6305076693,"This movie is a great family film, however if your a fan of the original movie you'd think it sucks. I didn't like it for many reasons.

1. It didn't fit the original story of the first movie.

 2. The casting was interesting but the acting was bad.

 3. The CGI animation was really bad and it was made three years after the first movie.( I don't blame them, it was a straight to DVD release)

 4. They never fully explain the reason way there has been a long rivalry with ghost and witches.

 5. Finally it was a prequel/sequel and A Spirited Beginning was really horrible. ( Which is why I am not bothering making a review on it)

 Saban should have just stuck with Power Rangers and not have done Casper and all those other Harvey Cartoon Live-Action films because Universal was way better at doing Caper. I will say this, the casting was pretty good but they did a poor job doing this movie. I bet if they would have came up with a better story if they had more time to do the movie. Since it was the Sequel to A Spirited Beginning and not to the first movie it was turn to complete trash. My suggestion don't buy it unless you like it or you have children how might like it.",1232841600,,1180,4.176991150442478
964224,4,6305076693,"Some people might think I'm too old for this movie, but I don't care! I like it! It's really good and really funny! A dark warlock named Desmond wants to kill Wendy, because in the future, she will be the most powerful witch to ever exist. While she's in hiding with her three witch-aunts, she meets Casper, who's on vacation with his three uncles. Witches and ghosts usually hate each other, but Casper and Wendy become best friends. Wendy uses a little bit of her magic, and Desmond finds her. With the help of Casper, Casper's uncles, and Wendy's aunts, they try to help save her from Desmond.

964225,5,6305076693,"Four words, I love Hilary Duff.

Even though Hilary was only 11 yrs old in this movie she was a great actress. This was the second movie she did. She just looks so cute as Wendy and she was a great choice and I love the story that she tells about when she was on set and there was a goat there named Meaner and they were shooting a scene and the director kept yelling Meaner Meaner and Hilary thought he was talking to her so she made a mean face and tried to be meaner and that story makes me laugh every time.

I recommend this to anyone who loves a good family movie. I am a little older then Hilary is now but I remember watching this when I was younger and just loved it and I still consider it one of my favorites.

Just keep doing what you do best Hilary, because you Rock!!!!",1194134400,7,783,3.9745222929936306

Wish I had done it sooner, that's for sure!

The DVD came sooner than I expected, if you can believe that, was in perfect condition and was thouroghly enjoyed by my son.",1163030400,,408,4.230769230769231
964288,4,6305076693,"Being 16, I have lived through the first Casper and the horrid sequels. While I think that the first Casper mildly creeped me out when I was younger, and that majority of the sequels following that were horrible, I think that making Casper Meets Wendy was a great recovery for the creators of the original Casper. Bringing together well-known older actresses was a great choice, making it entertaining to see them in such whimsical roles, while Hilary Duff did a great job on one of her first acting jobs. While some of the one-liners may leave you rolling your eyes, it is a great childrens movie and will keep parents entertained as well.",1161993600,9,640,4.672566371681416

964290,4,6305076693,"""Casper Meets Wendy"" is the fun-filled story of everyone's favorite friendly ghost, Casper, and his very first encounter with Wendy the good little witch! When sweet little Wendy finds herself the target of an evil warlock's scheme to stay on top of the witchcraft game, she and her nasty aunts must hideout at a sunny vacation resort. To their ghost-hating dismay, it's the same resort where Casper and his uncles are spending a relaxing vacation away from the grind of their daily scaring routine. Wendy and Casper quickly realize they are kindred spirits and become fast friends, but their relatives will have no part in it. They'll all have to learn to work together though, once the wicked Desmond Spellman's goons pinpoint their location.

Fresh off the heels of ""Casper: A Spirited Beginning,"" family-friendly director Sean McNamara does himself one better in his second Casper outing, this time going for a stellar cast and all-out wackiness! The result should thrill the younger set, though it may prove too goofy for teens and adults who don't have a softer side for kids' stuff. Luckily, I'm a cartoon and family film lover, and, being an addict of the annual Halloween specials I grew up with, this direct to video offering is a real treat. Sure, it's loaded with moments that make you glad you're watching it alone, or wish that you were, there are bad jokes and bad acting to spare, but it also takes you back to the fun you had in your childhood with programs like ""The Worst Witch"" and ""The Halloween That Almost Wasn't"" (AKA ""The Night Dracula Saved the World""). The outlandish costumes and low-budget effects scream Halloween special, and how can you go wrong with George Hamilton evoking memories of ""Love At First Bite"" alongside the likes of Shelley Duvall, Teri Garr, Cathy Moriarty, Pauly Shore, Richard Moll, and Vincent Schiavelli. And, let's not forget my favorite person on the planet, Hilary Duff, in her first starring role! Yes, this is back before Lizzie McGuire, folks. The current girl of my dreams is cute as a button here in her early days as Wendy the good little witch!

The truth is, this film is not for everyone. It's direct to video quality in every way, but it's direct to video that works. How so? Well, yes, there's a high cheeze factor, and even my dreamgirl Hilary clearly shows her lack of experience at acting during the first half of the film (she surprisingly improves greatly partway through). True, some of the lines that are meant as jokes just don't seem to make sense or seem to be in the wrong context, or are utterly ridiculous to an annoying point. Then, you have Pauly Shore, who hardly seems to take his role in the film seriously. Still, what makes this film acceptable and entertaining, and makes all of its flaws acceptable too, is the fact that it is intended to be a kooky kids film. It's all about being silly, and it does its job well, while still pulling off the cutesy, feel-good friendship moments too. Now, if you sit down to watch ""Casper Meets Wendy"" expecting to view something along the lines of the Steven Spielberg big budget theatrical Casper film, then you're going to be disappointed. However, if you even mildly enjoyed ""Casper: A Spirited Beginning,"" or are just interested in anything starring Hilary Duff, you might want to give this one a look. The extras include the trailer for the feature, among others, and a nice little 6 minute and 39 second behind-the-scenes featurette. Pretty decent for a DVD that I would have expected to be bare bones. Pick up ""Casper Meets Wendy"" if you are a Casper fan, a Hilary fan, or are just looking for something cute to fill the void of a new Halloween special this year!",1129248000,,3693,4.724031007751938
