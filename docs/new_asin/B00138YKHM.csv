8249442,2,B00138YKHM,"I was looking for a DVD about the voyage from Seattle, WA to Juneau, AK.  This video has good image quality, but I was looking for more information on the journey, the boat and nature.

The ""movie"" is a collection of landscape shots of the Canadian and Alaskan waters of the Inside Passage; then set to overly dramatic music.  Considering the content of the film; it surprised me there were no ""deleted scenes"" segment on the DVD.

There is an option to watch the movie with director's comments.  I watched it first and found I enjoy the comments version better.  Directors comments gave me more information which really was what I was looking for to begin with...but still fell short.",1306108800,,685,4.666666666666667
8249443,5,B00138YKHM,"As a photographer Richard Olsenius has consistently shown that a ""picture is worth a thousand words;'' his portfolio is studded with award-winning images published throughout the world.

But, his video, ""Journey Along the Inside Passage"" is rather new, different and defining; it is an evocative blend of moving images and music that is palpably transcendent. ""Journey"" is a welcome respite -- 30 minutes to be far, far away; to be gently guided and gliding 1,000 miles northward from the bustle of Seattle to behold sanctuaries I've never seen: Bay Falls, Fitz Hugh Sound, Bishop, Hot Springs, Walkers Cove and Glacier Bay National Park.

In short -- a deeply sensual experience that refreshes mind, body and soul -- time and again.",1266364800,,733,5.1

8249445,5,B00138YKHM,"Journey Along the Inside Passage is not the typical travel DVD.  Extraordinary video set to compelling music gives the viewer a unique look and feel of the voyage on the Inside Passage.  Olsenius is a gifted videographer and composer.  His great talents in these areas, plus his love of land and water, make this unique presentation a true treat for anyone, whether you've experienced the Inside Passage first-hand or not.  The blend of video and music creates a compelling and restful presentation.  - Kent Kobersteen, former Director of Photography, National Geographic Magazine",1217462400,8,580,5.260869565217392
8249446,1,B00138YKHM,"Despite the above glowing review, I found the video boring, repetitious and average. The music at times was anything but relaxing. It could have been a journey down a river in Minnesota. Just when you get to the good really good scenery, the movie ends.",1206835200,,253,4.644444444444445
