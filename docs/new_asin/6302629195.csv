486830,5,6302629195,"I have neither bought nor viewed the import version described here, but I do want to second the opinion of the previous reviewer that Disney needs to officially release this on DVD!  It is a truly a gem of a picture made during a time when Walt Disney produced several live-action films in Britain.  The film contains terrific acting performances, a delightful plot, and evocative scenery.  For a while, the Disney Move Club (you have to become a member) was releasing several of these fantastic, lesser-known, live action features made by Walt as DMC Exclusives (such as The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men, The Fighting Prince of Donegal, Rob Roy: The Highland Rogue, and Kidnapped), but, sadly, their release of such Exclusives has apparently ground to a halt.

Please, Disney, consider releasing The Sword and the Rose either for a general retail release or a DMC Exclusive (even as a manufactured-on-demand product if thats what it takes to be released)!

UPDATE: The Sword and the Rose is available on DVD as an exclusive release via the Disney Movie Club as of December 14, 2010!",1278633600,7,1093,4.823529411764706
486831,3,6302629195,"This release by Hong Kong Video TRBOY is not a GREAT copy of the movie The Sword And The Rose, but it is not either a BAD copy either.

What is really needed is for DISNEY to officially release this movie on DVD.

I bought this version a while ago hoping that it would be as good a print as the LaserDisc version that Disney released back in the 1990s. But sadly it is not.

It is however at least as good as the VHS version.

GREAT NEWS!  Disney has released this title as one of their Disney Movie Club's DISNEY EXCLUSIVES, get that version not this one.

Here is the Disney Exclusives release:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sword-And-The-Rose/dp/B004HCOJZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sword And The Rose</a>",1273190400,7,822,5.69672131147541

486833,5,6302629195,"I love old movies.  They are a nice reference to a time when decency
played a much bigger part in the lifestyles of common people.  I love this movie;
fun and excitement.",1268352000,,170,4.28125
486834,4,6302629195,"It's Jolly Olde England, Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon are on the throne, and royal marriages are made to strengthen political ties.  Henry wants to cement an alliance with France by marrying his sister Mary to the aged King Louis XII, even though the spunky, flirtatious Mary has set her cap on Charles Brandon, a commoner.  Henry prevails, of course, after promising  that should Louis die, Mary can then wed anyone of her choosing.  As luck would have it, Louis dies a mere two months later, she marries Brandon, and they live happily ever after.

While ignoring any distasteful details about Henry VII, this 1953 Disney drama tells a simple and basically true story and showcases the talented and ber-perky Glynis Johns who plays the headstrong princess.  She does a fine job, but Richard Todd is a stiff and bland Brandon.  The movie clearly has a low budget and the sets look fake, but the costumes are pretty and the colors are vivid.

It's a simple, uncluttered tale that would make a pleasant introduction to the Tudors for children, adolescents and undemanding adults (like me).  Pleasant, non-violent, and wholesomely romantic - everything that a good Disney movie should be.",1207612800,5,1191,4.915
486835,4,6302629195,"This is an entertaining costume drama by Disney. Based upon actual historical events, though not quite historically accurate, it tells the love story of the Princess Mary, sister to Henry VIII, and Charles Brandon, a commoner and Captain of the Guard. It is a love made difficult by considerations of state, as well as by the evil machinations of the jealous Duke of Buckingham, who himself is in love with the Princess Mary. Forced to marry the decidedly elderly King of France, despite the fact that she loves Charles Brandon, Mary extracts a promise from Henry to allow her to marry the man of her choice, the second time around. Henry so promises, little knowing what would lie ahead.
Glynis Johns is perfectly charming as the outspoken and determined Princess Mary. Richard Todd is dashing as the handsome Charles Brandon with whom Mary falls in love. James Robertson Justice is a delightful Henry VIII, while Michael Gough is an unctiously evil Duke of Buckingham. This is a delightfully told story of true love that eventually triumphs. In typical Disney fashion, there are no objectionable scenes or language. A first rate production, it is a movie that is suitable for the entire family and highly entertaining.",1012694400,42,1220,4.95609756097561

486838,4,6302629195,"When you think of Disney and live action films, most of us think of ""Mary Poppins"" and ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"". These are great, great films and deserve to be remembered as such.
However, Disney made a lot more live-action films than most folks realize and this was one of them. In fact it is only one of THREE that Richard Todd starred in for them! I finally got to see it and it's not bad at all. Based on the true story of Elizabeth Tudor it's worth watching.",1425945600,,469,4.222222222222222

486841,5,6302629195,"True to my love of all things Glynis Johns, who stars as Henry VIII's sister Mary, this Disney classic is delightful to watch. Richard Todd does justice to the highly idealized and sanitized character of Henry Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, Mary's last husband, who in reality was a rapist and an utter bounder. The facts of the story are essentially correct, but the interpretation is strictly fairy tale.
By the way, ""The Rose"" or more precisely ""The Tudor Rose"" was Mary's nickname in France.",1413676800,,490,4.845238095238095

486843,1,6302629195,"Totally abandons true history--should have been presented as pure fantasy with no pretense any connection to the real people. For example, the real Charles Brandon was favored by the Tudors because his father had served well and died in service to the king at the Battle of Bosworth.  In this version, Brandon's father and brother are killed in a duel as part of a blood feud that has no basis in history.  The real history is more interesting than the tired clichs trotted out here.",1400544000,2,483,4.670588235294118
486844,4,6302629195,"It's always very interesting for me to watch historical movies, in this one the depiction of King Henry VIII is wonderful, he had a love/hate relationship with his sister Mary Tudor, in my opinion the most fascinating character is the Duke of Buckingham, ambiguous and ambivalent about Mary but she is very..stubborn and self-confident so even Charles Brandon must fall at her feet. Mary even disguises herlself as Brandon's page to embark in Bristol! The scenes of the duel between Brandon and the Duke are quite good, so I reccomend this movie to those who love adventure and dangerous liaisons",1399766400,,596,4.97
486845,5,6302629195,I am happy to have a DVD version of this romantic adventure.  The rendition is excellent.  Richard Todd and Glynis Johns superbly act the rolls.  A great entertaining movie!,1398297600,,173,4.896551724137931
486846,4,6302629195,"This fanciful retelling of history is very family friendly, though I doubt younger people would have any interest in this chaste romance.  Glynis Johns plays Mary Tudor, a bit of a tease who enjoys leading men on, particularly the deadly Duke of Buckingham (Michael Gough, no stranger to playing a stinker).  Into the court, during a heated wrestling match, comes Charles Brandon (Richard Todd).  Mary delights in having a new conquest and invites the commoner to a fancy ball.  Sadly, Mary is spoken for as a peace offering to Louis XII of France.  She marries the old geezer and systematically sets about rushing him to an early grave.  It was at this point that I began to suspect this tale was the Classics Illustrated version with no bearing on historical accuracy.  The fact is Charles Brandon was not a stranger to the court but a childhood friend of King Henry.  He was already a Viscount thanks to Henry.  And he was the guy who escorted Mary back to England after Louis died; the Duke of Buckingham was not involved in any of this.  Also, King Henry was not fat and old at this point in history; he was only 23.  Not that anyone could ever accuse Walt Disney of playing fast and loose with books he sought to adapt for the screen.

This film does have some rudimentary excitement, in particular a dandy sword fight on land and in sea!  But it is more humorous than romantic.  Not a bad effort.  Glynis Johns is fun and Michael Gough is appropriately slimy.  James Robertson Justice clearly enjoyed playing King Henry VIII.  This film is something I'd definitely watch again.",1395705600,,1584,4.640287769784172

486851,4,6302629195,DVD was good quality but the packaging was flimsy. The plastic pieces meant to hold the DVD in place were both broken & the DVD was sliding around in the case.

486852,3,6302629195,"First, I want to say that it is a good movie. It is somewhat comical in some places and is romantic. If you don't know the history of Mary Rose Tudor and Charles Brandon then it will be a good and enjoyable movie. However, if you do know the history (as I did when watching) it will be disappointing.

SPOILERS Alert (sort of)

Historically inaccuracies:

Instead of showing Mary and Charles growing up together as playmates with Henry, it portrays Charles as just coming into court for the first time right before Mary is to be married off.

It doesn't show or mention when Charles had to bring Mary into the French court (for Henry)to marry the French king.

They portray Charles as being somewhat of a pirate(in my opinion, which he was not.

From the way the movie is put together, it gives off the impression that Mary was only married to the French king for maybe a week. They were actually married for a coupe of months.

It shows Charles being sent to the tower, which of course never happened.

It shows Charles and Mary trying to run away on a ship to America, with Mary dressed as a man. This is completely inaccurate. I doubt Mary's Tudor pride and stubbornness would have allowed for this to even come close to occurring.",1374105600,2,1234,4.477678571428571

486858,4,6302629195,"I've grown up appreciating old time movies, thanks to my mother. I remember seeing this movie pop up from time to time on Disney at late nights. I fell in love with Charles Brandon long after he has been dead and I loved the gallantry and the costumes in the movie. After remembering it a few days ago, I decided to hunt down the movie online and found out Amazon had it for rent. I was thrilled to pieces to see it. I watched it on my iPad and it was great....while it lasted. There was nothing wrong with the movie itself but the streaming it was running under. It kept stopping and was choppy. It didn't diminish my love for the movie. Watch it if you love old movies and the quality they had back then. Hollywood doesn't make movies like this anymore!",1356825600,,755,4.25

486861,5,6302629195,"I'm grateful to the first reviewer for making me aware of this lovely film.  I'd known about (and I own the DVDs of) the other two Richard Todd / Disney swashbucklers, ""The Story of Robin Hood"", and ""Rob Roy: The Highland Rogue"" -- and enjoy both very much.  I've liked Richard Todd ever since seeing ""A Man Called Peter"", and being an longtime aficionado of swashbucklers, I was pleased to discover that he'd made a couple -- or, as it turns out, three!

""The Sword and the Rose"" is immensely enjoyable, assuming you have an affinity for classic swashbucklers from the 1930s through 1950s.  It's quiet by today's standards, and there's little actual swash (a wrestling scene at the opening and a brief rapier duel at the climax), but a compelling story with first-rate acting, humor, beautiful dialogue -- really, the words alone make the film -- and simply gorgeous costumes and cinematography (the latter by the acclaimed Geoffrey Unsworth).  Just as with Errol Flynn's ""Crossed Swords"", the clothing here is simply a joy to behold.  Frame after frame can be paused and lingered over, just for the pleasure of devouring the color and detail of the costumes.

Which is not to say the story isn't good, because it's top drawer.  Just don't expect historical accuracy, which is not the point of a swashbuckler and, more often than not, would defeat it.  This is the storybook Tudor era -- everybody's clean and has fine, white, straight teeth!  I, for one, am glad for it!",1340582400,10,1472,4.75984251968504

486863,5,6302629195,This is one of the  classic Disney  historical movies made.  It has an outstanding British  cast.  The acting is first rate and the story enjoyable.,1318636800,7,148,4.76
486864,5,6302629195,"After World War II to help get Britain on her feet, Hollywood studios were not allowed to remove profits from that country. They were ""encouraged"" to spend such earnings making films in the British Empire using the local talent. Rather then set up animation studios over there, Walt Disney opted to spend the cash on live action films. The first of these was ""Treasure Island""(1950) which was not only profitable, but well received by the critics. His next three British productions were a swashbuckler trilogy of varying degree of popularity beginning with ""The Story Of Robin Hood"" (1952), ""The Sword And The Rose"" (1953) and ""Rob Roy The Highland Rogue""(1954). All three starred British actor Richard Todd, and while ""Robin Hood"" was popular the other two failed to find an audience. Too bad, for ""The Sword And The Rose"" in particular was a magnificent film, sumptuously mounted, brilliantly acted and beautifully photographed by the legendary Geoffrey Unsworth. Had it been filmed a few years later it would have undoubtedly been done so in the widescreen process, but as is Unsworth fills every frame beautifully including some of the most realistic matte work I've ever seen.

The Sword And The Rose tells the mostly fictional story of King Henry VIII's younger sister Mary and her love affair with commoner Charles Brandon. (Yes, there was a Charles Brandon and he DID marry Mary Tudor.) While seeking passage to the new world Brandon is waylaid at the Kings court and ultimately finds himself unwittingly made Captain of the Guard through the machinations of Mary, who is smitten with the handsome Charles. What follows are a series of adventures and derring do which almost cost Charles his life, however there is much fun along the way including a charming ballroom sequence.

The Sword And The Rose was broadcast on Disney's 1950's Disneyland T.V. series a few years later under its original literary title ""When Knighthood Was In Flower"" and was a huge success, particularly with young girls who were entranced with Glynis Johns' feisty, liberated portrayal of the Princess Mary. (Yes, liberated not only for those times, but also for the staid '50s).  While the rest of the British cast is uniformly excellent (especially James Robertson Justice's marvelous portrayal of Henry) it is Ms. Johns who has the most screen time and makes this little known gem a wonderful historical romance.  I'm glad Disney FINALLY released this title on DVD domestically even if it is only a club ""exclusive"". You can still buy it on Amazon (as of this date) and while the richly textured colors may be a little less so on the big screen it still looks very good, about as good as can be expected for a title unlikely to receive a major restoration.  However, stay away from the Asian ALL REGION import as it is inferior.",1317081600,25,2816,4.907563025210084
486865,5,6302629195,"My Mother always called it ""When Knighthood was in Flower"" after the Victorian novel of the same name . She had read that book in High School in Fort Worth in the 1930's. So, when Walt Disney produced the film version of it in the 1950's, I was quite young but remember it well, seeing it with Mom on a Sunday afternoon in 1952 or 1953 at the old Gateway Theater in East Fort Worth. My Dad worked most Sundays for the airlines and Mom and I would have the day.
  Of this film, I remembered only three or four scenes, but I remembered the beautiful score even more. It is Vaughan-Williams and Gustav Holst and Richard Rogers all meshed together. Just beautiful. I remembered best the scene where Brandon finally meets Buckingham and duels with him.
  I love ""pageantry"" and this film has plenty. ""Quentin Durward"","" The Black Rose"" and ""Prince Valiant"" are others of my favorites. If you do not know it, ""Fire over England"" and ""The Sea Hawk"" are well worth your viewing.
  If you love pageantry and ""Elizabethan"" England and its times, buy this film and watch it again and again.  It is wonderful.",1313452800,,1097,4.51010101010101
