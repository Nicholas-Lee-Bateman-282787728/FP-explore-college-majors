3540397,3,B001DW2BG0,"This series should be used as a teaching aid for prospective screenwriters to show them what happens when the ""suits"" get involved in the creative process.

Originally, this series had the involvement of SF great Harlan Ellison, but after everyone from studio execs to apparently the photocopier repair guy got to have their ""input"", the series was so gutted and emasculated that Mr. Ellison removed his name from the production completely and substituted his WGA alias (Cordwainer Bird) as allowed when someone is completely disgusted with what has been done to the screenplay.

There are faint glimmers of genius still left in the twitching corpse the stories became and some intruiging plot lines that never got resolved (There appears to be evidence that there may have been a mutiny as well as other problems among the crew running the generation ship..many critical log entries have been erased....)

Some of the plots are hokey to the point of beggaring belief:  Giant bees (badly back projected) threaten our heroes in one area, in another, they must make repairs to a circuit board by being shrunk down to the size of transistors...apparently the ship lacks magnifying glasses, tweezers and soldering irons.

If you've never seen the show, rent it first.  Some of us will buy it simply because of what it could have been.

Either way, pick up&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phoenix-Without-Ashes/dp/0861300033/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phoenix Without Ashes</a>&nbsp;to see what Ellison really intended.",1218844800,29,1557,5.6
3540398,2,B001DW2BG0,"I'm surprised to see there is no mention yet of creator Harlan Ellison.  I've never seen an episode of the show but I read the paperback novelization of the pilot that was issued back in the 70's.

I remember very little about the book itself except that there was a very long and entertaining introduction by Ellison about the creative struggles in making the series.  Not surprisingly, Ellison hated what became of his creation but praised the person who molded the novelization from his earlier drafts of the pilot script.

The story had a lot to recommend and I shall try to finally see what they made from Ellison's original ideas.",1218499200,4,636,4.702702702702703
3540399,4,B001DW2BG0,"I watched this show when it was originally produced, and was absolutely enthralled by it - for me it sat alongside Star Trek, Space 1999, UFO, &c.  As the years went on I forgot about it, until about 15 years ago when I recalled the show (which nobody else seemed to remember), started a search and found the series, quite truncated, on VHS.  While it's true that the acting is stiff and the series is not-so-special-effected (though not always, and generally fueled with good ideas) for me it held up and still contained a lot of the wonder from my original watching.  With Walter Koenig, John Colicos, and Barry Morse appearing in various episodes it certainly holds its place as classic 70s sci-fi.  I just pre-ordered, and I'm thrilled at the prospect of finally seeing the complete series!",1218240000,56,794,4.731884057971015
3540400,5,B001DW2BG0,"At long last this forgotten cult scifi classic comes to dvd!  Many who remember this show have panned it for being stiff,  with wooden acting and cheap sfx.  Most of the sfx was done with the croma key effect.  You have to remember that this show was made in the early 70s,  on a very tight budget.  The show was also abandoned by it's creator.  While the show has it's flaws, as most shows do,  it also has a charm the can only be found in an early low budget tv production.  Fans of Doctor Who will appreciate the low budget effects and storylines.
All in all,  this dvd release has been a long time coming and I cannot wait for my set.
Have an open mind, and give the show a chance before bowing to the critics who will pan the show,  you may be pleasantly surprised!
My rating is on the content which hopefully will be matched by a superb quality dvd release!",1218153600,88,863,4.16969696969697
3540433,3,B001DW2BG0,"So says Sterling Hayden , but I don't think he was talking about Devon. I think he was talking about the producers of the show. I mean come on ! A brilliant concept from the writer of City on the Edge of Forever, Ben Bova as science consultant.( they both walked off the show) 2001s Keir Dullea , Guest Stars like Barry Morse from Space 1999 And John Colicos from Battlestar Galactica . How could you possibly go wrong . It really makes you wonder what could have been if the show had a real budget . Its not just the horrible sets . The stories are devoid of any logic . Example, In the second episode its revealed that 17 of the Arks original engineers have been frozen in case they are ever needed. Well The Ark is on a collision course with a star. So they wake one, find out he has a terminal illness ,refreeze him and don't try one of the other 16 engineers. In the whole series this the only idea that would probably have worked but they never talk about it again . That is just the tip of the iceberg. On the other hand there are things to like about the show, mainly the actors .Its clear they want this show to work .Keir Dullea gives 100% while its not his best performance, he tries hard . Gay Rowan also adds to the show because she is just so damn likable. Robin Ward just mostly sulks in the background but he's OK. There are some good performances from the guest stars . The show can be fun to watch. I was four when the show came out and have a faint memory of it being on TV.  I miss the old days of TV science fiction , while this isn't the best example. It shows what can happen to a great idea when crippled by corporate $&%@## Heads !!!",1477785600,5,1658,4.085889570552148

3540441,3,B001DW2BG0,"I am of 2 minds on this series, which I saw when it came out and reviewed with pleasure and frustration.  On the positive side, it is full of really imaginative concepts:  the ship is off-course, perhaps even derelict and headed to disaster; there are many biospheres in it that have evolved into strange civilizations, hence interesting encounters; and there is an AI system embedded in the ship that has also evolved in its own direction.  This is very fun, what we would expect from a writer like Harlan Ellison.  And of course, there are good characters.  However, on the negative side, the production itself is mediocre, even lax in its direction.  Not only is the acting uneven and the sets kind of slapdash, but the stories themselves are often not very good - characters are lackadaisical, unbelievable, even silly.  The one exception is Keir Dullea, who is excellent throughout and an interesting character, kind of a reluctant hero-rebel.

I can't say I would recommend buying this, in spite of its strong points.  It is too uneven.  Unless of course, you want some Canadian scifi...",1459641600,,1093,4.859459459459459
3540442,5,B001DW2BG0,"I remember first seeing this, when I was in 7th Grade. The show introduced Me to the writings of Harlan Ellison (AKA Cordwanier Bird), Ben Bova and Ursula K. LeGuin. The effects for Video were impressive for early 70's Video, and the restoration was impressive. The only Problem I had, were that Discs 2 and 4 would not play on my Computer, but would play on a DVD Player. Whethern that was a Technical Glitch on my computer, or on the discs, I have no idea.

3540462,5,B001DW2BG0,"Despite the bargain basement special effects, it's astounding that the show actually presented the episodes that it did with the guest stars that they had.  To see John Colicos and Barry Morse in the same episode playing off one another is worth the entire series.  Walter Koenig is also among the guest stars to appear, as an alien seeking a way home.  Talky as the episodes that were produced were, it is interesting to see Keir Dulla give the series gravitas despite how silly and disjointed the actual story being told was.  While Harlan Ellison continues to loathe this series (while ironically keeping his name on SEAQUEST) and didn't want to be associated with it in the slightest bit...the show nevertheless is worth remembering for what it tried to do and what it was able to do - entertain by giving some great acting to several forgettable stories.  Then again, that was what science fiction had to fight against back when this was produced as evidenced by all sorts of shows from the period that are fondly remembered while this one remains at the bottom of the heap primarily on Ellison's suggestions.",1436745600,4,1114,4.78125
3540473,4,B001DW2BG0,"How did I miss this?  Back when there was one tv per-house, if you were lucky,  Majority ruled.  So I never saw this show back then.  I bought this set and gave it a try and here's my two cents.  The acting was really bad,  like 70's Saturday morning live action  tv.  The sets were funny and fake looking.  None of the effects were special.  Like Jason of Star Command or Ark 2 and others.  With long pauses while gazing off into who knows where in silence.  A few times I thought my disk was frozen.  The characters never really seemed to get excited enough about impending death.  With that being said,  I absolutely loved it.........  Wish there had been more.  All the stories were interesting enough to easily make up for what it doesn't have.  I'm sure this could be remade today.  It would have been interesting tho,  had there been time,  to see into more of the domes.  Lives can go in so many directions.  So many stories to be told.  I would say give this a try.  I'm glad I did.  A plus for this series is they didn't fall back on the same two or three stories that all sci-fi shows do.  You know like the one where the Amazon Women are in control and the main character fights back............and so on......  Nice to see something different.  Well,. I'm not sure if this was really worth 2 cents.",1434931200,10,1311,4.301652892561983

3540476,1,B001DW2BG0,"I watched the complete series. I purchased it solely on the reviews, because I had never heard of the series before. According to most of the reviews the series sounded interested. To be completely honest I found the entire series too be neither interesting, or entertaining. In fact I found it quite boring, and very quickly lost interest in watching it. However I watched the entire series hoping that it would some how get better. Having said that I can see where some may find the series worth watching because it had 70's sci-fi written all over it, even down to the hair styles. It took me back in time not into the future. For me a big waste of money, because watching it again would be a big waste of time, but a good yard sale item at least that's something. Buyer beware on this one.",1431561600,4,793,4.401360544217687

3540493,3,B001DW2BG0,"Frankly this is hard to watch because the special effects are so cheesy.  Of course, this is a reflection of both the timeframe that the show was made in as well as the low budget available for the show.  Less forgivable is the writing, which was simply terrible.  What attracted me to this show (and always has) is the basic idea - Earth has been destroyed and remnants of humanity have embarked on a spaceship in hopes of resettling somewhere.  Some hundreds of years into the future, the ship's crew has perished, the ship is damaged, and it is drifting in space.  Seems like a great premise that is never even close to being utilized.  An example - in one episode our 3 intrepid protagonists discover a group of children who have been training for years to pilot the ship via simulations that they (the children) believe to be real.  Once they are made to realize that they've been working with simulations are they drafted into coming out to manage the real ship?  Of course not!  (cynicism intentional).  Instead they are just left and the show moves on to the next episode.  Plots like this drive me nuts.  I do wish that someone would re-make this and really take advantage of the possibilities of the basic idea of the show.",1420761600,,1233,4.554545454545455

3540498,1,B001DW2BG0,"This is so bad that the creator, Harlan Ellison, used a phony name in the credits. If that doesn't tell you how much of a suckfest this is, I don't know what will.
It starts off in a sort of Amish community with some elements of technology. The head elder (Sterling Hayden) is corrupt and uses his power to forbid a marriage. The forbidden couple show about as much chemistry together as water and water. There is no explanation of why the marriage is being forbidden, how the elder came to be in power or even what the events leading up to this confrontation were.
It's bad. Really bad. Not so bad it's funny, just plain bad. Keir Dullea rocks his porn moustache,  which may be the reason the elder is so upset with him. The blue screen effects are horrible and extremely noticeable. I do wonder what kind of drugs the cast and crew were on when they worked on this atrocity. And I did wonder that if the viewing would be improved by ingesting illicit substances. I didn't experiment to find out.
I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Some people have said that it should be remade and I can see where that could work.

I'd stumbled across this show by accident when pondering a purchase of 2010.  Keir Dullea (Dave Bowman in the Space Odyssey movies) and on a whim decided to see what else he'd done.  Imagine my surprise to find that he'd been one of the starts of this interesting TV science fiction series out of Canada!  Thought I was a bit surprised that I'd never heard of it before....

...with good reason, as it turned out.  The show is about a giant generational ship call The Ark which suffered some type of disaster.  Hundreds of years afterwards, a trio of residents escape one of the bio domes (there are hundreds--the ship is around 200 miles long), discover the nature of where they are, and find that the Ark is on a collision course with a sun.  They wander around the ship, trying to find somebody who can help them fix the Ark and get it back on course.

It's an interesting story and one familiar to science fiction fans, but it suffers from a variety of flaws.  Production and the quality of the stories is very uneven.  Rachel (one of the trio) is given precious little to do throughout the show. The basic premise is flawed--even IF a disaster was bad enough that nearly everybody onboard forgets who and what they are, it surely wouldn't take 400 YEARS for them to figure it out?!?  After all, the United States went from a few colonies carved out of the wilderness to world domination is less than 250.  There are also problems (of necessity) with the special effects of the time that made the show have something of the ""Doctor Who"" look of the early 1970s.  To be fair the art of special effects was just beginning, and budget constraints kept many of the stories away from vast expanses of the domes and focused on small room sets of various kinds.  I think the actors and the producers did the best they could do with what they had. I also found it amazing how the corridors are often littered with debris from the accident, but there's no dust anywhere at all.

My favorite parts were the Ark itself and the interactive computer ""sphere projectors""....those were interestingly done and you could see that type of interface evolving from where computer technology was in the early 1970s.

If you're a completest and/or just want something a little different, this is a good choice.  I'm glad I watched it to be sure, and it will join my collection of the more ""unusual"" TV series.  If it *had* clicked I'm sure it would have run for three or four years, and there's no doubt the stories would have gotten a bit more consistently better.

The three main actors and their weird talking computer assistant are very likeable and easy to follow as they explore the giant ark. The different domes each week contain a host of interesting guest characters, too.

I look at It the way I do the very first episodes of Lost in space, the first three or four episodes are good to great then every thing goes right into the septic tank. The premiss was wonderful, you can't go wrong with Harlen Ellison. Yet some how they (the producers) did. Keep in mind the time (70's) and state of video recording at the time and the FX for that medium. The value of this Series is two fold. If you are able to suspend your sense of disbelief the first few episodes especially the first written by Ellison are good stories, just badly produced. The second is this is a perfect study (I mean this in all sincerity for students of the media) of how to take an amazing idea and destroy it in almost every way it is possible too. In point of fact it could still be an amazing series if someone remade it today in a mature format i.e. Battlestar Galactica.

How do you break away from Earth's gravity? If built piece by piece in space, ferrying the components would create an environmental catastrophy requiring the evacuation of the planet. Why would the people in charge of the arch, waste collosal resources on a backwards agrian society of Cyprus Corners? Food production would so incrediably important that they would not waste produtive farmland to ""horse and plow"" technology

The 'robot' in one of the episodes blew my mind - how could _anyone_ involved in the show, agree to proceed - whether the actors, director, model/costume shop. They should staged a walkout/strike/protest/mutany against it. The arms on it didn't even move! It was appallingly bad. My young children playing with cardboard boxes, could stage a better robot.

In the episode with the astronomer, he altered the arch's course to match that of an asteroid. HELLO!! Here's the opportunity to save the arch (which he probably would have, since a change of the tinest fraction of a degree, would when applied to billions of miles of travel would be sufficent to swing the arch wide of the impending collision with the star).

Here's another way to save it. Employ the space craft used by the space police/space ambulance as tug boats, to push the arch laterally (or in any other direction) to alter it's course.

I was 8 when this was on TV, so yes there is a nostaliga factor, and in fact I am happy I got to see the whole series, but it really took determination to get through many of the episodes.

I have to say the ""host"" on computer station was quite bizzare looking.

Some have commented on the tiny budget, but consider the budget of Darkstar, vertually non-existant and they came out with a (mostly) entertaining movie. Plan 9 from outer space was on this scale of bad, but is was so bad it's actually quite funny. Starlost cannot even claim this. This is on the scale of ""Littlest Hobo"" (what was the name of that production company??) bad. ""Jacob Too Too and the hooded fang"" bad. The ""charlie brown"" movies of the 70's bad.

I liked the premise of people on a space ark, like Heinlein's Orphans of the Sky, and because I read that story a few years before this series I was aware of some possibilities that setting would allow.

I saw the fan site for this series a few years ago and was pleased that there was some record of its existence. I was not interested enough to seek out tapes of it, but when a friend's DVD set became available I couldn't resist giving it a look. It stands up better than some of the bashing it gets would suggest. There are some great moments in the story, and some really cheesy plot holes at times. I would see them in modern clothes for an episode and their farmer clothes in the next and would wonder where they ditched their clothes the previous week. The sets and effects were comparable to Doctor Who or other low budget offerings of the time, and besides getting a chuckle from me they were usually not too distracting, except maybe for the giant bees. I kept trying to find out what model of telescope that was in Farthing's Comet. Maybe it was an Edmund Scientific 6"" reflector, or a Criterion RV6 Dynascope. Not sure. The music was okay, with me liking the flute but sometimes it was a little heavy with the piano notes. It had presence in the series.

The whole series was okay, when taking into account the context of the budget and limitations of the times. There was an attempt to tell stories with limited resources, and that makes it superior to many recent higher budget effects laden productions that are mere goofy monster flicks or senseless melodrama.

The various bio domes of the ""Arc"" each contain different societies just as we have here on earth, and the three hayseeds go about them learning up the city folks on the things that really matter. Its a bit along the lines of the logans run tv show.

Negatives would be what could be called the low key Canadian style. And the show starts off very slow taking a few episodes to really get going. The lady hayseed mostly just stands around with her mouth open.

Why is it that in sc-fi shows space ships and arcs are always loaded with self destruct mechanisms that are always super easy to enable? Just lift the lid and throw the lever or push the button.
Sometimes they even go off on their own.  I guess its the ultimate statement on how push button societies are doomed to failure and must be destroyed eventually to start from scratch again.

Of course, the show was not as good as I had been hoping... few shows are. But the premise of a space ark containing the survivors of Earth (and many don't even know they're ON a spacecraft!) is compelling. With sci-fi authors such as Ben Bova and Ursula K. Le Guin working with the production it was bound to have some good storylines and concepts.

The plot has the giant Ark 800 years out from Earth and hundreds of years after some kind of accident wiped out the crew, or at least parts of it. It turns out that while the navigational and maintenance crew are gone and security has devolved into people hanging out in the hallways there are astronomy, medical and police functions are still working. Why none of these departments are worried about the Ark's impending demise is a mystery. Something like the mystery as to why the Garth bunch are wearing different outfits on just about every episode.

Unfortunately the budget and the special effects of the time worked against it. Overuse of blue screen technique often made it look cheezy. And the sets didn't help much either... I know much of the ark would have been pre-fab, but couldn't it have at least look like OLD pre-fab? And poor production quality throughout; in one scene you can see a 1970s TV camera over one of the actor's shoulders, and shortly afterward see the shot from the errant camera. The actors did the best with what they had though. The DVD might have benefited from the editing out of the cut sequence where the commercial breaks would have gone and maybe toning down the theme a bit... the high-pitch during it is a real attention-getter.

Myself, I liked watching it. The premise is great and I like sci-fi TV from this time. It's just that the special effects don't support a potentially great story, unlike many productions today in which the stories can't support the special effects.",1338595200,3,2067,4.563342318059299

Some 300 years into Earth's future, the best of the population design and launch a Space Ark to preserve what's left of humanity before the imminent destruction of our home planet.
Each community aboard the Ark house a different aspect of Earth's culture, ranging from scientific to agrarian societies. Some 100 years into the journey, an accident damages the Ark's navigation system, and cuts off each societies Biosphere from each other. Each society then evolves seperately, with no knowledge of each other, or knowledge they are in fact on an Ark.
400 years pass, and in one of these Biospheres a man called Devon falls foul of his Amish style community by constantly questioning the meaning of his and their existance. He loves Rachel who is betrothed to Garth a blackmith , and his antagonistic rejection of this arrangement have the elders ranging against Devon. He eventually finds a means of escape via an electronic portal key given to him by an older man, much like Devon in attitude, but not before persuding Rachel to join him.
With the entire community ranging against him, Devon goes through the portal with Rachel, with Garth following soon after to bring Rachel back ...
So begins The Starlost - sounds ingriguing doesn't it ? Unfortunately the execution was disastrous. Finance for special effects was not forthcoming when buyers for network TV in the US didn't materialise. Cheap (even by 1973 standards) chroma key effects with ineffective miniatures and very basic in camera effects set ups and sets defeated the whole sense of mystery and scale.

3540554,4,B001DW2BG0,"I did not know about this series before I found it on Amazon by accident, I picked the show up and watched it and I must say I am very pleased that I did. The Starlost is about a young man, Devon who lives in am Amish like society, he get banished for not accepting the rule of the elders and for asking question and not accepting their decision to marry the woman he loves, Rachel to another man, Garth. Devon discovers that the world he have grown up in is a lie, his home is just one of a multitude of societies, each encased in it's own dome which makes up a giant spaceship. As it turns out Earth was destroyed and the descendants of the last survivors, some three million people, now live on this ship, most of them having forgotten that they are on a space ship in the first place. Devon also discovers that some accident knocked the Ark, as the ship is called, off course and the ship is now on a collision course with a sun. Devon convinces Garth and Rachel to go with him and the trio then go around the Ark trying to find a way to save the ship, all the while discovering new strange societies along the way that aid or hinder them.

This series is semi episodic in nature, each episode is a stand alone story, but a fair deal of time is devoted to the major storyline which is saving the Ark. A typical episode involves the trio of heroes stumbling on some strange society, solving their problems and getting a new clue for how to save the Ark. Most of the episodes is exiting, the show have a old fashioned sense of wonder about it. Now this show is dated, if you expect top of the line modern special effects you will not find it here, but the effects in this show is non the less charming, the models used are very detailed and generally the show looks great.

The characters in this show is a weak point, while the actors do a good job the characters are one dimensional. Devon is just, stubborn and inquisitive, Rachel is intelligent and sweet and Garth is traditional and easy to anger often abandoning or even working against his friends but always coming to their rescue in the end. There is no layers to these characters, but they do get the job done.

The packaging of the show is good with each disc sitting in individual slots in a normal sized DVD cover with a internal tray for this four disc set, there is not much extras but the extras there is I am pleased with, including some trailers and the original pitch for the show. The only real flaw about this show is that it is only 16 episodes and it has no real ending, we never get to know if the trio of heroes manages to save the Ark.

I recommend this show, it is dated but allow of love obviously went into creating it.

3540555,5,B001DW2BG0,"I first saw the show in reruns probably around 1975. I loved it back then so when it finally came out on DVD I purchased it.  I think the quality is very good considering it's age.  I enjoyed watching each episode again with much more clarity then I ever saw in 1975.  If your looking for huge special effects this series is not for you.  However, if you want a series that has well written episodes were emphasis was put on the story rather then the effects then you won't be disappointed.  My only disappointment was that I really wished they would have made more then just 16 episodes!!",1304035200,2,589,4.36697247706422
3540556,3,B001DW2BG0,"On the whole, 1970s television isn't known for its timelessness in most genres.  Bushy mustaches and sideburns, funky guitar licks, and clothing that was generally on the unflattering side usually lowered the bar before subjects such as bad scripting, poor acting and limited effects budgets even enter the equation.

Science fiction of course is one genre that usually succeeds or falls on the believability of its effects if not the actors' abilities to make believable that which is under-whelming visually.  That said the original Star Trek is a prime example of extremely limited effects being more than offset by a cast dynamic that integrated a level of believability beyond the rubber masks and wigs.  The flip side of this, arguably, can be witnessed in later efforts like Buck Rogers and Galactica 1980; in which effects actually outshone the premise and acting.

So what does any of this have to do with the Starlost you ask?  Simply this: Broadcast initially in 1973 in Canada and syndicated to local networks in the United States at the same time, SL finds itself cemented firmly in between the titles mentioned above.  So even going in it's safe to expect limited effects abilities, wonky outfits and a whole lot of facial hair but it's the negativity surrounding this short-lived series that seems to be its notoriety first and foremost.

In the event that you have no clue as to the drama surrounding this space drama, allow me to briefly recap.  The series began back in early 1973 when a 20th Century Fox television producer approached speculative fiction writer Harlan Ellison to develop an idea for a science fiction TV series to essentially fill in the void left by Star Trek's disappearance from airwaves.  What would end up becoming The Starlost was actually a result of budget cuts and rough negotiations with networks in effort to get something off the ground.  As such, rather than slipping into US syndication as had been hoped, the show was run on a station by station basis; essentially meaning local affiliates of major networks decided whether or not they would pick the show up and slip it into their lineup.

Even without the security of national syndication, The Starlost was picked up by 48 stations in the United States and earned a spot on Canada's CTV network.

Problems began literally on the ground level with everything from technical production difficulties to Harlan Ellison's decision to disown the whole project before the first episode even aired (invoking a clause in his contract to force the producers to use his pen name Cordwainer Bird in the credits).

20th Century Fox, which had been responsible for some executive production funding, went out and grabbed Ben Bova to be brought on as science advisor when Ellison bailed out.  Frustrated that his advice too was being ignored, he watched the first show when it aired and quit as well.

Fox, shaken by horrible ratings, decided not to pick up options after only 16 of the original 23-epiosdes were produced and that's where the saga comes to an end.

I mentioned briefly that technical issues played a part in the undoing of the series as well and should explain these.  The show was actually a bit too ambitious for its own good in deciding to buck the trend of shooting on film, instead deciding to record the shows on video tape with the goal being to use motion controlled cameras and blue screens for the actors to combine miniature sets with the humans to create a sense of massive scale no physical sets could match.

In hindsight, the idea really wasn't too far off the composite techniques filmmakers use today in creating motion pictures (often with fully digital sets superimposed upon blue or green screens), the trouble is that the technology did not work as reliably as anticipated back in 1973.  In the end simple blue screen effects were used to combine the actors with miniaturized sets but studio space that had been rented was too shallow for any fancy photography techniques.  In the end partial sets were built, but the lack of space forced static camera shots and the finalized work shows definite ""halos"" around the performers, a constant reminder of their having been superimposed over the backgrounds.

So, in case these past paragraphs don't reveal the gravity of the situation, The Starlost is a science fiction program known for its epic failures every step of the way more than any contributions to the genre.  It's a shame too when one stops to consider what the show actually presents.

Set in the year 2790, the Starlost is a tale of three people (two guys and girl) from a sort of technology laced Amish culture who begin to question the rigid belief systems of their elders.  Their defiance results in their discovering that what they perceived as their whole world is in fact a single self contained biosphere, one of hundreds in fact, within a massive self-sustaining spacecraft built by humans some 505 years earlier to escape their dying world/ seek a planet suitable for colonization.

Interestingly, some time in the past the overseers of the massive ship (scientists and crew) were wiped out by radiation exposure and the un-operated ship itself is on a collision course with a Class-G star similar to our own sun.  The biosphere domes, because of their seclusion, have each developed their own societies and belief systems throughout the ages, all having lost touch with the reality of the situation at hand.  Individuals inhabiting the complex tunnel systems between domes have been reduced to savagery, many having developed mutations due to radiation exposure.

The structure is absolutely brilliant with abundant potential for intriguing story arcs as the trio makes discoveries about the ship and contact with cultures previously isolated in biospheres.  To that end, the show works.  The limitations of the effects and the behind-the-scenes drama can easily be overlooked in the interest of an incredibly well crafted plot.

The show does suffer from periodic pacing bogs, amateurish scripting and less than subtle background music mixing but it's by no means unwatchable.  In fact viewers with patience for the technical shortcomings will most certainly be rewarded with moments of brilliance.

VCI has, in their 4-disc release of the complete collection, digitally remastered all sixteen 50-minute episodes and includes the ""presentation reel"" created for potential broadcasters at the time.  Additionally the full color insert is loaded with information on the airdates of each episode and even includes a lengthy introspective on the unfortunate events surrounding the production of the show.

In all, space science fiction buffs would be wise to give this collection a closer look.  It's easy to focus on the negative here, just as critics surely did in the show's broadcast run, but the fact is there is definitely potential layered within the muddled delivery.  Considering the circumstances surrounding its production, not only is it impressive that the show was ever made at all, but perhaps even more so that VCI has given it the DVD treatment that it deserves.",1301443200,69,7122,5.004237288135593

I don't know if my review is really useful, since it's from the perspective of a second-grader, but this show was the kind of serious, thought-provoking SF that we didn't see again on US TV until Babylon 5, decades later.  It has the production values of a 1970's show, but a much deeper context.  It changed the way I looked at SF, and was a turning point in what I read after that, away from Star Wars-type action-oriented SF.

Though the acting and writing were uneven throughout the aborted series run,especially towards the end,  I think these few gems plus the other stuff make this set worthwhile for those who like sci fi from this era, and want to see something different.

Though it doesn't have the glitz of the various 60's series that preceeded it, or shows like Space:1999 that came after, some of the acting by the likes of Barry Morse, John Calicos, and even sometimes Keir Dullea, make it worth a watch.",1287273600,,827,4.851063829787234
3540560,3,B001DW2BG0,"It's only cheap science fiction; but I liked it.

I am very happy that ""The Starlost"" is now available on DVD. I have been waiting years to see this famous show. Why is it famous? I shall explain.

I first heard about this television show when I read ""Phoenix Without Ashes."" That novel is based on the original (unaltered) version of the pilot script for ""The Starlost"" written by the show's creator, Harlan Ellison. The original (unaltered) script was so good, it received the Writers Guild of America Award for Most Outstanding Film/Television screenplay.

In the rage-filled introduction to ""Phoenix Without Ashes,"" Harlan Ellison explains (as only he can) how the Canadian production team of ""The Starlost"" made a mess of his creation. According to Mr. Ellison, they turned his brainchild into ""cow flop."" To demonstrate his displeasure, Mr. Ellison would not allow his name to be associated with the project; hence, his pen name, ""Cordwainer Bird,"" is used in the credits for writer and creator.

After years of waiting, I was finally able to watch this show (which its creator hated so much). I can see why Mr. Ellison was upset . . . but I still enjoyed it (calm down Harlan!). While the production values are the lowest I have ever seen . . . and the acting is rather bad . . . and the scripts are flawed . . . I enjoyed the ideas that were explored throughout the show. (Contrast this with today's most popular shows . . . with their great special effects, attractive actors, and NO ideas whatsoever.) I enjoyed the show; I only wish someone would remake it with good actors and modern special effects (perhaps 20 to 23 episodes telling the entire story).

For those of you who have now watched ""The Starlost,"" find and read a copy of ""Phoenix Without Ashes,"" by Edward Bryant & Harlan Ellison. You should know how the show was SUPPOSED to be.",1286496000,2,1853,4.654434250764526

Twice, once in original run, then on DVD. Thank goodness Amazon allows trade-ins! I'll put this down there with the Original Galactica, The Fantastic Journey and Galactica 1980. In fact, I'd watch this agin BEFORE Galactica 1980! :)

I'm actually not surprised that someone out there found this releasable on DVD. Why not make a few bucks off the SF fans who were likely stoned when this was first on. One of the worst television shows ever (lame sfx, poor writing, absolutely terrible acting), this couldn't have cost much to get the rights to. Harlan Ellison removed his name from this, using a psuedonym, so what does that tell the reader? I've watched plenty of shows with terrible sfx, such as the original Doctor Who, but what set that apart from this is that the writing for Doctor Who was nearly always superb. This show goes down with pap like The Fantastic Journey, Galactica 80 and The War of the Worlds TV show. All horrible ideas, horribly produced. I don't recall any exciting bits in any of the episodes. Just plodding plots with barely any direction at all. They did have some of the earliest gimmick casting though, using Walter Koenig as the alien Oro. (Correction there! I called him Odo in my original review. I was so tired from watching this crapola show, it wore me down). I'm sure that for some there is some trivial memory to this, but I wouldn't pick it up if I found it in the street. I expect that the Starlost will soon be found in bargain basement racks very soon.

Addition: I will say that the basic idea behind this was a good one (if a bit silly. Why seperate the various settlements? Why not let them know about the problem? And the whole crew getting wiped out?) I'd like to see this get remade with a decent budget and some better actors. The stiffs in this show could have been on Enterprise!

3540566,2,B001DW2BG0,"When this was first shown, I was ten, and watching it on a black-and-white TV. I thought it was pretty good. I'm very happy it's been released, and I was glad to see it again.

But make no mistake, this is not by any means a lost classic. I can forgive poor special effects, cheap sets, and an occasional blown take making it into the final cut. That's par for the course for a television show, especially one made over thirty years ago. The fact it was a Canadian production done at a time the Canadian studios simply weren't up to the challenge should also mitigate its obvious shortcomings.

But what I can't forgive are the scripts. It's incredible to me that so many TV scripts are as bad as they are. It's the cheapest part of a production; you wouldn't think it would be so hard to get them right.

But no. Time and again, our three heroes meet people who should be able to save the Ark, and time and again the series ignores this. This reaches a bizarre climax in the second to last episode, where we discover that the Ark can avoid a nearby comet, but not a distant star. Hmm.

Plot holes like that might be ignored if the scripts had any notable merit, but they do not. On rewatching the series, I cannot recall a single script that rose above mediocrity.

Remarkably, Keir Dullea and some of the guest stars have some nice acting moments despite this. Walter Koenig's last moment in the show is a perfectly chilling sardonic smile, easily twice as frightening as anything in the script.

The Starlost might have been a weird little gem, but the entire production seems to have been cursed by incompetence. Not just your normal, every day bad decision making, or production glitches, but a perverse incompetence. One which hired genuinely talented people like Ellison and Bova, and then went to great lengths to ignore everything they said.

Ellison has been criticized for abandoning this production. Frankly, it was one of the best decisions of his career.",1250985600,8,1968,4.589743589743589

3540569,4,B001DW2BG0,"This show is an example of how a lot of stories can be told on a low budget in Science Fiction television. It was made just after the original Star trek series went off the air, and follows a ""visit a new world every week"" formula in exploring a giant starship of isolated sections that was terribly damaged in some unknown disaster.

I've heard about this series for years, read the pilot in a collection of short stories, heard all the juicy rumors about behind the scenes turmoil. Low quality episodes have been sold at conventions for years, but this collection finally assembles everything together in about the best quality possible for a reasonable price.

I wouldn't say that this series is very good, but nor is it very bad. The technical quality was only passable in the 70's. It lacks any kind of spectacular action or special effects. The plotting is slow for the modern taste. The acting can be good, especially when the guest stars bring a spark to their roles.

Some random notes:

There is conflict and tension in the episodes, but violence is rare. Everyone seems so civilized.

The women who play Garth's ""love interest of the week"" tended to be very attractive, and I was never sure if he was supposed to be getting action all over the place or not.

The set designs reuse modular elements like patterned foam and standard walls and doors, exactly what you would expect to see in a space habitat. I really liked that and they did a lot with it.

The understanding and portrayal of computers is very primitive, but consider computers in the 1970s. Mainframes were all they could imagine.

3540581,1,B001DW2BG0,"This was a Canadian video-taped science fiction series featuring a pretty well-known cast to sci-fi fans: Walter Koenig (Chekov from Star Trek), Keir Dullea (2001: A Space Odyssey), and Alexandra Bastedo (The Champions), but that's about all it has going for it. Makes Space 1999 seem like Shakespeare, and viewers might find the short-lived ""Quark"" sci-fi comedy more entertaining.

Despite the fact that this remastered set includes the entire series 16 episodes instead of the initial 10, ""Starlost"" still comes up short--despite some interesting guest stars, Sterling Hayden and Frank Converse to name a few. The series apparently had a lot going for it even with noted science writer Ben Bova as a technical consultant, but alas, the show is still a yawner. Fans would have to wait yet another two years, until Gerry Anderson's ""Space 1999"" made its debut in America's living rooms re-igniting the excitement of big-budget science fiction.

Rumor has it that the series was so poorly done and so utterly dull that its creator, the respected Harlan Ellison, disowned it and signed the pilot to the series wth his pen name ""Cordwainer Bird."" The series seems more appropriate as a cure for insomnia and was thankfully terminated after one season. The premise of the show revolved around a group of survivors from the destroyed planet Earth who were on an endless journey thru the farthest reaches of space in a huge spaceship consisting mainly of plastic, mod, circa early 1970's furniture and cardboard sets--not unlike seen on ""Moonbase 3"" which debuted the same year.

Its silly and delicious.
Their pods are like museums, and aliens come to see them,
You really ought to view them, with SciFi - not SyFy or SciHorror - in your minds eye,
Neato, sweeto, a break from the Cheeto!
I hope they're going to remake The Starlost TV series!

Theyre hokey and they're sometimes silly, but imaginative and creative,
From the mind of Harlan Ellison, The Starlost family,
Where they try to save the Humans in outer space,
Who lost the environmental race.
Neato, sweeto, a break from the Cheeto!
I hope they're going to remake The Starlost TV series!

So get an imagination, and script out the budget properly,
Survive like the bees in episode 15,
With superior genes, acting, and directing,
So this time well have a remake

8295081,5,B001DW2BG0,"In spite of its technical shortcomings this is actually a pretty darn good show.  Sometimes with low budget science fiction you get production values so low that they simply cannot be overcome by story and performance.  Not so here.  The acting, for the most part, is in earnest.  It's a little understated by some of the support cast, but the leads and the cast as a whole seem to do a fairly decent job of it.  And the stories, and overall setting, are both pretty compelling.

A vast ship carrying a variety of cultures in order to save the last of humanity, is on a course with disaster, and there's no one on board who knows enough of anything about the ship or its plight to do anything about it.  That premise is the stuff that science fiction and story legends are made of.

There's been a lot of rightful criticizing of the cheap SFX, but for 1970s TV this is pretty much on par with everything else.  The last moderately budgeted scifi television show for adults was the classic 1960s Star Trek television show, and apparently the backers of this program took notes on how and why Star Trek folded.  Ergo you get a show that uses obvious TV station video board effects and a model of a titanic spaceship what looks very much like a toy.

But, if you can get by that, the show is actually pretty endearing.  The hayseed characters look like they're out of their element and over awed as they explore a vessel that is a mix of 1970s architectural style and what the designers thought the future might look like.

So, even though the show was ""shot on the cheap"" as it were, and has a kind of soap-opera look to it, in my judgment, it's pretty decent.

I first saw it ages ago with the parents, and only saw a few episodes just once or twice when the show kept re-airing that same year.  But then it vanished.  And it would not be until a few years back that I rediscovered it on DVD.  It was a real treat to see this show again.  A show I had not seen since I was with my father some decades ago in a house far away.

Yes, this series brings back good memories, and the show itself, to me, is okay.  It's not sterling, and could have used a lot more money to really make it shine, but it's otherwise adequate for what it is.

If you're an older science fiction fan, then maybe give this series a shot.  Younger science fiction enthusiasts might get impatient with it's paltry look and slow pacing, but the themes in the stories are pretty good.

Give it a chance and enjoy.",1495584000,2,2481,4.299568965517241
8295082,4,B001DW2BG0,"Good show, produced on a shoestring budget, plagued by problems. Shot on videotape. But I thought some of the stories were actually good. The copy I received was well packaged. All episodes in good a shape as videotape provides. Harlan Ellison left in frustration he usually does.

8295084,2,B001DW2BG0,"I remember hearing about this back in the day, but despite wanting desperately to see it I never caught it on tv.  I'm kind of sorry I found it.  I have a high tolerance for '70s stuff and absolutely LOVE some of the cheesiest stories ever broadcast (just the IDEA of the six million-dollar man working with Bigfoot to save the aliens from the Bermuda triangle makes me happy) but URGH did things go wrong for the Starlost.  I can overlook unimaginative sets, crude costumes, and poor SFX - but bad writing, awful pacing, and lousy direction are not survivable.

The waste of acting talent kills me - it's one thing for Gay Rowan (Rachel, the female lead) to have little role beyond eye candy and Robin Ward (Garth, the second male lead) to be speechless most of the time - but so is Kier Dullea (Devon, the lead)?!?  The actors do their best, but saddled with poor plotting, trite dialogue, an apparent absence of direction, and easily the most disjointed pacing I've ever seen outside a grade school auditorium, it's amazing their careers survived.  I've seen improv with tighter scripts.

Well, rather than going on and on, allow me to post writer Harlan Ellison's own thoughts on this turkey:

""In the hands of the inept, the untalented, the venal, and the corrupt, The Starlost became a veritable Mt. Everest of cow flop, and, though I climbed that mountain, somehow I never lost sight of the dream, never lost the sense of smell, and when it got so rank I could stand it no longer, I descended hand-over-hand from the northern massif, leaving behind $93,000, the corrupters, and the eviscerated remains of my dream.""",1484697600,4,1622,4.686619718309859
