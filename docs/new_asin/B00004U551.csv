7923663,5,B00004U551,"This video is a must for Hindenburg fans.
Finally the real reason why the Hindenburg exploded is explained and demonstrated in detail. Only to find out they already knew what happened but never disclosed the truth months after the disaster.
Long before this video was made one main theory was the Hindenburg made too sharp a turn while lining with the mooring mast breaking one of the back gas bag cables tearing open a cell allowing hydrogen to escape to the inside top of the outer cover at the rear. Then a static charge ignited the hydrogen.
Now the real truth about this horrible disaster can come to a final rest.",1407024000,,619,4.585585585585585
7923664,4,B00004U551,"In school I was told that the highly flammable hydrogen used to inflate the Hindenburg was the cause of the disaster it suffered in May 1937.  Exactly how it caught fire, no one could say for certain, but hydrogen surely had something to do with it...or so the story went.

This program challeneges that assumption, and provides an alternate theory that seems to have a lof of merit.  Namely, that hydrogen was not the culprit, but rather, the coating used to cover the outside of the zeppelin was to blame.  According to this program, that coating contained some of the same ingredients that were later used in the development of rocket fuel (and you can imagine how flammable that might be); it only needed a spark and it would go up in flames, regardless of the gas within it (helium, hydrogen etc.).  The night the Hindenburg came in for a landing, there were electrical storms in the area.  Could they have been the spark?

It is probably true that no one will ever prove for certain what happened in Lakehurst, NJ, in 1937, but this theory seems to be as plausible as any other.  What we do know is that the Hindenburg disaster effectively ended the age of the airship and made way for modern aviation.
