5851669,5,B00DRP7TSG,"I love Puerto Rico, and enjoy exploring beyond the iconic tourist attractions.  This great documentary provides a great sampling of the type of sites, variety, attractions, and points of interest that are available in Puerto Rico ... if you explore beyond the typical, well-known spots.  The documentary is well done, well edited, and includes a great and varied selection of music to accompany the great visuals.  The host is fun, and her excitement is contagious.  If you know Puerto Rico, this might help you realize that there is still more to be discovered.  And if you really don't know Puerto Rico, this great documentary should create a sense of interest and curiosity.  Whatever level of experience and interest you may have in Puerto Rico, this is for you.  For me personally, my eyes welled up with pride as I saw the island I love portrayed so positively, concentrating on the good  and beautiful that it has to offer.  The wonderful thing is that there is plenty of uncovered material to easily make a part 2.  I hope this first part is successful, opening the door for the second part.  I loved at the end when the host says, ""This is the Puerto Rico I know ... this is the Puerto Rico I love.""  I can relate.  Puerto Rico is far from perfect, but if you concentrate on the good and the beautiful, you just might end up loving it, too.",1373932800,9,1349,4.570833333333334

We had already ordered the National Geographic PR adventure travel map and followed along with the places she traveled on her video, circling and highlighting the places that were of interest to us.  Well worth the rental.",1455580800,,270,5.113636363636363

8596863,1,B00DRP7TSG,"This is one  more in a long list of Travel Videos that I have purchased from Amazon. In addition, as a result of my being in the US Navy as well as my father, I have visited quite a few foreign countries and enjoy traveling all over the world. That being said, I have to add that this particular ""Travel Video"" is going back to Amazon! I purchased this one only because the ""Best of Travel"" series that Rudy Maxa puts out did not include anything on Puerto Rico. This has to be the most amateur effort that anyone that I have seen host a true travel video has ever put on the market for sale. As a matter of fact, I felt after watching it, that the travel host should really have paid me to watch it as I found it that painful. True, as some of the other reviews have mentioned, there is some content with information about Puerto Rico, but the way that it is presented is beyond bad acting or presenting or whatever it can be called. I felt like the presenter was giving a course to 3rd Grade students and thought that she was being ""cute"" or something but I am not sure what...? I am going to try the other film that I see called ""Visions of Puerto Rico"" because it got a great review and will be returning this film. If you have seen ""No Reservations"" with Anthony Bourdain then you will truly understand and see a professional at work. Also, the same can be said about ""Best of Travel"" with Rudy Maxa, a true professional at presenting a tour of a country. As a result of viewing this film, I would never consider visiting this country due to what I would consider the extremely poor presentation skills of the presenter. I find that just because someone is born and raised in a particular location it does not always make that person the best spokesperson for that area. Sorry if there are others out there that feel I might be a bit harsh, but I would welcome any comments either pro or con on my evaluation of this film.",1410998400,2,1927,4.2650273224043715

8596865,3,B00DRP7TSG,It is a fair tour guide for getting off the beaten path but as a middle school Spanish teacher I was hoping more for History and culture.  It is too slow and boring for middle school but would be good for someone who wants to visit the non traditional places of Puerto Rico.,1400716800,3,274,4.169811320754717
