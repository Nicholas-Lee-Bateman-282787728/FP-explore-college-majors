3120192,3,B0013XZ6T8,"This would be a perfect DVD boxset were it not for the awful Warriors of the Deep. Although my favourite Who stories are mostly on the comedy side of things, I do like the dramatic ones as well, and Silurians highlights everything good about Pertwee's first season.

Individual rankings:

The Silurians- 5 stars
The Sea Devils- 4 stars
Warriors of the Deep- 1 star.

On average is 3.33 stars, hence the rating. The Silurians feels like you've been through a war, roughly three hour epic of a species that came here on the earth first, and now want to claim the earth for themselves. Unlike later stories like Curse of Fenric where they basically hit you over the head with what they want you to believe, this one is more up for debate, and you can basically think what you want to think. And people credit Spearhead with the most iconic Pertwee image of mannequin's coming to life, but the image of people dying from the Silurian virus all over London sticks even more in my mind. It's a disease that is seemingly unstoppable...

The Sea Devils is a good escapist adventure, but it gets knocked down a star for basically being a remake of the same adventure. It's done well, with the Doctor-Master rivalry making for some good moments, and again, it's a good epic that sticks in your mind, but it feels a bit too much like a retread to give it 5 stars.

Warriors of the Deep is just plain annoying. It's one thing to not judge Doctor Who by it's budget limitations, but it's another when the character of the monster is really brought down. The slowed-down speech of the Silurians and the Sea Devils alone grate on the nerves. It takes forever to get into the story, the first episode feeling more like two hours rather than twenty five minutes. Tegan and Turlough may as well be any other companion, and the storyline. Not to mention trying to make the Fifth Doctor way too moralistic with him condenming the human base for trying to destroy the Silurians and Sea Devils (when they've destroyed half their crew) It worked in Silurians and Sea Devils because you could genuinely believe there was a chance to share the earth, but not in this atmosphere. The only thing that serial got right was the classic line ""There should've been another way."" Too right.",1208390400,16,2258,4.579207920792079
3120193,5,B0013XZ6T8,"I have been a huge fan of the original Doctor Who series since I was a boy. My local PBS station used to run Doctor Who on Saturday night, and it was a highlight of my boyhood weekends.  As a boy, the episodes being released in this set were among my favorites because I loved sea monsters and the Silurians and Sea Devils were great looking creatures.

As an adult, I now have a special appreciation for the unique nature of the Silurians and Sea Devils in the history of Doctor Who creatures.  Most of the antagonists that the Doctor encounters in the series are evil aliens and monsters bent on destruction and conquest.  But the Silurians and Sea Devils aren't.  Instead, they were the original inhabitants of the Earth during pre-historic times, and they want their planet back from the ""ape-descended primitives"" who now occupy it, i.e. humans.  If you see it from their point of view, they just want their home back.  The Doctor does see it, and several times seeks to negotiate a peace between them and humanity, pointing out that both species can share the planet since the reptilian Silurians can live in environments that humans avoid.

In ""the Silurians"", the Doctor (Jon Pertwee) makes his first attempt at negotiated settlement between humanity and the Silurians.  But he is thwarted by closed minded individuals among both the Silurians and Humans.  In many ways, the humans look more evil than the Silurians in this storyline, although some of the Silurians do take monstrous steps to try to wipe out humanity.  In the end, human fear takes advantage of the Doctor's success in countering the destructive plans of the rogue Silurians.  The Doctor finds himself disgusted by humanity and even by the actions of his friend, the Brigadier.  By the way, for fans of the Brigadier, this story represents some of Nicholas Courtney's best work on the series.

In ""the Sea Devils,"" a cousin species of the Silurians begins to pop up off the coast of Britain and strike out against the humans who once again have invaded their territory.  Once again, the Doctor (Pertwee) attempts a negotiated settlement.  But this time his plans are thwarted by the Master, who wishes to use the Sea Devils and their superior technology to conquer humanity.

Fast forward in time a decade to the years of Peter Davidson as the Doctor.  The Silurians and Sea Devils, together, return in a future Earth time period for the magnificent Doctor Who story ""Warriors of the Deep.""  This time, the Silurians and Sea Devils will not hear the Doctor's entreaties for a negotiated settlement with humanity.  Their previous experience with humans has taught them that the human race can not be trusted.  They decide they have no alternative but to wipe out humanity once and for all in order to reclaim the world they once called home.

To do so, they assault and take over an undersea missile base to start a nuclear war that will destroy the ""ape-primitives"" with their own weapons.  The Doctor is forced to make a choice-either destroy the Silurians and Sea Devils or let them slaughter all of humanity?  In the Doctor's own simple, yet heartbreakingly spoken words, ""there should have been another way.""  This compelling story gives Peter Davidson a chance to shine as a dramatic actor, with the Doctor not sure who he is more angry with-the Silurians or the humans.  Especially since in a sub-story, human agents from a rival power have also infiltraited the sea base and unleash murder and treachery even amongst the Silurian and Sea Devil onslaught.

I am so pleased that these stories that span two Doctors and two decades are being released as a set.  The stories of the Doctor's encounters with the Silurians and Sea Devils I think will become all the more compelling when taken as a whole.  If the DVD quality is as good as the other Doctor Who releases have been so far, especially in terms of the commentaries and special features, this set will be a must have for Doctor Who fans.",1204329600,39,3974,4.752186588921282
3120240,4,B0013XZ6T8,"For a series that's been out 50 years this next year, you'd think that they would have boxed sets for seasons. For the new series of Doctor Who, they've done exactly that. To my recall, a season of Classic Doctor Who has only been in a packaged state for two seasons:  Keys to Time (with Tom Baker) and Trial of a Time Lord (with Colin Baker).

With this in mind, anytime the BBC decides to put two or more episodes together (that are not really short), it's a good deal. The BBC is continually re-vamping and cleaning up the Classic Doctor Who series, so you never know when something is going to go out of print. Get them while you can!!!",1353888000,,640,4.2809917355371905
3120241,4,B0013XZ6T8,"If I were to rate the three stories included in ""Beneath the Surface"" separately, I would give five stars to ""Doctor Who and the Silurians,"" three stars to ""The Sea Devils"" and two to ""Warriors of the Deep."" I rate the set four stars overall because with Amazon's discounting it's almost like buying the first two stories and getting the third free, which is about what it's worth.

The first two stories from the Jon Pertwee years are classics that showcase some of the best work by one of the series' greatest writers, Malcolm Hulke. Hulke, a dedicated leftist, explored some of his most deeply felt pacifist beliefs with these stories, and they hold up remarkably well despite the overt politics and the many production challenges they had to overcome. ""Warriors of the Deep,"" scripted by Johnny Byrne, resurrected Hulke's creations at the height of nuclear tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union in the early 1980s, and the results were disastrous.

One of the biggest challenges to producing all three stories, particularly the Sea Devils episodes, was the costume design, which consisted basically of men in rubber suits. These presented all sorts of difficulties: poor visibility and mobility, extreme discomfort from overheating, and the requirement that all dialogue be performed by actors not inside the suits.

Problems with the Sea Devil costumes were especially acute. They didn't work well in water scenes, either filling with water and weighing the actors down or not allowing air to escape, which sometimes caused heads and feet to bob to the surface. The actor peeped out through eye slits in the neck, so the Sea Devil's turtlelike head was essentially a hat that the actor had to balance on top of his own head. When battle helmets were added to the Sea Devils in ""Warriors of the Deep,"" the actors had to balance hats on top of hats.

Compounding the difficulties, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called a parliamentary election to capitalize on the success of the Falklands War just as ""Warriors"" was going into production, which created studio scheduling conflicts as the BBC cleared the decks to cover the campaign. This meant that ""Warriors"" was always pressed for recording time, leading to scenes that were rushed and special effects disasters like the Myrka, a laughable 15-foot pantomime horse-style sea monster that was difficult to operate, smelled badly because it was fresh out of the workshop and smeared green paint on actors' clothing if they brushed up against it.

Here's the good news: all three stories come with fully loaded Special Features menus that include above-average ""making of"" documentaries and other extras that explain the historical context and production difficulties of these important episodes.",1313020800,3,2776,5.119205298013245

3120243,5,B0013XZ6T8,"Beneath the surface consists of 3 story's two from the Jon Pertwee era, and one from the Peter Davison era. The first is a 7 episode story, the second a 6 episode story, and the 3rd a standard 4 episode story. usually for a 7 episode story you would pay $20 or so dollars. This whole set is available for $40 - $20, depending on who you buy from on Amazon and if you are willing to buy used.  Just price each story individually, you will see what I mean. By the way, Amazon has the best prices on this set, and believe me I have checked over and over, as I had lost my first copy (I bought elsewhere and paid a lot more) and started looking for a replacement copy at much less than I paid for the first. This is a huge value in the world of Doctor Who. All three stories are wonderfully done. And the second even involve's The Master (John Delgado who tragically lost his life in an auto accident.) All three stories involve 2 types of underground/sea creatures the first are reptiles called ""Siluarians"" The second are sea creatures whose names I forget. The Silaurians are much more fun. JMHO :-) The third story combines both undersea/ground creatures united in the future against mankind, in which The Doctor must stop them to save the planet yet again. Anyway, if you like classic Doctor Who, you will love this, it  has everything, comedy, action, and even the Brigadear.

3120244,5,B0013XZ6T8,"As if I didn't already have enough cool things I want to waste my money on, the BBC has recently released some great collections of classic Doctor Who episodes. This particular set includes three serials - Doctor Who and the Silurians, The Sea Devils, and Warriors of the Deep - the first two featuring Jon Pertwee, and the last starring Peter Davison. Newly remastered for DVD, and with some special features, photo galleries and promotional trailers, these are classic episodes that will appeal to almost any Doctor Who fan out there.

The common theme here, of course, are the prehistoric reptilian races - the Silurians and the Sea Devils. While perhaps not as well known as, say, the Daleks, Cybermen, Sontarans or Ice Warriors, these two monsters are still iconic enough to be known by most fans of the series. The first serial, Doctor Who and the Silurians from 1970, marks their first appearance, when UNIT asks the Doctor and Liz to investigate a series of power failures at a secret nuclear facility. They quickly find out that a race of intelligent reptiles are awakening from hibernation and wish to reclaim the earth from 'primitive apes'. Can the Doctor negotiate a peaceful solution? Of particular note, this is the first time that Doctor Who and the Silurians has been released in full color glory.

The next serial, also starring Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor, finds the Doctor and Jo paying a visit to the Master (played by Roger Delgado, with all the evil charm he gave that role) on an isolated prison island. But little do they know that the Master has tricked his warden into becoming a willing pawn in his game, or that he is building a device to communicate with a race of recently awakened marine reptiles. When the Doctor starts investigating some missing ships, he uncovers the Sea Devils, and recognizing their relations to the Silurians he encountered earlier, once again tries to sue for peace, even as the Navy begins launching an attack. Can the Doctor avert disaster?

Finally, coming full circle, the next disc is 'Warriors of the Deep,' a 1984 serial with Peter Davison as the Fifth Doctor. Set in a future earth where two powers stand on the brink of nuclear war, the Silurians and Sea Devils have formed an alliance to once again try and take over the earth. Their plan? Take over an undersea military base and launch an attack, causing the humans to wipe each other out. As always, the Doctor and his companions (Tegan and Turlough) show up at just the right time, and get captured on suspicion of being saboteurs. Just to complicate things, there really ARE saboteurs in the base, working for the unnamed rival superpower, but even they don't know of the impending Silurian-Sea Devil threat. Once again, the Doctor argues against bloodshed. Can he stop a war which would annihilate all three species?

All in all, this is a great boxed set for any Doctor Who fan. It includes all of the Silurian and Sea Devil episodes, collected together for the first time, along with a bunch of special features any true fan would love to see. Especially if they are a fan of Jon Pertwee's Doctor. It also showcases the Doctor's personality, always standing for the path of least bloodshed and trying to negotiate with alien races. I recommend this, along with some of the other classic Doctor Who episodes now on disc, for any sci-fi fans out there. Especially if you enjoy the new series; you owe it to yourself to watch the originals as well. Very good stuff!",1227830400,,3489,4.733552631578948
3120245,4,B0013XZ6T8,"BENEATH THE SURFACE is one box-set that contains three stories -- three distinct takes on a simple, basic premise.  The idea behind all of them is that a race of reptiles evolved into a superior intelligence on Earth, long before the dawn of man.  Forced into a state of advanced hibernation millions of years ago, these beings have awoken in the present day and are shocked and outraged by the presence of humans all over the planet they perceive to belong to them.

The story begins in the Jon Pertwee era with a script that the production team originally conceived of as a reaction against the Doctor's exile being dominated entirely by extraterrestrial invasion and mad scientist stories.  Malcolm Hulke's script for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DOCTOR-WHO-AND-THE-SILURIANS/dp/B00142UZ9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DOCTOR WHO AND THE SILURIANS</a>&nbsp;does a great job of portraying the Silurians as intelligent creatures who view humanity as nothing more than a nuisance.  Humans who survive encounters with the monsters living in the caves are driven mad with primeval fear.  The Doctor must work as a neutral third party to prevent a war that would have large casualties on both sides, a theme that repeats itself throughout the three stories.

The second serial is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-SEA-DEVILS/dp/B00147F8YQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE SEA DEVILS</a>.  Produced two years after the previous story, the sequel concerns the underwater cousins to the Silurians.  Ships are going missing, and with help from the Doctor's foe, the Master, the Sea Devils are gathering their strength.  This story tones down the horror aspects but adds a very successful action/adventure flavor.  The inclusion of Roger Delgado's Master is always a welcome bonus.

The third of the trilogy is far and away the weakest entry.  Twelve years later, the Doctor Who production team presents us with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WARRIORS-OF-THE-DEEP/dp/B00142UZ9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WARRIORS OF THE DEEP</a>&nbsp;which attempts to recreate the moral quandaries that existed in the originals, but totally fails to deliver any depth.  In the story, the two sets of Earth Reptiles join forces to recapture the Earth, yet the plot misses the heart of the past serials.  Bad production values and painfully static battle sequences leave us with a story that lacks everything that made the two earlier entries great.

As with previous Doctor Who DVD releases, the extras are extremely comprehensive.  Each story has a making-of documentary which details both the script writing processes and the physical production.  Each story has two commentaries (an audio featuring a mixture of cast and crew, and a textual, production notes commentary), which in all cases are a fine balance of informational and entertaining.

As a fan, I had a great time.  First, I watched the stories (for the first time in a long time).  Then I watched the documentaries.  Then I rewatched the episodes with the commentaries enabled.  This was a lot of fun.  With three different types of storytelling here, there should be something for every fan.",1217808000,,3264,5.8088235294117645
3120246,4,B0013XZ6T8,"We get 2 gems from the Pertwee era and one of the Davison era's weakest.  The Silurians really set the stage for the 70s in Doctor Who.  A monster story like this from the 60s would have had the monsters be evil and the Doctor eagerly destroying them.  Malcolm Hulke often had no real bad guys in his stories, just groups in conflict with different points of view.  The Doctor tries to make the peace between Silurians and humans but is thwarted by distrusting members of both sides.  A very progressive view fitting into the Doctor's late 60s/early 70s setting.  The part with the Silurian disease spreading thru the populace was the most frightening.  The Silurians are a bit disappointing as monsters but are wisely kept in shadow in the first half.  7 parts are at least one too many, be ready for slow going by today's standards.  The ending is amazing, how often does the Doctor lose?

  The Sea Devils goes over the same ground but in a more light hearted vein.  Barry Letts had softened the show in the 2 years since the Silurians so when the Doctor meets their cousins here, not as hesitiant or preachy.  The Master adds a lot to the story as does the British Navy.  If it wasn't for freebies like the Navy's OK for use of their ships & bases, so many Doctor Who episodes would be all cheap looking studio work.  Pretty much an action romp and a fun ride.

  Warriros of the Deep is the turkey here.  The epitome of bad Doctor Who.  I think it's not so bad, the script has lots of promise.  They were just too ambitious and very rushed on the job.  I like Davison as the Doctor and think he's underrated.  The Silurians and Sea Devils come off much weaker here and different from their eariler appearences.  The sea base is overly lit and has no atmosphere, the Myrka creature is laughable and on screen too long, the battle scenes have no sense of drama or danger, the Doctor conveniently finds anti-reptile gas, everyone but our regulars die off by the end.  They did better later in this season  with Resurrection of the Daleks.  Here, the closing line says it all...""there should have been another way.""

Overall, a good purchae for hard core Doctor Who fans, even WOTD is worth it for extras and audio commentaries from the cast about how bad it all was.",1217203200,,2268,4.463414634146342
3120247,5,B0013XZ6T8,"Several times on the bonus material for ""Doctor Who and the Silurians"", then-script editor Terrance Dicks explains the origins for that story's eponymous villain.  With the Doctor exiled to Earth and the TARDIS disabled, Dicks was told by one of his writers that the show was now limited to just two story types: alien invasion, and mad scientist.  Realizing he was painted into a corner, Dicks decided to invert the scenario by commissioning an alien invasion from a species that was already on Earth before man rose to prominence.

Thus was born the Silurians, the memorable (and mis-named) villains that recurred on ""Doctor Who"" enough times to fill out their own box set.  The opening story, from 1970, is the longest and most intriguing: a team of scientists in the caves under Derbyshire inadvertently awaken a hibernating reptilian species that had been asleep for tens of millions of years.  First in secret and then in the open, the Silurians attack not only the scientists but then all of mankind.  From a low-key opening episode, the stakes escalate until the world is threatened by an Ebola-type virus in part six.

""Silurians"" was Malcolm Hulke's first solo contribution to the series (he'd previously co-authored two Second Doctor episodes) and he became a mainstay of the Third Doctor's run on the show.  DVD extra features are strong: the deepest audio commentary booth to date (seven show contributors rotate in and out) provides tons of insights; guest actor Geoffrey Palmer narrates a terrific documentary that compares the relatively gentle pace of the 1970 serial to today's more condensed and frenetic adventures.  This choice of narrator is brilliant, to coin a phrase: not only did Palmer guest-star in a recent new ""Who"" episode, but his son also directed four episodes last season.

The second story, ""The Sea Devils"", is Hulke's sequel to the earlier story, featuring the inadvertent revival of a marine cousin to the Silurians.  This is a far more action packed episode: the Doctor and the Master have a lengthy swordfight in episode two, and the cooperation of the Royal Navy leads to several land and sea combat sequences in the closing installments.  There's a submarine subplot, and two comedy sequences that have since been duplicated in new ""Who"": the Master captivated by a children's television programme, and the Doctor and Jo staging a lengthy mime sequence through a plate-glass window.

The ""Sea Devils"" bonus features are highlighted by an unusual commentary booth: Dicks, producer Barry Letts, and show director Michael Briant exchange the usual compliments and potshots, but this time they're joined by Andrew Cartmel, the show-runner for ""Doctor Who""'s final three seasons.  Cartmel's run was characterized by tight internal continuity and very little navel-gazing into the series' past: to have him discuss a story nearly 20 years before his time gives fascinating insight into the type of ""Who"" he later chose to produce.

The final DVD, ""Warriors of the Deep"", comes from much later in series history (it opens the Fifth Doctor's final season in 1984) and has aged the least gracefully of the three stories.  This time, there's no debate on whether or not the Silurians and Sea Devils can co-exist with the human upstarts, they're just out on a highly effective seek-and-destroy mission.  There's hardly a smile to be had in 90 minutes, and the only survivor among the large guest cast does so impliedly and offscreen.  Ingrid Pitt, the queen of horror flicks, has a thankless small role which doesn't allow her to exchange so much as a word of dialogue with the Doctor; her exit from the show was later derided by writer Johnny Byrne on an Internet newsgroup as ""the mother of all drop-kicks"".

The extras for ""Warriors"" are perhaps harsher than they need to be.  Everyone involved in production -- director, writer, actors, visual effects designer -- shows up to get their kicks in.  ""Warriors"" was one of my first stories as a young fan in 1984 and I'm sorry to see the story hasn't matched my memories; however, having everyone involved throw stones at it 25 years later is perhaps a bit much.

On the whole, though, the box-set features the entire Silurians/Sea Devils running story, with two classic Doctors and a boatload of moral dilemmas.  Even if the best material comes at the beginning of the set, it's still a fascinating release.",1215388800,3,4390,4.991769547325103
3120248,5,B0013XZ6T8,"Doctor Who can be a pretty deep show sometimes. And that goes for the three stories in this aptly named box-set both in the usual figurative sense and quite literally as well. That is, the unifying element in ""Doctor Who and the Silurians"" (1970), ""The Sea Devils"" (1972), and ""Warriors of the Deep"" (1984) is one of the most creatively imaginative set of antagonists the show has seen in its long history, and they antagonize from the depths of the earth and sea. The eponymous Silurians, that is, along with their equally eponymous semi-aquatic branch, the Sea Devils--a highly advanced and civilized race of reptilians that evolved on Earth long before we did, went into suspended animation underground and undersea to weather what they predicted to be a global catastrophe, and then overslept a bit until the technological advances of the mammalian hominids who evolved in their absence awoke them again. All three times they seek to retake the planet that once was theirs, each time the Doctor tries to broker a peaceful compromise between the two feuding sets of Earthlings, and each time mutual suspicion, xenophobia, and itchy trigger fingers prevail over the Doctor's voice of reason and compromise. Each story too invokes this complicated moral dilemma with cold war allegorical overtones within the confines of a thoroughly enjoyable science fiction thriller.

Each also has its own particularities too, of course. ""Doctor Who and the Silurians"" gets the whole concept going and is the strongest of the three storywise. Only the second story of the third Doctor's tenure (as expertly played by Jon Pertwee), it also starts establishing several key motifs of that era, including the Earthbound Doctor's characteristically eccentric vintage car. ""The Sea Devils"" takes the concept two years later and jazzes it up with more action and greater scale while complicating matters with the presence of the Doctor's Time Lord nemesis, the Master, who seeks to foment strife and discord quite as much as the Doctor seeks to defuse it. All of this has the slight drawback of simplifying the story to a slight degree, but the overall result is a delightfully quintessential sample of the Pertwee era. ""Warriors of the Deep"" attempts more than a decade later to update the concept and develop it further--a valiant attempt that due to a few errors of judgment as well as circumstances beyond anyone's control ends up falling far short. This is definitely the weakest link of the three, but it has some redeeming qualities (the model work and set design for the Silurian submarine and Sea Devil hibernation chamber are superb, for instance) and in any case it's one of those the fans love to hate, which is a distinction of sorts anyway.

Extras are never the deal-breaker with me (I consider them indeed extra), but the ones on these discs deserve special mention. The ""Silurians"" includes ""What Lies Beneath"", a highly informative and interesting look at the social history underlying the story as well as an examination of the manner in which it met the expectations of its time and addressed issues of immediate concern, considerably deepening the contemporary viewer's appreciation of this classic in the process. There is also an intriguing behind-the-scenes take on the extremely experimental music featured in the two Pertwee stories--Doctor Who was pioneering the real future sound of London, playing with bizarre soundscapes and electronic harmonies way ahead of its time. For its part, ""Warriors"" includes ""The Depths"" wherein everybody from the writer and the key actors onwards has a good time ripping on this poor beleaguered tale--most extras include nothing but hype and hyperbole, only the Doctor Who crew has the guts to reflect at length on their own fumbles and have a good laugh doing so.

In any case, this is overall a fine DVD set of classic Doctor Who storylines scattered in time but highlighting one of the show's more inventive concepts together with its later permutations. And for the obsessive-compulsive fans such as myself, each of the three stories is in a separate, self-contained case so that they can be taken out of the box and placed in chronological order with one's other Doctor Who DVDs if one so chooses. Getting them together as a set is still the more convenient and frugal option, of course, unless one has a particular interest in only one of the three. In that case, they can be purchased singly as well:

The Sea Devils- 4 stars
Warriors of the Deep- 1 star.

On average is 3.33 stars, hence the rating. The Silurians feels like you've been through a war, roughly three hour epic of a species that came here on the earth first, and now want to claim the earth for themselves. Unlike later stories like Curse of Fenric where they basically hit you over the head with what they want you to believe, this one is more up for debate, and you can basically think what you want to think. And people credit Spearhead with the most iconic Pertwee image of mannequin's coming to life, but the image of people dying from the Silurian virus all over London sticks even more in my mind. It's a disease that is seemingly unstoppable...

The Sea Devils is a good escapist adventure, but it gets knocked down a star for basically being a remake of the same adventure. It's done well, with the Doctor-Master rivalry making for some good moments, and again, it's a good epic that sticks in your mind, but it feels a bit too much like a retread to give it 5 stars.

Warriors of the Deep is just plain annoying. It's one thing to not judge Doctor Who by it's budget limitations, but it's another when the character of the monster is really brought down. The slowed-down speech of the Silurians and the Sea Devils alone grate on the nerves. It takes forever to get into the story, the first episode feeling more like two hours rather than twenty five minutes. Tegan and Turlough may as well be any other companion, and the storyline. Not to mention trying to make the Fifth Doctor way too moralistic with him condenming the human base for trying to destroy the Silurians and Sea Devils (when they've destroyed half their crew) It worked in Silurians and Sea Devils because you could genuinely believe there was a chance to share the earth, but not in this atmosphere. The only thing that serial got right was the classic line ""There should've been another way."" Too right.",1208390400,16,2258,4.579207920792079
3354690,5,B0013XZ6T8,"I have been a huge fan of the original Doctor Who series since I was a boy. My local PBS station used to run Doctor Who on Saturday night, and it was a highlight of my boyhood weekends.  As a boy, the episodes being released in this set were among my favorites because I loved sea monsters and the Silurians and Sea Devils were great looking creatures.

As an adult, I now have a special appreciation for the unique nature of the Silurians and Sea Devils in the history of Doctor Who creatures.  Most of the antagonists that the Doctor encounters in the series are evil aliens and monsters bent on destruction and conquest.  But the Silurians and Sea Devils aren't.  Instead, they were the original inhabitants of the Earth during pre-historic times, and they want their planet back from the ""ape-descended primitives"" who now occupy it, i.e. humans.  If you see it from their point of view, they just want their home back.  The Doctor does see it, and several times seeks to negotiate a peace between them and humanity, pointing out that both species can share the planet since the reptilian Silurians can live in environments that humans avoid.

In ""the Silurians"", the Doctor (Jon Pertwee) makes his first attempt at negotiated settlement between humanity and the Silurians.  But he is thwarted by closed minded individuals among both the Silurians and Humans.  In many ways, the humans look more evil than the Silurians in this storyline, although some of the Silurians do take monstrous steps to try to wipe out humanity.  In the end, human fear takes advantage of the Doctor's success in countering the destructive plans of the rogue Silurians.  The Doctor finds himself disgusted by humanity and even by the actions of his friend, the Brigadier.  By the way, for fans of the Brigadier, this story represents some of Nicholas Courtney's best work on the series.

In ""the Sea Devils,"" a cousin species of the Silurians begins to pop up off the coast of Britain and strike out against the humans who once again have invaded their territory.  Once again, the Doctor (Pertwee) attempts a negotiated settlement.  But this time his plans are thwarted by the Master, who wishes to use the Sea Devils and their superior technology to conquer humanity.

Fast forward in time a decade to the years of Peter Davidson as the Doctor.  The Silurians and Sea Devils, together, return in a future Earth time period for the magnificent Doctor Who story ""Warriors of the Deep.""  This time, the Silurians and Sea Devils will not hear the Doctor's entreaties for a negotiated settlement with humanity.  Their previous experience with humans has taught them that the human race can not be trusted.  They decide they have no alternative but to wipe out humanity once and for all in order to reclaim the world they once called home.

To do so, they assault and take over an undersea missile base to start a nuclear war that will destroy the ""ape-primitives"" with their own weapons.  The Doctor is forced to make a choice-either destroy the Silurians and Sea Devils or let them slaughter all of humanity?  In the Doctor's own simple, yet heartbreakingly spoken words, ""there should have been another way.""  This compelling story gives Peter Davidson a chance to shine as a dramatic actor, with the Doctor not sure who he is more angry with-the Silurians or the humans.  Especially since in a sub-story, human agents from a rival power have also infiltraited the sea base and unleash murder and treachery even amongst the Silurian and Sea Devil onslaught.

I am so pleased that these stories that span two Doctors and two decades are being released as a set.  The stories of the Doctor's encounters with the Silurians and Sea Devils I think will become all the more compelling when taken as a whole.  If the DVD quality is as good as the other Doctor Who releases have been so far, especially in terms of the commentaries and special features, this set will be a must have for Doctor Who fans.",1204329600,39,3974,4.752186588921282
3354737,4,B0013XZ6T8,"For a series that's been out 50 years this next year, you'd think that they would have boxed sets for seasons. For the new series of Doctor Who, they've done exactly that. To my recall, a season of Classic Doctor Who has only been in a packaged state for two seasons:  Keys to Time (with Tom Baker) and Trial of a Time Lord (with Colin Baker).

With this in mind, anytime the BBC decides to put two or more episodes together (that are not really short), it's a good deal. The BBC is continually re-vamping and cleaning up the Classic Doctor Who series, so you never know when something is going to go out of print. Get them while you can!!!",1353888000,,640,4.2809917355371905
3354738,4,B0013XZ6T8,"If I were to rate the three stories included in ""Beneath the Surface"" separately, I would give five stars to ""Doctor Who and the Silurians,"" three stars to ""The Sea Devils"" and two to ""Warriors of the Deep."" I rate the set four stars overall because with Amazon's discounting it's almost like buying the first two stories and getting the third free, which is about what it's worth.

The first two stories from the Jon Pertwee years are classics that showcase some of the best work by one of the series' greatest writers, Malcolm Hulke. Hulke, a dedicated leftist, explored some of his most deeply felt pacifist beliefs with these stories, and they hold up remarkably well despite the overt politics and the many production challenges they had to overcome. ""Warriors of the Deep,"" scripted by Johnny Byrne, resurrected Hulke's creations at the height of nuclear tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union in the early 1980s, and the results were disastrous.

One of the biggest challenges to producing all three stories, particularly the Sea Devils episodes, was the costume design, which consisted basically of men in rubber suits. These presented all sorts of difficulties: poor visibility and mobility, extreme discomfort from overheating, and the requirement that all dialogue be performed by actors not inside the suits.

Problems with the Sea Devil costumes were especially acute. They didn't work well in water scenes, either filling with water and weighing the actors down or not allowing air to escape, which sometimes caused heads and feet to bob to the surface. The actor peeped out through eye slits in the neck, so the Sea Devil's turtlelike head was essentially a hat that the actor had to balance on top of his own head. When battle helmets were added to the Sea Devils in ""Warriors of the Deep,"" the actors had to balance hats on top of hats.

Compounding the difficulties, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called a parliamentary election to capitalize on the success of the Falklands War just as ""Warriors"" was going into production, which created studio scheduling conflicts as the BBC cleared the decks to cover the campaign. This meant that ""Warriors"" was always pressed for recording time, leading to scenes that were rushed and special effects disasters like the Myrka, a laughable 15-foot pantomime horse-style sea monster that was difficult to operate, smelled badly because it was fresh out of the workshop and smeared green paint on actors' clothing if they brushed up against it.

Here's the good news: all three stories come with fully loaded Special Features menus that include above-average ""making of"" documentaries and other extras that explain the historical context and production difficulties of these important episodes.",1313020800,3,2776,5.119205298013245

The first is a 7 episode story, the second a 6 episode story, and the 3rd a standard 4 episode story. usually for a 7 episode story you would pay $20 or so dollars. This whole set is available for $40 - $20, depending on who you buy from on Amazon and if you are willing to buy used.  Just price each story individually, you will see what I mean. By the way, Amazon has the best prices on this set, and believe me I have checked over and over, as I had lost my first copy (I bought elsewhere and paid a lot more) and started looking for a replacement copy at much less than I paid for the first. This is a huge value in the world of Doctor Who. All three stories are wonderfully done. And the second even involve's The Master (John Delgado who tragically lost his life in an auto accident.) All three stories involve 2 types of underground/sea creatures the first are reptiles called ""Siluarians"" The second are sea creatures whose names I forget. The Silaurians are much more fun. JMHO :-) The third story combines both undersea/ground creatures united in the future against mankind, in which The Doctor must stop them to save the planet yet again. Anyway, if you like classic Doctor Who, you will love this, it  has everything, comedy, action, and even the Brigadear.

3354741,5,B0013XZ6T8,"As if I didn't already have enough cool things I want to waste my money on, the BBC has recently released some great collections of classic Doctor Who episodes. This particular set includes three serials - Doctor Who and the Silurians, The Sea Devils, and Warriors of the Deep - the first two featuring Jon Pertwee, and the last starring Peter Davison. Newly remastered for DVD, and with some special features, photo galleries and promotional trailers, these are classic episodes that will appeal to almost any Doctor Who fan out there.

The common theme here, of course, are the prehistoric reptilian races - the Silurians and the Sea Devils. While perhaps not as well known as, say, the Daleks, Cybermen, Sontarans or Ice Warriors, these two monsters are still iconic enough to be known by most fans of the series. The first serial, Doctor Who and the Silurians from 1970, marks their first appearance, when UNIT asks the Doctor and Liz to investigate a series of power failures at a secret nuclear facility. They quickly find out that a race of intelligent reptiles are awakening from hibernation and wish to reclaim the earth from 'primitive apes'. Can the Doctor negotiate a peaceful solution? Of particular note, this is the first time that Doctor Who and the Silurians has been released in full color glory.

The next serial, also starring Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor, finds the Doctor and Jo paying a visit to the Master (played by Roger Delgado, with all the evil charm he gave that role) on an isolated prison island. But little do they know that the Master has tricked his warden into becoming a willing pawn in his game, or that he is building a device to communicate with a race of recently awakened marine reptiles. When the Doctor starts investigating some missing ships, he uncovers the Sea Devils, and recognizing their relations to the Silurians he encountered earlier, once again tries to sue for peace, even as the Navy begins launching an attack. Can the Doctor avert disaster?

Finally, coming full circle, the next disc is 'Warriors of the Deep,' a 1984 serial with Peter Davison as the Fifth Doctor. Set in a future earth where two powers stand on the brink of nuclear war, the Silurians and Sea Devils have formed an alliance to once again try and take over the earth. Their plan? Take over an undersea military base and launch an attack, causing the humans to wipe each other out. As always, the Doctor and his companions (Tegan and Turlough) show up at just the right time, and get captured on suspicion of being saboteurs. Just to complicate things, there really ARE saboteurs in the base, working for the unnamed rival superpower, but even they don't know of the impending Silurian-Sea Devil threat. Once again, the Doctor argues against bloodshed. Can he stop a war which would annihilate all three species?

All in all, this is a great boxed set for any Doctor Who fan. It includes all of the Silurian and Sea Devil episodes, collected together for the first time, along with a bunch of special features any true fan would love to see. Especially if they are a fan of Jon Pertwee's Doctor. It also showcases the Doctor's personality, always standing for the path of least bloodshed and trying to negotiate with alien races. I recommend this, along with some of the other classic Doctor Who episodes now on disc, for any sci-fi fans out there. Especially if you enjoy the new series; you owe it to yourself to watch the originals as well. Very good stuff!",1227830400,,3489,4.733552631578948
3354742,4,B0013XZ6T8,"BENEATH THE SURFACE is one box-set that contains three stories -- three distinct takes on a simple, basic premise.  The idea behind all of them is that a race of reptiles evolved into a superior intelligence on Earth, long before the dawn of man.  Forced into a state of advanced hibernation millions of years ago, these beings have awoken in the present day and are shocked and outraged by the presence of humans all over the planet they perceive to belong to them.

The story begins in the Jon Pertwee era with a script that the production team originally conceived of as a reaction against the Doctor's exile being dominated entirely by extraterrestrial invasion and mad scientist stories.  Malcolm Hulke's script for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DOCTOR-WHO-AND-THE-SILURIANS/dp/B00142UZ9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DOCTOR WHO AND THE SILURIANS</a>&nbsp;does a great job of portraying the Silurians as intelligent creatures who view humanity as nothing more than a nuisance.  Humans who survive encounters with the monsters living in the caves are driven mad with primeval fear.  The Doctor must work as a neutral third party to prevent a war that would have large casualties on both sides, a theme that repeats itself throughout the three stories.

The second serial is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-SEA-DEVILS/dp/B00147F8YQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE SEA DEVILS</a>.  Produced two years after the previous story, the sequel concerns the underwater cousins to the Silurians.  Ships are going missing, and with help from the Doctor's foe, the Master, the Sea Devils are gathering their strength.  This story tones down the horror aspects but adds a very successful action/adventure flavor.  The inclusion of Roger Delgado's Master is always a welcome bonus.

The third of the trilogy is far and away the weakest entry.  Twelve years later, the Doctor Who production team presents us with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WARRIORS-OF-THE-DEEP/dp/B00142UZ9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WARRIORS OF THE DEEP</a>&nbsp;which attempts to recreate the moral quandaries that existed in the originals, but totally fails to deliver any depth.  In the story, the two sets of Earth Reptiles join forces to recapture the Earth, yet the plot misses the heart of the past serials.  Bad production values and painfully static battle sequences leave us with a story that lacks everything that made the two earlier entries great.

As with previous Doctor Who DVD releases, the extras are extremely comprehensive.  Each story has a making-of documentary which details both the script writing processes and the physical production.  Each story has two commentaries (an audio featuring a mixture of cast and crew, and a textual, production notes commentary), which in all cases are a fine balance of informational and entertaining.

As a fan, I had a great time.  First, I watched the stories (for the first time in a long time).  Then I watched the documentaries.  Then I rewatched the episodes with the commentaries enabled.  This was a lot of fun.  With three different types of storytelling here, there should be something for every fan.",1217808000,,3264,5.8088235294117645
3354743,4,B0013XZ6T8,"We get 2 gems from the Pertwee era and one of the Davison era's weakest.  The Silurians really set the stage for the 70s in Doctor Who.  A monster story like this from the 60s would have had the monsters be evil and the Doctor eagerly destroying them.  Malcolm Hulke often had no real bad guys in his stories, just groups in conflict with different points of view.  The Doctor tries to make the peace between Silurians and humans but is thwarted by distrusting members of both sides.  A very progressive view fitting into the Doctor's late 60s/early 70s setting.  The part with the Silurian disease spreading thru the populace was the most frightening.  The Silurians are a bit disappointing as monsters but are wisely kept in shadow in the first half.  7 parts are at least one too many, be ready for slow going by today's standards.  The ending is amazing, how often does the Doctor lose?

  The Sea Devils goes over the same ground but in a more light hearted vein.  Barry Letts had softened the show in the 2 years since the Silurians so when the Doctor meets their cousins here, not as hesitiant or preachy.  The Master adds a lot to the story as does the British Navy.  If it wasn't for freebies like the Navy's OK for use of their ships & bases, so many Doctor Who episodes would be all cheap looking studio work.  Pretty much an action romp and a fun ride.

  Warriros of the Deep is the turkey here.  The epitome of bad Doctor Who.  I think it's not so bad, the script has lots of promise.  They were just too ambitious and very rushed on the job.  I like Davison as the Doctor and think he's underrated.  The Silurians and Sea Devils come off much weaker here and different from their eariler appearences.  The sea base is overly lit and has no atmosphere, the Myrka creature is laughable and on screen too long, the battle scenes have no sense of drama or danger, the Doctor conveniently finds anti-reptile gas, everyone but our regulars die off by the end.  They did better later in this season  with Resurrection of the Daleks.  Here, the closing line says it all...""there should have been another way.""

Overall, a good purchae for hard core Doctor Who fans, even WOTD is worth it for extras and audio commentaries from the cast about how bad it all was.",1217203200,,2268,4.463414634146342
3354744,5,B0013XZ6T8,"Several times on the bonus material for ""Doctor Who and the Silurians"", then-script editor Terrance Dicks explains the origins for that story's eponymous villain.  With the Doctor exiled to Earth and the TARDIS disabled, Dicks was told by one of his writers that the show was now limited to just two story types: alien invasion, and mad scientist.  Realizing he was painted into a corner, Dicks decided to invert the scenario by commissioning an alien invasion from a species that was already on Earth before man rose to prominence.

Thus was born the Silurians, the memorable (and mis-named) villains that recurred on ""Doctor Who"" enough times to fill out their own box set.  The opening story, from 1970, is the longest and most intriguing: a team of scientists in the caves under Derbyshire inadvertently awaken a hibernating reptilian species that had been asleep for tens of millions of years.  First in secret and then in the open, the Silurians attack not only the scientists but then all of mankind.  From a low-key opening episode, the stakes escalate until the world is threatened by an Ebola-type virus in part six.

""Silurians"" was Malcolm Hulke's first solo contribution to the series (he'd previously co-authored two Second Doctor episodes) and he became a mainstay of the Third Doctor's run on the show.  DVD extra features are strong: the deepest audio commentary booth to date (seven show contributors rotate in and out) provides tons of insights; guest actor Geoffrey Palmer narrates a terrific documentary that compares the relatively gentle pace of the 1970 serial to today's more condensed and frenetic adventures.  This choice of narrator is brilliant, to coin a phrase: not only did Palmer guest-star in a recent new ""Who"" episode, but his son also directed four episodes last season.

The second story, ""The Sea Devils"", is Hulke's sequel to the earlier story, featuring the inadvertent revival of a marine cousin to the Silurians.  This is a far more action packed episode: the Doctor and the Master have a lengthy swordfight in episode two, and the cooperation of the Royal Navy leads to several land and sea combat sequences in the closing installments.  There's a submarine subplot, and two comedy sequences that have since been duplicated in new ""Who"": the Master captivated by a children's television programme, and the Doctor and Jo staging a lengthy mime sequence through a plate-glass window.

The ""Sea Devils"" bonus features are highlighted by an unusual commentary booth: Dicks, producer Barry Letts, and show director Michael Briant exchange the usual compliments and potshots, but this time they're joined by Andrew Cartmel, the show-runner for ""Doctor Who""'s final three seasons.  Cartmel's run was characterized by tight internal continuity and very little navel-gazing into the series' past: to have him discuss a story nearly 20 years before his time gives fascinating insight into the type of ""Who"" he later chose to produce.

The final DVD, ""Warriors of the Deep"", comes from much later in series history (it opens the Fifth Doctor's final season in 1984) and has aged the least gracefully of the three stories.  This time, there's no debate on whether or not the Silurians and Sea Devils can co-exist with the human upstarts, they're just out on a highly effective seek-and-destroy mission.  There's hardly a smile to be had in 90 minutes, and the only survivor among the large guest cast does so impliedly and offscreen.  Ingrid Pitt, the queen of horror flicks, has a thankless small role which doesn't allow her to exchange so much as a word of dialogue with the Doctor; her exit from the show was later derided by writer Johnny Byrne on an Internet newsgroup as ""the mother of all drop-kicks"".

The extras for ""Warriors"" are perhaps harsher than they need to be.  Everyone involved in production -- director, writer, actors, visual effects designer -- shows up to get their kicks in.  ""Warriors"" was one of my first stories as a young fan in 1984 and I'm sorry to see the story hasn't matched my memories; however, having everyone involved throw stones at it 25 years later is perhaps a bit much.

On the whole, though, the box-set features the entire Silurians/Sea Devils running story, with two classic Doctors and a boatload of moral dilemmas.  Even if the best material comes at the beginning of the set, it's still a fascinating release.",1215388800,3,4390,4.991769547325103
3354745,5,B0013XZ6T8,"Doctor Who can be a pretty deep show sometimes. And that goes for the three stories in this aptly named box-set both in the usual figurative sense and quite literally as well. That is, the unifying element in ""Doctor Who and the Silurians"" (1970), ""The Sea Devils"" (1972), and ""Warriors of the Deep"" (1984) is one of the most creatively imaginative set of antagonists the show has seen in its long history, and they antagonize from the depths of the earth and sea. The eponymous Silurians, that is, along with their equally eponymous semi-aquatic branch, the Sea Devils--a highly advanced and civilized race of reptilians that evolved on Earth long before we did, went into suspended animation underground and undersea to weather what they predicted to be a global catastrophe, and then overslept a bit until the technological advances of the mammalian hominids who evolved in their absence awoke them again. All three times they seek to retake the planet that once was theirs, each time the Doctor tries to broker a peaceful compromise between the two feuding sets of Earthlings, and each time mutual suspicion, xenophobia, and itchy trigger fingers prevail over the Doctor's voice of reason and compromise. Each story too invokes this complicated moral dilemma with cold war allegorical overtones within the confines of a thoroughly enjoyable science fiction thriller.

Each also has its own particularities too, of course. ""Doctor Who and the Silurians"" gets the whole concept going and is the strongest of the three storywise. Only the second story of the third Doctor's tenure (as expertly played by Jon Pertwee), it also starts establishing several key motifs of that era, including the Earthbound Doctor's characteristically eccentric vintage car. ""The Sea Devils"" takes the concept two years later and jazzes it up with more action and greater scale while complicating matters with the presence of the Doctor's Time Lord nemesis, the Master, who seeks to foment strife and discord quite as much as the Doctor seeks to defuse it. All of this has the slight drawback of simplifying the story to a slight degree, but the overall result is a delightfully quintessential sample of the Pertwee era. ""Warriors of the Deep"" attempts more than a decade later to update the concept and develop it further--a valiant attempt that due to a few errors of judgment as well as circumstances beyond anyone's control ends up falling far short. This is definitely the weakest link of the three, but it has some redeeming qualities (the model work and set design for the Silurian submarine and Sea Devil hibernation chamber are superb, for instance) and in any case it's one of those the fans love to hate, which is a distinction of sorts anyway.

Extras are never the deal-breaker with me (I consider them indeed extra), but the ones on these discs deserve special mention. The ""Silurians"" includes ""What Lies Beneath"", a highly informative and interesting look at the social history underlying the story as well as an examination of the manner in which it met the expectations of its time and addressed issues of immediate concern, considerably deepening the contemporary viewer's appreciation of this classic in the process. There is also an intriguing behind-the-scenes take on the extremely experimental music featured in the two Pertwee stories--Doctor Who was pioneering the real future sound of London, playing with bizarre soundscapes and electronic harmonies way ahead of its time. For its part, ""Warriors"" includes ""The Depths"" wherein everybody from the writer and the key actors onwards has a good time ripping on this poor beleaguered tale--most extras include nothing but hype and hyperbole, only the Doctor Who crew has the guts to reflect at length on their own fumbles and have a good laugh doing so.

In any case, this is overall a fine DVD set of classic Doctor Who storylines scattered in time but highlighting one of the show's more inventive concepts together with its later permutations. And for the obsessive-compulsive fans such as myself, each of the three stories is in a separate, self-contained case so that they can be taken out of the box and placed in chronological order with one's other Doctor Who DVDs if one so chooses. Getting them together as a set is still the more convenient and frugal option, of course, unless one has a particular interest in only one of the three. In that case, they can be purchased singly as well:

If you do not have any of these episodes, this is the best way to get them. I calculated the cost for the three dvd's on their own and is as follows:

Silurians - $21.48&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Doctor-Who-and-The-Silurians-Story-52/dp/B00142UZ9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Doctor Who and The Silurians (Story 52)</a>
Sea Devils - $13.79&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Sea-Devils-Story-62/dp/B00147F8YQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Sea Devils (Story 62)</a>
Warriors - $13.58&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Warriors-of-the-Deep-Story-131/dp/B00142UZ9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Warriors of the Deep (Story 131)</a>
Total: $48.85

The total is reflective of going with the Amazon Prime price but, even if you used the lowest priced brand new copy plus shipping charges, you would still be in the same range of the total listed above. There is no reason to purchase these separately as the DVD's are the EXACT SAME ones as listed above. The difference is the box holding them together and, of course, the cheaper cost. For only about $2 more you get 3 episodes instead of just Doctor Who and the Silurians. TL;DR - JUST BUY IT! Best value for the episodes contained.

In regards to the story quality, like I said, Warriors is the worst of the three. However, both Silurians and Sea Devils in the set are classic episodes to own. Silurians is a deeper episode than realized upon the gray nature of dealing with supposed invaders. Sea Devils is the season 3 opener which has the Master, the fantastic Roger Delgado, coming up against the Doctor while in prison. It also contains a famous swordfight between the two Time Lords and shows the Master actually respects the Doctor, which is a bit different from the other incarnations of the new series. It is a great couple of episodes to really give you a feel for the fantastic era of Jon Pertwee. Over time, he has grown on me more and more with quality episodes like these.

A great add to any Whovian collection, whether their first Doctor was Eccleston (like mine) or as far back as Hartnell. PLUS, you get the fantastic Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart and you really can't pass on the Brigadier.",1451865600,2,2707,5.595121951219512

8253305,4,B0013XZ6T8,"The two reviews before mine, really sum this up well.

The two stories involving 3 are just wonderful.  Great writing, love the Master, and the Doctor just knocks it out of the park.

Unfortunately, 5 doesn't get as much love with the writing.  He tries, he really tries, but the story isn't there.  There is also some rewriting of history about the Silurians, which is explained as the writer didn't really understand the first two stories (thank you to the info facts on the release)

Some really neat extras as well.  Well worth picking up, to see the full story of the Silurians.

Interesting fun fact - the original Jabba the Hutt appears briefly!",1395360000,,652,4.657894736842105
8253306,4,B0013XZ6T8,"The Silurians: A great story with a strong moral dilemma, however, it can feel very padded at times. All around performances are good, and Jon Pertwee gives a fantastic performance, considering that this is only his second story. I love the design of the Silurians, but not so much the design of the dinosaur. Overall, great story. 8/10

The Sea Devils: A really good story, but not the classic it's considered to be. Once again, Jon Pertwee is on top form, and the supporting cast is really good. It is a very atmospheric story, and I love the scenes in the prison with Roger Delgado as the Master. Another fantastic story from the Pertwee years. 7/10

Warriors of the Deep: Oh, boy. This one was a complete dud. I mean, where do I begin? I cannot think of a single thing, save the last 5 minutes, that I liked about this story! The characters are unlikeable, the acting is dull, the production values are horrible, and- what did they do to you, Silurians? The redesign is awful. The voices are waaay too high, and the heads look awful. The Sea Devils keep the design from their previous story, and I really like it, but what is up with the samurai suits? It makes absolutely no sense at all! And don't even get me started on the pacing. Everything is thrown at you in the first five minutes, making the next 87 minutes as dull as a brick. Like I said, the last five minutes are great, and it's the fact that the story ends on such a powerful note that's keeping me from giving it a 2. So, in conclusion, ""Warriors of the Deep"" is a missed opportunity. 2.5/10.

Overall, what do I think of this boxed set? Well, even though ""Warriors of the Deep"" is one of my least favorite stories, I'd still say go for it and buy the set if you're a fan of Pertwee. I bought this with ""The Ambassadors of Death"", and got a great deal for both, so if you still haven't decided on whether or not you're going to buy this boxed set, I'd say go for it. It will give you hours of entertainment.",1377993600,,1976,4.306451612903226
8253307,4,B0013XZ6T8,"This is an interesting boxed set.  As far as I know, it's the only one containing Doctor Who stories that aren't in order, so it gives you a chance to compare stories from different seasons.  It's great for the most part.  Here's a review for each story.

Doctor Who & the Silurians: The first 4 episodes are really good, but then it starts to drag a bit.  But even then there are things that grab your attention, most of all the ending.  Despite the silly costumes, the Silurians were rather interesting.  Not the best but when it's good it's great. 4 stars.

The Sea Devils:  I remember last year when SciFiNow did an article on the 3rd Doctor with the top 10 DVDs of his to buy, they put this as #1.  I was looking forward to it, & it did not disappoint.  It wasn't just the best story on the set, it was the best Jon Pertwee story I've ever seen.  Something else that I should mention, this is the best 6 part Doctor Who I've ever seen.  After seeing the Silurians I thought I'd never see a 5 star Doctor Who adventure that was longer than 4 parts aside from the First Doctor story I reviewed.  It was especially despairing when I saw that only 10 at most of Pertwee's stories were less than 6 parts.  But no, we get one where hardly a minute feels wasted.  The Master was great, the Sea Devils looked cooler than the Silurians, the action was great; this was just an excellent story.  And no matter what, Jon'll always be my favorite pre-Tom Baker Doctor.  5 stars.

Warriors of the Deep:  And it's all downhill from here.  While I can say that the 5th Doctor is in my next 3 favorite Doctors (along with Jon Pertwee & Sylvester McCoy), this is the worst episode of the original Doctor Who I have ever seen.  The team up between the Silurians & the Sea Devils is fairly interesting, and there are other moments; but it just doesn't work.  Like other people say, the Doctor should have realized that the chance of peace was too far gone for him to tell the humans to not kill them.  And that horrible looking monster, when did the Doctor ever see something like that?  This is just not very good.  2 stars.

So, that averages out to 3.6, rounded up to 4 because of the excellent special features & because I love Doctor Who so much.  In conclusion, if you happen to buy this set, don't bother with Warriors of the Deep.  In fact, I see no reason to go out of your way to get it at all.  Sea Devils is the only real must buy, and Silurians is worth buying too, but Warriors of the Deep is best left off of your shelf.",1362441600,,2520,4.222222222222222
