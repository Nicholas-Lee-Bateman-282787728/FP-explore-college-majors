8599110,3,B00DYC6GHM,Gene Raymond was NO where in this dvd.  I don't know why it is listed here.  I ordered it because I wanted to see Mr. Raymond.  It was mildly interesting for a perious look at the late 40's -- so I gave it 3 stars.  Probably I should have given it one since it was not as advertised.,1445299200,,283,3.8275862068965516
