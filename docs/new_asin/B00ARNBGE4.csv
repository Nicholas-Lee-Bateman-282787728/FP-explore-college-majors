5494886,5,B00ARNBGE4,Greetings Folks - this video is a masterwork in itself.  The subject matters is treated with respect.  It is obvious that this team of film makers is focused on quality.,1357516800,2,169,4.6
8556972,5,B00ARNBGE4,I actually saw an exhibit of these chess sets at The Detroit Institute of Arts  few years ago.  They were beautiful and interesting.  I was glad to see this DVD available as it provides information about various chess sets in this fabulous collection.,1387670400,,251,4.790697674418604
8556973,5,B00ARNBGE4,What an interesting video!  These chess sets are truly works of art and can be appreciated by everyone.  I enjoyed the commentary and the highlights of each set.,1381363200,,161,4.714285714285714
8556974,5,B00ARNBGE4,"This is a really interesting video.  About an hour long with narration by the collector George Dean and some others.  Very well filmed with lots of close-ups of the sets.  These are beautiful, amazing works of art, and Dean's stories are entertaining.  Highly recommended to anyone interested in chess, chess sets or the decorative arts.  The Blu-ray looks great.",1378857600,,363,5.084745762711864
8556975,5,B00ARNBGE4,"As someone who loves world travel, antique objects, and interesting stories, I really enjoyed ""Chess Masterworks."" In many ways, it's not really about the game of chess at all, although I think most avid chess players would appreciate it. I would recommend it especially to art historians, but also to anyone who collects or just appreciates handmade and historical objects and the intriguing questions and stories that accompany them. When were they made? How were they made? Why were they made? For whom were they made? The mini-documentaries create a fascinating tapestry, weaving together the pieces of chess sets with art, culture, history, politics, religion, and philosophy. From the wacky Salvador Dali chess pieces which were made from casts of his thumbs, fingers, and nipples, to the Communist Propaganda pieces glorifying the virtues of the communist revolution, to the whimsical Sea Life set with lobster bishops and sea horse knights, to the abstract Persian Muslim Silver Mushroom pieces, each mini-documentary presents a set so original in the way it was handcrafted and so historically different from the one before it, that you don't get bored watching and are excited to see what is going to be next. Perhaps what I enjoyed most was the way that ""Chess Masterworks"" appeals heavily to the tactile sense with glorious high definition shots of chess pieces made of jade, quartz, clay, topaz, silver, gold, crystal, ivory, ebony, porcelain, bronze, pearl, wood, coins, amber, and the list goes on. I found myself wanting to reach out and touch the pieces.

As a professor of Arabic language and someone who has spent a lot of time traveling in the Middle East, I particularly enjoyed viewing some of the more abstract Islamic chess sets such as the 19th century Woven Moroccan and the 17th century Muslim Silver Mushroom. I also was very intrigued by Dr. George and Vivian Dean's life story and travels and how they came to own this world-renowned collection of chess sets.

The combination of the dazzling visuals and the music selections is mesmerizing. ""Chess Masterworks"" transports you momentarily to other times and places and realms and it's a journey you want to keep repeating (if only to fantasize that you own all these jewels!) The next time I see a chess exhibition going on, I may actually go check it out now--something I never thought I would say!",1363564800,,2379,5.020253164556962

8556978,5,B00ARNBGE4,"Everything about this video is incredible! I've played chess for years and years and never thought it would make for a moving story. Boy was I wrong!

I found myself quickly engrossed in the amazing cinematography, camera angles and historical back story of each set... all wrapped by a hauntingly beautiful musical soundstage that choreographed each edit. Very beautiful and educational. Wouldn't be surprised to see it in the future as a special on The History Channel or TLC.",1361664000,,478,5.050632911392405
