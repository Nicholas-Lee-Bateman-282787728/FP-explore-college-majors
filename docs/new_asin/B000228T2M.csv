8020668,5,B000228T2M,"Like any hard to take reviewer let me provide some backstay :

This underrated series is based on the underrated (at least in America) Konami video games.  What I've always admired about the Mystical Ninja games is that though they have silly, quirky aspect to them, they also contain a lot of substance.  This anime series follows in the same vein.

While this series does introduce characters that are exclusive to the series, I can guarantee you that these characters DO NOT DETRACT from the main  characters that we ""all"" know and love (should I also put that in quotes?)

Though I prefer the original Japanese actors since they are the original, and they are also the original actors that voice the game's characters, THE ENGLISH VERSION IS ALSO VERY WELL EXECUTED AND IS WORTHY OF BEING HEARD AS WELL.

Some of the effective ideas are discussed within the interviews that help them in presentation of effective reads.  It is interesting to note what can affect one's read of a specific line.  (I hope I'm being clear enough)

On another note, I have heard people  wonder about the still picture that appears after each intro.  My best guess would be that is the background used in the original broadcast version that mentions sponsors, etc.

If I can only inspire one person to check out this series... I still would not be satisfied as this series (as well as the whole Goemon series in general) deserves more credit than it receives in America.",1090627200,6,1452,4.714285714285714
