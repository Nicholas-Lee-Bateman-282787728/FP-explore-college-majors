8465624,4,B004HY50BY,"A very warm movie. To see two people fall inlove again.
I don't believe in an immortal soul. So I just moved  on from that.
Hate sad endings though.",1387843200,,148,4.103448275862069
8465625,5,B004HY50BY,This was a great find. Someone had mentioned it as one of their favorite love stories of all time so I wanted to see the movie. The scenery was breathtaking and the characters well played. It really touched on how the family connected with each other and all the emotions that come with problems that have to be faced. I'm really glad that I took the time to find it and watch it. It's a keeper.,1371600000,,395,4.2105263157894735
8465626,5,B004HY50BY,"It's just my favorite movie of all times. with this one I became a fan of asian drama movies. the acting and feel of the whole story is great. It's just too diferent from the regular drama - romantic movies, but is not weird or something like that...is just perfect. the scenary is also amazing!! you just want to know those places.",1345075200,,332,4.370967741935484
