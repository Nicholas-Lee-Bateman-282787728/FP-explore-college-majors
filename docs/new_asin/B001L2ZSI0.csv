8316989,5,B001L2ZSI0,The dvd came in a great timely fashion and the quality was excellent. I am very pleased!,1494720000,,88,4.235294117647059
8316990,5,B001L2ZSI0,"I originally saw this PPV back in 2008 with some friends and one of the local bars/restaurants. Was an awesome night with an amazing fight card. One thing is if you are a fan of long drawn out fights that end in decisions then this DVD is not for you lol. The thing that was so great about this event was every fight was exciting with great finishes. With a KO here and a TKO there this fight card definitely delivered. I started revisiting this event and thinking this is the one event I should definitely have one DVD, found it on Amazon and when I finally got the money I purchased it. The DVD has I think an extra 5 preliminary fights? Not entirely sure but I know there was a lot of fights on the DVD and all of them were good! So if you're a fan of UFC and want a good DVD to watch, I definitely suggest this one.",1346544000,,819,4.030674846625767
8316991,5,B001L2ZSI0,"Even the Prelim fights are awesome to watching.  I'll give you a breakdown.

Dave Evensen vs. Pat Barry: Impressive fight for Pat's debut.  I gotta say (SPOILER!) I have never seen a TKO from a leg kick.
Ryo Chonan vs. Brad Blackburn: Another VERY impressive fight.  Something is going on for all 3 rounds and by the 3rd round it's anyone's game who can win the fight.
Matt Hamill vs. Reese Andy: Another impressive fight.  Wonderful exchanges.  Not boring at all.
Antoni Hardonk vs. Mike Wessel: Considering I had no idea who either of these guys were I had no clue how the fight was gonna go.  It went REALLY well.  Great fight to watch.  You won't be disappointed. I hadn't seen knees that damaging since Silva vs. Franklin
Yushin Okami vs. Dean Lister: ....This one is a little boring.  You got a pure grappler against a guy who's got good hands AND good ground game.  Not a good match.  Maybe still worth a watch.
Cheick Kongo vs. Mostapha Al Turk: Ignoring the nutchecks, wonderful display from both fighters.  Good exchanges.  Good scrambles.  Good fight.
Wanderlei Silva vs. Quinton Jackson: Watch it! ...enough said right?
CB Dollaway vs. Mike Massenzio: Don't look away or you'll miss it.
Antonio Nogueira vs. Frank Mir: Wonderful fight. Kind of one sided but it's still amazing to see heavy weights throw blows like this.
Forrest Griffin vs. Rashad Evans: I gotta say, after rewatching this fight I'm surprised how it turned out.  The first two rounds are full of clean and spot on striking with dominance in the octagon.  So the end result was really a comeback victory.  I don't like Rashad, but he looked clean with his strikes and so did Forrest.  Forrest just pummeled away and was a class act the whole fight and even after the fight.  I'm almost never upset to see Forrest Griffin fight.

All in all, this is an awesome card.  The prelim fights are just as action packed as the main card fights and the main card fights are just awesome.  Brock also makes and appearance, and I have to say that I actually liked him here.  He didn't act like a douche or do the whole ""Brock Lesnar this and that"" crap.  He acted like a normal fighter and said some things that actually let you know that he's not a total clown.

Great buy, totally worth it.  If you're a UFC fan than this is worth a watch.",1345766400,,2307,4.523002421307506
8316992,5,B001L2ZSI0,"This is one of the only DVDs I own that has no submission endings. However, out of the ten fights on the card, only two go the distance. What does that tell you? The most vicious strikers on the planet came out to play on December 27, 2008! This DVD features the UFC debut of Pat Barry.
Dave Evensen/Pat Barry-5/5
Ryo Chonan/Brad Blackburn-4.5/5
Matt Hamill/Reese Andy-4/5
Antoni Hardonk/Mike Wessel-5/5
Yushin Okami/Dean Lister-4/5
Cheick Kongo/Mostapha Al Turk-4.5/5
Wanderlei Silva/Quinton Jackson-5/5
CB Dollaway/Mike Massenzio-5/5
Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira/Frank Mir-5/5
Forrest Griffin/Rashad Evans-5/5

Most fights on the card would be worthy of a fight of the night bonus on any other card. A Yahoo! users poll ranked this the best UFC event of all time. While I believe that honor goes to UFC 95, the card makes an extremely strong case and any card with Matt Hamill, Antoni Hardonk, and Cheick Kongo is an automatic win. This is a great DVD to introduce others to the sport.",1281744000,,983,5.030674846625767
8316993,5,B001L2ZSI0,I own all ufc's from 1 thru 93 on either DVD or VHS. They are awesome.,1246752000,,70,3.4375
8316994,5,B001L2ZSI0,"For UFC 92, a treat was offered up as far as the main card goes. The question is, would it deliver? Three big fights were featured, and they were all hyped up! Would this card deliver?

The Main Event was 1 of 2 title fights. It featured TUF 1 Winner, and Light Heavyweight Champion, Forrest Griffin, taking on TUF 2 Winner, and undefeated Rashad Evans. Forrest's take on this was simple, ""Every great fighter should lose a fight, Rashad should lose too. I'm going to help him do that."" Rashad just wants to take out Forrest before Forrest takes him out.

The 2nd title fight is Interim, and the winner gets Brock Lesnar. So Antonio Nogueira and Frank Mir will fight to decide who that will be. MINOTAURO has never been stopped in a fight. And Mir has finally showed his old self since his accident. Is he still getting better, or will he get beaten by the best?

The 3rd fight featured is a grudge match. Quinton RAMPAGE Jackson and Wanderlei Silva do not like each other. In Pride, Silva devastated Jackson, and his mission is to destroy him once again. Rampage wants Wanderlei to take this beating personally. Who will get their wish?

There are a total of 10 fights in ULTIMATE 2008. I will list them below.

Dan Evensen vs. Pat Barry: Pat Barry would tell you that Evensen is a striker until he gets hit by a real striker. Evensen, who's victories mainly consist of KO's, would prefer to get this victory by submission. Somebody gets what they want in the middle of round 1.

Ryo Chonan vs. Brad Blackburn: Both want the KO, but one gets a unanimous decision. Good scrap!

Matt Hamill vs. Reese Andy: After a 3 round snoozer with Vera, Andy wants to redeem himself. Hamill wants people to know why he's called THE HAMMER! A 2nd round TKO answers all questions.

Antoni Hardonk vs. Mike Wessel: Strength and conditioning meets some of the best leg kicks this side of MMA. This scrap ends with a 2nd round TKO.

Yushin Okami vs. Dean Lister: Who wants this fight more? Okami is always a tough battle, and Lister's already coming into this with black eyes, despite a world class ground game that submitted Jeremy Horn! The least notable fight on the card, but interesting the whole way, goes to a unanimous decision.

Cheick Kongo vs. Mostaph Al Turk: Kick Kongo in the package, he'll give you one right back! And then the fight will end before the 1st round ends!

Wanderlei Silva vs. Quinton RAMPAGE Jackson: Somebody's going home very happy after the 1st round KO!! WOW!!!

C B Dollaway vs. Mike Massenzio: They've already wrestled, and now they meet on the big stage!! And one wins by 1st round TKO.

Antonio Nogueira vs. Frank Mir: In the 2nd round, a first occurs, and the man who earns the right to fight Lesnar can't wait!!

Forrest Griffin vs. Rashad Evans: In a way, who would've thought? In another way, you can't be that surprised. A 3rd round finish, and great respect, regardless.

Check out UFC 92, and find out why it was called ULTIMATE 2008!",1246752000,2,2961,4.5394736842105265
8316995,5,B001L2ZSI0,"...2008 went out with a serious bang with UFC 92. If you collect these DVD's as I do, this is a must purchase. The card having 2 title fights including an epic third meeting between Wanderlei Silva & Quinton Jackson. The event is packed full of surprises and other very good fights. I would recommend this DVD to any fan hands down...",1243209600,,334,4.403225806451613
8316996,5,B001L2ZSI0,"well lets just start by saying this was supposed to be the best card of the year with the interim HW title on the line (antonio noguiera vs frank mir) the LHW belt on the line (forrest vs rashad) and a 3rd fight (1st in the octagon) between Wanderlei Silva and Quniton Jackson.

all 5 fights that were on the main card ended by stoppage. cb dolloway and cheik kongo were also on the main card. there were a few some what boring fights in the prelims and all in all i thought ufc 84 was better but this is hands down a great card. the 3 big fights on this card were all somewhat shockers and ended in great fashion... one of the men who was tko'd had never been stoppend by ko or submission.

ufc 92 and ufc 84 would be two dvds id take with me if i could only have 5 mma dvds... highly recomend",1240531200,,794,3.9874213836477987
