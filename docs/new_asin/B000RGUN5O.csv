8200577,4,B000RGUN5O,"This video is a great addition to any fans of SRK and Saif Ali Khan.  I was just blown away by the tremendous production put on by several top Bollywood stars.  At times, the quality of the filming is not as high as I'd like it to be, but this was valuable for folks who just didn't have a chance to these guys on tour.  To see Saif Ali Khan play the guitar was just priceless.  He is quite amazing.  I had not seen that before.  And it was wonderful to see SRK interact with the audience.  That kind of interaction is a lost art in live performances.",1346716800,3,551,4.046296296296297
8200578,5,B000RGUN5O,For those of us that hadn't discovered Shahrukh khan at the time but have now it's the next best thing to being at one of his concerts. He is really quite the showman as well as all the people in the show. Fantastic. I would highly recommend getting this DVD.,1303603200,11,259,4.2
