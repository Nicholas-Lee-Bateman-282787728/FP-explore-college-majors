1256780,3,B000034DE3,"OK, so this DVD packager got hold of what I guess were 7 public domain episodes of Petticoat Junction. But they discovered that the theme song is not public domain, so they put on some generic pickin' and grinnin' music where the theme song is supposed to be! That's pretty irritating but until a real box set is available, this will have to do.",1093824000,15,345,4.40625
1256781,1,B000034DE3,"Everyone should buy this dvd......NOT!!!!!!!! This is one of my all time favorite shows and they really made a mess of it. The quality was bad and the theme song...WAS GONE!!!!!
Simply this, don't waste your money. If you never saw ""Petticoat Junction"", you're in for a treat, but don't watch it this way. Wait for a qulified company to put it out. Doesn't even deserve one star.",1070064000,54,379,4.588235294117647
1256782,2,B000034DE3,"For people who just want to casually view the episodes this is OK, but collectors will be disappointed with the quality.  For me the best part of the whole show is missing.  The main theme, beginning and end, has been overdubbed with some really hokey banjo music.  Unfortunately, the theme was the main reason I bought the disc.  Being a rail fan I was also disappointed that none of the episodes featured the train or railroad.
Technically, this is not a good copy.  It doesn't look like the film was cleaned and treated before it was transferred.  There are white spots and blotches throughout.  The master was not aligned well frame-to-frame the background motion makes me feel like I'm standing on the deck of a ship.  It is especially noticeable in the introduction still shots of the water tower and hotel.  Finally, one can see the jittery 25 fps compression. While being the nature of a DVD I think it is exaggerate by the poor alignment of the transfer.  Note, this review is based on viewing on a Pioneer Elite DVL-91.",1016236800,29,1029,4.6353591160221
1256783,5,B000034DE3,I'm 20 years old and hooked on Petticoat Junction. My mother got me into it a few years back and I've watched it every day and night since then. I have a huge poster adorning my wall and other great memorabilia. I recently recieved this video and absolutly loved it. Escpecially all the old commercials which I've obviously never seen before.

Yes, you can get these two episodes else-where without commercials, but that is part of the word ""CLASSIC"", the  commercials add that special something. And the price was great.

1256799,4,B000034DE3,"As a fan of Petticoat Junction, plus the fact that these restored episodes look and sound great, it's an automatic 4 stars from me.  But for those of us who previously purchased the complete season sets, it's a double-dip.  All 8 episodes included here are from seasons 1-3, which are available in their entirety.  But if you don't want to invest in those (and if you're a fan, you really should, in my opinion), this is an excellent sampler.  The disc presents 6 black & white and 2 color episodes, and they're all good choices.  And since this is an official release, the A/V quality is much better than those bargain-bin collections that have been around for years.

Like I said, I'm a fan, and I'll support any official release.  But I'll probably use this more as a way to introduce others to the show.",1426809600,8,807,4.524137931034483

The Paramount series contains commentary by Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo,  the original music played before, during, and at the end of the show plus the video quality is better.  This version of Petticoat Junction has lower video quality and the original music has been stripped out and replaced by a banjo filler which detracts from the show if you have ever seen an original episode.  This DVD does not contain the original theme song while the Paramount DVD does.  The Paramount DVD looks and sounds just like the original episodes without the commercials.

Well I do not like beer myself, but if I met a handsome man, I would do what the mother and the daughters do...cook him a good meal and tell him, if you want a beer, go get it and I will see you tomorrow.  tHIS IS A OLD SCHOOL TYPE SHOW WITH OLD SCHOOL IDEALS, and I am old school.

I bought this set on Black Friday at Target, because this is one of my favorite classic sitcoms, and there was only one copy on the shelf.  When I got home to watch it, I heard the replacement theme, and it was terrible.  They replaced the classic, memorable theme with a song called ""The Train That Carried My Girl From Town"", which is a real song, but the cover they used is terrible, and doesn't fit the show.

The opening and closing theme are replaced with this song, and any time the song is used in the show, itself, it's covered up by that song.  It's a bit annoying to hear it every 5 minutes.  Maybe three stars is too much for this set.  But, for 16 episodes, at $5.00, (now on sale at Target for $4.75), I suppose it's worth it.

One day, I'll save up enough money to buy the official season sets, which have the original theme music, and include all kinds of special features!

Since posting this review, I now own the Official First Season, which I found at Big Lots, on Black Friday, for only $6.00!",1291334400,2,1063,4.301507537688442
1256818,4,B000034DE3,"An unexpected spin-off from ""The Beverly Hillbillies"", PETTICOAT JUNCTION expanded the rural atmosphere that had been established in the earlier CBS show, and finally gave longtime ""second banana"" Bea Benaderet her very own starring vehicle (no pun intended).

PETTICOAT JUNCTION revolved around the Shady Rest, the ""premiere hotel"" in Hooterville, run by widow Kate Bradley (Bea Benaderet) and her three lovely daughters - Billie Jo (Jeannine Riley), Bobbie Jo (Pat Woodell), and Betty Jo (Linda Kaye Henning).  Curmudgeonly old Uncle Joe (Edgar Buchanan) completed the family.

The main thrust of the series' comedy was the same as on ""Beverly Hillbillies"" - the culture clash of urban versus rural.  The railroad is constantly being threatened with closure by the C. & F.W. Rail Company, which would impact Kate's business and the lives of the Hooterville residents, who rely on the ""Cannonball"" train for their transportation  between Hooterville and Pixley.  PETTICOAT JUNCTION ran for seven seasons on CBS, and was soon joined by a second spin-off, ""Green Acres"".  Characters from ""Hillbillies"", ""Petticoat"" and ""Green Acres"" would subsequently intermingle and meet each other on the various shows.

Collected here on this budget DVD from Alpha are 7 episodes from the first season (""Spur Line to Shady Rest"", ""Please Buy My Violets"", ""A Night at the Hooterville Hilton"", ""Kate's Recipe for Hot Rhubarb"", ""Bobbie Jo and the Beatnik"", ""Last Chance Farm"", and ""Herby Gets Drafted"").

Especially for a show with such a noteable theme. Not only did they use this irritatingly cheezy, and irrelevant banjo jam, that doesn't even match. But your can hear where they spliced it over the original, and in some cases, you even hear reminents of the original underneath creating cacophony. SHAME, shame shame,on whoever decided to produce this. It ruins the whole show.

They probably paid some sap $20. to sit in his living room and jam to a cassette, and then retained the copyright. Meanwhile, Curt Massey's name remains on the credits. They also abused the Beverly Hillbillies expensive Dvd sets with this same track!!

The reason the theme song was replaced might be this: the company that put out these DVD's is obviously a hack outfit. The program themselves may be public domain, but the theme song may not be. Hence, they can release the video, which is no longer copywrited (may have lapsed for whatever reason), but they cannot release a recording of the theme song, which is probably still under copywrite. Thus, they dubbed over the theme song and relesed a cheap-o version of the video.

You fans of this show will just have to wait for a decent release.",1097107200,13,752,4.402877697841727
1256833,3,B000034DE3,"I loved watching re-runs of this show in the late 70's when I was a kid. I remember the opening theme songs being a big part of what I liked about this show. There were 2 opening theme songs. The 2nd theme song replaced the 1st one when June Lockhart joined the cast. I have one of the other Petticoat Junctions DVD (No theme songs on that one Either) and though it has only 4 episodes verses the 7 on this DVD I like it just a bit better than this one. I guess it is because one of the episodes that is titled ""The Beatnik"" has Dennis Hopper playing the beatnik and I am a fan of most of his work. This DVD is a good buy especially if you are a big fan of the show. None of the shows are in color as advertised, and the picture quality isn't as clear and bright as it could be. But again, one of my biggest disappointments was the absence of the opening theme song. The theme song is replaced with very boring banjo music. If you like the opening theme songs as much as I do you can give them a listen. I had both of the opening theme songs to Petticoat Junction and thought I would share them with other fans of the show. They are both mp3's. I hope you enjoy listening to them. Petticoat Junction 1963-1970 (Opening Theme, 1) (...)",1094774400,18,1234,4.061475409836065
1256834,4,B000034DE3,"I remember watching Petticoat Junction when I was a young child in the late 70's. I loved this show. I also liked the opening theme song which is absent from this DVD. The theme song is replaced by banjo music. The absence of the theme song wasn't a big deal, but it would of been nice if the song had been added. Also, the container this DVD comes in is a piece of flimsy cardboard. But for the price it was still a very good deal. This DVD has 4 great episodes. They are:Bobby Jo and beatnik (With a very young Dennis Hopper playing the part of the beatnik)Last chancePlease buy violets andKate's recipeI hadn't seen an episode of Petticoat Junction in years until I got this DVD. I would love to have a complete box set of this show, but I don't think any complete compilations have been released, not yet anyway. I wonder why TV-Land has never picked up Petticoat Junction? Hopefully a box-set will be offered soon. If not I guess the fans of Petticoat Junction will have to wait and hope that TV-Land does start running this show. If you are a fan of Petticoat Junction I think you will enjoy this DVD very much.",1094688000,15,1117,4.349282296650718

Also, can the Bradley girls (with Shelia James) as the rock-and-rolling Ladybugs get to be as popular as (or even greater than) the Beatles? (They actually sang on the ""Ed Sullivan Show"" !)
