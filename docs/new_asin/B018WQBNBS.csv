7559300,3,B018WQBNBS,"The quality of the Blu-Ray is nothing short of fantastic.  The movie, being 37 years old and never having been released on any home format before, looks as good as expected.  The picture, especially what was blown up from a TV aspect ratio, does show its age.  But you can see and hear everything that is meant to be seen and heard.

Having said that, I purchased the Blu-Ray out of curiosity.  I loved ""The Gong Show"" when I was younger (and still look at the occasional clip on YouTube).  The story outside of ""The Gong Show"" also works, too.  However, Chuck Barris needed to hire a director to make his vision truly come to life.  While not a ""strike while the iron is hot"" product, nor a true vanity project, I think a seasoned director (like, say, co-writer Robert Downey, Sr.) would have turned this into a true film.

It's definitely worth viewing once.",1492992000,,860,4.496774193548387
7559301,5,B018WQBNBS,Just gonna comment on the transfer and picture quality. excellent. Great transfer for such a oddity that was never released on video. This Blu-ray is great. very happy with it.. thanks shout for an outstanding transfer to a so so movie...,1460332800,,238,4.829268292682927
7559302,4,B018WQBNBS,Definitely for Gong Show fans only... but funny as Hell.,1460160000,2,56,4.7
7559303,5,B018WQBNBS,its awesome. the gong show movie looks great on blu-ray i just had to buy it because i own 400 gong show episodes on dvd with the dvd quality. yes they are super clear with no commercials. i recorded these from the original broadcast right to dvd with no video tape involved.,1459814400,3,275,4.3076923076923075
7559304,5,B018WQBNBS,"I loved the TV show as a kid.  I love this movie.  Now, if they would sell the complete GONG SHOW TV SERIES on DVD in a box set.  I'd be even happier.  But the movie will do just fine.",1459209600,7,184,3.525
7559305,4,B018WQBNBS,"I like Acee's review. I don't agree with it, but I like it. I'm not sure why something popular  with the ""uneducated"" precludes it from being a cult film. The fact that the review above yours was written based on a bootleg VHS bought on eBay proves it to be a cult film. It's not about how the show was created at all. Far from it. It's about how the show ended. Even Barris knew it was made too late. And it really does NOT have a narrative. Unless it's ""let's all watch Chuck Barris have a mental collapse.""
 Someone once said The Gong Show, and the movie, probably belong in a time capsule. I would agree. Not too long ago, I bought every episode of the show on bootleg DVD. Every show! I sat down, put in on, and waited to have an all-night marathon! After three episodes, I turned it off. And I'm sure after receiving the Bluray on its release day, I'll watch about a quarter of it, turn it off. Put it on the shelf and maybe revisit it in 20 years.",1459036800,,954,4.123655913978495
7559306,4,B018WQBNBS,"Despite having been a TV smash in the 1970s, with its own spin-off bubble gum cards, the Gong Show Movie was made a bit too late. Despite Chicago having many cinemas, it was screened for a week or less at no more than two of them, due to the all reviews being dismissively done in less than a paragraph. The programme itself was big with the uneducated (which disqualifies it from being a ""cult"" affair), and the hip, so critics and intellectuals simply had to turn their backs on it and embrace the latest flat flick from Woody Allen instead.  A shame really, because it was a mirror of several decades of American culture, with contestants of course choosing their own repertoire, to the amusement of viewers who happened to know the finer details of the century's music, from vaudeville to swing to polka to soul. As I remember it, the film contained some unbroadcastable out-takes but it was mainly the story of how the series was put on the air.  The university graduates should've recognised this as having a narrative.  Sadly, the TV version was beneath them and therefore the film had to be even lower.  So although it may well be that the many episodes of The Gong Show are better than The Gong Show Movie, the latter is probably all we've got. American rarely does self-irony, but if you want to lamp the 1970s, look here and not at John Travolta.",1455667200,7,1357,4.549180327868853
7559307,3,B018WQBNBS,"This is just an awful movie. Really, it's terrible. So why am I giving it three stars? Honestly, I don't know myself. I think it's just a nostalgia thing. You see, I grew up watching the Gong Show. I loved it as a kid. At the time, I was young. I had no idea there was a movie. In my 20s the movie version of 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' began production and the book it was based on came back into print. I read the book for the first time, and loved it. Around the same time Game Show Network began airing reruns of the Gong Show and I saw the series again for the first time in many, many years. It was at this time (the late 90s or early 2000s) that I first learned of the existence of the Gong Show Movie. The movie was not on DVD and had never been released on VHS, either. The movie was elusive. I became obsessed with seeing it....no easy task in those days. After over a year of searching, I found a bootleg VHS on ebay. I bought it and a bunch of friends (who shared my Gong Show obsession) and I had a Gong Show Movie viewing party. The movie was crap.

That said, the quest to find this film and the non stop hunting on the internet in the early 2000s gave it a shine that never tarnished. The fact that i can finally own a legal non-bootleg in HD is too delicious to pass up.

It's weird, I know. I can't explain it in a logical manner. This movie is so terrible, and yet I'm thrilled that come next month I'll finally own it on Blu-Ray.",1454457600,9,1455,4.0137931034482754
8743256,4,B018WQBNBS,"You can watch this as a time capsule. You can watch it as a fascinating study in determining the difference between an auteur film or a vanity project. Or you can just be happy to see uncensored clips from the show. If you were born after The Gong Show graced the airwaves or have no interest in celebrity-obsessed 70s pop culture, none of this will make sense.",1535500800,,361,4.402985074626866

Tried the dick in 2 other players and same result. , unrecognized disk  Now I can't get a trplacement or refud from seller.,
Not happy at all!! Stay away at you own risk  or try to play the disl as soon as you get it!",1531526400,,391,3.8625
8743259,5,B018WQBNBS,"Chuck Barris was such a crazy, fun-loving guy and this film captures it all very nicely. You get to see the things that the cowardly networks would not show on TV, which messed up the show completely. Many funny scenes from the show itself were included to relive all the fun. For any Chuck Barris fans and/or Gong Show fans, this movie is a MUST.",1523664000,,347,4.3538461538461535

8743263,2,B018WQBNBS,"This is mainly a movie about Chuck Barris being slowly driven into the ground with the pressures of doing The Gong Show. Yeah, there are some funny Gong Show acts in it but not nearly enough and too much stuff on Barris going nuts... which is not as funny as it sounds. It's downright dull actually. I would much rather have a 4 or 5 disc set of the craziest Gong Show moments rather than this rubbish. I was a Gong Show addict in the 1970s... never missed it.. but this movie left me cold.",1501459200,,490,4.168421052631579
