In the first five seconds, babies in life-threatening situations are shown panicking  or shivering. it's actually used as a teaser to draw you in! I took the DVD out immediately. It should be named Survival. It's my own stupid fault for imagining that there could exist even one nature documentary that doesn't monger fear and anxiety to catch or hold our interest. ""If your body were to get close to a black hole, it would spaghettify."" Dramatic, stressful music plays. Won't somebody, somewhere make DVDs that simply show relaxing, fascinating images of nature without the tactic of intense stress or sadness? I guess im the only one who would watch or buy that. Meerkat Manor came so close to being perfect, and I understand that we need to be educated, but they kept showing the dead baby over and over, milking it for all the extra drama it's worth. I'm already educated about survival of the fittest. I don't need to see it (or hear it, in the case of bleating) over and over and over. Then there is the opposite extreme of obnoxiousness if the shows are made for the young ones. I thought Jeff Corwin's show found a good balance, but it only ran for two seasons. Not enough fear mongering to keep it going. Can't we create a new kind of show which allows us the refreshing or relaxing experience of viewing animals' beauty, cuteness, or uniqueness?",1479600000,,1400,4.691056910569106
