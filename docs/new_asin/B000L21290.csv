2699589,5,B000L21290,"The DVD release of this series for U.S. viewing is a dream come true.  This is, by far, the best conceptualization of the Robin Hood mythos to date.  The writing, directing, casting, acting, and cinematography, not to mention the musical score by the Irish group, Clannad, is excellent. The entire cast is totally believable, and the powerful, omni-present, yet often understated, pagan aspect of Hern, the patron god of Sherwood forest, adds a much needed spiritual dimension to the rob from the rich, give to the poor stereotype.",1167609600,45,531,5.0227272727272725
2699590,5,B000L21290,"I have been waiting years for this series to be available on Region 1 DVD. The series is a re-telling of the adventures of Robin Hood. A mystical slant has been incorporated into many of the plots but is really not a main focal point except for a couple of the episodes. The cast is outstanding and their interaction is the drawing card of the series. Robin in the Hood is played by Michael Praed (Robin of Loxley) for eleven episodes. When he left the series, he was replaced by Jason Connery (Robert of Huntington) for the remaining thirteen episodes. The transition from one Robin to the next was done gracefully and with dignity. Judi Trott is a joy as Marian and does an amazing job in expressing her devastation at the loss of the first Robin and her slow, reluctant but ultimately growing love of the second Robin. What really sets this series apart from many others, for me, is the comaraderie between the characters: Loutish, kind-hearted Little John; surly, quick to anger but willing to do anything to protect the weak Will Scarlet; humorous, voice of reason Friar Tuck; rarely speaking, deadly assassin Nasir; simple, gullible Much. If you are a fan of television series that make you wish that you were part of the gang (ex. Firefly, The Paper Chase) then this is a series for you.",1167177600,65,1294,4.630434782608695

2699593,5,B000L21290,"Having been captivated by the 1938 classic, ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" -- and considering Errol Flynn to be the quintessential Robin in the equally quintessential tale of that great legend -- I was skeptical when I read so many reviews calling ""Robin of Sherwood"" the best version of Robin Hood ever done. Now, however, after watching this British TV series, I can proclaim that Robin of Sherwood is, indeed, in a class by itself. Flynn's movie must share its laurels with this 1980s masterpiece, if not actually step into its shadow.

The excellence of Robin of Sherwood encompasses so many facets, it defies confining a review to its more outstanding parts. The acting, writing, photography, lighting, attention to detail, setting, evocation of time and place, and musical score are all superb and one wonders why, for all this series' acclaim, it did not receive even more in the way of awards and recognition from its industry.

First and foremost, I will say that Robin of Sherwood would not be Robin of Sherwood without the brilliant casting of its male lead, Michael Praed. Perhaps the dominance of Flynn's 1938 film has prejudiced me, but I admit I have preconceived ideas about the ""look"" an actor requires to credibly convey the romantic image of Robin. Michael Praed embodies that look to a degree of almost unbelievable perfection. If archangels are vulnerable to jealousy, they must envy this man his face. He is simply so beautiful you feel a twinge of disappointment every time the camera leaves him. Yet his physical beauty in no way waters down the strength or masculinity of the character. We expect Robin Hood to be a man of action -- athletic, resourceful, excelling all others in swashbuckling feats of heroics -- and Michael Praed is, among his many other talents in the craft, a very physical actor. He literally throws himself into each action sequence, each clash with the opposition. Best of all, Praed is truly a gifted actor, one who brings nuance of expression and elegance to the character of Robin Hood, which enriches and adds new dimension and depth to Robin. We see Robin conveying a wide array of emotion  grief, frustration, bewilderment  not just the standard hyper-confidence and insouciance of the typical Robin Hood who mops up the floor with the evil Sherriff of Nottingham, Guy of Gisburne, and company. Oh, he does mop up the floor with the bad guys  and very nicely, too  but there is credibility to this version of the Robin Hood legend. Michael Praed enables us to see Robin as both hero and human and this actually makes the heroics of the film, the struggle between good and evil, that much more compelling and exciting.

The rest of the cast is also superb  with Nickolas Grace (the Sherriff of Nottingham) being particularly outstanding. The late Robert Addie (Sir Guy of Gisburne) does fresh things for his role and makes Gisburne very believable, not just a penny-dreadful, mustache-twirling villain. He and Grace craft wonderful portrayals of the evil opposition to the Merry Men. Grace, especially, chews up the scenery as the egomaniacal, bordering-on-insane Sherriff, while also managing to bring a light touch of buffoonery to the role. I have seen versions where the Sherriff is either detestable or inept to the point of caricature, but Grace's portrayal blends villainy and humor in a way that is effective and enjoyable. There are times when, as much as you despise the Sherriff, you have to laugh out loud at his zingers, especially when they are directed at the much-harassed and put-upon Sir Guy.

All the supporting cast give consistently fine performances, with Ray Winstone as the volatile Will Scarlet, Judi Trott as the ethereally lovely Lady Marian, Clive Mantle as Little John, Mark Ryan as Nasir, Phil Rose as Friar Tuck, and Peter Llewellyn Williams as the mentally-challenged miller's son, Much. Williams does a fine job with this character, which must be a challenging one to convey. Williams portrays Much with sensitivity and empathy and the character's adoration of his older, adopted brother, Robin, is very moving.

Joining the regular cast of talented performers, Robin of Sherwood features many outstanding guest stars, as well. John Rhys-Davies (King Richard), Phil Davis (Prince John), Angharad Rees (Jennet of Elsdon), and Katherine Levy (Sarah de Talmont) all give masterful performances that are well worth looking for. Rhys-Davies' portrayal captures much more of the historical Richard the Lionheart than we usually see, given the Lionheart was as prone to caprice and cruelty as to magnanimity. Davis convincingly portrays a vain, paranoid, and psychopathic Prince John. Study the effect of expression on Angharad Rees' face as she unwillingly betrays Robin and the Merry Men in ""The Witch of Elsdon"" and look for Katherine Levy's dressing down of Gisburne in ""The Children of Israel."" Good British actors (are there actually any bad ones?) seem to be a distinct cut above most of their American contemporaries and the collection of performances produced by this series certainly adds weight to that claim.

There are so many things to love about Robin of Sherwood. If you are a history buff, you will lose yourself in the conviction with which it transports you back to medieval England. If you enjoy an element of fantasy and mysticism mingled with your history, you will find that here, as well. The settings are incredibly beautiful, and romantic enough to satisfy the most poetic of souls. One of the outstanding accomplishments of Robin of Sherwood is how effectively it blends realism with the idyllic. As someone who loves British history, as well as the more romantic imaginings of that history, this is like watching the perfect blend of historical accuracy and fairy tale enchantment. Indeed, the entire series is like watching an opened book of classic fairy tales come to life  scene by scene, there is that alluring essence of ethereal beauty, wonder, and mystery.

Consistent with the grand adventure we expect from any treatment of Robin Hood, this series keeps the action rolling and I found the fight sequences to be particularly well done and exciting. In fact, they leave you wanting more, but perhaps that's a good thing. The sword-fighting sequences, especially those involving Praed, are a thing of beauty -- staging and skill raise the interaction to almost an art form, a choreography of dance. The archery sequences are also very convincingly rendered and breath-taking to watch. Another feature worth noting is the fact that this Robin Hood uses brain at least as much as brawn in outwitting his enemies. In many cases he simply outthinks them and, while I do recall this being a feature of Flynn's Robin in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood,"" I think it gets even greater play here.

Lastly, I want to address the question that has been raised as to Robin of Sherwood being ""anti-Christian."" I am, myself, a Christian, but you won't find a greater admirer of this series than I, which would not be the case if I felt this charge had any real merit. I would not watch anything that was disrespectful to Jesus Christ.

What is skewered in this film is not Christianity as practiced by a true follower of Jesus, but rather those who merely proclaim to be Christians while living in a completely antithetical way. It is historical fact that there was much corruption in the Church during the era featured in Robin of Sherwood. Certainly, there were devout Medieval men and women  such as Friar Tuck, in this piece  who truly modeled their professed faith; but many powerful, wealthy, and corrupt families sent their younger sons into ""service"" to the Church when actually these men served only themselves, wealth, and politics. Abbot Hugo, one of the villains of Robin of Sherwood, is just such a man. In one scene where he is taken prisoner by Robin, he asks the Prince of Sherwood: ""Have you no respect for the Church?"" Robin responds: ""Not while you're in it."" Clearly, disdain is being expressed for corruption in the Church not the Church, itself. Indeed, Friar Tuck is one of the main heroes of Robin of Sherwood and he is a Christian who is depicted very sympathetically. In fact, he stands by Robin when all the other Merry Men (except Much) desert him in ""The King's Fool"" episode. I found Tuck to be the most admirable and likeable of all Robin's band and, while he is tolerant of the differing religions around him (such as the paganism practiced by Robin and the others) I do not see that he abandons his Christianity, nor do Robin or the others ask him to do so. In ""The King's Fool,"" when the Merry Men are temporarily pardoned by Lionheart, Tuck expresses his determination not to return to the specific church run by the corrupt Abbot Hugo; Robin responds: ""Then be a Friar and live in the forest with us!"" Note he does not suggest Tuck abandon his Christian faith.

Moreover, in the episode,""The Children of Israel,"" the God of the Bible, the God Christians believe to be the Father of Jesus Christ, is represented in the respectful depiction of a devout Jewish family in their worship of Him. It is as though this version of the Robin Hood legend shows the reality of different faiths being practiced by different characters in the story, which is a true-to-life representation of what has usually gone on throughout history.

Personally, I would have preferred that Robin of Sherwood focus more on historicity with less emphasis on mysticism, but the mystic element was a new twist to the classic story and such a twist adds flavor. I also think the show's writer, Richard Carpenter, made some effort to be respectful of all the religions featured. Admittedly, it does seem that more of the characters who call themselves Christians are shown to be hypocritical and immoral, but again I would argue that these are nominal Christians only, not those who truly seek to emulate Jesus Christ; thus, it is false Christianity that is being attacked. We have the corrupt Abbot Hugo juxtaposed with the very virtuous Friar Tuck; we see the Jewish characters treated with great respect and the Saracen, Nasir, as one of the foremost heroes of the story; we see pagans who may not call themselves Christians but who display many Christian qualities.  In short, we see the writer expressing respect and tolerance of various religions.

In terms of moral accountability, Robin, himself, is a terrific role model. Time and again, he stands alone in his determination to do the right and noble thing. He refuses to kill his prisoners even when his men, especially Will Scarlett, put great pressure upon him to do so; he kills no one unnecessarily; he spares the lives of his greatest enemies, the Sherriff and Gisburne, again and again, despite their total lack of appreciation for this and their continued attempts on his life; he adores and is faithful to his wife, Marian; he has no desire to enrich himself through the plunder he takes from his enemies; and he patiently bears an incredible amount of grief from his own men, who often rebel against his leadership and question his every move -- I found myself wishing more than once  that he would just clock them! Needless to say, there is also the traditional emphasis upon defending the poor and oppressed, of interceding on behalf of the weak and vulnerable in the face of the cruelty so endemic to those times. The forces of evil -- witchcraft, Satanism, etc. --  are all consistently and roundly opposed throughout the series and in most ways this is actually a very moral tale which we could use so much more of in the television of today.

Like all the greatest stories, Robin of Sherwood manages to promote a moral lesson while spinning such an entertaining yarn the lesson is absorbed more effectively. Personally, I like a hero to be a hero  especially if he is a hero of legend, like Robin Hood  and this is the man who shines in Robin of Sherwood. He is not the flawed, morally-challenged ""hero"" we see so often in entertainment today; he is the Robin Hood we always believed in  noble, elegant of soul, brave of spirit, and pure of heart. In conclusion, Robin of Sherwood embodies an exquisite enrichment to the annals of this timeless legend. Once seen, you will never forget Robin of Sherwood  it will take up permanent residence in your heart.",1425081600,2,12333,4.876790830945558

2699604,4,B000L21290,"I must disclose: I cannot be an unbiased reviewer in this matter. I saw this series (and the episodes in Set Two) as a child, and it holds a special place in my heart; therefore I cannot be critical of it in a way that a new viewer might. That being said, I will do my best to address issues that new viewers may have with the series.

I love this series. Unabashedly. It was my first exposure to the Robin Hood legends (well, not counting the Disney movie with anthropomorphic animals, but...) and it expanded my already growing interest in medieval history and culture. I was about nine years old when my local PBS station began showing it on Saturday nights. I stumbled across it one night while flipping through the channels, and I was immediately hooked. By that time, the show was no longer in production, but the station showed the complete run multiple times over the course of three or four years, and I watched it over and over until they no longer had the rights to show it.

When I was in my early 20's, I tracked down a DVD set from England, but it was Region 2 and I could only watch it on my computer. I was thrilled to find the Acorn Media version a couple of years ago, but was only able to get Set 2. Now, my collection is complete!

The storytelling in this show is excellent. They do a very good job of creating their own world of Robin Hood, and incorporating ideas about mystical, fantasy England that were very popular at the time the show was being written. The show is, in many respects, a product of its time. The sets and costumes are actually rather accurate to the time period (we start in 1195), but the hair is unabashedly early 80's. The storylines that involve magic and supernatural elements tap into that cultural vein which also influenced movies like ""Willow,"" ""Legend,"" and ""The Dark Crystal.""

Its real weakness (but, really, only by comparison to TV shows today) is in the fight choreography. It's not up to the standards of modern fantasy genre shows, but we can't really expect it to be. Compared to the fight choreography of its early 1980's counterparts, it's very much on par.

The production value is quite good, which is easy when you have actual castles and forests you can film in, and when you have a good costume and prop department that does its historical research.

I give this series four stars for the storytelling, the production value, and the rewatchability it has for me. I fully realize that may be the result of my love for it as a child (and continuing love for it as an adult), but as long as you take that into consideration along with my review, I hope you will find the show as enjoyable as I do!",1389312000,5,2663,4.424489795918367

2699610,5,B000L21290,"When I ordered Robin of Sherwood sets 1 & 2 (Blu-ray) I was mainly expecting to relive a series that had a great impact on me when I was getting into adulthood. I had been able to watch poor digital versions of most episodes on the Internet, but I was longing for a better image and sound quality and the whole series.
Well, quality is very good indeed, keeping in mind the original series was aired in the mid eighties. The edition is clean, and it's made a pleasure to watch all these episodes again. English subtitles are pretty lame in some cases, and since my wife is not fully bilingual I've had to play the role of translator. Image and sound quality are good, as I said, as well as the additional materials which include very interesting interviews and funny outtakes.
Television and movies have sure come a long way since the days of Robin of Sherwood, and special effects could probably seem pathetically primitive to someone expecting the full power of digital magic seen on today's shows and movies; back then, this was good enough to make me expect each weekly episode.
I've probably watched every possible movie and TV show about Robin Hood, as well as read almost every book or fragment about this legend, and I must say there's none that can compare to this!",1352764800,3,1274,4.567685589519651

It is beautiful, funny, sad, romantic, exciting, and holds your interest without graphic blood and gore (1983/1984 TV at an early hour). I thought the sword fighting (they are not fencing) very well done. The pagan aspect was logical and it is after all episodic TV of a legend so the sorcery gave the writers more to work with.  The special effects are poor but there aren't many anyway.  The camerawork and lighting are wonderful.  There are no subtitles but there is Closed Caption. Hours of entertainment, the best money I ever spent.  Get both sets.",1342396800,3,857,4.795918367346939
2699612,5,B000L21290,"The Robin Hood legend has been around for centuries, ever growing, ever expanding the mythos.  When Errol Flynn brought it to the big screen there was a happy accident with Howard Hill, the stunt-archer splitting the arrow.  The director decided it had to go in.  Another addition to the legend.  With Robin of Sherwood it was not only the addition of the Saracen, Nasir, played by Mark Ryan (who was originally only hired for the one episode but who was so dashing he was invited to join the cast...a character which now pops up under other names from Costner's film to ""Men In Tights"") but the addition of he one thing which gives dimension to the story and brings it from the realm of legend into the realm of Mythology: mysticism.

Joseph Campbell spelled out the formula for The Hero's Journey decades ago and it has been used from ancient times to the Star Wars films.  It is something which touches us all on a very basic level, and when we see it we resonate to it.  The hero is of a mysterious parentage, often not knowing his true identity, or an orphan.  He goes forth reluctantly, at first, through a series of adventures with a set of Companions and learns his mission from a magical creature, be it a God or a Wizard.  The same story line runs theough Greek mythos and The Wizard of Oz.

Always before, Robin Hood was just someone out for justice, a robber who railed against the oppressors and helped the oppressed.  Now, in this version Richard ""Kip"" Carpenter has brought us the Mage, the Pagan God Herne the Hunter (both as the priest of Herne and, when the horned one posesses him, the God Himself) who tells Robin what he must do, reveals things to him through visions, including the fact that as King of Sherwood he is the Sacred King of the forest, who in the manner of all Sacred Kings must eventually shed his blood for the sake of the Land and its people.

With this connexion, something happens to the story, something larger than life, something which is predicated on more than a class struggle.  The Sacred King of Britain is not the man on the throne, an invader who is more interested in his own glory than even that of the Church, but someone who has ties with the land itself, someone who can feel and serve its needs.  It is not just the squabbles between a corrupt Abbot Hugo and his brother, the Sheriff of Nottingham and the serfs of the area, it is real Mythology, just as real as that other British mythos of Arthur.

The cast is perfection, the writing exquisite, and suddenly the whole thing is coherent and three dimensional.  This will always be, for me, the real Robin Hood.",1337904000,2,2618,4.48
2699613,5,B000L21290,"I bought both box sets of ROS when they first came out on DVD, and they looked pretty good.  A little grainy, and washed out perhaps, but that was understandable given the 16MM source, and the relatively low resolution of the format.  I was at first a bit skeptical of whether the Blu-Ray release would offer a worthwhile improvement - I'm thrilled to report it DOES!!!! These Blu's look amazing, the color now pops, the image is noticeably sharper, and while there's still some grain, it's film grain, not the noise from compression artifacts. The sound is a huge improvement too, you can hear every leaf rustle as Robin and the gang run through Sherwood Forest, and the Clannad Music - simply awesome!  IMHO, Robin of Sherwood, in both the Michael Praed as Loxley, and Jason Connery as Huntingdon incarnations, is the best version of the Legend ever told, and these Blu-rays present the show looking and sounding better than ever. If you're a fan who already has the DVDs, and are on the fence about upgrading, GO FOR IT, it's like discovering this fantastic series for the first time, all over again!",1331942400,8,1103,4.704663212435233
2699614,5,B000L21290,"I have purchased so many versions of Robin of Sherwood over the years, including an NTSC VHS version that was, frankly, terrible.

The DVD version was a vast improvement but there was a surprising amount of grain.

The BD edition is a revelation. The packaging looks great in an oversized box - there are smaller boxes for 3 BDs - but size matters when you are pricing such items.

The BD picture quality, considering the age and the 16mm image source, is quite remarkable. I have been watching the series on a 50"" plasma with the 4:3 image zoomed to fill the 16:9 screen. The picture is a bit soft, but very watchable even at such a large size. Some digital manipulation was probably used but is it not obvious. Edges are clean if a bit soft. Colors are vibrant. Sherwood never looked so green. The Robin of Sherwood logo is a zingy yellow and red. Skin tones are realistic. Flames are bright yellow-orange as thatched roofs are torched.

I will not comment on the content because there are a lot of descriptions of the content elsewhere. In summary: Gorgeous Maid Marian in Judi Trott, feral Robin in Michael Praed, feisty Will Scarlet in Ray Winstone, etc.

The set is certainly worth the price of admission. Now we need the Jason Connery episodes on BD. Then my life will be complete.

Herne, Cernunnos, is my own deity and to find Him treated in such a reverent and believable manner was wonderful.

Michael Praed is a talented actor, and therefore, if you are a Praed fan, this series will probably not disappoint. Additionally, if you are a Robin Hood fan, this series will likely be satisfactory. It is better than some Robin Hood series, although I personally prefer the B&W Richard Greene Robin Hood series from the 1950s.

This said in defense of the positive reviews, I feel it necessary to point out that this series contains a few flaws.

The first major flaw is a LACK OF CONTINUITY between episodes. For example, in one episode, I was almost certain Sir Guy was mortally wounded by Lady Marian's arrow. However, in the next episode, Sir Guy is back in perfect health without any reference to his being previously shot by a arrow and/or his catching on fire. Additionally, the Sheriff of Nottingham is constantly leaving Nottingham to (mentally-challenged) Sir Guy without any explanation. Therefore, at the beginning of each new episode, you, as the viewer, have no idea where the sheriff might be in this episode until some character within the episode tells you. Therefore, the viewer must receive the conclusion that each episode functions independently from other episodes. Perhaps, you, as a potential buyer, expect this. However, if you do not, it is seriously something to consider. The lack of continuity between the 50-minute episodes certainly disconcerted me.

The second major flaw is the SUPERNATURAL. While I had previous to purchasing the series read other reviews criticizing the supernatural (good vs. evil) in the series, I attributed their negative reviews to (1) a hatred of religion or (2) a fear of the occult and Satanism. However, this series is not about mortals attempting to communicate with spirits, the dead, or Lucifer, but rather, people actually being able to communicate. While I understand this is television, I believe it conveys the wrong message, especially to children who we are trying to raise in a modern age. For example, in one episode, Herne prevents the evil Luciferian Baron from killing Robin Hood with a sacred arrow by catching the arrow. In another episode, the powers of evil have obtained all of a number of sacred swords and are nearly able to call Lucifer to life from the underworld. Of course, Robin Hood prevents them from succeeding just before the shadow of Lucifer fully materializes into human form. Therefore, the series is not claiming that a superstitious people believed in spirits, but rather that these spirits actually exist and fight alongside both Robin Hood (the forces of good) and the Sheriff of Nottingham (the forces of evil).

Now, I understand that Robin Hood is a legend. Therefore, I can understand scriptwriters and directors' desires to put a different twist on the legend of Robin Hood. However, I, personally, was disappointed with the results of this series. However, for individuals who can tolerate (1) stand alone episodes and (2) fantasy/the supernatural, the series might be a 'good go' if you can purchase it used for under 30 dollars.

PS [for potential buyers]:
Because of the number of people who have purchased the series without knowing about the above 'issues', it is likely that you could purchase the series used for a very low price compared with Amazon, while still nearly guaranteeing that the disks will be in good condition. I purchased the series used ('very good') from an independent seller (for about 20 dollars). The independent seller as a (95+ rating). It appeared as though the series may have been watched once, if that, likely because the previous owner was disappointed with the spiritualism within the production.",1282089600,8,3736,5.019354838709678
2699619,5,B000L21290,"I've alway's loved watching ROBIN HOOD movies, right from the time of dashing Errol Flynn playing in the 1st Robin Hood I ever saw. Richard Carpenter's ""Robin of Sherwood"", was an awesome mini-series starring the dashing dark haired Michael Praed as ROBIN HOOD. I saw this aired in early 1980's on public broadcasting t.v. The series was  stunning, no fancy clothing as seen in other Robin Hood movies, here the clothing was more rags & leather and probably more realistic to the medieval times being portrayed. Also there was magik in this series (literally), not over use of it . . . but a subtle sorcery and mysticism flowed. Awesome location shots, of English countryside & castles, swordplay & haunting musical melodies. So fascinated I taped the series on VHS, but the quality was poor & grainy, however I figured it least it was better than nothing. I was THRILLED when the series was finally released on DVD, beautiful clear, crisp pictures . . .
  Series 1-14- We are introduced to young Robin of Loxley, his father is murdered. Fifteen years later he is out hunting in the king's forest, captured and thrown in the dungeon of Nottingham Castle where he meets the outlaws who will become his loyal followers. It is here he is intoduced to Herne the Hunter and accepts the mantle of the HOODED MAN the champion of the poor and oppressed. He meets the sheriff's ward the fiesty red headed maiden Marion and her loyal friend, the monk Friar Tuck. Robin frees Marion from evil sorcerer and does battle with Nassir a skilled warrior who fights with 2 swords. Marion and Friar Tuck join Robin's band. An unexpected Nassir also pledges his loyalty to Robin's cause. Robin & Marion fall in love and pledge themselves in a wedding where Herne joins the couple. The season finale, the sheriff finally captures Will, Little John & Nassir & corners Robin, Marion & Munch. It is Robin's last stand, where he fulfills his destiny . . .",1278806400,2,1930,4.704142011834319

2699621,5,B000L21290,"This is one of the greatest things to come out of early 80s television. Don't bother with the other seasons: they're atrocious. This one, on the other hand is super great.

Robin of Sherwood is probably the origin of modern sword and sandal epics using girlie swirlie renfaire music. They used Clannad, who, in its day, gave it an appropriately creepy air. Now a days, of course, it is hopelessly out of date; and sounds like Kool and the Gang playing at Renfaire. I suspect the silly music in movies like Gladiator and 300 will also seem dated and cheesy 24 years hence, wheras something like the soundtrack to El Cid or Alexander Nevsky is eternal. Really, they should have got Jethro Tull or Hawkwind to do the soundtrack to Robin of Sherwood: all the actors look and act like fans at a Hawkwind show anyway. One of the fun things about watching this show is the pre-AIDS swingerness of it all. The merry men of the woods are always going into the village and snogging with the numerous single women who seem to serve no purpose in the village other than bringing drinks to men who fondle them. Robin himself looks like the lead singer of Journey (though in the entering credits, he looks like a renaissance painting, which is a very neat effect).

This show also was probably of incalculable influence to the type of people who go to renfaire and consider themselves witches. I actually approve of the influence; there is real pagan stuff in it. The ""Herne the Hunter"" -a real mythological figure, is a very creepy and evocative Cerrunos (celtic horned god). There are references made to all kinds of historical pagan stuff; Weyland the smith, and so on. There is plenty of amusing anti-papistry and race hatred. The church is seen as greedy and corrupt. Anglo Saxon peasants as inherently noble people struggling against evil Frenchmen. They even manage to toss in a couple of blatantly anti semitic tropes in it, which, considering that this was made a mere 24 years ago in England, is kind of insane (you can probably go to jail for putting this on TV now a days). Come to think of it: Robin goes around popping a medieval cap in everyone, like some kind of English John Wayne: that sort of playing at weapons violence can't be legal in Britain any more either.

The acting verges on the hilarious. Robin is a milktoast and a ninny. Maid Marian is trying to be a feminist, but ends up a shrew. The Sheriff is so over the top, I can't help but think of Black Adder every time he opens his mouth, with Gisburn as his hammy-evil Baldrick. The ninja Arab, Nasir, looks Italian and acts Japanese. Will Scarlett (who looks just like my pal  Simon) is a medieval version of a chav. The two fat guys are by far the best characters, when there is not an interesting new villain around. Little John (it always confused me that he was supposed to be huyoooge, but really, he's just a bit above average in size) is a big good natured oaf. Friar Tuck is a jolly fat sissy.

All this sounds like I'm down on it, but in fact, this is one of the best things one can watch on the television machine. It is good natured, amusing, and has some beautiful imagery. Beyond the historical references, it never gets beyond the intellectual level of, say, Gilligan's Island, but it is still worth watching. In fact, I'd say that makes it more worth watching. Television shows which attempt to be intellectual are a crashing bore. Television shows which attempt to be fun and charming are much more rare.

2699622,5,B000L21290,"I watched this as a kid with my mom. We were poor and our friend had HBO and taped the series for us. Years later it is one series I still remember because of the magic, mystery and romance portrayed. It stirred my imagination and captured my heart. I travelled to England and made sure to buy all the episodes over there, but then I have an English DVD player. The fact that this set is now on Region 1 is a real treat. If you like the Robin Hood fable, you will LOVE this series. It is set in England with none of the fake accents you hear nowadays in movies and on American TV.

2699623,5,B000L21290,"I did not see this Robin Hood series in the 80s. A friend on MySpace recommended it, so I bought the complete set and have watched the First set (with Michael Praed) and several discs into the second set with Jason Connery. I have to say that I find it thoroughly enjoyable, well done, and full of beautiful scenery. But what really makes the series is the wonderful characterization and how well each actor stays in that character. Also, the comradery and friendship of the band, not so unlike siblings. Always at odds with each other but the first to defend the other in times of trouble. This is what pulls you in and makes you care. Though both Robins play their part well, I am partial to Michael Praed. Michael has an almost fey-like quality to him (perfect for in Sherwood), is facially expressive, and very fluid in how he moves. And though Jason plays the part wonderfully as well, I was sad to see the switch. Speaking of which...the switch is my one downturn of this series. I understand what they were trying to do, but I really think that Robin making a final stand (sacrifice really), when he could have easily escaped with Marian and Much, was out of character for him. Robin was a survivor and the hope of the people. I don't think he would have laid down his life for nothing. Had he died defending Marian and Much while they escaped, I might have accepted it. But to have them escape so easily while Robin just stands there and accepts a fate that didn't have to be, was unrealistic...and unlike Robin. Still, I love the series and am still giving it a 5 star review for wonderfully drawn out characters and for its empathetic pull to the viewers heart. Funny strange...I'm writing a novel (medieval faerie fantasy)...and a very significant line in it is ""you will not be forgotten"".

2699624,5,B000L21290,This is the first dvd set to the Robin of Sherwood series that was on PBS here in the states or BBC in England. I watched this series as a kid in England and was happy to see it finally come out here in the states. This was the and still is the cheapest place to purchase this set.,1209081600,,281,3.7796610169491527
2699625,5,B000L21290,"I'd only seen a few episodes on this epic series on PBS (and missed it completely on Showtime), but it was love at first sight.  Along with Arthurian legends, the story of Robin Hood has always fascinated me and films seldom did it justice (Errol Flynn and the brilliant Robin and Mirian notwithstanding). I was thrilled to see it finally released in DVD format and in spite of having been produced in the 1980's, manages not to look dated.  The music by Irish band Clannad is perfect, transporting the viewer to another time and place.

This isn't Kevin Costner's Robin Hood, though he must have taken quite a few cues from it for his own film.  This version has the look and the feel to John Boorman's never-to-be-duplicated classic, 'Excalibur', even casting a member of that film--Robert Addie (who played Mordred in 'Excalibur' and is Sir Guy of Gisburne here). The England of this time is still quite picturesque, full of verdant forests, imposing castles and thatched cottages, but the castles are drafty, rush-strewn edifices, home to not only people but animals (what a smell that must have been), throngs of unwashed peasants, and the cruel yoke of the Norman overlords who view the Saxon people little more than animals.  This is a grittier world, and things do not always end happily.  The fight for freedom is stained with blood.  However, Robin of Sherwood is an epic tale of the triumph of good over evil, of hope over dispair.  There is magic, myth and the hero's eternal quest--I think the late Joseph Campbell would approve.

Michael Praed is a fabulous Robin Hood.  In the first episodes, he is young and idealistic with a certain rakehell charm (and let's be honest, he looked great in those trousers!).  As the series progresses and good people die around all him, his demeanor slowly changes, and he comes to see that for every battle won, the war continues.  He is most hurt when the villages he has come to the aid of in the past turn him away in his time of need.

Ray Winstone as the angry but loyal Will Scarlet is brilliant.  One never knows what will set him off, and his on again--off again relationship with the leader of their small band makes for great dramatic tension. Little John (played by Clive Mantle) transcends the stereotyped image of the dumb giant and proves to be a caring yet gentle bear of a man. I also adored the character of Lady Miriam, played by Judi Trott.  This Marion knows her own mind and learns to shoot a bow and fight alongside the rest of the merry men.  It's brilliant that she dons trews for running through the forest rather than a kirtle and chemise (though she wears those too).  She reminded me of Jennifer Roberson's retelling of the Robin Hood legend from Miriam's point of view. No simpering miss waiting for the hero to rescue her from the clutches of the wicked sherriff.  Friar Tuck (played by Phil Rose) becomes more than just the standard comic relief, serving as warrior, spiritual advisor and friend.  The viewer always knows he's a Christian, but he's one whose deeds are far greater than his words. Mark Ryan is awesome as the mighty Saracen Nasir, the skilled swordsman.  He doesn't speak much, but his body language is elegant and refined. What's interesting about including a Saracen character in the Robin Hood mythos is that now it's rather de rigueur to do so. Think of Morgan Freeman's character from Prince of Thieves.

Herne the Hunter (John Abiniri) was far more effective as shamanistic being rather than another Yoda-type figure.  Cypher and companion to Robin, his character is part of a grand literary tradition, and the part reflects that.

On the villians' side, both the Sherriff of Nottingham (played with fiendish glee by Nickolas Grace) and Sir Guy (Robert Addie) are frightfully nasty without being cartoonish.  They might be Norman overlords, yet both realize they answer to others higher in status, and are completely cruel because they can do nothing to change their situation.  In one memorable episode, the Sherriff condemns innocent jews to death without qualm simply to avoid paying a debt.  Of course, both always get their comeuppance in the end, but it only spurs them to further acts of vengeance against the ""wolfshead"" and the populace at large.  Anthony Valentine as the evil Baron DeBelleme is thoroughly wicked, and yet compelling too.  He was an awesome nemesis.

On the supposed ""anti-Christian"" bias: I'm a little surprised by the naivete shown by those who just can't help seeing Middle Age catholism through rose-coloured glasses.  The Middle Ages were a time of both religious faith (as personnified by Crusade mania) and pagan sensibilities, especially in small villages where many of the old festivals continued under new names (and still do to this day).  To paraphrase a line from Abbot Hugo (played by Phillip Jackson) when confronted by Sir Guy concerning The Blessing, a time when no blood can be shed, the Abbot replies archly, ""as long at they attend mass and have their children baptized, I don't care what foolishness the people get into.""  Thusly, Friar Tuck's tolerance of pagan beliefs would not have been too far from the mark.  There are stories about the founding of Glastonbury Abbey, where it is believed Joseph of Arimathea worshipped alongside the druids.

I'm wondering if perhaps the hypersensitive critics missed the beginning of Martin Luther's Protestant Reformation and the posting of the 95 Theses, which included Theses 86: ""Why does the pope, whose wealth today is greater than the wealth of the richest Crassus, build the basilica of St. Peter with the money of poor believers rather than with his own money?""  The church was very powerful back then, and very rich, and as history has shown, rife with excess.  Blaming a show for depicting historical facts because they don't suit a myopic view is rather sad.  then again, like most religions, any sort of criticism--even unintentional--is often met with complaints.

Robin of Sherwood is a wonderful series the entire family can enjoy.  The violence is appropriate for the times, and there's no excess skin.  There's friendship, sacrifice, laughter, honor, love and loyalty--things we don't see enough of on network television these days.  I am so happy I added this to my collection.",1205107200,3,6288,4.87218045112782

2699631,5,B000L21290,"Gold Crest created a real winner in its imaginative 1984 ""Robin of Sherwood"" TV series adaptation of the Robin Hood legend.

The series originally ran for 4 seasons on British TV ... seasons one and two comprise ""Part 1"" (5 disks) of Acorn Media's DVD collection, and star Michael Praed as Robin of Loxley.  Seasons three and four comprise ""Part 2"" (5 disks) of Acorn's DVD collection, and starred Jason Connery as Robert of Huntington.  After wrapping at the end of season 4, the series went into syndication, and was re-aired here in the States in the late 1980's on Showtime ... I was one of the fortunate few who not only knew about the series back then, but also owned a VCR, so I was able to tape it - although the image quality of the masters used by Showtime was depressingly mediocre.

The series went on to develop a small but very loyal cult following.  The soulful Celtic-themed music by Clannad (back when they were relatively unknown), the presence of old magic and myths comes to life (Herne the Hunter, Crom Cruac, witchcraft, etc.), and excellent performances by Ray Winstone (Will Scarlet -arguably the best actor on the series), Nickolas Grace (Sheriff of Nottingham), and Michael Praed (Robin of Loxley) all combined to make for a very enjoyable and nostalgic series.  It just worked.

Now, here we are 20 years later, and at long last, this little known cult series has been re-released on high-quality DVDs (hooray !), so that it can be seen and enjoyed anew - not just by it's original fans, but by a new generation of viewers as well.

Take six homeless souls from the streets of any city and you would get some idea as to how Robin and his band would have looked and smelled. Clean clothes, clean hair and teeth, clean shaven and well fed would not be the order of the day. However, from a mythological perspective, I found the series very entertaining.

It was my source and inspiration of many playground games with neighborhod kids as well as my individual adventures, imitating the best arrow shooter and ""mercenary for justice"", Robin Hood. First season, with Michael Pread, is one of the best TV series ever. Since I was a kid I've always refered to it as the ""most accurate"" version of the great legend of Robin Hood. I always thought him to be THE hero, and during later years, whenever a major obstacle or when I felt like everybody is agaist me, I often consoled myself by imagining me as this lonely soldier who lives in this vast, beautiful forest, which feeds him and protects him.
Now, right before I purchased this DVD set I couldn't remember a single story, a single episode. I've asked myself over the years, iritated, why they never showed it on TV again. I don't know what it was about exactly, but I knew it was the greatest show, which I've always missed. Why is that? Why such tv shows or movies can stir our emotions so much and linger with us for so long? Then it dawned on me when I watched the recently released DVD of Miami Vice. It's the music. You could probably write a seperate review discussing the similarities between Robin of Sherwood and Miami Vice. In this case, it's the Clannad that contributed to making this series so unforgettable.
Now that I'm older, I can see some imperfection and simplicities throughout the episodes, but those are just surface observations. I thought my favorite episode was ""King's Fool"", until I saw the last one, ""The Greatest Enemy"". It blew me away. All those childhood memories came back flooding.
One reviewer stated it was so anti-christian. I could say quite the opposide. What is Christian if not the ""teacher"" and his ""desciples"". The fact that we'll all die, yet we will meet again. That the ""Mesiah"" died, yet rose from the dead.

2699637,5,B000L21290,"Back in the early '90s my local PBS station would show a British import called ""Robin of Sherwood"". I was so knocked out by this version of the Robin Hood legend, that I eventually by hook & crook, taped all the episodes (and movies) on an ancient mono VCR. I still have those dusty tapes, but they eventually deteriorated by both age and constant viewings. Now, finally after years of waiting the show is now available to American fans (in a compatible region format) on DVD!

What makes the 1984 series ""Robin of Sherwood"" so good? This is a wonderful, well made, well written, re-imagining of an old story. Series creator/writer Richard Carpenter has crafted a version, that mixes gritty realism with fantasy story elements and plotlines. Yes, Robin Hood (Michael Phraed) and his co-horts Little John (Clive Mantle), Will Scarlet (Ray Winstone), Friar Tuck (Phil Rose), Munch (Peter Llewellyn Williams) and Lady Marion (Judi Trott) are once again fighting for the good of the common poor by matching swords (and wits!) with the nefarious, Sheriff of Nottingham (Nikolas Grace) and his rather thick headed, flunky, Sir Guy of Gisburne (Robert Addie). But what makes the story interesting is that Robin fights not only out of his common decency, but because it has been prophesied by a mystic, who channels a Pagan forrest deity known as 'Hearn the Hunter'. Robin is ""the hooded man"", that prophesy says will lead in the battles between ""light and dark"", good and evil. The dark forces come in various forms of sorcerers, witches, devil worshipers and demons.

The storylines are well written and the main characters are actually three dimensional, giving us real emotions and motives. Robin's band of outlaws are like a big family, that have both light hearted moments and moments of dissension. Robin's love story with Marion is palpable and you feel the deep emotions, these two characters have for each other. Likewise, the Sheriff, despite sometimes being intemperant, has the cunning, logical mentality of a chess player. The fact that he is always foiled in the end, just seems to make him try harder.

The look and feel of the show is also a plus. The costumes, locations and interiors give us a realistic tone that offsets the show's fantasy elements. This dosn't have the look or feel of a Hollywood set. It feels like damp, dank England from ages ago. You can feel the dirt and muck, which seems to cover everything. This is also aided by the show's wonderful cinematography, which shows off the saturated greens and browns of Sherwood Forest and the cold darkness of the many castle interiors. Finally I want to mention the show's wonderful music score  written and performed by the Irish, New Age group, Clannad. The various musical themes played throughout the series greatly enhances both the action sequences and the more sedate, emotional moments of the show.

2699639,5,B000L21290,"While lacking the production values of many of today's television shows, what this series lacks in special effects it makes up for in writing, story line, acting (often campy), and most importantly it takes the Robin Hood myth in some interesting and creative directions. This isn't Disney's Robin Hood. Instead, Robin is cast as a truly legendary figure, drawing heavily from English/Celtic mythology -- one episode even tackles the Arthur myth -- and medieval themes. This is a Robin whose world is steeped in magic and danger. Sherwood Forest is a space that mimics Shakespeare's forests: it is outside of society and its power structures. Also interesting are the social issues that this Robin faces. Unlike most versions of Robin Hood, this Robin isn't simply concerned with poor versus rich, but also Norman versus Saxon, Christian versus Pagan, and, of course, right versus wrong. One episode plays with the medieval tension between Christianity and Judaism with some interesting results. Possibly one of the most compelling characters, aside from Robin, is Friar Tuck who is wholly Christian, but also intimately involved in the pagan world of Herne the Hunter (a forest deity who guides Robin throughout the series). Watching the good Friar negotiate both worlds is curious, and well handled. Rather than the large band of thieves featured in many versions of the Robin Hood myth, this series focuses on the small band of men surrounding Robin (played by Michael Praed in the first few seasons and then Jason Connary), and of course, his true love, Marion (played by the lovely Judi Trott). This series also features fantastic music by Clannad. I would highly recommend this series to anyone interested in the Robin Hood myth. It has been a joy to finally have a copy of this wonderful series on DVD. My review refers to the limited edition complete series, not the individual seasons on DVD.",1185408000,3,1901,5.038095238095238

2699642,2,B000L21290,"This series used to be my favorite of all time. I already loved Robin Hood stories and the ""real"" feel to this series, along with the added English mythology, made this one stand out above all others. Watching it again, however, after all these years, I am somewhat appalled by the portrayal of every member of the Church being evil. The only exception is Tuck, who not once speaks of his Christian belief and instead embraces the pagan practices of his friend's whole heartedly. I, personally, am more than a little tired of this portrayal of Christianity. (It's been shoved down our throats recently in such ""historical"" movies as ""King Arthur"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"" as well.)

Had this portion of the series handled the portrayal of Christianity more realistically as the Jason Connery portion did (ie, some members of the Church might be bad, such as the Abbot, but most are not and were willing to help Robin and his men, plus Tuck started acting more like a Christian himself), than I'd have given this a 4 star rating (one lower than the 5 star I give the second half of the series).",1180396800,6,1092,4.628865979381444

2699644,5,B000L21290,"It's always a delight to return to something you enjoyed many years ago and find out that your memories were not distorted. Michael Praed and Judi Trott are the ultimate Robin and Marion, heartbreakingly youthful and joyous yet with a wonderful gravitas, beautiful (as Robin says of Marion, ""as a May morning"") without artificiality, equals without the anachronism of political correctness. Their first and final moments together are equally perfect, the latter utterly wrenching, and it earns its tears honestly - each line and gesture has been set up by what has gone on before. The other characters are also rich in nuance, though it does strain credulity (especially by the 13th episode) that no one puts an arrow between the shoulder blades of Guy of Gisbourne or the Sheriff! I very much enjoyed the authentic historical references to Norman England, and only wish the consistency had carried over into the depiction of that era's spirituality. Corrupt churchmen there may have been (unfortunately, we see no other kind here, unless we count Tuck - hardly a practicing religious!), but the 12th century was NOT an era of paganism slowly being overwhelmed by the ""new"" Christianity. Saxon England, as well as Norman, had been Christian for many centuries.  I can accept Herne as a device... though I think Robin could just as well have listened to his own inner voice, as this was also an era of mystics. I'm less happy (despite the entertainment value) with sorcerers returning from the dead and devil-worshipping nuns who can literally incarnate Lucifer. (In this England, the devil, apparently, is real, but not Christ.) However, my five-star rating stands, for the wonderful cast, the creative storytelling, the historical integrity (physically if not spiritually), the tenderness of the romance, and the lovely incidental music by Clannad.",1179792000,10,1849,5.163333333333333

There is as much pleasure to be taken from watching Kevin Costner stealing from the poor ( blissfully unaware that while he does so, Alan Rickman is stealing the movie from him) as there is to be found in the new PSP Crew that currently inhabits Sherwood on the BBC. However ROBIN OF SHERWOOD is for those who like to engage their cerebral organ  as well as the visceral ones while watching a program. This version is well cast, providing the required eye candy for both sexes, sumptuous in setting, and provides the basis in woodland myth that allowed the Robin Hood character to be developed and to become a part of storyland history ( interestingly enough, the new ROBIN HOOD on BBC also takes a chance on this, hoping to hook younger viewers with the cast and then seduce them into thinking about a man's motivation to do good by exploring Robin's thoughts and feelings about serving with Richard in the Crusade to""retake"" the Holy Land).

Each character is memorable, you love who you should love, and hate who you should hate. The plots are interesting, interwoven well, and story development is awesome.  I can hardly wait till the 2nd set comes out, where Jason Connery (Shaun Connery's son) takes over as Robin Hood.  It was almost as good as Michael Praed's Robin, and a fitting series continuation.

I have loved the Robin Hood legend since I first saw the Disney version and the Errol Flynn version but this is the first series that I felt was authentic to the times. The costumes are realistic.

I'm looking forward to the release of the Jason Connery episodes as well.,1178409600,2,515,4.48936170212766
2699653,5,B000L21290,"As other reviewers have said, Richard Carpenter's Robin of Sherwood is THE definitive TV retelling of the Robin Hood ballads. This series had it all. The characterizations were spot-on, and you actually care about them. The villainous Lord High Sheirff of Nottingham, Robert De Rainault, his brother Abbot Hugo De Rainault, and their steward, Sir Guy of Gisbourne aren't one-dimensional stock villains; Carpenter made them three-dimensional people who're evil for a reason. The locations are stunning, the costumes authentic (except for the obviously fake chain-mail and the aluminum shields of De Rainault's men-at-arms), and the theme and incidental music by Irish Celtic folk-rock band Clannad is ethereal and mysterious, beautifully haunting, joyous and playful-everything the show needed. I highly recommend the sound track, I only wish they'd realese all of the tracks used in the show (there are four or five from season three that aren't on the sound track).

The show presents the more popular and recognizable 12th century Robin Hood rather than the 14th and 15th century outlaw of the original medieval ballads.

One thing that really sold me on this show was the way series writers Carpenter and Anthony Horowitz wove actual medieval English history into the episodes, such as Richard's return to Nottingham after his ransom in which he pardoned his treasonous brother John; Richard's death in Normandy and John's accession to the throne; King John's divorce of his first wife Isabella (aka Hadwisa) of Gloucester to marry the young Isabella of Angouleme (Corey Pullman played her wonderfully), and John's alleged murder of his nephew Arthur of Brittany, who it was said was named heir to the English throne by the Lionheart on his deathbed (historians still debate whether John actually killed Arthur or not but it works for the episode, which doesn't really answer the question, either). The real John liked jewels and in the show John likes Jewels; he also has the Plantagenet short fuse. And though the real John wasn't nearly as villainous towards the peasantry, yet since in all the popular versions of the legend, John's the villain, Carpenter had to make John the villain. In one episode the Sheriff discusses an upcoming hundred court with Gisbourne. Add to this the fact that real medieval English geography is referred to (Barnesdale; the Newark Road; Lincoln; York; etc.) These connections to authentic history all added to the authenticity of this show.

Both Michael Praed and Jason Connery (son of Sean) played their respective Robins brilliantly, and the change of actors (Praed landed a role on Broadway) was handled very nicely and examined two prominent versions of the legends, one that Robin was a peasant yeoman and the other that he was an earl's son. Judi Trott was fabulous as Marian of Leaford, and brought a believability to the role-while a very beautiful and feminine woman, Trott's Marian is nevertheless married to an outlaw wolf's head and lives in Sherwood Forst with his band; thus her Marian can shoot nearly as good as Robin as well as handle a sword. The other ""merry men"" each have distinct personalities and character traits, from the quick-tempered Will Scarlet, to the simple, yet firecly loyal Much the Miller's Son, to the brooding and silent, yet deadly former member of the sect of the Asassins, Nazir.

Robin's band is kept small on purpose and for very practical reasons: two hundred men can't hide very well, even in Sherwood (which in the 12th/13th centuries was fairly large). Plus, more time can be devoted to exploring the main characters. All of the traditional main characters from the legends are present, save Allan a' Dale who only appears in one episode ( though it's a great one).  Significant is the addition of a Saracen (Muslim) character, Nazir, played by Mark Ryan. The Costner film producers got the idea for a Saracen in Robin's band from RoS. And a Saracen in Sherwood is actually not so far-fetched, as Richard the Lionheart actually hired several Muslim mercenaries to fight in his army.

Nicholas Grace was fantastic as the Sheriff, giving what is usually a stock villain real depth and personality. Robert Addie (Mordred in John Boorman's 1981 ""Excalibur"") played a great Guy of Gisbourne, also portraying what is usually a stock villain with depth and feeling. As the series progresses we learn why Gisbourne turned out the way he did and acts as he does. And there were interesting character revelations about Gisbourne in season three. Philip Davis played Prince/King John to the hilt-Davis' performance is the best portrayal of John I've ever seen. And while John Rhys-Davies doesn't physically look like Richard the Lionheart (who had red hair) he played him brilliantly, capturing the historic Plantagenet king's valor and bravery, but also his characteristic Plantagenet short temper and treachery when he was crossed.

Add a dash of mysticism from Robin's patron, Herne the Hunter to round things out and make them really interesting. This character is more present in the first two seasons than in the last. John Abineri does a good job of portraying the fey and mysterious Herne, who ""when the Horned one possesses me,"" becomes Herne the Hunter (Cerunnos), the Celtic Lord  of the Trees and the Hunt. This character isn't over-used, and though Friar Tuck (Phil Rose) is portrayed as more tolerant of Herne's pagan ways than a real life 12th century religious would probably be, it's still believable. Carpenter says Robin needed a patron or mentor and he couldn't use Merlin, so Herne fit the bill nicely. The show doesn't definitively say whether Herne actually IS Herne/Cerunnos or not, but his fey powers, such as his prophectic ability and second sight, are portrayed as real. Like Herne, the villainous sorcerer Gulnar is a bit much for authentic 12th/13th century England, what with his public devotion to Arianrhod and Thor, but not terribly so if one suspends one's disbelief. In that respect the show's magical, mystical element works nicely and is an interesting twist to the standard legends. Carpenter carefully researched the magical and mystical elements of the show to make them as accurate as possible.

Recurring characters such as Edward of Wickham (played by Jeremy Bulloch, Boba Fett in the original ""Star Wars"" films) Meg of Wickham (Claire Toeman), and Sir Richard of Leaford, as well as recurring villains such as the Sheriff's brother Abbot Hugo de Rainault (played very nicely by Philip Jackson), the Baron de Belleme (Anthony Valentine) and King John round out the cast.

This show deserved more than the three seasons it got in the UK. The series needed closure and a suitable ending which it never got. One wishes Carpenter's plans for a feature film concurrent with the Costner Robin Hood film had materialized.

In the early 1990s an American video company (I believe it was Good Times), released the five two-part episodes of the series as two-hour features on VHS, but apparently didn't releasse the rest of the series for some odd reason. Season three of the series begins immediately where the cliff-hanger of season two ended, so not including those other episodes makes no sense at all. Episodes were written and filmed in sequence and the series works best when viewed that way; for example, what happens in the first episode of season three directly impacts what happens in later episodes. Despite flashbacks at the beginning of the first episode of season three, viewers need to have seen what came before in the first two seasons. Finally American audiences have the chance as the complete series is now available to them.

2699654,5,B000L21290,"Richard Carpenter's imaginative retelling of the Robin Hood legend is never short of brilliant and after over 20 years remains a favorite among many people the world over. One or two episodes didn't quite live up to the overall level of storytelling, but they can be forgiven. This Robin Hood looks and feels decisively medieval. Clothes and faces are dirty, interiors are dark and dusty. The poor look like they need a champion. In the first series of ""Robin of Sherwood,"" Herne the Hunter chooses Robin of Loxley to be his Son, to do his bidding. Herne entrusts Robin with Albion, one of the seven swords of Wayland, and a legend is born. Loxley is played with intelligence and intensity by Michael Praed. Other stand-outs in the cast include Ray Winstone, whose fiery Will Scarlet sets an impossibly high standard for every Will to follow, and gentle giant Clive Mantle, whose Little John is a complex combination of fierceness, loyalty, and vulnerability. Judi Trott is the most beautiful woman ever to embody the role of Lady Marion. Nikolas Grace's Sheriff is a deliciously manipulative, scenery-chewing villain. Adding to the overall effectiveness of each episode is an excellent soundtrack by the Irish group Clannad. Treat yourself to this excellent DVD set.",1176940800,3,1267,5.038095238095238

2699662,5,B000L21290,"Like lots of other reviewers of this item, I've waited a long time for this classic 1980's British TV show to come to Region 1 DVD and now that it's finally available I'm ecstatic! For me, ""Robin of Sherwood"" is the definitive version of Robin Hood, so much so that I've never even cared to watch Kevin Costner's ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" movie, nor the recent big-budget adaptation by the BBC (okay, I have watched Disney's ""Robin Hood"" though). Furthermore, I would go so far as to say that it is one of the finest, most entertaining shows ever produced for television. The acting is first-rate, the writing is very often strong, the directors take full advantage of the locations (be it in a forest or a castle, with some beautiful scenery shot on film mostly in the north and west of England), the lighting is perfect, and the characters are believable, three-dimensional people with whom the viewer can sympathize. On top of all this, and despite Amazon.com's own review, the title music and incidental music provided by Irish Celtic band, Clannad is wonderful and perfectly enhances the atmospheric mood of many a varied scene. I couldn't imagine any other music to accompany the show.

Another aspect of this show that makes it so great is the fact that it marries the legend of Robin Hood with some mythical themes, such as Robin's relationship with the `ghost' of Herne the Hunter, said to have once been a huntsman employed by King Richard II. Robin turns to Herne for advice and guidance from time to time making Herne something of a father figure for the young outlaw. Medieval superstitious beliefs also add to the mythology and occasionally play a part in some of the storylines, particularly witchcraft.

The drama here is given a very real, gritty feeling to hold true to the time it is set in. The women are short and have warts, the Sheriff of Nottingham's men bare the scars of battle, villagers are poor, wear tattered clothes and drink ale, and fights take place in wet, muddy fields. You won't find any bright green tights, powdered cheek bones or nicely-kept hair here.

I must single out two exceptional actors in this show. Ray Winstone's `mad dog' portrayal of Will Scarlet is always a highlight. Sometimes he acts before he thinks, usually when faced with the prospect of engaging the Sheriff of Nottingham's men in battle. This undoubtedly stems from a constant inner rage he feels from the rape and murder of his wife at the hands of the Sheriff's men. Then, there is the Sheriff himself. Brilliantly played by Nickolas Grace, the Sheriff of Nottingham is, to borrow an English phrase from JK Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" books, a ""right foul git"". Ruthless, greedy and callous, Grace turns the Sheriff into an unscrupulous villain, and when required to show the Sheriff in his true, cowardly colors, does so expertly.

You will not be disappointed with this show and I only hope it is not long before the remaining 13 episodes see the light of day on DVD too.",1174608000,12,2991,4.746153846153846

I was sorry to see Michael Praed leave for the pathetic confines of ""Dynasty"" but they handled the transition to Jason Connery very well and, in spite of a rocky start, he grew into the role in time with the help of the wonderful Judi Trott as Marian.

Had the pleasure of meeting several of the cast member at various Conventions -- Praed was a wonderful person, absolute gentlemen and guest with no airs whatsoever.  I was at his very first Con, Scorpio in 1988.  Several of us stayed up with him to wee hours calming his Con jitters. He was so nervous that he'd ""fail""!

The guy playing Will Scarlett really was Will Scarlett! A rascal and a ruffian.

The series itself was like a dream.  I even enjoyed Connery's series. Especially appreciated were the mystical links to the Horned God, druidism, etc.  This gave it an emotional power and a cinematic beauty that was riviting.",1174003200,2,742,4.568181818181818
2699666,5,B000L21290,"I remember this series when it was originally on TV. Now it's all here on DVD and I got one. Yes!

Lost memories return and become vivd as this series takes me back once again to those wonderful childhood days spent in our own Sherwood Forest when we were the ""good guys"" and ""the bad guys!"" What fun to watch this series and be transported, for a short while, back to Sherwood and, once again, become part of ""the gang.""

Get it. You won't regret it. I'm going to send a set to my nephews. Maybe they'll forget their game cards and electronic gadgets and get back to some real fun found only in their imagination.",1173916800,4,614,4.2844827586206895
2699667,5,B000L21290,"For those not able to get the ""Robin of Sherwood Complete Series"" Region 1 box set put out a few years ago, this release is a long time coming.  It appears that all the special features in the box set are reproduced here, so there is nothing new that early adopters are missing.  For those who are not yet aware, this is perhaps the best Robin Hood television show ever produced, and it has tremendous staying power.  Both Robin the commoner and Robin the nobleman are woven into this series, which makes it unique.

True, Michael Praed (later replaced by blonde pansy Jason Connery) and his crew are pretty darn clean for living out in the woods, but it just wouldn't be as much fun to watch a bunch of scruffy, dirty ruffians.  Also worthy of note are the guest appearances by Richard ""Riff Raff"" O'Brien.  So throw your verisimilitude out the window and sit down to some quality yarn spinning!",1173744000,9,896,4.53416149068323

2699669,5,B000L21290,"I used to have some of the VHS tapes of this show, and I taped a few off of TV.  But, when the VCR went out, I never got a new one, and can't watch the tapes.  Horrible picture anyway, but........  I'm so happy to finally be able to buy the series on DVD.  I love the Robin Hood legend and find this a more ""true to life"" version.  It's gritty, sometimes dark and people actually get dirty, living in the forest and all ya know!!  Michael Praed is a vastly underrated actor, heading up a stellar ensemble.  I wasn't as thrilled with Jason Connery's Robin, but that may just be my bias toward Mr. Praed and my disappointment at seeing him leave the show.  If you love the story of Robin Hood, you must buy this DVD!!!",1168905600,13,716,4.13768115942029
2699670,5,B000L21290,"I am so very glad to see this series will soon be available!  It's a fun mix of legend and history, drama and camp.  The main characters are strong and complex.  The actors' off-camera comraderie is evident on screen - you just know they're having a good time brawling.  The portrayals of the Sheriff of Nottingham and his flunky, Sir Guy of Gisborne, are terrific: simultaneously villanous and comic.  The mystical/supernatural aspects are at times over the top; but at other times they work just fine.  I found watching this series to be very satisfying.",1167868800,12,556,4.8

The finale of the Robin of Loxley era is, quite simply, the best hour of television produced in the 1980s. Stirring, romantic, inspiring, heroically tragic and brilliant.  Like a dream out of the mist that returns to remind us all... nothing is forgotten.  Nothing is EVER forgotten.",1490054400,,387,4.676470588235294

Seems a bit dated, now, of course: but it's a British production, and that's *always* better than what the Americans come up with. Best thing? The female actors don't have too much eye makeup on -- that always ruins my ability to suspend disbelief and get into the way back atmosphere.",1471305600,,347,4.523809523809524

8159953,5,B000L21290,"This concerns mostly the blu-ray version which I just purchased.  I already own several DVD versions and Robin Of Sherwood is by far my favorite version of the Robin Hood legend.  I am mad for Robin Hood and have seen just about every version, and loved them all for the most part, with the exception of the ghastly Kevin Costner version.  Now on to the Blu ray version of Robin of Sherwood.  I was quite happy with the quality.  At first I was a bit disappointed in the Blu Ray version.  The colors are far more popping and there is less grain.  But once I turned on ""movie"" mode on my telly, 90 percent of the film grain disappeared and the difference between the DVD and Blu Ray was quite decided.  We have to remember that despite all the care that went into this series back in 1983, the producers decided unfortunately to go with 16mm film, which shows.  But the Blu Ray version has pretty much fixed all that.  The colors are far more popping.  The costumes are far more detailed and richly colored than I ever noticed, fAbbot Hugo and the Sheriff can now be seen to be dressed in rich velours and silks and velvets.  Maid Marian when leaving for Kirkless, her fur hood is now richly red and her clothes are lovely.  All this pretty much looked like cheap costumes in the DVD version, but one can see the care and costly fabrics used in the Blu Ray.  There is still a soft focus, and I would love to see a good remastering, but the Blu Ray is definitely worth it, and I'm glad I bought it.  Long Live Robin of Sherwood.  Nothing is ever forgotten.",1460332800,,1554,4.3068965517241375

8159956,5,B000L21290,"I watched this show years ago when it was first on TV.  I had VHS copies of it, but have now (gladly) replaced them with DVDs.  It holds up pretty well from when it was made, though some of the look of it has aged a bit.  The music by Clannad is still marvelous, the acting is wonderful, and the plots are intriguing as we follow the adventures of a much more mystical version of Robin Hood.  He is a worshipper of Herne, the God of the Forest, as he fights for justice for the downtrodden peasants of England against the injustice of the (wonderfully played) wicked Sheriff of Nottingham and his sidekick, Sir Guy.

Michael Praed makes for a very pretty Robin of the Hood and I think he left the show much too soon.  Still, this version of Robin Hood is one of the best ever made as a TV show and I can highly recommend it, especially if you are looking for a version with pagan overtones.",1437350400,,890,4.205882352941177
8159957,5,B000L21290,"I used to watch this series as a kid, and always wondered as I reached adulthood if I will ever get to watch it again. When I saw the dvd on Amazon, I was so excited and of course I had to purchase it. This series portrays Robin Hood in a way that has been avoided in other shows, he is more human, and you see the true hero nature of Robin Hood. It was also interesting to see how mysticism and magic played a role in his story.",1433203200,,429,3.831460674157303
