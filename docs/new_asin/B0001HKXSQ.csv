8012691,4,B0001HKXSQ,"I remember watching ""The Wonderful World of Color"" every Sunday evening waiting to see what the Disney production of the evening would be.  Of course, being rather young way back then, I always looked forward to a cartoon presentation.  However, I came to appreciate the all around qualty of whatever we would be treated to that evening.  I also came to understand that the Disney production staff knew how to make good nature programs.  I remembered ""The Living Desert"" and ""The Vanishing Prairie"" as two of their better nature films.  Not surprizingly, both won Oscars for Best Documentary.

I still enjoyed ""The Vanishing Prairie"" seeing it again after 40-some years.  However, the first thing that I noticed was how the quality of the fim had suffered.  The color was faded and the darker images lacked clarity.  It reminded me of recently watching our family films from that same decade.  I'm not sure why the quality suffered; lack of proper care and maitenance, poor quality film or whatever.  I decided not to let the film's quality affect my appreciation of the film's quality, if you get my meaning.  I'm not sure how many hours of filming went into getting the finished product but there must have been a year of two of dedicated camera hours to get the amazing scenes that are in this movie.  From the mountain lions to the prairie dogs (and a lot in between), there are numerous unforgetable scenes.  The narration is properly subdued while helpfully informative.  I was amazed to see the birth of a buffalo calf happening on film (I somehow didn't remember that scene but, then, I saw this on TV in the late '50's or early 60's so I can believe it would have been editted out).  There is plenty of life and death struggles but without any unnecessary gore or blood; we got the picture well enough without all that stuff.

I got this VHS pretty inexpensively and I consider it a bargain.  If you don't understand what people mean when they talk about ""family"" entertainment on TV, spend less than $10 and get this video.  It's as good an example of the kind of show that appealed to multiple generations of both sexes as you're apt to find.",1177286400,4,2153,4.663129973474801
8012692,5,B0001HKXSQ,"Although the original premise is no longer a given, this is a wonderful movie. Perhaps as a result of this movie, many states have made nature preserves of original prairie land so that future generations can see what our ancestors did when they came. Animal and bird life shown are: the whooping crane, pronghorn antelope, bighorn sheep, bison, and the prairie dog. This movie will be in volume 2 of True-Life Adventures DVD on December 5th of this year.",1157932800,3,455,4.772151898734177
