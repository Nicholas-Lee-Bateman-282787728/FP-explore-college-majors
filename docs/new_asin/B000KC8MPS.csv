8155641,1,B000KC8MPS,"I ordered this after seeing the film/documentary about Jeff Key (Semper Fi) on TV. THIS IS ""NOT"" that. It ""is"" an interview with questions asked by a girl/woman who is off camera, and the sound is awful- so you can NOT UNDERSTAND A WORD SHE SAYS.",1251676800,,246,4.369565217391305
8155642,5,B000KC8MPS,"Intense real eye opener for the world with REAL honest insight, educational for NOT just the NON Military, but for the World. Watch and learn about REAL HUMAN emotion and insight outside your own preconceived notions of what you ""think"" War and Homosexuality are about. ""Watch and Learn"", Then be brave enough to share this movie and your new and positive insight with those not yet as fortunate as you to have seen and experienced this work of art for the mind and soul.",1249776000,,471,4.619047619047619
8155643,5,B000KC8MPS,"This touching and real movie stopped me in my tracks. It's about time a true film was made from a gay, military man's point of view. It made me cry for many reasons, but most of all, the fact that our military is missing out on having the best soldiers in the world simply because they're gay.  Jeff is devoted, real and honest.  As a person and HIV/LGBT educator, I will share his story as often as possible and recommend this movie.  By the way, I am a straight female who is married to a Desert Storm Vet.",1193702400,6,508,4.163265306122449
