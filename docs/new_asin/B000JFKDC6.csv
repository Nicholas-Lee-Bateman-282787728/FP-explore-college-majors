2670373,4,B000JFKDC6,"This is a heartwarming movie, with love and loss.  I admit, I didn't buy it from this seller, so I don't know about the Eros logo ruining the movie, but I was touched by the story.
This is the summary on the back of the DVD that should be helpful:
Zeenat, an independant and self-assured young woman, lives in a kashmiri village where she falls in love with Amir, who she marries athe day before he leaves to take up a job in Saudi Arabia.  Far away in rural Rajasthan, Meera bids farewell to her new husband Shankar, who is also on his way to a job in the Middle East.  Meera and Zeenat miss their husbands and get to talk to them occasionally on the phone.
These two sets of lives come collapsing down when a horrible piece of news reaches them.  Shankar has been killed, and Amir has been arrested on the charge of murder.  Even though there is reason to believe it was an accident, Amir has been sentenced to death.  The only way out? If Meera, Shankar's widow, agrees to pardon her husband's killer, his life can be spared.
How will Zeenat succeed in her quest to save her husband's life?",1290902400,,1093,4.307317073170732
2670374,1,B000JFKDC6,"I have only one comment for this film which I feel should be grounds for boycotting the studio that produced it (EROS). They put their logo in the upper left hand corner at different points in the film. Really this is unacceptable and if we as consumers tolerate it, it will soon become the norm. This is a fine film but I suggest you get it some other way than from this studio.",1282867200,3,379,4.205479452054795
2670375,5,B000JFKDC6,"Dor is the Hindi word for ""string"".  And, paraphrasing James Hanley's tuneful composition, as one views&listens to this film: zing go the strings of one's heart.
Written and directed by Nagesh Kukunoor and featuring  Ayesha Takia, Gul Panag and Shreyas Talpade Dor is more, much more. Cinematographer Sudeep Chatterjee's eye for the pictorial image brings the screen to life with colorful scenery - moreover, every frame taken as individual stills would make for beautiful individual works of art ready to be framed and hung on a wall of an art museum or photography studio. ""He composes and constructs stylised but simple images which don't scream for attention, but unassumingly add up to create the film's striking overall visual design.""
Dor is about two women who come from diverse backgrounds and how fate brings them together.  Quoting  The Times of India: ""Dor makes a strong feminist statement without being strident or shouting slogans. And all along, the riveting friendship between the two polarized women and the events that bring them together, keep tugging at your heart."" In addition to encouraging women to follow their own desires, this film, in its low-key presentation, matter-of-fact juxtapositions Hindu and Muslim cultures without overtly making a fuss about it.
Ayesha Takia has extraordinary resonance in a quiet, realistic performance that goes deep into the complex character of newly- widowed  Hindu Meera, continuing to show new facets of herself in a climactic confrontation scene when she reveals her true feelings to Gul Panag's Zeenat, a newly-recent Muslim bride. As her bold counterpart, Panag presents a strong female role model easy for Westerners to identify with.

Although critically well reviewed and winner of a number of prestigious awards, this film was a commercial failure in India. It is not your typical Bollywood film. It is a quiet, affective & effective motion picture.  Its musical score is also more of an elitist one and for niche audiences.
Dor, as its title literally implies, is about a series of  events tied or threaded together--or more precisely, the commonality of Indian women in pursuing their own desires and independence.
Do not miss it!",1235260800,3,2203,5.220963172804533

Peace,

2670377,5,B000JFKDC6,"FYI - ""dor"" means a string in Hindi and thats the intended title - the explanation above is incorrect. (There is also a picture of string on the cover)

Anyhoo - the movie is fantastic with breathtaking backdrops from Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan but that us not what makes the movie so special. The story is great , I won't go into the details as other reviews have already covered that, but so is the acting - both Gul and Ayesha have done a fantastic job playing out their characters. It was a pleasant surprise to see two women with such glamorous background play these roles to perfection - I have not seen the strong women played so well after Smita Patil and Shabana Azmi. Shreyas Talpade has also done a great job with his role, though he is capable of much more - I would have loved to see him play a more substantative role than his depiction of a con man / street actor.

All and all a great movie - which I am proud to have in my collection as one of the good Bollywood films in recent times.

Also, Kudos to Amazon.com for adding Bollywood films and music for sale.",1173484800,5,1080,4.284313725490196
2670378,4,B000JFKDC6,"I caught this at the Indo-Arts Film Festival in New York. First thing, is the haunting stark beauty of rajastahn, if you can't get a good shot with your camera there then give up making films.
Gul Panag plays an intelligent, beautiful dedicated woman...which is what she is in real life
Shreyas Talpade is one of the best natural comedians I have ever seen. He almost stole the film (difficult to do with Gal and Rajasthan in the picture :)",1168473600,3,440,4.5125
2670379,5,B000JFKDC6,I had high very high expectations for this film and it more than lived up to them.  A film for all movie lovers! BEST FILM I HAVE SEEN THIS YEAR!!!,1165536000,2,147,3.9
2670380,5,B000JFKDC6,"""Dor"" transliterates the Hindi word ""daur,"" or ""run,"" which also can be a euphemism for any all-out effort.  And that's what this movie is about - one woman's desperate race, against the clock, against cultural obstacles, and against the worst aspects of human nature - to save her husband's life.

Nagesh Kukunoor is one of India's most innovative young directors, and his films have a reputation for being more than just cinema:  they are works of art in every respect, lovingly and carefully crafted - from the dialogues to the settings and cinematography.  Most of all, however, Kukunoor is attentive to casting and character-development.  Yet for all these art-film aspects, Dor will please any audience; nor is it without a nod to traditional Bollywood in the form of music and dance, although in the case of Dor the music is so sensitively rendered that it becomes another layer of the characterization and mood of the film.

The crisis around which Dor revolves is one that millions of Indians can relate to:  wives left at home while husbands go abroad to seek their fortunes and remit money to support their families.  In this case, however, two women, each strong in their own way, face the trial of overcoming a tragedy.  An independently-minded young Muslim woman from Himachal Pradesh learns that her husband is accused of murdering his flat-mate in Saudi Arabia, and will be executed unless his victim's widow will sign a petition for mercy.  The other side of the coin is Meera, a traditional young Rajasthani woman who must decide, ultimately, whether or not to forgive the man accused of murdering her husband.

Nagesh Kukunoor, however, takes this crisis as a point of departure for looking at a variety of experiences and themes.  One of these is Meera's widowhood in a very conservative Rajput clan, in which a woman's status is attached to that of her husband, and a widow expected to live in secluded, abject mourning for the rest of her life.  Another theme is that of friendship.  A third theme is that of personal strength and integrity.  In a masterstroke, Kukunoor leaves the men in this story ""off stage.""  You never really will know what actually happened in Saudi Arabia.  Instead, he focuses on the women left behind in India, and their struggle to make some sense of their shattered lives.

Dor has been described as a ""sweet"" movie, and it is, but at the same time it leaves you wondering, right to the end, if there will truly be a happy ending. Above all, what struck me about Dor was how subtle the movie was - there was no melodrama, no ""camp.""  The two female characters are strong, but not stereotyped.  They are nuanced and believable, trying to work within realistic constraints to find common ground and solace.  In the end, however, Dor is a movie that you can walk away from thinking that all is right with the world; it is a beautiful, quiet celebration of human dignity and decency.

Western audiences also will appreciate Dor, which is a great introduction to life in modern India.  The movie also is only a little more than 2 hours long, and perfectly edited, which will make it more acceptable to people unfamiliar with Indian cinema. It will be very surprising, indeed, if Dor does not win a garland of major awards at international film festivals.",1165449600,11,3299,4.779541446208113

I missed the 30 day window to return it, UPS refused to set a time for pick up and no one was home when they stopped and they wouldn't allow us to mail it back from the office.  I can't review the movie based on the shipping issues only that they would not play in my machines and it may or may not have been a good movie and/or a quality disc, I can't say.",1424822400,,523,3.869158878504673

8150179,4,B000JFKDC6,"This is a Hindi movie. It is a story of 2 married women who do not know each other, but who become intertwined by fate. It is fate which has caused one tragedy and averts another.

The story, as narrated, is quite credible. The direction is perceptive and excellent. Hats off to Nagesh Kukunoor, the Director! Good acting by Gul Panag, Shreyas Talpade and Ayesha Takia.

Gul Panag lives in the mountains and has to make a long journey to desert country to find a stranger, Ayesha Takia, who, fate has decreed, has the power to grant mercy to Panag's husband. However, the story is not as plain as that. It depicts quite a unique episode which brings Panag to Takia. Panag is the reminder of Takia's misery, but they end up becoming friends.
It is about the fortitude of a woman and the courage and conviction of the other.

The background song stays with you well after you have seen the movie. The Director has put in a brief appearance in the movie.

This is quality Indian cinema and a `must see'.",1296777600,2,1000,4.448087431693989
