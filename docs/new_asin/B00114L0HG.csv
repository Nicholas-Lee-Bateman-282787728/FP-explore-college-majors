3059964,4,B00114L0HG,"This 2 DVD set contains seven selected episodes of what I consider to be one of the best TV dramas of all time. Disc One contains the two part episode, ""Split Second To An Epitaph"". According to the paper inserted inside the DVD holder, both parts originally aired on the same night, September 26, 1968. The clever way the wheelchair bound detective (played by Raymond Burr) foils his kidnappers in the October 24, 1968 episode, ""Desperate Encounter"", on Disc Two, makes a great payoff for the viewer. For those who can't afford the entire second season, this set is well worth the purchase and well worth the time watching.",1216598400,7,624,4.73394495412844

8240289,3,B00114L0HG,"I am 62 years old so I grew up watching Ironside and I just love Perry Mason.  I, therefore, decided to purchase this dvd, however if you are not from the era I an from you probably won't like it.  I say this because I am from the era and it's just ok; something to watch when I have nothing else to watch.",1373846400,2,306,3.8412698412698414
8240290,4,B00114L0HG,"Ex-Chief of Detectives Robert T. Ironside, is wheelchair bound after surviving an attempted assassination.  He now serves as a special consultant to the San Francisco police department.  His staff consists of detective sergeant Ed Brown (Don Galloway), officer Eve Whitfield (Barbara Anderson) and personal aide Mark Sanger (Don Mitchell).  This two disc set contains the first seven episodes of the second season, providing a nice sampling of the kind of action and suspense to be found in the second season.

Rather than being a breakneck hunt and chase, Ironside has more of a thinking man's approach, looking for leads to a trail, and then following through with dogged determination.  There usually aren't a myriad of suspects to consider, and the focus is often on the episode's one or two main guest stars.

The set opens with 'Shell Game' where Sorrell Brooke guests as a master thief who despite being warned by the police, plans the robbery of some valuable jewels.  This police procedural, shows the Ironside team running in top form.

Don Stroud who would find early career success playing heavies, makes his second appearance in the series as a criminal, in the two parter 'Split Second to an Epitaph'.  Stroud is Albee, a thief turned killer, who knocks down The Chief while making his escape from a hospital pharmacy.  The fall stimulates nerves in Ironside's spine, leading to the hope that an operation might restore the use of his legs.  Since Ironside is the only one who can identify him, Albee and a nurse he is romantically involved with, plan his demise during his upcoming surgery.  The tale is fleshed out with some side stories involving another spinal cord injury victim, and a new father.  The phrase to remember, 'the bank examiners are coming!'

Ricardo Montalban guests as cop suspected in the death of an abortionist in 'The Sacrifice', a heavy family drama that gets a little bogged down at times.  The same can't be said about the racially charged `Robert Phillips vs. The Man', where Ironside must clear an Afro-American leader (Paul Winfield) of a murder rap.  The relationship between Mark Sanger (who is black) and Robert Ironside, was quite special at the time, and was making a statement about race relations on network TV.  Here, Mark comes full circle.  At one time he was the one looking at Ironside with distrust and scorn, now he defends him against his militant black brothers.  Paul Winfield's performance is fiery, provocative, and uncompromising, getting close to, but not quite crossing the line.  The resolution is somewhat weak, but the performances by the principals are memorable.

`Desperate Encounter' is one of the best episodes of the season, showing that even on his own, Ironside remains quite resourceful.  The Chief and Mark arrive in a small town, looking for a friend of Ironside.  The man is something of a hermit and appears to be missing.  Ironside isn't ready to say farewell, and poking around, stumbles into a suspicious situation that soon becomes deadly dangerous.  Even in captivity, Ironside demonstrates that he is not to be underestimated.

Comedian Milton Berle takes on a dramatic role, as a TV talk show host, in 'I, The People'.  Berle goes way, way, over the top, as Ross Howard, an obnoxious, confrontational, right wing type, who is receiving death threats.  Things wrap up with 'Price Tag: Death' where Clu Gulagher guests as a small time thief, who kills a bum that shows up unexpectedly, while he is committing a robbery.  A sad tale of a loser's downward spiral.

The remainder of season two is similarly diverse, so if you like these episodes, you will probably enjoy the full season set of 26 episodes.  As the full season set is a much more economical buy, this set is probably for those with just a casual interest.",1250467200,4,3806,4.918495297805642
