8025294,5,0739073095,"You really need some chops to keep up with this material. It's advanced to the point that you probably need to be a pro musician to keep up and not get lost. You need to be thoroughly conversant in music theory; you need to know all the chords out there including the relative minors, sus, add, 7s, 9s, 11s, 13s. You need to be able to throw down those chords anywhere on the fretboard. You need to be fluid and very fast with all the scale modes especially the mixolydian mode. I'm not close to being a pro; I jam on the weekends and after work just to decompress and relax. I was still able to get something out of this DVD. My speed has really improved. My metronome is proof. Paul Gilbert's relaxed, humorous, laid-back teaching style is contagious...what happens is you end up playing the DVD over and over, so you'll take away something from the content no matter the skill set you bring to the table. Also, watching a virtuoso like Paul Gilbert go through the exercises and examples at the speed of light up and down the guitar neck inspires you to play more and practice more. An amazing DVD by an amazing guitarist; it's just not for beginners. Newbies should work with Jamplays, Guitar Tricks, or Next Level Guitar for a few years before embarking on this journey.",1368057600,12,1274,4.472103004291846
8025295,5,0739073095,"Nice lessons from the shredder King, is a god complement of Intense rock, recommended for increase your guitar skills and fun",1354665600,2,125,5.0
8025296,5,0739073095,"Brilliant DVD as to be expected from Paul Gilbert who consistently introduces new techniques and insight into this limitless instrument.  Packed with different methods of playing the scales with a mathematical approach for ""shredders"" but also very tasteful and adaptable to many styles.  For lack of a better phrase, Paul doesn't just give you a fish, he teaches you how to fish.

Further, included on the disc is the tab for every example that Paul shows.  I haven't watched an instructional DVD for a while and this may be a standard inclusion these days but it was fantastic to be able to simply sit back and watch the DVD without pausing after every example.

Highly recomended for the intermediate player through to the advanced player who is getting board with running up and down modes.",1330387200,4,794,4.851851851851852
