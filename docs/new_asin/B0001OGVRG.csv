2021432,3,B0001OGVRG,"Wow what a pay per view! Obviously it doesn't contain the unpredictability or excitement of either Royal Rumble or Survivor Series, nor does it contain the buildup of a Wrestlemania but man what a show. Actually it wasn't that great.
Emanating from the ReXall Place in Edmonton,Alberta.
Intro Video for Backlash
SHelton Benjamin vs. Ric Flair: I'm surprised the Nature Boy was able to keep up with this future star and that Batista did not show up and interfere, SHelton is just amazing, anyways rather sluggish ending but pretty good match nonetheless.
Tajiri vs. Coach: I love these two entertaining workers but this match was just downright plain and simlpy boring. Also Garrison Cade really took away from the match with his run-in.
Eugune runs into women's locker room and a screamfest ensues. I can actually see now why people hate this character so much. Whatever he's a hero in my book.
Y2J v. CLB and FDDBBFTH : Pretty good match and finally Jericho gets to close up this messy chapter in his career, Trish finally got what she deserved.
Victoria vs. Lita: these two are probably the best women's wrestlers in the world but this match was very lackluster and had really no point to it.
Randy Orton vs. Mick Foley: A Legend is semented into WWE. Mick Foley put a great showing but how can you not admire Randy Orton's work that night, amazing, anyone and I repeat anyone who says wrestling is fake I defy you to watch that match and tell me that it is. Stunning, there are really no words big enough or important sounding enough to capture that match. PLus my rating of the event deserves an extra star it was that good.
La Resistance v. Hurricane and Rosey : Kind of a waste of a match and the crowd was really dead after the previous encounter. Anyways their match on RAW was much better. By the way Eugene stops by and has a little fun with the Quebec flag.
Edge v. Kane: Edge's big return after 14 months turns out to be not even Heat material. It was really that bad, maybe this will cause a build up leading into Bad Blood that will feed the hunger this feud needs.
Final Encounter Triple Threat Match for the World Heavweight title: I'm so tired of the Bret Hart storyline that has been repeated and teased over and over again just to make the Canadians happy to boo. I'm a Montrealer but I have long forgave HBK and Vince (not Earl Hebner though, I dislike him very much) anyways not that great of a match to a pay per view that was really a one match show.",1082332800,3,2473,4.4734513274336285
2021433,1,B0001OGVRG,"Last night's WWE PPV, was one os the greatest lose of time and money that I have made. There was only one match that was really ggod and worth to see: CACTUS JACK vs. randy orton. It was a hardcore rules match, lots of blood ad acton.
The rest of the card wasn't good.  HHH problems with being old and HBK been booed in Canada is nothing new ( It's public domain).
The only good thing is: THE RETURN OF CACTUS JACK !!!",1082332800,,418,4.036144578313253

Great opener. Ric can still go!
Winner: Shelton Benjamin

Winner: Chris Jericho
Match 4:
*Women's Championship*
Lita vs. Victoria(c)
8.5/10
This was very good and entertaining! Lita and Victoria are two of the very few women in the WWE that can actually wrestle and look good doing it. I am a big fan of Women's Wrestling when done right, and this match did just that. I really wanted Lita to win though, I mean come on, it's been 3 1/2 years since she's held the Title. But, I'm sure she'll have another shot. Great competition from both women.
Winner: Victoria

*Hardcore Match*
*Evolution Banned From Ringside*
Cactus Jack vs. Randy Orton(c)
10/10
WOW! EXCELLENT MATCH! VERY BRUTAL! DID JUST WHAT THEY BOTH SAID!  I thought that Cactus Jack would win but Randy really took a beating and all that Mick can give. On this night, Randy Orton truly proved that he is a worthy competitor and truly earned my respect.
Winner: Randy Orton
Match 6: La Resistance vs. The Hurricane & Rosey
DUD
This stupid fill-in was made a half-hour ago on HEAT. No reason for this crap at all except to waste time. Funny appearance by Eugene though.
Winners: The Hurricane & Rosey
Match 7: Edge vs. Kane
7/10
Man, I am really dissapointed by this match... I really thought that this match would be better especially with the return of Edge after over a year.
Winner: Edge
Main Event:
*The Final Encounter*
*World Heavyweight Championship*
*Triple Threat Match*
Chris Benoit(c) vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H
10/10
WOW! ANOTHER INCREDIBLE MATCH! JUST AS GOOD AS THEIR WRESTLEMANIA BATTLE! Benoit, against all odds proved that he is not just another One-Hit-Wonder! The Crowd was UNBELIEVABLE! They were into every match. ""YOU SCREWED BRET"" chants for HBK and ""YOU TAPED OUT"" chants for HHH. Chris Benoit got of course the greatest pops and the crowd was with him all the way.
Winner: Chris Benoit
OVERALL:
Overall analysis is based on Arena setup, Crowd reactions, Wrestler attire, Commentating, Stroylines behind the matches, the Matches themselves, and of course how entertaining the PPV was.
8.7/10
This is a worthy purchase, great event although I would wait a while and buy this from someone on the Marketplace for a cheaper price. All of the matches on the card had a good storyline behind them except the fill-in. The crowd was just as good and as pumped throughout the night as New York's crowd. The commentating was nice and funny. Well, I hope this was a helpful review for you, Later.",1082246400,6,3059,4.871401151631478

2021437,5,B0001OGVRG,"WWE Backlash 2004 is just spectacular. I don't want to waste any time so lets begin! This is my first review so let me know how I did.

Shelton Benjamin VS Ric Flair- This was a little slow at the beginning but picked its self up gradually throughout. It was a story of new style and old traditional wrestling. Benjamin really got to prove himself but is still very underrated. What was weird was both men were sort of heels so it was hard to choose but Flair is still better. Benjamin weakly wins. 7.5/10

Coach VS Tajiri- Was not done well at all but what can you expect. Still watch it for jokes sake. Thankfully it was quick. Still it was fun and entertaining to see this on a PPV event. 6/10

Jericho VS Christian & Trish Stratus- These men can put on one hell of a show and they did. This was when trish was ""heel"" and did an ok job with it. Great back and forth fighting. Jericho kindly spanks trish too haha =). Trish is still the greatest diva. Jericho pins christian and redeems himself from Wrestlemania XX. 8.5/10

Women's Championship
Lita VS Victoria(c)- This match was pretty good, Lita can really wrestle and proved herself. But sadly she did not completely pull it off and Victoria retains the belt. 8/10

This is when Backlash starts to shine and becomes so memorable.

Hardcore Match
Intercontinental Championship
Cactus Jack VS Randy Orton(c)- This match honestly, was something special and brought the best out of young Orton. Such a great contest or WAR from start to finish. With great unexpecting spots that blow your mind. Orton finishes Foley with an RKO on the barb wire bat. This is the main reason to pick this one up. 9.5/10

Hurricane/Rosey VS La Resistance- This match was nothing special more like a smackdown opener than anything, don't remember much either. Skip this. 3/10

Edge VS Kane- This was a match to get into because both men were on there way to rise to the top in the future. Good solid match to see, and edge wins with his broken hand. 8/10

World Heavyweight Championship
Triple H VS Shawn Michaels VS Chris Benoit(c)- Although I have not seen there wrestlemania encounter, I think it is safe to say that this one was greater. It was so emotional in Benoits hometown and I was hoping for Shawn to capture it one more time. Sadly he didn't and benoit left the building as Champion. But do not get me wrong this was a perfect rematch that stole the show that night. 10/10",1283644800,,2417,4.5
2021438,4,B0001OGVRG,"Backlash is usually a good event.  This followed Wrestlemania XX, which I believed to be much better than a lot of people give it credit for.  This year's Backlash was a good entry into the streak of successful PPVs WWE had put on in this era.  There were a couple of so-so matches on the card, but were not enough to bring the event down in any respect.  Backlash 2004 took place in Alberta, Canada.

Here is the card:

Shelton Benjamin vs. Ric Flair:
With all due respect to Mr. Flair, the last several years of his career have not been the best regarding his in-ring abilities.  Yes, he does bring a lot of charisma to his matches, but other than that, his style is very slow, repetitive, and quite boring.  As for the match, it was not bad, but slow paced, even for terms of the exciting Shelton Benjamin.  This was a decent opener, but I personally would have preferred something with more of a rapid pace.

Jonathan Coachmen vs. Tajiri:
This was actually something of a surprise for wrestling standards.  Many would argue that Coachmen should not be in the ring wrestling, but he did not do too bad here.  Not to be misunderstood because it was struggling to rise above mediocrity, but it was not as bad as you might expect.  Coach gets some assistance from Lance Cade to pick up a victory over Tajiri.  Quite frankly, I think Tajiri deserves better than this.  The match is watchable, and something different.

Chris Jericho vs. Christian & Trish Stratus:
The storyline brewing here before this match, even dating back to Wrestlemania was actually very interesting.  Trish Stratus is great as a heel or a face.  Overall, this was everything you expected it to be.  If you have ever seen a male vs. female match from WWE in the past, this is nothing new.  The chemistry between Christian and Jericho in the ring is always good, and the interesting storyline between the trio was enough to keep me interested in the match itself.

Women's title:
Victoria vs. Lita
These were the best two that could have been picked to be put in this match for the title.  The match was botch-free, which is expected from these two.  Overall there was something very awkward about the match.  The camera angles were odd, and the crowd was not into it very much.  The commentating was also kind of weird, which made this match overall kind of uncomfortable (for lack of a better term) to watch.  I do recommend it, so you will see what I mean when you tune in.

Intercontinental Title Hardcore Match:
Randy Orton vs. Cactus Jack
This is the epitome of how a hardcore match should be!  Every moment of the match kept you in awe, and was exciting from bell to bell.  This match actually gave me a new found respect for Randy Orton, which I continue to have to this very day.  Cactus Jack is always great in these match types, and it would not have been the same without him.  I do believe that this encounter beats Foley's match with Edge at WM22.  Thumbtacks, barber wire, baseball bats, fire, trash cans, and much more made this one that will never soon be forgotten.  This was the match of the evening!

Hurricane & Rosey vs. La Resistance:
This match was nothing more than a match to cool down the crowd after the previous hardcore match.  In terms of the performance, it was not bad.  You probably get just as much out of it as you possibly could.  Eugene is also ringside here which adds some humorous appeal to it (if you are in to that kind of thing).  Overall just a filler that will never really be remembered for anything.  Worth a look.

Edge vs. Kane:
In my opinion, this was the time in WWE in which Kane was losing his scariness after unmasking the prior summer.  Up to this point, Kane was scaring fans each week, making a big impact on many levels.  It stopped right about this time in 2004.  Edge was also just returning and faced Kane here with a broken hand.  I enjoyed that match for Kane's standards, and would not mind taking another look at it.  Edge got a lot of fan support towards the end of the match.

World Title Triple Threat:
Chris Benoit vs. Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels
I really enjoyed this one.  It will most likely never be referred to in the same regard as their encounter at Wrestlemania, but it was still a great entry into their match list.  A couple of the spots in the match got kind of boring and slowed down, but overall that did not seem to matter.  The crowd also finally picked up in this match for their hometown champion Beniot.  The ending was very emotional, and Beniot holds on to the strap in his home city.

My overall impression of Backlash 2004 was good.  One thing that I liked about the event was that it did not have any weak matches.  Some were sub-par, but none were below PPV standards.  I recommend it.",1271721600,,4750,4.442641946697567
2021439,4,B0001OGVRG,"After coming off a little bit of a disappointing Wrestlemania XX, RAW served up a good quality ppv in Backlash. They advertised this ppv as being Chris Benoit's ""homecoming"" since Backlash was hosting from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Most of the card is rock solid as I pointed out in my title but there are some low points as well. But overall this is an event that made up for Wrestlemania and a good ppv to pick up.

1. Shelton Benjamin vs. Ric Flair
This was a fun opener. Shelton showed some great athleticism and agility. It seemed that Flair was trying to keep up with Benjamin throughout the match. Flair worked on the leg of Benjamin for a brief time but it really didn't lead to anywhere. But overall a solid opener and a fun one at that. 3.75/5

2. Tajiri vs. Johnathon Coachman
To believe it or not, this wasn't the worst match of the night. The Coach actually held his own even with taking some hard pops from Tajiri. Coach does know how to sell a beating. I do have to give him that. But overall this match was more on the amusment side. I actually laughed during this match. But still not the best nor the worst of the night. 2/5

3. Handi-cap Match
Chris Jericho vs. Christian & Trish Stratus
Having one of the best matches at Wrestlemania, Jericho & Christian kept it going here. I think this story went off pretty good and all 3 delivered a solid match. Y2J & Christian had a strong showing and good competitive match up. While Jericho and Trish added humor to the match. But I don't think this match topped their WM encounter. Still though one of the bests of the night. 4.25/5

4. Women's Championship
Victoria vs. Lita
I actually didn't find anything wrong with this match. I really thought Lita and Victoria had a good and competitve women's match up. A couple of good pinning combinations. I found this match quite good actually. 3.25/5

5. Hardcore Match for the Intercontinental Championship
Randy Orton vs. Mick Foley
Before I start, this was a huge match for Orton in his career. And I think Foley did a fantastic job putting over Orton as well. A ton of weapons being brought in such as barbed wire stuff, thumb tacks, chairs, trash cans, and nearly fire also.

As for the match went, this was outstanding and in my view the best of the night. Foley was at his lowest gained weight in years right here. Orton and Foley got very hardcore and violent in this match. They used the weapons very effectively on each other. A couple of good counters and shots were taken. I found this match being one of the greatest hardcore matches in WWE's history. Outstanding match. Match of the night for me. 5/5

6. La Resistance vs. Hurricane & Rosey
Without a doubt the worst match on the card. Even worst once Eugene came out and wander around the ring for no particular reason at all. Just no respect for the match at all. Only here to try and put over Eugene. 1/5

7. Edge vs. Kane
I found it interesting that returning within 3 weeks from his neck injury a year ago, Edge managed to break his hand. I just found that so ironic. But the stipulation was that if the ref caught Edge using his cast, he would be fired. So you knew the cast would come into play at some point. Kane and Edge had a good match, could have been better though. But nothing really that you will remember. Except for Earl Hebner being chanted ""You Screwed Bret"" throughout the whole match. 3.5/5

8. World Heavyweight Championship
Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Benoit vs. Triple H
They advertised this match as being the Final Encounter and to quote from Triple H this is defiantely one of the greatest rematches of all time. Still I don't think this match captured the same majic as it did from Wrestlemania. But still a phenomenal match. I felt the match was different though then from Wrestlemania but still great nevertheless. It had a huge crash and burn table spot from HBK. With HBK out, Triple H and Benoit had a good one on one match. Poetic justice as well for the finish. A fantastic match and main event. 5/5

Backlash defiantely made up for Wrestlemania which hosted a great rematch from Wrestlemania, a great hardcore match, and a solid mid card with a dud or two. I recommend on getting this. It's very worth checking out.",1229299200,,4221,4.477243172951885

(Note-Each DVD I review has a ""Match of the DVD"" award somewhere in it.)

WWE Backlash 2004
Backlash 2004 was a top-notch event.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WrestleMania-XX/dp/B0001IN0DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WrestleMania XX</a>&nbsp;was a bit of a let down, but Backlash picked back up on the quality. It did have its low points, but overall this is a solid event. The high points last longer and make you forget a lot of the low points.

Shelton Benjamin VS Ric Flair
This is a fun match. Benjamin dominates most of the match with his quick wrestling. Flair works over Benjamin's leg for a bit, but nothing really comes of it. The match is not amazing, but serves as a good opener.
RATING- 7/10

Coach VS Tajiri
This match starts boring. The crowd is dead. Coach actually does a good job of wrestling Tajiri though. Coach works over the legs of Tajiri. Near the end, the crowd begins to get into the match.
RATING- 5/10

Jericho VS Christian & Trish Stratus
After Jericho was screwed at Wrestlemania, Jericho is seeking revenge. Jericho and Christian put on a clinic in the ring. Trish comes in every now and then for some cheap shots. Sadly, many people will look over this great contest.
RATING- 8.5/10

Women's Championship
Lita VS Victoria(c)
This is a weird match. The participants seem to be to be wrestling in slow motion. There is a complete lack of emotion. The crowd being dead does not help this encounter any.
RATING- 4.5/10

Hardcore Match
Intercontinental Championship
Cactus Jack VS Randy Orton(c)
Hardcore. Brutal. Shocking. Those three words describe this match perfectly. Orton takes a sick plunge into a mass of thumbtacks. Orton also takes a plunge off the stage into a table, which is followed by a huge elbow drop. The only problem I see with this match is that the ending feels a bit sudden. Other than that, this is an awesome match.
RATING- 9.5/10

Hurricane/Rosey VS La Resistance
This match was used to cool off the crowd. Eugene comes out after a few minutes and walks around the ring. The camera stays focused on Eugene for the rest of the match. The match gets no respect at all. This is a waste of time. Luckily, this match only lasts a few minutes.
RATING- 1/10

Edge VS Kane
Edge makes his return to action against Kane. Edge has a broken hand. The story is that if Edge uses his cast as a weapon, he will be suspended. You knew it was only a matter of time before he used it. The match is solid, but nothing you will remember.
RATING- 7/10

World Heavyweight Championship (Match of the DVD)
Triple H VS Shawn Michaels VS Chris Benoit(c)
I am going to say it right now. This match is better than their match at Wrestlemania XX. Benoit is in his hometown and the crowd it going crazy for him. There is also a cool throwback to the Montreal Screwjob. Michaels has a sharpshooter on Benoit and Hebner runs out. It looks like a complete remake of the Montreal Screwjob. The match is filled with cool moments.

2021441,4,B0001OGVRG,"I won't mince words, let's get down to the nitty gritty:

Ric Flair Vs. Sheldon Benjamin - This was one of Sheldon's first foray's into solo competition in 2004 after a successful stint with Charlie Haas as part of ""The World's Greatest Tag Team"" on Smackdown. As for Ric Flair, what's there to say? He's one of the best of all time and he really helps Sheldon (who is a great athlete and wrestler) look good here. Kudos to both men!

Tajiri Vs. The Coach - This was nothing more than a way to introduce Garrison Cade though I have to admit Johnathan Coachman had flashes of brilliance at times against Tajiri. The ""Japanese Buzzsaw"" was never really used much when he came from Smackdown to RAW but he's his usual great self here. Sadly, this wasn't one of his brighter moments. Worth a look though.

Chris Jericho Vs. Trish Stratus/Christian (Cage) - This was rematch of sorts from WrestleMania 20 when Trish and Christian swerved Jericho. While this match could've been a total clusterbomb, these three actually made it halfway entertaining for the home country crowd (all three are from Canada). Jericho gets his revenge on Trish and Christian here. Decent bout.

Victoria Vs. Lita (WWE Women's Title Match) - There have been great women's title matches over the years. This is not one of them! Surprising, considering the talent here. Say what you want about Lita but the woman could perform when she wants and was a 1st class entertainer at one time. Same for Victoria and that's why this match was a letdown. The most exciting part was seeing Molly Holly and Gail Kim (now of TNA) crash the party. Worth one look but not worth repeated viewing.

Randy Orton Vs. Mick Foley (Cactus Jack) - This was a hardcore match for Randy's Intercontinental Title and what a match it was! Foley (like Flair) is good about putting over new or underpushed talent and was at his best. This bout sort of reminded me of the street fight match that Foley had with HHH at The Royal Rumble 2000.

As for Randy, this was one of his biggest bouts during what was (in my view) his hottest streak including his current WWE title reign (as I write this review). He definitely came through here!

Kudos to both men here. I will say this, I am no moralist but I would recommend this match only as for adults only! I don't have kids but if I did, I wouldn't let them watch this match because it does get vicious in spots. Anyway, great match!

La Resistance Vs. Rosey and Hurricane - Got to be honest, didn't watch much of this one. Don't even know who won! Sorry.

Edge Vs. Kane - In Edge's first bout in over a year, he takes on Kane. Not a bad match but I've seen better between these two (particularly WWE Vengeance 2005). Edge wins when he uses his cast on Kane along with a spear.

Chris Benoit Vs. Triple H Vs. Shawn Michaels (World Heavyweight Title Match/Triple Threat Rules) - A great follow up to WrestleMania XX! I tend to like both bouts equally. I don't prefer one over the other. The ending is poetic justice as Benoit makes Shawn tap out to The Sharpshooter in Canada!

On a personal note, this match (while I did enjoy it) made me sad and a bit angry as well. Reason being was seeing Chris' family there and knowing how destroyed they must be by Chris' actions back in June of 2007. While I will never take away what Chris Benoit did in the ring (and he was a great performer), its more important to have a good and stable life away from your profession. In the end, that's what counts. I am no preacher or anything but I do have some heart for this family as well as Nancy's for their loss.

Back to the match, it is worth viewing.

Overall, a great card to get and keep (especially since WWE has pulled this release).",1196899200,2,3713,4.434654919236417
2021442,5,B0001OGVRG,"Backlash was an all Raw PPV, heres how it went down

Ric Flair VS Shelton Benjamin-Good match between to awesome wrestlers.
A shame Benjamin hasn't got much to do anymore. He showed so much promise and still does.

Jonathan Coachman VS Tajiri- Too bad Tajiri was never given anything to do. He was a great wrestler but he was almost lost in the shuffle after moving from Smackdown.

Chris Jericho VS Christian and Trish Stratus: Good match but nothing of value other the Jericho getting revenge on Christian for stealing Trish.

Victoria VS Lita: Who cares?

Mick Foley VS Randy Orton: Match of the night. Foley puts on his usual hardcore match and Orton held his own well. Brutual match.

La Resistance VS Rosey and Hurricane: Bathroom break!

Edge VS Kane: Still in the bathroom

Chris Benoit VS Triple H VS Shawn Michaels: The WrestleMaina rematch. A really good triple threat match with Benoit retaining the gold.

Shelton Benjamin vs. Ric Flair - What an opener as we're seening shelton coming into his own in a huge way while Ric Flair gave his best match in singles action that he's had in a while at this time.

Tajiri vs. The Coach - This was actually a watchable & decent match instead of being a comedic or horrible encounter.

Chris Jericho vs. Christian & Trish Stratus - This was a step below the WM match but in no way was this match bad or disappointing as the underrated Christian & Jericho always know how to put together a great performance together.

Womens Champion Victoria vs. Lita - Unfortunally, the chemistry just wasn't there as this match was just an average encounter but very disappointing concidering the potential this match had.

No Holds Barred: Intercontinental Champion Randy Orton vs. Mick Foley - Foley in this match did what he did for Triple H in 2000 & Edge at WM22.  He put Orton in his hardcore enviroment & heavily put him over as it showed that Orton can take some serious punishment that most wrestlers can't & still go while telling a good story in the ring as well.

Rosey & Hurricane vs. La Resistance - This was a huge dud as Eugene came out in the middle & just ran the ropes in the ring for no reason while the match was going on.  Just pointless.

Edge vs. Kane - Edge's return after neck surgery against Kane.  This match was just there as Edge still showed some ring rust.  Nothing memorable here to note as their series in 2005 heavily overtopped & made this match forgettable.

World Champion Chris Benoit vs. Triple H vs. HBK - They were able to do it twice & delieve one hell of a match here with the crowd more into it than their WM encounter (they are in Canada with HBK & Earl Hebner afterall).  The ending with HBK tapping out in the sharpshooter was ""justice.""

DVD extras that I can remember include Benoit visiting the Hart Family house for the last time (it was sold shortly afterwards), and his speech the next night at RAW.  Overall, RAW put on one hell of a show here as there was only one dull match.  This is a PPV I highly recommend.",1179446400,3,2288,4.424821002386635

2021446,4,B0001OGVRG,"Hello and welcome to my Backlash 2004 PPV review. I will run down everything from the opening match to the interviews and I will grade each thing I review out of 10. Lets begin...

Val Venis vs Matt Hardy 6/10

A suprising great match on Heat. Val Venis wins.

Shelton Benjamin vs Ric Flair 8/10

Great match because of Shelton looking like a million bucks at his first Raw PPV. Shelton wins with a top rope clothesline.

Coach vs Tajiri 5/10

I thought this match was absolute crap at first but when I saw Coach actually do a few moves it really picked up from there.

Coach wins with a roll up when Garrison Cade cheap shoted Tajiri.

Chris Jericho vs Christian and Trish 9/10

A nice match that looked pretty good on paper and it surely didn't dissapoint though it was not as good as thier Wrestlemania bout. Chris Jericho wins with a running Enziguiri on Christian.

Eugene in the diva locker room  8/10

Very funny with Eugene seeing Molly without her wig!

Lita vs Victoria 4/10

This was the worst match on the PPV. Victoria wins with a inside cradle. After the match Gail Kim(now in TNA) and Molly run in and destroy Lita and Victoria.

Mick Foley vs RKO 10/10

This was the best match on the PPV and possibly match of the year(I think it wasn't but a match of the year candidate for sure). Lots of weapons come into play throughout the match. I think it was a little bit better than Edge vs Foley at Wrestlemania 22. RKO wins.

Triple H interview 6/10

Triple H just says lightning won't strike twice and that he will win the title.

Hurricane and Rosey vs La resistance 6/10

Pretty good but could have done a little better follwing a match of the year candidate.

Edge vs Kane 9/10

Great match with the stipulation if Edge used his cast he would lose and be suspended. Edge wins with a low blow, a shot with his cast and a spear.

Triple H vs HBK vs the Crippler 9.5/10

This was an awesome way to end the PPV. I am a huge HHH fan but unfortunately he could not capture the gold. Lots of hate for HBK since this was held in Canada(Montreal Screwjob). Chris Benoit wins with a sharpshooter on HBK( the same move HBK used on Bret Hart).",1149465600,3,2146,4.3075

Shelton Benjamin vs Ric Flair- I didn't think this was the best choice of opener when you have Jericho and Christian in a match toghther. This was nothing but, chops, clotheslines, and backdrops. This was nothing horrible but, not to good. Shelton is nowhere near as good as he is now in this match. Shelton wins. Match Rating 5.5

Johnathan Coachman vs Tajiri- This match was not good at all. Coach could have skill but, if you watch this match he doesn't at all. Coach wins with Garrison Cade help. Match Rating 4

Christian & Trish vs Chris Jericho- This a good match with a good storyline. Jericho and Christian work great togther. Trish was thrown in there for humor she didn't do anything but, cheer for CLB. Jericho wins this. Match Rating 8

Victoria vs Lita Women's Championship- I skipped it but, I think that Victoria wins. Match Rating ?

Randy Orton vs Cactus Jack IC Title NO HOLDS BARRED- This is one hell of a street fight. This gave Orton the push to become the ultimate legend killer. Randy Suplexs and throws Cactus's head back on the runway. Then they get out a board with barbwire on it and Randy scoop slams him on it. Randy wins with an RKO on Barby. Match Rating 10

Hurricane & Rosey vs La Resitance- I thought this was some good tag action. Hurricane and Rosey are a good tag team. Nice crossbody out of the ring by Hurricane and they win. Match Rating 7

Edge vs Kane- Very short. An ok for its time. Edge should have gotten a better match for being out for 13 months. Edge wins. Match Rating 6

HBK vs HHH vs Benoit WHC- Great match. Better than there Wrestlemania match. Michaels tried a crossbody but goes through a table. Why were they booing HBK he is like one of the most talented wrestlers of all time. HBK taps to the Sharpshooter so Benoit retains. Match Rating 10

2021452,4,B0001OGVRG,"If you've been following the WWE for at least the past 5-6 years, you'd know that Backlash(WWE's April PPV) is almost always a ""wrestlemania revenge"" ppv where the same wrestlers who wrestled each other at Mania usually see each other again in some sort of rematch. The first couple Backlashes were very weak, but 2004 had to be the best one so far. Instead of hitting the bad points at the end, i'll touch them first. As some others have said in their reviews, the second to last match with La Resistance vs Hurricane/Rosey was not needed at all. The WWE always has to throw in a time wasting match at every ppv. At times the Edmenton crowd was somewhat stale which is suprising considering it was the first wwe show in Edmenton in decades. Those are the only downsides. On to the matches......1)Shelton Benjamin vs Ric FlairVery good match if you are a fan of wrestling and telling a story. Flair can work with anyone and make them look good. However, that wasn't needed because Benjamin is a great young star already. This was a very good young school vs old school match. My only gripe was the finish which was weak. I understood the benjamin win because they were pushing him heavily at the time, but it would have been nice to see Flair win to prove that ""the wiser wrestler always gets the last laugh"". 3/5 stars2)Chris Jericho vs Christian/TrishThis was a leftover from wrestlemania 20,and was nicely booked. Trish would get her shots in, but would get away from Jericho just in time. Finally, Jericho got his hands on her, and it the crowd went nuts. Jericho and Christian always have great matches together and this was just that. 4/5)Victoria vs LitaThis started off slow but ended up being very good. Victoria is a great worker and helped the match come off a lot better than expected. 3/5)Randy Orton vs Cactus JackRandy Orton at the time of this ppv was the IC champ and was doing a great job as heel. I prefer his IC champ reign way better than his babyface world champ reign in late 04. Jack was his typical crazy self. The match was a lot more gruesome than I expected when it comes to WWE standards. This isn't for the faint of heart. The outcome was predictable because you knew this was a one time deal with Foley as Jack, but it was still fun to watch. 4/5)Edge vs KaneI had forgot that Edge had a cast when I first watched this. Because I just rented it yesterday. The whole cast thing took away from the match. If Edge was healthy, this match would have been a lot better. Kane is a great worker when he wants to be, and so is edge. I'd say 3/5)La Resistance vs Hurricane/RoseyThis match was added on Sunday Night Heat and there was really no need for it. There were a few good moves in it, like the twisting neckbreaker off the top rope by conway, but that's about it. Unlike the last reviewer, the Eugene running the ropes thing was funny because that's what Eugene character was all about. He loved wrestling and wanted to be a part of it at every point. This was before he had his first match on wwe tv, so it made sense. 2/5 ""Final Encounter"" Benoit vs HBK vs HHHThis match was great IMO. The Edmenton crowd was very hot(unlike what a few reviewers had said). The booed HBK the entire time, and he sold it great. HHH was in true form too. There was a few spots in the match that had you holding on to your tights that Benoit would lose the title. I didn't think he would, but it was still nerve racking to watch, even though it was a year ago. There is a VERY FUNNY part in the match if you've followed the WWE for the past 8-9 years or so and know the whole HBK/Bret/Canada/Earl Hebner thing. They spoofed it great and the crowd ate it up. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it. Last but not least, the ending was a great way to end the match too. 5/5",1115856000,,3789,4.338028169014085

SHELTON BENJAMIN defeated RIC FLAIR: I'm unsure if this was the correct choice as opener. I would have gone with the Jericho match to really get the crowd hot right from the beginning. I had the feeling the crowd didn't know who to cheer in this bout. But having said that, I personally liked most of this match. I thought that the characters would play well off of each other, and they did. Benjamin continued to impress me, while I liked some of the attention to detail in this good psychological bout. A good example was Shelton's failed attempt to block Flair's 2nd figure-four leglock. This 10 minute match needed another 3-4 minutes though, and the finish was way too anti-climactic. Benjamin needs an established finisher to progress. Have I asked where the hell was Batista as yet in this column!?!?!? Match Rating...7

JONATHAN COACHMAN defeated TAJIRI: Ummm, am I allowed to say that I didn't mind this 6 minute match...??? Well, I've just stated that I liked the 'Before They Were Superstars' DVD, so I may as well continue digging my own grave!!! Now I wasn't expecting much from this bout, so I'm probably taking that too much into account. But I really think that this was a pleasant surprise. The crowd were very quiet, but they may have been in shock at the decent quality of Coach's wrestling skills. Coach dominated too much of the match for my liking, but the main criticism of this bout doesn't stand up, in my opinion. It's that Tajiri had to sell for Coach's weak offense. That's not entirely true. Tajiri had to sell his own mistake. He was selling the injury to his leg that was caused when Coach ducked & Tajiri kicked the ringpost. In a short match such as this, it's realistic that an injury such as that can have such a dramatic effect. The interference finish was extremely predictable (even if Cade being the person wasn't). And finally, Coach deserves massive props for taking that wicked kick to the back of the head, while tied to the tree of woe. Match Rating...6

CHRIS JERICHO defeated CHRISTIAN & TRISH STRATUS in a Handicap Match: Entertaining match from both a wrestling & entertainment perspective. Jericho & Christian undoubtedly work well together, while Trish was thrown in for some humor & variety. Funnily enough, the humor didn't do anything for me, yet I'm glad that Trish was a performer in this match. The reason for this is because there appeared to be way too many spots that were similar to their WrestleMania 20 singles match. I won't be too critical of the bout because of this, but I do think that it signalled that this feud may not have too many more places to go. NOTE: I have yet to see their Raw opener as at the time of posting this column. Match Rating...7

VICTORIA defeated LITA to Retain the WWE Women's Title: Now this was an interesting experiment; Attempting to have a technical 7 minute wrestling match involving Lita!!! This may sound contradictory, but it sort of did & didn't work. It resulted in an extremely deliberately paced match. This worked well in some sequences, but just came off as if it was a match in slow motion for most set pieces. I think the WWE sort of had the right idea with the experiment, but just got a little too ambitious. Especially seeing as though Lita was involved. However, I really don't mind it when the women wrestlers try something different. They should be commended for doing so. Interesting is the word I keep coming back to with regards to this match. Match Rating...5

RANDY ORTON defeated 'CACTUS JACK' MICK FOLEY in a Falls Count Anywhere, No Holds Barred Match: Not quite Foley vs Triple H from January 2000, but still a more than satisfactory hardcore match. Many of the spots were a little too telegraphed & not natural or unpredictable enough to make this an instant classic, but that's being a little too picky. Foley did carry the bout to a certain extent, but Orton's performance shouldn't be under-estimated... especially at his age!!! There was definitely enough action during this 23 minutes to not disappoint anyone. My match of the night (if only just). Match Rating...8

THE HURRICANE & ROSEY defeated LA RESISTANCE: How do you rate a match when the camera is hardly on the combatants!?!?!? This was simply a 5 minute filler bout to (a) cool the crowd down after the streetfight & (b) give Eugene more comedy time. As for the actual bout, it did indeed have some brief moments of spark. But it was predominantly a short & messy match. But how could we fully tell, as the camera was on Eugene for most of the time. Oh that's right, it did go back to the match just in time to see a botched 'Eye Of The Hurricane' finish!!! Match Rating...4

EDGE defeated KANE: Extremely ho-hum & predictable 7 minute match. Nothing too awful, but nothing was done to make this bout anything more than mediocre. That's a little disappointing in my opinion, as further intensity couldn't have been that hard to throw into the feud & match. As for Edge's return; He has a good couple of months worth of ring-rust to get rid of before he is to be given a quality feud. That cast on his arm will hinder, rather than help!!! Match Rating...5

CHRIS BENOIT defeated TRIPLE H & SHAWN MICHAELS in a Triple Threat Match to Retain the World HeavyWeight Title: The obvious dangers with having a rematch on 2 consecutive pay-per-views is that (a) the matches may be too similar & (b) the sequel may not live up to the original. I believe the WWE did a good job in combatting the former danger by making this more a technical match, as compared to the more spotty WrestleMania 20 bout. But I don't think the actual quality of this match could compare. I've said many times that triple-threat matches have inherent problems, and it was never more evident than here. It was clear right from the beginning that this should have been a singles match. Triple H received a nothing crowd reaction for the majority of the bout, as the focus was clearly on HBK & Benoit. It took a clever Earl Hebner appearance to even fully get the crowd involved to the extent they should have been in the first place!!!. I'm focusing too much on the negatives though, as in isolation this was still a very enjoyable & well-performed match. Thirty minutes was a fitting duration, but I have to admit that at times, I thought the match dragged a little. A tough match to rate. Match Rating...8

PPV RATING (50/80) = 63

Looking at the key, I have basically given 'Baklash' a 'C+' grade & said that it was 'worth a watch'. While I think that's about correct, I think my ratings system may have been a little too tough in this case. I think it was a little better than a C+ grade. In fact, if you take out the tag-team match that was only included at the last minute, the ppv rates a 'B'. So fast-forward over Eugene running the ropes & the ppv will appear a lot better!!! I thought the event was very even across the whole card & there was only the one failure of a match. While neither of the main events even remotely got near a 10 out of 10 rating, they were both sufficient & did their jobs well enough. I think that the 2004 installment of Backlash is definitely worth a watch & possibly the best Backlash pay-per-view ever.",1114732800,,7744,4.551724137931035

WWE Backlash Results

Lightning in a bottle... a great opening package for Backlash detailing the three competitors in tonight's main event opens the show. The event's seizure inducing flashing lights take over as the announcers hype the homecoming of Chris Benoit, Heavyweight Champion.

Shelton Benjamin versus Ric Flair

Shelton smiled brightly as he watched Flair enter, and he looked to really enjoy taking on the man on Pay-Per-View. No one has said it, but Flair is in much better shape lately. His pecks are still lacking, but his abdominal area is impressive for a man his age. The two men did some show-boating to start the match. Benjamin gave Ric a slap which caused him to flop down. Shelton went for an early splash, only for Flair to duck and Shelton to jump up on the ring ropes impressively. The match went outside, where a back body drop left Benjamin in charge. In the ring, Flair gained an advantage, but made a big mistake by going to the top rope. Suddenly, something amazing would happen. The screen would flash ""SAP Difficulties."" Oh my God! Flair began working the leg, but was showing pain in his back. Ric locked in a figure four leg lock, which was escaped traditionally with a roll over. Still, Flair was in control. He went for a chair but the referee took it away, and Shelton had a come back. He hit an enziguri and both men were down. Shelton Irish whipped Flair outside the ring, and took him back in with a vertical suplex. Flair had a brief come back, but was still putting on brass knucks in the corner when the All-American hit the inverted Stinger Splash and a flying clothesline off the top rope for the victory. This match was technically well done, but had no energy. The dull crowd (rare for Canadian fans) didn't help matters. **

Orton was interviewed backstage about Shelton's victory over Flair being a bad omen for Evolution. He reminded everyone that he was also on a winning streak - the longest running Intercontinental Champion in seven years. He promised to retire Mick Foley, or Cactus Jack, permanently. Randy said he wasn't scared of what Mick was going to do to him tonight because he was going to put him down like an old dog.

Jonathon Coachman versus Tajiri

Coach came out in a ridiculous looking basketball outfit. He surprised Tajiri with an arm drag, and then played the fox. What other recapper can make The Most Dangerous Game references? He dodged around the ring, avoiding Tajiri's kicks, until the Japanese Buzz Saw accidentally kicked the ring post. He then began working over the leg of Tajiri, much to the surprise of the announcers. A ""Coach sucks"" chant briefly hit the arena, followed by boos. Coach had Tajiri in a submission leg lock and Tajiri used his good leg to kick out of it. Tajiri was still down though, so Coach tried going to the top rope. That was a mistake, knocked him off his feet and onto his crotch. Put in the ""Tree of Woe"" Tajiri used his good leg to dropkick the back of Jonathon's head. From here it was all Tajiri. He handspring elbow and a few types of kicks. Coachman tried cheap pin with his feet on the ropes, but the referee saw. Tajiri locked on the Tarantula and was setting up his finisher roundhouse - when Garrison Cade ran in. He attacked Tajiri while the official was not looking, allowing for a roll up upset. *

Triple H was shown entering the arena. The long-running storyline of Christian, Jericho and Trish is detailed in a video package. It featured seizure inducing camera work, where the film was ran at a slow speed for a choppy look. This show is becoming painful to watch.

Christian and Trish Stratus versus Chris Jericho

The crowd woke up for Jericho and to chant ""Slut."" Chris tried to get his hands on Trish but she ran. He had a few vertical suplexes for Christian. He went for Trish, so the CLB ran at him - and right out of the ring. A springboard drop kick knocked Christian out again. Jericho followed, and Trish ran again when he got close. A few near falls, and Jericho was running the ropes and knocked Ms. Stratus off the apron. This distracted him so Christian could take control. He worked Chris over a bit, and then tagged in Trish. While Jericho was held she slapped him around a bit. When Jericho started getting up she darted to tag her man back in. Jericho started a comeback, ready to slingshot Christian into the corner, but was kicked away. When he fell forward, however, he head butted Christian in the ground. Now Chris was firmly in control. Christian tried a Scorpion Death Drop (I think that is what it was called) and Jericho reversed it to a Northern Lights suplex. Back and forth action and Trish was trying to interject into it when Jericho was whipped into their corner. Still Jericho was on top of most of the offense, so she came in. Jericho threw Christian out of the ring and spanked the Diva. Christian came from behind to hit the unprettier, but when tagged in Trish couldn't get the pin. Now Jericho was fighting both of the pair almost constantly - to good success. A missed lionsault left him in the Texas Clover Leaf, which Chris reversed into the Walls. Trish came in, so he put her in the Walls. Christian tried rolling her up for a pin fall, but Jericho escaped and set Christian up for yet another Walls. Instead of applying it, however, he sling shot him into Trish in the corner and rolled Christian up off the reversal. Great action that was a bit too hectic to tell a cohesive story. **

Backstage, Eugene read WWE Divas magazine, and wandered into the women's locker room. He tried to get her to sign his magazine and she screamed. Molly came in, and Eugene screamed over her bald head. She grabbed her wig and also began scream. William Regal ran in, pulling the very special young man away. A very short advertisement for Smackdown! aired. A video package of Chris Benoit in his hometown and career is shown. He was shown at various places, greeting crowds of fans and talking about the honor it is for today to be Chris Benoit day. He arrived backstage to an ovation, and his family was shown in the crowd.

Women's Championship Match: Victoria versus Lita

Lita was wearing a very nice lime green fishnet top. This match resembled a lot of ECW women's matches, with more near falls and reversals than actual moves. Every move, from a standing moonsault and vertical suplex (Both by Victoria) led directly into a pinning combination. Lita was placed in one of my absolute favorite submissions, the surfboard. She ten had a comeback while put in place for a Samoan drop by hitting a head scissors. More pinning combinations, before a sleeper was applied. Victoria had a comeback, and went for a moonsault off the top on Lita. Lita rolled towards the ring, and the women's Champion face landed on Litas back and legs mostly. I wasn't sure who in psychology who should have been hurt, but Lita played like it didn't affect her so I suppose Victoria. Out of no where (No build up, I blinked during whatever finisher was used) Victoria scored the pin fall. * After the match, Molly and Gail Kim ran down and attacked the pair.

A video package for Randy Orton and Mick Foley's feud was shown. The highlight was, once again, Foley's interview playing over the video clips.

Hardcore Rules Intercontinental Championship Match: Randy Orton versus Cactus Jack/Mick Foley

Randy Orton came down wearing a shirt (Smart man) with the golden pyrotechnics of Evolution and a trash can filled with weapons. He had his own 2X4 covered in barbed wire, which was badly wound. Cactus Jack ran down with Barbie, and immediately went to use her on Orton. Randy used the trashcan to block and ran to the outside. He used a drop toe hold into the ring steps to disarm Foley, and the two fought over the bat. Foley got the upper hand, but was only able to use the ruined trashcan on Orton. He through Orton into the ring, and used some more traditional offense on the Champion. He took Orton back outside and hit a swinging neck breaker. Foley went to the ring post, but Orton crawled away before he could do anything. Cactus followed, and ate a belly to back suplex on the steel ramp. Orton tried a few pinning combinations, and threw Foley's head back into the ramp again. Back to the ring, Orton tried to gouge Foley's face with Barbie, but he ate a leg in the crotch before he could. Cactus brought out Mr. Socko, but then grabbed Barbie. He asked the crowd which to use, and they wanted Barbie. He ran it into the champion's face, and he was bleeding. Cactus Jack worked the face as the blood flowed, bang bang. He ground the bat over Randy's face to the crowd's delight. Then, he leg dropped it into Orton's crotch. I hope that is gimmicked barbed wire. Jack went under the ring and grabbed a tank of gasoline and poured it over Barbie. Bishoff ran down, and announced that if he lit that bat the fire marshal would shut the show down. He relented, but went under the ring for something else: a plank of wood covered in razor wire. Orton (Who had lost his shirt by now) threw powder into Jack's eyes before he could be propelled into it though, and Mick was the one who took the sick bump. That only got a two count, so Randy set it up in the corner. Mick fought the Irish whip, and eventually reversed it - only for it to be reversed again. Foley hung from the wire, with his arm bleeding. Orton went into a box he had brought into the ring, and produced a bag. What was in the? Thumb tacks. He poured them over the ring, but his RKO was ducked and he ended up with a back full of them. That was a very, very sick visual. Orton looked like a pin cushion, bleeding from a hundred tiny holes. He kicked out of a pin and ran to the back. Foley gave chase, and brought him back to the stage. Foley threw Randy off of the stage through a few tables. Bang bang... Jesus Christ. The EMTs began checking out the champion, and Jack posed atop the stage. The officials tried to keep Foley away, but he wouldn't relent. He jumped off the stage and delivered a flying elbow drop. He covered Randy, and somehow the Champion got his shoulder up. So Cactus Jack took the bloody Orton back to the ring. Mind you, the ring was still covered in thumb tacks, so every move caused both men to at least land on a few of them. He nailed a double under hook DDT for yet another two-count. Foley set the razor-wire plank up in the corner again, but somehow Orton went off to attack again. He repeated nailed Foley with Barbie, but ran into Mr. Socko whom had been recovered. Orton fought out of two mandible claws, and hit the RKO out of no where. That wasn't enough to pin Foley, so he delivered a second right onto Barbie. Finally, Mick stayed down. It was a hardcore match, and shall be graded as such - a hell of one at that. **** Evolution came down to carry Orton away.

WWE Fanatic Series: The Stone Cold Truth. Well, that is ironic. The announcers talked about Orton's impressive victory. Backstage, Evolution carried Orton away by his arm pits, and Triple H appeared to tell him he went from being Legend Killer to a Legend. Orton was barely conscious. Triple H was then interviewed, and it made it known he would win the Heavyweight Championship.

La Resistance versus Hurricane and Rosey

The crowd was dead for this one, which is why it was on of course. Seriously, you could have heard a pin drop in the arena. Mid way through the match I was not paying attention to, Eugene came down and began playing with La Resistance's flag. Eugene ran into the ring and began running the ropes madly. Meanwhile, there was a match going on. Somewhere in Eugene's antics Hurricane scored the pin fall. *

A quick run down of Edge's ""Feud"" with Kane is shown.

Kane versus Edge

Johnny Nitro was not introduced as the special guest referee, which I was under the impression would be the case. JR pondered whether or not there was an athlete in the upcoming NFL draft that was comparable to Kane. I wonder what that was in reference to. Edge was on offense early on, taking the action to the Big Red Machine. Edge took Kane outside and removed the monitors from the Spanish announce table, but had his broken hand slammed into the ring steps before he could make any use of that. Back and forth the match went, with little to no psychology. Both men tried their finishers, with the official Earl Hebner getting thrown from the ring. Edge clocked Kane with his cast and scored the pin. *1/2

A video package set up the main event.

Heavyweight Championship Match: Triple H versus Shawn Michaels versus Chris Benoit

Benoit got a big ovation, especially when he posed with his belt right in Hunter's face. The match began, and both Michaels and Benoit teamed up initially to take Hunter out of the ring. Of course, that pairing quickly ended, and HBK and Chris were dueling with one another. The match hit a quick formula; two men would wrestle after one man was thrown to the outside. A ""You screwed Bret"" chant erupted when Shawn was squaring off with Hunter. Benoit came back in the ring, and cleared house with suplexes and chops for everyone. He threw Shawn to the outside of the ring Flair style and locked Hunter in the Crippler Cross face, but it didn't last. Chris went outside to deal with a recovering Shawn, throwing him into the guard rail repeatedly. Hunter gained control and had set Benoit up for a Superplex, but Shawn ran in and tossed Benoit over the top to the outside. Hunter was given and electric chair off the ropes. Both challengers knocked one another down, and Benoit came off the top with a Dynamite head butt. Hunter broke up the pin, because HBK was out. Hunter was taken outside, and HBK was left with Benoit. Michaels tried a flying clothesline but hit the official instead of the Champion, and now the referee was unconscious outside the ring. Hunter wanted to pedigree Benoit, but it was reversed into the Sharpshooter for a huge pop. HBK tried to clothesline Benoit out of it, but that was reversed into the cross face. Still no referee, so Benoit went to try and revive the official. When he went back in, Shawn put Benoit into the Sharpshooter to a huge round of Boos. A new referee ran down, and it was Earl Hebner. Everyone in Canada was holding their breath for that one. Hunter blissfully broke up the hold. Another ""You screwed Bret"" chant, but I cannot tell who it was directed at this time. All three men fought in the ring now, and the crowd was 100% behind Benoit during it all. Benoit and Hunter was fighting each other in front of the Spanish announce table, and HBK went for a cross body off the top rope. Unfortunately for him, both men moved out of the way and he crashed through the table alone. How is that for SAP difficulties? Now, Triple H and Benoit were together in the ring and the Game was firmly in control. He threw Benoit into the ring post, and dragged the champion around to punish him slowly. He put the Champion in the camel clutch in the center of the ring. More punishment was inflicted upon Benoit by the Game, but it was all countered suddenly when the Champion hit the three German suplexes in a row. The Dynamite Head butt was signaled, by Triple H moved out of the way. Now all three men were down. HHH delivered the pedigree, but was slow to grab the pin. Too slow I guess, as Michaels had finally recovered to stop the pin. Michaels and Hunter squared off in the center, with stiff blows for one another. All three men were down on the ground, and HBK kipped up. He gave Hunter the flying elbow off the top onto HHH, and called for Sweet Chin Music. The crowd booed it. Instead of delivering the super kick to Hunter, however, he gave it to Benoit. Hunter delivered a low blow to stop Shawn's momentum. He tried to pedigree HBK, but got back body dropped outside the ring for his troubles. What did Hunter find under that ring on the outside you ask? He found the sledge hammer, of course. He nailed Shawn Michaels right in the center of his back while he was trying to pulling Benoit in. Hunter readied another blow, but was pulled out by the Champion. Hunter attacked Benoit, and set up the ring steps to pedigree Benoit onto them. The Champion fought out, however, and used a slingshot to toss Hunter into the ring post and into the crowd. Back in the ring, Shawn was tuning up the band, but the kick was caught. Benoit tossed him down, and put the Heartbreak Kid into the Sharpshooter. He strained for the ropes to no avail, and the Game tried unsuccessfully to crawl in to break up the hold. With no chance of escape and in excruciating pain, Shawn Michaels tapped out to the Sharpshooter. ****1/2

Johnathan Coachman VS Tajiri

This match was basically useless. Kinda nice to see Coach get beat up. The Garrison Cade interference was useless AND random. *

Handicap Match

Chris Jericho vs. Christian & Trish Stratus

This match wasn't that bad. Chris Jericho had his run-ins with both of his opponenets. Still not as good as WrestleMania XX.  Funny spot is when Chris Jericho hits a clothesline on Trish that came out of nowhere.  ** 1/2

This match was ok. As much as I love Lita she needed improvement for this one. Still it wasn't THAT bad of a women's match. **

No Holds Barred Match

Randy Orton VS Mick Foley

This match was great. As much as I don't like Orton he put on a great match. Foley was great. It was nice to see Foley dishing out the pain for a change. Good spot is where Foley reverses an RKO attempt from Orton and throws him onto the tacks! **** 1/2

Hurricane Helms & Rosey VS Sylvan Grenier & Rob Conway

The only thing that saved this match was Eugene Dinsmore. Eugene is mad funny. A spot is where he runs back and forth in the ring while the match is going on as William Regal tries to get him out the ring. Regal eventually gets him out but Eugene runs back. It's mad funny and brought emotion to a dead crowd. ** (Only because of Eugene)

a good match. thought breaking up Benjamin & Haas was a bad idea but Benjamin is awesome on his own. Flair really puts the kid over with the crowd. i predict big things for this kid.

Jonathan Coachman vs Tajiri 3/10

Tajiri was brought to Raw for this? Coach shows a few wrestling moves but Tajiri is holding back. they may as well tied Tajiri's hands behind his back the way he performed. big disappointment! Garrison Cade appears in this one.

this one steals the show. a match of the year candidate. back and forth brutal action with lots of blood and bumps. glad Evolution was banned from ringside.

Sunday Night Heat Match:

Christian vs. Rhyno.  This is a quick 3 minute match and it ends when Tomko and Tajiri come out and Christian gets distracted a turns into a GORE.  Later in the night Christian & Tomko vs. Rhyno & Tajiri.

Winner=Rhyno around 3 minutes.

Backlash:

Jim Ross vs. Khosrow Daivari.  This match never got underway because Hassan attacked JR backstage.

Eugene vs. Edge.  This will be a solid 15 minute battle.  Eugene will hit the Rock Bottom, Stone Cold Stunner & the Hogan leg drop but Edge will keep kicking out.  Eugene is clapping to the crowd and turns right into a Spear from Edge.

Winner=Edge around 15 minutes.

Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit in a WrestleMania rematch.  This will be a 25 minute battle like WrestleMania.  It will not be as good as WrestleMania but this time Benoit taps out to The Walls of Jericho.

Winner=Chris Jericho around 25 minutes.

Trish Stratus vs. Victoria for the Women's Championship.  The reason only Victoria is facing Trish because Lita got suspended for beating up Trish.  This match ends when Trish hits the Stratusfaction.  Lita attacks Trish at the end.  It goes about 8:00.

Winner=Trish at 8 minutes.

Shelton Benjamin vs. Maven for the Intercontinental Championship in a No DQ match.  This match goes about 19 minutes and it ends when Benjamin hit a T-Bone suplex onto a chair for the 3.

Winner=Shelton Benjamin at 19 minutes.

Christian & Tyson Tomko vs. Rhyno & Tajiri.  This was a okay match and it ends at 7 minutes when Tomko pinned Rhyno after an Inverted spinning neckbreaker.

Winners=Christian & Tomko at 7 minutes.

Shawn Michaels vs. The Rock.  This was the best match of the night.  NO DOUBT!!!!  Once again a complicated ending.  HBK tunes up the band but The Rock gets a Lead Pipe and hits HBK with it.  Edge comes down and Spears.....The Rock!?!?  When The Rock gets up he pinnes HBK because he was still out after the Lead pipe shot.

Winner=The Rock at 40 minutes.

Batista vs. Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship w/ Randy Orton as Special Rules Enforcer in an Ironman Match.  This was not the greatest Iron Man match ever but it was good.  Pinfalls:

1st Fall: Batista pinned Triple H at 9:34 after a Sit-Down PowerBomb.

2nd Fall: Triple H pinned Batista at 29:35 after a Pedigree.

3rd Fall: Triple H pinned Batista at 45:56 after a chair shot.

Shelton Benjamin v. Ric Flair

  This match had very intense action between 2 rivals.  Shelton is a great wrestler.  Benjamin wins. 6/10

Coach v. Tajiri

  This match was also very intense.  Tajiri and Coach actually have a good match.  Coach wins for some weird reason. 6/10

Chris Jericho v. Christian & Trish Stratus

  This match was very boring.  It's nothing Jericho hasn't done before.  Christian & Trish just don't mix especially when Jericho beats their asses. 4/10

Victoria v. Lita  Women's Title

  This match was very entertaining in the beginning but it got really boring near the ending of this match.  Victoria retains which sets up Bad Blood. 4/10

Randy Orton v. Mick Foley  IC Title  NO DQ

  This match was very brutal and bloody.  Foley makes the match that Evolution can't interfere.  Orton stills win even with 50 tacks in his back. 9/10

La Resistance v. Hurricane & Rosey

  This match isn't as bad as people say it is.  Hurricane & Rosey have a good match and win. 4/10

Edge v. Kane

  This is where Edge makes his return to the WWE.  He should have faced somebody like Batista not Kane.  Edge wins in his return. 8/10

Chris Benoit v. Shawn Michaels v. Triple H  World Title

Shelton Benjamin def. Ric Flair 6/10

This was a solid opener, nothing too special and nothing too awful. Benjamin is a good young talent and put on a great match here and Flair is past his time and all he knows how to do is chop. Benjamin wins this match at the 8 minute mark with a top rope clothesline.

Coach def. Tajiri 4/10

This match was better than what I expected but was still not great. Coach can actually wrestle, he really suprised me. Tajiri used some good offence in this match but was beaten by Coach after Garrison Cade interfered.

Chris Jericho def. Christian/Trish Stratus 8/10

Another exellent match from Jericho and Christian. Trish didn't really do much in this match exept covering Jericho after he was beaten down by Christian. I liked the moves used by both men in this match and they have a great chemistery together. Y2J picked up the win in this match at around the 15 minute mark.

Womans Championship-Victoria def. Lita 5/10

Womans wrestling has really improved over the years. This was actually a good 6-7 minute match with lots of back and fourth action. Lita is in great shape and Victoria is the best womans wrestler around in my veiw. Victoria retained the title at the 7 minute mark with a small package roll up.

Intercontinental Title-Randy Orton def. Mick Foley 9/10

WHAT A HARDCORE MATCH. This was the equal match of the night with the triple threat match. Lots of weapons were used by both men and it was a bloody match. Orton got thrown off the stage through a table, thrown into a barb wire board and slammed in thumbtacks while Cactus Jack took loads of bumps and got the RKO on to a barb wire bat(barbie). Randy Orton retained the Intercontinental title at the 21 minute mark with an RKO on the barb wire bat.

La Resistance vs. Hurricane/Rosey 2/10

Basicly a filler with no build up and no title on the line. I forgot who won it and that shows how good it was.

Edge def. Kane 5/10

A very average match match which should have been way better. It was only 6 minutes long and didn't get going until the end. Edge is one of my favourite wrestlers and I was happy to see him return but this match wasn't one of his best. Edge completes his comeback at the 6 minute mark with a spear on the monster Kane.

WHW Title-Chris Benoit vs. Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels 9/10

An exellent match between three superstars of wrestling. It was not as good as their match at Wrestlemania 20 but was still a classic encounter. This was a straight out wrestling match and never got dull. I rated this match 9/10 because it wasn't as good as their 10/10 WM classic. Chris Benoit retains in his home town after making Michaels tap to the sharpshooter at around the 30 minute mark.

Overall an exellent Raw ppv which scored a 48/80. The score was lowered from the Tag match and Coach vs. Tajiri so the score is not as bad as it looks. RATING SCALE-60",1099008000,2,3099,4.444247787610619
2021472,5,B0001OGVRG,"Great PPV.  It has been one of the best so far this year.  Backlash 2004 features two of the best matches of the year so far.  It marks one of the biggest rematches in history.

1. Shelton Bejamin vs. Ric Flair

This match came about because of the rise of Benjamin, who had pulled off two upsets over Triple H.  Decent match.  A good way to kick off the show.  Anytime you get Flair in a match, it is going to be fun.  Decent performance by Benjami, although it was sloppy at times.  (7.5/10)

2. Tajiri vs. Coach

This was surprisingly a good match.  Coach did a good job and took a good bump in the corner when Tajiri kicked him in the face after he was hanging from the ropes. Garrison Cade makes an appearance. Not bad.  (7/10)

3. Christian & Trish Stratus vs. Chris Jericho

They should have just had a rematch between Christian and Y2J.  I understand why they had the match, but come on.  Nothing good really happens.  (6.5/10)

4. Victoria vs. Lita (Women's Championship)

I hate women's matches, but this one wasn't that bad.  Good performance by both women.  (6/10)

5. Cactus Jack vs. Randy Orton (Intercontinental Title/Hardcore Rules)

Wow!  What a brutal match.  Orton really proves himself as a top notch competitor in the match.  There are two amazing spots in the match.  Cactus throws Orton off the entrance ramp and through a table and proceeds to elbow drop him off the ramp.  The best spot is when Orton goes to RKO Jack into a pile of tack, but Foley reverses it and throws Orton back first into the tacks.  Amazing.  The tacks are everywher in Orton's body.  I don't know how he did this without getting too hurt.  It is one of the craziest spots you will ever see.  There is everything in this match.  Two-by-Four wrapped in barbed wire, gas cans, boards filled with barbed wire.  Absolutely brutal.  Very abrupt ending.  (9.5/10)

5. La Resistance vs. Hurricane & Rosey

Talk about a card filler.  Nobody cared at all about this one.  (3/10)

6. Kane vs. Edge

This was Edge's in ring return in the WWE.  He was very rusty.  Very slow and sloppy match.  (5/10)

7. Chris Benoit vs. Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels (World Heavyweight Title/Triple Threat)

This was a rematch from the Wrestlemania 20 main event.  Not as fast paced as the rematch, but still good.  It is a very technical match.  Good spot when Michaels attempts to deliver an elbow off the top rop onto the announce table, but misses and crashes through it.  Another very exciting ending.  (9/10)

Great PPV.  Definately pick it up for the Intercontinental Title match and the World Heavyweight match.

2021473,4,B0001OGVRG,"Backlash 2004 was good just for the main event and the unforgettable Street Fight between a legend and a rising star. Mick Foley returned to a hardcore match after more than 4 years away from his last one. This was a wild brawl that was off the hook....

Shelton Benjamin vs. Ric Flair: This was an okay opener, and Benjamin proves that he is also the future of the wwe. The crowd was into this one and some good moves by Benjamin makes this an okay opener.  8/10

Women's Championship: Wow, did you see Lita's outfit? These two are the best women's wrestlers in the entire company in my opinion and this was a great women's title match. The ending is kinda bad when Molly Holly and Gail Kim attack both women, but you can skip that part anytime you want.  8/10

Edge vs. Kane: I wish Edge could return to a better match, but unfortunately he is stuck in a less than ten minute match with Kane. This is okay, but definately not the best. 7/10

Rosey and the Hurricane vs. La Resistance: This is something you would see in the middle of a Raw episode. Eugene comes down to the ring and runs around and around, and finally wakes the crowd up. Still a bad match. 6/10

Tajiri vs. The Coach: Ahh, this is bad also. Tajiri is good, but Coach is just embarrassing himself. The ending sucked too because this new boy, Cade, comes down to the ring and allows Coach to win. This is just a card filler and doesn't even live up to that. 6/10

Jericho vs. Christian and Trish Stratus: This was a good match, and it also has lots of funny moments in it. Trish is hot, but why is she with Christian? She is much better off if she went with Jericho. Oh well, this is still a good match. 8/10

Randy Orton vs. Cactus Jack: Best match of the night, and if this is not a best match of the year candidate, then we have all been cheated again. Anything was used in this one; Barbed wire bats, thumbtacks, tables, trashcans, powder, cookie sheets, a huge board wrapped in barb wire, and Mr. Soko was used in this match. Randy Orton does something even Mick Foley didn't do and fell on tacks without a shirt on! The crowd was really into this one and it shows in lots of moments in this match. Mick is great as usual and Randy shows why he is the future of the WWE. A great hardcore match. 20/10

Final Encounter Match: This was a good match too, but not as good as the WM match, as you all have heard countless times before. The crowd was great and obviously were in Benoit's corner the entire match. Some great intense moments in this one, yet there are also some slow moments as well. Benoit proves he is For Real! A great match, but not perfect. 9/10

Backlash is great just for the last two matches I listed. You DEFINATELY have to see the Street Fight, and it is also good to see the Final Encounter match. So buy this now.",1094083200,2,2807,4.237827715355805

But back to the match that YOU NEED TO WATCH. Randy Orton and Mick Foley put on a show that would make some of those lunatic wrestlers in Japan blush. Nothing was overdone or overly violent in this one. Foley put over a kid that is the real NEXT BIG THING. While the last guy with that title ran off to play to play football, Orton proved in this match that he will do anything for this business. Not only did he land flat on countless thumbtacks, but he wasn't wearing a shirt either!!!

Ive never seen a guy do that over here. Foley did an incredible job and proved that he still had that psychotic side to him, but Orton used this as his coming out party. When people start talking about how great of a wrestler he is and how he started to be recognized as a legend, this is the match everyone will look back on",1090540800,2,1087,4.221153846153846

2021482,4,B0001OGVRG,"I watched this ppv as soon as it came out on dvd and it was a very good wwe ppv. Everyone says No Way Out was better but it only had a couple of good matches. I think Backlash was and still is way better because of good matches throughout the event. By the way RAW is way better than SD but I like ppv,s better when they are presented by both brands. Here are the matches and how I rated them. 1 star-awful
  2 stars-okay
  3 stars-Average
  4 stars-good
  5 stars-Classic
Ric Flair vs Shelton Benjamin- Okay opener because of some great moves by Shelton but why is Flair still wrestling. I respect Ric alot but he is too old and is not ppv material now.
Benjamin carried this match and did a good job. It was just the right length and Shelton Benjamin wins. 3 stars
Coach vs Tajiri- I was very suprised when Coach used those wrestling moves, I didn't know Coach could wrestle. This still wasn't great but was still coaches best match by far. Tajiri really does nothing but kicks which can get a bit boring. Coach wins by using the schoolboy roll up after an interference by Garison Cade. 2 stars
Chris Jericho vs Christian and Trish-I thought this would be crap because we have seen Jericho vs Christian too many times but it was quite amusing. There was some great moves used by Y2J and he did well by himself. Trish did hardly nothing and finally got what she deserved, a spanking by Chris Jericho. The action was a good pace and the match was 15 minutes long which made it one of the better matches on this ppv. Y2J wins after and insuguree or what ever you call it to Christian. 4 stars
Victoria vs Lita-Don't listen too anyone who says this match was bad. It is still way behind the men but is the best womans match I have seen since Wrestlemania 19. Lita is high flying and Victoria is a great mat wrestler. This also had some great moves and rarely for a womans match was 7 or 8 minutes long. Victoria wins with an indide cradle. The bad part was the ending,I hate it when matches are just suddenly over from roll ups and cradles. 3 stars
Mick Foley vs Randy Orton-WHAT A HARDCORE STREET FIGHT. It had everything we don't normally see such as barb wire, tables and thumb tacks. I loved it when Orton got thrown on to the barb wire board,got thrown of the stage through stacked tables and got slammed on thumb tacks. Mandkind also took alot of hits on the barb wire. Mankind dominated Orton but got beaten at the end with 2 R.K.O's, the second on the barb wire bat. Exellent effort by these 2 men.  5 stars
La Resistance vs Hurricane and Rosey-FILLER and should have been on RAW if they needed this match. 1 star
Edge vs Kane-BORING!!! this was a snoozefest and I expected it to be alot better. It was only 6 minutes long and was dull until Edge hit Kane with the spear. It was too obvious Edge was going to win the match after his comeback. If they were going to make the match like this why wasn't it lower on the card. Skip this match or have a toilet break. 1 star
Chris Benoit vs HBK vs Triple H-Same match as wrestlemania and I didn't really wan't to see it again but it turned out good. It would have been much better Benoit vs Michaels at this ppv though. Wrestlemania was a bit better but this one was 5 minutes longer and had some good spots. Again too obvious Benoit was going too win because of these 2 reasons
*The match was in Benoits home time
*Benoit would keep the title for more than a month after those  celebrations
Overall a good main event that got he crown going because of Benoit. 4 stars

2. Tajiri vs Jonathan Coachman 4/10 I didn't like this match at all but I mean it was funny seeing Coach getting beat up, but like always somebody cough Garrison Cade cough has to interfere.
3. Chris Jericho vs Christian & Trish Stratus 5.5/10 The match was alright not as good as Jericho's and Christian's Wrestlemania match though but im glad Y2J got some revenge.
4. Victoria vs Lita (Women's Championship)6/10 I like this match up it was a good solid matchup with 2 great athletes. But Molly Holly and Gail Kim messed it up after Victoria won
5. Randy Orton vs Cactus Jack (Intercontinental Championship Hardcore Rules) 10/10 I loved this match.  It was awesome Cactus took some real hard shots in this but Randy Orton got his beating like he deserved.  But overall I think Randy Orton proved he was a hardcore legend.
6. La Resistance vs Hurrican & Rosey 5/10 And alright match but I think it should have been on RAW stead of a Pay Per View.
7. Edge vs Kane 4/10 I was glad to see Edge return but this match wasn't that good.  Edge did alright but he had a cast on so it was a boring 6 minute match seeing a guy with a cast getting beat up but thank the lord Edge won.

Bad bad match. Coach is not an entertainer. Not in the ring, not on the mic, not at the annoucers table, not at all.

No Holds Barred - Randy Orton def. Cactus Jack

WOW! Orton should thank his lucky stars that it was him because Foley put him over clean, cata-pulting him right to the top of the WWE. The match itself was just an awsome brawl. When Orton pulled out those thunbtacks I did not think it would be him taking the bump on them. Orton tries to escape, but Foley throws him off the stage through a couple of tables. Orton finishes the match. Two RKO's get the biggest win of Orton's young career. Definite show-stealer. F'in WOW!

Match Rating - *****

Hurricane & Rosey def. La Resistance

Good match if you needed to hit the can or get a beer. Not much of a match, and you know it's just been thrown in to kill some time when Eugene (is this RAW's Zach Gowen, did RAW really need a side show freak?) jumps in the ring and just runs around like an idiot for a couple of minutes.

Match Rating -

Edge def. Kane

A six minute match for a 14-month return for Edge. Kane should have one and would have if it was not for it being Edge's ""big return,"" and needing a push. I don't know about ya'll but I'm fed up with Kane and Big Show being jobers while Benoit and Eddie run around with titles. The crowd was dead for this match until Edge hit the spear at the end. The match itself was not good.

Match Rating - *

World Title - Triple Threat

Chris Benoit def. Triple H & Shawn Michaels

The final encounter? Yep, it's probably the last time they'll have a triple threat with these three. This match was very good, not as good as their WrestleMania match though, since I think there was a bit more riding on it for Benoit at Mania. The match went 30 minutes and just seemed a bit flat in some patches. Benoit blocks the Sweet Chin Music and locks in the SharpShooter, getting the submission victory. Benoit celebrates with his hometown with his belt at the end.

4. Victoria pinned Lita to retain the Women's Championship - Lita is pretty bad in the ring and it really shows in this match. *
5. Randy Orton pinned Mick Foley to retain the Intercontinental Championship in a Hardcore Rules Match - off the charts brawl that really shows how passionate both men are about wrestling; Randy Orton is the best thing in the business right now and Foley did a great job putting him over. *****
6. The Hurricane and Rosey defeated La Resistance - this match, just like both teams involved, is crap.
7. Edge pinned Kane - nothing special, but not that bad. **
8. Chris Benoit defeated Shawn Michaels and Triple H in a Triple Threat Match to retain the World Heavyweight Championship when he made HBK tap out to the sharpshooter - yet again these three men put on an unbelievable match; this was not as good as WrestleMania but it sure was close. *****",1083888000,3,1309,4.574468085106383

Shelton Benjammin def. Ric Flair
Good choice for an opener which went about 9 minutes. Back and forth action with Benjammin hitting the top rope clothesline for the win. Benjammin's mega push continues.
Match Rating - **1/2
The Coach def. Tajiri
Wasn't expecting much from the match since Coach was in it, but i was pleasantly surprised. Coach shouldn't be wrestling however, so i guess his new ally, Garrison Cade, will do the rasslin for him. Coach pulls out the upset with Cade's help.
Match Rating - *1/4
Chris Jericho def. Christian and Trish Stratus
I would have rather just seen Jericho/Christian II, but we get a handicap match here. Match was very solid, with Jericho pinning Christian with the running enziguri.
Match Rating - ***
Womens Championship - Victoria def. Lita
Hated this match. Lita needs to consider a new occupation because she's clearly not cut out to be a proffesional wrestler. Victoria's awsome though, and she (thank god) retains her title here with a cradle.
Match Rating - 1/4*
Intercontinental Championship
No Holds Barred - Randy Orton def. Cactus Jack
WOW! What can i say that probably hasn't already been said. We all new Orton was going to win since the only reason Foley came out of retirement was to put a younger star over. Orton should thank his lucky stars that it was him because Foley put him over clean, cata-pulting him right to the top of the WWE. The match itself was just an awsome brawl. When Orton pulled out those thunbtacks i fully expected Foley to get throw onto them, but i fell out of my seat when Randy got throw onto them, and my hats off to him for continuing the match. Orton tries to escape, but Foley throws him off the stage through a couple of tables. Orton kicks out of all of Foley's covers, making him look that much better. two RKO's get the biggest win of Orton's young career. Definite show-stealer.
Match Rating - *****
Hurricane & Rosey def. La Resistance
Don't bother watching this, especially if your still drained from Orton/Foley. Not much of a match, and you know it's just been thrown in to kill some time when Eugene jumps in the ring and just runs around like an idiot for a couple of minutes.
Match Rating - 1/2*
Edge def. Kane
A six minute match for a 14-month return for Edge. The crowd was dead for this match until Edge hit the spear at the end, probably because they were still amazed by the Orton/Foley match. The match itself was not good, but it'll pass.
Match Rating - *
World Title - Triple Threat
Chris Benoit def. Triple H & Shawn Michaels
The final encounter? Yep, it's probably the last time they'll have a triple threat with these three. This match was very good, not as good as their WrestleMania match though, since it think there was a bit more riding on it for Benoit at Mania. The match went 30 minutes and just seemed a bit flat in some patches, nevertheless, i was very satisfied with what i got. Benoit blocks the Sweet Chin Music and locks in the SharpShooter, getting the submission victory, a moment i'm sure many Canadian fans will never forget. Benoit celebrates with his hometown with his belt at the end, which is a very emotion moment as well.

Okay match, but it was a little dull and the finish was a little unexpected, and not in a good way. *
Tajiri vs. Coach
This was surprisingly decent, but very short and the ending sucked. Cade push = boredom. *
Chris Jericho vs. Christian & Trish
Jericho was really on here, but the match wasn't too long and his opponent was Christian, so the match was just good (and fun) and nothing more. ***
WWE Womens Championship
Victoria (c) vs. Lita
Victoria tried, but Lita is just horrible. *
WWE Intercontinental Championship
Randy Orton (c) vs. Mick Foley
Foley was absolutely fanatastic and Orton tried. Some really cool spots and brutality, but some of the brawling was actually a little dull (like Orton and Foley ""fighting"" over controll of the barbed wire bat), and I didn't get the point of teasing lighting the barbed wire bat. Also, the finish was a little akward and anti-climactic. Still... 4th best match of the year so far. ***
La Ressistance vs. Hurricane & Rosey
Okay, but after Eugene actually got in the ring it got sloppy. *
Edge vs. Kane
Decent match, but it was too short and the finish could have been done better. *
World Heavyweight Championship
Chris Benoit (c) vs. Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels
It was ok, but after a little while it just got very dull and began to drag a lot. Finish was obvious and it's stupid that HBK couldn't hold on a couple more seconds (until Triple H broke up the sharp shooter), since the title is supposed to be the most prestigious thing in the world. **
There's nothing really bad (most of the low ratings are due to shortness of the matches), a couple of fun matches and one really good match in Foley vs. Orton.

8015519,4,B0001OGVRG,"Taking place in Edmonton, Alberta Canada, Backlash was the fallout PPV from Wrestlemania XX and the Lottery Draft that took place the night after Wrestlemania. The main feud heading into the show was hometown favorite, Chris Benoit putting his newly won World Heavyweight Championship on the line against Triple H and Shawn Michaels.

1.) Shelton Benjamin vs Ric Flair

A fun opening match to start off the show. Shelton Benjamin had recently been drafted from Raw to Smackdown in the Lottery Draft and was getting a great push as a babyface with 2 victories over Triple H. Benjamin's push continues with a pinfall victory over Flair, following a flying clothesline from the top turnbuckle

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) The Coach vs Tajiri

An okay match, nothing special. Match starts off as a bore but the crowd starts to get into it towards the end. Coach get the win with outside help from Garrison Cade

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) 2 on 1 Handicap Match: Christian and Trish Stratus vs Chris Jericho

After being betrayed by Trish at Wrestlemania, Jericho was looking to settle the score with Christian and gain a measure of revenge on Trish. Christian and Trish got a great amount of heel heat during their tenure as a couple, probably most in part due to Trish's new slutty gimmick working so effectively. This Battle of Canadians match was great with a lot of nice material shown. Jericho gets a spanking in on Trish and hits an enziguri on the CLB to win the match

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Women's Championship Match: Victoria (c) vs Lita

I don't get why people hate on this match. It wasn't over the top great but it was decent. Between Raw and Smackdown, Raw's Divas Division had more credibility and at the top of the division was Victoria who had become the #1 babyface replacement with Trish's heel turn. Victoria and Lita performed some nice moves that neither had never performed before. Victoria performed a nicely executed Mexican surfboard, while Lita locked in a sleeper hold. Kind of weird to see Lita using a sleeper hold. Victoria gets the win and retains with an inside cradle pin on Lita. Gail Kim and Molly Holly attack Lita and Victoria after the match

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) Hardcore Intercontinental Championship Match: Randy Orton (c) vs Cactus Jack

After Wrestlemania XX, many believed we had seen the last of Mick Foley...and we did. But we witnessed the return of Foley's alter ego, the brutal and sadistic Cactus Jack! Foley says this is one of his greatest matches in his career and for good reason. Orton and Foley bring nice action to this match and things get really brutal. Orton bleeds and in probably the most memorable moment of this match, HE gets thrown on the thumbtacks. That was probably the first time in Mick Foley's career that his opponent got thrown on the thumbtacks. Orton get the win with an RKO on a barbed wire baseball bat for the win. One of the best matches from both mens' careers!

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Rosey and Hurricane vs La Resistance

A boring but quick match. Rosey and Hurricane get the win after Hurricane performs the Eye of the Hurricane. This is a match that should've happened on Sunday Night Heat and not a PPV

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) Edge vs Kane

Edge had recently returned and this was his first PPV appearance since the 2003 Royal Rumble and was now part of the Raw brand after being drafted from Smackdown in the Draft Lottery. This was a pretty boring match. Kane and Edge would have better matches with each other the following year but here; they just didn't mesh well. Edge had ring rust and there was nothing Kane could do about it. Edge wins with a spear

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) Triple Threat World Heavyweight Championship Match: Triple H vs Shawn Michaels vs Chris Benoit (c)

In this epic Wrestlemania rematch, hometown hero, Chris Benoit put his World Title on the line against the man he won it from, Triple H, and Shawn Michaels. All 3 men pull out the stops in this match and make it one of the best PPV rematches in history. Lots of Benoit and You Screwed Bret chants throughout the bout. At Wrestlemania, Benoit made Triple H tap to the Crossface but here, Benoit makes Michaels tap out to the Sharpshooter to retain in this awesome Wrestlemania rematch main event

Overall: A decent post-Wrestlemnia PPV with only a few slow drag matches",1398038400,,4915,5.557640750670242

I bought this for the main event. HHH, Benoit, and HBK did not have a letdown following their tremendous match at Wrestlemania X-7. I've never been a fan of Randy Orton, but his match with Cactus Jack was brutal. He definitely ""paid his dues"" in this match.
