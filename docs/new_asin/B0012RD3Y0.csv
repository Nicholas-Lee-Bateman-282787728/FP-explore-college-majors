He first realizes this when the new girl at school comes to live at his house with him and his 3 sisters. Ayumi, the new girl, is a witch. His 3 sisters are witches as well. They have been keeping many secrets from him. Ayumi has come to try to get him to lift a curse on her. That's pretty much the story line.

This anime is a lot of fun. It's short(13 episodes), but a series of this caliber doesn't really need more than that. This is a typical harem/ecchi series. 1 guy, half-a-dozen cute girls. It's mainly focused on the comedy aspect. There is a story line, but it really isn't important, and it doesn't get going till the end. Even without a good story, the comedy and fun characters make this s reasonably enjoyable series to watch once or twice. I have seen plenty of better harem anime series, but Magikano is fun and worth the few bucks it costs.",1354665600,,957,4.258241758241758
8247414,3,B0012RD3Y0,"I'm not sorry that I watched this series. I will say that after these last episodes I'm not sorry to see it go and that if I had known it was going to end like this I probably wouldn't have let myself get emotionally invested in the characters. For what it is, the series is enjoyable for almost the entire way through before sputtering at the finish line. If you really want to know how it ends, you can watch the last two episodes but I know they won't be getting much replay value from me.",1216598400,2,492,4.135416666666667
