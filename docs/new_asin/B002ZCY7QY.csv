4015028,5,B002ZCY7QY,"i found out about Chuck through mindlessly trauling through the tv shows available in itunes australia. i read a couple of the reviews, took a punt with my hard earned 3 bob & bought the 1st 3 episodes including the pilot. i don't buy dvds of tv shows but i made an exception with Chuck after watching said 3 episodes & have not regretted it in the slightest, especially as you need to have cable to watch Chuck here in sydney.

put simply, it is the best bloody thing on the box & i watch a lot of box. my reasons are threefold: great ensemble cast who play well thought out characters, superb story lines with just enough plot twists to keep viewers on the edge of their seats but not alienate new fans &, above all, the perfect combination of action, drama & comedy. yes, folks, i've turned into a Chuckoholic...it's just that good.

i've had to make do with watching season 3 on-line like many fans outside the US & can happily say the show's producers, josh schwartz & chris fedak, have taken it to a new level. all our favourites are back along with some new ones, both good & evil or possibly both.

i just hope nbc give them the thumbs up for a 4th season. if not, i'll happily don my 'save chuck' singlet all over again...",1271203200,72,1231,4.297413793103448
4015029,4,B002ZCY7QY,"Yeah!  It is about time! Last nights episode was awesome! I am so glad Morgan knows about Chuck. Now if they could just put Chuck and Sarah back together and ditch superman, I will be in heaven! Good job writers now keep it up!",1268092800,,227,4.159090909090909
4015030,2,B002ZCY7QY,"This episode made no sense! Why are they trying to make Chuck something he's not! Why are they trying to hook Sarah up with superman? He sucked as superman, what makes them think he would make a good spy? It looks like they are getting rid of the girl from smallville. Thank God!!! Come on people, get it together or I AM OUT!!!",1267488000,,328,4.222222222222222
4015031,5,B002ZCY7QY,"Chuck is not only critically acclaimed, it is very entertaining! It is my favorite show currently on and one of my favorites ever. I find that I can enjoy the funny and sweet scenes repeatedly.

I own seasons 1 and 2 in standard definition and have bought season 3 in HD On Demand. All of them look good! HD is somewhat better.

I like it enough that I own it both On Demand and the DVDs for seasons 1 and 2. Sometimes I'll watch a Chuck episode at my computer while I'm waiting for it to finish some number crunching. The Unbox works well.

I also like to watch it from DVD when exercising on my elliptical.

Personally, I'm rooting for Chuck and Sarah to get together.

Right after I wrote this positive review, the wheels seemed to come off the show. The last episode wasn't funny or sweet!",1267315200,,793,4.295302013422819
4015032,3,B002ZCY7QY,I am not feeling season three at all! First of all I hate all the new characters. I hate this new super chuck. I hate the girl from smallville. I hate that Sarah and Chuck are not in love anymore. That was my whole reason for watching the show. The only reason I have purchased the show and gave it three stars is because I have faith that they can turn it around. GET IT TOGETHER PEOPLE OR I AM OUT!!!,1266192000,,402,3.9753086419753085

4015087,2,B002ZCY7QY,"Love Chuck. But ...

My daughter begged me to get The COMPLETE Third Season after we binged watched seasons 1+2 (which were complete). Thinking Season 3 would be the same, I eagerly bought it. However, I agree with other reviewers the quality of the show declined. Further, to add insult to injury, I watched the whole season just to find I had to pay another $3 for the season finale.

4015091,4,B002ZCY7QY,"Edit: I contacted Amazon directly to complain about not having episode 18 included in the complete season and they credited my account the money it costs to buy episode 18.

This rating is not for the show at all, it is entirely for the digital purchase.  The title is ""Chuck: The Complete Third Season"" but yet the season finale (episode 18) is not included in the cost.  You have to pay for that episode separately (an additional $2.99).

For some unknown stupid reason all these writers think it always has to be a love triangle, cant they figure anything new for couples, still at least its funny, smart and entertaining at the same time.",1507766400,,651,4.433333333333334

4015230,5,B002ZCY7QY,Chuck was a great prime time show. I am just sad it got cancelled. It did get a little hard to believe in season 4 but season 5 came about when many of the fans of the show wrote in to the network expressing their feeling of it being cancelled after season 4. Season 5 came about from that then it was cancelled. Season three was the best season of all.,1494547200,,353,3.9859154929577465

4015554,5,B002ZCY7QY,"With all the TV I watch, there is a clear choice for favorite TV show - Chuck.  Although it was just a bit more serious than the previous seasons, the third season was just as awesome as the first two.

The third season actually picks up a few months after the conclusion of season two.  Chuck Bartowski (Zachary Levi) has just returned to Burbank after some training that will help him use the enhanced features he got by downloading the intersect 2.0 into his brain.  Now, instead of just flashing on information, he can also flash on skills needed like hand to hand fighting or laser avoiding.  However, his emotions make these new upgrades glitchy, so his skills can come and go at the most inopportune times.

Meanwhile, his CIA handler Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski) is back in town to rejoin the team despite the fact that Chuck broke her heart.  NSA handler John Casey (Adam Baldwin) is thrilled that with each new mission, Chuck seems to be becoming a better spy.  Sarah, on the other hand, is watching the man she fell in love with slip away behind the new spy Chuck.

And on the home front?  Chuck's best friend Morgan (Joshua Gomez) and Chuck become roommates.  Chuck's sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) gets a fellowship she wants while Ellie's husband Devon, aka Captain Awesome, (Ryan McPartlin) tries to figure out a way to get Ellie out of the dangerous world that Chuck inhabits.  The gang at the Buy More is still there to provide some comedy.  And we finally learn something that Captain Awesome isn't awesome at.

Underneath all this is a new group out to get the Intersect and steal all the secrets locked away in Chuck's mind.  Can the group bring them down while keeping Chuck's true identity a secret?

Why do I love the show?  Because it finds the right balance between comedy and drama.  The show takes itself seriously enough that we care for the characters and are concerned when they are in danger.  But the characters are just as likely to get out of danger by some crazy coincidence as they are by some great bit of action.  It's that unpredictability and humor that keep me loving every minute.

Plus there are the great characters.  Yes, the Nerds at the Buy More (think a Best Buy clone) are turning into one note characters and losing some of their humor this year.  But the rest of the characters are still very real, deep characters that we truly do care about.  I want to spend time with these guys, and above all, I want to see them happy.  The guest cast rounds out and compliments the great main characters.  Notable guest stars this season include Kristin Kreuk of Smallville, Brandon Routh from Superman Returns, and Scott Bakula.

The show was originally renewed for a thirteen episode third season which was extended to nineteen episodes the rest of NBC's schedule did poorly in the ratings.  As a result, we get two story arcs that are sort of connected.  It's not ideal, but it does work and all the episodes are extremely entertaining.

This show is the perfect marriage of writing and acting.  There are many times where we know exactly what a character is thinking or feeling just by a look on their face.  You can't pull that off without both.  It does help that this is season three, so we know the characters.  But I still maintain that either poor writing or acting would produce laughable results instead of truly touching moments that reveal quite a bit about the characters.

That does bring me back to what I mentioned at the very beginning.  This season was much more serious than the first two.  Don't get me wrong, there were still some great comedic moments.  But they weren't as plentiful as the themes of the year grew more serious.  Some fans didn't like that; I found it to be a very nice maturing that felt right.  If they lighten things up again, I won't complain any, but for this season, it worked.

And I haven't even talked about the stunts yet.  This show is still an action show, and it manages to produce some nice sequences.  They aren't quite feature fill elaborate, but they are quite fun for TV.

All 19 episodes of season three are included in this boxed set.  We don't get any commentaries, but we do get deleted scenes and bloopers.  There's also a featurette with interviews about this season of the show and a mockumentary on Jeffster, the fake band two of the characters have.  It could have more special features, but the episodes themselves more than make up for this lack.

Slightly more serious or not, Chuck is still the best thing on TV right now.  If you haven't watched this show yet, you are in for a real treat.  And if you already like the show, you'll be thrilled to have season three at your fingertips anytime you want it.",1431216000,2,4721,4.568533969010727

4015627,5,B002ZCY7QY,"This season is so great! Chuck stays his nerdy self, still just as lovable as the earlier seasons. When we catch up with him, he's still adjusting to the new intersect, which brings about a lot of funny situations. It's also pretty kick*ss though, and we see Chuck in a whole new way as he kicks the bad guys butts. Beware, there is a new character that many people, including myself, am not a fan of. Shaw enters the show and is pretty sketchy, not to mention that he moves in on Sarah. There is a twist that involves him however, about midway through the season, that actually made me like his character more. (******spoiler******Shaw as a villain made much more sense to me, he always gave me a creepy, weird vibe***********)
3x13 until the season finale are some of my favorite episodes, and the resolution of season three is one of the most satisfying of the entire series to me. Overall, this was a great purchase! Better quality than the first two seasons (The video quality and special features in my seasons one and two DVDs were messed up).",1423008000,,1050,4.531578947368421

4015654,5,B002ZCY7QY,"I was a Chuck fan from the off when the pilot ep aired in 2008 in the uk. As my other reviews state although these shows look better on bluray due to them using 16mm film the picture quality can be fuzzy at times.  But sometimes when the lighting is bright they look superb though obviously not as pun sharp as shows shot on HD 35mm film.  Suffice to say the show just kept getting better, and the new character of Agent Daniel Shaw played by Brandon Routh was a great addition to the cast, i really enjoyed The Ring storyline and finally letting one or two of the characters in on Chucks secret spy life was well timed.  Jeff and Lester just got funnier as did Big Mike.  Although i haven't watched the whole of this season yet i have seen it several times in the past and therefore know its going to end in a worthy cliffhanger i just cant remember what as i type this.  So as always i would recommend this fun series full of laughs, kick ass action, drama and romance.",1421798400,,971,4.198924731182796

Ok yeah its a cute comedy and even this episode had its moments but they mixed in to much stupidity. Those guys that make the 'whats wrong with this movie-show / honest reviews' could have a field day with this one.
Ahh the team is back together, ok great. But they way they went about it made 'Chuck' look like a d-bag. They have 'Chuck' rant and rave about a normal life, then leave the girl of his dreams, tickets in her hands, to 'try' and be a spy again. Then when this plan winds up in the toilet they have Chuck ramp up the douche again. O_o Much alcohol will be required to help forget about 3:1.",1401840000,,721,4.194244604316546

He didn't want to be the intersect. He just wanted his life back. Now it seems that he's getting  a little cocky. The intersect ""flashes"" with the kung-fu moves are a little weird. Almost stupid.

When I saw that the blu-ray version of season 1-5 where out I immediately bought the set. Season 4 and 5 were Blu-rayish quality, having a slightly crisper picture than the DVD versions. However, season 1-3 where not Blu-ray quality at all. In fact, even saying they were DVD quality would be stretching it.

Chuck is an amazing show with a unique storyline and a cast that has great chemistry together. Unfortunately, NBC and Warner Bros. do not feel the same way. In my opinion, just go on Netflix and watch Chuck there.",1389312000,,630,4.469565217391304

Of course , Sarah as the beautiful spy adds sex-appeal, and Morgan as Chuck's
best friend is great too. The shows are really fun to watch. The third season is

4016135,4,B002ZCY7QY,"Charles 'Chuck' Bartowski and his handlers, Sarah Walker and John Casey, have successfully defeated FULCRUM, a rogue intelligence agency. The Intersect, the combined intelligence database of the entire United States which has been downloaded into Chuck's brain, has been radically upgraded. Now Chuck has access to advanced weapons and kung fu skills, amongst other abilities. But Chuck's emotions are getting in the way of him being able to do his job. A new agent, Daniel Shaw, is assigned to the team to help train Chuck as a spy, but this has unexpected results.

After the relentlessly entertaining second season of Chuck, the third season gets off to a surprisingly weak start. Rather than picking up immediately on Season 2's cliffhanger ending (where Chuck comes into possession of the Intersect 2.0), we rejoin the action six months later. This causes problems even with Chuck's elastic notions of plausibility (why are Sarah and Casey hanging around Burbank for six months when Chuck isn't there?) and necessitates a lot of backtracking and flashbacks to fill in the gap. Once we're past the hurdle of the first few episodes (and a somewhat dubious Vinnie Jones guest role), however, things improve a lot. The second season's format of stringing together several multi-episode arcs into one cohesive whole is repeated and is almost as successful as previously. Brandon Routh is decent in the new role of Shaw, with the writers not wasting any opportunity to highlight his previous major role as Superman (even draping him in the American flag in one amusing scene).

As usual, the season has a good mix of comedy and drama, with some great stand-alone stories (Armand Assante's turn as a somewhat demented, American-friendly version of Castro is especially entertaining) standing alongside the ongoing story arcs. Most satisfying is the unexpected way the show's set-up suddenly changes. Major characters discover Chuck's secret with little forewarning, altering the show's premise for the better by dropping the 'secret identity' storyline just as it was starting to get a little stale. Chuck and Sarah's relationship is moved onto another level, again just as the 'will they/won't they' angle was running out of steam. Even Casey is given a stronger personal storyline, as he discovers a family he never knew he had and becomes conflicted over contacting them or not. And, as usual, the more serious spy stuff is balanced out nicely by the lunacy going on over at the Buy More store.

Overall, the third season of Chuck (****) is funny, self-aware and entertaining. It's not quite as a good as the second season, due to a dodgy set-up in the first few episodes that results in a lot of backtracking and wheel-spinning and the fact that the new bad guys, the Ring, are identical to FULCRUM. Beyond that, the show evolves its premise and characters in compelling new directions and shows a willingness to change even fundamental parts of the premise when necessary. The season is available now in the UK (DVD) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).",1334793600,,3043,5.057768924302789

CHUCK SUGGESTS THAT A FAMILY CAN BE IN MANY FORMS. Whether a slightly insane corporate group, or the CIA/NSA, SPIES, or your own sibling.  And put this together with humor, some good action sequences, and a heartfelt love story, you have
CHUCK

This is a great show. A show about how we can change with others helping us. Brilliant writing, wonderful acting, with some new faces (at least for me) and a show that is really for the family. Humorous, sometimes laugh out loud, but usually clever, subtle humor; with a terrific cast who can execute humor or longing, using their bodies and seem totally believable. And from day one, an emerging love story that will have you pulling for the 2 fantastic leads - Yvonne Strahoski emerges as a very talented actress, and continues growing thru the years. Zachary Levi does a delightful job as CHUCK, and he has also grown as an actor. Fine directing.

Congrats to the creators, Chris Fedak/Schwartz for providing the intelligent audience with a thinking persons show...that can appeal to a wide audience.

It's just completely adorable... just when I think 'what the heck are they going to do to carry on the series' they throw in another cute twist.  This may sound odd, but one of the things I love about the series is the way they give you everything you want... and I can often guess what's going to happen... but it's never boring, they give it to you in such a cute way that I end up laughing with tears rolling down my face.

There is new tension between Chuck and Morgan (the resolution of said conflict is bound to be funny) and our two new characters (Shaw and Hannah) are developing nicely. Personally, I prefer Hannah to Sarah. What's so stinking great about Sarah anyway? She's cold and distant, incapable of having a meaningful relationship, and (since this is a major element in the casting) considerably less attractive than Hannah. DOWN WITH SARAH.

4016327,5,B002ZCY7QY,"At the end of season 2 Chuck downloaded the Intersect 2.0 into his head and he gained some serious skills. With those skills he can now be the spy he's always wanted. Though as you could expect the journey to super spy is not without some bumps as he has trouble flashing because his emotions get in the way. Because of this Morgan is finally brought into the loop and is hilarious in almost every scene he is in. Morgan is even more of a geek then Chuck was and seeing Morgan try to help the team is super funny. Also it's nice to see him and Chuck bond again as they can finally discuss everything once again.

Morgan isn't the only one to join the team this season. Special Agent Daniel Shaw joins the team. He is the real spy that Chuck wants to become. He creates a love triangle with Chuck and Sarah that pushes all of the characters forward as each shows their love for one another in different ways. Chuck is more of the sweet guy and Shaw is the suave Bond type. They each battle for Sarah's love and it creates some great story lines. Casey also grows throughout the season as you find out that he has a family. It makes him so much more human as he shows his love to a family that doesn't know he exists.

The main storyline throughout the season is the battle against the Ring and there infiltration of the US government. It has a lot of twists and turns and it really pushes Chuck's spy training along as every week he becomes more of a true spy. It's really exciting to see Chuck evolve into the Spy that he's always wanted to be. Also before the season concludes Scott Bakula returns to try and save Chuck from an overloading Intersect. Also Christopher Lloyd guest stars as Chuck's therapist. He isn't his normal jovial self in the role he plays it much more seriously which is a nice switch up for him.

Overall the season is exciting and thoroughly enjoyable every step of the way. You get a lot of twists and turns while still getting the comedy and charm you expect from the series. This season is a step in a new direction for the show. It begins the journey of Chuck actually becoming a spy. It changes up the formula enough to keep the series fresh without varying too much from the nerd/spy/comedy show that we all fell in love with.",1298073600,,2257,4.305882352941176

4016353,4,B002ZCY7QY,"I love watching the quirky, nerdy character of Chuck evolve into a confident spy by season three. The first season is wholesome and funny with a little bit of mystery and romance thrown in. The extended cast is well thought out and are important to the series unlike many other shows I can think of. I appreciate that the first season can be viewed by the whole family without worry of morals or language. Unfortunately as season two progresses into season three the writers went down another path and made the show too grown up for the kids with the budding relationship between the shows' two primary stars. Seasons one and two are must-sees by the whole family but I would hold off season three and beyond for mature audiences only.

Season three finds Chuck as a first-class spy who is finally getting a grip on his alter-ego and how to deal with it. He is thrust into a lot of adventure and a bit of intrigue with and without his spy girlfriend. It sometimes feels like I am watching a Victoria's Secret shoot when she is in the room, which is totally unnecessary for the show to succeed. The writers do not have to play sex up to make this show good, it stands on its own.",1294963200,,1178,4.4036697247706424

4016450,4,B002ZCY7QY,"Chuck continues to be one of the rare gems on TV right now. The 3rd season is solid and enjoyable (Shaw does bring down the show because Brandon Routh just did not gel that well with the cast) but really picks up in the second half once Chuck & Sarah (Yvonne Strahovski & Zachary Levi share wonderful chemistry) get together, Shaw's role is more clearly defined and Routh then being able to deliver a better performance (and not just there to cause angst between Chuck/Sarah) and the show becomes more entertaining as there is more fun, hilarity, romance and action to be had.

Overall a great season one with an excellent payoff in an explosive season finale that I recommend to every fan and any new fan looking for a great show to watch. This season is not perfect (the aforementioned Shaw was just not executed as well as what it could have been largely due to Routh's wooden acting) and I hope the writers learn from and improve upon come Season 4 but that aside, S3 is still well worth having.",1287446400,,999,4.489010989010989
4016451,5,B002ZCY7QY,"There's a bit, just a tiny bit, of a backlash with the decision to allow Chuck Bartowski to actually whup some asss. There's some feeling that Chuck should've stayed the lovable klutzy wuss who contributes solely thru his smarts and his Intersect intel flashes. But these are observations offered by friends of mine who are sort of lame. Me, I love it that now villains truly cannot front on Chuck, that Chuck - providing his emotions don't hinder his upgrade (the Intersect II) from lending him, say, martial arts skills - now can take on the most formidable cats in a life-or-death rumble. The direct fallout, of course, is that his handlers are given less chances to spring into action. That was one thing I was bemoaning, that the lovely Agent Walker wasn't given more to do in the way of buttkicking. However, emotionally, romantically, Sarah Walker's plate is pretty full. She and Chuck once again put you on a stressful emotional roller coaster.

Writers have to keep finding ways to keep Chuck and Sarah apart, of course, even though we already know that these two truly care for each other. Theoretically, the Intersect II makes Chuck into the perfect spy, our Nerd Herder now able to access pretty much whichever skills set he requires to fulfill his missions. What hinders him isn't only his forays into immaturity but his inherent humanity, his inability to kill, although Sarah considers this to be Chuck's greatest asset. There's a swerve thrown in which kicks off this third season. Chuck with his new abilities now intends to be the best spy he can be, to the extent that several months ago he'd dismissed Sarah's plea that they quit the skullduggery business and go away together. As the first episode opens, we learn that Chuck and Sarah have been estranged since then. And because this alone apparently isn't enough to mess up the viewer's day, Kristin Kreuk and Brandon Routh are ushered in with recurring roles, serving as the respective romantic foils and further obstacles to Chuck and Sarah's getting together. At least, Brandon Routh - as Agent Shaw, the new team leader of Project Bartowski - also advances the overarching plot. As if Chuck's shot at landing Sarah weren't dire enough, now he's got Superman as a rival. Damn writers.

Putting aside the ongoing romantic tug of war, one really fun element is Chuck's new ability to access a whole mess of skills sets. Besides watching Chuck throw down with the kung fu and the gymnastics, we also see him do things like play the flamenco guitar, speak Korean, even dance elegantly. All these borrowed talents (except maybe the speaking Korean part) come in really handy with the black ops missions because Operation Bartowski is kept busy foiling those nasty plots hatched by the Ring, a secret criminal cabal which, by the way, encompasses the Fulcrum group (Fulcrum being the Big Bad of the prior two seasons).

CHUCK blankets a heap of genres, it's what makes the show so great. The unrequited romance, the sweet espionage thriller, the awesome geek comedy. The spy stuff is always offset by the odd and kinda creepy Nerd Herders and their prankings at the Buy More store. I get a kick out of the rock band wannabe, Jeffster.

Faithful viewers who'd been pining and moping for the past two seasons are in for some really gratifying moments. Chuck can't be expected to keep his secrets from those closest to him, not when there's so much cloak & dagger traffic going on at the Buy More and the yogurt place and around his apartment complex. So, yeah, events unfold and result in irrevocable shifts in the status quo and in the character dynamics. Season 3 delivers with a plentitude of fan joy. There's even a chance that love conquers all. This cast only gets better. I seriously don't even want to single out any one actor because every one is so very on point. The Awesomes are given larger roles to play. Morgan Grimes becomes more likable. We learn Sarah Walker's real first name. I love what's done to make John Casey more human, or as human as the supremely bottled-up NSA Colonel can get. All hail Adam Baldwin (okay, dude is an icon; I must single him out). And, dammit, okay, I have to applaud Zachary Levi on his physicality because the man absolutely sells his action scenes. Zachary Levi, stand up. Or, put another way, up Chuck!

There originally were only thirteen episodes slated for Season 3, but then six more were ordered. These nineteen episodes are caught on 5 discs, with the following special features: ""Chuck-Fu and Dim Sum"" - an overview of Season 3 (00:21:51 minutes long); the video mockumentary ""The Jeffster Revolution"" (00:10:54 minutes); 6 minutes' worth of outtakes; and tons of ""Declassified Scenes"" which are basically bonus scenes spread throughout the five discs.",1287360000,2,4776,4.812423873325213

Some cite Chuck's new abilities for their dislike of the season, they say the show has 'changed too much'. I think if a show and its characters don't change and grow then it becomes boring and is soon destined to die. That being said, if the characters and show advance and change too quickly it can kill the show. But I don't think this is the case with season 3 of Chuck, I think the growth of the characters matches the timeline and show's progression just fine. New and exciting developments, and character back stories makes it interesting and leaves you craving more. There's nothing worse than a show that follows along the same old path episode to episode, season to season it's just boring and it begs to be put out of its misery. What makes a story worthwhile is how it unfolds, the twist and turns, the growth of the characters, character's back stories, etc. In fact the most important aspect to a story is having character's that people can get to know and come to care about. I personally loved this season and enjoyed it immensely, Chuck is still the Chuck we know and love and the show is still the same action packed, dramatic, witty and humorous spy spoof it has always been.

With the help of his handlers, Sarah and Casey, Chuck may have a chance. But Chuck's big heart may be holding him back from being the detached agent that the government wants him to be.

Chuck and cast are back for another season of danger and suspense, and always plenty of laughs. The cast is solid. And the characters keep growing and developing.

4016575,1,B002ZCY7QY,"After seasons 1+2 of Chuck, I literally would have done anything to get this show renewed, and I did my part like many other Chuck fans.  Season 3 started with a 3.0 Nielsen rating amoung 18-49 year olds (best ever for Chuck), and NBC had a MASSIVE advertising blitz as well, with 'No More Mister Nice Spy' ads on every NBC show for two months, including several ads during the Thanksgiving Parade.  By the end of the season, the two hour final episode was barely above a test pattern in ratings (1.8 Nielsen rating), with a loss of over three million viewers, or about 45% of the audience.

No matter how much loyal fans write glowing reviews of the mess that was season 3, the fact is that half the audience quit the show.  And we were all DIE HARD fans going into season 3.  We all freakin' LOVED this show.

The pain runs deep for me.  I really cared about Chuck and Sarah going into Season 3, but they died a horrible death of slow character assassination at the inept hands of the writers and especially Josh Schwartz.  When they finally got together, it seemed like the season had finally taken it's toll on their chemistry as well.

Furthermore, the plot is starting to resemble a bad copy of Return of the Jedi.  Next year we probably find out that Chuck and Sarah Walker are brother and sister, like the Skywalker family.  The plot is that inbred at this point.

Personally all I want out of season 4 is all I ever wanted, Chuck and Sarah and Casey to solve crimes together and Chuck and Sarah to dig each other, and we get some laughs.

If you watch the first two seasons and decide that the relationship of Chuck and Sarah is important and special, I would suggest skipping season 3 altogether and waiting for season 4.  Or just skip the entire middle of the season until Shaw is gone.  No need to watch their characters disintegrate.",1277942400,18,1846,4.420118343195266

The third season takes the viewer to a different level as Chuck becomes a full blown spy.  Criticism aside, this season brought out more of the personal storylines of the characters.

In Chuck VS. The Tic Tac, John Casey's history is presented with a few surprises tossed into the plot.  It is one of the best episodes of the series.

Chuck Vs. First Class: on his way to Paris Chuck meets Hannah (Kristin Kreuk).  For the next several episodes Chuck attempts to forget Sarah with his attention on Hannah, but alas, Chuck has to face his true feelings for Sarah, and unfortunately, Hannah is left betrayed and feeling used by Chuck.  This was not Chuck's best moment--his nice guy image took a beating.  Blame the writers for this mess.

Awesome and Ellie are given more to do in this season.  The Buy More gang have their moments as well, especially in Chuck Vs. The Beard--great episode, and their greatest moments in the season finale--Chuck VS. The Ring!

Super Agent Daniel Shaw is tossed into this seasonal bag with some mixed reviews.  Sarah changing her romantic focus from Chuck to Shaw was a bit lame.  Sorry.  Of course, everything works out for Chuck and Sarah as the season progressed as we knew it would--romantic destiny is difficult to alter.

Shaw and Chuck have their moments.  The confrontations led up to a great climax, more than once.

4016578,1,B002ZCY7QY,"Contains Spoilers....

The first 2 seasons of Chuck were so entertaining but the third season was the complete opposite.  It became cringe worthy by the second episode of the season.  They had changed the characters of Chuck and Sarah so much you couldn't recognize them.  Poor Sarah got the shaft and was treated horrible but Chuck it was even worst because he became so overly self centered and smug that I found myself hoping he would get his a$$ kicked weekly.

The moronic intersect 2.0 was beyond insulting, I'm surprised they didn't give Chuck the ability to fly and x-ray vision while they were at it.  I'm sure the actor who plays Chuck was asking to have the character change so he could be a more 'suave' leading man but a metro-sexual Chuck is about as appealing as a Ken doll.

The build up to Chuck and Sarah getting together was dull, especially when the producers said they would be together by the end of the 1st half of S3.  You have no reason to worry about the 'obstacles' they put in their way to getting together since you already knew they would be elimiated one way or another.  Also talk about wasting Kristin Kreuk, I will say she did the most with what they gave her but she desevered better.  Brandon Routh made out a little better, granted his character wasn't really fleshed out but when he stopped being an 'obstacle' and became an actual character that he could sink his teeth into he was a blast to watch.

I won't even get into what they did to the rest of the characters this season and the way they were written.  It's sad when you have talent like Adam Baldwin, Sarah Lancaster and Ryan Ryan McPartlin given the horrible dialog/storylines they were given this year, especially poor Sarah Lancaster.  The few moments the producers and writers decided to toss their way were they were amazing.

So as much as I can recommend the 1st & 2nd season, I can't say the same for the third.  If you want to catch up then watch the videos for free at [...] but don't waste your money on this one.",1276214400,15,2022,4.456521739130435

This went on until episode 13 when Chuck started to be Chuck again. In the mean time however I saw the character of Sarah get totally butchered. Some people call that growth. I call it crappy writing.

4016580,5,B002ZCY7QY,"I became a Chuck addict after the first couple episodes of the first season. Chuck is well known for having relatable and loveable characters. This makes it almost too easy for the writers to not only keep us laughing, but at times to keep us on the edges of our seats.

I found Season 3 to be a little less playful than the first and second seasons, but that isn't a downside by any means. I enjoyed the direction the writers took the show. There were a couple elements of Seasons 1 and 2 that I found to be a bit repetitive that they changed in Season 3... and for the better I may add! I'll let you discover what those elements are for yourself!

This show continues to introduce situations that (relatively) we can all relate to in one way or another.

Terrific show. Terrific writing. Terrific cast. Great humor! Great plot! Great season!

Buy this season! You won't be dissapointed!",1275696000,11,888,4.462962962962963
4016581,3,B002ZCY7QY,"I watched Chuck every week but Season 3 was just terrible. Actually, right after Clark Kent (Brandon Routh) joined the show, everything went down to the drain.  Chuck used to be fun to watch. Everyone of us were Chuck one way or other who was just nobody. Chuck just wanted to be Chuck. Superman turned the show upside down completely.  Chuck wanted to be someone else now. Boring!

There was some fun moment but the focus was all on Clark Kent in Season 3. Who cared what Superman could do?",1275609600,5,491,4.433333333333334
4016582,5,B002ZCY7QY,"Chuck is one of the greatest shows to come onto television in a long time.  With a mix of spy humor and action, (and a little nerd/geek atmosphere), this show can appeal to almost anyone looking for a fun ride.  The third season gets a little more serious than the first two but overall is still as great or even better than its predecessors.  The episodes continue an extremely polished storyline of the nerd-herder Chuck Bartowski and the dialogue keeps the humor intact.  Definitely look for this on store shelves if you don't buy it here on Amazon.  Awesome series.",1275523200,8,569,4.65
4016642,5,B002ZCY7QY,"I don't know what the others are talking about when they say the show Chuck is getting worse, it's quite the contrary! Sure the first few episodes are a little too focused on Chuck and Sara's relationship, but on the side the other Characters were getting more interesting.  I think not only did the third season make Chuck look even more amazing but it also made Sara, Casey, Morgan,Devin and Elliot look awesome too and now Morgan, Devin and Elliot have bigger, more amazing parts in the show.

The last few episodes of Chuck were really the most amazing and action packed, but my favorite episode of the season was the last episode because that episode was the most action packed and it was two hours long instead of the usual one hour long episode.

I think the third season of Chuck was better than both seasons one and two.  The show Chuck just keeps getting better and better each and every season and I look forward to seeing the fourth season of Chuck especially after the producers really set up a lot for the next season.",1275350400,5,1032,4.502673796791444
4016643,5,B002ZCY7QY,"I will admit that the first part of this season I was worried another show I love go down the drain.  Thankfully I was very wrong.  Chuck has given us another amazing season.  It is one of the few shows this year I have been happy with the season finale, it wasn't a let down or just depressing.  There was both good and bad.
Keep up the great work Chuck!",1275177600,4,355,4.0285714285714285
4016644,3,B002ZCY7QY,"It's a lot easier to write a bad adventure show than it is to write good humor!

I loved the first two seasons but have found this year tiresome or worse. I hated the stuff with Shaw! I was happy to see Chuck and Sarah get together but I didn't even watch the finale even though I bought and own the whole season from Amazon on demand.

I guess I'm through with watching the new Chucks. I'm going to have to settle for watching the first two years again and try to forget this one!",1274832000,4,481,4.052631578947368
4016645,5,B002ZCY7QY,"I just finished watching the season finale. Wow! I've been watching since episode one.  Just when you think everything's perfect another sneaky plot twist jumbles everything up. It's not like lost where the characters find random dumb stuff happens constantly; the plotline is very constructive. It feels like the directors write out a season at a time rather than episode by episode. But my favorite part is that the show hasn't changed from what they set out to do. Chuck hasn't sold out; it's still about a geeky guy who gets the girl using his clumsy charm. All of the main characters are the same; no one's left, and it's not getting boring!!! On the contrary, it's getting much more interesting and intense. A word of advice though: If you're interested in the show, please start at season one and watch all the episodes in order. I guarantee you'll enjoy the in depth plot so much more! It's defiantly worth your time.",1274832000,7,925,4.709876543209877
4016646,5,B002ZCY7QY,"Josh Schwartz & Chris Fedak do not disappoint anyone in this season either, as the finally of 2 hours hit on TV tonight I can only say they leave a HUGE loose end but do it in such a way as like ""slipping down the rabbit hole boys and girls!""  It was an excellent season as all the prior ones and there has not ever been a series created with the humor and action as this series (I have never seen one like this remotely and is miles different then something like LaFemme Nakita), it truly is unique and puts you in the greatest moods after you watch the show.  Shaw is an issue during the ENTIRE season all the way through, Scott Baccula's character of Chuck's dad (he did an excellent job too as always) leaves the biggest mystery in the end of the finale and his character ends up giving you a ""JOLT"" with what he goes through and unleashes upon Chuck.  Chuck must step up to the plate to protect his loved ones and do something deeper in the very end as he also progresses through the series and as far as protecting family, ironically so does John Casey (Adam Baldwin).  The general's character even has a few bumps more than usual in the finale and everyone is left in a forced situation of change.  It leaves the staff of the Buy More in a real ""BANG for the BUCK"" so to speak, and literally leaves them in uncertain unstable ""explosive"" situations as well.  That is all I will say.  They did an excellent job with romance, action, and humor, it has been a fun ride.",1274745600,18,1473,4.258064516129032
4016647,4,B002ZCY7QY,"Having enjoyed the first two seasons of Chuck, I was concerned the writers would run out of original story ideas during season three. Though this seemed to happen during the first half of the season - drama between Chuck and Sarah is emphasized too heavily, lending several episodes a ""haven't we seen this before"" air - the third season is overall a lot of fun. Casey and Morgan in particular go through some interesting character development, which limits the annoyance of episodes when it's difficult not to hate the show's namesake.

As with the first two seasons, season three contains plenty of exciting action and well-executed humor. There are some disappointing episodes, but if you enjoyed the first and second seasons of Chuck I would definitely recommend season three!",1274486400,5,780,5.046511627906977
4016648,5,B002ZCY7QY,"At this point, I'm sure most people reading this (three seasons in) have been watching Chuck on television, and I don't need to explain it's merits. It's a mix of comedy and drama, with an undercurrent of the will they/won't they story telling that Josh Schwartz is known for. For me, this season has been on par with Season 2; never surpassing it, but never sinking below the bar that Season 2 set. Had this been the last season of the show, that wouldn't have sat as well with me, but seeing as how Chuck has been renewed for a fourth season, the possibilities of a new season have erased any small quibbles I had with this season (the Shaw character, Morgan finding out...things like that).

4016649,5,B002ZCY7QY,"I just discovered Chuck during Season 3 and since then I've been completely in love with the series.  I immediately ordered seasons 1 and 2 on DVD so I could catch up on all the backstory and have watched both seasons multiple times since receiving the DVDs.  The finale of Season 2 made for a great start to season 3 and it has been sheer brilliance from there.  Some of my absolute favorite episodes in the entire series have been in Season 3 (such as Chuck vs. The Other Guy and Chuck vs. The Honeymooners).  The writers and actors are of equal brilliance in this show - it comes together perfectly with an amazing blend of drama, comedy and romance.  I am so excited to see what the final few episodes of Season 3 will bring and, of course, I can't wait for Season 4 to begin.  I would (and have!) recommend this series... and this season... to anyone and everyone!  You won't be sorry.  Enjoy!",1273795200,20,898,4.367469879518072
4016650,5,B002ZCY7QY,The 3rd Season of Chuck was a great follow-up to the fantastic 1st and 2nd seasons!  I hope NBC renews for a 4th Season!,1273536000,9,120,4.0
4016651,5,B002ZCY7QY,"In its superb third season, ""Chuck"" continues its highly entertaining blend of drama, comedy, and romance.  At Season Two's end, nice guy computer nerd and CIA asset Chuck Bartowski (Zachary Levi) uploaded into his own brain a new, improved Intersect which not only restored his ability to ""flash"" on espionage information, it also provided access to new skills.  As he told his CIA handler Sara Walker (Yvonne Strahovski) and her NSA partner John Casey (Adam Baldwin) at the time, ""Guys, I know Kung Fu.""

In Season Three, Chuck, no longer an accidental tourist in the espionage world, embarks on a bumpy, uncertain journey to becoming a full-fledged spy.  This journey involves a painful Catch-22.  Chuck must succeed in becoming a spy to stay close to Sara Walker, his erstwhile bodyguard and romantic interest, but each step towards spyhood seems to take him further away from the decent, honest guy that Sara secretly cherishes.

At the beginning of Season Three, Chuck makes two critical mistakes: He disappoints Sara and he flunks spy school.  In search of second chances, Chuck must accept tutoring from the experienced, ruthless CIA agent Daniel Shaw (Brandon Routh in an extended guest role), a man with questionable intentions toward both Chuck and Sara.  Chuck will also suffer hilarious difficulties in keeping his real and spy lives separate.  New brother-in-law ""Captain Awesome"", best friend Morgan, and Chuck's co-workers at the BuyMore become entangled in spy plots, while Team Bartokowski members Sara Walker and John Casey experience some surprising personal and professional challenges.

Season Three was originally programmed for thirteen episodes before being extended to nineteen.  Lucky ""Chuck"" fans will thus be treated to two excellent season finales.  In the first, Chuck will resolve his conflicts with Shaw and with Sara.  In the second, Chuck's spy life will collide with his family life in a game-changing way.

""Chuck: The Complete Third Season"" is most highly recommended to fans of the series.",1271462400,55,2028,5.25776397515528

8384606,2,B002ZCY7QY,"So this is season 3 of Chuck.  While the first 2 seasons were good, this latest season seems to have been put together by a couple of people who have the mindset of a couple of 12 year olds.  And that's probably an insult to the average 12 years old kids today who probably could have done much better. Poor old Chucky. In the first seasons he was a bumbling misfit, caught up in a problem not of his doing.  And despite being over repetitive, it seemed to work.  Now his Daddy, Orion, has got all the junk out of his brain and re-loaded him with an updated version, which only seems to work when it suits the script writers own stupidity.  Chucky now ""wants"" to be a spy.  He even goes to the extent of telling his old partner/girlfriend Sara that he understands about not being emotionally involved and then spends every episode wondering why she no longer shows anything in the way of emotions toward him.  The writers have turned him into a complete and utter mindless moron. They have managed to take all of the zany humor out of the show and put together a piece of rubbish which now borders on stupidity.  I guess they have other projects on their minds and the other projects are taking priority over this one.  Pity, because they had a good thing going for them (and for us, the viewers) but that's showbiz!!!
Fortunately none of this has cost me any money as it is currently available on Prime, but reality tells me that it's time to move on to bigger and better things.",1526947200,2,1480,4.372262773722627
