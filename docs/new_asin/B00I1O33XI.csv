8638308,4,B00I1O33XI,"This is another workout in Tracie Long's Longevity series.  I have owned it a few times now and have not kept it, but am giving it another try.  I enjoy parts of it immensely, and others not so much.  I think that is my own issue though, as I have trouble seeing what the purpose of the workout is.

It is about 50 minutes long, and I consider it to be a lighter weight/cardio focused workout.  All you need are a few sets of dumbbells and a medicine ball.  I use my 3 pound Danskin weighted green ball and it works fine.  One could also sub a light dumbbell or play ball.

I like the cardio portions primarily because using the ball is different, the choreography isn't overly complicated and it's mostly low impact which I really appreciate.  There is one section where you do high jogs, I just march in place.  Although being that most of the cardio is low impact anyway, this seems a little odd to me.

I liked the weight segments for the most part, the shoulder work was probably my favorite.  The chest work was my least favorite as it was mostly pushups, I may substitute bench presses next time.  There was also a set of pec flies though which I liked.  I wasn't a huge fan of the ab work either and skipped it.  I did enjoy the stretch at the end.

Tracie Long is a great instructor, I enjoy her personality and she has a very impressive and enviable figure.  I am hit and miss with her workouts though, this one is decent though even if I might not jive with all the movements.  I find myself migrating towards instructors who are near my age as many of their workouts are more appropriate for my level.  I am not into the heavy duty weights anymore and appreciate the functionality that Tracie's offerings bring.  Even if I have to modify to suit my needs.

I give this workout 4 stars, overall a good effort from Tracie.",1451692800,6,1832,4.298245614035087

8638310,5,B00I1O33XI,"I loved this workout!! I have been a Tracie Long fan since the The Firm days of the Tortoise and the Hare. I loved her instruction the most of all the instructors. When I found the Longevity series, I was hooked! This is the second one that I have bought and I love it! It's a great cardio workout and a good one to alternate with the first one, Defining Shape. Excellent Tracie Long!!",1423353600,5,385,4.216216216216216
