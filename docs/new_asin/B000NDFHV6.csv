8177030,3,B000NDFHV6,"This item comprises the original SD DVD versions recorded on a single Blu-Ray, so it is not an HD edition. But the contents are a classic and the performances are all top-notch, with a variety of first rate performers. I recommend this to my friends.

8177031,4,B000NDFHV6,"This set of documentaries with accompanying performances of 14 piano concertos chosen from across Mozart's life was recorded in 1991 and last issued as single discs in 2006-7. This compilation is a re-packaging for Blu-ray release and is not only far more convenient for collection purposes, taking up the space of just one disc, but also significantly cheaper as a set. In addition the disc delivers an enjoyable product in terms of content and technicalities even if falling short of modern technical levels of Blu-ray.  The documentary content therefore needs to be the focus of attention for potential purchasers.

The documentaries follow Mozart's various tours around Europe spanning from the early age of 8-9 years where his father was keen to promote his child prodigy gifts, through his development years and finally through his mature artist years. Touring was an exhausting and time-consuming activity but one undertaken by any performing artists intent on promoting themselves in order to make a living. Audiences were fickle, often driven by changing taste, and the life of a performer was hazardous in the extreme. Mozart was a good example to study as he progressed from famous child prodigy, through fame as a performer and composer before finally dying in such poverty that his exact burial place is not known.

Andre Previn proves to be an excellent and engaging `host' throughout these documentaries in each of the 13 episodes which are both informative and interesting. They all contain extended extracts, often complete movements, from a wide range of Mozart's compositions written during the same periods and these are unfailingly well delivered.

There are also extended extracts from letters written by Mozart to his father, Leopold, and Leopold's own letters to Mozart plus letters to his wife read by actors chosen for the particular voices. These letters make the writers' feelings and reactions to people and events very clear. In this way it becomes much easier to assess Mozart's character and how it interacted with those from whom he continually tried to gain full-time employment but without success.

Previn's easy manner is especially involving and makes the content easily accessible and of interest to both informed and non-informed viewers. This is a valuable asset in any presenter and Previn had this in abundance. The documentary portion of each episode takes about half of the 60 minutes duration with the remainder being taken up with a `live' performance of a relevant concerto in front of an audience and in an appropriate venue.

The quality of the performances is of a generally high standard. The concertos played are numbers 1 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 17, 19, 20, 23, 24, 26 and 27. The performers themselves range from the well-known such as Vladimir Ashkenazy, Christian Zacharias, Mitsuku Uchida, Andre Previn, Zoltan Kocsis and Radu Lupu to lesser well-known artists such as Heidrun Holtmann, Malcom Frager, Deszo Ranki, Ivan Klansky, Homero Francesch and Aleksandar Madzar. Heidrun Holtmann and Christian Zacharias play two concertos each.

Curiously the booklet makes a point of Alicia de Larrocha and Previn combining for the final concerto but the track listing correctly lists Homero Francesch as the pianist with Gerd Albrecht as the conductor. Maybe there was a change of plans after the original notes were written which was not picked up upon the re-release.

Outstanding performances of individual concertos are those by Uchida of 9, Lupu of 19' Kocsis of 23 and Madzar of 27; notable performances are those by Zacharias of 6 and 8, Ashkenazy of 12, Ranki of 17 and Klansky of 20. Other performances are never less than good and always enjoyable.

The quality of the video content is typical of good 1991 SD television quality. The stereo sound of the musical performances is also eminently satisfactory within the limitations of SD TV recording and offers appropriate range, depth and tonal fidelity. This is an enjoyable product therefore on that basis and I have not experienced the considerable quality disappointment expressed by another reviewer relating to this Blu-ray re-issue. My suggested explanation follows below:

It is possible that replay equipment will be a major factor here. In the case of this review a moderate 40 inch TV screen at 5.5 metres was used which would minimise visual problems of grain and pixels that would be experienced by larger screens or shorter viewing distances or both. On the other hand, top quality sound equipment was used which would enhance the sound relative to less revealing equipment. Purchasers will need to assess their own situations in these regards therefore. I would suggest that both reviewer responses have been truthful but based upon different replay circumstances. The key consideration needs to be focussed on the documentary content rather than expecting a superior Blu-ray of recent provenance.

For those not wishing to watch the documentary each time and simply access the performances only in each episode upon subsequent viewing, this can be achieved by pressing the <<I button once only on the remote control for each episode. This takes the viewer straight to the point where the pianist enters ready to play the concerto. Unfortunately chapter access points have not been included but this method works in the same way and could even give quicker access as no menu is required.

This is an engrossing set of easily accessible documentaries supported by performances ranging from the enjoyable to notable. The extended playing time of over 12 hours is generous and is possible because of the lower file sizes required by archive material such as these films. This set therefore offers a most attractive purchase potential suitable for both new and established collectors.",1417737600,2,5799,5.1705756929637525
8177032,1,B000NDFHV6,"While the other reviews to date are about the old VHS and DVD releases, this review is of the new Blu-Ray release. In one word: Beware. Particularly if you are buying this to listen to it. To hear the performances. To listen to the music. The sound is not only not of Blu-Ray quality, but not even of DVD quality. It is highly compressed and coded. Unfortunately, EuroArts, the releaser, did not go back to the master tapes, but took the sound more or less directly from the earlier release formats. I bought the disk because it said, clearly and prominently, on the outside of the case, that it was in LPCM (translation: redbook CD-quality, 16 bit, 44.1KHz--not state of the art, but not bad either). But it is not. The entire soundtrack, both films and concert footage, is mastered in the old, superseded, outdated (and completely unnecessary in this day and age) Dolby II compression lo-resolution algorithm. No LPCM in sight. False advertising. Or a cheap-it-out, rush-it-out change of plans after the design of the box had been finalized. Alas. And, take it from me (I am an audio and video professional) the uncompressed, unDolby-ized, PCM soundtrack, all ten or more hours of it, would have easily fit on a single double-layer 50Gig Blu-Ray disk. Another potentially wonderful project acoustically spoiled, either by stupidity or budget-considerations. Not recommended, unless you are buying it strictly for the grainy and blurry 16mm documentary footage or the equally grainy and blurry (old NTSC TV standard) concert footage to go along with the grainy, blurry Dolby compresed and lo-res sound. A missed opportunity. A real missed opportunity.",1416355200,26,1652,5.032846715328467

8177034,5,B000NDFHV6,"This is the complete set of the documentaries originally produced by Philips Classics around 1991 (the bicentenary of his death), in conjunction with their colossal ""Complete Mozart Edition"", a 45-volume, 180-CD venture. These documentaries were, of course, released on VHS in 7 separate volumes. I own a couple of them, and the majority of the rest I taped off a Connecticut public TV station several years back.

As the title of this series suggests, each segment takes you through the main stages of Mozart's life and travels. A total of 13 documentaries are each about 55 minutes long. This fascinating series is hosted by the eminent conductor and pianist Andre Previn. Much of the information presented has its main source in the frequent letters written back and forth between Wolfgang and his father Leopold. Back then, letter-writing was very much like the modern-day E-Mail correspondence carried out by countless millions today. Wolfgang would report day by day, and Leopold would comment, advise, instruct, and even protest frequently. Portions of these many letters are read by Michael Kitchen. Also, each segment is highlighted by a performance of a Mozart Piano Concerto, 14 performances in all (see below for performers). Also, portions of some of Mozart's chamber music are performed, as well as small segments from many of his operas. The series was filmed in the European cities that were visited by the composer.

If you love Mozart, you will without a doubt thoroughly enjoy this marvelous series of Mozart On Tour. You will be informed of many personal and interesting events and circumstances in his life and travels, as well as be entertained by some wonderful performances of Mozart's most personal of works: His supreme Concertos for Piano and Orchestra, very nicely performed. My only beef is with the interpretation of K.488, the Piano Concerto No. 23 in A Major. The soloist Zoltan Kocsis plays the first and second movements much too fast, and then plays the finale too slowly. I was disappointed by these chosen tempos of perhaps Mozart's most beautiful of concertos, vastly different from the overwhelming majority of performances that I have heard (although I think Horowitz was a little too fast on his version on video). That being said, however, all of the other performances I have no qualms about whatsoever. For Piano Concerto No. 23, you will have to be satisfied with Murray Perahia's excellent version on Sony (CD), or any other fine recording out there. If I'm not mistaken, Pollini has a very good performance that is currently available on DVD (on DG label, I think).
