7002847,5,B00T7Z5QAI,"Dancer and the Dame is a fun and enjoyable movie.

The way the story is told is by narrative sort of reminding me of old-time detective movies.  The acting is pretty good, and the dialog is well done.

The dog, Princess, is GREAT!

Bad guys are done in an effective way without lots of cursing.

Some violent contents, no real gore or blood splattering.

Overall I give this movie a sold A",1436659200,,389,4.333333333333333

7002857,5,B00T7Z5QAI,"My entire family, including my 4-year-old daughter, my husband and me and my parents watched this movie last night.  Every single one of us laughed at different points!  I have to say, that makes for an all-around great movie, a classic in our home.  Very seldom do we all find humor in one movie, since we all have different senses of humor.

Dancer & The Dame was heartwarming with a smidgen of morality to it.  I loved the heartfelt, spontaneous prayer that Dancer offered before going into the warehouse to rescue Ruby.  Princess, of course, brought light, hope, and love to the film, as well as comedy.  Because I am a dog lover, I appreciated the dog humor and the bonding that took place between Dancer and Princess over time.

In addition to its levity, warmth, and family-friendly theme, Dancer & The Dame provides a wholesome message about redemption - finding hope after loss, discovering oneself after succumbing to depression and despair.  It's a tale about finding meaning and purpose in your life, no matter who you are or what has happened in your life.

Dancer & The Dame is a movie the entire family can enjoy, because (thankfully) there are no lewd scenes of sex or cursing. There are a few violent scenes, however, which is my only caution.  Pure Flix did an excellent job with this film, because its quality - and those of the actors (love Eva LaRue) are comparable to secular options.",1433030400,9,1406,4.67479674796748

8700873,5,B00T7Z5QAI,"Billy Gardell is Rick Dancer, a wisecracking, disgruntled detective who is long past his prime. After failing to foil the criminal schemes of Eric Skanz (David A. R. White), Dancer has become the joke of the precinct. That is, until a local kid gets beat up and Dancer is back on the case! Only this time, he is partnered with ""Princess"", a fussy canine cop. I have to say this first, I loved the Bloopers, very funny. Now for the movie...I had more than a few laughs coming along here. Princess is adorable too, She looks just like a German Shepherd I had many years ago so I may be biased. Billy Gardell is so good as this cop, he is prickly and he is funny and he has some very angry moments too. All of them he does well. I did mist up a few times to be honest......I was ready to toss myself off my balcony if anything tragic happened to Princess. (There is the clue I am typing this review....get it?) Total recommendation. All the family is good for this.",1507766400,2,962,4.262295081967213
