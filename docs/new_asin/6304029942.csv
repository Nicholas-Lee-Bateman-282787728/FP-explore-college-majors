7858912,3,6304029942,"Common-Law Cabin represents Meyer near the height of his filmmaking powers. Common-Law Cabin takes place in the great outdoors ,and in brilliant color, at a tiny tourist resort/trap on the Colorado River. Dewey Hoople (Jack Moran) runs the joint along with Barbette Bardot, his common-law wife, and  teenaged daughter Coral (Adele Rein).  Dewey has begun to notice  Coral's well-developed figure and it's driving him crazy.  This atmosphere of incestuous desires never really amounts to anything, but it hangs over the movie like a thundercloud and makes the film a somewhat uncomfortable viewing experience.

 Meyer regular Franklin Bolger, as a crusty old tour guide, wrangles a trio of customers to follow him to the tourist resort. Alaina Capri plays a sluttish wife, John Furlong plays her wimpy husband, and Ken Swofford plays a mysterious, always smirking character who causes all hell to break loose when he arrives at the resort. Swofford is one of the main reasons this movie is still fun to watch today. In this case, he wants all the women he encounters at the resort, and one by one he goes after them.  The reason for his behavior becomes clear late in the film. He is a jewel thief who wants to buy the resort to hide out in.

The film moves suprisingly well in its short 70 minute time limit. As is usually the case with Meyer films the cinematography is excellent and the resort feels almost like a South Pacific resort in the middle of the Arizona desert. Acting kudos go to Jack Moran and Ken Swofford who keep the entire film rolling along.

This is not one of the films by Meyer that has been highlighted over the years and now would be a good time for a better restoration. The standard definition DVD presents a great transfer of the film. The mono sound is adequate if a little muffled at times. There are no extra features. This is a fun Meyer film and an excellent example of his drive in fare.",1336953600,,1920,4.673590504451038

If Russ Meyer had made ""Common Law Cabin"" early in his career it might be excused as a learning experience. But by 1967 he had advanced far beyond anything that he puts into this weak movie. Rather than work hard on something interesting, Meyer took a year off creatively and let his writer/collaborator Jack Moran get some screen time.

The one amazing thing about about ""Common Law Cabin"" is that its running time is only 69 minutes. If you get a chance to see the movie I can promise you it will be the longest 69 minutes you have ever spent.

Basically it has the standard Meyer elements: Three buxom actress-one of whom (Adele Rein) is spokes-model gorgeous. Lots of Raymond Chandler stylized dialogue and wry humor. A blend of 1960's California culture and the dark and pessimistic undercurrents found in Film Noir features.

Moran stars with Ken Swofford. Swofford is best known for his later quest appearances on the ""Rockford Files"" including his priceless Carl Wronko portrayal in the classic ""The Queen of Peru"". He is younger here but the acting style was already there.

The story itself is original, if only because no one else ever bothered turning a screenplay this weak into a feature, but it is not at all engaging or interesting.

The scene where the two youngest cast members pair off and head for the lake to play to a self-parodying sixties pop score is very nicely done, so good that it seems utterly out of place in this production.

Watch if your goal is to see everything that Meyer worked on, but making ""Common Law Cabin"" wasn't much of a learning experience for Meyer and watching won't be much of a learning experience for film buffs.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1129161600,,1748,4.64935064935065

Common Law Cabin is one of his best color films,a ripe thriller-melodrama filled with turns  even more twisted than the characters.
