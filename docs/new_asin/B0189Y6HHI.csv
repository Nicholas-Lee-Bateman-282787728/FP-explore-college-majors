7542875,3,B0189Y6HHI,"The problem with Legend is that it had very good dialogues, a decent story and a fine ensemble of actors (supporting and lead) but it didn't take off because the film concentrates on being devilishly stylish over anything. I think this film is so busy posing that every major scene seemed a bit like a trailer. The action and sets are remarkable but the film falls flat on its face because the steam is somehow not moving enough. I wish I could connect with the lives of the gangsters more. But I kept waiting for the film to end, it is that awkwardly constructed.",1453766400,2,564,4.4326923076923075
7542876,5,B0189Y6HHI,"A well trodden story indeed, have seen many of the films depicting the brutal-regime created by the Krays, including
the very well portrayed version with Gary and Martin Kemp in the lead roles, however, i have been looking forward
to watching this version with the very fine actor Tom Hardy playing both Reggie and Ronnie.
The story is told by 'Frances Shea' (Emily Browning) who was to become 'Reggie's' wife -
Created by fear the Krays built an empire, among their interests 'Protection' - 'Pubs' - 'Clubs' along with a connection
to the 'American-Mafia' based in 'Las Vegas'
Though both had spells behind bars during their reign of terror they truly believed themselves to be untouchable, after
all much of the then establishment including politicians and members of the police were in their back pockets.
This is a well portrayed and indeed fact-based story, 'Ronnie' who should never have been released back onto the streets
after being certified insane was indeed a loose-cannon almost beyond control, 'Reginald' had a more measured approach
to his business dealings though he was equally fearsome.
Police Inspector 'Nipper Read' (Christopher Eccleston) though once told to back-off by his superiors would never give up
trying to nail the Gangsters.
The Krays day of Judgement would indeed come.
Though such was the impact the Brothers had upon the streets of London back then....the Legend lives on to this day.
A well portrayed drama, 'Tom Hardy's' performance playing both Reggie and Ronnie who had very different personalities
was frankly stunning.
Credit to must be given to 'Emily Browning' playing the role of girlfriend and then wife to Reggie who's relationship with
the Gangster became strained.
This is a must-see film.

7542877,4,B0189Y6HHI,"As Ron would say, ""It's interesting."" This is based on the true story of the Kray brothers (Tom Hardy) who ruled and terrorized London as gangsters. As the film begins they are already established gangsters being followed by the ""coppers"" wherever they go. Ron is being certified as crazy and takes meds. Part of the film is narrated by Frances Shea (Emily Browning) the girlfriend and wife of Reggie.

The film is told as Reggie having to choose between his brother and everything else. Ron prevents Reggie from going straight and living the life Frances wants him to live. She had trouble coping with much of their life style. Ron is a very open homosexual in addition to his mental issues.

The film ends at their arrests.",1451779200,,725,4.700787401574803
7542878,3,B0189Y6HHI,"Tom Hardy is an amazingly diverse actor, but what's great about him is that he can play a brute just as easily as he can be suave and debonair. It's just not often he's called upon to do both in the same film, and playing opposite himself, no less. But that's what he gets to do in Brian Helgeland's twin gangster tale, Legend, as the infamous London gangsters Reggie and Ronnie Kray. Double the Hardy is always going to be worth laying down a few bucks to see, but more often than not his dual performances are the only thing Legend has going for it.

The story of the Krays has been told before in the weird 1990 film, The Krays, which starred two members of the '80s band Spandau Ballet. Legend, thankfully, isn't that; it uses some nifty visual tricks to have Hardy playing both Kray brothers. What's amazing is how easily Hardy becomes two completely different men, bringing different physical attributes, verbal cues and more. It doesn't take long before you forget its one man playing them. If only there were more inspiration in telling the Krays' story, rather than the point-by-point structure it eventually gives way to.

The Krays were kings of the London underground in the 1960s. Their firm, or gang, was infamous for extortion, fraud, and murder. But Reggie, the more level-headed brother, had aspirations of being something more. Strong-arming a therapist to release his psychotic, shark-toothed brother Ronnie from the mental ward, Reggie began using his influence and power to hob-nob with society's elite. He also met the perfect girl, Frances (Emily Browning), and began turning his life around.

Ronnie, an admitted homosexual with a severely violent streak, wasn't a fan of any of this. Not only does he keep yanking his brother back into the seedier side of being a gangster, but he's not too fond of the attention being lavished on Frances. The pull between family obligation and legitimacy is the key dramatic tension, for what little of it there actually is. Helgeland, who also wrote the script, sets up a number of interesting storyline possibilities that go nowhere. A rival gang led by a hammy Paul Bettany is set up as potential foils, but are practically written off in voice-over. Much is made of Frances' mental instability; her brother (played by Colin Morgan) refers to her as ""fragile"", but little is made of it even though it's something she shares in common with Ronnie. And while Hardy is great playing against a digital version of himself, only Reggie is a character to be taken seriously. Ronnie's uncouth, caveman demeanor is played up as comic relief too often for him to be seen as someone to be feared. Helgeland, along with cinematographer Dick Pope, capture the period details beautifully, evoking the look and energy of Scorsese's Goodfellas.  Still, if you're going to see Legend, see it for Hardy who gets the rare opportunity to beat himself up in a fight. Turns out that twice the Hardy isn't quite enough to ensure a great film, so an average one will have to do.",1450656000,4,3017,4.796153846153846
7542879,3,B0189Y6HHI,"Written and directed by Brian Helgeland (A Knight's Tale, L.A. Confidential) and adapted from the book by John Pearson (The Profession of Violence: The Rise and Fall of the Kray Twins), Legend is a film about the notorious Reggie and Ronnie Kray, twin brothers who came to dominate organized crime in London of the 1950's and 60's.

The film begins somewhere in the early 1960's when Reggie and Ronnie Kray (both played by Tom Hardy in a bravura double performance) were already established gangsters in London's East End but not yet the heads of organized crime they were to become. Reggie's main rivals are the Richardson brothers, but before he can deal with them he has to get his brother Ronnie out of a psychiatric hospital where he's been confined for his violent behavior. At the same time, he begins a relationship with a girl named Frances (Emily Browning), the younger sister of one of his henchmen, Frank Shea (Colin Morgan). When Reggie succeeds in getting Ronnie's release over the deep misgivings of the attending psychiatrist, Dr. Humphries (Nicholas Farrell), Humphries takes Reggie aside and warns him ""Your brother Ron is violent and psychopathic and I suspect he's paranoid schizophrenic... to put it simply he's off his f[***]ing rocker!"". He then hands Reggie a bottle of pills and desperately urges him ""Make sure he takes these... or there'll be serious trouble!""

We soon see why Reggie wanted Ronnie free before confronting the Richardsons.  Ronnie may be crazy, but he's absolutely fearless and capable of dishing out extreme violence in abundance, ""a one-man mob"" as Frances puts it in her narration. Not that Reggie is any slouch in that department.  He's more polished and controlled - and certainly more sane - but beneath that surface he's just as capable of dealing out brutal violence as Ronnie.

But as impressive as Hardy's performances are, the film itself is decidedly uneven, particularly in the focus and the pacing, and as a bio-pic it falls short both in terms of the accuracy of the events it depicts and in some of the chronology. No effort is made to bring out any of the Kray's upbringing, or their early budding careers as boxers, or their telling experience in national service which was an early indicator of where they were heading in life. And no effort is made to give any perspective on the real nature - let alone extent - of their criminal organization, The Firm, how they made their money, and the grip it had on the London criminal scene.

It also fails to make good use of some of the other fine actors in the film. Christopher Eccleston (Doctor Who, Heroes, Elizabeth)'s Detective ""Nipper"" Read, is given very little to do except to give reaction shots and deliver stock lines like ""We're going after the Krays.""  Paul Bettany (A Beautiful Mind, Master and Commander, A Knight's Tale) is all but invisible as Kray rival Charlie Richardson. Chazz Palminteri (Bullets over Broadway, The Usual Suspects) comes across as flat and half-there in his two brief scenes as the American Mafioso Angelo Bruno who partners up with the Krays.  Taron Egerton (Kingsman: The Secret Service, Testament of Youth) has maybe four lines and a few knowing smirks and manic giggles as Edward ""Mad Teddy"" Smith, one of Ronnie Kray's gangster cronies who was, like him, gay and more than a bit mental. In truth, about the only other actor who gets any decent screen-time and dialogue is David Thewlis (The Theory of Everything, various Harry Potter films) as Leslie Payne, the Kray's business manager and fixer/arranger for their clubs and more legitimate dealings. Emily Browning (Sucker Punch, The Uninvited), however, is lumbered by being made something of an questionable narrator of events as Frances Shea, Reggie's girlfriend and later wife, and while given a lot of exposition to relate, is never really developed as a believable character.

It's a pity that Helgeland didn't follow Pearson's book more closely, not only for accuracy and perspective but also because there are a lot of anecdotes about the Krays that would've made for great scenes and a much better film. If you really want to get a handle on who the Krays were and what they were like, I strongly recommend Pearson's book.

Recommended for Tom Hardy's impressive double performance as both Reggie and Ronnie Kray, but something of a mixed bag otherwise.",1449792000,10,4363,4.923809523809524

7542898,3,B0189Y6HHI,"This movie is fantastic to look at, well acted, and its source material is nothing less than fascinating. However, the script falls short, keeping the movie from being as great as it could have been. Characters are poorly defined and are never given an opportunity to endear the audience to them. Thus when things start to get dramatic, it's hard to really care one way or the other what happens to them. Additionally, there is a jarring amount of narration over the movie, constantly telling rather than showing.
Despite its shortcomings, I would say Tom Hardy's incredible performances as the Kray twins is makes it worth a watch. The rest of the film unfortunately just doesn't fulfill all the potential it shows.",1526169600,,716,4.877049180327869

7542911,3,B0189Y6HHI,"I'll take the liberty of comparing this film to the previous film starring the Kemp brothers, which has a different approach but is equally flawed, though for different reasons. Both depict Frances Shea as physically as well as emotionally frail, but looking at photographs of her we can see that she was fairly robust, whatever her psychological state. Both try to encapsulate her relationship with Reggie in cringe-making 'symbolic' dialogue. In the older film there's Frances' fear of crocodiles and here we have the philosophy of lemon sherbets. Reggie had been courting her for about 5 years when they married. Neither film captures Ronnie's character. Yes, he could be funny, apparently, but he was prone to irrational outbursts of extreme violence that had nothing to do with self-preservation. Both films pretty much ignore the twins' older brother Charlie but he was a part of the equation.
Historical accuracy matters to me. If it doesn't to you, fine. Different strokes.  Reggie did not kill Jack the Hat in front of a roomful of people, nor was the murder the result of a sudden whim but well-planned, at least up to a point. Far from being surprised by it, Ronnie had been goading his twin to kill someone ever since he shot Cornell (who did not have the teddy boy pompadour he sports here) in the Blind Beggar (which is not down a side street but on the Whitechapel Rd).Nipper Read was not/isn't the kneejerk Cockney hater shown here but a soft-spoken, intelligent man. Did Reggie really get Ronnie out by nobbling the shrink? Would anyone have believed that Ronnie was a shining example of sanity?
It's bad enough to have the film's narration spoken by a dead person but when that dead person quotes a John Lennon song written two years after her death.... (and inappropriately)! Then she makes a sociological comment on the relationship between the aristocracy and criminals. I'm not saying Frances wouldn't have been intelligent enough to see the parallels, I just think it unlikely that she would have expressed it in the language of a university professor.
So what's good about this? The performances. Tom Hardy makes a convincing Reggie, and even though I don't think his Ronnie resembles the real man, the illusion  that this is two people instead of one actor is well sustained. Emily Browning, Chazz Palminteri, Christopher Eccleston and David Thewlis do their best with a not always satisfying script, and in a smaller role, Paul Anderson looks a lot like the real Albert Donaghue. It's enjoyable enough, but calling it 'Legend' doesn't entitle the makers to take liberties with the truth. The pubs and clubs of the 60s East End are well depicted but the film doesn't really give us an idea of why the Krays have become a part of East End folklore.",1522540800,,2772,4.870762711864407

Through his nuanced portrayal of the two criminal mastermind twins, the viewer is able to follow who is who through his meticulous preparation and attention to detail. The scenes where the two interact (keep in mind Hardy plays both) are executed masterfully, and Legend really does but this aspect under the spot light. Unfortunately coming into this I expected a slightly more plot driven film, and here there is no grand plan, no heists or the type of excitement we saw from Hardy's  crime-drama series Peaky Blinders, which was what attracted me to this film.

7542952,5,B0189Y6HHI,Tom Hardy is brilliant as the Kray Brothers. He pulls off both parts with genius. His portrayal of these two real life British is right on the mark. This is not the first movie about the Krays. The 1990 movie the Krays starring twins Martin and Gary Kemp was excellent but Hardy outshines the original by a mile. Legend is a must have for every movie lover and collector and if you can find the 1990 version then you will be ahead of the game.,1509667200,2,443,4.223529411764706

I honestly think he did an amazing job, playing both main characters, as well. He makes you feel as if you're watching actual twins (2 separate people), when he in fact, is playing both.

7542962,1,B0189Y6HHI,"Another glorification of the thug life for all of today's little thug sycophants. The thing about the Kray's of this world is that they're fundamentally misunderstood. They're not the dregs of society like the Helgelands that enshrine them and lead worship to them, or all the ""nobles"" and ""celebrities"" that feed at their trough like insects or bacterial slime. No, they are far more than that. They are society's cancers and cysts. Parasites that kill life, including their own. They ought to be treated as such and promptly forgotten. This unseemly memorialization is as revolting as it is unhealthy. I suppose it is the closest thing to beauty of which the Helgelands and Boyles and Tarantinos can conceive bitter clinging nihilists that they are. And I suppose their commercial success is testament to the cowardice and weakness of the rest of us. Can we not do better? Can we not enshrine and reverence honesty and compassion and love and beauty and purity instead? Are we all that debased and impotent? Can we not turn from these banal cinematic orgies of emptiness and find something of genuine substance in which to delight ourselves?",1506643200,2,1143,4.958333333333333

This movie started out horrible and got worse from there. I blame this disaster on the director Brian Helgeland, who I can't believe directed 'Payback', one of my all time favorite movies. I figure he has either a brain tumor or he has destroyed himself with drugs and alcohol or just became arrogant and lazy like Clint Eastwood did, figures he'll coast on his past accomplishments while throwing out crap and calling it a masterpiece. If Ron Howard or Quintin Tarantino directed this film it would of been a masterpiece, man up Helgeland, and show some pride in your work man.",1493596800,,728,4.564885496183206

Knowing the accents were heavy I enabled the subtitle option, though I do this with regular English speaking movies because either the actors are speaking too rapidly, mumble, or there is background noise (all of which should have been correcting by looping before the flick was in the can so to speak). But i digress...my favorite is Ronnie. He may be crazy, but he tells the truth and his word is his bond, Ronnie, not so much. Give it a go-use English subtitles and you may have to watch it a few times. I was rolling with laughter at two of Ronnie's lines/dialogue-proper gunfight and glass houses is all I will say so as not to spoil it for you. Also his insight into mental illness-when he talks to Francis about being a ghost. So, in conclusion, pay attention, this is more than just a gangster shoot 'em up movie, there is more to this movie than you would think. Kudos to the writer!",1486771200,,944,4.46242774566474

No matter the performance, he never fails to become completely other, and his turn as twins Ronnie and Reggie Kray in Legend, is no exception.  One actor, two totally different characters.

He is quite good at all three.  The movie also manages to send shout-outs to films like Goodfellas and Scarface.  Believe it or not the film is pretty funny in some spots as well.

It's astonishing that anyone could screw up this story so badly. Legend is filled with a wall-to-wall exposition voiceover, which I'm sure the studio forced upon the filmmakers. You learn nothing about the Krays. It's just an excuse for Hardy to show off, but even the doubling effect comes across as cheap and crummy. Hardy is decent as the more restrained Reggie, but as Ronnie, it's all screaming and special effects--like if his outstanding performance in Bronson was terrible. Not even the fine efforts of Christopher Eccleston, Paul Bettany, or David Thewlis could save this boring, cliched mess.

Afterwards, I went on Netflix and watched The Krays, starring Gary and Martin Kemp (aka the twins from Spandau Ballet). Now THAT is a Kray Bros movie. Save your money and watch The Krays. Legend is a waste of time, money, and effort from a lot of extremely talented individuals.",1471824000,,1021,4.801136363636363

He is a top notch actor... it was like watching two totally different actors playing the roles. He play twins... and you forget that. He is that good. you forget that its the same guy playing both parts... they are so different in so many ways... its like watching real life twins who are total opposites in the way they act ,move, think. He especially does a perfect job on how he talks... the bad one talks scary... or I should say the worst one (of the twins) ... He actually sounds different... and his speech is different and his gestures are different... its nothing short of a ACADEMY AWARD PERFORMANCE.",1469836800,,723,4.526717557251908

7543235,4,B0189Y6HHI,"The film is an interesting take on the legend of the Kray Twins, ""London's Gangster Princes"".  From the perspective of Frances Shea, Beau of Reggie Kray, but the gangster stuff  is more front and center.  The trailer paints the film as a gangster flick with more of a heavy police presence.  Christopher Eccleston is very underused.  The plot like most gangster films, the build up, the peak, and the fall.  The movie has all of these, and is a little boring in its exucuition.  The thing that saves it is the Kray Brothers as played by Tom Hardy, Reggie the prototypical gangster with real dreams of power, and Ronnie his openly gay, insane, violent twin.  These performances steal the movie, and they even pull of a convincing fight scene.

This was a real disappointment.  I have always been fascinated by the Krays and think that Tom Hardy is one of the greatest action actors of today.  I first saw him in the TV adaptation of Martina Cole's The Take.  His performance here is a real reminder of how good he is in the London crime arena.

Sad thing is that they could have done so much more with this film.  The story didn't go far enough in any one direction to really stand out.  As a film, it is barely memorable.",1465776000,,560,4.12962962962963

The accent, which my Father-in-law from England says was very authentic, is very hard to understand. So turning on sub-titles really saved this for us.

While the movie was ok, it never really went anywhere. Major antagonists, who I thought would play a larger role, were just dismissed from the movie in a 5 second clip by commenting that he went to jail. Really? We couldn't have made that more interesting?

They really seemed like 2 different people. Was wild to view which one was which. But the movie was not that entertaining overall so 3 stars.  Guess a 5 star for any historical value.  Guy Richie London gangster and the Martin Scorsese gangster (including Casino) movies are more entertaining and powerful story-wise with more character development.  But I wanted to see the movie for the twins anyway.  I look for people who live by kindness, tolerance, compassion, a gentler way of looking at things. These movies try to explain that these characters have a distorted view of kindness, tolerance, and compassion; if any views at all.

7543298,3,B0189Y6HHI,"This film is noteworthy for a fine performance by Tom Hardy (Mad Max: Fury Road) who plays real life gangster twins of Londons 1960s.  Reggie Kray is somewhat more normal than his schizophrenic gay brother Ronnie.  Together they run a large portion of the citys crime kingdom.  And of course they want more.  Reggie falls for his drivers (Colin Morgan) sister Frances (Emily Browning, Pompeii) and they eventually get married, much to the chagrin of pouty Ronnie, who doesnt care for the lass.  But it wouldnt matter who the girl was.  She would be taking away time from his brother.

Hardys take on Reggie is pretty conventional.  His depiction of Ronnie emphasizes a different posture, gait and speech.  On the later, Im reminded of Marlon Brandos Vito Corleone.  Hardy has his mouth packed with something that induces a flurry of mumbling that makes much of his dialog indecipherable.  The film takes on a familiar beat under Brian Helgelands direction and script.  The boys own a night club which provides cover for their underworld activities.  Frances wants Reggie to go straight, something he promises to do.  That lasts a few days.

The real story is about the brothers commitment to each other and how it takes precedence over everything else.  Christopher Eccleston (TVs The Leftovers) plays Nipper Read, the cop determined to bring the boys to justice.  Taron Egerton (Eddie the Eagle) plays Ronnies boy toy.  There isn't much going on in the way of criminal activity.  Rather, the film spends much of its 132 minutes polishing Hardys growing acting acumen.  It rings more as a psychological drama between twin brothers who just happen to be callous gangsters.",1463875200,,1671,4.963898916967509

7543323,5,B0189Y6HHI,"The Title for this film is very appropriate. The Kray Brothers  Reginald and Ronnie Kray  are and always will be the stuff of modern legend. Masters of self-promotion, if not unwittingly, and rubbing elbows with politicians and members of the jet set, they were as so aptly portrayed in this movie, blood-thirsty, psychotic, thugs.

Kudos to Tom Hardy who masterly portrayed both brothers, the clinically insane Ronnie and the merely psychotic Reggie. He was able to convincingly pull off the nuances and individual quirks in their individual, diseased minds. He was also able to do the impossible, at times make the viewer feel sorry for the poor blokes but always be interested in their characters.

There have been comments in some of the reviews that the movie ran too slow. I disagree. The emphasis in this film is to dissect the personalities of each brother. While it would have made for a boring movie if that was the only theme, the director very wisely interjects just the right amount of ultra-violence every now and then to even out the playing field when it comes to what made the brothers tick. They were all about exerting control and getting what they wanted, even if meant cracking some heads to get it, though they exercised that control differently.

In this respect this movie is very different from the other film about the Kray Brothers, simply called The Krays. The 1990 film (I cant believe director Peter Medak had the cajones to make that film while Ronnie was still alive!) focused more on their violent natures, and is very much a cult-ish film. Legend, on the other hand, will probably only go down as fine gangster movie with great acting from everyone involved  which, indeed, it is.

Having said that, an American viewer will probably have some trouble following the dialogue, especially from Tom Hardy. Hardy, and the rest of the actors, lay on that East End accent a bit thick. If I had any suggestion at all it would be to supply subtitles!

Still, its a great movie that should not be missed.",1462838400,,2028,4.7578347578347575
7543324,3,B0189Y6HHI,"Any movie should be able to stand on its own, independent of whatever source material or basis in historical fact it has. Keeping that in mind, I'm not terribly concerned with LEGEND's historical accuracy. More importantly, does it efficiently tell an interesting story? I'm a bit mixed on that element, but there is no denying that, however gimmicky the decision was, Tom Hardy killed it in his double role as Reggie and Ronnie Kray, gangsters from London's East End. No matter what flaws the film has, and there are more than a few, LEGEND is worth at least one viewing for Tom Hardy alone, who seems to choose projects where he can shine as an actor, regardless of whether the material deserves it, or his supporting cast is given much to do. I thought he did a great job differentiating the two performances, although the actor's bag of tricks was more obvious with his choices for Ronnie (fake teeth, glasses, accent, etc.). The next most engaging character was Emily Browning as Frances Shea, Reggie's wife, who also serves as the film's omniscient narrator. What initially seems like an oddball choice actually makes sense later on, although divulging why would be a spoiler (for those unfamiliar with the history, which I was). The film also has gorgeous cinematography, immaculate production design, and a well-chosen soundtrack full of 1960's pop tunes. It's these last few things, outside of the gangster genre, tie it to something to which it never quite lives up, i.e., Martin Scorsese's own forays into gangster pictures. One would have to be completely ignorant of cinema to miss parallels between LEGEND, and Scorsese's GOODFELLAS and CASINO. Director Brian Helgeland clearly shows affection for those films, but nothing he does here rises above the level of simple homage or, in a few cases, outright theft. Just to provide a few examples, Reggie and Ronnie's relationship has shades of key relationships in GOODFELLAS and CASINO, and Ronnie at times seems like a riff on Joe Pesci's character from those films (with homosexuality thrown in for good measure). There's also a wedding scene set to the Dixie Cups' ""Chapel of Love"" and a scene late in the film which is kind of like the ""Get your shinebox!"" scene in GOODFELLAS. Again, there's nothing inherently wrong with lifting elements or paying homage to previous films, which is something that happens all of the time. For it to work, there needs to be some fresh perspective or take on it, and I don't think that Helgeland ever does that. Outside of the Krays' contentious relationship with each other, there was no unifying theme to drive forward what was a rather unfocused narrative, often feeling like a collection of scenes instead of a coherent story. In short, it was like a jewel-encrusted plastic crown. There's also the issue of the title, which I don't think it earned. Nothing in the film would suggest that the Krays were ""legends,"" and merely asserting it as fact was insufficient. All of this being said, there definitely is an audience for this film and I have a feeling like they (including myself) will want to see it at least once. It doesn't compare favorably to its cinematic forebears, but there is enough good in it to make a loose recommendation.",1462838400,,3242,4.885662431941924

7543357,2,B0189Y6HHI,"Although I was not familiar with the London gangs of the 60s, I was looking forward to an entertaining gangster movie.  Unfortunately, I got a disjointed pretty poorly written story.  Tom Hardys acting is decent in the dual role but the story almost seems a bit comical at times instead of an action packed gangster movie.  In fact, there isn't a lot of action through the movie and there is very little detail in how the Krays took over London as it seems to be glossed over in a few brief scenes.  Instead the movie seems to focus more of the romance of Reggie Kray and the downfall of that romance.  Even that part of the story seems to be lacking as there was very little told about the relationship that would lead me to believe that Frances would suddenly start popping pills and get depressed because he is a gangster, which is something she knew before she married him and drew her to Reggie in the first place.  This movie to me doesnt have enough of a gritty feel and at times seems confused at what it is trying to be.  The story is slow and boring at times as well.  I was definitely expected more out of this movie and if it wasn't for Hardys portrayals of the brothers, I would have stopped watching halfway through.  Unfortunately Hardys portrayals of the Krays couldn't save a subpar script that lacked much in the way of what a gangster movie should be and lacking in the qualities that would make it compelling to watch.

Did the movie not delve far enough into the Krays and their subordinates?  An English Goodfellas this is NOT.  I bought this, expecting a mob movie.  Instead the film is a slower family drama with some crime sprinkled in.

Tom Hardy as Reggie was excellent, but his portrayal of the lunatic Ronnie made me giggle.  Ronnie seemed like a Muppet with homosexual tendencies.  He spoke like a giant choking Beeker, and I doubt the real guy sounded this way.

Furthermore, if this movie depicted the worse that these two ever did, Americans are going to find this movie TAME.  Our Italian gangsters committed heinous crimes weekly.  These guys?  They murder one person and the country supposedly goes bonkers in hysteria?  Come on.

Where's the violence?  Where are the crime syndicates?  Where are the turf wars?  It seems like the Krays just took over by saying they take over!  If five Italian Americans had become Englishmen, the whole of London would have been a hybrid of Las Vegas and New York.

Anyway, I enjoyed the acting--even Beeker sometimes--and the family drama.  Legend was a slow, interesting movie.  But not a crime drama.

7543450,5,B0189Y6HHI,"How Tom Hardy wasn't nominated for best lead AND supporting actor after viewing Legend, I have no idea.

 I also own the movie The Krays, starring the (real life) Kemp brothers as Reggie and Ronnie Kray and I feel that both movies are well done, yet show very different views of the Krays and their story. The Krays (movie) focused a great deal on the brother's mother and aunt's influence in shaping their lives early on.  Legend however, barely acknowledged their mother at all (which I found a bit odd).  The Krays (movie) focused a great deal on both brother's ""activities"" within the firm.  Legend meanwhile, focused more on Reggie and his relationship with his wife Francis (and the effects of that marriage on the brother's relationship).  In Legend, the movie is narrated by Francis, so I suppose it makes sense that it would be slanted a bit more towards Reg.

Something I found interesting in the movie The Krays, Ronnie (played by Gary Kemp) is portrayed as openly homosexual, in complete control of his mental faculties but with a hair trigger temper and very prone to violence. Reggie (played by Martin Kemp) is portrayed (I thought) as taking a bit more of a backseat and letting Ronnie run a good deal of the show.  Conversely, Legend shows Reggie as the brains behind the firm and struggling to keep Ronnie and his schizophrenia under some sort of control.  Legend also addresses Ronnie's open homosexuality and ""deviant, men only"" parties that included several top politicians of the day. Unlike The Krays (movie) Legend delves into Ronnie's documented mental illness and how it added to the violent circus that followed him around (and ultimately was his undoing). The Krays movie never indicates that Ronnie has anything more than a violent temper.

Both movies are top notch, but I'd have to categorize The Krays as perhaps being a touch more ""Hollywood"" in the way some things were glossed over. I did think the story about their mother (Violet) and aunt Rose was an important aspect of influence in their childhood.  Tom Hardy was truly amazing the way he was able to portray both men as looking alike, yet managing to define them as  individuals. There are still things that neither movie got right, or just plain omitted, but I don't think either movie glorified the brothers in the way that say The Godfather glorified the mafia. I would recommend Legend (and The Krays) to anyone interested in the Kray brothers, just remember to take it all with a grain or two of salt.

One thing I wish the powers that be would rectify is the annoying fact that the movie The Krays STILL is NOT available on DVD in region 1 areas (North America and Canada). If you want to discover that cinema gem, you must have access to a VHS tape player (one of the few VHS tapes I held onto when I switched over to DVD).

In LEGEND, Hardy plays both Kray twins in this based-on-true-life story of their rise in London's underworld. Written and directed by Brian Helgeland, who I love for his written by/directed by/produced by roles in A KNIGHT'S TALE, this film was a fun, sometimes violent, glimpse of a world most of us wouldn't otherwise know. But it is Hardy's incredible versatility and believability as each brother that makes it a film that should not be missed. Here's where I confess I usually don't care for one actor playing more than one part; in fact, learning that about a film usually means now that I pass on it. However, Hardy pulls off the task with eloquence and precision. Would love to see him in a one-person show where he plays a number of parts.",1459123200,,911,4.6645962732919255

There was obviously a budget but it is wasted on splash. They could have dropped a few more dollars on trying to have the two Hardys color blend. Supporting actors are second rate cartoons. What's with gummy mummy Rose - a central character in the real story? Here she makes tea and cake. The story did not need Hollywood embellishment. He gland turns Hardy into Ham.

7543549,3,B0189Y6HHI,"Brian Helgeland both wrote the screenplay (based on John Pearsons book) and directed this mobster movie. The sole attraction (aside form a fine performance by Emily Browning) is the tick of using actor Tom Hardy to play both roles of the twins  and for that reason it is worth watching.
The film tells the story of the identical twin gangsters Reggie and Ronnie Kray (Tom Hardy in a duplicitous role), two of the most notorious criminals in British history, and their organized crime empire in the East End of London during the 1960s. Focusing on the relationship between Reggie Kray and Frances Shea (Emily Browning), the film is told from France's' point of view as someone who knew him best, as well as the mental health issues the same sex life that Ronnie Kray faced and their rise to power as the notorious gangsters of London.

There are some fine roles for Christopher Eccleston, Tara Fitzgerald, Nicholas Farrell, and Joshua Hill, but the entire production is overlong, consistent fighting, and not a lot of character development. But the overriding problem of this film is that is nearly unintelligible due to the thick East Ender accents the actors use. Tom Hardy does a fine job as both twins (very different in nature) but he too is almost impossible to understand. Fortunately on DVD there are English subtitles so we can understand the dialogue.

7543561,4,B0189Y6HHI,"The story of the notorious Kray twins, Legend stars Tom Hardy (and Tom Hardy) as Reggie and Ronnie Kray, and features Emily Browning as Frances Shea, Reggie's teenage love interest and, later, his wife. The Krays -- and their gang The Firm -- were major gangland figures in London in the 1950s and 1960s, catering to peers and celebrities as well as lowlifes. For a brief period, the brothers became celebrities in their own right until it all came crashing down and they went to jail for life terms for two murders.

Legend is less about the Kray's rise to and fall from power than it tries to be about the tortured relationship between the more cerebral and suave Reggie and his brutish, paranoid schizophrenic brother Ronnie. As written and directed by Brian Helgeland (LA Confidential) and as well-played by Hardy, the Krays are nearly two parts of one person, where Ronnie is all Id and Reggie is Superego. Ronnie is perfectly happy being what he is -- violent, impulsive, instantly generous, and openly homosexual -- while Reggie is more sophisticated, forward-thinking, and self-contained. But Reggie's veneer of sophistication and self-control wears thin, and in the end he seals his own fate with the brutal knifing of a hapless gang member.

The cast is uniformly excellent, none more so than Tom Hardy, who manages the task of creating two distinctively different identical twins superbly well. Also excellent is Emily Browning as Reggie's wife Frances. Browning is luminously beautiful, but she shows us there is much more to Frances, who is usually portrayed as a hapless victim. In Browning's capable hands, Frances is a self-assured, cheeky, teen who knows what she wants and skilfully gets it. In the end, though she is overwhelmed by her situation and addiction to pills, she still controls her own exit, by suicide, as a last statement to the man she loves and hates with equal passion.

Though Legend does not quite manage to give us full insight into the Kray twins, it's more the fault of the script than the actors. All in all, Legend is a great recreation of a bygone era when gangsters and peers rubbed shoulders in swinging London, anchored by solid performances throughout.",1458432000,3,2199,4.905913978494624

He's good at it and portrays a wide variety of characters within this spectrum and here he does play two very different British Gangsters, but this movie suffers from a few issues. The twins are frequently on screen together, but often the contrast on one is different than the other, or the green screen insert is fairly obvious messing with the suspension of disbelief. Also, the big twist towards the end felt like a cheap trick to me and left me with questions about their framing device. The story is long and rambling and left me vaguely unsatisfied. I'm not sorry I saw it, but I'm not going to see it again or recommend anyone else see it.",1458259200,2,741,4.578947368421052

7543660,5,B0189Y6HHI,"Tom Hardy lives the characters he plays. Subtle movement of an eyebrow, puzzled worried glances when confounded by a new heartfelt pain, the power in a simple shrug warning an aggressor, 'don't make a mistake here.' He breaks down, in ""Legend,"" the complexities of insanity in two maniacal brothers, so a simple viewer like me is stunned by a tiny slice of a soul revealed.

Tom Hardy is a master, surrounded by an excellent cast, working a fascinating story.",1457913600,,459,4.810126582278481

7543664,4,B0189Y6HHI,"Tom Hardy does an excellent job in this movie playing twin brothers.  Honestly, if I hadn't known going in that Tom Hardy was playing both characters, I wouldn't have known.  Ok, ok, I'm blabbering.  Let me compose myself.
This movie centers around twin brothers Ronnie and Reggie Kray who were real-life 60's London gangsters.  Reggie is a good looking, former boxer with aspirations to go legit.  Ronnie is a homosexual sadistic psychopath who has spent time in a psychiatric prison. They rule the London underworld with an iron fist.  Just the mere mention of the 'Kray Brother's' will put fear enough fear in most people that the Brother's have their every wish granted.  The brother's love each other and feel a deep connection to one another.  At the same time, Ronnie is jealous of Reggie's good looks and his girlfriend (Frances) and Reggie is resentful of Ronnie's mental issues constantly getting in the way of the dreams Reggie has.

I tell you this movie is a great watch. I was afraid it was going to be 'campy' like a lot of movies are that try to have one actor play more than one character but, this movie is anything but campy. Tom Hardy brings palpable fear, intimidation and nuance to the screen.
My only critique on the film would be that at times the pacing was a little slow and the accents were hard for me to understand.  This is a very memorable film and I strongly suggest it.",1457913600,,1402,4.594377510040161

7543666,4,B0189Y6HHI,"I very much liked this film, and was anxious because the 1990 film the Krays has always been a favorite. Tom Hardy did an excellent job of differentiating Reggie and Ron. Ron's character reminded me a bit of his role as Bronson. There was a bit of disappointing theatrical license in the character of Reggie's wife Frances, as I've seen lots of documentaries and read quite a bit about the 'Firm'.

- You can't understand many parts of many conversations
- The crazy brother's accent was horrible.
- Extremely slow paced w/ tone issues.

The trailer is by far the best part of this movie. This is a cash grab movie for Tom Hardy and the director clearly didn't know what he wanted this movie to be. I'm a huge fan, but this movie was a big disappointment. Don't listen to the Hardy fanboys and critics who praise every movie he's in.

7543807,3,B0189Y6HHI,"The primary possibly lone reason to see this film is for Tom Hardy's superlative turn as the Krays, twin brothers who amassed a crime empire in Sixties London before it swung.  Hardy imbues Reggie and Ronnie with distinct personalities and characteristics so much so that even when shown in the same frame you think you are watching two people instead of a split screen image.  One jaw dropping scene involves fisticuffs between the brothers making you scratch your head wondering how they did that.  The Krays are Michael and Sonny Corleone on their worst day.  Superlatives aside Hardy's efforts are mostly undermined by the work of director-screenwriter Brian Helgeland.  The direction and script is barely cohesive.  There's no backstory or explanation as to how the Krays  maintained a grip on their criminal interests and with the exception of Emily Browning as Reggie's wife Frances none of the supporting players make a visceral impact.  In 1990 a film starring brothers Gary and Martin Kemp called ""The Krays"" was released.  Not a classic but I would give it the edge over Helgeland's film by virtue of a stunning turn by Billie Whitelaw as the most lethal gangster mum this side of Livia Soprano.  Ironically Mama Kray is given short shrift in ""Legend"".",1457222400,11,1263,4.9714285714285715

7543821,4,B0189Y6HHI,"""The Queen would survive, but God save the rest of us."" London in the 1960's was run by two twin gangsters, Reggie and Ron Kray (Hardy). Nothing happened without them knowing or allowing it. Reggie was calculating and deadly while Ron was a little psychotic and unstable. Eventually they only thing that could challenge their reign was each other. As many of you know by now I am a HUGE fan of gangster and mafia movies. I was looking forward to this one for that reason. I like Tom Hardy but never really got all the hype around him, until now. He was so good in this that it almost actually hurt the movie. He plays both brothers perfectly and to the point of you forgetting its the same actor. The dialog and intonation of his voice is even different. I've never seen anything like it and half the time I was staring at them, going back and forth trying to see similarities and failing. It also made me wonder if the movie would have been as good if it had not been for him. What it came down to was it doesn't matter, he is in it and I was just mesmerized by his acting in this. I say distracting because as good as this movie was all I could talk about was his performance, that isn't a bad thing though. Overall, this is a movie that I really enjoyed and highly recommend but the reason to watch is for the dual role played by Hardy. I give this movie a high B+.",1456444800,5,1368,4.1856060606060606
7543822,4,B0189Y6HHI,"The English have found a replacement for Jason Statham, Jude Law, and Clive Owen...his name is Tom Hardy,  I would not be surprised at all - if in the near future he will become the next agent of his majesty, the one and only, legendary spy--007.  Legend (2015) feels like another Guy Ritchie's cinematic piece...it is vulgar, it is brutal, it is cheeky, and it definitely is gangster related.

Legend is based on real life twin brothers, Reggie and Ron, who back in the 1960's London were the dominant force in the criminal underground of the so called East End.  Big props for Tom Hardy and his dual portrayal of the twins...it must have taken a lot to play two totally different opposites of each other.  But I was also positively affected by the acting of Emily Browning.  She has a remarkable face. I think she is really beautiful and her petite body stature adds even more allure to her looks.

The story is worth 1 star. The acting is worth another 2-3 stars. Additional plus for the rare selection of Motown 60's music.  Good choices.",1456185600,2,1042,4.564516129032258
7543823,3,B0189Y6HHI,"The notorious gangsters of Sixties London, Ronnie and Reggie Kray, have proved a popular subject in the movies, most notably in Peter Medak's film of 1990 when the parts were played by the Kemp twins.

This updated version contains a remarkable tour de force by Tom Hardy who plays both twins and manages to establish a clear personality difference between the two. Ronnie Kray is a homosexual with clear personality disorders; always overshadowed by his brother, he becomes pathological when Reggie is put away in prison. He is also the more vulnerable of the two, with a close attachment to his mother (Jane Wood). Reggie is a smooth operator with a violent streak, which he tries to cover up. Falling in love with Frances Shea (Emily Browning), he vows to give up the criminal existence for good, but we know that will never happen.

Told from Frances's perspective, Brian Helgeland's film portrays the evil attractiveness of the gangster's life; the ability to exercise power and dominate others through intimidation. We understand why the Krays were so mythologized in the Sixties, as they hob-nobbed with the great and the good while keeping tight control of their 'manor' in London's East End.

Yet whether the film has more to say about the twins than we already know is debatable. The Sixties atmosphere has been competently re- created, even though Soho tends to look like a reject from Julien Temple's ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS (1986). The script has more than its share of plot-clich&eacute;s, especially the twins' love of their mother, and the dogged cop Nipper Read (Christopher Eccleston) who pursues the Krays in a far too shiny-looking Ford Prefect without actually getting anywhere near them.

Some of the supporting performances are overtly camp, to say the least. John Sessions's Lord Boothby has distinct echoes of an aging Quentin Crisp, while Kevin McNally's Harold Wilson has little of the down-to-earth pragmatism of the former Prime Minister.

The film has a certain macabre attraction, but not much else.",1454803200,4,2025,5.087349397590361
7543824,5,B0189Y6HHI,"A career best performance for Tom Hardy.. Absolutely electrifying acting..

The film tells the story of the identical twin gangsters Reggie and Ronnie Kray, two of the most notorious criminals in British history, and their organised crime empire in the East End of London during the 1960s.

You don't need to be a fan of the Krays story or gangster movies to absolutely love this movie (but it helps of course) this is a fascinating story and a great insight into these iconic villains from the 60's, the movie has a stunning cast all round, Emily Browning is absolutely beautiful and a fantastic young actress, Christopher Eccleston plays police head of the investigation into the Krays, but no doubt Tom Hardy steals every moment of this movie with his electric performance of both the Kray twins, such a fine star in probably his greatest role yet, he lights up the screen with so much life to both these characters making them unique like we have never seen them before, very entertaining for all the wrong reasons of course, these were bad men doing bad things, the movie is very violent at times, very funny all the time, great memorable dialogue, its very Tarantino now and again, this is one of the best movies of 2015 for sure, a must see, powerful performances from a stunning cast alone make this essential viewing! The movie has amazing effects, having two Toms must have been a long process but it was worth it, the 60's settings look very authentic and the soundtrack is great too, you cant go wrong!

Running time 2 hours 11 minutes
