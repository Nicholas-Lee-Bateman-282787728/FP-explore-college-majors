2509481,4,B000E8N5EQ,"First off, to anyone who buys this set, the show ""Bar None"" first show on disk two, is messed up. I had the set replaced and the same show had problems. the show froze after about 15 minutes.
Besides that little problem the rest like all 5 seasons out, is great.",1214870400,2,262,4.1568627450980395
2509482,5,B000E8N5EQ,"Great series on home improvement projects gone wrong, then made right by the Make It Right contractor, Mike Holmes.  Utilizing real case scenarios, the show educates anybody considering hiring a contractor to do work on their property how to evaluate that contractor to prevent disasters to your finances and home; how to spot tell tale signs of poor workmanship; how best to handle the payment process, etc.  The best part comes when Mike, the hottest contractor in overalls, & his boys rip out the junk job and re-do the project the right way, explaining how it's done.  In the end, the poor people ripped off are made right by beautiful, skilled craftsmanship - the way it should have been done originally.  Good entertainment for men and almost like porn for women - Mike & The Boys are great eye candy.",1179532800,4,807,4.742857142857143

8107145,5,B000E8N5EQ,"Great selection and worth the time to view this video.  I find that the attitude of ""do it right"" further motivates and educates me for working on my own house of over 100 years age.",1422921600,,182,4.2
8107146,5,B000E8N5EQ,Holmes on homes is one of the better home improvement shows. It shows some of the shady tricks some contactors will pull when doing a job. I find the show helpful when I plan remodeling on my house.,1411516800,,198,4.2368421052631575
8107147,5,B000E8N5EQ,"Watched on cable so got this as a gift for my son the carpenter, because he loves Holmes' shows. Even non handymen  can learn a lot just watching.",1391472000,,146,4.214285714285714

8107151,5,B000E8N5EQ,"Mike Holmes is amazing.  He takes people's construction problems and not only solves them, but fixes other problems he sees while he is doing his original fix-up.  Only if all constractors were like him...",1262995200,,205,5.0
8107152,5,B000E8N5EQ,"Mike Holmes is Canada's premiere fix it guy. When previously a contractor has done shoddy work, and the homeowner is at wits end Mike and his crew step up to the plate and ""make it right"". If you live in the U S it may take you a few episodes to figure out that ""eves troughs"" are rain gutters LOL! but, Mike always goes above ""minimum code"" and I enjoy watching how he takes a botched repair and redesigns and reworks it so every thing is perfect. I have episodes 1 through 5 and I can't wait for 6 & 7 to be released. You can learn from these DVD's as well as be entertained by Mikes wit and the interactions of the crew members",1228521600,2,630,4.048
