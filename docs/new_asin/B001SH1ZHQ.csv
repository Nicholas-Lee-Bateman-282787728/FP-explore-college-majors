3785690,5,B001SH1ZHQ,"Harlem Aria is not a new film.  When it was first released, it won every audience award in the country where it was shown.  For some reason I'll never understand, it was not released widely at that time.  It's a wonderful story with terrific actors and a heartwarming ending.  It's also fun to see, and the music is marvelous.  The main character is a young black man who has a special gift -- he is able to sing operatic arias with a beautiful voice although he is unable to take care of himself fully.  He resents his aunt's guardianship enough to run away to Washington Square Park in NYC in a tuxedo his neighborhood drug pusher gave him.  The rest of the movie is about how his talent is received and exploited by a couple of street performers.  It's great.",1304640000,2,762,4.392857142857143
3785691,5,B001SH1ZHQ,This is a cute movie. It's not a serious movie but it's really funny.  Damon Wayans' accent is terrible lol and the slow guy (sorry I don't know his name) could have at least tried to make it look like he was really singing but overall it's a good movie,1301702400,,253,4.06
3785692,5,B001SH1ZHQ,I saw this film at the 2009 Woodstock Film Festival.  It was one of the best pictures I have ever seen.  We were able to meet and ask quesstions of the director after the show.  He and the wonderful cast has produced a real winner.  Don't miss this one.  Connie Morris,1269216000,,268,4.176470588235294
