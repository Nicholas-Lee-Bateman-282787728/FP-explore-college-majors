8464666,5,B002BGG46K,"HOT ROD SURF  Pinstriping Techniques Volume 2 is the follow up movie to the Hot Rod Surf  Pinstriping Techniques Learn How to Pinstripe DVD. This independently produced art movie features artist MWM's classic freehand pinstriping in the tradition of the 50's style of Von Dutch and Ed Roth. No airbrushing or stencils- all raw pinstriping with an artist and his brush. You will see the transformation of a Ford Model A rat rod as flames and pinstriping are applied to the dash, body, headlights, dash, and grill as well a deck lid trunk of a roadster being pinstriped live. This movie is for people interested in freehand classic pinstriping and the scene and style that evolves around the art.",1365984000,,694,4.823529411764706
8464667,1,B002BGG46K,Obviously this guy thinks he's good but I wasn't impressed the sad part is that he thinks he can sing too. I had to turn the volume all the way down just to even watch it. This is a good video on how NOT to stripe cars and as for the finish paint. ... well I guess its supposed to be a rat rod because the guy has no skills. Truely sad!,1342483200,,336,3.6805555555555554
