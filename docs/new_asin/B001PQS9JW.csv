8334316,5,B001PQS9JW,An excellent introduction to tribal belly dance techniques.,1454544000,,59,6.5
8334317,2,B001PQS9JW,"While the production quality of this DVD is akin to an old VHS tape, Paulette Rees-Denis does teach some basic moves in a slow fashion that almost any beginner could grasp, although I wasn't particularly impressed by her technique.  (In her defense, I am not very familiar with American Tribal Style/Community Style Belly Dancing.)  More advanced students will likely be very bored by this DVD.  I did enjoy the music.  The end performances were not particularly impressive and so repetitive and the moves so slow that I ended up watching them on fast-forward.  The upside is that if you are an absolute beginner, you will be able to follow along.",1395532800,,647,4.845454545454546
8334318,1,B001PQS9JW,"I had this originally on VHS and wanted to get the DVD version. I was really disappointed. It was choppy and didn't flow/match the original VHS tape. The  audio and screen quality was very poor. I couldn't  watch more than 5 minutes, that's how bad it was. They should have had the video digitally re-mastered.

There's  a  lot more selection/competition now for ""tribal"" belly dance.

I bought volume 1 & 2. I've not even played vol 2 that's how bad vol 1 was.",1385769600,,461,4.493975903614458
8334319,5,B001PQS9JW,"I ADORE Paulette and her company Gypsy Caravan!  I don't know them personally and I've never seen them dance live,
but I really like what I have seen on You Tube, and I have read one of her books, which I loved.  This is a great DVD.
If you are looking for something glossy and high definition, you won't find it here.  But the content is here, and it's
a great warm up and lesson.
I have been taking Tribal Belly Dance classes for a little over 2 and a half years now (not long I know)
and I still learned new things.  She is a wonderful teacher and explains and performs steps well,
so that you really can learn some moves. All the while maintaining perfect form.
I can't wait to buy all of the volumes, I'll just have to buy one at a time.",1343779200,,742,4.061643835616438
8334320,5,B001PQS9JW,You can't write a review about a product many years after it was first produced!  You compare the product to the latest thing on the market and seem surprised when it falls short!  Gypsy Caravan has been rocking the bellydance world for years and this is just the first of MANY instructional videos they made and its still better than some I've seen today!,1265500800,2,356,4.546875
8334321,3,B001PQS9JW,"Production - low budget, video looks like a bit of an old VHS & perhaps filmed years ago, sound is clear (though wish the name of the moves were written on screen), lighting is good, camera is static but far which is good, background beat seems live

As nice as Paulette Ress Denis is, she is friendly, she barely shows any personality. The basic only slow beat or basic beat with one other Middle Eastern instrument in slow pace really made this dull. I have many basic bellydance dvds & even with that, if I find a new one I like, I still do them to see/learn different instruction as well as getting new basic drills/workouts so I don't get bored with ones I already have. I couldn't with this, not in the technique or in the practice segments. The beat just did nothing for me, though it did start picking up around the 30 min mark.

Video clip on youtube under: ""Gypsy Caravan: Tribal Technique Vol 1""
Shows the very beginning of the technique portion & the horizontal torso circles from the practice.",1260835200,9,2739,4.753684210526316
