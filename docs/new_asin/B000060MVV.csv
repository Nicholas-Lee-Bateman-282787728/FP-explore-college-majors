1681358,3,B000060MVV,"THE LADY IN RED was scripted by John Sayles (director of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/EIGHT-MEN-OUT/dp/B000059TFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">EIGHT MEN OUT</a>&nbsp;- 1988) and produced by Julie Corman-- Roger's wife. Sayles' only previous movie experience was contributing the story for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PIRAHNA/dp/6305596247/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PIRAHNA</a>&nbsp;(1978), which was a product of Corman's New World Pictures.

""The Lady in Red"" is an incredibly loose biopic that depicts in part the death of John Dillinger as he exited Chicago's Biograph Theater on 7/22/34. Here's where the two stories diverge:

REALITY: Anna Sage, a friend of Dillinger's girl Polly Hamilton wore the infamous ""red"" dress (it was actually orange) that alerted Feds to his presence.

FICTION: In the film, Sage (Fletcher) tricks Polly ""Franklin"" (Martin) into wearing the colorful outfit. Never happened! With both scenarios however, Dillinger (Conrad) is cut down by a hailstorm of lead.

SYNOPSIS--
It's the story of Miss Franklin, an innocent farmgirl who moves to the big city, gets arrested and quickly falls into a life of vice (prostitution). She befriends the notorious bank robber but he's soon killed by the FBI after a night out at the movies. Franklin then considers robbing banks herself.

7957440,4,B000060MVV,"The Lady in Red is one of my favorite 'rainy day' movies.  It reflects back to the hard times of the Depression Era.  Even the good guys have it tough.

I won't duplicate the excellent comments of others except to say that the acting is superb.  And there are some great and memorable lines.  From ""You gonna get even Polly?  No, I'm gonna get ahead.""  Down to Robert Forster's last line ""Polly Franklin - sends her regards.""",1315180800,,425,4.441558441558442
