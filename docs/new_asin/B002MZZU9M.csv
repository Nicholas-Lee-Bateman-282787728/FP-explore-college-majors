8625557,1,B002MZZU9M,"""Don't order it! It's Sinister Cinema!"" That's what I said to myself just as I found that a DVD of ""Cowboy Commandos"" was available.
  Why not order it? Because all the other DVDs I have order from this company, when played, could not be seen in their original screen aspect because they had not been correctly  transferred to the DVD.
  When I watched ""Cowboy Commandos"" I had to view it in wide screen because the ""vertical screen"" option, i.e. the original aspect in which the movie was meant to be seen, was not available.
  Viewing in the wide screen makes everything look about 25% stretched. The horses look as if their legs are six inches too short. Glamorous cowgirls look as if their rear ends are twenty-five pounds too heavy. The original picture is cropped on top and bottom; side-to-side. In others words: what could have been a great viewing experience has  become a constant annoyance.
  I asked myself: ""Does anyone at your company view these DVDs before the finished product is approved for sale. Can any of you discern the obvious difference between the proper screen aspect of a standard 1943 film as opposed to what it looks like when stretched to wide screen?
  Every old cowboy movie I have purchased from a professional production company allows for it to be viewed in the proper ""vertical fit"" screen aspect in which it was intended to be seen. There is no pleasure in viewing the movies you reproduce and sell because they are distorted by ""stretching"" to wide screen.
  I know, if I spoke with you, that you would offer some excuse as to why you cannot offer a DVD showing the movie as it was meant to be seen. I always get some excuse from the non-professional purveyors of old movies telling me why they cannot do what the professional companies do. Example: Every old movie I have ordered from Oldies.com allows for it to be viewed in its proper vertical fit aspect. None of the movies are made squat by the wide-screen-stretch. If they can put out movies this way why can't you?
  I know there will be no remedy to this issue. You will keep euchring the purchaser; the buying public be damned! I must remember what I first said to myself when I saw that it was Sinister Cinema that was selling the movie. ""Don't buy it!""
  I am annoyed with myself for wasting my time and my money on an inferior product when I did know better.",1357257600,2,2358,4.54739336492891
