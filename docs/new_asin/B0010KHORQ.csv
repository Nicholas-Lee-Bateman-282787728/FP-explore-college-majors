8237982,5,B0010KHORQ,"Dennis the Menace is definitely a series that is deeply rooted in my childhood memories. When I was either eight or nine years old back in 2001, I went with my grandpa to the International Museum of Cartoon Art here in Florida (unfortunately, it has been closed for quite a while), and can vividly recall seeing the screening of an episode of DtM there (complete with the original closing credits and the 1985 DiC Vortex logo at the end). I never saw the show again until 2009, when Boomerang showed reruns of it up until about the end of March 2010. Thanks to YT and DVDs such as this one, the aficionados and supporters of DtM don't have to worry about whether or not they'll ever be able to enjoy the show again. This collection has several episodes in EXCELLENT quality; due to the presence of the 1985 DiC Vortex/1979 DFS/1986 DFS-Dorland logos at the end, it is clear that they came from the original master tapes, but it seems as though they have evidently been somewhat remastered for the most optimal audio and video quality possible (which makes sense, seeing as how 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment is a big company that can afford those kinds of retouches). All of the original footage is intact and untouched/uncut/unchanged/unaltered, from the opening sequence to the episodes themselves to the closing credits to the logos. Most certainly worth the money, and you definitely won't be disappointed if you decide to buy it.",1361577600,2,1439,4.76

8237984,5,B0010KHORQ,"This DVD has 78 minutes of Dennis the Menace cartoons. The stories are 1. Dennis in Venice, 2. Mayan Mayhem, 3. The Big Candied Apple, 4. A Royal Pain, 5. Dennis and the Kangaroo Calvary, 6. Dennis Plasters Pamplona, and 7. Black and Blue Hawaii. The cartoons would be enjoyed by the true Dennis the Menace fans as they see the featured comic strip character come to life in animation. Each story has a simple tale as Dennis travels to different countries with his parents, the Mitchells, and Mr. or Mrs. Wilson. You will not see Dennis' neighborhood friends, e.g. Margaret or Joey, in these cartoon episodes. They are only seen in the repetitive breaks (which you can fast forward) in between stories. The cartoons have good rich color and sound. Dennis' mischievousness gets him into ""trouble,"" but he proves to be a hero in the Hawaii episode when the volcano erupts. He is especially adorable with a cowboy hat and outfit in Spain. This is a wonderful DVD and is a great addition to your collection of comic/cartoon favorites.",1239840000,9,1030,4.727777777777778
