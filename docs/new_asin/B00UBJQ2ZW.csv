8705240,5,B00UBJQ2ZW,"Really enjoyed this film. It's very well done for the limited budget they obviously had to work with and is likely targeted for a younger crowd. I appreciated the fact that there wasn't blood splatter everywhere... more of a supernatural thriller instead of those typical slasher horror films that are out there. Those Guardians of the Lake are sure scary though! Good acting across the board and was really happy to see veteran actor Barry Corbin in a key supporting role. Would like to see a sequel done on a bigger budget. Overall, I'd say it is definitely worth the watch!",1513555200,,576,4.712871287128713

8705242,4,B00UBJQ2ZW,"A surprisingly enjoyable film. I liked the story and the suspence was well done in the movie. There is not alot of gore or deaths, so if that is your type of movie, then you will probably be bored. The acting was alright, the main jerk was not very good, and the villians were not shown enough, which was sad, because they were kind of creepy.",1439078400,,343,4.212121212121212
8705243,5,B00UBJQ2ZW,Loved this independent film! Pleasantly surprised by the believability of the characters. Definitely a low budget film done right.,1438819200,,130,5.894736842105263
8705244,1,B00UBJQ2ZW,"The movie was so bad, I stopped watching it after about 15 minutes. I really like to watch movies, but this one broke my will to carry on. Gratuitous nudity to start; then ludicrous music, bad editing, corny dialog, and mostly bad acting (with the exception of an old fellow who played the part of the owner of a diner). I wasted a couple of bucks and a quarter of an hour of my life. Lesson learned.",1438819200,,400,4.207792207792208
