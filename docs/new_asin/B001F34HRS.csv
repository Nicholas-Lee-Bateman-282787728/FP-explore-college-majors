3563136,4,B001F34HRS,"""The Ron Howard Spotlight Collection""  is an eight-disc box set containing four Howard-directed features, including the Best Picture Oscar winner ""Beautiful Mind,"" the story of brilliant mathematician John Nash (Russell Crowe).  The set also contains a heap of bonus extras, including an introduction by Howard himself, deleted scenes, theatrical trailers, feature commentary, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and documentaries on the real individuals portrayed.
 ""Backdraft"" is a fairly routine story about two feuding firefighter brothers (Kurt Russell, William Baldwin) who have to set aside their personal differences in order to survive the infernos set by a maniacal arsonist.  Fire is the real star, with spectacularly staged sequences that look incredibly dangerous.  Drama-wise, the movie is a familiar reworking of a classic plot and offers few surprises.
 ""Apollo 13"" is riveting drama with the all-star cast of Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, and Ed Harris. Here we have the true story of a space flight that would have ended in disaster were it not for the coordination of flight and ground crews to bring the astronauts back safely.  In the confines of a claustrophobic space capsule, Howard manages to make a tale whose outcome is known, gripping.
 ""Cinderella Man,"" a fine movie that did poorly at the box office, takes place in Depression-era America.  Down-and-out boxer Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) has a young family but few prospects.  Desperate, he accepts an offer to do battle with the reigning world heavyweight champ, proving himself a popular underdog and a champion of the common man.",1226880000,16,1628,5.424603174603175

3563148,5,B001F34HRS,"Okay, you'll never go wrong with Ron Howard directing.  The bonus material is an interesting added extra, but the films carry the day.  I bought this primarily for ""Apollo 13"", being one of my favorite films ever.  I had seen ""Backdraft"", which was well done but only worth a watch one time for me.  I had never seen ""Cinderella Man"", and boy, was I ever missing something!  What a gem!  And I found myself fascinated with ""A Beautiful Mind"".  I sort of wished ""The Paper"" had been included, but I'll have to save that for another day.",1479168000,2,535,4.453608247422681

3563163,5,B001F34HRS,"A BEAUTIFUL MIND and CINDERELLA MAN are a truly touching films directed by Ron Howard. If you are not familiar with the stories I will only say that to give away any details of this movie would be inappropriate. A BEAUTIFUL MIND builds at an interesting pace and is lethargic at times , yet it remains intriguing and emerges into a heartfelt statement about our true selves and the meaning of love, commitment and the essence of mind and being. Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly give brilliantly realistic performances and make this film work. A lot also has to be said of James Horner's insightful and moving score, which only enhances the viewer's insight and response to the film's statement. This film is beautiful and one of Ron Howard's best. CINDERELLA MAN tackles a different subject matter but once again our hero Russell Crowe has to come to realizations and overcome insurmountable odds. CINDERELLA MAN was oddly overlooked at the time of its release. That was a shame. APOLLO 13 is thoughtful inspiring film. BACKDRAFT is one of Ron Howard's most watchable films. There is as much subtlety as there is in your face pyrotechnics in BACKDRAFT. Each time I watch it I see something new, something I missed. It all comes together. These 4 films are great films.",1414627200,,1271,4.808219178082192

3563193,5,B001F34HRS,These are solid story/character-driven movies that also just happen to be beautiful on visual and auditory levels. Watching any one of these movies (w/o the TV commercials) is a personal event. Howard allows you to live through the characters...with some suspense thrown in.,1354233600,2,274,5.395348837209302
3563194,4,B001F34HRS,"The quality of the multipack is excellent, it is well presented and has eight DVD's, two for each film.

The extra packs and special features are the type and quality normally found on 19.99+ original release editions.

The packaging of the group as a whole is far superior to normal multipacks containing double sided discs in a cheap plastic sleeve.
It makes an excellent gift pack for anyone who might enjoy these films.

Quality of acting is high, the production quality excellent and the special effects generally superb. There were a few less than realistic points in Backdraft but fire scenes are notoriously difficult to simulate.

The stories themselves are not my normal preference, but so well depicted that each movie draws the viewer along for the duration.

From a very personal viewpoint I'd rate the films overall as follows, out of 5 stars.

Backdraft ****
Apollo 13 *****
A beautifull mind *****
Cinderalla man *****

I never thought I'd rate a boxing movie as 5*, but it is so well executed from the sets through the acting to what appears a very realistic and detailed portrayal of the period that I discovered it to be enthralling in the way it tells a timeless tale.

Enjoy or gift, you or the recipient is unlikely to be disappointed.",1325116800,10,1257,4.76036866359447
3563195,5,B001F34HRS,"Great to have three movies in one pack.  Ron Howard can do no wrong.  Apollo 13 was one of my favorites.  I had it on VHS, but the termites got it.
