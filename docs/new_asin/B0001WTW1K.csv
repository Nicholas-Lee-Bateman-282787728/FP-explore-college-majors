8017004,5,B0001WTW1K,"Another installment in what I consider the BEST ANIME EVER PRODUCED!
Visually stunning with an incredibly rich and complex yet engaging storyline.
The music is also bar-none in comparison with todays broadcast norm.
I guarantee you will NOT be disappointed in this series.
HOWEVER, I recommend you watch the volumes in order to understand the complex storyline.
ENJOY!",1293235200,,368,5.362068965517241
8017005,5,B0001WTW1K,"i could not belive how unbelivibly good this show is! when i fist watched last exile all i could say was wow! and it hasn't disapointed me yet. last exile has some of the best animation i've ever seen! and the whole plot is amazing! a real masterpiece. this show is one that almost anyone could enjoy, especialy if you are a fan of war flicks of any kind. when i finished watching V4 breakthrough all i could think was ""more, i must have more!"" and i can't wait for V5 to come out. i think i have to take a little time to mention the characters who are all so wonderfully perfect in personaliy and aimimation that i can truthfully say that GONZO has realy outdone itself.",1090800000,,671,4.25
8017006,3,B0001WTW1K,"I am a huge Last Exile fan. However, the series went downhill from here. The reason I liked Last Exile was because it was different from all the other animes. The computer-generated graphics actually make the battle scenes interesting, instead of some stupid DBZ stunt. Another thing I liked about it was there were no ""bizarre love triangles"" up until this point. Now it seems as though every character likes another character and that character likes everyone else...and does a few along the way. This volume, however, isn't a complete failure. The beginning of the volume starts out great, and you will watch the first episodes more than once if you buy this DVD, guaranteed. But the new ""bizarre love triangle"" just made everything too complicated near the end. There are enough plot twists in here that if you didn't watch this DVD, you would be missing a lot in the rest of the volumes. I recommend that you buy it, it just won't be as enjoyable as the first three.",1087516800,4,971,4.684210526315789
8017007,5,B0001WTW1K,"Ok I have so far purchased First Move, Positional Play, Discovered Attack, and now Breakthrough. This series doesn't stop wit the smart moves they make. All the character are lovable and very interesting. This series has 4 episodes that are everything.....
ISOLATED PAWN: Claus and Tatiana are thrown together to fly a vanship to defend the Silvana from a MASSIVE attack orchestrated by Anatoray and Tatiana begins to confide in Claus when the two make an emergency landing. Tatiana's character gets much character development.
ETUDE LAVIE: A flashback when Claus and Lavie still has a family. Learn much about their past. This is a somewhat sad episode........
FAIRY CHESS: All I can say is wow. This episode is like a drama show like somethin from MTV or 90210. I was shocked at the end of this episode what Sophia does to one of the main characters. This is my favorite episode up to this point!
BREAKTHROUGH: Action packed finally of the dvd where a character dies and ya cry. I guarantee you will cry. Very sad stuff here and i ain't saying nothing more about this episode.
So in the end, I recommend this dvd and the whole series to everyone out there! Please get this show cuz it is better than any anime I have ever seen besides ""Grave of the Fireflies"".....
This point 4th is where the real meat of the story picks up so please support this show and get it!!!",1087257600,7,1368,4.610655737704918
8017008,5,B0001WTW1K,"LastEXILE: Breakthrough is definitely the true breaking point of the series, although the auction for Exile and the race in the third DVD began setting the scene up. Breakthrough includes episodes 13 through 16.
13. ISOLATED PAWN - Claus and Tatiana are left alone on a desert wasteland, and struggle to find the survivors of the Sylvana.
14. ETUDE LAVIE - Basically a complete flashback of Claus and Lavie's pasts. Includes the beautiful song 'Skywriting.'
15. FAIRY CHESS - Claus and Tatiana return to the Sylvana, although the situation there has changed...
16. BREAKTHROUGH - The war between Dysis and Anatore reaches a climax, and the Guild begins to play a more major role.
I can only recommend this amazing DVD to all of you. If you've been following the series up to now, you will not be disappointed!",1083196800,12,809,4.827338129496403
