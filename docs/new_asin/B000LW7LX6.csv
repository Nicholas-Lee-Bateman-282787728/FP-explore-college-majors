2714913,5,B000LW7LX6,"I only have one other Leslie Sansone DVD and I don't use if very often, but this one is a keeper.  I am always on the lookout for a program where I can customize the workout and also a workout for a longer period of time.  This DVD does both.  I like the fact that it came with the resistance band also...it was like an unexpected gift.

I like the hour long workout and also the enthusiasm of Leslie.  I also enjoy the guy in the front who has a hard time keeping the rhythm...he's cute!",1174435200,17,488,4.041666666666667
2714914,5,B000LW7LX6,"I think this is a great video and definitely the next step after the 4 Mile Challenge.  She expects that the people using this video have used some of her other ones, so there is less ""teaching"" us how to do the different moves.  The total run time of the workout is just under 1 hour, 6 minutes and is a good pace for the duration.  I also found that moving from mile to mile helped make it seem like a shorter workout, but I get the health benefits and time in of a long workout.  I didn't notice it when I bought the video and the case doesn't mention it, but mine included the stretchy band that is used in one of the segments.  All in all, I love this video!",1174262400,16,663,3.992424242424242
2714915,3,B000LW7LX6,"I was very excited to get this video when it first came out.  I have about eight other workout videos by Leslie and use them six days a week.  I was not very impressed with the 5 mile walk.  I thought there was just too much walking in place or walking forwards and back - not alot of variation like on her other videos.  I found myself starting to improvise and put different moves into the workout to get a little more variation (such as kickbacks, kicks, knee lifts)...  I really like the Walk Away The Pounds Express videos or the Walk Away The Pounds For Abs.  As others have said, this video does have a different feel to it and it's not what I've come to expect from her previous workouts.  She does give the option of turning off her voice and just listening to the music while working out.  That's a nice option for those who get annoyed with all the talking - that has never been an issue for me. All in all, this video is OK, but the others I mentioned above are better.",1173312000,11,981,4.180851063829787
2714916,5,B000LW7LX6,"I absolutely love this DVD because it's chaptered! I think this is the first chaptered Leslie Sansone DVD! There are 5 walking segments: walk with weights (15 mins), walk with belt (15 mins), walk with bands (12 mins), 9 minute walk, 13 1/2 minute walk (yes I timed all segments!) I really don't know why some people are concerned about the supposedly lack of warm up because I find that 3 of the 5 segments have a gradual active warm up. That means, the workout starts off slowly and gradually builds up the pace. The 1 mile walks that use the weights, belt and bands all have that gradual active warm up. The 9 minute mile and 13 1/2 minute mile starts off at a pretty brisk pace and I love it! If one is concerned about the warm up then just program your player to start the workout with either the walk with weights, walk with belt or walk with bands. Then you can just add the 9 minute mile and 13 1/2 minute mile thereafter. I don't use her premixes, I make my own! The DVD is well-chaptered that you can just mix and match to your hearts content. I would recommend this: Program your player to do: walk with bands, walk with weights, 9 minute mile, 13 1/2 mile and finally walk with belt. BTW, I find that you don't actually need the belt and bands. Hand weights are just fine! My only complaint is that the music is rather faint. All in all I give this DVD 5 stars! Happy walking :)",1172102400,47,1390,4.2293233082706765
2714917,5,B000LW7LX6,"I have been using Leslie's workouts for over a year and have lost 70+ pounds. I still have quite a bit of weight left to lose, but i will be sticking with Leslie. This is the latest purchase Ive made from her library. There is no warm-up but thats the only drawback to the DVD. I guess if you really needed it you could do your own. But i have done all 5 miles twice without one and felt just fine. I haven't gotten around to doing the 3 mile workouts, but when i don't feeling like doing one of her other 3 mile dvds, i will pick one from here. Yes it has a different feel, but i think part of the reason is is that the set is different and there are new faces this time. JoAnn and Linda are there but they don't do most of the chatting with Leslie. Its actually the two guys in the group! Leslie also has her daughter join her. There is a good mix of body types and the outfits change every mile. I cant say the different feel is a drawback. If youve done WATP, WATP Express, and WATP For Abs dvds you know they aren't all alike. This isn't going to throw Leslie regulars for a loop. Boosters, as always, are optional. I love the cool-down for this workout. Its not visible on the menu but the dvd goes directly to it when you are done. It had more advanced stretching and some nice relaxing music. I would wholeheartedly recommend this workout for Leslie devotees. If you are a beginner I would start with the DVDs i mentioned above. There's plenty to choose from anyway!",1171497600,16,1474,4.1573426573426575
2714918,1,B000LW7LX6,"Let me start by saying I usually LOVE her workouts, I own 10 of them and I'm happy with all of them except this one...I was really excited that the 5 mile was coming out and all the talk about the different workouts available all on one.  Doing the 3 mile or any of the other variations is useless because if you select them, there is no warm up, no lead in to it, they just fast forward on the tape to that section.  So the only way to use it is if you do the entire 5 miles and even then, it just doesn't have the same feel as the other ones.  I hope as she gets more and more popular and the demand to put new tapes out increases, poor quality ones like this one aren't the norm.",1170115200,17,682,3.857142857142857

I purchased this DVD (Leslie Sansone's Walk at Home 5-Mile Walk) at the end of March 2014.  It played fine once in both a Blu-Ray  player and a desktop computer.

Did not attempt to play it again until yesterday morning (Aug 28 2014).  It would not load properly in either the Blu--Ray player or the computer.  When I ejected the disc, it had the worst case of DVD rot I had ever seen: it is totally reticulated on the data side. This deterioration had occurred between early April and late August.  Even though the window to get a refund or exchange has expired, I think I should be able to exchange this dvd or get a refund--the dvd is obviously defective.

I am a walker, can do a few miles without pain outdoors, but can't always get out and won't walk in the dark. I wanted a 5 mile DVD and this one does go by quickly. My only compliant is she doesn't use the props, the belt/bands often but she does encourage you to if you want. I did and had too at times to keep my heart rate up.
My other minor complaint and this happens in many exercise DVD's is the chatter, it's always the same and it's distracting, I don't want to hear ""Guess who's married to whom"" 20 times. My way of avoiding it, isn't shutting off the voice, the music isn't the best alone, but putting on my Ipod and listening my my music and just hearing her cues when needed.

The 5-Mile Walk is broken down into one mile segments, each a bit different, nothing startingly amazing, it is what Leslie does.  Most of the music has been used on other DVD's, and what was ""new"" wasn't exciting. A complaint I have with her DVDS is that the tape does not run a on-going Mile Guage, nor does it tell your MPH or timing of your mile.  Since her tapes are all about walking, walking fast, and walking distances, I can't understand why this information would not be running on the screen and am very disappointed in that (or put the info on the DVD jacket, come on!).  I have not done the other walks on this DVS; 1 mile, 2 mile, 3 mile, and 4 mile but I am guessing each will be guaged to a different fitness level - but I don't know - I'd like them ALL to be ADVANCED on this tape, I don't need any easy walks; I have lots of those.

2714968,3,B000LW7LX6,"What can I say?

First of all, delete the ""Advanced"" label from your mind right now because this certainly is not. Although I did sweat, I did not feel my heartbeat rise and stay elevated as it should when I am performing ""Advanced"" exercise. If you want a 5 mile walk, you would do better using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-at-Home-5-Mile-Fat-Burning-Walk/dp/B001F12ISU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home - 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk</a>&nbsp;for the sake of intensity.

The music is boring and repetitive. Only the 1st and 5th miles had unique music. The miles in between were those same old tunes from her other videos. This makes the miles seem longer than they actually are.

The only mile that I would call anywhere near ""advanced"" was mile 2 but there should have been more jogging in it.

Another issue is that Leslie talks so much that she often gets out of step/rhythm during this workout. If you are the type that has to focus in on the instructor really intently, this may cause a distraction when you realize that she is totally out of step. Luckily, I can get the step and then pretty well tune her out until the next step.

The ""meal plan"" shoots by so if you are really interested in it, you need to be fast on the draw with your remote so you can pause and read and write down what she is presenting. There is no talking, only words.

Although there is a music-only option, there is not a way to select individual miles (only 5 or 3) so if you looking to do only specific miles, you will have to use your remote to skip.

Overall, I guess it serves its purpose for those in the more intermediate range but if you read ""Advanced"" and think that you are going to take off like a rocket, you are mistaken.",1308873600,4,1803,4.759615384615385

I like being able to move really fast without slowing down to figure out the choreography. I can pause it to change a diaper or whatever and come back without losing my place. Each of the five miles are similar with power walking in place, side stepping, slow kicking, knee lifts, and hamstring curls.  There's some upper body work, too, and you have the option of using hand weights, a stretchy band, and a walking belt with stretchy cord if you have them. That way it doesn't feel quite so repetitive.  This one comes with a stretchy band which offers great resistance training. I love Leslie's happy chatter. It doesn't annoy me like it does some of the other reviewers, but you do have the option to turn off the talking. I also like that you can select how many miles you want to do, so if you choose do do all five miles up front, you are more likely to finish. Also, there is a suggested 7 day menu, another great bonus.  This workout is not nearly as intense as some of my other workouts, but I'm hoping that being able to complete it and use it more often will be more effective in the long run.",1303862400,3,1255,4.2384937238493725

2714975,1,B000LW7LX6,"I own several walk-at-home tapes and recently purchased Leslie's 5 Mile Walk. I'm giving this DVD one despite a five-star walk content because for some strange reason, she doesn't include warm-up or cool down segments. I don't understand why she left out these particular segments because on every DVD I own, I listen to Leslie preach about the importance of warming up before exercising and cooling down after, which is correct for a number of reasons that include (but aren't limited to):

Warming up:

Increases Muscle Temperature - The temperature increases within muscles that are used during a warm-up routine. A warmed muscle both contracts more forcefully and relaxes more quickly. In this way both speed and strength can be enhanced. Also, the probability of overstretching a muscle and causing injury is far less.

Increases Body Temperature - This improves muscle elasticity, also reducing the risk of strains and pulls.

Dilates Blood Vessels - This reduces the resistance to blood flow and lower stress on the heart.

Improves Efficient Cooling - By activating the heat-dissipation mechanisms in the body (efficient sweating) an athlete can cool efficiently and help prevent overheating early in the event or race.

Increases Blood Temperature - The temperature of blood increases as it travels through the muscles. As blood temperature rises, the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin weakens so oxygen is more readily available to working muscles, which may improve endurance.

Improves Range of Motion - The range of motion around a joint is increased.

Cooling down:

Assists the body in returning to its normal state

Helps heart rate and breathing return to normal, and prevents dizziness and needless pain following a rigorous workout, where the body experiences a number of stressful processes.

Helps the body flush the toxins and release strains.

Helps prevent Post Exercise Muscle Soreness (aka Delayed-Onset Muscle Soreness), which is the soreness generally faced the day after a strenuous workout.

Helps prevent ""blood pooling"" (a chemical effect of muscular fatigue that stays in the muscle causing swelling and pain).

Helps return the blood to the heart in adequate quantities to relieve the muscles of lactic acid. The circulating blood also carries with it the oxygen and nutrients required by the muscles, tendons and ligaments for repair and growth.

All that said, I know Leslie's warm-up drill from owning and exercising with several of her DVDs, including her ""Five Day Slimdown,"" which, despite being broken into 1-mile segments, also includes warm-up and cool down segments. I caution new-to-walking customers that it IS important to warm up prior to and cool down after exercising. Even hard-core Jillian Michaels knows this and incorporates these segments in her work-out videos. How many ""newbies"" will buy this particular DVD and put all of their confidence in its safety and common sense typically found in Leslie's tapes? After all, she is the exercise guru endorsed by the American Heart Association. Shame on you, Leslie--you know better, and I hope you take the effort to include the proper pre- and post-exercise segments viewers deserve in future videos.",1298073600,3,3199,5.269685039370079
2714976,4,B000LW7LX6,"I like the workout, but I need a cool down walk to get my heart rate back down. This dvd does not really offer that, so I either do it on my own after the whole workout (pause the dvd before I stretch) or just make my movements slower and not use the band the last 5 minutes of the last mile.  All in all a great workout, but I would like it better if there was a 'cool down walk'.",1294272000,,381,3.7037037037037037
2714977,5,B000LW7LX6,I have several of Leslie's work outs and this is a good one. If you want to sweat get it!! The stretchy bands make it more intense just a great work out~,1285027200,,153,3.8125
2714978,4,B000LW7LX6,"This DVD contains a total of 5 individual miles.  2 are fast miles, one with ""boosted"" walking (light jogging).  The remaining 3 miles are also relatively fast and include a strength training element, either hand weights, the stretchie band, or the ab belt.  The DVD lets you choose either a full 5 mile walk or one of 3 premixes, each of which includes the 2 fast miles and 1 of the strength training segments.  I like the 3 mile pre-mixes because they are fast and you can get done in about 35 minutes.  Unfortunately, there is no warm up on any of the walks on this DVD and  only the 5 mile walks have a stretch at the end.  So on the 3 mile walks, the trade off for finishing fast is that you don't get a warm up or cool down.  Other than that complaint, I like the variety of miles on this DVD and the energy level and banter between Leslie and the group that walks with her.",1284595200,5,880,4.135294117647059
2714979,4,B000LW7LX6,"This was the first Leslie Sansone DVD I ever bought and introduced me to the world of Walk at Home videos.  Two years later, I still pop it into the DVD player from time-to-time to incorporate particular segments into my daily workout routine (the Fast Walk and Walk Like a Runner miles being my most-used on this particular video).

It has clearly defined segments which allow for easy mixing and matching of walking routines (I like to mix up various miles with the assorted DVDs that I own, depending on my mood and my workout schedule), and even though some of the routines include the use of various exercise equipment (hand weights, walk belt, etc) you can easily perform the workouts without them.  It also put off a more ""intimate"" vibe for me--there is more focus on Leslie herself and less on her fellow walkers (unlike some videos like the 5 Mile Fat Burning workout where I found some of her walkers distracting).  In addition, unlike some of the other reviewers, I don't have an issue really with Leslie's chattiness--I find her friendly and more approachable than other instructors I've seen in other exercise DVDs (and you can choose to turn off the chatter and just exercise with the Music only option, which I greatly appreciated).

The only things I don't like about the DVD is that the music is a little more annoying than motivational, and Leslie misses her cues a few times (a problem I've found on other Walk at Home videos).  It also has the innate problem of any exercise DVD in that it can become repetitious after used a number of times, but if you want more complicated and advanced moves then maybe a walking DVD is not for you (as stated above, I mix up various Leslie DVDs to help keep my workout more fresh and less boring).

Overall a good basic DVD choice for Intermediate and Advanced Leslie walkers!",1282089600,2,1834,4.624615384615384
2714980,4,B000LW7LX6,"So says Leslie Sansone, the instructor of this fitness DVD.  Frankly I was a little disappointed. Like a previous reviewer stated, the program lacked consistently and did not prove to be as good a workout as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-s-Walk-Slim-4-Fast-Miles-2-Disc-Set/dp/B000OYCMMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone's Walk Slim - 4 Fast Miles  (2-Disc Set)</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-Slim-Fast-and-Firm-4-Really-Big-Miles/dp/B0010V60XY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone Walk Slim: Fast and Firm 4 Really Big Miles</a>&nbsp;(the latter my personal favorite thus far).  It consisted of five seperate miles that you could do altogether or seperately if you preferred. I did not like that--there did not seem to be a good flow because of this. Also the participants in this tape did not seem to be having as much as fun as those in the ""big, walk sweaty party"" of the 4 Fast Miles tape. To add to this, the photography in this tape seemed to be even worse. I had purchased a brand new DVD and the images are not sharp. Additionally you can barely hear the music.  This detracts from the ""dance party"" feeling and thus the enjoyment one can derive from doing the 4 Fast Miles tape.

This DVD DOES include strength training which I like but hints at being gimmicky at times. For instance, I personally do not think the Walk Belt as a seperate exercise aid is necessary. Leslie could have just used the ""stretchy"" (stremgth training booster) in both segments. The tape IS five miles long altogether and takes over an hour to complete. It also includes some of the ""boosted walking"" of the abovereferenced tapes and does get fun to do about the 4th mile or so. However when you have finished it you feel like something is missing. It certainly does NOT feel like an intermediate to advanced level tape.",1281484800,,1964,5.666666666666667
2714981,3,B000LW7LX6,"This DVD would be alot more challenging if it was more consistent with the speed of the miles...it slows down at the beginning of most of the miles to a warm up,so i burned more calories doing the 4 fast miles with boosted walking compared to this longer video. I sweat with working out for just 5-10 minutes,but i like my heart rate to stay up over 65% of my target heart rate, and when she starts over for 3 out of the 5 miles to a slower warm up pace it gets frustrating.",1276300800,2,474,4.053191489361702
2714982,5,B000LW7LX6,"This is a fun workout that is nicely challenging without exhausting a user.  It is great that there are 4 different workouts; 3-Three mile workouts with either the stretchie band, the weights, or the walkaway belt or the 5 mile challenge with all the items.  Leslie kids around with the other walkers and it really made me laugh and have a good time.  The only criticism (and it could be my own fault) is that I can't find a way to get the warm up and cool down features on the 3 mile workouts.  Only if I take the 5 mile workout do I get it all.  But I know how to warm up and stretch afterwards after many years of doing Leslie workouts so it isn't a deal breaker.  I loved that the stretchie or firm band is packed in the case.  The price was right and the boosted walking really saves time compared to other 3 mile workouts I've done with Leslie.",1269734400,,850,4.146341463414634
2714983,4,B000LW7LX6,I have been a fan of Leslie for years and have to admit I was becoming bored with her workouts.  I researched for a more challenging dvds and read the reviews on Amazon.com before making my final decision.  I read the ones on this dvd several times but was kind of hesitant about purchasing it.  I read the reviews and hoped it was advanced and challenging like everyone was commenting.  I got the dvd in and tried it out with my sister.  We fell in love with it instantly.  It stars you out at a faster pace and gets your heart rate up there....real quick so you can burn that stored fat.  My sister and I are still working on losing weight and can tell a difference just in a few short weeks.  We won't step on the scale yet but we do notice a difference.  Thank you Leslie for coming out with a more challenging dvd.,1268438400,6,819,4.165605095541402
2714984,5,B000LW7LX6,I love Leslie Sansome's video's. She has a soothing voice peppy but not too peppy. I have a couple of her video's and she has helped me to exercise on a daily basis. I really love the bands included because they help to add some extra resistance which in the long run makes you work harder and makes you fit faster.,1267488000,,315,4.180327868852459
2714985,5,B000LW7LX6,"Yes for Leslie fans this is another great workout.  With the easy choreography and upbeat attitude, the time flies by.  This is a fast-paced workout, so no warm-up, just jumping right into a fast walk with hand weights.  Each mile has something different.  The first has hand weights (you can use anything for this, including 16 oz soup cans if you want), followed by a fast mile with just a few minutes of jogging (not as much as some other boosted workouts), followed by the waist band (again, you can substitute a stretchy band if you want), another fast mile, then the last mile with the stretchy band.  Each mile is different enough to keep you interested, but really nothing new.  So, for those looking to push up the intensity after having developed a solid base doing shorter, gentler work outs, this is the one for you.",1267142400,3,828,4.598639455782313
2714986,5,B000LW7LX6,This is her best DVD yet.  It is good and upbeat.  Best features are: 1) you can do the work out with music only 2) broken down into segments.,1266451200,,142,3.8620689655172415
2714987,5,B000LW7LX6,"If you think it is too cold to be walking outside in the winter, the Leslie Sansone workouts are a fun challenge. In this DVD she presents five options. One-mile walks are organized into 3 and 5 mile walks with a cool down and stretching session at the end. Here is what you can choose from:

5 Mile Challenge Walk
5 Mile Advanced Walk
3 Mile with Hand Weights
3 Mile with Walk Belt
3 Mile with Firm Band

The walking on this advanced DVD might not make you feel out of breath, but you will feel the work in your legs for sure. Leslie Sansone doesn't push you into a zone where you feel your muscles burning but it is close. Even though I've done lots of other workouts with Leslie Sansone I felt this one was definitely a little harder and at times I wasn't keeping up with the faster pace. So I had to push myself to go that little bit faster when the music changed pace.

I can recommend this to anyone who has been doing the Leslie Sansone workouts and wants an advanced challenge. For beginners I'd recommend you start with one of the 1-3 mile walks instead. You also need a stretchy band (included) and a special belt you can order in a set:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-at-Home-Walk-Away-Your-Waistline-With-1-2-and-3-Mile-Markers-Walk-Belt-Included-Inside/dp/B000WC38CS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home - Walk Away Your Waistline!

I took one point off of my review because I exercise early in the morning so keep the volume as low as possible and I cannot hear the music! I have to be able to hear the music to keep the pace but when I turn it up the talking is too loud. This video would serve me better if the music and talk were at about the same level.

2715007,4,B000LW7LX6,"I wish I could give this 3.5 stars but it is definitely not the five I usually give a Leslie Sansone workout. Here's why:

1. Leslie defines advanced workouts by speedwalking and jogging. I don't. In fact, the walk boosters really take her workouts up a notch. I use a heart rate monitor and the two miles on this dvd without the walk boosters didn't challenge me. I use this dvd for the three miles with the walk boosters. You gave it four stars because the firm band is included in the price. This is a savings of about $15.00.

2. The cueing in this dvd is not up to the standard I am use to with Leslie. I am not sure if it is because she is so excited to be walking with a new set of friends and her daughter is also in this dvd.

Bottom line: Good exercise routines...focus on three miles of booster walks. You will get a great workout.",1237248000,2,842,4.121951219512195

I weighed 240 lbs. It is now February 24th, 2009 and I am happy...no thrilled to tell you that I have walked away 83 lbs!!! I went from 2X to size 12.

I have three different videos/DVDs of Ms. Sansone's and I love every single one of them.  Some of her productions are called Walk-Away-The-Pounds and that is the truth.  Since February 2008, I've walked away 95.5 lbs. with Ms. Sansone!  She has programs for every fitness level.  I started out doing just 5 minutes of her 1 mile walk-away video; that's all I could do. Now, I complete one of her 60 minute, 5 mile challenges or 60 minutes of some other aerobic exercise, daily.  These videos have helped me regain my health and my life.

2715014,5,B000LW7LX6,"I FINALLY broke the seal on this WATP DVD.  Let me tell you, it is going into rotation.  This DVD packs a HUGE whallup where strength training and cardio are concerned.
You can choose to workout to all 5 miles, or create your own workout by selecting the mile markers you want.  The entire DVD is fast paced and you don't stop moving for a second.  Cueing is off by a couple of seconds, but otherwise very easy to follow.  Same movements just faster intervals.  She uses the handweights, the exercise belt (doesn't come with the DVD), and the fitness band (which comes with the DVD).  It's really not necessary to have the exercise belt, you can use the band or hand weights.  Although I would recommend going slower with the arm movements when using the hand weights.
Overall, this DVD is very good.",1229817600,3,800,4.506944444444445

This is one of my favorites because it's longer, a bit more challenging, and you can use it to create different combinations of workouts. I have been using most days of the week for the past several weeks, and I have yet to get bored with it. However, at times, I do turn off the volume, put on my own favorite music, and simply follow the picture.",1225670400,,399,4.194805194805195

I like this video because it has a friendly atmosphere and gives you options for what kind of workout you want.

Also appreciate the option that you can turn off Leslie's commentary.",1223769600,,393,4.430555555555555

2715021,5,B000LW7LX6,"This is a really great workout!  I like it that for two of the five miles Leslie brings in a little variety by using a waist exercise stretch band and in another mile a stretchy band.  The five miles pass surprisingly quickly taking just about 1 hour and 5 minutes.  One of Leslie's great strength's is that she keeps a fast, lively and varied pace.  So many workouts can be boring and repetitive but thankfully this is not one of them.  I have been doing this on alternate days with Leslie's fast four mile workout (also a great workout) and in five days have dropped 7lbs.  It is a great incentive to lose the pounds in a short space of time and motivates me to keep at this exercise dvd.
If you like Leslie Sansonne it is a good idea to buy a couple of her dvd's to do on alternate days to avoid getting bored.
Leslie promises that if you do her workout you will burn up calories and lose weight and she is absolutely spot on.
I feel energized and full of motivation to continue with this workout and hopefully lose more weight in the process.",1222732800,,1046,4.257575757575758
2715022,4,B000LW7LX6,"I try to walk 5 or more miles every day.  I live in a limited space and dread rainy, muddy days and insufferably hot days, of which there are too many in Central TX.  Exercise DVDs usually set my teeth on edge.  This one gives you a decent workout when you can't or won't go outside.  It's the first workout program I've ever seen tailored to the arthritic and klutzy-- I could do all the steps.  Naturally Ms. Sansone wants to make a living and sell her ""booster"" products but the latex band provided in the DVD box actually can be used as a decent muscle toner while walking.  Another plus is the ability to turn off the annoying talk part of the sessions and walk to music only.

One star off because miles were not marked on the screen, and also some miles actually matched my fairly accurate Sportline pedometer watch (also purchased from Amazon), while others clocked out to only half a mile.

An mp3 of this to use in case of computer power failure would be the icing on the cake -- er, the greens on the turnip.

I, like another reviewer, miss the mile markers that are on some of the other videos, but there is a brief pause so, I just try to pay attention.

I think someone who is not familiar with her other videos would benefit from doing one of those first to get the moves.

2715031,5,B000LW7LX6,~I have been doing Leslie Sansone's walk videos for a while now and I really enjoy her style. It's nice to be able to do them in the house without worrying about going out. The workouts are made out of steps that are easy to learn so you are not so caught up in trying to learn the steps that you miss out on the workout. The walkers that do the routines with her make you feel like it could be a friend of yours your working out with and Leslie gives you the same feeling. They are real people not ex-beauty pageant winners *no offense anyone* that don't break a sweat.  I love the workouts! I have several of them. If you want a workout that takes you to a nice pace and gets your heart pumping but doesn't send you to a level that's so demanding it's too much...TRY LESLIE..You won't be sorry you did! Can't wait for the 6 mile!~,1215561600,4,832,4.104294478527607

2715035,5,B000LW7LX6,"Like alot of others...I'm a big fan of Leslie workouts.  This is one of my favorite since it so easy to customize the order of the miles walked -- there are markers so you can skip to the next mile or go back by just using the ""skip"" button on your remote. Most of her workout DVDs don't have this feature.  This routine is fast paced that's geared for the intermediate or advanced walker.  I have workouts of Denise Austin, Kathy Smith, and others but always come back to Leslie. I've been using Leslie's workouts for over 3 years with incredible results.  Just turned 55 and have am as just as fit, flexible and strong as I was 20 years ago.  But you have to workout consistently 4-6 times a week to get great results along with watching what and how much you eat.  What I do to keep things interesting with her workouts is increase the pace and add my own moves for variety, do my own warmups beforehand, and use weights, stretchie bands, as well as the belt throughout a good part of the workouts.  As Leslie says, you don't have to follow her moves exactly -- the nature of her workouts makes it easy to customize to your fitness level.  No workout DVD and no instructor is perfect so I don't focus on the imperfections -- I just do it because it's your attitude that counts.  Obviously, some workout DVD's are truly horrible and should never have been made but Leslie workouts don't fall in that category. This DVD is one of her best.",1214092800,29,1440,4.3632958801498125

We are late 60's and early 70's and enjoy walking together each morning to Leslie and her team of walkers.  It has given us more flexibility, more energy, more stamina and we like not having to go outside and do our walking - as we previously have done for 15-20 years.

I would recommend her DVD programs to any and all walkers - not only for maintaining physical fitness but for weight reduction and control as well.

2715039,2,B000LW7LX6,"All exercise is good exercise. With that being said...

Leslie Sansone's recent DVD release, Walk at Home: 5 Mile, didn't exactly have me walking on air. While Leslie is endearing at times, she's can be a tad annoying. Granted, the woman knows her stuff (very few exercise DVDs give good postural alignment tips and actually educate people on how exercise affects the body) and cues beautifully so that you're never lost from one move to the next, but I was tempted to hit the mute button a time or two.

Leslie is kind of like a hyper talk show host who just happens to be working out with a group of eight behind her. During the workout, she even reveals the ""secret"" that the girl at her right is her daughter and leaves viewers in suspense of who workout posse member Carl is married to. (Turns out it's Rita in case you can't bear the suspense.) She's also very touchy feely, wanting to hold hands with people and clap--a lot. Thankfully, it looks like the producers realized this and added a ""music-only"" option to the DVD's menu. If you're into ""walking"" (which basically equates to marching in place) at home, I suggest listening to at least a mile or two with the audio, then going to the music-only option. For an exercise DVD, the music is actually pretty good.

This DVD is fairly tame, and it definitely isn't a walk on the wild side. (Sorry, the walk jokes are way too easy.) It was more like a mildly amusing power walk through my neighborhood where I jaywalked once or twice for excitement. Oooh, crazy.

A five-mile walk is the premise of the DVD, with each mile acting as its own segment, complete with outfit changes. There's little difference between the miles, which was disappointing. Mile one is a good warm-up and introduces you to the beginner-friendly steps (marching in place, side steps, walking up and back, knees up, kicks, hamstring curls). Mile two was my favorite and actually incorporates light jogging and some pretty intense moves. Mile three, four and five completely run together and get really a little boring, despite the introduction of Leslie's branded swag, which includes hand weights, a belt with elastic bands and Leslie's ""stretchy""--a bright pink, thick elastic band. Whooo! For each mile, Leslie basically repeats the same choreography and during the extended marching-in-place intervals, she jabbers on about how much she loves healthy sweaters. (If you decide to do the video and need additional entertainment, take note of Jimmy in the back. He's the large fellow who resembles a jolly Hulk Hogan and looks completely out of place in a Leslie Sansone DVD.)

I should disclose that I've never done any DVDs in the Walk at Home series, but this was the advanced five mile version, and I wasn't exactly challenged. I would recommend this to novice exercisers or those who like basic and simple choreography or no choreography at all and are looking for an easy to moderate cardio workout. For those of you who work out regularly, I'd walk away. (Sorry, had to get one last joke in there.)

That was two years ago and I can honestly say that I am fit and active.  I am at my ideal weight and enjoy walking with Leslie and her friends everyday.  I started out slow with 1 or 2 miles at the beginning and now I walk 3-5 miles easy.  I was so excited to see that Leslie had stepped it up a notch.  I strongly encourage people everyday to walk.  People will ask me how I can be so thin and active.  I then take out a pen and write down Leslie Sansone walking tapes on a piece of paper for them.  Then, I say that Amazon has the best prices.

I love the fact that I can ""get moving"" in my own home and get energized/burn calories for just pennies a day.  I use this DVD during the week.  I like it best because it jumps right into the work out and makes the best use of my limited time.  You can do all 5 miles, or choose one of the 3 mile segments.  I include 3 lb weights on miles 1/2 and have recently increased to 5 lb weights on mile 3 for extra cardio and calorie burn.  I don't recommend purchase of the walkbelt, as you can get just as much benefit by using the exercise band, or hand weights for this segment.  Minor downside: The music, while fast, is not especially motivating, so I sometimes mute the computer and exercise with the ipod and my own music.  I get a kick out of watching Leslie's beautiful daughter, Marie, trying to keep a straight face while working out next to Carl...it's pretty cute!

I love Leslie's talking too--she gives you good health and fitness information, keeps you motivated, and she has an excellent sense of humor and outlook on life!

I also appreciate that the people working out with her are not the usual young, fresh hardbodies you find on other workout dvds. They are more representative of the real world; young & not so young, slim & overweight, fit & flabby.  As with other Sansone workouts, occasionally someone will zig when they should have zagged and it doesn't get editted out.  Seeing that, I don't feel discouraged when I miss a beat or two.

I was an absolute couch potato with the body to prove it.  After doing the Sansone workouts for about 2 months now, the difference in both my appearance and stamina are remarkable.

I THOUGHT THIS TAPE WOULD BE BORING BUT IT IS ONE OF THE BEST DVDS FOR EXERCISE. WHAT EVER YOUR LEVEL IS SHE COVERS IT. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS DVD.,1202601600,5,263,3.7142857142857144
2715072,5,B000LW7LX6,"I have just recently started excersising again for health reasons. I should say preventative reasons. There is diabetes in my family and I'm afraid of getting the disease that killed my mother. I'm turning 68 this year and this workout is quite a challenge, but well worth the effort. I've lost quite a few inches so far and that coupled with a Wellness Food class, I have lost about 20#. Feel and look much better plus, my Blood Pressure down.

Some of the talk on the DVD is a little bit silly. Leslie babbles on with some of the people on the DVD. But, I think that even if it is a little silly, it makes you feel more part of the group also. All and all I would recommend it for anyone who is stuck inside during all the rain & snow days.",1202515200,10,742,4.152777777777778
2715073,5,B000LW7LX6,I am a lover of Leslie's workout tape.  I started with the 2 mile tape and kept building.  I love her 4 mile tape and this one is even better.  I don't have the band for around my waist but I just use my weights for that mile.  I feel I get a great workout.  Upper body lower body and cardio all in one.  I have recently dropped 30 pounds by doing her work out tape and eating better.  I hope you can do what you need to do to get healthy.,1202428800,9,439,3.7065217391304346
2715074,5,B000LW7LX6,It's a good workout and you don't have to do the whole five miles.  It's the spice of exercising and getting a good start to the day.,1202428800,,133,3.925925925925926
2715075,5,B000LW7LX6,"I absolutely love this DVD because it's chaptered! I think this is the first chaptered Leslie Sansone DVD! There are 5 walking segments: walk with weights (15 mins), walk with belt (15 mins), walk with bands (12 mins), 9 minute walk, 13 1/2 minute walk (yes I timed all segments!) I really don't know why some people are concerned about the supposedly lack of warm up because I find that 3 of the 5 segments have a gradual active warm up. That means, the workout starts off slowly and gradually builds up the pace. The 1 mile walks that use the weights, belt and bands all have that gradual active warm up. The 9 minute mile and 13 1/2 minute mile starts off at a pretty brisk pace and I love it! If one is concerned about the warm up then just program your player to start the workout with either the walk with weights, walk with belt or walk with bands. Then you can just add the 9 minute mile and 13 1/2 minute mile thereafter. I don't use her premixes, I make my own! The DVD is well-chaptered that you can just mix and match to your hearts content. I would recommend this: Program your player to do: walk with bands, walk with weights, 9 minute mile, 13 1/2 mile and finally walk with belt. BTW, I find that you don't actually need the belt and bands. Hand weights are just fine! My only complaint is that the music is rather faint. All in all I give this DVD 5 stars! Happy walking :)",1201996800,61,1390,4.2293233082706765
2715076,5,B000LW7LX6,"I am a fan of Leslie's - this is a very nice compliment to her 4 mile walk. If you are a beginner or someone who does not want to ""jog"" or ""run"" she has a person you can follow and still work up a good sweat. I like the fact she gets winded in this work out and even kids - that's enough aren't we done yet! I can relate to that - but she bounces right back with we can do it! LOL hey it works for me!",1201046400,14,401,3.466666666666667
2715077,4,B000LW7LX6,I have at least a dozen of Leslie's workouts and this is by far my favorite! The chaptering is great. My favorite is the approximately 14 minute mile and the 9 minute mile. I recomend this program for sure. I REALLY wish she would do a 5 or 6 mile program for the more advanced walkers with all miles being between 9 and 14 minutes!!!  That would be divine!,1199145600,2,357,4.173913043478261

2715082,4,B000LW7LX6,"I love Leslie and I like this DVD, and I was excited about the fact that with this one I would be able to turn HER off and just listen to the music, what a great idea,,,,except that the music is just AWFUL ! it does NOT inspire me to keep moving. I cannot understand whatever it is thats being said, it just sounds stupid. But I do love leslie, even tho she talks way too much during her DVD's.",1188259200,2,394,3.9375
2715083,4,B000LW7LX6,"I am new to Leslie Sansone in-home walking, although I'm certainly not new to exercise DVDs and tapes. I have not been working out regularly for the past couple of years and was kind of skeptical about the walking DVDs, yet curious because they're so popular. I picked up the Walk At Home 5-Mile Walk and here's what it includes:

1-mile walk w/firming band
1-mile walk w/hand weights
1-mile walk w/walk belt
1-mile fast walk
1-mile walk like a runner
7-Day Healthy Weight Loss Meal Plan

You can select from four different walking programs. All four include the Walk Like a Runner and Fast Walk, but you have the choice between three-mile walks (those two plus one of each with the ""extras"") or the Super Challenge, which is all five miles. My DVD also included the firming band. Even though I would consider myself a beginner, I was able to successfully complete the five-mile walk on my first day. It was a great workout but not overwhelming. I don't have a walk belt, so I used the firming band for that segment and it worked fine.

I did take one point off of my rating because I can see Leslie getting a bit annoying if doing this DVD over and over again. She interjects a lot of motivational comments that have nothing to do with exercise. Personally, I wish she'd stick to talking about exercise, but if you enjoy her motivational talk, you'll probably find this DVD a five-star since the workout is great.",1186876800,138,1414,4.559055118110236
2715084,4,B000LW7LX6,"I have been using Leslie's dvd's for a little over 1 1/2 years now, and I have lost along with diet about 80 pounds.  I do this workout 5 to 6 days a week. It takes a little over an hour.  The first mile is with handweights, 2nd one is no weights just walk & jog, 3rd is with a belt they use-I don't care for the belt anyways so I substitute with my handweights, 4 is with no weights just fast walking, 5 is with stretchy band I love that one too.
My only COMPLAINTS are:  I think they walk too slow in miles 1, 3, 5, this is supposed to be advanced so they should be more like miles 2 and 4.  However it is very easy to just make yourself go faster I pretty much go faster than them and harder the entire time. If you are not at least medium sweaty by end of mi 5 then you can challenge yourself go even faster next time harder. Also, the music is a bit slow and boring, so a quick fix, get an ipod and download your favorite fast songs I clip my ipod to back of my exercise shirt so it doesn't get in the way of the weights which it does when it is on my arm or waist!!
Have fun make it your own, and stick to it!!!",1185148800,7,1117,3.7606837606837606

However, that said, she needs to fire the producers who put this mess together.  I can't stand the chapters on this DVD; there is no ""flow"" from one to the other and I just didn't feel that I got a complete workout.  Used it twice and tossed it.  Music was pretty bad too.

The first time I did this video, I thought, ""This is ridiculous. This is so easy and will not do anything.""
