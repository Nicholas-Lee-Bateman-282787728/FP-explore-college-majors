3005526,4,B000XSKDKQ,"Red Eye, or - to be more exact - Redeu-ai, is a 2005 Korean film that has nothing whatsoever to do with Wes Craven's film Red Eye and everything to do with good, creepy supernatural story-telling.  It's the first film directed by Dong-Bin Kim since 1999's The Ring Virus.  While the story features a number of confusing details, the overall effect of the film is quite good - and one that will appeal to a wide cross-section of viewers since there is comparatively little gore and a refreshing lack of cinematic scare tactics to distract you.  Good creepiness percolates slowly, a fact which American horror directors sometimes seem oblivious to.

When a train wrecks and kills scores of people, it's just not a good idea to incorporate some of the less-damaged passenger cars into another train.  Of course, economics has a way of overcoming superstition and common sense.  When that second train takes its last journey on the same tracks the wrecked train took, you can't help but have some ghost train manifestations.  Thus, it's no surprise that a couple of young ghost hunters, one of whom can see dead people, book passage on this final journey, or that certain other individuals connected to the tragedy also turn up in one way or another.  Attendant Mi-Sun (Shin-yeong Jang) traded gigs in order to be there, even though it's her birthday.  We don't know exactly why at first, but her connection to the train is made pretty clear by her ability (or curse) to see things that no one else sees - such as a creepy little boy artist and a ghostly supervisor with a bloody checklist who tells her that everyone on board is going to die.

Part of the confusion some viewers may carry away from Redeu-ai stems from the fact that there is more than one train involved in this story.  One leaves the station, and just minutes later we see a late-arriving newlywed couple board another train.  This second train has only a handful of passengers, so it's a little disarming when the film starts switching between the two - but not to worry because the twain (no pun intended, unless you think it's funny) is fated to become one after the first train makes a temporary emergency stop.

If you're looking for visceral horror, you won't find it here.  Redeu-ai is a genuine ghost story with deliciously creepy overtones, the kind of film only being made in Asia these days.  It may incorporate elements of films you've seen before, but those elements are brought together beautifully and the train setting helps define the film's individual identity.  This isn't a must-see Asian horror film, but it's definitely worth seeing for those who appreciate a good, suspenseful ghost story.",1230508800,12,2677,4.774403470715835

8229456,4,B000XSKDKQ,"Mi-Sun (Shin-yeong Jang), as a five year old girl had her birthday disrupted by a train wreak where he father not only dies, but whose role was questioned in the accident. Fifteen years later she works on that same train line on the anniversary of the crash. Ghosts from the past appear as it becomes confusing as who is a ghost and who is not.

This is a fairly decent ghost story. It takes a long time to develop and in the end I still had to question the why and wherefore of the sequence of events leading up to the accident.

8229458,3,B000XSKDKQ,"1988: A devastating train accident causes the death of hundreds of passengers. 1998: Oh Mi-sun starts working as a stewardess on a train running the same line for the last time; this line, however, has coaches from the crashed train. Now, she begins to experience unusual, supernatural-like events, but are they in her head or are they actually happening? Red Eye is a decent horror-mystery mixture.

The story in Red Eye is great. I like it's approach to the supernatural, and the setting is unique and often creepy. However, I did feel like the story lacked focus, and it felt a bit jumbled by the end. It does have some creepy imagery, especially towards the end, as well as a few jump-scares. It's not the most terrifying film ever, but it has a few outstanding moments. I'd say this is more of a mystery film with horror elements than a straight-forward horror film; it's simply not consistently scary enough, in my opinion. The mystery elements in this film are great, as it often leaves you wondering. The acting was good, and I really liked the music. It also has great cinematography.

Overall, Red Eye isn't a standout film nor is it a terrible one; it does, however, have a great setting, creepy visuals, and a few decent scares. I lightly recommend a purchase for fans horror, a rental otherwise.

Red Eye has some strong violence.",1365984000,2,1343,4.706382978723404
8229459,3,B000XSKDKQ,"Unique, moody and well-shot little Korean horror film, about a young woman who starts a new job as a night attendant on a train - this particular train's last run, I think - on the night of her birthday. Sixteen years ago, a horrible accident on the same train resulted in the loss of 100+ lives, and some of the same cars from that train are still attached to this one ... which is maybe why, from when the train first starts its run, our attendant begins to see flashes of the old train on the night it crashed in 1988. Ghosts abound - or is she seeing things? The mysteries (and deaths) begin again, getting creepier as the train rolls on picking up more passengers (victims?) ... but in the end, the plot is a bit of a mish-mash that makes for a nice horror flick visually, but nothing you can really get emotionally attached to as a film. Average, worth a look if you like Asian horror films!",1356998400,4,897,4.2823529411764705
8229460,3,B000XSKDKQ,"Red Eye is an okay Korean Horror movie. The major problem I had with it is the pacing, it's really slow. And there are not enough scares.",1353628800,,137,4.111111111111111
