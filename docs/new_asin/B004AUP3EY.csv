4311243,4,B004AUP3EY,"For 11 Dollars shipped, I am able to enjoy watching one of my favorite horror double feature's of all time. The picture quality is very good. Colors are vibrant, both are 16x9 widescreen with no bars, and the sound actually stands out more than the picture quality in my opinion. Both have True HD DTS and 1000 Corpses has a great special features menu to boot. Ive seen better quality on the picture side of things but it's actually better than I anticipated it would be. Don't get me wrong it definitely looks blu-ray, but it's not as sharp or defined as ""The Dark Knight."" Audio presentation is excellent. Im surprised it sounds so clear and all audio channels are very distinct and you can hear the dialogue completely without having to raise the volume. It's definitely the cherry on the sundae if you are a fan of this collection. For the price, I am completely satisfied.",1306195200,5,878,4.598726114649682
4311244,3,B004AUP3EY,"These are two movies written and directed by death-metal king-turned-director Rob Zombie.  Here's my review...

  HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES: Rob Zombie's first film, which I actually liked; up until it was explained to me. It was designed to be a ""video game,"" but over which the viewer had no control. Once that was explained to me, it became increasing apparent over multiple viewings that it was just the SEGA CD/32X game ""Corpse Killer"" played through correctly to completion, only filmed with a full-def lens. It's just as bad as you're imagining. * of 5.

  DEVIL'S REJECTS: This is Rob's second film, often billed as a sequel to 1000 CORPSES, but I don't think that's fair, because it's a far superior movie. Gone is the first-person view, annoying cutscenes, confined spaces, and minimalistic plot. Here we have convincing actors that can be sympathized with (or despised, depending on who you're speaking of). It is a full-on horror film, very unnerving, and entertaining. **** of 5.

Bottom-Line: At this price, just get the two-pack to own the story so far. (But personally, I'll just wait for the entire trilogy).",1302739200,,1121,4.957219251336898
4311245,5,B004AUP3EY,I like both of these movies so it was easy to go ahead and buy them on blu and im not disappointed at all the p.q. is great don't have a home theater so i cant really comment on audio,1298937600,3,183,3.6

4311370,2,B004AUP3EY,"I did not like these movies.  I didn't find them to be scary - only disturbing because of how sadistic and twisted the characters are.  House of 1000 Corpses was better than the Devil's Rejects. It's closer to a ""Horror"" movie than the Devil's Rejects.  TDR was really just a movie about a trio of freaks were as unbelievably twisted as you've ever seen. The story line of TDR was too simplistic and unreal.  [spoiler alert] If the sheriff was so interested in making sure these 3 were brought to justice, why did he go-it-alone in the end when came time to bring them in?  Just stupid.  As a point of reference, I enjoyed Rob Zombie's Halloween.  I also like The Strangers and Paranormal Activity when it comes to ""scary"" movies.",1446854400,,730,4.526717557251908

If you are not familiar with these movies, make sure to watch House of a 1000 corpses first before the Devil's Rejects or you will ruin it for yourself.

4311478,3,B004AUP3EY,I decided to upgrade these two films from DVD to Blu-ray. My suggestion is to not follow me. House of 1000 Corpses loses its awesome character driven menus (on the DVD) and gives you a spinning wheel. The picture quality of the Blu is improved however. The Devil's Rejects loses almost all of the Special Features including the 2.5 hour documentary. I don't get how this happened at all. And Reject's picture quality on the Blu doesn't look any better than the DVD. I think the DVD actually looks better. Highly disappointed in this one as it's one of my favorite films. Stick with the DVDs if you have 'em.,1318464000,35,607,4.527272727272727
4311479,5,B004AUP3EY,"""House of a 1000 Corpse"" was waited for with great anticipation amongst horror lovers when it was announced. It was heavily hyped before release on horror websites & horror magazines. I my self was salivating to see this movie & see if musician Rob Zombie could make that rare leap from the music world to director of the movie world. The movie when it came out did not play in my hometown of Cedar Rapids, I had to go 20 miles south to Iowa City to see it. Was I disappointed?

One big NO! Zombie turned the horror world on it's ear with ""House of 1000 Corpses,"" announcing to the world of motion pictures a new director to be reckoned with. ""House of a 1000 Corpses"" paid loving tribute to 70's classics, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" & ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" but did not ape them, it reinvented them! He added witty black comedy dialog the first half of the movie. You knew something was about to go awry, but did not expect the brutality that was to ensue. Then Zombie does a complete 180 degree turn, in the scene where Otis & Tiny come to life as Scarecrows assaulting the victims in their car trying to leave the premises, when the driver gets out of the car to open the gate, dumb move, but what a great scene! Zombie does something amazing here, turns a black comedy horror film into a straight horror film going straight for your heart with a hatchet, & makes it work! As the hilarious suddenly turns into the horrendous in one big un-merciless turn, with a cold & sadistic vengeance as the Fireflies' carve, skin, & mutilate their victims in a unending barrage of murderous delight. There is as scene with Otis pointing a gun right on the head of a deputy, that could very well go down as on of the coldest most memorable scenes in any violent movie, horror or not, since Henry Fonda's, ""Frank"" character in ""Once Apon A Time in the West,"" where he pionts his gun at the young boy, camera close ups of both their eyes (Fonda's cold as ice enjoyment) for a minute or two, then, bang! Zombie had to be inspired by that scene! If this was not enough, then the last three victims are subjected to the underground world of Doctor Satan, but one escapes before hand only to meet another gruesome death. The other two get sent down to Dr. Satan's labyrinth, & while there is some great scenes here, especially the lowering into the pit filled with water, the movie does fall apart some here.

House of a 1000 Corpses"" is just beautiful to look at on Blu-ray! The red, greens, blues, are magnificent! The resolution is just awe striking. The sound rich & full! No bitching here about the cinematography or the sound of this film, it is as good as it gets!

If I have any complaints, other than the last twenty minutes of this movie falling somewhat apart, it is lack of character development, I know nothing about the redneck psycho family, but then again, this movie does not demand that. I really don't care for the four main victims & actually root for their demise by the Fireflies'. Zombie intentionally made the characters this way, as they were rude & condescending, to the point of obnoxious. So when the Fireflies start their torture & killing of these characters with glee (the deputy included), I enjoyed that, as sick as it might be, LOL!

""House of 1000 Corpses"" is grand entrance by a new, majorly talented director. It is a modern classic, not to be missed by modern day horror fans!

4 1/2 out of 5 stars = Minor Masterpiece

""The Devils Rejects"" is the sequel to ""House of 1000 Corpse,"" & continuing saga of the Fireflies'. Just like the 180 degree mid movie turn in ""Hose of 1000 Corpses,"" director Rob Zombie does a complete turn around here & makes it work magnificently! Gone is the huge black comedy of the former, though there is black comedy here. Gone is the Satanic elements of Doctor Satan, but what is left is the hugely disturbing shock value of the former movies best brutal scenes, coupled with a huge advancement of character development!

""The Devils Rejects"" is grittier, starker, blacker, colder, & deeper by far than its predecessor. Zombie makes a modern day western on the run road movie with this film, ala, ""The Wild Bunch. The film really does not fit in the horror genre comfortably, but for lack of another genre, that is where it resides. The characters are as ruthless & mean spirited as it gets, whether it be the Fireflies' in the first two thirds of this movie, or the last third, as Sherriff Wydell is out for revenge for the Fireflies' killing his Sherriff brother in the first movie. This film transcends the line between good & evil, & how each element follows it own traditional path. It blurs them into one horrific element of grisly, ghastly, mean spirited orgy of blood, revenge, & survival.

Especially good is William Forsythe's, Sherriff Wydell, who is so obsessed with the revenge of his brother, he becomes even a more cold hearted, ruthless, blood thirsty killer than the Fireflies', as he goes completely delusional as ""the righteous arm of god."" Here Zombie does the unbelievable, as murderous & cold blooded killers the Fireflies' are, one of the most ruthless in cinema, Sherriff Wydell character goes so over the edge in his bloody revenge that you actually start feeling sorry for the Fireflies! William Forsythe should of been nominated for a Oscar for his performance! As a matter of fact, all the characters, dialog, & acting are absolute perfection in this film! It really goes to show how many great actors there are that get forgotten in the Hollywood shuffle!

As ""the Devils Rejects"" starts with a bang, it ends with a bang, in one of the most memorable violent endings in cinema since ""The Wild Bunch."" One can really get caught up in the moment of the Fireflies' family bond of not willing to be taken a live, & to take as many of the opposition with them as they can, before their inescapable demise. This is a text book example of character study, & director Zombie really makes a statement for his art & what a movie can bring to the screen! A movie you won't forget, & repays you with repeated viewings, each one as good as the last!
