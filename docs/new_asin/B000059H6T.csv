1405196,5,B000059H6T,"This is an especially fine piece of television drama. The screenplay is intelligent and witty, and inspires a real interest in the material and the characters. Gambon and Waddell are outstanding among an almost faultless cast. The characters of Molly and Cynthia are endearing at a human level, but also fascinating as emblems of the cultural and social changes - both limitations and possibilities - affecting women in the 19th century. Neither is a spokeswoman for any  '-ism', but each provides a moving and articulate response to the greater issues of power and responsibility. The emerging scientific challenges to religious and social (and familial) orthodoxies, also explored, are dramatised neither self-consciousnessly nor by imposing a false note upon the narrative of several ordinary lives. I found this story worth savouring and re-viewing.",992304000,4,853,5.462121212121212
1405197,5,B000059H6T,"Are you in a funk because you can recite Lizzie's lines along with her in Pride and Prejudice, hum every piano note in the score of Persuasion, match all the facial expressions of Colonel Brandon in Sense and Sensibility? Are you wondering if there's anything left to watch on TV after you've memorized all the Jane Austen BBC productions?
Then make a cup of hot tea and sink into the world of Elizabeth Glaskell's Wives and Daughters. It's a superb adaptation of an excellent book that combines wit, pathos, humor, social commentary and wonderful characterizations. This video will easily slip into place as one of your BBC treasures.",990835200,25,635,4.888888888888889
1405198,5,B000059H6T,"This was a great series and I found myself intrigued and eagerly awaiting what would happen next. Generally a bit slow mvoing, it still held your interest. The costumes, locations and sets were gorgeous. Filled with pathos, touchy social situations, and your differing social levels or places in society it moved along steadily and kept your interest with a good script, hilarious dialogue and rich, beliveable characterizations. You could empathize readily with the main character and you wanted to see what would happen to this innocent young woman.
Although I mentioned that the pace was a bit slow, I found it enjoyable. Through the slower pace you felt the tensions, the romantic longings and the supressed feelings. You could actually feel the hardship Molly suffered in silence and the pain of her bottled feelings. The actress who played Molly was superb and you found yourself rooting for her while everyone around her seemingly calm presence went a bit batty. I guess we all feel like Molly from time to time! Again, the locations and the clothing added to the drama immensely.  Most incredible! If you love period pictues, you will love this one.
Reading the other commentators I must say:
I don't think it is even reasonable to compare Wives and Daughters with A&E's Pride and Prejudice. Let's face it, P&P was amazing. This series has it's own charms as well, but it is an altogether different story with a different theme and tonality. Give credit where credit is due. As much as we all love Pride and Prejudice, we should give other ""period "" pictures credit without constantly holding it up to the light of A&E's wonderful Pride and Prejudice. I know it is hard not to, I have caught myself doing the very same thing!
The author of W&D, Gaskell, really was quite a different writer than Jane Austen. Although many of us find it hard to believe, there are other authors out there beyond the wonderful Jane Austen! I am trying to tell myself that and expand.",989280000,8,1972,4.8
1405199,5,B000059H6T,"After seeing the mini-series on PBS, I just had to read the book and buy the DVD! The same production team that made the wonderful 1996 adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"" did a superb job in adapting ""Wives and Daughters."" The cast also does justice to the way the characters were written by Mrs. Gaskell -- my only reservations were Keely Hawes as the beautiful Cynthia (her hair style was very unappealing; in ""Our Mutual Friend"" she is ten times more good-looking), and Anthony Howell as Roger had to grow on me after a few viewings to be fully appreciated. But Justine Waddell just shines as Molly, and Bill Paterson as Mr. Gibson and Sir Michael Gambon as Squire Hamley are in top form (the latter justly deserving all the kudos and awards he received in the UK).
I was immensely pleased with the 3-disc DVD. The first two have each two episodes, as shown on TV, with scene selection capabilities (my only complaint is that they do not have any subtitles available). The picture is crystal clear and very sharp. Other BBC productions, such as P&P and Emma, which are much darker, don't age particularly well, but the brightness in Wives and Daughters makes it fresh and the quality equals that of a feature film.
The third disc is reserved for the extra features: cast bios (the print could have been a bit larger) and two ""featurettes"", ""Who the Dickens is Mrs. Gaskell?"" and the ""Making-of"" of Wives and Daughters. The Making-of is just delightful. It runs 20 minutes long, and shows a lot of cast-member interviews (some in modern clothes, which is a real kick -- Anthony Howell in jeans and t-shirt! Justine Waddell in a bath robe!) and they all provide a lot of valuable insight into the characters. The documentary on Mrs. Gaskell is interesting, but the first 15 minutes (out of 50) are the best, as they again show more behind-the-scenes of Wives and Daughters. The rest mostly follows a group of Gaskell enthusiasts as they visit the places she lived in and discuss her other works.
If you enjoyed the book and the mini-series, buy the DVD -- it is worth every penny!",989193600,54,2082,4.644986449864499
1405200,5,B000059H6T,"This is just a brilliant adaptation. I personally think that it is even better made than 'Pride and Prejudice'(I mean the TV series). The whole cast did a wonderful job in acting out this wonderful Gaskell novel in such an authentic way that it just draws you to the characters and the storyline as much as Mrs. Gaskell's novel did to her readers, and  Molly is so lovely that you just can't help but have to love her.
However if you haven't read the novel yet, I definitely recommend you to do so, for I do believe the novel is even better than the series, and that it definitely worths a read!",988588800,6,595,4.3125
1405201,5,B000059H6T,"""Wives and Daughters"" is adapted from the unfinished Victorian novel of Mrs. Elizabeth Gaskell and is produced by the same creative geniuses that gave us A&E/BBC's 1995 ""Pride and Prejudice.""
This story centers around girl-next-door Molly Gibson (Justine Waddell of ""Mansfield Park,"" ""Tess"" and ""Great Expectations"") and her father, the town doctor (Bill Patterson). Their idyllic lives are turned upside down when Mr. Gibson remarries the selfish, self-absorbed Claire Fitzpatrick (Francesca Annis) and her beautiful daughter Cynthia (Keeley Hawes of ""Our Mutual Friend"") join the household.  The brothers Osborne (Tom Hollander) and Roger (handsome newcomer Anthony Howell who reminds me of a young Mel Gibson) Hamley add romantic interest to the tale. However, the Hamleys come from old English stock and the squire Hamley (veteran actor Michael Gambon) desires his sons to marry into ""wealthy old English families.""  Before long, Molly falls for Roger and Roger falls for Cynthia and we, the viewers, find some surprising discoveries along the way!!
Memorable supporting characters include the goodhearted Browning sisters, town gossip Mrs. Goodenough, mysterious Mr. Preston (Iain Glen) and the aristocratic Cumnor family.  Justine Waddell is luminous as Molly and Michael Gambon and Francesca Annis turn in memorable performances.  The scenery, costumes and production values are all excellent.  Screenwriter Andrew Davies - who also penned P&P - gives us a satisfying, romantic new ending that would make Mrs. Gaskell proud.  I loved every moment of this adaptation! If you are an Anglophile, enjoy a great love story or are a fan of Mrs. Gaskell, this is the film for you!!!",982368000,250,1682,5.474903474903475

1405297,5,B000059H6T,"If you're looking to move beyond Jane Austen in your viewing and reading pleasure, try Elizabeth Gaskell. This is a great story, which could just as easily be called ""Fathers and Sons."" The settings and costuming are superb. You don't get much better than Francesca Annis and Justine Waddell. There is plenty about class conflict, the proud taking a fall, and the humble being exalted. You could see it as exploring the questions: Who is really a lady? Who is really a gentleman? But it's not a great social novel in the sense of some of Gaskell's other works (such as North and South)/ It's more about individual people and their relationships with family and friends. Highly recommended.",1480291200,2,689,4.8474576271186445

1405313,5,B000059H6T,"A very enjoyable story, Wives and Daughters reminds me a great deal of the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice, a personal favorite.  The story is filled with quirky, overly class conscious characters who find themselves in various uncomfortable positions.  The actors and actresses absolutely nail their roles.  I genuinely liked the characters and sympathized with them as their stories unfold.  The DVDs themselves are high quality and convenient to use, since my internet service is highly unreliable.

1405338,4,B000059H6T,"This is a well done period drama based upon a novel by Elizabeth Gaskell, who was sort of a 19th century Jane Austen.  This story centers around a girl whose father is a doctor.  Her father having been widowed when she was young, she's accustomed to being a Daddy's girl without interference.  However, he decides to remarry and the wife he chooses is a crafty woman who quickly sabotages everything that the girl holds dear.  She's left without recourse to defend herself from the woman's wily ways.  However, thankfully, we do have Lady Harriet who intercedes on the girl's behalf and after some difficulties, all ends well.  This story has elements of both Cinderella and a 19th century ""mean girls"".  Somehow, it wasn't as stirring as ""Cranford"" or some of the other series that are based upon Elizabeth Gaskell's writings. In fact, I even found it to be quite weighty at times.

The wicked stepmother is superbly narcissistic; the heroine is lovely and of High Moral Character; the femme fatale foil is actually forgivable, and I only wish that the hero would fall in love with ME.

The only questionable note was that toward the end of the film, some costuming anachronisms intruded: the aristocratic friend starts to sport a hairstyle that nobody of the era would have dreamed of wearing (not now, either, but maybe it looked good when the movie was made), and  in the last scene the heroine is wandering around in jodhpurs.",1419552000,,725,4.934426229508197

1405612,5,B000059H6T,"A Victorian Stroll through the Viewing of the 3rd Episode of BBCs ""Wives & Daughters""
 ""Wives and Daughters"" is a beautiful BBC mini-series consisting four episodes. The costumes, manors and landscapes transport the viewer back to the Victorian Age of upper middle class society. Molly is the young heroine, the only daughter of Mr. Gibson, a respected widower and doctor. Mollys country existence with her father is shattered as the prim stepmother, Clair, assumes the role as wife, leading the domestic household with new London fashion and expectations. With Mollys world spinning it is a great joy for her to gain a stepsister, but their quick friendship is challenged along the way as Cynthia quickly reveals her gift of enticing men. A splendid embodiment of the Victorian Age, the third episode involves themes of the public and private, roles of women, science, letters and reputation, each of which are gracefully attended to. Clair finds herself in trouble as she breaks the private walls of medicine when she reveals to Mr. Gibson her knowledge of a particular characters illness, admitting that she overheard him speaking with another doctor about a patient she has interests in. As the episode continues there are other moments of the public and private ideals, such as Cynthia receiving letters from her fianc. She shares any information with Molly that is not romantic. She alerts Molly to the sections she may read and because of the expectations established Molly is entrusted in reading the letter. Clair would fail this test of privacy. The groundbreaking importance of science is imperative of the Age and is highlighted through Rogers scholarly endeavors as he travels to study beetles in Africa. The third episode also gracefully approaches the roles of women concerning how they are expected to dress, act and behave. The sense of propriety and modesty is tested throughout by Clair, Cynthia and the beloved Molly. Cynthia is continually being corrected by Mr. Gibson and Molly to change her flirtatious ways and to not be secretive. Molly instructs her older friends to refrain from gossip about Cynthia due to the frailty of a womans reputation. The third episode beautifully threads together the tapestry of these themes, leading the viewer through the English history of the Victorian Age.",1417478400,2,2316,5.143236074270557

1405728,4,B000059H6T,"I really enjoyed this movie. I was either relating to Molly' (the main character) (predicaments or learning from them as an objective observer. I loved how she maintained her confidence, staying true to herself no matter what the situation and whenever gossip tried to rear its ugly head, she quickly shut it down. She was not demoralized nor did she ever compromise or integrity to please other people. Lolly portrayed  one of the greatest of what it means to be honest and trustworthy I've seen portrayed on film and it really resonated with me because I'm at a point in my life where prudence is extremely important.

I also liked how there was no real villian, just imperfect people living imperfect lives with every striving to be realize their dreams and obtain their desires. Even the most selfish and sinister characters had redeeming qualities and by the end of the film , there was not a single person I could say I did not applarpeciate.

The only thing I would have liked to have seen more of was Molly being happy. She spent a lot of time being sad, confused, or in anx ha ugly been thrust into the drama of all the people in her life. To see her being wooed by a handsome suitor would have been lovely but perhaps that would have made more like so many others. It was a well made film and the storyline was very easy to follow.

Cynthia and her mother 's turmutious relationship reminded me of Rose's and her mother's  relationship on Titanic so that was really cool to see lol",1414022400,,1491,4.507407407407407

It wasn't much slower than your average period piece, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. It was well cast and well performed. I must say that my favorite character was Roger Hamley, played by Anthony Howell. I loved his character in the book and he was just as good in the series. I really liked how they showed a little of his travels in Africa; in the book you only hear about it from letters.

Get the DVD set for now.
Four stars for this Five star series only because of this Blu-Ray set.

After I purchased a multi-region Blu-Ray player, I reordered a copy.

1406066,3,B000059H6T,I liked the show it just didn't seem to have a plot that really grabbed you. If I was interrupted watching it I don't think I would've gone back to finish it. However it was a good little series. Probably better as a book.,1398729600,,222,4.068181818181818

1406068,5,B000059H6T,"This film hews pretty closely to the book of the same title by Elizabeth Gaskell.  The actors suit their roles ~ especially like Michael Gambon as the squire.  The fashions and the interiors of some of England's finest homes are featured.  The plot has several subplots going on and is occasionally melodramatic.  The basic story is one of a young woman, Molly, whose father, a country doctor, is widowed.  They are happily a team until the father decides suddenly to remarry.  The new stepmother is a pain, although her daughter is pretty good company for Molly.  Molly eventually finds her own true love.  There's not a primary central conflict to give it cohesion.  But I liked the insight into the 1800's social structure.  4.5 stars",1398211200,,737,4.824

Just like in Austen and some fairy tales, the Dad decides his daughter needs a mom and marries a not-so-nice lady (who has her own daughter), effectively turning his daughter's life into something a little short of a constant nightmare.

Splendid acting, beautiful dresses, superb story line.  Grab some snacks and settle in for a long enjoyable night, or watch over a couple days (very hard to do!).",1398038400,2,652,4.803571428571429

I think the acting almost lives up to the brilliance of Gaskell's writing. Justine Waddell does a fine job as Molly, she is able to act with just her facial expressions. When she looks at Roger, her love shows in her eyes, as does the hurt she feels before he comes to his senses. Anthony Howell does a fine job too.

  take acting to heART (sic). Then - they gather themselves at locations that don't exist anymore (they never did exist here) in
  costumes washed in a river of time amid a living museum of you-name-it, without the presence of anything betraying
  so much as a whisper of our immediate world. They recreate a life gone waaaaayy over the horizon and place it so thoughtfully,
  so caringly in our ""living room"" that we are lovingly bathed in THEIR story - oblivious to our own.

1406194,5,B000059H6T,"This is a miniseries worth checking out! I was initially hesitant at purchasing it since I hadn't heard much about it. I'm so glad I did! There are a whole host of great actors in this- particularly Michael Gambon, who plays such an emotionally heart-wrenching widow and father to two grown boys, his eldest of whom, Osborne, consistently disappoints Gambon and his wife, arguably leading to her illness and death.

Justine Waddell plays the lead female role of Molly, the neighbor to Gambon and his family, and she does so handidly. She plays Molly so intelligently and with poise, but also sticks up for what she believes in. Molly and her doctor father make a family of two for several years until she reaches the age of 17 and he decides to remarry the governess, Hyacinth, of a very wealthy lady. Hyacinth has a grown daughter of her own, Cynthia, who is about the same age as Molly. Eventually both Hyacinth and Cynthia  come to live with Molly and her father. Initially, I found myself liking the governess/step-mother and found Molly's difficulties with her to be over-stated, but as time wore on (the production is 300 minutes long) I too became annoyed with the step-mother. She is, as many step-mothers go, pretty insufferable. She's spoiled, selfish, pretentious, and obsessed with her daughter marrying well. The step-sister, Cynthia, isn't so bad. I was expecting her character to be pitted against Molly's in a very Cinderella-esque plot line, but they actually become close friends. Perhaps too close as Molly quickly finds herself embroiled in a controversy with Cynthia and her many attachments with men. Her reputation is put at stake as the busy bodies in the town think Molly is having trysts with a much older man, a scoundrel of a gentleman who is actually interested in Cynthia, and has been for many years, to the point of being dangerously, scarily obsessed. All of this is going on simultaneous to Cynthia having accepted an engagement to Gambon's second son, Roger, a scientist who proposed to her before heading off to Africa on an expedition. Molly doesn't realize it fully before Roger proposes to Cynthia, but once he does Molly realizes how much in love with him she is. She has known him all her life but Roger hasn't taken much notice of her, except to acknowledge Molly as the sister he never had.

I thought I would find the scenes of Roger on expedition tiresome and something the viewer merely had to get through for the plot to progress in order for him to come back and realize that he actually loved Molly not Cynthia. In actuality, the scenes of him in Africa were actually pretty interesting and poetic as we listen to his letters to Cynthia and the discoveries he's made.

Perhaps the saddest part of the plot is the story surrounding Osborn, first born son of Gambon;s character and his wife. There were high expectations set for Osborne, which of course, he fails to meet. He fails out of school and doesn't seem to find something to succeed at, aside from spending his father's money. He secretly falls in love with a french servant and once their affair is discovered she loses her job and must return home to France. Osborne couldn't live without her and pursued her to France, marries her and gets her pregnant. Perhaps I'm a little jaded, but I really thought a wealthy man such as Osborne would have left her because his father really disapproves of anything or anyone French. Nevertheless, he sticks by her, sending her money and visiting her whenever he can. Sadly, their happiness was not meant to last as a tragedy occurs and Gambon must come to grips with the news that his oldest son was so afraid of him he was never able to tell him the truth about his life. I was immensely, ridiculously pleased and happy however, when Gambon accepts the woman and Osborne's son into his household and dotes on the toddler like a good grandfather ought to. That was perhaps the best part, and I think Gambon was my favorite character followed very closely by Molly.

I love that one could probably make a case that Molly Gibson is a feminist in a story originally written in 1865. She's so amazingly forthright and stands up for what she believes in. I love that her father raised her to be an educated young woman. Of course, he doesn't necessarily like it when she helps Cynthia out of her romantic fixes, but he does allow her a pretty decent amount of freedom for a single girl who technically ought to be married already.

I love when there's a character you can root for, one you feel passionately for, and you can feel that for Molly. This is a DVD adaptation that is worth every penny! I heartily encourage anyone who's on the hunt for their next BBC miniseries, like I was when I purchased it, that you should definitely pursue this one!",1389484800,5,4792,4.671800947867299

The story is filled with interest and surprise along the way. Molly Gibson is the complete opposite of her carefree step-sister, Cynthia, who goes from man to man in her life as if she cared little for any of the poor men that she leaves behind.

1406258,5,B000059H6T,"I enjoy shows like Breaking Bad and Hell on Wheels, etc, but it's such a wonderfully relaxed pleasure watching Wives and Daughters and never having to look away because of violence or gore. Based on Elizabeth Gaskell's novel of the same name, Wives and Daughters is a gorgeous costume drama of love and class that becomes more rich, suspenseful and layered with each episode. The story is centered around Molly Gibson, the lively, unaffected daughter of the town doctor, who's a widower. Their lives are turned topsy turvy when the father marries a Mrs. Bennett like widow with a daughter of her own who's just about Molly's age but as flighty as Molly is reliable. Even though the girls are a study in contrasts they love each other, and when they fall for the same man they both, in their own way, try to do the right thing--the plot is too layered to make the stepsister a villain. Mrs. Gaskell was unable to finish the novel before her death, but the miniseries conclusion is satisfyingly sigh inducing. Wives and Daughters is the third series based on novels by Mrs. Gaskell that I've adored, so I love that this set includes a 55 minute ""short"" about her.",1380067200,12,1161,4.640776699029126

1406274,5,B000059H6T,"If you got addicted to ""Downton Abbey"" or ""Pride and Prejudice"" it's great to have another miniseries of the same excellent quality. As someone put it in a review of ""Lark Rise to Candleford"", ""BBC is a dab hand at period dramas."" They certainly are. This drama is based on a book by Elizabeth Gaskell, a contemporary of Charlotte Bronte and CharlesDickens. Her characters generally are more middle class rather than landed gentry and this story is no different; we follow the coming-of-age of Molly Gibson, who is the daughter of a physician. Molly's honesty and simplicity are in contrast to that of her new stepmother, Hyacinthe, who is a nasty piece of work cloaked in genteel words and acts that mask a viperish selfish nature and cruelty. Her daughter promises to be a carbon copy of her nature but lo, she is as put upon by her mother as Molly is. The two become friends.

The story has characters of contrast; the good Molly and Cynthia, the feckless Osborne, the mean Hyacinthe and Mr. Preston. There are plenty of scandalous secrets. Mrs Gaskell did not finish this novel before her death, but it's been admirably adapted with hints from Gaskell's notes by Andrew Davies, screenwriter. The cast is wonderful, with Michael Gambon and Francesca Annis adding their seasoned skills to the ensemble. If you liked ""Cranford"", I think this is even better, and if you liked ""Downton Abbey"" it will tide you over until the next season is aired.",1379030400,2,1445,4.78

1406280,5,B000059H6T,"Where has this film been or where have I been concerning this film?  I found it in passing in a library period film search and then got busy and almost didn't play it.  So very glad I did.  I understand the author is a lesser known for some reason, and there is a move to bring her works to the forefront.  If this isn't the cream of her crop, it is likely close.  This film stands up against the most popular period presentations of the last several decades.  Excellently produced, spot-on casting and portrayals, overall even pace.  The surpassing feature, however, is the emotional depth of the characters.  These people come to life in full dimension.  There's an even flow of them, without so much extreme bad or good. Along with that, characters embody weaknesses and vulnerabilities along with their strengths. It's an effective and affecting film experience.

I ran into something on this one that happens with me from time to time on this type of film, and that is the variance between my taste in looks and beauty and those of the time.  For example here, between the two son, Osbourne is said to be the handsomest and Roger to be plain in looks.  I find it the opposite.  Found this in ""Pride & Prejudice"" as well, preferring Elizabeth Bennett's looks over her sister, Jane, who is credited the beauty in the film.

Regardless, this is a super outstanding period film I will be ready to share with all my friends who enjoy these and definitely add to my favorites.  It conveys its characters and the story gently, but very effectively.  There is much of interest and variety.  It is realistic in showing flaws in persons and customs, who change in some respects, but do not undergo unbelievable transformations.  I like it that the film demonstrates the reward of patience and endurance and the folly of self-indulgence and stubborn prejudice.  There is wit, humor, depth and shallowness of character, joys and sorrows, generosity and self-centeredness, wisdom and frivolity.

Dr. Gibson may well become one of my all-time favorite male characters from fiction.  He is gratifying throughout, though tried and vexed, weighs in like gold in the punches.  While open and accommodating to his new female household additions, he never compromises his tender watch care for his own beloved daughter.  I love it when he tells the squire that she needs to come home now and receive some cossetting herself.  And that he calls her ""Goosie"" so affectionately.  He holds his own with the gentry along with the regular folk.  He and his faithful girl are two of the most valued and respected members of their community. The new wife and step-mother is also a remarkable character, for a different reason, with her unrelenting zeal to tweak all about her.  I love it that, though giving her proper place, the two girls do not allow her to ""live in their place,"" but make their voices heard with spirit.  She was entirely well played here, giving much interest throughout. Though we see her some mollified at the end by life's vicissitudes, we also sense she will definitely rise again.  I really enjoyed the two girls hitting it off.  Though light weight on steady character, Cynthia brings some playfulness and fun in needed relief to Molly's older-than-her-years intensity.

I definitely want to read the book and will likely purchase both.  Many of these characters have a classic quality about them, the kind that becomes a type of reference.  I'll also be seeking out this author's other works and will likely find them keepers as well if they are anything like this marvel.",1377734400,,3577,4.801963993453355

So many authors, when writing about situations about a second wife and children from both sides of such a marriage tend to villify at least one of the characters. Mrs. Gaskell does not do that.  She manages to present both strengths and weakness's of such characters.  As a result, one can relate to her characters in a way that is both helpful and realistic.

It is almost impossible not to admire Mrs.  Gaskell  for her courage in writing about important issues in a time when woman writers were thought to be largely concerned with recipes and child  rearing.",1377129600,4,655,4.643478260869565

1406361,3,B000059H6T,"Going to buck the trend here.  I have a growing collection of British costume dramas, but this one may not make it back to the shelf (I'll probably donate it to the library).  I'll say right up front that I haven't even finished it; I watched the first DVD and that was enough.  It's predictable, plodding and I'm having a hard time liking any of the characters.  On the positive side, sets and costumes are perfect.

Spent the miserable, rainy weekend watching ""Cranford"" and ""North and South"", thoroughly enjoyed (no - loved) both, then turned my attention to ""Wives and Daughters"".  Sadly, it just couldn't keep my attention.  Molly comes off as just another Daddy's girl, somewhat sweet but also spoiled and shallow.  In fact, all the characters seem to suffer from lack of character development.  I just don't care what happens to any of them.

The outstanding series ""Cranford"" is based on a series of sketches by Gaskell, and the writers did a wonderful job of weaving them together to create one cohesive and entertaining story.  While ""Wives and Daughters"" is written as a single story (albeit unfinished), it comes across as choppy, jerking from one scene to the next.

I suppose I'll finish watching it eventually, but I don't hold out much hope for liking it any better.  Three stars because it is pretty to look at, and has some great talent in it, although I think they are wasted.

Update:  well, I finally finished ""Wives and Daughters"", and I stand by my original rating.  It's okay, not great, and if you are into British period dramas then it is worth a look.  It cannot, however, compare to ""North and South"", A&E's ""Pride and Prejudice"" or ""Cranford"" or a host of other 19th century costume dramas.

The whole thing reminds me of ""David Copperfield"".  David is the most boring character in the story, surrounded by more interesting people, and he just reacts to them.  Molly, the alleged heroine of ""Wives and Daughters"", is in the same predicament.  Her stepsister has all the drama, as does the elder Hamley son, whose name escapes me for the moment.  Roger and Molly are indeed made for each other, as they are both somewhat insufferable.  Whatever happened to Preston?  Are we to believe that he just gave up on Cynthia after Molly confronted him?  Not believable in the least, imo.  Even Willoughby came riding back to try and see Marianne one more time.

Francesca Annis (Hyancinth) is wonderful, just annoying enough, but not an evil stepmother.  She is fantastic as Lady Ludlow in ""Cranford"".

There are a couple of characters (who shall remain nameless) that come across as...well...characters...but overall the acting is quite good and the settings quite believable and lovely; definitely worth the money for the enjoyment factor.",1364947200,,677,5.053571428571429

I find it is nice to have a story told without hearing & seeing words to shock, while watching sex scenes as if I didn't know what sex is or how to do the act because todays writers in the States are so poorly educated they don't understand the how to tell a good story with the use of words which someone over the age of 8 in any other country understands without using or seeing the sex act performed.
This is also why go to the movies of pre-code/post-code this men and women tell a story with each word and action of the actor that you understand fully the story and enjoy the English use to it's full use.
So sad but it appears we now have to look to Countries like England/Australia/New Zealand/Canada to find ""real"" movies and programs of this standard. Well worth watching (and good if you are a mother who would like your children to understand how to speak English well.",1364515200,,1043,4.22

1406396,5,B000059H6T,"This surely is one of the most perfect film adaptations - and, indeed, one of the most perfect films - ever made.

It is literally flawless in its casting, acting, photography, costumes, and clever directorial touches.

Elizabeth Gaskell's novel has been described as an under-appreciated masterpiece, and I think that assessment accurate. The most remarkable aspect of her characters is that in all of them we see at least two aspects, both how they might be seen as correct or elevated or admirable in their actions or as foolish or malicious or criminal, depending upon the viewer.

It is this quality which takes the story far beyond what we might expect from a romantic book of the time. There is humor and subtlety as in Jane Austen's best earlier work, but there is also genuine insight into the human condition.

And the producers of this adaptation have captured the quality to perfection, taking the film far beyond mere costume drama. There is always depth and subtlety at work here even though the story is largely light and romantic. There are few Hollywood films which could stand being compared.

There isn't an actor cast here I would change, and that is not something you can often say about films.

The locations and sets are breathtaking.

Watching the parade of gorgeous women's costumes alone is like walking through the halls of some fabulous museum.

And the director has handled this wealth of material with the most exquisite judgment.

There is so much more depth in these stories than in the ones today. So I enjoyed this movie for that. The acting and scenery are all wonderful, and the story is very full, with lots of characters and lots of stuff happening.

I did not read the book before I watched the movie, as I do most older novels that become movies, so I was somewhat unaware at how small a part of the story the romance is. I had anticipated that like other adaptations at the center of the story would be a love story, and while in a sense that is the case, it's a very internal one because the hero / heroine are seperated through out most of the movie, Roger, the romantic lead spends all but the last 20 minutes or so of the last episode in Africa, and you know as you watch the movie that he will not have any idea of Molly's feelings for him, or a chance to develop his own until he returns, I found myself becoming anxious for his return for that reason alone. The ending is sweet, but somewhat underwhelming for this reason. Even having said that I am happy I have seen it, it was enjoyable to watch, I just don't know if this will be a North and South that I'll watch over and over again.",1354233600,,1339,4.091254752851711

But this masterpiece was written so well, that each character displays both their light and their dark and somehow make us find ourselves wondering if we'd do the same thing were we in their shoes.
I usually hate when protagonists are made to look like saints who only feel love and empathy (like they often are written to be in novels), but this one...well, watch it and see if you don't fall in love with the girl who is most often overlooked for her ""prettier"" sister.

1406423,5,B000059H6T,"In 1999, the BBC almost singlehandedly revived interest in the neglected works of Mrs Elizabeth Gaskell with their dramatization of her final novel, WIVES AND DAUGHTERS.  Often forgotten amongst her contemporaries, Gaskell wrote with a deft insight into the social classes and invested her characters with strong moral cores.

In WIVES AND DAUGHTERS, Gaskell created the closest she ever came to what could be described as a ""fairytale heroine"" - Molly Gibson.  Molly (played with great feeling and sensitivity by Justine Waddell) lives with her widowed father Dr Gibson (Bill Paterson) in the tight-knit village of Hollingford.  Molly's secure, sheltered world comes to an end when her father announces that he is to marry Hyacinth Kirkpatrick (Francesca Annis), a widowed former governess whose employment at The Towers, the estate of Lady Cumnor, will soon be surplus to requirements.

Hyacinth brings with her her own capricious daughter, Cynthia (Keeley Hawes), who is quite close in age to Molly, but her exact opposite in every other respect.  As the two girls find themselves unwitting rivals in love, Molly is increasingly drawn to the two sons of Squire Hamley (Michael Gambon), who'se ill wife (Penelope Wilton) Molly helped nurse in her last months.  Eldest son Osborne (Tom Hollander) is bookish, frail and hides a heavy secret, whilst younger son Roger (Anthony Howell) shares Molly's fascination with science and geography.  Molly is heartbroken when Roger pursues an engagement with Cynthia, before leaving on an African expedition.  To Molly's frustration, Cynthia doesn't seem interested in Roger's activities, leaving Molly to keep up the correspondence.  Cynthia's indifference, as Molly will soon learn, seems to be tied up in the figure of Mr Preston (Iain Glen), a local overseer, and it's not long until Molly (operating as Cynthia's ""cat's paw"") and Preston become targets of gossip within the Hollingford community when their ""trysts"" are discovered...

WIVES AND DAUGHTERS presents a wide variety of roles, all meaty assignments for the incredible roster of talents that the BBC has brought together.  Justine Waddell (""Great Expectations"", ""The Mystery of Natalie Wood"") wisely underplays her Molly Gibson, contrasting beautifully with Keeley Hawes' (""Tipping the Velvet"", ""Upstairs Downstairs"") vivacious, enchanting Cynthia.  Francesca Annis (""Partners in Crime"", ""Cranford"") is ideal as the preening, insufferably snobbish Hyacinth.

Screenwriter Andrew Davies has leisurely plotted this version in four 75-minute episodes.  Davies beautifully captures the array of fascinating characters and their respective locales.  The events in WIVES AND DAUGHTERS take place in a variety of locations (and their respective class divides) from the village of Hollingford, to the estate of Lady Cumnor and the grounds of Hamley Hall.  The art design and photography is effective in its effort to delineate the boundaries of these different ""worlds"", by casting the Hollingford scenes in soft, natural shades, the mansion of Lady Cumnor in steely greys and whites; and Hamley Hall in earthy browns and reds.  Mrs Gaskell would have been delighted with this production.

There is also a 1971 BBC miniseries which I sincerely hope sees the light of day on DVD in the future (that is, if it survived the extensive ""BBC archive purge""), but until then this is the most delightful, skilful screen version of Gaskell's final great work.",1336348800,5,3448,5.435272045028142

I do love the portrayals of all of the main and secondary characters although I felt the character of Mr. Preston could have been fleshed out a little more and would loved to have seen more of Rosamund Pike as Lady Harriet Cumnor. I thought the lisping Lady Cumnor, portrayed by Barbara Leigh-Hunt, was spot on.

One of my favorite scenes is Michael Gambon grieving at Osborne's deathbed, refusing to eat because his son ""will never eat again."" I though it was one of the better grief scenes I've ever seen. I thought the final scene in the African desert was perfect and a perfect ending.

  In the plot, the father won't let the guy see his daughter because he might give her scarlet fever...but the father, who has been exposed can be with the daughter? And they give you the impression that the couple marry right away..wouldn't that be exposing her to scarlet fever? And going to Africa on the heels of that, when you may come down with scarlet fever...really odd.

1406458,4,B000059H6T,"This production is tremendously well acted, and it sticks fairly closely to the original story. Due to the limitations of conversion to screen, some things were cut - such as Mollys missing Cynthias wedding due to lingering cold/flu and her resulting stay in The Towers, and a few other things.

I think Mrs Gibson comes off as a bit more of a twit in the book, and Cynthia as more of a twit in the film. The film also left out the whole storyline about Rogers wranglership - which came with a stipend (or fellowship) that allowed him to finance his brothers clandestine marriage & travel, and that Rogers whole trip to Africa was a way to make money to allow his father to continue with a project to improve the property - thus improving his fathers feelings about himself as able to provide work for his tenants. There are some things that the film does which surprised me and which I thought were really good - such as Lady Cumnors speech impediment - not written into the book (in my memory) but which is entirely possible and highly amusing. I also adore the way that they dramatized Cynthias teenage outbursts, running out of rooms and door slamming - and the Miss Brownings voices and reactions.

I do wish Roger wasn't quite so handsome in the film, as he was not described as such in the book. The film talks about several classes in the social hierarchy - focusing more on the classes which are seen more or less as social equals - with the words, deeds, feelings & lives of servants noticeably absent.

Overall - its quite a good production and its telling a time old tale of the conflicts of teenagers with their parents over who they want to date, young men striving to make their own ways while remaining close to their fathers.",1316563200,2,1742,4.506329113924051

I won't bother going into the story as so many have done so here. I will say that all of the acting is wonderful, I especially love Molly and her father.

The sets, accents, little details are 'right on' and if you enjoy such things you will find this movie thorough and thoroughly enjoyable. I've seen little items used in this movie that I had not seen before, and that is always a fun plus!

The relationships and issues are not at all boring, they are deep and well thought out. I didn't feel like I was watching a soap opera (as I did in another review) but like I was following a main story, offset by a few very interesting side issues.

The length. It's kind of long but in my mind it never drags or seems to have any fluff/ filler like I'd say Middlemarch did. The scenes in Africa were a little out of character but necessary, too.

And the cast surrounding her is full of memorable character actors, including MICHAEL GAMBON who almost steal the show single-handedly with his gruff interpretation of the frustrated country squire, and BILL PATERSON as Molly's wise and sympathetic father.

FRANCESCA ANNIS is a revelation as the giddy step-mother from hell, anxious to see her vain and shallow daughter (KEELEY HAWES) married to a man of wealth and position no matter what the circumstances are. But the flaw in the cast comes with Miss Hawes, who is seriously in need of dubbing to make her dialog clear to American viewers. She drops her voice mid-sentence in many a scene, barely above a whisper, and her enunciation is enough to drive Professor Higgins to distraction. No subtitles on the DVD I purchased.

She is the only element in the large cast that is worthy of any criticism. IAIN GLEN makes an impression as Mr. Preston, the mysterious figure in the story whose attraction to the shallow Cynthia (KEELEY HAWES) is hard to understand given that Justine Waddell is so enchanting as the ""plain"" heroine.

Wonderfully produced in the best British tradition and based on the book by Elizabeth Gaskell, it's visually striking and set against backgrounds and settings that perfectly capture the period atmosphere. For lovers of Victorian melodrama, this is a must see with an excellent background score. It could have used a stronger ending for the final scene in the rain, but it's satisfying enough on all other counts.",1307491200,3,1685,5.0978260869565215

Even the Who's Who guide to the stars will assist your understanding of who is who as well as the level of the skill of the cast. A love story built around a village community of activity. All in the Victorian style, proper, and family-friendly. My wife and I LOVED it. Molly (Justine Waddell) and Cynthia (Keeley Hawes) are photogenic as well as facially ultra-expressive. From funny to sad, a glance can say it all. A tip of the beaver skin topper to those gals. Other cast is almost as good, and Lady Cumnor's (Barbara Leigh-Hunt) speech defect is a hoot. And laugh you will at the snootiness and gossipy Mrs. Goodenough (Elizabeth Spriggs.) A gorgeous bevy of girls for the guys, and a solid handful of hunks for the gals to ogle. Scenery you'd travel for, if you could.

1406505,4,B000059H6T,"This adoption of a lesser-known 19th century novel delivers the goods in reliable BBC fashion. This story of a young middle class girl's sentimental education features two tremendous performances. Michael Gambon brings to life the strong-willed squire full of prejudice and spleen but nonetheless with a heart of gold. Francesca Anis is wonderful as Claire, aka Hyacinth, the silly, selfish,snobby stepmother.

Justine Waddell is also good as Molly, the central character, who speaks her mind with commendable directness. The surrounding performances are also very good, which makes this series excellent viewing. But it's not as compelling as some of the other dramatizations of Austen, Bronte or Dickens, probably because the source material is simply not as good.

Elizabeth Gaskell was very popular in the 19th century and well-known as the first biographer of Charlotte Bronte. Her milieu is the subtle divide between the emerging industrial bourgeoisie and the fading landed aristocracy. Yet the producers of this series insisted in placing it in Austen-land, which does no service either to Gaskell or to the immortal Jane. Thus we have the obligatory dance scenes in which the characters twirl around to 18th century minuets which by the time of this novel's setting were as ancient and outmoded as the charleston is for us today.

I said the source material is not as strong as Austen because the plot meanders a little too much and because the characters, apart from Claire and the old squire, are simply not as compelling. Molly is a bit too much of a goody-goody, her beloved Roger is a total goody-goody and their love never got my pulse racing.

Still this series is good stuff -- lovely scenery, nice music, great costumes especially hats and veteran British actors doing their thing.",1276128000,,1799,5.129692832764505

Superb plot interweaving a variety of families in the classic English village.  The main characters are incredibly well done, even those you aren't supposed to like, you like because of the quality of the acting.  Drama, humor, romance and a happy ending.  G rated.

Now her life with her father is shared by a step-mother and step-sister.  To complicate matters, then man she falls in love with decides he is in love with her step-sister (I think we all can sympathize with her).

A distracting feature of the production was that the actress playing the heroine appeared to be painfully thin - one longed to make her sit down for several bowls of stew.

And, of course, the sad story of the brother critically ill and leaving a wife and family. A small criticism is that I thought the production ended on a twee note (the panoramic vision of the couple on the desert heights walking together seemed a little silly) but maybe that is also in the book (which I have not read).",1262131200,,790,4.417808219178082

While Jane Austen has a sense of humor that other writers seem unable to duplicate, she also has a great moral compass to which her exceptional heroines and their heroes adhere.  It is this morality, along with her exceptional character development, that makes her love stories so enveloping.  Although it is not a Jane Austen piece, Wives and Daughters is one of the few additional period pieces that will please all those Jane Austen fans out there.  It is a well done film, with a wonderful love story of a great heroine.  Unlike other period pieces these days that leave me very disappointed, Wives and Daughters presents conflicts without compromising morality, while leaving the viewer happy in the end.",1251417600,5,824,4.774647887323944
1406536,5,B000059H6T,"This series should be more widely viewed than it has been. In short, if you like period, multi-part dramas, I highly recommend this mini-series! It is among my top 5 of all time, including the Jane Austens. For more details, keep reading...

This adaptation of the Elizabeth Gaskell novel takes some patience to get into--like most novels for television. So sit back with your popcorn, knitting, or your own daughters. Gaskell is not as widely known (I hadn't heard of her and I was an English major) as her contemporaries and friends, Charlotte Bronte and George Eliot.

The story clearly sets up female characters who are very different women and sets about exploring and revealing which ones should be considered as a good wife or a loving daughter. Although this may seem sexist to us, in her time, I think Gaskell was progressive to expose the tendency of wealthy males to choose ""trophy wives"" instead of women of intellect and inner strength. Or, if in one case, a gentleman were to marry for love, he may be ostracized for it.

One of the main things I like about this story is that I see a lot of myself in Molly (played to perfection by the lovely Justine Waddell), although she is more patient than I would ever be in her shoes. Molly is lovely in her own right, but she is overlooked because of her class and her status as the ever-present charity case/friend and opinionated do-gooder. In other words, she is the kind of woman the best kind of man would want for a long-term companion, but the man of her dreams becomes enamored with the appropriately annoying Keely Hawes character (Cynthia) instead. Will Molly's sharp, scientific mind be eventually rewarded with the respect she deserves?

Another thing I like about this story is the way Squire Hamley (Michael Gambon) changes and grows. Gambon is brilliant as usual as the stubborn ""slave"" to his class-based worldview until his heart softens through trials and grief. His love for Molly is beautiful and completely devoid of anything scandalous as he ""adopts"" her as a source of comfort. The rest of us have to watch until the ending to find out if one of his sons will ever figure out what the father sees. Gambon has also some gems in the script that are humorous or poignant.

In summary, the story makes interesting points about the nature of familial and romantic love, what a wife or a daughter should be and the kinds of women who win hearts while still being true to themselves--as well as the qualities of the men who learn what to look for.",1249516800,59,2519,4.651685393258427

However some of the acting felt contrived--especially the character of the ridiculous stepmother, as well as the naive/good humored-yet-intelligent Molly (the main character). The actress spent much of the film with an eternally surprised expression, eyebrows raised, mouth half-open. Little complexity or depth, and there were definitely parts where it was hard to believe that she was as smart as all the other characters kept proclaiming.

1406544,5,B000059H6T,"BBC's adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's Wives and Daughters beautifully captures the nuances of family and personal relationships, amidst a Victorian setting. The writing by Andrew Davies [who also gave us Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth] is excellent as is the casting. Added to this are the gorgeous period authentic costumes, the lush landscape of the English countryside and a beautiful score.

The story centers around young Molly [played to perfection by the talented Justine Waddell] who is the daughter of local doctor Dr Gibson [Bill Patterson]. Both father and daughter are very close but the dynamics of their relationship changes with Dr Gibson's remarriage to the self-absorbed and ludicruous Hyacinth [Francesca Annis]. Molly finds herself chafing under the Victorian strictures imposed by her stepmother, and finds some relief with the arrival of her glamorous step-sister, Cynthia [Keeley Hawes]. Both Molly and Cynthia form a friendship though their personalities are polar opposites. Cynthia is vivacious and a social butterfly, and very aware of her charms and effects on the opposite sex whereas Molly is unassuming and possesses a more natural sort of beauty.

The Hamley brothers, Osborne[Tom Hollander] and Roger [Anthony Howell] add romantic interest and Molly is dismayed by Roger's infatuation with Cynthia, as she herself harbors romantic feelings for him. Meanwhile Squire Hamley [Michael Gambon] plays an ambitious man who wishes to see his sons married into the 'right' family, i.e. with proper connections and wealth. The rest of the story deals with what happens to these young people with some revelations to spice things up!

This is one of my favorite BBC period dramas and Andrew Davies' screenplay is fantastic, bringing to life the intricacies of human relationships set within a Victorian setting. Highly recommended!",1232064000,2,1861,5.454861111111111

With that being said the BBC was not releasing miniseries on the heels of the success of Pride and Prejudice, they have been doing miniseries of great books for quite awhile.

Also Elizabeth Gaskell is a very fine writer who understood perhaps better than others the real plight of the lower classes.  She had the rare experience of moving about the city where others did not go because she was the minister's wife.

As for Wives and daughters Molly Gibsons happy little life is turned topsy turvey when her father the local doctor marries a woman who is ridiculous and vain and brings to the marriage her own daughter who is unabashedly vain.  The stepsisters become fast friends despite their very obvious differences in character.  Molly is all politeness, good manners and more awkward than Cynthia who is worldly and outspoken.

Prior to the arrival of Molly's step mother and step sister, Molly has befriended the Hamley's who have two sons the much beloved Osbourne and the lesser discussed Roger Hamley.  Mrs. Gibson desires her daughter to marry Osbourne for he should be worth a good fortune.

The story progresses with Molly being told secrets from every angle that she must conceal.  Including her own secret about a certain Mr. Hamley.

The story is about a widower and his daughter, Molly.  The widower decides that he should remarry to provide his daughter with female companionship.  He marries a lady who also has a daughter, Cynthia, about the same age.  Molly soon goes to visit with a squire's family who has 2 sons, Osborn and Roger.  The film is about the relationship of these 4 characters.

1406575,5,B000059H6T,"Because this dvd is a Masterpiece Theatre production it moves at a slower pace than a made-for-theaters movie.  This allows enough time to develop Elizabeth Gaskell's themes about 18th Century social and economic realities; the changes in men's and women's relationship to the land; and the impact of science and the industrial revolution on the arcane ins and outs of the English class system.  Sounds really dull!  But it also works as just a really good romance.  As usual, Gaskell's points are made using realistic, fully developed, complex characters.  This production is also wonderfully cast (the actors are good-looking even by Hollywood movie standards and great actors) and beautifully filmed.  It's a good story without any additional context, but it is gets even better with a bit of reading about the period and about Gaskell's life and philosophy.  Of course the best read after seeing the movie is the novel itself.  After renting the dvd several times, I decided it was, like the 1995 Masterpiece Theatre productions of ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""North and South"" a dvd that I needed to own.",1202860800,5,1107,5.043956043956044

It turns out that what everyone was saying about it was absolutely right!! This film is masterful and so beautiful!! It's such a masterpiece! I cannot believe that Elizabeth Gaskell is not as well known as Ms. Jane Austen, because we all should definitely be reading more of her works!! I was hooked throughout the whole film, it seemed so true to life. Not only was it a love story, but also it was a life story in that it focused on the humanity of people. I found all walks of life can relate to it. Each character had a distinct personality and way of thought which was depicted very well throughout the film. I loved how it delved into the way of the human mind! And although the book was left unfinished due to Mrs. Gaskell's death, the film had a good version of the possible ending. I would recommend this film to Anyone! You will not regret it!! Anyone who loves Jane Austen will love Elizabeth Gaskell's works as well!!

Once again, the old familiar theme of a vituous man (Roger) and a very vituous and good young girl (Molly), are obviously meant for each other, but do not discover it till late in the story. There is the incredible light headed selfishness of the step daughter, the gold digging desires of the good Doctor's wife, and the various gossip by all the old biddies of the town. Even the very rich and elite of the village, come to the aid of Miss Molly and in a round about way, help Roger further his career. The Grand Estates of England and their land rich families have their problems too, but the majority of this adventure story is focused on Miss Molly, her goodness, and of how the people in those days chose their life partners. This is the kind of movie that you want to jump inside the scenery and be a part of their lives and help straighten them out! Oh what a heart warming ending this film has.

However until viewing the movie adaptation of WIVES AND DAUGHTERS I did not know she was such a gifted chronicler of the human condition that her stories hold up well today.  This production of one of her novels is beautiful in every detail and well cast and acted.  Michael Gambon is particularly good as the squire though the whole cast is excellent.  The story might be a  bit predictable but it is such a joy to watch one forgets and forgives that.

Although she is the youngest and seemingly most naive character in this story, she is the one entrusted with all the secrets that gradually unfold throughout the story.

Thus, the story is alot of build-up to nothing more than the expected happy ending, with one or two mild tragedies along the way.  However, Michael Gambon as the crotchety Squire Hamly is extremely entertaining, and does an excellent job of conveying the only real acting performance in this entire piece.  His dramatic and moving scene at his son's deathbed is contrasted perfectly with his humorous dialogue throughout, making his the only fully developed character in the movie. My favorite line, the Squire commenting to Dr. Gibson: ""I'm not saying your wife is silly....but one of us was silly, and it wasn't me.""",1173398400,3,706,5.0256410256410255

1406701,5,B000059H6T,"This BBC miniseries is an adaptation of the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell.  She was still writing the book in 1865 when she died unexpectedly at the age of 55.  The last few pages of the story were completed from her notes.
In this miniseries the protagonist, Molly Gibson, is played by Justine Waddell who we also see in The Woman in White, based on the Victorian novel by Wilkie Collins.  Molly was living a pleasant and simply life with her widowed father (Bill Paterson), the area doctor, until he decides to remarry.  The new wife brings her daughter into the marriage and thus begins the heart of the story.

Wives and Daughters is set in the early Victorian period.  Some have criticized this production as slow and stiff but I believe it compares well with the 1996 BBC/A&E version of Pride and Prejudice and surpasses the 1985 BBC version.  Even a good modern book is difficult to adapt to a movie.  Victorian literature, written for a slower period and for people who had the leisure to read, took time to develop plots and characters.  This four episode, 375 minute, miniseries takes that time.  Also, we must remember that this is not a miniseries about the Victorian era, it is a largely faithful adaptation of a Victorian novel.  Elizabeth Gaskell was Victorian and she was writing about Victorians.  These people were more reserved, at least in public, than we are today.

The novel leaves much of the future unresolved.  Today we would say there is ample room for a sequel.  However, the miniseries ends the story in the style of Jane Austen.  Having said that I will conclude with, if you like adaptations of Jane Austen novels you should enjoy Wives and Daughters.

Recommendation: This is an excellent adaptation of Gaskell's novel.  For fans of Victorian literature or movies this is a `must have,' for your collection.

I am forever on the lookout for quality films whose makers do not feel compelled to nurture the sex & violence frenzy in media today, and this one fits the bill.  The storyline is intriguing, surprising, and in the end, satisfying.  With a delightful hint of humor throughout, this narrative is a testament to the realities of both frailty and strength in human relationships.  Intimacy being more than physical, we are re-introduced to the understanding that there are consequences for choices... good, bad, and everything in between.

1406754,4,B000059H6T,This is a genre I and my daughter really admire.  She thought this one was a little too slow moving and overly postured but I liked it alot.  It possesses a certain sweet gentility while aptly expressing the mores and social boundaries of the era.  Not as lavish in scope as Pride & Prejudice nor as entrancing but this will keep you in your seat and enjoying the moments spent there.,1163030400,4,384,4.380281690140845

1406757,5,B000059H6T,"Real men do not use the word ""delightful"". However, here it is unavoidable to accurately portray this film. As good as ""North & South"", in the style of ""Pride & Prejudice"". Less action, as much activity, a relaxing film.

I enjoyed spending time with the characters. I thought Molly was wonderful. A pleasant drama of family, thoughtfulness, some romance, and a couple instances of subtle humor. Pretty scenery and costumes. If you do not like the film, you should pretend you do, and you will be a better person.",1157760000,13,513,4.764044943820225
1406758,2,B000059H6T,"I absolutely love period movies and the effort taken to make this film was extraordinary. As much as I am about to share with you my disappointment with the film-- I did not want it to end. But perhaps therein lies the problem. Maybe I am missing a disc or so (or maybe amazon should make it clear that it is only making available, in the disc set, the first few episodes of the series) but what was provided in this set leaves a plethora of unresolved issues. The major downfall of the series for me was the role and actual acting of the central protaganist, Molly Gibson (played by Justine Waddell). Her character was so unrelentingly judgmental and self righteous that I think it comprised the entire enjoyability of the storyline. Perhaps Ms. Waddell indeed played the part of Molly Gibson artfully but it was without resolution or development. There was no complexity to her character. The last disc leaves you wondering -- so, does it ever come out that Molly is in love with the archeologist? Does he marry her beautiful sister? I love drama and there was a lot of drama present in the series -- however it was like drama without a purpose. The entire cast was all dressed up with no where to go. In sum, very, very disappointing. The very first 45 minutes of the first dvd is unforgivably boring and then after you will be positively glued to the program. Always waiting for resolution of some problem or issue. It rarely comes I tell you and before you know it you will be knogging your brain about the turn out of some new matter.

1406779,5,B000059H6T,"I love Elizabeth Gaskell, a Victorian author that was sadly overshadowed by the likes of the Bronte sisters and Charles Dickens.  She was a talent in her own right and I enjoyed reading her novels.  North and South and Wives and Daughters were her most successful novels and two of my favorites of all time, which is why I had to watch the BBC adaptations of the same.  The adaptation of Wives and Daughters is beautifully done -- it kept (almost) true to the novel and I enjoyed all four episodes.  The fact that the adaptation was written and produced by the same creators of the A&E/BBC Pride and Prejudice makes things all the better.  Molly Gibson lives a content life with her father, a respectable doctor, in the countryside.  But things change when, after spending many years alone as a widower, Mr. Gibson decides to remarry.  Molly's new mother, Claire, is a governess Molly had met briefly when she was a little girl.  The woman is self-absorbed, pompous, selfish and has airs of grandeur.  When Claire's daughter, Cynthia Kirkpatrick, moves in with them, Molly likes to have a new sister and they get along well, but when Roger Hamley, her friend and love of her life, falls for the flirtatious, attention-getter, much prettier Cynthia, Molly is heartbroken.

This wonderful series set in the late Regency/pre-Victorian era is full of Gaskell's mixture of romance and poignancy.  The subplot centered on the Hamley family was my favorite in the book and it is my favorite here.  This is the storyline with the most poignancy, and some scenes moved me to the core.  The central story is of course wonderful and the actors brought the characters to life in more ways than one.  At first, I thought Justine Waddell's portrayal of Molly Gibson was kind of bland, but later I realized that simplicity was the best bet here, especially in the scenes with her stepmother and stepsister.  Bill Patterson as Mr. Gibson was great, but I enjoyed Michael Gambon as Squire Hamley (such a talented actor) and Tom Hollander as Osborne Hamley the most.  Keeley Hawes is quite good as Cynthia and she is very pretty.  Her face looks familiar, but I cannot remember where I'd seen her before, if it was in a movie or on television.  As for the production, I love the wardrobe, it captured the somewhat extravagant and elaborate fashions and hairstyles of the early 1830s.  I also loved the sets and the backdrop of the English countryside.  The cinematography isn't as impressive as the one in North and South, but some of the locations reminded me of Pride and Prejudice and that was a great treat for me.  I enjoyed this adaptation.  As for the DVD, I enjoyed the third disk containing the special features.  You appreciate a production like this all the more when you watch behind the scenes footage and learn more about the actors.  There is also some information about Elizabeth Gaskell that I found very insightful.  The one disappointing thing is that the actual series is viewed in full screen instead of wide screen.  That almost ruined the pleasure of watching this program.  Anyway, the Wives and Daughters mini-series has become one of my favorites.  This is one DVD box set that I will watch again and again!",1154995200,11,3215,4.744144144144144
1406780,5,B000059H6T,"As he showed with his masterful handling of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, Andrew Davies can take a long character novel and make it fascinating, even if five hours long. The acting is superb. Justine Waddell as Molly is very pretty in a quiet way, but outshone (as she should by) by Keeley Hawes as the charming and fascinating Cynthia. Keeley Hawes manages to capture Cynthia's character. She is full of pretty ways, and so honest, that we like her in spite of ourselves. Tom Hollander is excellent as the slightly weak Osborne, and so is Michael Gambon as his father. This is the most Austen-like of Gaskell's books in style, and somewhat resembles Mansfield Park in plot. But what makes Gaskell special is her characters, all varied, and never cariacatured.

1406782,5,B000059H6T,"This is a superlative period piece and a brilliant adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's 1865 novel of the same name. This BBC mini-series is a superb costume drama with stellar performances by the entire cast. Set in rural England, the film centers around Molly Gibson, the seventeen year old daughter of a country doctor. Richly drawn portraits of Molly's neighbors and friends quickly emerge and weave an absorbing tapestry of nineteenth century life.

Molly and her father, a widower for most of Molly's life, have an exceptionally close and loving relationship. Their relationship is put to the test when he decides to marry a widow and former governess, Hyacinth, who is a pretentious, self absorbed, ridiculous woman. She has a grown daughter named Cynthia, a beautiful young woman, close to Molly in age, but as different from Molly as night and day. Cynthia is best described as a Marilyn Monroe of the Victorian age. Cynthia and Molly become fast friends, while Molly barely tolerates her nigh intolerable step-mother.

The series really revolves around Molly's relationships with all the characters in the production and her handling of the various everyday situations in which she finds herself. Richly drawn, memorable characters, as well as intrigues, secrets, and romance, make this a highly absorbing drama and one that those who love period pieces and lush, well acted costume dramas will enjoy. It is simply a masterpiece.

With stunningly crisp visuals and beautiful clarity of sound, the production value of this three disc, five hour DVD is simply first rate. It is also value laden with some very interesting features. There is an engaging fifty five minute portrait of Elizabeth Gaskell, the author of the novel upon which this mini-series is based. There is a also a twenty minute documentary on the making of the film which is entertaining, as it gives a bird's eye view of the thought that went into the making of the film and the development of the characters. There is also a who's who guide to the performers. This DVD is well worth having in one's collection.",1147910400,6,2085,5.002881844380403

The BBC period pieces, North & South (also based on Gaskill) and Pride and Predjudice are VERY good, however, and are worth every penny.",1142899200,19,575,4.757575757575758

1406804,1,B000059H6T,"Don't believe half of what you've read about this production. I purchased a copy after reading a number of reviews, and completely wasted my money. However, in the interest of fairness, I've divided my review into different sections:

First, The Good...

Michael Gambon, Michael Gambon, Michael Gambon!! What a marvelous actor! I found myself perking up whenever his Squire Hamley popped onto the screen. This character could easily have been depicted as an overly traditional blowhard, but Michael managed to develop a fully three-dimensional human being, complete with winning charm and frustrating quirks. And his portrayals of the deep personal losses suffered by the squire during the course of the story (don't worry, I won't spoil the surprise!) were absolutely wrenching.

This is the first time I've had the pleasure of watching Keeley Hawes onscreen, and I thought her portrayal of Cynthia was quite good. I've read wonderful things about her past performances, and she certainly lives up to the praise. She somehow manages to make you feel sympathetic toward a character who, basically, is a shallow, self-centered moneygrubber. I could easily believe that Cynthia could charm anyone into doing anything she wished, because she was just so darned likeable even when she was at her most manipulative.

Now for The Bad...

I'm sorry to say that I found all of the other actors - particularly the lead, Justine Waddell, and her love interest, Anthony Howell - to be as emotive as cardboard cutouts. Now, I haven't seen these folks in any other productions, so I'm basing my review solely on this miniseries. I'm sure they gave their all, considering the limitations placed upon them by the monumentally boring storyline. Sadly, they weren't able to transcend this ball and chain to show the little ""sparks"" evident in Michael or Keeley's performances. There were a couple of moments towards the end when I felt that Anthony might be settling into the role, as he appeared much more natural and relaxed than he had earlier, but I still found it hard to care about him. But Justine's Molly was just spoiled, righteous, and dull, dull, dull.

And then there's The Ugly...

I had such high hopes for this movie, as I ADORED Elizabeth Gaskell's ""North and South"" and the fine writing displayed by Andrew Davies in the BBC production of ""Pride and Prejudice"". But the pacing in this miniseries - oy, vey! Plod, plod, plod... When it comes to movies based on literature, I'm usually a purist in terms of translating as much of the original work as possible into the production... but there's something to be said for a little judicious editing now and then. After a while, watching ""Wives and Daughters"" became like a train wreck... I just couldn't tear my eyes away from the carnage.

The Final Word...

The minute this series ended, I threw it in the trash. Even the marvelous Michael Gambon couldn't save it from its fate. For a quality example of a period drama, watch Gaskell's ""North and South"", which effectively depicts the tensions between the working class and business owners during the rise of the unions in the late Victorian era. Or try the version of  ""Sense and Sensibility"" that was released in the mid-90's. I know most of us BBC-er's aren't too fond of the more ""commercial"" productions, but ""S&S"" was quite good for all of that. It doesn't carry the weight of the social commentary evident in ""N&S"", but it's still highly entertaining, and the screenwriting (done by Emma Thompson) was particularly well-crafted.",1141257600,44,3533,4.962774957698816

To appease her, I ordered it from Amazon; after all, Andrew Davis wrote the script and everyone knows what a genius he is.  FINALLY, I watched the entire DVD in two days, and that includes the extras.

No expense was spared in creating this film.  The costumes, the estates, the village, the scenery were all exquisite.  The actors were absolutely incredible.  Justine Waddell IS Molly Gibson.  She portrayed a sweetness, innocence and intelligence that will forever tie her to this role.  In addition, she is just lovely. She was so believable that every time her eyes filled with tears, I found mine doing the same thing! The entire cast was wonderful and made me feel as if I was watching the story happen in real life rather than a movie.

This film touched my heart (and my tear ducts).  I never thought anything could come close to my beloved PRIDE and PREJUDICE (the one with Colin Firth) but WIVES and DAUGHTERS proved me wrong; it also owns my heart.

Jusitne Waddel (Molly) and Bill Patterson (dr Gibson)play daughter and father very convincingly: you can feel their down-to-earth, but strong and heart-warming affection for each other. Nothing superficial or pretentious. Francesca Annis (Clare Gibson) and Keely Hawes (her daughter, Cynthia) are perfectly suited as mother and daughter: you can grasp the physical and characteristic similarities. One of the most annoying and at the same time most delightful scenes is when Mr Gibson gives a piece of her mind to Cynthia for putting Molly's good reputation at stake and both Cynthia and Mrs Gibson are crying, feeling they've been sadly abused & misunderstood while Molly - the only person having ground to feel injured - is standing there patiently, not saying a word. Their carelessness and selfishness is featured wonderfully in that scene.

Justine Waddel was a fresh and lively Molly. Keely Hawes was a wondeful Cynthia: you couldn't help liking and disliking her at the same time. Iain Glen's acting was also very good: he was good-looking, but repulsive at the same time. Francesca Annis and Michael Gambon were both superb.

Supporting actors were very well chosen: I especially liked the beautiful Rosamund Pike as aristocratic, independent Lady Harriet.

1406842,3,B000059H6T,"Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love period films and classic British literature, so I really wanted to fall in love with this movie.  Based on the other reviews and the fact that I had recently finished the marvelous book version by Elizabeth Gaskell, I had very high expectations.  Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed.  Let me explain why...

1.  There was not nearly enough time spent on proper plot and character develop.  Consider the fact that the film version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" is slightly longer than ""Wives and Daughters"", but Jane Austen's book isn't even half the length of Elizabeth Gaskell's.  The movie is like a fast gallop.  I prefer beautiful strolls.  I was especially dismayed at how little time was spent developing Molly's initial relationships with the Hamley's.  In the book, her first visit lasted for months, but the film breezes through it in about 15 minutes.  In order to do the book justice, the movie should have been several hours longer.

2.  Although Justine Waddell's portrayal of Molly is perfect, some of the other characters just don't match the descriptions in the book.  In the movie Osborne was shorter and far less handsome than expected, while Roger was too handsome.  Cynthia was not as fair and stunning as she should have been.  I had to work hard to convince myself that so many men would fall for her rather than Molly.

3.  The conclusion didn't seem realistic in my mind.  Gaskell died before she finished the book, so we'll never know what she intended, but I don't think Molly would have went to Africa with Roger (Mr. Gibson probably wouldn't have allowed it since she had recently recovered from an illness).  I think Roger would have went to Africa to complete his final 6 month obligation and came back and professed his undying love in a very romantic conclusion.  Of course there would have been intrigues during the 6 months that would keep us in suspense.

If you haven't read the book, you will probably love the movie...because it is very good...it's just not as great as the book.  I highly recommend the book!",1119916800,15,2099,4.753462603878116
1406843,5,B000059H6T,"I never thought to watch a BBC production that was better than P&P, but this is it.  Andrew Davies is hitting on all cylinders here once again and the cast is uniformly fantastic, but it is Justine Waddell that puts it over the top.  P&P is funnier and cleverer and slightly more polished, but W&D is richer and deeper.  A lot of this is due to Gaskell v. Austen, of course.  Waddell as Molly is so perfect a fit that a viewer is often left breathless at the sympathy created by the character and by the actress.  Waddell is such a mixture of ethereal beauty and homespun Scottish girl in this role that it is almost impossible not to fall in love with her.  She is so charming that it is quite possible to forget that her sister is supposed to be the greater beauty (although the directors somehow convince us of this at the proper times and in the proper ways).  The character of Molly's stepmother is also acted with astonishing precision and imagination.  The role is brought to life in many ways that exceed the book, which is the highest praise an actress can achieve, I think.  Squire Hamley is another stand-out performance, although no one is weak here.  If I could give six-stars, I would.

I couldn't wait for these two gentlemen to return to the screen. They, to me, along with Justine Waddell's amazing performance as Molly, were the anchors of the film.

1406848,5,B000059H6T,"Drama, suspense, romance, fortunes, secrets, lies, good vs. evil, the list goes on and on. There's nothing more engaging than this edge-of-your seat Wives and Daughters. It was an immediate success the first time I saw it, the plot was creative, and the setting was superb. One never has to look so far as to see the definition and make-up of fantastic story-telling, it was all there, and it was simple yet delightful.

The climax was mainly centered around little Molly Gibson, a spirited yet heart-felt young woman who is a virtual ""out for herself"" kind of girl, whose world was suddenly turned upside down as her intimate father-daughter relationship was barred with newcomer and step-mother, Hyacinth; a self-absorbed, and outlandish lady whose daughter shared similar coherent characteristics. Being a two-sided engagement, Molly soon convened and speculated the hearts of everyone she meets. Those of which includes the Hamelys, a well respected but inarticulate

family and the Brownings, sisters that deserved well to ""keep themselves quiet.""

And the plot moves on, a little slowly at first but gradually picks up its pace, the timing was perfect and a perfect adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's original novel. If there was one series worth seeing, Wives and Daughters is on the top of the moutain.",1106611200,5,1309,5.165094339622642

It's more like what I'd call a foldout case.  There is no ""box"" around it to hold the flaps of the folder together.  The three DVDs are really hard to remove from the clear hard plastic that holds them into the inner side of each of the three panels of the foldout holder.  The discs are not in the nice keep cases that I thought they would be in.  I imagined the box set would be like my ""Pride and Prejudice"" special edition box set, but it is definitely sub par.  Aside from this physical problem, I absolutely love my ""Wives and Daughters"" DVD.  The dialouge is not a witty as what Jane Austen wrote, but it has it's own charm and is a wonderful story with superb acting.

If there was a super bowl of 19th century English literature brought to the screen, these two would be in it. Great job! Another note- the gentleman who plays the Saxon lord, Roger's father, is a tremendous actor. Don't miss his fabulous performance. In general, a terrific, talented cast.",1104796800,5,547,4.48

It's a bit more quiet in it's plotting than the former, but I think it should stand on it's own merits and storyline(which I will spare you of a synopsis at this point). Let's just say it's very endearing to watch the two less splashy siblings(Justine Waddell's Molly and Anthony Howell's Roger) of the greatly admired Cynthia and Osbourne blossom in their own way through the series. And of course, it's obvious they are meant for one another from the start-but with five hours to fill up, of course they are given distractions, obstacles, meddlings, and long absences from eacthother before they can finally take a moment to realize how perfect they are for eachother!

Look at it carefully, and you will notice that this is essentially a story about women. The love story that comes with it plays second fiddle. Young people will do well to learn a thing or two from Molly Gibson, and from the other ladies as well. Overall, a winner that can never pale to BBC's other production, ""Pride and Prejudice.""
  Michael Gambon (the new Hogwarts headmaster) is a pleasure to watch. During a deathbed scene, you can see him drool in grief and understand why he garnered a Best Actor Award from BAFTA. Justine Waddell is perfect and beautiful for the leading role of virtuous Molly. Keeley Hawes (whom you can also see in BBC's nice rendition of Dickens' ""Our Mutual Friend"") is also good as the tortured stepsister that must escape from her past when it came looking for her. Francesca Annis is simply superb. Penelope Wilton (of ""Calendar Girls"") has a short role as Mrs. Hamley whose character departed all too early.
  Some of the sceneries of the English countryside are quite breath-taking; makes one want to take a hike through the forests. This production is never poor in color. And, who can let that original music by John Keane pass by??!! One of the things I love about this DVD is that it has a special 30-minute section devoted just for Mr. Keanes music. It is very good, no kidding.
  I understand that this was originally an unfinished (almost-finished) novel by Mrs. Elizabeth Gaskell. It is odd, but I get the feeling that Mrs. Gaskell mirrored herself with Mrs. Hamleys character. Anyway, BBC did an excellent job in capping up the story for her. Bravo all around!!! Two thumbs and two big toes up!!!
  Aug. 18, 2005: also I highly recommend BBC's production of E. Gaskell's ""North and South."" This is one production that's not to be missed.

1406897,5,B000059H6T,"I wasn't aware that Elizabeth Gaskell, who wrote ""Wives and Daughters,"" was one of the giants of nineteenth century English literature, but this adaptation of her book is simply wonderful!
Molly, the no-nonsense daughter of a widowed village doctor, is forced to cede the running of their household to her new stepmother, who is not quite as evil as Cinderella's but is a lot more supercilious.  The stepmother's daughter, Cynthia, is another addition to the household, and Molly becomes her steadfast friend, even though Cynthia puts Molly in difficult situations and admits that she has never loved anyone in her entire life, including her mother.  Everywhere, men fall swooning before the beautiful Cynthia, and Molly watches with alarm as Cynthia charms Roger, the second son of Squire Hamley, with whom she is infatuated. Complexities arise as ... well, watch the film.
What makes this film so enticing is the fine screenplay by Andrew Davies and the absolutely splendid acting by the entire company.  You will enjoy detesting Francesca Annis (so memorable in ""Lillie Langtry"") as the stepmother who raises gold-digging to new heights, carefully evaluating each of Cynthia's suitors on the sole criterion of his ability to enhance her status and her bank balance.  Michael Gambon (""The Singing Detective""), skillfully portrays the hot-headed squire, whose bark (worse than his bite) has tragic consequences.  And Molly is played to perfection by Justine Waddell, who, while portraying the placid exterior of a country doctor's genteel daughter, can reveal her emotional interior with the merest twitch of an eyebrow.  Ian Carmichael (""Lord Peter Wimsey"") is sparingly used, but is, as always, enchanting.  Supporting characters are played with consummate artistry, and the costumes and settings will dazzle you in an England in which, remarkably, it does not rain until the last scenes.
This production has characters that are not depicted as stereotypes - as in life, the leading roles occasionally falter and make bad judgments, and the flawed characters have their good points.  This film will scoop you up and deliver you right into the middle of a world that looks and sounds different from ours, but that feels very, very familiar.  ""Wives and Daughters"" is a winner!",1082592000,5,2278,5.236263736263736

1406932,5,B000059H6T,"My aunt rented Wives and Daughter for me as a thank you for my loaning her movies from my private collection.  When I first saw the title, I thought it was from a novel by D. H. Lawrence or Jane Austen.  I was wrong of course, for it is from a neglected English novelist named Elizabeth Gaskell. Wives and Daighters is now one of my favorite BBC productions.
Wives and Daughters is set in the fictional town of Hollingford in England.  The story centers on a young girl named Molly Gibson and the people, good and bad, selfish and unselfish, shallow and deep, bigoted and tolerate, worldly and innocent, peers and the working class,and principaled and gossipy who come into her life.  At the beginning of the story,  Molly is being raised by her widowed father, Dr. Gibson, a caring and vigilant man.  When he decides to remarry when Molly is a teenager, sparks fly.  Molly has to cope with a stepmother and
step sister, Cynthia.  Cynthia was educated in France, where the only thing she seems to have picked up is fashion and flirtation.  She flirts, but she doesn't seem to realize her affect on men. Molly who is pretty, but not seductively buxom and glowing like Cynthia.  She is loyal to her troubled step sister.  She is silent and long suffering even when the young man she loves, Roger Hamley falls for Cynthia.
Eventually all works out for good. Wives and Daughters draws an excellent picture of country life and manners in Victorian England.  It is a coming of age tale with a cast of memorable charcters.  Their conversations define them.
I loved the warm smile of Roger Hamley the budding young scientist whom Molly loves, played by Tom Hollander.  His character's heart  is just as warm.  I have been a fan of Francesca Annis since I first saw her in the Masterpiece Theater production of Lillie back in the late 70s, when I was in high school.  As Molly's stepmother she is shallow, pretentious, but still almost as beautiful as she was over 25 years ago.
I fell in love with Wives and Daughters so much that I had to get my own copy of the series on DVD.  The photography and costumes are beautiful.  Wives and Daughters is a winner!",1081900800,2,2148,4.546875

Not just a fancy dress that flirts with every guy she meets in order for all of them to chase her around, but finding the simple things in life, that in reality, truly ARE the most beautiful.

Gaskell's most atypical (and most Austenian) novel is given the full treatment, leaving in all the sweethearted romance and yet retaining some of the slightly disturbing Freudian underlay of the original novel. Justine Waddell is marvelous as Molly, the spirited heroine who adores her father and is disheartened when, for the sake of actually making his daughter happier, her doctor-father marries a well-meaning but pushing arriviste wife, played to splendid perfection by Francesca Annis. True to the character of Hyacinth in Gaskell's novel, Annis's Hyacinth steals the show: while you can't help but be as mortified by her meddling and selfishness as is Molly, you still can't bring yourself to despise her given Hyacinth's enormous capacity to suffer (Annis is especially moving in the proposal scene in the show's beginning hour).

Sadly, BBC and Warners don't feel the American public is ready or deserving of such an innovation. Instead we are being sold a horrible reduction that has been crudely cropped at the edges. Instead of a lovely anamorphic widescreen picture it is a grainy, pixillated, slightly matted full frame (about 4.5:3). This wouldn't matter so much if the director and cinematographer hadn't clearly lavished so much care on composing their scenes to fit the widescreen format. The consequence is that in many shots the characters have half their faces missing and often appear to be talking to empty space. If you don't find this sort of thing a distraction, then I strongly reccommend this series - lavish production values, beautifully acted and the usual witty script with a contemporary (but not anachronisitic) feel from Andrew Davies (Pride and Prejudice, House of Cards etc etc).

The story is engaging, if a little long-winded for the essentially simple tale it has to tell, and the characters are all three-dimensional, finely-drawn people, not the costume drama stock characters that are often found in lesser productions.  The screenplay is well done, as is the music (by the same composer as the Horation Hornblower series, and often reminiscent of that music).  Above all, however, the cast are a joy to watch.  The older cast--Michael Gambon, Francesca Annis, Ian Carmichael, Barbara Flynn, and especially Bill Paterson--are excellent, and it is testament to the talent of the younger group that they consistently draw our attention to themselves.  Justine Wadell turns in another flawless performance, and carries the weight of the whole production in the central role of Molly Gibson.  Keeley Hawes is unexpectedly great as a flake with some deeper problems.  Anthony Howell is charismatic as Roger Hamley, and Tom Hollander is especially good as Osborne (you can also see him in a great little part in Gosford Park).

1406986,5,B000059H6T,"This is a superlative period piece and a brilliant adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's 1865 novel of the same name. This BBC mini-series is a superb costume drama with stellar performances by the entire cast. Set in rural England, the film centers around Molly Gibson, the seventeen year old daughter of a country doctor. Richly drawn portraits of Molly's neighbors and friends quickly emerge and weave an absorbing tapestry of nineteenth century life.

Molly and her father, a widower for most of Molly's life, have an exceptionally close and loving relationship. Their relationship is put to the test when he decides to marry a widow and former governess, Hyacinth, who is a pretentious, self absorbed, ridiculous woman. She has a grown daughter named Cynthia, a beautiful young woman, close to Molly in age, but as different from Molly as night and day. Cynthia is best described as a Marilyn Monroe of the Victorian age. Cynthia and Molly become fast friends, while Molly barely tolerates her nigh intolerable step-mother.

The series really revolves around Molly's relationships with all the characters in the production and her handling of the various everyday situations in which she finds herself. Richly drawn, memorable characters, as well as intrigues, secrets, and romance, make this a highly absorbing drama and one that those who love period pieces and lush, well acted costume dramas will enjoy. It is simply a masterpiece.

With stunningly crisp visuals and beautiful clarity of sound, the production value of this three disc, five hour DVD is simply first rate. It is also value laden with some very interesting features. There is an engaging fifty five minute portrait of Elizabeth Gaskell, the author of the novel upon which this mini-series is based. There is a also a twenty minute documentary on the making of the film which is entertaining, as it gives a bird's eye view of the thought that went into the making of the film and the development of the characters.

""Wives and Daughters"" shows us the world of women in a rural 19th century setting. Molly is the happy, though motherless, daughter of the village doctor, and she and he enjoy an idyllic family life, toasting cheese by the fireside when he returns home late from his calls. However, sometimes we try to fix what ain't broke. Thus the father determines that his girl ought to have a mother again, and so he marries a widowed governess with a half-grown daughter of her own away at school. Hyacinth, the governess cum stepmother, is a vain selfish woman who is behaving in a haughty fashion now that she finally has a home of her own and a better social standing than that of a hated governess. Molly tries to make the best of a very trying circumstance. Relief comes in the form of her new stepsister Cynthia, who is bubbly and flirtatious. The two girls pledge friendship and have a genuine affection for each other. The problem though--and it's a big one--is that the local squire's second son, the one with whom Molly is smitten, is quite bowled over by the beauty of Cynthia, and Molly recedes into the ""just friends"" category. Like a Jane Austen novel, seems like a hopeless business, no? Ah, but the same magic will be at work here, to demonstrate how hopeless situations can be resolved to just about everyone's satisfaction.
The acting and scenery are first rate, and although I believed there would be a happy ending, I was darned if I could figure out how they were going to get there. In the tradition of Austen and Charlotte Bronte, Elizabeth Gaskell weaves a splendid tale of a long-suffering heroine who is finally vindicated in every way. If you've ever been a wife or a daughter (or have known one or the other), I think you'll be very happy with this piece.",1005955200,7,2026,4.6305555555555555

1406991,4,B000059H6T,"This fantastic miniseries is a slow start, but wraps you up in the facinating lives of Molly Gibson and her father, Dr. Gibson.

Young Molly is very innocent and kind hearted, with a fierce love for her father. Her mother died when she was only a child, which brought her closer to her beloved father. A heartwarming moment is when Molly and Dr. Gibson are sitting in front of the fireplace eating melted cheese on toast, and the simplicity of being together eating their favorite foods is wonderful.

Dr. Gibson decides he must get married, as Molly ""needs"" a mother. He chooses one of the silliest ladies I have ever seen: Mrs. Kirkpatrick-Claire/Hyacinth. She is self-absorbed and a very bad mother, but she sometimes has good moments. However, Hyacinth has a daughter Molly's age who is returning from school in France, her name is Cynthia and she is VERY beautiful, high-spirited and foolish.

Watching this story unfold is a delightful experience. I cannot express the utter joy I get while watching this fabulous mini-series. Though it deviates from the book a bit, it doesn't detract from the story.

1407008,5,B000059H6T,"I put off seeing the adaptation of WIVES AND DAUGHTERS on tv and buying the DVD because I figured it was a feeble attempt by the BBC to cash in on the popularity of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Literary critics do not consider Mrs. Gaskell's writing to be as accomplished as Jane Austen's. Gaskell wrote ""best sellers"" during her day (19th Century approximately 50 years after Austen), but unlike her counterparts of the 19th Century - Austen, the Bronte Sisters, and George Eliot, Gaskell's books did not stand the test of time. It is a credit to Andrew Davies that he has been able to take the wide range of material he has and transform it into perfection. The BBC adaptation of WIVES AND DAUGHTERS IS PERFECTION. First, the DVD itself is clear and beautifully articulated. The sound and color are precise. This is a first class work of art comparable to adaptations of classics such as JEWEL IN THE CROWN and ROOM WITH A VIEW. Second, the lush settings, costumes, and other aspects of scenery and background are extremely realistic and accurate. This is not a tinsel-town sound stage rip-off, this is the real thing. WIVES is comparable to the Merchant-Ivory films. Third, the actors are superb. There isn't a dud in the bunch. As a BBC junkie, I am familiar with most of the actors, and was bowled over by the star power. The casting of Ian Carmichael (Lord Peter Wimsey) and Barbara Leigh-Hunt (Darby's Aunt in 'Pride and Prejudice') as Lord and Lady Cunmore is a fine example of the thought that went into choosing who should play whom. Francesca Annis is fabulous as Molly's very proper new step-mother. The Browning sisters are marvelous (Mystery fans will recognize both of them). And, last but not least, Justine Waddell is a great actress whom I must liken to the young Wendy Hiller. Waddell has one of the most expressive faces around and she plays it well. This young woman is destined to be a Dame of the British Empire. WIVES - as adapted by Davies - is tight, coherent, and flows logically (unlike Mrs. Gaskell's book). Characters behave in predictable but interesting ways. There are no ""bad guys"" or ""good guys"" everyone is very human. Even the wonderful Molly is not perfect and I for one would find her unbelievable if she were. Neither Molly's stepmother Hyacinth, nor her stepsister Cynthia are ""bad"" -- they are beautiful, charming, and self obsessed. Mrs Gaskell was clear and Davies keeps this bit in ... poverty does not make people nice. Molly is a better person because she has always had a loving father on hand to admonish her when she misbehaved whereas Cynthia was forced to fend for herself as her mother tended other people's children. Cynthia has learned some not so gentle survival techniques. I love this story because the people and the events depicted in it are based on real events. Molly is a fictional character but many of the episodes about her life are drawn from Mrs. Gaskell's own experiences and knowledge of other's lives. And, although she may not have used her as a role model, there was a young woman named Eleanor Omerod who became one of Britain's leading agricultural entemologists during the time when WIVES takes place. Eleanor began studing insects casually in 1852 when she observed an unusual locust which she wrote about in her diary. Later, she discovered a rare beetle on her father's estate in Gloucestershire which brought her to the attention of Professor C.G.B. Daubeny at Oxford. Thus she began a life long interest and career in a field few women entered. As a member of the Royal Botanical Society, Omerod was responsible for placing entemologists in Kenya and elsewhere. Fans of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE will enjoy this DVD, but it is not like Jane Austin's tales. Mrs Gaskell was not an accomplished ironist. Much of the tongue-in-cheek humor found in Austin's books is missing. However, Austen made fun of those she deemed pretentious to an excess and as a result, some of her characters are almost two-dimensional. Mrs. Gaskell's characters are developed, even those who might fall into the category of ""pretension"" in an Austin book. Mrs. Gaskell was concerned with the plight of ""fallen"" women and their redemption by nonjugmental folks. To Davies credit, this angle of the story has been preserved.",998784000,62,4263,4.81718963165075

1407011,4,B000059H6T,"I bought this dvd based solely on the rave amazon reviews.  For the most part, I was not disappointed.  Made by the same winning team who brought us 1995's Pride and Prejudice, the temptation to compare the two series was too great to resist...And that is where I think I went wrong.  While there was definitely a familiar ""feel"" to this mini-series in that the costumes and dialogue were fairly reminiscent of P&P, the story was completely different--not that that's a bad thing.  However, at the end of the day, I simply felt the Wives & Daughers storyline was less riveting and, ultimately, less interesting, than P&P.  Of course, the fact that I consider P&P to be the best movie/mini-series of all time may have unfairly prejudiced me against Wives and Daughters, but I started out with very good intentions.  I really did want to love this movie as much as I love P&P!
The story centers around Molly Gibson, a young lady whose widower father decides to remarry when Molly is 17 so that she will have a mother.  Unfortunatley, his choice of bride is a rather silly woman for whom one feels as much sympathy as Mrs. Bennet of P&P.  The stepmother has a daughter who, like her mother, is incredibly self-absorbed, but, unlike her mother, also at least TRIES to be a good person.  The two stepsisters, although completely different, actually care very much for each other, and this was nice to watch.  Of course, there's a male romantic interest, but he spends so much time off-camera that I didn't develop any particular attachment to him.  Accordingly, when he comes back after a long absence pining after Molly (after first pining for someone else because she's prettier), I felt very little compassion for him.  All in all, the story really is about Molly and how she handles the various situations in her life.  She's the only person you really care about (well, she and Osborne Hamley, but only because his life is so tragic).  And although that's nice, I don't think it warranted five hours.  For five hours, I was hoping to develop more attachment to more characters.  I was hoping that it would center more around the interactions and dynamics between various characters, rather than simply be ""the world of Molly Gibson.""
In sum, it is fine entertainment, and something I enjoyed watching, but it is no P&P.  I think if I hadn't read all these comparisons between the two series, I would've enjoyed Wives & Daughters more.  As it is, though, I found it enjoyable, but not amazing. That said, I did find it compelling enough to watch all five hours in one sitting...So while I definitely recommend watching this, I recommend even more that you resist the temptation to compare this to P&P.  This will save inevitable disappointment if you, like me, loved P&P and are looking for another period piece to love just as much.",997574400,21,2832,4.719512195121951
1407012,4,B000059H6T,"An acclaimed award-winning British miniseries comes to America at last in this intriguing and heartfelt story of romance, mischief, and heartbreak. The tale begins with Molly Gibson, the only child of a well-known and beloved country doctor, whose mother died when she was very young. Spirited and often outspoken, Molly is a vastly different person of society than you might anticipate. With a passionate love for her father, and an undying fascination with bugs, her happy, glittering little world soon comes tumbling down when her father announces his engagement to Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Soon her life has changed dramatically with the introduction of two fascinating young men, a past full of scandal and secrets... and a stepsister that is a glittering social butterfly to her quiet and demur solitude.
The mini-series is excellently filmed and timed, from the writers and producers of Pride & Prejudice. The costuming is absolutely breathtaking, the characters well-portrayed and deep, and it stays faithful to the original adaptation right down to the dialogue. Its only flaw, if any, is that the first hour rather lags, but picks up more swiftly as the plot moves into the second part. In true form, the BBC gives us a glittering array of gowns, horses, sprawling estates, and fashionable arrangements; as well as with a host of humorous side trails and dialogue. It's serious and yet comical; reaching into both areas with great success.
They've packed this release with plenty of ""goodies,"" from a long biography/documentary on the author to interviews with the cast and crew. I found that the featurette was somewhat well done but that the opinions of the actors differed from their characters. Their regards to Cynthia and her mother were more sexual appeal, while I found the film very clean and without any suggestive material. Perhaps I was reading it wrong, or perhaps they overlooked the film's own high points, but in all, a very nice DVD release.",997315200,10,1961,5.093167701863354

Everything about this movie, from it's music to its cinematography to its acting and plot twists suggest a terribly dignified but unsophisticated fun fun fun romp through emotions and who we as humans are and how ridiculous we can be sometimes.

I was looking for something Austenish, and very happily stumbled across this.  It isn't really much like Austen, other than that Austen and Gaskell both wrote in the 19th century.  Each woman had her own voice, and their stories are different, but equally satisfying. This production is visually beautiful and the acting is superb.  The first time I watched it, nothing much seemed to be happening, until it was over. Life is like that I suppose; it happens while you're looking somewhere else.  I can not praise this enough. It is just beautiful, and resonates on many levels.  The producer and screenwriter are the ones who gave us the delicious Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.  The humor in this story is more subtle and sometimes unexpected, so it hits you harder.  Gaskell's people are more human and more lovable than Austen's, who are more like sketches and caricatures.  These seem more like real people.  I love this more each time I see it.  Much as I adore Austen, I would have worried about what she thought of me.

1407017,5,B000059H6T,"Simply glorious adaptation of the Mrs Gaskell's unfinished Novel - and although the story has been finished for us by Andrew Davies (who adapted Pride and Prejudice for the Screen) I didn't feel he did anything more than tie up one loose end - that of Molly - the rest of the story was left relatively untouched.
This is the story of poor motherless Molly and her devoted father. He decides to remarry and the choice of wife does not prove to be wise for his new wife (and step-daughter) bring with them varying degrees of selfishness and vanity. Mrs Gaskell has imbued Molly's step-mother (Played perfectly by Francesca Annis) with a character who has a sense of superiority, complete selfishness  and an utter blindness to her own faults. Her daugther has a self-confidence and self-indulgence that makes her both adored by all and almost machiavellian in achieving her own ends.
In the background are Molly's old friends, the Squire, his wife and the Squire's two sons - one of whom she loves the other of whom she wishes and tries to help. Unfortunately her step-mother has designs for her natural daughter and the Squire's heir, and Molly's true love only seems to have eyes for her step sister.
The actors have been well chosen for their parts - Molly is played very well by Justine Waddell, but the absolute stand out has to be Francesca Annis as her step-mother.
I loved this book and this adaptation was not a disappointment. The story is lively, the machinations to find true love amusing and the filming is wonderful. It really evokes (to me anyway) England of the 1820's and 30's with glorious settings, beautiful gardens, immaculate costuming and make-up.
