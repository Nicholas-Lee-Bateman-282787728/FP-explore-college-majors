8486208,4,B005THVWJW,"I watched this DVD of the performance of Stravinsky's opera and, later, shared it with some friends.  We agreed that it is a very good production.  For people interested in: chamber opera, the story, the paintings, or how Stavinsky came to compose this score, this is the ticket!",1436918400,,279,4.791666666666667
8486209,3,B005THVWJW,"I loathed the stilted libretto (good grief, how many silly couplets can a human being produce?), the idiotic settings, and the very premise for its existence.  BUT: I loved the singing!  In fact bought it because of Topi Lehtipuu, whom I had just seen in ""Dialogues of the Carmelites"":  eye candy with a voice to match. Sorry to say, there are much better contemporary operas. I am not likely to play it again, I find it distinctly un/musical. I will follow Topi.  He is got a magnificent voice. I give it 2.5 stars.",1431388800,,516,4.516129032258065
8486210,3,B005THVWJW,"I fell in love with the Rake with Stravinsky's own recording made in the early fifties.  Like any long-term term relationship of more than half a century, it is subject to change.  Now I see certain aspects of the work that are less than satisfying. Of course the libretto is wonderfully poetic but this means that it reads better than it sounds.  The often convoluted sentences are not always easyly understood when sung, especially when the singers have accents which work against the natural pronunciation of the English language.  Add to that Stravinsky's pingpong ball melodic lines and frequent misplaced accents and we have a recipe for misunderstanding in a piece whose humorous aspects are paramount to enjoying the work.
This new recording from Glyndebourne revisits the older production from the 70's.  In my view, however, it offers no advantage over the earlier release.  There is an indefinable quality about a performer which might be termed ""presence.""  The singer ""becomes"" the character through musicality and body language. In this production only the rake himself has those qualities even though his light voice does not always cut through the composer's often abrasive orchestral textures...in a way Igor's particular sound.  This Tom is very attractive and one forgives small shortcomings. But the rest of the cast is not up to his level ranging from the wooden Shadow to the truly awful Baba theTurk.  So hang on to the earlier Glyndebourne offering or, if you don't have it, get it in preference to this more recent version.  The sets are the same in each performance and I find all of those excessive crosshatchings as annoying as ever.",1427328000,,1661,5.029197080291971
8486211,4,B005THVWJW,"This is my first ever hearing/viewing of Stravinsky's work, and what a pleasant surprise it is! Melodious, witty, and thoroughly engaging. The famous designs by Hockney (which I had seen before) come up as fresh as paint, and the whole production is just a delight. My main qualification is with young Tom (Mr Litipu) whose voice, pleasant though it is in softer, sweet sections, sounds a little thin and strained higher up and at volume (the same goes for his otherwise very credible David in the Glyndebourne Meistersinger). Otherwise, cast and orchestra are superb, and the whole staging is outstanding in the Glyndebourne tradition. Highly recommended.",1402444800,,656,5.19811320754717
8486212,5,B005THVWJW,"I see other reviewers have given a complete version of the story. I'll simply add that this is a delightful morality play, well produced, beautifully sung, with delightful sets and costumes. I, as with other reviewers didn't know of Stravinsky's music other than the ballet music, so this was my first encounter with his opera. I loved it. The music serves the story as well as the story serving the music. A great fit.
I also loved that it was sung in English and still had English subtitles. I wish more operas were sung in English. One misses much of the humor when reading, sometimes poor translations from another language.
You may find this a wonderful introduction to an opera composer that was unknown to you. Enjoy.",1349740800,,724,4.708661417322834
8486213,5,B005THVWJW,"The Rake's Progress was written in 1951 and first performed and staged in Vienna by Carl Ebert who was also Glyndebourne's first director of productions. Subsequently Glyndebourne staged the opera with similar Italianate designs in 1953, introducing a further staging in 1963 but this time with cartoon-influenced designs by Osbert Lancaster. This progression of change led to the current Hogarth inspired designs by David Hockney which were first seen at Glyndebourne in 1975 and were an instant hit. Since then there have been five revivals of this production and this latest performance was recorded in 2010.

Stravinsky was inspired to write the opera by seeing the group of Hogarth's 1735 creation entitled `The Rake's Progress' so it seems wholly appropriate that this production has returned to the creative root of the composition so to speak. The result is a perfect blend of ancient and modern which has avoided any aging process over the intervening 35 years and which allows the fable to relate effortlessly to the current audience generation.

The cast on this occasion is absolutely outstanding. Topi Lehtipuu as Tom Rakewell and Miah Persson as Anne Trulove retain an engaging youthful freshness throughout despite Tom's steady decline. Matthew Rose is an effective and menacingly likeable Nick Shadow and Elena Manistina keeps a light touch as Baba the Turk. Clive Bailey as Father Trulove provides the necessary steadying voice of good reason and Susan Gorton as Mother Goose is more than a match for the guileless Tom in the brothel scene. The chorus in the brothel and madhouse scenes is excellent. All concerned both sing and act their parts with utter conviction and with evident enjoyment in the music. This enjoyment readily transfers onto disc as well as to the amused and enthusiastic Glyndebourne audience.

The imaging is crisp in the manner of HD productions and has a great sense of `presence'. The sound is presented in DTS-HD and stereo and is well able to capture the excellence of the London Philharmonic's playing under the ever-watchful eye and precise direction of conductor Vladimir Jurowski.

There are two short but informative documentary extras which provide an introduction to the opera and this particular production as well as a cast gallery typical of Opus Arte productions.

I personally enjoyed this performance and production enormously and found the recording to be ideal and of very high quality throughout. In my opinion this is a clear 5 star benchmark issue and I would expect it to give equal enormous pleasure to all purchasers.",1341619200,3,2583,5.155131264916467
8486214,5,B005THVWJW,"What great fun this opera is!!  I bought the blu-ray blind. My only knowledge of Stravinsky's music is Rite of Spring and Firebird.  I did not know he had a ""neoclassical"" period.  One can certainly hear the influences of Handel and Mozart throughout the opera.  The guy who sings the devil Nick Shadow steals the show.......he has some high notes for a bass, and he pulls it off nicely.  Half way through the opera I was thinking this music is sorta like Sweeney Todd...............there is a high class Broadway sound to this piece..........think Sondheim and Bernstein.....................superb entertainment....highly recommended.

On a side note......if your blu-ray player and TV are not perfectly calibrated, you will find out quickly.... checks and lines everywhere..................this is an uber test pattern.",1330992000,2,821,5.528
8486215,5,B005THVWJW,"The newest entry into the Rake's Progress line up of DVD's is from Glyndebourne, the house that fielded the first video back in 1975. Of course it is not the same stage since the house was rebuilt and the stage enlarged and seating increased to around 1000. The decision to recreate the 1975 production was, I think, appropriate as Hockney's mise-en-scene captured the essence of Stravinsky's recreation of the 18th century style, his neo-classical style.

The 1975 staging was notable for the beginning of Felicity Lott's career and the debut of Sam Ramey as Nick Shadow. Both are superb and Lott went on to have a major career almost immediately. Ramey bided his time at City Opera inheriting Norman Treigle's roles and eventually landing at the Met. Rakewell was sung by Leo Geoke who is featured into other Glndebourne DVD's, Magic Flute and Don Giovanni. The voice is small and he is best described as adequate. Even so the set is well worth acquiring for Ramey and Lott.

The new set has no weak links in the three major roles. Tom is sung by the Finnish tenor, Topi Lehtipuu, the Ann by Swedish soprano, Miah Persson. Both are excellent and their diction is exemplary. Nick Shadow is sung by Matthew Rose; he is as good as Ramey although the two interpretations are quite different. The orchestra in both cases is the London Philharmonic, conducted by Haitink in 1975 and Jurowski in the current investiture. I would imagine there have been a great many personnel changes over the years.

For those who have resisted taking the plunge in a ""modern"" opera the Rake is a good place to begin since Stravinsky utilized forms that should be known to most opera lovers, recitatives and arias, duets and ensembles;. There is considerably melody but it does take repeated listening to discover it but one is repaid. The test by Kallman and Auden is one of the great librettos written in the last half of the 20th century and Stravinksy set it flawlessly.",1329696000,9,1953,4.755162241887906
8486216,5,B005THVWJW,"Stravinsky's A Rake's Progress is based on a libretto by W.H. Auden which, in turn, is based on the series of satirical prints by English artist and engraver William Hogarth from1735. In concept, Hogarth's work was the earliest form of ""graphic novel"" and his artwork is largely pen and ink line drawing. The storyline itself is a pretty easy to follow ""morality play"". The principal character, the young Tom Rakewell, is a young, good looking free spirit who is attracted to Anne Trulove and wishes to marry her. Anne's father questions Tom's lack of professional determination and displays some paternal hesitancy about Tom's desires. Enter a courier, Nick Shadow, with the news that Tom's all but forgotten uncle has passed away; leaving Tom a great fortune.

Shadow takes Tom to London to sign paperwork to inherit his new wealth but, along the way, Nick introduces Tom to the distractions of the big city; including prostitutes, clothiers and many other earthly sources of blowing his money. In a critical - and highly symbolic and satirical - scene Anne tracks down Tom who ends up rebuking her by announcing that he is marrying Baba the Turk who seduces well but is also a bearded lady who is quite possessive!  Tom ends up challenging Nick Shadow to win back Anne and start over in a card game that Tom does end up winning. Nick - who we infer is actually the Devil - gets revenge by making Tom insane. Rakewell spends his last days in an asylum thinking that he is Adonis and that his lost love, Anne, is Venus. He dies poor, loveless and witless.

Hogarth used lithography as a medium to make social points (having written and drawn other such stories like ""A Harlot's Progress"" and ""The Stages of Cruelty""). Auden's libretto uses the same approach but with a little more humor; coming mainly from the Baba character. Stravinsky's opera was not an initial success and is still performed only sparingly. Seen as too ""modern"" for the 1953 Sussex crowd it was written for; too ""conservative"" for those expecting Stravinsky the modernist.

This production is quite good, though, and invites revisiting the opera as one of Stravinsky's greatest achievements. Musically, this is Stravinsky in neo-Baroque form with echoes of Pulcinella and Apollon Musagte throughout. There are some very nice arias for Anne and Tom that certainly do resemble Rameau more than Puccini. The score is crisp and accented and attractive but spare. Written in three acts from nine scenes taken from the Hogarth prints, the play moves compactly and nothing lingers any longer than plot acuity demands. Musically, I feel this is a different Stravinsky from The Firebird to be sure but beautiful and attention keeping none the less.

The performances in this production are terrific. All principals in this fairly small cast are great but special kudos go to the young Finnish tenor, Topi Lehtipuu, as a nearly idiomatic Tom Rakewell and to Matthew Rose as the slimy and convincing Nick Shadow. The forces of the London Philharmonic (downsized) and the Glyndebourne Chorus play wonderfully under the young Russian and LPO music director Vladimir Jurowski. Juroswki's conducting is captivating unto itself with an angularity but crisp clarity that befit this music perfectly.

The production by renowned artist David Hockney is another reason to check out this production. Commissioned by John Cox in 1975, the set, costumes and backdrop all look - as Cox admits - a bit ""off-kilter"" but in a visually arresting way. Hockney uses the original Hogarth drawings with their pen-and-ink look to give a ""drawn"" appearance to everything from trees to buildings to clothing to masks on the chorus. Each scene is practically a lithograph itself. I first saw Hockney as a stage designer in Puccini's Turandot and became enthralled. This is a wholly different view than that work but equally amazing in my view.

If you have never heard nor seen The Rake's Progress, this production offers a very satisfying first glance. If you already know it, you may welcome a very visually unusual perception and with a great performance by Topi Lehtipuu.",1329177600,6,4111,4.975254730713246
8486217,4,B005THVWJW,"Few productions seem so perfectly matched and strike such a perfect balance between the intentions of the opera work and its presentation on the stage as David Hockney's designs for the classic Glyndebourne production of Igor Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress.  The measure of the success of the production is that it was first put on at Glyndebourne in 1975 and, as this 2010 performance at the festival shows, it is still delighting and wowing audiences thirty-five years later and will no doubt continue to be revived for many more years.  There aren't many productions that have that kind of staying power.  A modern artist surely not to everyone's taste, one might expect something relatively avant-garde from David Hockney when called upon to design the set for a 20th century opera, but in reality, his approach almost perfectly mirrors Stravinsky's method of composition for The Rake's Progress.  Seeking inspiration directly from the source of William Hogarth original drawings made in the 1730s, Hockney's sets reproduce the intricate cross-hatching in bold, colourful strokes on flat board backdrops - a modern interpretation of a classical design.

It works so well because, after all, that's exactly what Stravinsky's opera does also.  Composed in 1951, the composer working in the neo-classical form (before he moved on to serial composition), The Rake's Progress accordingly plays to the conventions of the 18th century opera.  Classically structured into three acts, with three scenes in each, Stravinsky's 20th century composition even uses recitative with harpsichord continuo and da capo arias in his treatment of a subject that has many resonances with Mozart's operas.  Since it wears its references openly, the names of the characters even reflecting their types - Tom Rakewell leaving behind his beloved Anne Trulove on the instigation of his demonic alter-ego Nick Shadow for a life of dissolution in London - The Rake's Progress can be an opera that is easier to admire more than to really love.  It's all very clever but a little dull and constricting, and the opera can consequently be a little static when performed.

There are however compensating factors that prevent The Rake's Progress from being merely a pastiche that is too clever for its own good, not least of which is a beautiful libretto by W.H. Auden and Chester Kallman and some fascinating arrangements by Stravinsky, but what this particular Glyndebourne production has going for it is of course the production by David Hockney and John Cox.  Every scene is an absolute delight, breathtaking in some places, with marvellous little touches that bring out the humour of the situations well.  Vladimir Jurowski treats the opera very much as a Russian work, while being mindful of its English and international aspects.  These are brought out fully in the casting and the singing, which is of fine quality throughout, with Miah Persson and Topi Lehtipuu demonstrating perfect English diction.  If their acting performances are unremarkable and a little static, it's probably more a failing with the nature of the opera itself - but there are enough compensating factors in the singing, the staging and the performance to make this a highly entertaining experience.

Depending on your set-up, there might be some minor aliasing in the costumes, but the transfer copes well with all the cross-hatching.  Otherwise, the full impact of the colourful production is visible in the High Definition transfer and in the actual filming.  The LPCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 tracks capture the detail of the musical performance brilliantly and dynamically.  Extra features include a Cast Gallery, a brief Introduction to the Rake's Progress that contains recent interviews with Hockney and Cox about the production, and a wider look at the opera in a 12-minute Behind the Rake's Progress featurette.",1324425600,20,3884,5.2270531400966185
