5124755,1,B0083K4NJI,"Seriously, this was one of the most poorly made movies I have ever seen. There is no action, and the dialog is simply too advanced for young kids. The elephant is shown maybe 4 times for less than a minute. I There is waaaaaay too much dialog. Cheezy acting, and it's hard for anyone to be captivated long enough to even care what happens to the elephant. Oh, and the elephant is not African, it's Indian. Maybe the creator of the film should have checked.",1346544000,2,456,4.376470588235295
8524550,1,B0083K4NJI,Firstly in this day and age no-one should be making an 'entertainment' from wild animals. Even for kids they should be learning that zoos and circuses are no places for elephants and certainly not on a film set. Dreadful film (I can see why young children like it) and shame on those who made it.,1369526400,,296,4.4

8524553,3,B0083K4NJI,"I am stunned by some of the vitriol in the negative reviews here. ""Sophie & Sheba"" is certainly not going to enter the pantheon of the world's greatest movies, but neither is it in the same category as, say, ""Manos, the Hands of Fate."" ""Sophie & Sheba"" is a cute movie that seems to be aimed primarily at children. Sophie, played well by Brittany Bristow (who, I understand, is the director's daughter), is a ballet dancer who has grown up in a small zoo. Sheba is her best friend, an elephant, and is sold to a circus. Heartbroken, Sophie tries to somehow regain Sheba.

She is unable to, but because the circus's animal trainer is unable to get Sheba to bend to his will, Sophie is able to worm her way into working for the circus (which is run by the always wonderful John Rhys-Davies). As Sophie and the resident animal trainer but heads, Sophie tries to make a deal to get the circus owner to sell Sheba back to her. But even Sophie isn't sure this is the answer after someone suggests to her that the elephant would be better off in Africa.

For the most part, the performances are solid. Yes, there are plot problems. But, as I noted, this movie seems to be aimed at a young audience, and I think it probably succeeds on that level. I should also point out that the claim that the elephant barely appears in the movie is simply wrong. There are numerous scenes involving the elephant. Granted, it does not do much, but it's there quite a bit.",1361923200,3,1449,4.402985074626866
8524554,5,B0083K4NJI,"This was on the top of my 6 year old granddaughters list.  She watches this movie over and over.
Great gift for her.  Great ""family"" movie for all ages.",1358467200,2,152,4.206896551724138
8524555,5,B0083K4NJI,My granddaaughters loved this movie and they can tell the story about the elephant so serious. It is cute to watch them be so engrossed in a movie.,1352073600,2,147,4.285714285714286
8524556,3,B0083K4NJI,"I expected more.  I expected much better.  Sophie's parents don't discuss plans, Sophie runs away with expectations, then manages to manipulate people and the media enough to get her domestic elephant sent back to Africa?  Let's go the next step; zoos are also all un-natural and unfair and expensive so lets send all the animals home.  I don't think so.  But lots of kids will after watching this.  You want a circus move; buy Toby Tyler.  It has no other objectives than to tell a story.",1349308800,,489,4.616279069767442
8524557,1,B0083K4NJI,"The cover art is charming. The music is semi-charming. Miss Bristow is charming, despite the annoying princess role. She's very charming as she duck-walks along with some ducks in the under-credits sequence. The filmmakers should have gone off-script more, included some spontaneous non-verbal scenes of her w/ Sheba (the sort of images we saw in the opening stills), instead of the clanking back-&-forth of so much human/human dialogue. (The writer/director is the star's real-life father, which smacks of early-onset Coppola Syndrome.) I wanted SOPHIE & SHEBA to be good because...well, who doesn't love a good boy/girl-&-his/her[insert animal companion here]movie? This isn't that movie, not the LASSIE or FLIPPER of pachydermdom. I assume the core audience is tweenage girls; even they (who are smarter than the purveyors of tween product give them credit for being) will likely find it saccharine & predictable...

(DIS)SIMILAR PRODUCTS:

SOPHIE & SHEBA is something of a Hallmarked-down WATER FOR ELEPHANTS, that truly horrendous spectacle of animal cruelty (despite its vivid period evocation & the complicitous texture of Christoph Waltz's villainy)...

For a great movie (indeed, a poetic masterpiece) on S&S's theme (intended theme, anyway), a young person's spiritual development via helping animals, I recommend 1992's FLY AWAY HOME, in which Anna Paquin leads some orphaned geese on their southward migration...",1346630400,2,1424,5.644859813084112
8524558,1,B0083K4NJI,"Why is no one in this movie the least bit likable?  Why does the plot hinge on so many illogical events?  Who wrote the wooden, dragging and implausible dialogue?  Why, in a movie about the circus, are there so few scenes featuring acrobatics, or animals, humor or entertainment?  What school of funerary arts did the director attend?  What is the point of this movie?  What drugs was the ""newscaster"" character on, and did these substances make appearing in this clunker less painful?  This was the WORST $3.99 I ever spent, and it was clear within the first 120 seconds that I had made a bad mistake... This movie makes your typical American soap opera look fast paced, intelligent and engaging.  Honestly, the 2  minutes of shots of the elephant and the 60 seconds of the lemur riding around on the lead character's shoulders were the only times I wasn't rolling my eyes in annoyance.  Don't subject yourself - or your child - to this piece of utter crap.",1346630400,,958,4.648809523809524
8524559,3,B0083K4NJI,"The meat is thin on this family friendly movie, but it does provide clean, circus fun and a cute elephant.

A teenage ballerina runs off and joins the circus to be with her beloved elephant.  There she makes friends and a few foes as she gets to perform and work at rescuing her animal.

The storyline is basic and thin, and one that might not hold child and ,definitely not, adults, interest for long except for the cute animals.  The actors are ok; there is a small circus setting with animals including a black panther and, of course, Sheila, the endearing elephant.

No language, sex, only mild peril, a few dramatic parts, some bouncy music and a touch of young romance.  I don't dislike it, but wouldn't watch again.",1346544000,4,722,4.558139534883721
