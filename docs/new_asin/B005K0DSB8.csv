8476351,1,B005K0DSB8,"Extremely disappointed with this edition. We bought this one specifically because it was the blue-ray digital combined edition. Despite the packaging indicating that the digital edition is for the US and Canada, the digital code is not redeemable in the US.",1519948800,3,257,5.2926829268292686

8476355,5,B005K0DSB8,"There is a big difference between the Blu-ray version and the DVD. On my 48"" Samsung HD television screen, I am able to see details that are obvious:
.
1. Looking at the facial closeups, especially the old nuns, the observer is able to view individual hair strands with their different shades and colors. Some are mis-combed. Cosmetics also fail to hide pimples, wrinkles, blemishes, brown spots, and pores.
.
2. Individual stitches on Maria's hat are observable. Likewise, her nun's jacket exhibits various folds and creases, stitchings, and worn ends.
.
I am not able to see the above on the DVD version.",1466640000,6,606,4.836538461538462
