7955509,1,B00005UW9O,"This could be described as Troma art house short features. This is a collection of nine short films (about 10-30 minutes in length) that couldn't get shown anywhere else. They are all extremely low budget, one feature uses cheap dolls and has no actors. I found some interest in one short which looked at the inner workings of a debt collection agency. These are films that have no standards for entertainment. I found myself fast forwarding through the last half of most of the films.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. 1 brief FF nude scene (Zitlover) in main feature,",1410480000,2,560,4.77319587628866
7955510,5,B00005UW9O,"Troma's DVD showing off the best short films of their Tromadance film festival in 2000 is a great collection of shorts ranging from weird and twisted to downright hilarious. The three best are ""Deadbeats"" starring Mick Foley, ""Family Dinner Party,"" and the docu-short ""Please Kill Mr. Kinski."" The worst one was ""SPAG,"" an odd horror film you'll either love or hate. There are also notes about each movie as well as an episode of Troma's Edge and a few previews for some of Troma's own bloody spectaculars. This is a great DVD for those into the independent market.",1039478400,2,565,4.775510204081633
7955511,5,B00005UW9O,"VERY INSPIRING COLLECTION OF HIT AND MISS SHORT FILMS. THE INLET INFO REALLY PUSHES THE IDEA OF MAKING YOUR OWN FILM. A GOOD PRICE FOR THIS GREAT COLLECTION AND THE ENCOURAGING TAKE ON INDEPENDENT CINEMA IS WONDERFUL, BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN, YES INDEED.
HOW WEIRD IT IS TO SEE MICK FOLEY PLAYING A THIRD PARTY COLLECTOR AND GETTING INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH A DEBTOR ON THE PHONE. FUN FOR EVERYONE.
BLIND, CRIPPLED OR CRAZY...GO BUY, NOW.",1014249600,4,431,4.76
