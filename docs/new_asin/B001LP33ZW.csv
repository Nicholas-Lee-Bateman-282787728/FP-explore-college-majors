8319317,1,B001LP33ZW,"I ordered this item 3 times from 2 different sellers and each time the set contained two copies of ""Battles for Tunisia"" and
no copy of ""El Alamein"". It was extremely frustrating, and obviously is the fault of the supplier.",1317686400,3,223,4.6
8319318,2,B001LP33ZW,"The battle for the Mediterranean was excellent.  They gave a good account by all sides with the missteps by the Italians, Germans and British.  The thoughts and
processes and how they came up with the battle plans made for an interesting program.  El Alamein is a different story.  There was so much repetition of subject matter that one could walk away for 20 minutes and not miss a thing.  The Battles for Tunisia  also had some repetition in it but not as bad as El Alamein.  I say save your money and buy the single disc for The Battle for the Mediterranean.",1313020800,4,562,4.450980392156863
