7907237,4,B00000F676,These do not play in your CD player because they are not meant for resale in America. They must be played on the computer with an HDMI cable hooked from the computer to the TV. Otherwise; the product is very nice in appearance and all of the CD's are there. I am happy to have this product. I think there should be more emphasis placed on the previously mentioned information.,1489795200,3,376,4.385714285714286
7907238,5,B00000F676,"Great set of the Smurfs 1980's cartoon series. You get the complete seasons 1-5 in their own jewel case. Each season has a booklet listing each episode with description and image from each episode. Season 1 has a character booklet. The DVD menu also has the episode descriptions. There are a few episodes which I have not seen on Boomerang, for example Smurfs Olympics from season 3. Intro songs are the original UK version. Video and audio is great. This is region 2 pal format. I got the Samsung E360K region free DVD player and works great. Recommended for any classic animation fan.",1484438400,8,586,4.699029126213592

7907240,5,B00000F676,"This is one of the smurfiest anthologies that I own! Episodes galore of the Smurfs! Some of the smurfiest adventures to date! I am glad to say that I own it. I watch it frequently. I have to take it easy lately cause the smurfin' tape is so worn out from years and years of smurfing it! I doubt that it is available anywhere else. Smurf it from Amazon.com! You must!
Smurf on!",1018915200,34,376,4.164383561643835
