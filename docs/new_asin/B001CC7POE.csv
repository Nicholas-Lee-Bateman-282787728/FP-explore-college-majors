3507831,3,B001CC7POE,"Just received the set and it's okay being the whole series is here but it's no different from the original 6 sets. I would have liked it better if they included maybe a book or something besides the disks like the Batman Animated series box set does.

It mentions 4.5 hours of extras leading me to believe they added more extras but that's not the case. The extras are the same as in the individual sets.

Packaging comes in 2 booklets made of cheap cardboard with very tight sleeves to insert the disks. This can and will cause some scratches on the disk being it's tight. About half my discs do have visible scratches on them. The booklets are nice with just the episode titles of each disc listed on them.

I hate the ugly orange case so i got rid of it and kept the 2 booklets.

So i give a 3 star rating for the content, and minus 2 stars for lack of anything extra from the original sets.",1225411200,69,894,4.2105263157894735
3507832,5,B001CC7POE,"I don't see how you can give a rating to a product even before it comes out and you haven't even seen the product. Then on top of it you give it 4 stars. Beleive me the Flintsones are only 5 stars and nothing less. Its people like you that give ratings a bad reputation, because you just throw ratings out there for no good reason at all. WAIT TO SEE THE PRODUCT BEFORE YOU PUT A RATING ON IT.",1221264000,10,393,3.925
3507833,4,B001CC7POE,"i am so thrilled that a Box Set for The Complete Series Of The Flintstones,  will get a DVD Release in late October, of 2008!!! I LOVED this wonderful Hanna-Barbera Animation Classic, as a kid, which aired from 1960- 1966, and now at the age of 41, this show brings back great childhood memories for me, and a time in the world, when things seemed so much more simple in life!!

I lost all 6 of my individual Season Box Sets, of The Flintstones, due to very unfortunate family circumstances, so I am just 'Over-The-Moon,' that I now have the opportunity to get my greedy little hands on a Complete Box Set, of American's Modern Stone-Age Family!! The only reason my review receives 4 out of 5 Stars, is because I am not very hopeful that any new extras will be included on this set, other than what is already existing on those earlier original Box Set, releases!! Still, it would be just FANTASTIC, if treasures like, 1993's TV Animated Movie, I Yabba Dabba Do, where Pebbles, marries Bam-Bam, 1977's hour-long animated special,  Flintstone Christmas, and 1978's The Flintstones' Little Big League, were among any surprises that might possibly be on this set!!! All I can do is pray that Warner Bros., will read this review!!!

In an UPDATE from Warner Bros., and courtesy of TVShowsOnDVD.com, which I only noticed/read several days after I wrote my initial review, which did state that The Flintstones: The Complete Series, (166 Episodes) would be a Limited Edition Box Set, and it would include over 4.5 hours of new bonus material!! There is no word yet, as to just what these additional extras might be,  but I am keeping my fingers crossed that they could be some of the wonderful programing that I mentioned in my review, originally!!",1215561600,21,1741,4.713815789473684
3507873,1,B001CC7POE,"I normally do not give 1 star reviews but this is an exception. The discs in this Complete Series box set are all scratched. There are major playback issues. I own hundreds of discs and this is the worst I have ever seen. Scratches are major, and many. You cannot wipe them off. There are even other residues, like glue. This is a packaging that went terribly wrong. I also own Laurel and Hardy The Essential Collection which is a similar type of package but they are beautiful. Some people bash the packaging design but it's not the design. I actually love the sleeve design but these discs are poorly handled and scratched. Stay away from buying this. Buy the individual seasons instead or wait for another Complete Collection which may not come any time soon. I just corresponded with Warner Bros. and they are actually not actively manufacturing the complete series.",1515628800,8,870,4.730263157894737

3507876,2,B001CC7POE,"The two stars are for the packaging and disc quality only.  The cartoons and transfers are top notch all the way,  Now with that out of the way, the outer box is strong and very nice but the inside storage is where the trouble starts.  The sleeves that hold the discs are sooo tight it's almost impossible to remove them without scratching or tearing the sleeves themselves.  The Third disc (in my case) of seasons 3, 4, and five are double sided discs and none of them would play.  I absolutely hate double sided discs and for close to $90. I'm sure they could have remedied this and the rest of the problems.  I promptly returned the set for a refund,  I will definitely buy another set if I can find a different manufacturer.  Those of you who have gotten a set with all single sided discs please let me know who it was in the comments section.  Thanks.  All in all, great quality transfers with wonderful cartoons but falls short on packaging and disc playback.",1512518400,,965,4.431818181818182

3507885,5,B001CC7POE,"Before there was The Simpsons, there was The Flintstones... I grew up watching this and to this day, it is still one of my all-time favorite television programs!

From what I have seen online, it's pretty hard to find ""complete"" collections of The Flintstones, in fact this is the ONLY ""complete"" collection I could find... But this packages includes all of the television episodes in their correct chronological order, presented in a unique storage box which matches the theme.

I did find that the cardboard ""slip"" covers which the discs are stored in (inside the box) are a little difficult to remove the discs from and I suspect that over time, this may hasten wear-and-tear on the discs themselves... For me, this is not a big issue because I ""rip"" all of my optical media (CDs/DVDs/Blu-Ray Discs) to digital formats as soon as I buy them - but the vast majority of people reading this won't, so I recommend you consider buying cheap, alternate cases from a local store if you plan to watch these regular.

Other than that though, I have no problem with this and I simply cannot recommend it highly enough, if you want the best-quality version of ""The Flintstones"" currently available!",1504051200,2,1190,4.795121951219512
3507886,1,B001CC7POE,"I am getting another copy from a different manufacturer!
Here's why...
The copy from ""Crystal Choice Products"" was utter trash!!!
I had read a review that the packaging of the disk was hard to get out, so when I got mine I saw that each disk had a sleeve to make it easy to pull out, and it did but the disks (50%) had the sleeves GLUED to the DVD hence NO play...the remaining 50% had NO data or badly written data to where when tried on many DVD players, be it dedicated to playing DVD's or a computer ONE disc played and it was GLITCHY!!!

ONE disk out of 24...Where is the Q.A. manager???

Stay tuned to see if the other manufacturer ""VulcanDeals"" can do better.

For now my advice is to avoid Crystal Choice (LOL) Products!!!
They have a year warranty...What a laugh to guarantee GLUED and NO data written junk!!!",1503273600,2,818,4.333333333333333

3507888,4,B001CC7POE,"Forget about what you are reading about the packaging.  The DVDs are snug in their storage area, but that's resolved by opening up the slots.  There is one problem and I wish I knew how to address it:  the first CD has no picture on it.  It is supposed to have bonus material on the other side.  There isn't anything on the flip side.",1502755200,,334,4.15625

The only thing I wish was different is the packaging as other reviewers had mentioned. It is in a great box novelty box set and the discs are perfectly labeled to find, but the ""book"" that holds them is a very tight slot for each disc, so I worry about long term storage and them getting scratched.

My family frequently watched the Flintstones while growing, and now watching it with my kids, I find it still refreshingly funny and cute to watch, even as most cartoons have grown old and stale, the writing and talent involved were obviously all top-notch from the era, as it was it holds up through the test of time.  My older siblings watched it in the 60s when it was new, I saw it in the 70s, and my grade-school kids love it!  Some of the reviews made me leery to buy this due to the packaging issues, which I found to be true; sure enough, the disc-holding pockets WERE tight, but I solved this easily by gently inserting my hand into each pocket when empty and gently loosening the edges-voila!  My kids can easily insert/remove discs now, no problem, and the packing is not compromised.  The ""family"" picture is lenticular, and the top of the box lifts off, where you find the 2 books of discs inside.

The packaging leaves a little to be desired. Sure, it looks nice on the outside, but the paper that tells you what is in the box comes off as soon as you open the cellophane and the DVD's are in some really cheap sleeves. I would guess that the DVD's would get scratched really easily by pulling them out and putting them back in the sleeves after watching.

3508046,1,B001CC7POE,"Was so excited to get the entire series for such a great price,then I saw the packaging. Cheap cardboard sleeves that are so tight there is no way to avoid scratching the disc taking them out. So basically I have 24 scratched up discs which I can guarantee some won't even play and I haven't even used it yet! Most reviewers are mentioning it and they are most accurate. Only I go one step further. Avoid this at all costs. I'd even recommend buying seasons individually. In the end you may spend $20-40 more doing it that way,but at least you know your collection will be well taken care of in ACTUAL DVD or Blu Ray cases. This,on the other hand is absolute garbage.",1452470400,32,667,4.387096774193548

The packaging was a surprise. That wasn't a motive on ordering but the packaging is very nice with a retro style 3D Card on the package 'TV Screen Window' like the 3D style that used to be given away in children's cereal when I was a kid.",1452211200,,437,4.265060240963855

3508049,5,B001CC7POE,"I had been watching this set for many months and just couldn't ""justify"" the expense.... but then it went on sale for less than HALF the typical price!! I scooped my set up in a heartbeat! It arrived just before Christmas, so I wrapped it up and put it under the tree for my kids. Before Christmas Day, they had NEVER had the opportunity to watch my favorite cartoon, The Flintstones!! We watched several episodes that day and also the next day too. The DVD's are packaged nicely in this box set, I'm not a huge fan of the little cardboard book like thing that they're packaged in inside the ""tv box"" but it's not a terrible design either. The fit is a bit tight so children have a hard time getting it out initially, however I found that when I went thru each ""page"" of the book and pressed on the ends to open it slightly it released the DVD rather easily and now my children (ages 11 & 8) can get them out with ease and no worry of scratching them up. The picture quality is pretty much the same as I remember when watching it on TV, it's not beautifully restored or in HD or anything, but for me that just adds to the nostalgia. I'm VERY pleased with this purchase!!",1451692800,11,1170,4.227678571428571

my rating is based on this viewpoint, from my childhood.

otherwise? yeah i would say it's an ok setup. EXCEPT the fact that the dvds are in cardboard which ticks me off.

Then my wife bought our kids Flintstones vitamins & they started asking questions so I thought this was a good way to introduce them to 1 of my favorite TV show. On Sunday evenings my family & I will sit & enjoy a few episodes the kids ask questions  here & there. today's cartoon lack that authentic look since the introduction of digital which I don't care for.

3508113,4,B001CC7POE,"All things considered, Seasons 13 were quite good.

Following Pebbles birth during Season 3, however, theres a shift toward subject matter that is more juvenile.  For instance, Season 4 introduces Bamm-Bamm; and Season 5 introduces Hoppy (a particularly annoying, non-value added animal character).

The show reached its nadir during Season 5 (1964-65) where it begins to incorporate then-current popular culture styles, fads and trends  which quickly date the show.  In this regard, it is unfortunate to observe the incorporation of rock and roll music as a focal point in several of the episodes as well as the utilization of an underscore that no longer exclusively supports the visual element.

As luck would have it, the Season 6 addition of The Great Gazoo, at first glance would appear beyond absurd.  Yet, his presence uniquely re-invents the series by serving as an unwanted conscience, necessary helpmate, and quasi-foil to Fred and Barney.  In addition, Gazoo's presence adds a welcomed tension to the primary characters and is complemented by both a heightened animation quality and an improved underscore.  As a result, Season 6 nearly approaches the exellent quality of Seasons 1 and 2.

Regarding the packaging:  As it was clearly WARNERs goal to maximize physical impact against the playing surface, a suggested improvement in this regard would be to include fragments of WARNER-authorized Genuine Bedrock within the sleeves.",1435881600,,1441,5.36

3508205,3,B001CC7POE,"Anyone purchasing this set already knows that 'The Flintstones' is the first prime time animated television series. It is hailed as one of the best animated TV series ever created. Very few people who review this product will dispute that it's a fun show, but most people are giving the same criticism...the way it is packaged as a box set. If you buy the set in seasons, it seems to have no packaging problems. But as a series, the manufacturers often like to find 'creative' packaging to make it look more attractive. Unfortunately these ideas often mean that packaging is all wrong for discs. This is no exception. The cardboard sleeves are very tight and definitely cause scratches every time you take a disc out. This is even more of a problem since some of the discs are double sided which I absolutely HATE. They get scratched and finger printed incredibly easily. So I actually took a scissors to the cardboard sleeves and cut each one down so that it slides much easier since now I can even put my finger in the hole of the disc to gently pull it out. Although it helps, I do believe it's best to do what most people suggest and what I have often done myself to other series shows. Purchase some empty DVD cases and put the discs in them. However, for me, it's not just that. I like to know what discs are in which sleeve and the titles of the episodes. So I put more effort into it and more expense by creating an insert using a computer and printer for each one. I also print a cover picture for the front and type episode titles on the back. I usually use double sleeves to save more space. It also bothers me in this set that the boxes in the packaging aren't the same size as my other DVD sets. I also create my own 'box' to store my sleeves in so that they stay together. it's work but in the end I have my boxed set which is easy to open and does not scratch as easily.",1395792000,119,1885,4.268156424581005

3508276,5,B001CC7POE,"Without a doubt, 'The Flintstones' remains the quintessential animated television sitcom of all time. And now, thanks to modern stone-age technology, the entire series is available on DVD, featuring all 166 episodes from all 6 complete seasons. Growing up as a young kid in the late 60s/early 70s, I used to watch this show everyday after school as well as during the school breaks. It is interesting to note that in rerun syndication, an episode would feature Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm one day, but only Fred, Wilma, Barney and Betty the next day. Even the Christmas episode would be seen during the summer! Now, you can watch every episode of this timeless classic program in the original broadcast order, so you can easily see exactly how the series was able to develop over the course of 6 years. From the debut show 'The Flintstone Flyer' which opens season 1 to the final episode 'The Story Of Rocky's Raiders' which closes season 6, and all points in between, this DVD set is a must-have for every fan of Bedrock. Gathering the entire series onto 24 DVDs, plus a rock quarry's worth of bonus material, 'The Flintstones' belongs in every cave-dweller's DVD library; Yabba-Dabba-Do!",1325116800,46,1183,4.890547263681592
3508277,5,B001CC7POE,"THE FLINTSTONES-THE COMPLETE SERIES: HANNA BARBERA's modern stone-age take on THE HONEYMOONERS was the first animated sitcom for prime time, an easy contender for best loved, most enduring cartoon series ever. Character actor ALAN REED voiced loudmouthed caveman FRED FLINTSTONE and LOONEY TUNES legend MEL BLANC was his even-tempered best pal BARNEY RUBBLE, frequent foils for their sardonic, ultimately smarter wives WILMA and BETTY; the cast was rounded out by hyperactive pet runtasaurus DINO and cute kiddies PEBBLES and BAMM BAMM. The action took place in BEDROCK, where FRED drove a foot-powered automobile and dwelled in a typical split-level cave tricked out with all the latest animal-powered conveniences, including bird beak phonographs and pig garbage disposals that often provided cheeky commentary. Kitschy guest stars ranging from music group THE BEAU BRUMMELSTONES to HOLLYROCK icons STONEY CURTIS and ANN MARGROCK (voiced by the actors themselves) turned up, along with lampoons of everything from THE ADDAMS FAMILY and BEWITCHED to JAMES BOND and ALFRED HITCHCOCK. Boasting some of animation's most colorful characters, sharpest writing and most memorable theme songs, THE FLINTSTONES were truly pop culture's first ""rock stars"".

They still play in our old dvd player, but its difficult to read the tiny print on the inner circle of the dvd.  In addition to the cheap dvd sleeves, the decal on the front of the orange exterior box has started to curl up on the top and bottom.  Its nothing more than a thick sticker.

It has that chunky rock-like Flintstone look to it, is sturdy, and protects the DVD's really well, as well as being water proof (though, not water tight). The only reason I gave this a 4 is because, as stated, the sleeves in the books are tight and it is hard to get the DVD's out without touching them (DVD's should always be handled by the edges), and they are not soft and will cause scratches.

I really wanted just some Flintstones videos to watch as I hadn't seen any in so long and thought it would be nice. This was given to me as a gift and I love it! I've enjoyed re-watching these more than I ever thought I would. I get some humor that I didn't get as a kid, and the commentaries are interesting and enlightening.

I know that The Flintstones will attract a lot of grown-up collectors, but I've got to believe that small children will also love these cartoons and handle the orange box.  Children tend not to notice this kind of thing, and then place their hands in their mouths, etc.

3508326,5,B001CC7POE,"If you have owned a television set in the last several decades you have heard or come across episodes of ""The Flintstones"", one of the very first animated cartoons ever broadcast on American network TV. Originally airing in the early sixties on ABC from 1960-1966, ""The Flintstones"" has a place in American pop culture forever and thanks to timeless reruns and the advent of DVD these exceptional shows will live on in posterity. This beautiful set contains all 166 shows of the series run, restored with exceptional audio and video clarity. You will find the original openings of the show's first two seasons in this set, an opening that was ultimately replaced on all subsequent syndicated airings with the more popular opening from season three and on. However, what you won't find are the rare cigarette commercials certain characters did from the original network airings in which tobacco companies sponsored the show. ""The Flintstones"" never left the top 30 of all network shows during its first three years and it went on to enjoy immense success in syndication and eventually the DVD market, spawning theatrical features as well. This set contains some neat bonuses, including the original pilot of the series called ""The Flagstones"", as well as interviews with those who worked behind the scenes on the making of this television treasure. Sit back and enjoy Fred, Wilma, Barney, Betty, Dino, Pebbles, and Bam-Bam forever in the comfort of your own home without the hassels of TV commercials.",1261958400,6,1500,5.05241935483871

As the years went by, it was interesting to watch the changes that happened:  a new opening theme song, the birth of Pebbles,  the appearance of Wilma's mother,  Anne Margrock (Ann Margret) and other unusual characters.
I like watching the way the drawing style evolved over the seasons, as well as those things which never seemed to change.  With so much Flintstone's material available in this DVD set, it's easy to find occasional animation mistakes. My favorite is when Wilma's eyebrows disappear as she turns her head!  And on the first season shows with the original closing title, we see Fred turn off the TV and walk past Wilma, asleep in her bed. She has NO mouth! Amazing.",1229904000,3,767,4.7727272727272725

I own a 26 inch Sharp TV, which is by no means any kind of high end TV. However, even with this TV I can see dirt, water spots, and scratches on every episode from the first season.  I haven't watched the rest so I'm not sure of the quality for the remaining seasons, but I suspect it will be the same.  You can clearly see dirt and water spots on the prints, especially on the faces of each character, due to the color used for their skin.  I loved this show when I was a kid, and am disappointed in the poor quality of the prints that were used to create the DVDS.  I am also surprised that the studio's quality control department allowed the product to ship like this; it would appear that their motto was profit over quality.",1228953600,15,900,4.173410404624278
3508347,4,B001CC7POE,"I have loved the Flinstones since I was a child & was very happy to hear about a complete set.  I had never seen them on discs before this set, which I'm now finding out that was available a while back.  I've only had a chance to watch the 1st season & I love it.  My kids & I have had lots of laughs over it.  I like the storage case it's in & even like the little booklets that hold the DVDs because they remind you of story books.  However,  I don't like the little booklets for holding my DVDs.  I had a hard time removing them all from the sleeves when I received it.  I have hard cases & another container that I placed them all in (24 cases I believe).  I don't want my DVDs scratched & that's what's going to happen if I leave them in the sleeves they sent them in.  I thought that was cheaply & poorly done.  Looks like they could have created the same style in a hard DVD cases with lock in holders instead of cheap cardboard that just slides in.  If they had of been packaged right, I would have given them 5 stars, but I'm rating it 4 stars because of packaging & almost leaned toward 3 stars.",1228089600,13,1105,3.9954337899543377
3508348,4,B001CC7POE,the flintstones;the complete series is a must have for those who love classic cartoons or for those who have small children and want to show them what 'real cartoons' are. i highly recommend this series. the only problem is that the discs are hard to get out of the cardboard sleeves that make up the 'book' that they are packed in. seems like the discs will scratch easily. for that reason i give the flintstones a 4.,1227830400,71,418,4.441558441558442

8286590,3,B001CC7POE,Really like the set but the dvds can get scratched the way they are in the case. I bought a cd case with just enough slots just to be safe and put them in there. Display is really nice though. Also the last DVDs in each book (so season 3 and 6) do not work. The last in season 6 side B works but not not A. Season 3 last disk doesnt work on either side.,1524441600,,353,3.6578947368421053

8286593,4,B001CC7POE,"I bought the Hanna-Barbera Diamond Collection version of The Complete Series from another retailer.

Comes in two large keep cases housed in a slip case.
Each disc has artwork and each seasons discs are there own color. For example season one has Purple colored artwork, the second season has blue colored artwork and so on.

Even comes with a handy episode booklet with a break-down of what's on each disc.

Now the bad. No Special Features at all.

Would have given this set a 5 if it had the special features, but glad that I could finally get the complete series at a cheap price.",1519862400,,584,4.533333333333333

For Starters, The original release had 24 discs and extras. This re-issue, There are only 20 discs and Zero extras. On the Plus side, there are no double sided discs unlike the 2012 version. I hate those.

On the downside, The Discs have different artwork. The pictures are mostly the same, but they are clear labels with the image in one color while the original release, the discs were in full color.
And the Menu, The menu is more plain with no audio, Like a lot of the MOD DVD-R titles I've purchased. They likely did that so they can save data on the disc to cram more episodes on. Season 1 is only 3 discs, as for the 2012 release, it was on 4 discs, with disc 4 being double sided and having extras on it's B-Side.

Overall The picture quality is still great but the fact there was no warning about there being no extras on this re-issue is a disappointment, A minor disappointment, but a disappointment nonetheless",1518739200,4,1458,5.835680751173709
