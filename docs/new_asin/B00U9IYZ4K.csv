7031215,5,B00U9IYZ4K,"Lovely and well done just as all the nature videos by Tony Helsloot.  World Nature Video offers amazing nature videos for relaxation and exercise.  This is no exception.  This dvd includes beautiful and diverse scenes of Corsica, France.  The hills and ocean views are amazing.  High quality nature sounds.  This is a great tool to make your exercise routine more interesting.  It is nice for just relaxing, too.  The wind blowing through the leaves and the birds make for a very peaceful atmosphere.",1429574400,,500,4.9397590361445785
7031216,5,B00U9IYZ4K,"Three 20 min. rides, which loop continuously from 1 to 3 and then back to 1 again for as long as you wish. You mainly ride coastal windy country roads (no traffic) around parts of the island, with absolutely stunning views of the ocean and coastal landscape!!  The scenery is diverse as well as the speed you travel.  In some parts it's faster and then a bit slower again. Up hill and then down hill.  Nice variety!  The ambient sounds change from just wind in some parts and to the birds chirping in other sections of the road.  Occasionally you spot a village down hill or a car, but for the most part you are alone with nature! The 60 min. journey ends at a coastal village, with the waves crashing on the beach. Love it!  You can watch a trailer of these DVDs on the producers' website www.worldnaturevideo.com or if you prefer to download HD digital versions of these Virtual Cycle Rides or Virtual Walks, you can do so there too.  The HD digital versions play very well with Apple TV on my television.  Highly recommended workout companion to your stationary bike rides!!",1429315200,2,1077,4.515463917525773
7031217,5,B00U9IYZ4K,"This DVD is very well suited for training with the bike. Sometimes it is nice to cycle uphill slowly, then very quickly down the road. This change of speed is really varied. Sometimes you pass on mountain roads to rocks, then again on coastal roads with the Mediterranean Sea in the background. Here you can admire the beautiful landscape of the island during training. The colors on this DVD are gorgeous, especially the bright blue sky and the blue of the Mediterranean Sea, all that gives you a real feeling of vacation. The sounds of ocean or birds as background noise are also excellent. I was very impressed by the landscape photographs on this DVD, definitely one of my favorite DVDs. .",1429056000,,693,4.688524590163935
8704756,5,B00U9IYZ4K,I bought an indoor stationary bicycle several months ago and like being able to ride inside my home with DVDs like this one where it really feels as though you're in another country.  I thought that it was well done and thoroughly enjoy it.,1520121600,,240,4.454545454545454
8704757,1,B00U9IYZ4K,"Really looking forward to using this while I sit on my stationary bike.  The video moves way too slow for cycle.  Probably good for runners, but there isn't much speed change for level or downhill portions.",1506988800,,206,4.694444444444445
8704758,5,B00U9IYZ4K,I used video in a 3 hour bike class.  It was well received.,1492992000,,59,3.5384615384615383
8704759,5,B00U9IYZ4K,As expected !,1490054400,,13,3.6666666666666665
8704760,2,B00U9IYZ4K,Really boring slow video through dry countryside.  No instructions on how to pace or vary the workout.,1486339200,,102,5.0
8704761,2,B00U9IYZ4K,Pretty boring scenery. I always imagined France as  being greener.,1471651200,,66,5.6
8704762,5,B00U9IYZ4K,"Excellent video. Perfect for a workout on my recumbent exercise bicycle. Beautiful scenery, good pace, with non- intrusive realistic natural background sounds.",1461110400,,159,6.2727272727272725
8704763,5,B00U9IYZ4K,"The scenery is stunning! Majestic mountains, rocky cliffs, beautiful trees everywhere, overlooking the ocean (I think that's an ocean?), it's absolutely magical! The pace for most scenes on this one is pretty fast, which I LOVE! I may not keep up but I sure try! There are slower parts, too, which is nice if you want a bit of a breather, but I tend to disregard the pace whenever I want without much difficulty in any spot of the film. If you're familiar with these types of videos and wondering if scenes are changed by the annoying page-turning method, this one is not. It's mostly country scenes in France, not much action or people in this one, though we do pass through a small village for a brief period and the occasional car or biker will pass in different areas but I really love that!

You can watch trailers of these videos on their website worldnaturevideo.com/productlist/VirtualCycleDvd.html to accurately choose the ones you want. Some are much better quality than others and this one is fantastic! They also have some for walking that are paced fast enough to use while cycling but I find the pace doesn't really bother me much either way. They were shot in HD, which is great, but the sides looked blurry and made me dizzy until I upgraded my DVD player. They look much better now and I really enjoy them, especially this one, it's my favorite- but it does have a few bird sounds in certain places that get annoying after a while.",1448409600,,1448,4.612403100775194
8704764,5,B00U9IYZ4K,"I find this program both calm and exhilarating as I move through the glorious high mountains with their rugged beauty, including shrubs and plants growing among the mountain rocks.  The views are superb with the beautiful dark blue sea to one side, below me and the steep hillside on the other.

I enjoy seeing the mist over the peaks in the distance and the sun setting over the sea; and the birdsong gives me a peaceful feeling as the waves wash onto the stone covered beach.  I also enjoy passing through the villages with white-painted houses, and the church with its bell ringing out.

Although this DVD is advertised as a cycle ride around the beautiful island of Corsica, I found it to be equally good for walking as any of my other discs from this company.

I love this disc so much I feel I will be using it often.",1432598400,,823,4.423841059602649
8704765,5,B00U9IYZ4K,"Another great cycling video from the Ambient Group, this one through the rocky, ocean-fronted cliffs of Corsica. I like hills, and much of these three exhilarating rides are climbs into the rugged mountains of this famous island. What goes up must come down, and your bike is no exception. You can feel the wind in your hair as you glide down to sea level. Each approx 20 min ride features mountain climbs and descents to the blue ocean or inlets. The rides are at different times of the day, so you might pedal through a cooling morning fog, or climb into the bright, cloudless sky at Noon, or bike during the sunset, when the road and the cliffs turn a beautiful red. You can play one ride at a time, or let it loop for an hour workout. Either way, you will forget you're in a gym and on an exercise bike. Instead, you will be riding through the rocky geology of a mountainous area surrounded by the bluest ocean. The white red tiled villas beckon. If you cant afford the plane fare to Corsica, simply play this beautifully photographed DVD as you work out.",1429574400,2,1059,4.435897435897436
