1800943,5,B000075SNH,One of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Loved it!,1074643200,3,55,4.0
1800944,5,B000075SNH,"I was recovering from hip surgery and popped this movie in the VCR at about 1:00 a.m.  It looked like a cute drama from the cover, something I could watch and fall asleep to. I couldn't have been more wrong.  Before long I was laughing so hard I popped my stitches and woke my entire family up.  I mean to tell you this is the funniest movie I have ever seen in my life. So funny I had to bury my face in the pillow to keep from waking the neighbors. Gut busting hilarity....Jill Clayburg is like you've never seen her before! Jeffrey Tambor is fresh, charming, and outrageously funny portraying a slightly bent free spirited jazz musician.
There's a little piece of everyone in these two characters and will keep you in stitches for weeks to come!  This movie is for anyone over 30 who has ever vowed ""Never Again"" to serious relationships.  It's upbeat, up to date and an absolute must see, and for me....a must own!  It's the funniest movie at the video  store....and now at amazon.com! ""Never Again"" is the most under rated, under advertised, block buster comedy of all time. I just can't say enough! 5 stars in my book!
Sincerely,
Sherry Malone",1060300800,23,1149,4.4951923076923075
1800945,4,B000075SNH,"Don't know if this movie is really rated very highly by the critics but I can relate. In my prime (middle age) I was suddenly single from a divorce and the ""scene"" was all new to me. Gays and lesbians? what's that. Dating? don't get involved.
Both the male and female characters were true in this movie except for the suit of armor. That was a bit much but fit in with the story. Loved the actors. Solid acting but not ""pretty faces"" that Hollywood usually presents.
I recommend this movie. Not to everyone but if you are divorced and going thru the process again....watch it.",1060128000,8,576,4.443396226415095
1800946,5,B000075SNH,"This is the funniest movie, the best. I just rented it watched it, and watched it again as soon as it was over. It's not only funny but it touches on serious relationship issues and makes real sense of them. It's a classic, better than If Lucy Fell which was my favorite movie, until now.",1045353600,4,288,4.254545454545455
1800947,5,B000075SNH,So Funny!!! And Real.,1453593600,,21,4.5
1800948,4,B000075SNH,"I'd never heard of this film and ordered it for Jill Clayburgh. Both she and Tambor give quite poignant and endearing performances in a romantic comedy made by adults FOR adults. It was a pleasant surprise, a great performance to stem later in Clayburgh's career. Definitely worth a look for fans of the actors.",1449187200,,311,4.777777777777778

1800952,5,B000075SNH,"Laugh till you drop! This movie is a mix of comedy and reality that sheds light on how ""seasoned""adults deal with relationships on different levels. The willingness  and, at the same time ,the lack of desire to commit to another person for reasons that are just not easy to understand. Unless you've been there. Everyone should invest time and see this.",1425859200,,353,4.786885245901639
1800953,1,B000075SNH,"It is difficult to imagine that this movie has accumulated a rating of 4-plus stars.  It is also difficult to fathom why an actor of Jill Clayburgh's ability would appear in such a movie.  The reviewers who comment about ""warming up"" to the principal characters don't seem to realize that these are two people in their 50s behaving like pre-teens, at best, and emotionally retarded, at worst.  The movie is a clumsy portrayal of people going through a mid-life crisis.  The blurb on the DVD cover promises the viewer will be ""laughing hysterically one minute while holding back your tears the next.""  Not a chance on either score.",1420329600,,630,4.796296296296297

Sharp humor, quick dialogue, amazing cast at their finest... What else could you ask for?? Rent it, buy it, whatever - just watch it! You'll love it. I'll definitely be seeing it again.",1408838400,,328,4.306451612903226

1800958,5,B000075SNH,"I had viewed this movie years ago & thought it was the funniest movie I'd ever watched. Couldn't stop laughing!! I had looked for it in video stores & at flea markets for years. Recently, it dawned on me that I could order it from Amazon. Ah, a love story that's light, romantic for the over 50's crowd, and humorous beyond words!! Should have been a best seller.",1388188800,,363,4.352941176470588
1800959,5,B000075SNH,One of the funniest scenes I have ever seen. Thoughtful feel good movie. We should all have friends like these people.,1380672000,,118,4.666666666666667
1800960,4,B000075SNH,"This film is a showcase for the late Jill Clayburgh who passed away in November of 2010 after a 21 year battle with leukemia. She is as good here as she was in her Oscar nominated performance in ""An Unmarried Woman"" . Highly recommended.",1358899200,,237,4.409090909090909
1800961,5,B000075SNH,"I have watched this movie twice a year for many years. It is a perfect ""pick me up"". It is a true gem. The characters are wonderfully portrayed and the movie could not be funnier. I have shown it for many ""girls nights' and it is always a big hit! For anyone who has ever lived in a big city, these situations ring true.",1325462400,,320,4.015625
1800962,5,B000075SNH,"Jill Clayburgh and Jeffrey Tambor deliver incredibly authentic performances in this romantic comedy that will ring true for most people who have endured a failed marriage and later worked up the courage to go all in on love again. It's one of those films where, if you've lived it, you'll probably love the story and the way it's scripted and acted, and if you haven't lived it you won't really get it.",1321660800,,402,4.597222222222222
1800963,4,B000075SNH,"This is an extremely funny and touching story about two middle-aged divorced people who have vowed not to fall in love again.  In touches on various aspects of fear of commitment and fear of getting hurt.  However, some of the most hilarious things happen in the course of their developing relationship.",1303171200,,303,4.921568627450981
1800964,5,B000075SNH,I've watched this 3 times and each time I howl with laughter. Great performances. Great script. Very naughty but tender. It gives us over 50's hope and a chance to laugh at ourselves.,1298160000,,183,4.575757575757576
1800965,5,B000075SNH,This was one of the best films i ever saw. I've watched it several times. Laughter is a great medicine.,1295481600,,103,4.2

Adult content.",1287014400,,87,4.5
1800967,5,B000075SNH,I laughed so hard I almost had an asthma attack.  It is for the 50 and over crowd.  It is what I would call Senior Citizen Porno.  Not for everyone.  It is also a romantic story about two people who find a real relationship.,1268179200,3,224,4.0227272727272725
1800968,5,B000075SNH,I received the movie very soon after ordering and am very happy with the service.,1265241600,,81,4.466666666666667
1800969,5,B000075SNH,"I fell asleep in the recliner while watching a t.v. movie, and woke to this marvelous, funny, belly laugh, movie.
I laughed until my sides ached and regretted that I missed the very first part of this movie.  So.......I simply had to have it.  It is definitely not for family viewing, but it is NOT a gross experience.  In fact, I almost fell out of the recliner laughing.  This movie is a must have.",1261180800,,400,4.364864864864865
1800970,5,B000075SNH,"What a great movie for the DVD collection!  If you've seen ""Never Again"" before, good for you!  If not, believe me, it's worth the time invested.  It grabs your heart (especially if you're over 40) and gives you hope that there is life after divorce or the death of a spouse.

If you don't have it, get it.  If you do have it, watch it again -- right now!",1256860800,,355,4.086956521739131
1800971,5,B000075SNH,"My husband and I turned this movie on halfway through and it was so weirdly heart touching we kept laughing and scratching our heads and I was sort of scared for them. I found myself rooting for them as seldom ever in a movie!!!!!!!!!!  And there reached a point where I thought my heart would break.  Then when she looks at the picture and goes back to 'the shop' I started jumping up and down and uproarishly laughing and laughing and couldn't stop....... It is SUCH a HUMAN movie and is so exileratingly happy to see......
I called our daughter to TRY to tell her about it and I was laughing so hard we decided to have us both look it up on Amazon to see if I had gone completely around the bend all by myself.  The first review I read was from the woman who had had hip surgery and laughed so hard she tore out some sitches...........  oh I'm so sorry she did that! but I knew I was not alone in valuing this incredible movie!!!  You have an incredible movie in store if you are reading this before watching.........AND join the group if you are like me looking for people who also loved it!!!!!
on another more 'critical' note - which can't even BE critical -----  I thought his mother, in the few scenes alloted to her, added the 'family depth' that made it more believable and I didn't even realize this until the movie was over and I had time to think instead of laughandcry......!",1254268800,,1389,4.323076923076923

1800974,3,B000075SNH,I was a little disappointed with the strong language but I realize it was a part of the character's lives. It made me laugh so hard and then cry too! It's never too late to find true love.,1250726400,,188,3.973684210526316
1800975,5,B000075SNH,This is a movie that you will laugh so hard you will cry.  Then there is a couple of sad scenes that you will cry.  I have watched this one 10 times.  Had my girlfriends over to watch it.,1246406400,,187,3.7435897435897436
1800976,5,B000075SNH,"Never Again works on a number of levels. It succeeds as a comedy, as well as a romantic love story.
The film features many funny, and sometimes profane moments.
As well, the language and dialogue is profane.
However, as much as you will laugh, you will also feel the connection and chemistry between the two leads!
This isn't for everyone's tastes...but this is a little gem well worth looking into!
Easily one of my favorite movies!",1236124800,,433,4.7105263157894735
1800977,5,B000075SNH,"So many romantic films are geared to the angst of high school audiences that it is refreshing to find one aimed at an aging group of Boomers.

In a nutshell, two lonely people searching for a casual relationship find one another and fall ""in love"".  Humor fills the movie. As adults out-of-sync with regular sex, they re-learn ways to interact and fulfill each other.  It is the honesty of the film--showing all the warts and wear of aging, the insecurities that plague us--that makes it stand out.

It is a great little movie set in NYC.  Highly recommended.",1232323200,2,559,4.663265306122449
1800978,5,B000075SNH,I haven't laughed that hard at a movie in years. Great for the over fifty crowd.,1229299200,2,80,4.0625
1800979,3,B000075SNH,"The movie starts and situation comedy is in the air..yuk. It's over acted and over dumb..BUT THEN.. it starts making sense, and we warmed up to the situation and the characters. Not a great movie at all, but pleasant enough.",1213574400,,224,4.625
1800980,5,B000075SNH,"From the perspective of a 40ish couple may I offer our views.  Funny, Funny, Funny!!!  Most people (including ourselves prior) 'never' heard of this movie but I'm here to tell you that it's a sleeper that ended up being one of our favs.  If the depiction of a 'toy' bothers you then this movie may not be for you, the prudish.  Or if you need your lead characters to be hotties for you to have fun, then this is not for you either.  It's about two intelligible middle-aged people trying to figure out how to date all over again, with hilarious consequences.  Many can relate I'm sure.

Highly recommended!!!",1192406400,3,607,4.513761467889908
1800981,4,B000075SNH,This movie is perfect for people in their 40ies and/or 50ies. It just hits the bullseye. Lean back and enjoy the ride.,1168300800,2,118,4.409090909090909
1800982,5,B000075SNH,"I remember seeing Jill Clayburgh in those wholesome romantic movies in the late 60s/early 70s. Boy, is this one different! The language would make a gang member blush! The scene when she wears the sex outfit, while answering the door, may be the funniest thing I have ever seen: I laugh my ass off!! Get this one!",1085443200,11,313,4.508771929824562
1800983,5,B000075SNH,"I'm very glad I found this film. But I almost didn't watch it because of the terrible song that accompanies the opening titles - a song that is totally out of synch with the style and mood of the rest of the film. And what a wonderful film it is. My wife and I have both been divorced twice and we sat nodding our heads throughout the film at its accuracy and honesty in dealing with tentative ""never again"" relationships. The performances by Jeffrey Tambor and Jill Clayburgh are terrific. Anyone who only knows Tambor from The Larry Sanders Show will be amazed by his subtlety and depth. The script and direction are near perfect - the dialogue is people talking like real people (albeit very witty real people). The film successfully blends great comic moments with honest emotions and human behavior. Highly recommended for anyone who has ever had a relationship break up or fall apart (that's pretty much all of us, isn't it?). The film offers hope without sugar-coated optimism. More importantly, it is also highly entertaining. I think I'll go watch it again...but with the sound off for the opening credits!",1081987200,27,1115,4.752577319587629
1800984,5,B000075SNH,"And if that doesnt cover it I don't know what will. Jill is great as usual.. they are all wonderful and what is the best thing of all is its not about teenagers. No killings, terminating or exterminating. Its not light - its intense without being anything about right on in feelings as well as well acted! Enjoy it!!We did.",1081036800,6,323,4.4
1800985,1,B000075SNH,"I an not a prude but I watched this movie after it was recommended by a friend. I watches this movie with a pretty liberal girlfriend and we both found it to be extremely vulgar and not even funny, with the exception of the fist scene. And the language was ridiculous and gross!
