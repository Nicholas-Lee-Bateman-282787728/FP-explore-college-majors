3966276,5,B002Q73R50,I purchased this DVD loved it! This DVD is very simple to understand. I would recommend it to any women who wants to learn to apply makeup but doesn't know where to start. Seeing each makeover step by step really makes you feel like you can achive the same results with a little practice no matter what your current skill level is! I really hope to see more DVD's from Sam Fine in the future.,1255824000,16,392,4.24
3966277,5,B002Q73R50,"I absolutely LOVE this DVD.  Sam Fine explained makeup where an everyday person can understand it and duplicate the techniques, PLUS he gave GREAT information and techniques that a makeup artist can take and use to enhance his/her career.  Who would've known what a facial tissue could do for a makeup job (you've gotta see this trick.  I was amazed)?  I watched my dvd today and tried some of the techniques tonight!  He made everything so easy to follow that I was able to duplicate the looks.  This video is a MUST HAVE for makeup artists and anybody wanting to wear makeup and wear it RIGHT!!!!  Thanks Sam Fine for sharing.  I really appreciate you!",1255651200,8,654,4.626086956521739

3966279,4,B002Q73R50,"I purchased this DVD because I already owned Sam Fine's book ""Fine Beauty"". The DVD is good and uses 3 models of different skin tones. It's not a fast paced, over-your-head DVD and Sam explains things with good detail. If you're looking to change your look or just learn a few techniques to enhance your look, then this is a good DVD to own!",1313366400,,341,4.34375
3966280,5,B002Q73R50,"I received this dvd very quickly, so that's a plus. After watching, it is a basic how to guide, so if you have the basics down pack its nice to see a professional's style of the basics. I did learn a few new tips that have made a big difference, such as setting brow pencils with powder & the impact of bronzers. Using both a bronzer and blush has give my cheeks a POW factor!",1310515200,,376,4.026666666666666
3966281,5,B002Q73R50,I love this video. Very informative and easy to follow. Tips are fantastic. It's like having your own personal makeup artist.,1306886400,,125,5.0
3966282,5,B002Q73R50,"Very good explanations are given and repeated. Its a video that anyone can follow. It is basic as the title states and opened my mind to wanting to try/experiment more and practice practice practice. I watch it over and over and greatly anticipate  the next video. I thought I knew nothing about makeup and unsuspectingly was able to give a complete 45min makeup lesson to a guest at school just because of what I learned from this dvd. That day I went from not being confident enough to teach on or sell skin care and makeup product to retailing over $450 in 3 days (avg per ticket $60+) because now I incorporate skin and makeup knowledge into haircare confidently. Thanks Sam!

3966285,5,B002Q73R50,"I was so impressed with this DVD that I sent Sam Fine this message through his website:

Dear Sam:
I recently purchased you DVD from Amazon and wanted to say THANK YOU for sharing your knowledge. Makeup can be so complicated, but your delivery was easy to understand and I appreciate you explaining the function of each applicator and how to choose the correct foundation, shade, bronzer, etc. I personally love makeup that looks flawless and natural. I hate going to the makeup counter in the mall and walking away looking like a clown. That is definitely not me!!! So thank you for showing aspiring artists and regular wearers how to apply makeup fit for the average, professional woman of color.

I'm looking forward to watching this DVD over and over and over again!!! May God continue to bless you and your business.

3966288,5,B002Q73R50,"I was surfing youtube vidoes for makeup looks I can do myself. The trouble I was having was finding makeup that looks good on my skin tone because most of the looks were done by and on white/pale skin, not women of color. This video gives a good list of brushes or tools needed to get good results. Sam Fine goes into depth about the use and importance of each brush/tool. He does 3 different makeovers on 3 different women of different ages, skin tones, and facial issues. He gives great tips that can be put to practice right away. He, however, doesn't promote any makeup lines/brands. I wish he had given tips on what works best on the different types of skin because I have oily skin and I am always looking for products that work best for reducing oil and maintaining clear skin. I look forward to more makeup tutorials using color from him. He truly is a master at his craft. This video is a must have for beginners and seasoned makeup users.",1296691200,5,948,4.392045454545454

I can respect bolder makeup applications but I prefer more subtle and natural applications that can enhance ones beauty. The basics of beauty more than accomplishes the art of beauty makeup. I also liked that you didn't endorse or promote any one product line. Im guilty of always running to the mac counter but as I have found there are other products out there that are as equally good as mac. Overall the dvd was very educational, Keep up the good work!!!",1296172800,,606,4.568807339449541
3966292,5,B002Q73R50,"I finally received Sam Fine ""The Basics of Beauty"" DVD and it was well worth the wait. I have been wanting this DVD since hearing about Sam talk about on his Twitter [...]  If you don't know who Sam Fine is then your are missing out. He has worked with Iman, Jennifer Hudson,Vanessa Williams, Tyra Banks and Queen Latifah just to name a few. Sam starts off by showing the tools he uses and their purposes and the maintenance of them. Then Sam does three individual looks on real women not models ! I really like that he picked ordinary women instead of the usual models I feel like I can relate to these women.  He uses women in their 20s, 30s, and 40s with different skin tones .You will want to try all these looks immediately after watching them.. I know I did ! I like how he talks to you as if your there with him going step-by-step. The pop up tips that appear during his demonstrations on the women were very helpful. The before and after transformations on the women are just simply amazing. Make sure to check out the special features. It includes a interview with Mr. Fine, behind the scenes with him and Iman and the making of the dvd. Keep in mind this dvd is perfect for learning the "" basics "" of makeup some people may think its not long enough or he does not do enough looks but that wasn't the case for me. I learned the things I needed to know especially being a women of color. This dvd is a must for every makeup beginner like me.",1296172800,,1450,4.231046931407942

3966295,5,B002Q73R50,"When I purchased this DVD I was skeptical because it was called ""the basics of beauty"" I thought I knew the basics but this DVD showed some great tips and tricks that people don't think of when it cones to going back to basics. I love this DVD and Sam makes the tips easy to follow and hopefully the rumors about a part two are true!!'",1285372800,,335,4.090909090909091

Throughout the video, Sam maintains a light instructional tone, using direct language and simple terms to deliver clear and precise instructions. It is a GREAT beginners guide!!! He explains everything in such a way that EVERYONE will benefit and gain from his knowledge.  It's like having Sam Fine (with his MEGA WATT smile) in your own living room ANYTIME!!!  If you own only one make-up DVD, this should be it.  Don't forget to check the other features on the DVD, it gives you a glimpse of the man behind the name!",1285200000,3,690,4.781512605042017

3966298,3,B002Q73R50,I returned this dvd because it was too basic and for the price I was hoping for more. Instead of doing 3 day time/basic look on each women he should have done a different look (day/night/special/glamour) on each one.,1281312000,9,216,4.564102564102564
3966299,4,B002Q73R50,"the video was good.  I only learned one new trick that I didn't learn @ makeup artist school.  I would have liked to have seen him doing a face with more variety of color, maybe some blues, pinks, purples, greens, yellows.  He stuck to neutrals & neutrals are safe.  Yes, I know ladies, he likes a more natural face as he stated. Still wished for more.",1280966400,,352,4.287878787878788

This past week, three people said, ""wow"" I like your makeup.  I am using the same makeup with a few tweaks using the advice from the DVD.

3966302,5,B002Q73R50,"This is the premiere makeup instructional DVD for women of color and just women overall. I bought this DVD expecting much as I've heard many great things about Sam Fine. Let me say that what I expected was nothing in comparison to the above and beyond instruction that I received. This DVD covers everything from the basics to the complex. Especially for a makeup novice like myself. I truly appreciate the gradual increase of complexity in the film that, for me, allows me to choose what I want to do for that day or occasion. If I want everyday makeup coverage, start at makeup model #1 and move up to makeup model #3 for a night out with the girls. Also, the Special Features are great as you get an inside look at the man, his art and his journey. It's very inspirational.
Sam, you did it again! First success with the book, ""Fine: The Basics of Beauty"" and now the DVD. One way to describe this DVD and man: Necessary! Thanks so much! We, women, truly appreciate your help! BUY IT LADIES (and men, if this is your thang!) You definitely won't regret it!",1280102400,,1058,4.430769230769231

of technique is simple enough for the new artist as well as the veteran.
His video is not limited to professionals in fact the thing I love about Sam is he wants the everyday makeup user to be as comfortable with makeup as a pro.
With this video you can learn to look your very best with ease and confidence.
Buy two or three they make great gifts, who wouldnt want private makeup lessons from Sam Fine in their own home and this is the way to get one from one of the

something useful.",1270425600,,202,4.45945945945946
3966309,5,B002Q73R50,"Sam Fine has mastered ""The Basics of Beauty! There are so many great things I could say about this DVD! First, Sam has managed to convince even a make-up novice like me that I should no longer be intimated by cosmetics!  I learned more in the past 45-minutes than I have in the past 15 years about how to apply make-up.  I now understand how to shape my brows, to apply eye shadow, to place bronzer, and to line my lips **like a professional would.**  It's amazing!

I highly recommend this video to any beginner!  Sam is incredibly patient, clear, and thorough in all of his explanations, and the superb videography allows you to see his work unfold step-by-step.  It's also quite helpful that he shows three successive makeovers, since the repetition reinforces the lesson and allows everything to really sink in.  I also appreciate that ""women of color"" (I hate that term, but Sam uses it so I will) are the focus of this video and not an afterthought.  I was so happy to see that Sam intentionally took the time to work with women of three different complexions (though it would have been better if he'd chosen a truly dark-skinned woman for the third makeover) to bring out the natural beauty in each one.

In short, this video is definitely a keeper!  I had been planning to buy a make-up book like Aucoin's ""Making Faces"" or even Fine's ""Beauty Basics"", but I think the DVD is so much more helpful.  The comprehensive verbal explanations accompanied by compelling visuals gives me so much more than I could get from two-dimensional print.  I truly have learned the ""basics of beauty"", and I'm excited to practice my new skills on myself and others!",1269907200,,1655,4.63013698630137
3966310,4,B002Q73R50,"good dvd. i just wanted more.  when Sam title it 'basics,' he meant just that. there were a lot of useful tips. i wish he would have done more makeovers because there are so many different eyes shapes.  also wish he would have used more colors.  maybe he'll do that on the next dvd. anywhoo, its a great buy!",1268611200,,308,4.186440677966102
3966311,5,B002Q73R50,"I loved this DVD.  It takes through basic steps to help you achieve a basic more natural look and then by the third girl it's a more glamourous look.  I love how he repeats the first steps with each application so we get the basics down pact.  All in all I finished the dvd and felt like it helped me build on what I know.  However, even if I had never worn makeup before, I think it would definiately help a novice too.",1268179200,,420,4.024096385542169

Sam Fine begins the video by giving an overview of the tools of the trade. Tools alone make a big difference in the final result. From there, he shows how he blends makeup along the jaw line and to conceal under eye circles. What a revelation that no one should use one color all over their face. There are varying tones in each beautiful face so use a few colors to capture your natural beauty. My husband bought me this DVD for Christmas and I'll never forget it. I couldn't imagine a better gift. Sam's professional tips helped me take my look to the next level. His DVD is a MUST HAVE and worth EVERY penny!",1264204800,,743,4.13103448275862

Also, encounters with most department store makeup counters have left me less than pleased.  This DVD, however, is wonderful in its step-by-step approach for young and mature women.  Fine demonstrates makeup techniques for minimizing imperfections.  Additionally, the techniques demonstrated are for those who want minimal makeup and those who want their makeup to appear minimal.  This DVD is worth the money.",1263772800,,572,5.0212765957446805
3966316,5,B002Q73R50,"This is by far the best when it comes to explaining makeup application techniques.  It's very clear and easy to follow.

Amazing!",1263686400,,326,4.568965517241379
3966317,4,B002Q73R50,"I just rec'd this DVD and watched it last night.  I feel it was definitely worth the price and gives basic instructions for makeup application.  I was happy that he validated some things that I had figured out on my own, like blending and using more than one shade of foundation to match skin tone.  My only concern with this video is that I felt he didn't go dark enough.  Maybe it was the lighting but there are still women that have very deep brown skin that need a little help.  Also he didn't talk about adjusting makeup application as skin and features age.",1263254400,3,563,4.375
3966318,3,B002Q73R50,"I think this is a decent make up guide, but for the price, I was hoping for more. He goes over make up tips using 3 women and builds on techniques with each one. This is good information to have but *very* basic.",1261612800,4,212,3.953488372093023

He is a wonderful make up artist and you can see and feel the passion he has for his work in all of his work.  Knowing this, I knew this was going to be a well thought out, classy, very educational, uplifting dvd.  I know the extremes that make up can go to, but he keeps it simple and beautiful.  To the point.  Let's you know what make up is truely for. Despite if you are just curious as to the ways you can try make up, or if you are an artist, watching one of the true icons of make up for women of color is great. And the style of the dvd is beautiful.",1258934400,,678,3.869565217391304
3966322,5,B002Q73R50,"This is most definitely a tutorial, though it doesn't feel like one.  Its almost like being on a job with him as he explains his technique while he works.  Very conversational and intimate.  Sam Fine covers the importance of having a good set of BASIC tools (brushes, sponges, etc) and how to use them /take care of them.  Then he stresses the importance of having a flawless canvas and how to achieve it without looking overly made up.  Women of color do not have to be afraid of using concealer, he shows how.  I love how he addresses the multiple tones that we usually have in our skin and how to unify those tones.  The pop-up tips are super helpful as he's speaking and he goes over several basic steps in all of the makeovers to make it easy to remember.

People who are looking for a very ""made up"" look or exaggerated eyeshadow looks will need to look elsewhere.  He concentrates on very basic, natural looks and then you are free to build from there.

This DVD was everything that I expected from Sam Fine.  I appreciate a product specifically targeted to women of color and our specific needs.  I expect there will be another DVD that shows you how to punch up your looks but anyone should be able to master a flawless, finished basic makeup look after watching this DVD a few times.",1258934400,21,1293,4.432203389830509

You are truly blessed and talented!! Thanks again and congratulations on your first of many instructional DVDs!!,1257724800,,406,4.985294117647059
3966327,5,B002Q73R50,"The Video, my goodness is a MUST HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION NEXT TO HIS BOOK..I love how his makeup is timeless.... Okay when I first put it in, I decided that I would approach it as a novice who knew nothing about makeup so that I could really benefit from all that Sam had to say and benefit I did. I really first of all can truly appreciate the spirit of EXCELLENCE that was exemplified throughout the video. First of all it was in HD..woo hoo. He had great cameras and a crew of at least 100 folk (lol) and it looked like no expense was spared (well at least that's what came across to me). It was done in excellent taste and CLASS!!! so I am grateful that he put out a great quality product. I can tell he is a "" if it aint right don't do it"", kind of man.

I love how he approached a natural look because a lot of women of color are scared of makeup.. He didn't promote products and that made me as an artist feel good knowing that I can use whatever is in my kit that was similar to his. He also loves to use oranges and brown colors on woman of color cheeks because it looks more natural.

I will no longer approach a woman the same again when she request a natural look. I am now going to invest in a some nice tweezers and put the razor down. I always use the razor because it's quick and I do a good job but the tweezing is better and I just have to get my clients to be okay with it. I love that he didn't promote any products per sey because it makes me feel more comfy using the products I have that are similar to his. All in All I am walking away with more confidence to service my clients 10 times better after viewing your video. MUAH..much love and appreciation to you my brother.

3966328,5,B002Q73R50,"Sam Fine really delivers with this DVD!  It is so exciting to watch him go step by step with each makeover and then I have the opportunity to duplicate the techniques for myself.  I have learned so much from watching this and I have already gotten compliments on my new and improved look.  I've purchased several of these DVDs to give to my closest friends for Christmas.  When you find something this good, you just have to share!

Watching this DVD is like having your own personal make-up class with Sam.  I'd say it's required viewing for all women who want to put their best face forward and I hope it's the first of many DVDs we'll see from Sam.  Thank you Sam for giving all of us the opportunity to learn from the best!",1255910400,6,727,4.340740740740741
8377512,5,B002Q73R50,"To this day, this is the best book created for makeup application, for the rooky or seasoned artist.  Or maybe just for self application.  When I started in the business, I saw Sam on Oprah and I got the book immediately!  I have this book 20 years later and I reference it from time to time.  I go in and out of doing makeup so when I need to refresh, I look to this book.",1464048000,,373,3.933333333333333

If you want a natural everyday look  with a few additional strokes to go dramatic for the evening, please purchase this DVD!!",1395792000,,201,4.4324324324324325
8377516,5,B002Q73R50,This book is a great teaching book. It is also a good read. It teaches great technique for applying makeup.,1391817600,,107,4.4
8377517,2,B002Q73R50,Was a waste of money for me I guess because I already knew most of what he was trying to teach.  I bought the cd thinking that I would learn something new.  One thing that pissed me off like it always does is how people always use women that already have flawless skin or maybe one or two small ass blimishes. To me you aint s*** until you can cover up some acne prone skin or someone with some flaws you can actually see.,1371168000,3,422,4.011904761904762
8377518,1,B002Q73R50,HMMMM..THIS VIDEO WAS JUST OK!!! I REALLY LOVE AND ADORE SAM FINE AS A MAKE UP ARTISTY...BUT THIS DVD REALLY LET ME DOWN.I WAS ONLINE SEARCHING NIGHT AND DAY FOR THIS DVD AND COULDN'T WAIT UNTIL IT CAME OUT.I'VE HAVE HAD IT FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW AND I HAVE WATCH IT THREE TIMES BUT LET'S FACE IT...IT BORING!!!!! SAM BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND WATCH YOUR GIRLFRIENDS DVD.,1330214400,,386,4.375

8377520,3,B002Q73R50,The Reason why I would not recommend this DVD is Because Sam doesnt tell you what item company he is using.example if someone is teaching you how to make bugers and don't telll you what meat to buy how would you know.sam used plastic containers just so you wouldnt know what item he is using.that suck cause even if i follow hes steps my makeup will not look like hes because iam not using the correct powder.i found youtube make up more detail then this DVD.,1314230400,2,459,4.348837209302325
8377521,5,B002Q73R50,"I learned everything I know about make up application from the ""Fine Beauty"" book published a few years ago. This dvd is fabulous as it is awesome to see the artist at work to really understand the techniques described in the book.  The dvd features three makeovers from start to finish: a barely there foundation free application, a liquid foundation application and a cream foundation application.  As each look is shown in its entirety the steps are repeated which some may find annoying but I found that the repetition served to solidify my understanding also when replaying  the dvd you can select the look you want to replicate and receive all the necessary instruction and steps.  The only criticism I have is why did we have to wait this long to have access to this incredible resource.  I can wait until tomorrow to practise!  I hope Mr Fine releases further tutorials for more dramatic looks for us wannabe divas as the looks featured in this dvd were more classic / natural looks .

ps I reccomend purchasing the book Fine Beauty for a more comprehensive understanding of make up application.",1313798400,,1103,4.773684210526316
