8243100,4,B0011Z5NKU,"The description says this, but let me emphasize this is NOT HANDS ON MASSAGE, but touch or energy therapy somewhat based on Therapeutic Touch. Therapeutic touch is a more involved energy healing technique started in the US by Dolores Kreiger, RN and PH.D (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Accepting-Your-Power-to-Heal-The-Personal-Practice-of-Therapeutic-Touch/dp/1879181045/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Accepting Your Power to Heal: The Personal Practice of Therapeutic Touch</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Therapeutic-Touch-How-to-Use-Your-Hands-to-Help-or-to-Heal/dp/067176537X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Therapeutic Touch: How to Use Your Hands to Help or to Heal</a>). She observed the healing practices of a clairvoyant named Dora Kunz (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Spiritual-Dimension-of-Therapeutic-Touch/dp/1591430259/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Spiritual Dimension of Therapeutic Touch</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Personal-Aura/dp/8178220733/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Personal Aura</a>) and developed Therapeutic Touch methods. As energy/touch healing has been used for centuries in cultures all around the world (I am sure cavemen found touch was healing) I can't say these practices are actually anything new, but Dolores Krieger and others helped introduce these techniques as complementary health care into western medical practices. In Hawaii, I do volunteer touch healing in our local hospitals and they have been used successfully for 20 years.

The technique is similar to a basic Reiki session. The DVD starts with a brief explanation of an updated version of Therapeutic Touch then Michelle Kluck demonstrates the technique starting off with centering and calling in universal energy. She demonstrates sensing energy by passing your hands near the client and explains what to look for. Then she places her hands in specific locations on the client, re-assesses the energy and finishes the treatment. My qualms with this DVD are that there is no grounding and clearing/cleansing technique offered. Personally I feel grounding and cleansing/clearing should be demonstrated and practiced. Some people are sensitive and pick up energies from others and energies should not be transferred from client to client. Also the DVD doesn't explain what to do if you or don't sense energy. I know some people don't sense energy and while do sense energy after practicing awhile, I know some people who have practiced energy healing for years and still don't feel energy. As a short introduction and demonstration it serves its purpose and Michelle Kluck is a pleasant narrator. The production values were also nice and so the DVD could serve as a starting demonstration for home or massage practitioners who want to do something additional to their traditional massage technique. The DVD runs 30 minutes and is packaged in environmentally friendly non plastic DVD box.",1307577600,8,3064,6.698492462311558
