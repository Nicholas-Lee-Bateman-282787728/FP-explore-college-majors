4334725,1,B004DTNUTC,"Just wanted to confirm what others have said.  Last part of the 1st quarter is missing.  I returned it, got the replacement and it's the same thing.  Amazon needs to discontinue this product until the mananufacturer re-authors the DVD correctly.",1299196800,2,245,5.075
4334726,1,B004DTNUTC,"20:23 into presentation the DVD stops.  This is at the 3:42 mark of 1st quarter.  It skips a touchdown by both teams.  I sent back the two dvd's in the original order.  Just received my replacements and YES...these have the same issue.

You should wait for the new shipment of DVD's before ordering.",1299024000,,299,4.566037735849057
4334727,1,B004DTNUTC,I sat down to watch the 2011 Rose Bowl dvd that I purchased and the last 3:42 of the first quarter is missing.  The dvd just stops working completely.  I tried playing the disc in 2 different players thinking it might be the player but its the dvd.  I have not watched any more of the game but I will assume that my dvd has the same problems the other buyers noted before my review.  I would have to agree with the reviews posted before mine.  I would like another disc that doesnt skip out on any of the game.,1298851200,2,510,4.06
4334728,1,B004DTNUTC,This video is missing roughly the last 3:30 of the first quarter!! It cuts off when its 7-3 TCU and the Badgers are inside the five yard line. The second quarter starts and its 14-10! Anyone who ordered this and has this kind of copy should get a FREE update of the ENTIRE GAME!!,1298592000,,279,4.185185185185185
4334729,1,B004DTNUTC,"This 2011 Rose Bowl DVD is ruinously flawed. The first quarter of the game is missing the final 3 minutes and 49 seconds and jumps to the second quarter with the score changing from 7-3 to 14-10, so the viewer completely misses one touchdown and one field goal.  There is no physical damage to the disk (no scratches, abrasions or smudges), so the problem must have been human (i.e., production) error.  This product should be recalled and new disks produced and distributed. What a mess.",1298505600,5,488,4.729411764705882

8426133,5,B004DTNUTC,"They must have fixed the missing segment and playback problems reported by earlier reviewers. I had no problems with the playback or missing segments at all. Very good video.

And an absolutely great game.... again!",1387497600,,215,5.142857142857143
8426134,5,B004DTNUTC,"I had this game recorded on my DVR, but changed providers.  This was the high point of the TCU football success (to date) and I was there in person to see it.",1380153600,,158,3.9375
8426135,2,B004DTNUTC,"And the reason Amazon has not contacted buyers of this dvd is.....well perhaps lazy is the reason.  I inquired and got nothing back at all....
Really...that hard to answer a question?",1311206400,,183,4.903225806451613
8426136,1,B004DTNUTC,"I have the same issue as every other reviewer.  The final 3:49 of the first quarter is ""missing"" from this DVD.  Yes...two scores are ""lost"".  I would give this DVD a ""no stars"" if it were possible.  Amazon needs to have this corrected.",1303603200,4,236,4.4186046511627906
8426137,1,B004DTNUTC,"When the first DVD didn't work properly, we returned it and ordered a replacement.  The new DVD did the exact same thing, (couldn't see the end of the first and second quarter.)  We got a refund.",1301443200,2,195,4.388888888888889
8426138,1,B004DTNUTC,"Poorly made, quality assuarance must be none existent; the end of the first quarter is missing an on side kick and a TCU score, other parts of the game just skip to a different quarter or another part of the game instantly with no notice. I was at this Rose Bowl and I bought this as a momento and, of course, I waited too long to watch the DVD, the return time had passed.",1301184000,2,373,4.054054054054054
