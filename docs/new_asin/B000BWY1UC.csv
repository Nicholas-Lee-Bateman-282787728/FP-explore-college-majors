8093615,5,B000BWY1UC,"This is a relatively short tape that covers a lot of great information for an individual that wants to begin fly fishing. Set in a natural setting with well articulated instruction by a local doctor who appears to have an ease in relating his fly fishing skills to the viewer. I've been fishing for 20 plus years , this was one of my favorite tapes I used to learn how to fish for trout using a fly rod. The information I gleaned from it over 20 years ago still echoes in my mind . The script moves along nicely with several fish caught with some nice scenery of a classic western trout stream. I still enjoy putting this tape in my VCR to watch when the weather is too cold to fish for the pure sake of seeing trout caught on a fly. If you are seeking a good primer to break into fly fishing I would highly recommend this bargin tape. It is not over whelming and will give you all the information to get started catching trout .",1354320000,,929,4.166666666666667
