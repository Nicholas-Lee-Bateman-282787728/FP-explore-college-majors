8735323,4,B0160VUZSY,"My sister and I are big fans of the Youkai Watch series, and were really excited to find the first movie available on a regionless DVD. The movie took about a month to arrive, and was well worth it
When you turn it on, the DVD menu is in English, so it was very easy to navigate. The movie is only in Japanese and Cantonese, but there are English subtitles.
American fans are introduced to the Japanese-exclusive character, Fuyunyan, and it is pretty hard not to like him. The movie was very silly, and had the young kids we watched this with cracking up.
Young children may have a hard time following the subtitles, especially because occasionally there are grammatical or spelling errors. Parents may also want to know there are a few uses of the ""d-word"" in the second half of the film.",1463356800,2,789,4.486111111111111
