3856805,1,B0026RLMAW,"I must admit, I have no more tolerance for this ridiculous show. I watched the first season and most of the second, and finally threw up my hands and threw in the towel. This is maybe the only paranormal show where...nothing paranormal happens...ever. Instead, this motley team of ""investigators"" walk around, attribute every single noise to a ghost...hold seances or even more outrageous, exorcisms...yes...exorcisms...and then act as if they accomplished something. Although I did not watch past season 2, it is fair to say there was never an EVP, no visual evidence, nothing that can be linked to a paranormal experience, aside from the claims made by the people visited, those who claim to be haunted to begin with. I laugh at the beginning of each episode ...""sometimes, we're WARRIORS"". Oh, really? And what exactly are you fighting? One nice example, is the Mothman episode, were team leader Ryan said that both UFO's and Bigfoot had been DEBUNKED to his satisfaction, but, not Mothman...yes...he did say that. What a howler. This show must be comedy. It must be.",1264982400,9,1070,5.01685393258427

3856807,2,B0026RLMAW,"This show is good for comic value as you paddle the murky waters of cable TV.  Ryan Buell, who formed the Paranormal Research Society at Penn State earlier in the decade, leads a team of professional 'paranormal investigators' who provide cable fodder and are likely influencing the next generation of 'paranormal investigators' to forego real disciplines and get in on the action.

This collects the third season of the A&E series (shame on you, A&E), where the team investigates another crop of hauntings and possessions and spookings.  This time, it's hanging out in abandoned church basements, travelling to Kentucky where yet another rube is having trouble with a pesky horned person or creature, and other fun trips to random locations where people who really want to believe are brought face-to-face with the people who will validate their wants.

The show is plain funny.  The 'paranormal activity' they claim to capture is utter baloney.  There is no believable evidence on the show, because most everything is open to editing and manipulation, all in between the commercials (not included here).  The scary music, the night-vision video cams, the electronic voice thingies, and the habitual 'let's go to the basement or attic' (because that's where this stuff has to happen) is shameless and predictable.  In fact, I have to just give credit to them for being able to a) stretch this formula out to multiple seasons and b) being able to hold the laughter in.  Also, these charlatans are pretty well-equipped, so we get to learn about cool gadgets.

What's missing from this box set are the outtakes where the team members burst out laughing whenever someone utters phrases like, ""Is there someone here with us?"" or ""Can you reveal your presence to me?""  One begs for a ghostly display of flatulence to answer these plaintive questions, but alas, such activity is never captured.  What is captured is the occasional unaccounted-for moan, the squeaky door, or the rumblings of a cesspool mistaken for evidence of hauntings...the kind of hauntings that seem to multiply in direct correlation with the number of digital cameras and electronic voice doo-hickeys in the area.  One troubling aspect of the show is the continuous suggestions put into people's minds that their home is really haunted, or that they may really have some kind of paranormal ability or vision.  Guaranteed to be used by some kids for years to come as a why-I-didn't-do-my-homework excuse.

The recent film Paranormal Activity is a much more succinct effort to spook audiences, with its 'found video' quality purporting to show footage of a couple who set up cameras in their home to capture late-night 'paranormal activity'.  Entirely fiction, and not entirely satisfying, it's a better effort than this show.  A&E has once again proven that they have no shame, and no standards, but following the jaw-dropping Growing Up Gotti series, you probably already knew that.",1260921600,6,2948,5.095634095634096

3856810,4,B0026RLMAW,"By season three, you can see how the team have grown and developed with a more mature and professional approach. They seem more polished and assured. Paranormal State fans will enjoy this DVD as a step further along their search for answers. The episodes in this collection are more involved and hold your attention.",1257724800,3,316,4.87037037037037
3856811,2,B0026RLMAW,"Don't get me wrong, for all of my complaints about PRS, they really do seem to mean well in their endeavors. They want to help families who say they are haunted by spirits. Despite Ryan Buell's rather wooden screen presence, I really do think he just wants to help.

My problem with them, though, is that they fall into the trap of saying that EVERY house is haunted and that EVERY noise/feeling was caused by a ghost. This is simply absurd. The team walks into the supposedly haunted building and stalks around for a bit gathering no genuine evidence that something is going on before turning (typically) to a psychic. The psychic gives their impressions which the team takes as fact and then they sit around in the dark for an hour or so creeping themselves out before they banish/exorcise/free the spirits.

I find this a bit absurd because (as any paranormal investigator/ghost hunter worth his salt will tell you) not every house is haunted and not even the best psychics are on 100% of the time. It's because of this that I'm forced to sit there frustrated that the team breezes through investigations like amateurs doing things for the first time. They walk away feeling better and often making the family feel better... but they have never proven in the slightest that there was even a ghost in the house. Not one strange picture or one discernible EVP. Attempts to use other machines like the Franks Box give them ""answers"" that any slightly skeptical person would chalk up to the fact they're picking up radio clips on the machine (which they even state up front) and would explain why the ""voices"" stopped when the venture into the basement (where reception would be the worst).

I give them points for wanting people to feel more at ease in their homes, but I think they may only be giving the people a placebo. The people believe the ghost is gone so they feel better. But if a ghost is not the problem (or it hasn't really been exorcised/banished/set free)then it will only return and they'll go through the whole problem again. Not even the best ghost hunter can stop a ghost that's really a banging pipe or EMF bleed off from a junction box in the basement. But PRS never even thinks to investigate those things before jumping to the conclusion that the house is in fact haunted.",1254787200,5,2295,4.6339066339066335
3856812,5,B0026RLMAW,"If your interested in the paranormal, this series will not let you down.
The various cases are interesting, Buell & his cast actually have screen presence by just being themselves, and the outcome of each episode is not always predictable.
I've viewed Ghost Adventures & Ghost Hunters, and similar themed programs, yet none have the overall appeal this series consistently offers.

3856816,5,B0026RLMAW,"I've been a big fan since the first Season aired on TV back in 2007. Then a few years later I was able to watch and view all season on Netflix in 2010 but I never had a chance to watch Season 5 until now in 2015 on Amazon stream.  I'm a big fan and really like the documentary show with the characters (original Pen State team) and all their interesting paranormal cases, but now that I finally had the chance to watched all of Season 5, I was extremely disappointed in (Episode 21 ""If I Should Die"") with the New Class/ new Pen State team. None of them look like or sounded like they had any kind of paranormal experience, or they didn't even provided any kind of entertaining value.  Thank god A&E did not produce another season with the New Pen State team.  Please bring back the original team, please add a new season starting in 2015 or 2016.

Ryan is interesting in a cute-and-serious sort of way, though he's a little intense in his pursuits. Chip was a favorite, just because he has a manner that makes him so watchable. It's not a bad show but, after a while, it feels like a formula. If you like creepy, this is just creepy enough.

3856838,5,B0026RLMAW,"Reading a lot of crap on this series maken me want to type my own review.
I'm from Holland but I saw a lot of ghosthunting series, English and American, and this is by far the best: not sensational, honest, serieus people, working with integrity and genuinly caring for the people that call in their help. Good mediums too, and thank God no debunkers on the scene to 'enliven' the series.
I read Ryan's book, which confirms it all.
It's a shame many people seem to like the screaming and idiotic 'panic' which is associated with many other ghosthunting groups. Talking about dishonesty !
For the few intelligent people not interested in sensation but in facts, this series is something to buy and watch several times. Can't wait for season 5.",1289952000,,742,4.67175572519084
3856839,1,B0026RLMAW,"Before you buy this I suggest doing the following:

1.  Google ""Paranormal State fraud"" and/or ""Chip Coffey fraud"" and just research for a few minutes the many hits that will come up.

2.  Read about the two former clients that have come forward with claims of fraud Episodes ""The Messenger"" and ""Hell House"" I believe.  One of their former clients is a self proclaimed psychic.  However before you dismiss her complaints as trying to get ""15 minutes more of fame"" read the whole story.  She was one of the clients in a episode called "" The Messenger"".

This episode had so much evidence that was, let's just say, unfavorable to PRS's credibility that this episode, despite been listed by Amazon as being on the second DVD of Season Two, had been removed from the DVD and you will NOT find it anywhere on Season Two.  The unhappy client posted small parts of that episode on YouTube.  All the posts were quickly removed for ""legal reasons"", despite the fact that other episodes on YouTube have not been as closely guarded by the producers of PRS.

3.  A lot of evidence (to say the least) has surfaced showing that Chip Coffey is briefed well in advance and in great detail by the producers about all the facts on the cases before every showing up on the set.  These are the exact same facts he will later use his ""psychic"" powers to sense.

4.  If you search the IMDB website on Chip Coffey, you will find out that he is, and has been, a professional actor all of his life.

5.  An entire website has been devoted to exposing PRS as frauds, using their own EVP's and video footage.  I cannot list the link here, however if you look up Paranormal State in Wikipedia you will find the site that has captured all of this shows frauds in the references section on Paranormal State.

Hope this helps.

3856840,1,B0026RLMAW,"These guys are by far the worst paranormal investigators. Each show consists of nonsense stories and crap evidence.  In fact, the only evidence they have is 'oh, I'm hearing noises and feel cold, blah blah blah'.  Don't waste your money on these dvds. The main guy doesn't know what he is talking about, and the rest are just kids with high tech toys. Buy Ghost Adventures, it's by far the best show out there and they provide credible evidence. Just a side note... I remember one episode where they think they have a demon in their presence. The main moron then states that 'its dangerous to even say aloud the name of this entity' because of how evil it is. That being said, for something so dangerous, they flash the name of the demon on the tv numerous times during the episode. Come on!! For something so evil, you flash it on the tv screen for the viewers at home?

I've been watching Ghost Hunters (via satellite and in the States) from almost the very beginning. I've now seen the original programs and have read the books of Jason and Grant too. I have to say that I believe that ghosts may exist, but I want some kind of evidence. Some kind of proof. These investigators -- and their paranormal investigation team -- work on the same premise. They attempt to ""debunk"" paranormal claims, but when they gather evidence that is hard to ""debunk"" or ""dispute,"" they are left with evidence that may actually support life after death (i.e., ghost, paranormal activity).

While Ghost Hunters works with a scientific leaning by utilizing technical equipment from EMF meters / K2 meters, digital thermometers, night vision cameras and thermal sensor equipment, etc., other paranormal programs utilize spirit mediums and the like. While I do not discount psychic mediums and sensitives, their evidence is hard to prove or ""debunk."" Nevertheless, programs like ""Paranormal State"" and ""Paranormal Cops"" (broadcast on A&E) have their place as well. They are certainly interesting. Psychic mediums like John Edward and Chip Coffee are quite interesting. In fact, I've been watching John Edward for many years. He's gotten a bit ""mushy"" as of late (even for WE) -- his original program on SyFy used to display his medium abilities more readily. In short, more readings.

""Paranormal State"" also leans a little bit too much, perhaps, on Catholicism, but I love the protection chant: ""The Light of God Surrounds Us. The Love of God Enfolds Us. The Power of God Protects Us."" It's a great mantra!!!

Writers and psychic researchers like Peter Cayce are also quite interesting. Peter Cayce utilizes Science, Philosophy and Religion to come up with explanations for the afterlife and reincarnation and Karma. Interesting material.

In any case, the paranormal field is an interesting one. I'd really like to see more programs about legitimate psychics and paranormal investigators like Ghost Hunters, John Edward and Peter Cayce.

3856844,1,B0026RLMAW,"I love a good ghost series, but Paranormal State doesn't belong in that category: It is slapstick. It's an embarrassment.

As another reviewer stated, the kiddie warriors in this series never really find anything. They just make a lot of scary oooo's and ahhhhh's and then they go home.

And what happened to Chip the Psychic in this season? Did he fall on his head and become Chip the DumDum Clown? Hey Chip: Give it a rest. You're trying too hard. We can see that you are seriously studying the body language of the people you're talking to, looking for cues to see if you're hot or cold. You are not psychic: You are an actor...a hammy actor.

And why do the warriors usually opt for the goofiest case studies they can find? Why do they opt for spirit-board types who probably charm snakes and speak ""in tongues"" when the camera crews are gone? It's madness.

And there is a healthy dose of Christian propaganda in this show that is unacceptable. ""In the name of Jesus Christ"" is the most repeated line in this tiresome series. Make no mistake: This series is spiked with religious propaganda; Jews, atheists, Muslims, and all others, beware...only priests and their holy water can save you from the dark side.
