3054389,1,B0010XB1WM,"There's a reason that HBO gave John From Cincinnati the ax after one season -- it was a creative and ratings disaster. I went into it with high hopes, and it showed promise through the first two or three episodes, then went into the tank. Or maybe a more appropriate term would be ""wiped out,"" since it's about a surfing family.

Quirky? Yes, but not like Twin Peaks. John from Cincinnati never really went anywhere (not that Twin Peaks always did), and some of the odd things went beyond the plot, such as:

Why did they have one of the more interesting characters, played by Bruce Greenwood, in so few episodes? Why did Rebecca De Mornay, normally a pretty interesting actress, turn into a shrill you-know-what halfway through the show and become so totally unsympathetic? And couldn't they have come up with someone who could both surf and act, instead of casting Greyson Fletcher as Shaun? He puts on one of the worst amateur acting performances since Sophia Coppola in Godfather III.

I hung onto the end, hoping for some kind of clue as to where it was really going, but it was hard. If you buy the DVD, maybe it can at least be used for a drinking game whenever one member of the Yost family hurls the f-word at another. You'd get drunk pretty fast.

All in all, a profane mess full of largely unsympathetic characters. Oh, and they're calling it the first season at Amazon? Didn't anyone tell them the show was cancelled after a meager 10 episodes? I'm surprised HBO is even bothering to put it out on DVD, but I guess they need to try to get something back on their investment.",1198800000,15,1586,4.515679442508711
3054390,5,B0010XB1WM,"It's unfortunate that the term ""groundbreaking"" when it comes to television series seems to equate only to pushing the boundaries of sex and violence. ""John From Cincinnati"" broke new ground in narrative style and tackling the difficult topic of our collective subjective experiences that looked from the outside to be a simplistic family drama about surfing. It is definitely much more than that.

""John From Cincinnati"" plays more like a fable than a realistic drama whose characters are simultaneously over-the-top caricatures and profoundly human. They encompass our irrational fears, damaging anger, tendency to cling to the past, and our desire to escape from it and change. These characters ARE us, and we look at them both in their specific niche and set against the tableau of the history of our species' existence (""big and huge"" as John describes).

At the center of this is John who is less of an actual character and more of a personification of that which connects us and our own naivet. He is a narrative device analogous to a Greek chorus. He serves as a reflection of a character's innermost thoughts and desires and strives to connect them to each other. He even literally does this as he imitates them. He stands apart from the rest of the cast to comment on them in his own bizarre way.

The writing is rich in its language and subtle humor. We aren't treated to immediate gratification either (and even the finale creates more mystery than it solves which is unfortunate in this case). Certainly airing immediately after the finale of ""The Sopranos"" when no one was watching handicapped such a series where continuity is significant. It takes several episodes to hit its full stride, but it does reward the dedicated viewer, gradually shedding light on previous events.

Milch's work on the early seasons of ""NYPD Blue"" and on ""Deadwood"" especially is brilliant, and ""John From Cincinnati"" is no exception in its own, very unique way. This is truly experimental, groundbreaking, underrated television for those willing to put forth the effort to read between the lines and immerse themselves in the lives of these disparate characters.",1198281600,71,2156,5.0139664804469275
3054391,5,B0010XB1WM,"This show was like Woodstock of our generation: wonderful, compelling experience that made thousands reach out towards each other, seeking meaning and understanding and in the end forming the strongest of bonds, the great human link. Some call it generating God, not the bleak deity you can read on or hear about, but the one you can experience directly through your deepest essence, your soul, that same soul that was so quiet all these years, you forgot it even existed. Yet it does exist, the soul, and is it not true art's purpose to pluck on spirit's rusty strings, to make it leap, vibrate and sing as it was meant by the creator?",1197849600,21,636,4.6371681415929205

It's not just another ""blood-sex-HBO Drama"", it's smart. Funny in places you wouldn't normally see funny. And let's not forget the acting. Oh, the actors are superb! I loved and obsessed over every moment of this show, trying to puzzle out the mystery with the characters. And every last piece of it is still in my mind as I mourn the loss of this fabulous show.

C'mon, HBO, seriously. When you cancelled this show, you cemented your reputation: All blood and sex, no substance. I think it's time I switch to Showtime.",1197676800,23,642,4.5344827586206895

Worth the price just to see Ed O'Niel and Zippy... on repeated viewing this show is one of the highest pieces of writing I've seen in years from TV...or film... too bad the show was cancelled but it still sort of works as a ten episode mini series..it leaves you hanging at the end..but somehow even that sort of works for this...

3054395,5,B0010XB1WM,"Only the damned can be saved...and that's exactly what happens when John appears one morning, straight out of the blue (or Cincinnati as he'd have it) to tell Mitch Yost (patriarch of a multigenerational family of competitive surfers) to ""Get back in the Game.""
Funny stuff happens around John. People go up in the air. Things, usually in satisfyingly impressive denominations, materialize right out of his pockets.
The dead come back to life
The living begin to come back to life by both reaching out, and receiving kindnesses from one and other.
As one bemused individual, drawn into the strange and mysterious goings on around the Yost's observes: ""There's a lot of quick healers in this zip code.""

This is an intellectual show about a dysfunctional surfing family, their friends, their neighbors - all of them, unknowingly, receiving divine intervention from an unusual visitor from ""Cincinnati."" The family is groveling over many demons and issues, but the personalities of the friends and neighbors who support them in various ways are most interesting as they become altered by a new energy, no doubt created by the new visitor. The conversations that they have among themselves appear to be an attempt to reason with why things are the way they are in Imperial Beach and with the acclaimed, surfing Yost Family - who seem be at the core of this town.

I'd compare it to best of television from the US and around the world.
It also goes to show how stultified and repressed television today has become as the US culture shifts to a new form of politically correct that insists all social issues are powderkegs of reprisal for anyone daring to not conform to the tone and vocabulary mandated by the thought police.
John From Cincinatti took time to find its audience, which ended up being bigger than some ""hit"" TV shows today -- something I'm sure the decision makers deeply, financially regret; not making the decision to run another season.
Here is a cast and a story that could go to work today and the story could continue.

3054548,3,B0010XB1WM,"Directing and acting could have been way better. If it hadn't be for Ed O'Neill, Bruce Greenwood and a short appearance by Howard Hesseman included in the cast I don't think I would have bothered to stick with this show. They were really the only good actors in the whole production. Rebecca De Mornay was awful and the boy who played her grandson was painfully under talented. I think they picked him for his ablilities to skateboard, surf and juggle. Sorry. I love quirky shows like this with some metaphysical aspects and  of course having grown up in Southern California the beach/surfing inclusion caught my attention right away.
The dialogue was a bit confusing at times but that apparently is the earmark of the creators Milch and Nunn. Who created ""Deadwood"" on HBO. I did watch all episodes and would reccomend to others who like this type of genre to try it. The storyline may have made a bit more sense if a second season had been allowed to return. But it is what it is. 1 season only........ not season 1 and more to come.",1471824000,,1035,4.564516129032258

The characters are both over the top and yet painfully relatable.  The relationships portrayed are both real and genuine.  I really enjoy the dynamics between all the ""odd-ball/land of the misfits"" type characters.  Everyone has something to overcome and I find myself rooting for every character.

3054791,4,B0010XB1WM,"This is an oddball series that was strangely compelling.  John's character I expected to change. but by the 10th episode I was pleased he really hadn't.  You knew he had something, was new to Earth and would learn and relate as earthlings do; that didn't happen. His vocabulary grew but the appearance of just being mimicry was relatively the same.  The clues to his ''what is he-ness''  seemingly precognitive ability was more, or with, healer and precog-empathy he could send as well as receive.  I could go on but lets not give it all away.  The California surf culture is hard to adapt to, but, to even begin to understand the story and what is happening to whom, you have to learn it.

My rating is a 4+/5- stars.  The series has many unanswered questions: 9/11/14, rm-24, and, three generations (that apparently follows a paternal line), of clued in clueless men.  The gals are all hot (Dude! Rebecca De Mornay poppin crackers in my flop, I'd be stoked).  My only real problem -- is there going to be another season?",1448064000,,1022,4.627777777777778

If you like observing strange and unexplainable behavior of a very messed up family and the odd people around them when thrown into a situation that they could not possibly understand, then watch the whole thing.

The dialogue doesn't make sense half the time and acting seems terrible; but its the kind of show where that might be what they were going for. Seriously. I can't tell if it's a terrible hunk of ponyloaf or a profound statement on ... something - and if it is I still haven't figured out what. Every character in it is either an over-the-top a-hole or crazy. It's hard to like or identify with any of them.

Strangest part is that almost everyone involved in this show is experienced and has done extremely good stuff in other shows (SoA, Deadwood, etc). This isn't a bunch of amateurs slapping together a show because HBO wanted to spend money; this is a crew of really talented professionals (creators, directors, actors - everyone) who don't usually do garbage.

Maybe it's the era in which Milch created this series, which is far different from the era of Twin Peaks, and America is far more scatterbrained now than in the 80s.

3054907,4,B0010XB1WM,"... with well drawn characters, pretty fair character development, and an intriguing, rather ethereal plot.  It's not the usual fare.  Subtitles will help through dialogue that's occasionally a little hard to follow, whether due to low sound volume or rapid pacing and unusual use of language. Real surfers are featured with real surf sequences, which makes it very nice to look at.  Released in 2007, one or two bits of content are dated now but that doesn't detract.  Professional critics have mentioned that the season closing was rushed due to the show having been cancelled.  It was noticeable to a non-pro like myself, though at least there was closure, and explanations.  For some series that are cancelled early here's no closure at all, one is just left hanging.  So, gracias to the writers and to whomever gave them the heads up.  This is one of the few series I find myself going back to and re-watching now and again.",1444867200,,929,4.79874213836478

3054932,4,B0010XB1WM,"This quirky counter-culture Messiah story, starts out like a low-key simmering walk through the park, lulling you into the personal dramas of the main characters--almost to the point you don't even remember or acknowledge John from Cincinnati himself.  In fact, John is so weird and unintelligible you assume the story is going to be about an autistic man who finds some friends among a highly dysfunctional surfing family.  Well, you'd be wrong.  After the story revs up by the 4th or 5th episode you realize the story is really about what John's oddly Zen presence is doing to these crazy and volatile people.  The story becomes more and more metaphysical and bizarre as John weaves his secret code of magic powers on his new-found family.  By the end, you're not really sure what you just watched, but you wish there was a Season 2!  Other than some convoluted editing and some overacting from De Mornay, Greyson Fletcher as Butchie and the incorrigible Ed O'Neill as Bill Jacks, the story meanders outside the lines and is mostly surprising.  I really hope there's a Season 2.",1444176000,,1080,4.836956521739131

This is the kind of story we watched n the 1970's as vehicles to ponder the meaning of life. After power-waching the entire series, suspecting it was probably half-formed nonsense, I read all I could about it on-line, trying to figure out what the HECK??!! Like Haroun and the Sea of Stories teaches us, here are only a handful of stories in the world, and this is one of those familiars. The story of salvation. Maybe religious, maybe not. We couldn't get enough of it, even when we suspected it was a put-on. The only negative eas Rebecca DeMornay's uncharacteristically awful acting.

The language was, at times, so high that it seemed to be in iambic pentameter.  I think Shakespeare would have been proud.  I thought that all of the actors were spot on and especially enjoyed the performances of Ed O'Neil, the lottery winning gay man (can't remember the actor's name) and Greyson Fletcher.  Amazing writing!

I've watched it three times all the way through and find something different each time.  The zeros and ones on the (cave or internet) wall can hear the words of John's father.  The transcendence of art.  Brilliant.

Every once in a while they will introduce some new characters who you cannot figure out where and why they are there.

3055115,1,B0010XB1WM,"This comes off as someone completely clueles iss about surf culture trying to make a buck by cashing in on the popularity of the surf culture.  People who live it, know this is crap. Less intelligent people who don't know the culture, might believe we are all this moronic. I don't know, the books these are based on (I haven't read) may be much, much better than the scripts here.

This is not creatively quirky, this is not ""new or fresh"". This show is trying toooooo hard.

Yes, I suffered through the entire thing.  Perversely, I kept waiting for something meaningful to happen. There are only two or three characters who don't cuss with every other word and it's mostly the f-word and various sex acts as cuss words. Hey, I can swear like a sailor, but this was just stupid. It reminds me of kids in school who try to beef out an essay requiring a specific number of words, only this time it was ridiculous profanity. I don't mind it when it's a legitimate part of REAL LIFE conversation, but it seems that the people are all cretins who aren't bright and have extremely limited vocabulary.

Most every character (save three) is exaggerated and completely over the top unbelievable.

The BEST part of this series are the opening shots.  Seriously.

What I liked about this series:  Luis Guzman was the only character whose script gave him something to work with even though it wasn't a lot, some really good scenes with very few clunkers. His natural ability here could have been in any reputable, solid piece and in fact, he's had some great roles. The kid who played Shaun may not be an actor, but for the part, it worked. His sparse dialogue makes the character seem like an old soul, he was likeable.  Ed O'Neill was as good as he could be under the circumstances.

More dislikes:  As fine looking as he is and as good an actor as he is, Bruce Greenwood's character was meh, but not as bad Rebecca de Mornay's character who had ZERO redeeming qualities - she needed serious medication. You could see the white around her eyes in every shot - seriously hyperbitch ready to f-this and that and go Tasmanian Devil on people. Needed a straight jacket.

Milch, one of the co-creators admitted in an interview that the show was put together too fast and there was not enough respect for the process.  It shows.  I am thankful for the admission because otherwise I would have to believe the show was confusing for the sake of being confusing and I hate that.

There story is incomplete.  There is no beginning or end only a middle unless launching a new clothing line was meant to be the goal.  There is very little character development.  Characters like the chemist, the young Hawaiian, and the Chinese man are introduced with no purpose while other characters like the Doctor fall abruptly out of the story. I am not sure if the actor that played Shawn was told to be a lifeless robot or he could just not act which is bad since the story revolves around him..  The show's title character, John, would have been better off not being in the story at all.  Nichols did a good job with it but all he does is distract.

The purpose of the show is to remind us that we are interconnected no matter how quirky we are or how much baggage we have.  To that I say, ""Thanks for stating the obvious.""

The show does provide some laughs and Ed O'Neil's performance was terrific which is why I am charitably giving this 3 stars.  What is really annoying is that there was potential for a great show.

The short of it is, it got the axed after one season. Why? Well, that is what you ask HBO; maybe the concept should have been given time, or the series would have legs in 2015. The total crazy dialogue with great street cussing, characters that are one step away from psycho ward, and John. Hint: faith test in the bible school meaning of faith but without the baggage -- ""You can hear my father..."" ""See god Cass..""

3055288,3,B0010XB1WM,The handful of surfing sequences is the best part--though it's hard to say if there's surfing in every episode (which speaks volumes about the overall show). The cast works as hard to make sense of the script as the characters do their circumstances. The viewer comments are also pretty hilarious and extremely polarized: it seems many folks mistake poorly realized writing as mysterious and highbrow. Too many loose threads and loose screws--though it was somewhat hilarious when Luke Perry's character grew inexplicably agitated and mooned a group of business folks in a meeting.

3055328,4,B0010XB1WM,"This is a quirky series. Parts of it dragged a bit. The constant, recurring anger by DeMornay's character kind of baffled me.

However, if you've lived in Los Angeles or been part of the surfing scene (ever), there's a crazy logic to this story that's addictive. If you liked the old TV series, ""It's Like, You Know"" (ABC 1999 - 2000), you may love this series.

If strong language and loose morals offend you, don't bother with this series. Some of the parenting and relationships in the show are absolutely appalling, too. One element is absolutely nightmarish.

Despite the things that bothered me about this series, I watched the entire season in just a few days. I really wanted to know who (or what) John was... and I'm still not sure.

I'm not sure this series can sustain its entertainment value, especially if DeMornay's character continues her irrational rages. (I want to like her, but her inappropriate antagonism got on my nerves, even before the other shoe dropped, in ""call Child Protective Services"" terms. After that, I flinched whenever she showed up in a scene, apparently oblivious or at least unrepentant about her behaviors.)

The show is well cast and written with style. Even the occasional over-the-top rambles (like the one by the car salesman) are forgiveable as this series explores odd and innovative themes.

For now, I'm looking forward to seeing where the story goes. At the moment, it makes no sense, but there's a logic and symmetry to it. It's difficult to explain, unless you've lived in L.A. or been involved in surfing... and possibly both.

You'll either hate this series or keep watching because... well, it's like... you know... but at the beach.",1435276800,,1687,4.8776223776223775

If you're going to hire a social media team to write fake reviews: 1) Make sure it's not the same person pretending to be various people who just happen to sound like exactly the same person. 2) Make some effort to make the reviews ... sort of almost believable, i.e., see item 1 and maybe don't make all of them 100% faux-gushing in the same exact way.  I'll throw in a #3 to give you some benefit of the doubt. I guess it's sort of, maybe possible that all of these reviews are genuinely 5-star, not written by a marketing team or single writer and are only the freak bi-product of a cloning experiment gone terribly wrong and bringing the five clones together 'coincidentally' on some review page. But ... I just don't think so.  a) This show was painfully bad on almost all fronts. Some of the surfing was pretty cool.  Whatever. 2) People don't speak this way. Anywhere. Ever.  Someone like David Lynch can pull that off & with a purpose. This, does not. Neither in the shows nor in real customer reviews.  And, I guess that's my point on both..

Has this guy ever had a bad show? This one and Luck are both brilliant and largely ignored by the TV audience (because they were on HBO, maybe?) and cancelled way before their time. You can hear this writer in his characters' dialogue, something rare in a clichd world of TV hacks. And he works with some of the best actors in the business. Deadwood was the pinnacle of the Western genre for me, a modern Gunsmoke that should have lasted much longer than 3 seasons. John and Luck take leaps way outside the box - this one being a tale of a family of surfers (any more details would be spoilers), and Luck basically hovers over high and low denizens of Santa Anita - a welcome change from lawyers and cops and zombies and vamps. TV for adults, yes, but as literate as TV series are ever likely to get. Milch also created NYPD Blue for those of you who remember. Anyways...",1434412800,7,1041,4.371134020618556

There is something very special about John and the residents of Imperial Beach with whom he becomes involved. With whom you too will hopefully become involved. I hope you watch it. I hope you love it. If you're cup is empty may John help to fill it again with love for this strange life, on this strange planet, with these strange people.

I always enjoyed the dialogue and the characters, and the way it was structures (sort of like a play with a Greek choir). I have to say, it's one of those shows that you either love or hate, as you can see from many reviews. It's hard to explain to people who haven't seen it and know nothing about it, and can be hard to get into if you don't at least give it a chance.

Look no further. It takes real life and fantasy and blends them seamlessly.

The show is about a surfing family who adopt a mystery man from Cincinnati that can do miracles, but is nave about most things. I know that sounds pretty boring, but it is actually very well written.

3055464,3,B0010XB1WM,"John from Cincinatti is flawed, but worth watching if you are a surfer, like surf culture, or want to reminisce about southern cali beach culture.  The mini-series starts out well.  Interesting quirky characters and a bit of magical realism.  If you are a fan of Kem Nun's surf fiction, you will appreciate the concept of the show.
Sadly, about half-way through, the show looses its way.  Magical realism, like chili pepper, is best used sparingly.  Toward the end, JFC becomes fully surreal.  Not that I mind surrealism ... but the change from light magical realism to full-blown surrealism left me feeling dis-jointed and confused.
The other disappointment was the characterization.  Over the course of the show, quirky characters become downright annoying.  Rebecca De Mornay is a good actress.  Her character is believable and multi-faceted at the start.  Yet by the end she is reduced to playing a caricature who screams and cusses her way through every episode.
John visits profound revelations upon the characters which might cause deeply transformative experiences ... yet in spite of profound revelations about her past, DeMornay's character becomes predictable, boring, and annoying.
Likewise, the possibly homosexual ""hoods"" from Hawaii.  Their characters are like bad mental slapstick - they might provide comic relief but they are too annoying to be really funny.
John From Cincinnati had real promise, but didn't live-up to its potential ... ironically like the surfers it portrays.  My BF would give it 4 stars b/c it has some good surf scenes and you will ""recognize"" some of these ""beach type"" characters if you surf in SoCali.  Too bad the show didn't stay on-track with its original concept.",1385683200,,1710,5.174545454545455

3055466,1,B0010XB1WM,"Idiot savant stranger who may have mystical abilities comes to a small (very) sleepy California surf mecca town where half the cast are apparently unemployed and spend their days surfing, smoking pot, selling pot, or randomly bumming around spouting philosophical musings.

A couple of people develop strange, supernatural abilities but are either indifferent to them or more concerned with hiding them than exploring them. As a result, they don't really have much effect on the plot (other than one brief scare). Which makes one wonder why they were written in at all. If Jack has a supernatural ability and is Still boring, than Jack is a Truly dull boy.

If you're higher than a kite on reefer like the writers were, this may be for you. Make sure you're properly cooked before watching and stay that way well after, otherwise you're likely to realize that not much of anything is happening in all the sub plots to nowhere. Episode after episode, it looks like something interesting might happen... then it side tracks, new characters and plots are thrown in, the old ones just kind of linger. Eventually the show is full of loose ends and you realize that the writers just don't know what they are doing.

Clearly, after doing someone a Huge favor by green-lighting this, the execs tossed in the towel and walked away after 10 episodes.

3055483,5,B0010XB1WM,"There isn't much I can say about John From Cincinnati because it really is meant to be a subjective experience.  The plot revolves around the Yost family of Imperial Beach, their friends and acquaintances, and a newcomer by the name of John Monad.
The Yosts have the same problems as we do...dysfunctional family, substance abuse, comfortable ruts, and misplaced priorities.  It isn't until circumstances are changed/put in motion by the X Factor (John) that the family begins to come together.

Another show by David Milch of Deadwood fame, JFC premiered right after the screen went blank on the Sopranos.  I watched the show faithfully, week-to-week, and was drawn in by what I saw was a show that was unlike ANYTHING I had ever seen.  At the end of the 10 season run (JFC was never picked up for a 2nd season), I had far more questions than answers.  It took all I had to not send an angry letter to HBO for wasting my time.  I am reasonably intelligent and just paid attention to a show for nearly 10 hours only to be left in the dark?  Thankfully I had recorded the episodes as I went, and I gave it a 2nd watch (this time, not waiting a week between episodes).  The birds began singing, the clouds parted, and after the 10th episode ended for the second time, I was given a new perspective and had many of my core beliefs reaffirmed.  At base level, this is a story about family, evolution, human nature, and how each and every one of us is a product of our past.  Just as one random negative event can send a ripple through a group of people for years to come, so can a random positive event.

Because this is Milch on HBO, the language is coarse and explicit situations/themes are around every corner.  For me, this makes the story that much more genuine.  I KNOW these kinds of people, and this is they way they talk.  The actors, many of whom had worked with Milch on his previous shows, were sometimes made to improvise or were just given scripts the morning of the shoot.  While this seems like a risky move, it pays off over and over again.  The cast is what makes this show.  Whether it is the familiar faces of Ed O Neil, Luke Perry, Rebecca Demornay, Sean Paul Gosselar, Luis Guzman, or Garret Dillahunt (the new ""Im in everyting on TV"" guy)...or the new faces like surfers Keala Kennelly and Greyson Fletcher, the characters are extreme, but believable.  You know these people..they are an extension of your family and friends.

I have purchased 6 copies of JFC at this point...4 of them off of Amazon...and have had 100% success rate with the people I have gifted the show to.  That said, not everyone ""gets"" this show....and that is OK.  It didn't get cancelled after 1 season because it was a bad show, but it also didn't get picked up because it isn't easily accessible to the general population.  It is a deep show that doesnt provide all of the answers.

3055484,3,B0010XB1WM,"First of all the series lasted just one season and got canceled so don't expect too much closure to the story. There is an ending (or is it a beginning of a new chapter for all these characters?) but I'm not spoiling it for those of you interested in this unique HBO series.

Secondly, it takes place in a surfing community but that is really just a porthole into these people's lives. It is more about how preconceived notions can be turned around 180 and a community and family can come together and get past judging people based on their job, choice of lifestyle, appearance, etc. That sounds like a simple and nicely wrapped up synopsis but once you start watching this series, you'll wonder why it takes such a convoluted route to reach that conclusion.

""John From Cincy"" is definitely weird and seems like a second division ripoff of ""Twin Peaks,"" but well worth watching mainly because of the interesting characters. I will say although John, as a sort of mirror that reflects back the reality of these people's lives, is the main driving force he is more an annoying Rain Man than anything else.

To be honest, the creator of this series comes across like he dropped way too much acid in the '60s and his head is filled with some magical and lyrical poetry that only he can comprehend. When it's spit out onto the screen, it can be thicker than pea soup to paddle through. Not that it's not worth sticking with this series episode to episode. Just be forewarned your brain may explode trying to figure out what it all means.

Seeing Luke Perry and a porn actress turned born-again mom become an item, Rebecca de Mornay as a screaming lunatic of a grandma (a grandma?), the guy from WKRP (Howard Hesseman) as an old hippy dippy drug casualty, the ""Married With Children"" dad (Ed O'Neill) as a retired cop who ""talks"" to his pet birds and Carrie's gay friend from ""Sex and the City"" (Greyson Fletcher) as a surf-loving easygoing and nice guy lawyer are all worth the price of admission.

The soundtrack is beyond awesome. The opening credit montage with Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros doing ""Johnny Appleseed"" to the closing credits on episode 1 with the awesome ""Sun Rise Light Flies"" by Kasabian as surfers ride those waves is magic. Lastly, the ""sound"" of the surf in beach scenes where no music, no dialogue is on, you can almost feel like it's coming through your TV screen. Very hard to explain but it captures the way beaches are and how powerful the sea is.

Now before I go as weird on you, I would say this series is not for everyone and I can understand people tuning out after one or two episodes. My advice is, if you stuck with ""Twin Peaks"" through season two, you can at least give this a shot.",1321833600,,2717,4.5234215885947044

The plot script and dialogue in this movie is so hideously poor, it seems almost certain that it was intentionally made to flop.  Who could possibly think this was even slightly good???

Every shot, every moment I found myself completely enthralled - or more accurately - caught in the web the production team spun to trap those of us who do crave creativity in television.

The Family Yost, the surrounding community, the hangers on and most of all, John - wander in and out of an altered reality as though both residents of another dimension and characters in a Greek Tragedy.
This is clearly not a show for those who need their storytelling neatly told and wrapped up with a bow and cries of it being ""garbage"" or ""crap"" tell us more about the viewer than the series.  One needn't like or even appreciate JFC or similarly crafted shows, but just because you don't ""get it"" does not mean it's junk for all, or those who do appreciate it shouldn't.

My take:  it's partly rooted in the Six Feet Under mode, along with undercurrents from Being There (Peter Sellers).  There's an element of Parsifal in the mix also.  Spot on script and acting.

I was expecting it as a Christmas present but when that failed, I ended up buying it for an unbelievable price. Thanks Amazon for price update notices on the wish list.

I gave it a 4 because there was way too much profanity.  Yes I am an adult, but it was embarrassing for people to say it reminded me of things I would talk about regarding my surfing years, and none of my friends talked like that.  They were very respectful.

I feel that I would only recommend this show for older viewers, and for them please not to think that all surfers are like the ones in the television series.

It was great to see the surfing scenes.  They made me smile and want to get back in the game as John would say.

3055497,4,B0010XB1WM,"There has been so much description of this show, I don't want to add more. I watched all episodes in a day and a half- almost overloaded I would say. Yet it is quirky and anti-climactic.

The main character Grandpa Mitch (Bruce Greenwood) departs half-way through and only returns during the final two episodes. Which leaves Grandma Cissy (Rebecca De Mornay)to scream curses at anyone who walks on scene. She is described as a ball-buster, yet this seems a convenient cover for the missing Greenwood who may have been off with other acting commitments.(I don't know if the is true, just a thought...)

Ultimately everything appears to be about the 14-year old boy Shaun, (Greyson Flecher) who is very appealing and really surfs well. He is killed and resurrected, disappears but is found and disappears again only to be found again with the very convenient answer to everything. Yet whenever the youngster is in trouble, every character in the show drops whatever they are doing and searches for him- even drug-dealing mobsters just in from Hawaii!  I loved all the characters and their interactions, it adds some of the magic to the show. Yet they all want to be this kid's parent (uncle, auntie) and lament their flaws so much how can a 14 year old respect them?

Okay so this isn't 'Titanic' or 'Lord of the Rings' in scope, a modern Divine Comedy maybe. Yet, except for Flecher most of the actors are experienced, familiar and quirky. Isn't that what we expect from a HBO series? Despite the flaws, I like it enough to purchase it and am recommending it to you.",1271376000,2,1565,4.721611721611722

3055500,4,B0010XB1WM,"The Yosts are a dysunctional family that contains three generations of surfing royalty. Mitch Yost (Bruce Greenwood), the patriarch, is a surfing champ whose career was ended by an injury; Butch Yost (Brian Van Holt), Mitch's son, who seemed poised to follow in his father's footsteps until his career was cut short by drug addiction; and Shaun Yost (Greyson Fletcher), Butch's son, who is known as a surfing prodigy but is hampered from joining contests by his guardian Mitch who doesn't want to see him follow in his or Butch's footsteps. But when the mysterious John (Austin Nichols) shows up their lives are changed by miracles and other occurences that bring them closer together.

David Milch is a god of television. Milch created such powerhouses as Deadwood and NYPD Blue, as well as writing for shows as LA Law, Brooklyn South, and Hill Street Blues. His love for language makes for some of the most colorful scripts you will ever hear committed to the screen as can be attested to by anyone who's watched Deadwood (if you haven't watched it, go check it out today). After Deadwood ended in it's third season, Milch went on to work on John From Cincinnati. Utilizing a lot of the same actors as can be seen in Deadwood, with a few fresh faces that you'll recognize from other TV shows and movies, John From Cincinnati is a very ambitious TV show that appears to only have lasted one season. The big question is: did it deserve more.

I would say so. John From Cincinnati is brilliantly written taking twists and turns not common for TV, making it a very original show. Touching on moments of existentialism, belief in God, drug abuse, redemption, and so on, John From Cincinnati is the type of show I wish would be made more often. The characters are well developed, with their own quirks, hangups, and problems that all feel real and fit the actors perfectly, and the storyline takes twists and turns that you'd never expect. This isn't your typical cliched television show.

The acting is superb, and in many cases I would say that it's some of it's actors best work. Of these, the two standouts in my mind are Ed O'Neill and Brian Van Holt. Ed O'Neill as Bill Jacks, a former cop and friend of the Yosts, plays a man who is still adjusting to life without a badge and without his wife. He gets the meatiest lines of the show, and, in my opinion, gives some of his best acting work apart from his performance as the patriarch in Modern Family. Brian Van Holt has a little more of a wall to climb playing the drug addicted failure of a son who's heard one too man times that he's a loser and needs to get off the drugs, but the way he portrays it makes you feel every tick from messed up to jonesing and beyond. You feel him when he tries to redeem himself and find his way back into a better relationship with his son.

But I have to fault the series for being a bit too impenetrable at times and even a tad bit pretentious. At times the show is too clever and self aware of it, Milch and his writing seem to be trying to send a message, and try to hard to rap the message in an enigma in something of an attempt to show off. I still can't tell you that I know what all of it means, and maybe I will eventually figure it out on future viewings and while the rewatchability factor is a strength of the show, it's also it's weakness.

All in all, I would highly recommend the show. The dialogue is brilliant and just fun to listen to, and the acting is superb. The movie works on various levels from comedy to drama and beyond and is highly entertaining.

This was a spectacular show with a tremendous balance of mystery, revelations, great acting performances, superb casting and terrific story development.

Rebecca de Mornay may have provided her best performance ever.  You probably have never seen someone who allows her ball-busting demons such free reign.  Her bitch roots might startle you, but they are presented quickly and then left behind in the dust of yet another set of revelations.

I couldn't decide how I felt about Greyson Fletcher's performance.  It was either a very weak performance, or Shaun was supposed to be a blank slate and character development was cut off by the premature cancelling of the show.

Willie Garzon, Luiz Guzman, Dayton Callie, Paul Ben-Victor and especially Ed O'Neill form a brilliant tribe of support characters for this story line.

Unfortunately it was cancelled and we are left hanging.  I would very much like the show's creators to provide some sort of wrap up for the project for clarification.

I have seen the series and taped the episodes. I have viewed every episode several times and I never tire of this thing. I was and am a huge fan of the HBO series Six Feet Under. The first season of that series is in my view the best single season of any program in history...well, it was until John From Cincinnati. They are neck and neck.
The creativity is extraordinary. The conversations between characters is dance like...in fact if you loved the dialogue in DEADWOOD you will love this.

Remember when you were a kid and you could run up to a group of children your own age that were say;digging a hole to China or building some contraption?. You didn't know them and they didn't know you, but within seconds you were participating in something. That is the magical quality in human beings(lost by the time we are adults) that is depicted in JFC. That quality is our salvation. We have but to re-connect with it.

Then you have three generations of professional surfers - a grandfather, a father who's a heroin addict, and a son played by one of the worst kid actors I've ever seen.  I winced almost every time he spoke.  Then you have Rebecca de Mornay in an awful, awful role as the angriest, most foul-mouthed grandmother in TV history.  I don't think once in all 10 episodes did they show her smile - she literally constantly had a scowl on her face and was usually yelling at someone.  And I like Rebecca de Mornay, so I hated that.  I only finished the show because of the money I spent on it and it was short - I had lost interest by the second or third episode and it never got better.  Only two or three noteworthy things happened in the whole series.  I started to listen to the commentary on the first episode, by the creator David Milch, but didn't finish - he's a very angry, cynical man, and just scary - I very much disliked listening to him (part of his commentary was mentioning that he'd love to follow someone home who'd cut him off on the highway and kill them - or maybe it was beat the crap out of them, I don't remember.)  In episode 7, I think, there was a ""dream"" - not really, but everyone ended up in the same place talking real, true nonsense.  In an extra Milch explained, to the actors and to us, what all the gibberish meant.  It was just as confusing as the gibberish itself.  Leave this one alone.  Don't even buy it used.  Two stars is only for the acting.",1215475200,4,2175,4.336633663366337

3055519,1,B0010XB1WM,"I'm not even sure where to begin with this show...  My wife and I had subscribed to HBO (to watch the final season of the Soprano's and Big Love).  During this time, we also watched Flight of the Conchords and this show -- John from Cincinnati.

Prior to watching ""John"", I was under the impression that HBO produced *good* shows that really draw you in.  I was sadly wrong.  This show was a convoluted mess, waiting for it's plug to be pulled from day one.

Unfortunately, as I again thought HBO made good shows (I also saw all the seasons of Six Feet Under -- BEST SHOW EVER!), both my wife and I thought (after watching the first episode of ""John""), *clearly* it will get better.  So we watched the second episode.

The show was even worse.

But again...  HBO produces quality shows -- perhap's were missing something...  Or perhaps it just takes a bit of time to warm up to, so we watched the third episode.

More of the same cancerous growth of garbage.

This went on-and-on until we watched the entire first season (thinking each episode that it'll get better and/or we'll warm up to it).  It NEVER did.

Many people who like this show mention a show called ""Deadwood"".  I have never seen it -- perhaps it takes a special kind of person to like this show, and accordingly also like Deadwood?

Based on that, I would highly caution you against buying this...  Aside from it sucking away at your life's core, it also will eat away at your wallet to purchase this DVD set.  Again, there (to my absolute shock) are some folks who like this show...  So clearly my wife and I (not to mention sister who watched 2 episodes, and mother and her husband who watched half of the first episode) are on a different bus than those other reviewers.",1210550400,11,1739,4.443037974683544

3055521,3,B0010XB1WM,"When I was on vacation last summer in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, me and my family stayed at a hotel in Sault Saint Marie. The TV in the hotel room had cable, including HBO. On this particular night I was flicking through all the channels looking for something to watch, and I came across an episode of HBO's newest series at the time, ""John from Cincinnati"". I had heard from a few TV critics that this show wasn't very good. But I decided to watch the episode that aired, and it looked like an interesting show. So when it came out on DVD, I wanted to get it so that I could watch all 10 episodes. Well I have seen all 10 episodes, and I have to give ""John from Cincinnati"" a mixed review.

This very strange and bizarre series takes place over nine eventful days as we follow an assortment of characters from Imperial Beach, California (a town which lies south of San Diego and north of the U.S.-Mexico border). Much of the action focuses on the very dysfunctional Yost family, which has three generations of surfers. The patriarch is Mitch Yost, who was once a top-notch surfer until an injury cut his surfing career short. Eventually he passed his surfing genes onto his son Butchie, who turned out to be a very good surfer as well. But things started to go downhill for Butchie when he started using drugs, which (as the show starts) is ruining his life. While Mitch is the first Yost surfer and Butchie the second Yost surfer, the third Yost surfer comes in the form of Butchie's teenage son Shaun, who is being raised by Mitch and his wife Cissy, since Butchie's drug use puts him in no condition to raise his own son. Shaun loves surfing and wants to follow in his father's and grandfather's footsteps. The Yost clan owns a surf shop which Cissy runs along with Kai, a female surfer (and family friend of the Yost's) who occasionally looks after Shaun and has a sweet little relationship with Butchie. Other acquaintances of the Yost family include retired police officer Bill Jacks, who spends most of his time talking to his bird Zippy; Ramon, the manager of an old, broken down motel where Butchie is currently living; and Linc Stark, a surfing agent who once represented Butchie and is now pursuing to represent Shaun. Other characters include Cass, a young woman who (in the beginning) poses as a filmmaker working for Linc; Barry Cunningham, the new owner of that run down motel; Meyer Dickstein, another motel employee who usually works alongside Ramon; Tina Blake, a porn actress who happens to be Shaun's mother; Steady Freddy Lopez, a criminal who has a past with Butchie; and Palaka, Freddy's henchman. Their lives are all pretty much routine, that is until a mysterious stranger appears and proceeds to change their lives. That stranger is John Monad (aka John from Cincinnati). He's very dim, acts childlike much of the time, and constantly mimics the words of what the other characters around him say to his face. John repeatedly says things to people as if the world is coming to an end or something. Not to mention spiritual situations start happening to some of the members of the Yost clan. For example, in the first episode Mitch discovers that he can hover several inches off the ground, which he has no idea why. Also in episode one a dead bird comes back to life. In episode two a surfer suffers a life-threatening injury and ends up in a coma. The same bird gives that injured surfer a peck on the cheek and immediately wakes up and is completely healed. Is John the one behind all of this? Is he some supernatural force that needs to be reckoned with?

Throughout the 10 episodes, I found ""John from Cincinnati"" to run hot and cold. I thought the first three episodes were pretty good as I got to know these people. Then the show when kind of dull with the next four episodes, before finally coming back for a bright wrap-up with the final three episodes. The cast features some good acting from the cast, but I found only two characters to be truly memorable: teenage surfer Shaun Yost and retired cop Bill Jacks. These two characters are brought to life by two terrific actors: one a newcomer and the other a TV veteran (who made us laugh for over ten years playing one of the most popular TV patriarchs of all time). The newcomer is Greyson Fletcher, who in real life is a teen skater and gets to display some of that talent in a few episodes of this show. ""John from Cincinnati"" marks his acting debut and he does a terrific job in his first time out as an actor. I look forward to seeing more of this young talent in the years to come. The TV veteran who comes off great on this show is Ed O'Neill, who if you remember played the occasionally grouchy Al Bundy for 11 seasons on the popular '80s-'90s sitcom ""Married with Children"". O'Neill is on hand to provide most of the comic relief here, and as usual does a great job. The best scenes of this show are the ones where Shaun and Bill are on screen together. Those moments are wonderful. Only problem is there's not enough of them. I would have liked to have seen more scenes with Fletcher and O'Neill onscreen together, but unfortunately that doesn't happen, and that's because there are way too many unnecessary characters that we have to get to know, and I feel that they really don't need to be here. And that's the first of many problems that ""John from Cincinnati"" has.

Bruce Greenwood and Rebecca De Mornay are good as the head of the Yost clan, but they have been better in other projects in the past. Plus I was constantly laughing every time the Rebecca De Mornay character got angry, which was quite often. Did the writers have to make her character (Cissy) so mad almost all the time? (Get a load of one scene early in episode five -- the trailer sequence -- where De Mornay overacts so uproariously that it made me laugh out loud to the point where I had to stop the DVD because it made me laugh so hard.) Same goes for Brian Van Holt, who plays Butchie. In the first episode, Van Holt acts so angry most of the time that I thought this was going to be one of the most aggravating characters in television history. But as the show progressed over the next nine episodes, his character actually settled down and didn't act so mad as he did in episode one. This makes the Cissy Yost character the angriest one on the show. But to be perfectly honest, ""John from Cincinnati"" does work when the focus is on the Yost family. When the focus is on Mitch, Cissy, Butchie, Shaun, Bill the cop, Kai the surfer girl (played by another newcomer, Keala Kennelly), Tina the porn actress (played by Chandra West, who doesn't appear until episode four), and the mysterious John (played by Austin Nichols, who plays the childlike role well by not going over the top), the show is at its best. The show is at its worst when it focuses on all the other characters, mainly the ones at that motel. Luis Guzman (Ramon) is a good actor and I've liked him in the past, but he really doesn't belong here. He's actually good on this show, but to what point? He's stuck in the most uninteresting part of the show. The two other characters at that motel (employee Meyer and owner Barry) aren't very interesting either. And that leads to the two most annoying characters on the whole show: the criminals Steady Freddy Lopez and his henchman Palaka, who just happen to be rooming at that same motel. It drove me crazy watching these two guys interact on the screen, and they almost single handedly ruin the show. Take these two characters out of ""John from Cincinnati"" and the show would get four stars.

But in the end, I can only give ""John from Cincinnati"" three stars. And that's too bad. This show had potential. There are many good things about it. But in the end there was just too much, and some of the things on hand weren't that great, and that includes the fantasy element. This is a drama series that throws in a few fantasy moments just to grab our attention, and it really doesn't work. Ironically, this show made its debut just after the final episode of ""The Sopranos"" ended. Most ""Sopranos"" viewers were so ticked off by the ending of that series that they didn't even bother to check this series out. In fact a lot of people didn't bother to check this series out. Reviews were mostly bad, and it never caught fire in the ratings. ""John from Cincinnati"" was cancelled after the final episode aired, and maybe that was for the best. This show was far from being a classic, but I think if it had to be reworked into a better show, I believe it might work as a half-hour comedy series. Just get rid of the unnecessary characters (about half of them), focus on the Yost clan and a few of their friends, and you might have something.",1209340800,5,8725,4.492443324937028

It is perhaps one of the most thought provoking series on television recently. The humor is dry and often dark, and if you're not paying attention you may miss some great lines. It's riveting to see how the plot and characters develop over the series, and many (but certainly not all) of the mysteries are answered by the end. Speaking of the characters, there are some classic ones, like ""Barry the Fairy,"" who won the Mega-Millions after an epileptic vision gave him the winning numbers. Butchy Yost walks the tightrope between humor and tragedy like few characters on any series. Also impressive is the way JFC captures the Imperial Beach atmosphere.

HBO chose to premiere this show immediately after the Sopranos, which was a mistake because it's a very different viewing experience.

  Milch's idiosycratic dialogue worked perfectly in the mouths of Deadwood's denizens but similar lines sounded absurd coming from his surfer dudes and assorted oddballs. This ill-fated show simply never got its feet on solid ground.

But the opening sequence (and Bob Dylan music) for that last episode is truly moving, given all that happened on the show's run.

So, giving JFC one star is right enough for those who don't get it, but those that do get it, 5 are not enough.

I went into it with high hopes, and it showed promise through the first two or three episodes, then went into the tank. Or maybe a more appropriate term would be ""wiped out,"" since it's about a surfing family.

Quirky? Yes, but not like Twin Peaks. John from Cincinnati never really went anywhere (not that Twin Peaks always did), and some of the odd things went beyond the plot, such as:

Why did they have one of the more interesting characters, played by Bruce Greenwood, in so few episodes? Why did Rebecca De Mornay, normally a pretty interesting actress, turn into a shrill you-know-what halfway through the show and become so totally unsympathetic? And couldn't they have come up with someone who could both surf and act, instead of casting Greyson Fletcher as Shaun? He puts on one of the worst amateur acting performances since Sophia Coppola in Godfather III.

I hung onto the end, hoping for some kind of clue as to where it was really going, but it was hard. If you buy the DVD, maybe it can at least be used for a drinking game whenever one member of the Yost family hurls the f-word at another. You'd get drunk pretty fast.

All in all, a profane mess full of largely unsympathetic characters. Oh, and they're calling it the first season at Amazon? Didn't anyone tell them the show was cancelled after a meager 10 episodes?

3288887,5,B0010XB1WM,"It's unfortunate that the term ""groundbreaking"" when it comes to television series seems to equate only to pushing the boundaries of sex and violence. ""John From Cincinnati"" broke new ground in narrative style and tackling the difficult topic of our collective subjective experiences that looked from the outside to be a simplistic family drama about surfing. It is definitely much more than that.

""John From Cincinnati"" plays more like a fable than a realistic drama whose characters are simultaneously over-the-top caricatures and profoundly human. They encompass our irrational fears, damaging anger, tendency to cling to the past, and our desire to escape from it and change. These characters ARE us, and we look at them both in their specific niche and set against the tableau of the history of our species' existence (""big and huge"" as John describes).

At the center of this is John who is less of an actual character and more of a personification of that which connects us and our own naivet. He is a narrative device analogous to a Greek chorus. He serves as a reflection of a character's innermost thoughts and desires and strives to connect them to each other. He even literally does this as he imitates them. He stands apart from the rest of the cast to comment on them in his own bizarre way.

The writing is rich in its language and subtle humor. We aren't treated to immediate gratification either (and even the finale creates more mystery than it solves which is unfortunate in this case). Certainly airing immediately after the finale of ""The Sopranos"" when no one was watching handicapped such a series where continuity is significant. It takes several episodes to hit its full stride, but it does reward the dedicated viewer, gradually shedding light on previous events.

Milch's work on the early seasons of ""NYPD Blue"" and on ""Deadwood"" especially is brilliant, and ""John From Cincinnati"" is no exception in its own, very unique way. This is truly experimental, groundbreaking, underrated television for those willing to put forth the effort to read between the lines and immerse themselves in the lives of these disparate characters.",1198281600,71,2156,5.0139664804469275

This is an intellectual show about a dysfunctional surfing family, their friends, their neighbors - all of them, unknowingly, receiving divine intervention from an unusual visitor from ""Cincinnati."" The family is groveling over many demons and issues, but the personalities of the friends and neighbors who support them in various ways are most interesting as they become altered by a new energy, no doubt created by the new visitor. The conversations that they have among themselves appear to be an attempt to reason with why things are the way they are in Imperial Beach and with the acclaimed, surfing Yost Family - who seem be at the core of this town.

I'd compare it to best of television from the US and around the world.
It also goes to show how stultified and repressed television today has become as the US culture shifts to a new form of politically correct that insists all social issues are powderkegs of reprisal for anyone daring to not conform to the tone and vocabulary mandated by the thought police.
John From Cincinatti took time to find its audience, which ended up being bigger than some ""hit"" TV shows today -- something I'm sure the decision makers deeply, financially regret; not making the decision to run another season.

If it hadn't be for Ed O'Neill, Bruce Greenwood and a short appearance by Howard Hesseman included in the cast I don't think I would have bothered to stick with this show. They were really the only good actors in the whole production. Rebecca De Mornay was awful and the boy who played her grandson was painfully under talented. I think they picked him for his ablilities to skateboard, surf and juggle. Sorry. I love quirky shows like this with some metaphysical aspects and  of course having grown up in Southern California the beach/surfing inclusion caught my attention right away.
The dialogue was a bit confusing at times but that apparently is the earmark of the creators Milch and Nunn. Who created ""Deadwood"" on HBO. I did watch all episodes and would reccomend to others who like this type of genre to try it. The storyline may have made a bit more sense if a second season had been allowed to return.

There is an agent of some sort who comes along to create agita but in the guise of wanting to help the youngest surfer become famous and make lots of money.. And then there's an older man who is a ""friend"" of the youngest surfer. He seems a little evil too. And then, there is John, from Cincinnati. No one really knows who is is (is he an angel, an alien, just someone from Ohio who is a little slow) or knows why he's there--yet. And we may never know, or at least I may never know.

They took a somewhat bold subject, that done poorly, could've easily come off cheesy and created an intimate story about a family who begins to experience something of a ""divine intervention"".

The characters are both over the top and yet painfully relatable.  The relationships portrayed are both real and genuine.  I really enjoy the dynamics between all the ""odd-ball/land of the misfits"" type characters.  Everyone has something to overcome and I find myself rooting for every character.

You knew he had something, was new to Earth and would learn and relate as earthlings do; that didn't happen. His vocabulary grew but the appearance of just being mimicry was relatively the same.  The clues to his ''what is he-ness''  seemingly precognitive ability was more, or with, healer and precog-empathy he could send as well as receive.  I could go on but lets not give it all away.  The California surf culture is hard to adapt to, but, to even begin to understand the story and what is happening to whom, you have to learn it.

My rating is a 4+/5- stars.  The series has many unanswered questions: 9/11/14, rm-24, and, three generations (that apparently follows a paternal line), of clued in clueless men.

I was intrigued most of the time, and found it quite hard to follow (but I like that kind of thing).  If you like a logical story line this is not for you.  If you like observing strange and unexplainable behavior of a very messed up family and the odd people around them when thrown into a situation that they could not possibly understand, then watch the whole thing.  The visuals and photography were outstanding and the cast was awesome -- especially given the script was quirky and many of the lines were (perhap intentionally) stilted and unnatural much of the time.

The dialogue doesn't make sense half the time and acting seems terrible; but its the kind of show where that might be what they were going for. Seriously. I can't tell if it's a terrible hunk of ponyloaf or a profound statement on ... something - and if it is I still haven't figured out what. Every character in it is either an over-the-top a-hole or crazy. It's hard to like or identify with any of them.

Strangest part is that almost everyone involved in this show is experienced and has done extremely good stuff in other shows (SoA, Deadwood, etc). This isn't a bunch of amateurs slapping together a show because HBO wanted to spend money; this is a crew of really talented professionals (creators, directors, actors - everyone) who don't usually do garbage. But ... I'm 8 episodes in and still don't really care about any of the characters, don't like the dialogue and can't stop watching because I keep hoping there will be some profound moment that makes everything come clear.",1446681600,,1154,4.57487922705314

The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the scattered nature of the season's story line, but then Twin Peaks was scattered and still 5 stars.  Maybe it's the era in which Milch created this series, which is far different from the era of Twin Peaks, and America is far more scatterbrained now than in the 80s.

Subtitles will help through dialogue that's occasionally a little hard to follow, whether due to low sound volume or rapid pacing and unusual use of language. Real surfers are featured with real surf sequences, which makes it very nice to look at.  Released in 2007, one or two bits of content are dated now but that doesn't detract.  Professional critics have mentioned that the season closing was rushed due to the show having been cancelled.  It was noticeable to a non-pro like myself, though at least there was closure, and explanations.  For some series that are cancelled early here's no closure at all, one is just left hanging.

3289429,4,B0010XB1WM,"This quirky counter-culture Messiah story, starts out like a low-key simmering walk through the park, lulling you into the personal dramas of the main characters--almost to the point you don't even remember or acknowledge John from Cincinnati himself.  In fact, John is so weird and unintelligible you assume the story is going to be about an autistic man who finds some friends among a highly dysfunctional surfing family.  Well, you'd be wrong.  After the story revs up by the 4th or 5th episode you realize the story is really about what John's oddly Zen presence is doing to these crazy and volatile people.  The story becomes more and more metaphysical and bizarre as John weaves his secret code of magic powers on his new-found family.  By the end, you're not really sure what you just watched, but you wish there was a Season 2!  Other than some convoluted editing and some overacting from De Mornay, Greyson Fletcher as Butchie and the incorrigible Ed O'Neill as Bill Jacks, the story meanders outside the lines and is mostly surprising.  I really hope there's a Season 2.",1444176000,,1080,4.836956521739131

Like Haroun and the Sea of Stories teaches us, here are only a handful of stories in the world, and this is one of those familiars. The story of salvation. Maybe religious, maybe not. We couldn't get enough of it, even when we suspected it was a put-on. The only negative eas Rebecca DeMornay's uncharacteristically awful acting.

You follow an extremely angry family as they argue their way through their miserable lives.

They are just there, living a completely different storyline that doesnt make sense or add any value to the show.

3289612,1,B0010XB1WM,"This comes off as someone completely clueles iss about surf culture trying to make a buck by cashing in on the popularity of the surf culture.  People who live it, know this is crap. Less intelligent people who don't know the culture, might believe we are all this moronic. I don't know, the books these are based on (I haven't read) may be much, much better than the scripts here.

This is not creatively quirky, this is not ""new or fresh"". This show is trying toooooo hard.

Yes, I suffered through the entire thing.  Perversely, I kept waiting for something meaningful to happen. There are only two or three characters who don't cuss with every other word and it's mostly the f-word and various sex acts as cuss words. Hey, I can swear like a sailor, but this was just stupid. It reminds me of kids in school who try to beef out an essay requiring a specific number of words, only this time it was ridiculous profanity. I don't mind it when it's a legitimate part of REAL LIFE conversation, but it seems that the people are all cretins who aren't bright and have extremely limited vocabulary.

Most every character (save three) is exaggerated and completely over the top unbelievable.

The BEST part of this series are the opening shots.  Seriously.

What I liked about this series:  Luis Guzman was the only character whose script gave him something to work with even though it wasn't a lot, some really good scenes with very few clunkers. His natural ability here could have been in any reputable, solid piece and in fact, he's had some great roles. The kid who played Shaun may not be an actor, but for the part, it worked. His sparse dialogue makes the character seem like an old soul, he was likeable.  Ed O'Neill was as good as he could be under the circumstances.

More dislikes:  As fine looking as he is and as good an actor as he is, Bruce Greenwood's character was meh, but not as bad Rebecca de Mornay's character who had ZERO redeeming qualities - she needed serious medication. You could see the white around her eyes in every shot - seriously hyperbitch ready to f-this and that and go Tasmanian Devil on people. Needed a straight jacket.

If you are a Christian, you'll have a lot of profanity to ignore,  but the messiah message is woven throughout the plot line and is very though provoking.

If somehow the ten part acid trip came to a meaningful crescendo with the puzzle pieces set in place in an unraveling revelation, then maybe this might have been a masterpiece. The acting for the most part was well done, the script was incredible and intelligent, drawing the viewer in to watch all ten episodes in anticipation and captivated by how it would all tie together, sad and unfortunate that it just never did. It was almost as if the writer couldn't figure out how to finish it. An unfinished painting that could have been amazing instead of a let down with no real ending. It was actually enjoyable to watch because of the assumption that such a well done series would have to finish well, what a shame, what a disappointment.

Milch, one of the co-creators admitted in an interview that the show was put together too fast and there was not enough respect for the process.  It shows.  I am thankful for the admission because otherwise I would have to believe the show was confusing for the sake of being confusing and I hate that.

There story is incomplete.  There is no beginning or end only a middle unless launching a new clothing line was meant to be the goal.  There is very little character development.  Characters like the chemist, the young Hawaiian, and the Chinese man are introduced with no purpose while other characters like the Doctor fall abruptly out of the story. I am not sure if the actor that played Shawn was told to be a lifeless robot or he could just not act which is bad since the story revolves around him..  The show's title character, John, would have been better off not being in the story at all.  Nichols did a good job with it but all he does is distract.

The purpose of the show is to remind us that we are interconnected no matter how quirky we are or how much baggage we have.  To that I say, ""Thanks for stating the obvious.""

The show does provide some laughs and Ed O'Neil's performance was terrific which is why I am charitably giving this 3 stars.  What is really annoying is that there was potential for a great show.

The total crazy dialogue with great street cussing, characters that are one step away from psycho ward, and John. Hint: faith test in the bible school meaning of faith but without the baggage -- ""You can hear my father..."" ""See god Cass..""

3289785,3,B0010XB1WM,The handful of surfing sequences is the best part--though it's hard to say if there's surfing in every episode (which speaks volumes about the overall show). The cast works as hard to make sense of the script as the characters do their circumstances. The viewer comments are also pretty hilarious and extremely polarized: it seems many folks mistake poorly realized writing as mysterious and highbrow. Too many loose threads and loose screws--though it was somewhat hilarious when Luke Perry's character grew inexplicably agitated and mooned a group of business folks in a meeting.

3289825,4,B0010XB1WM,"This is a quirky series. Parts of it dragged a bit. The constant, recurring anger by DeMornay's character kind of baffled me.

However, if you've lived in Los Angeles or been part of the surfing scene (ever), there's a crazy logic to this story that's addictive. If you liked the old TV series, ""It's Like, You Know"" (ABC 1999 - 2000), you may love this series.

If strong language and loose morals offend you, don't bother with this series. Some of the parenting and relationships in the show are absolutely appalling, too. One element is absolutely nightmarish.

Despite the things that bothered me about this series, I watched the entire season in just a few days. I really wanted to know who (or what) John was... and I'm still not sure.

I'm not sure this series can sustain its entertainment value, especially if DeMornay's character continues her irrational rages. (I want to like her, but her inappropriate antagonism got on my nerves, even before the other shoe dropped, in ""call Child Protective Services"" terms. After that, I flinched whenever she showed up in a scene, apparently oblivious or at least unrepentant about her behaviors.)

The show is well cast and written with style. Even the occasional over-the-top rambles (like the one by the car salesman) are forgiveable as this series explores odd and innovative themes.

For now, I'm looking forward to seeing where the story goes. At the moment, it makes no sense, but there's a logic and symmetry to it. It's difficult to explain, unless you've lived in L.A. or been involved in surfing... and possibly both.

You'll either hate this series or keep watching because... well, it's like... you know... but at the beach.",1435276800,,1687,4.8776223776223775

If you're going to hire a social media team to write fake reviews: 1) Make sure it's not the same person pretending to be various people who just happen to sound like exactly the same person. 2) Make some effort to make the reviews ... sort of almost believable, i.e., see item 1 and maybe don't make all of them 100% faux-gushing in the same exact way.  I'll throw in a #3 to give you some benefit of the doubt. I guess it's sort of, maybe possible that all of these reviews are genuinely 5-star, not written by a marketing team or single writer and are only the freak bi-product of a cloning experiment gone terribly wrong and bringing the five clones together 'coincidentally' on some review page. But ... I just don't think so.  a) This show was painfully bad on almost all fronts. Some of the surfing was pretty cool.  Whatever. 2) People don't speak this way. Anywhere. Ever.  Someone like David Lynch can pull that off & with a purpose. This, does not. Neither in the shows nor in real customer reviews.  And, I guess that's my point on both..  If you're going to not be real, at least be good at it. No?  (PS. The 2 stars was for bringing back Rebecca ... & some of the surfing.)",1434931200,4,1205,4.328888888888889

Has this guy ever had a bad show? This one and Luck are both brilliant and largely ignored by the TV audience (because they were on HBO, maybe?) and cancelled way before their time. You can hear this writer in his characters' dialogue, something rare in a clichd world of TV hacks. And he works with some of the best actors in the business. Deadwood was the pinnacle of the Western genre for me, a modern Gunsmoke that should have lasted much longer than 3 seasons. John and Luck take leaps way outside the box - this one being a tale of a family of surfers (any more details would be spoilers), and Luck basically hovers over high and low denizens of Santa Anita - a welcome change from lawyers and cops and zombies and vamps. TV for adults, yes, but as literate as TV series are ever likely to get. Milch also created NYPD Blue for those of you who remember. Anyways...",1434412800,7,1041,4.371134020618556

The God references were mostly over the top and I'm not sure what the writers intent really was except maybe to in the end save the family members and friends from self destructing.

There is something very special about John and the residents of Imperial Beach with whom he becomes involved. With whom you too will hopefully become involved. I hope you watch it. I hope you love it. If you're cup is empty may John help to fill it again with love for this strange life, on this strange planet, with these strange people. As I said, there are things beyond what you see/percieve/feel on the screen. There is so much more.

It's such an  odd piece, that I think the 'window' between enjoyment and overdose would be quite narrow. I was left wanting more, and happy with that. Several excellent performances.

Much has been written about the hidden meanings behind the show and its characters, and I won't spoil the fun but getting into all that. I believe it was a very underrated program, and still is.

I always enjoyed the dialogue and the characters, and the way it was structures (sort of like a play with a Greek choir). I have to say, it's one of those shows that you either love or hate, as you can see from many reviews. It's hard to explain to people who haven't seen it and know nothing about it, and can be hard to get into if you don't at least give it a chance.

Look no further. It takes real life and fantasy and blends them seamlessly.

The show is about a surfing family who adopt a mystery man from Cincinnati that can do miracles, but is nave about most things. I know that sounds pretty boring, but it is actually very well written.

3289961,3,B0010XB1WM,"John from Cincinatti is flawed, but worth watching if you are a surfer, like surf culture, or want to reminisce about southern cali beach culture.  The mini-series starts out well.  Interesting quirky characters and a bit of magical realism.  If you are a fan of Kem Nun's surf fiction, you will appreciate the concept of the show.
Sadly, about half-way through, the show looses its way.  Magical realism, like chili pepper, is best used sparingly.  Toward the end, JFC becomes fully surreal.  Not that I mind surrealism ... but the change from light magical realism to full-blown surrealism left me feeling dis-jointed and confused.
The other disappointment was the characterization.  Over the course of the show, quirky characters become downright annoying.  Rebecca De Mornay is a good actress.  Her character is believable and multi-faceted at the start.  Yet by the end she is reduced to playing a caricature who screams and cusses her way through every episode.
John visits profound revelations upon the characters which might cause deeply transformative experiences ... yet in spite of profound revelations about her past, DeMornay's character becomes predictable, boring, and annoying.
Likewise, the possibly homosexual ""hoods"" from Hawaii.  Their characters are like bad mental slapstick - they might provide comic relief but they are too annoying to be really funny.
John From Cincinnati had real promise, but didn't live-up to its potential ... ironically like the surfers it portrays.  My BF would give it 4 stars b/c it has some good surf scenes and you will ""recognize"" some of these ""beach type"" characters if you surf in SoCali.  Too bad the show didn't stay on-track with its original concept.",1385683200,,1710,5.174545454545455

3289963,1,B0010XB1WM,"Idiot savant stranger who may have mystical abilities comes to a small (very) sleepy California surf mecca town where half the cast are apparently unemployed and spend their days surfing, smoking pot, selling pot, or randomly bumming around spouting philosophical musings.

A couple of people develop strange, supernatural abilities but are either indifferent to them or more concerned with hiding them than exploring them. As a result, they don't really have much effect on the plot (other than one brief scare). Which makes one wonder why they were written in at all. If Jack has a supernatural ability and is Still boring, than Jack is a Truly dull boy.

If you're higher than a kite on reefer like the writers were, this may be for you. Make sure you're properly cooked before watching and stay that way well after, otherwise you're likely to realize that not much of anything is happening in all the sub plots to nowhere. Episode after episode, it looks like something interesting might happen... then it side tracks, new characters and plots are thrown in, the old ones just kind of linger. Eventually the show is full of loose ends and you realize that the writers just don't know what they are doing.

Clearly, after doing someone a Huge favor by green-lighting this, the execs tossed in the towel and walked away after 10 episodes.

3289980,5,B0010XB1WM,"There isn't much I can say about John From Cincinnati because it really is meant to be a subjective experience.  The plot revolves around the Yost family of Imperial Beach, their friends and acquaintances, and a newcomer by the name of John Monad.
The Yosts have the same problems as we do...dysfunctional family, substance abuse, comfortable ruts, and misplaced priorities.  It isn't until circumstances are changed/put in motion by the X Factor (John) that the family begins to come together.

Another show by David Milch of Deadwood fame, JFC premiered right after the screen went blank on the Sopranos.  I watched the show faithfully, week-to-week, and was drawn in by what I saw was a show that was unlike ANYTHING I had ever seen.  At the end of the 10 season run (JFC was never picked up for a 2nd season), I had far more questions than answers.  It took all I had to not send an angry letter to HBO for wasting my time.  I am reasonably intelligent and just paid attention to a show for nearly 10 hours only to be left in the dark?  Thankfully I had recorded the episodes as I went, and I gave it a 2nd watch (this time, not waiting a week between episodes).  The birds began singing, the clouds parted, and after the 10th episode ended for the second time, I was given a new perspective and had many of my core beliefs reaffirmed.  At base level, this is a story about family, evolution, human nature, and how each and every one of us is a product of our past.  Just as one random negative event can send a ripple through a group of people for years to come, so can a random positive event.

Because this is Milch on HBO, the language is coarse and explicit situations/themes are around every corner.  For me, this makes the story that much more genuine.  I KNOW these kinds of people, and this is they way they talk.  The actors, many of whom had worked with Milch on his previous shows, were sometimes made to improvise or were just given scripts the morning of the shoot.  While this seems like a risky move, it pays off over and over again.  The cast is what makes this show.  Whether it is the familiar faces of Ed O Neil, Luke Perry, Rebecca Demornay, Sean Paul Gosselar, Luis Guzman, or Garret Dillahunt (the new ""Im in everyting on TV"" guy)...or the new faces like surfers Keala Kennelly and Greyson Fletcher, the characters are extreme, but believable.  You know these people..they are an extension of your family and friends.

I have purchased 6 copies of JFC at this point...4 of them off of Amazon...and have had 100% success rate with the people I have gifted the show to.  That said, not everyone ""gets"" this show....and that is OK.  It didn't get cancelled after 1 season because it was a bad show, but it also didn't get picked up because it isn't easily accessible to the general population.  It is a deep show that doesnt provide all of the answers.  The season isn't wrapped up in a pretty pink bow and many questions are left unanswered, but this is the perfect show for someone who appreciates a show that makes them think.  The answers you get from viewing will mean so much more than the answers the show could give you.  A true masterpiece.",1324080000,8,3173,4.484320557491289
3289981,3,B0010XB1WM,"First of all the series lasted just one season and got canceled so don't expect too much closure to the story. There is an ending (or is it a beginning of a new chapter for all these characters?) but I'm not spoiling it for those of you interested in this unique HBO series.

Secondly, it takes place in a surfing community but that is really just a porthole into these people's lives. It is more about how preconceived notions can be turned around 180 and a community and family can come together and get past judging people based on their job, choice of lifestyle, appearance, etc. That sounds like a simple and nicely wrapped up synopsis but once you start watching this series, you'll wonder why it takes such a convoluted route to reach that conclusion.

""John From Cincy"" is definitely weird and seems like a second division ripoff of ""Twin Peaks,"" but well worth watching mainly because of the interesting characters. I will say although John, as a sort of mirror that reflects back the reality of these people's lives, is the main driving force he is more an annoying Rain Man than anything else.

To be honest, the creator of this series comes across like he dropped way too much acid in the '60s and his head is filled with some magical and lyrical poetry that only he can comprehend. When it's spit out onto the screen, it can be thicker than pea soup to paddle through. Not that it's not worth sticking with this series episode to episode. Just be forewarned your brain may explode trying to figure out what it all means.

Seeing Luke Perry and a porn actress turned born-again mom become an item, Rebecca de Mornay as a screaming lunatic of a grandma (a grandma?), the guy from WKRP (Howard Hesseman) as an old hippy dippy drug casualty, the ""Married With Children"" dad (Ed O'Neill) as a retired cop who ""talks"" to his pet birds and Carrie's gay friend from ""Sex and the City"" (Greyson Fletcher) as a surf-loving easygoing and nice guy lawyer are all worth the price of admission.

The soundtrack is beyond awesome. The opening credit montage with Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros doing ""Johnny Appleseed"" to the closing credits on episode 1 with the awesome ""Sun Rise Light Flies"" by Kasabian as surfers ride those waves is magic. Lastly, the ""sound"" of the surf in beach scenes where no music, no dialogue is on, you can almost feel like it's coming through your TV screen. Very hard to explain but it captures the way beaches are and how powerful the sea is.

Now before I go as weird on you, I would say this series is not for everyone and I can understand people tuning out after one or two episodes. My advice is, if you stuck with ""Twin Peaks"" through season two, you can at least give this a shot.",1321833600,,2717,4.5234215885947044

The plot script and dialogue in this movie is so hideously poor, it seems almost certain that it was intentionally made to flop.  Who could possibly think this was even slightly good???

Every shot, every moment I found myself completely enthralled - or more accurately - caught in the web the production team spun to trap those of us who do crave creativity in television.

The Family Yost, the surrounding community, the hangers on and most of all, John - wander in and out of an altered reality as though both residents of another dimension and characters in a Greek Tragedy.
This is clearly not a show for those who need their storytelling neatly told and wrapped up with a bow and cries of it being ""garbage"" or ""crap"" tell us more about the viewer than the series.

My take:  it's partly rooted in the Six Feet Under mode, along with undercurrents from Being There (Peter Sellers).  There's an element of Parsifal in the mix also.  Spot on script and acting.

I was expecting it as a Christmas present but when that failed, I ended up buying it for an unbelievable price. Thanks Amazon for price update notices on the wish list.

I gave it a 4 because there was way too much profanity.  Yes I am an adult, but it was embarrassing for people to say it reminded me of things I would talk about regarding my surfing years, and none of my friends talked like that.  They were very respectful.

I feel that I would only recommend this show for older viewers, and for them please not to think that all surfers are like the ones in the television series.

3289994,4,B0010XB1WM,"There has been so much description of this show, I don't want to add more. I watched all episodes in a day and a half- almost overloaded I would say. Yet it is quirky and anti-climactic.

The main character Grandpa Mitch (Bruce Greenwood) departs half-way through and only returns during the final two episodes. Which leaves Grandma Cissy (Rebecca De Mornay)to scream curses at anyone who walks on scene. She is described as a ball-buster, yet this seems a convenient cover for the missing Greenwood who may have been off with other acting commitments.(I don't know if the is true, just a thought...)

Ultimately everything appears to be about the 14-year old boy Shaun, (Greyson Flecher) who is very appealing and really surfs well. He is killed and resurrected, disappears but is found and disappears again only to be found again with the very convenient answer to everything. Yet whenever the youngster is in trouble, every character in the show drops whatever they are doing and searches for him- even drug-dealing mobsters just in from Hawaii!  I loved all the characters and their interactions, it adds some of the magic to the show. Yet they all want to be this kid's parent (uncle, auntie) and lament their flaws so much how can a 14 year old respect them?

Okay so this isn't 'Titanic' or 'Lord of the Rings' in scope, a modern Divine Comedy maybe. Yet, except for Flecher most of the actors are experienced, familiar and quirky. Isn't that what we expect from a HBO series? Despite the flaws, I like it enough to purchase it and am recommending it to you.",1271376000,2,1565,4.721611721611722

3289997,4,B0010XB1WM,"The Yosts are a dysunctional family that contains three generations of surfing royalty. Mitch Yost (Bruce Greenwood), the patriarch, is a surfing champ whose career was ended by an injury; Butch Yost (Brian Van Holt), Mitch's son, who seemed poised to follow in his father's footsteps until his career was cut short by drug addiction; and Shaun Yost (Greyson Fletcher), Butch's son, who is known as a surfing prodigy but is hampered from joining contests by his guardian Mitch who doesn't want to see him follow in his or Butch's footsteps. But when the mysterious John (Austin Nichols) shows up their lives are changed by miracles and other occurences that bring them closer together.

David Milch is a god of television. Milch created such powerhouses as Deadwood and NYPD Blue, as well as writing for shows as LA Law, Brooklyn South, and Hill Street Blues. His love for language makes for some of the most colorful scripts you will ever hear committed to the screen as can be attested to by anyone who's watched Deadwood (if you haven't watched it, go check it out today). After Deadwood ended in it's third season, Milch went on to work on John From Cincinnati. Utilizing a lot of the same actors as can be seen in Deadwood, with a few fresh faces that you'll recognize from other TV shows and movies, John From Cincinnati is a very ambitious TV show that appears to only have lasted one season. The big question is: did it deserve more.

I would say so. John From Cincinnati is brilliantly written taking twists and turns not common for TV, making it a very original show. Touching on moments of existentialism, belief in God, drug abuse, redemption, and so on, John From Cincinnati is the type of show I wish would be made more often. The characters are well developed, with their own quirks, hangups, and problems that all feel real and fit the actors perfectly, and the storyline takes twists and turns that you'd never expect. This isn't your typical cliched television show.

The acting is superb, and in many cases I would say that it's some of it's actors best work. Of these, the two standouts in my mind are Ed O'Neill and Brian Van Holt. Ed O'Neill as Bill Jacks, a former cop and friend of the Yosts, plays a man who is still adjusting to life without a badge and without his wife. He gets the meatiest lines of the show, and, in my opinion, gives some of his best acting work apart from his performance as the patriarch in Modern Family. Brian Van Holt has a little more of a wall to climb playing the drug addicted failure of a son who's heard one too man times that he's a loser and needs to get off the drugs, but the way he portrays it makes you feel every tick from messed up to jonesing and beyond. You feel him when he tries to redeem himself and find his way back into a better relationship with his son.

But I have to fault the series for being a bit too impenetrable at times and even a tad bit pretentious. At times the show is too clever and self aware of it, Milch and his writing seem to be trying to send a message, and try to hard to rap the message in an enigma in something of an attempt to show off. I still can't tell you that I know what all of it means, and maybe I will eventually figure it out on future viewings and while the rewatchability factor is a strength of the show, it's also it's weakness.

All in all, I would highly recommend the show. The dialogue is brilliant and just fun to listen to, and the acting is superb. The movie works on various levels from comedy to drama and beyond and is highly entertaining.

Intriguing characters get no story arc, do not evolve. As a viewer I tried to keep the faith, grasping at straws, giving Milch the benefit of the doubt. ""maybe it'll get better at the end"" ""maybe some if not all things will be explained..."" Actually, I was just trying to forget that these were 10 hours of my life I was not ever going to reclaim. The tenth episode must rate as one of the most pitiful end to a series, ever, with, I kid you not, the climax of this HBO series being a parade of six cars on a waterfront to peddle new swimwear ;-)

This is not your typical HBO, or any other network for that matter, show.  I think you need to be able to do three things to appreciate this show.  1) Have a more-or-less spiritual point of view on life, 2) Be willing to live with ambiguity for a little while, and 3) Have compassion for the humans.

If you can do those three things, you may love this show.  I did.  I have watched the season twice, and will probably watch it again once or twice a year.

This was a spectacular show with a tremendous balance of mystery, revelations, great acting performances, superb casting and terrific story development.

Rebecca de Mornay may have provided her best performance ever.  You probably have never seen someone who allows her ball-busting demons such free reign.  Her bitch roots might startle you, but they are presented quickly and then left behind in the dust of yet another set of revelations.

I couldn't decide how I felt about Greyson Fletcher's performance.  It was either a very weak performance, or Shaun was supposed to be a blank slate and character development was cut off by the premature cancelling of the show.

Willie Garzon, Luiz Guzman, Dayton Callie, Paul Ben-Victor and especially Ed O'Neill form a brilliant tribe of support characters for this story line.

Unfortunately it was cancelled and we are left hanging.  I would very much like the show's creators to provide some sort of wrap up for the project for clarification.

The first season of that series is in my view the best single season of any program in history...well, it was until John From Cincinnati. They are neck and neck.
The creativity is extraordinary. The conversations between characters is dance like...in fact if you loved the dialogue in DEADWOOD you will love this.

Remember when you were a kid and you could run up to a group of children your own age that were say;digging a hole to China or building some contraption?. You didn't know them and they didn't know you, but within seconds you were participating in something. That is the magical quality in human beings(lost by the time we are adults) that is depicted in JFC. That quality is our salvation. We have but to re-connect with it.
The series helps in that effort just a bit, so that makes it more than worthwhile.

The dialog is so ""cutting edge"" (they're speaking ""Imperial Beach-ese"", or ""IB"" as they call it because they're all so cool) that they might as well be speaking a foreign language.  I love foreign films, but not when they're speaking English.  Most of the characters have no purpose at all to the story (what little story there is, and even that's not interesting), including the title character.

Only two or three noteworthy things happened in the whole series.  I started to listen to the commentary on the first episode, by the creator David Milch, but didn't finish - he's a very angry, cynical man, and just scary - I very much disliked listening to him (part of his commentary was mentioning that he'd love to follow someone home who'd cut him off on the highway and kill them - or maybe it was beat the crap out of them, I don't remember.)  In episode 7, I think, there was a ""dream"" - not really, but everyone ended up in the same place talking real, true nonsense.

Prior to watching ""John"", I was under the impression that HBO produced *good* shows that really draw you in.  I was sadly wrong.  This show was a convoluted mess, waiting for it's plug to be pulled from day one.

Unfortunately, as I again thought HBO made good shows (I also saw all the seasons of Six Feet Under -- BEST SHOW EVER!), both my wife and I thought (after watching the first episode of ""John""), *clearly* it will get better.  So we watched the second episode.

The show was even worse.

But again...  HBO produces quality shows -- perhap's were missing something...  Or perhaps it just takes a bit of time to warm up to, so we watched the third episode.

The TV in the hotel room had cable, including HBO. On this particular night I was flicking through all the channels looking for something to watch, and I came across an episode of HBO's newest series at the time, ""John from Cincinnati"". I had heard from a few TV critics that this show wasn't very good. But I decided to watch the episode that aired, and it looked like an interesting show. So when it came out on DVD, I wanted to get it so that I could watch all 10 episodes. Well I have seen all 10 episodes, and I have to give ""John from Cincinnati"" a mixed review.

This very strange and bizarre series takes place over nine eventful days as we follow an assortment of characters from Imperial Beach, California (a town which lies south of San Diego and north of the U.S.-Mexico border). Much of the action focuses on the very dysfunctional Yost family, which has three generations of surfers. The patriarch is Mitch Yost, who was once a top-notch surfer until an injury cut his surfing career short. Eventually he passed his surfing genes onto his son Butchie, who turned out to be a very good surfer as well. But things started to go downhill for Butchie when he started using drugs, which (as the show starts) is ruining his life. While Mitch is the first Yost surfer and Butchie the second Yost surfer, the third Yost surfer comes in the form of Butchie's teenage son Shaun, who is being raised by Mitch and his wife Cissy, since Butchie's drug use puts him in no condition to raise his own son. Shaun loves surfing and wants to follow in his father's and grandfather's footsteps. The Yost clan owns a surf shop which Cissy runs along with Kai, a female surfer (and family friend of the Yost's) who occasionally looks after Shaun and has a sweet little relationship with Butchie. Other acquaintances of the Yost family include retired police officer Bill Jacks, who spends most of his time talking to his bird Zippy; Ramon, the manager of an old, broken down motel where Butchie is currently living; and Linc Stark, a surfing agent who once represented Butchie and is now pursuing to represent Shaun. Other characters include Cass, a young woman who (in the beginning) poses as a filmmaker working for Linc; Barry Cunningham, the new owner of that run down motel; Meyer Dickstein, another motel employee who usually works alongside Ramon; Tina Blake, a porn actress who happens to be Shaun's mother; Steady Freddy Lopez, a criminal who has a past with Butchie; and Palaka, Freddy's henchman. Their lives are all pretty much routine, that is until a mysterious stranger appears and proceeds to change their lives. That stranger is John Monad (aka John from Cincinnati). He's very dim, acts childlike much of the time, and constantly mimics the words of what the other characters around him say to his face. John repeatedly says things to people as if the world is coming to an end or something. Not to mention spiritual situations start happening to some of the members of the Yost clan. For example, in the first episode Mitch discovers that he can hover several inches off the ground, which he has no idea why. Also in episode one a dead bird comes back to life. In episode two a surfer suffers a life-threatening injury and ends up in a coma. The same bird gives that injured surfer a peck on the cheek and immediately wakes up and is completely healed. Is John the one behind all of this? Is he some supernatural force that needs to be reckoned with?

Throughout the 10 episodes, I found ""John from Cincinnati"" to run hot and cold. I thought the first three episodes were pretty good as I got to know these people. Then the show when kind of dull with the next four episodes, before finally coming back for a bright wrap-up with the final three episodes. The cast features some good acting from the cast, but I found only two characters to be truly memorable: teenage surfer Shaun Yost and retired cop Bill Jacks. These two characters are brought to life by two terrific actors: one a newcomer and the other a TV veteran (who made us laugh for over ten years playing one of the most popular TV patriarchs of all time). The newcomer is Greyson Fletcher, who in real life is a teen skater and gets to display some of that talent in a few episodes of this show. ""John from Cincinnati"" marks his acting debut and he does a terrific job in his first time out as an actor. I look forward to seeing more of this young talent in the years to come. The TV veteran who comes off great on this show is Ed O'Neill, who if you remember played the occasionally grouchy Al Bundy for 11 seasons on the popular '80s-'90s sitcom ""Married with Children"". O'Neill is on hand to provide most of the comic relief here, and as usual does a great job. The best scenes of this show are the ones where Shaun and Bill are on screen together. Those moments are wonderful. Only problem is there's not enough of them. I would have liked to have seen more scenes with Fletcher and O'Neill onscreen together, but unfortunately that doesn't happen, and that's because there are way too many unnecessary characters that we have to get to know, and I feel that they really don't need to be here. And that's the first of many problems that ""John from Cincinnati"" has.

Bruce Greenwood and Rebecca De Mornay are good as the head of the Yost clan, but they have been better in other projects in the past. Plus I was constantly laughing every time the Rebecca De Mornay character got angry, which was quite often. Did the writers have to make her character (Cissy) so mad almost all the time? (Get a load of one scene early in episode five -- the trailer sequence -- where De Mornay overacts so uproariously that it made me laugh out loud to the point where I had to stop the DVD because it made me laugh so hard.) Same goes for Brian Van Holt, who plays Butchie. In the first episode, Van Holt acts so angry most of the time that I thought this was going to be one of the most aggravating characters in television history. But as the show progressed over the next nine episodes, his character actually settled down and didn't act so mad as he did in episode one. This makes the Cissy Yost character the angriest one on the show. But to be perfectly honest, ""John from Cincinnati"" does work when the focus is on the Yost family. When the focus is on Mitch, Cissy, Butchie, Shaun, Bill the cop, Kai the surfer girl (played by another newcomer, Keala Kennelly), Tina the porn actress (played by Chandra West, who doesn't appear until episode four), and the mysterious John (played by Austin Nichols, who plays the childlike role well by not going over the top), the show is at its best. The show is at its worst when it focuses on all the other characters, mainly the ones at that motel. Luis Guzman (Ramon) is a good actor and I've liked him in the past, but he really doesn't belong here. He's actually good on this show, but to what point? He's stuck in the most uninteresting part of the show. The two other characters at that motel (employee Meyer and owner Barry) aren't very interesting either. And that leads to the two most annoying characters on the whole show: the criminals Steady Freddy Lopez and his henchman Palaka, who just happen to be rooming at that same motel. It drove me crazy watching these two guys interact on the screen, and they almost single handedly ruin the show. Take these two characters out of ""John from Cincinnati"" and the show would get four stars.

But in the end, I can only give ""John from Cincinnati"" three stars. And that's too bad. This show had potential. There are many good things about it. But in the end there was just too much, and some of the things on hand weren't that great, and that includes the fantasy element. This is a drama series that throws in a few fantasy moments just to grab our attention, and it really doesn't work. Ironically, this show made its debut just after the final episode of ""The Sopranos"" ended. Most ""Sopranos"" viewers were so ticked off by the ending of that series that they didn't even bother to check this series out. In fact a lot of people didn't bother to check this series out. Reviews were mostly bad, and it never caught fire in the ratings. ""John from Cincinnati"" was cancelled after the final episode aired, and maybe that was for the best. This show was far from being a classic, but I think if it had to be reworked into a better show, I believe it might work as a half-hour comedy series. Just get rid of the unnecessary characters (about half of them), focus on the Yost clan and a few of their friends, and you might have something.",1209340800,5,8725,4.492443324937028
3290019,5,B0010XB1WM,"Cancelled after one 10-episode season, each episode of JFC overflows with dry humor and religious symbolism. It is perhaps one of the most thought provoking series on television recently. The humor is dry and often dark, and if you're not paying attention you may miss some great lines. It's riveting to see how the plot and characters develop over the series, and many (but certainly not all) of the mysteries are answered by the end. Speaking of the characters, there are some classic ones, like ""Barry the Fairy,"" who won the Mega-Millions after an epileptic vision gave him the winning numbers. Butchy Yost walks the tightrope between humor and tragedy like few characters on any series. Also impressive is the way JFC captures the Imperial Beach atmosphere. If you were a fan of the series already, the DVDs will let you catch some of the stuff you may have missed on the first pass. If you didn't see the series on cable, here's your chance to see one of the best series in recent years.",1207872000,10,993,4.68

Brilliant writing, dialogue, characters, actors, photography.  Several of the actors are from Milch's other brilliant series, Deadwood and they are equally as good here.  HBO chose to premiere this show immediately after the Sopranos, which was a mistake because it's a very different viewing experience.  It was set up for failure because of that and HBO didn't properly support the show.  I watched each episode several times and my understanding and enjoyment increased with each viewing.  I highly recommend the DVD box set.  Milch's commentary alone is worth the price.",1207180800,9,704,5.168141592920354

  While the show had some great moments and solid acting, I can't fathom why anyone would want to own this half-baked series -- but then I guess there are some who like to eat half-cooked batter with a spoon and call it a culinary delight.
  Milch's idiosycratic dialogue worked perfectly in the mouths of Deadwood's denizens but similar lines sounded absurd coming from his surfer dudes and assorted oddballs. This ill-fated show simply never got its feet on solid ground.
  If he'd had another season to bring it all together, Milch might've been able to pull it off but as it stands now, ""John From Cincinnati"" is mostly Driftwood From Milch.",1206921600,4,873,4.786666666666667

I am also disappointed that there will be no further episodes, and that Milch has left a lot of questions unanswered.

Rather than go into specifics, I would just like to point out that, as of this writing, all ratings here on Amazon.com are either 5 stars or 1 star.  I think that pretty much tells the story - people either really liked this show or really hated it, there is no in-between!

3290026,5,B0010XB1WM,"The excellent writing is often lost beneath the torrents of expletives -- but -- if you can get past that, JFC is totally engrossing.  Miracles, mysterious figures, mysticism, surfing!  The series was cut short to 10 episodes (from 13), so the series finale is a bit hurried.  But the opening sequence (and Bob Dylan music) for that last episode is truly moving, given all that happened on the show's run.

So, giving JFC one star is right enough for those who don't get it, but those that do get it, 5 are not enough.

We won't see more of this show, and maybe we don't need to.  It was great for what it was.  If you're undecided, rent it.  It's worth it.

Too bad it was so far out of the mainstream that the average Joe couldn't see it for the truly wonderful and uniquely appealing show that it was.
