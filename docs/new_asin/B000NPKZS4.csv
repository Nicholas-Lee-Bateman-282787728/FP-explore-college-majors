At first, I thought the movie was going to turn out to be another typical story of love, vengence, and the family sacred martial arts.  It is all of that, but also it is about fate, circumstances, and the choices the characters make.  The love story is a bit like Romeo & Juliet.  They need to overcome many obstacles to be together.  The martial arts is from stunts and choreography, not special effects.  The story is based after a Korean movie.  The actors are a combination of Korean and Chinese actors.  I think the actors did a great job portraying the evolution of their characters.  I loved the ending.  Often times, these drama series end with everyone living happily ever after, or with a really sad ending, or with an ending that just leaves us hanging.  This ending made me go ""wow"".  It made sense given the story.

The Taiseng release is in Cantonese and Mandarin with Chinese and English subtitle options.  There is a Korean release too from a Korean company.",1268524800,3,1082,4.510309278350515
2777135,4,B000NPKZS4,"Bi Chun Mu: Dance with Sword is a Chinese made version after the Korean movie, Binchunmoo.  It is a TV drama series that total 7 DVD discs (33 episodes) and a total of 1,485 minutes.  Korean and Chinese dramas are what we consider daytime soaps such as ""General Hospital"" or ""As the World Turn"".

Over the years, these movies have gained a lot of followings among many types of people in America.  What makes these shows interesting is it's not your tradition Soap shows of never ending love triangles that spans over decades.  These shows actually have a beginning and an ending.

This movie is about a Korean orphan of nobility who was raised by someone he knows as uncle.  The main hero is named Jin Ha, whose family holds a sword and a book that teaches the most powerful martial arts.  It is believed that whoever obtained these two shall rule the world.  Asian drama isn't drama unless it's revolve around love and love triangles and in Bi Chun Mu, they don't disappoint.

This movie is about Liu Jan (hero), Snowy (his love), Jun Guang (his best friend). Liu Jan's main interest is Snowy, a General's daughter.  Jun Guang, a wealthy and affluent member of society who became friends with Liu Jan and admires Liu Jan's heroism.  Such a tragic love story from the start.  They were never meant to be together but somehow fate allows them to meet each other only to be torn by it later.  The three's relationship is doom long before their births but unknowing to them.

As time passes, Jun Guang develops feelings for Snowy and later can no longer fight those urges and begins his plot against Liu Jan that will change all their lives forever and allowing the dark past to come to light.  Liu Jan survived his friend's betrayal and unable to return to his love, Snowy made Liu Jan turned bitter, cold, and heartless.  Years go by and he returns to unleash his anger, hatred, and vengeance upon all those who have done him wrong.  Liu Jan is no longer that innocent, naive boy but a vicious killer hired by another powerful noble family trying to take control of China.  With his hatred and their power, they slash through China and anyone who stood in their way where quickly put down.

This movie is a little bit of ""Romeo and Juliet"" with ""The Count of Monte Cristo"".  Remember, this drama series is made for TV and not for Movie Theater.  Special effects are very basic and average.  If you are expecting Jet Li's ""Hero"", ""Crouching Tiger"", or ""House of Flying Dagger"", you'll be disappointed.  There is no beautiful camera shot or colorful scenes.  The show is shot in camera view....like Day Time Soap.  At times, the fight scenes are blurry.  With 33 episodes, it drags sometimes but overall, it keeps pace.  Compare to other Asian TV Drama, it's pretty good.  Much faster pace than ""The Seven Swordsman"" and equal with ""The Emperor of the Sea"" but less dramatic.  Not so much of the going back and forth story line that drags forever.  The only way to watch shows like this is an hour or two every day or every other day.  Despite the long episodes, once you get into the movie, time seems to fly by quickly and before you know it, it's time to put another DVD in.

What makes Bi Chun Mu interesting that even a guy like me don't mind watching is that there are enough action and a decent story line to follow.  Did I forget to mention that the women in these shows are simply breath taking?  I think that's my REAL reason I watch it.  For you ladies, the guys aren't too shabby themselves.  It's just not the same old, over the hill, people sleeping around with everyone they can get their hands on like American Day time Soaps.  If you have seen Binchunmoo, the Korean movie, you will definitely enjoy this drama series.  In my opinion is that this show sticks with many of the ""MAIN POINTS"" in the original movie.  Many scenes that I watched and can quickly reference back to the movie.  Of course, not everything is the same, but enough similarities that you can trace back to the original movie.  It keeps the essence/spirit of the movie within it.  But at the same time, it expands and explains more in detail of how things happen.  Some scenes and story were changed but not far enough to if you were a fan of the movie, you'd be disappointed.",1221091200,11,4261,4.499348109517601
8180448,4,B000NPKZS4,"This is great show with a sad yet beautiful love story and cool martial arts. I heard there's a Korean language version out there, but I've never seen it. I think a Korean version might be better. On this DVD set there are Cantonese and Mandarin versions, I like Mandarin better. If you like Bichunmoo movie which is based on the same story, then this drama is for you. I wsh it was an HD version because this one looks a bit washed out.",1516665600,,437,4.214285714285714
