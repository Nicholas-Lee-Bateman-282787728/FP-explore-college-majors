5078942,5,B007CZ3418,"This was a fun movie.  I found the action (and there's plenty of it) to be wholely engrossing and the flying scenes are awesome.  Interesting cast with Nick Carter (former Back Street Boy...acts better than he sings), Brandon Quinn (The Entourage), Tom Arnold, and Natalia somebody-or-other (didn't catch her name but she's way hot).  Shawnee Smith (also way hot)too...can't forgot her.

I recommend it.  It's just a plain old fast action movie with solid special effects and a good blend of humor.",1340496000,,498,5.024390243902439
5078943,5,B007CZ3418,"I really loved this movie!! Definitely moments that had me on the edge of my seat! It's not what I would typically would watch, but I am happy I did and have already recommended it to other friends.",1339632000,,198,4.2368421052631575
5078946,1,B007CZ3418,"Major plot points involving airplanes could have used some actual research on airplanes or drug runners to make them at all interesting or believable... :-)  Note to author: The point of flying low is so the planes are NOT SEEN on radar.  And how does a prop plane avoid a scouting jet?  Even someone who's never flown could make up stuff a lot more fun than ""fly around until it runs out of fuel"" -- which was used not once but TWICE! BORING",1377302400,,442,4.301204819277109
5078947,5,B007CZ3418,I like this movie it was different then most at least they used airplanes and a movie showing how they get into the country using them/.,1375747200,,136,4.269230769230769
5078948,1,B007CZ3418,"My fiancee made me watch this with her because she's had a lifelong crush on Andrew Keegan since the 90's.

And even she thought this movie was terrible.

The acting is awful across the board, by far the worse offender being Backstreet Boy Nick Carter. Andrew Keegan, to his credit, is the best actor in this movie, but that's not saying a whole lot.

The script is dumb and is not believable in the slightest.  I know this is a budget film, but the photography, direction, and editing are all WAY below par.  It tries to be stylized with frequent overuse of slow motion and a lot of unnecessary quick camera cuts (it's made in the style of like a homeless man's version of Tony Scott or Michael Bay), but they are distracting and add absolutely nothing to this movie.

The pacing is atrocious as well. It's an hour and 50 minutes but feels nearly twice as long.

I did enjoy making fun of the movie the entire time I watched it with my fiancee though, so it has that kind of entertainment value going for it.",1370044800,2,1009,4.363636363636363
5078949,5,B007CZ3418,Great action flick although the beginning was crappy with Tom Arnold getting head from a drugged up broad that looked like a zombie.,1366156800,,132,4.782608695652174
5078950,5,B007CZ3418,I WAS AT ONE OF MY BROTHER HOME VISITING EVERYBODY WANTED TO SEE A MOVIE THAT WAS LONG . I HAD ANOTHER BROTHER HAVING SURGERY,1364860800,,125,4.04
5078951,3,B007CZ3418,"The plot, theme, and acting in this movie aren't so good.  This movie is about eye candy and aviation enthusiasts.",1361923200,2,114,4.7
5078952,5,B007CZ3418,I haven't watched the movie yet but the previews looked soo good and I bought it because of course Nick Carter is in it!!,1359849600,,121,4.083333333333333
5078953,4,B007CZ3418,"Enjoyed the movie. It was entertaining. I enjoyed the airplanes, as there were some unique aircraft in the movie, like the one designed by aviator Burt Rutan. The Rutan VariEze is the cool canard design aircraft in the movie.

The stunts and special effects were very good for a low budget movie, and rivaled many big budget blockbusters.

Now as for My favorite Actress. A Playboy Playmate, and fashion model, as well as a successful Actress and businesswoman, Irina Voronina is one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, and even though She only has a small part, She shines on screen. Definitely the highlight of the movie for Me.",1359504000,,636,4.7727272727272725
5078954,1,B007CZ3418,"The movie bears virtually no connection to the reality of aviation - so much so that I could not get past the ""hoakiness"" if that's how you spell the word. The rest of the movie isn't much better. Do yourself a favor - watch paint dry instead.",1353801600,2,243,4.191489361702128
5078955,5,B007CZ3418,"I very much enjoyed this dvd!  Very suspenseful, intriguing, funny!  I highly recommend it to others! It's a ride you won't forget!  Lol.",1350432000,,137,4.869565217391305

There was 5 minutes at the very start of the movie where Tom Arnold had a funny scene but then this movie crashed and burned!",1380585600,,279,4.185185185185185
