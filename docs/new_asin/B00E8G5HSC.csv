8602449,4,B00E8G5HSC,Sound was so bad we had to mute and watch with sub-titles. I don't recommend you watch it because the sound.,1388188800,,108,4.190476190476191
8602450,5,B00E8G5HSC,I've gone through this as well and all I can say is parents that lose a child should watch this film.,1387756800,,101,3.857142857142857
8602451,3,B00E8G5HSC,"I wish this topic had been explored in more realistic terms.
The desire of ""normalcy"" after a ""close to home"" life event is real. But somehow parts of this movie falls short.
The time line of the emotions experienced, and especially the opening scenes simply does not fall into ""real life"" scenarios and rings false.
Nevertheless I'm glad I saw it.",1387497600,,348,4.721311475409836
8602452,4,B00E8G5HSC,"This isn't my typical film genre. I'm more an action, destruction kind of film viewer, but Leland Orser is such an incredible actor I just had to see this, and I wasn't disappointed.

It's not immediately known that the central characters have lost their only son to an accident as they both go through their own grievances of blaming one another, blaming themselves. It's a very compelling look into the lives of adoring parents trying to cope with the loss of their little boy and the trials they go through to find one another again. A Must see!",1385424000,,548,4.591836734693878
8602453,4,B00E8G5HSC,Well done character driven story.  Sad but true and illustrates the profound results of the loss of a child.  Very well acted,1383696000,,125,4.636363636363637
8602454,1,B00E8G5HSC,Awful movie. Never felt for the characters even though they had suffered tremendous loss. Unrealistic and over the top behavior that became tedious. The young man who appeared for a short time was the only refreshing respite from the unwatchable movie.,1383436800,,252,5.170731707317073
8602455,4,B00E8G5HSC,"The quality of this film-festival type production is excellent, but it's not for everyone.

Without giving away all the story, it is a very sad film about loss and grief.  The 'Morning' title is a play on words for 'Mourning.'  It's a fairly free-form character study of those who have lost, and those around who have to deal, or not deal, with those who have experienced a tragic loss.

Jeanne Tripplehorn is phenomenal.  Writer/Director Leland Orser is also good; however, his character spends the 2nd half of the movie going through some very bizarre ways of dealing with grief.  The stellar supporting cast is excellent.

But I'm not going to lie.  It's a sad, heavy movie and a study of what not to do, what not to say, to someone who is experiencing loss.",1381276800,2,761,4.626865671641791
