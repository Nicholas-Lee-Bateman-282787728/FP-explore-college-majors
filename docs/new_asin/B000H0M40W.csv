8135549,4,B000H0M40W,"This was for my ex-daughter in law who died giving birth to twins girls. they are wonderful and have driven Grief from the door! They are so self=confident as they always have a confidant. you cannot correct one without the other charging in the room to make sure you do not get out of hand. Twins are beautiful,,they are great and fascinating to be with. Mine are now 4 -year granddaughters and despite their beautiful 7 year old sister they get the attention--yes it is unfair. The DVD helped my former daughter-in-law prepare and understand but unfortunately she did not oe to see the beauty she spawned. Good film but somwhat dated by recent research.",1356652800,,655,4.7043478260869565
8135550,5,B000H0M40W,I recently taught a class on TWINS at our local university through its OLLI program for Senior Citizens.  I used this DVD during the first class after an hour of lecture.  It was very well received and extremely interesting.  I am an identical twin myself so it was particularly interesting to me and to the twins and relatives of twins who took the class.,1299024000,,356,4.53125

The students enjoyed the video, but they seemed to be a little bored at times. All-in-all, I would say that I'm glad that I purchased the DVD and I will continue to show it to my future classes.",1232323200,,312,4.305084745762712
