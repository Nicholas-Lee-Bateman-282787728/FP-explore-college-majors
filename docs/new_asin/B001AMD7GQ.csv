8277974,1,B001AMD7GQ,"Not at all what I expected or hoped for. The cover and description of the video suggests this is going to be based on your your direct connection and love of True, NOT all of your musings you've experienced away from True and wish to communicate to ""him"". Seriously disappointing.",1523750400,,280,4.62

8277976,4,B001AMD7GQ,"Beautiful love letter from Bruce Weber to beautiful people, his golden labs, jazz and the ocean.  Mix all that in with voiceovers from Julie Christie, Marianne Faithfull, old footage of Dirk Bogarde and Elizabeth Taylor, lots of dogs and their owners, and throw in some anti-war rhetoric, and you have an intensely personal film made for enjoying, not over analyzing.  I loved it.",1471824000,2,380,5.015873015873016

8277978,4,B001AMD7GQ,"This is an interesting collage of dog fun and war sadness.  Bruce Weber, the writer-director of this documentary, may be best known for his documentary on the troubled life of jazz trumpet player Chet Baker, ""Let's Get Lost"" (1989).  ""A Letter to True"" is a strange but intriguing ant-war, pro-peace collage that spins from funny and lovable golden retrievers, including the dog named True, filmed against gorgeous beach and ocean backdrops to abrupt cuts to depressing scenes of wartime savagery, and back again to the playful dogs.  Intercut are scenes of a young and very beautiful Elizabeth Taylor allowing the equally famous collie Lassie to steal the spotlight.  Over the closing credits the very sweet comic actor Jimmy Durante sings Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""Hello, Young Lovers,"" as only he can sing it.  If you don't mind the sudden shifts in scene and mood, you should enjoy this film.  If you require a straight narrative, forget this one and stick with Lassie and the many good war films that emphasize characters more than spectacular explosions.",1448841600,,1061,5.068965517241379

8277980,2,B001AMD7GQ,"This documentary had a couple of interesting bits and pieces but for the most part it was all over the place.  The letter to True the dog was apparently an attempt to make the fragments look like a whole, but it didn't work.",1388793600,2,224,4.209302325581396
8277981,3,B001AMD7GQ,"""A Letter to True"" is a beautiful movie...but it's in a European format and will not play on U.S. DVD players.  You can perhaps play it on your computer's DVD player.  The movie is 5 stars easy but the aggravation factor gives it only 3 stars.",1377907200,2,243,4.260869565217392
