I will say that I'm glad i went with the beginner work out instead of the more advanced, because it is a bit of a challenge.

4887599,5,B005SZ39VE,"NOTE:  I received a free review copy of this DVD from the instructor.

Booty Barre: Beginners & Beyond is the latest DVD in instructor Tracey Mallett's Booty Barre series (previous releases have been&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracey-Mallett-The-Booty-Barre-Total-New-Body/dp/B0046BAAUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracey Mallett-The Booty Barre-Total New Body</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracey-Mallett-s-The-Booty-Barre-Plus-Abs-Arms/dp/B004V6F94Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracey Mallett's The Booty Barre Plus Abs & Arms</a>).  As the title suggests, this workout is geared to a wider range of exercisers, and to that end, Tracey and her crew show several different levels of modifications.  Tracey is joined by one background exerciser, Alissa, for the ""Beginner Plus"" version, while her friend Nicola shows the ""Basic Basic"" version.  Finally, Amy is in the rear displaying the ""Intermediate"" level.

The Main Menu of the DVD reads as follows:
*Intro
*Technique Tutorial
*Express Barre Main Workout
*Bonus Section: Abs, Booty and Flexibility

For the 12-minute Tutorial, Tracey uses Alissa to demonstrate.  She covers topics including proper placement at the barre, various positions used during the workout (e.g., relev&eacute;, second position, grand battement, etc.), and form tips such as keeping the abs in and the scapulae down.

The Express Barre Main Workout is 35 minutes long.  Tracey describes Booty Barre (on the DVD case) as ""a fluid blend of Pilates, Dance, and Yoga,"" and the dance influence is evident in the 5.5-minute warm-up, which puts a bit of a jazzy spin on classic moves such as simple steps and squats from side-to-side.  I found that this section felt very good on my back, but I didn't feel quite warm enough for the hamstring stretches which appeared at the end.

For the barre work, the moves themselves are fairly similar to Tracey's two prior Booty Barre DVDs, but the overall intensity is decreased, mainly by doing less repetitions and a more restricted range of motion.  Tracey begins with pli&eacute; work, incorporating pelvic tilts (as always, there is a strong glutes focus!).  She also includes kicks (not as high as in the previous two workouts), attitude lifts, and bent over rear leg lifts.  At 18 minutes into the Express workout, there is a short ""cardio"" segment:  I enjoyed this more than the cardio in the prior Booty Barre workouts, as it consisted of basic moves:  side-to-side hop pli&eacute;s and single-single-double hips.  The final barre sections are performed first with one arm on the barre, targeting the side glutes, and then leaning forward with both arms on the barre.

The main workout also includes a short (4.5 minutes) arms segment.  As always, Tracey gets a bit creative, starting with a rear delt lift, but then adding a spin on traditional one-armed tricep work.  She finishes with standing arm circles, bicep curls, and a few other moves which felt very Pilates-inspired.  A very brief stretch (1.5 minutes, focused mainly on the hip flexors and hamstrings) concludes the Express Barre workout.

Finally, the DVD offers a Bonus segment (14.5 minutes).  Here Tracey begins on the knees with pelvic thrusts and hip circles, adding in lasso arms.  She then moves to a lying position for more pelvic thrusts and dancing hips.  Abs work includes one-legged dips to bicycles, leg reaches with ankles crossed, roll-ups and twists (feet in diamond position, heels up), side plank, planks with knee dips, and snake.  Finally, the flexibility work includes pretzel stretch, Figure 4 stretch, and cross-legged seated forward bend.

With this DVD, Tracey has done a very good job of making a more accessible Booty Barre workout.  Given the shorter length and decreased intensity, it will likely appeal to a wide range of exercisers--i.e., more beginning exercisers should be able to manage most of the workout with modifications, while more experienced exercises (like myself) can still get an excellent workout by following the more challenging options.  The one caveat that I would mention is that some of the moves displayed by Tracey and the others still do require a fair amount of flexibility (e.g., the hamstring stretch at the end of the warm-up and the seated one-leg stretch at the end of the flexibility section).  Overall, however, this is a very adaptable, versatile DVD, and I rate it 4  stars.",1320796800,80,4478,5.530102790014684
4887600,5,B005SZ39VE,"Booty Barre has literally changed by body.  This new dvd is a great addition to the already great dvd's Tracey has.

I followed the intermediate level (Tracey) and was perfectly challenged. I loved that the workout was short, i was in and out in under an hour (including the bonus abs section!), perfect for my schedule. the arms section felt a bit short, but as long as you watch the tutorial and make sure you are using the barre (chair) properly and are stabilizing through the upper body, the arms/core are working there too! Its amazing how barre work can be such a total body workout (ha!). the music kept me going and tracey's cueing was just perfect. she pumped me up when i needed it and had some jokes thrown in their as well. she makes the entire workout seem so carefree and lovely that you want to be just like her!

What I particularly like is that this workout is darn fun, and I *want* to do it as opposed to some of the other ones that I seem to keep avoiding.  I end up doing it at least every other day, and I am definitely seeing results.  I almost always do the bonus workout--check it out!  It is another 15 minutes of booty, abs and stretching, and a great little addition to the main workout.

Tracey gives 3 levels for you to pick from, the workout goes quickly. I was surprised when she said we were done.

On the version of this I got there is a
tutorial to explain proper form (great since it doesn't distract from the workout section)
an express 35 min version and a longer 1 hr version.

4887668,5,B005SZ39VE,"This is an excellent workout for those who are new to barre style workouts as Tracey takes the time to run through a tutorial class in one section of the DVD.

The main part of the DVD is an express workout at 35 minutes but I think this is enough for beginners as you get used to this kind of workout and it's also good for those who are short on time.

Tracey does go a little fast (no time wasted here) and the cueing is a little off in parts which made it a bit hard for me to follow at first and was discouraging - but I persevered and the more I did this workout the easier it was for me to keep up.

My legs were definitely shaking during the workout and so I felt I got a good workout for the short time invested. This may not be a good one for those with bad knees - at first mine would get sore so I did not do this DVD every day - then as my strength increased and my form improved my knees don't bother me anymore.

I love the music - reminds me of hip but daggy 1980s or early 1990s music and really gets stuck in my head. It's my first Tracey Mallett DVD and she strikes me as a lovely, positive, encouraging and inspirational instructor. It's a shame that people label her as an airhead cheerleader type just because of her hair colour and her happy upbeat personality!

I do this a couple times a week, and miraculously, I don't hate it.  I love Tracey, I think she's fun and enthusiastic without being annoying.  I still can't get through all the leg work without pausing a couple seconds, from time to time, but that will come.  I really feel I'm getting an all over workout, although the armwork could be a couple minutes longer.  The ballet-inspired dance moves are what's really enjoyable for me, and their easier moves provide the exerciser with a much-needed breather.  Beginners, yes, but the repeated plies and leg lifts would be a great workout for anyone.  And the fact that at one time Tracey shows you a modified version AND a more challenging one, as well as the intermediate, means I can control my workout depending on how I feel that day.

4887680,3,B005SZ39VE,It was short and not too difficult.  Good for beginner level Barr.  I really enjoy the Bar Method dvds and purchased bar method a dancers body at the same time.  That one was real tough!  Tracey is upbeat and encouraging.,1369008000,5,221,4.45
4887681,4,B005SZ39VE,"Fun, peppy DVD that gives a good intro to barre.  Tracey is adorable and fun to follow - no irritating cheery babble, just enough to keep you moving.  I also have her Functional Intensity Training (F.I.T) which is a great total body workout.",1368748800,,241,4.5813953488372094

4887701,5,B005SZ39VE,"Barre workouts are way more intense than they seem. This video is no different. Instruction is easy to follow. She's a bit goofy, which is actually endearing rather than annoying. Good to have the multiple 'levels' built in.

In this video the co-instructors demonstrate different levels of the movements so you can try a more challenging move, or back off a little if you are feeling too challenged. It will get you sweaty within the first few minutes. Even though the main workout is only 35 minutes, you definitely feel like you got in a workout. A good DVD to have in the rotation!",1362960000,3,509,4.604395604395604

4887730,5,B005SZ39VE,This video is amazing. Tracey has a very upbeat attitude...but not corny and annoying. Don't think this is just about the booty or barre moves; you will also sweat and strength train your whole body using this DVD. I did this DVD last night and I'm already back on  Amazon to purchase some of her other titles. Give this one a shot; you won't be disappointed.,1361232000,5,359,4.4393939393939394

4887738,4,B005SZ39VE,I needed a DVD for home when I cannot make my regular Barre class.  Its very difficult to compare anyone to my Barre instructor at the gym.  But this was actually a pleasant surprise!  Challenging enough for those days that I can't make it to the gym.  I would caution people who have never taken a Barre class.  Because its all about form and technique.  Thankfully....I have had experience with both.  And Tracey has a very pleasant and upbeat demeanor.,1351123200,8,455,4.6125
4887739,5,B005SZ39VE,"This is an AMAZING work out DVD. Low impact but super challenging for all levels. You will really work up a sweat. You will not be bored - tons of variations. Tracey is perky and encouraging. Never annoying. And best of all it REALLY works!!!!

4887740,5,B005SZ39VE,"I'm so glad I came across this workout, it's my new favorite. I started out with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Element-Ballet-Conditioning/dp/B000WC38BO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Element: Ballet Conditioning</a>&nbsp;and through looking for similar things I found this one.

What is great:

1. Tutorial: this is what I was missing on the DVD I mentioned above. It is important to have good technique and
I like that she makes a point of going through the kinds of exercises in the workout.

2. Wonderful attitude from Tracey, she makes you have fun and enjoy the burn.

3. I've done this workout maybe 5 times, alternating with the other Ballet Conditioning I have, some aerobics, and the usual walking I do. Since I've added this one I notice that I've slimmed down on the sides even more and I feel much stronger. The core gets a great workout here as does the lower body.

I can't wait to work up to her regular Booty Barre and get some more of her workout DVDs. I'm definitely a fan of her style! Hooray for Booty Barre and Tracey Mallett!",1347321600,11,1089,5.1647727272727275
4887741,5,B005SZ39VE,"Months later: I still really love this workout. It's still one of my go-to dvd's as it's quick and effective. I still consider it a positive workout DVD for women and men with a goal being *strong*. Our daughter and son continue to do the workout with me. I really enjoy this workout and am happy to do around my kids.

First review:

This workout is useful and quick. After having two kids, I felt like I needed some help in exercising the mid-section and looked to a Barre workout to regain strength and tone in my core. I will update with results.

I must share that this is the most pleasant workout DVD that I have ever watched/owned. Tracey doesn't tell the viewer to ""keep it up"" or try to inspire, she just provides info on technique where needed and goes through the workout. I love that Tracey shares useful fitness info, shows the techniques and doesn't pander or try to inspire, both of which would make unnecessary judgments about the viewers.

I was pleasantly surprised that there was no 'sexy this', 'bikini body' or 'ripped that' banter making unnecessary assumptions about the viewers body and goals. Since my kids exercise with me, I sometimes have to mute exercise DVDs because of the judgmental body image chatter, but not this DVD. Yay! I was pleased that Tracey represented a lean, strong, knowledgeable and healthy woman. I will purchase more of Tracey's workout DVD's!!",1344211200,61,1394,4.700819672131147
4887742,5,B005SZ39VE,"I feel as though I have had a thorough, challenging workout after each session with this DVD.  I think a beginner would really need to follow the one instructor that is specifically doing beginning versions of the moves. I have a lot of exercise experience and would recommend this to intermediate and advanced exercisers without hesitation. I like the music choices too.",1342569600,15,371,4.983870967741935
4887743,5,B005SZ39VE,"I have all Tracey's Booty Barres...I actually bought the hardest one first and just added this one as a nice easy one. She explains all the moves well do so you can get everything correct. She is easy to follow and pleasant to listen to. These barre workouts keep the weight off without having to diet, and they have really toned me up. I was not an exercise person but after reaching 43 last year decided to look after myself more. I didn't need to lose a lot of weight but I wanted to tone and this has reshaped me. I have a nipped in waist now, the skin on my legs in nice and tight, my booty has raised and my legs are lean and slim. Very happy with this and cannot recommend more. This is a great starter if you haven't done Booty Barre before. Its shorter than the others which is great until you get used to it and move up to the other Booty Barres. Tracey's Fuse Lean and Fuse Melt are great additions too. I do Booty Barre 3 x per week and add in the Fuse.",1338508800,12,965,4.03125
4887744,5,B005SZ39VE,"I really have to say, I am impressed with this DVD. My legs were sore for days. The best part: The 35 minute express workout. I have no excuses in the morning. I put on my yoga pants and work my booty off! Tracey Mallett is very good at encouraging you to keep pushing through the pain. She also makes me feel a little sexier ;) Love this workout dvd.",1336262400,3,351,4.0285714285714285
4887745,5,B005SZ39VE,"This workout by Tracey is PERFECT! Not too long not to short. And the added bonus is Excellent! You can chose to do it if you have the time. It consists of core work for the Abs and the stretching is GREAT, The bonus is only 15 min, so easy to add on if you want to do it. Its a tough shorter workout!
Please Tracey...Make more Videos with this time lenght!!! Most people perfer it I bet! Great total body workout!!",1330646400,8,415,4.073170731707317
4887746,5,B005SZ39VE,I started doing this video six weeks ago and I love it!!  My legs felt so great after the first workout and I noticed my legs getting more toned and felt my pants feeling looser after about a week!  I've been watching what I eat as well as doing the video about 4 or 5 times a week and I lost 2 inches off of my hips and a combined 5 1/2 inches off of my thighs!  I absolutely love this video!!,1330560000,51,394,3.7804878048780486
4887747,4,B005SZ39VE,I think this is the first workout video I've ever purchased that I actually like.  Tracey's personality shines and she even reminds you to not feel silly because they're doing it with you.  The workout itself is challenging enough without being too difficult.  I appreciate the quick overview which provides tips on form.  The workout is tougher than I anticipated - it looks easier than it actually is.  I alternate this in on my cross-training days. I do wish it had more stretching in the cool down.,1329004800,9,502,4.724137931034483
4887748,5,B005SZ39VE,I really enjoy working out to Tracey's video.  Her teaching style is friendly and enthusiastic without being too far out.  I also enjoy her innovative moves - I particularly like the dance moves thrown in and the cardio section.,1328486400,5,228,4.82051282051282

My problem is this, I cant di the Express workout at all. Meaning, the DVD wontbplay the workout. I can only view the Intro and Tutorial. The Express just won't play. It keeps bumping me back to intro. No matter if I take out DVD, replay, retry etc. The DVD has no scrapes on it. I don't get it. I'm really disappointed bc I waited for this and now will have to reorder and wait again. Uggg. My DVD player works fine too. I wonder if anyone else out there had this also happen. Oh we.

8485635,2,B005SZ39VE,"I thought I would love this workout since it is ballet inspired, ""inspired"" being the operative word here. The workout barely resembles a real ballet class. Most of the routine moves too quickly for the complexity of the moves which I think increases the chances of injury. I found it tough on my knees and the upper body weight routine was awkward and I felt like I was injuring myself. I have another one of Tracey Mallet's DVD's that I need to try before I rule out ballet barre altogether.",1499126400,,493,4.488888888888889

Several years ago the Dancing With the Stars celebrities produced some that were a total waste of money, had the same reaction the The Biggest Loser exercise videos.  Heard good feedback on Jillian Michaels and the 30 minute Power Yoga that injured my back.  Finally landed on this video! It has three different exercise levels that are clearly represented. Tracey is easy to follow, her voice and comments don't grate on the nerves after a few times through. She gives a separate, 10 minute introduction to listen to prior to doing the workout so you understand proper position and emphasis.  I am in my fifties, pretty good shape, and this workout has challenged me for two years.  I have two daughters in their 20's and they love the video and actually hijacked my first copy, so I had to order another. Highly recommend, makes you sweat, you feel like you've had a workout, but I've never strained my back doing it.",1488326400,,990,4.666666666666667

This will work you hard, too hard maybe if you are just starting to work out, this one may not be for you.  However I loved the training videos where she goes through postures and movements.  My level of athleticism when I started this was walking a few days a week, I could not make it through the video.  I gave it five stars for the explicit instructions and reasoning the instructor gives throughout the video, I will definitely use this video often once I'm in a better shape to do so.  The other video I mentioned, beginner burn at the barre, is more appropriate for beginners, there is more stretching in between exercises and it is just not as tough as this one is.  I would get this one though as it gives you a better explanation of the proper form to use.",1485475200,7,890,4.363636363636363
