3852901,2,B00267OBBE,"to be fair, this is a different film so it shouldnt be compared to another. that said, this film had less substance than a fart in the arctic breeze.  no story, other than survive (could have been really interesting but was barely actually addressed, we'll just take y'alls word for it), whine, and sleep...character development was cellophane, the kids acting? plain oatmeal. the old woman was soggy, both in mind and body....meh, i was totally unenthused by this latest in the trilogy. i will give this to the public library and look to ""fast runner"" and ""nanook of the north"" for the arctic story. i am sure i do not fully appreciate the dire straights of the arctic and subarctic natives presently, but having that cheesy, french, folksy/emo soundtrack instead of the beats and rhythms of the native culture made it feel like a ""woe is me"" native propaganda film through the mouth of a white man's interest. even my girlfriend noted that the translation in the subtitles was very ""americanized"" and without its natural poetry. 2 stars purely for cinematography...decent, but not near as diverse nor breathtaking as prior work.",1360281600,,1130,4.9162303664921465
3852902,5,B00267OBBE,"After having seen the<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fast-Runner-Atanarjuat/dp/B00006RG78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fast Runner (Atanarjuat)</a>&nbsp;with its all native cast and crew I was drawn to Before Tomorrow.  The setting is the frigid arctic and a young boy, accompanied by his grandmother and an older woman (who dies), is forced to deal with death and survival in the harshest of environments.  The cast is all Inuit and the language their native tongue.  The costumesc canoes, tents and all other props are period (about the time of the first contact with Europeons) correct.  The film was produced by a production company in the small town of Igloolick near Baffin Island in the Canadian arctic.  The film rings true, the production values are top notch and gives us a great view of the ancient culture of the Inuit people.  Great film!!!",1350864000,21,889,5.696969696969697
3852903,5,B00267OBBE,"excellent purchase, good product
this film is really worth seeing, because it evokes the inuit community rarely portrayed in films.",1316476800,5,131,5.6
3852904,4,B00267OBBE,"Two older women and a young man take an annual trip to an island where they dry fish, expecting to be taken home before the water freezes.  When their family fails to return at the expected time, and after the oldest woman passes away, the boy and his grandmother must find ways to cope on their own.  Before Tomorrow is the third in a trilogy of films (beginning with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fast-Runner-Atanarjuat/dp/B00007L4ON/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fast Runner (Atanarjuat)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Journals-of-Knud-Rasmussen/dp/B000QJ86YC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Journals of Knud Rasmussen</a>), made by contemporary Inuit natives as a way of recapturing a sense of their past.  It is a beautiful and intimate story, and the tenderness between grandmother and grandson is palpable and moving, as when she encourages him to speak bravely of his first seal hunt.

The tribe that the three travellers belong to is a small and intimate group, who spend their time hunting and travelling, and sharing stories by the fire.  An old man tells a story about a strange boat that came from nowhere bearing light-skinned travellers, who shared a strange and bitter drink with them that made them laugh, and then gave them needles as exchange to sleep with their women.  Those listening are amused, but can hardly believe it.  The implications of the story, that their isolation from the rest of the world is beginning to end, only later become clear.

Unlike&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nanook-of-the-North/dp/6305257442/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nanook of the North</a>, Robert Flaherty's classic but controversial film about traditional Inuit life, the film is clearly fiction, and the actors are acting rather than pretending.  Nevertheless, the film feels remarkably authentic, the things they say appear spontaneous, their reactions genuine.  It is an astonishing and humanist story of resilience in the face of tragedy, and of the power of stories to connect us to a known past as we move into an unexpected and unpredictable future.",1288051200,26,2217,6.145631067961165
8352274,2,B00267OBBE,"Zen out with this slow moving ethnographic adventure into Eskimo culture of the time of discovery.  Can you tell it is not going to go well for the natives?  There is a plot somewhere.  The young hero and his auntie fight for survival and it does not look good.  Then the movie ends.  Very artsy but not so satisfying.  You want them to make it but the plot does not throw them a lifeline and we, the dominant culture, are left holding the blame.  The scenes and scenery are perfectly well portrayed and the cast, while it lasts, is certainly interesting.  You have to enjoy a good art flick to enjoy this one.",1513814400,,610,4.336283185840708

8352277,3,B00267OBBE,"Beautifully filmed, authentic in detail; great Native American film project. But it was slow-moving and ultimately depressing. Kudos for the art and history effort; thumbs-down for the bleak finish. I bought this for our Native Youth cultural gathering, (teens) but didn't show it. It would not have held their interest for 15 minutes, sadly.",1446076800,,342,5.351851851851852

8352282,5,B00267OBBE,"A deeply moving tale of the attempts of a grandmother and her grandson to survive alone in the north after the deaths of the rest of their tribe from smallpox. Intimate scenes in tents and caves lit only by seal oil lamp. Not a show for heavy action addicts, but one that will draw you into an ancient way of life on the edge of its destruction. The finding of half a ship's pulley block and its use as a plaything by a boy just learning a man's work symbolizes the intrusion of a new race of beings who bring coveted goods, but also disaster.",1420243200,2,543,4.180952380952381
