8516067,5,B00007IQJE,"Back in the early 80's before I got MTV I used to tune into a rock video show on the local CBS affiliate, and I can't remember the name of the show.  It was hosted by a blonde who became known as the video blonde.  This collection of videos reminds me of that show.  It's extremely British, I'm sorry, COMPLETELY British and a perfect time capsule.  Well, almost perfect.  Adam Ant's ""Wonderful"" is a great song, but it's from the early 90's.  There are lots of other Adam Ant or Adam And The Ants videos that would have been much more suitable.  This collection also reminds me of the early days of MuchMusic, the Canadian version of MTV.  It's great to finally have XTC's ""Making Plans For Nigel,"" A Flock Of Seagulls ""I Ran"" and Re-Flex's ""Politics Of Dancing"" on DVD.  The version of Talk Talk's ""It's My Life"" is different from the one I remember.  This one has a performance video superimposed on top of the original zoo and wildlife footage.  Lots of other great stuff from China Crisis, Feargal Sharkey, Kim Wilde, Hue & Cry, Thomas Dolby, Bow Wow Wow, Classix Nouveaux, Fun Boy Three & Bananarama, Human League and Belouis Some.",1240185600,,1137,4.5245098039215685
