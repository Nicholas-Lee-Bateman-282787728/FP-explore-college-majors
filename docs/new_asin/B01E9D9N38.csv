8758086,5,B01E9D9N38,"This is one well done and touching documentary. I can assure you that you will shed some tears watching the humanity that you will experience in this documentary. There are no issue of nationality or race or skin, just a group of very caring humans rescuing animals and birds in Guatemala. PBS should provide a link either in the documentary or in their item description so anyone interested can make donations to these caring individuals. Watch it with your kids so theyll learn to appreciate nature and protect nature for themselves and many future generations to come. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1463011200,3,592,4.93
