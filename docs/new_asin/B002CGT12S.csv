8363939,5,B002CGT12S,"My first exposure to auto racing came in the mid-fifties at Norwood Arena.  Demo Derby brought back memories of that as well as the times I followed the career of Don McTavish when he appeared on televised figure eight demo derby races from Islip Arena.  I also found a connection to the artists providing the soundtrack.  I was a high school classmate of some of the members of The Rondels.  The movie was fun to watch and provides a nice glimpse into a bygone era of American culture.
