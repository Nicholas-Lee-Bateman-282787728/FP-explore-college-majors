8000056,1,B0000D1FIX,"This is without doubt the worst travel DVD it's been my misfortune to see.

Let me count the ways"" (1) the scenes that weren't videotaped in the very late afternoon sun, were done at dusk...everything at street level is in shadows, with a glimpse of light on rooftops, (2) the only interior shot is of a pub, which is repeated twice (which means we hear about the crown jewels, and the art museum, and famous homes, but all we actually see are deep-shadowed exterior shots), (3) the cameraman/editor is fixated on the daily firing of a canon at 1 pm...it appears again & again, (4) there is next to nothing of the massed bagpipe Military Tattoo at the time of the Edinburgh Festival, or of other performers, (5) the overall impression is of Edinburgh as a grim, bleak, dingy, soot-streaked, barren city on an overcast winter's day that no sane person would voluntarily visit. Unbelievable!",1174608000,6,889,4.735483870967742
