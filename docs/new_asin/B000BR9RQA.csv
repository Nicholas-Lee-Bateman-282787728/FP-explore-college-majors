8091271,5,B000BR9RQA,"Sex Life in LA 2 delves into the gay porn industry. I had no idea what this film was about but I bought it on Amazon.com.
I loved it. It gives a humane portrait of the gay porn actors and sometimes their families. People should not criticize these people because they work hard in the gay film industry. It is better than crime!!!!  I loved this movie and all the actors in it.",1368662400,,377,4.164383561643835

8091274,3,B000BR9RQA,"I thought this would be more of a behind the scenes/documentary type film.  Unfortunately, it was not very
interesting to me...although I enjoyed watching Cole Tucker talk about his life in the adult business.  Could have been a little more in depth.",1347321600,,250,4.928571428571429
8091275,2,B000BR9RQA,"I wasn't really expecting a lot from this and that's what I got. I'm not criticizing the film's director/producer because he showed everything like it really is in the gay porn industry: a bunch of empty headed, shallow, narcissistic twits. The egomania (Johnny Law needs to quit reading his press releases) is nothing more than a cover for insecurity and damaged psyches. I get an overwhelming impression that most of the ""actors"" got into it because they figured doing porn would make them feel better about themselves or they might gain some approval - whether they want to admit it or not.

The only shred of normalcy (such that it is for a porn actor) & being level headed was Cole Tucker. I got the impression from him that he did porn because it was just something he wanted to do, enjoyed doing, and yet had no illusion that it was a gateway to better things. Everyone else in the film just struck me as pathetic.",1339891200,,921,4.548192771084337
8091276,1,B000BR9RQA,"I confess a certain fascination with porn, not so much with watching it, which gets boring all too fast, but with the machinery for the making of it.  Pornography is a huge industry in the U.S. grossing (um) 100s of millions of dollars a year.  The bucks have long since migrated from ""adult"" video rentals to a thriving online marketplace, huge pay-per-view on regular old cable and satellite, and then the really big bucks are in hotel video PPV.
This video is completely oblivious of the current state of the industry and focuses instead on revisiting performers from the 90s (and their mothers!  seriously!) in a sort of ""where are they now?"" look at the ones not dead from HIV and drugs.
Not at all surprisingly, none of the survivors from 90s porn that this video visits are doing anything very interesting.  Nor are porn stars known for their intellect, so it is hardly a shock that none have anything fascinating or even mildly insightful to say, either.
One thing this video does succeed at is giving you the feeling you need to take a shower much like you used to get if you ducked into a XXX bookstore in the 90s.  It's got that vibe down perfectly.
Otherwise, this rental is a rip off that was over-hyped and under-delivered.  I'd like my money back, please.",1331769600,,1270,4.597345132743363
8091277,1,B000BR9RQA,"After seeing Jochen Hicks first look at Sex/ Life in L.A , I thought part 2 would be a more in depth and interesting look at his already covered topics.

 With the exception of Cole Tucker who came off as a very likable smart interesting and nothing like his on porn screen carictor Sex/Life In L.A 2 is filled with mindless queens that make sex look like the last thing you would want to do.
This film not only turned me off of porn but i don't think i will touch another guy for a few weeks. With the exception of mr Tucker everyone in this film seems to be in a sad state of sex drugs sex drugs hiv drugs hiv bareback sex drugs more bare back fist more drugs hiv so what suicide so what drugs sex cant get hard shoot up hiv sex drugs more meth ooohhh an award sex drugs nudity sex nudity hiv so what bareback across the US lets spred AIDS cool make money sex nudity hiv sex drugs Aids so what dead iam hot your not hook up sex party drugs porn retail lost no love sex drugs more meth don't talk about it .....oh PRIDE LOL i forgot that they have gay pride as they kill eachother lol.

Thats it that is the film. Sounds good to you get it, if it sounds like a waist of time watching how self distructive and self obsesed these morons are then skip it. I wish I did.",1278633600,5,1267,4.0
8091278,4,B000BR9RQA,"Revisiting a subject he first documented seven years earlier, German director Jochen Hick approaches the real-life characters of his ""Sex - Life in L.A. 2"" unobtrusively, and with a certain amount of respect and compassion.  Beginning with the young, male occupants of a Chi Chi LaRue-sponsored, Big Brother-style hotel, the documentary wastes no time in introducing us to a mixed bag of (current and former) gay sex workers, all of whom are affiliated with the porn industry.  The ""hotel"", which serves as a home, of sorts, for young gay men willing to engage in internet sex acts for avid, interactive fan boys is, I thought, especially disheartening.  The more intelligent of these young men (Johnny Law, and the aspiring writer whose name eludes me) seem particularly sad because even when they're espousing their hopes and dreams for a different future, they don't seem to really believe that they'll get it; they're barely legal yet they've already developed a cynicism that belies their youth.

The ugliest and least appetizing portion of the film depicted one of the young men from the ""hotel"" going to a sex party with a group of older men who were sucking on pipefulls of crystal meth like it was their last gasp for oxygen.  I am loathe to be judgemental of people's lifestyle choices, but I found this part of the film to be very disturbing, especially in light of the fact that one of the young participants from the earlier film had died from a combination of crystal meth and heroin.

Walking a fine line between pathos and humor, the older porn stars first chronicled in Hick's initial film, emerge as older, somewhat different people than they were seven years earlier.  Cole Tucker shows up as a stable businessman involved in a long-term relationship, appreciative of his experiences in the porn industry, but mature enough to accept the need to move on.  Living with his sister in bible-thumping Baton Rouge, La., Matt Bradshaw seems resigned to his current circumstances, to the point of being almost evasive about much of his experience as a performer in porn movies. I wanted to know more about him, and why he chose (apparently unwillingly) to leave L.A.  There was a lot left unsaid, although I suppose Hick was bound to whatever constrictions of privacy were demanded by Bradshaw. The most touching of all these men, I thought, was Kevin Kramer, very funny but with a look in his eye suggesting that he has known more than his share of heartaches and disappointments in the City of Angels.  His moments with his open-minded mother (along with those of Bradshaw and his generous-spirited sister) were, perhaps, the most poignant in the film.

Then, there was the bareback production team from Hot Desert Knights, a specialty film company operating out of Palm Springs.  These men, in the same age bracket as Cole Tucker, seemed happy and contented with their lives, despite the fact that even some members of the adult film community consider their projects to be controversial.  All admittedly HIV positive, these men projected a confidence and maturity that had no tinge of the bitterness and cynicism of their younger counterparts, and I found that fascinating.

One note of warning:  there are scenes (albeit brief) of hardcore sex, so if anyone is predisposed to queasiness at the sight of men engaging in such activities, you might want to rethink purchasing this movie.

After watching the film, I tried to find references to some of the actors online, just to determine whether or not some of them were, indeed, still alive.  I was particularly concerned about Kramer (because he seemed to be harboring a genuine fragility beneath the wisecracking exterior) and Bradshaw.  This, I think, says a lot for the director's ability to draw out his subjects and elicit honest--or at least, serviceable--responses that actually make them rather endearing.",1223164800,17,3880,4.97063369397218
