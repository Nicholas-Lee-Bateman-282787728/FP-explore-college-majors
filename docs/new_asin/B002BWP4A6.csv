3896616,5,B002BWP4A6,"Michael Haneke's ""The White Ribbon"" could be considered a mystery in that things happen for no apparent reason. The Doctor (Rainer Bock) breaks his arm after falling off his horse, which tripped over a wire strung between two trees. Not long after, someone abducts the eldest son of the Baron (Ulrich Tukur); he isn't found until the next morning, at which point it's discovered that he had been bound and beaten with a cane. A barn owned by the Pastor (Burghart Klauner) is burned to the ground. The mentally challenged son of the Midwife (Susanne Lothar) is viciously attacked and almost blinded. Why is all of this happening? Are they acts of revenge? Are they punishments for the sin of weakness? Are they the beginnings of war, intolerance, and terrorism? Your guess is as good as mine. This movie isn't about solutions.

What is it about, then? The story takes place in the days before World War I, when authority was not questioned and life was lived according to much simpler routines. The setting is a German farming community, which has maintained stability by not upsetting the ""natural order""; it was expected that the Baron would own the land, the men would have control over their women and children, and the peasants would not have the same rights as their superiors. The Pastor, for example, raises his children not to love God so much as fear Him, and he continuously instills the idea that they must feel guilty for everything that they do. So as to remind them of the path of righteousness from which they have strayed, he ties a white ribbon onto their arms - a symbol of purity.

But in spite of outward appearances, purity is not something to be found behind closed doors. The Doctor, so kind and caring with his patients, grossly mistreats the Midwife and sexually abuses his daughter on a regular basis. The Baron is a demanding man who does what he wishes with no regard for anyone else, including his own workers. But was he, in fact, responsible for the death of a local woman? Or was it an accident? The woman's husband, while grieving, knows that he can't prove it either way. The woman's son, on the other hand, is convinced of the Baron's guilt. This leads to an act of retribution that generates even more hostility amongst the villagers. By then, memories of the previous incidents rise to the surface. Suspicion spreads. Distrust builds. People suffer.

All this is told from the point of view of the Schoolteacher, who narrates as an old man (Ernst Jacobi) and is seen as a young man (Christian Friedel). Even though he courts a shy young woman named Eva (Leonie Benesch), he's not a participant so much as an observer, and he begins the film with a direct statement: ""I don't know if the story I want to tell you is entirely true. Some of it I only know by hearsay. After so many years, a lot of it is still obscure and many questions remain unanswered."" Indeed, the film plays not as an intimate portrait but as an examination of the facts - cold, hard, and, to the best of its ability, honest. We see into the lives of the villagers, and yet we're emotionally and physically kept at a distance, which probably accounts for the film's beautiful yet haunting black and white photography. It would also account for specific shots that, in the hands of a different director, would reveal everything in graphic detail.

Consider the scene in which the Pastor lashes his children as punishment for lying and disobedience; rather than actually show the act and its emotional aftermath, Haneke films the entire scene from outside the room with the door closed, and he ends it before the act is finished. Also consider a long shot of a coffin being wheeled out of the village on its way to the cemetery; the camera observes it from a far away location, never once cutting to the faces of the mourners flocking behind the carriage. This is not the kind of film that gives closure. It doesn't even pretend that such a thing exists.

The real genius of this film, however, is that the intricate subtexts are in service of a relatively simple story. We may not have all the answers, but at the same time, the goal is not to be confusing; the goal is to present the facts as accurately as possible, at which point we come to our own conclusions. If there are any to come to. Maybe we're being told that, when a repressive way of life is preferred for the sake of maintaining the status quo, a different and more evil form of repression will eventually surface. It could be a totalitarian government. It could be religious extremism. It could even be genocide. Who knows? Anything is possible. ""The White Ribbon"" is a superb film - carefully paced and cleverly structured, mysterious but not gimmicky, subtle but not lacking substance.",1264377600,137,4758,4.646080760095012

3896618,5,B002BWP4A6,"I have read much about Michael Haneke, but have never seen a film of his until this one.  Haneke is a genuinely polarising filmmaker, some thinking he's a great artist and others who think he's a shock entertainer with no talent.  So I went to see what all the hoopla was about with this film, which many people are calling his best.

This is a great film.

The White Ribbon is a deeply haunting, cerebral, strange, rewarding film, one that will make you think for days afterwards (a critic reviewing this film said it would haunt you for days.  Try weeks!).  Shot in beautiful, shimmering black and white (in fact, this is some of the best photography in a film that I've ever seen), the story revolves around a German village just prior to WWI, and the strange, eerie, creepy, and unsettling things going on around it.  In some ways, The White Ribbon is reminiscent of unsettling horror films like Dreyer's Vampyr and many J-horror films (like Kurosawa's Cure) where things are deliberately left unanswered and the loose ends really puzzle you on a very deep, subconscious level.  Many films have loose ends but I don't think I've ever seen a film have as many loose ends as this one does, but that's a good thing.  The film even starts with a narrator saying ""I think it happened this way.  I'm not really sure"".  There are many nasty things going on, and many have suggested this is due to the repressed, religious upbringing of the village, but I'm not sure.  To Haneke's credit, he never answers these things directly, and he also doesn't answer them in interviews that he's done.  This makes the film far more effective and deeply troubling.  Even writing about the film now makes me uncomfortable.  It's that haunting, and that it is such a success on the arthouse circuit (it has already won the Palm d'Or at Cannes and just won a Golden Globe for Best Foreign film) is very encouraging.

While I can't judge a filmmaker on only one film, I think Haneke may in fact be the real thing.  I plan on renting many more of his films (Cache and the original Funny Games), and I look forward to seeing more of his films.",1263686400,97,2121,4.5394736842105265
3896619,3,B002BWP4A6,"On the plus side, ""The White Ribbon"" is extremely well directed and acted, and the cinematography is magnificent.  But there are several negatives.  Hemingway once said that a writer could leave whatever he knew out of a story, but not what he didn't know -- for that would leave holes.  The same rule applies to directors.  I enjoy a thought-provoking mystery, but not one that is essentially insoluble.  If the director doesn't have the answer, for the very good reason that there isn't one, then it's obviously impossible for a viewer to come up with it either.  One can speculate idly and fruitlessly, but that's hardly the same thing.

Another negative is the director's contention that the sinister occurrences in the movie are a harbinger of the Nazi era.  This is pretentious and groundless; asserted, rather than proven.  Also, the director clearly believes that the way children were brought up a century ago was pathological.  Indeed?  Child-rearing has improved, has it?  Today's youth (and from all classes) are materialistic, hedonistic, and narcissistic.  Some are just plain thugs.  Many, as young or younger than the ones depicted in the film, are alcoholics and drug addicts, and are sexually active.  Oh, yes, welcome to the brave new world.

Recommended, but with significant reservations.",1263168000,17,1309,5.132701421800948
3896620,5,B002BWP4A6,"Or it should - for Best Foreign Film.  The best way to describe it is to think of Bergman's ""The Virgin Spring"" updated to a small German Protestant town immediately before World War I. The film's is shot in austere black and white.  One image might be the raw intense power of two candles burning...this will change...to a mob burning down a barn later in the movie.  It is all very unsettling and that is the raw power of the film.

Ostensibly the film is a story of accidents, deaths, suicides happening without explanation in this insulated religious village. Some can be accounted for by revenge and despair but others appear to have no explanation at all except that a cancer of distrust, hatred, repression, and (even)meanness is descending on the town. As we know (historically) this is the core group of people - who twenty years later - will be turning to National Socialism (Hitler) for answers. Yes, twenty years later the same persons will switch from white ribbons (totalitarian symbols of innocence) to black ribbons (totalitarian symbols of loyalty). Sociology and psychology still disappoint in providing reasons why humans act so cruelly to one another. The director Michael Haneke seizes upon that reality.  He makes the film deliberately ambiguous as we watch a society disintegrate because the bonds of spiritual love and tolerance were never there in the first place.

This is a thinking person's film that seems to be directed more to the subconscious than the conscious. The return to black and white cinematography is integral and ""very"" effective. That technique allowed the film to move in waves of moods - in the way that Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal"" does.",1262563200,103,1684,4.932862190812721

All these criticisms are due to a lack of understanding of cinematography and the general art of film. Michael Haneke is the second best director to come out of Austria since Fritz Lang, in my opinion. He designated this film to demonstrate, how Nazism came Granted, it is difficult at times to tell the difference between some of the characters, especially the children actors, but this problem disappears after a second viewing. Michael Haneke worked on this project for almost a decade, before a production company invested in it.

The shallow minded will give a star and say their time was wasted. You see, movies are meant to play on narcissism. You the viewer are God placing yourself in a hero's shoes. in the end you can get all the answers and pat yourself on the back.

If you love classic European films of ideas, like 'Last Year in Marienbad' and 'L'Aventura' for example, you'll get this right away.

I watched it in its entirety and loved it. There were so many unanswered questions and so many disturbing insights into a highly authoritarian hierarchical society in which everyone feared and loathed one another. Children in fear of their parents, parents in fear of their children's propensity for rebellion, workers in fear of their landowner, the landowner in fear of his workers' resentment, wives in fear of their husbands,  and an entire village in the grip of fear. There is precious little joy in this movie. Even the children show few moments of playful joy. The whole film in this tiny village is claustrophobic, yet the plot is compelling and draws the viewer in slowly but surely. The question of who committed the acts of cruelty and violence is left unresolved and the viewer has few, if any answers, only suspicions.

In between is a story if repression, guilt, authority, fear, jealousy, abuse, and pretty much everything else that nobody ever talks about because it's unpleasant.

And I suppose I do understand what was going on in that country before the war, however, nothing that happens in the film is unique to Germans or Germany and it does not excuse what the Germans did in Europe. The film is a microcosm of human behavior and how evil can have its way with otherwise good people and how very often that evil can go unpunished and unresolved.

Something else that could be bothersome here is that we are seeing the generation of children who grew up to be the Nazi's, however, to claim that there was something unique about their generation, that somehow their generation was a bad seed and that we could somehow understand why the Nazi's came to power because of one bad generation of children is dishonest. Any generation could turn bad and that's what made the Nazi's so monstrous: they were regular people who allowed the most horrific tragedy occur and did nothing about it.

And it's that evil, that danger, that lurking horror that might exist in any of us, behind closed doors and that exists even in a child, that is explored here. Not all people are good people and not all bad people are held accountable for their actions.

As a consequence, punishment was the expected ritual.

those of nobility and privilege are not exempted?!  A real dividend for the serious viewer, is the content of the entire production reals a culture
that disappeared at the end of World War I, and contributed to the rise of Nazism with the desire for a strong man in tandem with the revitalization of unquestioning obedience for authority.  With those thoughts included, the unexplained accidents - do not seem so strange

3896781,2,B002BWP4A6,"The White Ribbon, 2009.  In that eventful year 1913, a year before the outbreak of World War I, strange and brutal incidents threaten to shatter a rural northern German town's orderly existence. Celebrated Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke, who has said this film was in development for more than ten years,  wrote and helms this German language, Golden Globe-winning,  black-and-white mystery/drama.  He originally shot the film, nominated for two Oscars, in color, then altered to black and white in postproduction to create a distancing effect, and resemble photographs of the era.  Even before filmmaking started, cinematographer Christian Berger was apparently studying the black and white films made by near-legendary Swedish director Ingmar Bergman with Sven Nykvist as cinematographer.

According to the Internet Movie Database, Haneke interviewed more than 7000 children during his six-month long casting period, while relying on adult actors with whom he had worked before to play the village's adults. He did not give names to most of the adults, calling them simply Pastor, as played by Burghart Klaussner;  Baron, as played by Ulrich Tukur; Steward, as played by Josef Bierbichler; his narrator is  simply School Teacher, played as a young man by Christian Friedel.  The acting is uniformly to a high standard.

In wandering around the Internet on Father's Day, I came upon an article naming the pastor of this picture as one of the ten worst fathers in filmdom.  It remarked, ""White Ribbon. BAD DAD: Austere, unsmiling and brutally severe, Burghart Klaussner's character rules his household with an iron rod. His children are caned, tied to the bed to prevent masturbation and forced to wear humiliating reminders of their lapsed purity. These are not techniques recommended by most modern parenting manuals.""

On the other hand, if you look for parenting styles anywhere around the world in 1913, let's say in Canada, Argentina, Italy, Kenya, China, India and Australia, I doubt you would find many parents raising their children in the permissive manner favored today by many modern Western parents.  And many people, not necessarily parents, might prefer a world inhabited by less permissively raised young people.

Haneke has stated, according to IMDb, that while he intentionally made the children of the village, whom he portrays as abused and repressed,  the generation of Germans who became Nazis, the ideas explored in the film are intended to illuminate more than what might have led to the rise of Nazism.  Furthermore, although the village he has created is fictional, many of the incidents depicted in the film are based on actual incidents in German and Austrian villages during the 1920s-1940s.

The director's filmmaking style is not one to which American viewers are accustomed.  His script can be confusing, and he leaves things unexplained, hanging; viewers must draw their own conclusions in many instances.  It may be called a more intellectually rigorous style than most.  Still, for better or worse, I didn't like it.",1374364800,3,3054,5.283643892339544

3896783,5,B002BWP4A6,"'White Ribbon' postulates an answer to a hitherto largely unasked question of ""elephant in the room"" proportions: is the pathology of right wing extremism, Germany's Nazis in this case, the result of environment or of some innate type of psychopathological defect?  Is it Nazi nurture or Nazi nature?  If nature, is it due to an ""anti-nature"", the possession by some sort of primal malevolent spirit, such as proposed by the great and too seldom seen movie ""Fast Runner"" (enthusiastically endorsed by the late Siskel and Ebert)?

In 'White Ribbon', 'Something Evil This Way Comes' came early in the 20th Century to an unsuspecting Germany.  Future Nazis demonstrate their spiritual sickness and psychopathology as children in a series of vile acts; acts that pass the boundary between over-zealous juvenile delinquency and wanton ""depraved mind"" criminality.  Parents troubled by their children's horrible behavior and lack of empathy precede a world later stunned by that same defect, a defect of soul and psyche that ultimately manifested itself in a global crime spree of a magnitude never seen before or since.

'White Ribbon' is not only an entertaining and well-made movie, but also an essential and unique historical proposition in the sense that it prods its viewers to consider a possible explanation for an otherwise inexplicable evil.",1372464000,2,1345,5.291079812206573

3896807,5,B002BWP4A6,"Shot in austere black-and-white, THE WHITE RIBBON sets up several expectations only to frustrate them deliberately.  The action takes place in a small village just before the outbreak of World War I; a prelapsarian community in which everyone knows everyone else, motorized vehicles do not exist, making travel difficult, if not impossible.  Beneath the idealized surface lurk palpable tensions: children are abused, families are at war with one another, and class-differences continually cause tension.  Matters come to a head with a horrific crime in which one of the children - who has learning difficulties - has his eyes put out.  Director Haneke is far more interested in character and situation rather than plot: the film actively refuses to tell us who perpetrated the crime.  Rather we are drawn into a lost world - one that was destroyed by the onset of the First World War - which prided itself on its stability, but refused to acknowledge tensions lurking within it.  The action is consciously slow-paced, with long takes in which the actors are seen moving - often very slowly - within the frame.  By such means Haneke forces us to concentrate on the characters; their facial interactions and their relationship to one another.  THE WHITE RIBBON is an intense film demanding our full attention: occasionally horrific, it is a vivid portrait of a physically and mentally incestuous community at war with itself. Highly recommended.",1365292800,3,1443,5.136752136752137
3896808,4,B002BWP4A6,"The White Ribbon is a dark, quiet, brooding film which may isolate and divide many of its viewers, but those who truly engage themselves within its world will be surprised, disturbed, and deeply affected by the film's uniquely brutal beauty.

Taking place in a small village in Germany the year before the outbreak of the First World War, the film follows the lives of several different characters. There is the local pastor, a serious, brutal man who, in the beginning of the film, punishes two of his children for staying out after dark by refusing them food and beating them with a cane. He later ties a white ribbon around their arms to remind them of purity and morality. There is also the local doctor, his daughter Anna, the school-teacher, and the Felder family, a poor family of farmers who are struck by tragedy when their mother dies in a work accident.

The village is plagued by a series of seemingly random acts of violence and malice. It begins when the local doctor is tripped on a wire while riding his horse, then continues with the torturing of the Baron's son and the burning of a barn. Nobody in the village has any idea of who could be responsible for the crimes, but the school-teacher believes the children may have the anser.

This film is not an everyday `whodunit' mystery, where the audience guesses who is behind the crime only to have the entire mystery wrapped up nice and tidy in the third act. Master director Michael Haneke doesn't wrap the conclusion in a candy-colored ribbon and hand it to the audience. The ending is ambiguous in that the audience can come to their own conclusions as to who did what or if one character is right or wrong. This may be new to many viewers, but such a bold style of film-making is quite refreshing to see in a world of remakes and what-have-yous.

That isn't to say the film is at all unsatisfying. The entire film is a series of scenes which can shock, disturb, surprise, or enlighten the viewer. The plot is thick and involving in that every scene is important to the narrative. Not a second is spared, and every frame has a meaning. The cinematography of the film is superb. It was filmed in color then rendered into black & white. This was a wise decision on Haneke's part, not only because the black &white perfectly suits the dark tone and setting of the film, but also because it resulted in beautiful, sometimes mesmerizing images which can linger in the mind for days on end.

I remember first reading about The White Ribbon winning the palm D'or (grand prize award) at the prestigious Cannes film festival early last year. Little did I know that it would be almost an entire year before I would get to see the film in American theaters. I was slightly disappointed when I actually went to see the film only to realize that my brother and I were the only ones in the theater. I strongly urge you to see this film, as I believe it is one of the most original and thought-provoking films of the last ten years.",1363478400,2,2987,4.524074074074074
3896809,2,B002BWP4A6,"When David Lynch made Twin Peaks, a series about unexplained events and deaths in a small remote town, he had the sense to make it interesting and introduce us to interesting characters. White Ribbon fails on both accounts and as a result is excrutiating to sit through. The White Ribbon is a pretentious effort to show us that Nazism had its roots in the everyday repression suffered by ordinary people in pre-World War One Germany. In this film, a small town is ruled rather brutally by a handful of men: the pastor, the doctor and the landowner, each with their own character perversions and dark habits. Bad things begin to happen: the doctor's horse is brought down by a wire tied between two trees. A peasant's wife falls to her death in the sawmill, the same place where the landowner's young son is later found gagged and beaten. And on and on it goes, with increasing public suspicion and hysteria greeting each odd event. In the right hands this could be effective but the problem is that we don't care a fig for any of the main characters, who are unattractive and speak in stilted sentences interspersed with a lot of silences. The narrator is a bore. The film draaaaaaaaaaags on and does a very bad job of explaining how the Germans' supposed love of order and their unwillingness to speak out against what is wrong is a direct cause of the Holocaust. A much better explanation might be the huge psychological damage wrought by World War One, which introduced the concept of mass death. This was a big missed opportunity.",1363132800,,1534,4.6642066420664205
3896810,5,B002BWP4A6,"I noticed a great polarity in the reviews, which intrigued me into watching this film. After all if a film can generate this much polarization it could only mean one thing: it must be tapping into something unexpected and worth watching! I am not a film buff or an expert. I simply enjoy good intelligent storytelling, and I prefer thought provoking subjects. With that...
In this film, the audience is really a passive observer. At no point is the director forcing his own views onto the audience. He is essentially a facilitator, giving us a window into this world.
For this reason, each person watching this film will have their own unique experience or take away. How I would understand it will differ from someone else because I will be interpreting it through my own mental biases or values. And that is what makes this film interesting.
After all, the reality of human nature and its history is full of gray areas; nothing is purely black or white and this film is a great demonstration of this.
The narrator and his idealized love are the only things to come across as good and empathetic. But we have to remind ourselves that HE is telling the story so his version is inherently biased, skewing favorably towards himself. He is inevitably painting a more favorable and forgiving account of events when it comes to himself. If we were given the story from the perspective of the vicar for example, it no doubt would have been a completely different narrative.
It was interesting to see that the younger children, not yet altered by their environment, were kinder, more beautiful, and comforting to watch. They were innocent, representing the idealized version of who we think we are as humans. Teenagers and adults, those already affected by politics, religion, hardship, injustice, inequality and ... are the offensive creatures.
Unlike some other reviewers, for me, the movie did not end abruptly. I felt it made the point it was trying to make. And there was still something left to ponder. This is not a mystery, thriller, or ""who done it"" type of movie. If you watch it for these reasons you will be disappointed. Haneke may be tough on his audiences, but he respects their intelligence. He is an auteur. I personally very much enjoyed this film - not as entertainment but rather as a philosophical piece.",1359763200,4,2318,4.783042394014963
3896811,2,B002BWP4A6,"Not that I don't like the Bergmanesque pace of the film:  That's the best part IMO, though simple to pull off.

BTW, I think what most bothers ""progressive"" Germans and their offshoots about the two wars is not that their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents ""started"" them, but that they LOST them.

But nevermind.  As Churchill said, the Hun is either at your throat or at your feet.  I think you can guess where the luvvies who created this effort are situated.  Could that change?  No, because the Germans don't reproduce anymore.  Thank God.

Is it the evil does themselves, or does it go back further?  Do you enjoy a movie that keeps you thinking long after leaving the theatre?  If the answer to that last question is yes, then put The White Ribbon  by director Michael Haneke on your Must watch list!
 Our story takes place as an admittedly unreliable flashback; our narrator states that he pieced together the story through rumor and assumptions.  A small village in Germany in the early 1900's is the setting.  Right away we are witness to a horrible riding accident: the village doctor is tripped up on his horse by a wire strung between two trees on his usual riding route.  Several other violent incidents follow including the beating of a young boy, but there are no suspects for these brutal crimes.  Even worse, the villagers don't seem terribly motivated to find the culprits.  We then are introduced, on more intimate level, to the villagers themselves and then the horrible really starts to flow!  The town Steward beats his son while in the grips of an explosive rage.  The Preacher beats his children in the name of piousness.  Don't get me started on the Doctor!  The only island of human goodness in the film is in the form of the schoolteacher and his sweet courtship of the Baron's nanny.  But the teacher is our narrator, so maybe he's just whitewashing his own role in this scenario.  Darn unreliable narrators!  On the upside, the movie is absolutely beautiful to look at, even when you can't quite look.  The black and white cinematography not only fixes our story firmly in the past but also makes some of the horrors we witness a little easier to look at.  The director does not rely on crazy camera angles or tricks to tell the story; Realism is the word of the day here.  The scenes usually play out in only one or two different shots depending on the number of characters in the scene.  There is no traditional background music; all sounds and music that we hear feel natural.  The actors in the film look like ""real people"", they speak like ""real people"", they move like ""real people""; amazing acting throughout this film.  These elements come together to form a truly believable feeling when viewing, you lose yourself in the unfolding of events.
  The characterizations, especially of the leading citizens of the village were very interesting.  The men in positions of power were never referred to by name, only by title; bestowing on them the mantle of archetype which allows them to be completely awful within the scope of their role.  That being said, there are not many ""bad guys"" or ""good guys"" in this story.  Most of our characters feel very human: conflicted, unsure, imperfect.  Which brings me to the children: there is a great cinematic tradition of mobs of evil children in films.  Don't think for a second that our director will make it that easy for you!
  It is interesting to ponder the narrator's assertion at the start of the film that the events of the film may ""clarify things that happened in our country"".  One thinks of the rise of National Socialism in the form of Nazis, the wholesale slaughter of millions of innocent people, etc...  I have watched this film several times and I think I come away with a different take on it every time; I will leave it up to you, prospective viewer, to come to your own conclusion.  I know that there are many people who do not like movies with open- ended conclusions, and to them I say: This is NOT the film for you!  This movie seems to raise many more questions than it answers but, if you don't mind some mental heavy lifting, the rewards are great.",1353628800,10,3751,4.6033182503770735

It's a window on traditional societies, a commentary on human weakness, and a compelling mystery. Perhaps it is a statement on the aristocratic notion that honor and paternal care are inherited virtues, perhaps it speaks to the Protestant notion that faith and not works is paramount. Both ideas are explored, and both turn out to be dust. Whatever it may be saying, it is very much worth seeing and considering.",1350259200,3,550,4.8

My German mother had me late in life, my grandmother was a 16-year old in 1914, when this movie takes place. I have tons of photographs that look exactly like this film. I also know a ton of stories that echo what happens in the film. Ordinary brutality, both physical and psychological, was not that uncommon in the era, but the filmmakers have compressed many incidents into the course of one year in one small place. That's what gives the film its claustrophobic, paranoid edge and the allusion to atrocities and ultimately the Holocaust. It's a very flimsy link. All peoples are capable of atrocities given the circumstances. It's also worth noting that if the film had been shot in color, the dramatic impact would have been far less.

A world where a young person is not even given the opportunity to speak their mind, less any reward for doing so.  This is the world of the White Ribbon.  The answers to the mysteries of the crimes in the village are of little import here, it is the psychological environment that punishes anyone that might reveal any truth here that is the point, and none of the children dare risk it.

The film is brilliant, subtle and a fascinating study of psychological, dare I say it, ""terrorism?"". Not for everyone, it's clear that many viewers get stuck on the idea that it's a ""whodunit."". This is not Sherlock Holmes, but more Sigmund Freud.  It's not a whodunit, get that out of your mind or you'll completely miss what the movie is about.

3896819,5,B002BWP4A6,"This film magnificently captures the micro that led to the macro in Germany, the foundation laid in Prussia/Germany back in the early 1800s that led to the explosion we came to know as Nazi Germany. Child abuse, child killing and violations of children back in the 1800s was so bad that the French and English were appalled when they visited Bavaria. And remember it was not a great time to be a child in France and England in that time period so for the French and English to be appalled...well...it had to be really really bad.

What happens in childhood doesn't stay in childhood, the festering secrets and festering wounds will manifest in some way. It is what spawned Adi (Adolf's nickname as a boy). We think it's all a great unsolvable mystery as to how a young Bavarian/Austrian boy could get everyone to simply obey him by being a raving lunatic but the answer lies in the secrets of this one German village, then multiply that by thousands of villages with similar parental authorities enthroned in simple households raging and torturing children and there you have it.

Read Lloyd deMause's meticulous research or Alice Miller's work. What we can't talk about directly we can speak the truth in film making and this film does truth telling in stark black and white to tell a stark dreadful tale. How cold and calculating the abuse was to those children. The shaming, the humiliation, the degradation, the parental need for absolute control of children and use of children to fulfill the needs of the adults who also had the same childhood experiences.

There is no resolution to the film because some elements of Germany still hold on to these same dynamics that fostered the violent explosion, still hold onto the denial, still hold onto the sickness, still hold onto the family secrets, the dirty laundry of Germany.

A young German girl,  Anna Rosmus from Passau, Bavaria innocently wrote a paper about Passau's history of helping the Jewish people only to find out in her research the people of Passau lied and covered up. They rabidly verbally attacked her, threatened her and she ended up moving away from Germany for her own and her family's safety. And this was in the 1980s not the 1930s.  That film is called ""Das schreckliche Mdchen"", in English it is (very poor translation by the way) ""The Nasty Girl"". A better translation is ""The Horrible Girl"".  Passau was where little Adi lived when he was very young.

The geographic placement is clear from the Junker system depicted, the name of the county seat (Teglitz - a Wendish name) and the presence of Polish farm laborers.  The story is told in retrospect by an old man who, in the movie, is the young schoolmaster, the one element not corrupted. The leading characters/institutions - the Baron and his wife, the doctor, the pastor, the police  - are shown as heartless and shallow; it is they, and their extensions (e.g., the Baron's son and the midwife's son), who are the targets of the sometimes lethal attacks perpetrated  by those who must live under them.  American reviewers of this movie have seen this theme and interpret it simplistically as nothing more than shoving the German nose into the dreck of Naziism yet once again - and this may indeed by part of the message.  (It would appear that throwing the Baron's son into the river and stealing his whistle might have more to do with a depiction of the SECOND dictatorship on German soil in the 20th century).  Overall it would seem that the message is rather a general one, perhaps equally applicable to the French and Russian revolutions - that a violent response to the inequities of society may lead to even greater injustice.  This village, after all - on the eastern march - would have been obliterated with the destruction of the Oder-Neisse provinces in 1945.  And yet the movie begins and ends with a chorale of ""A Mighty Fortress"" - at the end, with the congregation, the pastor sitting as one of them, viewed from the altar - the divine perspective. Surely this is the appropriate response to the slings and arrows of this world.",1333929600,,1846,4.620795107033639

Critics fawned all over this foreign language Oscar contender and with some reservation I understand why.  The film is shot in beautiful black and white which certainly highlights the foreboding darkness that prevails over the village and its inhabitants.  Mysterious assaults occur over time and the town leaders can't figure it out.  Early on there is a strong hint that the children are somehow involved.

Much has been made by critics of how the movie portends Fascism, but I'm not so sure.  The strong, unrelenting dominance of the family patriarchs can be seen in English, Irish and yes American cultures as well.  I think it is more the religious teachings of the time.  In any case, I can't get too gushy about the film.  While the stark photography is indeed beautiful, I found the film unsatisfying in the end.  Do we always need to tie up stories all neat and orderly?  Surely not, but some questions need to be answered.  The movie, while expertly directed, moves along at a glacial pace and I understand the director shaved an hour off just to get it to 2 1/2 hours.

3896858,4,B002BWP4A6,"""The White Ribbon"" was shot in black and white; in a flat, deadpan style.  Upon reading several other Amazon reviews of this DVD, I observed that even if the reviewer didn't care for the film, they did admire Christian Berger's brilliant cinematography. The cumulative effect of tone and pacing is subtle, as if the director (Michael Haneke) did everything he could to make a suspense/horror film, without resorting to the use of any suspense/horror picture cliches.  This film is a testament to the corrosive power of family and societal secrets.  Its characters live in an oblivion of denial, in a village where certain key male authority figures wield power with an iron fist.  For the most part, the perpetrators of the various heinous events occurring in this picture are not revealed; these incidents are presented to the viewer ""after the fact"".  On occasion, there is a silent, visual implication of involvement; for example, the scene where the boys watch the burning barn from their bedroom window; the group of children gathering outside the doors or windows of various homes.  Subliminal evidence of the ""revenge of the abused"" is directly and/or indirectly hinted at.  But ultimately, the villagers are working very hard at appearing to be innocent (the white ribbon, after all, stands for innocence).

In Chapter Two of this DVD, a child attempts to lift the veil covering the face of a dead woman.  He is then comforted by a man sitting nearby in the dark; watching this scene, I suddenly feared that the father was sexually abusing the child.  Although the plot is easy enough to follow, in that particular scene, I wasn't 100% sure who the dead woman was, who the child was, and who the man sitting in the dark was (the director purposely kept him ""faceless"").  And so I assumed that those characters were the doctor, his former wife (now dead), and the boy was his son.  The point being--whether or not one knows who these characters are, the effect of this scene is chilling; it is the most disturbing one in the entire picture.  Following that scene, the older sister of a little boy explains to him that everyone must die; he struggles to understand mortality.  That is probably the most touching scene in the film.

There are two characters in ""The White Ribbon"" who are equally abhorrent in their roles as abusers; the Doctor and the Pastor.  The Pastor is bigger monster of the two, as he hides behind his mask of moral superiority.  The Doctor, although reprehensible, is at least aware that he is a monster.  When the Schoolteacher (who, along with his fiance Eva, are in the minority of villagers that could be described as ""good"") confronts the Pastor near the end of the film, the Pastor warns the Schoolteacher not to reveal his theory about who has been committing the crimes in the village.  It's as if the Pastor metaphorically becomes a black-winged demon in that moment.  And of course, the Schoolteacher realizes by this point that there is no place for noble intentions in a village that is suffocating in a stew of its own vices.  So often in life, the worst among us are perceived to be the best; what is evil is mistaken for good, and vice versa.  Although I think this is a good film, and one that gave me the chills as I reflected back on its scenes--I still wish that Lars Von Trier's ""Antichrist"" had won the 2009 Palme d'Or at Cannes, instead of ""The White Ribbon"".

3896859,5,B002BWP4A6,"Great movie! A deeply unsettling and frightful musing on the effects of cruelty and repression in a society. The sense of vague and undefined evil slowly grows stronger and more permeating as the movie moves along. It's like hearing distant footsteps behind you that gradually get closer and closer as you walk home on a dark night.

The movie begins with a very old man narrating a series of disturbing events that occured when he was a young schoolteacher in a seemingly idyllic German village on the eve of World War I. The village doctor falls from his horse as he is returning from a call and is injured. Someone strung wire across the entrance to his courtyard causing the fall, but who could have done such a thing to the beloved doctor? The culprit isn't found. As the film unfolds we find that the doctor wasn't the man he appeared to be, secretly molesting his daughter and abusing his housekeeper. Other disturbing events soon follow.

A peasant women dies accidently while working for the local baron. But was it really an unavoidable accident? There are hints that the baron's disregard for worker safety contributed to the event, but such is his power over the lives of everyone that none, not even the woman's husband, will openly accuse him. This power is demonstrated later on when the woman's distraught son burns one of the baron's fields in an act of reprisal. The baron responds by banning the family from working in the fields, causing hardship which which will lead to suicide for the surviving husband. Later on, however, the baron's son goes missing and is found tied to a tree badly beaten, unable or unwilling to identify his abductors.

As the film continues other tragic events occur. Layers of apparent perfection are peeled away from the facade of both the village and the lives of other prominent people, revealing a rotten core of abuse and oppression hidden beneath the surface and kept in place by convention and tradition. The prominent and powerful do as they wish to those unable to resist, including the most vulnerable of all, the children.

Or are the children really so helpless?

3896860,4,B002BWP4A6,"I watched this movie thinking this would be a good movie to show a class of German II sudents.  The subtitle is, afterall, a ""German Children's story"" and I wouldn't worry too much about too much violence, gratuitous sex or vulgarities. I was wrong.  What is depicted here is much worse with the inuendoes and implications and is best left for a more advanced college German class due to the subject matter.

This is a good movie, though when seen as a whole.  A small German village is repressed by its own people, run by cruel and demanding patriarchs who control the women and children and handicapped.  A lot of cruel things happen to the villagers here and no one is innocent in the long run as the fear is morphed into a secretive society determined to commit vengeful reprisals on those who have repressed them.  Critics say this movie depicts the kind of society that later embraced National Socialism.  I can see the connection here, yet I also don't feel sympathy for those who later become the abusers.

The acting and directing of this movie is very good.  However, this is a slow-paced movie that requires an open and tolerant mind.  Its effect will haunt you.",1313712000,3,1173,4.6231884057971016

Haneke, the movie's director, does a unique, totally different from others productions work.

Coupled with being beautifully shot, totally appropriately in b/w, this movie appears to be a perfect piece of work with regards to what the authors probably wanted to express.  But, all of that above requires a bit of patience and understanding on the side of the watcher and is unlikely to be universally appraised.  The victory in Cannes is sort of way too high a praise for this piece that often appears way too slow and too bleak and although the story was so carefully thread all along the director / scenarist deprives us of an unambiguous conclusion of it.  Some may consider that a plus (every one takes home his/her own message) but I believe many more will and should object that approach - to just stop the movie requires no effort, to make sense of all that was said and conclusively finish a piece is a lot more demanding.  Then you take what you want from it, not as this, it simply stops with a hint of what might be the crux.  All in all, right about 3*.",1309478400,,1241,4.493333333333333
3896863,1,B002BWP4A6,"I echo what many have said, the movie is incredibly slow, it has scenes that don't seem to have any reason for being in there, and for me some of the acting was stunted.  ****SPOILER ALERT - One thing I do not agree with though for those that have the 1 star review, is that the movie did not have a resolution.  My sister has a degree in forensic science and she will be the first to tell you that many murders are never solved.  Yet many people I think have this false idea from watching all of those cops shows that most are when reality is completely the opposite.  So that this movie ends without anyone really finding out who was behind those criminal acts is not a problem for me.  I can see how it would bother many people that have been conditioned to expect things to be tidied up at the end.

However, the movie still didn't sit right with me.  Take for instance the one scene where the Baroness tells the Baron of her affair.  Why?  In real life it makes sense, what sense did this scene serve?  It was not followed up, how did it add to her decision and insistence on leaving?  She had legitimate and real reasons to leave and protect her family.  The way people acted and spoke seemed stunted, I don't know how many pregnant pauses I found in this movie.

Some say that this showed the rise of Nazism?  Really, how so?  That some extremely horrible behavior was acted upon in a small town?  How about the blacks that were being lynched here in the US at the time?  Or the other atrocities that were committed here besides those right before WWI.  Did American behavior lead to the rise to Nazism, Communism, or any other thing here in the US?

Why is it black and white?  Color didn't exist then?  The movie did explore some complex and incredibly dysfunctional situations and some folks did make an attempt to stand up for themselves, but overall it was quite depressing.  I think there are better movies that can ""shock"" you yet teach a lot more than this one does.",1304208000,11,1981,4.340599455040872

Shot in black in white only adds to the barren and isolated feel to the northern German village where all sorts of horrible ""accidents"" happen. The movie is set on the cusp of World War I for reasons you'll have to ask the filmmakers. I didn't think the foreboding of violence to come really was all that relevant as this horror show could really have occurred in any time period.

The Oliver Platt lookalike lead actor is the narrator for the story in case you can't figure that out. It'll help you understand why the tone is taken from this ""now living outside the village"" insider.

The violence is on a scale unimaginable but it is not shown being done. The aftermath and consequences are only shown allowing us to try to be in just as much confusion and fear as the villagers themselves.

Brilliant filmmaking as the answer is never 100% revealed so we're left to draw our own conclusions.",1301702400,2,941,4.556213017751479
3896892,5,B002BWP4A6,"This is one of those films that divide the audience. The spread between one and five star ratings here is impressive. Many of the one-star reviews were written by people who had no clue what they had seen. No arguing with that, but one wonders why they want to write reviews. Most of them have no argument other than that they did not understand anything. Why not just go home and be quiet?

This is really a horror film, but it requires a basic level of cinematographic literacy to notice that. I am myself not entirely comfortable with the open-endedness of the script. I will accept critical voices that find theoretical fault with the plot.
Terrible and weird things happen and are not explained. We can figure out our own theory and are probably expected to do that. Is that legitimate? I will leave that open, which implies that I would have preferred a less open ending.

A man narrates events that he observed as a younger man. He was a school teacher somewhere in a village in North Germany, probably Mecklenburg (though the lack of dialect in a farming village is a little irritating.) The village is ruled by the Baron (a Junker with marriage issues), his administrator (an immigrant from Bavaria, the only one with a dialect), the pastor (a harsh but basically loving man), and the medical doctor (a monster, as we will find out). The economic structure is rather feudal. We are in the run up to WW1. What starts now will change everything for ever. We feel an ominous threat hanging over daily life.

Things happen, e.g. a trap is set for the doctor, who barely survives a horse riding accident; a little boy is abducted and beaten; a farmer's wife dies working in an unsafe working place. These are the things that we are told about, by the narrator. The narrator divides his job with the camera. The camera tells us other horrors: the pastor's cruel punishment of his children, the doctor's verbal abuse of his householder and physical abuse of his daughter, the baron's attempt at verbal intimidation of his wife, the administrator's violence against his children..
Things are not fully explained. Is the open ending realistic? You bet. Most mysteries in life remain unexplained, at least for a while, and when the explanation is there, the ones who wanted it are sometimes not taking notice. That does not require me to be happy with it.

Austrian director Michael Haneke is one who upsets film audiences and who likes to confuse them. I loathed his Funny Games, while I was quite impressed by his Cach. This film was an Oscar candidate for best foreign film, but it did not win. I forgot who did win, but the White Ribbon surely was a worthy candidate.",1301097600,6,2670,4.662420382165605
3896893,4,B002BWP4A6,"I rented ""The White Ribbon"" solely on the basis of it's nomination for a Best Foreign Language Oscar.  That category has almost always worked for me.  I read the film's synopsis and it sounded reasonably interesting.  I was aprehensive about the length of the movie so I started watching it one night with the expectation to finish watching it the next night.  It was hard to tear myself away from it and I was anxious to see the rest of it the next evening.  I would describe it as one of a few films I've seen that comes across as a serious movie while also giving you goose bumps.  This black and white movie was excellently filmed and the acting was superb even with a large cast of children.  It tells of a series of accidents and tragedies in a small German village on the Eve of WWI.  That aspect turns out to be more important that you might suspect but I can't exactly tell you why.  Let's just said WWI serves as an excellent point of departure leaving a mystery unsolved.

The characters are well-presented and we sympathize with some, detest a few others, and serously wonder about some of the rest.  The narrator serves as a source of balance but he, too, does not know what is really going on.  I was sorry for the way ""The White Ribbon"" ended but I gradually began to realize that the ending gave it a much greater impact. (Will we see ""Return to White Ribbon""? Hopefully not but I'm sure many would like to see it).  Unfortunately, after watching the movie, I read a lot of comments about the film being an introductary explanation of the Holocaust.  The professional review cited above says that the director, Michael Haneke, often leaves his purposes undefined.  So why the great leap that so many have taken????  Let's get this straight, I have seen dozens and dozens of movies of that generation and other generations where the definition of loving your children seems to be the coldly calculated way you administer discipline.  The films I recall took place in many countries but the feeling I always seemed to get was that, despite his many faults, Dr. Benjamin Spock did us kids a big favor.  There was never any suggestion that there, but for the grace of God, goes another generation bent on cultural destruction and racial annihilation.

  ""The White Ribbon"" was an intriguing film; from the standpoint of a history student, I appreciated the tie-n with authoritarian Germany; as a mystery fan, I liked the slightly twisted finale. Some foreign films demand something of the viewer; they eschew happy endings, and force the spectator to think, to participate. Some historians posit that malefic social and psychic forces were at work in America and Europe around the turn of the century(Lesey's ""Wisconsin death Trip""), and ""Ribbon"" delineates that period well.
  That said, the film, though intriguing, runs long. Once you get the plot, it tends to hit you over the head ideologically, the one flaw, to me, in an otherwise fascinating movie.",1297296000,,916,4.967320261437909
3896896,5,B002BWP4A6,"... one of my usual impertinent, witty, evocative critiques of this film, but I got distracted by reading a bunch of the earlier reviews, both the five-stars and the one-stars. There are enough prosaic summaries of the script of The White Ribbon in the high-star reviews; I won't offer another. Many of the enthusiastic critics agree in regarding the film as an excavation of the roots of Nazism, a kind of cultural self-flagellation by the German director Michael Haneke. Not so many are willing to acknowledge the open hostility to religion that seethes in the film, which does undeniably blame pietist repression for the disturbances that warp the lives of these villagers. Then there's ""father hatred"" as another risky subject; four fathers - a doctor, a minister, a Junker landowner, and his steward - are the central characters, and all of them are brutal self-righteous hypocritical paternalists. The only childless adult male is the village schoolteacher, an outsider who serves as the observer/narrator, whose tentative courtship of a girl young enough to be his student is the closest thing to sweetness in this bitter tale. Poisonous inequity of wealth is part of the witch's brew in this hierarchical hell, also. All three evils -- pietism, paternalism, and feudalism -- were historical realities in Germany in the years before World War 1; the film doesn't exaggerate them. There's no need, I think, to lunge from a harsh specificity -- these people, this place, this time -- to an indefensible generality about Nazism and 'the German Character.' The film is more intelligent than that.

The five-star reviews here on amazon tend to be lengthy. The one-star reviews, on the other hand, are typically short vituperative I-want-my-money-back howls of baffled anger. It's tediously slow and too much is left unresolved, they declare. [To be honest, if you want frenetic cuts, cinematically enhanced scenes of action/violence, and plausible solutions to the mysteries, this is not the film you want to watch. And that's okay. If you know you won't like it, don't watch it.] But the anger in these hostile reviews seems deeper than mere dissatisfaction with a slow, somber motion picture that makes no concessions to entertainment. It's hostility to intellectualism in films of any sort. Again and again the one-star reviewers sneer at ""art"" films and the pretentious snobs -- liberals, no doubt -- who dare to think they're 'better than us' because they can sit through such trash and claim to see meaning in it.

Interestingly, both the five-star and the one-star reviews of The White Ribbon include frequent allusions to the Swedish director Ingmar Bergman; those that praise this film compare it favorably to Bergman's films, while those that hate it rant that it's 'just as bad' as another Bergman. The comparison is appropriate, almost inevitable I think, because of the black-and-white cinematography; if you appreciated the camera work of Bergman's collaborator Sven Nyquist, you'll relish the similar artistry of Micahel Haneke's visual team. Likewise, the editing of The White Ribbon is plainly Bergmanesque. Want a helpful tip? If you esteem the films of Ingmar Bergman, you are sure to find The White Ribbon worthwhile.

This Bergman association has brought me a small epiphany, an insight into the roots of the ""culture wars"" in the USA today. All the rage-filled extremists of a certain age in America were taken or driven to see Bergman films in the 1960s and 1970s, found them incomprehensible and drab, and then were belittled by their more intellectual friends and/or more sensitive dates, and have been seething with resentment ever since. Aha! Don't you see? So-called conservatism is an inferiority complex! Why, I'll bet you could track voting patterns in recent elections by correlating them to liking or disliking Wild Strawberries or Shame. It's all Ingmar Bergman's fault!",1296259200,6,3906,5.167456556082149
3896897,5,B002BWP4A6,"If you were watching The White Ribbon 'for entertainment purposes"" and were disappointed enough to give the movie one star, then you were definitely barking up the wrong tree watching this.  Simultaneously disturbing, hypnotic and probably the most beautiful film ever shot in digital black and white, Haneke's movie asks some very troubling questions about the nature of German society in the early years of the 20th century and the prevalence of unquestioned obedience, violence and malevolent forces hiding behind middle-class values and morality.  Haneke uses stock figures--the teacher, the doctor, the pastor, the midwife, the baron, his wife and the foreman on his estate--to analyze the forces at play over the course of a year in an isolated pre-industrial north German village around 1913, and the unexplainable evil that could break out in this microcosm.  The German edition of this movie is subtitled ""Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte""--a German children's tale, because of the immensely important role that children play in this film.  Every time another accident, another crime happens, the children of the village just so happen on the scene shortly thereafter.  Is this coincidence, or are they the perpetrators of evil, a twisted generation reacting to the stifling restrictions of this suffocating society by getting their kicks hurting others, about to play out this evil in the Great War and beyond?  These young actors are amazing and they keep you constantly guessing. Haneke explains in the extras that he had to screen test over 2,000 kids in every major German-speaking city to find the right child actors, and even then had to look for more in Paris to finally cast the children's roles.  I have watched this movie six times, and I still haven't figured out who did what.  I have my suspicions. But it keeps gnawing at me, making me want to see it once more.  Naw, this isn't much 'for entertainment purposes,"" but it's damned good art.  It deserved the Oscar nomination it got, just as much as the Golden Globe it won.",1295049600,4,2044,5.056547619047619
3896898,5,B002BWP4A6,"I saw this movie after several notable critics gave it very favorable reviews. On first approach, I can't imagine a film sounding less appealing: a German film, bearing no English audio track, presented in black and white (the film was filmed in color and then had its palette desaturated), concerning the events in a rustic village circa 1914---not exactly Michael Bay material.

The film is so anti-establishment, in fact, that some people may recoil from its possible pretentiousness; I include myself in this latter group, having been burned a time or two too often by films buried under their own aspirations of signfiicance.

Happily, ""The White Ribbon"" bears no such affliction: this is a great, deeply thoughtful movie. There are many adequate discussions here about the film's plot, which I will not belabor, other then to say Michael Haneke's decision to couch his ideas in the framework of a mystery, tinged throughout by a looming sense of dread, was very wise indeed---the viewer is inevitably drawn to the film's narrator/protaganoist as he seeks to uncover the identity of those responsible for the seemingly random acts of violence that have occurred in his village.

The less said the better. There are very profound questions being considered here: e.g. how should we balance our personal freeedoms against the communal need for well-being and security---but Haneke is too smart a film maker to offer up an easy fable; there are no simple answers. People are quick to judge the motives of the murderer; the dark nature of a people swept astray by fascism; Haneke suggests the seeds of our worst evils may be sown even in the richest of soils.",1294099200,4,1660,4.985559566787003

I imagine that this film did not win for best foreign feature for the earlier part of my review, but for those who managed to gain all that was offered by Haneke in his portrait of early 20th century Germany, the lack of an oscar becomes meaningless because it is clear the timelessness of the film will prevail.",1293580800,4,885,4.660256410256411

It is in the best tradition of a Bertolt Brecht play, designed to leave the viewer in a state of conflict at the end to stimulate discussion, introspection, and possibly action.  If you expect anything neat or tied off, it isn't there.

The film begins with the narrator, a gentle and sensitive man who was the village teacher, announcing that he will tell a story he both witnessed and attempted to put together by his own inquiry.  He also tells his own love story, which is the only thing of true beauty in the film.

What he wishes to understand and explain is a series of bizarrely violent incidents that occurred just prior to the outbreak of WW I.  First, a man is injured by a fall from his horse, then horrible punishments are visited upon certain children.  Then, as events progress, the workings of the village families are revealed, from shockingly brutal parental attitudes to crimes, but also much tenderness and caring.  Finally, the village and its power relationships are examined as if it were an ecosystem or organism, adding an additional level of possible explanation to the events that are increasingly horrifying to everyone.  The narrator at last is forced to confront his suspicions and goes directly to what he feels is the source.  However, he is denounced for his efforts and threatened - the forces of denial are too great for him to uncover anything decisively.  The outbreak of the war then changes everything.

I believe the theme of the film is fanaticism and its relation to isolated fundamentalism.  At least in the beginning, the crimes appeared to me to be motivated as punishments of those who are not living up to some standard or belief system, but it quickly moves beyond that.  The source of the violence is the rage that simmers at the heart of a stagnant society, feeding on itself while finding a justification to express it from its own parochialism.  It is a mistake, I think, to label this as a simple German phenomenon or blatant precursor to fascism, though this thought will occur to any observer; it is instead a comment on a basic and very ugly human tendency, to create and punish evil as they chose to define it.

Finally, this is not typical whodunnit that moves quickly like a Hitchcock film.  It is slow, almost lyrical, as it portrays the way people behave, which reflects what is inside of them.  The discovery of a conspiracy, if there was one, builds in momentum only to dissipate as the country mobilizes for war.  The magic is in the portraits of individuals, who are perfectly cast actors, in particular the many children.

Warmly recommended.  This is a deep and disturbing film that never relies on cheap shocks or glib dismissals of mystery.  I loved it and will want to watch it many times.",1291766400,2,2871,4.688622754491018
3896923,3,B002BWP4A6,"The White Ribbon is a protracted, stark, mean-spirited picture. The story concerns a series of bizarre accidents and mutilations that plague a small, isolated German village before the dawn of World War I. Shot in crisp black and white, the film is immensely enveloping from a visual standpoint. It feels like it was made in the time period it depicts. Unfortunately, this is a cruel world that most people will not want to be so thoroughly enmeshed within. By and large, the adults who occupy the village are hurtful, dogmatic, fairly awful people. So too, their children are mournful and quietly deranged. The film moves at a glacial pace, meandering about, with scene after scene of wonderment, cut together with very little continuity. There is no music. The dialogue is sparse and at times quite hurtful, especially in the way women are treated. Nevertheless, the production values are astounding. The acting is pitch-perfect, although some of the actors, like The Doctor or The Pastor are such abhorrent beings we wouldn't like to be in the same room with them for more than a few minutes.
In this way, the White Ribbon is a difficult film to enjoy. Like much of Haenke's work, it is not entertaining in the conventional sense. In fact, it is designed to alienate. We are given one central protagonist in the Teacher, who disappears for long stretches of time, and never really gets a lot of answers as to the cause of the strange goings-on...and neither do we, for that matter. He is the film's emotional center, as he courts a young lady from the village. This subplot is far and away the most uplifting  aspect of the film. Otherwise, we see into the lives of the morose and damned. It is not pretty, though, as I said, it is cold and competently delivered.
There is also a nifty symbolic structure at work that I won't ruin. It includes the titular object, as well as a stolen whistle and other meaningful objects. Very strange but it works to add a lot of meaning, I suppose.
Ultimately, the film is meant to present to the viewer the ways in which the German society was ready to latch onto Nazism as an antidote to their personal strife and judging by the way the townsfolk seem to slither through their lives in perpetual malaise, we can see why and how. This is a skillful, damaging work that touches on such disturbing themes as incest, misogynist behavior, child abuse, etc. It is disheartening and there are no clear-cut answers at the end. It is well-done, but not a movie I'd like to watch more than once.",1291507200,5,2525,4.661434977578475

In my opinion, this is his best work.  It is a film about three unfortunate events that happen to a small German town, and how these unfortunate events change the townspeople.  Shot in beautiful black-and-white, which gives it a haunting mood and foreshadows gloominess that's to come (or for that matters, what's unfolding right in front of us).  Most importantly to this totally capturing story is the combination of timeline, location and the village children... we know that these children are the generation of the majority of Nazis.  These elements all tell a great story from different perspectives, and in viewing it with that kind of mindset, you'll appreciate all the things that are coming together at once, flourishing into one of the year's best movies!",1287187200,2,904,5.040268456375839
3896927,4,B002BWP4A6,"Some people are drawn to negatives...they like examining the metaphoric train wrecks of life or dutifully exploring the empty space in the glass half-full.  And SOME people can't stand to be forced to join in on what they see as such a pointless journey.  Well, Michael Haneke, the writer/director of ""Das Weisse Band"" (""The White Ribbon"" in English) seems hell-bent on taking his viewers on such a ride.  And he does so resolutely in this movie as well as several others like ""Cach"" (which was interesting) and ""La Pianiste"" (which was WAY bad in my book...as in ""bad"" bad, not ""cool"" bad).

And for understanding where this review is coming from , I'm kind of an in-the-middle type...I don't mind pondering minuses, but like to give the positives equal billing because they're both a part of life.  For me it's not hard to see the glass as half empty AND half full...and so it goes for me anyway.

The movie?  An old, small, isolated, pre-WWI German town structured around a wealthy land-owning Baron, experiences a few suspicious tragedies (deaths, torture, etc), and the story explores how some of the town explore, ignore and deal with the events.

If you're someone who likes their movies to provide nice, neatly packaged answers, this isn't the movie for you.  Life too often leaves us grasping for meaning and resolution (and frustrated by that lack of it), so most of us aren't crazy about watching a movie that just leaves us hanging.  Bad things happen in this movie (The White Ribbon), people interact, and we're left wondering the who's, what's, why's and how's of the events that unfolded.  There's very little bonding or empathy with any of the characters in this film.  There are frequently no heroes to root for (a VERY big problem I had watching the jealous, control-freak, semi-sadomasochistic piano teacher in ""La Pianiste""), and understandably, the average watcher isn't going to get too emotionally invested in this film (and trust me, the average viewer is DYING to get emotionally invested in a film or they wouldn't make cheese-ball Harlequin fare like ""Letters to Juliet"" which I was forced to watch on a recent trans-Atlantic flight).  And many of the viewers who DO get emotionally invested in this movie will probably be upset by the lack of OBVIOUS return on the investment when it's over.

BUT, notice I said ""OBVIOUS"" return on investment.  This movie does strongly hint at a few possible answers.  We know who the perps likely were, we have probable reasons why they did it, and it's fairly well spelled-out that the behavior of the adults substantially affected the behavior of the children in the town.  So, there is SOME resolution, but it's not clearly and cleanly delivered in a satisfying way, and other aspects of the story are left conspicuously dangling, which is understandably frustrating to some.

I actually mostly liked this movie (to the tune of a ""barely-4-star"" rating) having experienced small-town German life.  Through some of the older neighbors we got to know, we developed a decent feel for the cliquishness and frequently small-minded mentality that can exist in a little village.  If my village was representative of average German small-town life, plenty of Germans from the WW2 generation still have a superiority complex that they're mostly not even aware of, and the church and obedience were (and still are quite often) central themes in their little village tribes.  We tend to look at the tribe-mentality in places like the Middle East and Africa as archaic, but it wasn't long ago that most of the western world was still living in isolated farming communities (often quite tribal in structure), with small-town quirks, and a church-dominated social structure.

Is it a perfect movie?  Nah...but it is well-made, has great acting and cinematography, and has something that might make you think.  For me, it WAS sort of like a Twilight Zone episode, but one that contained no chance of redemption or ""lessons learned"" for characters in the movie or the viewers watching it (as TZ episodes frequently did). It's just not an up-lifting, ""feel good"" movie, so if that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere.",1287187200,8,4172,4.952654232424678
3896928,1,B002BWP4A6,"Do yourself a favour - avoid this pretentious silliness. Unless, that is, you enjoy being presented with a mystery with absolutely no conclusion or resolution (I guess Haneke is too much of an artistic genius to confine himself to such orthodox notions). Some critics may call it brilliant - I call it fraud, and I want my money back.

Apparently because this film takes place just before WWI, it's supposed to be about the birth of Naziism. (That's not in the movie, but it's what all the critics who are falling over themselves to slobber all over Haneke's ""work"" say.) Of course, if you enjoy over two hours of very grim, serious, unhappy, repressed individuals standing around and looking grim; and if you enjoy being preached to by a director who has utter contempt for the audience (he has stated that he likes to ""rape"" the audience with his films); if you don't believe that films should entertain (or if you like Ingmar Bergman movies), then in that case, this is absolutely a film for you.

It's unbelievable that ""The White Ribbon"" beat ""Un prophete"" for best film at Cannes - the latter being a vastly superior film in every way (and even - GASP! - entertaining!). Well, you know what Shakespeare wrote: ""The first thing we do, we kill all the film critics"" (or something like that).",1286928000,18,1295,4.675438596491228

3896963,5,B002BWP4A6,"Do see it. It is the type of movie that transports you to a particular place and time rendered so real you almost feel like you were there and witness to events. Lingering in my mind many days after viewing this movie are remarkable black and white images of villagers and a small country town in northern Germany at the dawn of the Great War. But the village has been there, mostly unchanged, for countless years. The story is narrated by a man who was the town school teacher and who is haunted himself by the events of many years ago. More than images are feelings I can't articulate. Well what I naturally thought as I watched the story unfold was that I was witnessing the dark side of country village life--obviously and to say the least! Claustrophobia, menace, paranoia, gossip, hatred, sadism, stupidity.. all these human vices present in that small world. The mystery that comes to cast a shadow over the lives of the villagers is, in the end, not so much about who did what, it seems to me anyway, but why. Is there an obvious why to evil. The White Ribbon is a dark tale, told exceptionally well, and worth setting time aside to fully experience uninterrupted. I do like that there is one lovely ray of light for our narrator. I was wondering if he had taken her to the lake with less than ""honorable"" intentions what may have happened. Maybe nothing. I don't think the supernatural was at work, just corrupted, misguided people.",1282608000,3,1441,4.5675675675675675
3896964,5,B002BWP4A6,"The White Ribbon,based as it is on old black and white photographs by Sander of farmers and peasants in rural old German communities,has crisp white and black cinematography and a voice-over narrative by the school-teacher(Christiane Friedel),looking back from his old age,this enhances the archaic aspects of the film. The dominance of the bourgeois hierarchy in charge is emphasised by their titles-Baron,Pastor,Doctor,Teacher,Steward,Farmer-and hence the rigidity of the status quo and the patriarchal Protestantism,with its repressive mechanisms of social control. The children who suffer under this are known by their individual names,but they are at times depicted as a swarming brood of evil menace with the collective malice of psychopathy. The film steps back in time to a pristine world of pre-industrial farmlands,snowscapes,wheat fields,beyond sight or sound of our modern media-bombarded environment in the year before WWI in Eichwald in northern Germany. Though fascism is never directly addressed, we are made aware that the utopian agrarian idyll which formed the basis of so much Nazi fantasy was always a lie.

This is an even-paced film depicting slowly the passing of the seasons. Meanwhile the film's more sinister events -a malicious attack on the town doctor, the death of a farmhand, the kidnap and torture of two small boys - are interwoven with the delicate progression of a relationship between the narrator's younger self (the school-teacher is the closest thing the film offers to a protagonist) and a buxom young nanny, Eva (Leonie Benesch),depicted in a warm,humourous and tender way. The question of who is responsible for the suffering echoes throughout as well as the passage of social maladies over the generations. The film is done in parable form. The narrator says that some of the things he's going to say he heard from hearsay and he doesn't know exactly how true this all of this is... We never really know who committed the crimes,although the teacher thinks that the groups of children are probably the culprits. The narrator is also reflecting on what has come to pass in the modern world from his old age. Hanneke uses deconstruction to show the possibility of many interpretations. We may be seeing the seeds of National Socialism,the Red Army Faction or religious fundamentalism being sown. The evil is symbolic, potential,enclosed in ritual. There is an atmosphere of punishment and abuse from the male elders of the community towards the children and women. The Baroness wants to leave her husband and take her children away from `the malice,envy,apathy, and brutality' of these surroundings.

The films offers us goodness,self-sacrifice and love in the form of a grieving husband,the two young lovers's courtship,the filial bond between a son and his mother,the young boy offering an injured sparrow to his indifferent father to replace the killing of the parakeet by malicious siblings. The schoolteacher is our guide through the tale,but events are viewed from the children's perspective. The scene in which Anna's tiny brother, wandering the house wakefully in the middle of the night, stumbles upon his father and sister together, is a masterpiece of ambiguous horror. The village's young are as much victims as perpetrators. The acts are not those of a `sick person', rather that the guilt is collective, and that the children's rebellion against us is the inevitable consequence of our own actions. There is the idea of innocence being victimised and lost, the displacement of simmering resentment and revenge upon those targets that will not fight back. Hanneke consulted mannuals of child- rearing in the country-side,and the white ribbon was used as a reminder of innocence and a mark of shame. In a Nazi context this symbol could become the yellow star that Jews have to wear at all times or the black armband of the Nazis. The schoolteacher's attempts to expose the seamy underbelly lead to his expulsion. The attacks on the status quo by the children is followed by the announcement of WWI.We get the idea that the suppression of small things leads to the outbreaks of wars.' All the big wars can be traced back to all these small ones between all of us. I always try to build models to show the big picture with the small model.' thus Hanneke in an interview. Truth is never simple and everyone is suspect. Hanneke offers his films like wounded sparrows for our gaze.",1282435200,4,4430,5.151388888888889
3896965,5,B002BWP4A6,"Stunningly beautiful, shot in the exquisite black and white, with the faces of the characters looking like the old pictures from the beginning of the 20th century, The White Ribbon has the longer title in German, Das weie Band, Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte -The White Ribbon - A German Children's Tale. The longer title gives quite a good idea behind the mystery of the troubling, disturbing, and shocking events in the film that did not have an explanation by the end of the film and left some viewers confused and unsatisfied. I think that the film is very clear and if approached with the open mind and readiness to accept the subtle details in the storytelling and implication, the open end will not disappoint. Anybody who is familiar with the work of Michael Haneke knows very well that he does not make pure mystery/thrillers even though his movies have a lot of mysteries and often very dark secrets By his own admissions, he uses the mystery in the White Ribbon to show the origins of the extremism of all epochs, and what could have been the beginning of the darkest times in the history of the country. Looking at the life of one small picturesque village in the northern Germany just on the brink of the World War 1, Haneke explores the malice, envy, apathy, hatred, and brutality that envelop the village like a web, and lead to the outbursts of evil that goes unpunished and will bring the larger evil in the future. While watching the film, I kept thinking how much it brings to mind the films of another master of grim and sad yet compelling and thought provoking pictures, Ingmar Bergman. Two of his films remind The White Ribbon especially. One, The Winter Light, a tragic and thought-provoking film about a village priest (Gunnar Bjornstrand) who can't give much comfort and hope to those who need them as he feels none for himself. Another - Fanny and Alexander, the story told from the point of view of two children, a brother and a sister whose lives changed tragically after their widowed mother married a local bishop, seemingly a charming and caring man. What would have happened to Fanny and Alexander, what kind of persons would they have become or would they have survived had they not had a big dysfunctional but loving family who saved them from the abusive, cruel hypocritical stepfather, Bishop Edvard Vergerus?

Like Bergman, Michael Haneke does not make the horror films but the computer generated monsters are simply a joke comparing to the real monsters of hatred and evil that found a place to hide and grow in the souls and minds of the characters in his latest film. It is a serious, disturbing, and thought-provoking film. With all its darkness and pessimism, the film has sweet, touching and even humorous moments. They have to do with the only love story in the film and come to think of it, the only love story in all Haneke's films I've seen, between the film's narrator, the local school teacher and the 17 years old Eva, the nanny for the children of the baron, the most powerful man in village.

One of the critics said that The White Ribbon is the film that will haunt the viewers for days and will be seen, discussed and thought of for the decades to come. I completely agree with that, and I feel I can watch it again and again. Yes, it is that good.",1282003200,10,3302,4.6331058020477816

3896967,2,B002BWP4A6,"A pretentious film from the haughty but occasionally interesting Austrian art filmmaker Michael Haneke (Hidden/Cache, for instance, was a fine if unsubtle movie about the profound guilt that westerners should feel for being successful, a common theme from the director). Filmed in a delicate black and white, The White Ribbon takes place in a small German town in the immediate period before World War I. Through a number of mysterious violent acts occurring in the village, Haneke wants to show the hypocrisy of a society rigidly stratified by class. Haneke refuses either to give a clear explanation of these acts (though they turn out to be carried out by children of the community) or to follow a clear narrative line. These make the movie more irritating than surprising (though there always will be snobs that will claim that we are in front of a masterpiece), Some reviewers have claimed the movie to be some sort of metaphor for the birth of National Socialism (with the children supposedly turning into Nazis 25 years later), but there is really nothing here about this. Boring and disappointing.",1281225600,5,1105,5.010869565217392
3896968,5,B002BWP4A6,"Michael Hanekes' ""The White Ribbon"" is a welcome departure from the aimless nihilism of his recent work, like ""Funny Games"".  Make no mistake, the director is travelling in familiar territory: the atrocities of wayward, psychopathic youth, but here he is actually searching for reasons with a passionate intensity.  In much the same way that Ingmar Bergman struggled with God, Haneke is struggling with the shameful heritage of his own nation and attempting to understand why the youth of Germany became Adolf Hitler's willing henchmen.

Set in a rural village of Pre-World War 1 Germany, the only consistent voice of reason and sanity we have is Christian Friedel, a young schoolteacher who also narrates the film as an older man (Ernst Jacobi).  Friedel plays the part elegantly, like a deer caught in the headlights of some artificial storm not created by nature but something even more senseless in it's wrath.  The Lutheran Pastor (Burghart Klaubner) who runs the village school fails as a vessel of God's grace: he is more intent on keeping things quiet and holding his children to ridiculously unrealistic standards than to recognize the horror of what is emerging from their private contempt of established values.  Ulrich Tukur plays a significantly different role than Dietrich Bonhoeffer (""Agent of Grace"") or Henning Von Tresckow (""Operation Valkyrie""), starring as the monstrous Baron, the wealthiest man in the village to whom all else answer.  At the beginning of the movie he has quite a bad accident, falling victim to a trap set up by, in all probability, his own daughter.  He verbally abuses her so badly in one scene that he goes from being sympathetic to a monster in the space of a few seconds.  It is also revealed that he abuses his little girl sexually.  The Pastor subjects his children to excessive discipline, though in true Scorsese style, we are not physical witnesses to it: Haneke knows that the implication of the abuse is worse than actually showing it.
Though an array of horrendous things occur--we see the children becoming more and more hateful and sneaky, even going so far as to impale a wounded bird with a pair of scissors and leave it on the Pastor's desk--the most representative of what will come in the future is the secret attack on a handicapped child, one of the Baron's sons, which leaves him without sight.  He is meant to represent, in his impoverished and bandaged state, every concentration camp victim, every victim of euthanasia, every unknown man or woman who would later perish in Germany's embrace of madness.  Poverty is an issue as well, of course; the underclass struggle with the Baron's wealth, resenting it, one of the young men even going so far as to destroy the new season's cabbage patch.  The boy's father later hangs himself out of shame.  Nietzsche's ""devaluation of all values"" is happening quickly, but not reaping the benefits he imagined it might.  The Pastor will not allow any of this to come to light, and when the young schoolteacher finally acknowledges that the children have been doing it (perhaps with a little help, though the ambiguity hangs in the air) he tells him he has a sick mind and to shut his mouth under penalty of jail.

And a good time was had by all!

This is a visually flawless, masterful film.  If Haneke is trying to point the finger toward poverty, religion, or the dangers of leaving very energetic youth unattended he is one amongst many.  Sexual abuse, repression, horrendous financial conditions have existed in countries for decade after decade and nothing quite like the Third Reich developed.  They are factors but not an excuse.  Is he even offering answers or telling us to stop looking? There's no way to know, and in any case, neither approach suffices to explain the horror of the holocaust.  All that said, this is without doubt one of the best films of 2010 and a fantastic meditation on the mystery of evil.",1280707200,3,3927,4.873684210526315
3896969,5,B002BWP4A6,"On the one hand, this film is a very straightforward, realistic portrayal of life in a German village around the time of WWI. On the other hand, it's a mystery wrapped in an enigma. This isn't a movie for those who need pat solutions, clear explanations.

For one thing, the movie does not explain how the fascist evil of the holocaust might have developed. The narrator's early implication that the events in this village are a logical prelude to such subsequent horrors is misleading. The evil here is not the result of mass delusion, of raw mob mentality. It's a more subtle, more secret evil - the kind of evil that cripples behind closed doors. It's the work of some covert covenant. But who are the members of the covenant?

Again, early implications point to some of the village children as composing a secret society. Certain suggestions, certain shots remind us of ""The Village of the Damned,"" of ""The Children of the Corn."" But if the children have formed some unholy alliance to commit the nasty crimes that plague the village - what caused them to coalesce into such wickedness? Are they wreaking a justifiable but sometimes misguided revenge for the sins of their fathers? Or are they bad seeds whose inherent evil was implanted by their parents?

Or are the children guilty at all? Could someone else be responsible? There's an odd shift in point of view in this film. It starts out as told by the town's schoolteacher, from the distance of his old age. In a crabbed voice-over, he uncertainly recalls the disturbing incidents. We let him guide us into those bygone days, our narrator, one of the few people who, along with his teenaged fianc, seemed to have been innocent observers to what unfolded there. However, the film soon switches to the point of view of a ubiquitous observer, someone who is privy to the evil that men do in private. The schoolteacher couldn't have known about the cruelties underlying the public crimes. He couldn't have known about the perverse dominance exercised between parent and child, between master and mistress, unless...

Everything is so real and yet, at the same time, so surreal. So much is open to having double meaning. For example, in one especially intriguing shot in the chiaroscuro of this appropriately black-and-white film, we see the shabby, plaster-peeling interior of the home of one of the Baron's farm workers. The woman was recently killed in a harvesting accident, although even here, there's a question. Was it sheer accident, indifference, or murder? At any rate, the deceased is being waked in her own home, laid out on her own bed. But the camera's eye reveals the scene from a very odd angle. The viewer is frustrated in any attempt to see the whole scene. The edge of a door cuts off the heads of both grieving husband and dead wife from our view. All we see is the sharp, scythe-like arc of the husband's black coat as he leans over his wife's body. Is he praying over her - or preying over her?

The White Ribbon marks a return to his native country with a beautiful black and white film that shows Northern Germany just before World War I. This was the generation that espoused a totalitarian philosophy that led to the rise of Naziism.
In The White Ribbon, Haneke focuses on the abuse of children by the Christian religious leaders of the time. The white ribbon was used to tie the hands of young boys to prevent them from masturbating. We see many cases of child abuse in the film and the use of severe discipline. Haneke refuses to tie a neat bow around the film. We see what happens and we have to make our own conclusions.

3896991,4,B002BWP4A6,"""The White Ribbon"" is a kind of extended parable that has no clear resolution. An older man (Ernst Jacobi) recalls the strange events in a German village where he was employed as a schoolteacher in his younger days, just before World War I. He believes what he observed there might hold a clue to socio-political trends in Germany in subsequent decades. He says it all began with the Doctor's riding accident in the summer of 1913. The Doctor and his horse were felled by a trip wire, placed by persons unknown. Soon after, a woman dies in an accident in the saw mill. Just as the villagers have put these events behind them, they are shocked by a crime more sinister and disturbing. Horror gives way to suspicion and distrust. Even the Baron cannot insulate his family from the malice, brutality, and ""perverse acts of revenge"" that seem to have no clear cause or end.

The crimes are upsetting, but their purpose is vague. That contributes to the feeling of unease. It's hardly surprising that the village is a little Peyton Place, where behavior behind closed doors defies the strict discipline and religious devotion of the townspeople. The Doctor (Rainer Bock), Pastor (Burghart Klaussner), and Baron (Ulrich Tukor) are prominent men in the community. But the Doctor is abusive toward his family and mistress. The Puritanical Pastor berates and humiliates his children for their imperfections but is ill-equipped to deal with serious transgressions. The Baron is careless and willfully ignorant of the needs of his farmers and his family. They're not much to admire. And a group of children, led by the Pastor's pubescent daughter Klara (Maria-Victoria Dragus) and son Martin (Leonard Proxauf), are always present where tragedy strikes.

What does it all mean? No one seems to have any clear idea. A clairvoyant young woman who warns of impending tragedy is at first ignored, then blamed, for the act. That's an obvious metaphor, but ""The White Ribbon"" asks more questions than it answers. The stark white-out cinematography, the snow that blankets the village, the white ribbons that the Pastor forces his children to wear are a show of innocence that the whole village wears on its sleeve. It hides a great deal of barbarism and, apparently, a genuinely sinister element. But is it the crimes that are supposed to horrify us? Or the reaction to them? Or the lack of reaction? Surely, the villagers' hypocrisy is commonplace. And what do the children know? Is ""The White Ribbon"" thoughtful or specious? It's strength is that its mystery and its provocative themes are enough to keep the audience asking those questions for 2 1/2 hours and to get people talking about it afterward.

3896992,5,B002BWP4A6,"Austrian Director Michael Haneke is one of cinema's most revered and also most reviled with films that are typically bleak or disturbing, nerve-rattling and shocking.

From his first major film ""The Seventh Continent""  of modern alienation to his next film ""Benny's Video"" about a 14-year-old who is fascinated by watching violent acts via playback on video, his shocking ""Funny Games"" (which was remade in the US) to the titillating 2002 film ""The Piano Teacher"" which won three major awards at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival comes his award winning film ""The White Ribbon"".

Known as ""Das wei&szlig;e Band, Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte"", ""The White Ribbon"" is a black and white film which premiered at the 62nd Cannes International Film Festival in 2009 and won the highly covered Palme d'Or and also the 2010 Golden Globe Award for ""Best Foreign Language Film"" and also nominated for an Academy Award.

""The White Ribbon"" is a film that has been in development for more than a decade and Haneke has said of the film as about ""the origin of every type of terrorism, be it of political or religious nature"".  Haneke said it best when he described the film as children following the idealism of their parent's generation but followed it blindly.  That when you follow idealism blindly, they become inhuman and that this is the root of every form of terrorism.

VIDEO:

""The White Ribbon"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) and is in black and white.  I've read before watching the film that ""The White Ribbon"" was shot in color with the color removed but for the most part, blacks are nice and deep and there is a nice contrast with grays and whites really popping out.  I was very impressed with the cinematography by Christian Berger, capturing the variety of emotions in the film.  You get the sense through the production and costume design that this film is a classic film when actually it was filmed in 2009.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The White Ribbon"" is presented in German 5.1 DTS-HD MA, English Narration, German Dialog subbed in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.

The film is primarily center and front channel driven with the dialogue being crystal clear and understandable (if you understand German) and there are sequences with crowd ambiance and a scene when you can hear a scythe cutting through cabbages.

As for subtitles, the film is presented in English and English SDH.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The White Ribbon"" is a film that has the touch of a classic film and also probably in director Michael Haneke's oeuvre, a true masterpiece.  Haneke knows how to make the audience feel uncomfortable and its the point of the film to open the viewer's eyes of idealism shattered and radicalism, extremism breeding and eventually planting the seeds to terrorism.

The film is literally a look at society within a small village during the early 20th century.  Old customs, old idealism and a time where leadership revolved around an employer, its pastor and a doctor. But as these three characters are a big part of ""The White Ribbon"", the film is about the oppression and idealism that children must follow and there is no one wanting to rise against the main leadership in the village.

In the Baron's case, we get to see the children wanting to act on impulse against the Baron.  As he represents the rich who is oppressing the poor, none of the adults are willing to stand up.  There is no union representing employees, there is no voice amongst the villagers and the children can't understand why things are the way they are.  They just see this rich family, a selfish Baron and his wife and their many employees and young son who gets everything he wants and is nothing like them.

The Baron and his family are the most privileged people in the village.  They are rich and aren't afraid to flaunt their riches and the adults respect that position in power and no matter how much work they have to do, it's the way of the village.  But for the children, some are growing tired of it and you have a sense that they have had enough of seeing their parents literally having to be bend over backwards for them.

The pastor is ultra-conservative and it's one thing to have unruly children, but at his home, the pastor is incredibly strict and can easily be seen as the religious fanatic.  His eldest daughter and son have a hint of trouble making personalities who don't understand why certain things in life, they get punished for it.  From being late, to one reaching puberty and discovering themselves, it's all a sin according to their father and for them not displaying their innocence and purity, they are punished and forced to wear a white ribbon to remind them at all times that they must be pure and innocent.

The doctor who is well-respected in the village is obviously the person that is well-educated and as much as he is seen as a caring individual, in truth, he is demeaning and all that he has in his mind is sex.  He uses his employee, the mid-wife as his sexual toy (even though he detests her) and his parenting as a father of a teenage daughter and young son is not so close.  If anything, his preoccupation of sex is disturbing as we see him showing interest in his daughter.

The narrator, the teacher, is possibly the main shining light of the film.  The narrator tells his story of when he was a 31-year-old man who has fallen for the Baroness' nanny who tries to be there for the children and the viewer literally sees the story through his eyes.

Through this character, we see that he is just a normal man who enjoys teaching children and has no true connection to the village other than living there and teaching the children.  The narration takes us out of those tense moments as he is focused on wanting to marry a young woman.

But the character is instrumental as giving the viewer information on what has taken place at the village but also his scenes is that breather to take us away from those tense moments that happen throughout the film.  The story is told to us via his viewpoint and for the most part, a man who tries to see the good in people and has blinded him of what has been happening in the village.

And with these characters, one is left thinking...is this breakdown of idealism is what leads to radical thoughts.  Ignorance, apathy, pessimism...  Have the children of this village became amoral to anyone's suffering?  Is this their form of rebelling?  There is no doubt that ""The White Ribbon"" is one of those films that will make one think.

The ensemble cast performances is what I found most impressive of ""The White Ribbon"".  Burghart Klau&szlig;ner as the pastor is another well-done performance (since I last seen him on ""The Edukators"") by the actor, Christian Friedel does a good job at playing the teacher and making us feel that maybe not all people in the village are messed up and the more I think about the film, I can literally list several names that caught my attention but I have to admit that the performances by the pastor's elder children Klara (Maria-Victoria Dragus) and Martin (Leonard Proxauf) literally haunt you.

Klara definitely embodies mischief while Martin is a boy who is at his breaking point, always being punished and doesn't know if he wants to be part of this life and wonders if God hates him and wants him to die.  Again, there are so many well-done performances in this film, it's well-cast and each character from the adults and the children really make us feel the pain that lingers around the village.

I've read how people perceived the film about fascism.  Some viewers who felt that this was a film that is about how children became insensitive towards humanity and thus led to their roles in Nazi Germany. Director Michael Haneke said it best when he described the film as children following the idealism of their parent's generation but followed it blindly.  That when you follow idealism blindly, they become inhuman and that this is the root of every form of terrorism.  Haneke wanted to show the breakdown of idealism and that this film could be shot in the UK, US or anywhere around the world and that blind idealism gone astray can happen anywhere and its happening now.

But there is no doubt that with the film shot in Germany, at the way their time period exists around the time Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo which eventually would lead to World War I in 1914 and that possibly, how these children were raised made them quite amoral in attitudes towards the death of others and their support for the Nazi regime.  But I do understand Haneke's explanation that the breakdown of idealism is not limited to Germany, this is something that can happen anywhere around the world.

Overall, ""The White Ribbon"" is one of those films that viewers may find to bleak and also may come out feeling no closure or happy ending.  The fact is that if you are familiar with Haneke's films, you shouldn't be expecting a happy ending.  And as far as bleakness is concerned, this is what Haneke is a master of.  Knowing how to take repress, oppressed characters and showing how they can be inspired to do violent acts.

There is no doubt about it.  This is a chilling film but it is also a well-written, well-shot and well-performed, for the most part,  ""The White Ribbon"" is definitely a Michael Haneke masterpiece.  The Blu-ray release comes with plenty of special features, especially those who want to know more about Haneke's approach to film and his previous works.  This is an impressive Blu-ray release! Overall, ""The White Ribbon"" is highly recommended!",1279238400,,10804,4.747052518756699

3896994,5,B002BWP4A6,"You know those dour German schoolmasters of a century ago who caned their pupils for the slightest offense? Well, those school kids grew up to be sadistic little boot-lickers in search of a scapegoat. We call them Nazis.
Summing up director Michael Haneke's Das weisse Band that way is simplistic, of course -- there have been plenty of repressive societies, and they didn't all end up worshipping swastikas -- but it suggests a possible explanation for an unsettling, mysterious, compelling film.
Our narrator is an elderly man, once the nerdy young schoolmaster (Christian Friedel) whose wooing of a fresh-faced girl provides scant happiness among the town's disciplinarians. For Haneke's village is filled with patriarchs who figure that women and children, if only they did as they were told, might turn out to be nearly as useful as oxen.
Haneke's languorous shots sketch the flow of rural life: This happens and that happens, and then this other inexplicable thing happens, and suddenly the implication hits and you realize just how sick and unhappy these people are. (Oscar-nominated cinematographer Christian Berger shot in color, then drained away all the hues to produce judgmental black and white.)
Haneke has coached subtle acting from his cast. With unsure gestures and darting eyes, for example, Leonie Benesch conveys shyness and desire as the teenage would-be wife. When confronted with an unexpected act of generosity, the lips on Burghart Klaussner's stone-faced pastor part as if to speak words of thanks, then return to their customary pout. And Haneke apparently searched through thousands of children to find the ones who could alternate between crying and creepy. (His subtitle, after all, is ""A German Children's Story."")
The authority figures try to be reassuring. ""The world won't collapse,"" says the smug patriarch to the disappointed suitor. ""The world won't collapse,"" says the town's doctor (Rainer Bock) -- right after he delivers one of the ugliest, most humiliating rejections of another human being you'll ever overhear.
But they're wrong. Their world was collapsing all around them; they just couldn't see it. A world war was about to erupt, and there'd be another one after that.",1279152000,3,2215,5.24225352112676

Sometimes I  had to give up trying to read dialogue and either guess at plot develpment or just wait for the next scene shot with  darker subject matter.  With their small size, even outlining the subtitles is black didn't help; still illegible much of the time.  Someone should redo this rather fine release and reissue it properly.

While picture quality is quite adequate, it didn't come  up to the Blu-ray standards possible for a film made today.  Perhaps it was transferred from a PAL video onto Blu-ray, who  knows.",1279152000,4,958,4.538011695906433
3896996,2,B002BWP4A6,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

We're told at the beginning of 'The White Ribbon', that this is a story that seeks to ""clarify things that happened in this country"", as if to imply that we're about to gain some insight into the origins of Nazism. But director Michael Haneke has made it clear that he was aiming for a more generic understanding of the roots of Fascism when he was quoted as saying that the film is about ""the origin of every type of terrorism, be it of political or religious nature."" Note that Haneke doesn't speak of ""Nazism"" or ""Fascism"" but uses the modern term ""terrorism"" to describe the actions of many of the characters in his film. The setting of Haneke's tale is the fictional village of Eichwald, right before World War I. There is virtually no effort to link the story to actual historical events except for the specific reference to the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand and the start of World War I at the film's end. Haneke does this because his story is really a PARABLE; by making it (in part) applicable to all nationalities and to different historical epochs, Haneke, in effect, minimizes the responsibility of the German and Austrian peoples who lived during the time leading up to the Holocaust and participated in it, either directly or indirectly. If his parable is universally applied, the unique horror of Nazism can't really be any worse than any other atrocities committed by other groups in history. The generic nature of his story (or parable), bears this out.

Despite his insistence to the contrary, it remains obvious that 'Ribbon' IS also Haneke's attempt to explain the rise of the Third Reich. He is not unlike a bevy of German and Austrian filmmakers who utilize a fictional melodramatic narrative to assuage their own guilt (as well as an attempt to speak for the collective guilt of a nation). It's not easy being German or Austrian when your recent ancestors are linked to mass murderers. If the ancestors are portrayed as likable, normal people but also capable of violence (or supporting violence), this would lead to unpleasant feelings of cognitive dissonance. But what if the history is reduced to a more simplistic formula consisting of monsters, victims and saints? The viewer no longer has to be confused rooting for a complex Tony Soprano type of character--an extremely violent man who is also likable and sympathetic.

In 'The Reader', the monsters are the cold Concentration Camp guards in the docket, who won't admit their guilt. The victim, however, is Hanna Schmitz, the guard who is presented as a tragic figure, done in by ignorance. During the trial, it was her compulsive need for order that prevents her from allowing the prisoners to escape. The saint is the protagonist, Michael Berg, who can still have sympathy for the 'tragic' Hanna as well as offer to pay money to a Holocaust victim's foundation.

Haneke also must create his share of monsters. In doing so, a guilty populace no longer has to believe that their grandparents were part of a 'normal' silent majority that supported Hitler. How could anyone's ancestors be like the Eichwald town doctor, pastor or baron? The doctor is someone who sexually humiliates his long-term mistress, the midwife, as well as sexually abuses his own daughter. The pastor utilizes corporal punishment to raise his children, which leads to acts of revenge on their part. What's more, he promotes unhealthy sexual feelings in his children, by denouncing masturbation as a sin. The Baron neglects workers on his estate, leading to the death of a worker's wife in a work-place accident. He also neglects his wife, the Countess, who ultimately leaves, after she accuses him of allowing a lot of unhealthy stuff to go on in the village.

Like Hanna Schmitz whose behavior was excused on the basis of being raised in a bad environment, the White Ribbon kids also get a free pass. They are the 'victims' of the monstrous fathers and enabling mothers. How can any child be completely responsible for crimes committed as an adult if the upbringing was so horrendous? This is the film's 'hook'--it's the kids who committed most (or all) of the crimes in the village: the doctor is injured after his horse falls in an encounter with a trip wire; the baron's son is hung upside down in the forest and caned; and a mentally challenged kid is tortured. The kids cover their tracks by appearing en masse at the victim's home, asking if they can be of any help.

Finally, there is the 'saint'--here is the character which a guilty audience can identify with ('Hey my grandfather didn't support Hitler at all--he was apolitical and a nice guy to boot!) The school teacher fits the bill perfectly. Not only does he save the hapless Eva after she's fired but figures out who's responsible for the crimes committed in the village and has the guts to reveal the ugly truth to the town's power broker, the Pastor!

While it is very wrong to blame today's generation in Austria and Germany for the sins of the parents and grandparents, it is equally disturbing to realize that there is a pattern of denial amongst the younger generation in regards to the idea that the enablers of the Holocaust were not the monsters, victims and saints depicted by Mr. Haneke but rather ordinary people who one could easily identify with.

Despite its facile explanation of the roots of Fascism, the White Ribbon has some value, precisely because it sparks debate. With its austere, Bergman-like, black and white cinematography, and recreation of a bygone era, Haneke scores points for atmosphere. But instead of focusing on 'why' the Holocaust occurred, the 'what' and 'how' would have been more than sufficient.",1279065600,9,5707,4.858170606372045
3896997,5,B002BWP4A6,"In spite of having a style that distances the viewer from his material, and his refusal to provide any answers to the questions his films raise, Michael Haneke is a deeply serious artist on the level of Bergman and Tarkovsky, one who mourns man's inhumanity to man with a compassion for the human condition. And THE WHITE RIBBON is Haneke's masterpiece.

With its atmospheric black and white photography conveying a bleached austerity reminiscent of the great Danish filmmaker, Carl Dreyer, THE WHITE RIBBON is set in a fictitious small town in Northern Germany in 1913 and relates mysterious brutal incidents involving its inhabitants up until the outbreak of World War I.  In this film, called by one critic, ""THE VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED as directed by Ingmar Bergman,"" Haneke portrays an authoritarian society where children are subjected to rigid rules and harsh punishments, and adults display different types of paternal power patterns. It is told somewhat like a fairy tale peopled by village icons: the farmer, the pastor, the schoolteacher, the doctor, the baron, etc. and their families -- and we sense the beginnings of fascism in Germany that will lead to the takeover by the Nazis.

The white ribbon of the title refers to what children are forced to wear around their upper arms as a punishment, something we can see becoming red armbands displaying swastikas twenty years later. And rather than forcing pretentious symbolism, Haneke employs concrete human emotional conflict that disturbs and moves the viewers in a way of which only the greatest art is capable.

THE WHITE RIBBON is a film for discerning viewers, one that demands several viewings. It is an amazing magisterial work by a great filmmaker at the peak of his powers.",1279065600,5,1744,5.024221453287197
3896998,5,B002BWP4A6,"Michael Haneke's striking black and white film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes last year.  Disturbing and beautiful in its stark composition, the restrained drama takes place in a German village as World War I begins.

The village seems safe enough under the stern authoritarian rule of the town's elders.  But when a doctor's horse falls victim to a cruel prank -- or is it something much worse? -- subtle changes are manifest in the village.  Suspicions generate fear and fear triggers severe actions that suggest a pathology that will eventually grow into a nation that embraces Hitler.  Here is a bold look at the seeds of familial rules, rituals and punishments that infect a community to blindly committing to great evil.

Much is implied in this brilliant film that leaves a lot up to the viewer.  Most the action takes place off screen but the repercussions are in full view.  Allegorical certainly and rich in the metaphors of what we have come to know as European cinema, I think it compares favorably with Ingmar Bergman's best work. I was also reminded of VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED.

This is an important film that works first and foremost as a kind of horror story.  The embedded implications of trying explain the nature and process of evil energize the often-understated scenes with an aura of impending doom.  The extraordinary cast of mostly unknowns, especially the children, is pitch perfect.  I can't imagine how they were chosen or the audition process.  Their amazing faces tell the story when words cannot.  The Austrian director is best known for FUNNY GAMES and CACHE.

3897000,3,B002BWP4A6,"Movies don't come much more austere or art-house friendly than ""The White Ribbon,"" a German film written and directed by Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke. With its stark black-and-white cinematography and deliberate pacing, the film has the look and feel of an old Ingmar Bergman picture - Ingmar Bergman crossed with M Night Shyamalan, that is, since its story centers around a village in pre-World War I Germany where strange and inexplicable things begin to happen.  The town doctor is injured in a mysterious horseback riding mishap; the baron's son is found hanging upside down in a barn; a worker dies in a freak factory accident.  All of this is narrated by the town's schoolteacher (Christian Friedel) who falls for a sweet, shy girl who works as a nanny at the manor house.

The children - most of whom look like they just stepped out of ""Village of the Damned"" - struggle with thoughts of death and the guilt caused by a repressive society, while the adults - an emotionally rigid and unyielding pastor, a cruel, incestuous doctor - contend with their own inner demons, as they groan under the burdens of a class-conscious feudal system and the weight of their own conflicted desires.  The theme seems to be that when people bury their natural urges under a crushing mountain of rules and regulations - whether societal or religious in nature - those sublimated urges will manifest themselves in other, demonstrably harmful ways (killing birds, destroying property, kidnapping and torturing children, etc.).  The conclusion we're supposed to come to, I guess, is that it was from just such seeds that the war that was to come would eventually spring. I guess.

I wish I could say that I liked ""The White Ribbon"" better than I do.  It's certainly wonderful to look at, and there is something haunting and hypnotic about Haneke's vision of life in a small German village at that particular moment in time. But the plotting is so obscure, the pacing so funereal, and the overall demeanor so heavy-handed and pretentious that, I'm afraid, it takes a great deal of patience and perseverance just to get through it all.

Still, the mood and visuals alone make it worth the effort.",1278633600,25,2185,4.870619946091645
3897011,5,B002BWP4A6,"Regarding the DVD: there are virtually no extras.

Misfortune and malevolence plague the German village of Eichwald. Its inhabitants are more concerned with local vandalism, maimings, and deaths than the impending Great War. Yet events in the town foreshadow an even deadlier war. Designed to represent innocence, the titular white ribbon actually serves as a punishment for naughty children and raises questions about guilt, pretense, and purity. In The White Ribbon, director Michael Haneke has created a film whose horrors are enveloped in silence and uncertainty, provoking in viewers both thought and terror.

The black and white cinematography conveys the era's severity and faade of simplicity. There is no music to direct or alleviate tension. Instead, long, sometimes self-conscious, shots develop a sense of dread until evil appears to inhabit every scene. Acting, from the youngest child to the oldest patriarch, is outstanding.

Through the social structures of a claustrophobic town, The White Ribbon examines death, persecution, religion, and vengeance. These far-reaching themes make Eichwald eerily universal.

At the conclusion of the showing I attended, a man whispered, ""My God, what a movie."" Grateful for a chance to relieve tension, and perhaps in unspoken accord with the speaker, the audience burst into laughter. Still, an unsettling feeling lingered.

If we take a backward glance, this film follows the steps of three memorable and historical films. ""Pandora' box"", ""M"" and ""The raven"", who worked out as a real cathartic device to state the inner demons who nestled underneath the collective conscious as product of the oppressive years of the WW2.

But the fundamental difference resides around the allusive metaphor about the horrors made by the envy, apathy, resentment around all sort of hierarchy which denoted a symbol of intellectual preeminence or social status.

The victims are the son of the Baron (just a precognitive alarm of the Archduke Fernando in Sarajevo) and the fall of the doctor of the town (a nasty strategy) from a horse due its execrable intimate behavior as human being in his double condition as couple and father, seem to reveal that before the Nazi ideology arrived, the ideal conditions nestled into the spirit of many people. The repulsive and abominable behavior of the Protestant pastor treating and blackmailing the denounce and suspects of the ethical conscious conform a first-order and mature drama that carves in relief a courageous and bold film.

The voice in off not only works out as a perfect device of the inner voices of a desperate and noble spirit who intimately seem to anticipate the dark clouds which would sift over Germany into a very near future.

3897014,5,B002BWP4A6,"Written and directed by Michael Haneke ('Funny Games', `The Piano Teacher'), `The White Ribbon' takes place in a small northern Germany village in the year before Austria-Hungary declare war on Serbia provoking World War I.  Haneke's direction is magically bleak, shot in a rich black and white with an eerie and powerful feel.  (Christian Berger is the cinematographer).

Narrated by the schoolteacher (as an older man recalling the story as in a fable) the film begins with an innocent look at the village people and its structure, notably the feared Baron who provides most of the work for the villagers, the omnipotent town doctor and the self-righteous town's pastor.  All three come to represent a respected but feared presence from all, especially the children.  A series of cruel and horrifically mean-spirited offenses occur over the year, beginning with the doctor and his horse as they catch a hidden wire while riding and are thrown to the ground.  Speculation rises as the villagers try to unearth the culprit.  More unthinkable and strange happenings occur, some involving children, sending the village into a sinister atmosphere of distrust and accusation.  The pastor tries to remedy his children's behavior by forcing them to wear white ribbons on their arms - a false sign of purity and innocence.  At the same time, the pastor is relentless in caning his children behind closed doors.  That's one of the marvels of the film, in that, other than the initial horse tragedy, none of the atrocities are directly shown on screen.  Both adults and children fall prey to some of these cruel and horrific events. Allegedly, adults towards children and children towards adults.

The cinematography is remarkable as high contrast gives the film a ghostly, foreboding feel and look. Haneke never comes straight forward with answers, but insinuates most of the events, giving the story an almost Hitchcockian feel.  Shocking without being graphic, `The White Ribbon' shows the ugly underbelly of a small town that tries to keep its appearances while deteriorating inside.  It feels like a true classic.",1278288000,3,2109,5.146627565982405
3897015,5,B002BWP4A6,"Haneke's grueling and ambitious ten year project finally manifests itself to the screen here.  The results are completely stunning and provocative.  Many of the director's past films have centered around violence or have used the threat of violence as a focal point.  But The White Ribbon resonates much deeper with its broad, powerful implications geared toward authority.  Although it has some harsh content and moments of sexuality, the violent acts seem to just be a by-product of a much more disturbing element.  Haneke's complex objectives are left somewhat of a mystery, although he does admit that this story is about ""the origin of every type of terrorism, be it of political or religious nature"".

This story will be easy for several people to relate to in many various aspects.  At it's core essence, it really is just about normal people rebelling against injustice.  The abuse of power has a demoralizing effect on everyone it affects.  Sooner or later there are always repurcussions.

Just before the start of WWI, some strange accidents occur in a small German village.  These are mysterious types of sabotage or blatant disobedience, all geared toward three powerful community figures.  All three of these leaders are guilty of exploiting those at their service.

THE PASTOR--he decides to tie white ribbons to his children for trivial offenses.  Each ribbon is supposed to be a reminder of their innocence and purity.  Each child can't help but feel humiliated as this draws unwanted attention.
THE DOCTOR--this man sexually humiliates his housekeeper, as well as forcing himself upon his teenage daughter.
THE BARON--he is the lord of the manor, and uses his power to devastating effect on the villagers.

The running time is 144 minutes.  This doesn't have a great deal of action but it inevitably invades your mind with its penetrating subject matter.  Shot in glorious black and white, this film was nominated for Best Cinematography as well as Best Foreign Language film.  Brilliantly acted with such rich character development, The White Ribbon is an amazingly poignant and rare accomplishment in cinema.  Highly recommended to all serious film fans.",1278201600,9,2173,5.171919770773639

This brings me to people who in their intellectual snobbery find ""their"" meaning in every obscure and ambiguous form of art as if they've discovered the real hidden meaning lying deep within the artists' subconscious mind waiting to be discovered. The problem is that their neighboring intellectual effete derived a different subconscious intent and the second problem is that the hidden message may never have existed in the first place despite the statistically random ""connect-the-dots"" events that create different interpretations depending upon which dots one selects.

3897017,5,B002BWP4A6,"In a small village in Northern Germany in 1916 a series of bizarre and horrid things happen.  There is no explanation for these events, only mute rumors and musings in a town confined by strict Protestant rules of judgment and behavior.  The town Doctor on horseback is tripped by a trap wire hidden on a path, is injured, and must leave town for a hospital treatment for a while: upon return we learn that the town doctor is anything but kind in his verbal and physical abuse of his office manager/mistress who may be the mother of 'his child' - a mentally challenged boy cared for the mother/mistress who also cares for his naive other children by his deceased wife.  A young boy, the son of the town Baron, is found in the woods, bound and beaten, and the town fails to produce information as to the brutality.  A woman falls through a dangerous flooring and dies, her husband commits suicide, the mentally challenged boy is severely tortured, the Baron's cabbage farm is destroyed, the children of the large family of the town pastor are punished for varying reasons (each offending child must wear a 'white ribbon of innocence' to remind themselves to sin no more - the young boy's sin is physical self satisfaction), a building on the Baron's estate is burned, etc.  Oddly since there are no identified culprits, the town focuses on the children as the possible perpetrators of the violence - since they are ignorant until they receive Confirmation in the church - a ritual supposed to bring the enlightenment of adulthood to those confirmed!

There are many stories in this magnificent film by the gifted Michael Haneke and none of them is fully resolved by the end of the film.  It is the tenor of the city that seems to breed ill winds that in turn suggests that the town's inhabitants - curious and possibly dangerous children and adults with both overt and subliminal evil in their characters - are setting the scene for a country that could produce the evil demonstrated by the events of July 1917 which opened World War II.  Haneke captures all of this terror and submerged hate and fear and abuse and character dysfunction in startling black and white photography.  The townspeople are all fairly similar in appearance, made more so by the black and white imagery, and the only person in the town that has some semblance of humanity is the young schoolteacher (even in his discovery of courtship) that seems to make the statement that it is only through education that change can occur.  Haneke has the courage and sensitivity to leave the audience guessing about the etiologies of all the evils we have witnessed and simply ends his film in slow fadeout as WW I ensues.  It is a heart-stopping film, brilliantly directed and acted and photographed and accompanied by a musical score that emphasizes choral hymns sung by children. This is magnificent filmmaking!

3897018,5,B002BWP4A6,"A beautiful and weird journey to a small German village in the years preceding World War I.  The inhabitants are apparently living a serf-life existence under the benificence of the ""Baron,"" who resides in an opulent estate. Slow to unfold, the tale begins to gel and one comes to know and marvel at the strangeness of these people and their relationships with their families and each other behind closed doors.

Filmed in dramatic black and white, a creepy mood permeates darkly as various tragedies emerge and elude understanding.  Bitterness, incest, cruelty and sadism arise in the context of a charming and playful love story between a teacher and one of the Baron's governesses.

My chief ""complaint"" would be the abrupt ending, which leaves many mysteries unsolved, but which also creates a sense of amazement and contemplation that lingers long after.  I was further annoyed by the subtitles--many of which were barely visible against a bright white background.  Finally, many of the scenes of this DVD are dimly lit which detracts from one's enjoyment.",1278028800,4,1061,5.104046242774566
3897019,4,B002BWP4A6,"Michael Hanake is nothing if not singular. The few films of his I have seen have all been different and odd. None have towed the line of mainstream cinema and White Ribbon is no exception. Set in Germany just prior to the outbreak of WWI a normally quiet, small town experiences a series of unsettling, violent events. Being a typical close knit, rural community, the residents are at a loss as to who would perpetrate the brutal crimes and why.

Hanake does not handle the plot as a whodunit but rather has the viewer engage the town itself. We meet several of the families and watch them in their day to day activities as well as their handling of some of the unpleasant matters that arise from time to time.

This is a very unsettling film. The weird, disturbing events mixed with the quite ""proper"" setting mixed with the fact that the events aren't the focus of the proceedings leaves the viewer on edge. That they are not fully explained in the end really puts the capper on things. I found myself running as many scenes as I could remember through my mind to try and put all the pieces together.

It's a great looking film. The gorgeous black and white cinematography, in conjunction with the sets, costumes, hairstyles, etc., really makes the viewers feel as though they are seeing something real. The dialogue is spot on as well. One really gets the sense of the formality of the society of the time.

This is one heck of a movie and, at least in my case, demands more than one viewing to soak in everything that is going on.",1277942400,,1534,4.487455197132617
3897020,5,B002BWP4A6,"Strange ""accidents"" and crimes occur in a small farming village in Northern Germany on the eve of World War I.  As the incidents escalate, dark secrets of the seemingly peaceful Protestant community are revealed, and the local schoolteacher begins to believe that his students might be responsible for these malevolent events.

The children of this German village are members of the generation who grew up to embrace Nazism.  Their seemingly passive community is, in fact, a cruel, authoritarian society, primarily controlled by the local Baron, who employs half of its citizens, and the seemingly unfeeling minister.

Bitterness proliferates among the powerless, particularly its young people, which makes them the prime suspects when the terrible events begin to take place.

On the other hand, as we learn more about the individuals in this village, one begins to wonder if a single person or group is committing these various brutal crimes, or if they are totally unrelated.  Virtually everybody seems to have a malicious motive.

All of the performances are exquisite; the actors, totally unknown to this writer, appear to have stepped out of early 20th century photographs of rural European life.

Like he did with his 2004 thriller, CACHE, director Michael Haneke presents us with an engrossing, deliberately paced mystery, yet he does not give us a precise solution to the enigma.  Clues abound, but at film's end, it is up to the viewer to put the puzzle pieces together...if he can.

THE WHITE RIBBON is perhaps the richest-looking black-and-white film to come along since color movies became the norm, which is certainly why the cinematography was Oscar-nominated.

3897061,5,B002BWP4A6,"I think that Michael Haneke is a genius.  I just want that to be made clear.  His depictions of violence and their effect on humanity are just outstanding to watch and contemplate.  He really understands his vision, his subject and his goal as an auteur.  Yes, Michael Haneke is one of the most influential and more talented directors we have working today; maybe even ever.

`Das Weisse Band' is possibly his best film yet; although it is a tough call really.

The film takes a stark look at a German village on the eve of World War I.  The film opens with a malicious accident that injures a doctor.  From there events only get more and more bizarre, and brutal.  It appears that something strange is happening in the village, something that seems to involve the children.  Some of the children are abused, possibly by one another, and accusations and retaliations are made that result in a rift through the village.  As the film draws to its conclusion (nearly two and a half hours later) we are left with the biter realization that we may never know fully what went on in that village.  Yes, in true Haneke fashion, the ending is as ambiguous as possible without distracting from the films overall impact.

You don't know, but in a way you always have known.

In the film the `white ribbon' represents innocence.  It is a ribbon tied to the children of a certain household.  When they become involved in something their parents consider unsavory, that ribbon is removed.  For me this was a central part in the films underlying message.  This is very much a film about lost innocence.  Yes, Haneke (as per usual) is investigating acts of violence (and there are some serious acts here) and how they effect a community, an individual, the audience; but there is another layer here that adds to the films poignancy.

Whether or not these children were directly involved in the atrocities we witness, they witnessed them none-the-less and were affected accordingly.  How fitting too when considering the films setting; just shy of the war that would define a complete loss of innocence.

I fear of giving too much away here (although this film begs to be analyzed, explored and discussed).  I don't want to ruin this experience for anyone, so I'll refrain from getting into the plot and or revelations any more than I already have.  Instead, I'll now switch my focus to the technical merits at play here.

From the acting to the cinematography to the sound (yes, I said SOUND), this movie is simply perfection.

I'll start with the crisp and direct direction.  The way that Haneke frames each scene adds to his focus here.  He layers his shots with the same sense of ambiguity that he layers his script.  He shows you just enough, just as he tells you just enough.  That script may be the best of 2009, for it continues to unveil layers long after the film has finished.  The cinematography is simply stunning, the rich black and white laying a haunting finish over Haneke's imagery; allowing the deep, darkness of the tonal message to seep in through the eyes.  The ensemble as a collective piece is also very engaging; brilliantly used (especially the numerous child performers who all nail their characters internal and external complexities).  There are far too many to list them all, but personally the films standout performance comes from Burghart Klaussner, who plays the Pastor.  There is such depth to his performance, emoting so much with his eyes as he observes his children and contemplates their failings.  The stern paternal shell subtly shifting to allow us a glimpse of his own fears is just so `organic'.

This film as a whole is just that; organic.

As `Das Weisse Band' draws to a close, I find the tension in my body reaching the maximum, for I'm sure (positive) that my eyes are bound to opened.  At first, as the inevitable sinks in (that understanding that my eyes are going to remain closed) I find that tension releasing, but then I chomp down once more.  The unknown is far more haunting than a factual explanation, and Haneke's brilliant decision to (once again) keep things `hidden'* creates an even more poignant and provocative film experience.

*Yes, this is a direct homage to `Cache' (or `Hidden'), which could very well be Haneke's finest film, that is if `Das Weisse Band' isn't.",1275004800,,4315,4.747311827956989
3897062,2,B002BWP4A6,"I'm no stranger to Michael Haneke's movies, especially when it comes to the ones that have often gotten much attention. Haneke is a very interesting person; however it also goes without saying that I have only seen one movie of his that I enjoyed: The Piano Teacher. What was great like that was its suspense buildup and its dark comedy. There are some scenes wher eyou don't know if you should be horrified or humord (BTW people, Haneke even said it himself that he looks at the movie as a Dark Comedy).

However, Of all the moives I've seen (the mentioned PT, alongside Cache, Funny Games US, White Ribbon and Seventh Continent), I've only really enjoyed PT. I find the trouble with Haneke is that his movies, while they aim for something, end up making Haneke someone who hates his audience. For example, Funny Games, a movie I despised, tried to get the ""Kids, violence is bad, mmkay?"" message across, but ended up beating the piss out of the audience with it. It's almost as if he has no respect for his audience, and like my dad always said, ""Difference doesn't equal talent"".

The White Ribbon, while being slightly better than the average Haneke movie, is unfortunately a hair different than the rest. What managed to keep me interested was its gorgeous B&W cinematography; it was very creepy brooding. However, the film's snail pace and shallow story prevents it from getting anywhere, and in the end, the film relies on its gorgeous cinematography to carry on for two and a half almost pointless hours.

Basically here we have an interesting concept- taking place in a town in pre-WWI Germany, a series of disturbing happenings including an (overly fake and CG'ed) accident which happens at the beginnng. More disturbing crimes keep happening, and nobody will admit to doing it, which leads to resentment towards the town leaders. More accidents keep happening and people still don't know who is responsible; though it is hinted at times that the Children could be the people in charge.

This sounds interesting. That's what I thought before entering the theatre. However, since most of the accident scenes are simply implied, the movie's mystery becomes harder and harder to follow. What is even more frustrating is how Haneke ends the movie without even providing a proper resolution. But while that worked for ""The Piano Teacher"" because it left the viewer with a sense of foreboding, here it just leaves the viewer angered.

In short, this movie was a mediocre way to spend 140 minutes, which felt longer, and while Haneke may be making art, art is as art does and the movie does very little. In short, it's a very grand argument in style over substance, though I guess would be recommend worthy for its B&W visuals.",1274140800,10,2730,4.8
3897063,4,B002BWP4A6,"Michael Haneke's latest may well be his greatest.  It's a masterful depiction of the unraveling of a village, in the years leading up to the first World War.  It's a dark film, but I don't think it's bleak.  It is narrated by a hopeful young teacher, whose own sights are raised above the pettiness and insensitivity and unspoken class rivalries that lead the villagers to be mutually suspicious.  At first it is his lofty ideals, his generous spirit and the fact that while he is not naive he nevertheless expects his peers and students to treat one another with basic decency.  Later it is because he is falling in love.  Nevertheless, the story he tells, from a vantage point of age, and likely in the aftermath of the horrors of another even darker war, is a harrowing one.

It all starts when the local doctor is thrown from his horse, by a hidden wire set deliberately to harm him.  There is, later, a fatal accident, and subsequent acts of apparently unmotivated cruelty, and at the same time motivations for such crimes begin to mount.  As villagers begin to suspect one another, we as the audience cannot help but suspect nearly every one of some kind of guilt, if not direct complicity with the crimes; and our attention is drawn increasingly to an outwardly respectful and pretty young woman, daughter of the local pastor and on the brink of communion, who seems to be something of a ringleader to the children.

Haneke is too clever (and perhaps too perverse) to resolve easily the many tensions that make watching this an unsettling experience, something akin to intellectual horror.  It should not be a spoiler for anyone who's seen any of Haneke's films that ambiguities and uncertainties remain at the end.  At the same time, there are enough moments of light and sympathy, and occasional but rare comic relief, especially in the blossoming romance between the narrator and the nanny to the local baron, that the film manages to sustain intrigue and enjoyment, such that the difficulty of the subject doesn't overwhelm the experience.  Like most of Haneke's films, The White Ribbon manages to provoke and intrigue while provoking questions without easy answers.  This film is perhaps closest in spirit and feel to some of Ingmar Bergman's early emotional dramas, exploring religion and faith in the context of interpersonal conflict, such as his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Through-a-Glass-Darkly-Trilogy/dp/B0000A02TX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Through a Glass Darkly Trilogy</a>.

3897064,5,B002BWP4A6,"And here I'd thought I had an original thought -- similar to the writer's thoughts in the Amazon editorial review, I walked out of my local art house feeling like I'd just finished a very disturbing, emotionally draining, beautifully shot Twilight Zone episode.

It really is an apt comparison. The film is shot in black and white, characters just don't seem fully present, like spooky people in old Twilight episodes often appear. Add to that a distinctly eerie lack of soundtrack, and it's almost as if you're watching an alternate universe.

Of course, wouldn't we all like to believe the Holocaust never happened? Wouldn't we all just like to pretend it's a product of mass over-imaginative hysteria? Or an alternate history? Or something akin to the War of the Worlds scare?

Why yes, we would. But no, we can't.

Many a criticism has been lobbed at this film, and depending on the critical perspective you choose to employ, the criticism is quite accurate: Are we to believe that the holocaust was made possible because of the manner in which a generation of German children were raised? Of course not. But that's not the point of the film, and to criticize the film from that perspective says more about the reviewer's discomfort with the more disturbing elements of the film. Simply put: this film is NOT meant to be any sort of factually based indictment of Germanic parenting. Leave that to documentary, not fiction, if such a case can be made.

Instead, let's not forget that film can also be a work of art, the product of a writer and director's imagination, an expression of identity, a record of simply nothing more than what might have been on the writer's or director's mind as the content of the film was created and revised.

Isn't that enough?

The White Ribbon is a brilliant, beautiful, ugly and abhorrent masterpiece. By all means, see it.",1270512000,11,1861,4.778816199376947
3897065,5,B002BWP4A6,"The title to the review echoes a book title by Swiss pyschoanalyst Alice Miller.  For those that found the film incomprehensible, a reading of her work, along with Arno Gruen's ""The Betryal of the Self"" and ""The Insanity of Normalcy"" may help to set the mood.  Having resolved that I would only be able to see this film on DVD, I was elated to see it on the marquee of the local art theater.  Viewing ""The White Ribbon"" on the big screen was well worth the admission and the ~2.5 hr run time.

In Haneke's interviews about this film, he makes it clear that this work was set in a time and region in which he felt very at ease with his writing and directing.  He makes it equally clear that the sentiment of the film is portable to any situation in which hierarchical oppression takes place.  It is this latter quality that gives the film its universality.

The film does a particulary good job of showing children exercising (testing) their autonomy and posing moral dilemmas to their parents and caretakers, in essence requesting of the adults a framework or path to follow.  What results are answers delivered as physical blows, psychological torture, and models of imprisonment.  [It's bad enought to have the pastor's domestic song bird in the cage;  let's go one step further and replace it with the wild one.] If one considers that children are actually fundamentally good and looking for avenues through which to express this yearning, then the obvious lies and hypocrisy and oppressive physical and psychological blows that they experience come as a confusing, and ultimately angering, surprise.  This inconsistency between their natural strivings and the influences of their mentors results in a diabolical self-hate, turned inward as in the case of the farmer's suicide and outward in the many secret violent acts meted out on the villagers. At precisely the point at which the pastor must surely admit that his own children are complicitous in the violence, he berates the schoolmaster for even proposing such horror and threatens him with slander and imprisonment. The cycle is complete as the disciple of truth and honesty fulfills and embodies the hypocrisy of the town's authorities.

To me, you could simply change the modes of oppression, insult, and debasement, and its message would be as applicable anywhere today.",1269820800,4,2334,4.926020408163265
3897066,5,B002BWP4A6,"Michael Haneke, director of Cache, now brings us an equally disturbing, tension-filled story told entirely in beautiful black and white cinematography, ""The White Ribbon."" Taking place in pre-WWI in a small Protestant German village, religion and fear take their toll on the villagers as mysterious events and ""accidents"" take place around their peaceful town. The mystery of who might be behind it grows stronger every day and perplexes everyone. The most disturbing part is the fact that it seems children might be the source of the evil. I will be giving a bit more synopsis than I normally would, but I think it's important to properly understand the story.

This is not a film for the average movie-goer because it moves slowly, it's quiet, there are subtitles, it's not in color, it's cranked full of symbolism, and let's not forget it's two and a half hours long. However, if you are a film buff and like artsy stuff as well, this is your cup of tea.

I really enjoyed Haneke's strong build of suspense throughout the film. For an R-rated film, there is not a lot of on screen violence. Taking place off screen, you are left to imagine the consequences most of the time and that can be scarier still. Walking around slowly in this old creaky houses waiting for something to happen will keep you alert and interested and the time passes by quicker than you'd think.

This is a strong patriarchal culture. Father sets down the rules and the punishments for even the smallest of misbehavior and the degree of intensity and psychological damage being inflicted doesn't leave a lot of room for surprise that this could have been part of the generation of children who grew up to be Nazis. The children test their boundaries to see what they can get away with and the more they get away with, the easier greater crimes seem to be. Not that the adults are any better! The adults' infractions and bad qualities are laid out for the audience and all members of this society are concerned with proper punishment above all else.

The actual ""white ribbon"" is a punishment itself to be worn by the pastor's children after they act up. The white color is to remind them of the innocence and purity they should be seeking in their everyday lives and they have to wear them for the world to see.

The story is presented to us over a long period of time by a narrator who is schoolteacher to the children. His subplot also lends the film its only beacon of shining light as he falls in love with a nanny and attempts to woo her.

The children in this film seem mature beyond their years, even the youngest ones. They handle the heavy themes with faces of innocence that conceal the malice that might lay behind them.

This film had the best/worst break-up scene ever. This man laid out the most derogatory base insults upon this woman in such a matter-of-fact matter and it was so utterly raw and scathing, it made my jaw drop.

This is the best foreign language film I've seen in a long time and one of the best movies I've seen this year so far (even though it was released in 2009, it is only just now coming to theaters in my area). It has already won some awards and is up for Best Foreign Language Picture for the Oscars. Not for everyone, but a good hearty meal of a film to the right audience.

Blu-Ray Features:

There is a making of the film feature. They looked at around 7,000 children over the course of six months in casting the ten main child roles. Any children that were second choices ended up filling up the background in classroom and church scenes. There is some amazing audition and rehearsal footage of the children running through certain scenes and fascinating to see how normal and modern they look since their costumes and manner fit the time period so well that one could have believed they were just snatched through a time rip! Many of the adult actors were fascinated with the story and fought to get into this project. Not enough weathered-looking people could be found locally so the search went out to places like Romania where people had it much harder and could look more appropriate for the time period. The awards and nominations for cinematography were well earned, not only because of the beautiful final product, but in seeing how much they had to deal with cameras jamming and other problems during the process.

In Haneke's films, you never see any direct violence, but the humiliation factor of turning the children into outcasts or failures is horrible enough on its own to let the audience imagine the rest. Haneke talks at length in a feature called ""My Life"" about his upbringing, film experience, influences, and reasons for certain styles he uses in his work. This is a very detailed look at the career of Michael Haneke from his perspective and others who have worked with him.

There is a feature of footage of the cast and crew at the Cannes Film Festival where the film won the Golden Palm. They take place on a panel for a lengthy Q&A session with the audience talking about the themes of the film and motivations behind the characters.

Besides trailers and previews, there is also ANOTHER feature interview with Michael Haneke discussing the film. With all these extras, this Blu-Ray is packed with everything you could want to know about ""The White Ribbon"". Beaucoup d'extras!

His works, like ""Seven Continents,"" ""A House At the Lake,"" and ""The Piano Teacher"" are quite troubling in may ways and in these works he often keenly captured the downside of the Postmodern Aesthetic, where often the world seems upside down.

This work is different; rather than a post modern turn Haneke's work has an almost premodern, very austere, sensibility with it's portrayal of a nearly feudalistic German farming town the edge of of WWI. As is in his other works, particularly ""A House on The Lake."" there is an increasing sense that something is not quite right in this bucolic setting.

The town's wealthier people (a Baron, a Minister, a Doctor, and a landowning farmer)all have a profound sense of entitlement, fatalism and are generally not nice people. The farmers,a modern version of medieval serfs, seem slightly more light hearted, but there is an increasing sense of dis-ease surrounding them. The only decent major character is the local school teacher, who also acts as the omniscient narrator looking back from the future (the narrator, the moral weaknesses and the black and white photography reminded me a bit of American film noir). Also the narrator who was 31 in the picture and sounds at least in his mid sixties (a time of the great war(s) and unprecedented bloodshed in the not too distant future). Besides the teacher and, to a lesser degree the baron's wife, the only really decent and caring people are from elsewhere (e. g.; Eva the teacher's shy but direct love interest, and the Italian woman who is brought back from Italy bu the Baroness to take care of her emotionally scarred children- however the investigative police brought in to solve the mysteries had a mean, almost gestapo like approach to ""law and order.""

The plot is marked by a series of heinous crimes and mishaps, which symbolize both the the town's hypocrisy and the looming danger of ""The Great War(s)""  ahead. There is definitely a lot of familial viscountess here: the doctor's incestuous relations of his daughter and sadistic treatment of his midwife, the mean spirited actions of the Baron towards his employees, his workers and his family, the punitive treatment of the somewhat hypocritical minister towards his children: for example his tying his young adolescent sons hands during the night to prevent any nervous degeneration through masturbation, which for Victorian age Europeans was often thought as the cause of many major maladies; as well as the white ribbons he forces his children to wear, like a scarlet letter, for their very minor moral transgressions.

Finally I assert this movie is an allegory of the beginning of the Germanic quest for domination (and a microcosm of the then German national identity that carried out the ""final solution) , which portends to atrocities, death, and destruction yet to afflict all Germans- including those in remote hamlets like this movie takes place. The children who face varying levels of blind brutality in 1913-1914 in this bucolic setting could very well play a major role in the Nazi induced horrors 25+ years later. And the sadism they are exposed too in their tiny town they could well have led too such sadism inflicted on the world by the German people.

Although shot in a small setting, this is a big, and extremely though provoking, movie, and is definitely worth looking at twice due to the subtle nuances and the underlying thematic elements. As usual Haeneke, a little like Lars Von Trier (e. g.; his movie ""Europa""),provides a disturbing message about the past, the present and the future.",1268611200,15,3645,4.957446808510638
3897068,3,B002BWP4A6,"sigh, like most things i write about on here i don't expect most of you to relate with me here. maybe i just don't have a taste for true foreign film, but i did not enjoy this movie and it had nothing to do with the fact that it was not fast paced, or that it was in black and white. i actually really enjoyed the look that the black and white film brought. it promised a lot to me i think that never felt satisfied. i did not find the mystery of the town too curious or mind boggling and the things i did see that were obvious to understand i did not feel better off knowing about it. i did not enjoy the character of the doctor who had some very disturbing demons haunting him it seemed. all i can do is share what i was able to take away from the film. the cinematography was vibrant and alive. the town was eerie but more in a sad neglected way, not really in a mysterious caper sort of way. i did not feel attached to any character as i kept having a feeling that somewhere along the story a disturbing trait of some kind was going to reveal itself about each of them. i don't need happy endings, or feel good characters, but this film leaves something to be desired. i appreciate the artistic vision, as i did in amelie (wasnt a fan of amelie either..) but the movie did feel pointless to me. if anyone knows a movie about german people that is not about war or crazy towns people id like to know.",1266969600,3,1403,4.068592057761733
3897069,3,B002BWP4A6,"So, I decided to see this movie after watching its review on At the Movies.  What struck me was A.O. Scott's sour reaction to Haneke's films, for what he described was Haneke's tacit statement that European liberalism stems from a guilt over the Holocaust, the World Wars etc.  I don't know if I'm missing something, but I didn't pick up on that at all - in either this movie or his previous one, Cache.

I left the movie with more questions than anything.  What is Haneke trying to say about the roots of German fascism?  Is he trying to say anything at all?  The only thing I took away from the movie was an eerie appreciation of the repressed sadism and evil percolating in this small town.  Those kids are really creepy, and that physician is devoid of humanity.  May be someone with a better understanding of existentialist or nihilist thought would more appreciate this film than me.  Nonetheless it cultivates a spookiness, a malaise I haven't experienced in a film for a long time.  Overall, it's worth seeing but jeewiz it felt really long.",1266451200,10,1049,4.621621621621622
3897070,4,B002BWP4A6,"I think it was back in November when I first saw a trailer for the Michael Haneke film Das Weisse Band (The White Ribbon). Initially the film appeared uninteresting but when I saw a trailer for it again in December I really paid attention to it and I thought to myself as soon as it opens up in Minneapolis, I will go see the film.

I recently went to see The White Ribbon this month and I found myself constantly thinking about it after I left the theater. The time period of the film takes place just a year before World War I in a small German village. The village is plagued by a series of strange events that leads to human suffering. First the village's doctor is seriously injured when his horse trips over a thin wire. The doctor has to spend a lengthy time in the hospital. Another strange incident involves the baron's son who goes missing and is later found bound and tortured. A similar incident involving the midwife's mentally handicapped son occurs. Also a suicide, a barn burns down, and a young boy is restrained to his bed for admitting he self pleasuring himself happens through out the film. A lot of these strange events (not all though) somehow involves some of the children in the village led by the pastor's eldest daughter Klara.

What makes this film so compelling and engaging is that the filmmaker does make this film a who done it? type of mystery but rather focus on human nature and just the levels of cruelty that some people (young and old) are willing to go. The one thing about the film that I didn't particularly care for was the narration. I could have easily done without that but I suppose if the film did not have the teacher's narration (when he is older) it would have left a void in the film. At times the film prodded a little too slowly but overall I enjoyed the film immensely.",1266019200,,1823,4.4226190476190474

8362252,5,B002BWP4A6,"Michael Haneke, the director of this masterpiece, has said that this film looks at the root causes of evil, and there are some heinous acts committed in this film. I won't spoil anything here, but if you have seen the film, there is a scene involving ""earrings"" that caused me to have a physical reaction to the horror of what I was seeing. Great acting all around. Beautiful cinematography and direction as well. I could not think of a single flaw in this film. It perfectly assembles all of the story arcs together in a way that feels completely natural. It manages to convey varying tones from humor to sadness to horror without the use of music, which is incredibly impressive. I cannot wait to see more films from this director who I discovered recently from YMS, and I give this film an A+",1515024000,2,795,4.527777777777778

8362254,2,B002BWP4A6,"I am only giving this movie two stars in spite of its lofty award at Cannes, the artistic look of the film  and the rather excellent acting in the movie.  The low rating is for two reasons.  The rather long and plodding build up at the beginning of the movie and the dull enigmatic ending.  That only leaves the middle of the movie that I can say began to really pique my interest and I was looking for the climactic satisfaction of the reveal at the end.  However, someone decided that was not needed.  I began to sense, toward the end. that there was not enough time for it all to be revealed and I said, right out loud, ""Oh no, you are not going to do that!""  Not after I stayed invested in this film for two hours.  Who does that?  I can only say that the Cannes jury got this one way wrong.  I guess it is too late to get my $3.99 back from Amazon.  I am not a director but this is one movie that I understand so well...the idea of guilt and punishment.  Too bad I wasn't at the helm on this one.  The children would have had their moment to shine rather than slinking around peaking in and out of windows like innocent bystanders!!!",1494720000,,1138,4.118181818181818
