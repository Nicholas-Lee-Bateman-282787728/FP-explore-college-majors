2211648,2,B0007GP6T2,I thought this was decent. It had some good scares in it. For all the buildup I would have liked an ending that made a little more sense. Decent acting and film quality for a lower budget horror.,1203724800,,195,4.157894736842105
2211649,1,B0007GP6T2,"If Hell's Gate eventually does open, it's my sincere hope that this movie will trot on over and tumble inside. It's simply awful. Despite what other reviewers have said, neither the acting nor the production values are the problem. The real downfall - as with most bad films - is the writing. The story simply falls apart. The production values are actually quite strong, and this is most evident in the opening sequences which are both eerie and suspensful as they reveal the historical background behind the current plot. However, once the current story gets underway, it's utterly predictable, which is a fatal flaw in a horror flick. You are left not-caring one whit for any of the characters, including the main ones. It was embarrassing to watch this movie, and it's occurred to me that's it's even embarrassing to be writing about it. If you're considering renting this one, don't waste your money, and if it's on TV for free, don't even waste your time.",1166400000,,961,4.795180722891566
2211650,2,B0007GP6T2,"I was disappointed to get this movie for the price. However, I was pleased w/ the shipment. I strongly recommend anyone tempted to buy this to either save their money and rent it or try to get it really cheap. The movie just wasn't what I was hoping it would be.",1127865600,3,262,4.1568627450980395
2211651,2,B0007GP6T2,"HELL'S GATE 11:11 is heavy on atmosphere and for a while, it maintains an eerie and involving plot.  Unfortunately, it careens into such pseudoreligious paranoia, it defeats itself and ends up being nothing more than a muddled and incoherent mess.  No name actors here folks and while it almost makes a stand in the seemingly unending spate of horror films coming out lately, it ultimately ends up being just another waste of time and celluloid.",1127088000,,445,4.92
2211652,2,B0007GP6T2,"As a fan of occult horror films I'm always on the lookout for a good one--they are few and far between.  ""Hell's Gate 1111"" came pretty darn close.  It had a great premise, and even though the storyline was a bit murky through the first half of the movie, it moved along and straightened out rather nicely toward the end.  The problem with the movie was the end.  It was much too abrupt and so confusing that one wonders if it isn't quite complete.  Personally, I think the production company ran out of money and just slapped some alternative footage in to finish it off.",1125014400,3,572,4.40952380952381
2211653,2,B0007GP6T2,"Ok, let me see how I can explain this. A girl has a guardian angel that steers her away from danger and kills anyone that messes with her. Eventually it is revealed that the guardian angel is a demon of some sort that now wants to kill the girl she once protected and any or all of her friends. All righty then! The acting is terrible, probably why you never heard of any of these clowns in it.",1124755200,2,394,4.064102564102564
2211654,4,B0007GP6T2,By reading the first review I thought this movie was going to be terrible because most straight-to-DVD thriller/horror movies are. I turned out to be decent. The acting is average and the movie is sort of confusing. I would give this film three stars but I'm giving it four because the movie summary review is at 2.5/5.,1124150400,2,319,4.614035087719298
2211655,1,B0007GP6T2,"So I was in the video store the other day and there was an awesome sale going on. Half off. I spotted this beauty. I read the back and thought, ""Wow this sounds good"" So I buy it at a wopping $3.81. I get home hoping this is going to be good. To my dismay, no it wasn't!! I don't even know where to begin with this thing. It was crap. See, I love indie films so I thought this might be like one. Nope!!! I've seen some pretty bad movies but this one is in the top five worse movies I've wasted my time watching. All I can say is thank god for me being able to return this piece of crap of a movie!!

Now if you're like me and love to watch different movies. You might read the plot to this and think hey this sounds good. It's just not so. The acting is horrible!! The main actress is bad, her facial expressions made me want to jump through the screen and slap them off her face. It was so overly annoying I eventually just had to stop looking at her when she was on. The ""suspensful"" moments weren't. Those scense have been done before. It wasn't the least bit scary. In fact I was falling asleep!! There is nothing else I want to say except that I was highly dissapointed with this movie. It could have been a good movie. Don't waste your time nor your money.",1123977600,4,1262,4.027888446215139
2211656,3,B0007GP6T2,"i just don't understand this film. maybe i am over-analyzing, and this is why i cannot really get a grasp. there are things that i cannot discuss because i don't want to spoil it for someone else who has not seen it. but, suffice it to say, if you are anything like me (analytical, detective, inquisitive, etc.), you will be just as clueless when the movie is over as you where when you first pressed play. i thought the main actresses' facial expression were quite comical, although i'm not sure they were meant to be. others have complained that the movie overall was crap, in terms of production, acting, etc. personally, i don't think these were the worst set of actor/actresses i have seen, but not emmy worthy. had i gone to see it in the theatre, i'd have demanded my money back (i'm not sure if it ever even cam out...)...but at home, i think it's a good film to play repeatedly, to dissect it, for all of us film analysts out there. and it wasn't scary at all. there were a few parts where i was thinking ""oh no"" or ""you better run"", but for the most part i was confused.",1119484800,,1080,4.325123152709359
2211657,4,B0007GP6T2,"I don't like writting summaries for movies, so , i will let some one else take that job. Plus if you read above Amazon gives you the summary of the movie, I don't know if its theres or off of the back of the movie cover, either way its accurate enough, so be happy.

Basically its a very good Ghost movie. Some what creepy,  not overly scary but a bit creepy. If you are into ghost movies its worth the buy. check it out, rent it, buy it what ever I personally wouldnt buy it cause Im more of a slasher/zombie fan.

 But a solid movie with a very cool plot, very good acting,  good pace never gets boring and stays quit interesting, and keeps you focused and awake. I personally thought it was an excellent movie the ending which was not bad, but I wasn't to fond of it think it could have been better, but still not bad.",1116288000,3,821,4.10625
2211658,1,B0007GP6T2,"I should know better when no trailer is available. So i took the chance and was as disappointed as i thought i would be. Bad acting and so so filming. Just couldn't make it any further, so i guess my review is short but to the point.",1404000000,,233,3.978723404255319
2211659,4,B0007GP6T2,Another indie spook movie with some really good acting that will make you wonder what is going on. Good question and the movie ain't bad either.,1402704000,,144,4.576923076923077
2211660,3,B0007GP6T2,"Not bad but not that great, the story line isn't to bad, acting is about the same, its about what you would expect from this type of movie",1391212800,,138,3.9642857142857144
2211661,3,B0007GP6T2,"But the sets are interesting. Spend the movie looking for the 11:11 hidden throughout.

Such as the candles on the table. Or the curtains. You really wouldn't notice unless you were paying attention to the sets or things in the sets instead of the actors.

But, the movie is interesting, just not great.",1390608000,,303,4.69811320754717
2211662,1,B0007GP6T2,Didn't make it past first 15mins acting if awful. The blood looked fake and the story line was going no where.,1381968000,,110,4.285714285714286
2211663,1,B0007GP6T2,"The only real horror in this movie was the hideous faces the lead actress makes throughout the entire thing. Otherwise, this cheesy flick had ZERO fright-factor. It also didn't make a whole lot of sense. She had an ""imaginary"" friend who lived with and looked after her, but you never find out who this ""friend"" was, where she came from, what her motives were, or how she had any connection with the murder of the parents of the lead character. Add all of that confusion to the constant grimaces and looks of disgust, revulsion, and psychotic hysteria on the face of the young woman who portrays the leading role, and the only ""Hell"" in this movie is having to sit through it.",1379894400,,676,4.549180327868853
2211664,1,B0007GP6T2,Title does not match movie subject.  Bad and flat acting and dialog. The best part was the late night library screen and all of the library windows were bright and sunny.,1373846400,,170,4.483870967741935
2211665,3,B0007GP6T2,"Many times I wish Amazon would let you give a star review instead of having to write one because my major complaint about this movie is the facial expressions of the lead actress. I don't like that I'm being so superficial, but they were really distracting.  You know how people say that Emma Watson acts with her eyebrows?  This lead acts with her nostrils and it's just... ugh. If that doesn't bother you then it's an okay movie to waste 90 minutes on - but not if you paid for it.",1370649600,,483,4.2967032967032965
2211666,3,B0007GP6T2,"Confusing, hard to follow plot. Needs better special effects. Characters lacked any special appeal or personality. Already finding it hard to rate, as I've already forgotten it.",1366934400,,177,5.592592592592593
2211667,1,B0007GP6T2,"Hell's Gate 11:11 (Michael Bafaro, 2004)

Bafaro followed up the relatively decent Malcolm McDowell vehicle The Barber with this, a movie whose name should never be used in the same paragraph as the word ""decent"". Its main problem is all too simple to identify: the movie lacks a single empathetic, much less likable, character. This main flaw is backed up by any number of others, most notably the writing, which sounds more like a bad pop song than a film script much of the time (does any sober person over the age of sixteen actually use the phrase ""this is my solemn promise"" in a sentence?). But why stop there? We could go on all day about the terrible lighting (even in the outdoor shots!), some odd sound anomalies,  the barely-competent cinematography, etc. By halfway through this movie I was attempting to watch it with just half an eye in order to preserve what little was left of my sanity. Terrible in every way. ",1365379200,,928,4.646341463414634
8047289,1,B0007GP6T2,Grainy picture. Kinda tired of the little child that wonders off to stumble across evil story line. Didn't get much further than the gate opening in the beginning.,1461715200,,163,4.857142857142857
8047290,1,B0007GP6T2,"Don't pay attention to the positive reviews for this piece of crap. This movie is horrible
on every level. The main character is the most wooden, unappealing actress you can imagine.

The story ( such as it is )  is non-sensical and basically stupid. None of it will make sense
even when the movie ends.

Watch this only if you want to see how really bad films get made. ( And not bad in a good way )",1456963200,,400,4.102564102564102
8047291,1,B0007GP6T2,Don't waste your time,1454544000,,21,4.5
8047292,3,B0007GP6T2,Don't watch this if you're sober.,1431388800,,33,4.666666666666667
8047293,3,B0007GP6T2,"Really interesting in it's unevenness. Some of this works great. Most of the victims have a few moments as a ghost to recognize their deaths. The premise of a demon working with a human for their psychic powers is just slightly different enough to have potential though it's not used enough to really take advantage. A Carrie meets the Omen scenario could have really taken this into great territory.
And then again.....the acting is middling to poor. It's at best distracting, at worst comical, to see how insanely ready everyone is ready to put the worst possible interpretation of the lead characters thoughts and actions even before the demon thing comes into it.
Overall, a serviceable enough piece of work that avoids getting too bad without managing to get very good.",1412380800,2,774,4.916030534351145
