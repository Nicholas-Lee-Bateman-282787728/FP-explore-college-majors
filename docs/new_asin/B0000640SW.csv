Here the english voices are not re-dubbed ( they re-dubbed the voices of majin buu in the orange brick version which is cropped, etc), and the disc offers the original japanese cast.",1392940800,,254,4.3125

7960177,5,B0000640SW,"Ok.  Here's where it all starts to fall apart.  The two mad men that are going on a killing spree anger Buu when they shoot his dog (and later Mr. Satan), releaseing Buu's evil side.  The fat mad man dies one of the freakiest deaths in the seris (looked painful when I watched it).  Get this if you like to see plot twists.",1025827200,3,323,4.079365079365079
7960178,5,B0000640SW,"Well, fisrt of all these are some of the coolest episodes of DBZ I've seen, I have seen all the videos mind you.
-THE EVIL OF MEN (episode 239) In this episode you get to see Mr. Satan kick butt when two men shoot the puppy and blow up Buu's home.
-BUU AGAINST BUU (episode 240) It is the battle of the Buus, when Buu splits in two, Good Buu and Evil Buu, Evil Buu shows his impressive power and appitite, when he eats a chocolate Buu.
-EMPTY PLANET (episode 241) Buu is new and improved, but almost pure evil. Using his new found power level sensing abilities, Buu is able to find the lookout. Once at the lookout Buu demands to see the strong fighter that was promised to him, the sound asleep Goten and Trunks.",1021075200,6,713,4.211678832116788
7960179,5,B0000640SW,"Dragon Ball Z, the Evil Buu series is a show you don't wanna miss! Basing on the hit TV show on the Magin Buu series, its a great continue after. Evil Buu is the mean guy inside Magin Buu. He threatens the Earth! When he says he'll win, he means it, not like Magin Buu who plays around and stuff. And plus, I can play it in my Playstation2!!! It's like having DBZ in PS2!!! You will never regret this episode!",1017878400,,409,4.061728395061729
