1334235,5,B00003XAMO,"I bought Beavers for my 3-year-old daughter because she loved March of the Penguins.

She laughs out loud everytime she watches it, especially when the beavers are eating and cutting down the trees!  And she chooses it more often than Shrek, Toy Story, etc...

It is a wonderful insight into the life of a pair of beavers as they create a home and a family.  It is the best large format documentary I have seen.

Very entertaining, educational and guilt free!!",1140739200,5,460,4.62962962962963
1334236,5,B00003XAMO,"This gem is a rare find and stands alone in its class.  It held me captive all through the highly interesting and entertaining ""making of"" and a really cute silent movie they also tucked on at the end.  If you have a good home theater system, the sound will blow you away.  Gorgeous scenery is highlighted by the heart warming story of two beavers who find their perfect spot to build a dam and start a family.  Superior camera work both above and under water reveals the secret lives of these fascinating and hard working rodents.  This is neither a boring documentary nor an over-dramatized or cutsified depiction of these animals:  they don't need either, simply because they are perfect just the way they are.  I feel very lucky and deeply ingratiated to the people who took the time to make this incredible film and can't thank them enough!",1114214400,7,845,4.630872483221476
1334237,1,B00003XAMO,No reviews for this video as the disk I have got has nothing recorded on it and it has a flat and rough gray inside surface with no silver surface of recorded movie and when inserted into the player a message of No Disk is displayed. As the shipping cost is to be born by the buyer in case a DVD is defective and in my case the shipping cost is much more than the DVD as i have to ship in from India. So I can just throw it in the garbage bin and suggest you guys that kindly watch out for this disk.,1111795200,,500,3.7714285714285714
1334238,5,B00003XAMO,A very pleasant surprise. We laughed and cried... A masterpiece!,1083542400,2,64,5.5
1334239,5,B00003XAMO,"This is just great cinema!  The visual imagery and superior 5.1 DDSS tell a great story about these fascinating creatures.  The narration is kept to a minimum, though the compositions of Eldon Ratheburn add a dimension in music enriching this production.  Andy Kitzanuk's photography with the vision of Stephen Low truly make the beavers 'spectacular'.  Every minute of this film is dramatic in sight, sound, or story.  The humor is just spontaneous.  I can't fathom the effort, time and money that went to making this production.  ""The Making of..."" sequence begins to touch on that. It is well worth the effort.
 As an IMAX junkie, a father of two, and someone who loves nature, BEAVERS is time well spent.  The kids love it, though I must admit, I have watched it more!!  Few films in my DVD library are as entertaining for a group of professional thirtysomething adults too.  I can't find a bad review on this one, and there is a definite reason.  Enjoy it!!",1015718400,25,962,4.728915662650603
1334240,5,B00003XAMO,"In looking for the top rated IMAX DVDs to get for Christmas this one repeatedly came up as a five star just about everywhere I looked, and was never less than four stars.  If you're an IMAX fan, outdoor/animal lover, or just want very high quality entertainment for your home, then you must consider adding this film to your collection.  Its not just a kids film either, all of the adults in our family enjoy it just as much as the kids do.",1009670400,6,440,4.289156626506024
1334241,5,B00003XAMO,This is by far the best IMAX film I've seen.  Informative and humorous....a great selection for adults and children.... a must have for your collection!,1009411200,5,152,5.08
1334242,5,B00003XAMO,"A realy great IMAX-Movie with wonderful pictures and a clearly separted 5.1 Dolby Digital sound. You can hear wispering beavers and how the trees are falling. The making off section shows the hard  work of the film team,  because beavers don't like animal training. Having fun with this movie.",957398400,10,293,4.959183673469388
1334253,5,B00003XAMO,"Very fun and interesting video. Less of a documentary and more of a ""fun with beavers"" movie. Ya feel? Good.",1389398400,,108,4.45
1334254,5,B00003XAMO,"Fantastic video!  My grand daughter talked me into purchasing this instant video, and I'm glad she did!  The underwater shots are nice, the audio very informative.  Takes me back to the 'real life' films they showed in grammar school way back when!",1384992000,,248,4.857142857142857
1334255,5,B00003XAMO,"Mormon Tabernacle CD and Beavers DVD were both excellent 5Stars, while Glory DVD was also very good 4Stars. I am very happy with my purchase.

1334256,5,B00003XAMO,"I originally saw this movie at an Imax theater more than 15 years ago.  It was an unexpected delight.  I recently looked it up to share with my kids (ages 5, 10 and 12).  I still enjoyed it just as much, and they all liked it too.  My 5 year old watched it at least 3 times over the course of the week we had it.  Highly recommended!",1362441600,,333,3.838235294117647
1334257,5,B00003XAMO,"Not only is it fascinating to watch this other mammal do what I thought only humans could do.  But, they are so cute to watch as well.",1347148800,,134,3.962962962962963
1334258,1,B00003XAMO,"I agree with the other complaints that this film is very staged.  The crew knew nothing about Beavers - as seen in the 'making of'....  but what was most disappointing was that I was expecting and exciting IMAX movie and my kids (7 & 5) couldn't be more bored.  After the first 3 minutes, they wanted to turn it off.  So much for an educational movie!!  The black & white is annoying and the music is dreadful.",1334880000,,410,4.2727272727272725
1334259,1,B00003XAMO,"THIS MOVIE WAS SUCH CRAP.  THE WHOLE THING WAS STAGED.  I was amazed until I saw the ""making of  . ."" and I almost turned it off.  The beavers were trained, some of the scenes were done in the studio, AND THE WORST PART, THE MOVIE MAKERS KNOW NOTHING ABOUT BEAVERS.  They LITERALLY proved that they knew NOTHING of the subject they were studying.  If you are interested in seeing a movie that is informative, THIS MOVIE IS NOT THAT KIND OF MOVIE.  DON'T TAKE YOUR CHILDREN OR YOUR GRANDCHILDREN TO SEE IT.  IT IS ALL CRAP.  Also, it was only 30 minutes long and I spent WAY too much money at the IMAX theater for such a short movie.",1294358400,4,632,4.2
1334260,5,B00003XAMO,This DVD has amazing footage of Beavers. The quality of the camera work is excellent.,1279756800,,85,4.733333333333333
1334261,5,B00003XAMO,"We saw this on TV and I looked for this DVD immediately. This is without a doubt the best wildlife documentary I have ever seen. The narration, cinematography,  and images that are captured here are nothing short of astonishing. Our entire family was completely captivated by this. We are not huge Beaver fans, either, but when you see something like this, you can't help but be completely entertained and charmed by this beautiful documentary. Even the music they used perfectly complemented the activities of the beavers. Hard to explain, but you just have to watch it. Enjoy!",1257552000,2,578,4.958762886597938
1334262,1,B00003XAMO,"This is the first time I have been compelled to leave a review. Watching ""Beavers IMAX"" it became rapidly apparent to me that the movie was staged and the filmmakers were putting the subject animals into precarious situations for the sake of the storyline. Am I supposed to really believe that a handheld camera happens to be underwater in the beaverlodge exactly under the area where a marauding bear rips through the logs? What are the chances the very tree a baby bear climbs up happens to then be immediately felled by a beaver and the tree and bear then fallinto the water (where a handheld camera operator happens to be filming underwater)? The thing that really peeved me was when the filmmakers set it up so a bear was chasing and nipping at the tail of a beaver who was running for his life. No -- actually, the worst part was when the filmmakers let a ""beaver-felled"" tree crash into the water, missing by a matter of 4 inches two baby beavers who ""happened"" to be hanging out there and scaring the living poop out of them. I have nothing but disdain for films that fake animal drama and put what are probably tame animals in stressful situations. I Googled my suspicions and indeed found reference to designers B. and R. Van Heuvelan having ""designed and built some of the sets for the Imax film Beavers."" Don't buy this film or you will contribute to the dark side of nature films.",1256428800,21,1393,4.531746031746032
1334273,4,B00003XAMO,"First saw at IMAX, but had to buy it.  Entertaining movie about beavers.  Loses a star, because some of the scenes use ""tame"" beavers (from a zoo or something like that).",1222732800,,170,4.451612903225806
1334274,1,B00003XAMO,"I have never been so compelled to write a negative review.  This film is not good, most definitely not educational, and simply irritating.  I saw this DVD and thought, ""this is going to be great--an imax film about beavers.  How cool is that?""  Well, I was thoroughly disappointed.  The beaver footage was obviously setup and did not represent natural behavior; the background music was obnoxious and not fitting; beavers do not make loud moans and actually they make very little noise at all;  and the film was too ""done up""--if they would have only filmed the beavers and left it at that!  This film was such a let down and a big missed opportunity and cleaver and creative it was not.  Do not buy this DVD and if you do, please do not think anything in this film is educational or factual--oh yah, and if you do choose to put yourself through the misery, put the player on mute so you do not have to listen the fake, irritating beaver noises and the obnoxious, ill-suited background music.",1214784000,7,992,4.564971751412429
1334275,4,B00003XAMO,"Originally saw this movie at a Provincial Park in Ontario, Canada.

The kids loved it and so did I.

Rating: 4 out of 5.",1210464000,,120,3.9583333333333335
1334276,5,B00003XAMO,"Fun and educational.  Who knew what an impact this animals had on the land.  The ending where they discusss how they filmed is also very interesting. I don't have one, but it would probably be even better on a large screen HD set.",1204934400,,230,4.325581395348837
1334277,5,B00003XAMO,"I first found this film on the Discovery Channel and recorded it for my two-year-old grandson.  He was fascinated by it and asked to watch it again and again.  Sometimes when he stayed overnight with me, he'd wake up homesick and crying in the wee hours of the morning.  Often the only way I could calm him was to turn on ""Beavers.""  Okay, I know. . . I know. . . but many parents and grandparents will agree that you do what you have to do to calm a two-year-old in the middle of the night.  Anyway, the point is that this is a beautiful, fascinating, and well-done film about a very interesting animal. I've watched it dozens of times and still enjoy it!  PS: I bought the DVD and sent it home with my grandson.  My daughter and son-in-law love it as much as we do.  If you like nature and wildlife films, buy this one.  You'll love it.",1204329600,,838,4.1875
1334278,5,B00003XAMO,"This is an informative, calming , beautiful movie. I had never seen beavers in action. Seeing how they take down these tall trees and drag them to the water to build their dams. I could watch this movie everyday. I love watching their sweet family life inside the dam. The courting dance they do on the full moon is the sweetest thing I've ever seen.",1173916800,3,350,4.4
1334279,5,B00003XAMO,"This was the first DVD I bought after going flat screen, hi def.  How happy I  was to see this.  It's simply well photographed, and aside from finding out that domesticated beavers were used as stand-ins for the real wild variety, it's a beautifully photographed work.  Plus, I've never had to live with beavers, so I think they're cute.",1171756800,3,337,4.661016949152542
1334280,5,B00003XAMO,"This documentary is not only educational but at times very amusing and entertaining.  The sounds and the music are great and the underwater cinematography is just spectacular.

If you love nature and documentaries, this is G-rated Beaver Cam the whole family can enjoy!",1169078400,5,269,5.232558139534884
1334281,5,B00003XAMO,"This is an amazing video.  Shot in the 1980's this footage still seems vivid and alive!  You get to see the life of a family of beavers from a very great perspective.  The shots are amazing and leave you wondering just how they did that.  The documentary provides a great and almost hilarious look at beavers.  The noises they make are not what I thought a beaver would make.  It sounds like ""Mini-Me"" from Austin Powers whining whenever they want something.  They are cute and interesting which, when combined, make a very funny yet powerful movie.  The length does not do this movie justice.  I would recommend buying this video for children and adults who are interested in beavers or to anyone who wants a quick, educational laugh",1168300800,4,734,4.671875
1334282,5,B00003XAMO,"This is a wonderful film for all ages.  I got this movie for my father's 71st birthday and our whole family watched it together from our youngest at age 3 to our oldest at age 71, we all really enjoyed it and it was a wonderful activity to experience together!  I recommend this film to anyone...even if you aren't a beaver fan...you will be after watching this!",1163030400,2,362,4.388059701492537
7919576,5,B00003XAMO,I showed this movie to my first grade class when we were studying habitats. It amazed them. The cinematography was excellent and the story of this beaver family captivated my young audience as well as myself. We all wanted to move to this magical place.,1440201600,,253,4.644444444444445
7919577,4,B00003XAMO,This is a fun movie suitable for viewing by people of all ages.  The filming in this movie is almost unbelievable and can become hilarious for those who like to guess how it was filmed.  There are lots of opportunities to argue over which animals are wild or tame and why the background lighting is so bright when a beaver couple dance in the moonlight.,1438300800,,353,4.415384615384616
