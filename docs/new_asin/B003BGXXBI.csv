8688961,2,B003BGXXBI,Only 15 min long but I knew that when I bought this. What I didn't expect was for the footage to be at such a low resolution. When I play the film is shows up as a tiny little box in the middle of my screen. Unacceptable. Someone probably mistakenly compressed it for Youtube or something. Also it took the seller 48 days to deliver this package.,1360022400,,346,4.17910447761194
