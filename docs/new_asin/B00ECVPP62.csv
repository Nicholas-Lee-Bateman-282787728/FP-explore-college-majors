5903598,5,B00ECVPP62,"This is a truly lucid, entertaining, deeply researched, and well crafted documentary about John Milius that really caught me by surprise and left me with a much greater understanding of the man and appreciation for his work.

Any fan of film, and especially any student of American cinema or of screenwriting, would be well served by watching this great biography.",1405900800,,364,5.066666666666666

5903600,5,B00ECVPP62,"Provides some insight into the business of screenwriting and the reactions of Hollywood lefties to a more independent creative professional. I had no idea of this man until someone recommended this documentary - though he worked on some of my favorite films (Apocalypse Now, Jeremiah Johnson). I look forward to Genghis Khan. (In the meantime, I recommend the foreign film titled ""Mongol"") Great ending in this documentary, as well.",1403222400,,432,5.27536231884058

5903602,5,B00ECVPP62,A brilliant documentary narrative.  Milius is R\a legend!  His movies are legend.  He is the most interesting man in the world!  :-),1400457600,3,132,4.863636363636363
5903603,5,B00ECVPP62,"I knew a bit about writer/director John Milius but I had no idea how important he was in Hollywood or in the history of film. This documentary drives it home big time.

Here's the scoop. We meet John at a fairly early age and follow him into his teens, through film school and into Hollywood where he turns out to be the right guy in the right place at the right time, until he's the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time.

He was a larger than life human dynamo. His upbringing, and subsequent dissatisfaction with, what he considered a too soft, too pampered atmosphere, propelled him into film school and the need to write, and finally direct, strong, powerful films. And you get back-up on this from friends and fellow directors such as Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas and many others. That he penned some of the heavyweight films of all time is something in itself. But his personal conviction in his vision is what really makes this documentary work.

His uber-machismo posturing was not a front. He loved his guns, motorcycles and surfing. But he brought it to his work. I was beyond inspired when this finished. If everyone had the conviction he had in their work we would be living in a very different world. And all the talking heads interviewed here tell the same story. He was a force to be dealt with. He was going to do things his way. Damn the torpedoes. And when you find out how he doctored scripts in movies for which he never received credit you'll be amazed as well. Sean Connery's better speeches in ""The Hunt for Red October"" were his.

Again. This is more than a documentary. I hope all who view it are filled with the fire to achieve new heights in whatever is their passion.",1400112000,16,1729,4.496815286624204
5903604,4,B00ECVPP62,"What I like most about the film is his position on Vietnam and his buddies as reflected in Big Wednesday.  When they went to the draft induction some wen to great lengths to get out, some got drafted and one wanted to go. There were no heart feeling between them because of what they decided. Contrast that with the current stance many Nam vets take on who went and who didn't. It was complicated and people went or didn't go for  myriad of reasons.",1481760000,,449,4.333333333333333

5903606,4,B00ECVPP62,"A great documentary about a very influential filmmaker from the 1970's and 80's.
The film gives you insight into the man behind huge hits such as ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Dirty Harry"", ""Conan"", and ""Red Dawn.""
It would've been an even better documentary if it devoted a few more minutes to his later work on TV.
( After he was essentially blacklisted from the Major Hollywood studios)
Highly recommended.",1475539200,6,398,4.955223880597015

5903616,5,B00ECVPP62,A very good documentary into the life of a filmmaker. He was not as successful as his colleagues ( Lucas or Spielberg ). He created several good films. A great look at the movie business in the 70's & 80's.,1455580800,2,206,4.175
5903617,5,B00ECVPP62,"If your a fan of Milius's work, have in intrest in film making , have an intrest in history , it even an intrest pop culture I can not recommend Milius enough.
This doc goes far to find out what makes him tick. It also educates those who don't realize just how many films or pieces of films (the best pieces btw , ie : the Jaws monolog about the USS Indianapolis ) he wrote!
I love this doc for all the above reasosns, but especially as cinephile with a particular love for films and the film making period of 1967 1980.
  He was a staple of the ""film brats"" who came out of UCLA and USC film schools. Very close buddies with Spielberg,  Scorsese,  DePalma,  Coppola,  Lucas and so on.
  He was one of the MOST important players in the golden age of 70s film making .
  Larger than life , brash , out spoken , deeply loyal to a fault,  with an almost incomprehensible  ability to write for film.  Still hoping his screenplay for Genghis Kahn  gets made.
  The doc is very moving in its 3rd act . Soni yo7r prone to tears have the kleenex standing by.",1453593600,4,1050,4.175
5903618,5,B00ECVPP62,"If you're reading this then you'll most likely know about the greatness of John Milius.  The fact that a widely disseminated US DVD release of this wonderful documentary on this cinematic creative genius is further evidence that the Idiocracy plot is manifesting itself in modern America.  Oh, and anyone who thinks Mr. Milius scripts and films are just for men hasn't seen The Wind and The Lion's Candice Bergen character.

5903624,5,B00ECVPP62,"I agree with all the reviewers, and I add my voice asking: When will John Milius receive his Honorary Oscar or his AFI Lifetime Achievement Award?  He's got the credentials, and he's got the old friends (Lucas, Spielberg,etc) with the juice to make it happen.  Why hasn't it happened already?  It is definitely past due.",1444608000,2,320,4.781818181818182

5903626,4,B00ECVPP62,"Milius is an American original.

This documentary transported me back to 1975 when I was a student at Rutgers.

Back then I caught a matinee of ""Wind and the Lion"" at Radio City. I remember being startled it was so contra the prevailing national mood back then, including Candace Bergen in a film celebrating US military intervention to solve an international incident.

Meanwhile like Milius, Theodore Roosevelt is a hero of mine and I was just blown away by Brian Keith's performance, especially what he had to say about the American character. I do believe it's the best characterization of TR ever.

But even then I was less enthralled by the portrayal of gunboat diplomacy (which in this case is historically inaccurate) as any sort of solution, which I continue to believe today.

Meanwhile, fascinating documentary of a fascinating man.",1438992000,,843,4.992857142857143

Apocalypse Now

Steven Spielberg called him up and asked for some help with the dialog for the USS Indianapolis speech in Jaws, and he delivered 10 pages, which was worked down to 5 by Robert Shaw.  That speech is why I'm afraid to ever go in the ocean.

The man also wrote one of my top five all time favorite movies: Apocalypse now.  He is a legend.",1430006400,2,450,4.309523809523809

You gotta love a guy that wants to be paid in ""Guns, Girls and Gold.""

It was crystal clear by the end of the film that John Milius is one of the best storytellers and writers of our time has been
seriously short-changed by Hollywood.  You can't undo the past but what about a well-deserved lifetime achievement award? ",1427155200,7,431,4.430379746835443

This is an excellent documentary to let people interested in Cinema know more details about his semi-tragic life. I personally admire the part where he was just working hard to put his kids through school, that says a lot about his heart and soul.
