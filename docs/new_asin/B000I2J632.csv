8143405,5,B000I2J632,"Hollywood has mistreated Sally Kirkland, they should be ashamed. This is one of the few true leads Sally has had in her nearly 50 year career. During her career she received a Best Actress Oscar Nomination, Won a Best Actress Golden Globe Award, received another Golden Globe Nomination, won the Spirit Award for Best Actress and the LA Film Critics Award for Best Actress. While the script isn't fantastic the actors have great chemistry and deliver enjoyable performances.",1459123200,,474,5.089743589743589

8143409,3,B000I2J632,This movie wasn't what I had expected at all. It was too predictable and looked as if it was a low budget film.,1363478400,,111,3.869565217391304
8143410,1,B000I2J632,"I should have known not to download this worthless tripe. What a waste of time. James Brolin went through the motions, and not very well at that. Very little in the way of a plot, other than the family repercussions of a skirt-chasing ne'er do well husband who deserted his family for a younger woman. Nudity and bad language were the final nails in the coffin of this banal flick. But, of course, I should have know that due to the R rating. My mistake. This type of film reminds me of why I much prefer British productions. I'll try to remember that next time I'm looking for something to watch.",1352073600,,597,4.387387387387387

8143413,3,B000I2J632,"this movie was good although it was depressing, the characters were such sad people.  I think they could of done with less bad language.  Swear words do not help make a movie better.",1178928000,,182,4.484848484848484
