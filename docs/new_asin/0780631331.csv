33597,5,0780631331,"This is a very interesting account of the life of the famous aviator.  Narrated by Stacy Keach and hosted by David McCullough, it includes interviews with Lindbergh's widow, Anne, and their children, Jon, and Reeve.  This documentary attempts to define a complex, and often controversial figure of the first half of the twentieth century.  Also included: commentary by several noted historians.  A must see for any Lindbergh fan!",902534400,,429,5.264705882352941

LBJ's segment is my particular favorite.  While men with FDR and JFK's personality could be elected today... the days of men like LBJ... for good or bad... are over.  He was way too animated and crude for today's candidate... which makes for wonderful recollections and storytelling found in his DVD.",1077926400,3,492,5.049382716049383
7789702,5,0780631331,"Wonderful package-anybody who has seen one of the various documentaries under the PBS ""American Experience"" banner does not have to be told how terrific they are.  ""The Republicans"" set is equally good, and the transfers are stunning.",1004313600,5,234,5.324324324324325
7789703,5,0780631331,"While there are many video documentaries available on the U.S. presidents,  few are as insightful, objective and informative as this series from PBS.  In fact, many teachers and professors have been known to use these films as an introductory basis for their students, and although they are long, about 12 hours combined, you will come away from the ""experience"" knowing much more about the presidents than you could ever have thought possible.  In that vein I would suggest this series is the equivalent to reading a good 300-400 page biography of each leader separately.  For anyone with an interest in U.S. history this series is a must own!

7789706,5,0780631331,"In a fair and objective manner ""Lindbergh, the Shocking, Turbulent Life of America's Lone Eagle"" examines the life of one of the world's most controversial heroes.  Charles Lindbergh captured the hearts of the world when he crossed the Atlantic nonstop in a solo flight in 1927.  He  seemed to embody the ""can-do"" American spirit.  This film  certainly covers Lindbergh's flight and the resultant fame of that flight.  It also examines Lindbergh as an intensely private man who never became  comfortable with his fame.
The film chronicles all major aspects of  Lindbergh's life including his rather distant relationship with his  parents, his air mail service days, his historic flight across the  Atlantic, the kidnapping of his first child, and his shocking stand on  racial superiority right before America's involvement in World War II.  This documentary carefully explores Lindbergh's involvement in the America  First movement and his stand on the racial superiority of certain countries  including Germany, which greatly damaged his status as an American hero and  caused many countries to brand him a Nazi.  Lindbergh's visit to Germany  and his reports that the Germans were unbeatable in the air also turned  President Roosevelt against him.
Although only an hour long this film,  through contemporary newspaper accounts, personal journals of Lindbergh and  his wife, and interviews with Lindbergh's colleagues and children captures  his celebrated and controversial life.  Highly recommended.",956361600,3,1503,5.52863436123348
7789707,5,0780631331,"Let me say that this is the best video I have seen on the Kennedys. It is a powerful rollercoaster ride through the Kennedy legacy. Tragedy, hope, and success is all here. More importantly, the video touches on Marilyn  Monroe, but it is not a video tabloid. These type of Kennedy videos are  hard to find. Great, great, video!!!",939600000,9,329,4.559322033898305
