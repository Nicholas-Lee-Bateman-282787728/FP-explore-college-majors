2549872,5,B000F2N4FG,"If you like movies like LA DONNA LUPO,THE DREAMERS or CLOACA,this is your movie. Anna(GRY BAY) is very hot in this movie, there's one scene where she is painting a room wearing nothing but a shirt. The sex scenes are explicit and there's even some oral sex. One of the best scenes is where she is spread over a table by her former lover but my only complaint is that it's slightly dark. Don't think it's just about sex either,the story is very romantic and your girlfriend might enjoy it(If she doesn't mind the sex scenes)also,the black bars in the pictures are not in the movie. The 3 Disc Set is beautifully made and it even comes with a booklet full of photos. A great addition to any collector of the Emmanuelle 3 Disc Set.",1147737600,85,728,4.4

2549874,4,B000F2N4FG,"Part of the Pussy Power productions Lars von Trier founded and co-produced with Peter Aalbek Jensen, this movie is an attempt to create female porn movies with graphic sex scenes but with better script, acting, and cinematography than some of the cheap shlocks in video stores or on the Web. As some reviewers said behind the DVD box, this movie does not repeatedly display close-up of penetrations again and again; praising Lars von Trier for being the first in understanding this.

Therefore, this movie offers a different take on a more obscure part of the film-making business; an objective Jessica Nilson's movie succeeds. Displaying to us the story of a young girl's broken heart and her attempts to calm her pain through one-night stands, work, and a relationship attempt with a man called Frank. All breaking down when her former lover, Johan, crawls back into her life.

Now the movie is not perfect as I found annoying continuity mistakes (ex:shooting locations discordances between Anna's roommate bedroom and Eileen Daily's real bedroom they used for one scene, or illogical time continuity as what happens between Johan's return and Frank's departure occurs in two days, when in real life it would happen in one, two, or three weeks), bad lines in certain scenes (ex:Frank's improvised dialogue with the aspirine), and a badly-post-scripted dialogue between Anna and Camilla as the words Anna says don't correspond with her mouth.
But on its good points, the actors' performances worked well, the cinematography was very nice, especially during the housewarming, the music was wonderful to listen to, offering a nice interpretation of Joan Baez's song I have put as a title for this review, and I found the use of chapter intertitles a good idea as it gives, along with Johan's sea job, a Breaking-the-Waves feel to the movie. Of the love scenes, I particularly adored the one after the housewarming as Johan meets Anna in her apartment and Anna, before making love to him, goes through his sweater's head hole and gets close to his face. With the music, the scene makes the lovemaking very tender and touching.

Now the Scandinavian DVD edition I have bought here offers two versions. On the first disk, we have the Producer's version, which the director did not participate in the final editing, mixing, and grading, while on the second disk, we have the director's, without the music, chapter intertitles, and with different voice-overs. Something that might startle some viewers as it implies there were some tensions during the film's production. An aspect the commentaries on the first disk reveal as Eileen Daly (Camilla) and Mark Stevens (Johan), who did their commentary together, always refer to Gry Bay, the actress who plays Anna, as ""the other actress"". Revealing in their dialogue complicated things that made the production more difficult between the two main actors, though I have to applaud their professionalism as we don't feel any of that tension on the screen.

On its special features, we have funny outtakes, different editing of certain sex scenes like the one between Frank and Anna as in the background passer-bys and neighbours gasping at what they're seeing, and on the DVD-ROM features, we get to have the original script, press statements, and synopsis for the movie.

As a whole, thous it is not perfect, All about Anna is a nice production to watch and possess in your DVD library.",1425254400,3,3426,5.024647887323944

2549896,5,B000F2N4FG,"First of all, appreciate what this movie is trying to be. It's not an in-depth exploration of the dark corridors of the human psyche. It's meant to be entertaining and arousing to women and couples. It's as simple as that. And, as such, basically stands alone as an entirely new genre. I, for one, applaud the effort!

At once engaging and seductive, this film from Danish director Jessica Nilsson melds a shoot-from-the-hip, eclectic visual style with the sensitivity of mature storytelling. It captures the unpredictable, sometimes comical mish-mash of modern relationships while maintaining an undefinable, almost retro aesthetic. All About Anna has found a place all its own. While not certified, the roots of Dogme95 and the association with Lars von Trier's Zentropa are undeniably evident, though tempered by the slice-of-life sweetness of the storyline standing in stark contrast to the traditionally brooding, dark and tragic Dogme films. Anna will warm your heart as well as other things. It's romantic erotica made by, for and about sensuous women.

Just as a side note in response to Mr. Wang's review complaining about the dog in the opening sex scene, you will note that this is Anna's dog. She's seen carrying, petting and playing with this dog throughout the film! I thought it was clever that they showed the dog meandering cluelessly through the scene!",1303171200,2,1370,5.139013452914798
2549897,1,B000F2N4FG,"You probably don't believe it, but this movie is a let down even though it wins a few adult movie awards. There is a fake atmosphere of being an art film and the story is full of cliche. There are three sex scenes with real sex. But the shots are poorly done. The DVD has three different versions of the first sex scene in the paint room. Two longer ones are in the special features section. In this scene, the producer or director's dog wandering out in front of the camera with the actor and actress sweating out their love-making. So, in the final version, a big part of this scene was cut out to avoid this blooper. It reflects two things: 1) she is not a competent director in the first place and 2) the set control is poor. In fact, there is not set. Only two cameras shooting love making in a windowed room. Is the movie erotic. NO. Are those scenes erotic ? Not really. There are much better sex scenes in other R-rated movies with simulated sex. The bottom line: I wouldn't go back to watch it again. I need to put it on e-bay to sell it at half of the price I paid. That shows how lame the movie is.",1298851200,9,1109,4.138888888888889

2549902,4,B000F2N4FG,"This movie was pretty nice in its use of sexuality in a cinematic production. There were not too many erotic sex scenes but when their was, you could tell that actual penetration was involved.

2549908,2,B000F2N4FG,"First of all I must say that I am rating this film based simply on my reception of its story and dialogue, as I know nothing about any of the other criteria often used in evaluating a film's merits. The film may indeed be praiseworthy in regards to the criteria on which I am not qualified to speak, and so the film is not to be discouted entirely. As far as the plot goes, however, this film offers the same old, tired story line about what women, in this particular case ""Anna"", expect from men in their inter-personal relationships. As for the dailouge, clichs abound and the English skills of the writers and actors prove themselves to be laughably poor; good grammar and proper pronunciation are overlooked in too many cases which not only makes the dialouge seem all the more high-school-play-like, but makes it also very difficult to understand in parts.
But this is not unique to this film, as many films not written, directed and performed by native speakers of English use, or should I say abuse, English just a poorly as was done in this film (some are even worse in this regard!).
HOWEVER, the love scene between the two women is very erotic!!, hence the two stars. In fact, I recommend renting or even buying this film for that scene alone.",1219622400,12,1253,4.573333333333333
2549909,1,B000F2N4FG,"PROS: Gry Bay's (plays Anna) natural beauty, and good effort at trying to make this weak film work.
CONS: Producer's Cut. This had lots of voice-overs, most of which treated the audience as dummies, explaining to viewers mostly what is already seen on screen. Rather than just play out the important plot points through drama, these are explained to audience through VO. The film spends too much time trying to develop characters through VO. The pacing was slow. The drama/story was poorly written and lacked tension, which made me feel little empathy for the characters. The film has mediocre elements of both hardcore and drama. One dimensional portrayals of: Anna's boozy, slut roommate Camilla (Eileen Daly), Frank, and Anna's meat head boyfriend Johan (Mark Stevens). Johan (my co-screener said he resembles Owen Wilson on steroids), seems wooden, despite his so-called ""passion"" for Anna.  Another element that makes this film feel phony is that the lead Bay speaks in halting English, English as a second language. The story takes place in Denmark! The film was billed as an art house film, having real sex scenes. Did the actors really have to perform sex? Perhaps, they should have just faked the sex scenes because from the obscured camera angles, the viewer can't tell the actors are really having sex. ""Faking it"" would have saved the production team time, money and risk of STDs.
Director's cut on 2nd DVD is presented to viewers in a fast forward mode. One cannot watch the film this way, so what is the point of including it?
Conclusion: Don't believe all the press hype over this film. I'm shocked that such a poor film was made by filmmaker Lars Von Trier's production company.  There are better erotic films out there which do not include ""real sex"" such as 9 1/2 weeks, The Secretary, Brokeback Mountain, and Betty Blue, etc. These have much better production value and story.",1212364800,31,1895,4.91875
2549910,5,B000F2N4FG,"This movie received a five-star, Editor's Choice review in the April, 2008 AVN, and it's easy to see why. An English language film shot in Denmark with a European cast, ""All About Anna"" is a one-of-a-kind co-production from Innocent Pictures and Zentropa Productions, best known in the United States for award-winning feature films like Lars von Trier's ""Dancer in the Dark"" and ""Dogville"" starring Nicole Kidman and James Caan.

A slice-of-life mainstream romantic comedy with explicit lovemaking scenes, ""All About Anna"" is erotica made by women, for women and about women. Despite its graphic sexual content, It's not a shadowy dark night of the soul, as earlier, similar efforts like ""The Devil In The Flesh"" and ""The Brown Bunny"" strained to portray. It's simply entertaining and gently arousing, and aimed squarely at ladies and couples. Successful or not (and this critic feels, by and large, that it's a success) ""All About Anna"" represents a new genre: a fusing of the Northern European ambiance and pretty photography of that 60s classic ""Elvira Madigan"" (which this film more than slightly resembles, despite a much more upbeat ending), with a distinct feminist sensibility and startling, you-are- there hardcore photography.

Danish director Jessica Nilsson (whose background includes both award-winning short films and cutting-edge music videos) brings a trendy indie sensibility to the film's visual style; the DIY-roots of Dogme95 and the association with Lars von Trier are combined to make ""All About Anna"" nothing so much as a lush tableaux of desire and abandon.

The deceptively simple story focuses on young Anna (portrayed with an abundance of grace and style by mainstream Danish TV and music star Gry Bay), a young theatrical costume designer, who's focused on her career to the point of shunning romantic entanglements. But her concentration is shattered by a brief encounter with her ex- boyfriend Johan. As she begins to question her choices in life and love, Anna's dilemma ironically stems from her very determination to be an independent, self-actualized woman. While yearning for romance, she fears the pain it may entail - but even more, She fears loneliness even more. In a world where ""no pain, no gain"" seems to take on new meanings all the time, Anna is forced to make a life-defining decision.

Loneliness is certainly one of the most universal subjects of European cinema, from Bergman's weighty meditations on faith to Truffaut's engaging slice-of-life comedies. Thankfully for everyone who dreads the pretentiousness that seems endemic to so much ""serious"" erotica, ""All About Anna"" cleaves to the latter camp.

The much-ballyhooed unsimulated sex scenes emerge as nothing so much as a natural part of the storyline. This simplicity of the explicit content is heightened by the fact that the crew and actors utilized here obviously had no experience in making ""adult"" films. Indeed, porn fans seeking gynecological close-ups and standard-issue ""money shots"" should look elsewhere, as this is one sex movie that refuses to indulge sex movie clichs. In many instances, the camera operator's choice to shoot much of the lovemaking as a series of full body shots seems to actually work against the conventions customary to adult - but they speak volumes in terms of exteriorizing the inner lives of central characters.

Beguiling Gry Bay (who, whether intentionally or not, is a dead ringer for the actress who played the titular character in ""Elvira Madigan"" nearly 40 years ago) is wholly believable both in and out of bed, by turns fetching, troubled, awkward, and sensitive (without ever being maudlin) in a performance that truly exists in a universe of its own, as if telegraphed from an alternate plane where ""real movies"" and ""porn movies"" are not mutually exclusive concepts. Eileen Daly happily lightens the mood in a winning supporting role, and French porn icon Ovidie is memorable in a lesbian liaison with Anna (although her Gothic, fetishistic look and personality would seem to suggest she'd be more at home in a Dario Argento erotic-horror opus than a quiet slice-of-life comedy like ""All About Anna.""

A final influence on ""All About Anna"" appears to be American cult director Monte Hellman, who while having worked under-the-radar in the U.S. for over four decades, has long been heralded as a genius of the ""quiet film"" in both France and Denmark (He even recently renamed his production company Quiet Films, in a warm nod to his Danish fans). As the director of ""Two-Lane Blacktop,"" and executive producer of ""Buffalo 66"" and Quentin Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs,"" Hellman has made a career out of crafting somber, slice-of-life dramas that focus on the individual's Search For Meaning.

Imagine Hellman being given a free hand to shoot his own explicit adult film, with a wry, literate script and more than a few knowing references to ""Elvira Madigan,"" and you've got this precocious film, a movie that beats all the X-rated filmmakers in the world to the punch at creating an ""adult movie"" that's not only also a ""real movie"" but a truly ""good movie"" as well.

""All About Anna"" is a love letter from Denmark, written in English, sent from the heart, a ""Vinland Saga"" for American audiences. - Victor Manzon",1209600000,143,5264,5.133022170361727
2549911,2,B000F2N4FG,"I think, there are (roughly) two kind of movie creators - artists (professionals) and decorators (amateurs).

In the beginning of the work artists have some idea they wish to explore and knowledge on how to introduce it to the people. Decorators have the work ordered and working schedules.

Artists build their work in their minds, they can feel the scent of oils, the structure of canvas, the harmony of light and shadow, but they wait until it is the right moment to start. Decorators prepare their brushes and rollers, open the jars with paint and cover walls with it.

Works of painters sometimes reach the famous museums and personal collections, become the legacy of humanity. Layers of paint, in their turn, are just waiting for the day when they are removed or covered with the new layers.

This is my expression of what All About Anna gave me as a movie. Nothing, in fact, although I anticipated a lot. I was waiting for an artistic movie, something new and bold, but found lack of cast talents, poor director's work (the Producer's Cut is even not that bad as the Director's one), amateur camera work, weak script and storyline. The story has nothing special in itself, a story of a modern girl in the modern world. I think, kinds of ""Annas"" is the audience this movie can be OK with.

The package looked (and still it does) very nice though. Two DVDs in a nice multifolded cardboard case, a booklet, and a supplement bonus DVD (which slightly balanced my overall impression back). So two stars is probably for these advantages only.",1205712000,4,1544,4.703703703703703

N/B: there are numerous sexual scenes in this ovies especially the 3 disc edition which I am refering to. There are three disc for this special edition. one of them is like R version, the other disc is the full unrated edition with one extra longer sexual scenes at almost the end of the DVD and the other disc is more like a disc of different woman doing sex only which are liely to be pimps and prostitutes. The detail of sex is also been shown on movies where this idea could be imported from pornographic videos like private.com, peachtree etc where the sexual content is used to make into films with some form of storyline. This is afterall the basic of how sexual content movies are made on films.

I thought Anna was reasonably attractive, my wife didn't seem to mind the guys, well except for the French guy...  The picture quality was fine.  Acting was better than I expected.  I'd like to see more movies like this (i.e. major motion picture with actual sex during the sex scenes).",1509840000,,354,4.571428571428571
