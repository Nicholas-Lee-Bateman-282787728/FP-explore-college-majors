5055020,5,B0074JOVTQ,"ATTENTION FANS OF ""THE THREE STOOGES""! This is the only review you will need to read. Just like one of the other gentlemen who posted a review, all I ever had was the ""For Your Emmy Consideration"" VHS tape. It only took 12 years for them to put this onto DVD. Hah.

So first off, I think this product is great. The video and audio quality are perfect. The format is Widescreen. The DVD insert is just like any other. As it says on the product page, this is a DVD-R but that does not matter. The disc label is professional enough and does not affect the quality in any way. Don't look for any extras, because there are none. Which is Howard, FINE and Howard.

Along with working in the field of Video Production, I am a Stooge fanatic and collector and I am very pleased with this DVD. There is no reason why anyone should be disappointed.

If you've never seen this movie, it is great. It is not 100% accurate, but I love it.",1334102400,6,925,4.214689265536723
5055021,5,B0074JOVTQ,"I am not a big fan of the Three Stooges, although I enjoyed ""Snow White and the Three Stooges"" years ago, but I viewed this movie on television and was honestly touched by it.  It is an excellent bio of the men, and the actors all did fine jobs giving the characters the life and depth which you do not see in their comedy bits.  I thought it might be cheap or phony, but it was very well done, and it was interesting to learn the ins and outs of the careers and personal lives of the four men (brother Shemp Howard filled in for Curly when he became ill).  Even if you aren't particularly enthralled with the Stooges I think you will like this movie, and if you do like them you will love this movie!",1333843200,3,701,4.102189781021898

It's like I got to know the three stooges all over again. The acting is solid  and the recreations of the shorts was excellent.

5055051,5,B0074JOVTQ,"I watched this many years ago when it was a special on TV. It was a good presentation on the history of the Three Stooges and how they got screwed over again and again in show business. First by Ted Healey and later at Columbia Pictures by Harry Cohn and again when Screen Gems syndicated their shorts for television.

After watching this, it's interesting to see these actors pop up again and again on other TV shows; Evan Handler was on several episodes of The West Wing, Michael Chilis on The Shield, The Commish, Vegas, Fantastic Four. Paul Ben-Victor on In Plain Sight, The Wire and now Allegiance.

Great show to watch",1426550400,2,624,4.5625
5055052,4,B0074JOVTQ,When I first watched this movie April 24 2000 on ABC I was not a big fan of it. I have watched it several other times and really enjoyed it. It has many historical inaccuracies. It should have been made into a mini series. The careers of these men lasted nearly half a century. It is impossible to put that into 2 hours of time. Another thing that I liked was these guys were not being the stooges in the movie into was a docu drama about the stooges. Michael Chiklis stole the show as Curly.,1422230400,,492,4.135416666666667

Was so very glad to find this DVD-R available. No special features,just a bare-bones disc, but that's all that's really needed for this extraordinary biopic, which was far, far better than the recent theatrical film. The actors creating these iconic characters are all extraordinary, especially Michael Chiklis who absolutely channels Curly. The degree of detail in recreating so many of their classic routines is incredible..kudos to director James Frawley Look out for a great many highly emotional scenes that you may not expect, either.

5055064,1,B0074JOVTQ,"If your a Three Stooges fan and do not want to know the real facts of the Three Stooges then this DVD is the perfect film for you.  Its not the actors fault. They portrayed the individual stooges the best way they could.  The film was based upon the factually inaccurate book The Three Stooges an illustration guide.  The quality of this dvd was fair. This dvd was adapted was from the 2000 TV movie which was directed by Mel Gibson. Gibson has proven over and over again that he is an anti-Semite which is ironic because except for Curly Joe Derita, they were all Jewish.  If you want to know and enjoy The Three Stooges watch all 190, shorts and read some factual books on them like Pop Culture Legends, The Three Stooges by Mark and Ellen Scordato sold here on Amazon.",1378166400,3,771,4.370629370629371

5055068,2,B0074JOVTQ,"First off, I don't believe this film was shot in widescreen format and the fact that the DVD was programmed for WS only takes away from the resolution of the picture.
It comes off picture wise at times as a cheap budget disc (it certainly wasn't a cheap purchase).  This wonderful film (fictional at times as it is) deserved a better transfer to DVD.",1368576000,,350,4.46875
5055069,5,B0074JOVTQ,my all time favorite comedy classics and the movie was done very wel!!!! This is a rare find thanks again!!!!!!!,1367107200,,112,4.65
5055070,4,B0074JOVTQ,"My wife and I watched this movie on Netflix recently. I didn't know it existed until she found it and put it on the queue. We were both Stooges fans as kids and grew up watching their syndicated (and unrewarded) shorts on television in the fifties. Along with Monty Python, Hitchhiker's Guide, and Kurt Vonnegut, the Stooges have been part of my vocabulary and humor for 60 years. Sadly, I knew nothing about the men personally until seeing this film.

Obviously, a made-for-television movie will leave out 99% of the facts and details of the lives of men who lived 50-80 years. The reviewers who were upset about omissions from Moe's book are, most likely, regularly disappointed by ""entertainment."" This is not a documentary, although there probably should be one made from the lives of these brilliant and complicated comedians. It's a movie, first, and a biography in distant second. However, the actors vanished into their parts. I am very familiar with Michael Chiklas and Paul Ben-Victor's work and it took me more time than I'd like to admit to identify them. Chiklas was so good that I immediately accepted him as Curly and didn't even bother to try to figure out who he was until late in the movie. Hell, I didn't even know smiling was part of his collection of expressions until I saw The Three Stooges.

If you're a fan of Depression Era comedy (the 1930's version, not the 2007 edition), I suspect you'll enjoy the Three Stooges. The kids nitpicking the time-jumps and factual errors/condensations are more about promoting their own erudition rather than describing this movie.",1366934400,,1590,4.863468634686347
5055071,5,B0074JOVTQ,"This is a good movie, not great or fantastic, but good and wholesome, as well as being an informative movie. There are a few Australian Actors in this movie, and I suppose being an Aussie myself I'm probably bias in my review. However the actors who play Moe, Larry and Curly do an excellent job, and I would have to state here that I am a big Michael Chiklis fan, and love everything he has done to date, but having said that Michael Chiklis does an extremely believable and realistic Curly that makes you love him for his effort in portraying the part of Curly, and therefore you end up loving the movie. I first saw this on TV years ago, and have never forgotten it, and when I saw it available on DVD I jumped into action and bought it. One thing I should mention is that this is one of those DVD's on demand types, as the playing side of the disc is coloured purple, but the print side of the disc is made quite well and has a plastic art print on the top of the DVD. Nothing wrong with the entire package, as it is presented well, and most of all works well on any DVD player. Here is what is written on the back cover:- In 1959, a TV executive tries to persuade Moe Howard (Paul Ben-Victor, TV's ""In Plain Sight"") to reunite with his former onscreen partners to publicize the television premiere of a package of Three Stooges classic comedy shorts. Howard flashes back on his long and remarkable career with Shemp (John Kassir, TV's ""Tales from the Crypt""), Larry (Evan Handler, TV's ""Sex and the City"") and ""Curly"" (Michael Chiklis, TV's ""The Shield""). Success proves to be a bumpy road fraught with bad deals, poor health, rocky relationships and group disharmony. The movie is based on the book ""Amalgamated Morons to American Icons, The Three Stooges"" by Michael Fleming. In this movie you'll see a side to Shemp that I myself haven't seen anywhere else in any other movie, and I'm a pretty huge Three Stooges fan. Anyway I think that if you are a serious fan of The Three Stooges and you don't have this movie in your collection, you'll be happy to view this movie and even view it again later on and perhaps again on other times, if you have the time that is. I've given this movie a 5 star rating because to me it and the packaging has no flaws.",1355097600,4,2259,4.355450236966824
5055072,3,B0074JOVTQ,The film is not bad. However there are several holes in plot development and liberties taken that fictionalize rather than stick with fact. Some of the scenes made cliches of the characters. Events and details surrounding the demise of Curly and Shemp are missing. I thought that Moe being portrayed as a gopher for the studio boss at the beginning was interesting...can anyone confirm this as fact? Joe Besser was left out entirely. I did think that the transition to Joe DeRita was handled well. It did have some good scenes but overall I was not overly impressed. I received a hand written letter from Moe himself in the early 1970's who explained that he was in the process of writing a book about the Stooges which turned out to be pretty good. I wonder if Moe would have liked this film?,1351728000,3,793,4.591549295774648

It took a long time before I could find this movie on DVD, 12 years! The actors do a great job of portraying the Stooges. It is a touching and humourous film. I highly recommend it, especially if you didn't happen to see it when it aired on TV in 2000. It is a must for any Stooges collector! I also highly recommend the ""Ultimate Stooges Collection"" now on sale featuring pretty much all of their endeavors. That too is a good buy.",1343520000,,570,4.1909090909090905

Other then that I think this is a very good movie that I think most of the Three Stooges fans would enjoy watching",1341792000,,347,3.64
5055076,5,B0074JOVTQ,I thoght this movie was great but yet at the same time it was sad to see how The Stooges lives were after their hayday.,1341187200,,119,3.8
5055077,5,B0074JOVTQ,"I enjoyed this film a lot when it originally aired and still enjoy it to this day. They're may be a few historical inaccuracies (namely stuff about Ted Healy and MGM) but Muppet Movie director James Frawley does a wonderful job recreating the atmosphere of the time periods (1920's-50's) and the cast is superb. The stooges are pitch-perfect, the real stand out's being Michael Chiklis (The Sheild, The Thing from Fantastic Four) as Curly and the Cryptkeeper himself, John Kassir as Shemp. Not only do they perfectly embody the comedic personas, but they bring depth to the characters (or the real people I should say) that you wouldn't expect. The film also nails all the proper emotional beats and really makes you feel for the plight of the Stooges (it took a very long time for them to gain the respect they deserved.) I'd say it's definitely a must see for die-hard Stooge fans.

As for the product itself, I was a little apprehensive at the idea of ordering what is essentially a high end DVD-R, but I was pleasantly surprised in the end. I had no problem getting the dvd to read in my semi old player, and I was very impressed with the picture quality. You might thing it looks a tad to smoky at times, but the film always looked like that and the dvd is presented in widescreen, which is a big plus because I don't recall that being the case with it's original broadcast. I do wish it had some supplemental features and it is a little weird that the movie starts right up instead of the menu screen, but overall I am very pleased with the product an will continue to purchase from amazon's made to order catalogue.",1341014400,9,1622,4.517006802721088
5055078,5,B0074JOVTQ,"I had to get it!  Sorry we had to wait 12 years.  I love the Three Stooges and knowing their history was remarkable.

I am truely a Three Stooges fan and if you are too, you have to see the Three Stooges Museum in Springhouse, PA.  ""They have everthing on the Three Stooges"".",1340582400,,414,4.243589743589744

I am a huge Stooges fan, and this movie is  a attribute to them.  I learned a lot and the actors were good. Thank you amazon! Great to add to my collection.",1337731200,6,453,3.6979166666666665
5055080,4,B0074JOVTQ,"First off, IMDB is full of factual errors submitted by various people on this ""The Three Stooges (TV 2000)"" movie, so I will spare repeating most of that here. It is those goofs and my own reading on the subject as to why I feel the creators of this movie showed artistic license. In reading Moe Howard's book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moe-Howard-the-Three-Stooges/dp/0806505540/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moe Howard & the Three Stooges</a>, one can glean facts that aren't in the movie, or were changed by the people in charge of the movie for dramatization. This movie was supposedly inspired by the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Three-Stooges-An-Illustrated-History-From-Amalgamated-Morons-to-American-Icons/dp/0767905563/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Three Stooges: An Illustrated History, From Amalgamated Morons to American Icons</a>. The funny thing is that this movie's plot is the Three Stooges as remembered by Moe, so it goes against nature to choose a book not written by Moe himself. For instance, Ted Healy's death in this movie was fiction compared to Moe Howard's fact of how they really found out about Ted Healy. I also felt that the movie was rushed in parts. It was a sigh of relief at some points to keep the plot going.

However the biggest scene change I realized (After not seeing it for 12 years), was Jerome Howard. I watched the movie in 2000, then got my own copy of Moe Howard's autobiography. I read that and had to explain to my wife all the differences between what actually happened and what was changed in the movie. I found myself talking throughout half the movie instead of watching it. So to see Jerome Howard sitting in a wheelchair after his career ending stroke and then a tombstone, the plot developed a big hole after reading what happened to Curly after the stroke. The movie set Curly up to be this man that was very unlucky with the ladies and makes it seem like Curly died from the effects of that one stroke.

In real life, Jerome recovered from his first stroke and had a cameo with his two brothers in the short, ""Hold That Lion"" with his trademark bowler hat. He finally found a woman who treated him well, married her, and they had a daughter together. I'm paraphrasing here, but Curly mentioned that he finally had a purpose in life as a father. It wasn't long after he suffered a second crippling stroke which finally killed him. One book on The Three Stooges speculate that all the blows to the head to both Curly and Larry by Moe is what attributed to them both having strokes.

Anyway, despite the glaring fact that the men portraying the stooges don't look or sound like them at all (Unlike the Farrelly Brothers' stooges in the 2012 tribute movie), it is a nice dramatization that hasn't been attempted on the stooges that I know of. Granted, it certainly isn't a very factual movie, going against what the man himself Moe Howard recollected, but it is something for the non book readers to get a small glimpse at what life could have been like for the legendary Three Stooges family. At least it shows Larry Fine as a separate family, and not a cousin as some are misled to believe.",1336262400,28,3247,5.088180112570356

5055082,5,B0074JOVTQ,"As a young boy growing up I loved the 3 stooges. Later on in my twenties I still felt a warmth seeing them once in a while. Never knew what they went through,getting ripped off by the studios,the hard ships they went through. After seeing this movie,I now really enjoy seeing them again. Well acted great script,watched it 2 times over the years and ready for a 3rd time. Again if you liked the stooges over the years this is a must see movie",1334275200,4,442,4.273809523809524
8510146,5,B0074JOVTQ,"This is a must, for any fan of The Three Stooges. The ending brought me to tears.. In a good way. No one could ever possibly recreate the acting, ""magic"" of the Stooges, and one reason I really like this movie, is that they didn't try to do that very much. The Ebbbies, and Nyuck Nynucks, could only be pulled off by Shemp, and Curly. Don't hesitate buy this. You soitenty won't be disappointed.",1529625600,,395,4.351351351351352
