8513669,4,B007AX86YW,"The Scramble match (Divine Storm (Chris Divine & Quiet Storm) vs. Special K (Izzy & Dixie) vs. The SAT (Jose & Joel Maximo) vs. Homicide) was overbooked in spots but otherwise impressive and innovative. The  Homicide & Steve Corino-The Backseat Boyz tag team match was a good solid bout until the very end. The 6 person tag team between The Christopher Street Connection & Allison Danger (w/ Japanese Pool Boy) against Joey Matthews, Christian York, and Alexis Laree was so-so at best. The Tony Mamaluke-James Maritato match was not bad at all. The Ikuto Hidaka-Amazing Red match was very good but could have gone alot longer. The ETV TV title match between Don Juan & Fast Eddie was also very good. The Texas Death match between Rudy Boy Gonzales & Steve Corino was a hardcore,smash-mouth brawl and a good reminder of Steve's days in ECW. The Fight without Honor between Samoa Joe & Low-Li was a hard-hitting MMA style bout and i mean that in a good way. The Non-Title match between Jay Briscoe & Xavier was mediocre at best. The Falls Count Anywhere tag team match between The Carnage Crew (HC Loc & DeVito) & Da Hit Squad (Mafia & Monster Mack) was also a hardcore smash-mouth brawl. 3-Way Dance for the Showstopper Name (Spanky vs. Michael Shane vs. Paul London) was very awesome. The Chirstopher Daniels-Doug Williams match was also good but also needed more time too. I give this event a 7 out of 10.",1413417600,,1406,4.669354838709677
