2511795,4,B000EAT232,"First of all, CHRIS FISHER's DIRTY is influenced by  FUQUA's TRAINING DAY and that's a given fact. The whole mood is similar, and so are the shaking camera, the abuse of jump cuts and the modern Gangsta aspect. Other than that There's just Two more LAPD officers dealing with the ruthless streets of a town ruled by gangs... By the way it was also the subject of the legendary DENNIS HOPPER's COLORS years ago. None the less it would be unfair to see DIRTY as a TRAINING's rip-off. You see, TRAINING is about corruption (a crooked cop trying to manipulate an honest rookie) when DIRTY is mainly about loyalty, guilt and ultimately redemption.

In spite of the MTV video look that I usually dislike, I enjoyed that flick and will remember it forever. On top of the great talents involved (everybody is on point), it's honest about what it portrays. That whole world is dirty and they show it without watering it down. It's all about guns, drugs and money but as wicked as they are, people still got soul and may be like SANCHO says "" you see things more clearly when you're dead "".",1178150400,,1080,4.505102040816326
2511796,4,B000EAT232,"This talented and young director has made a well rounded and systematic movie around the huge labyrinths nestled underneath. Only the strong will survive and will remain undamaged in this jungle of white neck sinister game.

Two cops are the fundamental axis, the basis of a pyramid carefully built and rigorously articulated. A nasty officer who works out the embodiment of the perversion has a plan, and these cops will be from now his arms to follow the instructions. As you may guess all  theory is engaging; they will be eventually well rewarded; this interesting puzzle of encountered interests will reach as you may expected a hazardous boiling point, where nobody will be sure about nothing. The violence is part of the drama, and is plainly justified; the shot angles, as well as the increasing tension make of this a singular movie to watch. A superb script that shows us the rottenness that lives, breaths and beats with absolute impunity beneath contaminated police dossiers. Unerring performances; Cuba Gooding is absolutely amazing as well as the rest of the cast. There is no hole along the way.

The redemption is never enough. Don't miss it under any excuse.",1154736000,4,1175,4.9543147208121825
2511797,3,B000EAT232,"DIRTY seems to be confused as to what it is.  The viewer is lead to believe that the LAPD has an undercover anti-gang force made op of ex-gangbangers who know the streets and therefore know how to break the codes that allow gang crimes of drugs and violence to continue unfettered by arrests.  Yes, we are all aware of the Rampart scandal that perhaps is the nidus for this story, but what DIRTY  shows is a group of despicable, foul mouthed, evil, crime perpetrating opportunists who will do anything to make a hit - all 'protected' by a police force that condones their actions.

Cuba Gooding, Jr. is a fine actor whose recent roles have not allowed him to demonstrate his craft.  Perhaps he wanted a role as a bad guy (in the vein of Denzel Washington, Richard Gere et al who opt for smarmy roles to 'prove' their acting grit!), but he is artificial in this film as a man willing and waiting to do filthy deeds without conscience.  He is paired with the also fine actor Clifton Collins, Jr. as the Hispanic equivalent of Gooding's Black bad cop.  The story jumps all over the place with so many subplots and characters identifiable only by their total body tattoo differences and hampered by a script that depends on the F word and the N word and M**F** word as a means of communication.

Gooding and Collins are partners and while Gooding seems to be the major offender to decency, Collins does little about it, leading us to believe he is an innocent victim to the Internal Affairs investigation that appears to be the endpoint of this drama.  Just when the viewer is saturated by the dirt of this film's techniques and story, the gritty collision of loyalty and redemption enters at the very end, making reflection on the tale that has been assaulting our senses almost embarrassing for the viewer.  In the police code, what is permissible, what is wrong, what is justifiable?  Fighting crime with crime doesn't seem a viable answer, but we are left asking the question 'What is?'  A disturbing film on many levels, not the least of which is the fact that Gooding's agent needs a heads up on finding this gifted actor some worthy roles!

2511798,1,B000EAT232,"As the previous review stated, Cuba attempts to compete with ""Training Day"" and fails horribly.  The plot is lacking, there is poor character development and excessive profanity.  I would have given this movie less stars if it were possible. Save your money.",1149984000,6,258,5.119047619047619
2511799,4,B000EAT232,"There are ample amount of actions in this movie which I bought from Singapore videoshops....hee hee but the story is basically about cops performing gang type of bad jobs instead of upkeeping the law in a country. This DVD film/movie is recommended to those whom are interested in this genre of film/movie.

2511800,2,B000EAT232,"This movie had a lot of opportunity, if done well, which it was not.

This wasn't possible the worse idea for a cop movie, if it was handle well it could had been a eye-opener to what cops can get away with. But it was poorly down, like in scenes where Cuba feels up a young girl. It should be a very serious and disturbing look at what his character does but it just looked like a joke done very stupidly.

Cuba Gooding Jr is a truly brilliant actor, why would he play this character. I mean if their was good dialogue, and he didn't play the role so over the top street but more serious, evil, bad and not stupid he could have been a great character. The movie it self had a lot of  downs near the end I thought maybe something but it just got worse.

We can only cross are fingers and hope Cuba career and choice in movies stop declining, For example he is a much better actor than Vin Diesel but who's movies are bigger.",1149465600,5,924,4.088397790055248
2511801,1,B000EAT232,"The strange and baffling career of Cuba Gooding takes another dive in this attempt to mirror the success of Denzel's TRAINING DAY.  Unfortunately, Cuba's not Denzel and this movie is way below the quality of DAY.  Filled with enough foul language to fill the Pacific Ocean, the movie attempts to be artsy but is merely another bad cop movie, filled with bad cops---where's the good ones?  Clifton Collins Jr., so good in CAPOTE, is wasted in the role of the apparently honest partner of Cuba who is going to testify in Internal Affairs regarding the killing of an innocent bystander during a drug bust.  All though this Cuba swaggers like a rap star and Collins has to try and act tough with him.  There's an unusual twist in the end and a very long russian roulette sequence that do nothing to redeem this disappointing film.",1148342400,8,826,4.6689655172413795
2511802,1,B000EAT232,"The camera work is nauseating; it has those amateur jerky, close-up facial, then rapid far-away zooming and back to close-up motions popular with kids today.  The technical advisors (if any) had no say in maintaining an aura of reality.  What cop leaves home dressed in full uniform? When have you seen a cop in uniform with a goatee?  When does a Police Captain bow down to a Lieutenant? When does an accused officer get interrogated by Internal Affairs without an attorney? Did they really think a guy with gang tattoos and a supposedly actual gang member would make it on the force, much less on a Gang detail?  When have you seen Crip gang members have fun on skateboards or Hells Angels bikers without bikes (who actually look like yuppies) hang out with a cholo who by mere coincidence is in the same gang as the cop who busts him? I was so disgusted with such unreality that I didn't even finish watching the movie.  Plus, instead of being original, they borrowed incidents from LAPD's Rampart scandal - gang unit member gets narcotics from Property by checking it out and sells it.  This is a waste of talent at best.  By all means rent it - see what I mean.",1146268800,11,1166,4.523809523809524
2511803,4,B000EAT232,"Do not be fooled by the description that Amazon gives you. This is not a re-hashing of a Training Day type story. Although it might seem like so in the beginning, the movie leads you down one street, and then takes a VERY sharp turn at the end.

Clifton Collins does a very good job in his first(I think) starring role. If you have seen him in 187, then you should already know that he is a solid young actor. Cuba Gooding does excellent as usual, although his character is quite the disturbing individual. Some of his actions will make you sick if you are used to seeing him as the ""good natured, black guy"" he usually portrays. Also, rising star Khleo Thomas has a surprising Adult role in here. Do not let your kids see this movie based on that fact that he is in the movie. This is a graphic and sometimes downright nasty movie. But it is good. All around great acting, good story, and, as I said, just when you think you know everything, SLAP!!!!!! Guess again. Very good, relatively unknown movie.

It's not bad but too many similarites  of the other movie the 2 cops one badish one with a brain, and so on and so on and so on. It was ok not bad but since I was always thinking about Training day I didn't get to get into it as much. Its a time paster.",1296172800,3,308,3.5970149253731343
2512026,3,B000EAT232,"This dude is basically the Canadian version of John Cassavetes. He's quite competent with what he does. The only problem with that is that there's a John Cassavetes already, just south of that border, who is MUCH BETTER than competent. I mean, this is no Love Streams, but there's much much MUCH stupider, vapider, and worse out there. The cast of characters is interesting and more relatable hold onto your heart better than in Live Bait, but many of them aren't fleshed out enough (only the characters Angie and Tony I feel are very ""full"", and while there's something quite striking about Nancy's character portrait, it's also a bit flat, conventional, and without much to it). The shooting is vaguely better, and the use of underexposure and dark atmospheres really lent well to the aimless characters tumbling through their emotional lives with the lights burnt out. The title is also fairly misleading as it only has one character whose problems are very ""dirty"" in any way, and I feel that the film would be better if his aspects were downplayed a bit more; while his fetishism never rose to sensationalist/shock-value levels, he was also a squirmingly awkward character and not in a ""revealing"" way, just in an awkward way.",1294272000,,1231,4.894736842105263
2512027,3,B000EAT232,"Based loosely upon a blend of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Training-Day/dp/B00005JKED/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Training Day</a>&nbsp;and the LAPD's Rampart scandal, two former gangbangers turned police officers - Armando Sancho (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Salim Adel (Cuba Gooding Jr.) - are embroiled in an Internal Affairs investigation over a civilian shooting.  They must patrol the underworld, sifting through various crimes and competing gangs (primarily Mexican) amidst the drug and turf wars of LA for one last day, sweating the impending IA appointment, the memories of the accidental death, and their varying loyalties to former friends and gang members.

Violence and vulgarity abound, as Cuba does a watered down Denzel impersonation - snarled lip, incessant F-bombs, N-word in every other sentence - while Collins does his best to portray the troubled conscience in a good cop, bad cop relationship.  The only problem is, there needs to be a good cop for this to work, which it doesn't, since Sancho is complicit in the evil unleashed by Adel.  The performances were fine, but never really pulled me in.  Sorry, but Cuba Gooding Jr. is a good guy, and there is nothing his smiling, cherubic face can do about it.  Somewhere in there the script finds time to squeeze Cole Hauser in as a generic evil lieutenant; so generic in fact, that he doesn't even have a name.  Just ""Lieutenant.""  Appropriately, Hauser mails it in like he's late for another third most important character acting gig (i.e. the norm).

Plenty of gun-play...if that's your thing.  There's even a semblance of build-up and character development.  Sure, Adel is nasty, and, yes, the police abuse is there, but it just doesn't work.  Perhaps it was the shoddy and distracting camera work, the weakest Hell's Angels in film history (worse than the bikers in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pee-Wee-s-Big-Adventure/dp/B001CK1D44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pee-Wee's Big Adventure</a>), and the predictability that dissuades?

It's just too much of a Training Day rip-off for my tastes (including the demise of the Denzel doppelganger).  Just about the only things missing are the King Kong line and an Eva Mendes nude scene.  I suppose it's fitting the two leads are both juniors, because they can't fill the shoes of their older brothers (i.e. Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke).  The movie is decent at best, and probably better if Training Day hasn't been seen.

2512028,4,B000EAT232,"Listen alot of the review of this movie discredit it for reasons i see unfit it has a solid original plot the right balance of violence and disapointment to portray the ""Real World"" it is fiction and i recognize that fact but the movie doesnt dress up the dark minds and actions of men it throws them out there unaltered to let you decide. I think its a solid movie worth adding to any action collection.",1243468800,,404,4.328947368421052

8107967,3,B000EAT232,It wasn't to bad. The movie only showing the viewer what is really going on across the states. How the police are corrupt and how that there are bad cops out there. Now don't take me wrong when I say bad officers there are plenty good police officers out there as well doing a outstanding job. it's just sometimes the bad cops try and make things hard for the good cops out there. But to be honest just knowing there are bad cops out there really kind of scared to travel with my wife and kids around the states especially traveling and it starts to get dark and I might end up making a stop in a small town looking for a for myself and my family to rest for the night. An it turns out no one wants to help us. I'm African American and Veteran of the US Army. It's just been bothering me every since I have been pulled over driving from Utah to Oakley Idaho as soon as I reached Idaho like 30 45 minutes in on a lone High way with my family Blue lights was behind me and the officer was rude and saying bad things until his partner arrived an asked for him to relax and just leave us alone and that I look like a good man just on a vacation with my family. That's why I say there are good cops out there as well. Who knows what could have happened if his partner didn't show up.,1524268800,,1278,3.99609375
