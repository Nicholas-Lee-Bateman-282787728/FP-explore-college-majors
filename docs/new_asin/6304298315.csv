847131,5,6304298315,"Tom Ripley played by... Alain Delon?! How the tall, spoiled, and chiseled leading man with the perfect hair be casted as the devious underdog is uncertain, but it worked... to perfection. Delon is born to play Ripley the same way Sean Connery is born to drink martini. Everything in this film worked, not the least it has us rooting for the sinister. The pacing is excellent: Clement often pauses for the audience to contemplate the crime before Delon swiftly introduces the cover-up. All the while building up tension against the sunny backdrop of the Mediterranean.
I saw Purple Noon before Minghella's 1999 fiasco. I am the only one in my circle of friends who didn't like ""The Talendted Mr. Ripley."" Sorry Matt Damon, but you should've phoned Delon for some acting tips.",997142400,8,774,4.871212121212121
847132,3,6304298315,"Purple Noon (Rene Clement, 1960)

First, a warning: do not watch this film before watching the more recent version of The Talented Mr. Ripley, if you plan to see both. The greatest fun of this film is comparing the two versions.

By now we should all know the story. Tom Ripley (Alain Delon) has been sent to Italy by the father of one Phillippe Greenleaf (the late Maurice Ronet) with the objective of bringing Greenleaf back into the family fold in the United States. Ripley, an accomplished forger, takes his job half-seriously until he falls in love with the same woman Greenleaf is in love with, Marge (Marie Laforet), and then, as in most films, complications ensue.

This film is a perfect complement to Minghella's 1999 failure. Minghella's film, aside from a few key scenes, is completely lacking in atmosphere; Clement's film has it in spades. Clement's film compresses all of the book's setup into two conversations at the very beginning, and dispenses with a major subplot altogether; Minghella's film takes us step-by-step through the whole thing. Too bad the two didn't get together to film this, as they might have managed a film worthy of Highsmith's classic novel.

It's interesting (perhaps the most interesting thing in the film) to note the differences between the characterizations of Phillippe (Clement)/Dickie (Minghella) Greenleaf in the two movies. Minghella's version, played by Jude Law, is something of a spoiled
libertine, but he never really comes across as menacing, thus making the major plot points of the film black and white. Clement's Greenleaf, on the other hand, is a nasty piece of work. We never actually see it, but we get the distinct feeling he's both verbally and physically abusive to Marge; he's excessively confrontational even with his best friends. There's much more a sense that Greenleaf is as much the architect of the last two-thirds of the film as Ripley is here. Maybe that, too, is something that Minghella's film is fatally lacking.

If you've seen the newer version of Ripley, this could safely be a three-and-a-half star film for comparison value alone. If not, I'm forced to go with ** 1/2.",980294400,14,2150,4.977715877437326

The cinematography is mesmerizing and the soundtrack by Nino Rota adds a lot to the entire sinister atmosphere and suspense. Even Hitchcock could not have done this better.

If you only have seen Minghella's ""Talented Mr. Ripley"" so far, do yourself a big favor and also watch this French original version. You might end up having found another favorite movie...
No matter how often I've watched this on German TV over the past 4 decades, it kept me sitting on the edge of my seat.
The ending is different compared with the Minghella remake, but I won't give it away. You just have to watch it for yourself!
Definitely a master piece. If there would be more than 5 stars, I would have rated it higher.

My tip: read Patricia Highsmith's first 4 Tom Ripley novels (I cannot recommend reading volume 5  ""Ripley Under Water"" as it's very weak compared with the first 4 Ripley volumes) and then watch the many Ripley movies that are out there by Ren Clment, Wim Wenders, Anthony Minghella and others:

847428,5,6304298315,"Identity theft has never worn a more handsome masque than that of Alain Delon in ""Purple Noon"", the first film adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", directed by the French filmmaker Rene Clement in 1960.
""Purple Noon"" is a suspense thriller that makes devastating use of time, place and color to create character and propel narrative. The screen virtually simmers in the noon day heat of the maritime sequences which make up a considerable middle portion of the film. Hitchcock's ""To Catch a Thief"" (1955) comes immediately to my mind as a complementary work, with Grace Kelly and Monte Carlo in ""Thief"" finding Alain Delon and Mongibello as their visual correlatives in ""Noon"". The French film uses mirror images, real and symbolic, to create a world in which unpleasant rich people enjoy a hedonistic existence to which a poor poseur can only aspire until he kills to get it and to keep it.
We, as viewers, become morally complicit in the murders since we intensely dislike the two victims, wastrels and spoiled brats who use those whom they regard as lesser beings as the objects of their scorn and sadistic jokes.
Tom Ripley, the Delon character, is a con artist, a thief and a forger; Philippe Greenleaf (Maurice Ronet) is equally duplicitous, fooling a rich woman into believing he's a blind man. Both men are interested, to some degree, in Marge (Marie Laforet), a would be Fra Angelico biographer who finds her work thrown into the sea by her supposed lover, Philippe. She had earlier shown some of the human kindness rarely exhibited by the characters in this film, caring for the badly sunburnt Tom, who had been set adrift, shirtless, in Philippe's dinghy.
Philippe's treatment of his supposed friends calls to mind the Tennessee Williams dictum that the only unforgiveable sin is conscious cruelty. When Tom strikes back at Philippe and Freddy Miles, his fellow expatriate and condescending boor, we root for Tom's success.
Any threat of an erotic triangle in the offing is frustrated by money: while Tom at times seems interested in both Philippe and Marge, he doesn't really want Philippe. He wants to be Philippe. Tom wears Philippe's clothes perfectly. He imitates his voice perfectly, he signs his name and extracts money from his accounts with confidence and skill. Delon makes the perfect doppelganger, the ultimate homme fatal.
""Purple Noon"" was Delon's sixth film, made the same year as ""Rocco and His Brothers"", Visconti's socialist epic. Delon would find suitable roles in ""The Leopard"" (1963) and especially the gangster chic films ""Le Samourai"" (1967),""Le Cercle Rouge"" and ""Borsalino"" both released in 1970. Perhaps his finest performance came in ""Mr. Klein""(1976), the Holocaust themed film in which his character's impersonation leads to deadly and tragic results. Here he suggests a Gallic mlange of Robert Redford at the time of ""The Downhill Racer"" (1969) and Brad Pitt in ""Thelma and Louise"" (1991); all three of them young cinematic gods at the height of their beauty.
Appreciation is owed to Henri Decae for his stunning cinematography, dazzlingly rendered on this Blu-ray and to Nino Rota, aural prince of classic Italian films, for his flavorsome score which ranges from a tarantella to jazz inflected portions.
Criterion has produced a Blu-ray edition which is typical of the gold standard set by this company. Interviews with scholars and filmmakers, and with the author herself, who objected to the film's ending, are included, as well as an extended essay analyzing the various film components.
One final note: since ""Purple Noon"" uses French actors in the three primary roles,, two of whom are supposed to be American friends (or not),there is a certain distance  between the actors and an American audience.(I know that the same may be said of some Americans and any film bearing subtitles, as decades of film teaching has taught me). The more expansive version of the Highsmith source material was directed by the Briton Anthony Minghella in 1999 and starred Americans Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow and Philip Seymour Hoffman and the Briton Jude Law. The two films make for a fascinating comparison between Franco/Italian sensibilities and those of Americans and Britons on the subjects of class and sexuality.",1404950400,4,4275,5.107142857142857

I don't have a Blu-ray player, so my review is based on the new DVD release. While the overall quality is better, there are a few scenes where I didn't see that much of a difference between the old and new DVDs. The best restored scenes, in my opinion, are those taking place in the ocean and on the boat. Here, the pictures are crisp and the photography is beautiful. In other indoor scenes (i.e., the hotel, interrogation with the policeman), this 1960s film still looks a little faded. I've seen better restorations by Criterion, and I'm a little disappointed that it's not that much of a jump in quality. Maybe a better negative wasn't available.

847520,4,6304298315,"The problem with some of these older movies based off of controversial novels is that the censors or straight up fear of public response limited what was able to be shown or discussed and because of that, some of these truly amazing works of literature were butchered and seriously altered for the big screen.

Purple Noon, which is adapted from Patricia Highsmiths brilliant novel The Talented Mr. Ripley, is a perfect example of this.

For anyone who has either read Highsmiths novel or who has seen Minghellas brilliant 1999 film adaptation, the alterations made to Rene Clements 1961 film version will be obvious.  From Ripleys sexuality to his relationship to Dickey (here known as Phillipe) and Marge to the finale, Purple Noon is really its own film entirely and bares very little resemblance (other than time, place and character names) to the source material, which is sad.  Delon, Ronet and Laforet are marvelous actors and Clements direction is sharp and languid, and this really delivers a serious punch and serves as a great film, but it wasn't what I wanted it to be.

Ive had this issue so many times, when the film adaptation just doesnt live up to expectations set by the book.  Hitchcocks own Strangers on a Train suffers from being so different from the book (also penned by Highsmith), and Ive written many awful things about what was done to Bret Easton Elliss Less Than Zero.  I have no qualms with a film taking liberties, but don't misrepresent or alter the actual core themes!  For me, Clements film presents Ripley as a completely different character than the one that Highsmith created.  Delons Ripley is far too confident and in control of his game, and while Ripley is certainly a master deceiver, there is a reckless anxiety that Delon never taps into.  The relationship forged between Phillipe and Ripley also suffers here from the decision to start the film well into their time together.  By sidestepping Ripleys initial meeting with Phillipe and the formation of their friendship, we lose the urgency of the actual boat scene.

It all just feels incomplete.

But, set apart from the original story, Purple Noon is a very good film, and while I wholly object to the finale on principle, the ending is a nail biter and it did work in the context of THIS story.

If you are expecting The Talented Mr. Ripley, you are going to be upset.  This is a different animal, but it is a well-made animal and one that works on its own.",1392940800,2,2455,4.7435294117647056

847723,4,6304298315,"Author Patricia Highsmith would take the world by storm with her 19555 psychological thriller novel ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"".  A winner of the ""Grand Prix de Litterature Policiere"" in 1957 for ""Best International Crime Novel"", many may be familiar with the 1995 film adaptation directed by Anthony Minghella and starring Matt Damon and Jude Law.

But before the 1995 film adaptation, there was the 1960 French film directed by Rene Clement (""Forbidden Games"", ""Joy House"", ""Gervaise"") and an adaptation co-written by Paul Gegauff.

The film would star Alain Delon (""L'eclisse"", ""Le Samourai"", ""Le cercle rouge""), Maurice Ronet (""Elevator to the Gallows"", ""The Fire Within"", ""Beau Pere""), Marie Laforet (""Tangos, The Exile of Gardel"", ""Joyeuses Paques"", ""Blue Panther"") and Frank Latimore (""Patton"", ""The Razor's Edge"", ""All the President's Men"").

Since it's release in 1960, the film is considered a cult classic and back in 1962, both Rene Clement and Paul Gegauff would win an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for""Best Foreign Film Screenplay"".

While critics have debated on which film was the better adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's popular novel, the classic 1960 film has now been released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of The Criterion Collection.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Purple Noon"" is presented in 1:66:1, color and in French monaural.  It's important to note that if you want the best picture and audio quality for ""Purple Noon"", definitely go for the Blu-ray release of ""Purple Noon - The Criterion Collection #637.

For the most part, the film looks very good and it looks that the Criterion Collection was able to remove any dirt, white specks or any scratches from the film.  The film seems to retain its warm colors and over 50-years since the film's release, there is no major sign of aging or blurriness.  The DVD looks very good and I'm sure the Blu-ray release would look even better!

The cinematography courtesy of Henri Decae (""The 400 Blows"", ""Elevator to teh Gallows"", ""Le Samourai"") is wonderful!

According to the Criterion Collection, this new digital transfer was created in 2K resolution on an ARRISCAN film scanner from the original camera negative; two original 35 mm prints and an LTC, Paris, were used for color reference.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS and Pixel Farm's PFClean, while Image Systems' Phoenix was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.

As for the audio,the monaural soundtrack is good.  No signs of pops or clicks or even hiss for this 50-year-old film.  Dialogue is clear as with the music by Nina Rota!

According to the Criterion Collection, the original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from a 35 mm optical soundtrack print.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD. Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Purple Noon"" was a film that took people by surprise when it was released in theaters back in 1960.  A murder/suspense film that had a feel of horror as one watched another man kill a person for his identity and slowly tried to assume his lifestyle.  And it was a film that showed a criminal that was not from some seedy underground, nor was he a criminal that committed a crime for drugs, nor was he a man that looked liked a terrible criminal.

Tom Ripley was a man that was intelligent just not wealthy like his friend Philippe, nor did he have the girlfriend like Marge.  He was suave, calculating and underneath the charisma, was diabolical killer.

And for this killer, we see how he would do anything to try to accumulate his friends wealth and will do all he can to take it.  Surprisingly, there was some who sympathized with Tom Ripley, may not agree with him becoming a killer but it's because his wealthy friend Philippe was not exactly a nice guy either.  Spoiled rich man who got everything he wanted and thinks he can treat anyone, anyway he wanted to.  And for the spoiled individual, that means even torturing his friend Tom.

While many of us find films such as the ""Sherlock Holmes"" films fascinating when we find out how a murder or crime was committed and how Holmes was able to figure  the mystery out, ""Purple Noon"" is a film that shows us how clever and intelligent Tom Ripley is in achieving the near-perfect crime.

While I'm not going to debate of which film is better...""Purple Noon"" or ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", personally I feel the two are different films.  Both are based on Patricia Highsmith's popular novel but the 1999 film changes things a bit and makes Ripley much more cunning than the version seen in ""Purple Noon"".  Also, while ""Purple Noon"" featured a man who was obsessed with his friend's luxurious life, ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" suggests homosexual feelings by Ripley that adds to the obsession towards the man.  But both are well-done crime thrillers, just different in execution and is subjective to the viewer.

As for the DVD, while the picture quality is good (thanks to the wonderful cinematography by Henri Decae) and dialogue is clean, those who are quite picky with picture and audio quality will no doubt want to go for the Blu-ray release of ""Purple Noon"".  Otherwise, ""Purple Noon"" is still a better looking DVD than the older DVD release of the film as The Criterion Collection really cleaned this film up.  It really does look great for a film that is over 50-years old!

Overall, ""Purple Noon"" is a wonderful film from filmmaker Rene Clement and also one of the better films that Alain Delon has starred in.  If you are looking for an intelligent and riveting crime film, ""Purple Noon - The Criterion Collection #637 is recommended!",1355788800,3,6618,4.989963503649635

Purple Noon is gorgeous, affecting and- with Criterion at the helm of this release- will no doubt receive a rich transfer.

Here's hoping it kicks into gear a nice companion blu-ray release of the 1999 version and also perhaps Wim Wender's slow but oddly engrossing ""The American Friend"" with Dennis Hopper which was later remade into ""Ripley's Game"" which was later (hopefully) disowned by all the talented people involved with it.

That version was to star Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman.

However, in PURPLE NOON, the cagey Tom Ripley , who is played by Alain Delon , is sent to Europe by a Mr. Greenleaf to fetch back his spoiled, playboy son, Philippe, played by Maurice Ronet (known as Dickie in the novel and the Minghella version, and why did they ever change it here?).  Tom is to receive $5,000 for this pleasant chore. Philippe toys with Tom, pretending he will go back; nevertheless, he has no intentions of honoring his father's wishes or of leaving his bride to be, Marge, played by Marie Laforet, a Stockard Channing look-alike. As time passes, Mr. Greenleaf comes to consider the mission a failure and cuts Tom off.  Tom then kills Philippe, and co-opts his enviable life. However, Ripley's complicated impersonation begins to entrap him, and suspense builds.  He will need all his abilities as a conman to keep Philippe's friends and the police off his much too hot trail.

THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY is first in a five-book Ripley series penned by Highsmith, known to its fans as the Ripleyiad.  This is a sexy, and gorgeous looking film adaptation, but it veers off in some odd directions, perhaps motivated by the more puritan American market at the time. Oddest, to me, is the omission of the strong homoerotic currents between Ripley and Greenleaf that haunt both the underlying book and the later film.  Ripley, instead, is here made much more heterosexual than his creator envisioned him.  Other odd plot changes from Highsmith's underlying book would make it much more difficult to film the later books of the Ripleyiad.  Nevertheless, the movie is worth a viewing on its own terms: it is tight and suspenseful, set in beautiful Italian scenery, and stars two beautiful men, each of whom we get to see in great eyefuls.",1287964800,3,3734,6.866807610993657

847900,5,6304298315,"Plein Soleil is a taut thriller with good plot and pacing but less character development. We see the idle rich in an Italy of the late 50s. The surfaces of the film,Mediterranean blue seas,gorgeous clothes and apartments, the sunny streets of Naples and Rome,boat-trips to Sicily are captured by the cinematography of Decae. Tom Ripley (Alain Delon) is seen first in streets of La Dolce Vita carousing with Philippe Greenleaf(Maurice Ronet),picking up women. Ripley has to persuade Greenleaf to return to San Fransisco on a commission from Greenleaf Snr.,to get him away from the decadent lifestyle he's given himself up to. Greenleaf thinks he'll go back with Ripley,but then deciding not to, tags him along and Ripley gets caught up in the ripples of hedonism in his target's slipstream. Clement's film is deceptive: outward beauty,inner corruption. Ripley is a cold psychopath whose charm allows him to worm his way in;we are repelled and seduced by his narcissistic cleverness. He is secretly drawn to Marge(La Foret),aims to seduce her. She is Greenleaf's mistress and is aware Philippe is being led astray by Ripley and competes with Ripley forPhilippe's attention. The couple split and he drops her off the boat ; Philippe and Ripley pursue their macho mind games on board. Ripley is open about wanting to kill Philippe and take his wealth and life-style. Philippe thinks he's joking. In a scene of breath-taking brutality Ripley stabs him through the heart and the scenes of wrapping up the body in canvas and rope is shot by hand-held cameras in real time. He proceeds to forge documents,passports,use Philippe's typewriter to forge letters/signatures by Dickie. His plans have to be matched by his impulses and he has to play both Philippe and Ripley at the same or different times. Of course in the book Philippe is called Dickie.

We are drawn in by the tension he creates and the disasters he skirts. He also has to bump off Freddie,one of Philippe's old friends,who loathes his parasitism on Philippe. The scene where Delon carries Freddie's body down the stairs at night takes place in real time and all the weight of bearing a dead body is registered by Delon's exhaustion. He is pursued by the police. He manufactures a suicide letter and lots of cash from Philippe's supposed will bequeathing it to Marge,which the police find. He completes his seduction of Marge and we will him to escape. The ending departs from the novel due to the difficulty in having an amoral killer with no remorse in the 1960s. Rota(of La Dolce Vita)does a sunny film score,the cinematography is excellent and Delon's role made him famous as the glamorous,ultra-cool villain. I preferred this version to Minghella's later version where the homo-erotic overtones are emphasised but the film goes on too long and loses the drive of the story in character development and the pursuing of too many subplots,coincidences and extra characters. Highsmith liked this version and compared to the later one it is the real Italy. This film made Delon famous,however his physical beauty makes his personality impenetrable to dramatise Ripley's role-playing,like a mannequin upon which is transferred thefortune of his victim. He is a virtual blank slate, a murderous empty vessel that trades poverty and social ostracism for wealth and access to the upper class. While none of those traits are absent in Highsmith's characterisation, they remain, for the most part, subordinate to Ripley's consistently deliberated machinations. He is only here a social upstart,not a purveyor of a set of social principles that possess purpose in his universe. If you are prepared to forgive the ending,remember there's no moral compass in the Highsmith's worldview,there is no guilt or remorse, just manipulations ofcircumstance to one's own advantage,albeit with a little homicide thrown in.",1277164800,2,3859,5.1449044585987265

The story is somewhat changed from the later film (I have not read the book) but like the later film this is riveting entertainment. Fast-paced and well directed, this moves along at great pace and you are continually torn between liking Ripley for his cleverness and wanting him to be caught.

I really only have two criticisms of the film. Firstly as a previous reviewer said at the end there is a big shock, which results in an ending to the film that I didn't like. Again as the previous reviewer said I can't elaborate on this without spoiling the film. Secondly I prefer John Malkovich as Ripley. See his performance in Ripleys Game.

What I want to add is that this film could serve as a wonderful introduction to Alain Delon for a new generation.  If you have never seen this actor at work, treat yourself to ""Purple Noon"" and think of it as a primer.  It is much better than "".....Mr. Ripley"", as it doesn't have the unrelenting, distasteful sense of evil and unpleasantness of Matt Damon's version.  Damon simply cannot match Delon for all the facets the Frenchman gives his character. Delon makes the character so intriguing, you rather want to see him get away with it!
Delon was and remains one of the most exciting, beautiful actors ever to come out of Europe.  The U.S. has never produced an actor to match him for sheer beauty, grace and charisma.  Those eyes make you want to know what is going on behind them.  The intrigue is always there and you cannot take your eyes off him.
Delon has a son who works very hard to follow in his father's playboy footsteps, but he lacks the class, pure beauty and grace of his father.  I hope that once you've seen ""Purple Noon"", you will move on to his even better films, i.e. ""Mr. Klein"" or ""Le Samourai"" and others.  Not many are available as yet, but hopefully time will correct this oversight.
One film called ""Have I the Right to Kill?"" was recently run on TCM, but is not available as yet in any format.  It also is dubbed, rather than sub-titled, which for me, lessens the film, but it is still good viewing.

Try ""Purple Noon"", sit back and watch this graceful, beautiful man turn on sex appeal the like of which you will never see again. Once you see him, you will want more, I guarantee it.

Largely unknown in the USA, after some ill fated attempts at Holywood movies in the late sixties, Delon is one of France's biggest stars.  He and Jean-Paul Belmondo were the Redford and Newman of their generation.

Two very intelligent films have been made from it that capture different parts of it successfully: the latest is Anthony Minghella's 1999 big-budget Hollywood thriller starring Matt Damon, but the first was this beautifully photographed French version directed by Rene Clement starring Alain Delon as Ripley.

Clement's version succeeds best in its evocation of the lovely rarefied atmosphere of the tourist Italy of the American jetset: the cinematography has a crystalline postcard beauty that makes Rome and the Italian coast seem supernatually beautiful. It also has a much better Ripley in Delon than Minghella had in Damon: Delon is much less hesitant and much more desperate and amoral, and he also has the requisite handsomeness (and facial resemblance to the rich wastrel he murders and replaces) that Damon lacks. As the gorgeous, cruel Dickie Greenleaf (here called Phillipe), Maurice Ronet is absolutely first-rate, toying with Ripley in the mistaken belief that he holds all the cards in their friendship. Less successful as Phillipe's emotionally abused girlfriend Marge is Marie Leforet, who doesn't seem to react to Phillipe at all as an American girl would ever conceiveably do. The film is great at conveying an aura of homoerotic decadence, but it loses quite a bit by beginning the story in medias res: by not showing us the circumstances from which Ripley came, we have little sense at what is at stake in his masquerade. But this is this fine adaptation's only major shortcoming.",1154131200,15,2056,5.2272727272727275

All those problems are probably an effect of faulty manufacturing,  surface of this DVD doesn't look perfect.",1111795200,14,361,4.553846153846154
847993,5,6304298315,"This is one out of just two movies (the other being Trainspotting) that liked so much I wanted to read the book (once I found it it was a book).  Usually I love the book and hate the movie with a passion.  While I must admit that this movie doesn't exactly follow the book step by step, it does stick to the story (unlike Minghella's version).  Even with it's differences, I still loved the film.

The cinematography (sp?) is beautiful, the film is suspensful and compelling, and the casting is all you could ever want.  Maurice Ronet makes for a wonderful Dickie Greenleaf.  He's detached, self-centred, and cruel.  He seems to be playing some sort of game with Marge's emotions rather than actually loving her.  Ronet's Dickie is just like in the book, an arse.  Although Clement's Marge is more independent and more beautiful than she seems to be in Patricia Highsmith's novel, she's still Marge.  I think I actually like her better in the movie, Marie Laforet makes her more sympathetic.  As for Alain Delon, not only is he gorgeous, but he plays Tom marvelously.  He really makes you root for a killer.

I showed this movie to a friend of mine who's never watched foriegn film.  She told me that the film always kept her guessing and she couldn't take her eyes off the screen because she was so engrossed in the story.  She also said that Delon's portrayal of Tom really makes your opinion of the character change througout the film.  She's currently reading the book.  Not only that; after Purple Noon, I showed her Der Krieger Und Die Kaiserin and now I've got her hooked on foriegn film (;

To put it very simply, you must see this film!

847994,5,6304298315,"I saw this film, about ten years ago and mainly because I had read a review stating that Martin Scorsese had hailed this film as a masterpiece. I wasn't disappointed. The pace the locales and Alain Delon's great acting make this film a cut above the rest.

In defense to The Talented Mr. Ripley, seeing that other reviewers have sort of panned it in comparison to this film, I found The Talented Mr. Ripley equally great. As a matter of fact when I first saw Purple Noon I kept thinking That Ripley had  to have some sexual attraction to Greenleaf although the film does not show it. Then I saw TTMR and read some information on the actual book and I was like ""I knew it!""

Basically both films are about the same thing, wanting to be something you're not. As Matt Damon said in TTMR ""I would rather be a fake somebody than a real nobody"" sad but to the point.",1094860800,6,860,4.296296296296297

848112,5,6304298315,"If I had to give my personal list of the ten greatest film noir ever, this one would be one of them.
Delon reached one of his peaks as actor with this one. His sense of the betrayal symbol and above all the decadence moral symbol is what precisely makes an universe of difference with Matt Damon in Langhella remake. Damon is just only perverse, not decadent.
Maurice Ronet was always a prominent actor. Though his major achievement as actor was Feu follet from Louis Malle in 1963, it deserves a perfect balance with Delon.
Rene Clement was one of the most gifted french film maker from the post war generation. His major works were Forbidden games (1953)and this one.
The growing tension in this film invades you psycologically, slowly the film compells you and carries us to an unexpected ending, in that unforgettable sequence in front the sea.
Don't miss one of the golden gems in any age of the film noir. And remember Patricia Highsmith (Strangers on a train and the american friend) was the writer of this monumental work.",1085702400,3,1030,4.664835164835165

848115,4,6304298315,"This film came out almost forty years before Anthony Minghella's ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" but age has not worn down its value.
The basic plot is the same: Tom Ripley must convince Phillipe Greenleaf to return home to the U.S. Ripley eventually kills Greenleaf and assumes his identity, living the life he always felt he deserved.
Rene Clement's direction has tons of Hitchcockian overtones. The location shooting is just as impressive as the 1990's version. Both films do a lot with mirrors in different scenes, some enterprising film studies student could do a term paper on that. Delon's Tom Ripley is very suave and debonair, unlike Damon's characterization. Any homosexual element has been removed, with Tom's motivation for murder being his love for Marge. Oddly enough, Delon looks like ""TMR""'s Jude Law more than anyone else.
I wish this film had thrown caution to the wind, however, and really broke loose from censorous chains. I felt the film makers did not have the same liberties the ""TMR"" film makers had, and the film sometimes comes off as a little unfeeling and withdrawn. The final ironic end is a hilarious shocker. Combined, ""Purple Noon"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" would be one great film. I recommend ""Purple Noon.""

When will the message get through? Serious films need the serious treatment on disc, especially if we are going to be gouged with Disney prices. The absence of anamorphic enhancement on this film is close to criminal in my eyes, and the rest of the shoddy package, right down to the boilerplate on the case, is an insult. Criterion did a Laser Disc of this film, and this DVD needs the Criterion treatment. Tell me I'm having a bad dream!!",1012435200,85,607,4.428571428571429
848117,4,6304298315,"Many comparisons can be made between ""Plein Soleil""(better translated as ""Broad Daylight"" than ""Purple Noon"") and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"". They are both good films, with incredibly intriguing story lines and fine performances. The cinematography in both films is superb as well. The more recent version does look better, technically, but the Clement film is very pleasing to the eye, not just for the scenery, but for the incredible beauty of the young Alain Delon.
This is not really a 'great' film--it's really just about the intrigue, and it fascinates the viewer by forcing identification with a nefarious protagonist--but it is mighty entertaining.
The Miramax DVD is something of a disappointment. Apart from some flashing in several scenes, the film transfer looks mostly very good. There is some distortion in the mono soundtrack, which unfortunately mars Rota's lovely score. Yet, there is at least one moment when everything works together beautifully: for instance the non-dialogue scene where Tom Ripley looks over an outdoor fish market in Naples--the colors, Delon's face and the music combine for five minutes of cinematic magic.
The DVD is also a letdown in terms of features: there are three skimpy trailers, NOT including one for ""Plein Soleil"". The English subtitles must be turned on, they are not automatic, AND the French-language soundtrack must be selected from the setup menu, otherwise the disc defaults to the inferior English-dubbed version.

WHat I didn't like about PURPLE NOON is that it picks up right in the middle of the book, with no exposition or development of any of the characters. And the ending was very finite, not open-ended the way ""Ripley's"" was. What DID i like about Purple Noon?  It's the most beautiful color and cinematography I think I've ever seen on a screen.... gorgeously photographed.",1011398400,8,533,4.720430107526882
848119,3,6304298315,"By now, everyone has summarized the story, so I'm not going to cover the same ground.  Instead, the points that cause me to take off two stars from this movie: (1) The movie starts in the middle of the book.  Hence, the background information which develops Ripley's character, his humble beginnings and seduction into the good life, is left out.  Without this information, Mr. Ripley's motivations are not clear.  (2) Dickie Greenleaf has foreknowledge of Mr. Ripley's plot and netharious nature, yet does nothing about it.  For instance, Dickie finds his bank papers which have been stolen by Mr. Ripley.  When confronted, Mr. Ripley reveals his intentions, including how to assume Dickie's identity if he were hypothetically murdered!  Yet, Dickie continues to put Mr. Ripley up (perhaps out of aragance assuming he can deal with Tom?)  Then, surprise surprise, Tom Ripley kills Dickie just like he said he would.  (3) Mr. Ripley's sexual preferences are not ambiguous, taking away some of the suspence.  (4) The ending.
Of course, the real fun in reviewing this movie is comparing it to both the book and the 1999 ""Talented Mr. Ripley"" version.  I'm in the minority by liking the 1999 version better than this version.  In the 1999 version, it starts from the beginning of the book completing the whole story.  It better developes the Freddie Miles character, the fly in Mr. Ripley's devious plans.  It smartly ads an extra love interest (played by Cate Blanchet).  It better develops Dicke Greenleaf as a playboy character.  It more clearly shows Mr. Ripley as an unsophisticated twit in the beginning and his overall evolution to a man of the world.  Finally, the 1999 version better demonstrates the overall lesson, of how Mr. Ripley was, in the end, able to take over Dickie Greenleaf's life, at a very murderous cost.
If you get one, get the 1999 ""Talented Mr. Ripley""  If you really enjoyed it, then get this movie.",1009238400,10,1925,4.9071207430340555
848120,4,6304298315,"I saw this before I read the Patricia Highsmith mystery novel from which it was adapted, and before seeing the recent and excellent The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) directed by Anthony Minghella and starring Matt Damon, Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow.  Here the accomplished French director Ren Clment has Alain Delon, Maurice Ronet and Marie Lafort as his stars in this very fine interpretation.  Seeing it again only confirms my high opinion.

The fact that ""Purple Noon"" plays well after forty years is a testament to Clment's clean, objective direction and his faithful adherence to the Hitchcock formula.  Pretty poor boy goes after everything pretty rich boy has, including his yacht and his girl friend in this tightly focused thriller.  We see once again--cf., Polanski's Knife in the Water (1962) and the early Nicole Kidman vehicle Dead Calm (1989)--that some very bad things can happen when you get two men and one woman on a yacht in the middle of a whole lot of water.  Note too the Mediterranean rock island atmosphere reminiscent of Antonioni's L'Avventura (1960).  It will probably get me into trouble with Italian film aficionados to add that it's a little surprising that both films are from the same year, inasmuch as Plein Soleil is still a treat to watch, while L'Avventura seems terribly dated.  Perhaps the beautiful use of color and the charming locales and interiors so well done by Clment make the difference.

Delon is a particularly ""pretty"" and uncomplicated Tom Ripley, while Ronet is a somewhat nasty and macho Philippe (""Dickie"" in the novel) Greenleaf, and Lafort is a very sensual and sexy Marge.  All do a good job and are well directed by Clment whose attention to detail in all aspects of the production is admirable.  The fish market scene and the scene where Ripley projects Philippe's signature on the wall in order to practice it, and especially the cold, windy feel of being aboard the yacht work very well and keep us engaged.

Comparing the Minghella film, I would say it owes something to Plein Soleil (e.g., the jazz motif, the real love between Marge and Philippe) but is essentially a different spin.  Perhaps the most important difference is that there is no sexual ambiguity to Ripley's character in this film as there was in both the novel and Minghella's production.  Clment plays it straight throughout also eschewing any sort of psychological study of Ripley's murderous nature.  He even deviates from Highsmith's daring (at the time) resolution for something more traditional.  Nonetheless the very clever ending is beautifully ironic and will give you a surprising jolt.
