8548106,3,B00A8305QS,"Kamisama Dolls is a supernatural series with likable characters and, odd, but effective comedy.  I was very excited when I started watching this series because it seemed very mature, funny and refreshing.  However, around episode five the writing started to become lousy, and the story lost its initial positive momentum.

As far as its technical merits, Kamisama Dolls has cheap looking animation (the character designs are shaky at times), and the music score gets old pretty quick.  The notable exception is the song used in the opening; it is very cool.

Overall, Kamisama Dolls is not a terrible series.  It has good things like its quirky characters and a mysterious (and sometimes spooky) atmosphere.  But if you are interested in a story that wants to better develop its characters and offer a complete story with a resolution (it is set up as a season one with more episodes to come), this is not the series for you.",1363132800,3,925,4.853503184713376
8548107,4,B00A8305QS,"Kyohei has left his town to attend college in the city. He has a dark past. He used to be a Seki. Seki use their powers to control god dolls. The reason for these powers is never made clear. All we know is that there are people from his village that have these powers, and they constantly fight each other. Despite this unclear plot, a story emerges. Sort of. Kyohei's sister comes to stay with him; his best girl, Hibino, Hibino's boobs, and Hibino's Dad. They seem to have a peaceful life, training Lil' Sis Utao, and goofing off. Some enemies show up, and the past comes back to haunt Kyohei. The drama and action are almost too much for him to handle.

This anime is kind of strange. The back story is well written, but vague at the same time. As I said earlier, the characters pasts are covered pretty well, but the whole premise of god dolls is not explained at all. Why do they even exist? What is their purpose, and why does anyone give a crap about them. That makes no sense to me, but whatever.

The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are all pretty well done. It's a good series overall, but it does leave you hanging. If they don't continue Kamisama Dolls, they really wasted their time. This series could be something great if it is taken further. It has no business being 13 episodes long. It appears that there is more to come, but you never know. I liked this anime, but I can see it not going over too well with some due to the weird plot. It's rated MA, but I think that is a bad rating. There is some suggestive stuff, but no nudity. The language, and violence are kind of moderate. I think 14 and up is a better rating. I think that you should watch it online before buying. It's kind of steep for something that isn't a sure hit. You may like it, you may not. I think that it's worth checking out at least.",1361577600,6,1832,4.261494252873563
8548108,5,B00A8305QS,"And what is worse...this show teases you with a preview of events to come with no promise of a second season. ARRGG!!!

Anyways, God Dolls is an interesting series in the respect that...it never really becomes too predictable. The characters are mostly generic but the backstory keeps things on edge in most episodes. The characters come from a village where they've hid a secret. They have the ability to control these ""dolls"". They are more or less like giant puppets but have a supernatural origin which makes sure not everyone can control one. In the story you are mostly following a guy who was a former operator of one of these dolls. You also meet the successor, his younger sister. He is desperate to get away from the village and leave that world behind while she is struggling to control the doll.

At times this show will totally fool you. It acts very lighthearted and joyful...but then the backstory hits you and it plunges into very dark places. The dolls are not all helpful and the potential for huge battles becomes very high as humans try to control a power they weren't meant to control. You get to see why he wanted to leave the village and glimpses of the past he is trying to forget. It is a ride you didn't expect coming and by the time the series ends, it leaves you on a cliffhanger note yearning for that season two. I do not kid that the final scenes of this show is a preview of the potential second season and if you keep with the series till that point, you'll be wanting that season two.

It is not a terrible cliffhanger but enough of one where you will hope the studio decides to make season two. Overall in the end, this is a very nice little series. It is aimed at the older age, post high school demographic so be sure to enjoy the fantastic opening theme song that definitely gives it a more adult feel to it. The name of it is Fukanzen Nenshou and it is sung by Ishikawa Chiaki. The only major issues you'll likely have is the characters seeming a little generic. I got over it after a few episodes so give it that much of a shot.",1356739200,6,2068,4.3662337662337665
