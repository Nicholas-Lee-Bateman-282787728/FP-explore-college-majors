8355140,1,B0027VGXVA,"Ordered this through Amazon and we were shipped the wrong California Gold episode.  The outside cover was for the correct episode  but inside was Huell Howser's completely different episode all about cemeteries in the bay area.  We had also ordered the DVD and got a VHS tape instead.  Had to ship it back.  I ordered this for my Dad after seeing it on TV.  He had many happy memories of trips to Yosemite during the 1940's, 50's, etc.  He remembered the firefall and loved hearing about it on Huell's show.  I basically was trying to show him how you could find just about anything on amazon and it would be shipped promptly.  Ths is the first time I have ever had a problem like this.  Needless to say My Dad was not impressed.",1376697600,2,729,4.413533834586466
