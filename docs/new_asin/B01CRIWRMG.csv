7689101,5,B01CRIWRMG,"IT'S A GREAT BLOODY MOVIE. IT'S SO BAD IN EVERY WAY ,BUT I LOVED IT . THE CHARACTERS ARE WELL DEVELOPED AND SCARY . I COULD WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I BOUGHT A HAT JUST LIKE THE HERO WEARS LAST YEAR AND WAS VERY SURPRISED HE WAS WEARING THE SAME HAT IN THE MOVIE .  THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES DESTINED TO BECOME A CULT CLASSIC !!",1478736000,4,335,3.7857142857142856
7689102,4,B01CRIWRMG,"Toro Loco, called ""Cowboy"" for much of the film has a vendetta against the drug dealers that shot his son and left him for dead. He teams up with an odd bunch of characters and encounters a few oddballs along the way. The film, appears to be something in the way of campy, and I believe by design. Either way, I was laughing. The soundtrack was great. The dialogue was funny, although I wish I didn't have to read it. The boss in the wheelchair  discussing ""what problem"" was a hoot as was the ugly pictures of the police officers daughter who looked like they had a distortion of his face. The classic load up with weapons scene was funny too as was the overweight cross dresser.

It was funny in Spanish,  I watched it with subtitles. Hopefully they will give it a good dub that doesn't sound like an old Italian/Japanese film.

Guide: Plenty of F-bombs. Scantily clad dancers with some groping. Man being raped from behind. Plenty of blood and killing.",1475884800,2,955,4.502890173410405

8753998,3,B01CRIWRMG,"First, as a few have noted, this is from Chile.  Those license plates are dead give aways.  (Same with the style of charrasco sandwich.)

This is a mediocre flick.  It has a familiar feel to it if you've ever watched The Shield, Death Wish or anything of that ilk.  Really, it's not that bad.

By the way, there ARE subtitles.  I have no idea how that reviewer didn't figure it out on his/her own.",1500422400,2,397,4.283783783783784

8754004,5,B01CRIWRMG,"The movie DOES HAVE subtitles but they must be switched on. The setting is not Mexico but CHILE. B movie type pretty obviously derivative of other well known movie trends. However, if you find raunchiness, bloody violence good escapist entertainment , this movie delivers the way some with big budgets don't. It excels with its dialogue , which is wall to wall cussing , extremely coarse and VERY funny.",1479254400,,403,4.855072463768116
