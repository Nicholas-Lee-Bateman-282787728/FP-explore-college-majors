8174993,3,B0009TP9T4,"This is not a bad dvd if you are into Miami Rueda styling in everthing you dance but it looked strange to me.

The bachata looked really strange to me. Rueda enfolding turns in bachata. Looked strange.

Also had a great deal of trouble getting the dvd to play. We have seven dvd players plus computers that play dvd's & none can play the dvd really well.

Only really of interest to Miami Rueda styling dancers",1135555200,4,410,4.368421052631579
