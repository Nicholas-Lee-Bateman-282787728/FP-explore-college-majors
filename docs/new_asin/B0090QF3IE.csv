Will be applying this to horses, but I can see that it would be also easy to shift over to use with other species, like dogs if you are well versed in training. Even if you do not own or plan to own a horse, watching the magick that unfolds with Liberty Training and the rapport between the human and horse is worth the time. Surely, it would benefit us to pass this knowledge on to how we interact with each other as humans as well. :)
The seller was prompt in shipping this item, and it came well packaged for a safe arrival. Now, there are just three more Liberty Trainers for me to collect. :)",1353024000,,696,4.28030303030303
