7949907,1,B00005QAPS,"Terrible acting... I mean really bad and mediocre... I was born in Peru and like many other Peruvians I despised terrorists that drown our country in the most absolut poverty, they were not rebels, they were filthy terrorists... and killed innocent people in the name of the revolution... give a brake!!! who ever came up with this stupid story didn't know that out of the 35,000 people that this terrorist groups killed 95 percent were innocent families, children, women ,men and hard working people.... Fujimori could have not been a saint either but you can't compare... he was loved by the poor ones... he was propably the first president in decades in Peruvian history that did something to improve their standard of living... Of course this movie is pre-911, I wonder if they would have dared to do it afterwards, since they accused the CIA and US to be against the revolution and helping Fujimori to get rid of ""innocent and idealistic rebels"" ...In other words don't spend your money or time in this junk!!!",1106611200,,1015,4.805714285714286
7949908,1,B00005QAPS,"This movie, that was not even filmed in Peru, is pro-terrorist. The MRTA and the shining path killed thousands of peruvians...This movie has also bad actors...and bad action...thanks god I was able to return the movie and get a refund.",1100822400,2,235,4.9
7949909,1,B00005QAPS,"This is a badly made and badly acted movie that plays fast and loose with reality. Although the Fujimori regime was far from angelic the fascist-type depiction of the goverment in this movie is a distortion of reality. Also, one must realize the Tupac Amaro and the Sendero Luminoso were terrorist groups responsible for the murder of thousands of Peruvians. Having lived in Peru during the Fujimori regime, he was considered a hero by most Peruvians who hated the violence and murder committed by the terrorist groups portrayed in this movie. In conclusion, count this movie as another Hollywood distortion of reality, badly made, badly acted, and best left for the garbage can of badly made movies.",1046476800,2,700,4.9914529914529915
7949910,1,B00005QAPS,"This lousy lunk is just another terrorist-based loser. You wonder with all the political rhetoric bandied about if the evil comes from the supposedly repressive Peruvian government that we never actually see. Or is the evil a bunch of whiny disgruntled trigger happy patriots who don't know the meaning of negotiation prefering the predictable take over of the Japanese embassy hoping that holding hostages will get political prisoners released. Or is the evil that we're supposed to shout yippee that violence triumphs against the terrorists so we can have a 'winner' and 'loser'. Joe Lara as Victor Bernales complete with Latin accent was modestly believable though he'd never pass for a Peruvian with his light skin and blue eyes. Billy Drago as his 'brother' at least looks Latino but his accent was forced and all he did was yell and scream and get beaten up then miraculously recovered fully from his evil government's torture in time to take over the Japanese Embassy. We have his girlfriend who was only there as eye candy. We have an American reporter who thinks he's going to get a Pulizer like he's the first to ever report a war. The real terrorists in this film isn't the so-called repressive Peruvian government, or the angry patriots led by Lara and Drago storming around with guns shouting ""Libertad"". It was the writers, the director, and the country, who let them in to film. I only bought it because Joe Lara was in it. Sadly even he couldn't save it. Sadder still is that only those who love violence think the retelling of this story is beneficial. If the Peruvian government or the American Embassy were contacted about their actual role in the real story they'd probably say ""no comment"".",1013817600,,1711,4.843003412969283
