7873759,5,6304502397,Very interesting storyline. Kind of twisty. Really enjoy all of Mickey Rourke's movies. This one was no exception. So glad I found it.,1376438400,,134,4.869565217391305

Anthony Michael Hall left me speechless. (Granted I am biased because AMH has been my favorite actor since I was twelve :) I loved the dialogue between the characters.  If you like movies about sex and manipulation, you will LOVE this film. Anyone can have sex, but when one masters sex, and uses it to bend the will of a man THAT makes for an interesting story. Loved this film! Mickey Rourke was intense, Annabel Schofield was powerful, and Anthony Michael Hall was brilliant!

7873761,4,6304502397,"You know it's going to have a slightly trashy quality to it, given two of its stars are from ""Wild Orchid."" Starting with this expectation, however, it was better than I expected! Rourke may not strike some as a psychiatrist, but he's valid here as a Beverly Hills one, especially since his character is admittedly addicted to women. Shrinks are only human, after all. I was expecting to hate Anthony-Michael Hall, but he was actually good, particularly in the scene where he first meets Rourke in his office & they're talking about sex. This movie was at its best when Rourke is musing about sex and women. Oh, and when he shot off the tip of Anthony-Michael Hall's nose! Carre Otis' acting was the best I've seen from her. The pain on her face as Rourke caused her heartache seemed very genuine (she was probably drawing from some real-life experience, I'm sure!) The overall mood of the film was satisfactorily seamy, and it was refreshing in its relatively quiet, unassuming development and resolution. Keep Mickey Rourke working!",974073600,13,1034,4.8474576271186445
7873762,4,6304502397,"I loved this film.  Twist was surprisingly unexpected, the picture itself was very formalist.  Narrative was not strait and step by step.  It starts with the same scene as it ends. Besides, this film has implicit causality  which becomes explicit in the end. Has some associational editing (the  scene where Rourke's character talks about the  errection in his encounter  with one hooker who was "" warm and sticky like a honey dew"". I  think , this film is quite artistic ( although, not as much as Un Chien  Andalou ). I love the music here by Michael Lorenz. And if you like Polish  films or if you appriciate formalist films over the box-office Hollywood  flicks, you definitely need to see Exit in Red.",944438400,4,706,4.658536585365853
7873763,1,6304502397,"Let's just say it was the longest hour and half in my life.  It had a nice concept for a movie, but the director or somebody messed this one up badly!!!  As for good ol' Mickey let me just say...He didn't convince me he  was a doctor!  As for his scenes with his estranged wife Carrie Otis dry  and boring.  Even the few sex scenes were dry and boring.  Bad directing,  bad acting, bad editing, bad props and staging...JUST BAD EVERYTHING!!!!!  Mickey Rourke even looks bad!!!!  And that's hard to say for a die hard fan  like me! Just leave this one on the shelves!!!!  Please!!!",934934400,4,580,4.367924528301887
