8441105,5,B004TYQU1G,"This romantic comedy TV drama has a great cast and they all work very well together.  Ji Jin-Hee as Jp Jae-hee (his 13th TV drama) and Uhm Jung-hwa as Jang Moon-jung (her first TV drama) are two of the most believable romantic couples I have ever seen.  And they are not teenagers in high school.
There is a younger romantic interest and maybe even one for the parents.  Yoo Ah-in is new here and he shows great talent in a supporting role.  His next TV role is in the fascinating historical drama, the Sungkywan Scandal  .
And you know that the two romantic leads will finally get their acts together and be together - what holds one's interest over many episodes is how.  I really enjoyed seeing aspects of Korean culture and life in Seoul.  This is a fun show to watch and I did not want it to end.
This is the first Korean drama that had an ending that I liked.  This TV drama will not disappoint.",1388016000,,901,4.289940828402367
8441106,4,B004TYQU1G,"This is a 16 part Korean TV miniseries romantic comedy that is based on an earlier Japanese TV miniseries (Kekkon Dekinai Otoko) with the same title.  It has a theme that also recalls ""The 40 year old Virgin"" movie.  The series tells of a story of a 40 year old guy who lives his life by himself with little prospects for marriage. He is an architect who designs houses.  He likes classical music and an ordered lifestyle.  The story brings four women into his life (one coworker, a neighbor, a ""gold digger"", and a doctor).  All four women are attracted to him and the main plot involves the architect and the doctor.  They have a very bumpy relationship after he has to go to the hospital for a stomach ailment and meets the doctor for the first time.  The architect's mother is desperate to have her son marry because of his age. She has an impending surgery and requests that her son and doctor go on a ""date"" before she goes to have surgery.  The architect's idiosyncracies and eccentric behavior is a put off to the doctor and makes for many hilarious scenes.  The scene when they first kiss is the basis for the title for my review.  When you see it, the kiss is a very awkward one.  The clumsiness when the two of them think about having an intimate encounter is funny.  The supporting cast are very good and help to carry the storyline's humor to the end.  The neighbor's dog character (a chihuahua) is very cute and better than the bull dog in the Japanese version, in my opinion.  The Korean version extends the story a bit longer than the Japanese version and develops a relationship between the couple on a closer basis than the earlier version.  The ending of the series may appear a bit ambiguous as to what will happen between the two of them.  The answer to this somewhat unclear ending is seen after the final credits when a small video is shown that includes a housing diagram modification by the architect (One thing that was an impediment to their relationship) and a final closeup of an object that tells of the final ending.

This listing is for the Singapore (Poh Kim Video) version of the TV miniseries which has good English subtitles.  There are several other versions (Japan and Taiwan versions with no English subtitles), Hong Kong version (with subaverage English subtitles), Malaysian version (with above average English subtitles), and a Korea TV version (English subtitle quality is excellent).  The total run time is under 18 hours.

The KBS (Korean TV) version is listed under this link.  Note that the KBS version is region 3 coded and has English subtitles (the extra materials are only in Korean).
