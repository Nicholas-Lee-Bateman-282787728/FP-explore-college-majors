8291732,4,B001D5F376,"A movie about a ""boy"" in a girls body that fights people? I figured I would give this a shot and see. If you are expecting a great story line and outstanding acting, you should pass on this movie. This movie is so ridiculous it's pretty funny. There is quite a bit of unnecessary nudity in this movie. If you like other movies like this, you will probably enjoy this movie, It is more of a cult classic type of movie. I would compare it to Troma movies such as the Toxic Avenger, if you are familiar with those. Biggest downside, subtitles. Without that, I would say 5 stars.",1453248000,,575,4.284403669724771

8291734,4,B001D5F376,"Being such a fan of the Miki Sugimoto and Reiko Ike pink movies; it seems those great movies are being replaced by these more silly movies! This movie has a few interesting scenes and it kept my attention But? It would of been a better movie with the dad and guys out of the picture, they brought nothing to movie! The girls are very cute and a fair amount of topless scenes! Maybe the writer or director should simplify the material next time! If you like these type of movies its ok, but not a good movie for a casual viewer !",1389657600,,528,4.186274509803922
8291735,1,B001D5F376,"This DVD is falsely advertised as wide screen format when in fact it is a letter boxed wide screen which is formatted for 4:3 ratio screens only!!  That's right, it is not meant to be played on a wide screen and there is no mention of this in the advertizement.  As a result on a wide screen TV the images are distorted and stretched with black bars above and below. Everyone looks fat. This DVD is simply unwatchable. It makes me wonder if it is a bootleg.

  The subtitles are also terrible.  They use white letters in a jagged black outline. It looks like low resolution blown up large.

  If you still have an old cathode ray TV in 4:3 format and you like dubbed, you might like this.",1377993600,,688,4.271317829457364
8291736,3,B001D5F376,"How to sum up Sukeban Boy?  Easy, a Japanese Troma Movie.

For those who don't know what Troma is, let me break it down.  This movie is ultra cheap, quickly made, jam packed with nudity (although no sex and no full frontal), and when they can, they throw in horribly staged fight scenes and cheap gore.

Is this a good movie?  No.  Did I, an avid fan of trash cinema get a kick out of it?  Yes.

The film actually does a lot right.  Some shots are very well staged, and this appears to have been shot on film, or at least high quality digital.  Not all the acting is terrible, with the lead actually turning in a very goofy, but appropriate performance. There are also a few gore gags that look pretty darn good.  The biggest plus is that this movie does not overstay it's welcome.  It moves quickly, and at no point was I ever bored.  Grossed out, yes.  Bored, no.

Honestly though, I was all set to give this movie two stars, and then the credits sequence started and I nearly died laughing.  To sum it up, this film is an equal opportunity exploiter (and with a nice little ""love is love"" message at the end).

If you like goofy, trashy movies like Class of Nuke Em High or Poultrygeist, then check this one out.  If you are expecting something along the lines of the big budget Cutey Honey movie, skip it.",1355011200,,1309,4.273469387755102

8291738,4,B001D5F376,"I think whether or not you will like this movie depends on what kind of movie you're expecting it to be.  If you take it too seriously and take the time to scrutinize the acting and every camera angle, then this movie probably isn't for you.  However, if you're like me, and you expect an off the wall gory experience a la Machine Girl and Tokyo Gore Police, you will be more than satisfied.  While I did not particularly love Machine Girl or TGP, I enjoyed them enough to give this one a try.  Let me just say that this movie far exceeded my expectations.  The main character plays a male in an obviously female body. When he/she goes to an all girls' school, all manner of weird things transpire. Gore and lots of gratuitous topless Japanese girls follow.  Really, what more could you ask for?  I found the movie much funnier than I did erotic. In fact it's not really erotic at all. The nudity is so pointless that you just can't help but laugh.  This movie is absolutely hilarious, and the poor acting and filming only serve to amp up the kitcsh factor. However a few of the attempts at humor, like the ubiquitous fart jokes, start to fall flat for me.  Also the very short - maybe 60 mins. - film starts to drag towards the end as the constant nudity and just plain bizarre theme start to lose their 'punch'.  All in all this film surprised me with how entertaining it was, and it is highly recommended to fans of the Japanese comedy-horror genre. Invite some friends over and have a great time.",1239753600,18,1500,4.382671480144404
8291739,1,B001D5F376,"Horrible movies.  Terible filming, non-existing acting.  I would not even call this a fetish movie.  It is just bad.  Looks like it was made by teenagers with a handheld video camera.  I would not recommend this to anyone, even if you are looking for cult/campy.",1236729600,,262,4.733333333333333
