8221005,5,B000W22Z0O,"A fantastic DVD set, great value and full to the brim with Halloween spirit.
There's not much I can add to others reviews, other than to say my only problem with it was that it didn't have a longer run time!

Being in the UK, there are very few haunted attractions to visit- this DVD proved a real eye-opener to how big the Halloween season is in the US.
Ah, how I wish it were so over here in Blighty. Sob.

Dan Roebucks presentation, along with the crotchety Dr Shocker, shows there's still lots of life in Halloween scares attractions.
Now I want to visit them all!",1434412800,,568,4.299065420560748

8221007,5,B000W22Z0O,"I really liked this documentary, it was interesting and fun to watch. I myself love Halloween, and have watched many documentaries, this one is definitely in my top rated.",1375228800,2,171,4.931034482758621
8221008,5,B000W22Z0O,"In Halloween...The Happy Haunting of America, Daniel Roebuck and Bob Burns set out across the country to find some of the best haunted houses in America. In addition, there are also various interviews with famous people discussing their love of Halloween, as well as a little bit of Halloween history (Mostly related to the Universal Monsters and their impact).

While the documentary is certainly dated (About 16 years old as of this review), it is still interesting enough that it can be enjoyed immensely. It also helps that the second disc includes a 10th anniversary update of sorts with new attractions.

If you love Halloween, this is something I certainly wouldn't pass up.",1370736000,5,681,5.017699115044247
8221009,3,B000W22Z0O,I thought this was just going to be showing Haunted Houses all around the US but it was a lot of other boring crap that just didn't interest me at all. I LOVE HALLOWEEN and splurged on this because I love seeing the inside of Haunted Houses. It did show some but not enough...It seems like OLD footage not like the ones on TV that show during Halloween that are more up to date. I would send it back if I could.,1326412800,,411,4.024390243902439
8221010,5,B000W22Z0O,"Nothing to say here other than this is an awesome film. It really is just a tour of the best of halloween in America. Its fun, insightful, and I've watched it at least a half dozen times in the first two weeks. LOL. Go...enjoy!",1304035200,4,227,4.181818181818182
