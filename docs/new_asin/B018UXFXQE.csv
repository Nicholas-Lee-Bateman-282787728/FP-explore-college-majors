7555635,3,B018UXFXQE,"Overall the quality of the episodes are good.  However there are a few episodes that have been edited that appear differently in the box set as composed to the original air production.  One is the finale in which Roger sings at Lisa's wedding.  In addition, the episode in where Tamara plays a modern day Cinderella --- the song she dances with Jordan at his party is different.  The original song was Usher and Monica ""Slow Dance"".  The episodes should not be altered.  They should appear as they did when you watched the series on television.  If it has something to do with the rights, they should have been acquired prior to release of the series box set.",1491004800,8,659,4.581196581196581
7555636,3,B018UXFXQE,I'm glad to have all the seasons of my all time favorite series. Let's be real though - some of the greatest parts of this series are missing. The Cinderella episode with Tamera and Jordan was to a different song. Really??? Come on now. Even the graduation was missing important songs and scenes. What a disappointment.,1490400000,4,319,4.714285714285714

7555645,5,B018UXFXQE,"Comes with odd numbering on the dvds. The dvd quality isn't the best BUT where else can you find all the episodes and seasons? So, it's worth it. The editing on some of the episodes are interesting. I remember watching the show and some parts are edited out or aren't included. But there are parts added as well. I don't know just interesting if you remember the show and when you watch it it's a little different.",1484006400,3,414,4.3896103896103895

7555650,4,B018UXFXQE,its so cool and wrapped tight the packaging is so neat. And it came with seventeen again  I didn't even know that. Honestly the only reason why I returned it was because my sister didn't want it. I would've kept it for myself but I work a lot so I know I won't have time to watch them. Any 90s baby would love this. I'd say it's a good buy but we never watched or opened the set. But from the outside it seems like a really purchase. Btw it's 3 DVD in each case.,1482710400,,462,3.863157894736842

7555655,3,B018UXFXQE,"I love Sister, Sister! It was one of my favorite TV shows growing up, and I was thrilled to see the box set was finally on Amazon. When I received the set, the box that the DVDs were in was all cracked and broken. The set is pretty expensive, so I was pretty disappointment that the case was broken. I can't even shut the case properly. Aside from that, the set comes with all six seasons and the movie Seventeen Again staring Tia and Tamera.",1474675200,3,442,4.211764705882353

7555657,4,B018UXFXQE,"This is truly a great buy.
HOWEVER...
If you are a true Sister Sister fan and grew up with the show like I did, there are alot of disappointments in this set.
If wouldn't be a Complete set without...CUTS! They seriously took a lot of the funny out of some episodes. Starting with season one working all the way down to six.

A lot of nitpicky music cuts were made. Thus making scenes shorter. Some are very noticeable like when the girls all go to the beauty salon in season 2. Lisa says they could be the new En Vogue and they sing  a 5 sec chorus of ""Never Gonna Get It"". CUT! There's way more cuts throughout the season. and the first.

In Season 4, the episode ""Cafeteria Lady."" Tia has a vision of Lisa doing a musical number...CUT!

Season 5, a beautiful dance b/w Jordan and Tamera. The song is suppose to be ""Play Another Slow Jam."" It's some whack hip-hop song that sounds not 90's related AT ALL! Like seriously guys. COME ON!

But the one cut that pissed me off the most, THE MOTHER OF ALL CUTS...was Season 5, Graduation, when the girls and their friends and practicing their walk, and then they start to have fun a do a little rendition of George Clinton's Atomic Dog (Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay). Lisa comes in and starts getting down with them and they all look at her like she's crazy. THE FUNNIEST BIT ON THE SHOW AND IT WAS CUT!

I want to write a letter I'm SO PISSED!
 I wish I could understand the way copyrights/license to things work. If a character even references a song it has the potential to be cut.

If you have any questions, just write me on here.
This was just a small quick summary. I wrote stuff down in detail of what I noticed.",1469491200,168,1669,4.242902208201893
7555658,5,B018UXFXQE,love love love it! thanks for making the whole series available. so fun,1468886400,,71,4.538461538461538
7555659,5,B018UXFXQE,The set is good. While having all seasons in own case would've been nice the overall set is great despite my annoyances with some of the episodes being edited. But it's nice to have the whole series on DVD finallu.,1468627200,,214,4.375
7555660,5,B018UXFXQE,I dig the setup and I cant wait to start watching the episodes I'm so excited. It was 68.99 when I bought it which it has already gone down another 3 dollars since my purchase. I still don't think its a terrible price.,1468368000,,218,4.093023255813954
7555661,5,B018UXFXQE,"I remember watching Sister, Sister on Disney Channel during my elementary school years and loving every second of it!

7555666,5,B018UXFXQE,"Great packaging except the fact that each of the boxes inside are marked as ""Seasons 1&2"" and ""Seasons 3&4"" rather than the way it is pictured in description images. The discs work wonderfully and are packaged well, so grateful to finally have this series on dvd!!!",1465430400,4,265,4.782608695652174
7555667,4,B018UXFXQE,"After waiting for years for Sister Sister to finally get released on DVD as a complete series. It finally did in 2016. After seeing the price on this set, I was shocked and couldn't believe it since it was around $120 during the pre-order. This release was pushed a few times and when it finally officially released, the set was still on Backorder. When customers finally received their box sets, the reviews on here were a little on the negative side rather positive, noting that the set was low quality and that the packaging had typos (which you can see in other customer photos on here).
Well, I finally bought the set (for $79.99 - which is about $13 a season), and I was happy to see the typo on the packaging has been corrected (it now says Seasons 1-3, Seasons 4-6, rather than Seasons 1&3, Seasons 4&6). The box is made out of glossy cardboard. The DVDs come into two thick cases, rather than the six separate cases shown in the picture (which would have made this set a better buy for its price). The box set also mentions that some of the episodes maybe edited from the original network air and that some music has been changed - but I believe the episodes have been edited for music rather than for content (much like the Disney Channel, ABC Family, and UP! have edited these episodes for language, sexual content, etc.) but the series finale ending was edited from Roger's performance. I noticed that on Season Two's episode of Hair Today, the cut Lisa and the Twin's singing Never Gonna Get It, in the mirror after their haircuts. I'm sure there are more cuts that I have yet to find. Also, I am unsure if the discs of Season 1 & 2 are are the same as the original release, but they might be considering that Seasons 1 & 2 are the only discs that have Closed Captions available and they say Copyright 2008/2009 on the discs, while Season 3-6 say 2016. This set also included disc artwork on all 18 discs.

While I haven't watched all 18 discs, I skimmed through a few episodes, mostly checking to see if any episodes were edited, but the video quality is the best I've seen of this show.

The set also includes a bonus disc, which is Seventeen Again, a movie the twins starred in - its just a bonus disc and has no connection with the series, other than starring the twins.

I'm giving this set 4/5 stars at the moment, a star was removed due to some edited scene.",1465430400,38,2378,4.4
7555668,5,B018UXFXQE,"VERY satisfied with my Sister,Sister box set. LOVE IT!! still remember episodes like it was yesterday. Others say their DVD reads Seasons 1&3...mine says 1-3. Either way that wasn't a problem for me. HAPPY i made the purchase. Worth every penny if you're a fan of the series.",1465084800,,275,4.75

7555676,1,B018UXFXQE,"I was so excited to receive my Sister, Sister set in today.  However, this is easily the cheapest complete series set I've ever seen.  Here's just a few defects:

1.  The cases don't even stay shut.
2.  The cases are labeled ""1&3"" and ""4&6"" instead of ""1-3"" and ""4-6"".
3.  The quality would suggest that the DVD's were made before there was such a thing as high definition.
4.  The series finale was edited.  They completely changed the ending by cutting out the part where Roger sings at Lisa's wedding.
5.  The artwork looks like it was designed by a 3-year-old.

I would ask for my money back but I already know how that will go.",1463011200,35,632,4.370689655172414

7555680,5,B018UXFXQE,"Just got the set today and I am excited to get to watch it one of these day! My only complaint so far is the deceptive packaging because the final product and what is displayed on this site are totally different. The picture clearly shows separate cases for each season but the actual item is two big cases holding multiple seasons.

That is not a huge deal to me because I am more concerned about the quality of the episodes and weather they are uncut or not. If the image displayed is not what the packaging is going to look like then please update that or have VEI update it because there are some folks who will have a cow over that sort of thing.",1461110400,8,651,4.208
