8206190,1,B0000ACX80,"I could not get this DVD to play on any of three different brand and model US sold BluRay players. The problem does not appear to be a region issue as this disc is Region-free (NOT Region 1).  I confirmed with Stockfisch, the wonderful company that produced this disc and many of Sara's excellent recordings, that this DVD is in PAL format. It is NOT in NTSC as advertized-and that probably explains why it won't play on my US gear. In response to my complaint Amazon sent me a replacement disc believing it was a defective disc but it behaved exactly the same, so I'm regretfully asking for a refund.

The content, which I can only view on my laptop computer, is delightful.  The SQ is excellent and the performances absolutely delightful. What a treat to see Sara and Chris live and up close.

If your player plays PAL discs to your TV you will love this DVD. But I am downrating this product from 5 stars to one because of USA playability issues.",1373328000,,949,4.436781609195402
