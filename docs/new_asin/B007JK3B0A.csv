8518349,3,B007JK3B0A,"REVIEWING JOINTLY JAMES CAMERON'S AND JOHN ANKERBERG'S VIDEOS ABOUT THE TALPIOT TOMB SUPPOSEDLY OF JESUS AND HIS FAMILY

As a lifelong Christian (except for a short stint of my family in L.D.S. Mormonism as a child), I've been mostly a devout, Confessional Lutheran in convictions, however personal practice has varied from decade to decade. I have to confree, however, that James Cameron's documentary, ""The Lost Tomb of Jesus"", initially shook me up a bit. Evangelist and Christian intellectual John Ankerberg is a sectary (having hit close to bottom, his affiliation is essentially Baptist) and a professional apologist for (i.e., defender of) Christianity, at least of sectarian Christianity, but whom, on the whole, genuine, believing Protestants (i.e., Lutherans, Presbyterian/Reformed, Moravian, and Anglican) also can respect, at least to a large degree, however guardedly. Both videos have their origin in broadcast material.

This review is most directly of Ankerberg's video refutation, ""The John Anerberg Show's Response to 'The Lost Tomb of Jesus'"", James Cameron's DVD documentary about the ""lost"" tomb of Jesus and of his family at Talbiot (located within greater al-Quds, in the near region of what is a.k.a. Jerusalem), but it also reviews, albeit less directly, Cameron's own video production. Ankerberg ventures further afield into matters about Gnostic writings and other related topics, as Cameron's video itself also does, but here I am concentrating on what Cameron's and Ankerberg's videos have to say most directly concerning the Talpiot discoveries.

I need to delve into these matters which Cameron's video, featuring primarily the comments and analysis of Simcha Jacobovici and those in his circle, for myself, ""pro"" and ""con"". I would feel more at ease with Cameron's ""The Lost Tomb of Jesus"" video, to which Ankerberg responds at times merely in his own too limitingly selective way, if there had been fewer Jews who were involved in Cameron's and Jacobovici's project, since such religionists tend to have very good reasons to desire to undermine Christian claims. That said, those involved in that documentary do not seem to be behaving deviously in that kind of way, at least not obviously, but that is not so easy (if at all possible) to assess on the basis of this video documentary alone.

It is worth noting here that since Amazon-U.S.' sole associated source (not Amazon itself) for Ankerberg's DVD on the subject of the Talpiot tomb being unavailable for delivery to customers here in Canada, that I had to make resort to numerous YouTube videos of various portions from Ankerberg's DVD or from the programme from which the Ankerberg DVD derives (probably together comprising most or all of what is on Ankerberg's own documentary). It takes some effort to ferret out all of these segments from other videos about the Talpilot tomb, but it is well worth the effort. Ankerberg's ministry's own sales arm can provide the material on DVD, on CD, or in transcript form in print, but the fees to send it to our Dominion of Canada are so utterly exorbitant that I had to abandon any hope of obtaining the DVD itself. Thus I have had to content myself with what I can find on the Web of Ankerberg's programming about the Talpiot family tomb.

In print as well as even on the Web, there are numerous well-reasoned textual and video refutations, e.g., on YouTube and elsewhere (Ankerberg's among many) of what the archeological evidence which Cameron, Jacobovici, et al. assess may mean (or not) on their own DVD. An example, just for starters, could be to read young Dillon Burroughts' ""The Jesus Family Tomb Controversy: How the Evidence Falls Short"" (Ann Arbor, Mich.: Nimble Books, 2007, 140 p.; ISBN 978-0-9788138-7-1), as a short book-length discussion, as well as other monographs, articles, and Web resources concerning the Talpiot tomb, including among them, of course, Simcha Jacobovici's own monograph about the Talpiot tomb which, like Burroughs' book, also saw publication in 2007. A good Web article (on the ""Y-Jesus"" site) is ""The Jesus Family Tomb: Fact or Fiction? Jesus' Bones Discovered?"" There is so much more available to those who wish to read or to view further on the controversy. A lot of questions rightly arise with which those involved in the DVD documentary of Cameron and Jacobovici do not deal at all adequately. More research and verification need to be carried out and, indeed, that process has started. The presence of such a radically doubting roguish Catholic scholar as the infamous Domenic Crossan (who once posited an hypothesis that the crucified body of Jesus was thrown out as refuse, which dogs probably devoured), or of any other radical but at least nominally Christian-identifying experts, is less helpful than some might suppose. Ankerberg's videos rightly excoriate ""stacking the deck"" with such scholars, whose bias is always against the reliability of the Holy Scriptures. There should have been more orthodox Christians also involved in the project to pose questions in addition to the sordid likes of Crossan. Ankerberg's video does an excellent job in demolishing the speculations of those who conjecture aloud on Cameron's video about history-of-doctrine and early Christian theology, Christology especially, thoroughly putting to route the speculations of Crossan and of musings on early Christianity that Cameron's and Jacobovici's team cite.

Ankerberg also skillfully casts doubt on the viability of some of the evidence, such as the legibility of the inscription on the ossuary of Jesus Himself. However important such reservations are, however, they are not conclusive, but they are quite significant to take into consideration. It needs to be noted, too, that many of the experts whom the viewer sees and hears speaking on the documentary which Cameron sponsored have stated that they were misrepresented on the Jacobovici-Cameron documentary; others have retracted what they previously had claimed.

Ankerberg's team on video state that the crushing statistical probabilities that the team for Cameron's and Jacobovici's documentary cite in favour of their case are much less than stated there, if the evidence as Ankerberg's team examines it is taken into account. Ankerberg and his guest explain their reasons in some rather convincing detail but they present no mathematically stated alternative to what the recalculated statistical odds would amount. However, there is some brief mention of a few alternative statistical calculations of probability that have been made. Still, that is of limited help, mathematically speaking, to inquirers who might like to compare mutually opposed tallies of probability on the part of Ankerberg's team as they would compare to those of the mathematician whom Simcha Jacobovici consulted. It is clear, from reading about this matter, that discounting and excluding the ossuary of St. James, Jesus' brother, which almost certainly should not have been reckoned among those pertaining to the Talpiot site, very greatly would alter the tally of probabilities that Jacobovici et al. have had calculated on their project's behalf. It is time to state some alternatives, however provisional, in statistical form to cement that difference!

An historical site exists, one that few Roman Catholic, Protestant, or sectarian scholars of the West have investigated since the 20th century and afterwards, and which is very remote, located in an area of high and rugg&egrave;d terrain in Turkish Kurdistan, quite arduous to gain access to, namely the jointly Christian (apparently Armenian Orthodox) and Islamic holy site of Egil (pronounced ""EH-yil""), which, roughly speaking, is in the mostly rural (and much of it only very sparsely inhabited) area that surrounds the major city of Diyarbakir. Egil had been a pilgrimage destination, of Christians and Muslims alike, in centuries past, but, except on the part of the Muslim population in the vicinity of Dyarbakir and of Egil itself, is little known today. The Turkish government, to avoid potential flooding, due to a large project affecting the Tigris River's flow, relocated Egil's antiquities to the present site near the mountain top of the steep slope that lies facing Egil across a steep chasm (on the holy site's side). The apex of the mountain top is only a short walk away and overlooks, straight down thousands of feet past, over a precipitous cliff, the Tigris River and its banks and, back above and across the divide, a massive fortress from Assyrian times atop the opposite more sloping side of the chasm. The town of Egil had been the site of a very ancient Armenian Orthodox church, which the Turkish government, in its effort to efface the historic Armenian presence within Turkey, destroyed (in the 1960s, as I recall). The holy site of Egil, among other things, purports to be where several of the Holy Women around Jesus are buried (but not His Mother, St. Mary the Bless&egrave;d Virgin, who, unlike the other women, returned to Jerusalem, present day al-Quds). These are the ladies of Jesus' close personal circle mentioned in the N.T. Gospels, such as St. Joanna (mentioned in St. Luke 8:3), much venerated among the Armenian Orthodox, and those women who stood at the foot of his Cross at the Crucifixion (vid. St. Mark 15:40, St. John 19: 25, which name them, as well as St. Luke 23:49). When Jesus confided His Mother to the care of His belov&egrave;d male disciple, the only man, apart from a Roman guard, present at the foot of the Cross, that righteous man took them to the remote location, which has become known as the town of Egil, to protect them from persecution.

I have been at this Egil site, during my Lutheran humanitarian mission in Turkish Kurdistan, but, alas, my translators were unable to add so many details to the hearsay and their anecdotes as I would have liked to know further to the explanatory texts variously in Turkish and Arabic, apart from a then still relatively recent Turkish newspaper report (about weirdly frightening physical and psychic phenomena which were purported to occur upon an attempt to open one of the sarcophagi), posted there at the time of my visit there in the mid-1990s, but which were able to confirm to me some of what is there, the most certain being the presence of St. Joanna in one of the ground graves. Their humble graves thus are unlike the two Old Testament figures and a post-Quranic saint or two buried within the sarcophagi in the modest Islamic worship structure itself at Egil. Certainly, that is, if the holy ground graves at Egil include that of St. Mary Magdalene and possibly others reputed to be in the Talpiot tomb, so that the lore about Egil is right, then the reports about the Talpiot tomb, especially as this concerns St. Mary Magdalene, would turn out to be false.

Anyway, Cameron's documentary with Simcha Jacobovici is an interesting one and deserves more than merely instant dismissal. I need to find out more for myself! However, although there is further and better work to be done defending Christian claims (which I believe to be the truth) with apologetics that face head-on those issues about the Talpiot tomb with which Ankerberg and his team do not deal sufficiently or convincingly enough.

Curious to pursue this subject further, I've ordered one book already on the subject from Amazon, since I am finding that the Ankerberg video is rather too shallow and lacking in substance on this issue to be of much help, and I also have put aside some other tomes on the subject to order later on. Ankerberg tends at critical points  often to argue theologically against the evidence of the Talpiot tomb; he does not rise quite fully to the challenge and to the need to address more of the archaeological evidence from antiquity that supports or, hopefully, that may invalidate the claims made for the Talpiot burial site. Ankerberg thus essentially shirks or approches too glibly some aspects, although certainly not all, of the real issue. Christianity is an historical religion and if archaeology, early documentation, and other such evidence seriously can undermines its claims, then the whole structure collapses, no matter how cunningly crafted is the theology that has arisen from it. Thankfully, there is unlikely to be any need for such a collapse, but Ankerberg and others need to continue research and apologetics about these discoveries and developments.

Ankerberg's videos on the subject of the Talpiot tomb do a good job at examining logical implications of and for Christian views and of many of the dubious assumptions which participants express in Cameron's documentary. However, this exercise of logic, in Ankerberg's videos on the subject, is useful only up to a point, after which archaeology and documentary explorations of the question really need to be examined afresh, without taking too much for granted at the outset, or by too patly refusing to examine anew, the entire validity of what the New Testament text (even keeping in mind how solidly historical its writings are), has to say on these matters. This is not to say that the N.T. is defective; it is just that, as always in apologetics, that assumption needs to be opened and to be defended by one side, contested by another, as it pertains to what the N.T. writings have to say about Jesus' burial and resurrection. I am very interested in finding out how others (whose conclusions would be less pre-determined in advance than those of Ankerberg's somewhat ""triumphalising"" apologetics apparently are). I wish to react to ""The Lost Tomb of Jesus"" and to the archaeological finds that motivated that video's release on the basis of yet more than these videos provide.

I can think, unaided, of several matters for which the exercise of logic, or the undue reliance upon it divorced from other lines of inquiry, on Ankerberg's part could be quite flawed. Mentioning too many of them in the context of a review would lead to inappropriate length; this already is quite lengthy! To take one example, however, as reasonable as it may seem, as Ankerberg argues, that Jesus' family surely would have maintained a tomb in Nazareth, there is no evidence for such a burial site there of which I am aware, whereas the Talbiot tomb, as possible physical evidence indeed does exist, however inconveniently for apologists such as Ankerberg and those around him. For that matter, the Talpiot tomb is far closer to Bethlehem, the town of origin of Jesus' ancestors, which is situated close to al-Quds (Jerusalem). The identities of those ancestors are traceable, on the family sides both of Joseph and of Mary, for many centuries. How long had the family been living and working in Nazareth, anyway? Long enough really, one has to wonder, to have set up a family tomb there?

There is even more on this aspect of the controversy that bears stating and investigating, but I shall refrain from protracting the like here, except for one further such observation of what should be obvious. Another objection of Ankerberg's team is that some names on the ossuaries in the Talpiot tomb are not listed as among Jesus' forbears and contempories in the family in known geneologies. The obvious problem with this objection is that there would have been family members, past and then-present, in Bethlehem, Nazareth, and perhaps elsewhere in ancient Palestine, such as aunts, uncles, or cousins, who would not be directly among Jesus' most direct ancestors and family if shown on the kind of more uncomplicated ""family tree"" diagramme (such as one would find in combining the simple paternal and maternal family geneologies of Jesus found in two of the N.T. Gospels). Such forbears of Jesus still could have been related to Him within His extended family, and hence likely to be found in a family tomb.

As a Lutheran pastor, of long years in the ministry and of solidly Confessional convictions and a good mind, once cautioned inquirers, ""Keep your powder dry!"" (as in gunpowder, of course) in such a disquieting controversy, which is part of spiritual warfare; face the issues candidly and be prepared for further skirmishes and battles. Ankerberg and his team advise, basically, that same patience and caution, albeit in less colourful and less strong wording as that of the old Lutheran pastor. A Christian, or any other inquirer, for that matter, should not capitulate to the first alarming counter-proposition to Christian claims that comes along, even to one that seems so well grounded, at first glance, as the work of Cameron's team seems to be; nor should one so react to any others which come along after that first experience, for that matter. One must examine such phenomena such as the Jesus family tomb patiently, taking in the evidence and exerting thought to consider it from all angles, before forming some working conclusion, which, in such a profoundly significant matter, would be a stance that would affect the very values by which to live one's very life.

These are preliminary observations. I hope to return to this review, perhaps even several times more than already, after I have learned more, to improve or even, within reason, to amplify it. John Ankerberg has given my Christian faith a boost of confidence, just as I had come so recently to encounter Cameron's and Jacobovici's disturbing and, as it has turned out, not totally reliable findings, tenuously riddled with ""special pleading"" explanations, as they present what the artifacts, to them, seem to attest. While I wish to learn more about the issues that theTalpiot tomb raises, Ankerberg's videos and DVD do provide a strong beginning to do just that.",1443312000,,17681,5.089279558772837
