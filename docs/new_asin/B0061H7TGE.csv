8490840,5,B0061H7TGE,"Beautiful pictorial of a time-era gone by. The romantic age of lavishly built mansions along the coast of New England by US wealthy. It can't take the place of actually seeing these places, but some of them are not open to the public, so it is the best you can do. Well worth the money

If you are interested in the mansions, this DVD describes the interior, exterior, occupants, and how they were built. The photography is amazing, and allows you to take a closer look than the tours. If you've ever been in the Breakers, the famous Vanderbilt home, it's too overwhelming to take it all in as you're inside, and the DVD is a helpful resource.",1369612800,,643,4.4491525423728815
