7970930,5,B00006JU7C,"Yusuke Urameshi is a high school delinquent. He doesn't go to class, and he's always getting in fights. One day he is trying to save a boy that is about to be hit by a car, he is killed instead. He is approached by a pretty girl flying on a broom. Her name is Botan, and she's the Grimm Reaper. She offers him a chance to regain his life. After coming back to life Yusuke becomes a Spirit Detective. He gain spiritual powers and hunts down rogue apparitions that cause trouble for the living world. He is joined by his friend Kuwabara, the demons Hiei and Kurama. Together they fight off the deadly demons that seek to destroy the world.

After causing so much trouble among the demons Yusuke and the others are ""invited"" to fight in a demon world tournament. They realize that the previous winners are the Toguro brothers that they beat in the previous case. The problem is, they faked losing before and are far more powerful and evil than they can imagine.

This is a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time. It has a bit of a Dragonball Z vibe to it, and everyone likes that. I highly recommend Yu Yu Hakusho to every anime fan, it's simply amazing.",1353110400,,1546,4.273037542662116
7970931,5,B00006JU7C,"As the Dark Tournament continues, Yusuke and the rest of Team Urameshi find themselves locked in a desperate struggle against the deadly Team Rokuyukai, a band of demons that redefine pain, torture and treachery.

With his team on the verge of defeat, Yusuke springs into action and faces off with Rokuyukai's most prized fighter, Chu, in the most bizarre batle of Yusuke's Life! But how far will these team captains go to win? And at what cost?",1168905600,,445,4.779220779220779
7970932,5,B00006JU7C,"Great anime but they disappoint me so. I won't tell you really why but over all it was great. Tell the end of this tape. I would give it like four but it deserves so much more than that, So you are still my favorite anime of all times. Come on I thought this ANIME SEREIS WAS SUPPOSE TO BE DIFFERENT, THAN OTHER ANIME. Ok it has some great twists and creative plots. But it ended like I hope it didn't. Anyways it was still heart warming and to see Yusuke finally getting somewhere with his power and in touch with his emotions. Kuwabara starts to show his powers of sight & he has a great sense of honor in him. I would give his life for a stranger. Hiei thinks Kuwabara is stupid for his honor of a man. In away Hiei also admires it, but he will never say.
 Hiei and Kurama don't not fight in this battle. They was ambushed by the other team. So Yusuke, Kuwabara, and the mask fighter must fight on their own, with out the help of the demon allies. Kurama is so smart and so handsome, Hiei is so damn cute.
Yusuke is a smart mouth from HELL. I love that dudes personality.
There are 4 complete Episodes on this tape.
33).A Day in Waiting
34).Percentage of Victory.
35).Glimpse Beneath the Mask
36).Ambition Destroyed: A Trial of Light
But In the end this is a series that should collected. I have tape so far of what they released and still collecting them.
That's it for now. See Ya.
YU YU HAKUSHO SO RULES.",1049241600,,1410,4.202952029520295
7970933,5,B00006JU7C,"Ok now yusuke and the others are forced
to fight in a dark tournament, against the
most powerful demons all around the underworld.
The first fight the Rokuyukai Team. The first
episode finshes up with Kurbara's fight with one
of fighters from Rokuyukai's Team. You should see
what happens, it's very surprizing. Then Kurama
starts to fight with a treachery demon that is
no match for Kurama, but why is Kurama not
fighting back. Then Hiei fights the supposed
leader of the Rokuyukai""s Team. But Hiei uses
a attack that seems to made himself injured.
Then the really good battle begins with
Yusuke and the real leader of the Rokuyukai Team.
 His name is Chu. He my seem like a crazy but don't
late that fool you, he is very strong and dangerous.
In the last episode with Yusuke and Chu, they both
 use up all their spirit energy and now must fight
with only their fist. It is great ending for this
volume to see this great battle. A+++++ ON THIS GET SERIES.
YU YU HAKUSHO IS THE FAR OUT BEST ANIME I HAVE EVER SEEN.",1046217600,3,1014,4.4171122994652405
7970934,5,B00006JU7C,"Hello once again. This is still great anime. Why give it four stars cause it leaves you hanging when it desevres so much more than that. I know for a fact you can tell who is the 5th fighter, if not your dumb. But this anime is planned out. It makes you want more. Not alot of anime does that so it is very rare to find something like this.

  It shows more Hiei & Kurama. It'S about the Yu Yu Hakusho team enters a  Dark tourament run by the criminal world. There will be great battles ahead. So I ask you please don't give up on this anime. It is well worth the wait for the next tape. Kurama is such a hottie & so is Hiei to be short. I like mysteries guys that keep my intention. Just like this anime.
Later Yu Yu Hakusho Fans.
GO YU YU HAKUSHO THE BEST ANIME OF THE CENTURY!",1042070400,,779,3.911392405063291
7970935,4,B00006JU7C,"I love to watch Yu Yu Hakusho.  This movie was one of the best.  Yusuke and his friends enter a competition run by the criminal world and fought by the most ferocious demons they have yet to encounter.  I rated this 4 stars out of 5, because the show leaves you hanging at the end.  It's a let down, that it stops just when you're at the very edge of your seat waiting to see what happens.  It is a good movie though, don't get me wrong.  I loved it.  I can't wait till it till the next one comes out!  But until then I guess I just have to keep hanging.=)",1041724800,,556,3.9017857142857144
