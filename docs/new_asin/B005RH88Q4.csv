The Technicolor print is gorgeous,the story -a lot of nonsense but who cares- and the acting:adequate enough to move the story(such as it is) along. Now that Universal has sprung ""Gypsy Wildcat"" from oblivion,we await with great anticipation the Universal Vault Series releases of ""Sudan"" and the peerless ""Cobra Woman"",about which Pauline Kael,the late,great film critic for The New Yorker magazine wrote: ""....One of the world's worst...Don't miss it.""

Universal - U.S.A.

DIRECTOR:

Roy William Neill

CAST:

Nigel Bruce, Leo Carrillo, Jon Hall, Gale Sondergaard, Peter Coe, Maria Montez (As: Carla)

COMMENTS:

The action revolves around a group of gypsies wrongly imprisoned for the murder of a count. Dumbrille portrays the wicked baron who actually commits the crime and then pins it on the gypsies.

Hall is the baron's messenger, who knows the gypsies are innocent and sets out to prove it. He notices gypsy dancer Carla (Maria Montez) wearing a pendant with the dead man's coat of arms and discovers she is really the count's long lost sister and rightful heir to the throne.

When Hall accuses Dumbrille of the crime, he is thrown into the dungeon with the gypsies. But they join forces, overpower the guards, and escape. Montez, who had already promised to marry the baron in return for the freedom of her people, is then abducted by Dumbrille. But Hall returns to save the day, killing the baron and winning the heart of Montez.

In this movie appeared Leo Carrillo as Anube, Carla's foster father, he was known with the role of Pancho in the TV series of the 50's THE CISCO KID.",1344470400,2,1220,4.729857819905213

8484290,4,B005RH88Q4,"Of course Montez' best performance and best film were one and the same, ""Cobra Woman"".  I feel this is her second best performance, and that alone makes it worth watching.  (I feel that ""Ali Baba"" or ""Arabian Nights"" or ""The Exile"" are better films, but she is not the focus of them, she merely elevates the few scenes where she appears.)  It's great to see her outside of her usual desert or south seas setting, albeit with many of her usual co-stars in tow.  I love to see her act defiant, rather than the usual mysterious.",1422576000,3,525,4.4375
8484291,3,B005RH88Q4,Maria Montez's beauty and charisma compensates for the film's yesteryear hokey quality. Ojala! that there were more women in today's films like the late and great Ms Montez.,1422489600,,173,5.214285714285714
