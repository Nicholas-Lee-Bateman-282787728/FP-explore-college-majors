""full house is still funny today and the episode quality on dvd is better then tv and the commentary is the best what would be great is if full house did a renuion special maybe abc will do it I would like that as well""

2722468,4,B000M341RS,"2004...

A year that will live on as one that produced some of the most polarized, non-sequiter Television shows to date. A year, that took the phrase ""Mayor's Office!"" from a unuttered declaration to a one of the most beloved (and hated) phrases known to Adult Swim viewerrs everywhere.

Tom Goes To The Mayor has got to be one of the most intriguing TV shows I've seen in a long long while, if not because it's so different! It's mix of (occasionally) delightfully tasteless, many times alkward, but always funny humor places the phrase ""You either love it, or you hate it) to a new tier. The plot of the whole series is pretty much the same throughout. Tom goes to the mayor, pitches and idea, and all hell breaks loose. But, while this may sound like a theme that would get stale by the third episode, TGTTM manages to keep it fresh with their humerously wacky, wonderfully demented, and just plain ""What the hell?"" elements.

Many people, for those reasons, hate this show. In a world where Aqua Teen Hunger Force is the farthest many people are willing to go for polarized humor, Tom Goes To The Mayor often takes it just a little too far, boarderlining on Monty Python-esque humor. (In one episode, a Monkey jumps out of an Eclair.) For many, seeing a monkey leap out of a giant eclair is just too much for their conformist brains to handle. Even for us that enjoy the series, it does sometimes make our (mine anyway) brains itch. But it's all in good fun! This DVD collection is the ultimate for any Tom fans out there (mainly because it's the whole TGTTM world in a three disc set). For people who don't like the Tom Goes to the Mayor series, then for god's sake, don't get it! Go find an old theme park to rebuild, just to burn to the ground, or solve the issue of child safety by employing bear traps, but if you hate the series, then don't get these DVDs. More for us fans! ;)",1168473600,22,1888,4.404011461318052
2722469,5,B000M341RS,"Tom Goes to the Mayor is pretty much what the plot synopsis says here. Tom goes to the Mayor, and pitches an idea ranging from terrible, to mildly bad, to mediorce. The Mayor takes this idea and makes it worst. Hillarity ensues. It might sound boring, and repetitive on paper, but thanks to the wild, and creepy imaginations of Tim, and Eric, the creators, plus some truly sick writers, the show is great.

It's definitely not a show for everyone, but what TV show is for everyone? If you like surreal humor, and awkward situations that involve a bumbling Mayor, and an incredibly naieve idiot, you'll like this.",1167696000,40,612,4.666666666666667

I wish I had read these review before I went ahead and bought this, but I do seem to be a bit luckier as only like 4 episodes or so won't play and everyone else seems to have it worse.

This series aired prior to Tim & Eric's Awesome Show Great Job!
I bought this since I own almost everything Tim & Eric have ever made.
Unfortunately, I was only able to watch a dozen or so episodes.
The first disc was unrecognizable to my Blu-ray player, the second disc played half the episodes but no special features, the third disc was the same - tricky to get to play, skips like a skip-it, only plays half the episodes and no special features will play.
As I've stated, I own almost all of Tim & Eric's other shows/movies and was excited to add this series to my collection.
All the other T&E shows I've bought from Amazon work great.
Imagine how depressed I am to have purchased this great show only to be denied watching it.
It is so inexpensive to purchase that it'll cost about the same (in postage, gasoline and time) to ship it back to Amazon for an exchange, that, after reading other reviews, will probably work just as poorly, so it is not worth the hassle.
It reminds me of B'Owl - perfect for throwing away.

I sent this back and received a new one. Same type of problems as before. I won't get into everything that was wrong. The point is that the DVDs were experiencing problems once again. *Wouldn't play on multiple DVD players (I live in the U.S.), and PS3.

The confluence of insomnia, weird animation, bizarre characters (really, really) and strange plot lines made it impossible at first glance to determine whether it was funny. I actually said outloud, I can't tell if this is funny. As it turns out, it's FUNNY! Tim and Eric have since gone on to commerical success, I suppose, with tours and more shows like ""Awesome Show, Great Job!"" as well as more mainstream collaborations. Despite the volume of work and more recent projects, ""Tom Goes to the Mayor"" still holds a dear spot in my heart, marked with something like a leaky hot dog trophy, or something like that.

The guest characters are never dull or boring. The predicaments and ongoing personal failures of the cast of characters cause them to sink ever-lower throughout the series. By the end, if nothing else, you feel great about yourself, and you're laughing. This show isn't for everyone - I know people who hate it - so it's difficult to applaud and recommend something so subjective to innumerable strangers on amazon.com. But, if you like weird humor, vaguely adult situations, uncomfortable implications, awkward absurdist innuendo, and an every-man, do-it-yourself production quality that screams ""made in the basement while we were high"" this so is your show. I should know, I bought it twice.",1348531200,5,1494,4.952191235059761

He always goes to the Mayor telling him his ideas for the town, but the Mayor keeps tweaking them and causes the idea to backfire. The Mayor is so selfish and hilarious. He never recognizes Tom at the beginning of each episode. If you're a hardcore Tim & Eric fan, you'll love TOM GOES TO THE MAYOR!!!",1332115200,,477,4.139784946236559

2722651,5,B000M341RS,"A persistent delusion among ordinary Americans is that they can singlehandedly transform their ideas & pluck into a path to riches, or at least subsistence. Despite being coerced and humiliated daily by a corporate-controlled system of intrusive marketing tactics, state complicity & and a continuous fleecing by all involved, Americans in large measure still accept the preposterous precepts of pop Libertarianism, the clandestine essence of which is merciless social Darwinism. In Tom Goes to the Mayor, these delusions are just as mercilessly autopsied and found nauseatingly necrotic to their core.

The setting is precise: a small city, ""Jefferton"", located at the interchange of two Interstates, according to the paper placemat at the local ""Gulliver's"" seen briefly in the opening credits. Its charms are listed in the theme song: Community Spirit! Shopping! Food! What ""community spirit"" exists in Jefferton, however, is simply there to nourish the tepid commerce comprising the ""shopping"" and ""food"". The central character, Tom, is a gutted victim of postmodern social collapse: unemployed, of course; maxed out on his cards; behind in every payment he is responsible for; trapped in the second marriage of a morbidly obese ogress with fat, snarling diabetic brats; his brain infected with self-help & business-press aphorisms that make his utterances sound like hackneyed PowerPoint presentations half the time. The forces he confronts are personified in the twisted lunatic Mayor whom he must petition in each episode.

Tom is compelled by his circumstances to try and lever every lame & insipid entrepreneurial idea he can think of into some sort of cash flow. These attempts fail utterly in every instance, each time surreally illustrating another absurd aspect of postindustrial life in the US. There is no respite, no comfort, and absolutely no success available to Tom--the game is brazenly rigged against him at every juncture. The Mayor is a cryptic imp in Tom's perdition, a tempter and tormentor egging Tom forward from force-fed false hope to brutal disillusionment.

But Tom's despair is our edification: the show acidly flays the counterfeit affirmations of American capitalism's ideological face and lays bare its banal teeth and claws. Excellent cultural critique of America in the new millenium.",1305504000,42,2321,5.459610027855153

There was one episode where Tom did get mad, but otherwise, he is Jefferton's whipping child.

A year later I caught the infamous ""Rats off to ya!"" episode and I was amused enough to buy the DVD.

Superficially and in passing this show does not seem to have a whole lot of substance. Give it a couple more episodes and pay attention to all the little details. Tim and Eric can make you laugh with a facial expression or an awkward pause.",1228780800,2,587,4.2792792792792795

The great thing about this show is that even if you don't like a particular episode all that much, it's only about 12 minutes long, and you are then ready to try a new one.

A lot of people just don't ""get"" this type of humor, and for that reason, this show (as well as ""Mr. Show"") just never had mass appeal. On the other hand, ""My Name is Earl"" is a hit, so that shows you what constitutes as ""comedy"" to many people.

I can't add much to Paul Gaita's appraisal, but this is the most often-watched DVD set I own. TGTTM is groundbreaking stuff... Look at the premise: A born loser makes goofy proposals to an insane bureaucrat, who distorts them to his own end. I know, this happens every day in real life, too. But who would have thought to make a cartoon series about it?

And the unique style of the animation, with its quick cuts between character expressions and movements is hilarious in its own right. (See - Tom: ""I've had a very... FRUSTRATING DAY""; and the Mayor: ""Vehicular Manslaughter - FIRST DEGREE"" for choice examples of this.)

If you look at the people doing really funny things today, most of them (David Cross, Michael Cera, John C. Reilly, Fred Willard, Zach Galifianakis) have gotten involved with T&E. You will be shocked and amazed by all the cameos, but there is a reason they want to do the show; it's a chance to experiment with weird ideas and see what humor you can produce from them. Each episode of TGTTM is a journey, sometimes too weird to really be funny, leaving you just scratching your head. But when they pay off, it makes you feel lucky to have watched it, as it really is blazing new territories in humor. It's weird, irreverent humor that has always existed between friends and in the periphery, but only now becoming more mainstream.

After watching just a few of the shows I completely fell in love with it. Jefferson is a dismal little place filled with power lines and made out of cinder blocks with a huge man made lake in the center. Apparently the man made lake houses many forms of life such as dolphins and sea serpents who live off of ""Cabbage and Sea Corn"". Jeffertonians eat some very exotic foods like Mini Sausages in Clear Gravy and my favorite Pine Scent Puddins and Brackish Water Dip.

If you don't think ""Spicy Shrimp Urinal Cakes"" and a Cinder block Zoo that used to imprision Indians and Homosexuals isn't funny, then Tom Goes to the Mayor may be a little Low-Brow for you. I myself want to live in Jefferton, People just can't have enough power lines in their lives. Cinder Blocks are cool too.

There is nothing wrong with being unconventional but you still have to be entertaining and that is where Tom Goes to the Mayor fails.",1175040000,14,485,4.329670329670329
