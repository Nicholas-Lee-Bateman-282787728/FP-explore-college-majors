6339649,4,B00J9BUFK6,"It is a very attractive and informative travel documentry about brazil. For some reason, it is lacking in the ""Palin power"". Appeared more like the Globe Trekker Series rather than the Michael Palin Series. Too much background commentry made it more difficult to understand and decreased Michael Palin's personal touch. But still worth possessing.",1403654400,5,347,5.444444444444445

6339652,3,B00J9BUFK6,"Mixed feelings on this dvd.  I found the narrator to be very clever and funny--the dvd is very informative and not to be watched as a travel video but more as an informational tabloid of Brazil.  There are long segments that stand alone--like the Amazon piece that takes one into the camp of indigenous, primitive peoples who live deep in the Amazon.  There is a segment on Rio, takes you onto the beach and into the slums--but also took us into a brothel and the movie became a bit more than PG13 in its content.  I was showing this to a group of elderly people and we were not a little shocked!",1442620800,3,596,4.294642857142857

6339657,5,B00J9BUFK6,"I have seen an increase in the number of Portuguese speaking people from Brazil in my neck of the woods the Northeast so I was interested in getting to know more about Brazil. The BBC is known for this type of educational documentaries and Brazil by Michael Palin is a good example to provide good insight into the country.
I found this DVD has a great overall view of Brazils history and takes you on an interesting tour of all the areas of the country. It can be labeled a sightseeing tour with about 40 minutes spent in each area of the country. DVD has great footage, nice commentary by Michael Plain and educational. This DVD is a good starting point for someone looking to cover the bases about Brazil I recommend you purchase it for the overview analysis.",1421625600,3,762,4.489208633093525
6339658,4,B00J9BUFK6,"Fun video.  As always, he manages to show the sides of a country that rarely get coverage.  Always makes me want to go to the places he reviews......",1421020800,,149,4.285714285714286

6339662,5,B00J9BUFK6,"I am hoping this is not the last Palin world travels installment.. that would make me very sad and be a loss for everyone.  As always watching Palin's travels is enjoyable, entertaining while also teaching us a bit about the world we live in especially for those of us not lucky enough to financially be able to travel... for the cost of this package... and the books in his series are much more in depth and also worth the price... we can travel with Michael.
Be sure not to miss this installment of Michael's travels !",1410307200,,520,4.416666666666667

8648882,5,B00J9BUFK6,"Michael Palin's Brazil dvd is a must have and see spcially during this Olympic Year hostd by Brazil.
In addition to watching your favorite games, a side tour around Brazil will more than compensate for
the money spent in going to Brazil.  There is a lot to see, smell, and taste in Brazil not only the
scenic beauty of many places but also the interesting diversity of Brazil's population.  The food
is fantastic and each group of people offer unique flavor in their food preparation.

This Brazil dvd made bu Michael Palin is worth more than 10 times it price.  The minutes spent for
several hours watching this dvd are all entrancing.  Each segment is amazing.  It gives you the
feeling that you are actually touring and experincing places with Michael Palin.  He is not only a
good tour guide, but very entertaining, charming, warm, friendly as well.

I highly recommend owning this DVD and enjoy seeing it several times for every time you see it
you find something new and spectacular.  Get your dvd from this Seller who is prompt, responsible,
and reliable.  Dvd elivery is assured in perfect condition.  I am glad I bought from this Seller.  I
highly recommend her services.  Thank you.

8648884,2,B00J9BUFK6,Focuses on the gaudy big cities of Brazil and the social celebrations. There is a little coverage of the indigenous tribes but it's just not very interesting. This is probably the worst of his travel videos.,1461888000,,207,4.777777777777778
