7871573,5,6304443064,"The Ultimate Batman Collection lives up to its name--three excellent movies for any movie collector.  Batman, Batman Returns, and Batman Forever--great stuff!!  Michael Keaton is in my mind the best Batman I've seen.  He captures the character so well.  Val Kilmer is also quite good, in my opinion.  I think he captures the darkness of Batman very well.  The villains are classic.  Jack Nicholson is funny as the Joker, Michelle Pfeiffer is frightening and just amazing as Catwoman, Danny DeVito is perfect as the Penguin, Tommy Lee Jones is insanely perfect as Two-Face, and Jim Carrey is funny and out there as the Riddler.  Chris O'Donnell does a great assist as Robin in Batman Forever.  Watching each one just makes you want to watch the next one right after!  Indeed, the last movie describes it the best: BATMAN FOREVER!!!  (Might I add that Danny Elfman and Eliot Goldenthal both do great jobs with the musical score, with themes that stay with you long after the movie is over.  Good job, guys!)",1043193600,3,1005,4.812865497076023
