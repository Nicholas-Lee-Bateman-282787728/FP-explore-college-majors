2903179,2,B000TJBNGC,"This was a made for tv remake of a made for tv movie. This actually aired on abc family! which is startling considering some of the themes.
I swear though, i've seen this movie done so many times, or the same plot, what is up with sororities and cults/witches? Eh.
The acting of everyone is great, the script needed a lot of work. I think i've seen the original, i had to look back at a wikipedia of it, but it's been a lot of years since i had, so i think this movie stands on it's own just fine.
The plot is simple, Two twins are dropped off at college by their mom who donates to some sorority, so they already know they will get in, except for  Lindsay, played by Summer Glau, who does an okay job in the role, seriously i love her acting, but this script pulled down everyone with it (including Jennifer Tilly).
So Sarah knows she has powers and stuff, and Lindsay is all like ""be normal! we want to get into a sorority"" and Sarah is all like ""naw, we fine, mom donates to them, let me vouch for a bunch of people who wouldn't normally make it into this sorority because we have power"" or something. Either way, it's boring. There's some interesting moments here and there, but nothing to keep you glued to the screen or questioning what will happen next.",1458432000,2,1260,4.25

2903183,5,B000TJBNGC,"Not exactly Oscar material, but anything with Jennifer Tilly in it is worth watching.  This movie could be called The Initiation of Paint Drying, and if it had Tilly in it I would probably still watch it.  Anyhow, the movie incorporates rival soriety houses and some cult like witchy stuff.  Worth a watch, unless you are not a Jennifer Tilly fan, which in that case, I really don't know what to say to you, because Jennifer Tilly is awesome, so you will probably never find true happiness.",1453593600,2,490,4.609195402298851

2903205,5,B000TJBNGC,"I like the movie but it kept locking up at the very end. I sent the movie back & exchanged it, only to have it lock up again. I even tried it on a couple of different DVD/BluRay players and it still locked up. Too bad as I really enjoyed this moving.",1449187200,,250,3.826923076923077
2903206,3,B000TJBNGC,"OK movie, but it had some holes in it.

Summer Glau was the one, and blonde sister goes to stab a bad witch and it won't work because the knife only cuts the one. But later they say it kills any witch if the ones blood is on it. So why couldn't blonde sister cut the bad witch and it really did have the ones blood on it? Also the ""good"" witch was the one that seduced the blonde witch's boyfriend to be, which wasn't nice. So no one's really good or bad and the rules change.

Also gets tedious when the Doctor sort of puts everyone else in class into a loop so she can have a private conversation with the blonde sister, but after all this supernatural effort, doesn't really tell her much other than she's a stalker creepy weirdo that likes to hint rather than just say things.

Blonde witch had a lot of power early on and kind of forget that she had it or something, which I consider another hole. And if she wasn't the one, where did the power come from?

At the end, I don't really know who was the one. Maybe both sisters were the ""one"", maybe just the powerless whiney sister. Either way, it was kind of stupid.

They had a few stars in it and it was an OK movie, but just OK.",1448409600,,1185,4.068669527896995

2903306,3,B000TJBNGC,"Obviously, this was supposed to be silly and campy. And so it was. But it wasn't really campy enough, and the dialog wasn't sharp enough, and the main character wasn't *anything* enough, and the sisters were entirely too blas about finding out their lives were a lie, and then they wasted about the middle third of the movie not really doing much at all. And the horror wasn't horrible enough either. I suppose we were meant to be unnerved by the big bad witch magically appearing at random, but c'mon. We all knew what was going on there! And then the final fight scene was entirely anti-climactic...

Oh, and if I see one more movie about witches who are draining somebody's life energy to preserve their youth, I'm going to throw up. That's over and done with, screenwriters. Stop already. Come up with a better evil motivation.

On the plus side, it has Summer Glau doing moderately un-Summer Glauish things, which is good. So it's not entirely unwatchable, but you'd probably be better off with a decent episode of CHARMED. Unless you're a really serious Summer Glau fangirl, in which case carry on!",1401926400,,1104,4.715025906735751

2903312,4,B000TJBNGC,Interesting movie to say the least! It is kind of like the paranormal stuff. These two twin sisters go to college and one has super natural powers and so does the president of the sorority. They battle each other. One sorority has powers in her leader also. Some interesting spooky things happen in this movie. I think it was interesting and is worth taking a look at. It had a great story.,1391472000,,390,4.430555555555555

The Alpha Nus are actually an ancient coven of witches using black magic to get what they desire. Sarah must get in touch w/ her inner witch in order to combat these demonic practitioners of eeevil. THE INITIATION OF SARAH is a fun update of the original classic. I especially enjoyed the magnificent Jennifer Tilly (BOUND, RELATIVE EVIL) as Dr. Hunter!

I watched it again and it still lived up to the expectations made a few years ago on ABC Family. Good acting by Mika Boorem and Summer Glau, and it was a cool concept to have Morgan Fairchild star in this remake as well as the original 1984 classic. A good movie to watch around Halloween time.",1352505600,,432,3.9204545454545454

From the opening scene, where mommy walks the girls right to their dorm room, I knew it was going to be a dumbed-down version, and that's fine.  From there, I continued to watch, trying really hard not to look for the old storyline in the new one.  It is in there, hidden behind the sarcasm and dumb jokes.

If you're old enough to have watched the original years ago, you'll probably hate this remake.  If this is your first time seeing The Initiation of Sarah (and you're under 40 years old), I think you'll enjoy it.",1350691200,6,656,4.258064516129032

2903349,5,B000TJBNGC,"A little camp, some good magick and a few unexpected twists make this an occult flick to watch.

Sarah and her twin sister, Lindsey, are headed to college, where their mother has arranged for them to pledge at a snooty, Stepford-like sorority. Both want a fresh start. Sarah's uncontrollable supernatural abilities have made life difficult for the teens, and Sarah's fear of them makes her incredibly vulnerable - though you couldn't tell it from her attitude.

Lindsey is the wannabe. She wants to fit in, to pledge and be accepted in a way she's never been before. Sarah is the rogue, dressing a little grungy (but cute) and not so much into ""fitting in."" They are both sought after by the two oldest Greek organizations on campus. One is their mother's choice, the other is a dark, spooky group known as the Pigs.

Based on a TV movie of the same name, The Initiation of Sarah offers up some cool coven shots and interesting twists. Some of the twists you'll spot right off, but others aren't quite so obvious - depending on how many cult movies you watch. The scenes in the coven's fiery basement digs reminded me of The Mummy. And Morgan Fairchild looked SO good, her skin a little shiny, it made me wonder just how much plastic surgery she's had over the years. (Her hands give away her age.) Girl comment: LUV'd Jennifer Tilly's wardrobe.

I was thankful that a movie appealing to teens did not have a bunch of nudity, slutty costumes, or sex to drive the plot. It would have totally ruined it. (Anyone remember the remake of Night of the Living Dead?) It was way fun to watch Stepford girls go up against the ""normally-dressed"" ones. The funny thing is that Lindsey and Sarah look nothing alike - and no one says anything to them. When you think twins, you think identical, but these girls are anything but. Just thought it was weird they didn't even make a mention that they were fraternal. (Is that the right word?)

The DVD does not offer up a lot of extras, but does allow you subtitles in English or Spanish.

Initiation of Sarah is a rent for a cold night, curled up on the couch with a quilt, popcorn and lots of chocolate.",1316649600,5,2138,4.525906735751295

The movie doesn't have too much gore or sex, and so anyone can watch it.

There are worse ways to waste time on a weekend - it certainly complimented the some pop-corn and lollies we wanted to eat. Sure the characters were cardboard cut-outs of actual people, and sure the hair and clothes were more important then the plot development, but that's okay too. It all stirred together in the pot like a bisque and came out alright in the end. Predictable and shallow but at least it was just enough fun to not matter.",1304812800,,584,4.318181818181818

2903364,4,B000TJBNGC,"This movie was a bit low budget but on the high end of b movie quality. I think it was made for T.V. The acting by most was young, a little poor at a few parts but not that bad over all and Jen Tilly is always great, though her part was small it was crucial. The preppy sister's attitude annoyed me at times, sometimes it was supposed to be that way for the movie, it had more to do with the script than the actress in my opinion. The story is pretty good - two sisters dropped off at college, one pretty and preppy wanna be the other a grungy troubled type. We enter at rush week and as the gilrs pledge we are constantly aware that the movie will be supernatural in nature. Over all it is about magic, good vs. evil, doing the right thing, and the power of sisterly love.
I enjoyed the movie and would recomend the purchase.
Hope that was helpful.",1299888000,2,849,4.089820359281437
2903365,5,B000TJBNGC,I loved this movie it puts together things I love a great sister bond that will surprise you and Magic that will captivate you. I recommend that everyone see this it is considered a Horror but it didn't scare me. I am hard to scare this is a good movie but don't take my word for it watch it yourself.,1289952000,,301,4.033333333333333

2903368,5,B000TJBNGC,"I rented this, and it's one of my new campy witch movies. I just adore Jennifer Tilly, and totally love her wardrobe in this.

This isn't a movie about how sororites or witchraft are, but it's entertaing even so. I think 10 and up could enjoy this, younger kids might not get what's going on.

I have to give it an A, forr all of the fun I had while watching and rewatching it.",1244592000,10,377,4.081081081081081
2903369,4,B000TJBNGC,"This is a campy low budget witch film. Decent acting...campy plot. If you don't expect oscar worthy anything, then you'll enjoy this one. Especially if you and your slightly drunk friends can add witty commentary along the way.",1233705600,22,227,5.0
2903370,1,B000TJBNGC,"This movie was filmed well, and had half way decent actors, effects, and so forth.  But, I thought it was very boring.  If you are a true horror enthusiast like myself, don't waste your money or time.  Honestly, even as a movie (outside of the horror realm) it wasn't that great.  I'm not sure why all the good ratings.  Maybe it's really not all that bad, but it's simply not my thing.  I'm not sure, but this might have been a made for TV movie.  That's kind of what it looked like.  I hardly ever watch one of those and like it.  Watch at your own risk!",1228608000,,556,4.121495327102804
2903371,3,B000TJBNGC,"Not the greatest movie but can't pass up anything with Summer Glau. The movie has a couple of interesting twists towards the end, but never really gets off the ground. The effects are okay but nothing astounding. The movie trys to be ""The Craft"" and ""The Skulls"" at the same time but comes off like an after school movie. There is a lot of familiar faces from tv shows but no one gives a great performance. It's a good popcorn movie you could show anyone, but don't expect any scares.",1210896000,2,484,4.388888888888889
2903372,3,B000TJBNGC,"I loved Summer Glau in FIREFLY, SERENITY and TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES, so when I saw THE INITIATION OF SARAH on Netflix, I decided to give it a try.  (You might say I have a girl crush on her, and you mightn't be wrong.)

The story centers around two competing covens of witches, both set up as rival sororities on the same college campus.  The ""good"" coven is comprised of natural-born witches - those who derive their power from Mother Earth - while the ""bad"" coven must occasionally feed The Eternal Flame with the blood of a very powerful natural-born witch (""The One"") in order to maintain their powers.  Believing newly arrived freshman pledge Sarah (Mika Boorem) to be The One, both sororities try to lure her and her fraternal twin sister, Lindsey (Summer Glau) to their side in the battle between Good and Evil.

THE INITIATION OF SARAH is an entertaining enough flick; a pleasant piece of fluff for those nights when you'd rather sit down with a bowl of Soy Dream and zone out on the couch.  Though it was made for TV - and ABC Family, at that - it's not as cheesy as you'd expect.  Think MEAN GIRLS meets CHARMED, but not quite as satisfying as either.

Oh, and Jennifer Tilly rocks as the magi.  Love me some Jennifer Tilly, too!",1208649600,74,1256,4.522123893805309
2903373,5,B000TJBNGC,"This is a must see movie, mainly because it stars Mika Boorem (Smile), but also because it is well-filmed, has a solid plot, and although it's by ABC family, it's not done in a cheesy Disney-like sort of way. It's a story about the supernatural that is realistic without being over the top.",1200355200,6,290,4.490566037735849

It's a great movie, but I never saw the original.  The DVD is great but for some reason it freezes just before the final scene ends and the credits begin to roll.  Like, it shows Esme then it shows the eternal flame inside the container then the DVD freezes.  I tried fast fowarding quickly and slowly and it doesn't move, except if I go quickly it skips past everything all together.  It's weird how it does that and is fine throughout the entire movie.",1498262400,,600,4.129310344827586

Sarah has some supernatural powers which have frightened her all her life. She has a twin sister named Lindsay. Both of the girls are freshmen in college a and two sororities are after Sarah.. or are they? It's a fun interpretation of the original but the slightly different.
