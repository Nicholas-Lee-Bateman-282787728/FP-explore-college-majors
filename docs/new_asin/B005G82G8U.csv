8471379,5,B005G82G8U,"In a day when talkies were still young and many of them were still being directed as if they were stage plays, ""Sporting Blood"" comes across as a movie that would be made in a much more mature era of Hollywood film.

To start out, much of the acting is very natural. On average, in the early 30s many parts were overacted or stylized. With his first staring vehicle, Clark Gable came across with the easy charisma which would make him THE top male lead for a decade and a top star for 30 years. The stable hands and their families (black actors) are presented in a real and natural manner, avoiding the stereo-typed portrayals which we sometimes unfortunately see in older films. While it is inevitable that some of the delivery comes across in the manner of the era, it doesn't detract from the overall feel of the film.

Despite Gable's contribution, Madge Evans is the real and surprising star of the film, as her role is the most active determining factor in the resolution of the plot's conflicts. She does a solid job of displaying both character growth and determination.

I thought that there was a lot of unusual and possibly innovative camera work. Charles Brabin, the director, got the camera moving in ways I'm not used to seeing in films of that era. There were also several examples of well thought out composition. In one scene two men move into the left edge of a shot and stand talking. Moments later a horse enters from frame right to ""fill in the blank"". It was an imaginative and effective piece of cinematography. In another shot binoculars follow horses around a track, coming to rest on the face of a surprise visitor.

Very importantly, this film looks great. Damage artifacts are minimal, and the black and white picture is sharp and bright. The sound is only slightly muddy in a few places, but for the most part is very clear.

The plot also seems ahead of its time. In a story evoking Black Beauty, where a horse goes through several owners but is only properly appreciated by the first and last, we find several surprising turns. Most of the clichs of early movies are avoided so that I was never completely sure in which direction the story would next go ... and in most movies of that era I can almost predict the next line of dialogue. LOL

As much as I like films of the 30s, I had somehow missed this one until now. It was decidedly a treat.

Highly recommended.",1388620800,3,2396,4.519630484988452
8471380,5,B005G82G8U,"Sporting Blood is a wonderful film. Just as the others say, it does indeed paint a charming, sensitive picture of the horse as a being that deserves love and affection from the people who own it; and the way it shows the horses gathering as a community is beautiful to watch. Sadly, we also see just how cruel humans can be to horses when racing them is all they care about even if it means risking the horse's health to the point where the horse may be unable to race anymore. As for the rest, the acting is very convincing and it's terrific to see how several African-Americans were given real work as actors in this movie; they were not restricted to simply playing the butler who is not very bright. The choreography and cinematography both reflect great forethought and the musical score, while not extensive since this is not a musical, enhances the film as well.

When the action starts, we meet Jim Rellence (Ernest Torrence) who breeds and raises horses to sell them as racing horses or for personal use. However, we also see that Jim loves his horses and that he's not in it purely for the money. In fact, Jim's right hand man on the farm, Uncle Ben (John Larkin), also treats the horses with great affection. However, business has been slow especially with the ongoing economic depression and so Jim reluctantly sells Tommy Boy after Tommy Boy's prize-winning mother falls in the mud and breaks her leg beyond repair.

But the horse doesn't stay with his new owner for long; spoiled Angela ""Angie"" Ludeking (Marie Provost) wants him badly and won't leave her husband Bill alone (Hallam Cooley) until the horse is hers. As it works out, however, the horse changes hands yet again when Bill owes Tip Scanlon (Lew Cody) so much money at Tip's casino that Bill has nothing else to pay off Tip with except Tommy Boy! Once in Tip's hands, Tommy Boy is drugged heavily before each race to make sure that he wins--and this happens dozens and dozens of times.

But there's another plot brewing. Warren ""Rid"" Riddell (Clark Gable) works as a table dealer at Tip's casino; and Rid and Tip's girlfriend Miss ""Missy"" Ruby (Madge Evans) have a thing for each other, to put it mildly. Tip warns Rid and Missy to stay apart but this proves difficult for them to do.  ""Rid"" helps Tip drug the horse but begins to show genuine concern for the poor animal when Tip insists on drugging Tommy Boy perhaps one time too many. Will Tommy Boy win that race? He had better--or else quite a few gangsters who bet on Tommy Boy will be looking for Tip!

There's a lot more still but I'll stop here so you can watch this film and appreciate it as much as I did! In addition, look for J. Farrell MacDonald as MacGuire; Eugene Jackson as Sam; Gertrude Howard as Aunt Glory, Jim Rellence's cook and Bradley Page plays Eddie Frazier.

I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; and people who appreciate well done pre-Code dramas with some genuine sentimentality will not be disappointed. True, Clark Gable may have had top billing and he does do a superb job as ""Rid"" Riddell; but the horses feature very prominently in the picture and it all holds its own very well.",1364428800,3,3161,4.546572934973638
8471381,4,B005G82G8U,In many cases it is hard to go past old time movies with old time actors.  I find almost anything with Clarke Gable in it is generally a good movie.  Sporting Blood is no exception.  This movie should appeal to fans of Clarke Gable and older audiences.,1363996800,,252,4.319148936170213
8471382,4,B005G82G8U,"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) presents ""SPORTING BLOOD"" (1931) (82 min/B&W) -- Starring: Clark Gable, Ernest Torrence, Madge Evans, Lew Cody, Marie Prevost, Hallam Cooley, J. Farrell MacDonald, John Larkin, Eugene Jackson

Directed by Charles Brabin

The plot and story line: -- Gambler Rid Riddell (Clark Gable) wins a racehorse, Tommy Boy, on a bet. Rid consistently wins with the horse in both honestly and dishonestly run races. But before long, Tommy Boy wins a race he wasn't supposed to, and the mob is after Rid.

Good behind the scenes racing story.  The added attraction of a very young Clark Gable in his first top-billed role, with excellent performances by all.

But the best surprise of all is the treatment of the African American characters in the film. Considering the time period, all of the African Americans are treated as intelligent, thinking human beings, not as shuffling minstrel show caricatures.

Black American people who appear as grooms, stable boys, exercise riders are the backbone of the racing industry and they're there also for love of the sport.  They are shown with a range of emotions, humanity, and as having families, which never appears in most films of that time.

A very realistic film about Kentucky thoroughbred raising and racing that includes a large number of black characters including featured players. John Larkin is great as is the direction in general. Madge Evans is truly beautiful. The plot ending is ingenious.

* Special Footnote: -- The horses are represented as having community among themselves, communicating among themselves, and even caring about the fate of other horses. Add to this the remarkable and touching scenes between the stable hands - notably John Larkin and Eugene Jackson, and the horses throughout the film. The breeder is also notably tender hearted.
