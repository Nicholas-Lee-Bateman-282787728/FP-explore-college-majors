4154344,3,B003M5AXMA,"Having grown up on CB and Snoopy, this video is half new cartoon and half cut and splicing in of other peanuts cartoons, which is probably why it isn't shown on tv since the visual and the story are not memorable.  I watched it a couple of times with my kids (who love any peanuts cartoon) but was too disappointed to watch it anymore with them.",1360627200,3,345,4.2272727272727275

4154347,4,B003M5AXMA,"The HE'S YOUR DOG, CHARLIE BROWN DVD includes two Peanuts tv specials, HE'S YOUR DOG, CHARLIE BROWN and LIFE IS A CIRCUS, CHARLIE BROWN.

First airing on tv in 1968, HE'S YOUR DOG, CHARLIE BROWN finds Charlie sending Snoopy off to an obedience camp at the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm so that he will become more obedient. Instead, Snoopy moves in with Peppermint Patty. Snoopy thinks things are better with Peppermint Patty than with Charlie Brown and stays with her. In the meantime, Charlie Brown tries to get his dog back.

LIFE IS A CIRCUS, CHARLIE BROWN first aired on tv in 1980 and is a nice match in theme to HE'S YOUR DOG, CHARLIE BROWN. In this special, Snoopy falls in love with a poodle named Fifi who's a circus dog. Snoopy follows her into the big top and soon becomes a part of the show. The duo become the hit of the big top show. However, Fifi's owner has some plans for the two dogs that makes Snoopy realize that perhaps being a star in show business isn't exactly what he thought it would be.

This DVD also includes the short featurette, ""Snoopy's Home Ice: The Story of the Redwood Empire Ice Arena."" The special really isn't very interesting and is probably the weakest of any of the extra features included on a ""Peanuts"" DVD. It doesn't provide any new information about Peanuts and is really just a featuring showing the Ice Arena that Schulz built (where he ate breakfast at almost everyday).

For those who are unfamiliar with Peanuts, you'll want to watch a different Peanuts DVD first. However, for everyone else, HE'S YOUR DOG, CHARLIE BROWN is a DVD you will probably enjoy watching. It's the first time in the U.S. that LIFE IS A CIRCUS, CHARLIE BROWN has been available on DVD.",1330646400,2,1705,4.543973941368078
4154348,4,B003M5AXMA,"""He's Your Dog"" (1968) is considered the classic on this DVD, but in my opinion the bonus episode, ""Life Is a Circus"" (1980), steals the show. The animation is richer and drawn from a deeper palette than in most Peanuts TV specials (it even won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program), and the calliope-derived music, while not by Vince Guaraldi, really adds to the mood.",1299369600,2,379,4.757575757575758
4154349,4,B003M5AXMA,"I enjoyed this DVD. You could just as well get ""He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown"" already on the ""Peanuts 1960s Collection."" I got this for the bonus feature, ""Life is a Circus, Charlie Brown,"" seeing as I'm starting to doubt an 80s collection will get a release. If you're interested in ice skating (unlike me), you'll enjoy the featurette.",1296691200,2,337,4.728813559322034
4154350,4,B003M5AXMA,"No complaints about the DVD - Our granddaughter loved it when we gave it to her 2 weeks after her birthday party.  The problem was the shipping (3 plus weeks).  Hopefully, Amazon will correct this problem with the supplier.",1296432000,,223,4.6923076923076925
4154351,5,B003M5AXMA,"Another Peanuts special being released. This one was already released in the Peanuts 1960's Collection DVD set which I own and highly recommend for those looking to collect all the Peanut specials in nicely done chronological sets. This particular release is aimed more at the parent market and the die hard fan market. Parents will buy it for children possibly without realizing there is a much better priced set available and Die Hard fans will buy this for the supposed remastering of the episode and the new special feature included.

This DVD Includes:

The Peanuts Special -- He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown

In this classic special from 1968 Charlie Brown sends Snoopy away to puppy boot camp but Snoopy instead finds his way to the home of Peppermint Patty. While Snoopy adapts to the new lifestyle and wonders if he is better off with a new owner Charlie Brown tries to get his dog back. Meanwhile Peppermint Patty develops her own issues with Snoopy's stay and decides to put the beagle to work.

A Bonus Peanuts Special -- Life is  A Circus, Charlie Brown

This special from 1980 fits well with the main special on this release. In this special Snoopy joins the circus only to find a life of showbusiness is harder than it seems.

and a new Bonus Featurette -- Snoopy's Home Ice: The Story of the Redwood Empire Ice Arena

Video is Full Frame, Audio is available in English and Spanish. Subtitles are available in English, French and Spanish.

This set is fine for parents or for collectors but I still have to suggest the Peanuts: 1960's Collection as being of better value and collecting more content. I also recommend to parents who may not be in the know, Peanuts: 1970's Collection Vol. 1 and Peanuts: 1970's Collection Vol. 2. They also have a lot more content for much better value. Hope this was helpful, thanks.

4154353,5,B003M5AXMA,"I absolutely love Charlie Brown cartoons. It may be because when I was a kid cartoons were a bit different than they are today. My parents didn't have to worry about what colorful new word I would learn on Charlie Brown because there were no colorful words. The only violence associated with this cartoon could be the Red Baron flights and they are really not violent but if someone wanted to be particular they could classify it as such.
I order as many Charlie Brown DVDs as I can find that I don't already have. During the holidays when we are stuck in due to weather/snow/ice, I torment my children and make them sit through Charlie Brown Holiday episodes with me. After the first couple times they finally admitted it wasn't so bad. Charlie Brown Thanksgiving is my ultimate favorite Charlie Brown.
I know these are considered old cartoons in todays society but I recommend these silly/old cartoons to families to provide good wholesome cartoons for their children to watch.",1467158400,,979,4.764705882352941

Friendship and loyalty come out on top in Hes Your Dog, Charlie Brown. And you will, too, with this Remastered Deluxe Edition with Improved Picture and Audio
