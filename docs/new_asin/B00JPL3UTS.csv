8652872,3,B00JPL3UTS,These shows are complete shows but it isn't the Crack Up experience I had hoped for.  Better off just watching the promotional out take clips shown on TV to sell you this product.  The highlights of comedy skits are too far and in between for me to watch all the way through. Devoted fans of the show will still probably like to see the shows just for the memories alone if nothing else. --- Rick Blaine or Monsieur Rick of rottentomatoes.com fame.,1454716800,,448,4.451219512195122
