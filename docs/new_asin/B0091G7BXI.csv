5241715,4,B0091G7BXI,"Really what more needs said. I liked a few better than others but it would be very subjective. My least favorite was the remake of the Poseidon Adventure. My favorite was storm. The others were ones I will watch again when I need my disaster fix. for a set to have on hand to watch with just about anyone except small children, it is a keeper.",1392681600,,343,4.212121212121212
5241716,4,B0091G7BXI,"there older movies but I liked them,  have seen most of them on TV  but I watch them again I am a disaster fan.",1387324800,2,111,3.5833333333333335
5241717,5,B0091G7BXI,"this is a great set! great tv movie the president's plane is missing with Buddy Ebsen and many great tv actors.
the Poseidon adventure with Rutger Hauer! never heard of it! I haven't watched all but these two are worth
the price. They don't make great movies with great actors like this anymore.
update: 2 of the movies are tv classics! one is a sci-fy! movie which is pretty
much what you get from sci-fy movies nowdays and a pretty bad tbs movie with luke
perry called the TRiangle! I tried watching when it first aired didn't finish. I
tried watching again didn't finish! but the other four are still worth the price!",1374105600,6,620,4.495575221238938
5241718,4,B0091G7BXI,"With three quite solid made for television films, and three decent ones, this is a great bargain. The President's Plane is Missing,  The Poseidon Adventure and Death Flight are performed by established television (and some film) stars and actors, with the latter two presenting versions of Very Big Hollywood successes. The remaining three are less ambitious and pretty much of the B picture, routine but watchable type. The first type can easily be the center of an evenings viewing, while the second will easily fit the slot of a second feature when you want something to watch while  gradually readying for a night's sleep. I do not have the enthusiasts television set but on a relatively new one of moderate size all the films looked good.",1372723200,6,743,4.888888888888889
5241719,5,B0091G7BXI,"Took a chance on this DVD hoping ""Death Flight"" included in the release was the 1977 ABC-TV movie.  Good News, it does have this great ""bad"" TV-movie starring Robert Reed, Doug McClure, Tina Louise, Bert Convy, Peter Graves, Burgess Meredith, Brock Peteres, George Maharis, Martin Milner, Susan Strasberg, and more.  The cut of the film is not the one shown on American network television,brief nudity is included in one scene.  Transfer is 4x3 and looks pretty good.  Great to have a legit DVD of this movie!",1360108800,12,509,4.883720930232558

5241721,3,B0091G7BXI,This is a set of lot older movies granted ive never seen them they weren't bad overall. Just prob won't watch ever again. for the price wasn't bad for them.,1414972800,,156,4.233333333333333
5241722,2,B0091G7BXI,This collection was good for the era they portrayed and the special effects where top notch for the level of technology at that time.,1406592000,,133,4.583333333333333

5241724,3,B0091G7BXI,I got this as a gift for someone and they liked it. I was a little disappointed that the Poseidon Adventure was not the original movie but this version was good.,1402272000,,161,4.225806451612903
5241725,4,B0091G7BXI,"I bought this collection of six disaster movies primarily to get my hands on one - ""The President's Plane is Missing"", a made-for-TV movie based on the novel by Robert Serling and starrring Peter Graves as a reporter to determine a mystery involving the crash of Air Force One.  Although I read the novel many years ago, I had never seen the movie before I got this collection, and it was well worth the wait.  This slice of the 70s is pretty faithful to the book, and it provides some great before-they-were stars turns from folks like James Sikking (who played Doogie Howser's dad) and John Amos (who played James Evans, Sr., on ""Good Times"").  For that movie alone, the collection earns four stars.

As to the other movies in this set, ""Death Flight"", another made-for-TV drama from the 70s, is also pretty good.  TV veterans like Robert Reed, Tina Louise, Martin Milner, and Brock Peters head up a cast that includes up-and-coming stars John DeLancie (Q from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"") and Billy Crystal (""Forget Paris"") on the ill-fated promotional flight of a supersonic jet airliner.  And ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is the Hallmark Channel incarnation of Paul Gallico's classic story, with some changes that go against the grain of the source material.  If you can overlook how this variant of SS Poseidon winds up getting capsized, you might actually enjoy this movie.",1401926400,,1381,4.8760683760683765
5241726,5,B0091G7BXI,"Got a love back to basics not so great acting and the somewhat funny special effects. But I love the old school disaster movies and love to watch them over and over. These movies are like therapy for me after a long day and I need a break from reality. You need to suspend your perception of reality, just sit back relax and enjoy the story.",1401667200,,341,4.181818181818182
5241727,3,B0091G7BXI,Six 'B' grade TV movies that are worth it if you're into enjoying those kinds of films.  Only two discs so the movies are crammed on there 3 to a disk and none are offered in widescreen.  I know some of them were shot in the old 4x3.  None the less the price is right for six films of modest quality and a couple of surprises raising themselves up to almost 'A' level.  And you can see and hear them well enough.  So if you want this kind of entertainment at this price and know what you're getting...then go for it!!!,1399852800,,518,4.089108910891089
5241728,3,B0091G7BXI,"I ordered this set because Death Flight was listed as being on it.  It was missing at least 2 movies on the set, so I returned it for a refund.",1396396800,,143,3.7666666666666666
5241729,4,B0091G7BXI,Most B - disaster movie fans will probably enjoy this set. There were 1 or 2 of the movies I was not impressed with but for the price most of them are fun.,1394409600,,155,3.727272727272727

8534119,2,B0091G7BXI,"6 disasters movies on 2 discs. Let me re-cap that: 6 crappy disaster movies on 2 discs. I ordered it because I had recently seen an old TV thriller called ""The Horror at 37,000 feet"" and while browsing through Amazon found this B movieset extravaganza. And more interestingly, found 2 TV thrillers set on an airplane included in the box. Those two old TV movies were average at best. The rest was lame. You get 2 (yes TWO) Luke Perry films. You get a TV reworking of ""The Poseidon Adventure"" that's nearly 3 hours long, of stupid people doing stupid things. Couldn't continue with the last film ""2103: The Deadly Wake"". So I watched 5 movies in a weekend and often asked myself: ""What and why did I buy this? Is this what my life has become?"". I'm watching B flicks practically the entire saturday and sunday morning.

As for the quality, I was surprised it looked all right on a 22 inch LED TV connected to a 10 year old region free DVD player with Euroscart connection. It did freeze my DVD player once. But other that that, I was expecting VHS like quality but it was better than that. I can't give this more than 2 stars. At least 3 of the movies can be enjoyed in the right mind-set. I would rate them as follows from best to worst: 1. President's plane is Missing 2. Death Flight 3. Poseidon Adventure 4. Triangle 5. Storm 6. 2103: Deadly Wake, I only endured 20 minutes of the last title.",1426377600,,1395,4.365384615384615
