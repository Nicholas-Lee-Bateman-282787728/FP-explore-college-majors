1643757,5,B00005Q2YX,"Brighty of the Grand Canyon is an exciting family film for children of all ages...including Mom and Dad.  A timless classic filmed on location in the Grand Canyon and based upon the best selling book by award winning author Margurite Henry.
A warm and loving tale of a free spirited burro ""Brighty"" and his best friends.  Shown first to my Children years ago and now  that is available in DVD I purchased copies for each of my grandchildren and they also fell in love with ""Brighty"".

A great adventure story, beautifully photographed with wonderfull music.  ""You'll love Brighty""",1047600000,12,580,4.877551020408164

1643796,5,B00005Q2YX,I love this movie.  My friend worked in the Grand Canyon one summer with the mule ride and she introduced this movie to me about 15 years ago.  I don't know how I missed seeing it at the movies in the 1960's.  The acting is wonderful and a really good story with a good amount of action.  It kept my attention from start to finish.  The scenery was beautiful and I loved Brighty!,1379289600,,379,4.136986301369863
1643797,2,B00005Q2YX,"The scenery and the burro are wonderful.  But the cougar hunt is not fun or exciting to watch, and there is a violent murder scene.  I'm SO glad I watched it before giving it to my sister and her kids.  I won't be sending it on to them!",1376870400,,236,3.875

1643824,5,B00005Q2YX,"Very good movie, but maybe not appropriate for children under age of 12. There are some incidents that would be tragic and shocking to a younger child. Not as 'cutesy' as the cover may suggest it to be.",1305590400,,202,4.342105263157895
1643825,5,B00005Q2YX,"I remember seeing this when i was a kid on a double bill with peter pan.  Brighty is great.  wonderful story, fine acting and Bighty is a real charmer.  just as good as any Disney live action animal film.",1269820800,,204,4.17948717948718
1643826,4,B00005Q2YX,"After a recent trip to the Grand Canyon, this movie was a pleasant surprise--capturing much of the beauty of the Canyon. It's a predictable tale, but nothing offensive and just a ""feel good"" movie. The scenery is worth the price, along with bonus narrative of how the movie was filmed. Recommend as light entertainment with beautiful scenery.",1152316800,5,342,5.017543859649122
1643827,5,B00005Q2YX,"I purchased this for my grandson aged 8, his interest at this time is in mules and donkeys and he just loved it, it is the usual childrens story happy, sad then everything turns out well. I enjoyed watching it with him.",1128038400,7,219,4.238095238095238
1643828,2,B00005Q2YX,"Brighty (played by Jiggs, who belonged to the renowned children's author, Marguerite Henry) is a wily burro who lives and works in the Grand Canyon. In the movie he helps an old prospector (Dick Foran) find gold, but the true story of Brighty is actually much more entertaining: The famous burro lived in the canyon from approximately 1892 until 1922,and locals gave him the name Bright Angel after the creek that flowed into the Canyon from the North Rim. He spent summers carrying water from the creek to the tourist areas, and patiently gave ""pony rides."" Read the book instead, unless you are a diehard burro fan and just want to see the cute little guy.

1643829,5,B00005Q2YX,"This is a classic family adventure that was all shot in and around the Grand Canyon, with a great cast of actors. The photography alone is worth the price! The DVD has a number of extra content chapters, including a interview with the producer, which details the production logistics involved in shooting a feature film in the canyon. Brighty and some of the characters in the film are based on real historical people and events at the turn of the 19th century, in fact there is a life size bronze statue of Brighty at the south rim that was donated by the producer. A true timeless tale shot in the Disney fashion!",1098230400,10,615,4.5

7949567,5,B00005Q2YX,"I saw this when I was a child and told my kids about it. They thought it sounded so stupid and old fashioned that they made jokes about the donkey Brighty. They did not want me to search for the movie. Many years later (kids are adults in graduate school), I found Brighty for sale on AMazon and bought it. We were all together one New Years and I put on the movie and made them watch it. Much to their surprise they really liked it. Yes it is corny at spots but it is a nice film. Now they want to watch it every year!!!  Get it for your kids - it more for young kids. It is a nice story with a good ending with great scenery.",1483833600,,627,3.86046511627907
