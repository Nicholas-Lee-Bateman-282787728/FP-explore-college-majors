8072999,5,B000A2X8LQ,"This is not your typical ""kill shot hunting video"".  Shockey is an obviously extremely experienced hunter, specializing in muzzle loading and archery hunts. Please note that the muzzle loading rifle Shockey uses takes over a minute to reload, so he has no choice but to be extremely careful with his shots. He hunts in a true wilderness area of Canada, which is worth the price of the video in itself. The archers who Shockey hunts with are real experts. Shockey is not the least bit afraid and is always in control of the situation even when facing a huge grizzly at less than 25 yards- an extremely dangerous situation.

I spent 2 years in Newfoundland and never got to hunt moose with a gun, but did get to hunt them with a camera many times. I find Shockeys interaction with the animals are true to life and my own direct experience with them. Only on a couple of occasions did I dare get so close them as Shockey- and when I did, I made sure that I had a stout tree nearby. I actually learned quite a bit from this video.

Shockey is a bit of a ham, and definately promotes his business. I find him very much in line with a rural Canadian sense of humor. Frankly, I like the guy and if I could afford it, I would hunt with him. After all, he is a Master Hunting Guide.",1301961600,,1273,4.273858921161826
8073000,1,B000A2X8LQ,"I ordered this and it's a flick about Moose Hunting in Canada... the only simularity to the 60's t.v. series is the title! I'll keep checking back but as long as it's a ""Stoney-Wolf Productions"" product, it is NOT the movie you're looking for.",1137974400,11,243,4.545454545454546
8073001,1,B000A2X8LQ,"This has to be a short documentary (listed at IMDB)! Not the 1968 TV series which aired for 2 years by the same name. I keep track of TV series on DVD, and the show/series has not been released yet.

Again, this title, being associated with other science fiction TV series, IS NOT THE TV SHOW!",1137715200,20,293,4.232142857142857
