7688832,5,B01CQOVHKY,This is a great set for such a low price! Picture quality is pretty good as well is the sound. Marlene Dietrich is such an amazing actress and this set gives you just a little taste of some of her best work.,1463616000,11,207,3.9523809523809526

7688836,5,B01CQOVHKY,"These excellent films from the 30s show Marlene Dietrich in her pure form as misunderstand adulteress that you can't help but love. A great introduction to this mysterious and compelling woman.

No special features.",1505692800,,215,5.323529411764706
7688837,5,B01CQOVHKY,"Great selection of Dietrich's films; it's amazing how good the images and sound are on these discs considering how old the originals of the films are. Highly recommend it for Dietrich fans, particularly for the curious but very good pairing of Dietrich and a very young John Wayne on Seven Sinners.",1504396800,2,298,4.862745098039215

7688840,5,B01CQOVHKY,"Surprising good, old fashioned at best, but I am a fan of Miss Dietrich. Seven Sinners pure Hollywood, as all the others, but fun to watch.",1494201600,3,139,4.384615384615385
7688841,5,B01CQOVHKY,"I mainly bought this set for ""Desire"" and ""Angel"" because I didn't have great copies of either. Classic film fans can't go wrong with the price for these delightful Dietrich movies. Each showcases her worldly sophistication, intelligence, beauty, talent and unique glamour. Desire is a charming and fun pair up with Marlene and Gary Cooper, Blonde Venus an exciting pre-code drama with fun costumes and numbers. Seven Sinners, a fun drama on a small South Pacific island with Marlene as a sassy nightclub singer, and performing her famous number in the Navy uniform. Angel is a more subtle but intense romantic drama. This set doesn't have fancy packaging but for $2.50 per movie, so worth it! :-)",1483833600,9,697,4.965811965811966

8753882,5,B01CQOVHKY,She was very classic.  I think that she could have expanded her career with the right director.  She had a lot of talent,1533859200,,120,4.173913043478261

8753884,5,B01CQOVHKY,"An eclectic selection of four superb Marlene Dietrich movies. I especially liked the movie ""Blonde Venus"" in which Ms. Dietrich performs songs in three languages: English, French and German. What a super star!",1529366400,,209,5.363636363636363
8753885,1,B01CQOVHKY,Only one of the four movies was I able to play. Not what I expected for my purchase.,1526774400,,84,3.7222222222222223

8753887,4,B01CQOVHKY,Watched the first movie Marlene (and Josef) made in Hollywood. A great pointer to the future Marlene. To a modern audience the story drags. But it;'s a great period piece ands for a 1930 print it's pretty good.,1518652800,,210,4.552631578947368
8753888,5,B01CQOVHKY,"Great collection of some of Dietrich's greatest films.  ""Blonde Venus"" with the famous ""Hot VooDoo"" number is also interesting because it's Cary Grant's first leading role and was also based on a story ""Mother Love"" Dietrich wrote herself and then charged the studio 4K to use.  A bit rich since they paid her around 150K for to act in the movie.  ""Blonde Venus"" represents the perfection of the cabaret singer persona von Sternberg created for her in ""The Blue Angel"" and ""Morocco"" (both NOT in this collection). ""Desire"" is a more fluffy comedy written to capitalize on the Gary Cooper/Marlene Dietrich affair which was common knowledge at the time.  Unusually filmed on location in Spain and France it's also notable because Dietrich could not drive but appears to be ""driving"" in several scenes. ""Desire"" was also supposed to be John Gilbert's return to the movies until he dies suddenly of a heart attack.  ""Angel"" is maybe the only Ernst Lubitsch comedy to bomb at the box office effectively killing the first phase of her career. Except for representing the kind of childish sexuality of the 1930s as well as a very strange pretend England manor house with giant picture windows in the breakfast room it's hard to watch. Dietrich is good but no one can rescue this script.  ""Seven Sinners"" the first of 3 with Wayne, represents Dietrich at her comic and erotic best.  Standby for a scene where Dietrich is sitting in a window seat and Wayne hops on right next to her.  They're practically in bed together although they are fully dressed!  Wayne does a standup job as a light comic foil in a movie shot before the release of ""Stagecoach"" made him a star.  Dietrich herself approved Wayne for the part telling the director ""Daddy, buy me that.""",1515110400,,1749,4.780730897009967
8753889,5,B01CQOVHKY,These movies are great! Very nice film and sound quality for such a bargain priced DVD set. Great value for quality films - highly recommended.,1514592000,2,143,4.76
