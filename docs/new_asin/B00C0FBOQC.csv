8576025,4,B00C0FBOQC,"The lead (Kimura Takuya) plays a successful salesman who, suddenly, loses everything--job, apartment, money--and ends up learning how to survive, first homeless, then as a boarder in a house full of quirky tenants and two cute kids (who teach him how to beg/find/get his boarding daily fee). But the story goes deeper. The hero is a person of good character, and the conspiracy against him comes from a high source (the president of his former company, who we know early has issues with our hero beyond jealousy). Others become embroiled in the plot against the lead, but friendships are formed, talents emerge and synergize, and our hero develops a network of work and friendship that teaches all the characters something about themselves and the higher values of life, which ain't money and corporate success.

A lovely, fun, funny drama. Kimura Takuya has great appeal on the screen, and they've teamed him with a very good cast. The kids are adorable. The ending a bit odd, but oh so appropriate. I hope there's a second season.",1367020800,,1032,4.897142857142857
