7741068,5,B01EX1AAGA,"I've always been a big fan of James Horner's music & was really looking forward to finally seeing a world class symphony perform some of his best tunes live.  The Vienna symphony definitely did not disappoint & many of his compositions sounded exactly like they do on the movie soundtracks.  Star Trek 2 was absolutely thrilling to hear live & gave me goosebumps.  Other highlights were: Braveheart, Avatar, An American Tail which was sung by Deborah Cox and a medley which contained Aliens, Apollo 13 & Rocketeer.  It was also great to see Horner sitting in the crowd with his wife & see his reactions to his own songs being performed to him.  He often teared up & so did I knowing that this would be his last public appearance before his untimely death in 2015.  But despite the sadness of knowing his eventual fate, this is still a joyful experience & a great tribute to one of the greatest & most prolific movie composers of all time. The icing on the cake is an hour long interview that Horner gave to a group of aspiring composers & music fans (in Vienna) about his creative process.  He is very candid & introspective throughout the interview & his funny stories about working with Jim Cameron are worth the price of admission alone.

If I have any criticisms of this film (and they are few) it is that I have seen a low quality tv version of this concert online where video clips from the movies were shown while the various themes were being played but in this Blu-ray they were all removed & replaced with CGI art on the projection screen.  For example, instead of showing the Enterprise flying thru space, they showed a generic planet & stars. They are beautiful images but it would've been much nicer to see the film clips instead so that they could add to the emotional impact of the music.  But the music is so masterfully played, it's barely missed.

And even though i'm a big fan of John Williams & like some of the other themes, I wish that instead of doing movie themes non-related to Horner, they had just dedicated the entire show to him instead.  This show was really about honoring him & Horner has a vast catalog (Over 100 themes).  It would've been amazing to hear more selections from movies like: Cocoon, Field of Dreams, Glory, Sneakers & Star Trek 3 which are some of his very best themes.  But what they did do here was absolutely terrific & should still please most Horner fans.

Anyway, this is Highly recommended & I still give it 5 stars.",1471824000,3,2471,4.50896860986547
7741069,5,B01EX1AAGA,I don't write many reviews but I really wanted to share my impression so more people could enjoy this. The performance and sound are incredible. The setlist is also amazing with beautiful themes like the Gattaca music that I was surprised to find it included here. The audio track is superb with a really powerful sound without being strident. The Horner part is also amazing with magic renditions of themes I loved like Braveheart or Legends of the Fall and even versions of themes that were not on my top ten like Titanic but that sound amazing. I see this is a recording of a festival that is held every year. I hope they release more titles like this one as the previous winners of the award are also extraordinary.,1470787200,2,719,4.538461538461538

7741074,5,B01EX1AAGA,"This is a very special release from Varese Sarabande. First, it's a lot of music + a nice booklet for a very reasonable price. Second, the audio and video quality is excellent throughout. Third and most important, this gives viewers a chance to see and hear many of the late James Horner's wonderful film music played beautifully. But beyond all that, this is an emotional ride as well, as many times during this concert, Mr. Horner is seen in cutaway shots wiping tears from his eyes. The combination of brilliantly arranged and conducted music and the sincerity of James Horner himself, coupled with the painful knowledge that he is gone from this world, makes for unforgettable and extremely heartfelt viewing. The feature-length bonus interview is just an added treat to an already fantastic package. I must also add that the non-Horner film music selection that starts off the concert, is in itself wonderful, especially the extended suite from ""Independence Day."" I believe this is a limited edition, so get it while you can. For film music buffs, this is an essential addition to any library.",1467849600,3,1099,4.945945945945946
7741075,5,B01EX1AAGA,"It might not be as magical and emotional as it was on this day in this majestic concert hall but it gets very close.
thank you for releasing this unique concert for everyone who was not there. a must for film music enthusiasts!",1467244800,4,227,4.3023255813953485
7741076,5,B01EX1AAGA,"Everything you could hope for from a final James Horner tribute concert.  The concert opens with a few numbers from other composers, showcasing some of the talent of the era, including a fantastic StarTrek compilation, and an incredible arrangement of a soprano-centric soloist piece from A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (Composed by John Williams).  The choir and orchestra do a FANTASTIC job, and David Newman conducts with poise, passion and rigor.  Hearing the James Horner songs, as usual pause your life and send you on a spiritual journey of the heart.. And seeing James Horner react to each one is worth the price of admission... He is so humble, and such a tender hearted person.  The concert is a good length, and has english subtitles for the few announced portions in German (with the exception of one german only announcement toward the beginning).  The audio and visuals are exceptional.  Included on the disk, with as much equally importance to me... James Horner sits down at a public setting to an auditorium full of aspiring composers and film makers to talk about his methods of composing... The audio and video quality is not as good in this segment, but seeing a rare public discussion of Mr. Horner discussing his own music was such a special experience.  He was such a shy and private person, but I'm so glad we were able to catch him in this setting talking about his passion and methods for music composition.  All in all, if you LOVE James Horner Film music, or are interesting in film music composition, or are interested in film music in general, or just want to see a LIVE, caliber orchestral concert from a fantastic Vienna Venue, this disk is for you... No regrets in this purchase... I only wish they included an audio-recording disk as well in the set.  A perfect score from me.",1467158400,9,1809,4.790996784565916

7741083,5,B01EX1AAGA,"Grieving over the tragic news one year ago of the untimely death of Star Trek II and III composer James Horner, fans of the musician poured onto social media to celebrate, lament and share stories of the famed composer. One of those fans just happened to be Varse Sarabandes Robert Townson, who as luck would have it, was able to share a very special career moment in 2013 with Horner at the Hollywood in Vienna concert. While commiserating with fans online, Townson noticed the one sliver of sunshine for everyone was his posts about the concert itself and time he spent with Horner. Thus was born, Hollywood in Vienna: The World of James Horner project.

Townson was in a unique position to produce the Blu-ray concert, as hes done the same for over 1,300 film scores and concerts throughout his career. While he only knew Horner as a professional colleague, Townson was as touched by his music as everyone else and jumped at the opportunity to conduct a symposium with Horner on his creative process and career while in Vienna, in the very same auditorium that his Academy Award winning father Harry Horner worked.

It was a lovely opportunity and one I cherish now, Townson explained. It was the first time he had heard a concert of his film music in a concert hall. One of the services this concert and new Blu-ray give is an almost kind of cathartic experience. Fans get to see James himself reacting to hearing his music performed in a concert hall and experiencing what his music meant to people.

He was so moved by it, Townson continued. The moments throughout the concert, where the camera cut to James experiencing this for the first time, he was tearing up. Seeing that now in light of the tragic events that unfolded is very comforting to people. To whatever degree he knew his work was important before this, in this setting the degree of his extraordinary contribution to the world of music was truly irrefutable.

The 17-track concert Blu-ray, conducted by David Newman, features a track titled Star Trek Suite as well as Horners memorable End Titles to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and other films including Braveheart, Avatar, Titanic, Legends of the Fall and more. In addition, the organizers, including Hollywood In Vienna Director Dr. Sandra Tomek presented Horner with the Max Steiner Film Achievement Award. His moving acceptance speech as well as the above symposium are also included on the Blu-ray release.

In his speech, he said it was the most important moment of his life, when he received the Max Steiner Award, with the audience cheering on their feet, Townson added.

Solitary as so many composers are, sitting alone in quiet rooms, writing music and playing the piano, the notoriously shy Horner always turned down previous invitations to attend concerts or offers of his music being played live. However, when he was approached in 2013, he decided to attend the special event in his honor, which gave him an opportunity to pilgrimage to where his fathers professional career began with Max Reinhardt.

Providing organizers and fans with a rare opportunity to celebrate Horners career, the concert allowed a fitting tribute to his work that spanned three decades, beginning with The Hand in 1981 and prematurely ending with his final feature films in 2015, Wolf Totum, Southpaw and The 33. In between, Horner also wrote film scores for memorable movies such as Cocoon, Field of Dreams, Glory, The Rocketeer, Patriot Games, Apollo 13, and Titanic (for which he won the 1998 Academy Award for Best Score and Best Original Song).

Tabbed by Nicholas Meyer to write the score to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, the then 27-year old composer only had seven previous credits to his name at that point. Dreaming of becoming a classical composer, Horner actually looked down on a career in film scoring; all of which changed with Wrath of Khan. Meyer wanted to distance this new film from the previous Star Trek: The Most Picture, which also meant not reusing any of Jerry Goldsmiths iconic music from the movie.

The film needed a powerful score, Horner explained to Starlog Magazines Tom Sciacca in 1982. The score is designed to help create a feeling of tremendous speed and power for the Enterprise.

Spock never had a theme before, and I wanted to give him a theme to tie the whole of Genesis and Spock by the end of the film, Horner added, so that it would all mean something. The theme for Spock, incidentally, is actually heard at the Leaving Drydock sequence.

Unique in its own way, rather than being compared to the incomparable Goldsmith score, fans embraced Horners music for Star Trek II, which would take its proper place as one of the film series more indelible scores. The composer even has a brief cameo in the film, as a cadet walking the corridors and preparing the Enterprise for its final confrontation with Khan.

Joining the production of Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, Horner believed his Star Trek II gig to be a one-time journey to The Final Frontier. But as fans know all too well now, The Wrath of Khan truly kicked off Star Treks second life.

Initially when I was doing Star Trek II there was no Star Trek III, Horner shared in a 2010 Wrath of Khan Blu-ray featurette interview. Star Trek III got formulated somewhere along the end while we were doing it. I had to change the end of Star Trek II musically, and they changed the cut so that it merged into the beginning of Star Trek III, and it actually held me in very good stead. Star Trek II was really to me, an emotional story between Kirk and Spock and that really paid off in a big way obviously in the next movie. I always look for those types of things in the films I do. Its like a trademark of my writing.

Luckily for fans, his music still lives on, and there is so many varied and unique scores for listeners to choose from throughout his career; from sweeping epics to period pieces to dramatic stories and light features. And now fans can also experience the once in a lifetime event that occurred in 2013 with the Hollywood in Vienna concert thanks to Townson.

Im so happy to have the opportunity to make this tribute to James Horner available as a Blu-ray. It was moving for me, it was moving for him and I know how exciting it is to his fans around the world to be able to experience the concert, Townson concluded. This seemed to be the only light coming through all the sadness (at the time of Horners death). The comments people were making about the concert, how much it meant to them how happy James was at this concert, how much it meant to them to see him being appreciated, and how much it all meant to him. So many people wished they could have been there. I am really thrilled to now be able to share this very special event and celebration of James with his fans around the world. I couldn't be happier how it all turned out.",1476835200,7,6872,4.630541871921182

8759706,5,B01EX1AAGA,"""Hollywood in Vienna: The World of James Horner"" is a 2016 release of a concert recorded in Vienna in 2013, only two years before the tragic passing of James Horner.

About 1 hour and 32 minutes in length, ""The World of James Horner"" is a moving tribute to the composer, who is present during the live concert. The concert consists of two parts, the first of which of is entitled ""On To New Worlds."" This first part contains music from science fiction movie selections that were NOT written by Horner, including music from Metropolis, Star Trek, and Independence Day. Part two of the concert is entitled ""The World of James Horner,"" and consists of music written by Horner that really spans his entire career, from early selections like Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan to more recent films like Avatar. While I enjoyed part one of the concert, I wished the entire concert had been Horner's music. He certainly has written enough great film music over the years to fill up an entire concert.

Filmed in Vienna's historic Konzerthaus, and performed by the ORF Vienna Radio-Symphony Orchestra, the concert is really top-notch. Conducting is famed flim composer David Newman, who is excellent and brings obvious passion and skill to the podium. The video, sound, and editing are all of superior quality. There are also neat computer-generated visuals that come up on the screen during the music, and they serve to add to the atmosphere of the music.

Also included on the disc is a lengthy (over an hour) and rare interview with James Horner, in which he discusses film composition. The intererview is very interesting and detailed, and is a definite bonus. There is also a high-quality booklet included with the Blu-ray disc that includes program notes, bios, credits, and photographs.

Whether a James Horner fan, or just someone looking for a quality performance of great film music, give ""The World of James Horner"" a view. I can guarentee you won't be disappointed by this moving tribute to one of film music's greatest artists.

If you enjoyed this product, I would also recommend the following videos: ""A John Williams Celebration,"" ""Hans Zimmer: Live in Prague,"" and ""Score: A Film Music Documentary.""",1523145600,,2205,4.916666666666667
