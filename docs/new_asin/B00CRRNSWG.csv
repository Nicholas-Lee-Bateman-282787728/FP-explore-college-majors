5735869,1,B00CRRNSWG,Poor acting and not intertaining.,1414713600,,33,5.8
5735870,1,B00CRRNSWG,will not go down in history as my favorite Zombie movie,1414627200,,55,4.090909090909091
5735871,2,B00CRRNSWG,not reall good,1414627200,,14,4.0
5735872,1,B00CRRNSWG,"This movie is pretty much about a bickering ""special mercenary"" unit, rather than zombies.
Taking place in Mexico, the land is desolate, dirt, rocks and not a whole lot else.
If the unit can get over itself and FIND zombies, then this might have been alright.  5 Minutes of zombie interaction,
bickering, squabbling, and lusting over a woman that is sent to investigate the ""corporations"" issues is pretty much ALL it is.
Then arriving, the woman is raped, mercenaries shoot each other, and the movie is over.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!",1398470400,7,542,4.76595744680851
5735873,3,B00CRRNSWG,"So bear that title of this review in mind as I comment.

Despite the overworked theme, the movie remained entertaining. I have found that international workings of this horror genre are fun to watch.",1398124800,2,199,4.852941176470588
5735874,3,B00CRRNSWG,"please note that this is actually a movie from 2011, as noted by IMDB:
[...]
otherwise, a mostly run of the mill low budget zombie flick.",1396569600,2,137,4.3076923076923075
5735875,4,B00CRRNSWG,"Subtitles are often difficult to follow, but I had no problem. This movie was well directed, showing a bleak attempt at rescuing a girl from a fenced area, secured by the military, a girl free of the horrible effects of some sort of disease or failed experiment. I had it figured out pretty soon. Why were so few sent into an area infested with bloodthirsty living dead? It did move rather slowly, but I think the director wanted us to consider all the different personalities of the soldiers and a woman physician. Check it out.",1396396800,2,529,4.578947368421052
5735876,2,B00CRRNSWG,"There was not enough action and viewing in the movie, most of it was about a solider who was hired to get a girl out",1391990400,,116,3.68
5735877,1,B00CRRNSWG,"I can't sit by and watch as garbage like this fools people looking for a hidden gem, there is nothing to see here, same old catsup zombies and home video cameras and ""folks"" giving it 5 stars!",1384300800,4,192,4.216216216216216
5735878,5,B00CRRNSWG,Without having a hollywood tens of millions budget these film makers have put together a very respectable horror/zombie feature. The critics are spot on in that the film brings something to the table. Shot in some remote regions of Chile the film conveys both an 'everyone for themselves' and us vs. zombies survival atmosphere element. It's worth checking out.,1380931200,3,361,5.135593220338983

5735887,2,B00CRRNSWG,"Terrible plot, substitutes cursing for character development...no real point to the whole story, and yet it has pretensions at being philosophical...and one more point...what moron doesn't know by now that you have to shoot zombies in the head to put them down for good? These clowns apparently, because right from the get-go they pour magazine after magazine into the walkers' bodies and get eaten in the end...some guys just can't make a go at anything...jeezy Pete's...",1445126400,,472,5.223684210526316
5735888,1,B00CRRNSWG,overrated!,1444176000,,10,10.0
5735889,2,B00CRRNSWG,"I gave this two stars because it is classic stereotype film culturally.  If you like your conspiracies thick as paste, your military corrupt, violent, hollow and insipid and the ""he dies, she dies, everybody dies"" sort of South of the Border fatalism this movie is just the ticket. The feel and story aptly ape the George Romero ""sensibility"" of ersatz counter culture horror.  Personally it would have been more fun to just have the cast form a circle and shoot in.",1444176000,,466,4.7407407407407405
5735890,1,B00CRRNSWG,"Poorly written, poorly acted, poorly directed. Like a bad independent art house movie. It was completely boring and one of the worst movies I have ever watched. I only finished it because watching seemed better than doing nothing on a cross country flight. And I think I made the wrong choice. Just stay away from this one.",1444176000,,323,4.684210526315789
5735891,1,B00CRRNSWG,Bad. Don't waste your time. B-movie at best.,1444176000,,44,4.625

5735893,3,B00CRRNSWG,Nice.,1440028800,,5,5.0
5735894,3,B00CRRNSWG,"Enough action to keep ones interest. It's always fun to see how film makers in other countries, in this case Chile (don't know how the other reviewer assumed Mexico), interprets the zombie trope.  There doesn't seem to be a clear explanation of what happened at the mining site to  spawn the out break, or how far beyond the borders of this unnamed country to which it extends. The guarded frontier seems to indicate a level of containment.

The bickering among the mercs, and lack of control on the part of the leader, Col. Rainoff, leads to a breakdown of unit cohesion, and ultimately, bad luck for this team sent into the contamination zone to collect ""scientific data"". It appears that our colonel has his own agenda, and is willing to sacrifice anything and anyone to achieve it.

CG blood splatter works OK. Good combat scenes, with a realistic level of intensity and chaos.  There are some plot holes and reality gaffs such as the scientists who don't seem to be doing any science during their journey, or who seem to lack even a pen with which to sign the log book at the frontier entrance. Or that the shooters never seem to change magazines or run empty.

Production values seem good. Effective use of desolate terrain, abandoned structures. Dialog seems crisp and effective. I'd recommend this to anyone interested in films of this genre.",1438819200,,1350,4.747863247863248

8585376,2,B00CRRNSWG,"Zombie Dawn gets two or two and a half stars from me for being low-budget and making an effort. About a mission of mercenary soldiers in South America heading for a showdown with a zombie horde, it sounded promising enough. But there are problems.

The ""zombies"" here are often hard to see, which is probably on purpose so the audience can't spot the poor or non-existent makeup work.

The violence is often in CGI, and not particularly good CGI at that. Whoever thinks that CGI is the wave of the future for the depiction of gore and violence is going to have to reconsider after some of the scenes in this movie.

Another problem is that ""zombies"" here are too often seen running like joggers and jumping around, which is a terrible turnoff for zombie traditionalists like me.

Still another problem are the poor English subtitles, which are dubiously translated and jumping all over the place so that it's not easy to tell who's saying what, or for that matter WHAT they're trying to say.

But the story is compelling enough, the scenes of people wandering in a deserted landscape while the lead soldier narrates ominously are pretty effective, and the finale is interesting. Let's say two stars for zombie purists like me, two and a half for those who don't mind running CGI-affected zombies. And the filmmakers show some promise and may do better next time.",1485648000,,1362,4.729957805907173
