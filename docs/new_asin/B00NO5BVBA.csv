6673342,5,B00NO5BVBA,Haven't seen yet but I know it will be amazing from what I've hear/read. Hopefully getting from Santa. Free on Axs on 12/25. If you like this look for The Road Home from 1995. Guest is John Paul Jone from Zep.,1416268800,2,209,4.121951219512195

6673354,3,B00NO5BVBA,"Having seen this wonderful show, I was hoping for the complete show. What I got was the 1 hour show they put on AXS tv. The performances were great, but less than complete show lowers my score.",1429228800,,193,4.243243243243243

6673381,1,B00NO5BVBA,"This was the worst Christmas show ever!  I'm a HUGE Heart fan and was hugely disappointed. Very little Christmas songs, it was slow and when they finally broke into some of their classic Heart, the tempo was off.  I'd really like my money back on this blu-ray.",1419033600,,260,4.51063829787234

6673385,3,B00NO5BVBA,I had hoped to hear my favorite group singing heartfelt Christmas songs.  Very little Christmas music.  Very little Heart.  Almost no Annie Wilson.  I watched it once.  Probably won't watch it again.,1418601600,2,199,5.09375
6673391,5,B00NO5BVBA,"The queens of Rock present a lovely Christmas show filled with family, friends and excellent music. This was an entertaining television event that we will enjoy watching year after year. The entire band filled the air with holiday joy! The Heart organization is a well oiled machine and never put out a bad product whether it's a concert, CD, book or TV show. Miles High Productions did a great job promoting this event as well as all their events. Chip Shultzman and crew should be commended for their marketing of a super group who still deliver excellent music and live theatre.",1418083200,2,581,4.762376237623762
