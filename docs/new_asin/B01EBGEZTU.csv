8758303,5,B01EBGEZTU,"The Sentinel - Season 4 brings together a collection of events and actions that culminate in the revelation of Jim's special abilities. It causes a great deal of problems for the police department, Blair  at  Ranier, and Jim himself when the newspapers hound the pair, making it almost impossible for the Sentinel to do his job. The release of Blair's thesis by his mother up ends the deep bond between Guide and Sentinel-causing more mayhem.
Each and every action packed episode brings the viewer to the series finale- The Sentinel by Blair Sandburg.. This final episode fills the viewer with sadness, feelings of loss , and finally, a sense of joy for the Ellison/Sandburg team. I cried watching this episode-I wanted more of this team of unique individuals!!! This Season  4 is well worth the viewing-!!!!!  Settle into a confortable chair and get set for a wild ride to the finale!!!!",1505520000,,888,4.860927152317881
