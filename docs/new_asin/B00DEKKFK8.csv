8592523,5,B00DEKKFK8,"I love these work outs for staying in shape.  They are fun, and build coordination while getting you fit.  Gilad is enthusiastic and funny.  He clearly found his life's calling.",1401926400,,177,4.833333333333333
8592524,5,B00DEKKFK8,I love Gilad! They may not be a difficult workout but they are nice if you are short on time or you are not for a tough workout. I used to watch these on tv all the time and I'm so glad they are on DVD now.,1400284800,,206,3.404255319148936
8592525,5,B00DEKKFK8,I have purchased 4 other Gilad DVD's but this is my favorite so far. All 3 workouts are challenging if you give it full effort. Some others DVD's have to much focus on amateurs and bystanders coming into the workout. That to me was a distraction. This is focused and at times intense. The bicycle kick abs are a killer and the inner thigh stuff leaves me SORE. I think you will enjoy the great mountain top scenery and the workout routines. Enjoy!,1381276800,2,447,4.397590361445783
8592526,2,B00DEKKFK8,"I purchased Ala Moana Beach, Pupukea and Makapu cliff and these are definitely produced many many years ago (20 years ago maybe?).  Personally, I think they are outdated and I am disappointed because I had thought I was purchasing CURRENT Gilad productions as the production date says 2013.  This is not the case.  I see the fine print on these says they are digitally remastered from series over the last 30 years but I think this should have been declared clearly.  Be warned!",1381190400,7,478,4.72289156626506
