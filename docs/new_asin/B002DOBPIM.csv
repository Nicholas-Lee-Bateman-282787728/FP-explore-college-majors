8365609,5,B002DOBPIM,"I watched this movie out a feeling of nostalgia for Estonia (where I lived for a year and a half) and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's very dark and bleak, in fact I'm not sure I would call it a comedy at all, but the moments when it makes you laugh are truly something memorable. The fact that it's fully shot in a specific neighbourhood and you never get to see the beautiful Old Town and city centre of Tallinn adds up to the feeling of claustrophobia and hopelessness. I agree it's not a 'easy' movie, but it is a really interesting and memorable movie. Also the soundtrack is fantastic.",1481673600,,588,4.3545454545454545
8365610,5,B002DOBPIM,"Automatically comes with English subtitles. First watched it in Estonia a few years ago, and now I'm able to share it with those around me. It's a great movie. It's like the Estonian Magnolia, you follow many people's stories (without the raining frogs).",1428364800,2,254,4.930232558139535
