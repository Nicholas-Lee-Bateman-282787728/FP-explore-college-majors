4665092,4,B005E7SF7O,"Do you need fancy technical effects to have a good Pirate movie?  Nope, not at all, sometimes the old TECHNICOLOR is best",1391472000,3,121,4.5
4665093,3,B005E7SF7O,This movie was made in vivid color and done with lots of sea action shots. There is a good romantic plot as well as good old fashion revenge. The story is not the most logical but it is not that important to the fun and action as well as the action that takes place on the pirate ship.,1390953600,,285,3.9310344827586206
4665094,4,B005E7SF7O,"RAIDERS OF THE SEVEN SEAS (1953, directed, produced, and co-written by Sidney Salkow) is mistitled in one respect: we get just one sea in the film, which follows Caribbean pirates and their exploits, lives and loves. It's an update of the Tyrone Power-Maureen O'Hara classic, THE BLACK SWAN (1942), and prefigures the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN trilogy in offering a model for Elizabeth Swann in the role played by Donna Reed, an Oscar winner as best supporting actress in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY the same year. Reed is at her best, as is the dashing John Payne, a more mature lead than most in this genre. He hit the gym sufficiently to acquit himself well in several outfits baring his chest, and he's athletic in fights--some with swords, some with fists. The dialogue is arch, but that goes in '50s pics where people write with feathers. The music is obvious in cueing audience response, but that too is common. The film is strong in all technical categories, with a sharp use of color (costumes help in that regard). The supporting cast is uniformly good, with fine character work by Lon Chaney, Jr., as a one-legged sidekick (basically the role Thomas Mitchell had in THE BLACK SWAN). The film wraps in under 90 minutes, and the pace never drags. The reason I don't give it five stars is that the film has no themes; it just offers entertainment for the viewer's time. But it offers entertainment in spades, so I recommend it to pirate film fans. Thanks to MGM for this 2011 Limited Edition Collection DVD (the original feature was distributed by United Artists).",1360540800,6,1565,4.736263736263736
4665095,4,B005E7SF7O,"""Raiders of the Seven Seas"" is a far better film than it has any right to be.  Who ever would think of John Payne and Donna Reed as dashing swashbuckling leads?  Yet, they are both very game and acquit themselves admirably in this enjoyable picture.

John Payne, who is no doubt best known for ""A Miracle on 34th Street"", plays the dread pirate Barbarossa (Red Beard), erstwhile corsair for the Sultan, now harrier of the Caribbean.  Well, he's not so dread, really rather a softy, especially with the ladies, but dire enough to his enemies.  After fleeing Arabia his arrival in Tortuga coincides with his falling for the haughty Contessa Alida (Donna Reed), and they spend much of the film sparring in denial of their love, while getting in and out of swashbuckling scrapes.

There are humorous ruses, great sea battles, an attack on Havana, rapier duels, and even at 90 minutes a tight script that keeps the story moving along apace.  Gerald Mohr as Salcedo plays a wonderfully despicable and treacherous villain, and all the cast (including Lon Chaney as the lovable Peg Leg) perform well.  ""Raiders of the Seven Seas"" makes me wish that John Payne and Donna Reed had made more swashbucklers, for this is a solid addition to the pirate film genre.

As with all the pricey ""Limited Edition Collection"" DVD-Rs put out by the big studios, this MGM release is bare bones: no special features, simple menu, and chapter stops every ten minutes.  The picture quality is good for this 1953 (non widescreen) Technicolor release, though not as bright as it probably once was, and with a slight bit of damage showing briefly for a few seconds near the end.  The sound is clean.

This DVD is recommended for swashbuckler film aficionados, classic movie buffs, and fans of the stars, John Payne and Donna Reed.  As my brother used to say, ""Do you like to have a good time?  Then you'll like this.""",1338595200,19,1887,4.713414634146342

4665112,5,B005E7SF7O,"Where else can you find sword fights, a romantic story, and arrogance coming out on the losing side. Historical accuracy be damned. As movies
of this era often do, it ends with a kiss from the reluctant heroine. In contemporary flicks you would have seen horrific gore and mass murder and the two principals would have had graphic sex throughout the movie. It's amazing how acting and some semblance of a plot can produce an enjoyable movie.",1419724800,,441,4.740259740259741

4665117,5,B005E7SF7O,"John Payne is one of the best actors you hardly hear about!  If you love pirate films this is a must See or own !!!  John Payne has been great in every movie I have seen him in! ""Miracle on 34th street"" introduced him to me but this film turned me into a fan!!!  John Payne sounds like a stage name but a friend told me that was actually his real name. As an actor he can do it all but its in the action films that he really shines!  Whether he is a lawyer saving Santa Clause, a reluctant settler turned spy, a pirate carving his niche in the world or a marine storming the shores of Tripoli John Payne delivers!!!!  I can't believe he isn't more well known! This movie is loosely based on the real life pirate Barbarossa!  Some of the action is based on other true piratical activity's!  If you don't enjoy this action packed high sea's adventure you better check your pulse!  This movie is witty, fun & full of action!  I highly recommend this and many other John Payne films!",1408924800,,979,4.220430107526882

4665124,4,B005E7SF7O,"This was never going to win any Oscars, but it's a lot of good old-fashioned pirate movie fun!

Our hero Barbarossa is extremely self-confident, with lots of buccaneer swagger. He falls for a saucy and spoiled countess he takes for ransom, and sparks fly! He's funny. She's a spitfire. There's even an adorable kid milling around, who is only annoying a very few times. It drags in a few places, but if you love pirate flicks all will be forgiven. This is too much fun to miss!",1394755200,,477,4.482758620689655
4665125,5,B005E7SF7O,"I first viewed this movie as a child whose mind was filled with adventurous pirate action, and it brought back so many flashbacks. This plot is the old story of an unwilling girl eventually connecting with the supposed male lead, the hero of the show with admiration and by falling into his arms. Exactly the point of Cervantes' Don Quijote, the opposite of rescuing the maiden plots by his contemporaries. When all is said and done, Raiders of the Seven Seas like many of its contemporaries is a superb example of a family viewing, though death by sword play and minor violence, it is free of today's full R-rated graphics--anyway, these are my thoughts and opinions.",1394668800,,668,4.767241379310345
