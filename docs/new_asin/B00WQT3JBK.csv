8713955,4,B00WQT3JBK,"For the money, a great video....I like ""hearing his story"", as any fan would. Saw this oringal on a TV special a couple years back. I purchased this for my 8 year old grand daughter who ""adores him"", but not ""old enough to attend a concert, as usually he is performing ""outside"", and the ""environment can get crazy for a young child. Next best thing? this collection of songs & his story.
Now, I do have a ""complaint""...I ordered this Video from Amazon ""weeks ago"". It ""was in stock""....Here I am, ""nervously waiting"" and Hoping it arrives well ""before Christmas 2017"" as it IS a Christmas gift for my sweet grand daughter"". Now, I see on my account page that it ""could be delivered ""between ""Dec. 19 thru January 3rd???? Thats Terrible! I would never had ordered it! Hopefully, it arrives EARLY this week...Come on, Amazon....you can do ""better service THAN THIS!. Why did I ""order it a ""month BEFORE Christmas!",1513468800,,912,4.670807453416149
