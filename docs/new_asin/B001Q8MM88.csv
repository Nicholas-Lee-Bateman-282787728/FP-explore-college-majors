8335182,1,B001Q8MM88,Could not play on American DVD player.  A waste of money.,1516492800,,57,4.181818181818182
8335183,5,B001Q8MM88,I really enjoyed this series.  I guess my only complaint would be that the sets are not clearly defined in order of how they should be viewed.  I had to figure that out for myself and that was a little annoying.  Otherwise...this was a great series and my only disappointment was that there wasn't more to it... I could have watched many more episodes and not have been bored.  I recommend this series for anyone who is interested in the changing trends in health which seems to have started in some ways in England...,1369958400,6,518,4.4787234042553195

8335185,5,B001Q8MM88,"The Dr. Finlay Collection was completely enjoyable.  I would recommend this for your library. I am rewatching the series, as I enjoyed it that much. Annette Crosbie playing the dutiful Janet MacPherson and Ian Bannen playing Dr. Alexnder Cameron are the backbone of this series.  Wonderful characters, as is the leading role of Dr. John Finlay played by David Rintoul. On another note, thank you for the way the series is packaged: in a wooden box, all five DVD's, very protected. Well Done.",1340150400,4,491,4.903614457831325
8335186,5,B001Q8MM88,"I love this set,I was watching it on our local tv station and it was taken off. So my hubby bought this set for me. I allow 1hr each afternoon to watch it,and I would recomend it to all who love the English shows. My friends are waiting for me to finish it, as I will loan it to  each of them.
  A really great set.

8335187,5,B001Q8MM88,"I absolutely love this series.  The acting is wonderful, snd life in a small Scottish town believable.  Ian Bannen was great, and what can I say about David Rintoul...divine acting and great looks. I will be watching it many times over.  The only negative is the lack of subtitles.  This is my favorite Christmas purchase from me to me.",1323648000,6,336,4.6440677966101696
8335188,4,B001Q8MM88,"I love the Doctor Finlay series.  But I am disappointed that the series on DVD, including the Complete Collection, is not closed captioned.",1294185600,7,139,5.043478260869565
8335189,5,B001Q8MM88,We have become firm friends with the Doctor and the people of Tannochbrae. We do not want to get to the last disk! wonderful portrayals of genuine characters as well as well-crafted drama with focus on issues that do not seem very dated even today. A great series that comes close to the gold standard of Foyle's War.,1249084800,37,317,4.482758620689655
