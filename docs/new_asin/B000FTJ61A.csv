But it should sell for $7.95.  It is overpriced.  It is an inexpensive tv show put on a dvd for resale.  The actual train journey is a 500km and return trip from Bombay to the western coast.  It takes about 4 days.  The trains (the journey uses about 3 or 4 trains) are either old deisel or older steam.  The stops are at local historic tourist spots.  There are about 4 stops.  They are o/k, but not worth the cost of the dvd.  If you want to see nice trains travel from north India at the Himalayas to south India into the tropical jungles and through the variety of interesting countryside and peoples YOU WILL NOT FIND IT HERE.  KEEP LOOKING.",1179360000,2,802,4.302013422818792
