8452448,3,B00519BOVY,"The locations showcased on this DVD are filmed beautifully. Commentary is well done and informing. But the editing of the segments is one of the worst I've seen. First of all, this DVD is entitled ""Unique Island Destinations"", yet features Laos, Czech Republic (2 segments), Kazakhstan, and China none of which are islands and indeed some are land-locked nations. While interesting, these aren't unique islands. Then again, maybe they are islands that are unique in that they aren't islands. The segment on Cuba was totally slaughtered. Looked like someone did a terrible cut and paste job on their computer. It seems to me these segments were part of a larger series that were just picked out to sell to people interested in Islands. But apparently the editors weren't all that up on the definition of Island.",1363996800,2,810,4.963235294117647

8452450,2,B00519BOVY,"Mediocre in every respect. The loud background music is overlaid by an annoying, enthusiastic marketing personality who doesn't have much interesting to say about any location. The cinematography is weak, shots are poorly chosen, and don't demonstrate a theme. It's pretty apparent the crew went to the tourist bureau, went to a couple dozen recommended locations, filmed whatever they found there -- boats, birds, ocean, clouds, etc. One of the ""islands"" is Australia, and another is Czechoslovacia (!)",1358467200,2,503,5.461538461538462
