""The Three Mesquiteers"" was a western series that had three heroes. Rita Cansino leads the list of actors, she plays a cantina entertainer. The story begins at a ""Wild Horse Refuge"". Riders are arrested for entering this area. But they are freed because they have an excuse. A young lady waves to Stony, he leaves to join her. The sheriff and the Three Mesquiteers prevent McGowan and his boys from gaining a small fortune. A young boy uses an air rifle on the street. There is a song in the tavern. There is a fight in the bar. ""O Mighty King of the Wild Horses."" Can they paint a horse and create a stampede to destroy crops? The people want an end to this problem. The sheriff falls and is trampled by that pinto. Tucson is the new sheriff now. Can they use a colt to trap that pinto stallion?

But this wild pinto has never been shod! [If the shoe doesn't fit, you must acquit.] Stony shows his nerve, but the crowd wants a dead horse. Rita dances in the cantina. Elmer preaches at the bar. Rita is told about Stony's financial status. Will she return to New York? Stony decides to free the pinto. He is chased. McGowan has a plan. Stony learns about that black horse. McGowan wants another body as proof of the wild pinto's danger. Can something go wrong with the plan? Lullaby and Tucson arrive to free Stony. McGowan and his boys return for a shoot-out. Can the heroes survive? And capture McGowan's boys? [Yes, even if it is implausible.] At the end Lullaby shows his pig call. But guess what shows up in the Arizona desert?

This is based on a book which argued for saving the wild horses of Arizona. Is that still true today?",1287187200,,1662,4.3896103896103895
