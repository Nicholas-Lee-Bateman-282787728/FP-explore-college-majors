Anybody that knows of others involved in an accident due to street racing would appreciate the value of this film. This film discusses the history & issues behind the sport and lack of involvement from local governments to help such communities make their streets safer. It also discusses the different crowds and culture of the sport, and more.

Check out the trailer for yourself:

This is the REAL stuff, truly and eye opener on this popular sport. If you are a true fan of street racing, this is the film for you. I ordered it a few months back for my hubby. He meets up in LA to race at least twice a month, and I can't keep him out of the garage!! He was very surprised by my purchase, and told me that this was the first film he has seen that has depicted the street racing scene as it really is.. he even learned a thing or two himself. We just bought a second copy for his cousin for Christmas.

I recommend this film to anybody who thinks of purchasing it. It is a great buy, at a cheap price and there is NOTHING else like it!!",1292198400,2,1200,4.222707423580786
8644830,5,B003IET0JC,"This is a great film on the subject of street racing...  If you happen to do some inquiring into street racing, you will quickly find that there isn't really any good research or facts out there.  As far as movies are concerned, the only thing out there is:

1) Fast and Furious series (totally fictional)
2) Cheaply made thrown together ""street racing"" DVDs featuring scantily clad women to lure people into buying
3) Thrown together Documentaries made for TV...

None of the above 3 options are adequate if you want real insight and a thorough look at street racing.  This DVD packs a lot of work into 95 minutes!  If you are looking for a DVD with a bunch of drunk and barely clothed woman, this probably isn't for you.... This DVD starts in the 1950's, and takes the viewer through to modern day issues of street racing - the deaths, the lack of tracks, etc..  It is a ""smart film"" - not a cheezy thrown together DVD.

Some people want to see ""samples"" of what they can expect when watching this movie.  For them, I say you can see excerpts from this DVD on YouTube by.....going to YouTube and doing a search for ""street racing documentary"" or ""street racing dvd"".

That way, you can check out the trailer, and some short excerpts before you buy to make sure you will be happy with your purchase and not confused as to what you are buying.

So far, everyone seems very happy with their purchase - I wish there were more reviews on Amazon...

If you go onto YouTube however, you will see from the people that bought and watched the film, that they are very happy with their purchase - many saying that they plan to watch it again and again! :)
