5635946,5,B00BK8E49O,"Kudos to Michael Shanks for his take on the Gordie Howe story. Frankly, I can take or leave hockey, but I found the story well paced and interesting. Shanks really made Gordie likeable and his story worthwhile even to non-hockey fans. Given the amount of violence in hockey, and given Gordie's history, I was at first slow to have the family view this, but the movie depicted it in such a way that everything was still perfectly presentable to the whole family.",1404691200,4,461,4.634146341463414
5635947,5,B00BK8E49O,BUT a great story about a GIANT of a man. It could be an inspiration to anyone:) I think it is follows history pretty closely.,1402358400,,126,4.08
5635948,5,B00BK8E49O,Enjoying movie about Gordie Howe's Hockey career and life.  Very inspirational!  He was a great athlete and someone I always looked up to.  Glad they made this movie to tell his story.,1392940800,,184,4.6875
5635949,5,B00BK8E49O,"This is a GREAT story of probably the best sports figure ever, bar none.  He could play ever position and  his longevity as a player was enormous.",1388880000,2,146,4.37037037037037
5635950,2,B00BK8E49O,"Mediocre acting and often-clumsy writing distracts from what is really a great sports story.  Recommend if it's free streaming but as long as they are charging for it, I'd use your $3.99 or whatever for something else.",1380499200,,218,4.891891891891892
5635951,1,B00BK8E49O,"Bought this for a friend who is a die hard Gordie Howe fan and we watched it together when it was on the movie channel and it was the worst presentation of Gordie.  I should have returned the DVD when I received it as it was on pre-order, sadly I did not.  It does not represent how he lived his life in all details, just some that were not flattering and while he wasn't perfect, he is a legend for the Red Wing Fans and they have to be disappointed also. If you are a Gordie Howe fan do not buy this.  I am not a Gordie Howe fan and I didn't like it.",1374278400,4,552,3.824561403508772
5635952,4,B00BK8E49O,"Pretty factual bio story, well written and acted.  Gordie was quite the star on and off the ice.  Story could have been better with deeper research but ..............we'll take it !",1372723200,,181,4.806451612903226
5635953,4,B00BK8E49O,"I caught this just as it started on of all channels - Lifetime and really liked it.  I love the history of the World Hockey Association (WHA), and have seen the old clips, but to see the Aeros jerseys, the Whalers, the Jets (with Bobby Hull and the pissing contest that they had with each other) Cleveland Crusaders (with accurately depicted with Gerry Cheevers in goal) it was amazing! I thought that it was really well done for a made for TV movie, with a lot of passion.  Andy Mikita does a great job, bringing back 1973.  I'm glad that the Red Wings and the NHL allowed the use of true logos and names (including the Oilers, who originally started off in the WHA).  Even some of the old known stories were included, like when Marty gets drafted after Mark and someone in the room yells...""hey are you going to draft Colleen next?"" (Marty and Mark's mom)  I enjoyed it from start to finish and it is a great story.  I am purchasing this movie when it comes out immediately.  If you like hockey, then you will like this movie",1372464000,6,1027,4.373684210526315
5635954,4,B00BK8E49O,"Most of us were to young to actually see Gordie Howe play. He retired from hockey (NHL) in 1971. Then in 1973 he decided to make his dream come true and play with his sons on the same team.
The movie really shows how strong his wife was....She had the financial smarts and gave Gordie the support he needed (eventually..lol)  You get a closer look at Gordie and the Howe family. It's more than just a hockey movie, it's the true events of the Howe family.
The hockey scene's were ok, wish they could have added a little more hockey into it.
After watching this movie I had much more respect for Gordie...the man and the hockey player.
Overal 4 out 5 stars.  (More hockey scene's would have brought it to a 4.5 of 5 stars)",1370044800,9,721,4.294117647058823

5635992,3,B00BK8E49O,"I got to watch Mr. Hockey just the other night for the very first time and although I am not a hockey fan, found the film quite appealing and interesting. I am not altogether out of touch with the game and do, therefore, recognize one of the greatest names ever to play the game. I may have come in knowing next to nothing about him but I came out the other end appreciating, very much, the type of man, player, husband and father he was and, in my opinion, I think Michael Shanks did a stand-out job portraying Gordie Howe. I cannot however, say much about the production of this film or the bulk of the cast either. Shanks was the only character that completely inhabited his part. Kathleen Robertson was good but far too young for the part of the 40 year old Colleen Howe. In my estimation the production was an unprofessional shambles from the rest of the casting to the direction and writing plus
the clothing, make-up and hair styles of the era in which Gordie joined his sons in signing on with the WHA and the Houston (Howeston) Aeros team in 1973. Colleen Howe looked to be about 22 years of age instead of 40, which she would have been in 1973 having been born in 1933! We first see her in 1973 wearing a pair of gray suede heels designed in the next millennium! An obvious oversight?!?! The make-up used was all wrong for her and she wore an excruciating amount of it for the time. Instead of aging her a bit they made her up as though she were a flawless Barbie type Kewpie doll...and it was a huge mistake! The polyester clothing was particularly bad and out of step, even for the 70's and the fright wigs, especially the one donned by Bobby Hull, were
annoyingly laughable than in any way real. This was film designed to depict one year of his life...the 1973 season. He was only two years out of retirement but was severely out of shape. The thing I didn't quite comprehend was this...Colleen Howe seemed to be an absolute and borderline OCD perfectionist in every way! She ruled Gordie and the entire household with an iron fist and knew every nuance of everyone's life within the family unit. Why she didn't say something to him and why it took so long for it to dawn on Gordie that at age 45 and two years after retirement he could not get away with simply re-signing to play the game again is beyond me. The boys, his teammates, might have clued him in as well but didn't. They were both just OK in their roles but you had absolutely no sense of them as members of that family or as players at all. The daughter was OK too but she was stuck in between
them all somehow. The only other person I can say did well in his role was Howe's former teammate, Bill Dineen, played by Martin Cummins, who ""defected"" to the WHA and who hired Gordie as well as drafted the boys.  Tom Anniko who played Bruce Norris was pretty darned good as well...at least he was good enough to hate for his treatment of Howe after Gordie went to the WHA to join his boys on the ice! Howe is the only player in the history of the game to compete in 6 decades of his life...he last took the ice at about age 70! I think it's a great little film for the sake of nostalgia but for my money, they gave Gordie Howe pretty short shrift! They might have given this icon of hockey a bit better script, story line and a decent production team to get this film done properly.
They only had 14 producers on the film...and was this ever a case of too many cooks spoil the soup! It's worth a watch even if it's only to see Shanks in the role and to learn just a bit about the great Gordie Howe.",1416355200,,3571,4.251470588235295

5635994,4,B00BK8E49O,Having been born in 71 was not lucky enough to see Mr. Hockey play but any hockey fan knows Gordie and what he meant to the game thought it was a pretty good movie love to see the woman behind the man at what sacrifices his family makes for him to play,1416009600,,252,3.8653846153846154
5635995,5,B00BK8E49O,This is a movie that is long overdue. As season ticket holders next to the Aeros bench we saw the difference the Howes made to the team. Shanks did a good job as he did show both the anger when a team took cheap shots at one of his boys. He also showed the lighter side of the family life. My dad moved us down to Texas in the late 50s from Detroit where the Howes were top sports family there. So with all the background information in the movie about how the Red Wings stripped the walls after they all came to Houston was new to me.,1413158400,3,535,3.962962962962963

Some might say it is a little campy but for any true, and I mean true, hockey fan youll love it.

The only drawback for me is how Bobby Orr was portrayed but, perhaps, this is a more accurate depiction of Orr than I would like to think. I wasn't there so I take those parts with a grain of salt but the rest - ENJOY!",1513382400,,534,3.9813084112149535
