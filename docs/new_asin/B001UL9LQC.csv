8344157,5,B001UL9LQC,"I totally agree with the other Amazon buyer, WHY HAVE MARISOL & ROCIO MOVIES IN COMPLETE DVD COLLECTIONS NOT BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO USA CUSTOMERS? We are talking about movies that were made back in the 60's & anyone as a child & grown-ups can relate to. The songs, the dance production numbers and MOST OF ALL THE STORIES OF TRUE INNOCENCE THAT SPEAKS TO THE HEART OF BEEN A CHILD!! THE JOY OF WATCHING THESE MOVIES ON THE BIG SCREEN DURING A MATINEE - I WILL NEVER FORGET!!",1297814400,6,474,4.337078651685394
8344158,5,B001UL9LQC,"Would love to see all of Marisol movies be adapted to region 1.  I can't understand why they have dvd of the silly spanish soap opera they put on TV, but yet have not made Rocio Durcal or Marisol movies available on region 1.",1237852800,15,225,4.113636363636363
