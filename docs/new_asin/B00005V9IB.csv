1673710,4,B00005V9IB,"This is obviously the pilot of the series. It really wasn't bad at all, though obviously totally based on the Highlander series. The special effects could have been better but there was a lot of humor and I liked the characters.
  Unfortunately this is only the pilot movie, the series itself doesn't seem to have been released on dvd yet, which is disapointing.
  You will not find anything scary in this movie at all, and I don't think you are meant to. There is some action, some angst, and some humor though.",1077148800,,512,4.532608695652174
1673711,2,B00005V9IB,"This appeared to be some kind of pilot episode for the series at just under an hour and a half...but far from Lorenzo's best work.  I'm a Lamas fan from back to the Snakeater days, and boy do I miss Renegade! (as cheesy as it was!!) This movie could have used a lot more fight scenes...not nearly as action-packed as some of his older stuff.  It was more or less a new version of the Highlander.  If Lorenzo Lamas wasn't in it...I certainly wouldn't have checked it out.",1016064000,,470,4.318181818181818
1673722,5,B00005V9IB,"I was a huge fan of this show. I thought it was a different kind of show with a lot of promise. I never missed an episode nor did I ever think it was like Highlander (One of my all time favorites). The two shows are so different; how people keep comparing the two is beyond me.

In this show you have the honorable hero(Raphael Cain), his wisecracking sidekick who always gets in trouble(Goodwin), and a parapsychologist who invented a demon-summoning machine(Dr. Sara Beckman). Each episode is filled with action, awesome effects, great writing, and excellent acting. You also get to watch the big storyline (Rafe trying to find his daughter, Kiyomi) unravel with each episode.",1212451200,4,678,4.844827586206897
1673723,1,B00005V9IB,"NO CC or Subtitles!!! I loved this show and couldn't wait to get it. Before opening it, I noticed the companies name and sure enough no CC or subtitles. So am returning it. Why do these companies not provide CC's for the hearing impaired? Do they think we don't like these shows or do they just not care because it less expensive to produce? Am keeping a much closer look before buying from the several companies that do not take into account disabled people. 5 stars for the show no stars for the company.",1203724800,5,506,4.3936170212765955
1673724,3,B00005V9IB,"This show used to come on at 3am in the morning while I was working in my home office and I found myself actually looking forward to it.

Yeah, it's corny, yeah it's light weight, yeah it's kinda dumb, yeah it's a rip-off and yeah it looked like it was made on a budget of $200.00 an episode - but who cares. It was not unlike a lot of those series that ran at the time ""Cleopatra 2525"", ""Xena Warrior Princess"". Come on, those are great works of art???  All these shows are wonderful cheezy TV. And, every once in awhile they actually turned in a really good episode. They tried hard and I lovem' for it.

There are worse things. Check it out!",1183852800,5,644,4.17741935483871
1673725,5,B00005V9IB,Lorenzo Lamas and Dominic Keating are great actors.  I love this movie lots of action.  Dominic Keating was great.,1178928000,,114,4.947368421052632
1673726,5,B00005V9IB,"Why do you Highlander goons want to take shots at Lorenzo?  Everyone knows that the lead character in ""The Immortal,"" Raphael Cain, is not based on any Highlander character from the movies, TV show or Animated Series.  Nope, Cain is based on Soldier Kelly from the ""Snakeeater"" trilogy, possibly the greatest action movie trilogy ever.  In ""The Immortal,"" you have all the elements that made ""Snakeeater"" great: the sidekick (Goodwin, the squire, played by Steve Braun), the ""he's just misunderstood"" psychologist (played by April Telek) and of course, Mr. L2 himself beating and slicing the crud out of everything in sight.  Throw in a little demon-slaying action and you've got a new, re-vamped and upgraded ""Snakeeater"" ready for the jungle that is 21st century syndicated television.  Why didn't they let me pitch this idea?

Well, anyway, the series was cancelled before all the episodes were shown (on WGN in my neck of the woods), so if you are a fan of the show, this dvd set is a dream come true.  I found the series enjoyable and my only complaint about it was the huge number of commercials.  Of course, that complaint is addressed with the dvd collection.  I'm looking forward to this, and collectors better snap it up as I doubt there will be many copies made.  Looking for the dvd equivalent of the fabled ""Mystery Meat"" Vinyl LP that sold for thousands of dollars on eBay a couple years back?  You may be looking at it!",1171929600,11,1434,4.741935483870968
1673727,1,B00005V9IB,"For anyone who thinks this program might be good, run as far as you can from this cheap knock-off starring Lorenzo Lamas. This is an outrageously bad rip-off of the excellent Highlander TV series. Invest your money in the Highlander DVDs, guys. Trust me. I notice that some readers think this review isn't helpful. Well, you're gonna be in for a huge surprise if you ignore my review and buy this dumb series. I have seen every Highlander film numerous times and every episode of the TV series . . . so I consider myself a Highlander expert. When I tell you the ""Immortal"" is a cheap rip off, trust me. Lorenzo Lamas is no Adrian Paul!",1171411200,11,635,4.435897435897436
1673728,1,B00005V9IB,"I got so excited when I read this was being released THINKING it was the ORIGINAL 'The Immortal' TV Series from the 1960's - WHAT A LETDOWN! I had

never heard of THIS new version and I suspect there is a reason for that!",1170115200,3,221,4.0227272727272725
1673729,5,B00005V9IB,"this DVD has been long awaited.  I don't have cable and never saw the Highlander TV show, so I didn't have any prejudices about ripoffs.  Lorenzo Lamas is not hard to look at and the demon slaying storylines were appealing to this Buffy/Angel fan.  Bret ""The Hit Man"" Hart was a guest star and I was really hoping he would be a recurring character.  And then the show was cancelled.  Well, now I'll get to see every episode I missed.",1165104000,10,433,4.3625
1673730,1,B00005V9IB,UGH cannot BELIEVE this is actually being released I saw 2-3 episodes when it was on TV and all I kept thinking that it was a complete rip-off of Highlander the TV series at its absolute WORST.,1164585600,,193,4.243243243243243
1673731,2,B00005V9IB,"This is not a good film, but it made me laugh. Sometimes I was laughing WITH the film, and sometimes AT it.

Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find that it was too close to the Highlander series, although it did centre on a person who was immortal (Lorenzo Lamas), who, BTW, was looking pretty buff in this film. He also really didn't do a bad job with the material. I thought he was okay.

The one good thing about this film, and the reason I bought it, was Dominic Keating. He plays one of the daemons, and he's over the top, almost campy, overtly sexy, dangerous, and a lot of fun. His co-daemon, an actor I don't know, was also wonderfully camp and sexy. She was great, and they made a fun evil pair. Some of the lines they had to say, though, were downright embarassing, and I laughed a lot during this film - not because the author intended me to laugh, but because it was just so BAD, so over the top.

If you can get the film cheap, it's worth a watch for Dominic and his co-daemon alone.",1113264000,,995,4.198952879581152

7956238,4,B00005V9IB,"This has to be one of the worst films ever made, but if you sit down to watch it knowing that and ready to laugh, it's worth your time.

Imagine Highlander made by a freshman film student, with some of his friends and/or random people off the street reading lines they have never read before, with a budget that consists solely of change found in said freshman's furniture, and you'll have scratched the surface of how amateurish, campy, and unintentionally hilarious this movie is.

Lorenzo Lamas's hair alone demands viewing, as does the opening scene, wherein a guy (ostensibly a ""demon"") is standing on a wall, straight out from a wall... and there, as clear as the agony on your face, is the wire holding him up.  I hated this movie the first time my roommate made me watch it, but after the sixth or seventh, Stockholm syndrome set in and I started to... well, not like, but appreciate how gloriously bad this movie is.  I offer my highest recommendations, if only for the cringing laughs and laughing cringes this steaming pile is bound to elicit, from the aforementioned opening to the ending credits.

You owe it to every decent film in existence to see this, so you can appreciate how much better every other movie ever made is.  It makes Leonard Part Six look like Citizen Kane, Gigli look like Seven Samurai, Showgirls look like Casablanca, and Episode II look like Episode V.  It's that bad, and revels in it.

God bless you, Lorenzo Lamas.  Never give up, and never change your hair.",1292630400,,1497,4.640151515151516

7956240,4,B00005V9IB,"A Review in two parts (1) ""THE IMMORTAL"" TV series pilot movie released by Spartan Home Entertainment in 2002.  Amazon's specs for this movie are incorrect--this movie is in WIDESCREEN format--NOT Full Screen!  Also, since Amazon neglected to provide a plot summary, I'll quote from the DVD package: FRONT: ""He cannot die.  He cannot forget.  He will not forgive."" BACK: Earth has become a playground for Demons, and only one man, the man who has walked their world for four hundred years, can detect and destroy them.  That man is Keane Emerald.  As a master warrior, Keane is Samurai, soldier, gunfighter and martial artist.  His immortal strength feeds him with the powers of bullet dodging speed and wound healing mystery.  But his mortal enemies are always on the prowl for new and inventive ways to destroy him..."".  NOTE: Inexplicably, the box artwork says that Lorenzo Lamas' character is named ""Keane Emerald""--when in fact his character is named Raphael ""Rafe"" Cain!  Perhaps the ""Keane Emerald"" name came from an early draft of the pilot script???  This is a fun movie and a great pilot! (2) THE IMMORTAL (22 episode series) released by Image Entertainment in 2007.  This series is very underated and originally aired with little fanfare in most U.S. cities at 3:00 a.m. This is a very lively and engaging TV series with rousing action and great characters and situations.  If you're a fan of shows featuring immortal heroes (""Forever Knight"", ""Highlander"", ""Angel"", ""Reaper"", etc.), than don't hesitate to add ""THE IMMORTAL"" to your DVD collection.  Guest stars in the series (and the pilot movie) include Dominic Keating (""Star Trek: Enterprise"")--who steals every scene he is in!--and the beautiful Grace Park (""Battlestar Galactica"").
The following is a list of episode titles for THE IMMORTAL:
1) ""Demons of the Night"" (pilot, part 1)
2) ""Demons of the Night"" (pilot, part 2)
3) ""Halfway""
4) ""Not So Dead""
5) ""Wicked Wicked West""
6) ""Prime Location""
7) ""Studio D""--Guest Starring Tyler Labine (""Reaper"", ""Invasion"")
8) ""Flight 666""
9) ""Bride's Kiss""
10) ""The Hunted""
11) ""Forest for the Trees""
12) ""The Asylum""
13) ""Learning Curve""--Guest Starring Jewel Staite (""Firefly"")
14) ""The Good Squire""
15) ""Wired""
16) ""Replay""
17) ""Spy vs. Spa""
18) ""Happily Ever After""
19) ""Deja Vu""
20) ""Reckoning"" (part 1)
21) ""Reckoning"" (part 2)
22) ""Kiyomi""",1243814400,6,2355,5.098958333333333
7956241,5,B00005V9IB,"I just received my Dvd today and have watched the first Disc and so far like what I see.. Its a pretty good show.. really have to have a open mind on this.. its no Renegade, but its good it in own right. I remember when It came out in 2000, I watched a few episodes..

Its not a ""knock off"" of Highlander.. for all those ""Highlander goons"" who bash this.. get out and find a girl and get laid.. you spend too much time comparing tv shows.

Its well worth the $35 I spent and can't wait to finish the rest of the DVD.

I would recommend this to a Lamas fan.. Its all good fun..

Just like in Life.. don't take it too seriously...",1231113600,4,628,3.9603174603174605

 Far better than The Highlander series,everyone is raving about.
Lorenzo Lamas always does interesting stuff.
