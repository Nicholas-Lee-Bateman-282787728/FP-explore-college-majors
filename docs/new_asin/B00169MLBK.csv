It started out with a 9 minute ""yoga"" warmup which was actually some basic movements sitting on a chair. Not really yoga. It incorporated some side stretches, lifts and contractions as well as a little bit of ab work from lifting your feet off the ground and holding. The next 15 minutes was a ballet barre workout which I found to be quite simple. I had to supply my own modifications to make it worthwhile (e.g. she'd have one foot pointed to the side and would balance there, but I'd lift my leg off the ground to balance). The entire workout I did without a barre or chair to aide in my balance and I still found it too easy. (I should mention that I do have dance background so this also effects my judgment. That having been said, I still think this would be basic for most exercisers. I've seen and done much more challenging and effective barre workouts aimed toward non-dancers.) Also, she switched sides quite a bit which disrupted the flow. For example she'd do one move on the right leg and they say ""okay, now move your chair to the other side"" where she would do the one move on the left leg. Then you'd move the chair back again for the next move and switch sides AGAIN before moving on. It added up to quite a lot of chair moving. The last 12 minute segment was titled ""lower body burn"" and I really thought it was mislabeled with the first section, as this was completely made up of traditional yoga. I did not feel the lower body burn. Some warrior poses were held, where there was the opportunity for some lower body workout, but they were not held long and were only a small part of the yoga series... the majority of this yoga section was not focused on the lower body. It seemed to focus much more on the spine and back.

I will say that the instructor is pleasant and professional. There are two girls behind her and all three of them are in good shape. One girl shows modifications throughout, though there isn't really much to modify to make it simpler than it already is.

I'd say if you're truly a beginner exerciser and want a low key introduction to ballet barre workouts or yoga this MAY be for you. But truthfully, there's better workout dvds out there. Anyone who considers themselves to be intermediate or above, I'd pass on this one. I have only heard positive things about her other cardio blast workouts. Perhaps those are better than this one.",1299974400,8,2534,4.400852878464819
