7908802,3,B00000G3HF,"Do not be misled from the other reviews , the Jubei from this movie has nothing to do with jubei kibagami from ninja scroll.

""reborn from hell"" focuses on Jubei Yagyu. they are completly different characters. Also, there is an anime based on the ""Reborn from Hell"" series, which I advise to all to not waste your time. The animation is horrible and the voice acting is not much better.",1105747200,,386,4.514285714285714
7908803,4,B00000G3HF,"I wholeheartedly DIS-agree on Samurai Armageddon...I dug the movie; the acting is hokey as can be, but you gotta remember, EVERY Kung Fu/Ninja/Samurai movie that contains ANY ""mystical"" elements is gonna be hokey: Ninja Wars, Kung Fu Zombies, Super Ninjas, Spiritual Kung Fu, Nine Demons (The Venoms-Shaw  Brothers), practically anything with Sho Kasugi as the main star....I have every movie listed (except the Sho Kasugi stuff) and love them all... They're all hokey, but have some awesome martial action... In fact, Jubei performs some of the best kendo moves this side of Itto Oogami (Lone Wolf)... Plus, the fact that it's part of the Jubei Yagyu (also in Samurai Shodown) saga is most cool... The plot for Samurai Armageddon is the same plot used for Ninja Resurrection Vol. 2 [anime] (the Jubei Yagyu from Ninja Scroll [anime] in another dimension) . . .",996710400,,861,5.020979020979021
7908804,3,B00000G3HF,"This is a rather enjoyable flic, as long as you can keep an open mind.  Those who enjoy B-type action and anime will be able to appreciate this one  the most.  The storyline is entertaining but a little hard to follow at  times.  However, the comical ultra-action fight scenes do a good job making  up for the lacking story.
The characters and storyline seem to be  straight out of an anime, and while the acting isn't great, it didn't  strike me as overly cheesy either.
The shortest synopsis is porbably:  Ninja Scroll (or Ninja Ressurection) made live-action.
Definitely not one  for kids!",966211200,,592,4.715686274509804
7908805,1,B00000G3HF,"If you want to see the most un-professional movie. This is the one. A whole production seems complete 3 days and all actors are just came out of campus. Special effects? Not really. rather called ""Kidergarten Trick  Show"" Still, this worth to watch because thie shows you the limit of  worst film making.",950832000,,304,4.716981132075472
7908806,1,B00000G3HF,"Yeesh. This was horrible. Asian production value is typically not as high as stuff made here in the States- but this swill- is awful. The dubbing looks like a squad of epileptic baboons did it. I'm a fan of ninja movies  and all, but this was the worst I have seen in a long time. The plot  revolves around Jubei (ninja story staple) and his efforts to stop a madman  who is bringing back dead warriors for the Armageddon. Heads and green  blood go a flyin- all to a very incoherent, poorly constructed plot that  just kinda ends. I guess this was kinda supposed to be a shock video, but  the only thing that shocked me was that customs let this schlock in the  country.",950572800,,670,4.312
7908807,1,B00000G3HF,"Poor special effects, bad dubbing, bad editing, bad acting and just plain bad. I swear that this stupidity is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Highlights of this dreck: The way every character punctuates  phrases with ""From Hell! "" Here's an example : ""Do you want  any rice with that Tempura?"" ""Yes- From Hell! "" Anyways-  This movie was especially insulting. Typically, Hong Kong and Japanesse  stuff usually has lower prodcution values than American stuff, but this is  just so dumb it even is bad to martial arts fans. I think the plot has  something to do with the devil bringing ancient dead bad guys to life and  using them is some Armageddeon that doesn't ever appear. Bad Bad Bad.",949276800,,708,4.616
7908808,2,B00000G3HF,"While the acting is mostly good in this film (hence the 2-star rating), the fight scenes are dull, the special effects poorly done, and the storyline muddled.
To make matters worse, the film doesn't have an  ending... or rather, the ending is a cliffhanger that makes 'Back the  Future 2' (for example) look like a complete story.
I like my movies with  beginning, middles, and ends, even if they are obviously setting up for a  sequel. ""Reborn from Hell"" spent too much time setting up the  conflicts and the bad guys and never delivered a proper pay-off.",947635200,,556,4.690721649484536
7908809,4,B00000G3HF,The fight scenes were da bomb but the special effects were no good. I watched the english version...the dubbing wasn't good,929491200,2,123,4.904761904761905
