the over all plot gets tediouse at times, but the director is going in the right direction in
the sense of light and it's many moods. The back drop, having different seasons with its moods,
and spotless complexctions of these characters gives one the sense of good breeding, which is always a
nice breath of fresh air from the tatoo monsters that are body snatcing hollywood.",1278374400,,470,4.7439024390243905

Worst ever! This lame excuse for a telenovela features flouncing senoritas with bare midriffs and short shorts (for business clothes!), scripts about business dealings written by people who have never worked in the business world, nefarious plots, false identities and lies, lies, lies!

I have never seen a script so full of misleading tales, mistaken identities, betrayals and hysterical women. There is absolutely NO one to root for other than Maria (Ana Luca Domnguez) and possibly Diego (David Zepeda). She's a straight shooter but he perpetrates the biggest lie in order to help his old Army buddy by swapping identities with him.

This never rises above cartoon levels. There is no convincing love story and the bad guys aren't sufficiently punished, in my book. Booooo... Hisssss....

There was only one note-worthy bit and it was a sub-plot that involved a sneaking thief who had two families, neither of which knew about the other. One little girl is gifted, but when Papa learns she had an I.Q. test he is horrified. You have an I.Q.? How did you get it? Where have you been? The 10-year-old girl despairs of ever explaining it to her dim-witted dad...and her mother's no better!",1426464000,,1238,5.019512195121951

I am very happy bought it........good product quality.......delivered as promised !!!",1407888000,,95,7.0
8208803,5,B000TEUSN6,Story line is great since I saw on tv but the last disk doesn't work with subtitiles. The button for going to sub-titles doesn't work and the last part of the sentences of the sub-titles drops off leaving incomplete meanings. It doesn't matter so much for me but for friends who want to watch and don't understand any Spanish this is not good. I bought two copies of this one thinking maybe the first was defective but it is the same on both copies. Needs to be fixed.,1390694400,4,468,4.329545454545454

8208805,5,B000TEUSN6,Me diverti como nunca.  Quisiera saber quien escribio esta telenovela que es tan divertido.  Me gusto desde el primer episodio hasta el final.  Quisiera ver telenovelas como estas que tienen muchisimo que contar e imaginar.  Me senti como cada una de las personajes de esta telenovela.  Muy divertido.,1333756800,3,301,5.1875
8208806,3,B000TEUSN6,Unfortunately I cannot give 4*s but only 3*s since Disc 3 is dysfunctional.  I now have received two replacements from Amazon that still do not work.  Very frustrated.  Would love to see the end of this telenovella.  I have become a telenovella junkie.,1320883200,3,252,4.790697674418604
8208807,5,B000TEUSN6,"i have heard about this telenovela and even though its an abridged version, for the price its worth it

the story line is worth watching the movie. It was a good bargain",1315872000,,169,4.28125
8208808,4,B000TEUSN6,"I liked this series very much.  I never saw it before, did not know anything about it but sounded intriguing.  I was not disapointed.  Sometimes there were some jumps in the sequence and had to imagine what happened in the story, but not too bad. I was pleased.  The quality was also very good. A good purchase.",1293494400,,311,4.4035087719298245
