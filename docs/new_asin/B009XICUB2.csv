5371048,4,B009XICUB2,"Deserved more of a 3.5 star: This one is better than a lot of the D-rated junk on Prime. A nice little trio of Asian ghost stories, wrapped up with a very poor excuse for an anthology ""host"" device - a fortune teller who seems to give out curses rather than fortunes. Normally there is always at least one part of an anthology I dislike, but I was entertained by all 3 of these little ditties. Worth a watch.",1392940800,,408,4.177215189873418
5371049,5,B009XICUB2,"When I first received this DVD I thought it was only one movie.  It is 3 parts of one story.  I saw this twice in one day.  I enjoyed Be With Me that much.  If you are a fan of great horror with a story behind it, get this.",1388448000,,223,3.489795918367347

5371051,5,B009XICUB2,I could see me watching this again. I enjoyed the first two stories but loved the third one. I like the way the characters were portrayed and even shed a tear in the end when the girls spirit was finally released. I highly recommend that others give this movie a try. Not to scary at all.,1380326400,,288,4.160714285714286
5371052,4,B009XICUB2,"the first part was good, the second was ok, but i really did enjoy the third the best (ghost boy). I think that it had a better story line and i liked the characters and it would make for a great  spine off",1373500800,2,206,3.7906976744186047
5371053,5,B009XICUB2,I gave this one 5 start because I think it was great for what it was. Decent story and entertained till the end. I'll be honest that I am a biased opinion because I am one of those people that really enjoys horror films. I'd recommend this movie to people who like Asian horror films that deal with the supernatural story lines.,1372204800,,328,4.306451612903226
5371054,3,B009XICUB2,"If you are looking for a movie filled with ""cover your eyes!"" horror and ""I can't take the pressure of what's going to happen next!!!"" suspense, then ""Be with me"" is going to leave you disappointed in both regards. Instead, ""Be with me"" is more of a collection of high school clichs, similar to those you would find in dramas, that have ghosts introduced into them for a new added twist. Does it work?  Somewhat, as the movie is entertaining but it does not deliver in the horror department like stated before and only two of the four stories really engage the viewers attention.

  The first of the four stories is titled ""Tell me your name"" and its only use is to tie together the subsequent stories by providing a starting point in which all the other stories originate from but it fails at resolving its own plot by the end. So you are left wondering as to point of its inclusion, especially when the stories it was suppose to set up already came with their own set up and were clearly written to be self contained. So this alone starts the film at a weak point.

  The second story, titled ""The Unseen"", revolves around a group of students performing a dare by being sent into an abandoned school building that is said to be haunted by a ghost. Yes, most of us have seen it before and ""The Unseen"" does not bring anything new to the table but the comedic elements introduced by the director make you chuckle a bit from time to time. Overall, this one is the weakest story of the main three.

  The third story, titled ""Attached"", is actually very engaging as the story is about two friends that vow to stick together throughout a tough ordeal one of them is facing. It is a story that gives us a reflection on friendship and responsibility. Viewers that have seen most of the movies in the ""Whispering Corridors"" series, another Korean high school horror movie collection, might feel unengaged a bit here as many plot lines and elements have been borrowed by ""Attached"" but they are rearranged in a different way to still give entertainment.

  The final story, titled ""Ghost Boy"", is the strongest of all the stories and delivers a high amount of entertainment. The story follows a meek high school student that is able to see ghost due to a power that is passed through his family. He deals with this power by avoiding contact with most ghost he sees as many died in gruesome ways and are just plain angry at everything but one day he is thrown for a loop when he meets the ghost of a good natured young girl who is following one of his classmates. Next thing he knows, he has to deal with this young girl who has grown attached to him because he is the only individual that can see and feel her, while he also has to protect her from some unknown danger she feels she is in. It's a really heartwarming story with comedic elements, that are not over used like in ""The Unseen"", and provide a very fun story.

  Overall, ""Be with me"" is a movie that will be enjoyed the most by fans that already like high school stories similar to those found in anime, manga, dramas, or other movies of similar fashion. Fans of horror but not necessarily of the previously mentioned might feel cheated as the movie does really poor in the horror department and focuses more on story or comedic elements. My advice would be to rent it (or view it for free as part of Amazon's Prime program) if you are already are inclined to this type of high school story telling and if you are not, then I would skip it unless you can view if for free. Hope I was able to help anyone reading this who was on the fence.",1368144000,,3593,4.3966817496229265
5371055,3,B009XICUB2,"I did not go into this film expecting anything great; I just hoped to be entertained.  Overall, I was.  I did not find the three stories great by any means, but the second and third one entertained and touched me more than I expected them to.

That said, to me it is obvious that these are films by relatively inexperienced (or at least they are imo) directors, but they do not do badly with what budgets they had.  The acting was pretty good and I liked how, despite this being a foreign film to me, did not alienate me with too many subtitles.  I had an easy time following the plots and was not overwhelmed with the subtitles at all.

Addressing the ""frame story"" I was disappointed with such an over-used formula.  It is pretty cliche by now, but I suppose finding another to tie in these stories would have been difficult.  It also does not ""resolve"" itself or even give a reason for being there other than to tie such separate stories together.  That knocked me out of that particular element of the film in an almost ""fourth wall"" way.

As to the stories themselves, they were not bad.  The first one left me disappointed and felt too formulaic, imo.

The second was very moving, touching, sad, yet had a wonderful ending that not only surprised me a bit, but left me feeling that that was the way it SHOULD have ended!  Sometimes betrayed love gets its own back in the end in a unique way that is satisfying.

The final story had humour and some tense moments (but nothing to make me jump) and I really loved the actors in it, especially the cute girl ghost.  You learn something significant about one of the characters who comes off as totally different from what he appears at first.  It was a moving, funny at times, and well-done little story that I really enjoyed.

All in all, I am not certain I would purchase this film, but perhaps if it is offered relatively cheaply (I saw it for free on Amazon Prime) I may.  For fans of the genre, like me, I liked it well enough that I would not mind seeing it again.

Overall, not a great film by any means, but one I would recommend watching at least once.",1365033600,,2112,4.3554987212276215
5371056,4,B009XICUB2,"Be With Me, aka Ghost, is a South Korean horror anthology that follows three girls that are told their fortunes and are told to expect a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity after they chant their name 3 times in front of a mirror. Each story has a ghost theme, all of them using horror as their main element, the first and last story use some comedy. Be With Me is a great horror anthology.

I enjoyed all of the stories in this film. The first story has three students sent into an old school by the seniors and they have to find a ghost. This film uses haunting imagery of ghosts, plenty of jump scares, and some funny moments throughout. The second story follows a young pregnant student and her very close friend. This story doesn't use ghost or jump-scares as often nor does it use any comedy; this story is slower paced, deeper, and has a strong buildup to its ending, making it much more haunting and impactful than the rest. The final story follows another young student that can see ghosts; he befriends a friendly ghost that is still being hunted by her murder. This one also uses ghosts and some funny moments. This story reaches a bit further into the unique and creative zone. I didn't love the frame story, but it got the job done; it was a little confusing due to the lack of a fulfilling explanations, and the subtitles could've been better during these scenes. It's not the scariest film ever, but it packs a few great scares. The acting was great in all of the stories.

Overall, Be With Me is a great horror anthology. All of the stories are enjoyable, some scarier than others and some with comedy elements. (don't expect a horror/comedy, I mean it has some funny moments but it never really feels like a real comedy) as of 2/19/13, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video, a purchase is recommended for fans of the genre, a rental otherwise.

Be With Me has some violence and blood.",1362182400,11,1911,4.517341040462428

5371066,4,B009XICUB2,"I came across this movie while going through the Amazon Prime choices and decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did.

Be With me is a S. Korean ghost film that's broken into three stories. The connection is through a fortune teller, who has a session with three separate girls. He tells them their lives will change. After that,  the film shows what happens to them next.

The first tale was the scariest and involved three female students  going into an old school to recover items for a bossy senior. The ghost in this story was definitely the creepiest and the atmosphere was by far the spookiest. It was my favorite of the three stories overall, although the third one was also good.

The second tale is about two friends who run into a problem on campus, when they, and one other student have to compete for a recommendation to a University, which I'm assuming is Seoul University. The ghost story wasn't as spooky as the first. It kind of reminded me of other Korean Ghosts films I've seen in the past. But it's still a decent tale in it's own right.

The third tale was the most light-hearted in general. It involved a male student  who has the ability to see ghosts. The story doesn't turn out to be what you think it will be. So if you're expecting a Sixth Sense type scenario, you're wrong. This was more of a Fantasy/Horror tale, with a slight love story thrown in. It was very clever.

In the end I gave the compilation a 4. The stories were all good in their own right, although my favorites would have to be the first and third story. I also appreciated how the tales took time to develop the plots. Each was about 30 minutes long. That was enough time to give a little background on the characters, before the hauntings began.

If you like Korean Ghost films, this is definitely a good one to catch. It doesn't focus on the horror aspect as much  as the relationship factor. But the tales were still better than most of the tired ghost films coming out of Hollywood these days. Be With Me is an appropriate title, even if it doesn't help give a hint into the haunting aspect of the movie. There are ghosts. Not all of them are scary, but that's part of the film's charm.",1425513600,5,2184,4.37037037037037
5371067,5,B009XICUB2,Very cute overall. The first one was the spookiest but I liked each of them individually. 5/5 would suggest to ppl,1423612800,,114,4.476190476190476

5371070,3,B009XICUB2,"Pacing of the first two stories was s.l.o.w.; I did not find either of them interesting. The usual tragic lonely outsider ghost story, with nothing new. The third story is the best and was rather entertaining. It offered something different and a much lighter tone than the first two. It was funny without being too silly. While there is still a tragedy in the third story, it isn't the focus and it certainly doesn't damper the mood much. If you decide to watch this, you will not miss anything by skipping the first two stories (especially if you have seen enough Asian ghost movies). I would give the third story 4 stars and 1 star for the other two.",1419379200,,653,4.495798319327731
