8252752,5,B0013SJNPG,"This DVD is very interesting and informative as well as entertaining. We got it before our trip to Rome as an overview, but this would be fun for anyone who wants to ""visit"" Rome from their living room. We have an older DVD player and it wouldn't work for this DVD, so we watched it on our computer. Not sure why, but it played just fine on the computer. The scenery is beautiful, the tour of the Vatican and Sistine Chapel was almost like beiing there.",1361923200,,453,4.27906976744186
