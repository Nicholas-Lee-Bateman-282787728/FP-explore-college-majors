3017827,2,B000YAA68C,"Unfortunately, this movie was poorly cast. The storyline is there, the idea is exciting and genuinely romantic. The cast, principals in particular is really off. there is no chemistry between Gerrard Butler and Hilary Swank. It comes down to Hilary Swank's inability to be a romantic leading lady. It's hard to imagine her romantically with anyone and Gerard Butler doesn't come through for both of them. Harry Connick Jr., who used to be a gorgeous crooner, from Hope Floats to a reoccurring role on Will and Grace has now turned into an overweight guy who is getting second-hand roles. Gina Gershon, who is usually great in each of her performances, is plagued by bad face impressions. James Marsters is extremely underused. Lisa Kudrow, the comedic light of the film, shows promise but could be a lot funnier and is generally a lot funnier in all her other roles. The only interaction that makes sense is that between Kathy Bates' character and Hilary Swank's. Their mother-daughter relationship is shaky but gets the much-needed boost at the end. The admirable features of the movie are all due to what must be genuinely good source material, i.e. the novel it is based on. The idea that the heroine isn't dependant on the guy for her salvation, but, in fact, looses herself in him is gutsy. The fact that her involvement with the love of her life stunts her ability to find herself and that it's his death that releases her is so fascinating to see on the screen and so real, that's it's scary. I only wished they would focus more on this and develop it. If they had only embraced it! Still, as far as romantic comedies go, it's refreshing to see that every once in a while there comes a movie that doesn't end with a happily ever union.",1198022400,32,1742,4.659090909090909

3017838,1,B000YAA68C,I was very disappointed! I loved the original movie. This is an edited version and leaves out some of the funniest parts (in my humble opinion). I bought this so my mom could watch whenever she likes. She loves this film and is 82 and now gets confused when using the remotes so I got ALEXA but she sure noticed the missing sections of the movie.

I wish they had done something a bit better for the character that Harry Connick Jr played.  He is a good actor himself and there wasn't much for him to work with as his character. I know the movie didn't get rave reviews from the critics but who cares.  There are lots of movies that are considered bad yet we love them. Such was the case with this one. I thought the entire cast was magnificent. Each was so unique and you'd never think they were the best of friends and yet they were. I had to buy another one due to just wearing the first one out.

3017918,2,B000YAA68C,"The movie was actually pretty good. I didn't like the character of Holly though. She seemed flaky, selfish and flighty. Everything had to revolve around her. In the beginning it's starts with a fight between the couple of Holly and her husband Gerry. She has no idea what she wants and she can't keep a job, quit 5 because she couldn't work for idiots, and just started getting a regular paycheck on the sixth job. She then complained about money yet she doesn't mind spending money on designer clothing, her excuse is she buys them on eBay. So I guess that makes the money she spends on them not count. She doesn't want a baby her excuse being their living situation. She talks on and on about showing people houses that she can't afford. What exactly does she expect to happen? If money is the problem, why not buy clothes and shoes like a regular person instead of needing designer everything? eBay does count. Gerry even offered to get a second job if that's what she wanted. He's all about trying to give his wife what she wants, she has no idea what that is! Holly is very selfish, everything is always about her wants and needs and her husband is expected to just agree and go along. When he dies, it's still all about her. Her grief over losing someone it looks like she hadn't appreciated anyway. Someone who took the time to try to help her through her grief. He's kind enough to write her letters written to ease her through it starting on her 30th birthday. As she goes along her friends are surrounding her. Yet towards the end when one of her friends is getting married, she can't even be happy for her. She starts avoiding her friends, no calls, no nothing. All of a sudden she decides to design shoes. And finally she seems to be able to focus on someone other than herself. She decides to see her friend at her bridal fitting to apologize and ask to design her wedding shoes. Apparently sometime after that she falls for someone else and lives happily ever after. I like the movie but it would've been nice if the focus wasn't about her wants and needs all throughout the movie.",1484179200,,2095,4.458333333333333

Hillary Swank was outstanding in her portrayal of a grieving widow and how she coped with the aftermath of losing her husband, Gerard Butler at such a young age. Kathy Bates played an outstanding role as Hillary's single mother trying to help her daughter cope.
It's a great ""Girlie Flick"" to watch on a rainy Saturday night or a good popcorn movie anytime. I would  highly recommend this movie, not only because it keeps you enthralled with how it's going to turn out, but how each life intertwines with one another during it's progression of grief and moving on.

3018037,4,B000YAA68C,"I didn't read the book, so I'm only rating the movie... although, I might pick up the book one day to see what all the hubbub is about.  The screenplay was fairly good with two exceptions: (a) the sex scene in Ireland seemed out of character/unnecessary and (b) the relationship between Hilary Swank's grieving widow and Harry Connick's lovesick bartender really missed.  Gerard Butler turned in a solid performance (the occasional slip in his faux-Irish brogue didn't bother me too much) and Kathy Bates stole a couple of scenes, as you would expect.  Also good supporting turns by Gina Gershon, Lisa Kudrow and James Marsters.  Harry Connick, Jr. (who I normally like) had a purposefully unsympathetic role which was poorly written - I thought he was wasted in this film.  Incredible camera work for all the scenes filmed in Ireland.

As others have noted, Hillary Swank can be great in certain vehicles, but totally miss in others.  This movie falls toward the later for me: she's not terrible, but I never empathized with her character (she comes across as spoiled and entitled here) and I could envision other actresses who would be more engaging in the role.

At 2 hours, I thought the movie could have been more concise without sacrificing the story line... but that's what happens when the director is also the screenwriter.  All-in-all, I thought the movie was well crafted and IMDb's rating of 7.1/10 is spot on.",1468108800,5,1422,4.867219917012448

The emotions shown by the wife were moderate depression turned into happiness when her husband would send letters asking her to live life. Chances are, if you have lost someone, you really don't want to be going out to karaoke just because a letter from the dead asked you to do so. You'd probably be even more depressed that the person isn't around.",1465948800,2,415,4.546666666666667

3018065,5,B000YAA68C,"I usually watch a lot of court dramas and suspense thrillers, and I seldom pay attention to romance movies.  Since my friend recommended to me highly, so I just gave it a shot.  It really exceeds my expectations.  I watched ""The Notebook"" acted by Ryan Gosling and found it very touching.  But this one's pathos is beyond description, I couldn't help stopping my tears rolled down my cheeks at the end of the movie.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you are looking for a romance movie which will touch your inner heart",1463875200,3,508,4.6
3018066,5,B000YAA68C,"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways lol. I love how you meet Gerry and Holly in the beginning a real couple having a fight that a million couples (the one I'm in included) about if they are ready or not ready to have a baby and her fear because of her own father issuses (which I can also understand). But then when she loses him anyway it's heartbreaking and a part of me felt it was kind of mean like let the woman move on but he knew better then anyone what she would really need to move on. It sounds weird but she almost needed his permission and his guidence to move on. I also really liked Holly's best friends in the movie and how hard it can feel when it looks like everyone is moving on with their wonderful carefree lives and you're just depressed and not moving at all. It's really about not loving the man you were with anymore but loving him but know you need to move on and if the man you loved really loved you he wouldn't want you to just be a person who walks and talks like their alive but really are alive. Because if something happened to me and Joe stopped his life right then and there and just lived sad and alone for the rest of his life I'd be mad at him because he's amazing and while I might hate him with another girl I'd be a much happier dead person knowing he's with someone who he loves and who loves him back then is all alone. That is what loving someone means, wanting them to be happy even if it isn't with you. Thats what I took from this movie anyway. But best quote I've gotta say is Lisa Kudrow when Gina Gerswhen's husband says ""this is why you can't get a guy."" and Lisa's character let's him in on a BIG point in what it means to becoming equal to men in this world trust me.  Snuggle up with your man or your big strong dog or even your big handsome teddy bear, a box of tissues and make sure to take off your eye make up not actually just all make up so you don't have to wash your face 10 times and your pillow case is ruined lol.",1463702400,,1983,3.9824120603015074

3018126,1,B000YAA68C,"Notice: my viewing experience may be unique due to the circumstance accompanying it.

First of all, do NOT attempt to watch this if you are streaming it via Comcast. The movie started decently, following the clich chick-flick format that has been squeezed so hard, all that's left is a thick, pulpy orange juice that's difficult to swallow. But Gerard is a man's man (see 300) and Hilary Swank is the type of girl you could take home to mom if she doesn't punch your lights out first.

We are acquainted with these two in the first scene, as they argue over a seemingly over-dramatic issue that fits the aforementioned format all too well. Of course, the end up reconciling over a passionate kiss that left me wondering if the two had practiced off screen. Naturally, my thoughts gravitated towards how much ""practicing"" this line of work typically entails. Maybe I should be an actor?

Note: this is where I dozed off for approximately 15 minutes.

I awoke to my girlfriend sobbing hysterically at the streaming wheel of death taunting her as Comcast yet again fails to meet basic customer expectations. Knowing full well my domestic responsibilities, I grumble as I pick up my phone to prepare to ream some poor, minimum wage sap who's only means of earning a living revolves around taking a verbal crucifixion over something he has no control over. All the while, Comcast executives laugh manically over our mutual misfortune, in some lush office on the top floor of the biggest skyscraper that can be found in the 7th layer of hell.

Before I can hit the speed dial, my girlfriend is trying to fill the short moments between her gasps for air with an explanation of her discomfort. SPOILER ALERT: Gerard dies. Not only has he died, but he tortures Hilary by sending her letters from beyond the grave in apparent attempt to prove once and for all that life still sucks after death. Of course girls will eat this sh*t up, but if you are a heterosexual male with a disdain for overly dramatic plot lines, don't watch this movie. Especially via Comcast streaming.",1456876800,,2063,4.719444444444444

3018888,3,B000YAA68C,"I sat through this film but it took two evenings and I fast-forwarded the part in Ireland, on the second sitting.  I'm not sure why I didn't like it more than I did.  The story is interesting enough and the whole cast is excellent.  I think the casting is the problem.  Hillary Swank is a talented actress but I think rom-com's may not be what she does best.  She has great emotional depth and here she's supposed to play cute and frothy.  Actually there's nothing wrong with her performance; it's just that it belongs in a totally different film, not one where her pals are Lisa Kudrow and the other buddy.  She does tragedy well; comedy not so much.  There are a number of other Hollywood actresses who could have polished off this role with great aplomb and made into a shining little bauble.  I think the director couldn't decide to go for funny or pathos and the result is this mess.  There's very little chemistry between her and Butler and although the film makes it plain that he loves her, it doesn't show us why.  She seems uptight and cranky and although she has a lovely body the terrible plaid dresses she wears do nothing for her.

Gerard Butler is always charming, Kathy Bates does a good job as the long suffering Mom, Lisa Kudrow is always fun to watch, and the fellow who plays the Irish friend of the deceased Gerry is beyond adorable!  I found the character played by Harry Connick Jr. quite problemmatic.  I don't want to give away any of the plot, only will say that his characterization seemed to leave a bad taste in my mouth.

I think the film could have been a lot better with the single change of the leading actress.  It's not bad, just doesn't have that fun and sparkle that rom-coms are supposed to have.",1417132800,,1734,4.439873417721519

3018892,5,B000YAA68C,"Richard LaGravanese (The Fisher King, Freedom Writers) takes you on a delicate and poignant ride of heartbreak and mourning.  Known for being somewhat sentimental, LaGravanese paints another powerful story of how love sadly parted by chance, can still be celebrated, appreciated and survived.  What some men might call another ""chick flick"" is really a heart-wrenching journey into the common emotions we all share surrounding the death of cherished love.  It is impossible to not enjoy Gerard Butler as the Irish bon vivant who sweeps the audience off its feet much like he does the uncertain and self-constrained Hillary Swank.  Even further stealing the show is Harry Connick, Jr., the mildly depressed and socially awkward bartender with no filter, who says everything confused men want to say to women they admire and gets away with it.  Bonus appearances from the always strong Kathy Bates and wonderfully scattered Lisa Kudrow add more flavor, and along with the steady James Marsters and reliable Gina Gershon, P.S. I Love You isn't your average romantic comedy.  It's a powerful story of mourning and rebirth, and at its core, what life is all about.",1416268800,,1159,5.138297872340425

It's a good movie to watch when you're going through a break-up or just feeling down because it reminds you that the world is unfair but there is light at the end of a tunnel. Holly and Gerry's love is real and believable, and her pain feels real throughout the movie. Another thing I like is that nothing definitive happens by the end.

3019048,5,B000YAA68C,"Just finished watching this movie and was not disappointed.  Gerard was great as usual, the good caring man who goes the extra mile in showing his love for his wife.  Hillery was very good as were all the others, Harry, Lisa, and Kathy.  I did not know the others but all were very good.  Do need some tissues near by, but there are a lot of laughs also.  Many very poignant moments caught let me just say real life.  I understand from some postings that it was a disappointment to those who read the book; however, I think the real point of this movie was the love shown by Gerard's character Gerry for his wife and no matter how much it might have deviated from the book the point was made of what he did.  It stands as a lasting memorial to the great love and compassion Gerry had for his wife and we can all learn some valuable lessons from this movie.",1410393600,,856,4.214723926380368

I'm glad she didn't. This is now one of my favorite movies, and I'm surprised to say that because it's not the sort of thing I usually watch. But it is a very unexpected movie in so many ways. It is deeper and funnier and sadder and more than it would seem. It's greater than the sum of its parts.

3019229,5,B000YAA68C,"I don't recall too many, if any, romantic comedies on Hillary Swank's resume.  In fact, I don't recall too many comedies on her resume.  But, in a film where she doesn't die by the end, Swank shines as always as she plays a woman who, in the wake of her beloved husband's sudden death, must learn to pick up the pieces and move on in her life.  As I've said, Swank did as great as ever here and this change of genre was surprising but ultimately welcome.  Did anyone beside me see Phoebe from ""Friends?  Yes, I know Lisa Kudrow was in the movie, but unfortunately, she's Phoebe.  So seeing her as a female version of Joey was just weird...and sometimes a bit forced.  But she and the rest of the cast were still pretty good throughout the film.  Even Harry Connick, Jr. showed some life here and there.  And Gerard Butler left us with a memorable performance as Swank's now-dead husband, making us miss him all the more.  My only wish is that we'd seen more of Kathy Bates on the grounds that she's just awesome.  My biggest praise goes for the ending as it did not go the way we all thought it would.  Oh, there were plenty of hints towards the ending every one of these movies moves towards, but there's a nice, and completely believable, twist at the end that leaves us with as much, if not a bit more, satisfaction as if a stereotypical ending had been chosen.  This is a fine film.  Enjoy.  P.S.:  I love you, film.",1403827200,5,1420,4.321969696969697

So even when there were times when I knew Holly""s pain and it was hard to watch at certain points. It was also a comforting movie to me.

I thought that maybe this priming would help but it did not.  This movie was so fake and totally unrealistic.  Yes that guy is cute but there was no chemistry between him and Hilary that I could see.

Listen to me:  If you saw it and didn't like it, try it again.  Bet you would like it--there's a lot going on that you might not catch the first time around.  Some movies are like that.

One part that really got me was after an intense argument he comes back inside and sweetly asks, ""Are we finished now, love?"" Who wouldnt want to end a fight in such a tender way? Gerard Butler (Jerry) melts the heart as he continuously shows his love for his wife Holly, even after his death. One look and a smile from him would make any woman swoon.

I also enjoyed seeing my ""friend"" lisa kudrow flex her acting muscles by playing a character other than Phoebe Buffay. As a man all I can say is ""it was watchable & NOT the super sappy snooze fest I was initially expecting"".

3020042,2,B000YAA68C,"This is a very brief review - more to follow later.

I struggled through watching this film to completion - first on an airplane on my Nook HD+ tablet and then in bed on the Nook at home.

The very first part of the film that I found irritating was how a very critical event in the plot was handled.  I don't want to provide a spoiler, but suffice it to say that some major events happened within the first few minutes very abruptly.

Hilary Swank as the lead is a less than appealing character.  Gerard Butler makes for great ""eye candy"".  The other characters were never developed, so there were many vague, boring and tedious aspects to the film.  I did not find Harry Connick, Jr. intriguing in his role at all.  The camerawork also did not shed an attractive light on Hilary Swank, either.  Her face looked very ""horse-y"" throughout much of the film.",1378425600,,855,4.42948717948718

3020044,5,B000YAA68C,This was a very heart warming and intriguing movie.  I really liked how the story unfolded. It kept me interested throughout the entire movie wondering how each letter would be delivered and what the letter would say to do.,1378339200,,223,4.717948717948718
3020045,5,B000YAA68C,The plot was surprisingly good and Gerard Butler was so freaking AMAZING! I have never watched a love story quite like this one...LOVED IT!,1378339200,,139,4.833333333333333

3020047,1,B000YAA68C,"Here's my last email to the vendor. I think it sums up my experience:

You obviously didn't read my email. I have no intention of returning the DVD as it is not worth the effort to send back a $7 DVD (that's what I paid including shipping) for which I'm going to pay at least half that much in shipping. Not to mention the time and aggravation just to get it shipped. And by the way, I find your statement about it clearly stating Region 2 in the description to be frustrating. How would you expect the average consumer to know what that means. I'm a US customer purchasing a DVD from a US based company. It seems to me that your system would be sophisticated enough to recognize that. For that matter, Amazon should never have recommended the item to me in the first place knowing that I live in the US.",1377907200,,804,4.254901960784314

The story line of the movie starts out well, but it seems the plot changes to a sad one so quickly. The flashbacks of how the couple met is helpful but doesn't explain how the story ends.

This was one the happiest movies I've ever seen! Altho at times, I heard myself go ""AWWWWWW"", it really was fun and funny and more fun! An honestly upbeat movie, with some pretty deep advise given by Cathy Bates to her daughter. It was alll good. And it is a keeper. We can all use her sort of advise now and again.
  Of course Mr. Butler was gorgeous and did fine on his job.(surprise! He sings pretty good). And Ms. Hillary Swank and Lisa Kudrow added to the enjoyment of in my opinion was a VERY good movie. A keeper.",1365552000,,760,4.128378378378378

I didn't cry - cause I'm too manly - and I thought it got kind of sappy. The portrayal of a widow who can't move on from her husband's death felt real, though. I can totally see myself that way if my wife died. The ending was a nice twist on the romcom genre, and the whole thing felt better than average. Worth seeing.",1364860800,,485,4.010309278350515

3020498,1,B000YAA68C,"I guess it must just be me, judging from the other reviews, but I found this movie extremely depressing.  I cried through much of it.  In the beginning, I felt bad for Gerard Butler's character who was engaging and adorable but who had to deal with a bitchy, self-centered, unreasonable wife.  Then for the rest of the movie the grief process was so painful to watch.  Anyone that has suffered through a painful loss in the past will identify with the wife's pain.  The efforts of friends and family to help were relatively useless and not that enjoyable to watch either.  I disliked the twist at the end, and the assumption that William was the guy for her because he had a nice body was sort of disgusting.  Here she had just gone through a profound grief experience and she is supposed to be all happy again because she falls into bed with a nice-looking guy.  Please.  Gerard Butler was the real star of the movie, and his role in the film was minimal.  I would not recommend it unless you are eager to experience suffering along with the Hilary Swank character and watch scene after scene of her selfish, obnoxious behavior.",1364342400,6,1129,4.544554455445544

The cast was outstanding, even the ones I normally don't care much for.  Everyone brought a sincerity to their characters that really showed through.  It's a slow movie, but it's never boring or dull.  Every moment has something that contributes to the whole, and regardless of your situation in life, it's full of moments that you can relate to.

It *is* a sad movie - you can't help but sympathize with the main character, and even as a guy, there's plenty of times the eyes water up.  But there's some shockingly sudden hilarious moments that will have you bark out loud with laughter, totally unexpectedly.

The journey she takes in healing after her husband's death is so well portrayed.

Great movie, and if you're a guy with a significant other, it's one you can score bonus points for renting, and you may just find that you enjoy yourself as well.",1359158400,,978,4.542857142857143

It also deals with guilt and regret: the thing we wish we would have done or said to our loved ones before their tragic and untimely death. It is a film that makes you think about your loved ones, about not taking them for granted. It is a beautiful movies. I wish I had discovered this movie before I became widowed at a young age.

This is definitely one of those movies that reminds you of your own humanity. If you haven't cried in a while and wonder if it's even possible to cry, watch this. You'll be surprised at how easily you connect to the characters (and, therefore, crumble with them) as they move through the various stages of grief from different perspectives (first person as the heroine herself, or third person as her family/friends/neighbors).

If you've ever been in one of these positions, you'll understand why this film got such great reviews. It's not a feel-good make-you-happy film, it's a reminder that life is precious, and we're all in this together. Enjoy it, the message is priceless.",1355875200,,910,4.864516129032258

I rarely judge the acting, the script, the development of plot, etc.  I really enjoyed watching this movie because it had ""a little of everything""--something I personally need in a movie.  It made me laugh and cry.  It had seriousness and lightheartedness. The only disconnect I had was at the beginning of the movie.  The plot seemed to make a jump and I was left with a few questions.  I wondered if I missed something in the first 20 minutes of the movie.  Overall, though, it was a movie that I'd watch again and recommend to my girlfriends.

Marie Antoinette did the same thing with less spectacular results, but hey this is 2008, so when someone has their health, a good business, friends and close relationship with her daughter I am sposed to just fall to pieces when she can't have everything?? ack....

Hillary Swank plays Holly, Gerald Butler plays Gerry, an American woman that falls in love and marries an Irishman. Gerry and Holly's love is wonderful but Gerry dies of a brain tumor. Gerry knowing his wife knows that she needs help and a little push to get over his death and move on. Gerry sends Holly letters to help her do that, making her do things she wouldn't normally do. Each letter is signed P.S. I Love You.

I loved this movie, started off a little slow, but the wonderful man I married (who I secretly wish had that Irish accent) watched it with me. Total chick flick, but a real man can watch it too. I loved the romance that played out the ending was great, tears flowed and smiles, and laughter!!!",1341705600,,747,4.335714285714285

I read Stephen King books, watch some the movies, the movies are never as good as the books because a movie budget cannot match our imaginations. Secondly, if you know you don't like Swank or Butler - then just don't watch the movie to begin with, but don't watch it and then complain about how much you can't stand to watch them. This is a great movie - people are so used to the ending that they expect (ie Swank ending up with Connick) that they can't appreciate a movie that deviates from thier expectations. I didn't see that they had any chemistry to begin with anyway. I love him as a musician and actor, but thier characters had no spark together and this was apparent from the beginning, it was right that they didn't end up together. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is adorable, him and Swank go great together.

There are a couple of scenes that were deleted that I think would have made it a better film if they had been included instead of the Yankee stadium scene.

Hillary Swank is great in this movie and she's not alone.  The entire cast was fantastic.  This movie runs the gamut of emotional highs and lows.  It is funny and tragic, devastating and hopeful.  You will not go wrong by deciding to watch this one.

Kind of like re-reading favorite parts of  ""The Princess Bride"" by William Goldman, and still smiling and finding it humorous. When you love something, you want to experience it again and again. Perhaps I love it because I've lost so many loved ones in the past seven years, and this movie is all about love and loss and dealing with life when you just don't think you can get out of bed. It's a story of a flawed woman who despite her flaws, is truly loved. About a man who reaches beyond the grave and helps her to deal with life again.

There's realism to this movie--not just a smooth, easily flowing, wrap it all up by the end type of movie, although there is a bit of that too. This one is somewhat messy and disjointed along the way. Again, just like real life. Ups, downs, laughter, crying, some weirdness thrown in. Unexpected in places, awkward in others. If you've lost someone you love, this movie carries you along, and leaves you in a better place mentally and emotionally than where you started.

I don't understand these one star reviews, maybe the people who read the book before watching the movie have valid complaints but anyone who said this is slow and boring and they hated it because Harry Conick Jr. didn't end up with swank in the end are just ignorant in my book. I was actually pleased that the two characters didn't end up together, just friends seemed way more appropriate.

""Oh no -- here comes cheesiness...""

I felt guilty for looking down on this movie before even watching it, because after thoroughly enjoying it I realized how wrong a person can be when he or she jumps to naive conclusions.

Is this story cheesy? In many ways, yes. Movies of this sort usually are.

BUT -- the reason why this movie overcomes its groan factor is because Hillary Swank and Gerard Butler are so believable. I didn't think they'd have much chemistry, but they make the story work.

I won't ruin the movie for you, but it's a cute story that leaves one with pangs of longing for something beautifully similar to happen to herself.

3021175,4,B000YAA68C,"`P.S. I Love You' is a strange film in that it manages to be both funny and sad at the same time.

When Holly loses her husband, Gerry, to a brain tumour she really struggles to come to terms with her loss.  Then on her 30th birthday she receives the first of many letters from Gerry that he wrote before he died.  These comfort and guide her through her grief and set her back on the path of her life again.

This film has some genuinely funny moments, some of which come from Lisa Kudrow, and one minute you will be feeling choked up from a particular scene, only to be laughing in the next.  Swank is ok as Holly and Gerard Butler is good as Gerry, but I have to say one of the stronger performances comes from Kathy Bates, which is no surprise whatsoever as she always is a class actress.

This has some wonderful flash backs of Holly and Gerry's early relationship and some of the surprise's he springs on her in the letters are poignant and heartfelt.  This is a bit of a `chick flick' (which is no criticism, more an observation), but it is done very well and despite being a little over-long, it is a touching enough film with an original storyline to keep you interested.  Some parts of this film are superfluous (like Harry Connick Jr's character who could easily be cut with no loss to the film), but I guess they add an extra dimension that would otherwise be lacking.

All in all this is an engaging and reasonably emotional film and it's gentleness is offset by it's humour, which makes for an entertaining combination.  This is worth a viewing at some point and makes a nice way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon.

A few weeks after he passes away, Holly gets the first surprise in the mail, and each surprise leads to another letter from her deceased husband. Some of Gerry's messages force her to go out and spend time with her friends, thereby taking her out of mourning and letting her enjoy everything beautiful about life that she had forgotten about.

Indeed, I thought it was a beautiful story. I know some reviewers said it was very predictable, and while you do get the idea that Holly is slowly moving on to bigger and better things, the story is not that obvious otherwise. At times, Holly feels like relapsing and going back to depression; at other times, we find out a surprise about herself or one of her friends. People who love romantic comedies will find this movie adorable; people who do not will still find it bearable.

And the concept behind what Gerry did is great too. Surprises for a sad person can be helpful in lifting them up. And while you shouldn't cling on to the past too tightly, letters from a loved one who is gone are a wonderful keepsake to remember them.",1299974400,,1232,4.520179372197309

Kathy Bates (mom) could have added a badly-needed element of depth to show Swank's journey through grief.  Lisa Kudrow, as Hilary's pal, was a shallow one-dimensional character who was ruthlessly looking for a man to marry - another misfire which could have been developed to add depth and contrast to Swank's grieving process if her character had been better developed.

Before he dies, Gerry Kennedy (Gerard Butler) - the pluckiest victim of a brain tumor since the stiff-upper-lipped Bette Davis faced-down a similar fate in ""Dark Victory"" - comes up with an ingenious way to continue giving Holly (Hilary Swank), his soon-to-be widow, advice from beyond the grave.  He composes a series of upbeat letters to be delivered to her at regular intervals after he`s gone - missives that contain specific instructions on how to pick up the pieces of her shattered world and move on with her life.  You see, Holly was kind of an uptight stick-in-the-mud when they were married, and now the too-good-to-be-true, happy-go-lucky Irishman wants to loosen her up by getting her to perform karaoke, sending her on an all-expenses-paid trip to the place of his birth, and encouraging her to become a cobbler (I kid you not).  But will Gerry's continued presence in his widow's life actually retard her ability to let go of the past and start anew?  And does this ""Ghost"" knockoff stand a ghost of a chance of becoming as universally beloved as that earlier husband-hanging-around-after-death romantic classic?

Beyond the cringe-inducing creepiness of its premise, ""P.S. I Love You,"" based on the novel by Cecilia Ahern, is one of those annoying romantic comedies in which the women get all goofy, frisky and/or tongue-tied the moment some good-looking guy so much as steps into their line of vision.  Moreover, Gerry is portrayed as such a saintly figure, both before his demise and most definitely thereafter, that we never get to know him as a real, flesh-and-blood person in his own right; instead, in order to make all the ladies in the audience swoon over his magnificent romantic spirit - one, I might add, that no man in the real world has the slightest hope of ever living up to - writer/director Richard LaGravenese has seen fit to deprive Gerry of all those flaws each of us is entitled to just for being a member of the human race - and which are truly the only things that make a character interesting in the end.  And with that crucial dimension missing from the couple's relationship, we soon lose interest in Holly as well.  And, of course, the movie cheats by having Gerry's illness take place entirely off-camera, so as not to disturb the light romantic tone of the piece, but it does little to make us care about the couple.  The movie finally hits on some honest sentiment round about the 115-minute mark, and the story does avoid going down one painfully obvious narrative pathway towards the end, but, by that time, it's much too late to undo the damage.

A large cast of well-known and talented actors - Kathy Bates, Lisa Kudrow, Harry Connick Jr., among them - do yeomen work with poorly written parts, but it's an uphill slog against bathos, pratfalls and contrivance all the way.

3021331,5,B000YAA68C,"SPOILER WARNING:  Do not read this review if you don't want to be spoiled!

I just got finished watching this movie that I just rented here on Amazon.  Gerard Butler is one of my favorite actors of all time. Actually because of The Phantom of the Opera, he is my favorite actor of all time.  This was one of very few of his that I never seen before so I had to see it.

This film is a very, very sad film and it made me cry actually.  The very beginning of the film, you see that Gerard Butler has died and I couldn't believe how quick it was into the film.  Not even ten minutes and he's gone.  I really loved how it showed her grief for him and you could tell how much she really loved him.  He obviously really loved her too to go through the act of having her mother send her all the letters from him which you don't learn it's from her until the end of the film.  I loved all the flashbacks and I really started to cry from that moment when she returns from Ireland and go to her mother and cries and they go to the park and she gets the last letter and has Connick Jr.  read aloud the last letter.  What's written in the last letter is so sad and emotional.

To be honest, I never knew before I saw this film that Gerard dies in the beginning.  I never knew the plot and obviously never read the book.  So I was really expecting a romantic comedy and thought they would be together in the end.  But I was wrong and even though it's not what I expected, the fact that this film was able to move me, make me cry and I could relate to how she was in the grieving sense, I highly recommend at least a rental.  It's very emotional and sad.  I really enjoyed it.  And Ireland's scenery is gorgeous!",1273708800,2,1698,4.014925373134329
3021332,4,B000YAA68C,"The best parts of this film were the scenes with Butler and Swank together -- both before his death and afterward via flashback.  Especially fresh was the scene when they first meet in Ireland (via flashback), and when Swank meets Butler's parents.  I would have liked to see the couple's relationship develop from the beginning, rather than using a contrived death and the business with the constant letters, which to me, got in the way of how these characters actually felt toward each other.  When one tells a story it is usually recommended as being more effective when one shows how, rather than tells how.....and the letters made it into a story that is told rather than one that is shown...the flashbacks SHOW how their romance began, and that is why they are so appealing and interesting.  Butler and Swank have plenty of star power, sex appeal, and certainly the acting chops for these roles.  The contrived letters took up so much time that I finished the film wishing it had had a more conventional plot.....if she had gone over to Ireland to see him before their marriage, meet his family, and so on, the actors had enough skill to make that fresh and new, but perhaps that has been done to death; at least they did not make the Irish look like yokels or buffoons; Gerry's parents seemed incredibly real, open, considerate, and sweet, and it would have been interesting to see Gerry with his parents, but we are not given that chance.  And Swank's delight in realizing that they did not hate her for ""taking Gerry away from them"" to live stateside was quite nice and refreshing.  None of the ""Meet the Fokkers"" stale stupidity in these scenes whatsoever.  Also the ending, where Swank and Bates arrive in Ireland was nifty.  Why did they not do more of that, develop that?  Instead we got the usual ditsy Lisa Kudrow (not my favorite) doing her usual innane thing -- who wants to watch Kudrow when you have Swank and Butler?  They only acted together for about 15 minutes at the beginning and end.  I just felt the plot was contrived to squeeze as many tears out of the audience as possible and I was hoping for more showing how their relationship developed.  Hope to see Butler in many more romantic comedies.  His comedic, romantic skills are SO appealing and his talents wasted in action flicks (300?  DOH!!  So ridiculous.)  I thought Swank was credible in a feminine lead, however, except in the flashback scene in Ireland at the end where they first meet, she seems mostly cranky in her scenes with Butler, which makes one wonder why his character would put up with her, since she seems to spend most of her time complaining and picking fights.  Why would such a happy-go-lucky guy like Gerry even stay with someone who constantly finds fault?  She was so sweet and open when they first met in Ireland, and willing to go along with the mad-dog story Gerry was giving her even though she knew the sheep dog was tame.....it would have been cute to go more with that lightness.  I would also have loved to see how her shoe designs grew out of her life with Gerry and her delight in him....  Kathy Bates was terrific; Harry Connick creepy -- a weird character who one minute was acting logically, and loaded with self-respect and a clear view of himself, and the next blurting innanities and acting depressed and self-defeating.  Why was his character even IN the film?  I cannot see how his character moved the plot forward at all.  Just some thoughts.",1273449600,2,3467,4.636661211129296

3021336,5,B000YAA68C,"I got sucked into this movie when it was recently broadcast on TV - I had read some terrible reviews when it came out, didn't like the previews, and wasn't interested in seeing it at all.  I think the music initially captured my attention the other night on TV but I was drawn into this movie and loved it.  A weepy that's for sure, and while very funny at times, I would not say it's a romantic comedy.  Reflecting on the movie I can see that the supporting characters are not very three dimensional, and of course it's all rather unbelievable if you think about it too much, but the acting was great, music great, I bought it all the whole time I was watching.  It does make you think about your relationships with friends and spouse, and think about how you treat people in life as if they are always going to be there until suddenly they are not.  For a supposedly light weight film, that's pretty good.  I didn't find it creepy or icky as some people have - I thought it was thought provoking in questioning what  is the ""best"" or ""right"" way to deal with the death of a loved one.  And I'm buying the film because I'd like to watch it again, experience the characters again, and hear the great music and see great shots of Ireland.",1270771200,2,1237,4.301724137931035

With that backdrop, I was very pleasantly surprised by this film.  I underestimated the impact of the Hillary Swank Likability Quotient.  [Her inherent likability being one of the big factors in her two Oscar wins.]  The opening scene of the movie is a revelation - a very well done 10-minute or so extended dialogue between Swank and Butler that presents the current state of their relationship about 11 years in.  The movie then goes forwards and backwards in time from there.  The quality of the acting is set in that first scene though - Hillary Swank's uncommon attractiveness and standout acting together with Gerard Butler's charm and ease of manner make for real chemistry.  As compared to, say, the fairly dreadful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Did-You-Hear-About-the-Morgans/dp/B0021L8UZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Did You Hear About the Morgans?</a>&nbsp;where I wouldn't have imagined Sarah Jessica Parker and Hugh Grant's characters together in a thousand years, you could fully envisage these two as a couple.  LaGravenese only strengthens that by providing you the back story of their relationship as the movie progresses.  When you finally get back to when the two characters first meet, you can see how and why Butler was immediately smitten.

One casting note: Gerard Butler and Jeffrey Dean Morgan - a Scot and Yank respectively - are the two leading Irishmen.  Seriously?  They're both good, but not a single Irishman could be rounded up for either of these roles?

The DVD Extras were a bit disappointing - no ""making of"" vignette (a little odd - usually a sign of people disassociating themselves from a film of questionable quality, which can't be the case here).  But kudos for a neat little (and kitschy) primer on ""The Name of the Game is Snaps.""

I also have to make a snarky comment about the summary of the movie on the DVD sleeve found inside my red envelope (hint, hint).  The first line of the summary states that Swank's character is Dublin-based.  Huh? Do these synopsis-izers even watch these movies?",1270512000,2,2978,6.275184275184275

The thought of receiving frequent letters from your dead partner over the space of a year after his death is a slap in the face for grief, common sense and mental health.  That a reviewer (someone from 'Westwood One' - who the heck are they ?) endorsement on the front cover of the Blu-Ray is quoted as describing this as 'The best romantic comedy in a very long time' defies belief ! If I had been able to see that sole 'official' review on the case I would never have made the purchase.  Remember, if they can only get a positive review for publicity from someone/somewhere you've never heard of, caveat emptor applies. BEWARE !

This movie is neither romantic nor remotely funny.  The Amazon official review warns you to have tissues on standby - they are not for tears, rather your stomach contents as you wade your way through this tasteless and unfunny film.  Did it even have a theatrical release ?  I'd be surprised, as in my opinion, it doesn't even deserve a straight to DVD release.

There seems little point in commenting on the acting as the script and concept are so repugnant you don't even notice the actors that much.

Not only was this tasteless it was also extremely boring.  How this could be described as a romantic comedy is beyond my comprehension.  How others can swoon over it is also beyond my understanding, as this film trawls the bottom-of-the-genuinely-tasteless barrel.

A feel good chick-flick where the heroine moves out of a rut, wins self-respect and becomes a better person for surviving pain.

A naked man backside parades across the screen and Lisa Kudrow's character plays the field like a talented trout fisherwoman...(is that PC?) tossing bait out and whipping it back, moving with the current til the prize fish bites.

This is what I liked about it:
1. The story was mostly about Holly and Gerry, and was not the context of her next relationship.
2. I worried that his letters would only cause her to hold to his memory all the more, but was pleased to see how they freed her to continue her life.
3. Her grieving process was real. At the risk of sounding morbid, I have to say it pleased me to see her go through intense grief. It made her character more real and likable and also gave credit to the strength of their marriage.

This is why I only gave it three stars (if I could have given it a rating of 3.5, I would have):
1. This is a minor one--all those designer clothes from eBay? Yeah right.
2. (Spoiler alert) She does have a bit of a fling in the middle. Not to be a prude but I didn't really see it as adding anything to the story except for giving it a sex scene.",1245196800,2,1078,4.0093023255813955

They try to imply complex relationships but in the arguments I always end up siding with the guys because the women ""don't know what they want"" (as stated by female protagonist). I have to admit, it was genius giving the new love interest turrets so it wouldn't be socially unacceptable for him to move in on a widow.

3021623,5,B000YAA68C,"It's been a LONG time since I've been this enchanted with a film.
Due to the sappy trailers, I avoided it on cable for months, but
finally sat down and watched it from beginning to end. Ever since
that first viewing, I've been hooked. I laugh every time, I cry every
time, I sit in awe every time, and enjoy each and every minute of this
lovely film, which I have since purchased on DVD.

What's to love? The movie seamlessly blends the story of the main
characters and their past with little confusion. The editing is almost
perfect. The cast is brilliant. Highest marks go to Gerard Butler and
Jeffrey Dean Morgan for their mastery of the dialect and their unbelievable
good looks and charm, as well as Harry Connick Jr., who nails the part of
the goofy, socially-challenged bartender. Though not a ravishing beauty,
Hillary Swank's performance is sympathetic and convincing, and Lisa
Kudrow and Gina Gershon are superb as her supportive sidekicks. Kathy
Bates also delivers a seamless performance as the grieving widow's mother.

What else is there to love? The movie's beautiful scenery. New York and glorious
Ireland are themselves characters in this lovely tale. I am also very partial
to the movie's soundtrack, the theme of which is bittersweet and romantic. Most
of all, you will love the film's whimsical and lighthearted approach to themes
that universally touch us all:  themes of love and loss, anger and confusion,
friendship and family, hope and despair. The storyline may be somewhat
implausible and there may be no husband on earth as charming and quiescent as
Gerard Butler's Gerry, but the mere suggestion that a man like he exists and that
the love he shares with Holly trancends his tragic death is worth the price of admission.

You don't have to be a ""chick"" or a sentimental sap to enjoy this movie. What you do need
is a heart. This film will surely touch it in all the right places. Five Stars!",1235174400,6,1920,4.7395209580838324

3021625,5,B000YAA68C,"How this movie escaped public acclaim in theater release is mysterious. Cute, intelligently romantic comedies usually find an audience before they are released to DVD. Although $53 million is a decent box office  gross (Notting Hill did twice that) almost no one ever saw this gem until it hit HBO. Experiencing it in 1080i made me convinced that 1080p would be spectacular and I was not disappointed.

The Irish scenes in particular, with their fields of wildflowers and greening meadows, are almost dreamlike. Such  cinematographic romanticism as a set for a tale of true love and discovery, makes PS I Love You a necessary buy for any decent Blu-ray library.",1234569600,3,661,4.990909090909091

3021627,5,B000YAA68C,"Great film by all means. Very romantic and sad at the same time.

Its about an American girl who was married to an Irish guy (Jerry) and they were both so much in love. Then, at the age of 35 he passed away from brain tumor.

Their relationship didn't end at that point. Before he died he prepared to her many letters that were planned to be sent in future dates. Letters asking her to sing at the Karoake (which she feared), reminding her of their beautiful moments together, planning trips for her with her friends, bringing her back to the place where they first met, and asking her to move on and fall in love with someone else.

She couldn't move on because she can't love anyone besides Jerry. She felt lonely many times. Her father left her and her mom at the age of 14, which made her promise herself to not be with any guy ever. Then she met Jerry who was a great man, but unfrotunately he died. She kept asking her self, why? What's the point?

In the end after facing the sad reality, she decided to move on. Actually, she probably will fall in love with that Irish singer (another guy) she met after Jerry died. We don't really know because the movie ended when she met him again in Ireland.

Quite a great film. I like it so much because at last I see a romantic movie that glorifies love between two married couple. All the other films describe love of unrelated couple, but this one was different.

Even though its sad, it teaches us the importance of being able to go one. People don't need to collapse when they lose someone they love. They need to know that this is life, and even if their loved ones have died, they are still alive in their hearts.

Wonderful movie, thumbs up",1234396800,4,1695,4.311320754716981
3021628,1,B000YAA68C,"I was very excited to see this film because I had read - and loved - the novel by Cecelia Ahern. The novel tells a charming and bittersweet story of a young Irish widow (living in Ireland) and her journey to build a new life after her husband dies of a brain tumor. The title, the character names and the device of the letters are practically the only elements of that story that remain in the film.

To begin with, the story is relocated to New York which did nothing to enhance its appeal. Americans also enjoy movies set in other locales (remember Circle of Friends, Notting Hill, Chocolat, etc.). Also, the casting of Swank did not seem to fit the Holly character portrayed in the book. For that matter, the character written for the film did not match the more spirited and likable widow of the book. Overall the screenplay was poorly written and the extensive rewriting made what had been an uplifting story more of a gloomy movie. In fact, the movie has a pervasive feeling of gloom (as opposed to grief). In the book, Holly and her husband had been happy together, though this does not come through as clearly in the movie. While Holly had not been as fulfilled in her work, she seemed to have been a happy person. Again, the movie Holly was quite different. I was actually relieved when it was over.

Given the glowing reviews others have posted, perhaps the movie is only terribly disappointing to those familiar with the novel. If you have read and enjoyed the book, be prepared to see an entirely different version of the story if you decide to purchase this film. You might want to Netflix it first.",1234224000,18,1612,4.517123287671233
3021629,5,B000YAA68C,"I never thought that I would say this, but `P.S. I Love You' is one of those movies that changed the way I viewed an actress, for the better.  Don't get me wrong; when Hilary Swank is on point she is ON POINT.  Just watch her stunning work in `Boys Don't Cry' or `Million Dollar Baby', both films garnered her Oscars.  The thing is, when you strip away the strength of the script or the power of the genre you have a substantial loss of talent.  Her performances in films like `Freedom Writers' or `The Core' and even `Insomnia' prove that she is not always `on point'.  That said, I was a little worried about how she'd fare with a romantic comedy (dramedy really).  I really thought she'd blow this one.

She nailed it.

I sat down to watch this movie with my wife because we are both fans of Gerard Butler (not because he's especially talented but more or less because he's nice to look at and or listen to) and we both adore the comedic talents of Lisa Kudrow.  We didn't expect too much, but what we got was a very nicely crafted tale of true love and the tragedy that is grief.

Holly and Gerry are a feisty married couple who obviously adore one another despite their differences.  This is seen in the opening scene (which lasts for like ten minutes) where they fight and then make up in a rather realistic manner.  That was my initial thought going into the movie; that it seemed real, and I wasn't expecting that at all.  Next we learn that due to a bran tumor Gerry has passed on.  Holly has a very hard time dealing with this, obviously, but she has friends and relatives intent of helping her through it.  It appears though, that the only one who can save her is Gerry, who comes back into her life through a series of letters he'd written and arranged to have delivered to her over the course of the next year.  With the help of these letters Holly learns to let go and find herself again, find that nave teenager Gerry first met and fell in love with; the girl with dreams and ambitions and a bright future.

Be forewarned, `P.S. I Love You' will most likely make you cry; or at least come very close.

The acting is very well done across the board.  Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon are both wonderful as Holly's closest friends.  I only wish that they had a little more screen time.  Kathy Bates is always wonderful, and her portrayal of Holly's protective mother is very genuine and moving.  I am not a huge fan of Harry Connick Jr., but he manages to be entertaining here.  I feel that his character was a little insensitive and rather unlikable at times, but it was what they were going for and he nailed it.

The stars of the show here are Swank and Butler who just ooze forth with chemistry that I didn't see coming.  We all know that Gerard Butler is a major dreamboat complete with a nice physic, an accent and loads of charm; but who would have thought that he was such a compelling actor?  He really nails his character inside and out and makes Gerry one of the most appealing men on screen.  I'm sure most any woman would love to have a husband like Gerry.  Swank blew me away with her mastery of her characters emotional fluctuations.  Holly is feisty one minute, giddy the next, defensive the next, heartbroken the next.  She's inspired and confused and aggravated and filled with adoration and she nails every shift, every feeling.  She gets every part of this woman right and delivers to us a complete and whole character, a person we can love and feel for.

Another thing I really appreciated about the film is that, as much as it is warm and sentimental, it never shies away from the harsh realities of grief.  Even the way that some of her friends deal with Holly, the way her mother almost resents her grieving at times, the way that Daniel can't seem to get passed the fact that there was a Gerry; the way that Denise and Sharon want to move on with their lives regardless of how that hurts Holly.  It makes for a much more realistic venture into the life of someone who has lost a loved one.

The world keeps on moving and eventually you have to catch up.

In the end I highly recommend this movie.  It is a truly above average film that understands how to make a romantic comedy that has the right amounts of dramatic tension and realism to make it more than just another genre film.  As far as these types of films go, this is truly one of the best.  This is a film that could easily get passed over by those who consider it just another one of many, but it rises to the challenge and becomes something much better than expected.",1233878400,5,4563,4.342384887839433

3021678,3,B000YAA68C,"""P.S.

To help Holly deal with her grief, Gerry arranges for a series of special gifts and letters to be delivered to Holly after his death. With the help of her family and a few girlfriends, Holly begin to lift herself out of her depression and embrace the chapters of her life that have yet to come.

This is a sweet story that's romantic and incredibly bittersweet. The movie includes many flashbacks that depict the life Holly and Gerry shared together, which are touching and allow the audience to connect with Holly and feel her pain. There are also several beautiful sequences shot in Ireland and a strong group of supporting cast members. Obviously, so much of the film's events are incredibly unrealistic, and I also didn't care at all for Holly's relationship with the oddball David (Harry Connick, Jr.), but fortunately the film resolved that subplot very well toward the end of the film.

P.S. I LOVE YOU is one of those films that falls firmly into the ""chick-flick"" category. The story surrounds the grieving widow, her mother, and her friends, and how they all come together to help heal after the death of the studly husband. Sound schmaltzy for you guys out there? It might be.

But it is unique for a couple of reasons...

First is that one of the main characters, Gerry (Gerard Butler,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300/dp/B000Q6GX5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300</a>) is dead. Although we meet him for a brief moment early on and during a series of flashbacks, he is, in essence, not there. We also don't get to watch him die. The death is startlingly quick, and it jerks the viewer to full attention because it is this sudden loss we see and feel via Gerry's wife, Holly (Hillary Swank,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freedom-Writers/dp/B000OONQ8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freedom Writers</a>), who also senses the loss of Gerry as extremely sudden -- due to a brain tumor, or so we're told.

The other interesting thing is that Holly learns more about her husband after his death than during their short marriage. She travels to Ireland (where they initially met) at the behest of Gerry who, during his illness, arranged for Holly to have a life after his demise. He does this post-mortem trickery by arranging for messages to be dropped off to her at various times and from various people around New York. Initially seeming to be macabre, the story rapidly evolves into ...something more. Holly's trip to Ireland with her two best friends Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon) reveal to Holly that there's a lot more life out there after losing your soul-mate. And she finds it in unique and disturbing places.

Another unique quality was that Holly's mother, Patricia (Kathy Bates,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Compass/dp/B00139XZF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Compass</a>) turned out to be an accomplice within the entire story's machinations, something that took even me by surprise. Pleasantly. I also enjoyed the eventual dead-end relationship Holly ended up having with Daniel (Harry Connick Jr.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Iron-Giant/dp/B00009M9BK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Iron Giant</a>) that I thought would turn out very differently. And Holly's Ireland love interest, William (the hunky Jeffrey Dean Morgan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Weeds/dp/B0018B7E8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Weeds</a>) figures heavily in Holly's past and, possibly, her future.

But even with all of this uniqueness, the story as a whole turns out fairly predictable. The grieving widow heals (albeit unusually), friends help her, mother helps her, and new friends and lovers make her grope for reason and what her life now means. It is schmaltzy, so just be prepared for that. Your wives and girlfriends will probably love it if you rent it for them, though.",1229990400,2,3165,6.165532879818594

This movie has the night coverd ;)",1229558400,,335,5.166666666666667
3021722,2,B000YAA68C,"I really need to stop watching romantic comedies at 3 a.m. My last gander was the 2007 chick flick P.S. I Love You, starring Oscar winner Hillary Swank and 300 hunk Gerard Butler. Why do I bother?

Holly (Swank) and Gerry (Butler) live in a small New York apartment and argue like normal couples, but they truly have a great life and love at heart. When Gerry dies from a brain tumor, Holly struggles with his death despite help from her family and friends. Shortly thereafter, on her 30th birthday, Holly begins to receive predated letters from Gerry. These treasures help her remember the good times, make new experiences, and find herself again.

She has had many an out there role, from The Next Karate Kid to Boys Don't Cry, but I wonder what it was that drew Hillary Swank to this role. Holly is by no means a pretty part. For some reason the character dresses like an idiot, and there's a lot of crying and why questions ala Nancy Kerrigan and the whole knee bashing thing. I can see the emotion in the grief and overcoming the death of a loved one, but for personal reasons alone, not from Swank's trying. I don't know what I'd do without my husband. Do I care if Holly gets over Gerry? Not really. She's given plenty of opportunity to do so, and after chance after chance, not only did I not care, but I wanted to smack Holly to her senses. Why Hillary, why?

P.S. I Love You was hyped largely as the next big thing after Gerard Butler's success in 300. I understand his not wanting to be typecast, and his work prior to 300 was quite diverse, from Dracula 2000 to The Phantom of the Opera. I just find this film of all the choices, to be so...weird. Some girls may be charmed by all the romance and such, yadda yadda, but otherwise, this is a very unflattering role. His singing is wrong here, and there isn't an Irish actor out there to fill our Irish onscreen Gerry's shoes? Not only is the whole `dead Gerry' and Gerry Butler vibe a little creepy, but he disappears halfway through the film-before the last letter arrives. I don't get it. Butler has one scene before the opening credits, then spends the rest of the film in flashbacks or as figments of Holly's imagination. It's as if the performance technically doesn't exist. Star Trek fans complain if an entire episode is a dream or a big reset button. It's not as if the ghost of Holly's dead husband is really haunting her, that would be worthwhile I think, ala The Ghost and Mrs. Muir. It would have to be funny, not serious, Ghost cornered that. I just don't see the appeal of a film that turned out to be a complete misstep for both leads. Why Gerry why?

Not only have the two leads been unfortunately miscast, but the absolutely stunning supporting cast of P.S. I Love You has been completely wasted. Oscar winner Kathy Bates (Misery) receives her token obligatory weepy scenes as Holly's mom Patricia, and Gina Gershon (Bound) and James Marsters (Spike, People! Spike!) disappear from the film with no explanation whatsoever. We get a tacked on reunion with Lisa Kudrow (Friends) and a cop out at Yankee Stadium with Harry Connick, Jr.(Copycat). I found myself more interested in these fine supporting players and their complex relationships, but their trials and troubles are dropped in favor of Holly's obvious and typical story. The eclectic mix has the comedic and dramatic-and heck musical-talent needed, but it's never used by writer Steven Rogers (Hope Floats) and director Richard LaGravenese (The Fisher King, Freedom Writers, and The Bridges of Madison County).

It's not woeful leads and misused support, however, that undoes P.S. I Love You- it's the whole dang story from author Cecelia Ahem. Maybe the movie took its liberties from the source novel, but I'm certainly not rushing down the street to Borders to get the book, that's for damn sure. The bemoaning of Holly just goes on and on. As I said, grief is something everyone can relate to, but enough with the letters already. They are too obvious and convenient. The first message is on a tape recorder. Why aren't all the others? In this day and age, Gerry couldn't videotape himself and email it to Holly everyday? How is she really expected to get over her dead husband if new information and good memories of him are technically coming from him after death?

Gerry and Holly are so poor, but he can plan elaborate bar trips and vacays to Ireland? And all this while dying of a brain tumor over the course of one year? The soul searching of what grief can do to one person is undone by the unrealistic nature of the story's plan. Never mind the horrid soundtrack and all that omigod chick stuff about turning thirty, marriage, divorce, babies, and looks. And after all this, how does Holly get on with her life? By designing shoes! Could you alienate the male audience more? I can't believe guys wrote and directed this.

Fans of the cast will tune in for P.S. I Love You, but I don't think it will be a Gerry dream for the ladies or a tour de force for Swank fans. The DVD supposedly has more scenes and interviews with Ahern-something I would normally find interesting, but I don't think its worth the full price of the disc. Unless you are a big chick flick fan, please avoid. Fans of the individual cast are better off finding clips on youtube.",1229299200,6,5295,4.573234984193888
3021723,3,B000YAA68C,"P.S. I Love You is a sweet, teary chick flick that I kinda liked in spite of myself. I read the book that this movie was based on a few years ago, and though the movie differed significantly from the book in some key areas, I found myself enjoying it.

Here's the skinny: Young Holly is married to Gerry, an Irish musician. The two live in a cramped walk-up apartment in New York, and they are trying to save some money and ""make a plan"" to start their family.

Reality intervenes. Gerry is diagnosed with a brain tumor and passes away. Holly is adrift in grief. Then, on her 30th birthday, a cake and a small tape recorder arrive at her doorstep. It's a message from Gerry. Apparently, Gerry planned these occasional messages to her for the first year after his death.

Each message gives Holly an assignment - buy a bedside lamp, go out with her girlfriends, take a vacation, find a better job. The assignments are Gerry's way of making sure that Holly's life goes on without him. (Sweet, no?)

I thought that Swank did a good job in this film, making a sometimes inscrutable character likable and warm. Butler was wonderful as Gerry, and there was a fabulous (all too brief) performance by Jeffrey Dean Morgan that practically had me weak in the knees. Harry Connick Jr. played Daniel, Holly's long-suffering friend, pretty well, too. (Oh, and Holly's clothes were really fun! Kudos to the costumer on that one.)

To recap - this is not a tour de force. This movie will not change your life or even make you think about it that much. But it will entertain you, and you may have to grab a Kleenex for some of the scenes. Great for a night in with the girls.",1228780800,2,1659,4.444078947368421

I'm a guy who doesn't immediately label a good love story a ""chick flick"" - ANY kind of movie that is driven by character and plot can hold my interest, and the best ones prompt me to write songs. I just finished one, because certain things about ""P.S. I Love You"" made me think of my own life.

P.S - I've never seen Hilary Swank look so gorgeous.",1228780800,3,592,4.103448275862069
3021725,3,B000YAA68C,"I don't even know how to tackle THIS movie.

It was like part comedy, romance, and drama all rolled into one.

In the beginning a woman and her boyfriend argue over and over again, to the point where you think they're going to split up and go their separate ways.  The arguing wouldn't STOP!!

Then, once the guy leaves the apartment room, he comes back in with a look of forgiveness on his face, and the woman comes running up to him and hugging him, and everything is all right again.

So the first 10 minutes of film were nothing but typical relationship arguing, and then things go back to normal.

NOW the weirdness comes in.

The boyfriend supposedly dies, but for some reason, nobody was upset about that.  None of the friends, or even the girlfriend herself, were nearly as upset as you'd expect.

It was at THIS point I was wondering if maybe I was watching a comedy and all that arguing in the beginning was just something not related to the main story in the least bit.  At the funeral they played a song for the boyfriend, and it had disturbing lyrics and everyone was singing along to the words, and even laughing while doing so.  I was VERY confused.

Then one of the friends of the girlfriend kept running up to random men and asking them a few short questions, and if she didn't like the answer, she'd walk away from the men disappointed.  This was a good part, though why hit on someone after her friends boyfriend just died?  Talk about ignorant.

Then, it gets even MORE bizarre.  Apparently the boyfriend wrote a series of letters to her girlfriend before he died.  Every couple of days (or weeks) a new letter would appear to the girlfriend, and I guess the letters were written as a way for the girlfriend to cope with his death, because the letters would lead the woman to a new (many times daring) adventure, such as going to Ireland and meeting another guy.

I just didn't understand who kept sending the letters to the girlfriend if the boyfriend was dead.  He obviously knew he was going to die and knew what would be best for his girlfriend as far as happiness and moving on is concerned.  So who was sending the letters?

Also, the character who played the mom was good because she was very serious all the time, and knew all the right answers.",1228521600,2,2273,4.442028985507246

Though the movie starts out in a 10 minute argument followed by complete confusion if you haven't read a review it tackles and tugs on every emotion a movie goer should have for this type of film.  From a males perspective, it was a little tough to get into at first but the movie grows on you as it continues.  Though my wife was multiple times from the first 10 minutes on the emotions gradually grew on me as well.

The story is really about true love and how it can continue on after death.  It is also a story of a husband who over time gives his surviving wife the ability to move on with her life as she knows it.  There are times when you want to cry, laugh, smile and just think about the story of this movie and imagine that something like this really could happen.

Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank0 has lost her husband (300's Gerald Butler). As she is in mourning over his loss, she recieves letters from her dead husband. From these letters, she starts to break out of her shell of widowhood.

With the help of her Girlfriends (Gina Gersion and Lisa Kudrow) and her mom (Kathy Bates), Holly starts to live again.

It is one of those nice romantic film to share with those you love. It is a throwback to the older 1950's type films where words and images are more important than car chases and curse words.

The Cast blends together so well you could believe this story is true. Swank's Holly is so on  the money, you feel her pain and joy

This is not just another chick flix, it is a well done romantic comedy. It will tug on your heart strings..if it does, check with your doctor to make sure you have a working heart.

She is not the least bit feminine, and I think the movie makers realized this because they spent far too much time having her prance around in her undergarments trying to convince us otherwise.  She needs to eat a meal or two!  Her lisp (or overbite) was very distracting and it was an awkward performance.  Most of the time her character was whining and complaining. It was very hard to believe that her husband Jerry (the gorgeous Mr. Butler) would have ever been attracted to her.

There was a secondary story involving Harry Connick, Jr. that showed some promise.  He did a fine job of portraying a cynic, burned one too many times by the opposite sex.  His love connection with Swank's character is painfully wasted in the end.  There was a very disappointing scene in which they kiss and decide it feels like they were kissing their respective siblings.  This kind of scene has been done before and better in ""Back to the Future"".

If you feel like doing nothing other than reveling in Gerard Butler's beauty than go ahead and spend the afternoon watching this overdone, drawn out, waste of time.",1218240000,11,1399,4.759336099585062
3021852,3,B000YAA68C,"************  SPOILER  **************

First is my disclaimer:  I am indeed a ""chick"" and needed a good cry and a good laugh when I rented this.

I perpetually resist the nudges of my good girlfriends to dive into your typical girl movies.  This one, however, was too tempting to leave on the shelf.  The cast alone drew me in and I was not disappointed by their performances.  Some inconsistencies in the story, however, pockmarked them.

In the beginning of the film after Gerry has passed on it is difficult to sort out the relationships between Kudrow, Gershon, Swanks and the sister.  Holly refers to her sister by relationship, but the other two females who tag along don't seem like best friends; rather, they appear to be more like cousins, more distant sisters or friends from work.  The relationship between those three never seems believable or relatable.  Regarding the handsome one night stand, that particular scene is entirely out of context with Holly's character.  As one reviewer pointed out, why doesn't Holly, the grieving survivor of a 10 year marriage, know who her late husband's best friend is? That seems like a fairly major hole considering the role he plays later in the movie.

Apart from the above and several minor other objections, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie's ""face value"".  The couple is cute (if not exceedingly so) and witty.  Together and void of any outside influences they fit their roles well.  I enjoyed their chemistry enough to cry when Gerry died.  I also loved watching Kathy Bates as Mom.  It's very easy to imagine her as the steely eyed mother sans sugar coating that is slightly less than comforting towards her daughter, but no less devoted.

All in all, if it's that time of the month, this is a good choice.  My three stars is based almost entirely on hedonistic value and not on merit.",1217980800,,1841,4.7993630573248405

Their give-and-take marriage of nine years, could have been much more successful for Holly and Geery. After their numerous battles and continual make-ups, I became caught-up in a greatly improved story-plot.

My favorite personality was Holly played by Hilary Swank! Quite a uniquely romantic role after The Million Dollar Baby.  As this story developed, I became more enamored by Kathy Bates as Mother and the bar-tender William played by Harry Connick,Jr. After Geery's hysterical Memorial Service, the movie evolved into one great, compelling, fascinating Romantic Comedy!

The next uniquely interesting character was the Irishman, William! When Geery's carefully planned letters came to Holly, one was a suggested trip for her to travel to Ireland. There she came upon the deceased's former friend from childhood, William. Those letters continued for the first year's absence of her Beloved. Her three close girl friends insisted she was overdue for another sexually stimulating experience! For me it was a close tie between the romantic escapade and the beauty of the Irish country side.

All-in-all this was the most compelling, entertaining, and fascinating romantic comedy yet for me. I recommend this fascinating comedy. Retired Chaplain Fred W. Hood",1217116800,2,1359,5.550724637681159

3021889,4,B000YAA68C,"P.S.: I Love You is a good love story. I know, it's a chick flick. Well, it's a chick flick that has something to offer guys. Gerard Butler (300) is not exactly your soap-opera-idol type, nor is Hilary Swank (Million Dollar Baby). It's an interesting match, and makes for enjoyable interaction, both playful and feisty. Oh, did I mention that one of the couple dies in the first act?

Hold on. I didn't just ruin the movie for you. That's the main point: Gerry (Gerard Butler) is dying, so he clandestinely writes a stack of letters to his wife, Holly, each ending with, ""P.S.: I love you."" Then he has someone send them to her one-at-a-time over the course of a year. The letters guide Holly into a new life. And they provide writer-director Richard LaGravenese (Freedom Writers, Horse Whisperer) with a vehicle for doing a ton of flashbacks between Gerry and Holly. It's quite effective.

This is a comedy, and it is very funny. For the most part, Gerry's the funny man and Holly's the straight person. Gerry's a sly Irishman that knows how to wheedle; and Holly's a determined career woman that doesn't have a clue what she wants. As a matter of fact, Gerry asks her point-blank: ""What do you want?"" It is a poignant question that permeates the film. As Gerry holds his discontented wife in his arms, he says, "" I know what I want, 'cause I'm holding it in my hands. Do you?"" She doesn't. And it takes Gerry's death for her to figure that out.

Using post mortem love letters to reveal Gerry and Holly's relationship is quite clever. It is fun getting to know this off-the-wall couple: Gerry, an Irish musician, who is the life of the party and brings humor even to his own death; and Holly, the cautious and pensive artist, questioning everything and offering pithy observations. We see that they love each other very much; but, like many of us, Holly doesn't appreciate what she has until he's gone. Fortunately, she gets a second chance with Gerry's letters; and, predictably, over the course of the film, Holly realizes what she is missing and what she now wants.

The journey that Holly takes is painful for her, but fun for us. Most women will find it difficult to hold back the tears. But woven throughout are funny, even hilarious, moments, especially because of Holly's two wacky friends, played by Lisa Kudrow (Friends) and Gina Gershon (Rescue Me). Also, Harry Connick, Jr. plays an utter dork - but a philosophical one; Kathy Bates is Holly's practical mother - but a kind-hearted one; and Jeffrey Dean Morgan becomes Holly's new love interest - all entertaining performances.

Obviously, this isn't the first time the subject of what women want has been breached. Back in 2000, a film by that title, starring Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt, made a half-hearted though entertaining effort at answering that question. Advertising creative Mel Gibson miraculously acquires the ability to read women's minds, which leads him to believe he now knows what they want, and can turn that knowledge to his advantage. However, he is mistaken because - as Holly points out to Harry Connick's character in P.S.: I Love You - even women themselves don't know what they want. So, even if men could read their minds - as many women seem to think we should - that still wouldn't help. No, like women's handbags of generations past, women's minds will always and forever remain mysteries, and rightly so; until God chooses to reveal them, which, I predict, will leave a lot of guys with perplexing looks on their faces and uttering, ""You've got to be kidding."" I'm sure I will be one of them.

Gerard Butler and Hilary Swank are wonderful in P.S.: I Love You. Butler, who typically switches between action hero (300, Beowulf And Grendel, Tomb Raider: Cradle Of Life) and romantic lead (Phantom Of The Opera, Dear Frankie), has his best romantic role to date in this film. This is also the first time since Phantom that he has been able to show off his musical abilities. And, even though he's from Scotland, he is really Irish, so he has that going for him as well. But, don't expect him to have those abs from 300 - they are long gone.

Swank is a two-time Academy Award-Winning Best Actress: Boys Don't Cry (1999) and Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby (2004). She loves the outdoors (sky diving, river rafting and skiing), which makes her perfect for the scenes in Ireland - a very outdoorsy country and my favorite part of the movie, especially her scenes with Gerry. Swank is honey and vinegar personified - exactly what the good-natured Gerry needs and, between the two of them, the right chemistry for this romantic comedy.

If someone were to ask me, ""What do women want,"" I would say, ""I know what they need: a good pair of practical shoes. What they probably want is the most impractical, outrageous pair of designer shoes out there."" I would have said that before watching P.S.: I Love You. Now that I've seen it, it is extremely interesting to me that shoes do play an important role in this film, and in Holly's figuring out what she wants. If women ever did discover the joys and comforts of practical footwear, there would be a revolution. Suddenly, they would know exactly what they wanted, and there would no longer be a need for Hollywood, New York or Paris. I don't think that's going to happen in my lifetime.

The parent/child relationships are complicated - also realistic.  I highly recommend this movie.",1216857600,2,414,4.971014492753623
3021891,4,B000YAA68C,"Gerry and Holly married while they were young and free of worries. Years later they feel the pressure as the reality of marriage and all it entails kicks in. The scene starts off with Gerry (Gerard Butler) and Holly (Hillary Swank) emerging from the subway walking towards their home. The couple is arguing about their different views on life with emphasis on children, money and getting their dream home. The argument heats up to the point where Gerry storms out and quickly rushes back in and they fell in each other's arms and make wild, passionate love.

The credit rolls in and the next scene is that of Gerry's wake. The viewers are told that he has died of brain tumour at the young age of 35. The next three weeks see a decline in Holly as we see her spiralling down, crying and watching black and white movies, suffering from hallucinations of her late husband. Then as she sings along to Judy Garland, her mother (Kathy Bates) and best friends (Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon) walk in reminding her that it was her 30th birthday. They open a cake from Gerry and Holly thinks it's a prank until they play the accompanying tape recorder where Gerry tells her of his plan for her, how he has written letters which will arrive on various occasions. Those letters become a source of strength for her as she follows his advice and finds herself doing things she would never have thought herself. While Gerry has planned for the letters to serve as a guide for Holly to figure out what she wants in life, they serve as a way for the viewers to find out more about the couple and their beginnings.

The tasks include a trip to Ireland where we are treated to a spectacular view of the countryside and Ireland's splendor come to life. Here we see Holly meet another Irishman who turns out to be an old friend of Gerry's. We find out about her first meeting with Gerry and it is one of those moments that make a romantic movie truly heartmelting. Hillary Swank portrays the grieving and lost widow quite well and the supporting characters were good and added some much needed laughter.  The highlight for me though was Gerard Butler who was just truly charming. I think I am now officially a drooling fan. That smile is enough to weaken any woman's knees and any woman would understand how Holly could have fallen in love with a perfect stranger. I thought he was great as King Leonidas in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B000QXDEDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300 (Full Screen Edition)</a>&nbsp;yelling out ""This is Sparta!"" in his almost naked glory. But now he has been elevated to real sweetheart material after seeing him in this movie. And God I love a man who can sing.

P.S. I LOVE YOU, while far from perfect, is more than your average run-of-the-mill romantic movie.  While I find that the whole letters after death thing lacked plausibility (the cynical may even find it creepy), the idea is simply clever.

I am the type of female moviegoer who didn't see any problem with Sean Connery playing the Mufti in The Wind and the Lion because he looked so good doing it.  Gerard Butler in this role is just as mesmerizing and intoxicating and is able to muster an Irish accent part of the time. There is also more eye candy.  Not since Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands have I felt guilty at having fun watching a movie about a grieving widow.  It is a comedy, isn't it.

It is not a perfect film, but it is enjoyable for all the emotional buttons it push and how it tickles the mind.  I loved the casting. Hilary Swank should do more comedy.  Her voice is suited to it.  It was fun to James Marsters being human and American. Nellie McKay is wonderful. The line --There is no such thing as a vampire slayer - might not be the funniest line but it tickled. The production value is high.  I enjoyed most of the sound track. A couple of married men saw it with their wives and each recommended it to me on separate occasions.  The message of holistic love about life is fruit for thought.  Yes, I did cry a little.  Also, I am giving the game of Snaps a try as a party game. Oh, this movie introduced me to the beautiful songs of Laura Izibor.

If you needed a theme to match other movies with this, I would pick some of the old ones Holly watches.  You could have a letter theme and watch it with The Love Letter.

Gerry (Gerard Butler) and Holly (Hilary Swank) are married, without children, and are very much in love. Swept off her feet at a tender age by the handsome Irishman, Holly isn't exactly sure what she wants from life, and this leads to petty squabbles and extremely hot making up afterwards.

Before they really get started, the Fates snip Gerry's thread, and Holly is left with a snazzy urn and an empty apartment, which she proceeds to fill with her blue funk.

Her thirtieth birthday brings a big surprise, as it seems that for once, Gerry has made a plan.  Gerry's gift goes on giving, and gradually Holly comes to terms with her life, while we, the audience, get to look on with unbridled glee.

Butler is as easy on the eyes as always, and Swank pulls off a difficult role with apparent ease.  Lisa Kudrow is a perfect friend, and Kathy Bates proves unsinkable.  Other good performances are logged by Gina Gershon and Harry Connick Jnr.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

3021932,5,B000YAA68C,"I actually had low expectations for this movie, and I will admit that I was mainly interested in it because of Gerard Butler - he is beee-yooo-ti-ful... :)
Also, Hilary Swank is a wonderful actress, very talented, a double Oscar winner, so I figured, I would check this movie out. I am also not usually much of a chick flick watcher (even though I am a chick), I'm usually a big action adventure movie fan, intense dramas, that type of thing. I expected to have this movie on in the background, not really pay attention to it, work on other things, and only look up when Gerard Butler was on screen. So, from that perspective, this movie was a very big, very pleasant surprise.

Pretty much from the get-go, this movie grabbed my attention and lo and behold I didn't do any work at all while it was on (I tried a couple of times, but then I just had to rewind something I missed, so I happily gave up). A big part of this was the fact that I expected predictable dialogue, and a predictable story-line. A big credit to this movie belongs in the fact that it had very sharp writing, it actually dealt with things that seemed real-life. Of course there are lines here & there in the movie that are ""hollywood"", but for the most part, this movie has a lot of heart.

HUGE, HUGE, HUGE credit for this movie's heart & soul must go to Hilary Swank & Kathy Bates. These two ladies do an INCREDIBLE job in their roles, they imbue them with so much authenticity, I was really taken aback. In fact so much so, this movie actually had me crying repeatedly through it (thank heavens I didn't see this movie in public, that would have been very embarrassing & I would have most certainly run out of kleenex). Plus, it had me laughing in between! What an emotional ride this movie was, and I was somewhat prepared for ""heart-string pulling"" because I knew the premise of the movie.

In fact, it has been days since I watched this movie, and I keep thinking about it. It moved me, not only with the emotional journey of Hilary's character, what she learned, how she grew, but because it also makes you think about your own life. I find myself reflecting on my own relationships, appreciating them more, it really touched me. It also has a secondary theme about Hilary's character trying to find happiness in what she does for a living - lessons in finding your passion, and stop doing what doesn't make you happy, what you may hate, for a living.

This movie also has a measure of unexpected outcomes, which is a breath of fresh air. So many times we can predict what is going to happen, then when a movie doesn't do that, it's such a delight. This movie has lovely journeys of forgiveness, selfishness, confusion, what are our lives all about, who knows, but we keep putting one foot in front of the other.

I highly recommend this movie as a worthy watch. I loved it. And I want to visit Ireland soooo bad now!!! My heart is still tender, from the highs, the lows, the questions this movie raised. Hilary - wow, you are amazing in this role...I hope you will get the recognition you deserve for it.

I highly recommend ""PS, I love you."" Men, pass on the blood, cars and guns for once and rent this film tonight to watch with your girlfriend or wife. The evening will go well, trust me.

3021963,5,B000YAA68C,"This film takes the boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back and lives happily ever after and sets it all on its ear. The formula here is girl lives happily with boy until he's taken from her by brain cancer, whereupon she loses herself. The satisfying ending comes only when his letters, written before his death to guide her recovery, help her wade her way through their past to find her future. It's clever, funny and fresh (if you can take the leap of faith and go with it), and the cast is excellent.

Unfortunately, the extras are lacking. The most interesting to me is the deleted scene at the travel agency, the only time we see the hero while he's dying, but with his sense of humor still very much alive.

If you're in the mood to laugh a lot through a few tears, this movie is perfect for you.",1213401600,3,814,4.279220779220779
3021964,5,B000YAA68C,This movie was excellent from start to finish. To be so in love with someone and want them to realize that life goes on after you are gone is amazingly unselfish. Hilary Swank gives a truly heartwarming performance as a woman who loses the love of her life. Definitely a movie that I will add to my collection!,1213315200,3,310,4.362068965517241
3021965,5,B000YAA68C,"I simply ADORE this movie!  The fight that begins the film is what I label the perfect fight.  Holly is upset, Gerry doesn't know why, they get into an argument where both sides are coming from completely different directions with Gerry attempting to subvert Holly's anger with humor.  Which, of course as most women know, only makes her more upset.  They end up slamming doors then re-emerging to affirm how much they love each other and acknowledge the problems they have.  The most shocking part of the movie is in the next scene where Holly, her mother, sister, and friends are all at Gerry's wake.

3 of my friends went with me to see this movie on New Year's Day and we all cried through the whole film.  When we walked out of the theatre, we had plans to immediately drive to the airport and book tickets for Ireland.

First of all, being the red-blooded female that I am, Gerard Butler's character Gerry and his charming Irish accent and wonderful, sexy, sweet personality is enough to keep me interested for the 2 hours this film takes.  Second, being a fan of Grey's Anatomy, I couldn't help loving the naked rear view of Jeffrey Dean Morgan and his own charming Irish character.

But mostly what is to be loved about this film is the love Gerry had for Holly, so strong and so pure that, knowing he would die, he crafted a plan to keep Holly's life going for a year until she was able to move on on her own.  Unselfish, everlasting love.  Every couple fights, and none of them are perfect, every relationship has stresses and issues.  But, as the movie reveals, they were in love from the moment they set eyes on each other.  A love that never ended after they found the kiss that would ""end the world as they knew it forever.""  A love that wanted her to find love again and tried to make her view herself through his eyes - not seeing her flaws but the reasons for his devotion and why he wanted her life to be full for as long as she continued to be alive.

And, it's a comfort to know we don't lose Gerard Butler but continue to see clips of him throughout the film - Holly's memories played across the screen as she tries to move on with a life she felt hadn't started yet and now no longer includes the man she kept trying to start it with.

I enjoyed the acting as well.  I think Hilary Swank was very believable and her supporting cast of characters were dynamic enough to give the film the impression of a real life and what happens as lives move on and tragedies happen.  The plot was engaging throughout - I found myself anticipating Gerry's letters just as much as Holly and grieving along with her just as though I had lost my perfect, caring, charismatic soulmate too.

And I felt hope.  So many movies come along telling us stories of soulmates and second chances and following our hearts.  Some may call it clichd and overdone to the point of exhaustion.  But I say there are real-life examples of these fairytale movies, and exemplary examples such as P.S. I Love You need to be made to remind us of the hopes and emotions we experience in our everyday lives - hopes that shouldn't be abandoned because we are told to be ""realistic"" and settle for something less than we deserve.  True happiness is to be achieved by continuing our dreams, there is a reason why different people are drawn to different things.  These types of movies - disgustingly called ""Chick flicks"" - don't bring false hope, they bring out what we already feel inside and keep us motivated for the time it takes for us to figure out and pursue what we need in our lives.

This movie is sad, heartbreaking at points, but also humerous, engaging, sexy, romantic, hopeful, and realistic!  Holly can be stubborn, awkward, shy, dorky - and she's all the more human for the range of emotions and setbacks she goes through.  It's a movie of growth not just for Holly but for her family and friends as well.  People would do well to watch not for a gush of sentimentality and cathartic tears, but as a reminder of our flaws, our feelings and our dreams.

Oh, and the music is GREAT!  I bought the soundtrack just for ""Love You Till the End"" by the Pogues and ended up loving several other songs.  The Irish ""If I Leave this World Alive"" and the first track ""Everything We Had"" AND the last track ""My Sweet Song"" are lovely!  I have some new favorite music to compliment my classic 60's and 70's songs, alternative, Indie, rock, selective pop, etc.",1213315200,4,4437,4.444993819530285
3021966,4,B000YAA68C,Five years ago I became a widow.  While watching this movie I cried like a baby.  The parts where they show her feeling his touch and hearing his voice was oh so real I could relate.  Loved It!!!!,1213315200,3,196,4.105263157894737
3021967,5,B000YAA68C,I really loved this movie. When you feel like crying and laughing this is the one to watch. Love Gerard Butler.,1213228800,2,111,4.333333333333333
3021968,1,B000YAA68C,"I was very disappointed in this movie. While the male character was adorable, it left out alot of detail that would make you warm up to them as a couple. From fight to funeral! Why did they cram so much info together? I would have gladly sat thru a couple of scenes for 10 more minutes. Budget, I guess.
I would have really been lost if I hadn't known he was going to die. The family members at the funeral were difficult to recognize as again no real background info except one previous sentence about the mother. It seemed that we to infer alot, too much in my estimation.
The whole movie seemed to revolve around sex. I thought this was a love story. Once again Hollywood tries to prove a misnomer. Sex first, equals love later.
The best part of the whole movie was the end. Scrap the whole movie and start from there. Now there's a plot. A widow visiting the parents of her deceased husband and meeting someone interesting who turns out to be a close friend of her husband and for a kick her bitter mother finds love in his dad. That's a movie that would have been worth watching.",1213228800,12,1084,4.318627450980392
3021999,2,B000YAA68C,"Rarely (like, almost never) has a film come along with such a gulf between its critical reviews (ie, professionally-considered notions of 'quality') and its popular reception.  The professional film critics universally say this stinks worse than a boiled cabbage and corned beef dinner left in the sun.  Yet the reviews I received from enthusiastic friends were the polar opposite.  They laughed, they cried, they hadn't seen such a touching and memorable movie for years, they were definitely going to buy this for their own.  Letting friendship win out over criticism I rented it.  Sadly, I have to side with the critics, whose judgement about the many flaws in this film is spot-on.  Not since ""Love, Actually""  has there been such a talented cast of A-list actors put to such superficial, sitcommy use.  This often plays like an extended episode of ""Friends Go to Ireland"" and would have done even without the presence of Lisa Kudrow as one of Swank's neglected BFFs. Though there are many pretty views of Ireland and New York respectively, they are as glossy, flat and uninhabited as a postcard.  Hillary Swank is a gifted actress in tough roles, but she decidedly lacks softer qualities of vulnerablity or self-parody, both of which are pretty much obligatory for romantic dramedy heroines.  She tries very, very hard, though and is to be given credit for trying.  She also displays a very passable voice doing Judy Garland and a scene of her doing karaoke shows something of a flair for physical comedy.  The script is unsure whether to lean more heavily toward rom-com fluffiness ala ""13 Going on 30"" or pathos and winds up being an uncomfortable mish-mash of neither.  This film suffers from the same problem that hobbles all From-Beyond-the-Grave love stories: it's impossible to plug the dead spouse into the movie in any way other than flashbacks or contrived sequences where the bereaved talks to a figment in an otherwise empty room.  Though the device of daily letters from beyond the grave could be effective, the fact that they come from a free-wheeling soul who was not known to put pen to paper while he was living is a tad problematic.  Surely footloose musician Gerry might have devised other methods to communicate with his wife . . .songs, perhaps.  The problem for the audience is that we get exactly one scene with Gerry before his abrupt departure, so it's hard to really know What Would Gerry Do?  Director LaGravanese attempts to answer this question with a series of flashbacks that go chronologically backwards, so that near the end of the movie, we have come to the very beginning of Gerry and Holly's relationship.  Unfortunately at this point, LaGravanese commits a Fatal Movie Faux Pas previously seen in ""Laws of Attraction"" by having his protaganists collide in an utterly fantastical Meet Cute on the Roadside in Ireland.  Since such Meet Cutes on the Irish Roadside must hardly ever happen to actual Irish people, what are the chances that every American woman in Ireland on a tourist visa would have a Meet Cute with the likes of Gerard Butler or Pierce Brosnan?  Alas, I had already lost my ability to suspend my disbelief in this film long before this Meet Cute happened.  After a fairly promising start, ""P.S."" falls flatter than an Irish soda bread without the soda.  I give this movie two stars for the gorgeous views of Ireland and the equally gorgeous views of Gerard Butler and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, as well as some great soundtrack numbers.  Worth a rental for the legions of female Gerard Butler fans out there, though the male fans will want to skip this and rent ""300"" again instead.",1213056000,6,3633,4.862012987012987
3022000,3,B000YAA68C,"This is a pleasant romantic comedy. Gerry Butler is certainly engaging enough as the male half of the equation. Hillary Swank plays such a high-pressure female always flying off the handle and finding it hard to relax. It was hard for me to see any chemistry between her and Butler or anyone else for that matter. There are some beautiful shots of Ireland in the Blu-Ray transfer, and the sound is quite nice. The story line is based on a very comprehensive plot that Butler concocts, that I find difficult to believe he could have forseen or even afforded to pull the scheme off. The whole magilla kind of peters out in the last reel and ends fortuitously for all (almost as if the studio had to call it quits on the film and end it happily). Enjoyable, but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it (it's a date movie after all--cleverly designed to make us guys feel totally inadequate).",1212969600,3,892,4.478527607361963

The acting was not bad it but the dialog and story progression needed a lot of work.  WARNING: I WILL BE GIVING AWAY WHAT THE STORY IS MAINLY ABOUT SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW PLEASE STOP READING THIS REVIEW HERE.

3022045,5,B000YAA68C,I've read most of the reviews and as with any film they vary.  I personally loved this movie.  The cast was great!  It was a love story -- very bittersweet -- but the love the lead character had for his wife was unselfish in that he truly did understand her and believed in her enough to help her find her dreams and fulfil them.  It was a story of a mother and daughter gaining a better understanding of each other.  That was so touching.  It was a story of friends and how they are not always in the same place emotionally and that the friendship can survive the hurts with understanding.  It was a tear jerker --- but it was thought provoking too.  I will watch it again.,1212192000,2,674,4.2109375

3022069,1,B000YAA68C,"I love Swank & Butler, & Bates.
The movie begins (uncomfortably) with a very contrived fight scene that doesn't work and isn't staged well. Butler, while beautiful, only seems at home in the scene in Ireland. All the other flashbacks never work quite right.  Bates is good as the Mom, but all through the movie I felt I was missing something.
The friends setup doesn't work - there's no chemistry between Kudrow, Gershon & Swank. It always seems awkward. Also awkward was the one-night stand Swank has with Billy Gallagher. That just did not seem in keeping with her personality throughout the movie. How odd.
The kareoke scenes were TORTURE.
Literally two-hours of self-pity for a young woman who's lost her husband. Connick Jr.'s Daniel wasn't silly or unlikable enough so you end ticked off because you're led to believe they'll be together.
Not much about this movie was likable. The actor who played Billy Gallagher was very good and him telling Holly stories about Jerry was endearing. That's about the best thing I can say. And the Irish scenery was gorgeous. I can't recommend this movie.",1211932800,20,1096,4.86096256684492

Nor could I understand how good the film could be without Holly's brothers, or father. If you enjoy the film, please, please read the book. You may appreciate the story much more fully if you do.

3022074,4,B000YAA68C,"I'll start off by saying I do not enjoy melodrama or Hilary Swank in particular very much.  So, I was surprised twice by this movie, which I've watched several times with my wife.

The story focuses on Holly (Swank) as she is trying to move past her loss but is still receiving reminders of him that he had arranged to send her before his death from a tumor.  We don't see much of Gerry (Butler) while alive, but we do see him through Holly's memories and in her imagination here and there.  In the course of the movie Holly does come to terms with her loss though it never really resolves if the after-death reminders from him were a help or not.  In the end, you get the impression that they did help her, but in watching the film you can see that there is obvious pain resurrected in her each time she is confronted with them and the places they lead her.

As the lead, Hilary Swank completely delivers as Holly.  I found myself laughing and grieving with her and she brings real substance and emotion to the character of Holly.  Gerry isn't present as much, but Gerard Butler gives a solid performance as the sometimes cocky and over-sure Gerry but gives the character charm and sweetness to.  Some of the moments of chemistry between the two were some of the best I've seen in film in a while.  I don't know how they work together when the cameras weren't rolling but they delivered a solid image of your typical married couple here.

The supporting characters run the usual gambit of good and bad.  Sometimes necessary to further the plot or breath new life to the story and at other times out of place and jarring with the theme of the story.  I found a few moments where the humor they deliver is hard to take in after the sad tension of the previous scene.  However, the casting was well done with many likable actors.

P.S. I Love You ends as you would expect it to and does a fairly good job at resolving Holly and giving her a chance at future happiness.  Although, there is a sadness to the film as well, as the impression you have of Holly and Gerry together is hard to move beyond.  If you have parallels to this scenario in your own lives then I imagine this to be quite touching - for good and bad.

Ultimately, I have to recommend the film despite my previous acknowledgment that romantic drama stuff usually isn't my game.  If your girl is in for a sappy flick then you could do worse than P.S. I Love You.",1211414400,4,2425,4.337028824833703
3022075,5,B000YAA68C,I would have to say that p.s. I Love You was better then the Notebook. I Loved everything about this movie. It's Number 1 on my top favoite movies.,1211241600,4,147,4.103448275862069
3022076,3,B000YAA68C,"Ok, I like Hilary, Gerard, Kathy, Lisa, and Harry.  These are great, watchable actors, and I was so excited to see this movie.  That's problem number one- too much hype and expectations.  My little voice kept saying: ""There's something amiss when the main actor(Gerard Butler) is essentially dead.""  Especially for a kind of romantic comedy.  My little voice was somewhat right, but thank goodness for Gerard!  The first half of the movie drags, and you wait and wait only for him to return, and when he does, it's great!

The second problem is I read the reviews beforehand, and it was so up and down in opinions that the voice yelled at me again, ""Something's afoul.""  It turns out there's an edge to the movie's demeanor.  For example, Harry Connick, who should star as a wonderful lead and potential romantic type, is made into a bit of a buffoon, and you're suppose to love him for it?  In one scene, Hilary pulls him into a closet.  He tells her that he has this 'rude syndrome', that he can't filter his words, and that his girlfriend ran away with another woman, and that he was reduced to seeing hookers but now the money's run out.  Ok.  Gosh, I hope you've got enough dough leftover for your HIV tests.

Frankly, the best part of the movie takes place in Ireland.  The scenes with her girlfriends are hilarious, especially in the boat.  Now that's more like the fun escapism one expects in a 'romantic comedy'; however, *SPOILER ALERT* she quickly jumps in bed with another Irishman.  Well, her friends urged her on, and besides, she's lonely and horny and hasn't been with a man for a little while.  He turns out to have been ""Best mates"" with Gerard's character.  ""Hey, we share everything,"" the new guy says to her after the fact.  Adding, ""Oh,I didn't mean it like that.""  Well, how did you mean it?  And gee, I hope you used good American condoms.*END ALERT*
She returns home to New York and the finale is definitely more satisfying, but to get there has, at times, been a sour process.

Gerard Butler shines in any movie, anytime; Hilary Swank is fine; although, here she must portray a difficult character, who's scattered, flighty and plain annoying at times(Why does she hate her apartment? Her designer E-BAY clothes?  Her all loving, adoring man?) and also, she deals with a script that flounders.  Harry Connick just needs a decent role.  The supporting cast deliver their usual, typical performances.

Whew, so did I enjoy the flick?  I don't know.  I'm not eager to see it again.  I guess I could jump through, and play the scenes I like.  Or not.

My third problem is that I keep imaging a story about a somewhat immature, insecure and opinionated American woman who travels to Ireland and meets a freewheeling Gerard Butler-type and sparks fly, good and bad, but she's not sure what she wants and then a handsome, stud of a Harry Connick-type Amercian shows up and really confuses the whole mess.  And it all plays out to the background of the Emerald Isle and the Big Apple.  Gimmie. Maybe next time?",1211241600,8,3028,4.629699248120301

 I managed to watch it all but came away more sad than warmed, as it is a movie more about resolution and loss than about love.  The message in the film is a common one, that you should let those you love in on your secret every day, not expect that they know it.

But that's just me.

Now my wife watched all the way through yesterday with our youngest daughter, and she really liked it after all. But she is a big believer in not getting over your true love (me too, but that's not the way I saw this turn). My bigger problem was the conclusion of the film where it reminded me of when my wife's Ford Expedition was stolen, she wanted another Ford Expedition. After you watch the film you may see what I mean... I felt like the inferred afterward in the story was kind of twisted along the same line.

Not only that, it is a product of her imagination and not a true story which is even more awe inspiring! I adored this movie. I rented this movie without really knowing anything about it- I typically skip through previews or just don't pay attention so I thought this was going to be one of those where I would watch it to the middle and just have to turn it off to do something else. HOW pleasantly surprised I was that not only was I laughing at the many funny situations but the crying- yes, lots of tears because of the despair Holly felt once the love of her life was gone. If you have not seen this film, do not read further b/c I might give away too much info for you. The whole story was amazing- from how they parted to the end when they first met. I guess it has just been too long since I was impressed by a romantic comedy. Holly was a 30 year old widow that was married to her other half for 11 years before he passed away suddenly. But because her husband knew her so well, he took her on an adventure after she thought he was totally gone. PS I LOVE YOU was present throughout the film with each letter he wrote telling her what he had planned for her or for her to just look for a sign. To feel the love of your significant other from beyond was a little creepy at first but then ended up to just have so much unpredictability to it- honestly the whole story was refreshing. I normally think it is silly to buy the book after you have seen the movie first but guess where I am headed next after this review?? That's right, friends! Gonna go make myself cry again! Love it!!

Top it off with miscasting - maybe just me, but Hilary Swank is UGLY and there was ZERO chemistry between her and G. Butler.  And Kathy Bates cast as her mom? - that was just WRONG.  And the sister...first, she couldn't act and second, another complete miscast.  If the movie had a different female lead, different mom, and different sister, a rewritten script with all of the profanity thrown out the window, different camera placement, and some proper scene transitions, then maybe, maybe it would have been OK.  My better half has this aversion to movies that use FLASH CARD TIME PLATES to keep track of time. He says it is a clear sign someone didn't write the script or want to spend money/time to scout and shoot sets properly.(GREAT CONTRAST to show how it CAN BE DONE would be ""Nottinghill"").

3022094,2,B000YAA68C,"Maybe I'm biased, because I've never read the book. I didn't even know there was a book. But I do love Hilary Swank and I believe she is a wonderful actress. But this movie was horrendous. First of all, the first scene with the fighting was drawn out and predictable. I took that as a sign of how the rest of the movie would be. Yes, I finished watching the rest of movie to give it a chance, but I had to fight the urge to not get up and walk out instead. Even for a 'romantic comedy' the movie is unrealistic.

Yes, I do believe that the length of Holly's grieving time was appropriate, and so was her attitude towards Daniel. But I thought it was silly that Daniel thought he had a chance with her and it'd only been a couple of weeks...? Months? Kathy Bates as the mom sure is harsh for knowing the situation Holly is in. Though..Lisa Kudrow has moments and some great lines.
I just felt some characters and scenes weren't needed, such as putting Daniel through torture of reading a letter to him?! And then what follows after that reading made me cringe not because I didn't agree with it, but because it was just too soon...and weird given the vibe of the letter, and of Holly's newly found self-awareness.
Also, Holly and her escapade with William seemed unrealistic that it'd be somehow connected to Jerry out of all the men in Ireland. Even though this is addressed, it still gave me a gross vibe for some reason. Maybe because I felt like she was just with this man because it reminded her of Jerry.

Gerald Butler completely steals the film and all I kept waiting for was the next time he'd enter the scene. So, if you're looking for some handsome faces, then you've found the right movie. (Hence the two star rating) But besides the eye candy, I couldn't connect with Holly, I empathized with her situation, but I felt no chemistry projecting from the screen or within the actors themselves. I guess it was just missing that 'feel good' vibe that Holly feels when she realizes that can move on. But does she really move on? Or is because Jerry tells her she can?

In the end, I left empty inside still waiting for the story to really take on a meaning...and I'm usually a tear-jerker for these type of movies. I didn't feel sad. Even once.

Love between two people is universal and we all love differenly.  But the idea of arranging fun outings for the remaining spouse after the other one is long gone, is spooky if anything else.  Mourning is personal and we deal with it in our own ways and having friends and family involved in some scheduled string of fun outings is just plain weird.

3022097,3,B000YAA68C,"""P.S. I Love You"" depressed and disappointed me.  It was not the romantic comedy that the trailers and reviews led me to believe; it was too dark and depressing.  Instead, ""P.S. I Love You"" is a romantic drama that chronicles the year-long struggle of Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank of ""Million Dollar Baby"") to overcome the death of her husband Gerry (Gerard Butler of ""300"").

  Holly is constantly complaining and whining that life isn't good enough for her.  Her husband dies of a brain tumor and she's plunged into depression.  Then the letters from Gerry begin arriving.  They urge Holly to continue living her life, pursuing her dreams.  Instead, Holly clings to her dead husband even more.  When the letters finally cease arriving, it is as though he has died again.  All the while I keep hoping she will fall in love with someone, anyone, even the grungy Harry Connick, Jr.  It never happens.  In the last minute of the film, the viewer receives a glimmer of hope that she might have a lasting relationship with a handsome musician living in Ireland.

  Lisa Kudrow of ""Friends"" and Kathy Bates of ""Titanic"" help round out a great cast.  Kudrow's comic relief was depleted too soon into the movie when she found her beau.  Bates' sour faced character was stern and pious; most of the time, she was dishing out motherly advice.  She never approved of Holly's marriage.  Swank and Butler were too muscular for their roles.  It's quite obvious that they spend a lot of time working out at the gym.

  Beautiful New York skylines and Irish farmland and a great soundtrack were not enough to hold my interest.  I found myself getting bored.  ""P.S. I Love You"" dragged on and on.  One-hundred and twenty-seven minutes is too long for a romantic comedy.  When Holly received her last letter, I thought, ""Thank the Lord.  It's finally over.""  But her whining and complaining began anew.  Poor Daniel (Harry Connick, Jr. of ""Independence Day"") was her faithful lapdog throughout the ordeal.  I kept wanting to tell Holly, ""P.S. stop whining and stop complaining.  Get over your husband's death (he wasn't that good looking) and get a life.""",1210636800,5,2137,4.798898071625344

I was relieved they left out most of his illness, only showing one scene while Jerry was ill.
The music was really wonderful.  Unfortunately, in the CD Gerard's songs were not included.  His rendition of I'll Love You 'Til the End is really touching.
This is most definitely a chick flick, but guys should probably watch it for some romantic tips.
The trip to Ireland was really a nice addition to the film.  The book was placed in Ireland and so the trip was to Spain.  The producers chose to send Holly and her friends to Ireland to include it in the film and it made for a nice touch.

I agree with others that with Swank, it's hard for her to be so goofy and funny because she plays such a great serious actress in most of her films, but she delivered this role very well. This movie was a tear jerker, Gerard Butler is hot and great actor, and he does play that perfect man.

3022123,3,B000YAA68C,"Answer: Ghost.  (Well, that's one answer, there are others too, like the film Reign Over Me, with Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle doing a male perspective of similar themes.)

P.S. I love you is a film about grief.  Grieving over the loss of a loved one, in this case Hilary Swank plays Holly who we'll see remembering her husband Gerry who has passed away from a brain tumor.  Gerry apparently had time to make plans before his death and those plans revolve around leaving behind letters to Holly providing her instructions on things she must do as she moves on from her loss.

The film opens with a brief glimpse into Holly and Gerry's happy life, though at that point we're watching a lover's quarrel over discussion of their future together.  The little glimpse gives us a bit of insight into the fact that Gerry never seemed to have a plan while Holly was trying to be incredibly organized and work towards goals she had laid out for herself and them as a couple.  Seeing that initial glimpse of their relationship and that status makes Gerry's letters and the planning he has done all the more poignant.

The movie flows fairly quickly over it's just over 2 hour running time and actually does a pretty good job of not dwelling on sadness.  Yes we know that Holly is unhappy about her loss, and yes she has issues adjusting to being alone and without the love of her life, but there isn't the depression and sadness that would drag a viewer down and leave you feeling like you just wanted the movie to end.

Along the way Holly gets instructions to journey to Ireland.  We find out there, as if we didn't know from Gerry's accent in the scenes where he appears, that the couple had met in Ireland back when Holly was a student touring the world a bit as she was trying to determine what she wanted to be in life.  Apparently they fell in love at first sight, and were destined to be together always, or at least until death parted them.

Kathy Bates turns in a decent performance as Holly's mother, and other cast members perform well as Holly's sisters and friends.  The story is good, not great, but good, and the original writing shines through fairly well.  Adapted from a novel and somewhat Americanized (set in New York, rather than in Ireland), we do benefit from several beautiful scenes of the Irish countryside.

Some sexual dialogue and sparing use of language that would cause the film to earn a more adult rating, but no nudity, and little objectionable content for those concerned about such things.

Worth a rental at least.  Some may love the film and feel compelled to buy their own copy.  If you go with a disc-based copy, take a few minutes to check out the extras including a few deleted/extended scenes.  Unfortunately the deleted scenes are without introduction so viewers are left wondering where exactly they fit in the sequence of the film, but most are fairly obvious.  An introduction for each would have been nice, and one scene in particular (at the travel agency) really should have been included in some way.  Perhaps running next to the credits.  Most of the rest (outside of a reunion scene with Gina Gershon's character) are not really noticable, though that scene (with Gershon's character) probably should have made the final cut.",1210550400,6,3269,4.637152777777778

3022126,2,B000YAA68C,"This film is all about having your emotions manipulated.  If you want a good cry, if you want a film to unabashedly try to fill you with very specific emotions, then this is the film for you.  While I will acknowledge that any film is going to try to provoke a response, not many will be as unsubtle and as unapolegetic as this one.  In fact, this is all about the feeling, not at all about the story.  The only point of the story is to make the viewer experience and engage in certain emotions.  If you don't want to go along, then many parts of the film are going to be agonizing.  And you could well believe that this is one of the least artful, most clumsily produced films of recent years.  To be honest, I'm definitely not among the former.  This film simply didn't move me.  All its tactics were too obvious and heavy-handed for me to want to go along.  On the other hand, it wasn't an utter piece of crap either.  If we could give half stars I would give it 2.5.  All in all, I don't regret having seen it, but neither do I feel that it has in any way enriched my life.

I know this was based on a popular book.  I'm an obsessive reader, but quite frankly my reading all goes int other directions.  So I couldn't care less whether it does or does not remain faithful to a book that I will never read.  What are the movie's pluses and minuses?  The minuses first.  As I said above, it really doesn't have much of a story.  Or rather, the story isn't the point.  This is a mush fest.  I just didn't feel the mush.  Most of the film left me cold and disinterested.  The artifice was too obvious, the attempts to manipulate too blatant, the nuances pretty much nonexistent.  In other words, at the very heart of the film there was pretty much nothing.  The whole film struck me as hollow.

The pluses, however, are many.  Even in an age of great film soundtracks, this one stood out.  Over the opening credits they played my favorite song off the great Camera Obscura album LET'S GET OUT OF THE COUNTRY, ""Lloyd, I'm Ready to Be Heartbroken.""  Then at the wake that opened the post-credits they played the great Pogues song from IF I SHOULD FALL FROM GRACE WITH GOD, ""Fairytale of New York.""  And the music stayed interested after that.  OK, the soundtrack is superficial compared with the main story, but suferficialities can keep a film interesting even when it is at core a failure.

Visually the film was eye candy throughout, especially when it got to the scenes in Ireland.  Again, this won't substitute for a good story, but it gives you something to do when the story fails to show up.  I defy anyone not to be impressed by the verdant landscapes show in the scene where Gerry and Holly meet for the first time.

Finally, while the story isn't up to their talents, the film features a strong and interesting cast.  I've always wondered why Hillary Swank hasn't had a more interesting career than she has had.  She's had a couple of Oscar quality roles, but the quality drops off sharply after that.  Perhaps she has been hurt by the fact that in her two biggest films she played a female transsexual trying to pass for male and a boxer.  Hopefully a girlie role like this one will expand the range of roles made available to her.  Gerard Butler plays Gerry.  His career is an interesting one as well.  He's been in a surprising variety of films, but big stardom has eluded him.  He seems poised to make a leap to the A list, especially after the success of 300.  I was delighted to see James Marsters as Gerry's business partner (though it was interesting that later, when Gerry's letter was telling Holly that she needed a job that she could love, but that ""vampire slayer"" was one of them, that in her Slayer poster there were no BUFFY references -- still it was nice to see Marsters in a non-SF or fantasy role).  Kathy Bates, Dean Winters, Lisa Kudrow, Gina Gershon, Harry Connick Jr., and Jeffrey Dean Morgan.

So, the conjunction of a lot of nice surface elements results in a watchable film.  Mind you, a lot of people are going to love this.  They won't object to the emotional manipulation and the cloying sentimentality that is this film's raison d'etre.  I did object, so as a result it had very minimal appeal.  But it did have a little.  And as yet another vampire on BUFFY put it (not James Marster's Spike, but The Master), ""Sometimes a little is enough.""",1210464000,5,4381,4.4002493765586035
3022127,4,B000YAA68C,"Marketing P.S. I LOVE YOU was a hit/miss situation.  The general trailer and the billboards seem to set the audience up for a sappy tearjerker. But happily what happens in this film is not the expected 'widowed person communicating with the dead love out of failure to get on with life' tale, but instead a look into the importance of friendship, family, and adjusting to the incomparable loss. Credit the original novel by Cecelia Ahern as adapted for the screen by Steven Rogers writer/director Richard LaGravenese for making what so easily have been a sappy, maudlin, whining tale into a  touching one of human emotions with a sense of reality mixed with a mildly implausible situation, and a  series of character studies that emphasize the importance of support in the time of grief.

Holly (Hilary Swank) and Gerry (Gerard Butler) Kennedy are a married couple with goals and frustrations and a huge dollop of passionate love, surrounded by friends and family. The tragedy happens just as the movie starts: Gerry has died of a brain tumor leaving the copeless Holly alone with her memories and self-inflicted regrets.  But Gerry, knowing he was a terminal patient, devised his own plan to help Holly through that first year of grief: he left letters in various forms and places, advising Holly how to learn about his family and how to get on with life. Holly's mother (Kathy Bates) owns a bar and has supported her little family since Holly's father deserted his family years ago.  In the bar is another injured soul named Daniel (Harry Connick  Jr.) who fancies Holly but realizes she is far from ready to think about dating. Holly's friends Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon) accompany Holly to Gerry's pre-planned trip to his home in Ireland to meet the in-laws Holly never knew.  While in Ireland Holly reminisces  on the magic of first meeting Gerry, meets Gerry's parents as well as Gerry's best friend William (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and through it all manages to appreciate the gift of PS I Love You letters and reminders Gerry has left for her.  And she ultimately finds closure to her loss.

The cast is strong and makes these at times strained characters into lovable people: Hilary Swank has made a successful entrance into the feminine lead role and is balanced to perfection by Butler, Morgan, Connick, Bates, Kudrow and  Gershon.  They make the implausible plausible and deliver a love story that goes beyond the level of superficial to join the ranks of warm and tender memorable slices of life.  It is surprisingly good!

I have to say, when I saw the preview I thought to myself - I NEVER want to see that movie.  It wasn't until today that on a very rare irrational whim, I decided ""What the hell, I'll just buy it.""  I typically don't like movies with a corny, hallmark card love story, and thought that was what this was going to be.

I was very happily proved wrong.

Although I think they should have chosen someone a bit more soft, vice the slightly mannish Hilary Swank, the movie, to me, was perfection.  Sure there were holes here and there like how she managed to keep the large, New York apartment after not working for the better part of two months, or how the supposed ""best friend"" didn't know who she was until after he slept with her... but you quickly get over it when you realize the true plot line of the story.

Its not about the stages of grief as much as it is about pure, blissful love and that sometimes, no matter what we do, the things we hold most dear to us can be taken in an instant.

I sobbed.  I laughed.  I got that fluttery feeling in my chest.  Truth be told, I definitely sobbed more than the other two, but its what made the story REAL.

Im glad I bought this movie.  I would reccomend it in a hearbeat.",1210377600,5,1254,4.218487394957983
3022149,5,B000YAA68C,"This is a fantastic movie.  I laughed and cried in it as it's like an emotional rollercoaster.  I thought Hilary Swank did an excellent job here and played the role of Holly, whose husband Gerry is dying of a brain tumor.  While still alive, he writes Holly letters and she receives them after his death and signs off each time with PS. I Love You.  With every new letter, there is a new adventure.
There is a terrific cast here (Lisa Kudrow, Gina Gershon Kathy Bates and Harry Connick Jr), that make the movie fun and enjoyable.  I didn't know if I was going to like it or not, but have found myself watching it over and over about 4 or 5 times already since buying this on DVD.  It's a nice chick flick/feel good/romantic comedy/drama and a new favourite.

So I started out watching it and I have to say it's a beautiful movie, not only sad, but uplifiting and heartfelt. It's a wonderful movie!!! Those who love a nice tear jerker that makes you sigh happily at the end and feel all gushy will love this movie!

I'm not just giving this movie 5 stars because I'm an avid fan of Gerard Butler because he has other movies I'd never rate as high as this one.  There is not much I can say that has not been said already.  The movie is very real.  Hilary's performance really brings the emotion home because she is very sincere.  The scene near the end when she goes running into her mother's bar sobbing, and she says, ""I can't breathe,"" well- by that time I myself had to remember to breathe because when I cry I tend to hold my breath and I had been sobbing for a good few minutes already.  I was lost in her pain and heartache.  I forgot it was only a movie.

I LOVE this movie.  Gerard was wonderful and refreshing.  He mixes passion, romance and silliness is a way that is fun, believable and not over the top.

Sentimental but funny... I have never cried so hard from a movie.  There is something about the chemistry and dynamic between Holly and Jerry that made me sit back and ponder my own relationship.  Not perfect but wonderful in its normalcy.  A few lines from this movie could have come from my life, especially when Jerry during karaoke says something like, ""She's already bitched at me for wanting to go out tonight... 'it's been such a long day at the office, ah...' ""  It is a movie for me to watch often because it makes me realize how much I have to be thankful for- and to cherish what I have.  Sometimes we tend to take for granted the everyday stable yet great people in our lives, and I think for some of us this movie will work as a gentle loving reminder.",1210291200,3,1688,4.244514106583072

3022155,5,B000YAA68C,"Wow!  What a great movie, much to my surprise.  I went for only 2 reasons.  The #1 reason - Gerard Butler who's GORGEOUS & unbelievably talented.  The #2 reason - Hilary Swank (2 time Academy Award Winner), who's good in everything.  I figured that if they ""signed on"" then it's got to be a good show.  It was.  I was apprehensive at first in regard to the plot, a dead guy who wrote letters to be sent to his widow after he dies.  I thought it would be lame.  It is such a great show.  Hilary is such a good actress, right away I felt like I was in her shoes, she made you feel like YOU were the widow experiencing the denial, anger, etc.  Gerard no doubt scored major ""chick points"" with his charming performance.  However I don't think he really even had to try too hard as he's very talented.  He got to use his natural accent and real first name for his character.  The ""Gerry"" in the movie wasn't too much of a stretch for Gerard as in real life he seems to be a very unique, energetic/lively, fun-loving guy.  Oh and the bonus was his smile & those eyes.  They will melt you every time.  I doubt there was any woman that didn't completely fall in love with him during his few appearances in the movie.  It was all very believable, nothing was far-fetched.  Thank you Hilary & Gerard for such an emotionally-charged movie; denial, anger, love, comedy, etc.  Absolutely worth watching again & again.  The music is great also.  All I know is that I left the theater crying and thought seriously about life being too short & to make the most of the time we do have!

It isn't set in Ireland, it's set in NYC. Holly is American and Gerry is Irish. The letters are mushed together, drawn out and important details lost. Holly hardly seems to be the grieving widow as told in the book. She seems happy, upbeat and well healed. *spoiler* SHE HAS A ONE NIGHT STAND! This doesn't happen in the book. She has issues getting close to Daniel in the book, who, in the movie is a bumbling idiot with social issues. They don't take a trip to a Spanish Island, but instead, go to Ireland. His parents are wonderful and accepting and her mother in the movie (who is now a single mother... wtf) is a judgemental bitch.

Thats just the tip of the iceberg... this movie is a waste of time and does a HUGE injustice to the original book. What was Hollywood thinking? Save your time and money and if, like me, you are curious enough to suffer through it, just Google Video search it.",1210204800,13,1063,4.446153846153846

My wait was over yesterday when I went to a store and they had it for sale. I read the book after seeing the movie and yes they are different in a lot of ways but still the same. I only keep thinking that it would've been nice if they would've added one or two scenes that I loved about the book and to my surprise those scenes are included in the additional scenes in the DVD.

3022184,3,B000YAA68C,"Hilary Swank is sniping at her ne'er do well husband Gerard Butler for taking out a loan behind her back and for telling Kathy Bates, her mother, that she does not want children.  You know why I don't want children yet, Gerry, she screams, it's because I don't want to bring them up in this tiny lower east side apartment, where I would be having to change their diapers on the windowsills because this place is so small there's not even room to turn around.  In this opening scene I lost all faith in the movie, since the apartment they are fighting in is a fantastically large 3,500 square feet place with views on every wall of every room and plus, it's decorated like she's a staging contest winner.  I know it's a convention of the movies that every New York apartment, no matter how opulent and grand, is supposed to be tiny and unfit for humans, but this really takes the cake.  If you're going to make your PLOT TURN on how awful and small a LES apartment is, why don't you show one?  Don't show something that looks like Krystle and Alexis could both live there and never bump into each other for a week.  How idiotic, how far removed from real life.  Basically you'd have to have an income of $750,000 yearly to afford the apartment that most of the action takes place in.  And yet Swank and Butler, appealing actors of course, are supposed to be barely making ends meet.

The script does manage (barely) to explain away why Swank is always dressed in fabulous Marc Jacobs originals.  She buys them on EBAY, she claims, as though that means they would cost only pennies.

I'm sure much of the movie ended up on the cutting room floor.  All of James Marsters' scenes for example, and most of the scenes that inveigled Lisa Kudrow enough to sign on, for the movie we have makes her look to be a one dimensional tease.  She does look exquisite in a Marc Jacobs wedding dress, posed high on a grey carpeted revolving disk in the middle of a bridal salon.

You could sort of see where the movie was going, and that's okay, but there came a time where I longed for one more twist.  Here are a few that I dreamed up.  At the end it would be revealed that Hilary Swank had also died of a brain tumor quite early on, too; or another ending where it was revealed that she had actually been married to Jeffrey Dean Morgan and that Gerard Butler was alive and singing ""Fairytale of New York"" to her in real time.

Who was the actress playing Swank's sister who came from Australia?  Why did they even have her in the movie?

I must say that I was pleasently surprised.  Some parts of the film are sad, some parts are funny and other parts are romantic. But to call this film a romantic comedy would be a disservice.  It is more apt to call it a comedy-drama.

Some critics have said that Swank is badly cast.  I would disagree.  In the hands of another actor, the role may have seemed too whimsical and light.  Swank gives Holly a kind of grounding. The performances from the supporting cast were also first-rate.

There are some weaknesses with the storyline.  I thought that the character of Holly relied a little too heavily on ""fate"" and on receiving ""signs"". I also thought that it was a little inconsistant that a couple who were supposed to be struggling financially could afford a trip to Ireland.  But to dismiss the film entirely because of these points would be just nit picking.  This film may not change your life but there are worse ways of spending a few hours.",1203811200,5,1200,4.525581395348837

3022213,5,B000YAA68C,"After seeing ""P.S. I Love You""...it is now my all time favorite romantic comedy. Probably replacing ""Notting Hill"". Any movie that makes me laugh and cry at the same time is a winner! The opening argument scene was so well written. It was very realistic(my husband and I have argued just like that)plus it introduced the characters history and chemistry etc. Very effective opening scene. I was not a Hillary Swank fan, but she won me over. Her performance is wonderful....I believed she was Holly and Gerard Butler WAS Gerry. Every role I see him in is spot on. I wonder when he will get the accolades he deserves. Everyone else in the cast was excellent. I will agree that some roles seemed to be cut down to almost nothing...James Marsten and the actress who played Hillary's sister, and Gina Gershon.

This movie had some atypical twists and turns and I loved that. I also would enjoy seeing the movie a second time. Because some scenes were flashbacks or out of sequence, you could enjoy some scenes early in the movie now knowing what will be coming up in the future...if that makes sense. (An example: Holly must clean out her deceased husband's closet...pack up his clothes. She keeps his leather jacket though. Later in the movie you flashback years before to the scene where Gerry and Holly first meet and discover that Gerry gives her his leather jacket when she's cold. Seeing the movie a second time, I would look at the scene of Holly packing clothes and holding on to his leather jacket differently now knowing the history behind it.)

If you want a romantic comedy formula movie, this isn't exactly it...this movie has layers and really makes you think while it entertains. I also did not think it dragged for even a moment.

One extra recommendation...buy or rent ""Dear Frankie"" with Gerard Butler. Another movie that is a true work of art!",1202342400,6,1857,4.707692307692308

Hillary Swank does a fabulous job portraying the emotional rollercoaster that our heroine goes through. In fact, there is not a weak link in the bunch. Harry Connick, Jr., Kathy Bates, Gerard Butler, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Lisa Kudrow--they are all at the top of their game and an absolute pleasure to watch.

3022215,2,B000YAA68C,"Grief can be a painfully long process, but does that mean a movie needs to capture that experience in real time? Actually a year elapses in this marathon 126-minute film, but director Richard LaGravenese's episodic treatment is so sluggish that the end didn't come soon enough for me. This is the first of several problems with this 2007 romantic dramedy co-written by LaGravenese and Steven Rogers and actually not the biggest. That dubious distinction belongs to star Hilary Swank as Holly Kennedy, a high-strung Manhattan real estate agent closing in on thirty and married nearly a decade to Gerry, a hunky, free-wheeling Irish musician. Physically angular with a performance pitched between severely pinched and gawkily awkward, Swank lacks the innate malleability to carry off the role. It's the type that Meg Ryan or Sandra Bullock can do in their sleep, but obviously the torch has to be passed. Despite moments of genuine likeability and vulnerability, Swank lets it drop.

The movie opens with a lengthy and extremely contrived marital squabble between Holly and Gerry and then wastes no time in flashing forward months later to Gerry's wake at the Irish bar that Holly's mother runs. Throughout the rest of the movie, Holly grieves by having frequent flashbacks to the happier days with Gerry, that is, when she is not fantasizing about Gerry still being alive. The plot turns on the conceit that he wrote a series of letters before his death that he intends to be delivered to Holly at key moments during her first year without him, and Holly's responses to the letters make up what constitutes the impetus of the storyline. There are some poorly developed turns, but there are some good moments primarily courtesy of an unusually stellar supporting cast starting with Kathy Bates as Holly's straight-shooting mother whose own husband left her in a less tragic manner; Gina Gershon as Sharon, one of Holly's best friends; and Lisa Kudrow as her other friend, the more hedonistic Denise. In fact, Kudrow's crack comedy timing is such a contrast to Swank's tentative, redundant manner that it upsets the balance of the film.

The men fare somewhat better. A genuinely charismatic actor, Gerard Butler plays Gerry with such unfettered joy that it really is a wonder why he is attracted to Holly in the first place. Their ""cute"" first encounter on an isolated Irish road is painful to watch not because of Gerry's impending doom but because Swank overdoes her impersonation of a nave college student. As potential paramour Billy, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, an American actor who actually does a better Irish accent than Butler (a Scotsman) lends the necessary smoldering presence, but he is painted too ideally to be that compelling. Harry Connick, Jr., on the other hand, plays a genuinely idiosyncratic suitor, Daniel, a somewhat off-kilter bartender who may have Asperger's Syndrome. It's an oddly discomforting ploy, but at least it's different, and Connick shows he still has a good comedy sense. Rural Ireland certainly looks idyllic thanks to Terry Stacey's cinematography, although I have to say the musical soundtrack comes across as too predictably coy to help complement scenes. I recommend skipping this one for more worthwhile treatments on grieving like Anthony Minghella's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Truly-Madly-Deeply/dp/B00005R5GK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Truly Madly Deeply</a>&nbsp;or even Jerry Zucker's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost/dp/B000LE16VW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost</a>.",1200960000,17,3607,5.58029197080292

But I thought maybe if they improved on it and made it more about...picking yourself back up then the book did that I would enjoy it more. I was right thankfully! I'll also say that I'm a big fan of movies like the notebook and a walk to remember, and this seemed to fall into the same caliber of movie for me.
  It really got you to understand the main characters' relationship and also kept the main elements of the book in my opinion. I usually don't really like Hilary Swank but she was charming and engaging(though, really shouldn't sing along with Judy Garland, that was painful). My only complaint was that I cried so much it gave me a headache, though, it would redeem itself by giving you a good laugh immediately following a really sad part. So I deducted just one star because by the end, I was mentally BEGGING them not to go thru another letter, I didn't think my poor tear ducts could handle it. I would also say, though I considered dragging my boyfriend(who apparently had no clue about the premise to begin with and would have been going in blindly!) it was much better to go with my best friend who had also read the book(though she said I cried too much). Its a chick flick in my opinion, though I have heard other guys didn't mind it. =) I would happily recommend it as a really fun movie that I absolutely loved.

3022218,5,B000YAA68C,"I had actually been dragging my feet because the movie itself was not an exact copy of the book which was wonderful.  However, that said, did it matter????  No, to me, in the end, not one bit.  I laughed, sighed and cried throughout the entire movie.  It blew me away.  I cannot wait to own this gem.  there was only one man in our theater.  The rest were Gerry Butler fans (yes, I can spot them a mile away) and teenage girls, who did their own share of crying and hugging after the movie.  This movie hits home on many different levels.  It is not just about the death of a beloved spouse, it is about the uncertainty of life and how to go on living when things do not go as you planned, how to forgive yourself if you didn't get around to doing certain things (having children).  It shows us that though marriage never goes as you planned it (or fantasized it would), that it is your life and you are in the middle of it. It's about loving yourself and your spouse during those not so perfect times.  In the end, the most important thing is how to find yourself and keep the faith after the worst possible thing has happened.  Love, anger, fear, loss, and abandoment- it is all there.

Everyone was great.  Gerry brought so much energy and soul to his role!  He is so damn handsome and sexy!!  Oh, and to hear him sing again was an extra added bonus!  Hilary was terrific and very believable- she did great playing against type.  I really wasn't sure before the movie if I would warm to Harry Connick's character, but his off-beat Daniel was very likable and cute.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan was great, too.

I cannot say anything negative.  I loved this movie and can't wait to see it again!!

3022241,4,B000YAA68C,"The story begins with a fight. Holly (Swank) is running up a seemingly endless  flight of stairs with Gerry (Butler) in hot pursuit.  He's apologizing, but like a typical male, he's really not quite sure what he did wrong--he just wants to make up and not sleep in the bathtub.

Nine years' marriage and they don't have a lot to show--no kids, no careers, and only a five flight walkup.  But, it's obvious that Holly and Gerry love each other very much.

The next scene is Gerry's wake.  It's a bittersweet affair--and I confess to laughing when I heard the ironic ""Fairytale of New York"" (Gerry's favorite song) played and sung to by his priest.

A few weeks' later, the letters begin.  While the film only shows Gerry's life and Holly's impressions of his 'ghost', we realize he'd understood his cancer would take him and planned to help Holly get through it past the grave.  His letters encourage her to get out, sing Karaoke, even go to Ireland.  Those missives literally help her find her dreams and go on with her life.

""PS I love you"" is what I expected--and more. The cast, scenery, and especially the music all fit well together to elicit tears--and yes, occasional laughter.

Gerard Butler is fabulous as always.  He's one of the best new actors around and I hope to see him for many years to come. I didn't expect that he could sing--and he does an excellent job on ""Galway Girls.""

In my opinion, Hillary Swank is the best part of the film.  She's not your typical Hollywood ingenue.  She's sometimes awkward, she doesn't always look perfect, and yet her ability to convey emotions from the highs to the lows very impressive.  When she comes home from the funeral alone, picks up her cell phone and just keeps calling her home phone to hear Gerry's voice over and over on the answering machine literally brought me to tears.

Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the big teddy bear Billy Gallagher was also great.  You've seen him before if you watched ""Grey's Anatomy"" playing Denny Duquette. I'm very glad to see him getting silver screen roles. If you like him, look for him in 2008 in ""The Accidental Husband.""

Only one warning--take some tissues with you. This film will make you cry--and occasionally laugh so hard you'll have tears in your eyes, too.",1199491200,155,2257,4.63727959697733
3022242,3,B000YAA68C,"Holly and Gerry Kennedy (Hillary Swank and Gerard Butler) have been married nearly a decade and when he is suddenly torn from her, she gets a gift from beyond - monthly letters penned by Gerry to help her get through her first year without him. They urge her on to do stuff she normally wouldn't do - like attempt karaoke again after a disastrous past try; go on a trip with the girls; and he even encourages her to not close herself off, but to open herself up to the possiblility of falling in love again.

Lacking a simple thing as chemistry between the two lead characters (or the potential new love interests for that matter), the movie version of ""PS I Love You"" falls flat and never really takes off. From the first ten minutes - one of their many arguments designed to show what a ""real"" couple they are - to the cheesy flashbacks to highlight their initial meeting. It just made me wonder how the heck they got together. And Swank's attempts at displaying her grief in a prolonged arc just didn't work - it was too contrived and unbelievable. She was channeling Diane Keaton in her annoyingly infamous crying scene in ""Something's Gotta Give."" I could not be more disappointed in the movie. I was expecting a romantic comedy-drama in the vein of ""Ghost,"" but instead it was just a mediocre story. The only time I shed a tear was when she kept calling his phone just to hear his voice - it seemed really natural, unlike the majority of her performance. Other stand outs were Kathy Bates as her mother and Lisa Kudrow providing comic relief. James Marsden (Spike from ""Buffy"") as Gerry's best friend is completely unrecognizable in a very understated performance.

Side note - did anyone else wonder why in the heck she packed up all his clothes and mailed them to Ireland? That must have cost a fortune.",1199232000,5,1811,4.552147239263804

Mrs/ Swanks gave one of her better performances as Holly and earned a new respect from me. The chemistry between Swank and Butler is charming and heartbreaking when their love is lost. The emotions are geunine and the tears are earned and not forced unlike some romantic films.

3022244,4,B000YAA68C,"So here is the thing. I don't watch many regular television programs so
have never seen some of the supporting cast and their trademark 'acts.'
I have never read the novel, P.S, I Love You. Or any other Ahern
writings. Never have seen any of the actors except Hilary Swank, Gerard
Butler and Kathy Bates. I don't know anything about walk-up apartments
in New York. (Seemed to bug some people.) I'm not an 'expert' on Irish
accents.

I caught the film for the second time 12/30 at the 10:35 a.m. showing;
there was an amazing crowd for a Sunday morning. The projection was
perfect. No microphones (complaints on some boards) on view. The sound
was great. That end song over the credits is a winner! And I loved it
more that I did the first time on the opening Friday morn, the 21st.

Holly is a real person, imperfect and annoying at times. Hilary Swank
is perfect. Those who want a 'babyface"" child/woman to play Holly are
not living in the real world. There are more look-a-likes for Hilary
than the usual cookie-cutter cute young things Hollywood usually casts.
And Hilary has the chops to make us understand this childish woman and
how she starts the healing and growing up, with her Gerry's memory to
help.

I loved Lisa Kudrows questions to potentials. Very funny. I loved
Holly's quirky sister and thought she brought energy and sunshine to
her scenes. The boat scene is clich' but funny all the same.

I still say the ballpark scene was not needed. They could have cut it
and the expense, and had the reading of the letter as voice-over.
Daniel and Holly 'were over' in the restaurant, and the audience knows
it. Daniel is an interesting ""other man"" and a new type. More
interesting than usual. But did anyone really think they would end up
together? Not me.

Bates is always good, but I just don't see that her part is 'wonderful'
as others keep saying. It's a part Bates can do in her sleep. The
Mother had never reconciled to the marriage and seemed waspish. Holly
had to overlook her disapproval while trying to find her way with her
husband.

I wonder how many scenes with James Marstars and Gina Gershon were left
on the cutting room floor. They were hardly in the film.

And Jeffrey Dean Morgan, although good looking in a grinny-goofy way,
hardly has any lines to say. And they are one-note. So not a great
impression.

The cinematography is gorgeous, from the streets of New York to the
Irish countryside.

Our audience today clapped when the 'Mustang Sally"" scene started. More
energy and excitement there than in all the rest of the film. Gerry
Butler is Mr. Wonderful. Singing, flirting, great body language, and a
delicious deep kiss, at last. *sigh* I've upgraded my rating to a 9
from a 7.

Postcript: I didn't read this book and I have promised myself that I
will never buy a book thinking I will see it on film. Never happens. I
have promised myself I will not see every preview and teaser of a film
before I go to the theater.

The previews of PSILY were clips chopped up from 5 to 10 seconds and
did not show what the scenes they were from were about. I went thinking
I was seeing quite a different film, just from all the clips we were
able to see online and on TV. My first viewing was clouded by that
fact. I did not see what the preview seemed to say I should be seeing.

From now on I will go in like I did for ""Phantom Of The Opera"" -
knowing nothing, never having seen a preview. But I knew I loved the
music.

Or last years ""The Departed."" I had never even heard of it and went
because I wanted to see the ""300"" preview on a big screen. But I loved
it.

This has taught me a lesson. I've seen one preview of ""Nims Island"" -
the next Butler film, out in April, and love what I see. Don't want to
read the book. I'll not be watching or reading about the film. Don't
want any more information than I have right now. That way, it is just
me and what's on the screen - and that's what it's all about. One
person in the dark, reacting to what the director, crew and actors have
made for them. That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it. :) Jane",1199059200,27,4070,4.352242744063324

3022246,2,B000YAA68C,"There's nothing like a good confection to go along with the holidays.  And there's nothing more that I'd like to do than enjoy a film like `P.S. I Love You'.  The previews show everything inviting:  A widow woman on the mend, a mystery with chain letters sent posthumously, the comic return of Lisa Kudrow, a heart-warming story about learning to live and love again after a loved one's death.  There's even a performance by Kathy Bates.

The movie starts with a likable premise:  Gerry (Gerard Butler), a fun-loving pub singer and Irish immigrant dies of brain cancer and leaves his wife, Holly (Hillary Swank) to grieve immobile in her Brooklyn apartment.  Sounds good so far.  I came into the story thinking I might get the female flick (or male sensitive movie) version of `The Ultimate Gift'.  There were some problems with that movie, but the aspect of mystery with a heart is a real draw.

Holly mourns for weeks, letting her apartment go.  Her mother (Bates) and her best friend (Kudrow) try to snap her out of it.  On her thirtieth birthday, balloons and a cake are delivered, complete with a tape recorder with Gerry's voice intact, telling her she's to follow the instructions from a series of letters meant to ease her grieving and move on in life.

At Irish Teddy's Bar where he used to sing, bartender, Daniel (Harry Connick, Jr.) is the kind of jerk women love to hate, but tries to make a move while Holly's on the mend.  She goes out on the town and takes a trip to Ireland and connects with Gerry's family, but the film mostly falters.  The trouble is time is needed for these wounds, and the movie almost makes the four seasons of her grieving in real time.

Unfortunately the movie didn't live up to the previews.  Here's why:  If the film were nearly as well edited as the trailor, it would flown better.  There's one speed they know best and that's slow.  Sometimes it's essential; at others it's deadly.  The material is drawn out; it's spotty for mirth and warmth.  There's a joke here, a letdown there.  The movie lingers over every development.  The flashbacks don't help the film much, either.  The delivery mainly feels forced.

Swank gives a heartfelt performance that clearly identifies our sympathies for her plight, and Bates is as believable as ever as the hard-boiled mother, who underneath her exterior shines a true and loving heart.  Lisa Kudrow still has a likable return, even if the movie's timing gives her short shrift.  In comparison to his role in 'Bug,' Harry Connick, Jr. shows a real acting range.  Similarly, Gerard Butler shows his repertoire from feisty sword and sandal king in '300' to a likable character, worthy of grieving about.

Despite good performances and a good premise, 'P.S. I Love You' fails to connect with the audience.  Unlike movies such as 'The Notebook,' and `Ghost' it fails to deliver the emotional depth one would expect from the subject matter with a script and direction that need to be lively at the times the characters and audience need it most.",1198627200,18,3023,4.722753346080306
3022247,4,B000YAA68C,"As hopelessly contrived and predictable as ""P.S. I Love You"" is, it's still a charming, touching romantic comedy. The most surprising thing about it is Hilary Swank, whose resume of serious films has made a humorous role seem an unlikely choice. She makes full use of her softer, sillier side, playing a character that's loveable and irritating at the same time. I say this in spite of the fact that serious undertones run through the film, as they always do in romantic comedies; after losing her husband to cancer, Swank's character spends the rest of the film trying to find herself (for lack of a non-clichd term). The twist is that her husband is posthumously guiding her with a series of handwritten letters, all of which were so strategically located that only a well-executed plan could see it through. A sweet but nonetheless baffling idea: How could a terminally ill man carry off something this elaborate in such a short period of time?

Never mind--I was still moved by the light-hearted sentimentality of the story, so I have to give credit where credit is due. The film opens in wintertime New York City with Holly Kennedy (Swank) storming home, absolutely furious. Right behind her is her Irish husband, Jerry (Gerard Butler), who knows he's said something to offend Holly but doesn't know what. It isn't until they enter their apartment that they really let loose: Holly is offended because Jerry commented on her waiting to have children. Now back in their apartment, everything he says gets misconstrued in some way, and a full-blown fight ensues. It isn't long before they make up, however, and by the time they do, Jerry promises his wife that he isn't going anywhere, despite their financial troubles, despite their current job situations. After nine years, he still loves her. He'll always love her, no matter what.

Naturally, the very next scene takes place at his memorial service. The audience is thankfully spared the unnecessary melodrama of his failing health and eventual death; no such scenes are included in this film. The filmmakers wisely chose to focus on what happens afterwards with Holly, who--as you might have guessed--is so grief-stricken that she shuts herself off and lets herself go. It isn't until her thirtieth birthday that things begin to change; as her worried family and friends sit by her side, a birthday cake is delivered with a mini cassette recorder taped to the inside of the box. Holly presses the Play button and hears Jerry's voice explaining that he wrote her a series of letters as he was dying. Holly will receive them all over a period of time, and each one will instruct her to do something bold and adventurous. Basically, his words will push her into living her life without focusing so much on his death.

The rest of the film is all about Holly fulfilling her husband's last requests, from singing in a karaoke bar to meeting his parents back in his native Ireland (where--you guessed it--another letter waits). Her friends and family offer as much support as they can, all while engaged in their own minor subplots. Her best friend, Denise (Lisa Kudrow), is desperate to find Mr. Right, so desperate that she openly asks potential dates about their relationship status, their financial status, and their sexual orientation. Holly's mother, Patricia (Kathy Bates), loves her daughter but has trouble accepting Jerry's postmortem plan. She was never fully accepting of him to begin with; he and Holly married at young ages, meaning that a lot could have gone wrong. And Patricia definitely understands the pain of losing a husband (albeit under much different circumstances).

The most interesting side character is Daniel (Harry Connick, Jr.), who works for Holly's mother at a local bar. He claims to have a syndrome: his social filter is defective, meaning he'll say anything to anyone at anytime. He openly tells Holly that she's hot, that she's a terrible singer, and that he's getting sick of hearing about Jerry all the time. Part of the truth is obvious--he has feelings for Holly. The rest of the truth is not so clear-cut--he, too, has been deeply wounded by a past relationship. From this alone, the two are emotional matches. That doesn't necessarily mean that they would work as a couple, especially with the inclusion of William (Jeffery Dean Morgan), the man Holly meets on her trip to Ireland. So the question is raised: Will Holly and Daniel find romance in the midst of tragedy? Will Holly allow herself to love again, or even to let her life go in a new direction?

As fresh and exciting as I'm making this sound, the reality is that ""P.S. I Love You"" is a fairly routine story of love, loss, and emotional rebirth. That doesn't make it a bad movie by any means; in all honesty, I found it quite satisfying. Most of this has to do with Hilary Swank, who impressed me with her ability to transcend the heavy-handed, solemn movie roles she's known for. But the rest of the cast does a decent job, as well, doing justice to a well-established cinematic formula. I also appreciated the letter-writing plot point, simply because it was cleverly (if strangely) executed. Some may feel that Jerry's letter writing is a method of control, but do you honestly think that a romantic comedy would go that far? It's not control so much as it's a way to nudge Holly in the right direction--I believe that, were it not for his letters, she would mourn the rest of her life. And is it any coincidence that he ends every letter with the film's title?",1198454400,36,5520,4.818565400843882
3022248,4,B000YAA68C,"""PS I Love You"" is a delightful film about a young widow and how her husband, knowing he was dying, left her a legacy of letters designed to encourage her into living again after his death.  Hilary Swank delivers a high-energy performance opposite the always sexy Gerard Butler.  Lisa Kudrow is a hoot as Hilary's friend.  Gina Gershon, James Marsters (Spike from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer fame), Harry Connick, Jr., and Kathy Bates round out the cast.  The locations are rich and beautiful!  Even the apartment where Hilary lives and the pub her mother owns are almost characters, themselves.  This film made me laugh - the priest singing at the Irish wake was particularly amusing.  It made me cry - too many times to name.  It made me laugh while I was crying.  It is a lovely movie filled with lots of surprises!",1198108800,13,816,4.65034965034965
3252324,2,B000YAA68C,"Unfortunately, this movie was poorly cast. The storyline is there, the idea is exciting and genuinely romantic. The cast, principals in particular is really off. there is no chemistry between Gerrard Butler and Hilary Swank. It comes down to Hilary Swank's inability to be a romantic leading lady. It's hard to imagine her romantically with anyone and Gerard Butler doesn't come through for both of them. Harry Connick Jr., who used to be a gorgeous crooner, from Hope Floats to a reoccurring role on Will and Grace has now turned into an overweight guy who is getting second-hand roles. Gina Gershon, who is usually great in each of her performances, is plagued by bad face impressions. James Marsters is extremely underused. Lisa Kudrow, the comedic light of the film, shows promise but could be a lot funnier and is generally a lot funnier in all her other roles. The only interaction that makes sense is that between Kathy Bates' character and Hilary Swank's. Their mother-daughter relationship is shaky but gets the much-needed boost at the end. The admirable features of the movie are all due to what must be genuinely good source material, i.e. the novel it is based on. The idea that the heroine isn't dependant on the guy for her salvation, but, in fact, looses herself in him is gutsy. The fact that her involvement with the love of her life stunts her ability to find herself and that it's his death that releases her is so fascinating to see on the screen and so real, that's it's scary. I only wished they would focus more on this and develop it. If they had only embraced it! Still, as far as romantic comedies go, it's refreshing to see that every once in a while there comes a movie that doesn't end with a happily ever union.",1198022400,32,1742,4.659090909090909

I wish they had done something a bit better for the character that Harry Connick Jr played.  He is a good actor himself and there wasn't much for him to work with as his character. I know the movie didn't get rave reviews from the critics but who cares.  There are lots of movies that are considered bad yet we love them. Such was the case with this one. I thought the entire cast was magnificent. Each was so unique and you'd never think they were the best of friends and yet they were. I had to buy another one due to just wearing the first one out.

3252415,2,B000YAA68C,"The movie was actually pretty good. I didn't like the character of Holly though. She seemed flaky, selfish and flighty. Everything had to revolve around her. In the beginning it's starts with a fight between the couple of Holly and her husband Gerry. She has no idea what she wants and she can't keep a job, quit 5 because she couldn't work for idiots, and just started getting a regular paycheck on the sixth job. She then complained about money yet she doesn't mind spending money on designer clothing, her excuse is she buys them on eBay. So I guess that makes the money she spends on them not count. She doesn't want a baby her excuse being their living situation. She talks on and on about showing people houses that she can't afford. What exactly does she expect to happen? If money is the problem, why not buy clothes and shoes like a regular person instead of needing designer everything? eBay does count. Gerry even offered to get a second job if that's what she wanted. He's all about trying to give his wife what she wants, she has no idea what that is! Holly is very selfish, everything is always about her wants and needs and her husband is expected to just agree and go along. When he dies, it's still all about her. Her grief over losing someone it looks like she hadn't appreciated anyway. Someone who took the time to try to help her through her grief. He's kind enough to write her letters written to ease her through it starting on her 30th birthday. As she goes along her friends are surrounding her. Yet towards the end when one of her friends is getting married, she can't even be happy for her. She starts avoiding her friends, no calls, no nothing. All of a sudden she decides to design shoes. And finally she seems to be able to focus on someone other than herself. She decides to see her friend at her bridal fitting to apologize and ask to design her wedding shoes. Apparently sometime after that she falls for someone else and lives happily ever after. I like the movie but it would've been nice if the focus wasn't about her wants and needs all throughout the movie.",1484179200,,2095,4.458333333333333

Kathy Bates played an outstanding role as Hillary's single mother trying to help her daughter cope.
It's a great ""Girlie Flick"" to watch on a rainy Saturday night or a good popcorn movie anytime.

The first time I watched it was right after a bad breakup (i don't recommend that, btw) and all I could think was that I needed to get to Ireland and find me a big sexy Irishman. I watched it again recently and found myself bawling again along with Hillary Swanks character as she struggles to understand what happened. Her husband was like the perfect guy and they were so in love. Its such a beautiful romantic story.

3252534,4,B000YAA68C,"I didn't read the book, so I'm only rating the movie... although, I might pick up the book one day to see what all the hubbub is about.  The screenplay was fairly good with two exceptions: (a) the sex scene in Ireland seemed out of character/unnecessary and (b) the relationship between Hilary Swank's grieving widow and Harry Connick's lovesick bartender really missed.  Gerard Butler turned in a solid performance (the occasional slip in his faux-Irish brogue didn't bother me too much) and Kathy Bates stole a couple of scenes, as you would expect.  Also good supporting turns by Gina Gershon, Lisa Kudrow and James Marsters.  Harry Connick, Jr. (who I normally like) had a purposefully unsympathetic role which was poorly written - I thought he was wasted in this film.  Incredible camera work for all the scenes filmed in Ireland.

As others have noted, Hillary Swank can be great in certain vehicles, but totally miss in others.  This movie falls toward the later for me: she's not terrible, but I never empathized with her character (she comes across as spoiled and entitled here) and I could envision other actresses who would be more engaging in the role.

At 2 hours, I thought the movie could have been more concise without sacrificing the story line... but that's what happens when the director is also the screenwriter.  All-in-all, I thought the movie was well crafted and IMDb's rating of 7.1/10 is spot on.",1468108800,5,1422,4.867219917012448

The emotions shown by the wife were moderate depression turned into happiness when her husband would send letters asking her to live life.

3252562,5,B000YAA68C,"I usually watch a lot of court dramas and suspense thrillers, and I seldom pay attention to romance movies.  Since my friend recommended to me highly, so I just gave it a shot.  It really exceeds my expectations.  I watched ""The Notebook"" acted by Ryan Gosling and found it very touching.  But this one's pathos is beyond description, I couldn't help stopping my tears rolled down my cheeks at the end of the movie.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you are looking for a romance movie which will touch your inner heart",1463875200,3,508,4.6
3252563,5,B000YAA68C,"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways lol. I love how you meet Gerry and Holly in the beginning a real couple having a fight that a million couples (the one I'm in included) about if they are ready or not ready to have a baby and her fear because of her own father issuses (which I can also understand). But then when she loses him anyway it's heartbreaking and a part of me felt it was kind of mean like let the woman move on but he knew better then anyone what she would really need to move on. It sounds weird but she almost needed his permission and his guidence to move on. I also really liked Holly's best friends in the movie and how hard it can feel when it looks like everyone is moving on with their wonderful carefree lives and you're just depressed and not moving at all. It's really about not loving the man you were with anymore but loving him but know you need to move on and if the man you loved really loved you he wouldn't want you to just be a person who walks and talks like their alive but really are alive. Because if something happened to me and Joe stopped his life right then and there and just lived sad and alone for the rest of his life I'd be mad at him because he's amazing and while I might hate him with another girl I'd be a much happier dead person knowing he's with someone who he loves and who loves him back then is all alone. That is what loving someone means, wanting them to be happy even if it isn't with you. Thats what I took from this movie anyway. But best quote I've gotta say is Lisa Kudrow when Gina Gerswhen's husband says ""this is why you can't get a guy."" and Lisa's character let's him in on a BIG point in what it means to becoming equal to men in this world trust me.  Snuggle up with your man or your big strong dog or even your big handsome teddy bear, a box of tissues and make sure to take off your eye make up not actually just all make up so you don't have to wash your face 10 times and your pillow case is ruined lol.",1463702400,,1983,3.9824120603015074

3252623,1,B000YAA68C,"Notice: my viewing experience may be unique due to the circumstance accompanying it.

First of all, do NOT attempt to watch this if you are streaming it via Comcast. The movie started decently, following the clich chick-flick format that has been squeezed so hard, all that's left is a thick, pulpy orange juice that's difficult to swallow. But Gerard is a man's man (see 300) and Hilary Swank is the type of girl you could take home to mom if she doesn't punch your lights out first.

We are acquainted with these two in the first scene, as they argue over a seemingly over-dramatic issue that fits the aforementioned format all too well. Of course, the end up reconciling over a passionate kiss that left me wondering if the two had practiced off screen. Naturally, my thoughts gravitated towards how much ""practicing"" this line of work typically entails. Maybe I should be an actor?

Note: this is where I dozed off for approximately 15 minutes.

I awoke to my girlfriend sobbing hysterically at the streaming wheel of death taunting her as Comcast yet again fails to meet basic customer expectations. Knowing full well my domestic responsibilities, I grumble as I pick up my phone to prepare to ream some poor, minimum wage sap who's only means of earning a living revolves around taking a verbal crucifixion over something he has no control over. All the while, Comcast executives laugh manically over our mutual misfortune, in some lush office on the top floor of the biggest skyscraper that can be found in the 7th layer of hell.

Before I can hit the speed dial, my girlfriend is trying to fill the short moments between her gasps for air with an explanation of her discomfort. SPOILER ALERT: Gerard dies. Not only has he died, but he tortures Hilary by sending her letters from beyond the grave in apparent attempt to prove once and for all that life still sucks after death. Of course girls will eat this sh*t up, but if you are a heterosexual male with a disdain for overly dramatic plot lines, don't watch this movie. Especially via Comcast streaming.",1456876800,,2063,4.719444444444444

3253385,3,B000YAA68C,"I sat through this film but it took two evenings and I fast-forwarded the part in Ireland, on the second sitting.  I'm not sure why I didn't like it more than I did.  The story is interesting enough and the whole cast is excellent.  I think the casting is the problem.  Hillary Swank is a talented actress but I think rom-com's may not be what she does best.  She has great emotional depth and here she's supposed to play cute and frothy.  Actually there's nothing wrong with her performance; it's just that it belongs in a totally different film, not one where her pals are Lisa Kudrow and the other buddy.  She does tragedy well; comedy not so much.  There are a number of other Hollywood actresses who could have polished off this role with great aplomb and made into a shining little bauble.  I think the director couldn't decide to go for funny or pathos and the result is this mess.  There's very little chemistry between her and Butler and although the film makes it plain that he loves her, it doesn't show us why.  She seems uptight and cranky and although she has a lovely body the terrible plaid dresses she wears do nothing for her.

Gerard Butler is always charming, Kathy Bates does a good job as the long suffering Mom, Lisa Kudrow is always fun to watch, and the fellow who plays the Irish friend of the deceased Gerry is beyond adorable!  I found the character played by Harry Connick Jr. quite problemmatic.  I don't want to give away any of the plot, only will say that his characterization seemed to leave a bad taste in my mouth.

I think the film could have been a lot better with the single change of the leading actress.  It's not bad, just doesn't have that fun and sparkle that rom-coms are supposed to have.",1417132800,,1734,4.439873417721519

3253389,5,B000YAA68C,"Richard LaGravanese (The Fisher King, Freedom Writers) takes you on a delicate and poignant ride of heartbreak and mourning.  Known for being somewhat sentimental, LaGravanese paints another powerful story of how love sadly parted by chance, can still be celebrated, appreciated and survived.  What some men might call another ""chick flick"" is really a heart-wrenching journey into the common emotions we all share surrounding the death of cherished love.  It is impossible to not enjoy Gerard Butler as the Irish bon vivant who sweeps the audience off its feet much like he does the uncertain and self-constrained Hillary Swank.  Even further stealing the show is Harry Connick, Jr., the mildly depressed and socially awkward bartender with no filter, who says everything confused men want to say to women they admire and gets away with it.  Bonus appearances from the always strong Kathy Bates and wonderfully scattered Lisa Kudrow add more flavor, and along with the steady James Marsters and reliable Gina Gershon, P.S. I Love You isn't your average romantic comedy.  It's a powerful story of mourning and rebirth, and at its core, what life is all about.",1416268800,,1159,5.138297872340425

It's a good movie to watch when you're going through a break-up or just feeling down because it reminds you that the world is unfair but there is light at the end of a tunnel.

Hillery was very good as were all the others, Harry, Lisa, and Kathy.  I did not know the others but all were very good.  Do need some tissues near by, but there are a lot of laughs also.  Many very poignant moments caught let me just say real life.  I understand from some postings that it was a disappointment to those who read the book; however, I think the real point of this movie was the love shown by Gerard's character Gerry for his wife and no matter how much it might have deviated from the book the point was made of what he did.  It stands as a lasting memorial to the great love and compassion Gerry had for his wife and we can all learn some valuable lessons from this movie.",1410393600,,856,4.214723926380368

It is deeper and funnier and sadder and more than it would seem. It's greater than the sum of its parts.

3253726,5,B000YAA68C,"I don't recall too many, if any, romantic comedies on Hillary Swank's resume.  In fact, I don't recall too many comedies on her resume.  But, in a film where she doesn't die by the end, Swank shines as always as she plays a woman who, in the wake of her beloved husband's sudden death, must learn to pick up the pieces and move on in her life.  As I've said, Swank did as great as ever here and this change of genre was surprising but ultimately welcome.  Did anyone beside me see Phoebe from ""Friends?  Yes, I know Lisa Kudrow was in the movie, but unfortunately, she's Phoebe.  So seeing her as a female version of Joey was just weird...and sometimes a bit forced.  But she and the rest of the cast were still pretty good throughout the film.  Even Harry Connick, Jr. showed some life here and there.  And Gerard Butler left us with a memorable performance as Swank's now-dead husband, making us miss him all the more.  My only wish is that we'd seen more of Kathy Bates on the grounds that she's just awesome.  My biggest praise goes for the ending as it did not go the way we all thought it would.  Oh, there were plenty of hints towards the ending every one of these movies moves towards, but there's a nice, and completely believable, twist at the end that leaves us with as much, if not a bit more, satisfaction as if a stereotypical ending had been chosen.  This is a fine film.  Enjoy.  P.S.:  I love you, film.",1403827200,5,1420,4.321969696969697

So even when there were times when I knew Holly""s pain and it was hard to watch at certain points. It was also a comforting movie to me. It made think of the happy times we had together and realize we all go through grief like this at some point. It is what we do with that grief do we let it consume us or try to move forward as best we can. It is what that lost loved one would want you to do.",1391212800,,677,3.6758620689655173

I thought that maybe this priming would help but it did not.  This movie was so fake and totally unrealistic.  Yes that guy is cute but there was no chemistry between him and Hilary that I could see.

3254539,2,B000YAA68C,"This is a very brief review - more to follow later.

I struggled through watching this film to completion - first on an airplane on my Nook HD+ tablet and then in bed on the Nook at home.

The very first part of the film that I found irritating was how a very critical event in the plot was handled.  I don't want to provide a spoiler, but suffice it to say that some major events happened within the first few minutes very abruptly.

Hilary Swank as the lead is a less than appealing character.  Gerard Butler makes for great ""eye candy"".  The other characters were never developed, so there were many vague, boring and tedious aspects to the film.  I did not find Harry Connick, Jr. intriguing in his role at all.  The camerawork also did not shed an attractive light on Hilary Swank, either.  Her face looked very ""horse-y"" throughout much of the film.",1378425600,,855,4.42948717948718

3254544,1,B000YAA68C,"Here's my last email to the vendor. I think it sums up my experience:

You obviously didn't read my email. I have no intention of returning the DVD as it is not worth the effort to send back a $7 DVD (that's what I paid including shipping) for which I'm going to pay at least half that much in shipping. Not to mention the time and aggravation just to get it shipped. And by the way, I find your statement about it clearly stating Region 2 in the description to be frustrating. How would you expect the average consumer to know what that means. I'm a US customer purchasing a DVD from a US based company. It seems to me that your system would be sophisticated enough to recognize that. For that matter, Amazon should never have recommended the item to me in the first place knowing that I live in the US.",1377907200,,804,4.254901960784314

The story line of the movie starts out well, but it seems the plot changes to a sad one so quickly. The flashbacks of how the couple met is helpful but doesn't explain how the story ends. It seems unrealistic for the twists and turns that the main character has to go through to finally appreciate what she already had - her family.",1373328000,,465,4.4186046511627906

This was one the happiest movies I've ever seen! Altho at times, I heard myself go ""AWWWWWW"", it really was fun and funny and more fun! An honestly upbeat movie, with some pretty deep advise given by Cathy Bates to her daughter. It was alll good. And it is a keeper. We can all use her sort of advise now and again.
  Of course Mr. Butler was gorgeous and did fine on his job.(surprise! He sings pretty good). And Ms. Hillary Swank and Lisa Kudrow added to the enjoyment of in my opinion was a VERY good movie. A keeper.",1365552000,,760,4.128378378378378

I didn't cry - cause I'm too manly - and I thought it got kind of sappy. The portrayal of a widow who can't move on from her husband's death felt real, though. I can totally see myself that way if my wife died. The ending was a nice twist on the romcom genre, and the whole thing felt better than average. Worth seeing.",1364860800,,485,4.010309278350515

3254995,1,B000YAA68C,"I guess it must just be me, judging from the other reviews, but I found this movie extremely depressing.  I cried through much of it.  In the beginning, I felt bad for Gerard Butler's character who was engaging and adorable but who had to deal with a bitchy, self-centered, unreasonable wife.  Then for the rest of the movie the grief process was so painful to watch.  Anyone that has suffered through a painful loss in the past will identify with the wife's pain.  The efforts of friends and family to help were relatively useless and not that enjoyable to watch either.  I disliked the twist at the end, and the assumption that William was the guy for her because he had a nice body was sort of disgusting.  Here she had just gone through a profound grief experience and she is supposed to be all happy again because she falls into bed with a nice-looking guy.  Please.  Gerard Butler was the real star of the movie, and his role in the film was minimal.  I would not recommend it unless you are eager to experience suffering along with the Hilary Swank character and watch scene after scene of her selfish, obnoxious behavior.",1364342400,6,1129,4.544554455445544

The cast was outstanding, even the ones I normally don't care much for.  Everyone brought a sincerity to their characters that really showed through.  It's a slow movie, but it's never boring or dull.  Every moment has something that contributes to the whole, and regardless of your situation in life, it's full of moments that you can relate to.

It *is* a sad movie - you can't help but sympathize with the main character, and even as a guy, there's plenty of times the eyes water up.  But there's some shockingly sudden hilarious moments that will have you bark out loud with laughter, totally unexpectedly.

The journey she takes in healing after her husband's death is so well portrayed.

Great movie, and if you're a guy with a significant other, it's one you can score bonus points for renting, and you may just find that you enjoy yourself as well.",1359158400,,978,4.542857142857143

It is a film that makes you think about your loved ones, about not taking them for granted. It is a beautiful movies. I wish I had discovered this movie before I became widowed at a young age.

This is definitely one of those movies that reminds you of your own humanity. If you haven't cried in a while and wonder if it's even possible to cry, watch this. You'll be surprised at how easily you connect to the characters (and, therefore, crumble with them) as they move through the various stages of grief from different perspectives (first person as the heroine herself, or third person as her family/friends/neighbors).

I rarely judge the acting, the script, the development of plot, etc.  I really enjoyed watching this movie because it had ""a little of everything""--something I personally need in a movie.  It made me laugh and cry.  It had seriousness and lightheartedness. The only disconnect I had was at the beginning of the movie.  The plot seemed to make a jump and I was left with a few questions.  I wondered if I missed something in the first 20 minutes of the movie.  Overall, though, it was a movie that I'd watch again and recommend to my girlfriends.

A lot of romantic comedies are pretty predictable but not this one. It has a happy beginning, a sad middle, and a hopeful ending. My only gripe with this movie is Harry Connick Jr. Seems like he is always being the jerk. I just can't relate to him and he tends to overact. P.S.

I found Gerry to be resurrected to walking on water, EVERY single scene with him looking so loving, handsome, and most of all seXy....  who is married after 10yrs in NYC and sees every memory sooooo saccarine syrupy overkill... we get it, Butler looks better than he did in his first foray well over 15yrs ago... thought Mom was too bitter in the you will always be alone and this memorial project was a waste, geez, thanks for the support in only her FIRST year of grieving, glad she got over her absolute love of her life in less than a year, bravo! and seems like the only thing they all do is go out and party, guess to show off her shoes???  Marie Antoinette did the same thing with less spectacular results, but hey this is 2008, so when someone has their health, a good business, friends and close relationship with her daughter I am sposed to just fall to pieces when she can't have everything?? ack.... I did find the film with many redeeming qualities, given how much I enjoy Hills, Gerry, Kathy, Harry, Gina, hmmmm, Lisa I can do without..... esp. the trip to the Green Isle, wow, thanks for those visuals, mostly all attractive men, PTL, and the happy ending was quaint finishing touch to the last letter, and yeah the tongue lashing at the harpie in the real estate deal was theee best!!!",1348272000,,1564,4.442508710801394

Hillary Swank plays Holly, Gerald Butler plays Gerry, an American woman that falls in love and marries an Irishman. Gerry and Holly's love is wonderful but Gerry dies of a brain tumor. Gerry knowing his wife knows that she needs help and a little push to get over his death and move on. Gerry sends Holly letters to help her do that, making her do things she wouldn't normally do. Each letter is signed P.S. I Love You.

I loved this movie, started off a little slow, but the wonderful man I married (who I secretly wish had that Irish accent) watched it with me. Total chick flick, but a real man can watch it too. I loved the romance that played out the ending was great, tears flowed and smiles, and laughter!!!",1341705600,,747,4.335714285714285

However, if you're like me and love to read the books behind movies, you will be very disappointed with this movie.  If you liked the movie and want to go more into depth with the story, I would read the book!  The best part of the movie was Gerard Butler - definitely made the movie.

Songs we loved and purchased the CD for and they are no where to be found!

1. Gerard Butler - ""Galway Girl"".

3255584,5,B000YAA68C,"First, if you read the book (I did not), don't expect the movie to match this - here's the thing THEY NEVER DO, EVER. I read Stephen King books, watch some the movies, the movies are never as good as the books because a movie budget cannot match our imaginations. Secondly, if you know you don't like Swank or Butler - then just don't watch the movie to begin with, but don't watch it and then complain about how much you can't stand to watch them. This is a great movie - people are so used to the ending that they expect (ie Swank ending up with Connick) that they can't appreciate a movie that deviates from thier expectations. I didn't see that they had any chemistry to begin with anyway. I love him as a musician and actor, but thier characters had no spark together and this was apparent from the beginning, it was right that they didn't end up together. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is adorable, him and Swank go great together. I also find it funny that people will complain about how this movie ""wasted thier time"" etc, if so - why write a 3 page review about it? Isn't that wasting more time?

3255589,5,B000YAA68C,"Cleverly written and beautifully acted, this movie would appeal to just about anyone, I think.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the Yankee stadium scene.  There are a couple of scenes that were deleted that I think would have made it a better film if they had been included instead of the Yankee stadium scene.

Hillary Swank is great in this movie and she's not alone.  The entire cast was fantastic.  This movie runs the gamut of emotional highs and lows.  It is funny and tragic, devastating and hopeful.  You will not go wrong by deciding to watch this one.

On second thought, I'm gonna five it 5 stars because I enjoyed it so much.  Even with the scene I think could have been done much better.  :)",1323388800,,714,4.340909090909091
3255590,5,B000YAA68C,"Love this movie. One of the few I could watch over and over. Kind of like re-reading favorite parts of  ""The Princess Bride"" by William Goldman, and still smiling and finding it humorous. When you love something, you want to experience it again and again. Perhaps I love it because I've lost so many loved ones in the past seven years, and this movie is all about love and loss and dealing with life when you just don't think you can get out of bed. It's a story of a flawed woman who despite her flaws, is truly loved. About a man who reaches beyond the grave and helps her to deal with life again.

There's realism to this movie--not just a smooth, easily flowing, wrap it all up by the end type of movie, although there is a bit of that too. This one is somewhat messy and disjointed along the way. Again, just like real life. Ups, downs, laughter, crying, some weirdness thrown in. Unexpected in places, awkward in others. If you've lost someone you love, this movie carries you along, and leaves you in a better place mentally and emotionally than where you started.

I laughed I cried (most of the time) then I bought it and made my sisters and my mom watch it and they laughed and cried. The entire cast was great, Gerard is so handsome and Hilary Swank did a good job as Holly. I don't understand these one star reviews, maybe the people who read the book before watching the movie have valid complaints but anyone who said this is slow and boring and they hated it because Harry Conick Jr. didn't end up with swank in the end are just ignorant in my book. I was actually pleased that the two characters didn't end up together, just friends seemed way more appropriate. He spends the better part of the movie basically telling Holly to get over the man she loved so deeply. I guess if you have never been in love you wouldn't understand but I would say a year of mourning is not long at all. I love this movie, and would highly recommend it!

A friend of mine brought it to my home one evening for a girl-talk + manicure session, and an inner part of me groaned...

""Oh no -- here comes cheesiness...""

I felt guilty for looking down on this movie before even watching it, because after thoroughly enjoying it I realized how wrong a person can be when he or she jumps to naive conclusions.

Is this story cheesy? In many ways, yes. Movies of this sort usually are.

BUT -- the reason why this movie overcomes its groan factor is because Hillary Swank and Gerard Butler are so believable. I didn't think they'd have much chemistry, but they make the story work.

I won't ruin the movie for you, but it's a cute story that leaves one with pangs of longing for something beautifully similar to happen to herself.

3255672,4,B000YAA68C,"`P.S. I Love You' is a strange film in that it manages to be both funny and sad at the same time.

When Holly loses her husband, Gerry, to a brain tumour she really struggles to come to terms with her loss.  Then on her 30th birthday she receives the first of many letters from Gerry that he wrote before he died.  These comfort and guide her through her grief and set her back on the path of her life again.

This film has some genuinely funny moments, some of which come from Lisa Kudrow, and one minute you will be feeling choked up from a particular scene, only to be laughing in the next.  Swank is ok as Holly and Gerard Butler is good as Gerry, but I have to say one of the stronger performances comes from Kathy Bates, which is no surprise whatsoever as she always is a class actress.

This has some wonderful flash backs of Holly and Gerry's early relationship and some of the surprise's he springs on her in the letters are poignant and heartfelt.  This is a bit of a `chick flick' (which is no criticism, more an observation), but it is done very well and despite being a little over-long, it is a touching enough film with an original storyline to keep you interested.  Some parts of this film are superfluous (like Harry Connick Jr's character who could easily be cut with no loss to the film), but I guess they add an extra dimension that would otherwise be lacking.

All in all this is an engaging and reasonably emotional film and it's gentleness is offset by it's humour, which makes for an entertaining combination.  This is worth a viewing at some point and makes a nice way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon.

3255674,5,B000YAA68C,"When Gerry (Gerard Butler) finds out he doesn't have much time left to live, he plans a sort of scavenger hunt for his beloved wife Holly (Hilary Swank). A few weeks after he passes away, Holly gets the first surprise in the mail, and each surprise leads to another letter from her deceased husband. Some of Gerry's messages force her to go out and spend time with her friends, thereby taking her out of mourning and letting her enjoy everything beautiful about life that she had forgotten about.

Indeed, I thought it was a beautiful story. I know some reviewers said it was very predictable, and while you do get the idea that Holly is slowly moving on to bigger and better things, the story is not that obvious otherwise. At times, Holly feels like relapsing and going back to depression; at other times, we find out a surprise about herself or one of her friends. People who love romantic comedies will find this movie adorable; people who do not will still find it bearable.

And the concept behind what Gerry did is great too. Surprises for a sad person can be helpful in lifting them up. And while you shouldn't cling on to the past too tightly, letters from a loved one who is gone are a wonderful keepsake to remember them.",1299974400,,1232,4.520179372197309

Before he dies, Gerry Kennedy (Gerard Butler) - the pluckiest victim of a brain tumor since the stiff-upper-lipped Bette Davis faced-down a similar fate in ""Dark Victory"" - comes up with an ingenious way to continue giving Holly (Hilary Swank), his soon-to-be widow, advice from beyond the grave.  He composes a series of upbeat letters to be delivered to her at regular intervals after he`s gone - missives that contain specific instructions on how to pick up the pieces of her shattered world and move on with her life.  You see, Holly was kind of an uptight stick-in-the-mud when they were married, and now the too-good-to-be-true, happy-go-lucky Irishman wants to loosen her up by getting her to perform karaoke, sending her on an all-expenses-paid trip to the place of his birth, and encouraging her to become a cobbler (I kid you not).  But will Gerry's continued presence in his widow's life actually retard her ability to let go of the past and start anew?  And does this ""Ghost"" knockoff stand a ghost of a chance of becoming as universally beloved as that earlier husband-hanging-around-after-death romantic classic?

Beyond the cringe-inducing creepiness of its premise, ""P.S. I Love You,"" based on the novel by Cecilia Ahern, is one of those annoying romantic comedies in which the women get all goofy, frisky and/or tongue-tied the moment some good-looking guy so much as steps into their line of vision.  Moreover, Gerry is portrayed as such a saintly figure, both before his demise and most definitely thereafter, that we never get to know him as a real, flesh-and-blood person in his own right; instead, in order to make all the ladies in the audience swoon over his magnificent romantic spirit - one, I might add, that no man in the real world has the slightest hope of ever living up to - writer/director Richard LaGravenese has seen fit to deprive Gerry of all those flaws each of us is entitled to just for being a member of the human race - and which are truly the only things that make a character interesting in the end.  And with that crucial dimension missing from the couple's relationship, we soon lose interest in Holly as well.  And, of course, the movie cheats by having Gerry's illness take place entirely off-camera, so as not to disturb the light romantic tone of the piece, but it does little to make us care about the couple.  The movie finally hits on some honest sentiment round about the 115-minute mark, and the story does avoid going down one painfully obvious narrative pathway towards the end, but, by that time, it's much too late to undo the damage.

A large cast of well-known and talented actors - Kathy Bates, Lisa Kudrow, Harry Connick Jr., among them - do yeomen work with poorly written parts, but it's an uphill slog against bathos, pratfalls and contrivance all the way.

3255828,5,B000YAA68C,"SPOILER WARNING:  Do not read this review if you don't want to be spoiled!

I just got finished watching this movie that I just rented here on Amazon.  Gerard Butler is one of my favorite actors of all time. Actually because of The Phantom of the Opera, he is my favorite actor of all time.  This was one of very few of his that I never seen before so I had to see it.

This film is a very, very sad film and it made me cry actually.  The very beginning of the film, you see that Gerard Butler has died and I couldn't believe how quick it was into the film.  Not even ten minutes and he's gone.  I really loved how it showed her grief for him and you could tell how much she really loved him.  He obviously really loved her too to go through the act of having her mother send her all the letters from him which you don't learn it's from her until the end of the film.  I loved all the flashbacks and I really started to cry from that moment when she returns from Ireland and go to her mother and cries and they go to the park and she gets the last letter and has Connick Jr.  read aloud the last letter.  What's written in the last letter is so sad and emotional.

To be honest, I never knew before I saw this film that Gerard dies in the beginning.  I never knew the plot and obviously never read the book.  So I was really expecting a romantic comedy and thought they would be together in the end.  But I was wrong and even though it's not what I expected, the fact that this film was able to move me, make me cry and I could relate to how she was in the grieving sense, I highly recommend at least a rental.  It's very emotional and sad.  I really enjoyed it.  And Ireland's scenery is gorgeous!",1273708800,2,1698,4.014925373134329
3255829,4,B000YAA68C,"The best parts of this film were the scenes with Butler and Swank together -- both before his death and afterward via flashback.  Especially fresh was the scene when they first meet in Ireland (via flashback), and when Swank meets Butler's parents.  I would have liked to see the couple's relationship develop from the beginning, rather than using a contrived death and the business with the constant letters, which to me, got in the way of how these characters actually felt toward each other.  When one tells a story it is usually recommended as being more effective when one shows how, rather than tells how.....and the letters made it into a story that is told rather than one that is shown...the flashbacks SHOW how their romance began, and that is why they are so appealing and interesting.  Butler and Swank have plenty of star power, sex appeal, and certainly the acting chops for these roles.  The contrived letters took up so much time that I finished the film wishing it had had a more conventional plot.....if she had gone over to Ireland to see him before their marriage, meet his family, and so on, the actors had enough skill to make that fresh and new, but perhaps that has been done to death; at least they did not make the Irish look like yokels or buffoons; Gerry's parents seemed incredibly real, open, considerate, and sweet, and it would have been interesting to see Gerry with his parents, but we are not given that chance.  And Swank's delight in realizing that they did not hate her for ""taking Gerry away from them"" to live stateside was quite nice and refreshing.  None of the ""Meet the Fokkers"" stale stupidity in these scenes whatsoever.  Also the ending, where Swank and Bates arrive in Ireland was nifty.  Why did they not do more of that, develop that?  Instead we got the usual ditsy Lisa Kudrow (not my favorite) doing her usual innane thing -- who wants to watch Kudrow when you have Swank and Butler?  They only acted together for about 15 minutes at the beginning and end.  I just felt the plot was contrived to squeeze as many tears out of the audience as possible and I was hoping for more showing how their relationship developed.  Hope to see Butler in many more romantic comedies.  His comedic, romantic skills are SO appealing and his talents wasted in action flicks (300?  DOH!!  So ridiculous.)  I thought Swank was credible in a feminine lead, however, except in the flashback scene in Ireland at the end where they first meet, she seems mostly cranky in her scenes with Butler, which makes one wonder why his character would put up with her, since she seems to spend most of her time complaining and picking fights.  Why would such a happy-go-lucky guy like Gerry even stay with someone who constantly finds fault?  She was so sweet and open when they first met in Ireland, and willing to go along with the mad-dog story Gerry was giving her even though she knew the sheep dog was tame.....it would have been cute to go more with that lightness.  I would also have loved to see how her shoe designs grew out of her life with Gerry and her delight in him....  Kathy Bates was terrific; Harry Connick creepy -- a weird character who one minute was acting logically, and loaded with self-respect and a clear view of himself, and the next blurting innanities and acting depressed and self-defeating.  Why was his character even IN the film?  I cannot see how his character moved the plot forward at all.  Just some thoughts.",1273449600,2,3467,4.636661211129296

3255833,5,B000YAA68C,"I got sucked into this movie when it was recently broadcast on TV - I had read some terrible reviews when it came out, didn't like the previews, and wasn't interested in seeing it at all.  I think the music initially captured my attention the other night on TV but I was drawn into this movie and loved it.  A weepy that's for sure, and while very funny at times, I would not say it's a romantic comedy.  Reflecting on the movie I can see that the supporting characters are not very three dimensional, and of course it's all rather unbelievable if you think about it too much, but the acting was great, music great, I bought it all the whole time I was watching.  It does make you think about your relationships with friends and spouse, and think about how you treat people in life as if they are always going to be there until suddenly they are not.  For a supposedly light weight film, that's pretty good.  I didn't find it creepy or icky as some people have - I thought it was thought provoking in questioning what  is the ""best"" or ""right"" way to deal with the death of a loved one.  And I'm buying the film because I'd like to watch it again, experience the characters again, and hear the great music and see great shots of Ireland.",1270771200,2,1237,4.301724137931035
3255834,4,B000YAA68C,"I must admit I had fairly low expectations for this film, as I was not a big fan of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freedom-Writers-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B000NOK1KM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freedom Writers (Full Screen Edition)</a>, the work of the previous partnership between Hillary Swank and director Richard LaGravenese.  I was also mixed about Gerard Butler as a romantic lead...thought he was borderline cartoonish in the Katherine Heigl vehicle&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ugly-Truth-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B002P413IC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ugly Truth (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;but very effective as 'The Stranger' in the underrated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dear-Frankie/dp/B00094AS9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dear Frankie</a>.

With that backdrop, I was very pleasantly surprised by this film.  I underestimated the impact of the Hillary Swank Likability Quotient.  [Her inherent likability being one of the big factors in her two Oscar wins.]  The opening scene of the movie is a revelation - a very well done 10-minute or so extended dialogue between Swank and Butler that presents the current state of their relationship about 11 years in.  The movie then goes forwards and backwards in time from there.  The quality of the acting is set in that first scene though - Hillary Swank's uncommon attractiveness and standout acting together with Gerard Butler's charm and ease of manner make for real chemistry.  As compared to, say, the fairly dreadful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Did-You-Hear-About-the-Morgans/dp/B0021L8UZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Did You Hear About the Morgans?</a>&nbsp;where I wouldn't have imagined Sarah Jessica Parker and Hugh Grant's characters together in a thousand years, you could fully envisage these two as a couple.  LaGravenese only strengthens that by providing you the back story of their relationship as the movie progresses.  When you finally get back to when the two characters first meet, you can see how and why Butler was immediately smitten.

One casting note: Gerard Butler and Jeffrey Dean Morgan - a Scot and Yank respectively - are the two leading Irishmen.  Seriously?  They're both good, but not a single Irishman could be rounded up for either of these roles?

The DVD Extras were a bit disappointing - no ""making of"" vignette (a little odd - usually a sign of people disassociating themselves from a film of questionable quality, which can't be the case here).  But kudos for a neat little (and kitschy) primer on ""The Name of the Game is Snaps.""

I also have to make a snarky comment about the summary of the movie on the DVD sleeve found inside my red envelope (hint, hint).  The first line of the summary states that Swank's character is Dublin-based.  Huh? Do these synopsis-izers even watch these movies?",1270512000,2,2978,6.275184275184275

While the twist of an Irish side to the movie does add some changes to what could be a fairly cliche storyline I am not amazed.  The acting is well done and the storyline does follow a consistent path, mainly humor is the key in this flick.  There are several awkward situations of laughter that bring this closer to enjoyable.  It is not a bad movie but it's just not my personal choice, it would seem to be one of the better films in this genre.

3255863,1,B000YAA68C,"Whoever dredged up the concept for this movie must either be desperate or sick, or both.  The thought of receiving frequent letters from your dead partner over the space of a year after his death is a slap in the face for grief, common sense and mental health.  That a reviewer (someone from 'Westwood One' - who the heck are they ?) endorsement on the front cover of the Blu-Ray is quoted as describing this as 'The best romantic comedy in a very long time' defies belief ! If I had been able to see that sole 'official' review on the case I would never have made the purchase.  Remember, if they can only get a positive review for publicity from someone/somewhere you've never heard of, caveat emptor applies. BEWARE !

This movie is neither romantic nor remotely funny.  The Amazon official review warns you to have tissues on standby - they are not for tears, rather your stomach contents as you wade your way through this tasteless and unfunny film.  Did it even have a theatrical release ?  I'd be surprised, as in my opinion, it doesn't even deserve a straight to DVD release.

There seems little point in commenting on the acting as the script and concept are so repugnant you don't even notice the actors that much.

Not only was this tasteless it was also extremely boring.  How this could be described as a romantic comedy is beyond my comprehension.  How others can swoon over it is also beyond my understanding, as this film trawls the bottom-of-the-genuinely-tasteless barrel.

I never particularly cared for Hillary Swank before this (I think it all started when she played ""the next karate kid"" lol) but now I really like her as an actress. It's such a beautiful movie with a beautiful love story that ended too soon, but such is life...rarely ever fair.

I absolutely hate being manipulated emotionally and that is what I expected but most of the relationship between Holly (Swank) and Gerry (Butler) is revealed through flashbacks. The movie starts with an annoying and somewhat amusing overtly long fight between the couple. The next scene shows his funeral so the viewer doesn't get too caught up in the story of them, ending up chewing fingernails in dread waiting for the moment the story changes in a bad way.

A feel good chick-flick where the heroine moves out of a rut, wins self-respect and becomes a better person for surviving pain.

A naked man backside parades across the screen and Lisa Kudrow's character plays the field like a talented trout fisherwoman...(is that PC?) tossing bait out and whipping it back, moving with the current til the prize fish bites.

This is what I liked about it:
1. The story was mostly about Holly and Gerry, and was not the context of her next relationship.
2. I worried that his letters would only cause her to hold to his memory all the more, but was pleased to see how they freed her to continue her life.
3. Her grieving process was real. At the risk of sounding morbid, I have to say it pleased me to see her go through intense grief. It made her character more real and likable and also gave credit to the strength of their marriage.

This is why I only gave it three stars (if I could have given it a rating of 3.5, I would have):
1. This is a minor one--all those designer clothes from eBay? Yeah right.

The men on the other hand are all handsome, kind and insightful with token superficial flaws. They try to imply complex relationships but in the arguments I always end up siding with the guys because the women ""don't know what they want"" (as stated by female protagonist). I have to admit, it was genius giving the new love interest turrets so it wouldn't be socially unacceptable for him to move in on a widow.

There were a lot weak rom-com cliches, and contrived drama when I was hoping for a movie that had the worst and best moments love has to offer.

Well, I've watched this movie at least half a dozen times since then and it never loses a beat, if anything, you catch more and more of the little bits that are really funny with each viewing.  Harry Connick, Jr. is adorable as the 'wants to be more than a friend' character and both Gina Gershon and Lisa Kudrow play off each other very well.  Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler had terrific chemisty (even though his role is played mostly in 'flashback' sequences...)  The scenery in Ireland is just beautiful and the lack of needing any foul language or gratuitous nudity or sex to make the movie interesting and funny is very refreshing.

3256120,5,B000YAA68C,"It's been a LONG time since I've been this enchanted with a film.
Due to the sappy trailers, I avoided it on cable for months, but
finally sat down and watched it from beginning to end. Ever since
that first viewing, I've been hooked. I laugh every time, I cry every
time, I sit in awe every time, and enjoy each and every minute of this
lovely film, which I have since purchased on DVD.

What's to love? The movie seamlessly blends the story of the main
characters and their past with little confusion. The editing is almost
perfect. The cast is brilliant. Highest marks go to Gerard Butler and
Jeffrey Dean Morgan for their mastery of the dialect and their unbelievable
good looks and charm, as well as Harry Connick Jr., who nails the part of
the goofy, socially-challenged bartender. Though not a ravishing beauty,
Hillary Swank's performance is sympathetic and convincing, and Lisa
Kudrow and Gina Gershon are superb as her supportive sidekicks. Kathy
Bates also delivers a seamless performance as the grieving widow's mother.

What else is there to love? The movie's beautiful scenery. New York and glorious
Ireland are themselves characters in this lovely tale. I am also very partial
to the movie's soundtrack, the theme of which is bittersweet and romantic. Most
of all, you will love the film's whimsical and lighthearted approach to themes
that universally touch us all:  themes of love and loss, anger and confusion,
friendship and family, hope and despair. The storyline may be somewhat
implausible and there may be no husband on earth as charming and quiescent as
Gerard Butler's Gerry, but the mere suggestion that a man like he exists and that
the love he shares with Holly trancends his tragic death is worth the price of admission.

You don't have to be a ""chick"" or a sentimental sap to enjoy this movie. What you do need
is a heart. This film will surely touch it in all the right places. Five Stars!",1235174400,6,1920,4.7395209580838324

Although $53 million is a decent box office  gross (Notting Hill did twice that) almost no one ever saw this gem until it hit HBO. Experiencing it in 1080i made me convinced that 1080p would be spectacular and I was not disappointed.

The Irish scenes in particular, with their fields of wildflowers and greening meadows, are almost dreamlike. Such  cinematographic romanticism as a set for a tale of true love and discovery, makes PS I Love You a necessary buy for any decent Blu-ray library.",1234569600,3,661,4.990909090909091

3256124,5,B000YAA68C,"Great film by all means. Very romantic and sad at the same time.

Its about an American girl who was married to an Irish guy (Jerry) and they were both so much in love. Then, at the age of 35 he passed away from brain tumor.

Their relationship didn't end at that point. Before he died he prepared to her many letters that were planned to be sent in future dates. Letters asking her to sing at the Karoake (which she feared), reminding her of their beautiful moments together, planning trips for her with her friends, bringing her back to the place where they first met, and asking her to move on and fall in love with someone else.

She couldn't move on because she can't love anyone besides Jerry. She felt lonely many times. Her father left her and her mom at the age of 14, which made her promise herself to not be with any guy ever. Then she met Jerry who was a great man, but unfrotunately he died. She kept asking her self, why? What's the point?

In the end after facing the sad reality, she decided to move on. Actually, she probably will fall in love with that Irish singer (another guy) she met after Jerry died. We don't really know because the movie ended when she met him again in Ireland.

Quite a great film. I like it so much because at last I see a romantic movie that glorifies love between two married couple. All the other films describe love of unrelated couple, but this one was different.

Even though its sad, it teaches us the importance of being able to go one. People don't need to collapse when they lose someone they love. They need to know that this is life, and even if their loved ones have died, they are still alive in their hearts.

Wonderful movie, thumbs up",1234396800,4,1695,4.311320754716981
3256125,1,B000YAA68C,"I was very excited to see this film because I had read - and loved - the novel by Cecelia Ahern. The novel tells a charming and bittersweet story of a young Irish widow (living in Ireland) and her journey to build a new life after her husband dies of a brain tumor. The title, the character names and the device of the letters are practically the only elements of that story that remain in the film.

To begin with, the story is relocated to New York which did nothing to enhance its appeal. Americans also enjoy movies set in other locales (remember Circle of Friends, Notting Hill, Chocolat, etc.). Also, the casting of Swank did not seem to fit the Holly character portrayed in the book. For that matter, the character written for the film did not match the more spirited and likable widow of the book. Overall the screenplay was poorly written and the extensive rewriting made what had been an uplifting story more of a gloomy movie. In fact, the movie has a pervasive feeling of gloom (as opposed to grief). In the book, Holly and her husband had been happy together, though this does not come through as clearly in the movie. While Holly had not been as fulfilled in her work, she seemed to have been a happy person. Again, the movie Holly was quite different. I was actually relieved when it was over.

Given the glowing reviews others have posted, perhaps the movie is only terribly disappointing to those familiar with the novel. If you have read and enjoyed the book, be prepared to see an entirely different version of the story if you decide to purchase this film. You might want to Netflix it first.",1234224000,18,1612,4.517123287671233
3256126,5,B000YAA68C,"I never thought that I would say this, but `P.S. I Love You' is one of those movies that changed the way I viewed an actress, for the better.  Don't get me wrong; when Hilary Swank is on point she is ON POINT.  Just watch her stunning work in `Boys Don't Cry' or `Million Dollar Baby', both films garnered her Oscars.  The thing is, when you strip away the strength of the script or the power of the genre you have a substantial loss of talent.  Her performances in films like `Freedom Writers' or `The Core' and even `Insomnia' prove that she is not always `on point'.  That said, I was a little worried about how she'd fare with a romantic comedy (dramedy really).  I really thought she'd blow this one.

She nailed it.

I sat down to watch this movie with my wife because we are both fans of Gerard Butler (not because he's especially talented but more or less because he's nice to look at and or listen to) and we both adore the comedic talents of Lisa Kudrow.  We didn't expect too much, but what we got was a very nicely crafted tale of true love and the tragedy that is grief.

Holly and Gerry are a feisty married couple who obviously adore one another despite their differences.  This is seen in the opening scene (which lasts for like ten minutes) where they fight and then make up in a rather realistic manner.  That was my initial thought going into the movie; that it seemed real, and I wasn't expecting that at all.  Next we learn that due to a bran tumor Gerry has passed on.  Holly has a very hard time dealing with this, obviously, but she has friends and relatives intent of helping her through it.  It appears though, that the only one who can save her is Gerry, who comes back into her life through a series of letters he'd written and arranged to have delivered to her over the course of the next year.  With the help of these letters Holly learns to let go and find herself again, find that nave teenager Gerry first met and fell in love with; the girl with dreams and ambitions and a bright future.

Be forewarned, `P.S. I Love You' will most likely make you cry; or at least come very close.

The acting is very well done across the board.  Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon are both wonderful as Holly's closest friends.  I only wish that they had a little more screen time.  Kathy Bates is always wonderful, and her portrayal of Holly's protective mother is very genuine and moving.  I am not a huge fan of Harry Connick Jr., but he manages to be entertaining here.  I feel that his character was a little insensitive and rather unlikable at times, but it was what they were going for and he nailed it.

The stars of the show here are Swank and Butler who just ooze forth with chemistry that I didn't see coming.  We all know that Gerard Butler is a major dreamboat complete with a nice physic, an accent and loads of charm; but who would have thought that he was such a compelling actor?  He really nails his character inside and out and makes Gerry one of the most appealing men on screen.  I'm sure most any woman would love to have a husband like Gerry.  Swank blew me away with her mastery of her characters emotional fluctuations.  Holly is feisty one minute, giddy the next, defensive the next, heartbroken the next.  She's inspired and confused and aggravated and filled with adoration and she nails every shift, every feeling.  She gets every part of this woman right and delivers to us a complete and whole character, a person we can love and feel for.

Another thing I really appreciated about the film is that, as much as it is warm and sentimental, it never shies away from the harsh realities of grief.  Even the way that some of her friends deal with Holly, the way her mother almost resents her grieving at times, the way that Daniel can't seem to get passed the fact that there was a Gerry; the way that Denise and Sharon want to move on with their lives regardless of how that hurts Holly.  It makes for a much more realistic venture into the life of someone who has lost a loved one.

The world keeps on moving and eventually you have to catch up.

In the end I highly recommend this movie.  It is a truly above average film that understands how to make a romantic comedy that has the right amounts of dramatic tension and realism to make it more than just another genre film.  As far as these types of films go, this is truly one of the best.  This is a film that could easily get passed over by those who consider it just another one of many, but it rises to the challenge and becomes something much better than expected.",1233878400,5,4563,4.342384887839433

There are also several beautiful sequences shot in Ireland and a strong group of supporting cast members. Obviously, so much of the film's events are incredibly unrealistic, and I also didn't care at all for Holly's relationship with the oddball David (Harry Connick, Jr.), but fortunately the film resolved that subplot very well toward the end of the film.

3256217,3,B000YAA68C,"***CONTAINS SPOILERS***

P.S. I LOVE YOU is one of those films that falls firmly into the ""chick-flick"" category. The story surrounds the grieving widow, her mother, and her friends, and how they all come together to help heal after the death of the studly husband. Sound schmaltzy for you guys out there? It might be.

But it is unique for a couple of reasons...

First is that one of the main characters, Gerry (Gerard Butler,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300/dp/B000Q6GX5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300</a>) is dead. Although we meet him for a brief moment early on and during a series of flashbacks, he is, in essence, not there. We also don't get to watch him die. The death is startlingly quick, and it jerks the viewer to full attention because it is this sudden loss we see and feel via Gerry's wife, Holly (Hillary Swank,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freedom-Writers/dp/B000OONQ8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freedom Writers</a>), who also senses the loss of Gerry as extremely sudden -- due to a brain tumor, or so we're told.

The other interesting thing is that Holly learns more about her husband after his death than during their short marriage. She travels to Ireland (where they initially met) at the behest of Gerry who, during his illness, arranged for Holly to have a life after his demise. He does this post-mortem trickery by arranging for messages to be dropped off to her at various times and from various people around New York. Initially seeming to be macabre, the story rapidly evolves into ...something more. Holly's trip to Ireland with her two best friends Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon) reveal to Holly that there's a lot more life out there after losing your soul-mate. And she finds it in unique and disturbing places.

Another unique quality was that Holly's mother, Patricia (Kathy Bates,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Compass/dp/B00139XZF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Compass</a>) turned out to be an accomplice within the entire story's machinations, something that took even me by surprise. Pleasantly. I also enjoyed the eventual dead-end relationship Holly ended up having with Daniel (Harry Connick Jr.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Iron-Giant/dp/B00009M9BK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Iron Giant</a>) that I thought would turn out very differently. And Holly's Ireland love interest, William (the hunky Jeffrey Dean Morgan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Weeds/dp/B0018B7E8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Weeds</a>) figures heavily in Holly's past and, possibly, her future.

But even with all of this uniqueness, the story as a whole turns out fairly predictable. The grieving widow heals (albeit unusually), friends help her, mother helps her, and new friends and lovers make her grope for reason and what her life now means. It is schmaltzy, so just be prepared for that. Your wives and girlfriends will probably love it if you rent it for them, though.",1229990400,2,3165,6.165532879818594

3256219,2,B000YAA68C,"I really need to stop watching romantic comedies at 3 a.m. My last gander was the 2007 chick flick P.S. I Love You, starring Oscar winner Hillary Swank and 300 hunk Gerard Butler. Why do I bother?

Holly (Swank) and Gerry (Butler) live in a small New York apartment and argue like normal couples, but they truly have a great life and love at heart. When Gerry dies from a brain tumor, Holly struggles with his death despite help from her family and friends. Shortly thereafter, on her 30th birthday, Holly begins to receive predated letters from Gerry. These treasures help her remember the good times, make new experiences, and find herself again.

She has had many an out there role, from The Next Karate Kid to Boys Don't Cry, but I wonder what it was that drew Hillary Swank to this role. Holly is by no means a pretty part. For some reason the character dresses like an idiot, and there's a lot of crying and why questions ala Nancy Kerrigan and the whole knee bashing thing. I can see the emotion in the grief and overcoming the death of a loved one, but for personal reasons alone, not from Swank's trying. I don't know what I'd do without my husband. Do I care if Holly gets over Gerry? Not really. She's given plenty of opportunity to do so, and after chance after chance, not only did I not care, but I wanted to smack Holly to her senses. Why Hillary, why?

P.S. I Love You was hyped largely as the next big thing after Gerard Butler's success in 300. I understand his not wanting to be typecast, and his work prior to 300 was quite diverse, from Dracula 2000 to The Phantom of the Opera. I just find this film of all the choices, to be so...weird. Some girls may be charmed by all the romance and such, yadda yadda, but otherwise, this is a very unflattering role. His singing is wrong here, and there isn't an Irish actor out there to fill our Irish onscreen Gerry's shoes? Not only is the whole `dead Gerry' and Gerry Butler vibe a little creepy, but he disappears halfway through the film-before the last letter arrives. I don't get it. Butler has one scene before the opening credits, then spends the rest of the film in flashbacks or as figments of Holly's imagination. It's as if the performance technically doesn't exist. Star Trek fans complain if an entire episode is a dream or a big reset button. It's not as if the ghost of Holly's dead husband is really haunting her, that would be worthwhile I think, ala The Ghost and Mrs. Muir. It would have to be funny, not serious, Ghost cornered that. I just don't see the appeal of a film that turned out to be a complete misstep for both leads. Why Gerry why?

Not only have the two leads been unfortunately miscast, but the absolutely stunning supporting cast of P.S. I Love You has been completely wasted. Oscar winner Kathy Bates (Misery) receives her token obligatory weepy scenes as Holly's mom Patricia, and Gina Gershon (Bound) and James Marsters (Spike, People! Spike!) disappear from the film with no explanation whatsoever. We get a tacked on reunion with Lisa Kudrow (Friends) and a cop out at Yankee Stadium with Harry Connick, Jr.(Copycat). I found myself more interested in these fine supporting players and their complex relationships, but their trials and troubles are dropped in favor of Holly's obvious and typical story. The eclectic mix has the comedic and dramatic-and heck musical-talent needed, but it's never used by writer Steven Rogers (Hope Floats) and director Richard LaGravenese (The Fisher King, Freedom Writers, and The Bridges of Madison County).

It's not woeful leads and misused support, however, that undoes P.S. I Love You- it's the whole dang story from author Cecelia Ahem. Maybe the movie took its liberties from the source novel, but I'm certainly not rushing down the street to Borders to get the book, that's for damn sure. The bemoaning of Holly just goes on and on. As I said, grief is something everyone can relate to, but enough with the letters already. They are too obvious and convenient. The first message is on a tape recorder. Why aren't all the others? In this day and age, Gerry couldn't videotape himself and email it to Holly everyday? How is she really expected to get over her dead husband if new information and good memories of him are technically coming from him after death?

Gerry and Holly are so poor, but he can plan elaborate bar trips and vacays to Ireland? And all this while dying of a brain tumor over the course of one year? The soul searching of what grief can do to one person is undone by the unrealistic nature of the story's plan. Never mind the horrid soundtrack and all that omigod chick stuff about turning thirty, marriage, divorce, babies, and looks. And after all this, how does Holly get on with her life? By designing shoes! Could you alienate the male audience more? I can't believe guys wrote and directed this.

Fans of the cast will tune in for P.S. I Love You, but I don't think it will be a Gerry dream for the ladies or a tour de force for Swank fans. The DVD supposedly has more scenes and interviews with Ahern-something I would normally find interesting, but I don't think its worth the full price of the disc.

Here's the skinny: Young Holly is married to Gerry, an Irish musician. The two live in a cramped walk-up apartment in New York, and they are trying to save some money and ""make a plan"" to start their family.

Reality intervenes. Gerry is diagnosed with a brain tumor and passes away. Holly is adrift in grief. Then, on her 30th birthday, a cake and a small tape recorder arrive at her doorstep. It's a message from Gerry. Apparently, Gerry planned these occasional messages to her for the first year after his death.

Each message gives Holly an assignment - buy a bedside lamp, go out with her girlfriends, take a vacation, find a better job. The assignments are Gerry's way of making sure that Holly's life goes on without him. (Sweet, no?)

I thought that Swank did a good job in this film, making a sometimes inscrutable character likable and warm. Butler was wonderful as Gerry, and there was a fabulous (all too brief) performance by Jeffrey Dean Morgan that practically had me weak in the knees. Harry Connick Jr. played Daniel, Holly's long-suffering friend, pretty well, too. (Oh, and Holly's clothes were really fun! Kudos to the costumer on that one.)

To recap - this is not a tour de force. This movie will not change your life or even make you think about it that much. But it will entertain you, and you may have to grab a Kleenex for some of the scenes. Great for a night in with the girls.",1228780800,2,1659,4.444078947368421

I'd seen the DVD box in stores for months, and was never moved to rent it; little did I know that I'd end up thinking it was one of the best romantic movies I'd seen in years. I'm a guy who doesn't immediately label a good love story a ""chick flick"" - ANY kind of movie that is driven by character and plot can hold my interest, and the best ones prompt me to write songs. I just finished one, because certain things about ""P.S. I Love You"" made me think of my own life.

P.S - I've never seen Hilary Swank look so gorgeous.",1228780800,3,592,4.103448275862069
3256222,3,B000YAA68C,"I don't even know how to tackle THIS movie.

It was like part comedy, romance, and drama all rolled into one.

In the beginning a woman and her boyfriend argue over and over again, to the point where you think they're going to split up and go their separate ways.  The arguing wouldn't STOP!!

Then, once the guy leaves the apartment room, he comes back in with a look of forgiveness on his face, and the woman comes running up to him and hugging him, and everything is all right again.

So the first 10 minutes of film were nothing but typical relationship arguing, and then things go back to normal.

NOW the weirdness comes in.

The boyfriend supposedly dies, but for some reason, nobody was upset about that.  None of the friends, or even the girlfriend herself, were nearly as upset as you'd expect.

It was at THIS point I was wondering if maybe I was watching a comedy and all that arguing in the beginning was just something not related to the main story in the least bit.  At the funeral they played a song for the boyfriend, and it had disturbing lyrics and everyone was singing along to the words, and even laughing while doing so.  I was VERY confused.

Then one of the friends of the girlfriend kept running up to random men and asking them a few short questions, and if she didn't like the answer, she'd walk away from the men disappointed.  This was a good part, though why hit on someone after her friends boyfriend just died?  Talk about ignorant.

Then, it gets even MORE bizarre.  Apparently the boyfriend wrote a series of letters to her girlfriend before he died.  Every couple of days (or weeks) a new letter would appear to the girlfriend, and I guess the letters were written as a way for the girlfriend to cope with his death, because the letters would lead the woman to a new (many times daring) adventure, such as going to Ireland and meeting another guy.

I just didn't understand who kept sending the letters to the girlfriend if the boyfriend was dead.  He obviously knew he was going to die and knew what would be best for his girlfriend as far as happiness and moving on is concerned.  So who was sending the letters?

Also, the character who played the mom was good because she was very serious all the time, and knew all the right answers.",1228521600,2,2273,4.442028985507246

Though the movie starts out in a 10 minute argument followed by complete confusion if you haven't read a review it tackles and tugs on every emotion a movie goer should have for this type of film.  From a males perspective, it was a little tough to get into at first but the movie grows on you as it continues.  Though my wife was multiple times from the first 10 minutes on the emotions gradually grew on me as well.

The story is really about true love and how it can continue on after death.  It is also a story of a husband who over time gives his surviving wife the ability to move on with her life as she knows it.  There are times when you want to cry, laugh, smile and just think about the story of this movie and imagine that something like this really could happen.

Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank0 has lost her husband (300's Gerald Butler). As she is in mourning over his loss, she recieves letters from her dead husband. From these letters, she starts to break out of her shell of widowhood.

With the help of her Girlfriends (Gina Gersion and Lisa Kudrow) and her mom (Kathy Bates), Holly starts to live again.

It is one of those nice romantic film to share with those you love. It is a throwback to the older 1950's type films where words and images are more important than car chases and curse words.

The Cast blends together so well you could believe this story is true. Swank's Holly is so on  the money, you feel her pain and joy

This is not just another chick flix, it is a well done romantic comedy. It will tug on your heart strings..if it does, check with your doctor to make sure you have a working heart.

Hillary Swank was horribly miscast.  She is not the least bit feminine, and I think the movie makers realized this because they spent far too much time having her prance around in her undergarments trying to convince us otherwise.  She needs to eat a meal or two!  Her lisp (or overbite) was very distracting and it was an awkward performance.  Most of the time her character was whining and complaining. It was very hard to believe that her husband Jerry (the gorgeous Mr. Butler) would have ever been attracted to her.

There was a secondary story involving Harry Connick, Jr. that showed some promise.  He did a fine job of portraying a cynic, burned one too many times by the opposite sex.  His love connection with Swank's character is painfully wasted in the end.  There was a very disappointing scene in which they kiss and decide it feels like they were kissing their respective siblings.

3256349,3,B000YAA68C,"************  SPOILER  **************

First is my disclaimer:  I am indeed a ""chick"" and needed a good cry and a good laugh when I rented this.

I perpetually resist the nudges of my good girlfriends to dive into your typical girl movies.  This one, however, was too tempting to leave on the shelf.  The cast alone drew me in and I was not disappointed by their performances.  Some inconsistencies in the story, however, pockmarked them.

In the beginning of the film after Gerry has passed on it is difficult to sort out the relationships between Kudrow, Gershon, Swanks and the sister.  Holly refers to her sister by relationship, but the other two females who tag along don't seem like best friends; rather, they appear to be more like cousins, more distant sisters or friends from work.  The relationship between those three never seems believable or relatable.  Regarding the handsome one night stand, that particular scene is entirely out of context with Holly's character.  As one reviewer pointed out, why doesn't Holly, the grieving survivor of a 10 year marriage, know who her late husband's best friend is? That seems like a fairly major hole considering the role he plays later in the movie.

Apart from the above and several minor other objections, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie's ""face value"".  The couple is cute (if not exceedingly so) and witty.  Together and void of any outside influences they fit their roles well.  I enjoyed their chemistry enough to cry when Gerry died.  I also loved watching Kathy Bates as Mom.  It's very easy to imagine her as the steely eyed mother sans sugar coating that is slightly less than comforting towards her daughter, but no less devoted.

All in all, if it's that time of the month, this is a good choice.  My three stars is based almost entirely on hedonistic value and not on merit.",1217980800,,1841,4.7993630573248405

Their give-and-take marriage of nine years, could have been much more successful for Holly and Geery.

My favorite personality was Holly played by Hilary Swank! Quite a uniquely romantic role after The Million Dollar Baby.  As this story developed, I became more enamored by Kathy Bates as Mother and the bar-tender William played by Harry Connick,Jr. After Geery's hysterical Memorial Service, the movie evolved into one great, compelling, fascinating Romantic Comedy!

The next uniquely interesting character was the Irishman, William! When Geery's carefully planned letters came to Holly, one was a suggested trip for her to travel to Ireland. There she came upon the deceased's former friend from childhood, William. Those letters continued for the first year's absence of her Beloved. Her three close girl friends insisted she was overdue for another sexually stimulating experience! For me it was a close tie between the romantic escapade and the beauty of the Irish country side.

3256386,4,B000YAA68C,"P.S.: I Love You is a good love story. I know, it's a chick flick. Well, it's a chick flick that has something to offer guys. Gerard Butler (300) is not exactly your soap-opera-idol type, nor is Hilary Swank (Million Dollar Baby). It's an interesting match, and makes for enjoyable interaction, both playful and feisty. Oh, did I mention that one of the couple dies in the first act?

Hold on. I didn't just ruin the movie for you. That's the main point: Gerry (Gerard Butler) is dying, so he clandestinely writes a stack of letters to his wife, Holly, each ending with, ""P.S.: I love you."" Then he has someone send them to her one-at-a-time over the course of a year. The letters guide Holly into a new life. And they provide writer-director Richard LaGravenese (Freedom Writers, Horse Whisperer) with a vehicle for doing a ton of flashbacks between Gerry and Holly. It's quite effective.

This is a comedy, and it is very funny. For the most part, Gerry's the funny man and Holly's the straight person. Gerry's a sly Irishman that knows how to wheedle; and Holly's a determined career woman that doesn't have a clue what she wants. As a matter of fact, Gerry asks her point-blank: ""What do you want?"" It is a poignant question that permeates the film. As Gerry holds his discontented wife in his arms, he says, "" I know what I want, 'cause I'm holding it in my hands. Do you?"" She doesn't. And it takes Gerry's death for her to figure that out.

Using post mortem love letters to reveal Gerry and Holly's relationship is quite clever. It is fun getting to know this off-the-wall couple: Gerry, an Irish musician, who is the life of the party and brings humor even to his own death; and Holly, the cautious and pensive artist, questioning everything and offering pithy observations. We see that they love each other very much; but, like many of us, Holly doesn't appreciate what she has until he's gone. Fortunately, she gets a second chance with Gerry's letters; and, predictably, over the course of the film, Holly realizes what she is missing and what she now wants.

The journey that Holly takes is painful for her, but fun for us. Most women will find it difficult to hold back the tears. But woven throughout are funny, even hilarious, moments, especially because of Holly's two wacky friends, played by Lisa Kudrow (Friends) and Gina Gershon (Rescue Me). Also, Harry Connick, Jr. plays an utter dork - but a philosophical one; Kathy Bates is Holly's practical mother - but a kind-hearted one; and Jeffrey Dean Morgan becomes Holly's new love interest - all entertaining performances.

Obviously, this isn't the first time the subject of what women want has been breached. Back in 2000, a film by that title, starring Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt, made a half-hearted though entertaining effort at answering that question. Advertising creative Mel Gibson miraculously acquires the ability to read women's minds, which leads him to believe he now knows what they want, and can turn that knowledge to his advantage. However, he is mistaken because - as Holly points out to Harry Connick's character in P.S.: I Love You - even women themselves don't know what they want. So, even if men could read their minds - as many women seem to think we should - that still wouldn't help. No, like women's handbags of generations past, women's minds will always and forever remain mysteries, and rightly so; until God chooses to reveal them, which, I predict, will leave a lot of guys with perplexing looks on their faces and uttering, ""You've got to be kidding."" I'm sure I will be one of them.

Gerard Butler and Hilary Swank are wonderful in P.S.: I Love You. Butler, who typically switches between action hero (300, Beowulf And Grendel, Tomb Raider: Cradle Of Life) and romantic lead (Phantom Of The Opera, Dear Frankie), has his best romantic role to date in this film. This is also the first time since Phantom that he has been able to show off his musical abilities. And, even though he's from Scotland, he is really Irish, so he has that going for him as well. But, don't expect him to have those abs from 300 - they are long gone.

Swank is a two-time Academy Award-Winning Best Actress: Boys Don't Cry (1999) and Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby (2004). She loves the outdoors (sky diving, river rafting and skiing), which makes her perfect for the scenes in Ireland - a very outdoorsy country and my favorite part of the movie, especially her scenes with Gerry. Swank is honey and vinegar personified - exactly what the good-natured Gerry needs and, between the two of them, the right chemistry for this romantic comedy.

If someone were to ask me, ""What do women want,"" I would say, ""I know what they need: a good pair of practical shoes. What they probably want is the most impractical, outrageous pair of designer shoes out there."" I would have said that before watching P.S.: I Love You. Now that I've seen it, it is extremely interesting to me that shoes do play an important role in this film, and in Holly's figuring out what she wants. If women ever did discover the joys and comforts of practical footwear, there would be a revolution. Suddenly, they would know exactly what they wanted, and there would no longer be a need for Hollywood, New York or Paris. I don't think that's going to happen in my lifetime.

This movie has pretty much everything a girl (at least this girl) could want.  The friendships between the women are realistic - they get mad at each other and then work it out.  The parent/child relationships are complicated - also realistic.  I highly recommend this movie.",1216857600,2,414,4.971014492753623
3256388,4,B000YAA68C,"Gerry and Holly married while they were young and free of worries. Years later they feel the pressure as the reality of marriage and all it entails kicks in. The scene starts off with Gerry (Gerard Butler) and Holly (Hillary Swank) emerging from the subway walking towards their home. The couple is arguing about their different views on life with emphasis on children, money and getting their dream home. The argument heats up to the point where Gerry storms out and quickly rushes back in and they fell in each other's arms and make wild, passionate love.

The credit rolls in and the next scene is that of Gerry's wake. The viewers are told that he has died of brain tumour at the young age of 35. The next three weeks see a decline in Holly as we see her spiralling down, crying and watching black and white movies, suffering from hallucinations of her late husband. Then as she sings along to Judy Garland, her mother (Kathy Bates) and best friends (Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon) walk in reminding her that it was her 30th birthday. They open a cake from Gerry and Holly thinks it's a prank until they play the accompanying tape recorder where Gerry tells her of his plan for her, how he has written letters which will arrive on various occasions. Those letters become a source of strength for her as she follows his advice and finds herself doing things she would never have thought herself. While Gerry has planned for the letters to serve as a guide for Holly to figure out what she wants in life, they serve as a way for the viewers to find out more about the couple and their beginnings.

The tasks include a trip to Ireland where we are treated to a spectacular view of the countryside and Ireland's splendor come to life. Here we see Holly meet another Irishman who turns out to be an old friend of Gerry's. We find out about her first meeting with Gerry and it is one of those moments that make a romantic movie truly heartmelting. Hillary Swank portrays the grieving and lost widow quite well and the supporting characters were good and added some much needed laughter.  The highlight for me though was Gerard Butler who was just truly charming. I think I am now officially a drooling fan. That smile is enough to weaken any woman's knees and any woman would understand how Holly could have fallen in love with a perfect stranger. I thought he was great as King Leonidas in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B000QXDEDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300 (Full Screen Edition)</a>&nbsp;yelling out ""This is Sparta!"" in his almost naked glory. But now he has been elevated to real sweetheart material after seeing him in this movie. And God I love a man who can sing.

P.S. I LOVE YOU, while far from perfect, is more than your average run-of-the-mill romantic movie.  While I find that the whole letters after death thing lacked plausibility (the cynical may even find it creepy), the idea is simply clever. It provided the sentimentalism that is certain to leave many readers teary and satisfied with the film.",1216598400,5,3088,4.829867674858223

I think I better take singing lessons, and start going back to the gym. Rent it, buy it, just make sure you see the movie.

3256390,3,B000YAA68C,"P.S. I Love You is a chick flick if ever there was one, and it employed a bunch of talented people who make it look really good.  I am the type of female moviegoer who didn't see any problem with Sean Connery playing the Mufti in The Wind and the Lion because he looked so good doing it.  Gerard Butler in this role is just as mesmerizing and intoxicating and is able to muster an Irish accent part of the time. There is also more eye candy.  Not since Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands have I felt guilty at having fun watching a movie about a grieving widow.  It is a comedy, isn't it.

It is not a perfect film, but it is enjoyable for all the emotional buttons it push and how it tickles the mind.  I loved the casting. Hilary Swank should do more comedy.  Her voice is suited to it.  It was fun to James Marsters being human and American. Nellie McKay is wonderful. The line --There is no such thing as a vampire slayer - might not be the funniest line but it tickled. The production value is high.  I enjoyed most of the sound track. A couple of married men saw it with their wives and each recommended it to me on separate occasions.  The message of holistic love about life is fruit for thought.  Yes, I did cry a little.  Also, I am giving the game of Snaps a try as a party game. Oh, this movie introduced me to the beautiful songs of Laura Izibor.

If you needed a theme to match other movies with this, I would pick some of the old ones Holly watches.  You could have a letter theme and watch it with The Love Letter.  For an Irish theme In America and Into the West both havie a theme of bereavement.  Dona Flor and her Two Husbands is a lot sexier and really goes for comedy, very faithly like the book by Jorge Amado.",1216080000,2,1729,4.101190476190476

Gerry (Gerard Butler) and Holly (Hilary Swank) are married, without children, and are very much in love. Swept off her feet at a tender age by the handsome Irishman, Holly isn't exactly sure what she wants from life, and this leads to petty squabbles and extremely hot making up afterwards.

Before they really get started, the Fates snip Gerry's thread, and Holly is left with a snazzy urn and an empty apartment, which she proceeds to fill with her blue funk.

Her thirtieth birthday brings a big surprise, as it seems that for once, Gerry has made a plan.  Gerry's gift goes on giving, and gradually Holly comes to terms with her life, while we, the audience, get to look on with unbridled glee.

Butler is as easy on the eyes as always, and Swank pulls off a difficult role with apparent ease.  Lisa Kudrow is a perfect friend, and Kathy Bates proves unsinkable.  Other good performances are logged by Gina Gershon and Harry Connick Jnr.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Sometimes even death can't end an undying love

A chick flick, but an extremely watchable one, especially for fans of Gerard Butler.

3256429,5,B000YAA68C,"I actually had low expectations for this movie, and I will admit that I was mainly interested in it because of Gerard Butler - he is beee-yooo-ti-ful... :)
Also, Hilary Swank is a wonderful actress, very talented, a double Oscar winner, so I figured, I would check this movie out. I am also not usually much of a chick flick watcher (even though I am a chick), I'm usually a big action adventure movie fan, intense dramas, that type of thing. I expected to have this movie on in the background, not really pay attention to it, work on other things, and only look up when Gerard Butler was on screen. So, from that perspective, this movie was a very big, very pleasant surprise.

Pretty much from the get-go, this movie grabbed my attention and lo and behold I didn't do any work at all while it was on (I tried a couple of times, but then I just had to rewind something I missed, so I happily gave up). A big part of this was the fact that I expected predictable dialogue, and a predictable story-line. A big credit to this movie belongs in the fact that it had very sharp writing, it actually dealt with things that seemed real-life. Of course there are lines here & there in the movie that are ""hollywood"", but for the most part, this movie has a lot of heart.

HUGE, HUGE, HUGE credit for this movie's heart & soul must go to Hilary Swank & Kathy Bates. These two ladies do an INCREDIBLE job in their roles, they imbue them with so much authenticity, I was really taken aback. In fact so much so, this movie actually had me crying repeatedly through it (thank heavens I didn't see this movie in public, that would have been very embarrassing & I would have most certainly run out of kleenex). Plus, it had me laughing in between! What an emotional ride this movie was, and I was somewhat prepared for ""heart-string pulling"" because I knew the premise of the movie.

In fact, it has been days since I watched this movie, and I keep thinking about it. It moved me, not only with the emotional journey of Hilary's character, what she learned, how she grew, but because it also makes you think about your own life. I find myself reflecting on my own relationships, appreciating them more, it really touched me. It also has a secondary theme about Hilary's character trying to find happiness in what she does for a living - lessons in finding your passion, and stop doing what doesn't make you happy, what you may hate, for a living.

This movie also has a measure of unexpected outcomes, which is a breath of fresh air. So many times we can predict what is going to happen, then when a movie doesn't do that, it's such a delight. This movie has lovely journeys of forgiveness, selfishness, confusion, what are our lives all about, who knows, but we keep putting one foot in front of the other.

I highly recommend this movie as a worthy watch. I loved it. And I want to visit Ireland soooo bad now!!! My heart is still tender, from the highs, the lows, the questions this movie raised. Hilary - wow, you are amazing in this role...I hope you will get the recognition you deserve for it.

This is a beautiful film. It's touching and memorable. What's her name is great as the female lead and that Spartan King dude does a brilliant job of playing a dead guy. This movie has the power to remind men how nice it is to be in love with someone you actually like.

Okay, a lot of guys will notice that this movie is missing the standard quota of murders, explosions, rapes and decapitations. But don't dismiss it fellas, there is still a fine story here.

I highly recommend ""PS, I love you."" Men, pass on the blood, cars and guns for once and rent this film tonight to watch with your girlfriend or wife. The evening will go well, trust me.

The formula here is girl lives happily with boy until he's taken from her by brain cancer, whereupon she loses herself. The satisfying ending comes only when his letters, written before his death to guide her recovery, help her wade her way through their past to find her future. It's clever, funny and fresh (if you can take the leap of faith and go with it), and the cast is excellent.

Unfortunately, the extras are lacking. The most interesting to me is the deleted scene at the travel agency, the only time we see the hero while he's dying, but with his sense of humor still very much alive.

3256462,5,B000YAA68C,"I simply ADORE this movie!  The fight that begins the film is what I label the perfect fight.  Holly is upset, Gerry doesn't know why, they get into an argument where both sides are coming from completely different directions with Gerry attempting to subvert Holly's anger with humor.  Which, of course as most women know, only makes her more upset.  They end up slamming doors then re-emerging to affirm how much they love each other and acknowledge the problems they have.  The most shocking part of the movie is in the next scene where Holly, her mother, sister, and friends are all at Gerry's wake.

3 of my friends went with me to see this movie on New Year's Day and we all cried through the whole film.  When we walked out of the theatre, we had plans to immediately drive to the airport and book tickets for Ireland.

First of all, being the red-blooded female that I am, Gerard Butler's character Gerry and his charming Irish accent and wonderful, sexy, sweet personality is enough to keep me interested for the 2 hours this film takes.  Second, being a fan of Grey's Anatomy, I couldn't help loving the naked rear view of Jeffrey Dean Morgan and his own charming Irish character.

But mostly what is to be loved about this film is the love Gerry had for Holly, so strong and so pure that, knowing he would die, he crafted a plan to keep Holly's life going for a year until she was able to move on on her own.  Unselfish, everlasting love.  Every couple fights, and none of them are perfect, every relationship has stresses and issues.  But, as the movie reveals, they were in love from the moment they set eyes on each other.  A love that never ended after they found the kiss that would ""end the world as they knew it forever.""  A love that wanted her to find love again and tried to make her view herself through his eyes - not seeing her flaws but the reasons for his devotion and why he wanted her life to be full for as long as she continued to be alive.

And, it's a comfort to know we don't lose Gerard Butler but continue to see clips of him throughout the film - Holly's memories played across the screen as she tries to move on with a life she felt hadn't started yet and now no longer includes the man she kept trying to start it with.

I enjoyed the acting as well.  I think Hilary Swank was very believable and her supporting cast of characters were dynamic enough to give the film the impression of a real life and what happens as lives move on and tragedies happen.  The plot was engaging throughout - I found myself anticipating Gerry's letters just as much as Holly and grieving along with her just as though I had lost my perfect, caring, charismatic soulmate too.

And I felt hope.  So many movies come along telling us stories of soulmates and second chances and following our hearts.  Some may call it clichd and overdone to the point of exhaustion.  But I say there are real-life examples of these fairytale movies, and exemplary examples such as P.S. I Love You need to be made to remind us of the hopes and emotions we experience in our everyday lives - hopes that shouldn't be abandoned because we are told to be ""realistic"" and settle for something less than we deserve.  True happiness is to be achieved by continuing our dreams, there is a reason why different people are drawn to different things.  These types of movies - disgustingly called ""Chick flicks"" - don't bring false hope, they bring out what we already feel inside and keep us motivated for the time it takes for us to figure out and pursue what we need in our lives.

This movie is sad, heartbreaking at points, but also humerous, engaging, sexy, romantic, hopeful, and realistic!  Holly can be stubborn, awkward, shy, dorky - and she's all the more human for the range of emotions and setbacks she goes through.  It's a movie of growth not just for Holly but for her family and friends as well.  People would do well to watch not for a gush of sentimentality and cathartic tears, but as a reminder of our flaws, our feelings and our dreams.

Oh, and the music is GREAT!  I bought the soundtrack just for ""Love You Till the End"" by the Pogues and ended up loving several other songs.  The Irish ""If I Leave this World Alive"" and the first track ""Everything We Had"" AND the last track ""My Sweet Song"" are lovely!  I have some new favorite music to compliment my classic 60's and 70's songs, alternative, Indie, rock, selective pop, etc.",1213315200,4,4437,4.444993819530285

Why did they cram so much info together? I would have gladly sat thru a couple of scenes for 10 more minutes. Budget, I guess.
I would have really been lost if I hadn't known he was going to die. The family members at the funeral were difficult to recognize as again no real background info except one previous sentence about the mother. It seemed that we to infer alot, too much in my estimation.
The whole movie seemed to revolve around sex. I thought this was a love story. Once again Hollywood tries to prove a misnomer. Sex first, equals love later.
The best part of the whole movie was the end. Scrap the whole movie and start from there. Now there's a plot. A widow visiting the parents of her deceased husband and meeting someone interesting who turns out to be a close friend of her husband and for a kick her bitter mother finds love in his dad.

3256496,2,B000YAA68C,"Rarely (like, almost never) has a film come along with such a gulf between its critical reviews (ie, professionally-considered notions of 'quality') and its popular reception.  The professional film critics universally say this stinks worse than a boiled cabbage and corned beef dinner left in the sun.  Yet the reviews I received from enthusiastic friends were the polar opposite.  They laughed, they cried, they hadn't seen such a touching and memorable movie for years, they were definitely going to buy this for their own.  Letting friendship win out over criticism I rented it.  Sadly, I have to side with the critics, whose judgement about the many flaws in this film is spot-on.  Not since ""Love, Actually""  has there been such a talented cast of A-list actors put to such superficial, sitcommy use.  This often plays like an extended episode of ""Friends Go to Ireland"" and would have done even without the presence of Lisa Kudrow as one of Swank's neglected BFFs. Though there are many pretty views of Ireland and New York respectively, they are as glossy, flat and uninhabited as a postcard.  Hillary Swank is a gifted actress in tough roles, but she decidedly lacks softer qualities of vulnerablity or self-parody, both of which are pretty much obligatory for romantic dramedy heroines.  She tries very, very hard, though and is to be given credit for trying.  She also displays a very passable voice doing Judy Garland and a scene of her doing karaoke shows something of a flair for physical comedy.  The script is unsure whether to lean more heavily toward rom-com fluffiness ala ""13 Going on 30"" or pathos and winds up being an uncomfortable mish-mash of neither.  This film suffers from the same problem that hobbles all From-Beyond-the-Grave love stories: it's impossible to plug the dead spouse into the movie in any way other than flashbacks or contrived sequences where the bereaved talks to a figment in an otherwise empty room.  Though the device of daily letters from beyond the grave could be effective, the fact that they come from a free-wheeling soul who was not known to put pen to paper while he was living is a tad problematic.  Surely footloose musician Gerry might have devised other methods to communicate with his wife . . .songs, perhaps.  The problem for the audience is that we get exactly one scene with Gerry before his abrupt departure, so it's hard to really know What Would Gerry Do?  Director LaGravanese attempts to answer this question with a series of flashbacks that go chronologically backwards, so that near the end of the movie, we have come to the very beginning of Gerry and Holly's relationship.  Unfortunately at this point, LaGravanese commits a Fatal Movie Faux Pas previously seen in ""Laws of Attraction"" by having his protaganists collide in an utterly fantastical Meet Cute on the Roadside in Ireland.  Since such Meet Cutes on the Irish Roadside must hardly ever happen to actual Irish people, what are the chances that every American woman in Ireland on a tourist visa would have a Meet Cute with the likes of Gerard Butler or Pierce Brosnan?  Alas, I had already lost my ability to suspend my disbelief in this film long before this Meet Cute happened.  After a fairly promising start, ""P.S."" falls flatter than an Irish soda bread without the soda.  I give this movie two stars for the gorgeous views of Ireland and the equally gorgeous views of Gerard Butler and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, as well as some great soundtrack numbers.  Worth a rental for the legions of female Gerard Butler fans out there, though the male fans will want to skip this and rent ""300"" again instead.",1213056000,6,3633,4.862012987012987
3256497,3,B000YAA68C,"This is a pleasant romantic comedy. Gerry Butler is certainly engaging enough as the male half of the equation. Hillary Swank plays such a high-pressure female always flying off the handle and finding it hard to relax. It was hard for me to see any chemistry between her and Butler or anyone else for that matter. There are some beautiful shots of Ireland in the Blu-Ray transfer, and the sound is quite nice. The story line is based on a very comprehensive plot that Butler concocts, that I find difficult to believe he could have forseen or even afforded to pull the scheme off. The whole magilla kind of peters out in the last reel and ends fortuitously for all (almost as if the studio had to call it quits on the film and end it happily). Enjoyable, but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it (it's a date movie after all--cleverly designed to make us guys feel totally inadequate).",1212969600,3,892,4.478527607361963

3256542,5,B000YAA68C,I've read most of the reviews and as with any film they vary.  I personally loved this movie.  The cast was great!  It was a love story -- very bittersweet -- but the love the lead character had for his wife was unselfish in that he truly did understand her and believed in her enough to help her find her dreams and fulfil them.  It was a story of a mother and daughter gaining a better understanding of each other.  That was so touching.  It was a story of friends and how they are not always in the same place emotionally and that the friendship can survive the hurts with understanding.  It was a tear jerker --- but it was thought provoking too.  I will watch it again.,1212192000,2,674,4.2109375

3256566,1,B000YAA68C,"I love Swank & Butler, & Bates.
The movie begins (uncomfortably) with a very contrived fight scene that doesn't work and isn't staged well. Butler, while beautiful, only seems at home in the scene in Ireland. All the other flashbacks never work quite right.  Bates is good as the Mom, but all through the movie I felt I was missing something.
The friends setup doesn't work - there's no chemistry between Kudrow, Gershon & Swank. It always seems awkward. Also awkward was the one-night stand Swank has with Billy Gallagher. That just did not seem in keeping with her personality throughout the movie. How odd.
The kareoke scenes were TORTURE.
Literally two-hours of self-pity for a young woman who's lost her husband. Connick Jr.'s Daniel wasn't silly or unlikable enough so you end ticked off because you're led to believe they'll be together.
Not much about this movie was likable. The actor who played Billy Gallagher was very good and him telling Holly stories about Jerry was endearing. That's about the best thing I can say. And the Irish scenery was gorgeous. I can't recommend this movie.",1211932800,20,1096,4.86096256684492

Nor could I understand how good the film could be without Holly's brothers, or father. If you enjoy the film, please, please read the book. You may appreciate the story much more fully if you do.

3256571,4,B000YAA68C,"I'll start off by saying I do not enjoy melodrama or Hilary Swank in particular very much.  So, I was surprised twice by this movie, which I've watched several times with my wife.

The story focuses on Holly (Swank) as she is trying to move past her loss but is still receiving reminders of him that he had arranged to send her before his death from a tumor.  We don't see much of Gerry (Butler) while alive, but we do see him through Holly's memories and in her imagination here and there.  In the course of the movie Holly does come to terms with her loss though it never really resolves if the after-death reminders from him were a help or not.  In the end, you get the impression that they did help her, but in watching the film you can see that there is obvious pain resurrected in her each time she is confronted with them and the places they lead her.

As the lead, Hilary Swank completely delivers as Holly.  I found myself laughing and grieving with her and she brings real substance and emotion to the character of Holly.  Gerry isn't present as much, but Gerard Butler gives a solid performance as the sometimes cocky and over-sure Gerry but gives the character charm and sweetness to.  Some of the moments of chemistry between the two were some of the best I've seen in film in a while.  I don't know how they work together when the cameras weren't rolling but they delivered a solid image of your typical married couple here.

The supporting characters run the usual gambit of good and bad.  Sometimes necessary to further the plot or breath new life to the story and at other times out of place and jarring with the theme of the story.  I found a few moments where the humor they deliver is hard to take in after the sad tension of the previous scene.  However, the casting was well done with many likable actors.

P.S. I Love You ends as you would expect it to and does a fairly good job at resolving Holly and giving her a chance at future happiness.  Although, there is a sadness to the film as well, as the impression you have of Holly and Gerry together is hard to move beyond.  If you have parallels to this scenario in your own lives then I imagine this to be quite touching - for good and bad.

Ultimately, I have to recommend the film despite my previous acknowledgment that romantic drama stuff usually isn't my game.  If your girl is in for a sappy flick then you could do worse than P.S. I Love You.",1211414400,4,2425,4.337028824833703
3256572,5,B000YAA68C,I would have to say that p.s. I Love You was better then the Notebook. I Loved everything about this movie. It's Number 1 on my top favoite movies.,1211241600,4,147,4.103448275862069
3256573,3,B000YAA68C,"Ok, I like Hilary, Gerard, Kathy, Lisa, and Harry.  These are great, watchable actors, and I was so excited to see this movie.  That's problem number one- too much hype and expectations.  My little voice kept saying: ""There's something amiss when the main actor(Gerard Butler) is essentially dead.""  Especially for a kind of romantic comedy.  My little voice was somewhat right, but thank goodness for Gerard!  The first half of the movie drags, and you wait and wait only for him to return, and when he does, it's great!

The second problem is I read the reviews beforehand, and it was so up and down in opinions that the voice yelled at me again, ""Something's afoul.""  It turns out there's an edge to the movie's demeanor.  For example, Harry Connick, who should star as a wonderful lead and potential romantic type, is made into a bit of a buffoon, and you're suppose to love him for it?  In one scene, Hilary pulls him into a closet.  He tells her that he has this 'rude syndrome', that he can't filter his words, and that his girlfriend ran away with another woman, and that he was reduced to seeing hookers but now the money's run out.  Ok.  Gosh, I hope you've got enough dough leftover for your HIV tests.

Frankly, the best part of the movie takes place in Ireland.  The scenes with her girlfriends are hilarious, especially in the boat.  Now that's more like the fun escapism one expects in a 'romantic comedy'; however, *SPOILER ALERT* she quickly jumps in bed with another Irishman.  Well, her friends urged her on, and besides, she's lonely and horny and hasn't been with a man for a little while.  He turns out to have been ""Best mates"" with Gerard's character.  ""Hey, we share everything,"" the new guy says to her after the fact.  Adding, ""Oh,I didn't mean it like that.""  Well, how did you mean it?  And gee, I hope you used good American condoms.*END ALERT*
She returns home to New York and the finale is definitely more satisfying, but to get there has, at times, been a sour process.

Gerard Butler shines in any movie, anytime; Hilary Swank is fine; although, here she must portray a difficult character, who's scattered, flighty and plain annoying at times(Why does she hate her apartment? Her designer E-BAY clothes?  Her all loving, adoring man?) and also, she deals with a script that flounders.  Harry Connick just needs a decent role.  The supporting cast deliver their usual, typical performances.

Whew, so did I enjoy the flick?  I don't know.  I'm not eager to see it again.  I guess I could jump through, and play the scenes I like.  Or not.

My third problem is that I keep imaging a story about a somewhat immature, insecure and opinionated American woman who travels to Ireland and meets a freewheeling Gerard Butler-type and sparks fly, good and bad, but she's not sure what she wants and then a handsome, stud of a Harry Connick-type Amercian shows up and really confuses the whole mess.  And it all plays out to the background of the Emerald Isle and the Big Apple.  Gimmie. Maybe next time?",1211241600,8,3028,4.629699248120301
3256574,3,B000YAA68C,"My Irish wife was in the mood for a romance, and thought we would enjoy this film, but she fell asleep about half way through.

 I managed to watch it all but came away more sad than warmed, as it is a movie more about resolution and loss than about love.  The message in the film is a common one, that you should let those you love in on your secret every day, not expect that they know it.

But that's just me.

Now my wife watched all the way through yesterday with our youngest daughter, and she really liked it after all. But she is a big believer in not getting over your true love (me too, but that's not the way I saw this turn). My bigger problem was the conclusion of the film where it reminded me of when my wife's Ford Expedition was stolen, she wanted another Ford Expedition. After you watch the film you may see what I mean... I felt like the inferred afterward in the story was kind of twisted along the same line.

3256588,5,B000YAA68C,"First, I am AMAZED at the fact that a 21 yr old woman who just graduated college is the source of this amazing film! Not only that, it is a product of her imagination and not a true story which is even more awe inspiring! I adored this movie. I rented this movie without really knowing anything about it- I typically skip through previews or just don't pay attention so I thought this was going to be one of those where I would watch it to the middle and just have to turn it off to do something else. HOW pleasantly surprised I was that not only was I laughing at the many funny situations but the crying- yes, lots of tears because of the despair Holly felt once the love of her life was gone. If you have not seen this film, do not read further b/c I might give away too much info for you. The whole story was amazing- from how they parted to the end when they first met. I guess it has just been too long since I was impressed by a romantic comedy. Holly was a 30 year old widow that was married to her other half for 11 years before he passed away suddenly. But because her husband knew her so well, he took her on an adventure after she thought he was totally gone. PS I LOVE YOU was present throughout the film with each letter he wrote telling her what he had planned for her or for her to just look for a sign. To feel the love of your significant other from beyond was a little creepy at first but then ended up to just have so much unpredictability to it- honestly the whole story was refreshing. I normally think it is silly to buy the book after you have seen the movie first but guess where I am headed next after this review?? That's right, friends! Gonna go make myself cry again! Love it!!

Top it off with miscasting - maybe just me, but Hilary Swank is UGLY and there was ZERO chemistry between her and G. Butler.  And Kathy Bates cast as her mom? - that was just WRONG.  And the sister...first, she couldn't act and second, another complete miscast.  If the movie had a different female lead, different mom, and different sister, a rewritten script with all of the profanity thrown out the window, different camera placement, and some proper scene transitions, then maybe, maybe it would have been OK.  My better half has this aversion to movies that use FLASH CARD TIME PLATES to keep track of time. He says it is a clear sign someone didn't write the script or want to spend money/time to scout and shoot sets properly.(GREAT CONTRAST to show how it CAN BE DONE would be ""Nottinghill""). There seems to be a great deal of mediocrity in films these days. Doesn't anyone know how to make a LOVE STORY without crudeness?",1210896000,6,1065,4.608465608465608
3256591,2,B000YAA68C,"Maybe I'm biased, because I've never read the book. I didn't even know there was a book. But I do love Hilary Swank and I believe she is a wonderful actress. But this movie was horrendous. First of all, the first scene with the fighting was drawn out and predictable. I took that as a sign of how the rest of the movie would be. Yes, I finished watching the rest of movie to give it a chance, but I had to fight the urge to not get up and walk out instead. Even for a 'romantic comedy' the movie is unrealistic.

Yes, I do believe that the length of Holly's grieving time was appropriate, and so was her attitude towards Daniel. But I thought it was silly that Daniel thought he had a chance with her and it'd only been a couple of weeks...? Months? Kathy Bates as the mom sure is harsh for knowing the situation Holly is in. Though..Lisa Kudrow has moments and some great lines.
I just felt some characters and scenes weren't needed, such as putting Daniel through torture of reading a letter to him?! And then what follows after that reading made me cringe not because I didn't agree with it, but because it was just too soon...and weird given the vibe of the letter, and of Holly's newly found self-awareness.
Also, Holly and her escapade with William seemed unrealistic that it'd be somehow connected to Jerry out of all the men in Ireland. Even though this is addressed, it still gave me a gross vibe for some reason. Maybe because I felt like she was just with this man because it reminded her of Jerry.

Gerald Butler completely steals the film and all I kept waiting for was the next time he'd enter the scene. So, if you're looking for some handsome faces, then you've found the right movie. (Hence the two star rating) But besides the eye candy, I couldn't connect with Holly, I empathized with her situation, but I felt no chemistry projecting from the screen or within the actors themselves. I guess it was just missing that 'feel good' vibe that Holly feels when she realizes that can move on. But does she really move on? Or is because Jerry tells her she can?

This film is one of those.  Even the assemble of the superior female cast of actresses like: Hilary Swank, Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon cannot save this movie.  Love between two people is universal and we all love differenly.  But the idea of arranging fun outings for the remaining spouse after the other one is long gone, is spooky if anything else.  Mourning is personal and we deal with it in our own ways and having friends and family involved in some scheduled string of fun outings is just plain weird.  If you are a fan of the romantic comedy there are better ones out there that this one.  You can skip this one and not regret it at all.",1210723200,5,806,4.333333333333333

3256594,3,B000YAA68C,"""P.S. I Love You"" depressed and disappointed me.  It was not the romantic comedy that the trailers and reviews led me to believe; it was too dark and depressing.  Instead, ""P.S. I Love You"" is a romantic drama that chronicles the year-long struggle of Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank of ""Million Dollar Baby"") to overcome the death of her husband Gerry (Gerard Butler of ""300"").

  Holly is constantly complaining and whining that life isn't good enough for her.  Her husband dies of a brain tumor and she's plunged into depression.  Then the letters from Gerry begin arriving.  They urge Holly to continue living her life, pursuing her dreams.  Instead, Holly clings to her dead husband even more.  When the letters finally cease arriving, it is as though he has died again.  All the while I keep hoping she will fall in love with someone, anyone, even the grungy Harry Connick, Jr.  It never happens.  In the last minute of the film, the viewer receives a glimmer of hope that she might have a lasting relationship with a handsome musician living in Ireland.

  Lisa Kudrow of ""Friends"" and Kathy Bates of ""Titanic"" help round out a great cast.  Kudrow's comic relief was depleted too soon into the movie when she found her beau.  Bates' sour faced character was stern and pious; most of the time, she was dishing out motherly advice.  She never approved of Holly's marriage.  Swank and Butler were too muscular for their roles.  It's quite obvious that they spend a lot of time working out at the gym.

  Beautiful New York skylines and Irish farmland and a great soundtrack were not enough to hold my interest.  I found myself getting bored.  ""P.S. I Love You"" dragged on and on.  One-hundred and twenty-seven minutes is too long for a romantic comedy.  When Holly received her last letter, I thought, ""Thank the Lord.  It's finally over.""  But her whining and complaining began anew.  Poor Daniel (Harry Connick, Jr. of ""Independence Day"") was her faithful lapdog throughout the ordeal.  I kept wanting to tell Holly, ""P.S. stop whining and stop complaining.  Get over your husband's death (he wasn't that good looking) and get a life.""",1210636800,5,2137,4.798898071625344

I loved the quirkiness of Lisa Kudrow's character.  As always Gerard Butler is sweet, charming, and oh so good looking.  I was relieved they left out most of his illness, only showing one scene while Jerry was ill.
The music was really wonderful.  Unfortunately, in the CD Gerard's songs were not included.  His rendition of I'll Love You 'Til the End is really touching.
This is most definitely a chick flick, but guys should probably watch it for some romantic tips.
The trip to Ireland was really a nice addition to the film.  The book was placed in Ireland and so the trip was to Spain.  The producers chose to send Holly and her friends to Ireland to include it in the film and it made for a nice touch.
Good film and I'm happy to have purchased it.

I agree with others that with Swank, it's hard for her to be so goofy and funny because she plays such a great serious actress in most of her films, but she delivered this role very well. This movie was a tear jerker, Gerard Butler is hot and great actor, and he does play that perfect man.

It touched me when I realized how hard it is to be a grieving widow but how amazing to have experienced such a great love, and Gerry is her guide...

3256620,3,B000YAA68C,"Answer: Ghost.  (Well, that's one answer, there are others too, like the film Reign Over Me, with Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle doing a male perspective of similar themes.)

P.S. I love you is a film about grief.  Grieving over the loss of a loved one, in this case Hilary Swank plays Holly who we'll see remembering her husband Gerry who has passed away from a brain tumor.  Gerry apparently had time to make plans before his death and those plans revolve around leaving behind letters to Holly providing her instructions on things she must do as she moves on from her loss.

The film opens with a brief glimpse into Holly and Gerry's happy life, though at that point we're watching a lover's quarrel over discussion of their future together.  The little glimpse gives us a bit of insight into the fact that Gerry never seemed to have a plan while Holly was trying to be incredibly organized and work towards goals she had laid out for herself and them as a couple.  Seeing that initial glimpse of their relationship and that status makes Gerry's letters and the planning he has done all the more poignant.

The movie flows fairly quickly over it's just over 2 hour running time and actually does a pretty good job of not dwelling on sadness.  Yes we know that Holly is unhappy about her loss, and yes she has issues adjusting to being alone and without the love of her life, but there isn't the depression and sadness that would drag a viewer down and leave you feeling like you just wanted the movie to end.

Along the way Holly gets instructions to journey to Ireland.  We find out there, as if we didn't know from Gerry's accent in the scenes where he appears, that the couple had met in Ireland back when Holly was a student touring the world a bit as she was trying to determine what she wanted to be in life.  Apparently they fell in love at first sight, and were destined to be together always, or at least until death parted them.

Kathy Bates turns in a decent performance as Holly's mother, and other cast members perform well as Holly's sisters and friends.  The story is good, not great, but good, and the original writing shines through fairly well.  Adapted from a novel and somewhat Americanized (set in New York, rather than in Ireland), we do benefit from several beautiful scenes of the Irish countryside.

Some sexual dialogue and sparing use of language that would cause the film to earn a more adult rating, but no nudity, and little objectionable content for those concerned about such things.

Worth a rental at least.  Some may love the film and feel compelled to buy their own copy.  If you go with a disc-based copy, take a few minutes to check out the extras including a few deleted/extended scenes.  Unfortunately the deleted scenes are without introduction so viewers are left wondering where exactly they fit in the sequence of the film, but most are fairly obvious.  An introduction for each would have been nice, and one scene in particular (at the travel agency) really should have been included in some way.  Perhaps running next to the credits.  Most of the rest (outside of a reunion scene with Gina Gershon's character) are not really noticable, though that scene (with Gershon's character) probably should have made the final cut.",1210550400,6,3269,4.637152777777778

3256623,2,B000YAA68C,"This film is all about having your emotions manipulated.  If you want a good cry, if you want a film to unabashedly try to fill you with very specific emotions, then this is the film for you.  While I will acknowledge that any film is going to try to provoke a response, not many will be as unsubtle and as unapolegetic as this one.  In fact, this is all about the feeling, not at all about the story.  The only point of the story is to make the viewer experience and engage in certain emotions.  If you don't want to go along, then many parts of the film are going to be agonizing.  And you could well believe that this is one of the least artful, most clumsily produced films of recent years.  To be honest, I'm definitely not among the former.  This film simply didn't move me.  All its tactics were too obvious and heavy-handed for me to want to go along.  On the other hand, it wasn't an utter piece of crap either.  If we could give half stars I would give it 2.5.  All in all, I don't regret having seen it, but neither do I feel that it has in any way enriched my life.

I know this was based on a popular book.  I'm an obsessive reader, but quite frankly my reading all goes int other directions.  So I couldn't care less whether it does or does not remain faithful to a book that I will never read.  What are the movie's pluses and minuses?  The minuses first.  As I said above, it really doesn't have much of a story.  Or rather, the story isn't the point.  This is a mush fest.  I just didn't feel the mush.  Most of the film left me cold and disinterested.  The artifice was too obvious, the attempts to manipulate too blatant, the nuances pretty much nonexistent.  In other words, at the very heart of the film there was pretty much nothing.  The whole film struck me as hollow.

The pluses, however, are many.  Even in an age of great film soundtracks, this one stood out.  Over the opening credits they played my favorite song off the great Camera Obscura album LET'S GET OUT OF THE COUNTRY, ""Lloyd, I'm Ready to Be Heartbroken.""  Then at the wake that opened the post-credits they played the great Pogues song from IF I SHOULD FALL FROM GRACE WITH GOD, ""Fairytale of New York.""  And the music stayed interested after that.  OK, the soundtrack is superficial compared with the main story, but suferficialities can keep a film interesting even when it is at core a failure.

Visually the film was eye candy throughout, especially when it got to the scenes in Ireland.  Again, this won't substitute for a good story, but it gives you something to do when the story fails to show up.  I defy anyone not to be impressed by the verdant landscapes show in the scene where Gerry and Holly meet for the first time.

Finally, while the story isn't up to their talents, the film features a strong and interesting cast.  I've always wondered why Hillary Swank hasn't had a more interesting career than she has had.  She's had a couple of Oscar quality roles, but the quality drops off sharply after that.  Perhaps she has been hurt by the fact that in her two biggest films she played a female transsexual trying to pass for male and a boxer.  Hopefully a girlie role like this one will expand the range of roles made available to her.  Gerard Butler plays Gerry.  His career is an interesting one as well.  He's been in a surprising variety of films, but big stardom has eluded him.  He seems poised to make a leap to the A list, especially after the success of 300.  I was delighted to see James Marsters as Gerry's business partner (though it was interesting that later, when Gerry's letter was telling Holly that she needed a job that she could love, but that ""vampire slayer"" was one of them, that in her Slayer poster there were no BUFFY references -- still it was nice to see Marsters in a non-SF or fantasy role).  Kathy Bates, Dean Winters, Lisa Kudrow, Gina Gershon, Harry Connick Jr., and Jeffrey Dean Morgan.

So, the conjunction of a lot of nice surface elements results in a watchable film.  Mind you, a lot of people are going to love this.  They won't object to the emotional manipulation and the cloying sentimentality that is this film's raison d'etre.  I did object, so as a result it had very minimal appeal.  But it did have a little.  And as yet another vampire on BUFFY put it (not James Marster's Spike, but The Master), ""Sometimes a little is enough.""",1210464000,5,4381,4.4002493765586035
3256624,4,B000YAA68C,"Marketing P.S. I LOVE YOU was a hit/miss situation.  The general trailer and the billboards seem to set the audience up for a sappy tearjerker. But happily what happens in this film is not the expected 'widowed person communicating with the dead love out of failure to get on with life' tale, but instead a look into the importance of friendship, family, and adjusting to the incomparable loss. Credit the original novel by Cecelia Ahern as adapted for the screen by Steven Rogers writer/director Richard LaGravenese for making what so easily have been a sappy, maudlin, whining tale into a  touching one of human emotions with a sense of reality mixed with a mildly implausible situation, and a  series of character studies that emphasize the importance of support in the time of grief.

Holly (Hilary Swank) and Gerry (Gerard Butler) Kennedy are a married couple with goals and frustrations and a huge dollop of passionate love, surrounded by friends and family. The tragedy happens just as the movie starts: Gerry has died of a brain tumor leaving the copeless Holly alone with her memories and self-inflicted regrets.  But Gerry, knowing he was a terminal patient, devised his own plan to help Holly through that first year of grief: he left letters in various forms and places, advising Holly how to learn about his family and how to get on with life. Holly's mother (Kathy Bates) owns a bar and has supported her little family since Holly's father deserted his family years ago.  In the bar is another injured soul named Daniel (Harry Connick  Jr.) who fancies Holly but realizes she is far from ready to think about dating. Holly's friends Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon) accompany Holly to Gerry's pre-planned trip to his home in Ireland to meet the in-laws Holly never knew.  While in Ireland Holly reminisces  on the magic of first meeting Gerry, meets Gerry's parents as well as Gerry's best friend William (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and through it all manages to appreciate the gift of PS I Love You letters and reminders Gerry has left for her.  And she ultimately finds closure to her loss.

The cast is strong and makes these at times strained characters into lovable people: Hilary Swank has made a successful entrance into the feminine lead role and is balanced to perfection by Butler, Morgan, Connick, Bates, Kudrow and  Gershon.  They make the implausible plausible and deliver a love story that goes beyond the level of superficial to join the ranks of warm and tender memorable slices of life.  It is surprisingly good!

I have to say, when I saw the preview I thought to myself - I NEVER want to see that movie.  It wasn't until today that on a very rare irrational whim, I decided ""What the hell, I'll just buy it.""  I typically don't like movies with a corny, hallmark card love story, and thought that was what this was going to be.

I was very happily proved wrong.

Although I think they should have chosen someone a bit more soft, vice the slightly mannish Hilary Swank, the movie, to me, was perfection.  Sure there were holes here and there like how she managed to keep the large, New York apartment after not working for the better part of two months, or how the supposed ""best friend"" didn't know who she was until after he slept with her... but you quickly get over it when you realize the true plot line of the story.

Its not about the stages of grief as much as it is about pure, blissful love and that sometimes, no matter what we do, the things we hold most dear to us can be taken in an instant.

I sobbed.  I laughed.  I got that fluttery feeling in my chest.  Truth be told, I definitely sobbed more than the other two, but its what made the story REAL.

I'm not just giving this movie 5 stars because I'm an avid fan of Gerard Butler because he has other movies I'd never rate as high as this one.  There is not much I can say that has not been said already.  The movie is very real.  Hilary's performance really brings the emotion home because she is very sincere.  The scene near the end when she goes running into her mother's bar sobbing, and she says, ""I can't breathe,"" well- by that time I myself had to remember to breathe because when I cry I tend to hold my breath and I had been sobbing for a good few minutes already.  I was lost in her pain and heartache.  I forgot it was only a movie.

I LOVE this movie.  Gerard was wonderful and refreshing.  He mixes passion, romance and silliness is a way that is fun, believable and not over the top.

Sentimental but funny... I have never cried so hard from a movie.  There is something about the chemistry and dynamic between Holly and Jerry that made me sit back and ponder my own relationship.  Not perfect but wonderful in its normalcy.  A few lines from this movie could have come from my life, especially when Jerry during karaoke says something like, ""She's already bitched at me for wanting to go out tonight... 'it's been such a long day at the office, ah...' ""  It is a movie for me to watch often because it makes me realize how much I have to be thankful for- and to cherish what I have.  Sometimes we tend to take for granted the everyday stable yet great people in our lives, and I think for some of us this movie will work as a gentle loving reminder.",1210291200,3,1688,4.244514106583072

The #2 reason - Hilary Swank (2 time Academy Award Winner), who's good in everything.  I figured that if they ""signed on"" then it's got to be a good show.  It was.  I was apprehensive at first in regard to the plot, a dead guy who wrote letters to be sent to his widow after he dies.  I thought it would be lame.  It is such a great show.  Hilary is such a good actress, right away I felt like I was in her shoes, she made you feel like YOU were the widow experiencing the denial, anger, etc.  Gerard no doubt scored major ""chick points"" with his charming performance.  However I don't think he really even had to try too hard as he's very talented.  He got to use his natural accent and real first name for his character.  The ""Gerry"" in the movie wasn't too much of a stretch for Gerard as in real life he seems to be a very unique, energetic/lively, fun-loving guy.  Oh and the bonus was his smile & those eyes.  They will melt you every time.  I doubt there was any woman that didn't completely fall in love with him during his few appearances in the movie.  It was all very believable, nothing was far-fetched.  Thank you Hilary & Gerard for such an emotionally-charged movie; denial, anger, love, comedy, etc.  Absolutely worth watching again & again.  The music is great also.  All I know is that I left the theater crying and thought seriously about life being too short & to make the most of the time we do have!

Holly hardly seems to be the grieving widow as told in the book. She seems happy, upbeat and well healed. *spoiler* SHE HAS A ONE NIGHT STAND! This doesn't happen in the book.

3256681,3,B000YAA68C,"Hilary Swank is sniping at her ne'er do well husband Gerard Butler for taking out a loan behind her back and for telling Kathy Bates, her mother, that she does not want children.  You know why I don't want children yet, Gerry, she screams, it's because I don't want to bring them up in this tiny lower east side apartment, where I would be having to change their diapers on the windowsills because this place is so small there's not even room to turn around.  In this opening scene I lost all faith in the movie, since the apartment they are fighting in is a fantastically large 3,500 square feet place with views on every wall of every room and plus, it's decorated like she's a staging contest winner.  I know it's a convention of the movies that every New York apartment, no matter how opulent and grand, is supposed to be tiny and unfit for humans, but this really takes the cake.  If you're going to make your PLOT TURN on how awful and small a LES apartment is, why don't you show one?  Don't show something that looks like Krystle and Alexis could both live there and never bump into each other for a week.  How idiotic, how far removed from real life.  Basically you'd have to have an income of $750,000 yearly to afford the apartment that most of the action takes place in.  And yet Swank and Butler, appealing actors of course, are supposed to be barely making ends meet.

The script does manage (barely) to explain away why Swank is always dressed in fabulous Marc Jacobs originals.  She buys them on EBAY, she claims, as though that means they would cost only pennies.

I'm sure much of the movie ended up on the cutting room floor.  All of James Marsters' scenes for example, and most of the scenes that inveigled Lisa Kudrow enough to sign on, for the movie we have makes her look to be a one dimensional tease.  She does look exquisite in a Marc Jacobs wedding dress, posed high on a grey carpeted revolving disk in the middle of a bridal salon.

You could sort of see where the movie was going, and that's okay, but there came a time where I longed for one more twist.  Here are a few that I dreamed up.  At the end it would be revealed that Hilary Swank had also died of a brain tumor quite early on, too; or another ending where it was revealed that she had actually been married to Jeffrey Dean Morgan and that Gerard Butler was alive and singing ""Fairytale of New York"" to her in real time.

Who was the actress playing Swank's sister who came from Australia?  Why did they even have her in the movie?

I wanted to make my husband go in for a complete physical after I left the theater out of fear of losing HIM way too soon.  And the man's healthy!

Anyway, I give this movie two huge thumbs up.

I must say that I was pleasently surprised.  Some parts of the film are sad, some parts are funny and other parts are romantic. But to call this film a romantic comedy would be a disservice.  It is more apt to call it a comedy-drama.

Some critics have said that Swank is badly cast.  I would disagree.  In the hands of another actor, the role may have seemed too whimsical and light.  Swank gives Holly a kind of grounding. The performances from the supporting cast were also first-rate.

There are some weaknesses with the storyline.  I thought that the character of Holly relied a little too heavily on ""fate"" and on receiving ""signs"". I also thought that it was a little inconsistant that a couple who were supposed to be struggling financially could afford a trip to Ireland.  But to dismiss the film entirely because of these points would be just nit picking.  This film may not change your life but there are worse ways of spending a few hours.",1203811200,5,1200,4.525581395348837

3256710,5,B000YAA68C,"After seeing ""P.S. I Love You""...it is now my all time favorite romantic comedy. Probably replacing ""Notting Hill"". Any movie that makes me laugh and cry at the same time is a winner! The opening argument scene was so well written. It was very realistic(my husband and I have argued just like that)plus it introduced the characters history and chemistry etc. Very effective opening scene. I was not a Hillary Swank fan, but she won me over. Her performance is wonderful....I believed she was Holly and Gerard Butler WAS Gerry. Every role I see him in is spot on. I wonder when he will get the accolades he deserves. Everyone else in the cast was excellent. I will agree that some roles seemed to be cut down to almost nothing...James Marsten and the actress who played Hillary's sister, and Gina Gershon.

This movie had some atypical twists and turns and I loved that. I also would enjoy seeing the movie a second time. Because some scenes were flashbacks or out of sequence, you could enjoy some scenes early in the movie now knowing what will be coming up in the future...if that makes sense. (An example: Holly must clean out her deceased husband's closet...pack up his clothes. She keeps his leather jacket though. Later in the movie you flashback years before to the scene where Gerry and Holly first meet and discover that Gerry gives her his leather jacket when she's cold. Seeing the movie a second time, I would look at the scene of Holly packing clothes and holding on to his leather jacket differently now knowing the history behind it.)

If you want a romantic comedy formula movie, this isn't exactly it...this movie has layers and really makes you think while it entertains. I also did not think it dragged for even a moment.

One extra recommendation...buy or rent ""Dear Frankie"" with Gerard Butler. Another movie that is a true work of art!",1202342400,6,1857,4.707692307692308

On the other hand, if you are a chick who loves her chick flicks, you'd be hard pressed to find a better one. Grab a friend, grab a hanky, and go see this movie!

Hillary Swank does a fabulous job portraying the emotional rollercoaster that our heroine goes through. In fact, there is not a weak link in the bunch. Harry Connick, Jr., Kathy Bates, Gerard Butler, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Lisa Kudrow--they are all at the top of their game and an absolute pleasure to watch.

And one final plug for the soundtrack. It's full of wonderful and unexpected treasures that were unearthed specifically for this film. Stop by the record shop on the way home from the theater and pick one up. It makes a perfect movie souvenir!",1201046400,7,910,4.4431137724550895
3256712,2,B000YAA68C,"Grief can be a painfully long process, but does that mean a movie needs to capture that experience in real time? Actually a year elapses in this marathon 126-minute film, but director Richard LaGravenese's episodic treatment is so sluggish that the end didn't come soon enough for me. This is the first of several problems with this 2007 romantic dramedy co-written by LaGravenese and Steven Rogers and actually not the biggest. That dubious distinction belongs to star Hilary Swank as Holly Kennedy, a high-strung Manhattan real estate agent closing in on thirty and married nearly a decade to Gerry, a hunky, free-wheeling Irish musician. Physically angular with a performance pitched between severely pinched and gawkily awkward, Swank lacks the innate malleability to carry off the role. It's the type that Meg Ryan or Sandra Bullock can do in their sleep, but obviously the torch has to be passed. Despite moments of genuine likeability and vulnerability, Swank lets it drop.

The movie opens with a lengthy and extremely contrived marital squabble between Holly and Gerry and then wastes no time in flashing forward months later to Gerry's wake at the Irish bar that Holly's mother runs. Throughout the rest of the movie, Holly grieves by having frequent flashbacks to the happier days with Gerry, that is, when she is not fantasizing about Gerry still being alive. The plot turns on the conceit that he wrote a series of letters before his death that he intends to be delivered to Holly at key moments during her first year without him, and Holly's responses to the letters make up what constitutes the impetus of the storyline. There are some poorly developed turns, but there are some good moments primarily courtesy of an unusually stellar supporting cast starting with Kathy Bates as Holly's straight-shooting mother whose own husband left her in a less tragic manner; Gina Gershon as Sharon, one of Holly's best friends; and Lisa Kudrow as her other friend, the more hedonistic Denise. In fact, Kudrow's crack comedy timing is such a contrast to Swank's tentative, redundant manner that it upsets the balance of the film.

The men fare somewhat better. A genuinely charismatic actor, Gerard Butler plays Gerry with such unfettered joy that it really is a wonder why he is attracted to Holly in the first place. Their ""cute"" first encounter on an isolated Irish road is painful to watch not because of Gerry's impending doom but because Swank overdoes her impersonation of a nave college student. As potential paramour Billy, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, an American actor who actually does a better Irish accent than Butler (a Scotsman) lends the necessary smoldering presence, but he is painted too ideally to be that compelling. Harry Connick, Jr., on the other hand, plays a genuinely idiosyncratic suitor, Daniel, a somewhat off-kilter bartender who may have Asperger's Syndrome. It's an oddly discomforting ploy, but at least it's different, and Connick shows he still has a good comedy sense. Rural Ireland certainly looks idyllic thanks to Terry Stacey's cinematography, although I have to say the musical soundtrack comes across as too predictably coy to help complement scenes. I recommend skipping this one for more worthwhile treatments on grieving like Anthony Minghella's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Truly-Madly-Deeply/dp/B00005R5GK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Truly Madly Deeply</a>&nbsp;or even Jerry Zucker's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost/dp/B000LE16VW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost</a>.",1200960000,17,3607,5.58029197080292

But I thought maybe if they improved on it and made it more about...picking yourself back up then the book did that I would enjoy it more. I was right thankfully! I'll also say that I'm a big fan of movies like the notebook and a walk to remember, and this seemed to fall into the same caliber of movie for me.
  It really got you to understand the main characters' relationship and also kept the main elements of the book in my opinion. I usually don't really like Hilary Swank but she was charming and engaging(though, really shouldn't sing along with Judy Garland, that was painful). My only complaint was that I cried so much it gave me a headache, though, it would redeem itself by giving you a good laugh immediately following a really sad part. So I deducted just one star because by the end, I was mentally BEGGING them not to go thru another letter, I didn't think my poor tear ducts could handle it. I would also say, though I considered dragging my boyfriend(who apparently had no clue about the premise to begin with and would have been going in blindly!) it was much better to go with my best friend who had also read the book(though she said I cried too much). Its a chick flick in my opinion, though I have heard other guys didn't mind it. =) I would happily recommend it as a really fun movie that I absolutely loved.

3256715,5,B000YAA68C,"I had actually been dragging my feet because the movie itself was not an exact copy of the book which was wonderful.  However, that said, did it matter????  No, to me, in the end, not one bit.  I laughed, sighed and cried throughout the entire movie.  It blew me away.  I cannot wait to own this gem.  there was only one man in our theater.  The rest were Gerry Butler fans (yes, I can spot them a mile away) and teenage girls, who did their own share of crying and hugging after the movie.  This movie hits home on many different levels.  It is not just about the death of a beloved spouse, it is about the uncertainty of life and how to go on living when things do not go as you planned, how to forgive yourself if you didn't get around to doing certain things (having children).  It shows us that though marriage never goes as you planned it (or fantasized it would), that it is your life and you are in the middle of it. It's about loving yourself and your spouse during those not so perfect times.  In the end, the most important thing is how to find yourself and keep the faith after the worst possible thing has happened.  Love, anger, fear, loss, and abandoment- it is all there.

Everyone was great.  Gerry brought so much energy and soul to his role!  He is so damn handsome and sexy!!  Oh, and to hear him sing again was an extra added bonus!  Hilary was terrific and very believable- she did great playing against type.  I really wasn't sure before the movie if I would warm to Harry Connick's character, but his off-beat Daniel was very likable and cute.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan was great, too.  His roles is small but important.  He was very charming and has a very cute arse!!!!

3256738,4,B000YAA68C,"The story begins with a fight. Holly (Swank) is running up a seemingly endless  flight of stairs with Gerry (Butler) in hot pursuit.  He's apologizing, but like a typical male, he's really not quite sure what he did wrong--he just wants to make up and not sleep in the bathtub.

Nine years' marriage and they don't have a lot to show--no kids, no careers, and only a five flight walkup.  But, it's obvious that Holly and Gerry love each other very much.

The next scene is Gerry's wake.  It's a bittersweet affair--and I confess to laughing when I heard the ironic ""Fairytale of New York"" (Gerry's favorite song) played and sung to by his priest.

A few weeks' later, the letters begin.  While the film only shows Gerry's life and Holly's impressions of his 'ghost', we realize he'd understood his cancer would take him and planned to help Holly get through it past the grave.  His letters encourage her to get out, sing Karaoke, even go to Ireland.  Those missives literally help her find her dreams and go on with her life.

""PS I love you"" is what I expected--and more. The cast, scenery, and especially the music all fit well together to elicit tears--and yes, occasional laughter.

Gerard Butler is fabulous as always.  He's one of the best new actors around and I hope to see him for many years to come. I didn't expect that he could sing--and he does an excellent job on ""Galway Girls.""

In my opinion, Hillary Swank is the best part of the film.  She's not your typical Hollywood ingenue.  She's sometimes awkward, she doesn't always look perfect, and yet her ability to convey emotions from the highs to the lows very impressive.  When she comes home from the funeral alone, picks up her cell phone and just keeps calling her home phone to hear Gerry's voice over and over on the answering machine literally brought me to tears.

Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the big teddy bear Billy Gallagher was also great.  You've seen him before if you watched ""Grey's Anatomy"" playing Denny Duquette. I'm very glad to see him getting silver screen roles. If you like him, look for him in 2008 in ""The Accidental Husband.""

Only one warning--take some tissues with you. This film will make you cry--and occasionally laugh so hard you'll have tears in your eyes, too.",1199491200,155,2257,4.63727959697733

They urge her on to do stuff she normally wouldn't do - like attempt karaoke again after a disastrous past try; go on a trip with the girls; and he even encourages her to not close herself off, but to open herself up to the possiblility of falling in love again.

Lacking a simple thing as chemistry between the two lead characters (or the potential new love interests for that matter), the movie version of ""PS I Love You"" falls flat and never really takes off. From the first ten minutes - one of their many arguments designed to show what a ""real"" couple they are - to the cheesy flashbacks to highlight their initial meeting. It just made me wonder how the heck they got together. And Swank's attempts at displaying her grief in a prolonged arc just didn't work - it was too contrived and unbelievable. She was channeling Diane Keaton in her annoyingly infamous crying scene in ""Something's Gotta Give."" I could not be more disappointed in the movie. I was expecting a romantic comedy-drama in the vein of ""Ghost,"" but instead it was just a mediocre story. The only time I shed a tear was when she kept calling his phone just to hear his voice - it seemed really natural, unlike the majority of her performance. Other stand outs were Kathy Bates as her mother and Lisa Kudrow providing comic relief. James Marsden (Spike from ""Buffy"") as Gerry's best friend is completely unrecognizable in a very understated performance.

3256741,4,B000YAA68C,"So here is the thing. I don't watch many regular television programs so
have never seen some of the supporting cast and their trademark 'acts.'
I have never read the novel, P.S, I Love You. Or any other Ahern
writings. Never have seen any of the actors except Hilary Swank, Gerard
Butler and Kathy Bates. I don't know anything about walk-up apartments
in New York. (Seemed to bug some people.) I'm not an 'expert' on Irish
accents.

I caught the film for the second time 12/30 at the 10:35 a.m. showing;
there was an amazing crowd for a Sunday morning. The projection was
perfect. No microphones (complaints on some boards) on view. The sound
was great. That end song over the credits is a winner! And I loved it
more that I did the first time on the opening Friday morn, the 21st.

Holly is a real person, imperfect and annoying at times. Hilary Swank
is perfect. Those who want a 'babyface"" child/woman to play Holly are
not living in the real world. There are more look-a-likes for Hilary
than the usual cookie-cutter cute young things Hollywood usually casts.
And Hilary has the chops to make us understand this childish woman and
how she starts the healing and growing up, with her Gerry's memory to
help.

I loved Lisa Kudrows questions to potentials. Very funny. I loved
Holly's quirky sister and thought she brought energy and sunshine to
her scenes. The boat scene is clich' but funny all the same.

I still say the ballpark scene was not needed. They could have cut it
and the expense, and had the reading of the letter as voice-over.
Daniel and Holly 'were over' in the restaurant, and the audience knows
it. Daniel is an interesting ""other man"" and a new type. More
interesting than usual. But did anyone really think they would end up
together? Not me.

Bates is always good, but I just don't see that her part is 'wonderful'
as others keep saying. It's a part Bates can do in her sleep. The
Mother had never reconciled to the marriage and seemed waspish. Holly
had to overlook her disapproval while trying to find her way with her
husband.

I wonder how many scenes with James Marstars and Gina Gershon were left
on the cutting room floor. They were hardly in the film.

And Jeffrey Dean Morgan, although good looking in a grinny-goofy way,
hardly has any lines to say. And they are one-note. So not a great
impression.

The cinematography is gorgeous, from the streets of New York to the
Irish countryside.

Our audience today clapped when the 'Mustang Sally"" scene started. More
energy and excitement there than in all the rest of the film. Gerry
Butler is Mr. Wonderful. Singing, flirting, great body language, and a
delicious deep kiss, at last. *sigh* I've upgraded my rating to a 9
from a 7.

Postcript: I didn't read this book and I have promised myself that I
will never buy a book thinking I will see it on film. Never happens. I
have promised myself I will not see every preview and teaser of a film
before I go to the theater.

The previews of PSILY were clips chopped up from 5 to 10 seconds and
did not show what the scenes they were from were about. I went thinking
I was seeing quite a different film, just from all the clips we were
able to see online and on TV. My first viewing was clouded by that
fact. I did not see what the preview seemed to say I should be seeing.

From now on I will go in like I did for ""Phantom Of The Opera"" -
knowing nothing, never having seen a preview. But I knew I loved the
music.

Or last years ""The Departed."" I had never even heard of it and went
because I wanted to see the ""300"" preview on a big screen. But I loved
it.

This has taught me a lesson. I've seen one preview of ""Nims Island"" -
the next Butler film, out in April, and love what I see. Don't want to
read the book. I'll not be watching or reading about the film. Don't

I usually love films like this. I had seen the trailer enough times, and especially liking Gerard Butler (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Phantom-of-the-Opera-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0007TKNL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Phantom of the Opera (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000QXDED6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300 (Widescreen Edition)</a>) I was primed for an entertaining and heart touching film. Well,it did not work for me,not because of the story itself or the acting,but Good God this film needed some editing!!!!!!!!!! This film moved like my Grandmother used to say,like ""Molasses creeping up hill on a cold January day!"" For all of it's good intentions ""P.S. I Love You"" just droned like a wheezing bagpipe!

3256743,2,B000YAA68C,"There's nothing like a good confection to go along with the holidays.  And there's nothing more that I'd like to do than enjoy a film like `P.S. I Love You'.  The previews show everything inviting:  A widow woman on the mend, a mystery with chain letters sent posthumously, the comic return of Lisa Kudrow, a heart-warming story about learning to live and love again after a loved one's death.  There's even a performance by Kathy Bates.

The movie starts with a likable premise:  Gerry (Gerard Butler), a fun-loving pub singer and Irish immigrant dies of brain cancer and leaves his wife, Holly (Hillary Swank) to grieve immobile in her Brooklyn apartment.  Sounds good so far.  I came into the story thinking I might get the female flick (or male sensitive movie) version of `The Ultimate Gift'.  There were some problems with that movie, but the aspect of mystery with a heart is a real draw.

Holly mourns for weeks, letting her apartment go.  Her mother (Bates) and her best friend (Kudrow) try to snap her out of it.  On her thirtieth birthday, balloons and a cake are delivered, complete with a tape recorder with Gerry's voice intact, telling her she's to follow the instructions from a series of letters meant to ease her grieving and move on in life.

At Irish Teddy's Bar where he used to sing, bartender, Daniel (Harry Connick, Jr.) is the kind of jerk women love to hate, but tries to make a move while Holly's on the mend.  She goes out on the town and takes a trip to Ireland and connects with Gerry's family, but the film mostly falters.  The trouble is time is needed for these wounds, and the movie almost makes the four seasons of her grieving in real time.

Unfortunately the movie didn't live up to the previews.  Here's why:  If the film were nearly as well edited as the trailor, it would flown better.  There's one speed they know best and that's slow.  Sometimes it's essential; at others it's deadly.  The material is drawn out; it's spotty for mirth and warmth.  There's a joke here, a letdown there.  The movie lingers over every development.  The flashbacks don't help the film much, either.  The delivery mainly feels forced.

Swank gives a heartfelt performance that clearly identifies our sympathies for her plight, and Bates is as believable as ever as the hard-boiled mother, who underneath her exterior shines a true and loving heart.  Lisa Kudrow still has a likable return, even if the movie's timing gives her short shrift.  In comparison to his role in 'Bug,' Harry Connick, Jr. shows a real acting range.  Similarly, Gerard Butler shows his repertoire from feisty sword and sandal king in '300' to a likable character, worthy of grieving about.

Despite good performances and a good premise, 'P.S. I Love You' fails to connect with the audience.  Unlike movies such as 'The Notebook,' and `Ghost' it fails to deliver the emotional depth one would expect from the subject matter with a script and direction that need to be lively at the times the characters and audience need it most.",1198627200,18,3023,4.722753346080306
3256744,4,B000YAA68C,"As hopelessly contrived and predictable as ""P.S. I Love You"" is, it's still a charming, touching romantic comedy. The most surprising thing about it is Hilary Swank, whose resume of serious films has made a humorous role seem an unlikely choice. She makes full use of her softer, sillier side, playing a character that's loveable and irritating at the same time. I say this in spite of the fact that serious undertones run through the film, as they always do in romantic comedies; after losing her husband to cancer, Swank's character spends the rest of the film trying to find herself (for lack of a non-clichd term). The twist is that her husband is posthumously guiding her with a series of handwritten letters, all of which were so strategically located that only a well-executed plan could see it through. A sweet but nonetheless baffling idea: How could a terminally ill man carry off something this elaborate in such a short period of time?

Never mind--I was still moved by the light-hearted sentimentality of the story, so I have to give credit where credit is due. The film opens in wintertime New York City with Holly Kennedy (Swank) storming home, absolutely furious. Right behind her is her Irish husband, Jerry (Gerard Butler), who knows he's said something to offend Holly but doesn't know what. It isn't until they enter their apartment that they really let loose: Holly is offended because Jerry commented on her waiting to have children. Now back in their apartment, everything he says gets misconstrued in some way, and a full-blown fight ensues. It isn't long before they make up, however, and by the time they do, Jerry promises his wife that he isn't going anywhere, despite their financial troubles, despite their current job situations. After nine years, he still loves her. He'll always love her, no matter what.

Naturally, the very next scene takes place at his memorial service. The audience is thankfully spared the unnecessary melodrama of his failing health and eventual death; no such scenes are included in this film. The filmmakers wisely chose to focus on what happens afterwards with Holly, who--as you might have guessed--is so grief-stricken that she shuts herself off and lets herself go. It isn't until her thirtieth birthday that things begin to change; as her worried family and friends sit by her side, a birthday cake is delivered with a mini cassette recorder taped to the inside of the box. Holly presses the Play button and hears Jerry's voice explaining that he wrote her a series of letters as he was dying. Holly will receive them all over a period of time, and each one will instruct her to do something bold and adventurous. Basically, his words will push her into living her life without focusing so much on his death.

The rest of the film is all about Holly fulfilling her husband's last requests, from singing in a karaoke bar to meeting his parents back in his native Ireland (where--you guessed it--another letter waits). Her friends and family offer as much support as they can, all while engaged in their own minor subplots. Her best friend, Denise (Lisa Kudrow), is desperate to find Mr. Right, so desperate that she openly asks potential dates about their relationship status, their financial status, and their sexual orientation. Holly's mother, Patricia (Kathy Bates), loves her daughter but has trouble accepting Jerry's postmortem plan. She was never fully accepting of him to begin with; he and Holly married at young ages, meaning that a lot could have gone wrong. And Patricia definitely understands the pain of losing a husband (albeit under much different circumstances).

The most interesting side character is Daniel (Harry Connick, Jr.), who works for Holly's mother at a local bar. He claims to have a syndrome: his social filter is defective, meaning he'll say anything to anyone at anytime. He openly tells Holly that she's hot, that she's a terrible singer, and that he's getting sick of hearing about Jerry all the time. Part of the truth is obvious--he has feelings for Holly. The rest of the truth is not so clear-cut--he, too, has been deeply wounded by a past relationship. From this alone, the two are emotional matches. That doesn't necessarily mean that they would work as a couple, especially with the inclusion of William (Jeffery Dean Morgan), the man Holly meets on her trip to Ireland. So the question is raised: Will Holly and Daniel find romance in the midst of tragedy? Will Holly allow herself to love again, or even to let her life go in a new direction?

As fresh and exciting as I'm making this sound, the reality is that ""P.S. I Love You"" is a fairly routine story of love, loss, and emotional rebirth. That doesn't make it a bad movie by any means; in all honesty, I found it quite satisfying. Most of this has to do with Hilary Swank, who impressed me with her ability to transcend the heavy-handed, solemn movie roles she's known for. But the rest of the cast does a decent job, as well, doing justice to a well-established cinematic formula. I also appreciated the letter-writing plot point, simply because it was cleverly (if strangely) executed. Some may feel that Jerry's letter writing is a method of control, but do you honestly think that a romantic comedy would go that far? It's not control so much as it's a way to nudge Holly in the right direction--I believe that, were it not for his letters, she would mourn the rest of her life. And is it any coincidence that he ends every letter with the film's title?",1198454400,36,5520,4.818565400843882
3256745,4,B000YAA68C,"""PS I Love You"" is a delightful film about a young widow and how her husband, knowing he was dying, left her a legacy of letters designed to encourage her into living again after his death.  Hilary Swank delivers a high-energy performance opposite the always sexy Gerard Butler.  Lisa Kudrow is a hoot as Hilary's friend.  Gina Gershon, James Marsters (Spike from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer fame), Harry Connick, Jr., and Kathy Bates round out the cast.  The locations are rich and beautiful!  Even the apartment where Hilary lives and the pub her mother owns are almost characters, themselves.  This film made me laugh - the priest singing at the Irish wake was particularly amusing.  It made me cry - too many times to name.  It made me laugh while I was crying.  It is a lovely movie filled with lots of surprises!",1198108800,13,816,4.65034965034965
