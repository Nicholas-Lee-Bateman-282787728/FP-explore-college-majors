3665718,5,B000PITGHK,This is the perfect video if you are overweight and worried about your health. There are no super skinny half naked women to make you feel self conscious. And no talking! Just relaxing music with a chime to tell you its time for the next position.,1369094400,4,247,4.391304347826087
3665719,2,B000PITGHK,Not very good video. Not appealing at all and no instructions. Not worth the money spent.,1457308800,,89,4.625

3665721,1,B000PITGHK,If you are overweight this might be possible but if you are truly obese there is no way you can do this. Do NOT buy if you are genuinely obese. I was so disappointed. I would have to pull my joints loose!,1455840000,,204,3.880952380952381

3665725,2,B000PITGHK,"This is for Extreamely Advanced YOGA the video starts with skinny man pulling legs extreme indian syle, next he LEANing to side with hands flat on ground. A.k. A not "" for obesity and Weight loss"".  The music is nice to just do basic streches and not follow the non-naritive - music video.",1443484800,,289,4.452830188679245
3665726,5,B000PITGHK,Not an instructional video but a very nice one to practice with once you know how to get into the poses. Start with Yoga: Asanas by the same director for detailed instructions and information about the poses.,1440288000,2,208,4.648648648648648
3665727,4,B000PITGHK,"Like some of the other reviewers have said, you kind of have to by gumby for some of these poses.  But I modify and move on.  I find it VERY relaxing not to have someone talking through the movements.  You can get in your pose and just relax without having to listen to someone tell you how and when to breathe.",1429142400,,311,4.065573770491803
3665728,3,B000PITGHK,"I struggled with whether or not I liked this video.  I do think that this requires a moderate level of experience in yoga to be able to follow the series.  I'm no skinny yoga girl, but I've been practicing for well over a year and I found this challenging and pleasant.  I am not a pretzel, nor am I capable of everything in this video, but I found it a nice break from some of the other instructional videos I've worked out to.  The chime (which reminds me way too much of Tinkerbell on old Disney stories on records) is a nice way to take you out of a meditative state in one position before moving on.  That being said, I don't know exactly how this is for Obesity and Weight Loss.  It just seemed to be a good medium level yoga practice series...and one I'll likely put in my rotation of videos to work out with.",1428364800,,816,4.165605095541402
3665729,1,B000PITGHK,Not what I expected,1425081600,,19,4.0
3665730,3,B000PITGHK,"I've practiced yoga for 15 years, off and on.  I know how to perform most poses relatively accurately, and am blessed with natural flexibility.  I gained weight and lost considerable strength during a long illness, and have been slowly working on improving both. I rely on videos like this for daily practice, so I've watched quite a few.
I agree with the comments about how these are not introductory poses.  I would not recommend this particular title for beginners.
There are two models, but the makers of this title did not employ them to show alternate poses.  Instead, they simply alternate.  Or sometimes both do exactly the same position.
I liked the pace, I like the bell.  The lack of patter is nice, but that's only because I know exactly how to do each position.  I already know how to modify positions for my own body, but it was nice to see it modeled properly. I found the poses challenging, but not overly so, with a couple of exceptions.
The last two inversion poses I would not recommend for an overweight individual.  One, even with my long experience, with the extra belly weight I now carry, I could not get my legs even near the proper position without risking injury. Two, I can't fold myself over.  I couldn't do this position back when I was only a few pounds overweight.  I can't think that the makers of this video tested any of the advanced positions with an individual who was overweight.  Unless this is meant to prevent obesity, I think the title is wildly misleading.

I give this three stars, because I'll probably put it in my rotation and just skip the inversions. If the makers of this title want to improve things, they should first make sure the position is physically possible for an overweight person before including it, and second, show two models, one doing an advanced pose, one doing an intermediate pose.",1423699200,,1850,4.658461538461538
3665731,5,B000PITGHK,"It's not easy & if you're looking for a beginner's yoga workout this definitely is NOT IT.  It is just like a real focused yoga class, complete with meditation, chimes for when to change positions or come out of them & the names of the poses.  I had to do some modifications, but now I have a video I can use to challenge myself.  I am a former ballerina & have found basically all of the yoga videos to be too easy for me.  This was a nice change of pace.  Reminded me of the yoga classes I did over the summer in Hawaii.",1420502400,,522,3.980769230769231
3665732,5,B000PITGHK,"I really liked this video. No talking, a bell to let you know when to switch position. However, I think they pause recording while the ""teachers"" are holding the pose because they DO NOT MOVE. But still this was great for a simple straightforward yoga video.",1407196800,,258,4.630434782608695
3665733,1,B000PITGHK,Are you kidding me?  This must be for skinny obese people who can contort their bodies into these positions.  I thought it would be modified for an overweight body.  Nope.  No modifications shown at all.  I can yoga that is targeted for fit bodies better than I can do this.,1405382400,,274,4.4
3665734,4,B000PITGHK,Good yoga video,1404864000,,15,4.333333333333333
3665735,5,B000PITGHK,"This is so far my favorite yoga series ever. In fact, over the last 15 years, this is the ONLY video series I've ever enjoyed (and I just found it in April 2014).
Here are things to keep in mind:
1. If you are a beginner or need lots of modifications, please-pleas-please go to a class where you get expert help learning poses. You should never EVER do any exercise video without knowing basics. The probability of injury is quite high.
2. This series holds poses for extended periods of time. While this is plenty of appropriate exercise, it is not the POPULAR image of yoga that has arisen in the last 10 years or so.
3. The practice is quiet with a digital chime moving the practice forward. Personally, I despise someone yapping while I am trying to find my center; but I am also familiar with the poses and know how far I can go into them. If you need someone talking, this is NOT for you.
4. Meditation is a big part of this series. If you are already familiar with Yogic philosophy *of India*, you may find this very refreshing.
To summarize:
If you want to shred, find something else.
If you want someone talking, find something else.
If you want someone to abuse you, find something else.
If you are new to yoga, please find a class first. It's not about fat or skinny. I'm large and don't need modifications. You absolutely must learn correct form and purpose or you will, eventually, get an injury.",1397606400,20,1409,4.423076923076923
3665736,5,B000PITGHK,"This is a video of yoga poses.  You'll hold each pose for 1 minute.  This video is good for building strength and flexibility which will result in weight loss.  This is not a 'typical' yoga video.  By that I mean there is no talking, you go into a pose, hold it and come back to stand position then go into your next pose.  You'll know when it is time to release because you will hear the chime.

The music lends itself to meditation which is what yoga is about; flexibility, strength and meditation.  There are no serene backgrounds, no frills and no talking.  I really like that there is no talking because I can focus on the pose and relaxing into it.  If you don't know the pose, watch the person perform it and then do it.  Only do as much of the pose as you are able to comfortably.  Don't force and don't risk injury.  Its not a competition.  Its about building strength and flexibility.  Go at your own pace.",1394928000,6,916,4.280701754385965
3665737,2,B000PITGHK,I am an overweight person and these are very advanced positions. They don't show any options for modifications at all. You can modify some of them but others would be hard to know how to modify them without doing them all together. I won't be watching this again.,1393718400,14,263,4.5
3665738,1,B000PITGHK,"This is no instruction and for someone new to yoga, they will severely injure themselves. This is the worst instructional video I ever viewed.",1393372800,4,142,4.958333333333333
3665739,4,B000PITGHK,"This is not an instructional video.  It's a yoga practice video.  I learned the correct position, breath, and therapeutic value from Yoga: Mind Body Connection but I couldn't use that video to practice yoga. There was too much talking.  I also had a hard time counting the second/minutes in each pose. This  video has chimes when it's time to advance to the next pose and the poses are said to aid the body's weightloss mechanisms (i.e., organs) which is explained in detail Yoga: Mind Body Connection. If you were lost here start try that one.",1393200000,24,544,4.6947368421052635

3665741,2,B000PITGHK,"This is really not for beginners... like myself... I figured because I'm overweight, these yoga poses would be easy to figure out because it's supposed to be tailored for fat people... but halfway through the video I started getting terribly knee pains, probably because I was doing the poses wrong and this is the first time I've ever really seriously tried yoga. Don't make the same mistake I did! Hopefully I didn't cause any permanent damage... moving on to a more instructional video.",1379548800,,489,4.903614457831325
3665742,3,B000PITGHK,"I was looking for something new in my yoga practice.  This DVD is definitely different from others I have tried. The pace is very slow but you hold every pose for a long time, which is extremely difficult, especially some of the ab ones.  It is not fancy or flashy, and I was really sore after my first attempt.  I tried it again the next day, and it was a little easier.  But don't let the title fool you.  It is NOT an easy DVD for people who are overweight. Definitely more the intermediate/advanced practice.",1379116800,12,512,4.347368421052631
3665743,1,B000PITGHK,Very poorly designed yoga video. I had to cut it off after about 5-10 minutes it was so bad. Do not recommend.,1376092800,3,110,4.045454545454546
3665744,1,B000PITGHK,"We gave it 10 minutes hoping it would get better, but it didn't.  The only way we could see it would work is if you're already proficient at yoga and want to stave off obesity.  If you're already obese and/or not proficient you'll just get demoralized trying to imitate experts with no instruction.",1375574400,31,298,4.60377358490566

3665746,1,B000PITGHK,"I had high hopes from this video, but should have read the reviews first. No modifications, some of the poses were difficult if you aren't skinny and to be honest, would skinny people do a workout for weight loss and obesity? Disappointed and misleading.",1374883200,5,254,4.795454545454546
3665747,1,B000PITGHK,This is an advanced yoga work out. You need to be an expert with poses and flexible like gumby to get through it. There are no explanations on how to do the poses just a weird video with chimes telling you when to change poses. I only picked it because it was free. I will not be rewatching this one.,1371340800,49,300,4.016666666666667

8315033,4,B000PITGHK,"First, as others have noted this is NOT an instructional video.  You need to know how to do the poses beforehand.  (This series does have an explanatory, instructional video.  Definitely watch that first and learn the poses.). Keeping that in mind, I really like this video because there are no words.  Just soothing music and chimes telling you when to change poses.  With most videos I find the verbal instructions to be distracting after the first time I watch them.  Not a problem here.  You can do this practice video over and over and not get tired of it.  Subtract one star, however, as the title is misleading.  You need to be in pretty great shape already to actually do these poses in my opinion.  Someday...",1474156800,,718,4.626984126984127
8315034,3,B000PITGHK,I like it because nobody is jabering. A bell tells you when to change positions. The only thing is some positions I'm not sure where your weight should be distributed.,1470700800,,167,4.6
8315035,1,B000PITGHK,This video is not suited for overweight people.  You have your typical skinny person doing all the moves and absolutely no modification.  You need to change the title.,1469750400,,167,4.928571428571429

8315038,5,B000PITGHK,"If you have been practicing Yoga and now want to improve and master the poses, this is the video for you. I can see myself using this video to practice everyday because the yoga practitioner actually holds the yoga pose for a good minute and there are cues to get out of the pose. The background music is gently and soothing.

This is not a beginners yoga video so if you're looking to get familiar with yoga and get started, you should look somewhere else.",1468627200,,457,4.376470588235295
