8027967,4,B0002H7APY,"Three best friends are wandering the streets of Moscow thinking how they can get rich. They love Tarantino's movies and they are inspired by Jackie Chan. Suddenly, a chance meeting allows them to snatch a lot of cash from a group of mafia men. Crime is tough, but they say newbies are lucky.

It is good movie. The script is very witty and interesting. Unfortunately, young actors lack the seriousness (although this is a comedy) and the professionalism that the older actors possess and this makes film only a four-star winner.

Andrei Panin, a great old-school Russian actor, plays one of the Mafia men. The film also features Dolphin, a hip hop/rap/alternative musician. He plays a drugged scientist who believe the world is the Matrix (yes, the Neo and Morpheus' Matrix).

I would recommend the film - it is really fun to watch a couple of times, but I would not recommend the sequel.",1137974400,,888,4.753246753246753
