313913,5,630120879X,"I thought this movie was good! I've seen it about 3 times....but only once all the way through. Honestly....I don't know how people can dislike it. If you didn't think the movie itself was good,you at least had to like the scenes with Marquis de Sade in them. Not only is he one of the villians that actually are interesting, the acting is really good. He's one of the reasons that I liked the movie. That and I've known him in a past life......but that's a different story all together.",997315200,,487,4.4222222222222225
313914,4,630120879X,"First off, if you don't like horror movies, or just 80's movies in general, you're not going to like this one at all.  But if you do, you MUST see this, becuase it is essential to any horror buff's collection.  The plot centers around an Anytown,USA type place that suddenly has a local Waxwork mueseum.  While walking to school Deborah Foreman and Michelle Johnson are invited to a private showing of the waxwork by the owner himself.  Thus, the girls invite Zach Galligan and a few other friends from college to come along.  It turns out that the waxwork specializes in murder scenes, and if you get close enough to an exhibit, you will be transformed into its world.  That is how Dana Ashbrook meets and becomes a wolfman,and how Michelle Johnson gets a kiss from Dracula.  Other classic villains shown; Marquis De Sade, the Mummy, and some zombies a la Night of the Living Dead.  It is up to Zach Galligan to unearth some secrets about his family that will help him destroy the Waxwork and its evil owner.  My favorite aspects of this movie:  the fact that it is made in the 80's, giving it an automatic layer of cheese...Deborah Foreman's performance, as the stereotypical ""nice girl,"" (though her character in April Fool's Day was much more convincing and entertaining)...and the way the director not only pays homage to horror classic, but also the way he pokes fun at it.  I'm not completely sure he did this on purpose, but certain scenes involving Dana Ashbrook's character and the local sherriff suggest that the tone of the film was meant to be both comedic and horrific.  Even though the movie is not completely brilliant or polished, it still provides entertainment to a certain audience who typically enjoys these kinds of flicks.  P.S. Don't bother with the sequel.",994291200,9,1781,4.7435064935064934
313915,2,630120879X,"This is a lame dark comedy that utilizes gore in order to present itself as a horror movie (which it isn't; there isn't one remotely chilling moment in the film). The film starts on a solid footing, rapidly unveiling an  interesting concept and showing honest potential...however, the whole thing  just as quickly falls apart due to inane tongue-in-cheek dialogue and the  typical late 80s action/adventure cheese. The movie looks like it was made  for video, it just lacks that big screen feel...and classic monsters NEED  THAT BIG SCREEN FEEL! Some of the gore is pretty good (for example, the  partially eaten--but still living--man in the Count's basement), but the  movie lacks the visceral horror punch of (let's say) the original Nightmare  on Elm Street or Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and this is due largely to the  fact that Hickox can't make up his mind about what kind of film he is  trying to make...is it a comedy or a horror movie? He attempts to make it  both with rather forgettable results. I gave this movie two stars because  the actors do their best to slog through a real mess of a film: the great  Patrick McNee (I wish he would have stayed out of that ridiculous suped-up  camoflauged wheelchair...), David Warner, and Deborah Foreman make the  movie bearable enough to sit all the way through. Debby Foreman's scenes  with the Marquis De Sade are almost worth the price of the video. All in  all, this feature had the potential to be a horror classic, but bad  cinematography, lame dialogue, and the near total lack of any genuine  thrills destroyed that potential quickly.",961113600,3,1595,4.819188191881919
313916,5,630120879X,"I saw this movie for the first time a long time ago and it was easily one of my favorite horror movies. So recently, I decided to go back and see it again just to see if I still liked it which I did.  I still enjoyed the  humor, the story, the characters, and the gore.
  The movie itself is  about a wax musuem that displays some of the most evil men/creatures to  have ever existed such as a vampire, a werewolf, a mummy, and so forth.  They appear to be harmless wax figures, most of which are missing victims.  A closer look can prove to be fatal for whatever unsuspecting person enters  the exhibit and is taken to the scene that is displayed.  When all of the  exhibits on display have claimed a victim then the creatures in the display  will come to life and wreck havoc on the world.",957657600,6,791,4.1655629139072845
313917,4,630120879X,"I resent the use of teenagers in a horror movie (or any other type). By nature they are too unreal and scare the children. However, as the box promises, this movie is more fun than a barrel of mummies. The  cinematography is very good and so is the art design.  The plot (?)  advances quickly, constantly changing characters. Old timers, like Patrick  McGee, have a field day and and it is nice to see them enjoying themselves.

How could it not with a cast that includes David Warner and Zach Gallagan fresh from his staring role in ""Gremlins"" and the sequel? What elevates this B movie to stardom is Deborah Foreman's performance as a young virgin enthralled by the Marquis de Sade.  Even Patrick MacNee's campy performance cannot tarnish that perfect gem.

Typical 80s fare and so much more. It's a shame that Deborah Foreman's career was short-lived and she didn't reach superstar heights. Her performances remain better than the movies that she has done.

Never did the lines feel forced or awkward, and the characters for the most part were animated/not stiff (except for scenes where they were probably directed to act so). The pacing of the plot was perfect; never once did it get too boring, drawn out, or convoluted. This was essential in helping with the great suspense that the movie creates. They touch on a wide range of lore, not all of it necessarily paranormal, and they did a wonderful job of presenting all of it, without butchering any well established folk history on any of the subjects. The music fit decently (was a mix of typical 80s-style soundtrack with traditional horror movie instrumentals). And as far as special effects go, they were mostly directed to the gore aspect of the different scenes. The gore was not over the top and ridiculous, which made it even more chilling.

About midway through we discover that the exhibits will all come to life and roam the Earth once someone has been killed in each one.

The movie is campy. The plot and cheesy effects reminded me of ""Saturday the 14th"" a spoof I consider superior to this one. The dialouge was not conducive to a decent proof. The film strained to be funny. This is only for 80's horror fans. Try not to laugh at the werewolf mask too much.

314261,3,630120879X,"Anthony Hickox has been directing films fairly steadily since 1988, but if you look at those titles, few pop up that are known to most movie goers. He just never achieved the attention of the big studios and the big budgets.

Here's the scoop. A group of college friends are surprised to see that a mansion in their neighborhood is being turned into a wax museum featuring famous historic murderers and monsters. The mysterious owner of said mansion invites them to a private, midnight showing. When they attend, some end up going through a portal taking them into the realm of the real bad guys. As it turns out they are demons ready to conquer the world.

Other reviewers have noted that this is cheesy by nature. That is more than true so buyer beware: You need to put yourself in that frame of mind if you're going to enjoy this. This sort of movie has gotten so much better over the years in all aspects. Writing, directing, effects have all matured exponentially. As a result, this is a bit rough to watch. It's fun in its own way, just don't expect a lot out of it. I must say I'm curious as to how they got the likes of David Warner, Patrick MacNee and John Rhys Davies to show up. That is some high priced talent. The three principal actors all do a decent job and all have had steady careers since.

Some of the costumes and effects are suspect and most of the props could have been better. As this is Hickox's first outing, my guess he was working on a tight budget which accounts for some of the shortcomings. All in all this is a fun time.

314263,4,630120879X,"You might think that a movie titled ""Waxwork"" is about some guy who kills people and turns them into wax mannequins, like in House of Wax starring Vincent Price.  And for the first half of Waxwork, you'd be right.

But Anthony Hickox, who directed Waxwork, wasn't content to just direct a horror movie.  He wanted to direct ALL of them.  So he dreamed up this idea (he's also the writer) of a waxwork display serves as a gate to a pocket dimension, where unsuspecting visitors are put in the roles of the victims.  If the victim dies, their dead bodies become part of the waxwork.  Clever, huh?

Of course, this being an 80s movie, Waxwork is stuffed with characters from The Breakfast Club: the slut (China), the virgin (Sarah), the confused protagonist (Mark), miscellaneous female sidekick (Gemma), her ""cool"" boyfriend (Tony) and the prankster moron (James).  They're all there to die of course.

Why?  Does anyone really care? Oh all right if you insist...

Mark's grandfather was a benevolent adventurer who, for reasons that make sense only in movie-land, collected trinkets from eighteen of the most evil people who ever lived.  Mr. Lincoln (David Warner) has sold his soul to the devil and plans to bring about a zombie apocalypse by feeding victims to the wax effigies of each of the villains. Lincoln kills Mark's grandfather in the first few minutes of the movie, stealing his artifacts and embedding them in his wax effigies. This makes no sense, but Waxwork is unconcerned by your petty notions of plot and narrative. It's only out to show cool monsters killing people.

What we get, then, is a bunch of vignettes where some poor unsuspecting idiot stumbles into a waxwork display and, discombobulated and suddenly in the role of the victim, struggles to survive.  Let the Battle Royale begin (this review contains spoilers)!

DING DING!

TONY VS. WEREWOLF: Actually, it's Tony vs. John Rhys-Davies as the werewolf, who must have been hard up for work.  No matter, he promptly becomes a werewolf after sending Tony out for firewood.  Tony, confused and thinking this is a trick (because that's of course what victims do), plays along until the werewolf bites him.  Seconds later HE'S a werewolf and two hunters come in to finish the job.  So actually it's TONY VS. OLD GUY WITH SILVER BULLET.  Two guesses who wins.

But that was just the warm up act.  What we really want to see how China, ahem, handles herself.

CHINA VS. DRACULA: Oh this is going to be good.  China is in a gothic-style mansion where Dracula and his host as eating raw meat.  What ensues is an oddly slow, creepy dinner scene that features no violence whatsoever.  Until China goes to bed, a vampire tries to eat her, and as she flees she stumbles upon her fake fianc&eacute;e strapped to a table.  That's when the fun starts: the vampires have kept him alive while they feast on the bloody remnants of his leg.  This leads to China fighting off a whole host of vampires, until she finally meets Big D himself. Does China ""can't a girl get laid around here without being burned at the stake"" have a chance?  That's foreshadowing folks.

The movie then injects an odd dose of reality as Sarah and Mark go to the police to plead their case.  Detective Roberts is unimpressed but decides to check it out on his own along with his silent partner (the one in the bad Miami Vice getup).  But who cares about him?  What we're really here for is...

DETECTIVE ROBERTS VS. THE MUMMY: Roberts, unlike the other idiots, knows how to handle himself.  Roberts is thrust into the role of an adventurer along with his helpless female sidekick and a Howard Carter stand in.  They open the tomb, only to release a black-ooze drooling mummy, who proceeds to kill fake-Carter and throw everyone else in the sarcophagus.  See, even kick-ass cops get killed in Waxwork.

Of course, Sarah and Mark then have to investigate things themselves.  Which leads to...

MARK VS. ZOMBIES: Mark ends up in Night of the Living Dead.  He escapes by shouting that old D&D maxim, ""I disbelieve!"" And it actually works.  Except for the whole dismembered zombie hand...

ZOMBIE HAND VS. WAXWORK: This zombie hand actually launches its own franchise later.  Seriously, this has to be the first case of a zombie hand becoming so pivotal to a plot that it launches a sequel.

SARAH VS. THE MARQUIS DE SADE: Now don't get me wrong, de Sade is pretty villainous but...really?  The Marquis de Sade?  Fine.  Sarah, virginal, sweet Sarah, falls under his hypnotic spell, whereupon R-rated tortures take place, including a prolonged whipping scene with lots of moaning.  In fact, this whole scene drags for a while and starts to get a little uncomfortable.  Eventually, Mark shows up to rescue her.  The Marquis de Sade, who we didn't realize until now is apparently the main villain, promises revenge.

JAMES AND GEMMA VS. PLOT DEVICE: Lincoln needed four victims (poor Roberts doesn't count, I guess), so James and Gemma have gotta go. They take Sarah and Mark's place as corpses in the waxwork displays.

BABY FROM IT'S ALIVE!, AUDREY FROM LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS, RANDOM AXE MURDERER...YOU GET THE IDEA VS. EVERYBODY: Mark's wheelchair-bound uncle Sir Wilfred, his butler, and a bunch of guys with pitchforks and guns come in and burn the place down in a grand, awkward melee.  Rubber masks are smashed with bats, miscellaneous extras are hurled through the air, and much mayhem is made. In the fracas, de Sade has a sword fight (?) with Mark, who wields his grandfather's magical saber (?!) bestowed upon Mark by his uncle. And then somebody falls into a vat of wax, because this movie is named Waxwork and somebody has to.

The end.

Waxwork was made by a horror buff that loved all these old horror movies but didn't feel like they had enough gore, so he went and filmed his own versions with a bigger special effects budget. By far the best effect is the dimensional transition between the scenes.

Oh sure, the acting is terrible, the jokes aren't all that funny, and the plot makes no sense whatsoever.  But you know what?  This movie is so fully of cheesiness, special effects, and gore that it rises above it all to turn into some kind of monumental tower of waxy, cheesy awesome.

And for that this movie gets three zombie fingers and a thumbs up.",1262649600,,6297,4.7272727272727275

The format of the film is somewhat episodic - a large proportion of the film is made up of segments in which the various characters enter into the waxwork tableaux - and normally this would annoy me, but in this case, each of the episodes (featuring such classic horror villains as vampires, werewolves, the mummy, zombies and the Marquis de Sade) is so well made that I actually found myself looking forward to the next waxwork episode. They're just like something out of an old horror movie, only gorier. What really makes this film stand out, however, is the sub-plot involving the virginal heroine of the story, Sarah (Deborah Foreman), and her fascination with the Marquis de Sade. Traditionally the heroines of horror movies are portrayed as ""good"" and ""innocent"", and for the most part Sarah is. She just happens to have masochistic tendencies. It's something that I haven't seen in a teen-targeted horror film before or since and it is one of the main reasons why I keep coming back to the film (I've seen it three times now)... That and the fact that it's a lot of fun. I strongly recommend this film.",1236038400,,1435,4.583657587548638

Gore, sexuality, and comedy. Who can forget Dana Ashbrook's classic line ""Who put the acid in my drink again, China!"" Too funny for words.",1029888000,2,289,4.471698113207547

Amazon IS the VERY BEST to buy from! so, got this movie from them later, it plays well and I AM VERY HAPPY!!!!",1519603200,,523,4.188118811881188
7809871,5,630120879X,"I know this movie is terrible, a cheesy representation of horror from the late 80s full of camp and big hair, and attempts at dark humor.  I absolutely love this movie though and share it with as many people as I can manage.  If you are looking for a lot of camp and a fun ""horror"" Movie be prepared for cheesy graphics but this is one of my favorites.",1511481600,,352,4.086956521739131
