6472235,5,B00L5VZPMQ,My stars speak for themselves. Anything Morrissey and anything from Amazon in perfect for me :))),1413849600,2,97,5.125
6472236,5,B00L5VZPMQ,Best Morrissey DVD so far. Sounds very good- bands at their prime. Morrissey's voice is perfect. Will take you to a better time and place.,1410825600,6,138,4.56
8663956,5,B00L5VZPMQ,"Yes, I can see why Moz is popular among latinos and yes he is the king of indie britpop and britrock, Hail Morrissey.",1524873600,,117,4.130434782608695
8663957,4,B00L5VZPMQ,"I love this period of Morrissey's career. I've seen him live many times over the decades, and these two shows are excellent in their energy and musical quality, plus Moz's voice is in top form. This video captures all of his enthusiasm, joy, and aggression while performing. He hasn't done most of these songs live in a very long time so it's great to have a record of them via video. My only complaint (hence four stars instead of five) is that the editing is too heavy handed. The constant cuts and jumps (often every few seconds) get irritating and distracting when you just want to watch Moz and the band do their thing. I get why James O'Brien likely did it that way, to add to the frenetic energy of the performances. But it ends up detracting from rather than adding to the film.",1500336000,,786,4.427586206896552
8663958,5,B00L5VZPMQ,Just amazing as expected. Certainly worth a few bucks for a rental no matter how many times you've watched him perform in the past. It builds toward a tremendous finish. Will always remember this. Performance was right about the time I first discovered Morrissey and got sucked in by his mysterious captivating quality. I can't explain why I'm so mesmerized by Moz. It seems to defy all my other musical preferences and any logical explanation I can come up with. And that's the beauty of it.,1460937600,,492,4.732558139534884
8663959,5,B00L5VZPMQ,"THIS IS KABOOM AWESOME!  I've seen alot of Moz gigs but this one is 'a band apart' from those vids.  This set is comprised of all Morrissey material in 1995, no smiths tunes on this one guys but it is so good you won't care, promise.  I consider myself a huge fan but this gig totally threw me off, I was being turned onto a period in his career where he is separating himself from the Smiths and unleashing these monster tracks, Morrissey speaking.  This is a great performance and not just another 'show' like 25 alive.",1457395200,,521,4.34020618556701
8663960,5,B00L5VZPMQ,Deuces Morrissey it's not fair I love him whatever you do I love him hopefully one day I can see in this is my only dream thank you,1440806400,,131,3.7142857142857144
8663961,5,B00L5VZPMQ,A diffferent kind of singer....he is fascinating on stage. Really liked it but I watched some of his newer stuff...much older now. The mystique is kind of dissipated but I'm older too so I get the vanishing aura. A great singer in his day.,1434844800,,239,4.454545454545454
