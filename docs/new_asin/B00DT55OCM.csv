5853968,5,B00DT55OCM,Many of these very bright children are crushed and broken before their gifts are discovered. This documentary does a good job of helping to see and understand. Looking forward to any followup documentaries on this subject.,1390867200,3,222,5.194444444444445
5853969,5,B00DT55OCM,"I really loved this DVD--it gave so many examples of those children or adults having dyslexia have found many ways to help their continuing issues, but have special ways of thinking that those without dyslexia don't possess. Many times they see a bigger picture and envision and end result that many of us don't possess. Due to these special abilities, many dyslexics are CEOs and entrepreneurs. While many students may have this issue, only 1 in 10 have been diagnosed. I suspect there are more than that. Audiobooks and technological advances should be able to help. I sent it to my family to view. They are on the other side of the world.",1389484800,4,641,4.68141592920354
5853970,4,B00DT55OCM,DVD was a great insight in to Dyslexia. Very positive stories and great encouragement for kids struggling with dyslexia. Gives them great stories of people who have struggled with it and how successful they have become,1388275200,,218,5.083333333333333
5853971,5,B00DT55OCM,"I caught this on HBO and it really touched me. I am a person who FIGHTS (I do NOT suffer from) Dyslexia every single day. As a child I was in ""special ed"" and never excelled academically and I did not go to college. I have always felt a stigma and although my IQ is substantially higher than that of my peers I was not able to grasp the concepts or learn like they did. It hurt.
After watching this documentary it gave me hope. Seeing Richard Branson and Charles Schwab talk about the *exact* struggles I go through every day made me really feel like I was not alone. Several of the learning quirks I deal with I had no idea were caused by my dyslexia. I think this video should be in the library of every school, church, college, Dr's Office, HR Office and employment center around the world. Great work putting this together and THANK YOU!",1388102400,,841,4.29559748427673
5853972,3,B00DT55OCM,"While it was nice to hear from other families dealing with Dyslexia there wasn't a lot of info about Dyslexia, I felt. I liked it but I don't feel like I walked away with a better understanding of Dyslexia.  I did walk away knowing I'm not alone as a parent.",1387843200,3,258,4.16
5853973,5,B00DT55OCM,"This documentary has something to offer dyslexics, their families and friends, and their teachers. In addition to educating about dyslexia, it shows the importance of self-awareness and self-advocacy for individuals with dyslexia (or other learning disabilities). It highlights the positive benefits in the way dyslexics think. It also gives hope and encouragement while acknowledging the struggles and limitations imposed by dyslexia. In addition to all that - it's an excellent piece of film-making, so it is highly enjoyable to watch. As an administrator of a program for students with learning disabilities and ADHD I've shown it to teachers, parents and students and have had positive responses from everyone who has seen it!",1385942400,4,730,5.526785714285714
5853974,5,B00DT55OCM,An amazingly positive message!  A must see for anyone who has or knows someone with dyslexia.  It was really helpful to my 9 year old.,1385856000,3,134,4.32
5853975,5,B00DT55OCM,"Dyslexia runs in my family and I feel this documentary is the best I've ever seen on this topic.  It not only helps the child or adult who lives with dyslexia to better understand it, but it also explains to non dyslexic family members why we sometimes curse and other times appreciate the way our brains work.  One of the happiest days of my life was when my then teenage daughter told me that if she had the choice, she'd still want to be dyslexic because it gives her a different perspective on everything.  I feel the same way.  I sent the DVD to her, and her 3 children, 2 of whom are also dyslexic.  If you are an educator, or dyslexic, or have a dyslexic family member, please watch this DVD.  It is a treasure. Thank you so much, Sir Richard!",1385251200,8,750,4.246478873239437
5853976,5,B00DT55OCM,This is a must-see movie for anyone with dyslexia.  It is also a must-see documentary for teachers to help them understand diverse learners.

It gives hope to those who are dyslexic through interviews with those who live with the condition. The film shows many people who have become successful despite the diagnosis. I recommend it for students, parents and other adults with no reservation.",1445472000,,330,4.910714285714286

5854003,5,B00DT55OCM,"Definitely recommend this for a general eye opening introduction to the world with dyslexia.

5854006,5,B00DT55OCM,"I watched this video to see if it had any additional insight on Dyslexia. After watching it, I made the decision to allow my 10 yr old daughter to watch. She struggles with dyslexia, as I did/do. It helped her discover she was not alone in her struggles.  She realized that, yes it is difficult to have dyslexia but people with dyslexia have the talent to look, see, and interpret things that ""normal"" people can not. This documentary really helped her to understand that, Yes she is different, but not in a bad way, Her brain works and learns differently than others.  The challenge the documentary showed was that there will be challenges, mainly due to the ""normal"" school systems do not understand and can not teach her the way she learns best.  This documentary gave her the courage to go to school that week and stand up for her self in her class.  She reminded her teacher she doesn't learn the same way as other kids in her class and it was mom, dad, and the teachers job to help her find the best way for her to learn, and it was her job to let them know when something works and when she gets frustrated.  I think this documentary was a homerun in my household.",1435449600,2,1171,4.377880184331797

The only time this may be useful is for someone who has never heard of dyslexia.  Also I hear you can watch it for free on youtube.",1432425600,2,291,4.314814814814815
5854039,5,B00DT55OCM,It arrived fast!  The DVD was so interesting that I now understand why I do things the way I do!  I just wish my teachers and parents know about this way back in the 1950's when I was going to school.  It makes so much sense!  WOW is all I can say.,1432166400,,248,3.7115384615384617

5854043,4,B00DT55OCM,"I think it helped both my kids to see and understand themselves a little better. It had some good information, but it could have gone further. Most of the stuff I already knew, but the stories were good for my kids to see. It is worth watching.",1428537600,,244,4.212765957446808
5854044,5,B00DT55OCM,"Unfortunately, like many teachers, I received very little training in how to help dyslexic children as part of my credentialing process. My first real encounter with dyslexia was when a beautiful third grader named Maricella grabbed my wrist and asked me to hold the flashcard steady because the words were moving. Holy crap, I remember thinking. I have no idea what to do.

Ever since that moment Ive read everything I could about dyslexia, even now when Im not longer a teacher. Many of the methods used to help dyslexic children are good ideas that can be used for all students. Be patient. Figure out what you are actually testingreading speed or thinking? Teach kids how to take notes in a way that makes sense to each individual brain. Use technology to accentuate learning. Most importantly, empower kids to own their education.

What I loved about The Big Picture: Rethinking Dyslexia is that it is inspiring. Big names like Charles Schwab and Sir Richard Branson share how the gifts of dyslexia have helped them in life. At the same time, all of the cast is upfront about the challenges they have had to overcome.

The Big Picture: Rethinking Dyslexia is a movie all teachers should watch. Since 1 in 5 people have dyslexia, parents should absolutely see this film too. It all comes back to good teaching. There are a million ways to learn and the move paths to success we offer children, the faster they will succeed.",1422576000,4,1427,4.745967741935484

5854094,5,B00DT55OCM,"Being a dyslexic myself and an individual who's been studying it for the past few years, I really enjoyed this movie. It was wonderful to see people tell their stories about how they figured out how to compensate for themselves, what they find annoying about how people perceive them and how they each found personal success in their own ways.

I could have done without some of the sad music, since that seemed to put some of the more difficult aspects into that uncomfortable space of melodrama, but overall, it's a great movie.",1394409600,,530,4.698924731182796
5854095,5,B00DT55OCM,"Very interesting information about dyslexia.  As a mother and teacher of a dyslexic child, I found this information very helpful.  My son found help through the Davis Dyslexia Program.  It was a Godsend!!!!",1393804800,4,206,5.181818181818182

8597398,5,B00DT55OCM,"As a teacher and a person who has suffered with a learning disability (probably dyslexia) and ADHD my entire life, I found myself rewinding and rewinding this movie to the point of obsession. It is a fantastic movie!  I did so  because I wanted to catch all of the great moments with which I connected and celebrated as I found myself reliving my own disappointments and successes throughout my life just as the people in the movie touched upon.  Anyone who has dyslexia or thinks they know someone that may be dyslexic should see this movie.  It will inspire you to get the help you need and help for a loved one.  I waited until I had the courage at 30 and regret that I didn't have the chance that we have today to help children at a young age.  Early diagnosis is critical and this movie can only help.  What a well done movie!!! This is a great movie and I will not only show it to my students and parents/guardians of my students, but recommend that my colleagues will join in and show it to their students as well. I have a library, in my classroom, of books and movies touching on dyslexia and other learning ABILITIES and I will happily put this in the library at the top of my must see category!

8597404,3,B00DT55OCM,"I think a better documentary would be about why a lot of people with dyslexia FAIL - and how can we keep that from happening.  When you focus on 'superstars'/the penultimate successes you have to wonder...did they succeed so overwhelmingly BECAUSE they were dyslexic or IN SPITE of their dyslexia.  There are hugely successful people who don't have dyslexia.

How can we keep people with dyslexia excited to learn about the world and guided to the things in which that particular individual can be their best?

I don't agree that everyone with dyslexia has great problem-solving skills to make them great lawyers/surgeons/original thinkers and the other examples provided in this documentary.  Some people with dyslexia are pretty average in their cognitive skills.  Some people with dyslexia are below average in their cognitive skills.  Some people with dyslexia can draw a recognizable picture.  Some people with dyslexia never get past drawing the house and stick figure of the 3 year old.  You CAN be dyslexic AND 'gifted' but not all people with dyslexia  ARE 'gifted' nor are all 'gifted' people dyslexic.

This film over-compensates in order to be inspirational but sometimes that can be debilitating to someone searching desperately for their competencies.",1492041600,4,1265,5.243781094527363

8597407,5,B00DT55OCM,"The Big Picture brought relief, validation, insight, joy and inspiration to my family.  The film beautifully depicts inspirational stories of individuals of all ages going through their struggles within the traditional education paradigm, then recognizing how to find solutions to their challenges and how to maximize and celebrate their strengths.

This film helped our son understand the context of his own set of challenges and see how other people found their way and succeeded in discovering their own strengths. We give copies of this film to teachers who are interested because it helps illuminate a greater understanding of what children with dyslexia are dealing with on a day-to-day basis and what it's like to walk in their shoes while at the same time it shows how much talent and intelligence they possess.

As Sally Shaywitz says, dyslexia brings with it an island of weaknesses within a sea of strengths.  The strengths include strategic thinking, a big picture grasp of high level concepts, creative and innovative thinking, and high intelligence in the visual/spatial realm.  In the film, some famous people of our day speak candidly and humbly of their experiences with being dyslexic.

I sometimes wonder if the majority of people were dyslexic, would we have an educational system with a completely different focus and would the non-dyslexic people be at a disadvantage?",1476057600,,1390,5.238738738738738
