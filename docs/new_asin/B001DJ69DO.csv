8293577,3,B001DJ69DO,I'll bet money this DVD is a VHS/or BETA recording that was converted to DVD! Picture and sound quality is TERRIBLE! I guess for a few bucks it's not bad but I expected better!!!,1505865600,,178,4.264705882352941

8293579,5,B001DJ69DO,This is a digital version of a great race that I once recorded highlights of on a VHS tape but I wanted the video on a disc.  Packaging also looks nice.,1420070400,,152,3.903225806451613
8293580,5,B001DJ69DO,This is when stock car racing was good racing. Any sports fan would enjoy Nascar back then. A must buy for all race fans.,1289260800,2,121,4.083333333333333
