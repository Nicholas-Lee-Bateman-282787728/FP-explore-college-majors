By the end , if you are not touched by the series themes, motifs and direction, I would advise you to look somewhere else. This is definetly a underrated show. Kudos to Maki Horikita for her performance as the bully mastermind. Check it out!",1245196800,,388,4.47887323943662

The story is about a high school class that has been traumatized by its teacher...the result, the students don't trust teachers or any adult for that matter. The incident, a hiking trip gone wrong, is a lil unbelievable in the way it's presented. The students can't get over it and walk around wearing frowns thru the series, Kowai!
The class also defends itself from pesky grownups with a lil yakuza like group of students called 3TD. A new teacher comes in who tries her best to make the class trust adults once more only to fail repeatedly(Rina Uchiyama...Kawaii!)  The subtitles go from good to super bad before you get to the halfway point making it painful to watch. At first I wasn't too fond of this series but after a second viewing I think it has some merit",1238457600,,869,4.642857142857143
