8687204,4,B0000E6EL7,"This video is shot entirely on location in various parts of Iran. Almost the entire footage is taken in spiritual locations. The cover of the video states ""an eye-opening pilgrimage to spiritual enlightenment."" The video reveals spiritual rites and rituals hidden for centuries. There is some fantastic footage of spiritual music and dance in a ritual that lasts for hours.",1105920000,,373,5.233333333333333
8687205,3,B0000E6EL7,"I have to say that this isn't all that bad. The footage is stunning, and it is worth the price for that alone. Sure, the commentary is problematic to say the least and not so well-informed, but don't most such videos have such problems. Of course , it would be great to have a good script as well as the footage, but we can dream on. I invariably tell my students to treat narrator's comments critically when watching videos in class.

One thing that did worry me was the presenter showing off about filming a woman in ecstasy when she had not known that the cameras were still filming. Not very fair, in my humble opinion. Also, I think that the director should have allowed the dervishes to speak for themselves through interpreters rather than rely on her own rather limited knowledge of Sufism to explain things.",1101600000,,816,4.551020408163265
8687206,1,B0000E6EL7,"This is a complete waste of money if you want to use it for teaching purposes, as I had wanted to. Some of the footage of remote parts of beautiful Iran is breathtaking, but even the narrator's attractive voice cannot compensate for such an appallingly ill-informed and self-indulgent script. Beware! This is not the work of a serious scholar or mystic of any kind, but a self-indulgent director who takes herself far too seriously. If you can find a way of removing the narration, and simply using the footage, then that could be useful. Otherwise it would be far too damaging for serious college-level students, and is more likely to make them cringe or laugh than learn. Very poor, apart from the camera work, which is wasted on the script. They should make a new version with most of the same footage but a new and intelligent script.",1079308800,3,838,4.668918918918919
