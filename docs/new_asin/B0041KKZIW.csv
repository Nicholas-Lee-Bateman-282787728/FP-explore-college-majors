4242888,3,B0041KKZIW,"This HBO film is more about the career and life of Martha Gellhorn who became Ernest Hemingway's third wife.  Don't get me wrong, Clive Owen's Hemingway gets equal screen time with beautiful Nicole Kidman's Gellhorn but as she puts it at the end of the movie, she won't be a footnote in someone else's life.

With a close up of Kidman as a now 70-something subject of an interview, the opening scene gives the viewer an idea of the quality that would persist throughout the next 2  hours.  I'm reminded of Kidman's ability to become unrecognizable in ""The Hours"" from 2002.  Here as well, as she not only uses a masterful makeup job but the deeper voice and cadence of an older more experienced woman.  Marty Gellhorn was a reporter for ""Collier's"" magazine, a weekly that competed with ""Life"" and ""Look"" in days past.  After meeting Hemingway in a sweaty bar in Key West, she becomes interested in a civil war in Spain which would eventually lead up to WW II.

While Hemingway goes there as well, he goes in luxury as the famed writer that he was.  Gellhorn, hitches rides where she can, including inside an army tank.  Directed by Phillip Kaufman (""The Right Stuff""), the film mixes in scenes in beautiful living color along with regular changes that drift throughout the artist pallet.  This includes grainy black and white to match real news footage of the late 1930's.  That trick was a little off-putting at first but becomes very effective as the film progresses.

While I'm a big fan of Clive Owen, I wasn't taken with him as Hemingway.  While it seems clear, Hemingway was loud and boisterous and loved women, booze and a good time, Owen just seemed over the top at times.  Kidman was perfect.  From the aging newswoman to the long-legged blond in tight pants, she gets your attention.  The movie is longer than it needs to be, but is none-the-less and effective portrayal of Ernest Hemingway and the lesser known Martha Gellhorn.",1340841600,55,1939,4.689349112426036

BOTH HEMMINGWAY AND GELLHORN WERE PORTRAYED AS CARICATURES OF THE REAL PEOPLE.  HEMMINGWAY WAS MUCH MORE THAN A CAROUSING DRUNK MOST OF THE TIME, AND GELLHORN WAS NOT THE SEXY, KITTENISH PERSON THAT KIDMAN SERVES UP.

4242890,5,B0041KKZIW,"This is a man's film! This is a woman's film.
 There are two sides to every story and the truth lies in the middle!
 This is a delicious trip for every man who has adored a woman he couldn't control. This is a vivid recollection for every woman who has given her heart to a self-centered,bastard who stole her heart.
 The dialogue is great,the simpatico between the two leads will have you grinning as you recall that great ""love of your life""!Long after the film has ended and the spanish guitar resonates in your soul, you will remember that special someone who lit up your life and your sheets and, for some, feel once again the nostalgia and choking remorse for never having been able to make it click!
 I can't say enough good things about this film. In my book, it's a keeper. ps. I'm on the list. ENJOY!",1339286400,26,810,4.38
4242891,2,B0041KKZIW,"Just watched HBO's Hemingway and Gellhorn...rather watched about half of it before deleting it.

A pretty bad movie. So bad, it reminded me of the movie ""Pearl Harbor"" from ten years (or so) ago, in that the viewer can tell there was a great deal of money spent to create the special effects and pay the salaries of the big-time stars in it.  However,  the script, directing, and overacting ruins this film.  I believe that some of the stars in it are undoubtedly embarrassed they agreed to do it.

How to describe it? Scenes so awful they were funny, chock full of dumb lines, and overacting. The writing and directing? Nevermind.",1339286400,10,631,4.648648648648648
4242892,1,B0041KKZIW,"The two main characters--Hemingway (Clive Owen) and Gelhorn ( Nicole Kidman) are supposedly supporters of the  poor commoners of Spain, yet they are portrayed as royalty themselves. This is evident in the very first scene in the bar. It's as if the proles in the bar are ignorant dirtbags who defer worshipfully to the superior wit, intelligence and physical beauty of the two main characters. In other words, it's typical Hollywood--shallow elitist tripe.",1339200000,8,456,5.2465753424657535
4242893,5,B0041KKZIW,"Folks are being too hard on this film. First Kidman is sexy and magnificent as Gellhorn, especially when appearing as the aging writer with some wonderful reflective acting. Clive is very good, using his muscular stature and larger than life ""braggadocio"" style to project an especially beastial and boistorous Hemingway character, but I think also with a sensitive and human perspective.

The opening bloody scene with the Marlin is extremely evocative in summarizing Hemingway's philosophical view that brutality is, in a sense, at the center of life and that ""all things must die"".It clearly underlines the ""existential"" perspective that pervades Hemingway's writing, and his own violent and self-abusive struggle with life. However, what I found most remarkable is the semi-documentary style of the movie, with the grainy original footage, sometimes including digitized insets of Kidman and Clive. The gorgeous sets, the great supporting actors, the good, if not great, acting by the key characters, and a fabulous story of adventure and humanitarian horror, all project an engaging and eventful film well worth watching. I think it is a far better film than the academy award winning ""Reds"" by Warren Beatty (1981), similar in general plot and character. Overall, a very thought provoking and powerful experience.",1338422400,32,1318,5.429268292682927
4242894,4,B0041KKZIW,"The HBO movie, with Clive Owen and Nicole Kidman in the title roles was on last night. With the fabulous Molly Parker as Pauline Hemingway, wife number 2.  The film, which is better than just about anything I have seen lately - at home - or at the cinema - tells the story of the romance between writer Ernest Hemingway and his third wife, war correspondent Martha Gellhorn.  I just finished the book so am very familiar with the Hemingway and Gellhorn story which begins in 1936, when the two first meet at a bar in Key West. From there, they travel to Spain during the Spanish Civil War, then onto Cuba, China and Europe during World War II.  The film follows their tumultuous five-year marriage (which ended in 1945, with Gellhorn asking Hemingway for a divorce) on through Hemingway's suicide in 1951.  I don't understand why reviews have been mixed - although most critics praised Owen and Kidman's roles -- this is some of the best work for Kidman --  as the famous writers. My only quibble is Owen isn't burly enough physically; Kindman, however, has all the necessary assets, physically. The movie did a better job of setting the world scene than the book. And personal relationship portrayed in the book came to life on the screen. You aren't going to learn much about writing technique but who wants to see more scenes of people typing.  Who knew Hemingway was a spy for OSS and hunted German U-Boats in the Caribbean?  I should mention some of the other familiar names in the cast: Robert Duvall, Connie Nielsen, Parker Posey, Tony Shalhoub, David Strathairn, Peter Coyote, Joan Chen, Jeffrey Jones, Brooke Adams, Lars Ulrich (yes that, Lars Ulrich!).",1338249600,9,1662,4.730103806228374
4242895,3,B0041KKZIW,"Philip Kaufman who directed this long and boring mess of a film knows better (The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Twisted, etc) and the idea of reflecting on the relationship between Ernest Hemingway and Martha Gellhorn which took place during so many important historical events (Spanish Civil War in Franco's Spain, WW II complete with the Allied Invasion of Europe at Normandy Beach, the Russian Invasion of Finland, the turmoil in China as Communism rose in reaction to the Japanese invasion, the strange position of Cuba in all of this). But the screenplay is so mediocre to very bad (screenwriters Jerry Stahl and Barbara Turner) and the level of acting is so superficial that it simply falls flat.

Martha Gellhorn, the Collier's reporter who becomes a war correspondent and marries Ernest Hemingway as she travels up the ladder of fame, is by far the main character here.  A very well made-up aged Martha (Nicole Kidman) opens the story as she is being interviewed for a TV program.  We immediately are in flashbacks to how this stern woman met Hemingway in a Key West bar, matched him quip for poorly written quip and finally follows him in a very phony setup: Hemingway (Clive Owens in a shoddy performance) is traveling with John Dos Passos (David Strathairn), Spanish patriot Paco Zarra (Rodrigo Santoro) and crew to shoot a film by Joris Ivens (Lars Ulrich) to show the public the atrocities of Franco in the Spanish Revolution - a tiresomely overused gimmick. Everyone drinks a lot and Hemingway finally seduces Gellhorn to his bed in Madrid (he is currently married to the very Catholic Pauline (Molly Parker) who upon discovery his adultery refuses to divorce him). As the situation in Spain falls down, Hemingway and Gellhorn take their need to write - Hemingway to complete FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS and Martha flies off to various war fronts to be a war correspondent. Together they fight their way through experiences in China and other hot spots until ultimately Hemingway remains drunk in Cuba `fighting off German U boats' and Gellhorn gives up on him.

Nicole Kidman gives the only remarkable performance; Clive Owens could have phoned in his role.  Others in the huge cast of miniscule parts are Robert Duval , embarrassingly bad as a Russian General, Joan Chen as Madame Chiang, Tony Shalhoub as the Russian spy Koltsov, an excellent Santiago Cabrera as the famous war photographer Robert Capa, Peter Coyote (don't blink), Diane Baker, Parker Posey, and Connie Nielsen.  The film runs 2  hours on HBO and could easily have been edited down to an hour and a half.  The only real saving grace (meaning the only reason to watch it0 is the very artistic way the film is a blend between contemporary cinematography and real film footage from the events in the story. That part is Magical. Otherwise, this is a snooze fest.  Grady Harp, May 12",1338249600,8,2860,4.868312757201646
4242921,3,B0041KKZIW,"Nicole Kidman did a most admirable job portraying the young Gellhorn, although the older version who narrated the film was far too coarse and seemed to bear little relationship to her younger self, no matter how striking and convincing the Hollywood make-up artists were.. Converely, I thought this was one of Clive Owen's worst roles. He seriously overplayed  his hand in trying  to present the gruff, overly masculine and crass personality Hemingway may have been. He was almost wooden in his one-dimensional portrayal of Hemingway. The screenplay was not bad, but lagged frequently and had me checking on how much time there was left to the movie. The cinematography was the strongest aspect of the film interestingly and seamlessly fading in and out of period, grainy, even black and white photography and the latest HD quality film.",1513555200,4,837,5.102189781021898

4242923,5,B0041KKZIW,"I admit that my interest in writing and wanting to see what it was like for a career woman in the earlier part of the 1900s indirectly influenced my interest to see this film Hemingway and Gelhorn.  The positives; Both the characters of Ernest Hemingway (played by Clive Owen) and Martha Gelhorn (played by Nicole Kidman) are shown as two people who put much effort and boundless energy into their careers. The Hemingway and Gelhorn film shows that both of them (Ernest Hemingway and Martha Gelhorn)met at a club named Sloppy Joes.  Both Hemingway and Gelhorn are seemingly drawn together even after Gelhorn relocates to another location for her career objectives. One of the things that makes the story between Martha Gelhorn and Ernest Hemingway eerily tragic is that both of them died in a similar manner in real life even after they both romantically moved on to other people and career objectives. This is despite the fact that Ernest Hemingway is listed online via Wikipedia to have been born July 21, 1899 and Martha Gelhorn is listed via Wikipedia to have been born November 8, 1908.",1499040000,,1091,4.828877005347594

4242925,1,B0041KKZIW,"Unfortunately, unwatchable. I don't blame either of the lead actors, but they're both really over-the-top.  Hemingway and Gellhorn are portrayed as caricatures- I doubt the script writer or director had any idea of them as real multidimensional human beings. What was probably most off-putting to me was the way Nicole Kidman stared at everyone, all her character seemed to do is pivot around so her wide legged pants swished and staaaaaaaare.

4242927,1,B0041KKZIW,"I didn't get through too much of this absurd film.  Hemingway's arrogance is horrifying apparent from the beginning when, as he grinned, he beat a fish's head in after saying, ""Everything dies.""  Pity the fish didn't slap Hemingway overboard so that the latter could see how true his sociopathic statement was.  This violent scene was then followed by two arrogant people (Hemingway and Gellhorn) boasting and showing off in a bar.  One of the most annoying parts about that scene is Gellhorn admitting her inferiority as a writer to Hemingway.  How tiring the women-aren't-ever-as-good-as-men theme is.  At that point I'd seen enough.  Don't waste your time with this film.  It's absolute garbage.",1491955200,,698,5.169642857142857

Clive Owen is his usual, reliable self, but Hemingway is an outsize character and Owen is just not up to the role. Admittedly, few would be. Kidman on the other hand, does an outstanding job as the often overlooked female war correspondent Gellhorn, covering the Spanish Civil War and forging a passionate relationship with Hemingway. Oh, there's the usual bare skin that seems to come with a Kidman lead or co-lead, but she's so much more than that in this role. Because of the rocky and wild nature of Papa's first and third marriages, Gellhorn is often overlooked, but she was with him in his prime and she brought out the best in him. More correctly, they brought out the best in one another. Catch this on a rainy afternoon with someone you love and a bottle of good Spanish wine.",1479340800,3,851,4.605263157894737

4243109,3,B0041KKZIW,"I'm giving it 3 stars for the interesting time period and people it portrayed.  I'm not sure why Clive Owen was particularly annoying.  I'm guessing that Hemingway was annoying in many ways but also mesmerizing and absorbing in others.  Clive Owen was just annoying.  So then one had, while watching the movie, to intellectually image that people would be drawn to Hemingway because of his talent and fame.  But one did not during the movie feel drawn to him in any way.
Nicole Kidman is not my favorite actress, but here I have to say she was more than adequate.  One felt moved by her and drawn to her and in complete sympathy.  The writing was at times solid, but other times I shrugged and wondered what was the point of that scene, some of them so tiny as not to have been worth the actors time of putting on makeup.  Anyway, who doesn't want to know some information about this time in History and the players in it.  And who isn't a good friend of Eleanor Roosevelt's.",1471737600,,975,4.432584269662922

No one would stay as clean as she did, after a building she's in is bombed.

I probably should give it 5 stars because Clive Owen does give a great performance but I just didn't visualize him as Ernest Hemingway. Clive plays the role superbly portraying a massive ego, stubborn rigidity, and insensitive to knowing how to maintain a relationship. Also, the writing is excellent along with jumping from back and white film, old historical reels, to color. Nicole just out acts everyone. Emerging as a war correspondent evolves in a creative and complicated way unseen in most movies. A must watch if you can endure actual war footage that can bring pain to your heart and amazing acting of the complicated and intense relationship of Hemingway & Gellhorn...",1469577600,6,814,5.037037037037037

4243241,4,B0041KKZIW,I would have given this movie 5 stars but I withheld one because it contains one of the most graphic sex scenes I have seen.  I really think it is unnecessary - and it is really not all that esthetic either.  That aside the two stars look very much like Hemingway and Gellhorn and the movie portrays their story - or at least the Hollywood version of their story.

He was by no means a saint..., but to jump from Gellhorn to his final days, leaving out his nearly twenty-year experience with Mary - is simply atrocious.  Yes, Hemingway drank, but never during the writing process.  He severely criticized Faulkner for doing so, very publicly.  There are some good books available that tell a more accurate account, get one... forget this movie, it's not even entertaining.  P.S.

Hemingway is the least interesting feature; the famous writer is depicted in cardboard. When you have a character whose whole life, vision of the world, passions, tragedies, shortcomings everybody knows about, you have to be as careful as a great painter. In the film I felt as if I were reading paper from a college paper mill about his personality and life.

Russians are their typical political types, like a big corporation except instead of firing you they shoot you and no one is really sure. Communists scare the hell out of the Americans, the Americans miss their chance to see what they will be facing and NAZIs get a chance to work the bugs out of their latest weapons and develop their tactical skills before they move on to the rest of Europe. Hemingway doesn't dominate the show but gets some good lines in, like when writing early in the morning (and always standing up) ""Writing is like Mass, if you don't show up God gets mad.""

4243444,4,B0041KKZIW,"An interesting HBO film, I felt it was very slanted towards the life of Martha Gellhorn, which was perfectly fine because Ernest Hemingway seems like a complete egotistical ass in this film.

The film begins with a super close-up of Nicole Kidman as a 70+ Gellhorn, speaking to interviewers about her life. As she speaks, we are taken into the story as she recounts it. What I enjoyed most was the use of sepia, black and white as well as color film, and the mixing of old reels with the new footage. It really made you feel you were ""in the story"" as she told it. The make-up was incredible and Kidman really looked the part. Clive Owen did a good job as Hemingway, though I did not care for him in this role. He was rude, womanizing, drunk, selfish and crass. Perhaps I just did not like seeing an actor I respect play such a jerk.

Martha (Marty) Gellhorn worked for Collier's Magazine and went to cover the Spanish civil war after she became enamored with Hemingway after a chance meeting in Key West. There they have an affair which leads to their marriage. She was the third wife of Hemingway. Something that she mentions in the interview is that she did not want to be a footnote in Hemingway's life and the way the film was portrayed - she was. I know it was the time and so on, but this woman made a name for herself way before the man. She worked harder and endured much more dangerous situations over the course of his life - yet his name is known the world over and hers is not.

The film prompted me to do some research on both of the characters and I was blown away with all that I learned about this incredible woman. Knowing all I do now, I watched the film a second time and enjoyed it even more. A true to life story based on the lives of these two writers - it is a must for history buffs and fans of Hemingway and Gellhorn.",1425427200,,1843,4.230113636363637

They both did admirable work but the personal lives as portrayed here were overblown. I got SO tired of Kidman smoking and blowing out lots of smoke.

We see lots of types of death in the film as they did. Nothing more the work of pure evil as that of the Devil Hitler.  Gelhorn was a pure being of ethics and it could not be compromised by anything, or anyone.  That's probably why the concept of marriage was a problem. It required constant compromise of individual needs, particularly for women at that time. Hemmingway would have required the ultimate of compromise. His narcissism required that everything be sacrificed to his ego, his selfishness. And whether they complied or not, he was as cruel as he could be, to prove that even love had no hold on him. Though I'm not so sure he loved women. Just needed them to reassure himself, until he didn't. Hemmingway's name may have given her access, but Gelhorn owed him no more than he owed her. She was her own person.  He was too, as much pain as that was for him.

Yes, some nudity (Nicole is lovely; as a guy, I won't comment on Clive), so not great for children or young teens.  But for mature teens and adults, it's gritty and harsh.  Very good cinematography.  Very human.  Very good segment on the Spanish Civil War, not quite as good with the Chiang Kai Chek/China segment.  My Army dad worked with the Gimo for nearly a year with MAAG.  Alcoholism was rampant with many correspondents (my field), but this might be a little over the top even with Hemingway's known public bio.

4243654,4,B0041KKZIW,"A long time ago when after I had come of age, come of political age in my early twenties, an old socialist I knew and sought personal and political consul from told me after I had ended a fiery affair with a fellow women political activist that that combination did not mix. Meaning that between ego, the stress of high-wire political activity, and just the likelihood of long separations portended doom to two highly political types surviving together for long. (He did not mention the sexual temptations of being away a lot although if I had asked he probably would have added that as well, or as he well should have). Well, apparently, no, obviously, two literary types like Ernest Hemingway and Martha Gellhorn the subjects of this film under review, Hemingway and Gellhorn, are under the same constraints. From a long look (almost two and one half hours) at the film it sure looked that way.

When you think about it the above comment makes sense. Take one high-powered manly man (from all appearances, inclinations, life-style and his own bravado) and a top-rated 20th century author, Ernest Hemingway (played by Clive Owen), and one fetching fearless and feisty journalist, Martha Gellhorn(played by Nicole Kidman), and while sparks may fly in the bedroom they almost surely would fly when careers and other issues came up as well, and they did. From the first meeting in Hemingway watering hole Key West (among many others) when they began that dance that eventually led to the bedroom there was always a  one-ups-manship (oops personship) relationship between them from drinking each other under the table to vying for interesting and dangerous war assignments. War assignments that Gellhorn carried out for the rest of her long journalistic career well as the first women to do so, and do it well, after she split with Hemingway in 1945.

Of course meeting in 1936, meeting at time that the Spanish Civil War was breaking out, a time when people, political people had to take sides, so they did her gathering an assignment as a war correspondent and he working on the film Spanish Earth which was produced to raise money for the Republican side. As a longtime interested party in the Spanish Civil, having written many pieces about the struggle, I will add here what I have expressed elsewhere-those who fought and defended the Republican side whatever else our political perspectives from the International Brigades to writer like Gellhorn, Hemingway, Dos Passos, Langston Hughes, and the like are kindred spirits. Kudos for Spain.

Naturally in a modern romance-centered drama the romance part (okay, okay the sex part) eventually gained center stage and while in Spain for important political business they were able to finally stop dancing around each other and ruffle up the sheets. Hemingway had a little problem though he was still married his second wife. Eventually that problem got resolved by his divorce and subsequent marriage to Gellhorn. That marriage (rather than living together. lets say) proved to be a big mistake since Gellhorn had justified big ambitions to cover the impeding wars ahead in Europe and elsewhere after the defeat of the Republicans in Spain and that was a bone of contention throughout their five-year marriage. So, yes, my old socialist friends advice applies as well to the literati as well. Enough said.

Note: There are many steamy scenes (oaky, okay sex scenes) in the film between the pair (and why not with a fetching Nicole Kidman) as one would expect in a film using some cinematic license with the true story line. A recent Gellhorn biography and some of her own later comments on the men she had loved and her feelings about sex though would belie some of that torrid sexually displayed. Just so you know if you watch the film. But like I said thats what cinematic license is all about.",1401494400,,3845,4.909230769230769

Too bad Ernest didn't see that she had out grown their initial mentor-protege relationship and he didn't do everything in his power to change so she would stay.

Despite the split decision by 'real film critics' as to its 'rottenness' (at Rotten Tomatoes), the film seems relatively true to how Hemingway is portrayed in other stuff I had read or watched about him. It is an intriguing revelation of the story of a lady who suffered the abuse of this sad character who was still a gifted writer.
I do not buy into the guff of 'official critic' snobs. I do not assess films by the details of how they are made. I watch and assess on the basis of the emotions that I am left with.
This one left me aching at the idiocy that continues on our planet despite Gellhorn's public witnessing to the atrocities around this warring world in the previous generation. I watched it in the weeks of March 2014 when the situation in the Ukraine escalated into more violent killings and more worldwide sabre rattling by idiotic 'stupour powers'. Perhaps that is why, unlike all those 'official critics', I saw this movie as deep in its worth to society, no matter what the 'official critic' might have to say.",1395273600,,1195,4.588785046728972
4243673,2,B0041KKZIW,"The production values on this TV movie are impeccable; expensively mounted sets, well-crafted costumes, and a clever use of technology that integrates the modern-day actors into archive film.  This latter technique is especially good when it comes to showing Hemingway (Clive Owen) and Gellhorn (Nicole Kidman) and their involvement in the Spanish Civil War, and on their return to late Thirties New York.  The main problem with Philip Kaufman's film, however, is the plot, which does not have much to say about the two protagonists, other than the fact that Hemingway's capacity to love women was often severely affected by his obsessive masculinity.  The desire to prove himself triumphed over everything; it invaded every aspect of life, rendering him quite an unpleasant, if successful person.  Gellhorn comes across as a feisty person, but we wonder precisely why she remains so attracted to Hemingway.  Partly the fault lies in Clive Owen's performance; at no point does he come across as someone blessed with extraordinary creative talents.  On the contrary he seems petty-minded, almost babyish.  Nicole Kidman does what she can with a thankless role, but her performance remains studiously one-note.  The film is at least an hour too long; it simply makes its central point about Hemingway's behavioral shortcomings over and over again.

4243678,4,B0041KKZIW,"Here is the cinematic version of the exciting and stormy life and times of famous journalistic maven Martha Gellhorn and her lover and husband, Ernest Hemingway, as they traveled the globe in the thirties and forties in search of big events to report on. This film takes a close look at how she got into the business of becoming a celebrity reporter who was attracted to capturing human suffering on paper. While she comes across in this film as a bit of a free-spirited adventurer in search of fame, hers was an honest quest. She quickly made her mark in the Spanish Civil War and the Chino-Japanese conflict as a writer who had an unique angle on world affairs: civilians in war. Complicating her life was her six-year fling with Ernest Hemingway, that famous boisterous, womanizing buccaneer of war columnist cum popular novelist. They met in the Florida Keys, again in Madrid and married in Cuba in 1940. The one feature in their lives that gets stressed repeatedly is their shared passion for action, danger, and intrigue. This docudrama stresses both the irrepressible macho in Papa and the seductive charm in Gellhorn. What a torrid fling was theirs; what a savage parting of the ways. Hemingway betrays his new wife by unceremoniously stealing her job. Forever afterwards, Gellhorn worked her career to erase any memory of her relationship with Ernest. While this film doesnt reveal anything new about Hemingway - still ever the uproariously lusty old drunk - it does provide some interesting insights into modern warfare and the use of propaganda to win the hearts and minds of the people. As the action runs out and there are no more battles to report on, we see the old mans gusto turn to despair and angst.

HBO brought back actual film clips from some of the wars of the early part of the 20th Century, blending in Hemingway and Gellhorn as if they were actually there.  This procedure was well thought out and well carried out.  I learned that Martha Gellhorn was considered the best woman war correspondent of her time.

4243732,2,B0041KKZIW,"""Hemingway & Gellhorn"" recounts the love affair and tumultuous marriage of writer Ernest Hemingway (Clive Owen) and trailblazing war correspondent Martha Gellhorn (Nicole Kidman) as it follows the adventurous writers through the Spanish Civil War and beyond.  The combined magnetism of Hemingway and Gellhorn ushered them into social circles that included the elite of Hollywood, the aristocracy of the literary world, and the First Family of the United States.  As witnesses to history, they covered all the great conflicts of their time.

The first-rate performance by Kidman can't save the movie from its soap-opera script as Martha increasingly endures the jealousies of her husband.  Owen's portrayal is unfortunately inconsistent.  In some scenes, he is seductive, in others kind of silly.  Perhaps this is director Philip Kaufman's way of humanizing Hemingway, but we never get a solid handle on who, really, this literary giant was in real life.  The film's first half, which takes place during the Spanish Civil War, is strong, with outstanding production design despite the fact that the entire picture was filmed in Northern California.

4243733,4,B0041KKZIW,"I have seen Hemingway and Gelhorn harshly criticized for its production values, in particular the integration of old newsreels into the footage, which is hardly a revolutionary idea. The integration of ""old film"" white streaks into both old and new footage does look artificially similar but generally it works.  All the more jarring, then, is when some apparently real images from 1930s China are shown yellowish brown (instead of purplish black like the rest of the old and fake old footage), with obvious cutouts of two characters gliding eerily across them. It's positively amateurish.  But generally the production values are high.

The big problem with this movie is the gender stereotyping.  Hemingway is extremely macho about everything, whether it's hard drinking with his Cuban hangers-on, reeling in fish, charging uphill holding a gun when he's supposed to be just a journalist, and throwing venerable come-on lines at every pretty woman he meets (even though he's always married to *somebody*). Surely Hemingway's character was more complex? Martha Gelhorn (or Nicole Kidman) seems to believe that being a war journalist requires constantly slamming her liquor glasses down on the bar, slapping all the guys hard on the back, and literally swaggering, but on the other hand she shamelessly uses her sex appeal and whenever necessary, the deed itself to get whatever she wants. The film implies Gelhorn was a dilettante who seduced Hemingway just so she could tag along on his assignments, and that he provided most of her motivation to actually write (as opposed to enjoying the excitement of a war zone) as well as all her training in technique. This is not true and Gelhorn's career long outlasted Hemingway's. Then there are scenes like Hemingway and Gelhorn having sex for the first time while the hotel they are in is being bombed, the bedroom window is shattered, stuff is flying all over the place . . . come on, any sensible person would dive for shelter under the bed and pray.

Hemingway and Gelhorn isn't a great film but it's not a terrrible one, as a piece of fiction.  Just don't mistake it for a documentary.",1365292800,,2136,4.985955056179775

It desperately needs editing. Perhaps it could have been saved by an editor who cut all of the long, drawn out, meaningless scenes from the film, but I'm not sure what would have been left.  As it stands, I have no idea what this film is really about, or why anyone would care.  As another reviewer put it, a couple rich snobs dabble in some wars and each other.  The dialog is trite.

The acting was horrible, the lines were cheesy, the drama wasn't real but reeked of the ""drama"" you would find in a dimestore romance novel targeted at single old women with cats. Characters? More like caricatures. Hemingway is portrayed as a bamboozling on-the-surface drunk with phony bravado, which does a great disservice to who he actually was. Gellhorn is portrayed as a woman who ""has something to prove"", but under the surface of that ""something to prove"" she relies heavily on Hemingway, who pretty much rapes her in the film, and of course... Gellhorn likes it. Such a horrible portrayal of the real Gellhorn, who was more than capable of standing on her own without Hemingway, and of whom, a Journalism award is even named after. Not to mention the disgusting aspect of the film, that seems to glorify what seemed to be well.... rape, under the guise of ""male aggression that turns women on"". Horrible, horrible movie.",1365033600,6,1089,4.706806282722513
4243736,1,B0041KKZIW,"""Hemingway and Gellhorn"" should have been amazing. It's produced by HBO, based upon Ernest Hemingway's relationship with his third wife Martha Gellhorn. It has a very talented cast including Nicole Kidman, Clive Owens, Parker Posey, Rodrigo Santoro and Tony Shalhoub.

All the ingredients are there. And yet... it fall completely flat. Instead of a passionate story of two intelligent, adventurous writers whose lives briefly intersected in marriage, we get a flabby tale of a two obnoxious rich Americans who dabbled in important wars when they weren't warring with each other.

Martha Gellhorn (Kidman) first encountered Ernest Hemingway (Owens) at a bar in 1936, where he was showing off a dead marlin he had caught -- and after trading poorly-written quips, she is invited to his home where he hangs out with various friends. She is inspired to go to Spain to cover the civil war that is happening, and it turns out that Heminway is also going there, helping his friends shoot a documentary about the war.

During their time in Spain, they quickly embark on an affair, despite Hemingway being married to his second wife Pauline (Molly Parker). After he divorced Pauline, they later married and embarked on a new life together, traveling and changing the world with their writing -- his novels and her war correspondence. But their relationship was not destined to last.

It's hard to put your finger on exactly why ""Hemingway and Gellhorn"" doesn't work as a movie. But one important factor is that the true story of Gellhorn and Hemingway has been ""Hollywoodized"" -- the story has been stripped down, squashed into a mold, and dropped in a misshapen, bland form into our laps.

For instance, the true Martha Gellhorn was already a war correspondent when she met Hemingway. In this film, she's an idle rich girl who is inspired to BEGIN her career because of Hemingway... presumably because the writers couldn't imagine an independent woman connecting to a man unless she ""owed"" him somehow.

It's directed in a rather flabby, unenthusiastic style -- the entire sequence in Spain drags on forever, leaving you wishing that they would go ANYWHERE else. And the entirety of WORLD WAR II is somehow trivialized into just something for the feuding spouses to write about. There's no excitement, no passion here.

The dialogue tends to be trite (""They'll be reading me long after you've been eaten by worms!"") and the ""romantic"" scenes feel hideously shoehorned. Example: a weird scene where Hemingway basically molests Gellhorn backstage at their movie premiere.

It also doesn't help that both Gellhorn and Hemingway are depicted as being obnoxious people -- both come across as wealthy, condescending snobs who alight briefly on the oppressed before going back to their lives of privilege. And the movie has a thinly-veiled contempt for Hemingway's second wife Pauline, apparently because she was a Catholic, wasn't an artist, and dared to disagree with her husband's politics.

Kidman easily gives the best performance of the movie, both as a gravel-voiced, elderly woman and a fiery blonde war correspondent. Too bad her forehead appears as immobile as marble, though. Owen gives a decent enough performance, but honestly he just seems to be going through the motions -- and given that Hemingway appears to be nothing but a caricature, I can understand his lack of enthusiasm.

""Hemingway and Gellhorn"" is proof that you can have all the ingredients of a brilliant movie, only to have it fall completely flat. Kidman's performance is about the only thing worth seeing.",1364947200,6,3571,5.078498293515358
4243737,3,B0041KKZIW,"""I do not see myself as a footnote to someone else's life."" During the beginning of WWII Martha Gellhorn (Kidman), a war correspondent meets the legendary writer Ernest Hemingway (Owen). While working together to report what is going on they begin to fall in love. The romance not only inspires him to write For Whom The Bell Tolls, but also exposes his flaws and Gellhorn makes history. I know just about nothing about Hemingway, I know the basics. He was a great writer who wrote many classics and killed himself. After watching this, as far as history goes I don't now much more. I say that to tell you that this is not a typical bio-pic. The movie deals much more with the romance then Hemingway's actual writing. I didn't realize what a jerk he was and I don't know if that's true but he was certainly portrayed as one in this movie. The two main actors did a fantastic job in this but the movie itself was very up and down. The beginning and end was good and interesting but the middle tended to drag and was hard to stay focused on the entire time. If I knew more of the actual history of him it may have been more interesting but it was a little slow in parts to me. Overall, I did enjoy this and it is worth watching but make sure you are in the mood for it. I give it a B.",1364256000,,1282,4.194331983805668

Especially interesting to me is the historical account of the making of Key West, the Spanish War, life in China during the Japanese invasion, and World War II intrigue. All of it is conceptualized in the life of Hemingway and ""third wife"" Gellhorn, making it better, and more improbable, than fiction.

8412867,4,B0041KKZIW,"Well, I didn't dislike this movie as much as so many others, basically because the history behind this relationship (if it's true) and more saliently, the history of Martha Gelhorn as a war correspondent was completely unknown to me. Basically, I thought Clive Owens as Hemingway was truly fabulous and NIcole Kidman was just remarkable as Martha Gelhorn. Not that I blame her, truly, the pressure to reamin gorgeous at all costs must be horrific, but I find myself always feel a little distracted by Nicole Kidman's vanity as so often it seems that she's torn between being a Beautiful Movie Star and playing the character... too aware of the Botox, or the lips, or the overly perfect hairdo, and it pulls me out of the scene.  Though when she plays the elder Gelhorn, she's sensational, and the age makeup is actually genius.  Tony Shulub (I'm sure I'm spelling that wrong, sorry!) and Robert Duvall play very convincing Russians, and there are a few other wonderful performances sprinkled in.  The chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Clive Owen was fantastic on all counts and  -- with the REALLY embarrassing exception of the very first scene in the bar where they meet  -- a phony spontaneous singing of an Italian song, and the director placing Kidman's perfect ass in such prominence to the point of ridiculousness -- much of their onscreen time together after that is really solid stuff.  It's a long film, but a worthy one, in the end. And again, historically (if it's accurate) is really interesting.  Lower your expectations and just watch. Yeah, some of it feels false and forced, but a lot doesn't.  I gave it a four because I wanted to bring the average up a bit.",1523836800,2,1677,4.758620689655173

8412871,5,B0041KKZIW,"Philip Kaufman's direction and Nicole Kidman's superb acting are standouts in making this a great film. I very much like the way Kaufman created the illusion of history taking place before our eyes, the embedding of Kidman and Owen into archival footage with the filming of Kidman in both vintage-sepia toned film and color film. It's a bit hard to describe here, but anyone interested in how it was done and the effect it created should see the HBO clip on YouTube called ""Hemingway & Gellhorn: Visual Effects Piece."" I've seen a number of films set in the time period, the latest that comes to mind is Pan's Labyrinth, but none have made me feel I was inside the frame struggling to understand the action and effects of war the way this film did. I'm very grateful that the storyline so closely follows the historic reality of their lives. That is so rarely done. Being true to history generally means the audience has to accept that there is no 3-act play here. We can't fit these people's lives into the neat narrative that pleases most critics. To do so would force this film to be less than it turned out to be. There's a 1940's film (Arise, My Love) with Claudette Colbert playing a character said to have been inspired by Martha Gellhorn. It has a special romantic charm, and it follows the usual arc of romantic movies. It is fine in its own right to remake films like that, to alter the narrative to follow an arc, but this is not the aim of Hemingway & Gellhorn. Like life, it's a lot messier.

I found Clive Owen excellent in the film. Some reviewers said he overacted or tried too hard, but that's actually who Hemingway was--a person who overdid, overplayed his own role in life. Really, what man in his late 30's wants to be known as ""Papa"" to his male friends? (The nickname was one he encouraged from the age of 26 or 27 according to first wife Hadley.) Hemingway created an image for himself that helped him define himself, but also stifled his ability to grow later in life. It probably didn't help that he was bipolar according to a diagnosis made in later years. Clive Owen captures the best and worst of Hemingway, no mean feat. He really deserves more credit that he got from critics. He was superb in the role.

Right now, A Farewell to Arms (the film made from Hemingway's second novel) is available to view in Prime. The movie is referred to in the film both in the dialog and through its movie poster on Hemingway's wall. Also on Prime right now is the documentary referred to, The Spanish Earth. I can't say I've seen either, but it seems this is my chance so I thought I'd pass it along.",1519257600,4,2616,4.47071129707113
