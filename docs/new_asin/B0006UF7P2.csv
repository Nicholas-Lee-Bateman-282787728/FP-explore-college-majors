2196433,5,B0006UF7P2,I pop this on at work or on the big screen during poker parties/bbq's gives people a little feast for the eyes and sparks conversation. I love it.,1274313600,,146,4.25
2196434,1,B0006UF7P2,"I bought two DVDs of Waves Virtual Vacation series. They're Best of Bahama Beaches and Florida Beaches. They're all waste of money because they show the same scenes from the beginning till the end.

All I could see was the waves hitting the beach from one angle. After approximate 10 minutes the camera switched to another angle or another location. But basiclly it still showed the same scenes! That means, I still saw wave hitting the beaches. Once in a while I saw some trees plus the beaches and the waves. I could have made these DVDs with my own camcorder!

They're not worth buying at all.",1194739200,,596,4.5607476635514015
2196435,2,B0006UF7P2,"Unfortunately, it's boring and the sound is not great either.
Better watch it with your own music.",1190505600,,98,4.823529411764706
2196436,5,B0006UF7P2,"I came across this item by accident, bought it, and think it is one of the best investments I've ever made. This guy is a genius. If this DVD could be marketed in pill form, we'd all be stress-free. If you love Florida, and more specifically, its beaches, you MUST buy this DVD. I would never have believed that watching something on television could be this relaxing, but I do now. The scenes are nothing short of breathtaking, and the colour is just amazing. The only sounds are of the waves...no tinkling music or faux bird calls. You have the option of watching the beaches with or without the subtitles as the locations change, so if you see a scene and think you must go on your next trip south, you can see what beach the segment was shot at. Bahia Honda, here I come! To sum it up in a nutshell, this DVD is a must-buy for beach lovers, especially to 'tide' you over until your next visit.",1116806400,18,897,4.313609467455621
2196437,5,B0006UF7P2,"'Hypnotic' is the word that comes to mind. I think Mr. Voevodsky creates the best 'feel-good' videos one can find. In simple, well-chosen still shots, he shows us the best beach-beauty Florida has to offer (and that is quite a lot). Shimmering white sand and sapphire sky frame passing catamarans and graceful shore birds busily bobbing for dinner in the gently surging surf.  Only natural sounds for background and sunsets that electrify even as they soothe. No sand fleas. No humidity. No sunscreen required.  I challenge anyone to stay tense after the first ten minutes of this work of art.",1105920000,11,593,4.92
2196438,5,B0006UF7P2,"Listening to the natural sounds of the surf and sea birds with the stunning video, you get the feeling you are there...

No question this DVD will wash the stress away and put you in the remote beach zone. The images and sounds so vivid that you will be relaxing on the beach in no time and can almost feel the warm ocean waves lapping at your toes.

Like to get away to the beach but can't, start up this DVD with a rum punch and your on the beach.

Highly recommended and cannot say enough.",1105315200,8,492,4.104166666666667
2196439,5,B0006UF7P2,I popped this DVD into the player and it just stripped all my stress away!  It's the next best thing to being right there on the beach!,1103241600,2,135,4.0
2196440,5,B0006UF7P2,"If you love Florida you will love this dvd. It takes you on the beaches of Jacksonville,Keywest,Panama City and other places in Florida. Florida Beaches features some of everything gulls,boats,lighthouses and there is even a rainbow shown on one of the days. The sailboats and lighthouses are on day 5 On Panama City Beach and Day 6 on Jacksonville. The wave action is mostley the lapping kind although it seems just a little bigger on Panama City and Jacksonville. The video is sharp on this disc. The beaches of Florida look good. You can really see the blues come out in Panama City's beaches(ocean)and the whites of the waves look good. The sunsets are fabulous. Each day has a beautiful sunset. On some shots the water looks orange due to the sunset reflection. My favorites are Jacksonville and Panama City Beach but I like all of them. Make sure you go into the menu and cut on the beach subtitles it will tell you what island you are on of Jacksonville,Clearwater etc. Just like with the other waves vacation dvds this is just nature sounds no music accompinies it. This is the next best thing to being in Florida itself. I recommend the other waves vaction dvds to go with this one the Caribbean,California and Hawaiia ones. I hope there will be others done in the future.",1103155200,11,1281,4.647577092511013
8043457,5,B0006UF7P2,"The perfect DVD to fall asleep to.  So relaxing, without annoying background music like a lot of nature shows. Just the sound of waves crashing and the occasional gull...if I can't be at the beach, this is the next best thing.",1499299200,,226,4.512195121951219

8043460,5,B0006UF7P2,"Having been to the Caribbean and to Florida, there is just nothing like it for relaxing sounds and picturesque views that just take your mind away from the daily hustle and bustle of every day life.  Just sitting in a chair in the family room, watching these DVDs (on a 50 inch screen is awesome), playing some steel drum music in the background and drinking something cool with a cocktail umbrella in it just soothes away the stress.  I originally purchased these DVDs for a tropical themed party I was throwing, and had them playing on two t.v.'s upstairs and downstairs, it was very effective in creating the mood for the themed party!  We still watch/listen to these DVDs to melt away the stress of a hectic work week.  Very effective and truly a  virtual vacation when you can't actually get away for real.",1378339200,,811,4.604166666666667
8043461,5,B0006UF7P2,I love this DVD. No words. It's an auto-loop so it'll play until you shut it off. Beautiful shots and all you hear are waves (just a few gulls). It's exactly what I wanted and needed.,1348099200,,183,4.111111111111111
8043462,5,B0006UF7P2,I love this DVD.  I pop it in once a week at least.  Great to throw in when guest are over.  Very beautiful and relaxing.,1331942400,,121,3.76
8043463,5,B0006UF7P2,"Great Job , I love to watch this in my spare time when i want to take a nap. Mezmerizing. People come over and watch and want to fall asleep . If you need some relaxing sounds , here they are.",1292976000,,192,3.707317073170732
8043464,5,B0006UF7P2,"This is overall a very nice disc.  Unlike other similar discs I have purchased, there is no poorly synthesized music distracting you from enjoying the natural feel of the beaches.  The beaches are pristine and truly give one the feel of ""being there.""  The waters are luminous, the compositions are pleasing, and the photography is excellent.  I do recommend this DVD for anyone who is looking for a living wallpaper to bring a bit of the tropics into their home.

There are a few details, however, which I feel would make this video perfect.

First, the aspect ratio is for a ""standard format"" television, which means that on an HD or other wide-screen TV you are wasting a third of your viewable screen on a video which is all about the view.  This sort of video in particular would benefit from a wide aspect.  You could adjust your settings to stretch the image to fit, but the distortion this causes can be distracting.

Second, I find that there are a couple of scenes which are my favorites, and I would like to be able to loop them over and over again.  One side allows this, the other does not.  I don't like having the beach change to another one while I am in the middle of enjoying the atmosphere.  Being able to individually loop all of the scenes would be a big improvement.

Along these lines, when scenes change they are introduced with superimposed text.  It is nice having this option, but it should be just that; an option.  It would be great to be able to turn off the text.  If you have watched the disc more than once, you don't need it anymore and it interferes with the serenity of the natural scene.

Last of all, not really a criticism of the production but rather of the format, obviously it would be nice to have this sort of thing available on Blu-Ray.  Not only would the increased resolution be a huge improvement, but as mentioned above the aspect ratio would be better as well.  My eyes keep getting annoyed by the lack of resolution in the waves, the inability to see what a bit of flotsam or sea bird might be, etc.  To date, the only comparable video released on Blu-Ray by this production crew showcases Hawaiian beaches.  I do like Hawaiian beaches, but my heart is in the Caribbean.  I hope these producers make a Blu-Ray quality release containing Florida and/or Caribbean Islands beaches soon.  I will keep checking back hoping for this to happen.",1289260800,2,2388,4.52803738317757
8043465,5,B0006UF7P2,"Wow, I love this Florida Waves DVD! I also own the the Caribbean Beaches, they are both  spectacular, and sooth my worries away. I'm a big ocean lover and go to Florida for vacation a few times every year, Florida has the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen. This is great for a stressful day and when I'm inbetween trips to Florida and stuck inside on a  cold winter day. I love the white sand , breathtaking sunsets, and watching the little birds walk along the shoreline. I like turning the lights out and watching it at night before I go to sleep. My father who has a stroke  and is not able to travel to the beach alot also enjoys watching it .It has a super calming effect. All I need is a margaritta and a fan and I feel like I'm there!",1283731200,2,747,4.137931034482759
8043466,5,B0006UF7P2,"I bought this video about a week ago and have spent time with it every single day. It is the ultimate in stress reduction! I was very picky about selecting an ocean waves DVD that had lengthy shots from one location for a more authentic experience. Caribbean Dreams, with 6 loopable scenes, is a dream come true in that regard. I watched it a few times before giving The Best Florida Beaches a try, but when I finally did give it a try, I was very impressed...and relaxed! The shots, though briefer than those in Caribbean Dreams, are still soothing (not to mention, beautiful), and the cuts flow so smoothly and do not feel at all jarring. I think I like both volumes equally! I have actually turned on a fan, put a beach towel down on the living room floor, filled a basin with sand and water, and soaked my feet in the basin (while lying on the towel, of course), to have even more of a sensory experience. Voila! My living room is transformed into a tropical oasis!

I am a teacher and have environmental DVDs on in the background every day to help create a more peaceful classroom environment. This DVD is my hands-down favorite. I plan to use it a LOT not only when the children are in the room but also as a lunchtime escape, to recharge my batteries. I've wanted to find a good ocean waves DVD for a long time, and this is definitely IT.",1279670400,4,1345,4.337301587301587
