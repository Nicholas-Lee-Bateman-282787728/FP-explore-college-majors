8582785,5,B00CKUA68O,"The reviews by Zante and Amazon Customer should be disregarded. Im sorry, Zante, God Loves Caviar does indeed contain Greek and English dialogue but my copy, admittedly not purchased from Amazon, does contain English subtitles with the Greek dialogue. With all respect, Amazon Customer, this DVD played very well with my player. Maybe you do not have, as I do, a region free DVD player.

Both reviews do not criticize or mention the merits of this film.

This film is based on the true story of Ioannis Varvakis. Varvakis in life was many people, a successful businessman, revolutionary, insurgent and pirate. He contributed to the Greek War of Independence through the Society of Friends, a secret terrorist organization whose purpose was to free the Greek people from Turkish occupation. This film examines, through a series of flash-backs, Varvakis life during every stage. It is convincing staged with an international cast which includes John Cleese, Catherine Deneuve, and Sebastian Koch, who very convincingly portrays Varvakis.

This movie works well on many levels. It is a good action film, historical narrative, and human drama. You might even learn something about European history. My DVD copy was not in PAL format. ... Just to be sure you may want to play the DVD on a region free player.",1459814400,,1303,5.051162790697674
