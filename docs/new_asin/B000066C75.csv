3122302,4,B000066C75,"This colorful comedy/drama originally aired on Britain's boundary-pushing Channel 4 (home of the original ""Queer as Folk""). It was a late-night miniseries, seen in six half-hour installments in early 2001. The frenetic visual style and over-the-top characters are not for all tastes, but it's a fun show whose characters turn out to be more complicated and human than they initially seem.
This American DVD offers some great extras not available on last year's British video release. Three cheers to TLA Releasing for including the wonderful pilot episode, ""Heterosexuality,"" which in some ways I prefer to the actual series.  The making-of documentary was interesting, though I could have lived without some of the creative camera work.
TV purists be warned: this DVD does not present the series in its original episodic form.  It's featurized -- essentially a two-and-a-half-hour TV movie that hits a cliffhanger every 24 minutes. I usually can't stand seeing miniseries featurized, but in this one case it works.
The video quality on the extras (including the pilot) is beautiful. However, the DVD rendering of the series is slightly hard on the eyes -- at least it was on the copy I rented. The movement is a bit uneven -- probably a byproduct of the way they converted the video from European to American video standards.  I'm pretty sure it didn't look like this when I saw the series originally.  But after a couple of minutes, my eyes adjusted and I enjoyed rewatching the show.
The first ten minutes or so of the series are the weakest part: stick with it through the first half hour and you'll probably be hooked!",1030320000,,1623,4.955882352941177
3122303,5,B000066C75,"This is without a doubt, one of the BEST series I've EVER seen! It's creative, colorful, classy, and CORRECT! Despite what we've been fed, life is NOT black & white - there are a whole lot of gray areas, and METROSEXUALITY dares to touch on them all! The writing is extremely funny, the sets are out of this world, and all of the performances are perfect (EVEN THE GIRL WHO PLAYS ASHA) Another reviewer here noted the actress can't act, I say - maybe her acting was so right on - that's what she wanted you to believe, or maybe her character was just a typical teenage girl (whatever! and not much more!) BUY THIS ONE - and decide for yourself! Not only is the movie perfect, but it's soundtrack is AWESOME, and I'm NOT a fan of music from the U.K., but this one will make me listen closer to other BRITISH acts! METROSEXUALITY is one cool flick - AND YOU'D BE COOL TO WATCH IT! Excellent job Rikki BB!",1029283200,,902,4.280701754385965

What a wonderful show!  The characters were so interesting and I fell in love with the world they live in.  It's the way the world should be!  Bright and colorful, where love and family are the most important things, and race and sexual preference don't matter, I found myself wishing I could live there too!  I cannot express enough how much i loved this dvd and how much I thought about it after it was over.  My only critique was that I wished it would have gone on longer.

Fast-paced, colorful, eclectic cast, incredible music, and the dialogue! I've seen nothing like it, but it's hip and poignant at the same time.

And the extras on this DVD are great...Extensive interviews with cast and the creator, behind-the-scenes footage AND the amazing soundtrack album with over 15 songs on it...This is a bargain...a real treat. I can't give this a higher recommendation.

3122306,5,B000066C75,"Once you get past the heavy accent and fast talking speed, and adjust to the very, very quick editing, this is a pretty terrific series. Lots of unexpected little plot twists mixed in with the predictable ones. The acting was all-around very good, the writing was intelligent, and the cast was very interesting to look at. Thank the heavens that some cultures appreciate diversity. American TV & cinema is so ridiculously homogenized in comparison. We watched the entire series in one sitting, and loved it. It certainly evolved in the better direction from its pilot, Heterosexuality. Give this one a try. It's not like AbFab or Queer As Folk (British or American) but it
should appeal to the same audience base.",1025568000,,713,4.900826446280992
3122307,5,B000066C75,"I think the reason I loved this series so much was the fact that it was just so frenetic and unbelievable. It's believable in the sense that the characters have real emotions and act with great humanity and humour, but can I really be expected to believe that they all have such fabulous wardrobes and hair? The series centres around Kwame and his kidult, queen, dad, Max.
Kwame wants his two dads to get back together but Jordan (the ex) is seeing another guy. Meanwhile, Dean, Kwame's best friend is in love with Max and stuck in the middle of a destructive, abusive family life. Max's sister Cindy is enjoying her first weekend alone with her partner Doris in their eight years of parenting and can't stand the sudden silence. The guy who works at the skate park, owned by Max, is an immature, fun-loving punk man who can't commit to his 18 year old boyfriend Bambi (also friends with Kwame and Dean).
  Then there are Gerry, Tal, Lola, her dad, Kwame's girlfriend Asher, her best friend Jaye, and others. If that's not enough characters to make your head spin, you must be a god. The series never settles down and is fast paced until the fnal, climactic episode of the six part mini-series. Every moment is packed with witty dialogue and fabulous hairstyles. It's funny, it's political and best of all, unlike most queer TV shows, IT'S NOT PREACHY!
  Of note, also, is the music. Composed for the series, it fits seamlessly into the action and the characters even burst into song every once in a while. The credits are different for each episode and highlight major themes to come. It's like getting a little taste of the batter before the cake's been cooked. And it is good.",1025481600,,1679,4.605351170568562
3122308,4,B000066C75,"Bought this disc because the marketing claimed it was a cross between AbFab and QaF.  I like both those shows, so I took a chance.  Wow!  Six 23-minute episodes spliced together with opening credits shown once only, it plays like a feature-length movie and that's fun.  Overall, I was most impressed with the surface of the production.  The costumes and, in particular, the hairstyles are, well, absolutely fabulous!  Since watching it myself, I've cajoled three other guys (2 gay & 1 straight) on separate occasions to sit down and watch it with me.  Each of them liked it a lot.  As for myself, after 4 viewings, I'm not ""metrosexed"" out--I'm sure I'll easily watch it another four times.  This 2-disc set has quite a few worthy extras, including the original pilot episode.  Nice bonuses!  It's fast, fun and has a moral center tucked underneath all the eye candy!  Enjoy!",1025049600,,875,4.798657718120805
3122309,1,B000066C75,"First off let me say that I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this. Queer As Folk with a black slant and set in an area of London that I know well seemed more than promising.
In reality I couldn't feel more letdown!
On the plus side it looks original, has a frenetic pace that sets it apart from other shows and has a heightened sense of fantasy that is very appealing.
On the down side it has some of the WORST acting that I have ever had the misfortune to suffer through and before you ask, yes I have seen Madonna in The Next Best Thing!!
The girl who plays Ashe is totally and utterly wooden in every single scene. It gets so bad that you dread her appearance because you are just waiting to cringe at her inability to deliver ONE single line convincingly. At one point she is required to sigh mid-line and I SWEAR that you can literally see the coggs whirring behind her eyes thinking ""ok this is where I sigh"". She is THAT bad.
She is not the only culprit. The other lesbian in the hair salon is pretty bad, as is Ashe's father(although working with Miss Wooden 2002 probably killed off any hope he had!!) and the American girlfriend in the main lesbian couple seems to have a problem deciding whether to worry about her accent or act. Clearly she can't manage both.
This could have been so much more and had the potential to be a camp OTT joy. There are some good performances and nice moments. Some of the dialogue is very very funny and spot-on. Sadly it is let down by abysmal performances and the casting director for this show should change his career out of total shame for inflicting such awful performances upon the public.
With the number of actors there are in the UK, there is absolutely NO excuses for acting of this standard to make it to screens.
If you want good gay-themed drama then stick with the UK and US Queer As Folk shows and avoid Metrosexuality like the plague!!",1024963200,,1889,4.354107648725212

Both his male best friends are sexy young white queer boys.  His girlfriend is hot too.  Her best friend is an Asian lesbian with a Latina girlfriend.  The parents get as tangled up as the kids.  The scenes are short and at times you have to try to stop laughing just to keep up with the pace.  It's wonderful, celebratory and very Millennium!

This DVD moves along at a very fast pace and it gathers you up and carries you along with it.

The acting is pretty good, the story is interesting in a soapy kind of way, the gags are good if you like English humour (and who doesn't) and the whole thing comes together as a great experience.

Oh!  If you are American, you probably won't understand a word they are talking about.  Thick ""East Ender"" accents prevail.  At the speed it's delivered you'll spend a lot of time working out what was just said, and while you ponder this, you'll miss the next gem.

The imagery is fantastic with such depth and imagination that you get [drawn] in right away.  The characters are all priceless and intertwine into each others lives in a larger than life whimsy that isn't too far off from reality.  This is a show that truly addresses every type of person, situation, and sexual preference.  The cast is beautiful and very talented.  The score is fantastic, flowing with the mood of each an appreciation for living life to it's fullest.  Davie Fairbanks (Bambi) from the show is radiant and is already finishing up his next film that scene and raging with energy and attitude.  The Director/Actor/Singer/Songwriter (and so much more) Rikki pulls this all together and ties it up with a virtual satin bow that makes you want to watch it time and time again.  It leaves you eager for more and gives you I'm sure will be a Sundance hit.  Rikki's name is sure to be world renowned once everyone gets a whiff of his creativity and directive genius.

Whether you want gay or straight, black or white, comedy or drama, you'll find it here.
