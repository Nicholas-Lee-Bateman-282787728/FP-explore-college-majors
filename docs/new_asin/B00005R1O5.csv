Maybe they were reviewing the case? If you liked Peyton Place or anything Tenesse Williams, you will like this one. And yes, Tina Louise is stunning in it but who knew Jack Lord was so damn hot back in the day? You won't recogize Michael Landon for a while (at least I didn't).It's a good story & well worth the [...] I paid.",1235779200,7,468,4.043010752688172

I watch all old movies I can find on TV.  Gods Little Acre, was one I had never seen on all the old movie channels even after all these years.
So finding it on amazon was great.  I really enjoyed seeing it again.  I will watch it more than once.",1233705600,,421,3.727272727272727
1652681,3,B00005R1O5,"Released in 1958, Anthony Mann's God's Little Acre caused a scandal in theaters and was even banned in many places.  Now 50 years later, the DVD format lets viewers see what they may have missed.  In 1930s rural Georgia, Ty Ty Walden and his family live on a farm, barely scraping by.  Ty Ty was told by his great grandfather there's gold buried on the farm, and he's convinced it's still there.  Helped out by his sons, he's been digging for 15 years without luck.  The gold story serves as a jumping off point for the rest of the story, the relationships and dynamics of Ty Ty's family.  Directed by Anthony Mann, this is a beautifully shot movie, in more ways than one, as the story of the Walden family develops.  The relationships are real, the love and hot believable as Ty Ty tries to find the gold while also continuing to be able to live.  It's not a well-known movie, but it's an enjoyable movie, if for nothing else than to see what all the scandal was about.  It seems tame compared to movies now, but you can see why it caused a stir.

 In what's really an ensemble cast, Robert Ryan gives one of his best performances as Ty Ty Walden, the family patriarch trying to keep his family together, all the while searching for his great grandfather's gold.  Ryan pulls off the dramatic and comedic scenes equally well throughout, especially the scenes with the cross on his farm's God's little acre.  Aldo Ray plays Will Thompson, Ty's son-in-law who's been out of a job for six months since a mill closed.  Will married Ty's daughter Rosamund (Helen Westcott) but really loves Griselda, married to Ty's son Buck.  They have a history together, and it's their scenes together that caused a stir upon the movie's release.  Tina Louise of Gilligan's Island fame shows off what a good actress she is in her first movie role as Griselda, the beautiful wife of Buck who still has feelings for Will.  Mann puts Louise on display throughout, and she looks more beautiful here than any of her Ginger Grant days.  Jack Lord and Vic Morrow are very good as Ty's sons, Buck, the jealous husband who worries his wife doesn't love him, and Shaw, the younger son still growing up.  Buddy Hackett has a funny part as Pluto Swint, a local man running for sheriff who's fallen in love with Ty's youngest daughter, Darling Jill (Fay Spain).  Also worth mentioning is Michael Landon as Dave Dawson, an albino who Ty is convinced will lead them to the gold.

 The DVD doesn't have any special features, but the movie looks great in a widescreen presentation, Ernest Haller's cinematography never looked better.  This isn't a great movie, but it's positives heavily outweight the negatives.  So for a good story with great performances from Robert Ryan and Tina Louise, check out God's Little Acre!",1221264000,26,2784,4.634693877551021

1652685,4,B00005R1O5,"What could be funnier than the premise that God has his own little plot of land (doesn't it all belong to him?) which keeps getting moved around to make way for yet another fruitless dig looking for gold where none has ever been found. Set in the old (1920's-30's)poor south, poor farm owners dependent on their share croppers working their farm which provides them all a living because the resident farm owners are too lazy to farm and too busy digging for gold, the property is all pot holed from past digs and God's cross that indicates his ownership keeps getting moved around when the patriarch of the family gets a new inspiration where to dig and it is usually right where the cross has been relocated. Lust and greed, longing and jealousy, violence and avarice, faith and hope, all in one story. Erskine Caldwell was a great writer, this and Tobacco Road are hoots, great actors star in this flick. Of course it is slightly sanitized from the actual book but it's still pretty faithful to the story line.",1171152000,11,1012,4.627777777777778
1652686,5,B00005R1O5,"Perhaps one seeing this film for the first time, in this day and age, will not realize just how racy this picture was when it was produced (in 1958). I watch it now, and I still can't believe that they ""got away with it"". The picture, a yarn concerning a Georgia hayseed family, took the ""Ma And Pa Kettle"" concept to new heights!
The gist of the story is that Ti-Ti, and his strapping sons, are digging for his pappy's gold, which, legend has it, is buried somewhere on their Georgia farm. They've been digging in the ground for fifteen years.....and haven't found anything yet. The characters seem, to me, to be the basis for the Clampetts on the Beverly Hillbillies........especially Darlin' Jill (who surely was the model for Ellie Mae).
The picture includes one of the hottest forbidden love scenes to ever be committed to celuloid (between Tina Louise and Aldo Ray). This was back in the days when things had to be creatively SUGGESTED (to avoid censorship). Things are different today, when anything goes and a ""love scene"" is thrown in for mere titillation, showing yet another improbable, sexual acrobatic endeavor between two participants. This scene between ""Griselda"" and ""Will"" has actual BEARING on this story. Those were the days.
It might seem quite campy (it is!). It certainly is hilarious, and even tragic at times. I recommend ""GOD'S LITTLE ACRE"" highly!",1075161600,60,1374,4.8760683760683765

Here's the problem: while the movie looked promising, especially the eye-bulging appearance of Tina Louise in her flimsy night gowns showing showing off her unbelievably beautiful breasts to best advantage, the volume track on my DVD was just too low. Granted, I'm hard of hearing and have to rely on subtitles to get everything (sadly missing on this product),but I actually had to turn my TV's volume setting up to 100, and still I couldn't make out what the actors were saying. If the volume were better so that I could understand what people are saying, I'd love this movie. It's a visual treat, with a great performance by Robert Ryan, but no good when you can't hear it.

1652772,5,B00005R1O5,"I recently purchased three movies starring Robert Ryan; they included Bad Day at Black Rock, Men in War, and this gem. Robert Ryan definitely has to have been one of Hollywood's underrated actors. He has turned in a lot of satisfying performances; as the prickly Col. Breed in ""The Dirty Dozen"", Gen. Grey in ""The Battle of The Bulge"", the murderer Reno Smith in ""Bad Day at Black Rock"", and perhaps his most unusual role as Ty Ty Walden in this movie. As the patriarch of the family, he has searched for gold on his farm for fifteen years, letting his once prosperous cotton fields go to seed, and huge deep holes! To compound matters, his daughter Darlin' Jill (Fay Spain), is making a play for any guy she fancies, including the old horsehead Pluto Swint (Buddy Hackett), who is running for sheriff, and Dave Dawson (Michael Landon), who plays the albino who is kidnapped by Ty Ty to help him find gold. Also adding to the tension is his son Buck's (Jack Lord)problems with wife Griselda (Tina Louise), as she is attracted to Will Thompson (Aldo Ray). One of Ty Ty's workers, Uncle Felix (Rex Ingram), continually tells him how his efforts are tearing his family apart, and that he should go back to farming to ensure his family's long term survival. When released in 1958, this film created quite a stir, as it cast southerners in a negative light, along with some racy scenes involving Tina Louise and Aldo Ray, and also Fay Spain and Buddy Hackett. It is amazing to see how things have changed between now and then. This movie is actually quite tame by today's standards. If you like Robert Ryan, this movie is a great addition to anyone's collection, and is really in a class by itself.",1342310400,5,1693,4.590759075907591
1652773,3,B00005R1O5,"The Geneon release from 2005 is not the Pan And Scan aspect ratio listed in the production details. It is instead a 1:85 Wide Screen aspect ratio, and the pristine print, restored by UCLA, is presented in its uncensored 118 minutes. However, and unfortunately, it is NOT ANAMORPHIC, so if you have a big Flat Screen, you're in for a big disappointment: you'll get a nice widescreen image surrounded by a lot of empty black space. Unforgivable for such a ""recent"" re-release. I suppose that explains the low price. I have no idea if the original DVD release on Image Entertainment is anamorphic, but to my great surprise, all of Image Entertainment DVDs I've purchased as far back as 2001 fill my entire 55"" flat screen. I guess we'll have to wait for Criterion to do this one justice though it will be a pricier disc.

As to the film itself, it's not for everyone. It is a satire on old time religion with a cast of rather unpleasant characters, and though it's beautifully restored, the print tends to look kind of inky most of the time. In its day it was considered ""daring"" by some and ""salacious"" by others. By today's standards, however, it is quite tame. An unexpected turn by Anthony Mann, a director known principally for his 1950's majestic Westerns and 1940's tough film noirs.",1338422400,6,1287,4.644736842105263
1652774,4,B00005R1O5,"'God's Little Acre' is a likeable Southern-gothic Depression-era drama, full of eccentric characterizations and occasional over-emoting (not unsuitable to the genre) from a melting pot of recognizable actors, all brought vividly to life by one of the most interesting directors of his time, Anthony Mann ('Raw Deal,' 'Winchester 73,' 'El Cid').  Note, though, if you're on the fence about picking up Geneon's bare-bones 2005 release, that Amazon's reporting of a 1.33:1 framing is inaccurate; the print appears to be the same in terms of picture quality (from the UCLA Film and Television Archive), running time (118 mins.) and aspect ratio (1.85:1) as Image's 2001 version (also currently out of print but much pricier).  4 stars each for content and presentation.",1324339200,7,765,5.366666666666666

1652779,5,B00005R1O5,"For a longest time, I've wanted to see this film. When my dream came true, I was, of course, quite impressed with it. Original erotic tone of the Caldwell's novel was soften for this screen version, though overall atmosphere tranfered well for the motion picture for us to feel the southern heat and passionate lives of a Georgia farmers.

Robert Ryan plays Ty Ty, the obsessed gold digging patriarch who almost led his family members to a total tragedy. Here, Ryan proves himself as an effective stage actor (He really was an active stage actor also.) by demonstrating a powerful, almost caricature like portrait. He diffuses character's laughter, anger, sorrow and regret with a perfectly balanced emotion through out the film. Some thought that the role of Ty Ty was not suitable for Ryan who used to play dark characters with serious intensions, but probably nobody could play the role better than him, because from many prospects, Ty Ty is a quite complex figure. It is so unfair to think that Ryan was never nominated for Oscar with his great performances from the great films like THE SET-UP, ON DANGEROUS GROUND, CLASH BY NIGHT, INFERNO, MEN IN WAR, ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW, BILLY BUDD, THE ICEMAN COMETH or this.

Neither director Anthony Mann got no reputation for directing GOD'S LITTLE ACRE. Many saw him as an effective Western director, but he was more than that. He respected F.W. Murnau and loved Greek mythology. His sense of scenery and dramatic way of expressions are no comparison to the others. He saw the action was prominent way for effective story telling. He put every creativities to GOD'S LITTLE ACRE that the film actually possesses pure pictorial beauty of the southern land, remarkably intelligent tragicomedy flair, full of actions with symbolism, and the deep observation of human nature. No wonder Mann considered this as the one of his best works. We really have to remember and respect that.",1265932800,2,1924,4.935185185185185

1652781,3,B00005R1O5,"Erskin Caldwell (1903-1987) was hardly in the same league with William Faulkner or Tennessee Williams, but like both those authors he drew his tales from the sordid side of southern life--and in the process created two novels that had unexpected popular resonance: the 1932 TOBACCO ROAD and the 1933 GOD'S LITTLE ACRE. Both presented remarkably trashy portraits of rural southern farming families steaming with depraved sexuality, coarse humor, and nasty habits. Southerners were outraged by the portrait, but to their chagrin the wider world took the books as gospel truth. TOBACCO ROAD was a massive success first as a novel, then as a play, and finally as a film--but GOD'S LITTLE ACRE, published on its heels (and partly due to several high profile censorship cases) would go on to become the single best-selling novel of all time, a position it would hold until 1966 and the advent of Jacqueline Susann's VALLEY OF THE DOLLS.

Although the book is actually tame by today's standards, Hollywood didn't dare consider it until the production code began to crumble in the late 1950s--and even then no mainstream studio would touch it. Even so, the film is surprisingly competent in a technical sense, well directed, well acted, and receiving superior production values. No fewer than three Oscar-worthy individuals were involved in the production: screenwriter Ben Maddow, who was nominated for the THE ASPHALT JUNGLE; cinematographer Ernest Haller, who was nominated on seven occasions and received the award for no less than GONE WITH THE WIND; and composer Elmer Bernstein, who received a total of eleven nominations and received the award for THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE. Although director Antony Mann was not quite in this league, he was nonetheless a notedly compent director, and the cast included no less than Robert Ryan, Aldo Ray, and a host of rising stars including Tina Louise, Jack Lord, and Michael Landon.

Even so, it is still GOD'S LITTLE ACRE and there's nothing that can be done about that. Ty-Ty (Robert Ryan) is a farmer who has spent fifteen years digging for gold (a treasure is said to be buried on the farm land) instead of tilling the soil. In consequence the family is dirt poor. His son Buck (Jack Lord) has married sexy Griselda (Tina Louise, with plenty of cleavage crammed into thin dresses); his daughter Rosamund (Helen Wescott) has married Bill Thompson (Aldo Ray.) Trouble is that Griselda is hot for Bill and he for her, and both Buck and Rosamund know it to their sorrow. And then there is daughter Darlin' Jill (Fay Spain), a three-alarm slut crazy for just about any man she can get out of his pants, including the albino (Michael Landon) Ty-Ty kidnaps because--well, it's a long story. Add in a subplot about closed mills and the union movement, a whole heap of longing gazes, and dialogue about grits and pork fat and there you are, right in the middle of GOD'S LITTLE ACRE.

The first fifteen minutes or so are actually superior in a technical sense. Bernstein's score and title song are memorable and quickly snatch you into the opening sequence of Ty-Ty and his sons digging for gold, interrupted first by Griselda, interrupted second by visitor Pluto (Buddy Hackett), and then a burst of memorable scenes: Ty-Ty's explanation about ""God's Little Acre,"" eating watermelon in the kitchen, the decision to kidnap an albino, and a very amusing and naughty incident in which Darlin' Jill forces lustful Pluto to pump a little cool water into her outdoor bath. But thereafter the film goes wrong.

The basic problem is that everyone in the story is a half-wit with a funny name, and in between bouts of half-witted stupidity they sit around and lust over each other in a down home on the farm sort of way. The story is too ridiculous to be taken seriously, but that is precisely what everyone connected with the film does; it soon becomes ponderous and then commits the unforgiveable sin of being dull. In the end, we're left with a bunch of people we think should be locked up lest they reproduce. They sit around all the holes in the farm land and wonder what went wrong. So too do we. Even so, it's better than the badly written book; casually recommended on that basis and for the score and cinematography.
