Those who have never viewed any of this type of material won't be able to appreciate the rarity and volume of footage here as it does not 'hand hold' the viewer with that level of explanation of its source and origin, but those who have studied these events will immediately recognize it's value.

There is a great interview with the late Roger Craig that is a must see.",1280880000,8,617,4.63302752293578
8271708,1,B00192T8K6,"An outfit called ""Conspiratus Ubiquitus"" produced this 6-part, 10-hour video documentary entitled ""Evidence Of Revision: The Assassination Of America"".

Part 1 of the program focuses on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, while relying heavily on the use of archival news footage from November of 1963.

And after just a very few minutes, I could tell that my initial suspicions about the JFK section of this documentary were going to be accurate -- it is a shameless propaganda piece, designed to sway the thinking of people who have not studied the evidence in the case in any depth at all, and to also mold the thinking of individuals who have not seen all of the uncut, as-it-was-happening network television coverage from the day of John F. Kennedy's murder (November 22, 1963).

The point at which I knew my initial suspicions about the program had been confirmed beyond all doubt is the point when we see some TV footage from the morning of 11/22/63 at the Chamber of Commerce breakfast in Fort Worth.

At one point during this Fort Worth footage, the television announcer tells the viewing audience all about the circumstances surrounding the 1901 assassination of President William McKinley.

And just before the announcer begins talking about McKinley's assassination, these words are flashed on the screen by the documentary filmmakers --- ""Preparing The Public Mind....A Pause....Then He Begins To Read....""

Now, I can't see any other way to interpret those words than this way:

The documentary filmmakers were actually suggesting that the TV announcer's comments about President McKinley's assassination were part of some kind of plot or conspiracy in order to ""prepare the public"" for the so-called ""cover story"" about Lee Harvey Oswald being the lone gunman in the assassination of President Kennedy, which is an assassination that would be taking place later that day.

What other conclusion could I possibly come to after reading the filmmaker's caption -- ""Preparing The Public Mind"" -- on the screen at that precise moment?

But to imply that the TV announcer had advance knowledge of JFK's assassination (which was still more than three hours away when he made those comments to the television audience about McKinley's murder) is simply reprehensible and completely irresponsible on the part of the documentary filmmakers.

Now, maybe the filmmakers had some other ""innocent"" reason or motive for placing those words (""Preparing The Public Mind"") on the screen at that exact moment when McKinley's assassination was being discussed, but I certainly cannot think of any other reason for doing it--other than to embed in the minds of the viewers something that is totally ludicrous and ridiculous -- i.e., the notion that the TV announcer (or someone connected with the television coverage that aired live on the morning of 11/22/63 from Fort Worth's Hotel Texas) had some kind of advance information that the President was going to be killed later that day.

And then a little later in the documentary I saw former Dallas Deputy Sheriff Roger D. Craig pop up on the screen (via several clips taken from Mark Lane's video&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Two-Men-In-Dallas/dp/B000NHDFBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Two Men In Dallas""</a>). At that point, my opinion about this particular documentary went downhill even more (a lot more).

Because for anyone to place any faith whatsoever in what Roger Craig had to say about anything connected to the events of 11/22/63 is to place your faith in a known and provable liar. And he lied about some pretty important stuff in Mark Lane's ""Two Men In Dallas"" video, too. No question about it.

Craig's biggest lie, of course, was when he said he saw the words ""7.65 Mauser"" stamped on the rifle that was found on the sixth floor of the Book Depository. The rifle that was found was actually Lee Harvey Oswald's 6.5-mm. Mannlicher-Carcano, of course. And several rifle experts agree that the rifle being handled by Dallas Police Lieutenant J.C. Day, as seen in the film taken by WFAA-TV cameraman Tom Alyea just after the rifle was first discovered, is indeed a Mannlicher-Carcano, not a German-made Mauser.

Roger Craig's ""7.65 Mauser"" lie is so blatant, and so outrageous, that for any reasonable person to believe anything else uttered by that lying evidence-mangler would be for that person to admit that he was taking the word of a known liar at face value.

""Evidence Of Revision"" does exactly what many conspiracy theorists accuse the various ""lone assassin"" documentaries of doing -- it picks and chooses its content very carefully, so that it conveniently leaves on the cutting room floor the many, many hours worth of network television coverage from November 1963 that vividly illustrate exactly the OPPOSITE conclusion from the one that the ""Revision"" filmmakers wish to convey.

From a video or audio standpoint, the best way to get a clear and unbiased view of the facts surrounding JFK's tragic murder, in my opinion, is to not rely on any single documentary film or video, but instead take the time to watch (or listen to) all of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/UNCUT-and-UNEDITED-television-and-radio-footage/dp/B001GE2CGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">UNCUT and UNEDITED television and radio footage</a>&nbsp;that exists from the day President Kennedy was shot and killed.

And when watching the uncut TV/radio coverage, in combination with the knowledge that ALL of the physical evidence that exists in connection with the murders of both JFK and police officer J.D. Tippit points to only one person (Lee Harvey Oswald), the overall picture of the true events of that day becomes quite clear -- namely that the assassination of John Kennedy was an assassination carried out by ONE PERSON (Oswald) who fired THREE SHOTS from a single weapon coming from ONE LOCATION (the Texas School Book Depository).

Anything else is just pure speculation (and, in the case of many things uttered by Roger D. Craig, are just flat-out lies).

As of this writing, I have not watched the other five parts of the 6-part documentary (which all deal with things other than the JFK assassination), but if Parts 2 through 6 are anything like Part 1, I'd wager to say that ""Evidence Of Revision"", in its entirety, is pretty much worthless.

8271710,5,B00192T8K6,"This is the best available because it shows actual footage - no leading, no narration - just the facts of the events as they happened!  They also show things that do not get mentions anymore or that some who were there may have forgotten.  This breaks it down to the point where there could be no doubt that it was a conspiracy.  It also shows events from every angle.  It must have taken time to put this together.  If you want to know the true facts without waiting another 25 years, this is it!

It is also sad that the ""History"" Channel had to counter this as they stole every ounce of this underground documentary execpt of course that parts that show conspiracy.  The only thing THC adds is alternative footage, but there special is all about proving that Oswald did it.  When using REAL footage and REAL wittnesses, it is VERY hard to deny the true facts of the murder.  The ""History"" Channel's version is an out right theft of ideas.  The fact that THC had to copy - but change the theme around goes to show how POWERFUL this video is.",1255305600,13,1043,4.357512953367876
8271711,5,B00192T8K6,"Composed of hours of compelling news footage with minimal commentary, arranged in chronological order, including some documentary interviews, this 6 DVD set is convincing evidence that nothing in America is as we think it is, and hasn't been for a very long time.

At the end, there is an unbelievable audiotape interrogation of one of the witnesses of the Kennedy assassination who was ""convinced"" by her interrogator to change her story.  It will make the hair on your head stand on end.

If you don't believe psychopaths rule the world, think again.  Evidence of Revision is Evidence of Pathology in high places.  So highly recommended that I wish I could give it ten stars!  You will NOT be bored!

8271712,5,B00192T8K6,"This is one of the best documentaries I have seen on the subject of the JFK assassination, because it goes beyond the ""event"" itself and uses rare archival media footage to put the pieces of the puzzle together. A picture emerges that is very ugly... that there was a coup in this country the day JFK died, and that criminal syndicate has been running the country ever since. This is not a Democrat vs Republican thing. Both parties are bought and paid for. By eliminating JFK (and RFK) they could carry out their agenda for world domination and immense profits... What followed was Vietnam (which had more to do with the heroin trade and war profiteering than communism), Watergate, funding of Mujahideen to create Afghan War, CIA drug running, Iran-Contra, Panama Invasion, Gulf War I, Serbia-Bosnia, 9/11, Iraq-Afghan Wars of Terror, Patriot Act, etc.

The same criminal syndicate was involved in all of these things. Another great new film on this subject is ""Core of Corruption"".

8271713,5,B00192T8K6,"You will see hours of news reel footage that has not been shown in decades. As an example: While being led through the Dallas PD Jack Ruby tells a reporter that if Stevenson had been VP the Kennedy ""tragedy"" would not have happened.  When the reporter asks why Ruby tells him he needs to ask the current occupant of the Whitehouse (Johnson).  Clips of reporters commenting on all of the ""threats"" to Kennedy in Dallas.  News footage of the mayor of Dallas (whose brother was fired as Dep Dir of CIA along with Dulles) talking about not pointing fingers.
  An outstanding collection of unfiltered news of what some would call a coup.  Having watched dozens of ""documentaries"" on these subjects in the past I can't figure out why these hours of critical clips were left out.  Also has major coverage on LBJ, RFK assassination, Jonestown, and Hoover.  For a balanced view of these subjects you'll be hard pressed to find a better collection at such a low price.
  History buffs won't be disappointed if for no other reason than it contains hours and hours of news footage that has been tucked away.  These presentations do not try and come to conclusions, they leave that open to the viewer.
