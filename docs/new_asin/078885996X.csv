I wasn't aware Jim had died before the making of this film, so it takes on more significance. I'm buying a copy so that when  I get down I'll watch and have my spirit lifted. Great job Brian.",946425600,,283,4.1454545454545455
177562,5,078885996X,"This Muppet film was the first one made after Jim Henson died. I can still remember the reluctance I felt at seeing it because I was afraid that it would not live up to the past. However, I was pleasantly surprised and  charmed by this wonderful and hilarious adaptation of the Christmas classic  by Dickens.  My two favorite characters, Gonzo and Rizzo, help keep the  audience's interest by mixing classic narration with comic slapstick. Those  two have the best chemistry in the film!  Michael Caine is excellent as the  embittered Scrooge, and I love the songs and the other Muppet creatures.  Although I cannot help but watch it with a sad heart, I know that somewhere  Henson is looking down on this Christmas Carol and smiling proudly.",945302400,2,742,4.7795275590551185
177563,5,078885996X,"Every year I pull out my copy of this movie and watch it, and every year I am reminded how much I love it and how wonderful it is. Even as I write this I'm watching it and starting to cry as something else touching happens  in it. There is no better reminder of the wonder of Christmas than this  wonderful, delightful, charming, splendid version of Dicken's classic tale.  See it, no matter what. :...)",944870400,,403,4.346666666666667
177564,5,078885996X,"Charles Dickens' masterpiece ""A Christmas Carol"" has been endlessly dramatized, adapted, rewritten, parodied, musicalized, folded, spindled, and mutilated to the point that it has nearly become just a  Yuletide ghost story.  Oddly enough, THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL brings  greater depth and humanity to the story than many recent versions.  The  story stays quite true to the original while allowing the Muppets to get  laughs by staying true to their established characters.  It might seem like  a strange combination, yet it plays beautifully. Michael Caine makes an  superb Scrooge.  His performance is on target all the way through, as he  subtly finds the hardness, cynical humor, pain, and ultimately, the joy for  life that's within Scrooge. And he automatically accepts the Muppets as the  various Dickens' characters, never letting on to the audience that it's all  a charade. THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL is a curiosity, in a way, but it is  also truely a treasure suitable for the whole family.",944524800,8,1004,5.226415094339623
177565,5,078885996X,"Easily the best of the Muppet movies, I can only second the literature professor's comments. Dickens would very probably have liked this version of his story too.  Michael Caine plays the part straight and with an  intensity that suggests he had waited for the chance to play Scrooge for  some time. If Alistair Sim was a light hearted Scrooge and George C Scott  was bluff then Caine is deadly serious - which only gives the Muppets the  proper foil to work their humour from. As Jim Henson once said, the best  guests to have on the show are the ones that can treat the Muppets like  actors. The humour is great, the songs and storyline touching. Great for  kids of all ages and I am grateful to it for the line: 'You are SUCH an  idiot!' which I use often.",942710400,9,759,4.364285714285714
177566,5,078885996X,I saw this movie when I was in the fourth grade and my best friend and I still watch it every Veterans Day to start off the holiday season. It's  tradition. Everyone should buy this movie.,941414400,2,188,4.222222222222222
177567,5,078885996X,"Well, this is one of the very few movies that has had this 24-year old crying his heart out, not just once, but everytime I re-watch it!
Particulary the ""Love is gone""-song, where the young Scrooge  chooses a career in business before love, and the incredibly moving speech  by Kermit in the christmas-yet to come-scene: ""It's alright, children.  Life is made up of meetings and partings. I'm sure we'll always remember  Tiny Tim as the first parting that was among us.""
I also felt that  this movie really gives alot of insight into the character of Scrooge, and  why he's become the way he is, like in the first of several masterful Paul  Williams-songs:  ""There's nothing in life that freezes your heart like  being alone...He's really a wictim of fear and of pride, look close and  there must be a sweet man inside.""
And the scene with Scrooge as a  child, all alone in the schoolroom on Christmas Eve really gets to me, with  the now grownup Scrooge commenting on his lonely childhood: ""I was  often alone as a child. The christmas holiday was just a time to get some  extra work done"".
Of course, this movie isn't just sadness and  melancholy, but I felt it's important to mention this as you might not  expect that from a muppet movie. It's alot of fun as well, of course,  particulary with Uncle Sam as the Headmaster: ""You'll love business,  IT IS THE AMERICAN WAY...oh, sorry, IT IS THE BRITISH WAY!""
And  Gonzo/Charles Dickens and Rizzo the Rat make a terrific story-telling  couple, providing comic relief and downright slap-stick humour, and some  very insightful comments on the nature of story-telling in general, and  their source material in particular:
""Gee, this is scary stuff,  should we be worried about the kids in the audience?"" ""No, this  is culture!""
""Great story, Mr. Dickens!"" ""Thank you.  if you liked this, you should read the book!""",911347200,10,1863,4.746875
177568,5,078885996X,I never have been a muppet fan but was encouraged to watch this movie in any case. I am glad I did! Very enjoyable and heart warming! And I will be adding to my annual Christmas viewing from now on!,1521417600,,198,3.975

177598,3,078885996X,"Watching this each Christmas has been a family tradition since I was little and I just love it! Michael Cane is an amazing Scrooge and the hilarity of Gonzo...ahem, ""Mr. Dickens""... and Rizzo narrating balances out the book's drama perfectly! The only reason I'm giving this a poor-ish review is because the powers-that-be decided to take out the song Scrooge's fiancee sang when he was with the Ghost of Christmas Past. I LOVED that song as a kid! I could sing it now for you, if you asked me. It was beautiful and heartbreaking,... exactly what that scene was SUPPOSED to convey! We looked it up and it seems some idiot thought that it would lose kids' attention so they edited it out. Unfortunately, we bought the digital copy and didn't know that, so we were rather unpleasantly surprised at the omission. At the very end of the movie, during the happy ending, the whole cast sings an updated version of the song called ""The Love We Found"" but you have no idea why because they took out ""The Love Is Gone"". Disappointing!",1519344000,,1025,4.60655737704918

Ive loved it since I was a kid, and Im glad to have it on DVD now! The Muppets are as amazing as ever, Michael Caine is a fantastic Scrooge, and this is one of the few (if not only?)

We decided to just rent it and watch it, and I was appalled at the number of edits in this version.  Why?  Yes, the movie and some of the songs are a bit cheesy, but it's the Muppets, for god's sake, and it's a cheesy TRADITION in our little family, that Disney has trampled on.  Not only is Belle's song completely gone from the film, but Scrooge doesn't join in with The Ghost of Christmas Present when they're singing in the streets.  That's the first real sign of Scrooge's reclamation in this version:  when he lets go of his tightness and does a little song and dance.  I feel like I'm living in George Orwell's 1984.

177655,5,078885996X,"This is a great version to buy. The song ""When Love is Gone"" on it! One of the best Christmas movies ever made! Disney needs to stop trying to ruin it by omitting one of the most crucial scenes/songs in the movie. Michael Caine is probably the best Scrooge I have ever seen. I think Dickens would be proud! However, the Christmas Carol was meant to be light and serious, which is something Disney fails to acknowledge when they strip the widescreen version of a crucial moment in Scrooge's redemption when they strip Belle's goodbye song. Since the emphases on the loss of Scrooge's sister and the other darker parts of the novel are omitted concerning Belle, it is important to create a little more depth and empathy in the scene with Belle. As a result, Disney attempts to rob the movie of the true understanding of the importance of our decisions.that Dickens's novel offered his readers.",1514937600,,891,4.681528662420382

177723,5,078885996X,"Review of The Muppet Christmas Carol
Hot Toasty Rag, December 1, 2017

In my house, we watch The Muppet Christmas Carol every Christmas Eve. When Kermit the Frog sings the song One More Sleep Til Christmas, we cuddle together and sing along, knowing that Santas on his way and the next day is the most special day of the entire year. My parents told me that when this movie was released in the theaters, it didn't do well, but I cant seem to believe it. How can one of the most adorable versions of A Christmas Carol, one that remains one of our all-time favoritesand weve seen every version known to mannot be treasured by everyone in the world?

Paul Williams wrote the memorable and lovely songs in the film, and when Miles Goodmans music flows during the opening credits, it instantly puts the audience in the mood for Christmas. The cast is announced, and as Kermit the Frog is listed as Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy as Emily Cratchit, and other well-known Muppets and human actors are credited, the best is saved for last. Michael Caine gets the and in the credits; he plays Ebenezer Scrooge. Hes truly heartwarming in the film, playing the iconic role as a sensitive man. While other versions of the story portray Scrooge as unwaveringly mean until the memorable ending, Jerry Juhls fantastic script shows Scrooge affected by the early scenes.

The Great Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat speak to the camera in the opening scene, introducing themselves and the story. Theyre the continuous narrators of the film, and the running commentary is absolutely hilarious. Too many of the lines from Juhls screenplay have become household phrases in my family for me to list, but there is one part that is worth mentioning. When the Ghost of Christmas Future appears, there is the usual ominous setting. Gonzo and Rizzo remark how spooky it is and tell the little kids in the audience that they're going to leave and come back when its not scary anymore, which is not only a considerate warning but is kind to the kids who choose to hide their eyes so they don't feel embarrassed. When the Muppets reappear, they say, Were back! We promised we would be! Every time I used to come home and greet my kitty, I said that phrase.

Theres really too much perfection in this movie to keep my review short, but Ill try to keep it relatively brief. The sets and costumes are beautiful and look very authentic. The smaller rolesSteven Mackintosh as Nephew Fred, Meredith Braun as Belle, and the incredibly cast Raymond Coulthard as Young Scroogeare lovely and put just as much of their hearts in their performances as the main leads do. And the songs, which Ive already praised, somehow make the listeners hearts lighter and spirits brighter. In It Feels Like Christmas, the production number started by the Ghost of Christmas Present and continued by the ensemble, Michael Caine actually dances along as his Christmas spirit is rekindled. The back-and-forth rocking is forever known in my house as doing the Michael Caine and its a dance move we love to imitate. Speaking of the Ghost of Christmas Presenthave you noticed that sometimes this jolly spirit isn't always nice in other film versions? In The Muppet Christmas Carol, hes incredibly sweet and caring.

If its at all possible you haven't seen this version, buy a copy. I guarantee itll become a staple in your household during the Christmas season. Whether you watch it the first night you put up the tree or wait until theres only one more sleep til Christmas, itll be one of your favorite parts of the most wonderful time of the year.",1512086400,,3572,4.717948717948718

That seems to be my role in his life, scaring him one 90's movie at a time (last year's pagemaster dvd was also scary but now he loves it).His Mother however was thrilled and loved reliving every comical memory and singing along.

177864,5,078885996X,Great movie. Classic Christmas tale with that wonderful Muppet style. This particular DVD gives you the option of the old style screen and the wide screen version. We watched the wide screen this time (watch it every year as part of our Christmas tradition) and noticed it was missing one song. Although I never cared for the missing song I found that it created something of a gap in the continuity of the character development of Scrooge. Not a fatal flaw but it just felt like something was missing. Kids will never notice it.,1483833600,,529,4.638297872340425

177894,5,078885996X,"Honestly one of my favorite Christmas Carols. I don't like the spooky, depressing Christmas Carol stories (yea, I know that's how it was written but still).

There are small little bits of comedy that really bring the mood of the story up. And who doesn't love the Muppets?!

Michael Cain is the perfect Scrooge to me.  He's a superb actor and really lends to the story.

This is a great way to share the Christmas Carol with your children because even the Ghost of Christmas' Future isn't super scary (just a black cloak).",1483315200,,523,4.591397849462366

I KNOW, RIGHT? Awesome. Michael Caine (pronounced: ""my cocaine"") plays the whole movie straight, like there's nothing strange at all about the fact his clerk is a frog and the rest of the townspeople are bears and chickens and things. Gonzo is a masterful story teller as Charles Dickens, and suddenly the rest of his works seem...incomplete...without back-and-forth banter with Rizzo behind the scenes. The music is great, the casting is great, the jokes are great...this movie just gets better every time you watch it.

Sub-note: this version is edited...the theatrical version had another song - not sure why they cut it since it's kind of the main theme in the credits. There are also additional songs on the soundtrack that it appears were never in the movie - if anyone knows of a version with ALL of these in there, I'd be mighty happy to learn of it.

177949,5,078885996X,One of our family's favorite holiday movies. It is a reasonably faithful adaptation of Dickens (with the usual Muppets silliness thrown in). Highly recommended.,1482796800,,160,5.708333333333333
177950,5,078885996X,"Prior to reading the reviews of this film, which is head and shoulders above the rest my favorite Christmas movie, I had no idea how or why so many people could give the film one star. Then, I read, and became incredibly amused. Folks, the film released was done so in its entirety. If Disney released the film theatrically, and the film contained on this disc aligns with that release, than it is the full movie. Four minutes of a film that end up on the cutting room floor, that were included in a Laser Disc copy, does not mean that this version was cut or that parts were left out. It would be like saying that you weren't going to buy Star Wars because the film left footage of some of the original characters out (which was in turn used in Rogue One).

Let's talk about the fact that the film as it was released is an utter classic. For those saying that the loss of this one song constitutes a movie that is only 75% complete need to go back to school and learn math (85 minutes versus 89 = 95.5% of the ""full move"" [I use quotes because the four minutes were never included in the film to begin with). It is a song, that before the advent of ""Super Special Editions"" or ""Limited Editions"" or ""Exclusive Editions"" or ""Extended Editions"" no one would have known existed. Let's view the movie as it is, a classic, that tells the story in a unique way (Gonzo and Rizzo breaking the fourth wall is just fantastic) that has never been replicated.

Five stars.",1482796800,,1461,4.328467153284672

I praise the set design and atmosphere, though I notice that I feel the film is only a 'decent' Muppets film in that it tries to focus more on telling the story than being funny. I'm mixed on Michael Caine's performance as Scrooge; while he doesn't think that his performance is bad, he does show a lot of passion while he's singing some of the songs (even if he's not the best singer) and that he does have the proper threatening look for the part, I feel that he doesn't quite capture the emotional turmoil that the character goes through in the story, especially in the scene where he finally breaks down and changes his ways. In the end, though, it's a film that the whole family can enjoy. I give this movie a 7 out of 10.",1482624000,,811,4.342105263157895

177987,4,078885996X,"This is our family all time favorite Christmas movie. A lot of reasons contribute: faithfulness to the original Dickens text, full British human cast, integration of Muppets humour, well told storyline, as well as fabulous music.

We own the DVD version of this but also wanted the Amazon video to be able to watch anyplace. The DVD version contains both the Theatrical version shown in theaters and the uncut version (widescreen) which includes the most essential scene in the film, an important song that ties together the music and story for the whole film. The song ""The Live is Gone"" becomes the song ""The Love is Found"" at the end of the film. On the DVD we only ever watch the widescreen. The theatrical version just doesn't fully make sense and it leaves us all feeling incomplete.

This version in Amazon Video does not have the option to view the uncut version, and the entire family was very disappointed. We still love this movie but we all wish the widescreen uncut version would be available.

This is the only Muppet movie that isn't over-the-top silly. It is so well done, a real tribute to the Muppet Creator Jim Henson, and to the original Dickens work.

The part in Scrooge's past where Belle sings to him ""The Love Is Gone"" is a pivotal scene in which the viewer witnesses the change in Scrooge's heart, where he feels the remorse of his actions, and grieves.  The viewer grieves with him, as he curses the shadow of his younger self for being such a fool.
Now, when it shows the scene of Scrooge saying ""I do love you"", and Belle responding with ""you did once"", instead of the song, it cuts to Rizzo the rat sobbing in empathy.

178053,2,078885996X,"This is my favorite version of A Christmas Carol. Sir Michael Caine is brilliant, and the songs have strikingly beautiful lyrics.

I would give it five stars if they hadn't cut out ""When Love Is Gone."" (I am reviewing the Amazon Instant Video version.)

Without that song, the artistic integrity of the film falls apart. I know, I'm taking a Muppet movie very seriously. The reason given for removing the song was that it was ""too sad for kids."" I watched it as a kid. I cried. I still cry if I really get into watching this scene. That's not a bad thing. Heartbreak is sad. From this scene forward, Scrooge's journey is to heal his broken heart, and to lift the audience up with him. The emotional arc collapses without this song.

It makes no sense that Rizzo and Scrooge are quietly observing one second, and sobbing the next.
Caine's amazing performance comes off as overacting, when you take away the song.
The Ghost of Christmas Present's entrance has no impact, because it no longer contrasts with the previous scene.
Present's song makes no sense: the message ""wherever you find love, it feels like Christmas"" is no longer a direct response to ""when love is gone.""
The finale has the same problem: ""when love is found"" has no resonance as a reprise of ""when love is gone.""
Taking out this song just destroys the plot. In the original, the past serves to break Scrooge as he relives the tragedies in his life (absent father, dying sister, bad break-up). The present shows him the joy he's missing, now that his heart is open to emotion. The future takes that open heart and shows him he's not the only one who suffers, that selfishness prolongs the suffering eternally whereas charity and compassion heals.

You've got to break Scrooge, but you've got to break him as a human to whom we can all relate. Disney, when you re-release this movie intact and whole, it will be a huge money-grab. DO IT. TAKE MY MONEY. You insult Dickens and Henson's memory by butchering this film.",1481673600,26,1982,4.622159090909091

This song is crucial to the film and the character arc of Ebeneezer Scrooge. This song not only shows the reason for why Scrooge has given up on relationships (he fears rejection and loss of love again), but the next scene makes absolutely no sense without it! The studio cut this scene because they thought that it would bore children. However, I grew up watching, and loving this movie! In fact, it was the only muppets movie I actually enjoyed. Children understand love and loss. Children are not as shallow as Disney Studios would believe, and out of all the production companies, I am most shocked that this one would be the one to edit for emotional content given their track record of highly emotional films.

178105,5,078885996X,"I have collected fifty-eight film versions of A Christmas Carol on DVD and VHS, released in every decade since Thomas Edison's Film Manufacturing Corp. released its version in 1910. They fall into three basic categories:  1) The ones I cannot stand and only keep for the sake of having them in my collection 2) The ones I rarely watch, but recommend to others to watch. 3) My favorites, which I watch every Christmas season, sometimes more than once.

The Muppet Christmas Carol falls into the third category. It incorporates the charm of the Muppets with original song and dance routines in a frame narrated by Charles Dickens, played by Gonzo.  Michael Caine excels as Scrooge, in my favorite role I've ever seen him play.

I have a basic version, and a 50th Anniversary Edition (Fifty years of Muppets and being Green, starting with Kermit in the '50's - no liberal slant there, [tongue in cheek]). Both versions have a commentary track by the Director, Brian Henson; Pepe Profiles Presents Gonzo; Christmas Around the World; and a blooper/gag reel.

178143,5,078885996X,"Director Brian Henson presides over this delightful 1992 retelling of the Charles Dickens classic--the first Muppet movie since the passing of his father, Muppets creator, Jim Henson two years earlier.
  I've thought of how, in childhood I fantasized about all my favorite characters merging under Disney's auspices, and found my self amusingly satisfied at that concept becoming a reality.
  Here, we see our favorite Muppet characters decked out in Victorian garb as Paul Williams' spry score contributes to the bustling Christmastide atmosphere.
  We find The Great Gonzo as Charles Dickens(Dave Goelz) hawking fruit with Rizzo the Rat( Steve Whitmire) in 1840s London as the former begins his narration.
  Soon, the lively atmosphere darkens as the central figure of this tale rounds a corner en route to his office.
  As Ebenezer Scrooge,Oscar winner Michael Caine clearly enjoys his interaction with the felt figures, and  there are many comical, warm, grim and tragic moments to relive on the miserly moneylender's road to redemption.
  Kermit the Frog (Whitmire) is Scrooge's loyal clerk, who whose fellow clerks are rats. Steven Mackintosh plays Scrooge's nephew, Fred, who invites his stiffly reluctant uncle to dine with him, and sees the first moments of Scrooge's  meeting with the charity organizers, played by Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker(Goetz and Whitmire), but leaves before its unpleasant ending.
  The office's atmosphere changes after Scrooge departs, leaving his employees to close shop and go home for Christmas.
  At his own house, Scrooge is confronted by the ghosts of his deceased partners, Jacob Marley and  his brother Robert(Goelz and Jerry Nelson), the latter of whom was added  so Statler and Waldorf could have some screen time, who warn him to change his ways, and that he will be visited by three spirits.
  The first of these is an ethereal child(Jessica Fox, Robert Tygner), who takes Scrooge to revisit his past and shows him his younger self (Raymond Coulthard, Russell Martin, Theo Sanders, Kristopher Milnes, Edward Sanders), as the twig was bent, but omits any mention of his unhappy family life, and his reunion with his sister, Fan.
  Instead we see the influence of his headmaster Sam the Eagle(Frank Oz) on his behavior, and as a young businessman(Coulthard), we see how he is too caught up in worrying about expenses to enjoy the Fozziwig's(Oz and Nelson) Christmas Party, presided over by Animal(Oz) and bandmates.
 But he meets a lovely young woman named Belle(Meredith Braun), and then we see how a promising relationship fizzles because she realizes that money will always be more important to Scrooge than love, and she does not have a lifetime to wait for him to change. The song, ""When Love is Gone"" has been cut from the DVD and televised releases.
  A pained Scrooge, left to grieve over past mistakes, encounters the Ghost of Christmas Present(Don Austen) shortly thereafter. Escorted out into the  world amid the glorious Christmas hubbub, his spirits lift for a while as he sees people enjoying themselves, but then feels alienated as he watches his nephew, Fred, and niece, Clara( an perpetually smiling Robin Weaver, who is probably the most accurate looking of all the actresses who have played Fred's wife) playing a parlor game with friends, and finds the joke to be at his expense.
  Then he his shown his clerk, Bob Cratchit's house where Miss Piggy's(Oz) Mrs. Cratchit is preparing the meager feast with help from her son, Peter(David Rudman) as Bob returns from church with ailing son, Tiny Tim(Nelson) in tow.
  Scrooge learns the direness of their predicament and sees Mrs. Cratchit's ire at his insensitivity towards the suffering of others.
  Soon it is time for the jovial giant to leave Scrooge's side, and make way for the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come(Don Austen, Robert Tygner).
  The most grim of the three spirits frightens both Rizzo and Dickens to the point where they duck into a church as the last part of the tale unfolds.
  A business associate of Scrooge(Whitmire)  is seen discussing the death of an unknown businessman, whose possessions end up in the unseemly custody of the tarantula, Old Joe(Rudman) a rag and bone collector.
 Soon he revisits the Cratchit House, whose atmosphere is now more solemn, and Scrooge learns what his own fate will soon be.
  A contrite Scrooge awakens and hastily begins to amend his ways and amid a tuneful outcome, reconciles with those whom he neglected or rejected just a day earlier.
  This smash hit  is a great way to introduce the very young  to the Dickens classic, and it must have left initial viewers with the satisfaction that Jim Henson's legacy was in excellent hands.",1466726400,,4706,5.0532467532467535

Once again, Disney has chosen to butcher the film.  It would have been very easy for Disney to include the song, or to make a menu choice of ""with"" and ""without"".

178363,4,078885996X,"My mother and I watch this movie every year come December.  I had this on VHS, but since those players have gone the way of the dodo bird, I bought the instant video version on Amazon.

Much to my horror, I found that the most beautifully bittersweet and poignant song in the film, ""When Love is Gone"" was cut from this version.  While certainly not Amazon's fault, I still have no idea why Disney would chose to cut this song.  I read a blog that said a Disney exec cut it for pacing reasons so that kids would not lose interest.  With all due respect, I WAS a kid when I first saw the film, and have watched it every year since it was first released, and I never lost interest when that song played in the film.  Certaintanly my understanding of what that song truly meant for the movie as a whole has evolved as I've grown older.  The movie seems incomplete without it, especially when they sing a happy reprise of it at the end, but now there's no context for the transformation of Scrooge and why the new lyrics would mean anything.

4 out of 5 stars because of the cut song.  Again, I know it's not Amazon's fault, but if a new version of the film is released which again includes ""When Love is Gone"" there is an opportunity for Amazon to make it right and let their customers who have already bought the film have the full version instead of having to buy it again.",1448668800,,1372,4.246153846153846

178376,3,078885996X,"My review will not address whether a song was included or not.  My review will be based on what I felt in the theater when I saw it in 1992, and what I felt when I saw it, recently.
  First, no matter what my other opinions are about the movie, it's a well done, family friendly Christmas movie, which should be watched and enjoyed by the masses.
  Strictly, strictly, strictly on a personal level, I'm a purist.  Once Mel Blanc (and any original writers) were gone, production of any new Bugs Bunny and Looney Tunes characters and cartoons should have ceased, in my opinion.  Similarly, any Peanuts production or strip without Charles Schulzt'es direct involvement is not truly a Peanuts production, ""to me"".  And so, and I repeat...""for me"", The Muppets ended with Jim Henson's passing.  Henson's creative touch was missing from this movie, his voice was missing from various Muppets, and the absence of Richard Hunt (who was the puppeteer of my favorite Muppet, Sweetums) makes the movie very hard to watch.....""for me"".  Even back in '92, it was hard for me to watch Statler and Waldorf.  When I first heard them, not knowing Hunt had also died, I thought, ""Wait...that's neither Statler ""nor"" Waldorf!""
  Given the above, and had this been done during Jim Henson's reign, I do believe the Ghosts of Christmas should have been tried and true Muppets (Maybe Sweetums as The Ghost of Christmas Future, etc...).  And, the Muppets seemed to take a back seat to Michael Caine...as though they were now only supporting players.  That added to my 1992 grieving over the loss of Jim Henson.
  It is kind of a darker Muppet movie, which also added to it almost being sad, ""to me"".  I'm focusing on the negative, as I see it, but still recommend the movie.  I just have a certain way of viewing things.
  I recall, in '92, sort of wondering aloud to Jim Henson, how he'd have done the movie.  Who knows.  But, for what it's worth, it kind of abruptly popped into my head that he would have had Kermit in a different role, actually accompanying Caine as Scrooge as went on his journey through time...offering the potential for more entertaining dialogue between the two, and making Kermit an equal co-star.  As it stands, the movie seems almost too rigid in it's adherence to Dicken's prose.
  I'm not really into musicals, so missing songs don't bother me.  I fast forward through most songs in any musical.  Usually, only one stands out.  I'd have preferred Christmas songs.
  Still, to the average viewer, I say this is a movie worth owning, watching and recommending.  It's just not ""my"" personal taste.",1448150400,,2600,4.721603563474387
178377,5,078885996X,"I love this movie it's one of my favorite versions of a Christmas Carol.  To those who are complaining about When Love is Gone being removed from one of the version out there, I feel your pain this is one of my favorite songs in the movie.  I was given this video one Christmas years ago and that scene is my favorite.  Turns out though what I didn't know and what many of you may not know when the film was in theaters that song was cut from the scene it is featured in.  That's right apparently the production thought it dragged the scene out which was something I don't agree with.  I thought this was a very powerful and beautiful part of the film.

178411,5,078885996X,"A great take on Dicken's story. The format is perfect as Gonzo and Rizzo guide us through old London and the transformation of Scrooge. All the best Muppets are there, and all shine. Miss Piggy is magnificent as Mrs. Cratchet and the cameo of Fozzy-bear as Mr. Fozzywig is a pearl. The film is ideal for children as it remains faithful to the original, it is also a treat for adults as it blends wit with first-class puppetry. The most important thing about this movie is that the best representation of Ebeneezer Scrooge in any film is done by a man playing against puppets. I love the Scott version (w/ Edward Woodward), and think the 30s version is passable. But Michael Caine gives us all of Scrooge we could ever hope to learn about in the Christmas Past visit to the school. She says, ""Let us see another Christmas,"" and there's a slight twitch in his eye before he says, ""They were all... very much the same."" I applaud his performance in this movie, and the movie that comes to life around him. Exceptional.",1438128000,,1015,4.521739130434782

Pros

1. The ending was awesome.

2. You finally get to see Robin in a muppet version of a story in more parts.

3. Rizzo is still in this.

4. You finally learn about Scrooge's past.

Cons

1. There does not have to be a human as a main character.

2. Why the hell did the Electric Mayhem Band barely appear in this?

3. This line( with a glass raise to toast your hell) is not supposed to be in this movie.

4. There is barely any humor.

5. Mouses is not a word.

Michael Crane is, unsurprisingly, an amazing Scrooge, able to evoke both hate and empathy with his portrayal of the character. The unique muppets for the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future, are superbly crafted to convey the desired tones of their given demesne.

178623,5,078885996X,"It's odd, but even with Alasdair Sim, Patrick Stewart, George C. Scott, and others putting out virtuoso performances as Ebenezer Scrooge, Michael Caine in a Muppet movie equals the best of them!

The songs are heartfelt and catchy, the pacing is excellent, and the comedy/drama mix is set perfectly. Brian Henson directs from a concept from Jim, and somehow it all comes off spectacularly.

I watch this film as part of our family Christmas-movie viewing each year. It never gets old!

The Muppet Christmas Carol gets my highest possible recommendation. Five stars!",1418428800,,565,5.119565217391305

178626,5,078885996X,"Though I personally don't care for the song ""When Love is Gone"", I had to title this review with it because some folks seem to be losing their minds over this.  I just watched my brand new copy a few days ago and I watched the non-widescreen version.  Alas, the song is there and that's the only part of the movie I fast forwarded ;).

This is one of my all-time favorite Christmas movies.  As a devoted Muppet fan, I think they did a great job on this movie.  Gonzo and Rizzo are priceless as narrators.  Michael Caine is a wonderful Scrooge and the music is sweet.  A note for parents, though, the movie is a little spooky at times.  It's still too scary for my 8 and 6 year olds to watch, since they don't like movies with ghosts in them.  That's their choice, though, your kids may be more tolerant.  The ghostly characters played by Statler and Waldorf aren't scary themselves, but the scene leading to their arrival is suspenseful and dark.  The ghost of Christmas Past is also a bit spooky, as a cloaked character with no face.

I still watch it several times every Christmas!",1418083200,,1083,4.386934673366834

178657,5,078885996X,"I first watched this movie when I was at my grand mum's house. I was getting better from having a fever. I liked it so much that on one day when I was practicing my piano and I wasn't feeling well when my renowned respite Jen Limmer used to live at Mary's house (Mary is her mom and my other renowned respite.) long before neighbors decided to live downstairs. By the next couple of years, I rented it at the public library and after that, I watched it on Netflix. This was my first movie when I started admiring Sir Michael Caine. (Then after Secondhand Lions in 2010-11, my admiration grew gradually.) I popped the DVD in and they backed up everything from the 2005 dvd. A lot of people are so disappointed that the song ""When love is Gone"" was omitted. When I received my copy, I've got nothing to worry about other than the fact I was relieved that this one also got the full screen extended cut. I assume that Rizzo and Scrooge wept because Belle just ditched young Scrooge and the relationship wasn't going well. After watching it on Netflix, I then wanted to add this to my other children's movies in French & Italian. It was a hard decision to make but while this was in transit, I was worried sick about not having the extended full screen cut. Then I realized, I'm not worried about that anymore.",1416441600,,1306,4.378600823045267

It is an adaptation of the original to fit in with the Muppet characters available - it wouldn't get you ready for a Lit exam - but it captures the essence of Dickens in a way that some other films don't.  We have been watching it as a family in our  ""run up"" to Christmas for  years, since our children were small,  we are virtually word perfect;  lines from it have crept into family catchphrases ( ""thank you for making me a part of this""  and ""light the lamp not the rat""  - watch it and you'll see why!!!) Lovely songs too!  There is something for all the family - just watch out for the Ghost of Christmas to Come - very little ones might need a cushion or parent to hide behind for a couple of minutes!

178726,5,078885996X,A wonderful Christmas film for kids of all ages. Great way to introduce the wee ones to Dicken's classic tale. My son and I have watched this almost every Christmas since he was a toddler - he's 20 now and we still enjoy it. Michael Caine is more charming than alarming as Scrooge . . . and any peril is mild enough for even the youngest kids. The Henson folks throw in enough adult humor to keep the parents amused while the kids enjoy the Muppets. The kids will watch this over and over - you'll get your money's worth out of this DVD.,1401926400,,537,4.173076923076923

178728,1,078885996X,"This is one of my favorite Christmas movies. I bought it because I was traveling abroad and knew I wouldn't be able to find it for the holiday season. It's an edited version from the original (which was not stated in the description). There are parts that I love that were missing. I believe it is a tv version, and edited to fit in a time slot. But if it's not the whole movie, then why would I want it? I was very disappointed.",1401148800,,429,4.119047619047619

178733,5,078885996X,"This movie is by the best telling of the beloved Christmas movie! It is, often depressing, but thanks to the muppets it is lightened up & U still get the same message. I would recommend this movie 2 everyone of any age.....its not Christmas in my house if we don't watch this movie!!!",1398643200,,284,4.377358490566038
178734,4,078885996X,"For whatever reason this widescreen version has cut out that poignant portion where the song ""When Love is Gone"" is performed by Belle and Scrooge. I can only surmise Disney did it to save a few bucks on royalties. That's typical for them...... Upon further thought maybe it was done because it added nothing to the plot, and the 3-minute scene may seem boring to small children.",1398384000,,379,4.6716417910447765
178735,5,078885996X,"More fun than the classic version, and a little less scary than the original.  The extra humor and the Muppet's nostalgia make this movie one of our seasonal favorites.",1397692800,,168,4.793103448275862

178737,5,078885996X,Watching A Christmas Carol every year is a family tradition from my childhood that I shared with my children and still try to keep with my grandchildren. I've watched all the different remakes of Charles Dickens classic story. My all time favorite was the 1938  film until the Muppet rendition came out. It now reigns as our family favorite. The tradition continues just with different stars.,1397174400,,392,4.9393939393939394
178738,5,078885996X,OMG what kind of person could actually go a Christmas without watching The Muppet Christmas Carol? Even my kids love this classic.,1397001600,,130,4.954545454545454
178739,4,078885996X,"An Oscar winner playing opposite The Muppets, in a classic story written by Charles Dickens. The idea of casting Michael Caine as Scrooge, cold-hearted employer of Bob Cratchit (played by Kermit the Frog!) may not appeal to you, but it works. Frankly, I was not impressed with the songs very much (I almost forgot to say this is also a musical), but Brian Hensons The Muppet Christmas Carol is a funny and surprisingly touching re-telling of the classic story.

In the film every player, Caine especially, takes the story of Ebenezer Scrooge very seriously. Michael Caine, then about sixty years old, plays the role straight, talking to Kermit and his nephew Fred (played by Steven Mackintosh) in the same way. He and beloved Muppet characters fit in the Victorian London, always slightly dark except the final act. Had he played his role self-consciously, the magic of the films original world would have been lost.

Released only three years after the death of Jim Henson, The Muppet Christmas Carol has been a unique and charming interpretation of the famous tale. Delightful (but sad when it has to be), The Muppet Christmas Carol is a success both as a Muppet feature film and a Charles Dickens rendition.",1396915200,,1210,4.897560975609756
178740,5,078885996X,"The only Muppet thing I really like.
I REALLY like it. I've watched it several times and still laugh.
The rest of the Muppet movies don't do much for me.
This one is a keeper.",1396656000,,175,4.0285714285714285
178741,5,078885996X,This has to be my all time favorite Christmas movie.  We watch it every year as a family.  It's so well done and probably the best Muppet production ever.  Each of the different Muppets fit each character perfectly. It's as good as the book and better!,1396483200,,252,4.434782608695652

178745,5,078885996X,"The Muppets do a great job! Yes, this movie is rather old but it's still a good one! Even though it's not Christmas anymore, it's still a good movie to watch. Teaches a good lesson for those who are ""scroogey"" and just not thankful for life and how others suffer worse than we do. Another recommendation :)",1395273600,,306,4.385964912280702
178746,5,078885996X,The DVD was a gift and we have not heard about it but we certainly enjoy this film and watch it year during Christmas.  It's very funny.,1395187200,,136,4.037037037037037

If you love Christmas, definitely take out the time to sit down with family and friends and enjoy The Muppet Christmas Carol!",1394755200,,338,4.65
178750,5,078885996X,I love this movie as I remember watching it with my brother when we were younger.  I bought it more as a nostalgic item than for entertainment.  I do love this movie though and my child does enjoy watching the Muppets and their singing as well.,1394582400,,244,4.282608695652174
178751,5,078885996X,"With Muppets of course, you will get a comedic take on a classic story. But Michael Caine's dramatic performance as Scrooge in the midst of all these furry creatures makes you wonder why he never played the role with an all human cast. He is simply perfect and this version brings the classic to life for younger children as well.",1394582400,,330,4.516666666666667

178754,4,078885996X,"This movie is a retelling of A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, so, the plot is pretty solid.

The Muppet twist to the movie is that they have Rizzo and Gonzo act as narrators, and most of the characters in the movie are cast as Muppets instead of humans(naturally). Overall, they manage to put enough humor into the movie to make it quite enjoyable.

4 stars :)",1394409600,,365,4.432835820895522
178755,5,078885996X,"Every Christmas we watch this movie. Our original copy was VHS. My parents recently updated to a blue ray player, so it was time for a new copy of the Muppets Christmas Carol. I have not had much experience with blue ray! But I must say - it was so crisp and clean looking. I recommend the movie and the blue ray version.

You can't go wrong with this family friendly Muppet Christmas movie of the Charles Dickens classic. With Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat narrating, Michael Caine as Scrooge and appearances by Fozzie Bear, the Swedish Chef, Bunsen and Beaker, Statler and Waldorf (the disagreeable old men who heckle from the balcony) as Marley and Marley, Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy as the Cratchits - there is an all star cast!",1394150400,,730,4.488721804511278

I wanted to introduce this movie to my own child so I went ahead and bought it knowing that one of the songs is missing. The overall message is still there and it's still a good movie. My daughter is not yet 3, and I don't plan to show it to her until she's at least 6. I think its a little dark for younger kiddos. I think I first saw it when I was about 7 and the Marley scene scared me quite a lot. I used to fast forward past it until I was 9 or 10. haha.

Even better were the really above average questions the little boy sitting next to me asked, and I loved it when the third spirit (the ghost of Christmas yet to come) appeared in a mist and that same little boy took my hand so I wouldn't be scared.

The script is crisp and brilliantly funny - reminds me of the snappy dialogue in the best of the 1930's comedies (think of the early ""Thin Man"" films). Michael Caine is hands-down the best Scrooge ever. Stingy, uncaring, mean, but human, too. You will find yourself singing along with the music, it is so catchy and, by turns, sweet. The ""casting"" of each of the Muppet characters is impeccable. A great value for this film - one you will watch over and over and over.

178837,5,078885996X,"A delightful romp through Dickens' timeless classic that will have young and old alike singing along.  Christmas isn't Christmas at our house without a viewing of this version of A Christmas Carol.  Kermit is Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy as his wife, Gonzo as Dickens/the narrator, and Waldorf and Statler (the grumpy old balcony guys) as ""Marley and Marley"".  Michael Caine is perfect as Scrooge for this film, and turns in a stellar performance.

One caveat.  The wonderful tune, ""When Love is Gone"", sung to young Scrooge by his fiance Belle is NOT in this version of the film.  You can Google the story to see why/when it was removed.  The song is Belle's lament that Scrooge's love for money has replaced his love for her. The tears shed by Michael Caine as ""Old Scrooge"" stand in stark counterpoint to the emotionless witness of ""Young Scrooge"" as Belle sings. The scene *may* be the single most powerful moment in all of Michael Caine's acting career.  This omission is not an Amazon issue, but a VERY poor decision made Jeffrey Katzenberg at Disney who thought the song would not appeal to young viewers, when the movie was re-released on DVD.  Tragic mistake, as the song is THE emotional and motivational centerpiece of the film, and goes miles to understanding Scrooge's transformation by the spirits.  The song is on the VHS copy of the movie and on the (obsolete and nearly impossible to find) laserdisc version.  One can only hope that one day, the song will be restored to ALL available versions of the film, though that seems unlikely.",1388966400,,1547,4.7781954887218046

The musical numbers are all Muppet-quality (meaning 100% gold). Gonzo the Great and Rizzo the Rat tell the classic not-as-scary-as-it-could-be story of Christmas-themed redemption.  The ghost of Christmas yet to come is actually a dementor. Growing up, it was the scary monster that lived in my closet (next to the werewolf.) Other than that, this movie is completely kid-friendly.

Honestly, Disney - when everyone grew up with a movie on TV a certain way and when the VHS copy we had was a certain way, there is that wretched feeling when they have chosen not to go that extra step to perverse those memories.  When I was a child, that song was in even in the theatrical version I got to see (I was part of a test audience) so I'm always put off by its absence.  I even had to explain it to my niece and nephew (a new generation) why the song was missing.  This is the Muppet Show Season 1 DVD debacle all over again (songs missing from episodes because Disney could not be bothered to secure the rights to said songs).  I feel like since this is not one of their official Disney films they just don't care what happens to it as long as they are still making money.

This is key because in the theatrical version leaves out the best part of the best scene in the movie.  A song ("" When Love Is Gone"") sung by young Scrooge's fiancee, that he let slip through his fingers.  There is even a reprise of the song at the end of the movie (""The Love We've Found"") that now makes no sense because the song is missing earlier.  Disney went to sleep on this one.

178905,4,078885996X,"This charming take on the classic has the Great Gonzo acting as Dickens the on screen narrator, indulging in occasional badinage with Rizzo, while recounting the tale. All the familiar elements are there, including Michael Caine as a thoroughly unscrupulous Scrooge, brought to learn the error of his ways by his encounters with the Ghosts of Christmas past, present and future. The familiar Muppet characters take on various roles: Kermit plays Bob Cratchit, with Miss Piggy as his surprisingly pliant wife; Stadtler and Waldorf play Scrooge's erstwhile partners, now living as the Ghosts of Christmas past; Fozzie Bear plays Fozziewig (Fezziwig in the Dickens text); Sam the Eagle has a fine time playing the Head Teacher of the Junior High School graduates. There are some nice in-jokes, such as the occasion when Sam the Eagle associates money-making with the Americans, but abruptly changes his line of dialogue when reminded he is acting in a British classic; now it's the Brits who are guilty. One of the shops seen in the final sequence where Scrooge bestows gifts to all is called Micklewhite's - a direct reference to Caine's real name. Miles Goodman's songs are catchy yet not exactly memorable; Caine at one point is forced to sing, which provides a few embarrassing moments.

There are 2 things disappointing about the BluRay version: no Impatient Kermit, and zoomed-in widescreen.
One of our favorite things on the DVD version is getting Kermit all flustered if we don't make a selection off of the menu.  That is missing on the BluRay.  Sure, BD has the 2 Intermission scenes, but it doesn't make up for Impatient Kermit.
The biggest disappointment, however, is that the wide screen presentation is just a zoomed in screen so that it fills a wide-screen.  Sure, the details are nicer than if I were to zoom in on the DVD, but a lot of the screen edges are cut off now.  Yes, it's likely that the original was not filmed in wide-screen, but don't zoom it.

178940,5,078885996X,"Jim Henson has struck the perfect balance between muppet zaniness and human tenderness. Many of the classic lines from Dickens' book are here (""Marley was dead, to begin with""), making this a fun watch for fans of Dickens' classic who may not necessarily be fans of the muppets.

Henson uses the muppets' silliness to augment the serious and sad parts of Scrooge's story. While you're chuckling along with the hecklers, Statler and Waldorf, you're that much sadder for young Scrooge, who has no one to laugh with, and nothing to laugh about, as he's left alone at Christmas. During the more dramatic moments, such as Scrooge's plea to the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, the muppets are wisely absent.

Michael Caine appears to be really enjoying himself here. He does gruff and curmudgeonly incredibly well, making it that much more affecting when, at the end of that long night, he finally breaks a smile.

Even apart from the holiday setting, I love this version for illustrating Dickens' wonderful message -- no matter how badly you may have messed up in your life, or how isolated you may feel, it's never too late to change.",1386547200,,1130,4.7846153846153845

It has everything you'd expect from a Muppet outing: lots of humor (some aimed over the kids' heads at moms & dads), great songs & music, lots of Muppets, and lots of heart.  It also manages to stay faithful enough to the source material to actually feel respectable.  Michael Caine makes a great Scrooge, though he plays it a bit less curmudgeonly than you normally find.  That's entirely appropriate since this is a family flick, and one of the great things about this movie is that it is suitable for all ages.  The ghost of Jacob Marley becomes the ghosts of Jacob & Robert Marley (played by Muppets Statler & Waldorf), and they are more funny than frightening along with the rest of the characters.  Despite its humor, the movie still has a sweet nostalgic streak that runs deep and it really is a great re-telling of a great story.

178970,4,078885996X,"This is the movie that gets me into the Christmas spirit. I remember seeing it in theaters at age 4, and is what I think of as my ""first movie"", and even now I sometimes watch it in the middle of June when I am feeling ""Christmas-y"". It is a lovely adaptation of the Dickens classic with the beloved Muppets, and Michael Caine is phenomenal as Scrooge. The music is fantastic, and after 21 years I still know all the words to the songs. As many times as I watched this as a kid, I always catch something new each year, usually a bit of humor meant for adults that just go over kids' heads...which I appreciate now.

I bought the prime instant video having read the disappointed reviews that the song ""The Love is Gone"" was cut from the DVDs, and was prepared for it to be cut from this version, and yes it is true that it is not included. It is sad that the powers that be felt the need to do this. Although as a child I would have been psyched because I always fast forwarded through the icky love song that was boring to me, but now I realize the song represents a pivotal turning point in the movie and provides a crucial character development for Scrooge. Now having said that, I realize that may be a little over-analytical for a Disney movie. However, regardless of turning points and character developments, it is quite obvious that something is missing, even to someone who has never seen it. Additionally, it makes the ending song of the movie less meaningful because the last song is a reprise with the same melody, except it references the ""love we found"" rather than the ""love is gone"" and completes the Scrooge transformation musically and quite beautifully, which is very satisfying to the viewer. Without the first song though, the finale is simply another song, and to someone who has never seen the movie it may be confusing because it kind of comes out of nowhere.

I recently got married, and I think about this movie as one I will watch with my kids when we have them. I hope one day they release another edition with ""The Love is Gone"" put back in. In any case, it is still my favorite Christmas movie.",1382400000,13,2123,4.399491094147582

I believe this is the first time the Muppets have taken a classic story and spun it into a film of their own.  Well, a job well done.  To this day, I still thoroughly enjoy this film.  Michael Kane comes to the screen as Ebenezer Scrooge and he brings with him everything we know and love/loathe about this classic character...but I mainly envy him for getting to star with the Muppets.  Since no adaption of ""A Christmas Caroll"" is complete without Charles Dickens's pros from the original book, Gonzo the Great steps into the writer's shoes to give us the background we need to be fully enthrawled in this story...it worked out perfectly, and having the wise-cracking Rizzo the Rat alongside him only made it better.  Every classic Muppet character had their part and carried it out with the precition and high quality we have come to expect of this fine franchise.  From Kermit the Frog as Bob Cratchet to Statler and Waldorf as Jacob and Robert Marley (note that Robert Marley wasn't in the book but was instead created for this film so Statler and Waldorf could portray these ""brothers""...no complaints here), there was no flaw in the casting and performances.  The humor was classic of the Muppets as well as appropriate for this plot.

178988,5,078885996X,"In this review, I am going to discuss a few things: the film itself, and the controversy and relative anger surrounding the inclusion and disclusion of the song ""When Love Is Gone"" from this film.
Aside from the Jim Carrey adaption, this is the most faithful film I've seen for the Christmas Carol, but yet they tamed it down enough so as to not frighten children beyond what they could handle.
When I saw this movie, I was touched deeply and enjoyed every single second of the film, and I would be a bloody liar if I didn't say that this movie was a touch emotional to me, as well, probably more than any other adaption, because the Muppets are so extremely cute, and to see Scrooge mistreat them at the beginning was a little bit sad for me to see.
This is a splendid film with miraculous music that I sing around the house year-round, some that, out of nostalgia, make me cry to hear those beautiful, talented voices singing them. My favorites are ""Bless Us All,"" and ""Thankful Heart."" I have the soundtrack, on CD and my iPod, and I listen to the soundtrack literally YEAR-ROUND. I wouldn't be able to enjoy my Christmas without having this movie, as it reminds me constantly that you need to help the needy and love each other. As a Christian person, this is a movie that has great morales, and I deeply enjoy the story just as much. It humbles me when I read somewhere online that the author of the book, Charles Dickens, helped the homeless, and if one knocked on his door, he would allow them to come in and share a meal with him, which makes me want to support his works all the more. If you watch this movie, you will never, ever forget what's in the movie, and what it will teach you as you watch, and the emotions are strong - happy, and sad as well.
Now that I've gotten through my thoughts and my emotions on this film, I'd like to talk briefly of the controversy and anger that surrounds the popular ""When Love Is Gone"" segment from the film. From what I understand, it was in the film, but was removed for time purposes at the theatre, then restored on the VHS in some countries - it was in mine; my VHS has the song on it - and then it was removed from most DVD releases. Now, from what I understand, the fullscreen releases on DVD host this ""deleted scene,"" but it has yet to appear on the widescreen edition, and When Love Is Gone has not appeared on any Blu-Ray releases. I noticed a few reviews giving this one-star because of that, although I personally think it is unfair. Of course, I'm not here to attack anybody, I'd like to offer my insight to this: I'm not a fan of the song, personally, although I do believe that the part where it cuts, with Gonzo and Rizzo crying, and Scrooge asking the question to the Spirit, are empty without that song in there. I also think it's great that, on the DVD, we have the choice to watch the original theatrical (widescreen, without the song) version or the ""extended"" (fullscreen, with song) version of the film. As someone who's not a fan of the song, I prefer the widescreen version.
When it comes to this film, can you not watch the fullscreen version of this film if you want to watch this scene, if even for nostalgic purposes. Most people who have this movie on DVD and are upset that the widescreen version doesn't feature the song, also have the film on the original VHS, which was released in fullscreen. It would be just like flashing back to your childhood if you saw the movie in the fullscreen state. I don't have a ""widescreen,"" or ""flatscreen"" TV, nor do I ever have any desire to, because I enjoy having the ""box"" for the TV screen rather than the ""rectangle"" screen, and I will always support full screen. To me, widescreen isn't a very good format. But, if I could see this film in fullscreen without that song, I certainly would.
I'm sorry for rambling, but I feel very strongly about this film, and I hold it very dear to my heart, and I just wanted to let you all know how meaningful this film is to me. Merry Christmas (aww crap, it's only August...)",1377043200,,4036,4.3612217795484725

After reading so many bad reviews about the DVD and Bluray versions, I was kind of worried about what I was going to receive. The DVD came today in the mail, so I decided to preview it before I watch it this Christmas. To me the picture looks fine, even though a lot of people complained that the sides were cut. And yes, the widescreen version does not include the song ""When Love is Gone"", but to me that is a plus. I always thought that part was slow and boring and would fast forward it anyway.

178993,4,078885996X,"Honestly the world didn't need yet ANOTHER adaptation of A Christmas Carol, but if it had to happen this is a pretty good one. It sticks impressively close to the original text, adding in elements that many adaptations leave out (such as the rapid aging of the Ghost of Christmas Present.) Some of the Muppets are slightly out of character, having been manipulated to fit the role they have in the story rather than the role being changed to fit the Muppet, but it flows so well you'll barely notice. This also marks the first pairing of Gonzo and Rizzo as a double act and it's a great start to a lovely relationship.",1374710400,,618,4.477876106194691

178999,5,078885996X,"This movie warms my heart and reminds me what Christmas is really all about without cramming the Christian religion down my throat.  The TRUE meaning of Jesus and Christmas are about love and charity and helping those--of ALL faiths, or none at all--in need--not about the Christian religion or toys.  Don't blame commercialism at Christmas--commercialism starts in the individual heart--not in the stores.  The stores only make a profit once a year and that is at Christmas so you can hardly blame them for making a big deal out of sales and deals at Christmas time.  As long as you keep the purity of the true message in your heart--and this movie helps you do that--you'll be able to cut the stores some slack and remember that there are other religions who have holy days also during the so called ""Christmas Season"".  Christ isn't the only reason for the season.  Keep him and all others in ""Christmas""!",1373155200,,908,4.751592356687898

I can't stand the singing bit when Scrooge is courting whats-her-name, but nothing is perfect. It gets overly sanguine for a Muppet production when Scrooge is with Christmas Future, but he is dead and everyone hates him, so exactly how do you take Dickens' concepts and make them more ""Muppety""?

The only disappointment is that they cut out the song that Scrooge's girlfriends sings in the park when they breakupthat song really helped develop Scrooge's character and the melody is the theme of the ending song, which ties it together very nicely.

Its actually a funny movie, with dark and sad parts too.  Its perfect for kids, but I truly believe adults would like to watch this movie with thier kids as well.  I am 25 and watch this movie with my 28 year old sister, and we both love it.  It has great music, a great cast, and has the same basic story of the original, but with some fun things for the kids.

It is also a musical, and some of the songs are memorable...especially ""When Love is Gone"".  Except for the music and the comedy, this adaptation pretty much follows the Dickens novel.

There are so many subtle things that you don't necessarily get from one viewing; for instance, giving Jacob Marley a brother named Bob.  I never caught that until this Christmas.  Having both a widescreen and fullscreen version is great, because the song ""When Love Is Gone"" (from the fullscreen version) is an important dramatic scene and really lends more sympathy for old Scrooge's current state.  This version follows the original story better than a lot of Christmas Carol re-tellings.  The only qualm might be that children under the age of ten probably won't understand this movie unless they're already familiar with the story.  There's probably not enough silliness and physical jokes to appeal to very young viewers.",1358294400,2,791,5.093023255813954

179076,3,078885996X,"I recall really liking this back in the early 90s. In fact, at the time, it made my top ten Christmas film list. Boy, does reviewing previous reviews make a dif! My wife liked this one, too, so we added it to one of our yearly Christmas film purchases (we pickup a few each year) and where it's definitely entertaining and Michael Caine does a very good job as Ebenezer Scrooge, this is just one more decent filmed version of Charles Dickens' story ""A Christmas Carol"", along with the 1970 musical version ""Scrooge"", the 1938 MGM version, and 1969 Hanna-Barbera Australian animated TV version. However, these are all heads and shoulders over the recent Disney ""animated"" version, with Jim Carrey (awful!) and the other Disney short, ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" (below average), not to mention the overbearing ""Scrooged"" with Bill Murray. It's worth adding to our collection (if nothing else, the menu, with Kermit, cracks us up). But I find, as I age, I have less and less interest in Jim Henson. I grew up with the original Sesame Street on TV and was a preteen when 'The Muppet Show' debuted, as well. Perhaps these are better for adolescents? Looking for a good version of Scrooge? Look no further than the 1951 British version, with plenty of atmosphere and shot in beautiful black and white. There's a beautiful animated short by Richard Williams also, from '71, which offers some extremely mysterious animation techniques. Very impressive, but not available on dvd, at least commercially.",1358208000,,1493,4.928571428571429

I don't know that buying the blu-ray made much difference in this older movie, perhaps if you have a larger TV than our 55""? It is a great introduction to this classic--we all remember loving this when it was in the theatres and had it on VHS. The scary parts are done so as not to be too scary, but it would be good to talk about this with younger children and perhaps not for most children younger than five or six.

On Christmas Eve, he is visited by the Marley Brothers (played by Standoff and Wardorf) tell him that he is in danger for his future that his chains of life will be heavy as he will be cursed with them for he will be visited by three spirits of past, present and future to change his life.

An excellent take on Charles Dickens's immortal tale, Walt Disney Pictures and The Jim Henson Company has done of the best Muppet movies ever and one of the best takes on the classic story. Starring Gonzo (Voiced by David Golz) as Charles Dickens with his sidekick Rizzo (Voiced by Steve Whitmire) they tell us the story in their own way with a cast of both humans and muppet characters including appearances by Sprocket from Fraggle Rock with Fozzie Bear (voiced by Frank Oz) as FozzieWig, Miss Piggy (voiced by Frank Oz) as Bob's wife and many others. The songs are quite nice by writer Paul Williams and Caine did a flawless performance as Scrooge, i still remembered when i was 11 seeing this movie 3 times in theaters and blew me away as it became one of my fave Muppet movies and takes on the story.

This blu-ray offers superior picture and terrific audio compared to the DVD but is missing the 89 extended cut with the ""When Love is Song"" song which you can find on 2005's DVD but if you own that keep it but buy this for the quality and extras like 2 audio commentaries especially by Brian Henson who directed this movie with extras like Disney intermission like you seen on The Muppets blu-ray, blooper reel, documentary and 2 featurettes plus digital copy.",1356566400,,1927,4.566473988439307

Kids may not like it, but most adults do. Mind you, the sound and picture on Blu-Ray will blow you away, but I would have liked the option to watch it either with or without the cut scene.

First I wish that I had read the reviews on this video before buying it, I mean I always read the Amazon reviews, but this time I didn't, and I regret it. The second is I wish that I could give this rating something less than a star; probably a tenth of a star would be too generous. This was such a disappointment and a waste of good money.

DISNEY TOTALLY RUINED WHAT HAD BECOME A HOLIDAY TRADITION AROUND OUR HOUSE. Two of our favorite holiday movies were the Muppet Christmas Carol and It's a Wonderful Life, it looks like we will be going back to It's a Wonderful Life and more than likely this disappointing Muppet Christmas Carol video will be put on the shelf.

Disney in their infinite stupidity and utter ignorance has butchered a beloved Christmas classic and Scrooged a time honored holiday tradition. They removed a pivotal scene with the song ""When Love is Gone"" sung with Michael Cane. This was unexpected (as I said I should have read the reviews) and a major disappointment that ruined the rest of the movie for us. What were they thinking? I read the supposed reasoning for excluding it and think they have their head up their ass.  As usual for Disney, it is about what makes money for them rather than honoring the true spirit of the original version. I am hoping this and other reviews get out and they discover that this was the biggest bone head move they (Disney) could have made.

Removing this key scene diminishes the story, ruins the cadence, and leaves the entire production meaningless. Disney needs to learn to keep their cotton picking hands off of perfection (which is what this was up until now).

I thought maybe the instant video version was damaged or something. Or maybe they cut it so I would buy the hard copy version. I sat there wondering what had just happened? Did they seriously cut an important part of the movie out? I checked online only to find out this was done with the first DVD release! WTH?! If I had known they had wrecked my childhood movie I would not have paid money to buy it again. I am going to go into my parents boxes and find that old VHS. I refuse to watch this movie on DVD or Blu-Ray until they fix it. What's sad is my brother loved it and will probably never see it complete. It makes no sense without the song, it was absolutely beautiful. Now it is a hollow shell of itself. I wish Hollywood would just leave movies alone, once they are out DON'T TOUCH THEM!

179171,1,078885996X,"For anyone who grew up on the VHS version of this movie, you will be sorely disappointed after watching the DVD/BlueRay version.  Someone at Disney, in their infinite wisdom, decided to edit out 3 minutes of the movie.  The key part of this is when Michael Cain (Scrooge) and Belle are singing the lament song to each other ""When love is gone..."" in the field of snow with the ghost of Christmas past.  This entire scene is now missing from the film, and literally ruins the rest of the film for fans.  It is such a pivotal point in the story, I cannot believe it was cut.

To make this abundantly clear, the VHS movie runtime is 89 miuntes, the DVD/BlueRay version is 86 minutes.  3 minutes doesn't sound like a lot, but it makes a HUGE DIFFERENCE.

Again, if you grew up watching this move on VHS, this ridiculously poor edit almost ruins the rest of a wonderful masterpiece.  Come on Disney, what the heck were you [thinking].

The even worse part is how in the ""Special Features"" part of the disc, they spend so much time talking about that scene between Scrooge and Belle and how Michael Cain worked so hard to sing for the scene.  Great to talk about how great this was and then completely cut it from the movie.

With that edit in place, Scrooge simply arrives in the snowfield with Belle, has the short conversation about money, and then they fade back to the rest of the movie.  Its obvious in this scene there is something cut and missing.  The flow is terrible.

Until this movie is re-released, we will continue to watch the VHS version.  I will likely master my old VHS copy on to DVD before it disintegrates.",1356220800,11,1622,4.4324324324324325

We were stunned when the song between Scrooge and Belle was cut from the movie. This 4 minute song demonstrates to the viewer why Scrooge was so bitter about Christmas. Why cut it now? It's 4 minutes! Without the song, the reprise at the end of the movie makes no sense.

Also, Disney remastered the movie and completely lost the cold grey London feel of the movie. All the color chromo is turned to full bright and it looks like it's summertime on a cheap plastic movie set. Someone with a creative eye should re-remaster this embarrassing mess.

Finally, Amazon should pull the star ratings on the previous edition. It is very misleading.",1356220800,8,893,4.56875
179173,3,078885996X,"When I saw that Disney was releasing "" A Muppet Christmas Carol"" on Blu-Ray this year I was quite ecstatic for many reasons.

I was looking forward to seeing this film in a higher quality and having a digital copy to keep so that my child could watch this when we travel. Lastly I had hoped that Disney included the song, "" When Love is Gone"" which resulted in a heated discussion at the discovery of its disappearance on the previous DVD.

Although I enjoy the new Blu ray of this film, I would take away all the bells and whistles of this Blu-Ray if it meant that the film would stay in its true originality. Disney has taken away the true meaning of this film and most all, disgraced the real message of this production ; that love, and the Christmas Spirit can always be restored. How dare they commit this travesty under the guise that the song upset children. I watched this film when I was five years old. It made me sad, but did not scar me from ever watching the film again. After all, I have continued to watch this film for 20 years now and still love the song to this day. I am more scared by the disregard of Disney in REMOVING the song; for it tells me that Disney would defile a Jim Henson film for such little reason.

I hope this message, like many of the other reviews, brings this issue to light again:

As the movie goes, if you're looking for a close translation of the Christmas Carol novel, you would never bother to even look at a muppet version, so of course, they take liberties with the story although the message and general gist of the movie is the same. It's a safe version for the kiddos, not too scary for the Ghost of Christmas future, although some little ones could get scared. Otherwise, the movie is soooo quotable and even has cute references to the muppets characters outside of the film that the adults will appreciate. One of my faves is a scene with Sam the Eagle where he makes the statement ""it is the AMERICAN way"" only to have Gonzo correct him to say ""it is the BRITISH way.""
I've been watching this movie for all the 20 (yikes!) years its been out and it's still good every time.

Now for the Amazon instant version I bought, it viewed very well. Except for when they cut out a complete scene.

Thank you, Disney, for the care you take in presenting your classic films in their intended original aspect ratio on Blu-ray. I would like to help you make future releases even better.

There is a Blu-ray mastering technology called ""seamless branching"" wherein it is possible for the end-user to select from multiple versions of a film that which they wish to see. An example of this technology is used the the BD release of Spielberg's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Close-Encounters-of-the-Third-Kind-Two-Disc-30th-Anniversary-Ultimate-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B000VECACG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Two-Disc 30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray</a>] which presents three versions on one disc.

Using seamless branching, you could offer your customers the version of ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" they wish to view:

  1. The one you want them to see.

  2. The one they want to see -- this latter includes the song ""When Love Is Gone"" -- which, arguably, touches upon, *is* the heart of this film and is evoked in the closing song -- ""When Love Is Found"" -- and revisited in the closing credits which makes its absence all the more keenly missed.

  3. The one but few know incorporating now deleted scenes. (Perhaps including the other songs dropped out of the film but included in the soundtrack: ""Room In Your Heart"" and ""Chairman of the Board"" -- these may/may not have been filmed).

This would bring tidings of comfort and joy to your global home viewing audience. And it would also boost sales when you re-release the Blu-ray in, for example, a special Digi-book format! Special features *could* include a separate DTS 5.1 soundtrack for the film score and songs! I love the sheer idea of it!

Saying a sweet song about love lost is ""too sad"" for a film based on a *Dickens* novel, demonstrates a real lack of understanding of the source material. It also nullifies the refrain at the end of the film (""The Love We've Found"").

179188,2,078885996X,"When I first read the book ""No easy Day"" by Mark Owen (The infamous release that recounts the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden), he particularly channled a recurring theme in the life of many: a concept called the ""Good Idea Fairy."" This ""fairy"" was the tendency for the passiviely uninvolved to suddenly involve themselves in a mission at the last minute--a mission that has already been tried, trued, and calibrated--and suddenly change the calculus, throwing everyone's game off and possibly ruining the entire mission--all in the name of ""progress.""

Well, it looks like that diminutive knave showed up at Henson Inc.  Because they've gaffed the ONE movie--the ONE movie I have actively anticipated on Blu-ray. With ONE three-minute omission.

Somewhat distracted, I didn't even notice it, as I brought it straight home, and began watching it with my family (which for us is now a 13-year tradition since I first had it loaned to me on VHS in 1999).  My eleven-year-old immediately said ""Dad! They took the song out!"" She then began to sing the melody, and I'm like ""they sure did. I wonder why."" Supposedly, the omission was made to accommodate kids.  Mine noticed the problem like a noonday mugging. In terms of one-family, anecdotal data: Mission Failed.

And wonder, I do. Now my inner-cynic says that there is now one more opportunity to capitalize on guys like me, who will immediately buy a ""fixed"" version, because the transfer to Blu-ray is immediately noticable in its qualitative aspects, and the 1080p ratios are perfect--the cinematic feel to this thing is fantastic.  The sound has also come up a few notches, too. Possibly the best songs ever written for any one of their films.

The fact that this post-Jim film is perhaps better than any film directly handled directly by Jim Henson is actually a testament to Henson himself. Despite the fact that his son was the directorial heir-apparrent, and had never done so before, the sheer weight of trying to go to theater a mere two years after the death of Kermit's literal soul must have been daunting; merely trying to compensate for the voice of a number of characters--not to mention the subtleties of expression and hand movements that will never be replaced--would have made many buckle and call it a day.

But the standard--along with chronological proximity--guaranteed that Frank Oz and the crew would pour themselves into the legacy like never before.  One can also see a contemplative tribute to Henson in the falling star observed by Kermit when he's troubled about the world in general. This is why many will say this is the best Muppet movie of all time. At least I will.

So why remove the song? The now-omitted ""When Love Is Gone,"" written by Paul Williams, falls victim to an active decision to ""revert"" to an original, cinematic state.  But this makes no sense, since very few actually saw it in the theaters, and every release to video has included the song (which, by the way is reprised at the end after Scrooge's tranformation, along with a lyrical one as well--the reprise now sits alone with no referential place). The song provides the romantic, referential sadness inherent in Scrooge's past.  Taking out the song is the equivalent to removing ""supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" from ""Mary Poppins.""

One can only guess that--like I predict with Apple--the inherencies that made them great are but mere echoes; that their decompositional processes started when their true visionaries left us. And yet, I hold out hope for both.

Two stars from me. I certainly hope that Brian Henson and crew will release an ameliorated version sometime, with the same qualities galvanized into this one. It will immediately gain five stars from nearly all.  I keep hoping that some ""easter egg"" hammered within the disc reveals a true version.  But quite frankly, even if it does, I'm not inclined to accept entering a whimsical labyrinth to see it.

So, you also get the benefit of hearing more of Dickens' language. It's a great way for kids to see Christmas Carol, and a pretty good way for adults, too.
  As an added plus, they feature a light-hearted but useful on-screen warning before the ghost of Christmas yet-to-come scenes, giving a nice heads-up if you're watching with small children who might want to clear out for the scary parts (not that scary, of course, but would've frightened the bejeebers out of me when I was 5).

I understand that song could seem ""boring"" to some children, so why not have the option to watch the movie with or without that scene? Like so many other movies with extended editions and deleted scenes included on the blu ray? The pacing of the ghost of Christmas past just seems so short without that song included and the scene seems to end so abruptly.

The first time I saw the cut (""theatrical"") widescreen version of this first rate production with that wonderful song ""When Love is Gone"" missing was on my DVR through Dish Network. I remember saying to my wife something like, ""What the heck!!"" Was that an edited cable TV version or something?"" I had my VHS version tucked away under the TV because I was eagerly anticipating seeing this, my favorite version of The Christmas Carol in widescreen on a 46"" TV. I was expecting that same emotional satisfaction I had experienced during past Christmas viewings. I had always appreciated how the writers had transparently used the same tune as ""When Love is Gone"" in the finale with different lyrics to paint a stark contrast between Scrooges lowest moment and the triumphant celebration of the his redemption. That missing association in the DVR widescreen version left me lacking and wanting the familiar, joyful, heart lifting feelings I had always experienced in the past. I was deeply disappointed. My inclination was to watch the VHS version ASAP to purge the loss I felt. I wasn't utterly disappointed because, in my own ignorance, I didn't believe there were actually over the counter versions without ""When Love is Gone."" After all, who would do something that foolish?

The other day I saw the Blu-ray in a department store and became exited at the prospect of ordering 3 Blu-ray disks for myself and my two long distance adult sons' families. They didn't have copies. What a Great Idea! It's a family favorite, right? A tradition to pass down through the grand kiddies as well. I had my suspicions about ""why"" that song had been missing in the widescreen version I saw, so I decided to read some reviews to see what others had encountered. Now I'm utterly disappointed. Does anyone in big business make the right decisions anymore?! Another settle for. I guess I'll sit on my old copy and let the boys decide whether it's a disappointment or not. I almost hate to give Disney my money for this but I know the kids and grand-kids will enjoy it anyway (and maybe the boys won't notice).

Disney... children squirming through a song is nothing new when you consider the scores of music in so many of your old fashioned feature films. BTW... Since when was the Muppet Show and the many spin-off productions it generated EVER considered to be Children's programing anyway?! Funny, I don't remember my kids watching it on Saturday mornings. Do the words FAMILY and PRIME TIME still mean something to you?! You broke the Cardinal rule of Family Movies, reducing the appeal to those who spend the money. C'mon Man!! If you guys didn't spend time pedaling so much daytime crap between quality releases, maybe you'd still have some market sensitivity. How can people near the top get paid so much and still be so wrong?

Now that I have two kids, I'm so excited to show it to them. I read through many of the reviews and apparently I'm the only one who's also excited that ""The Love is Gone"" song is well, gone. Or at least I've only read reviews of people who are upset the song is out. I didn't see this in the theater so I didn't know that the scene was an add-on for the home release and the TV version. I have always fast-forwarded through that scene. Personally, I think it slows the movie down and I actually don't really like the song at all. Just not my taste. So imagine my glee that the song doesn't belong, or at least doesn't belong in the theatrical version, and is (for my convenience not) there. Can't wait to see it this way.

I do empathize with the legions who grew up loving the song and think that it's ever so wrong that it's not included in the widescreen version. I get it. Disney makes odd choices when it comes to our collective nostalgia. In this one case, their choice is working for me.

He spends most of the movie talking to sock puppets, yet you would not see that on his face or hear it in his voice. He takes the roll so seriously you would think he was doing it with a fine acting troup. If you could edit the muppets out, you would think you were watching a straight production of Charles Dickens'.

It is just as it is supposed to be; this is the 20th Anniversary blu ray edition of the THEATRICAL release...therefore, the song ""When Love is Gone"" is not included. Why would it be? The song was NOT IN the theatrical release (it was cut prior to the film being released in theaters), so it does not belong in the 20th Anniversary blu ray. The song was added to some home video releases at a later time, so it does not belong on this release.

The transfer is fantastic...both sound and picture are a very welcome upgrade from the DVD release. This is the best I have seen this film since seeing it (multiple times) in the theater. Stray hairs can be spotted, stitching in costumes, the texture of the Muppets, it's all here in glorious high def. And I absolutely LOVE the surprises when the film is ""paused""...Wonderful..!!!!

People who choose not to purchase this because of a missing song are truly missing out...this film is so much more than one song that wasn't even in the theatrical release.

179275,3,078885996X,"It's hard for any of the 1990's Muppet movies to escape the shadows of the first three classic entries in the franchise starring the charming creatures. ""The Muppet Movie,"" ""The Great Muppet Caper,"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"" are looked at by many to be Jim Henson's sacred trilogy of films starring the beloved characters. Disney gives ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" another chance in the limelight with the ""It's Not Easy Being Scrooge"" Blu-ray + Digital Copy 20th Anniversary Special Edition.

The title of the movie is a good indication of what viewers can expect from ""The Muppet Christmas Carol."" Michael Caine is old miser Scrooge, who plays straight to a cast of everyone's favorite critters including Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, and the rest of the gang. He's visited by three angels on Christmas Eve who teach him the importance of the holiday and showing good will toward men.

""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" isn't a bad movie. It's just another unnecessary re-telling of a classic Christmas tale. The concept of adapting Charles Dickens' short story and adding wacky characters or updating it was already played out even in 1992. I'm sure children will find it amusing, but their parents will be catching a quick nap amongst the tiny laughter.

Michael Caine is absolutely perfect in the role of Scrooge. He pours his heart and soul into it. The fact that he is surrounded by Jim Henson's hand puppets doesn't affect his performance at all. As far as Caine's concerned, he's starring in a version of the famous tale surrounded by other Oscar-winning actors.

The high-definition transfer of the movie looks and sounds great. The picture is near flawless and clear. The 5.1 surround sound breathes new life into the musical numbers, which aren't very memorable in the first place.

There are some nice special features on this new edition of the movie. There's audio commentary by director Brian Henson, Kermit, Gonzo, Rizzo, and more for starters. ""Frogs, Pigs and Humbug: Unwrapping a New Holiday Classic"" is a 22-minute look ""behind-the-scenes"" of the movie that's included.

A couple of featurettes entitled ""Gonzo: A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Weirdo"" and ""Christmas Around the World"" are featured as well. A Blooper reel and five Intermission songs round out the bonus material for the Blu-ray disc.

Most fans of Jim Henson's fuzzy creations will want to pick up ""The Muppet Christmas Carol: It's Not Easy Being Scrooge 20th Anniversary Special Edition."" The obvious reason is it's the debut of the movie on Blu-ray. The film provides good clean family entertainment for everyone. I'm sure it'll be and is considered essential viewing for many during the holiday season. Just don't expect the magic and wit you get when watching 2011's ""The Muppets.""",1353974400,,2798,5.017241379310345

I've always liked Jim Hensen movies, and I'm fond of a lot of Disney movies as well, but the decision to cut a song about a break up as ""too sad"" seems a bit harsh, considering the fact that they put songs about murder and other cold themes in their villain songs (which are always very catchy - ""Be Prepared"" in The Lion King).

It's missing ""When Love Is Gone,"" which is both the emotional climax of Michael Caine's performance, and the finest of Paul Williams's songs for the film.

Digging through product listings and other peoples' reviews, it appears that you can either choose between having the film in its proper widescreen, or having the full running time of the movie, but either way, there's no way to buy the entire film as it was meant to be seen.

The remaster for the Blu-Ray is beautiful. The detail is incredible; you can see the little bubbles in the foam on Gonzo's nose. But it's missing the four minutes that serve as the turning point. Caine's Scrooge goes from resentful to penitent and grateful, and you don't get to see that transition occur. You get a really awkward jump cut. The french horns and violins flirt with the melody, and swell up for the musical number, and then there's an abrupt cut to the end of the scene. Even if you'd never seen it before, you could tell that something was wrong.

For many of us (the majority), this song is absolutely essential--crucial--to providing a complete and deep re-telling of the Dickens classic.

So after holding this version of ""The Christmas Carol"" above all other versions, why am I giving it a 1-star review? For one simple reason: this pivotal song is CUT from the 2005 and *now* 2012 releases. Disney had 7 years to gather and listen to feedback from their previous release and make corrections as necessary. And what did Disney do? They gave us an HD version of the 2005 version.

The 2012 release was a chance to get it *right*. And Disney screwed up...again. Needless to say, I'm joining a large group of boycotters and hoping the next release will be in five years or less (25th anniversary edition, anyone?).

It has been the top-rated review for THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL all this time and has been the first review you see on the product site, but I moved it because I no longer have any hope that Disney will ever issue the movie properly, so what is the point of keeping up the review? As soon as I delete it, its top rating will vanish and it will become only another ordinary review at this spot, where it may help somebody. Peace!

Oh well, the bottom-line purpose of my 2005 review was mainly to encourage Disney to release the COMPLETE MOVIE (that is, with ""When Love Is Gone"") in WIDESCREEN in THE HIGHEST RESOLUTION available--ALL AT THE SAME TIME! What a concept!

So here it is 7 years later and Disney has released the movie in high-resolution Blu-ray, in widescreen, but an INCOMPLETE version. So close but so far away! The 1993 Laserdisc was complete and widescreen and wonderful! Then since the dawn of DVD, I've been waiting for the next high-resolution widescreen complete version: the 2002 DVD was a bust, as was the 2005 DVD, and now the Blu-ray is pathetic.

The fact is that I'm old enough now that I may not be alive when Disney releases the ""next best"" high-resolution format, whatever that may be. And Disney doesn't seem inclined to ever again release the film properly or take notice of those of us who sincerely consider the song a vital part of the movie. Frankly that is insulting. Though it's nice to know that many folks agree with me, it is truly disturbing that the Disney people could easily do the perfectly reasonable, common-sense RIGHT thing--but don't! My sounding off till doomsday hasn't done anything. I've tried to persuade them with logic (see below) for seven years till I'm blue in the face, only to be either unnoticed or blown off. And the worst of it is that with Blu-ray technology, Disney could have solved this problem any number of ways, yet they persist in ignoring the simple concept of preserving the integrity of this Brian Henson Christmas classic. Instead of fixing a problem, they made it worse!

Thanks to all who have supported the proper presentation of Brian Henson's PERFECT movie THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL!

P.S. I just had to get a Widescreen ""fix"", and so I put on the 2005 DVD for a few minutes, and, of course, it was preceded with a trailer for another Disney movie, THE LADY AND THE TRAMP. The scene in the preview was the delightful one where Tramp shyly rolls the meatball over to Lady with his nose with the beautiful song ""Bella Notte"" in the background and then they wind up eating the same strand of spaghetti and . . . kiss!  Well, it occurred to me that if Disney was so hot ""into"" cutting great scenes from its movies, this would be a great one to remove! Of what possible value is it--other than it is at the heart and core of the film, much like the ""When Love Is Gone"" scene in THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL?

PLEASE, DISNEY, I'M ON MY KNEES. PLEASE MAKE THINGS RIGHT BY **QUICKLY** RELEASING THE COMPLETE MOVIE WITH ""WHEN LOVE IS GONE"" IN WIDESCREEN IN THE HIGHEST RESOLUTION ALL AT THE SAME TIME! PLEASE DO THE RIGHT THING INSTEAD OF THE COMMERCIAL THING. Read the reviews.  There are lots of unhappy people out there! It should be obvious by now that the home video version of the movie is a MUCH LOVED CHRISTMAS TRADITION FOR WHOLE GENERATIONS--for 20 years.  You are messing with people's memories!  Someone suggested that you may have lost the widescreen masters of the scene with the song.  Well, in that case, the Widescreen Laserdisc exists.  Isn't there a way to digitally ""cut and paste"" the scene from the Laserdisc over to Blu-ray and enhance it as much as possible.  The worst thing that could happen is that you'd sell more discs!  Thank you for your attention and Merry Christmas.

Today is November 6, 2012. It is now official that today the Disney Company, in their infinite wisdom, released the Blu-ray of this movie WITHOUT the Paul William's song ""When Love is Gone,"" which has been a fixture in all home video versions of the movie since 1993. The Muppet Christmas Carol's legions of fans have grown up with the home video version--NOT the original theatrical version that does not include the song--and I suppose that most of its hundreds of thousands of fans love the movie just as they remember it  . . . from home video . . . WITH the song. How many viewers have watched this movie at home during the last 20 years? For however many that might be--and I'm sure it is a huge number--""When Love Is Gone"" is simply a part of the movie as they've always known it.  So why on earth would Disney release the Blu-ray with this severe cut of a song that thousands (millions?) of video viewers expect... and have every right to expect? For these viewers, the song being cut out is brutally jarring! And as I've said before, this film is a work of art and deserves better.

I originally wrote the below review in 2005 in anticipation of the second DVD release of the movie that year. During the seven years since then, more than 700 customers have checked that my review has helped them. Frankly I'm grateful that I could have been of service. And since this new flawed 2012 Blu-ray release has appeared SEVEN years after the previous flawed 2005 release, I suppose it is safe to say that another SEVERAL years must pass before Disney reissues the movie again, and there is absolutely no evidence that the company will EVER heed the general outcry for THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL to be released COMPLETE (as it was in the 1993 Laserdisc version) in WIDESCREEN WITH THE SONG INTACT IN A HIGH-RESOLUTION FORMAT--all at the same time!

Some say that the original theater release (of perhaps a couple of months duration) lacked the song and, thus, the 2012 releases are ""true"" to the original. That may be true, but can that possibly trump the fact that all home video versions in the US have included the song since 1993, and is therefore the only version nearly anybody has ever known?  There are others who say that Disney made a commercial decision because its surveys indicate that some children wiggle through ""When Love is Gone."" But isn't it hypocritical to be so concerned about childish wiggling when children are regularly traumatized by the shooting of Bambi's mother, the murder of the Lion King's dad, and the decimation of Nemo's whole family, and any number of other atrocities foisted on children over the years in the name of drama. And then, there is the simple fact that TIME has proven that THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL is not just another children's movie; it has become a classic of the first water, a cinematic work of art, on the order of SNOW WHITE, THE WIZARD OF OZ, and SINGING IN THE RAIN. Yet for some inexplicable reason, the Disney company refuses to acknowledge this and continues to treat THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL as only a children's movie! A glance through these reviews should prove that it is as much an important adult movie as a kid's movie. Yes, I'm sure the Blu-Ray shows magnificent ""to-die-for"" high-resolution, but such a PLUS does not outweigh for me the downside that the movie is INCOMPLETE. I suppose I could, as I suggest myself further down, juggle two different formats of the movie in order to play the song in the appropriate spot, but, let's face it, that takes the fun out of the whole experience! I wish I could buy the Blu-Ray in good conscience . . . but that is impossible!

You'd think they could include the complete movie as an ""Easter Egg"" at the very least!

Well, I'm whistling into the wind because, as I type, the movie is FLYING off Amazon's shelves. I'm not sure what that means. Whether customers don't notice or care, whether the discs are being bought mainly for indiscriminating children, you can bet that Disney feels affirmed in their decision to remove the song from the Blu-ray. Very very Sad. For me it's exactly like cutting out ""Over the Rainbow"" from The Wizard of Oz, which, by the way, some executives would have done if they had gotten their way, back in the day. All that I can figure is that the business executives at Disney over the years haven't ever understood that the film (with the song) is a genuine classic, a genuine work-of-art, and should be respected and studied every bit at much as, say, ""Singing in the Rain"" or ""Rashomon"".

The complete version (widescreen and song included) plays perfectly. In every possible way it is perfect: the design, the casting, the songs and music, the costumes, the Muppet humor, the AMAZING attention to detail right out to the edges of the picture (which is why the widescreen version is so important) ... I can go on and on. To NOT keep ""WHEN LOVE IS GONE"" in the film is like cutting out ""Rosebud"" and the snow globe breaking at the beginning of CITIZEN KANE; it is the motivation for everything that happens in the movie. Closer to home, can you imagine the Disney classic SNOW WHITE without the ""Mirror, mirror on the wall"" scene? It too is the motivation for the whole movie. Would SNOW WHITE make sense if that scene was cut?

Purely and simply, ""When Love Is Gone"" should be reinstated. THE BLU-RAY SHOULD BE RECALLED, THE SONG PUT IN ITS PROPER PLACE AND in all subsequent versions of the movie. PERIOD. BTW, it's a beautiful Paul William's song, as wonderful as all the songs in the movie.

My first experience of this movie was the widescreen Laserdisc about 1993. When DVD became a format about 1997, I looked forward to the DVD version of this movie...but I had to wait nine years until 2002...but, guess what? It was a terrible Pan&Scan! I was very disappointed! So, I had to wait until 2005 for the next DVD release...and guess what? There were two versions of the movie on this disc--the same Pan&Scan from the earlier release PLUS a nice widescreen version THAT DID NOT INCLUDE ""WHEN LOVE IS GONE""!  I was so incredibly disappointed!  Well, I rationalized, the NEXT version should correct that mistake and include the WHOLE movie in widescreen.  What a concept! So I waited ANOTHER seven years, and heard the Blu-ray was coming...and guess what...? Well you know the answer to that one!  I've been waiting 19 (nineteen) years for the next high-resolution of this movie beyond Laserdisc, and the Disney Company made the commercial decision this year to REMOVE the song entirely from its 2012 Blu-ray. I FEEL BETRAYED! TOTALLY AND UTTERLY BETRAYED...19 years is a long time...and guess what?  I find I can't watch ABC anymore, the Disney network. I saw LINCOLN the other day, and when I saw that it was partly financed by Disney, I felt sick. The only reason I didn't get up and leave was because my wife was with me. Basically I find myself avoiding anything Disney! My feeling is that all the good that Disney does from now on simply does not make up for this betrayal! It's incomprehensible...and very sad!]]

It's clear that the Disney folks have zero motivation to EVER heed or respect the call to include ""When Love Is Gone"" in a complete Widescreen High-resolution format. Here follows my original 2005 review. At the end are some further thoughts about the abortive Blu-ray.

---------------

Review of 2005 DVD Release:

While the complete widescreen version (WITH the song ""When Love Is Gone"") of this film is worth five+ stars, THIS 2005 DVD IS NOT THAT VERSION. This 2005 DVD release is a mess and gets 3 1/2 stars. See explanation below.)

In Oct. 2002, Disney Home Video released its first DVD formatted THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL.  The response was both pro and con.  The response that was negative dealt with two primary issues:

(1)  That  the 2002 DVD was pan-and-scan (AKA ""full screen"" or ""1.33:1"") instead of widescreen, and, in fact, unlike many DVDs, did not even offer the viewer a choice between pan-and-scan and widescreen.  For fans of the movie who prefer widescreen, this was a great disappointment!

(2)  That the 2002 DVD for Region 2 and perhaps other regions also removed the ""When Love Is Gone"" song.  Disney has not, to my knowledge, offered an explanation for the removal.  I would guess that it was because the song is ""sad"" and someone at Disney probably decided that such a ""sad"" song did not belong on a DVD intended for children.

Thus, that 2002 DVD had TWO strikes against it as far as MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL purists were concerned. At the Amazon site for that earlier DVD, you can find more than 130 reviews, many of which express PROFOUND disappointment about the lack of widescreen and the missing song. (Note: Amazon has unaccountably merged those 2002 reviews with the 2005 reviews. Just got toward the end of the list to see the older reviews.)

Fast forward to 2005, just a couple of months ago.  Disney announced a new release of this film--The Muppet Christmas Carol - Kermit's 50th Anniversary Edition.  Eager fans immediately assumed that this would be the long-awaited anamorphic widescreen version. However, various statements and press releases listed the movie as 1.33:1 or, in other words, pan-and-scan.  When this was discovered, the fans HOWLED at what seemed like a betrayal and an absence of common-sense by the people at Disney.  THEN, within a few days of the official announcement, Disney ""back-peddled"" and issued a new announcement that the first one was in error and that the 50th Anniversary version would be in BOTH pan-and-scan and widescreen.  The ***SIGH*** of relief was like a wind that rushed across the globe!

But now comes the TRICKY PART that tries to answer your specific question.  Some fans who have contacts within the industry or have means of mining the Internet, discovered that the CONTENT of the pan-and-scan and the widescreen versions that would be on the same disc would be different in that one would have the afore mentioned song and one would not. As mentioned HERE in these reviews for this new release, apparently the version to contain the song is the pan-and-scan version--which, if it's true--is a totally incomprehensible creative decision. (Why would the the version that was TRUE to the widescreen format be missing the song, thereby compromising that version?)

Right now, as a GIANT FAN of MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL, who has longed for a widescreen DVD since the advent of DVD, I am hoping that there has been some miscommunication going on (for example, look above at the official aspect ratio listed in the Product Details. On today's date of Oct. 13, 2005, it's listed as 1.33:1, so the facts about this release seem to be unfortunately garbled!)

Incidentally, there exists a WIDESCREEN (though obviously not anamorphic) Laserdisc version of the film that INCLUDES the song ""When Love Is Gone.""  I know because I own it . . . and it is among my most precious possessions!!

All we can do is wait until November 29 to find out what this new release will truly hold.  I  personally hope there will be an anamorphic widescreen version that also includes ""When Love Is Gone.""

ADDENDUM:  Well, yesterday was November 29, 2005, and I picked up this DVD.  There's good news, bad news, and some qualified good news.  The anamorphic widescreen image far exceeds any previous video or DVD version.  However, the rumours are TRUE that the widescreen does NOT include the wonderful song ""When Love Is Gone,"" and that the fullscreen version DOES include it as ""Extended with Deleted Scene.""  However, for the diehard, there is this awkward-but-workable compensation:  The two versions are on the same side of the DVD, thus when the widescreen version comes to the point when the song should be sung, you can use your remote to go back to the menu, choose fullscreen, go to chapter 5, listen to the song, and then go back to widescreen to view the rest of this glorious Christmas movie. It is a BIG pain and an unfathomably poor decision by the suits at Disney!

Since a complete widescreen version obviously does exist in the Disney archives (the Laserdisc version in the mid 90s was both widescreen AND complete), one can only wonder how and why Disney made this very insensitive and unprofessional decision!

Neverthless, FINALLY having MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL in anamorphic widescreen is definitely a plus. Being able to see all the Muppet antics clear to the sides of the screen is a pure joy, and not being forced to watch tastelessly SQUISHED images is a tremendous relief! Also, this disk is the best resolution (though not perfect) that has ever been available in any home media format, and the Dolby Digital sound is quite acceptable.

Since this is likely to be the last DVD version of this movie for quite some time, we should (1) continue to ponder Disney's callous obliviousness and its clear childish stubbornness to do what's right, while (2) counting our blessings that at least we are nonetheless PART way to the ideal MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL DVD.

Talk about MIXED emotions!  I think that one problem is that nobody at Disney is clear that the film is a true WORK OF ART, instead of ""just a movie stamped out for kids."" I think nobody there realizes that the film deserves far more respect than the grudging, lackluster, shoddy efforts they have so far foisted on the public.  I am very pleased to see the many astute reviewers for this new edition over and again make this point exceedingly clear!  THE WORST OF IT IS THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!

BTW, on November 29, 2005, Garan Grey posted a review mentioning several EXCELLENT points underscoring Disney's faulty decision-making--especially about the lackluster special features, recycled menu design, and so forth, in what is supposed to be a very special ""special edtion""!  However, this reviewer says: ""By the way, it seems that the ""widescreen"" version is just matted down from the full 35mm 1.33 frame, so the fullscreen version is not missing any of the picture."" In point of fact, ALL pan&scan versions that I have seen (INCLUDING the pan&scan on this very disc) SQUISHES the titles, cuts Muppets off the sides of the movie, and even sometimes squishes scenes so the characters look tall and skinny.  Which is WHY I have been waiting for the widescreen for years!  In general, I'd say that Garan Grey is definitely incorrect on this point.

What follows are some of my thoughts on hearing about the abortive 2012 Blu-ray:

To Whom It May Concern At Walt Disney Studios: This Movie Is A Work Of Art

It is worth listing here the various versions of the movie that have been released at different times:

(b) First VHS release in PAN & SCAN and WITH ""When Love is Gone""
(c) The Laserdisc release which is COMPLETE because it is BOTH in widescreen and includes ""When Love is Gone""
(d) The first US DVD release in PAN & Scan and WITH ""When Love is Gone""
(e) The first UK DVD release in PAN & SCAN and WITHOUT ""When Love is Gone""
(f) The second US DVD release, which includes ""b"" and ""d"" above plus ""a"" above

Nobody involved in the production wanted the song removed -- it was taken out by the studio because they felt little kids would get bored during it.

... which means I'm not buying it.

Sorry, Disney, but I refuse to spend my money on a sub-standard presentation, no matter how HD it is.

The story of A Christmas Carol is about Ebenezer Scrooge, not the Muppets. His character arc is the most important factor. Michael Caine gives a fantastic performance, and his greatest moment is during this scene as he tries to sing with the woman that Ebenezer loved and lost -- and he winds up losing his emotional control, unable to finish the song. This is why he turns to the Ghost of Christmas Past and says, ""Spirit, show me no more. Why do you delight in torturing me?""

If ""When Love Is Gone"" is not included, that question has no meaning.

But when they started making it into movies they started to screw it up.  Some of the movies were great, some were awful to the point where they make me when to kick Tiny Tim.  It was if something was missing.
When I saw this movie on the big screen, with my Dad, when it first came out I realized what was missing.
Charles Dickens voice!  That third person voice of the writer that fills in the details and tells us what we need to know about the history, background, and characters.  His voice sets the mood and helps keep the story moving.  Good thing for us Gonzo was there to stand in for Dickens.  No, really, it makes it one of the best movies to ever follow the story - Gonzo as Dickens really helps keep the setting and mood of the original.
Also, Kermit, Miss Piggy, and Michael Caine REALLY help bring it all together.  And, yes, Michael Caine sings.  This IS a musical!

179342,2,078885996X,"There is no question that this movie is a well-written and well-directed re-make of Charles Dickens' classic.
However I am used to The Muppets' TV shows and other movies being very, very funny. If a lot of light-heartedness is what you are expecting from this film, you will be disappointed and maybe caught off guard. If you are sad/depressed during the winter holidays and think that this film will lift your spirits- no, it probably won't. It has a few scenes that will make you laugh. Much of this movie, though is a very grim,in-your-face, reminder of real life situations that we often  hope to escape briefly during the winter holidays, such as being trapped in an abusive workplace,of having a child with a serious medical problem from which they may not recover,or of the crushing agony of a broken love affair or marriage. Additionally the scene in the desolate,deserted cemetery is quite a bit longer than it needs to be for a Muppets movie.
The music is beautiful, but some of the selections are about such excruciating,bone-scraping pain that I doubt they would even be appropriate for a funeral.
Yes, the original Dickens classic is partly about the above-mentioned, painful situations. Yet I have seen extremely lighthearted renditions of this play done very well by other performers and there is no reason that The Muppets couldn't have lightened the tone of this considerably.
If one wants to see a very funny re-make of this movie that still manages to make a strong point and touch viewers' hearts,I recommend instead, ""Scrooged"" from 1988.
If one wants to see the subject matter of the play taken more seriously, perhaps the original version of ""A Christmas Carol"" would be a more emotionally uplifting choice than ""The Muppets' Christmas Carol.""",1327363200,2,1766,4.946127946127946

Don't pretend you can't hear all the people who are anxiously waiting on you to make the version of a widescreen as an un-cut version.  What's so hard about an extra 2 minutes on the disc?  I would have gladly traded the full-screen version for a wide-screen uncut.  And I think, judging from everyone else's feedback, that they would have preferred that also.  What exactly do you have against that song?  It was good enough for the original release (thank goodness!) and so it should remain uncut now.  I will not buy this DVD until it is, in fact, un-cut.

179407,5,078885996X,"Admittedly being biased because Charles Dickens ""A Christmas Carol"" is my favorite Christmas story, and I am a big fan of the Muppets, I can say without fear of contradction this film is very well done.  It follows remarkably close to the original Dickens version, except of course in some scenes where Waldorf and Statler play the ""Marley Brothers"", and the narration by ""Gonzo Dickens"" and Rizzo Rat.  Even here, however, Gonzo quotes lines from the orignal tale.

Michael Caine was an excellent, if understated, Scrooge, but I imagine they did not want the character of Scrooge to steal the show.  I was most amazed at the the human only scene where Scrooge's long lost love is bidding him farewell.  The song ""Where Love Has Gone"" was astoundingly sweet and very poignant.  The young actress singing the song was superb, and the tears in Michael Caine's eyes appeared to be genuine; touched by the sadness of the moment. It was a stunning metamorphosis away from the fast paced comedic routines into an adult drama.

As usual with Muppet epics, you have to watch it several times to see all the activity in the various scenes, because there is so much going on in the background.  If I recall correctly, this movie was the first attempt to continue the Muppet tradition after the death of Jim Henson.  His son Brian, did an excellent job as the voice of Kermit.  His voice sounded very close to Jim's, almost what a younger version of Jim's voice would sound like.

And certainly one of my favorites from my childhood. But this DVD only gets 1 star due to unfathomable decisions made by Disney.

I really, really wish I had taken the time to read the reviews before buying this DVD. If I had known that the widescreen version of the film had had the gorgeous song ""When Love Is Gone"" cut out I NEVER would have spent my money on this. Sure you can see the song in the fullscreen version, but the image quality is so degraded that it's almost not worth it. It is absolutely ridiculous in this day and age that things like this still occur. Just another atrocious decision by Disney, doing something simply because they can.

I highly recommend not purchasing this DVD. Maybe if people stop buying this then Disney might be forced to release it the way it should be. A movie in it's entirety.

Don't be fooled - this is not for kids only!! Our family started watching this movie years ago and the kids have grown into teenagers and still won't part with our annual viewing!  At first it was especially appealing because some of the scarier and darker parts were so much easier for them to watch when a Muppet character was involved.

I preface I just finished writing a two-star review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disney-s-A-Christmas-Carol/dp/B003ZVJFFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disney's A Christmas Carol</a>, a film I thought might supplant the Muppets version as our family's favorite Dickens adaptation. Unfortunately, Robert Zemeckis and Jim Carrey, having failed to learn the lesson ""less is more"" created a jarring mess that lacks the charm needed for repeat viewings.

Brian Henson directs his musical adaptation with an even tone (heartwarming and funny). Whether your children are familiar with the Muppets or not, the movie is accessible for young children (think ages 5 to 10) thanks to Gonzo the Great's gentle narration (as Charles Dickens). My sons could easily follow the story and understand the messages of love and good will toward all.

The cast is a mix of Muppets and human actors with Michael Caine in the lead as Scrooge. Caine's Scrooge is kid-friendly, not so mean and cruel as to be nightmare-inducing. Yet, he manages a heartwarming transformation with each ghost visit that ultimately leaves Miss Piggy (as Bob Cratchit's wife, Emily) speechless.

My sons (ages 8 and 6) first enjoyed this DVD in the comfort of our home. I think that might be a key reason why the movie received such harsh reviews when released in December 1992.

The first gives us the 16:9 anamorphic widescreen picture of the original theatrical release (and the framing of the scenes is definitely better, as that's the way it was shot)...But the signature song ""When Love Has Gone"" has, once again, been inexplicably deleted, which considerably dilutes the impact of the moment, particularly as it is reprised in the closing credits with (now) no earlier referent.

The second includes the missing song... But is formatted for a 4:3 ratio vacuum tube TV screen (and when was the last time you saw one of those?)

So, even though this is a short review, I gave it four stars because I really do love the movie.  I know every song and I can quote every line.  But, I just wish that I had known before I had gone out and bought it that it was going to be missing Belle's song.

Other than that, I haven't seen the Kermit's 50th anniversary version of this movie, so I can't say whether or not the song was put back in, but I still think that (if you haven't seen this movie before) then it's definitely worth checking out.",1291334400,,809,4.147435897435898

All I can say is wow, this film is even better than I remember. Gonzo and Rizzo-the-Rat narrate the story, and in each appearance they are hilarious. Kermit and the rest of the usual Muppet cast are in it too. Even if you don't have kids, you'll probably enjoy this film.

The acting and production values are top-notch. Michael Caine is a great Scrooge, and the sets and lighting are well done and look beautiful. It pretty much stays true to the original Christmas Carol story too. Even if you own a VHS copy, I say go for this DVD version. It's been digitally remastered and looks great. Plus it has a Wide Screen version.

Note: To access the Wide Screen version, just go to the main menu, then choose Set Up, then choose Audio & Video Options, then select Widescreen. It really does have a more cinematic feel than the full-screen version.

I watched the Wide Screen version (which I recommend), and unlike some other reviewers, the absence of the ""When Love is Gone"" song didn't detract anything from the film. However, the song is on the full-screen version (also on this disc). If you really want to see it, you can always pause after the Fozziewig party scene and go over to the full-screen version and watch the song (of course, go back to Wide Screen when the song is over).

For those who doubt whether the song was really intended to be part of the teatrical release, I would politely point out that the song is reprised around the dinner table at Bob and Emily's house at the end of the film, PLUS, it is featured as part of the music over the closing credits, in a version that was clearly designed for radio airplay.

""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" is extremely comfortable with the specific way it wants to tell Dickens' story, and by definition, is different from any other telling of the classic tale.  The risks it takes with the story pay off hugely, and the  warmth, humor and overall skill that went into this production is obvious.

Starring Michael Caine as Ebenezer Scrooge, it features only a very small number of visible human actors.  They are not missed, as the vast majority of characters are played by Muppets.  There is Kermit The Frog as Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy as Emily Cratchit,(in this version Bob's wife gets a proper name)and Gonzo as Charles Dickens himself, among many other Muppet characters.  The inclusion of a Dickens surrogate is particularly nice, as it functions like an anchor to the original story while also providing an entertaining main narrator for this variation of it.

Also featuring a number of beautiful songs and a great script, ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" is unique and timeless.",1271030400,,1023,5.0476190476190474

My recommendation is based on 2 factors:

Entertainment
1) For me, this is easily the most entertaining film version of A Christmas Carol. Faithful to Dickens and filled with laughs and heart, it stands up to repeat viewing better than any other version. This includes comparison to 2009's very lackluster, 3D animated version by Disney/Zemekis.

Commentary
2) Brian Henson's commentary is great. Many DVD commentaries (by directors, actors, writers, producers) is spartan and/or self-serving. Brian speaks throughout, giving insight into the writing, directing, acting and (most interestingly) secrets of muppeteering. Very enlightening.",1261872000,,742,5.7272727272727275

179467,5,078885996X,"This review is regarding the ORIGINAL DVD release and is not referring to later releases, including the 50th Anniversary release.

Considering this was the first film made after the passing of Jim Henson, the chances of it being a flop were huge, but I, for one, am not disappointed.  It is my favorite book of all time.  I have seen countless versions in film, and this is my second favorite.  (The Alistair Sim version is the best version there is.)

True, the Muppets (except Gonzo and Rizzo) are not necesssarily true to their Muppet characters, but they are very well cast in the roles they play in the story.  As a matter of fact, I can't stand Robin - at all - but he doesn't bother me as Tiny Tim.  There is, sadly, not nearly enough of Louie the Boomerang Fish Thrower, but that can be said of every Muppet film.  The creators have even creatively fit characters that you wouldn't normally ""cast"" in the story very smoothly - including the Swedish Chef and Dr. Teeth & the Electric Mayhem.

I cannot accurately say what is missed on the edges of the screen, but considering the Muppets are the masters at background details, I can trust other reviewers who say there are bits that can't be seen.

The ""deleted"" song.
**Sigh**
I'm not sure what everyone is talking about as my version - groan - HAS ""When Love is Gone.""  Perhaps there are other releases that did not include it.  For the purists, I understand that we SHOULD NOT EVER edit movies from their original theatrical versions.  I can't even stand all the ""director's cuts"" that come out.  I don't mind deleted scenes as a DVD feature, but they should not run during the film - unless they include two versions on the disk.  Here are my two cents about the song.  I HATE it.  It should not even have been in the theatrical version (which it was). It's a decent melody (reprised later in the finale) with mediocre lyrics, sung poorly by a character that the audience has only seen in one scene prior, which is not nearly enough time to care about her.  (Just as a side note, we barely know this character in Dickens' original text, which is even more reason NOT to have her sing.) We watch this movie every year on Christmas Eve morning, and we ALWAYS skip this ridiculous, plot-slowing song.

Michael Caine is a brilliant Scrooge.  As another review stated he is not a caricature of greed so often portrayed, and this makes his change at the end much more logical and realistic.  He clearly has studied many other versions, and his performance rivals that - and often imitates - that of Alistair Sim in the 1951 version - which is probably why I like him so much in this role.  Although it IS the first time we have a human main character, I can't think of a Muppet I would like to play this role, so I don't mind too much.

Those are my thoughts.  I have no compalints about anything, really.  It's a great film - very well done, although I can see why some would be upset about the edges cut off.  If a scene - however dreadful it might be - is cut from other releases, that is a TRAVESTY, and I wish there was a way to boycott without denying myself gems such as the Muppet films.",1248825600,,3150,4.397236614853195

179470,5,078885996X,"Michael Caine plays a believable Scrooge surrounded by a supporting cast of fuzzy characters.  The plot is surprisingly close to the book, making this a good introduction to the story, and the sound track has some very nice songs that work outside of the film as well as in. One feature that makes this especially useful for families with small children is the fact that Gonzo and Rizzo ""exit"" the film just before it gets ""scary.""  So if you are afraid the Ghost of Christmas Future will creep out the very small ones (it probably won't, but you be the judge), you just tell them to close their eyes, then you zap ahead until you see Gonzo again.

179471,5,078885996X,"In terms of humor or songs, I can't honestly rank this was high as most of the other Muppet films BUT it may be the most touching version of the Dickens classic story I've ever seen on film.

The lyrics to the last two songs are fantastic: very Christian-like and very profound. Scrooge (Michael Caine), meanwhile, is not portrayed as some screaming maniac as he so often is in other versions. His transformation from cold-hearted tightwad to caring, generous person is done more subtly, too, than in other films. However, to be fair, sometimes the slapstick humor in here gets in the way of the touching story.

The last part of the movie is a lot sentimental drama than Muppet comedy and I found that refreshing. Not much offensive in here, either, making this a good film for little ones as well as  us older, sentimental folks.",1237852800,,831,4.639455782312925

Michael Caine, one of the few human actors/actresses, does an award winning performance, while the muppet characters really add to the production especially to the lighter side.  It is not the same old Christmas Carol performed many times down through the years, but light and airy at places and down right dramatic, tear jerking, and elevating at others.  We have made this a family tradition for many many years. I had the VHS copy originally and then the DVD and finally got this one as a backup.(I loan the one copy out at times) I am not really sure it is a young childrens movie, there are some spots that might be scary to them and definitely areas that they would not understand (heavy drama) and probably boring.

As celebratory of the coming lesson that love tempers living so that a life has meaning both in the good your love does and the good done for you in loving communication in community.
Clear. There is the possibility of redemption. (But you need to act on it for you are the key.)
And thus you have the start of a Dickens type tale; we lose a puppetering man through his love of both his art and what it can bring us. A kind of delicate tragedy if you think too hard. We could use him in entertainment, to comment to us as a group of these tragic times of rich and unseen poor or really scrapping hated poor. We own this DVD and the old VHS in my house, and did read these reviews here thoughtfully and interested on the screen size issues that are annoying, the deleted song and the specs. Very true issues that abounded after his death-access to Henson great's not always so easy. ( Lots of work to get Big Bird in China and Big Bird in Japan alone true classics<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sesame-Street-Big-Bird-In-Japan-Big-Bird-in-China-2-Pack/dp/B000XJJIBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sesame Street - Big Bird In Japan / Big Bird in China (2 Pack)</a>&nbsp;or the signing pieces&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sesame-Street-Sign-Language-ABC-with-Linda-Bove-Pictureback-R/dp/0394875168/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sesame Street Sign Language ABC with Linda Bove (Pictureback(R))</a>)

But we are glad as a family of true Henson fans to have this movie re-issue for use in teaching the tale of the miser that transformed his life by facing the ghosts of his past that held him, looking at the present of lost/losing opportunity,  and then bravely deferring to look into the cold grave of the future. To try to write a better page in the book of living. It's a really awesome story. Ageless. Great fun.

I've staged this Dickens tale with children, taught it, used it to speak to values and to simply have an interesting experience with my kids. It led to lots of different kinds of fascinating dramas and insights over the years. Children at the age I teach understand little of banking, money and judging by conversations held in parent conferences understand very little older too. Isn't it amazing that after years of school many don't really get banking (or the way their giving to others works too or how to be more self reliant less product dependent) not much better than you see in this show. In fact you learn a lot that certainly applies today.... Well anyway you must know that as Scrooge, the dreamy Michael Caine, is perfect. The tunes curl around you and settle you in for some real ghostly truths to be revealed. My favorite part is when under the skirts of Christmas Present who is so big, brash, bold, jolly, you find Ignorance and her sisters Want, Need I think...it's such an effective image..of our blindnesses.(okay I liked Scrooge's song too when movie starts, a lot, well done) Dickens wrote to move people to different understandings to bring about social change in a highly divided and boundaried society. Henson  is  no slacker either in this undercurrant of societal potential for transformation once meme-ed into structures to be "" more aware.""( His TV show of old the Muppet's often reminding me of the Smother's Brothers, a wake up call)

Pick this up as a stocking stuffer or to give to a youngster and they'll have an experience where literature isn't drained of its sound and feel and turned to pablum or homogenized to dust and stuck in a basal as Mr. Scrooge Gets Three New Transparent Friends ( teaching ""scr""). Artists tend to work within talents to transform us. This does. Great movie.

Maybe the sad song is a bit TOO sad for some children, at certain times, in certain situations, but that's what the fast forward button is for!

Attempting to celebrate Christmas without watching at least ONE adaptation of this Dickens classic is a bit like trying to play snooker in black and white. Each year I try to watch one 'serious' adaptation (usually the 1951 Alastair Sim classic) and also one parody. Of the latter, the 1992 Muppet production tops the list. Michael Caine is Scrooge, while Kermit the frog is Bob Cratchett and Gonzo plays Charles Dickens. I dislike most musicals. It's often stated that Bollywood is the complete reverse of the Roger & Hammerstein / Gilbert & Sullivan musicals because in India it's the dialogue that's woeful and music that's good. The Muppet Christmas Carol is in a league of its own and actually excels at both! The soundtrack includes ""Bless us All"", ""One More Sleep till Christmas"" and the wonderfully festive ""It Feels Like Christmas"". Here, the songs ENRICH the story rather than interrupt it.

Dickens's haunting tale and the countless movies it's inspired are not just for children. Christmas joy is, in the words of Ella Fitzgerald, ""for kids from 1 to 92"". This is genuine 'family' entertainment...

Please note this is my review on the movie itself, not any of it's Home Video Releases. I see there is much disappointment about the DVDs. I have it on good old VHS, which still works and still has ""Love is Gone.""

A Muppet Christmas Carol is a superb adaption of the Dicken's Classic. Michael Caine plays Ebenezer Scrooge. There are a few other humans, particularly Scrooge's nephew Fred, but almost all the other cast are played by Muppets. Kermit the Frog plays the ever suffering Cratchit, Miss Piggy is his loving wife. In a stroke of genius, though it's a small part, Fozzie the Bear plays Scrooge's old employer Fozziwig, who runs a Rubber Chicken Factory. Statler and Waldorf are Scrooge's deceased business partners, the Marleys. Sam the Eagle, Professor Bunsen Honeydew, Beaker, Animal, and many others make appearances. The Ghosts are played by original Muppets. Past is a small child-like creature, glowing with his hair and gowns billowing in an unseen wind. Future is a huge dark shrouded creature with no face and long arms. The Ghost of Christmas Present is a wonderfully fun giant, who can change size at will, ages as Christmas passes, and in a very unique turn is absent minded because he is so consumed with the ""Now"" of Christmas.

""So this is Bob Cratchit's house?"" Scrooge asks.
""Who told you that?"" the Ghost of Christmas Present asks in astonishment.
""You just did,"" Scrooge replies.
""Hm! Well I'm usually reliable!""

But the best part of all is Gonzo the Great plays Charles Dickens himself. Rizzo the Rat accompanies him, mostly for the food. But as Dickens, Gonzo quotes the book almost word for word at times and acts as an omniscient narrator. I know of no other Christmas Carol that features Dickens himself in it, even if he is furry and purple, and this a superb development.
-The music is great and the songs are a lot of fun. The songs are better and more enjoyable than Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol and catchier than Scrooge, the big budget version. The special effects are astonishing. When the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come takes Scrooge into the future, the scene swirls into a tunnel and London forms around the two - a phenomenal effect. And when you think about it, almost every scene is a special effect, because there are Muppeteers operating the Muppets, or perhaps visuals or robotics. Add to that rain, snow, live animals such as a horse or a chicken, and it must have been an incredible undertaking.
-London itself looks astonishing; snow covered houses, street lamps, bricked pavement, activity everywhere, the buildings themselves are all stylized with hardly a straight line among them.
-Children will love the Muppets, songs, and humor. Adults will love the Muppets, songs, and humor as well! And everyone will love the great Christmas sentiments.

""Nice story, Mister Dickens,"" Rizzo the Rat says at the end.
""Thanks"" Gonzo replies. ""If you like that, you should try the book.""

179524,4,078885996X,"Jim Henson's ever irresistible Muppets takes on the famous Charles Dickens ""Christmas"" classic, with genuinely pleasing results.  The story, as everyone probably knows by now, centers on one Ebenezer Scrooge, a greedy and mean-spirited moneylender who thinks only of money and can only respond to Christmas with ""bah, humbug!""  On Christmas Eve, he receives an unexpected visit from his deceased business partners, who warn him that three spirits will transport him to his past, present, and future.  Grudgingly, Scrooge goes along with the spirits, and eventually realizes that his selfish acts will provide not only drastic consequences for himself, but for the welfare of his long-suffering clerk, Bob Cratchit, and his sickly son, Tiny Tim.

The film follows the original tale faithfully, and more importantly, keeps most of the dark, sometimes dreary tone of Dickens' tale.  Since the story has its share of heartbreaking moments, it is surprising that this movie, skillfully directed by Brian Henson, manages to handle them in a very emotional way without coming across as forced or out of place.  Scenes such as Scrooge witnessing the departure of his former love Belle and an even more devastating sequence where the Cratchit family mourns the loss of their beloved, frail son (keep in mind that this is only a vision) all manage to tug at the right heartstrings effectively.

Naturally, the Muppets do sneak in ways to provide a bit of humor in various places, but in an adaptation like this, it is most welcome.  Actually, most of the laughs come from the Great Gonzo as Charles Dickens, who narrates the story to a skeptical Rizzo Rat as the latter questions about whether the ""scary stuff"" is appropriate for children.  ""That's all right, this is culture,"" explains Gonzo, er, Dickens, respectively.

It is a treat to see Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy as the Cratchits and even more amusing to see those old tycoons Statler and Waldorf as the ghosts of Scrooge's deceased business partners, but the whole weight of the movie rests on the performance of Michael Caine as Mr. ""Bah Humbug"" himself.  He plays the role flawlessly, somehow managing to blend in with his Muppet and human co-stars.  Also noteworthy are the creation of the spirits themselves:  Christmas Past is a ghostly-like child, Present is a jolly, Santa Claus like giant, while Future is a dark-robed, faceless figure who is made all the more scary by the fact that he is mute.  Paul Williams' musical numbers are also very sprightly and infectiously catchy, well-suited to both the spirit of Christmas and the story itself.

All in all, THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL is great family entertainment, but even adults may find a lot to enjoy too.",1198368000,,2719,4.9977827050997785

179529,4,078885996X,This production is a very worthy addition to the many versions of Dickens' classic A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  The Muppets' rendition stays fairly close to the original work with lots of comic relief added by the famous puppets particularly Gonzo playing Charles Dickens himself as an all knowing narrator always accompanied by his sidekick Rizzo the Rat.  As one would expect from a classic story retold by the Muppets this is family friendly fare though to be honest I personally find their interpretation of the Ghost of Christmas Past with her mask life face and little girl voice really creepy.  As in most productions the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come is portrayed in Grim Reaper fashion which also could be disturbing to young kids.  The songs by Paul Williams are good but not quite as good as those in the Broadway musical adaptation of SCROOGE or in the surprisingly excellent Mr. Magoo version of the story.  Michael Caine makes a great live action Scrooge but George C. Scott's portrayal is still my favorite.  Still I love the Muppets and I love Charles Dickens so I have to recommend this movie to anyone looking for a well rendered holiday film for all ages.,1197763200,,1166,4.747524752475248

179534,4,078885996X,"Having watched 50 years of versions of ""A Christmas Carol"", I believe that Michael Caine is the best Scrooge ever, topping even Finney. The muppet casting is perfect for the original characters of the story. The humor is satisfying (even the fifth time around) and the direction is well done so it has become a classic that I pull out each Christmas. Hence the four stars (which should be five to this point).

What's the Disappointment? Although I have the 2002 version, I bought this one for the ""widescreen"" and hoping it would be digitally remastered. What a disappointment! I think what they must have done to get the 'widescreen' effect was go in closer on the Pan-and-Scan because you have the tops of 'people's' heads hitting the top of the screen. Some scenes seem remastered, others not.

Cutting the song, ""When Love is Gone"", is jarring. I am not a fan of the song but Michael Caine's grief at what he has lost is the turning point in the movie for Scrooge, as Caine himself says in the 2002 interview which is not on this DVD revision (why not?). You have lost the whole point of the story if you cut this scene. I could not believe it!!!

Walt Disney understood family and children in a way that his successors do not. Jim Henson understood the value of all the emotions and the necessity of humor as few others have. Neither of them would have cut that scene. Artistically, I cannot believe that Brian Henson would have wanted it cut and I cannot believe that the Disney studios of today care two hoots about children (the shoddy productions of the Disney Channel are enough of an argument, I think.) Therefore, my recommendation is buy the 2002 version until Disney wakes up and does the justice to this film that it deserves.",1196812800,4,1742,4.576923076923077

It's certainly far and away the best screen adaptation of Dickens perennial even if Michael Caine's Scrooge is more game than great (George C. Scott is probably the definitive version of Dickens Scrooge while Alastair Sim is the the most beloved, but that's another story in a much lesser movie). Aside from the real visual imagination on display, from the wonderfully stylised production design and warm photography to Jerry Juhl's genuinely witty script, it's also the only version I've seen that passes the Tiny Tim test: usually the part is played by such obnoxiously saccharine little tykes that you can't wait for that empty place by the fireside, but in this case you really do care for once. Pure greatness in every frame.

Unfortunately, the care shown with the feature has not been mirrored with the DVD, which has never had a satisfactory release anywhere to date. The widescreen version is still missing a key musical number, 'When Love is Gone' (which features only on the fullframe version), which is particularly unfortunate since its absence leaves a gaping hole in the Christmas Past section of the movie. Also, the 22-minute making of documentary from the previous release has also been dropped.

That in fact the last place the Ghost of Christmas Past takes him is to Belle's home with her husband & children, showing Scrooge what he lost to his greed.

179566,5,078885996X,"This is the one Christmas movie that I watch every single year. If you like muppets, buy this movie.

To clarify, the DVD release contains two versions of the movie. The wide screen version is the original theatrical version in which the song between Scrooge and his fiance does not appear. This was not cut out for the DVD--the the original version of the movie that was released to the theatre simply did not contain the song.

The song does appear in the full screen version which is the original-released-to-video version for which they reinserted the song.

The above information is from the Brian Henson commentary included on the disc. Mr. Henson quite liked the song and that is why it reappeared when it was released on video.

Myself, I'm thrilled to have the original no-love-song version since I always fast forwarded through it before. However, it appears that Disney simply put both versions of the movie as they are on the disc without cutting or adding.

  I love this movie and I always put it in when I'm baking christmas cookies. I'm not huge on widescreen...i actually prefer full screen. Annoying little black bars attract my attention. I must comend Disney on making this movie even better by removing a sentimental song from an otherwise funny movie. I'm not fond of romantic, tear jerkers...and that song was sappy as it could be.

My years old LaserDisc will continue to be played each year in December until they are Fired and someone who cares about film comes in to makes Smart decisions.

179569,5,078885996X,"""A Muppet Christmas Carol"" was the first Muppet film to be made after Jim Henson's death, directed by his son Brian Henson and based more or less on the Charles Dicken's novel. I'm a fan of both the muppets, and of Dicken's story, so it was a good combination.

Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine in this version) is a little more crotchety than usual in this film. He is not just in charge of a successful business, but he's in charge of the mortgages of the London townsfolk. He commands a roomful of rats as bookeepers, as well as the mild mannered Bob Cratchitt (Kermit the Frog). The night before Christmas, the ghosts of Jacob and Robert Marley (the Hecklers) come to visit Scrooge to change his ways, along with three ghosts. Charles Dickens (Gonzo) and Rizzo the Rat also visit. Though they're the narrators and know what's going to happen, they want to see it for themselves, and get in more than a bit of trouble for it.

Michael Caine did a really good job as Scrooge, I thought. His Scrooge was a cold man, but more because this Scrooge didn't know any better than deliberately, if that makes sense. I also like the way his character gradually and steadily mellows through the story, you can see it in his face. It was nice to see all the muppets bopping around again, though I wish some of my favorite characters had a bit more time on screen. Ah well. The ghosts of Christmas were great. I always love to see the really big muppets ambling around in these films. There's quite a few songs sung during the story, which I'm not the biggest fan of, but they fit in with the film pretty well.

Special features include an audio commentary from Brian Henson, a ""Christmas Around the World"" skit with Gonzo and Rizzo, a gag reel (which is actually pretty funny) and a making of documentary.

Those who disliked the song are probably those, like columnist Roger Ebert, who were unmoved by the classic Dickens story because, in essence, they just don't get it - the theme of a repentant heart.

Jim Henson (the creator of the Muppets) had been dead, dead as a door-nail, for two years when this Muppet movie was made.  His son, Brian Henson, manned the helm for this entertainment venture, and the results are pretty good.

Oh, the cleverness and imagination that marked ""The Muppet Show"" and ""The Muppet Movie"" are not in full force here, but they are here, and those of us who loved those earlier Muppet capers will get a satisfying portion of the ... entertainment ingenuity that Jim Henson was famous for.

This puppeted version of ""A Chrsitmas Carol"" is surprisingly faithful to the original story (as it was written by Charles Dickens).

Michael Caine plays Scrooge, and I think it is among his best efforts as an actor.  He clearly took the role seriously, and his performance bumps the movie up a grade (as quality entertainment).  Most of the other characters are, of course, played by Muppets.  Well known roles are filled by well known Muppets ... which is fun.  The few other parts that are played by people are played by very good acting people (I felt) ... not name actors, but good ones none-the-less.  However, Muppets abound!

The original songs for ""A Muppet Christmas Carol"" were written by Paul Williams, which would incline us to expect some pretty good stuff, but he (Williams) does not come through for us here.  They're not terrible songs, however, just not memorable ones.

179598,3,078885996X,"""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" is arguably one of the greatest interpretations of Charles Dickens' classic Ghost Story of Christmas. With equal parts humor and heart, it perfectly balances that stylish Muppet humor with big emotion and depth. It does so without ever condescending to the children that make up its core audience. Michael Caine gives a phenominal performance as the crotchety curmudgeon, Ebeneezer Scrooge, and the film boasts the best score of any of the Muppet films.

The heart of any version of A Christmas Carol is the crucial scene involving Scrooge's long-lost love, Belle (or in some cases Emily). This scene is crucial to both character and story - this is when Scrooge's frozen heart begins to melt, giving credibility to his dramatic change at the end of the story. Even the Jim Henson company knew better to fiddle with this emotionally raw scene, allowing the fairly long sequence, told largely in song, to play without a single beat of humor.

The song, entitled ""When Love is Gone,"" was inexplicably removed from the original theatrical release. In removing the sequence, Disney destroyed any beievability from the tale, leaving the film feeling unfinished and choppy. When the VHS was released in 1992, the song was put back into the film. This is not only the purist version of the film, but the one that feels most complete.

With this 50th anniversary Special Edition DVD, Disney has made one of the most disastrous creative decisions in recent memory. The DVD boasts both Widescreen and Fullscreen formats, but ""When Love is Gone"" is disappointingly present only in the Fullscreen format. Also, in using a single-sided duel layer disc, the film's visual presentation is sacrificed. This grainy, lackluster ""Special Edition"" presentation undermines the film's quality, leaving the buyer wanting more.

The bonus features are almost more of a disappointment then the film's presentation on the disc. Containing only a brief (and terribly unfunny) gag reel, a documentary with no relevance to the movie, and a restrained commentary from director Brian Henson, one feels cheated for gaining no insight into the making of this classic.

""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" is a phenominal movie, and in that respect this is the must-have DVD of the season, however it deserved much better treatment than Disney was willing to supply it. This is a DVD to purchase, but only to have a long-lasting copy of one of the greatest Christmas stories ever told.",1133481600,15,2473,5.08128078817734

179600,1,078885996X,"Update after calling Disney's consumer number:  They of course really aren't there to give out any real information, but here is what I was told:  The upcoming BluRay will be ""The Original Theatrical Version"" in 1.85.  That's all she knew.  Not even any mention of the other version in pan/scan.  Cancelling my pre-order now, as I already have most of what's on the Blu on the two previous DVDs.  I just can't imagine what they are thinking, given the fact that practically everywhere this title is discussed, that song is the number one issue with fans all over the world.

Update after Disney issued a press release stating the feature was ""approximately 89 minutes""  They were wrong.  Another online merchant has begun shipping this title and it has been discovered the Blu Ray contains only the cut version.  Hence the flood of cancelled orders and angry fan response.  I have no reason to buy this version.  I have the first two DVDs with both versions of the film and all the previous supplements.  I won't reward Disney for ignoring its customers.

Review of the last DVD version follows:
While the menus for this disc are almost identical to the previous DVD release, this version is missing the entire Fireside Chat with Brian Henson - a nice behind the scenes look at the making of the film with interviews of Michael Cane and nice bits from the production.  Those and some cute banter between Brian,  Gonzo and Rizzo made this feature fun to watch more than once.  Why leave it out??

The Pepe Profiles Gonzo thing has nothing to do with this film and was a very poor choice to replace the behind the scenes featurette.  Only diehard fans could sit through this thing once.

And yes there is NO good reason for Disney Home Video not to include the entire movie in the widescreen version.  Except maybe that they didn't want to bother to remaster from the original elements.

Another thoughtless decision by Disney Home Video is that everytime you press play you are forced to sit through Disney's obnoxious ""Disney DVD"" title (as if they invented the DVD format) then read the FBI warning and the Copyright warning.  These things belong at the beginning when you insert the disc so they don't corrupt the presentation of the film, but Disney would rather use that space to try to sell you things...

There is then a very long blackout before you actually get to the film.  Long enough to make you think there is something wrong with the disc.

So there is really not much excuse to buy this new release.  There IS a widescreen version but it's missing that crucial song that is argualbly the heart of the movie.  And by squeezing both widescreen and pan/scan versions on the same side, they have compromised picture quality of both.

I frankly regret selling off my copy of the previous edition.  There is nothing here worth buying this again if you have the earlier release.",1133222400,26,2886,4.6686507936507935

While the Widescreen 16:9 version gets the cut version, the Full-Screen Version is touted as the ""Extended Version with Deleted Scene!"" -- what a joke that Disney didn't get this right, giving the cropped pan-and-scan frame the version of the movie any real fan of the movie prefers to see.

I won't even begin to guess the validity of the rumor that this release will only feature the song ""When Love is Gone"" in the 4:3 (fullscreen) version.  However, allow me to explain why, perhaps, that may not be a bad thing for ""purist's.""

When the film was initially released in theaters, Disney cut the song ""When Love is Gone"" because they deemed it to ""adult"" in nature (They also did this with the song ""If I Never Knew You,"" from the film Pocahontas).  When ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" finally made it to TV and VHS (both in 4:3 Fullscreen), Brian Henson insisted that the song be returned to the film.

Therefore, this DVD release may, if the rumor is true, contain two complete versions of the film: the theatrical version (without the song), and the TV/VHS version (with the song).  Unfortunately this goes against the present day trend of: widescreen is for adults, fullscreen is for kids.  I suppose the true ""purist"" would insist that a third version be bundled in this release; a ""Director's Cut"" if you will.

The Muppets are the characters, but people are along for the ride too, such as Michael Caine who stars as Scrooge himself.

The story, with many of the original lines, has all of the joy and sadness of the story, but with so much more liveliness.

Yes, this classic tale has been adapted more times than we may care to mention, but  this particular version is sure to be loved by adults as well as children, making it a perfect family movie. It is warm, funny and very well-acted (by Muppets and humans alike).

What makes this adaptation so wonderful are the humorous antics the Muppets bring to the screen, the brilliant performance of Michael Caine as Ebenezer Scrooge, and the deeply moving original musical scores by Paul Williams. Several bold departures that also work brilliantly -- Marley is actually two characters -- brothers Robert and Jacob Marley. Kermit's Bob Crachit is actually one of several bookkeepers in Scrooge's employ, and the film is narrated by non other than Charles Dickens himself (played by Gonzo) and his admirable companion Rizzo the rat.

Of course, Dickens purists will not agree, but this is truly one of the best adaptations of the classic yet. Michael Caine is BRILLIANT as Scrooge - one of the best performances in this role I have ever seen.

A definite 5 stars!

It was like getting to know old friends all over again. This is also where Gonzo gets more of the spotlight as the narrator Charles Dickens with his sidekick Rizzo the Rat (also getting a little more attention) It's a heartwarming take on an old classic.

My favorite scene is with the ghost of Christmas Present, with his warm friendly demeanor he gave you a nice warm happy feelings, even though you know the dreary future was yet to come. If you can listen to It Feels Like Christmas and not be moved you must be a Scrooge yourself. That song tells us exactly what Christmas is and what it should be all year long.

179619,5,078885996X,"If you've seen one version of A Christmas Carol, you've seen them all! At least that's how I felt when I saw a recent made-for-TV musical version of the Charles Dickens' classic. After all, who doesn't know the story by now? I've written reviews for other filmed versions of A Christmas Carol here on Amazon.com, and you can see that by time I critiqued the one with Patrick Stewart, I wasn't impressed. My personal favorite is the 1984 TV-movie with George C. Scott and unlike many; I didn't really like the one with Alistair Sim (though his performance is without equal). I guess when you pick a favorite, all others seem unoriginal, offering nothing new.

Then there's The Muppet Christmas Carol...now THAT'S original!

Ok, so the story remains the same: in one night, Ebenezer Scrooge learns the meaning of Christmas from several ghostly visitors, transforming his character from bitterness to joyous repent. That hasn't changed, nor should it. It is a musical, but that also is not new, as there's a well known and incredibly long-winded musical called Scrooge starring Albert Finney. And another excellent actor portrays Scrooge in the muppet film, carrying on the tradition of Sim, Scott and Finney.

Nonetheless, the differences are pretty obvious. Most of the (normally human) characters are played by muppets. Kermit the Frog plays Bob Cratchet, Fozzie Bear plays Fezziwig - er - I mean Fozziwig, and, in an odd yet brilliant departure, Gonzo the Great plays Charles Dickens narrating his own tale. The advantage of showcasing muppets instead of human actors is that it allows the characters to be silly and funny in ways their human counterparts cannot. Thus the film becomes more fun in the process. Yet, it never loses its heart, and The Muppet Christmas Carol may well be the most touching of all versions.

The musical numbers in the muppet version are actually very well done. Musicals can become problematic when the songs start to eclipse the action and dialogue. That recent made-for-TV musical I previously mentioned is one such example. This film features about 7 or 8 songs, but feels like only 4 or 5...and that's a good thing. Such songs as ""It Feels Like Christmas"" and ""When Love is Gone"" are enjoyable and poignant...and don't be surprised if you find yourself whistling a couple of the tunes.

A lesser actor might have delivered an over-the-top performance as Ebenezer Scrooge for fear having the show stolen away by his muppet co-stars. But film legend Michael Caine decided to play Scrooge straight. While he does have some fun in the process, Sir Michael gives a real, honest-to-goodness performance here. It shouldn't have come as a surprise, especially to a huge Caine fan like myself. Yet he's an actor who still surprises on occasion. He strikes the perfect balance between humor and sentiment. It's fun to watch Caine sing as well, which is one of those surprises. While he doesn't have the best singing voice, he makes it work because he knows that Scrooge is so happy (at that point in the story) that Scrooge would break out into song, whether he sounded good or not! Michael Caine delivers a wonderful performance and has done the seemingly impossible, stolen much of the film away from muppets!

I, like many others, believe that Disney should produce a special edition DVD of The Muppet Christmas Carol in anamorphic widescreen. I'd also like to see the image cleaned up as the video I have now isn't the highest quality it could be. The film makes such good use of the beautifully elaborate sets and colorful costumes, it's a shame these images are so constricted in the 4:3 pan-and-scan format!

The Muppet Christmas Carol is more than a fun family film. It takes its place among the many fine adaptations of Dickens' classic story. With its warmth, humor and originality, I consider it one of the best!",1102982400,3,3848,4.883614088820827

Can they change his view of the world?

I really didn't know what to expect the first time I saw this movie.  Would the Muppets play it mostly straight or would they ruin one of my favorite Christmas tales.  I immediately fell in love with this version of the story.  It's got some great humor to it, but sticks very close to the story.  In fact, at least half of the movie is taken directly from the book, especially Gonzo's lines as Dickens.  The touches they make for this version are very powerful.  Yet there are lots of great jokes that make it impossible not to laugh the entire way through.  And some great songs enhance the movie.  While a few go on a little too long, there are a couple I'd buy the soundtrack for.

This is a good DVD that could have been great.  The only real drawback is that the movie is cropped to full screen instead of sticking with the original wide screen version.  Other then that, the picture looks great, and the movie sounds great, too.  Director Brian Henson provides an interesting commentary that really opened my eyes to how they create Muppet movies.  There's also a 20 minute feature on the making of the film, some bloopers, and a very short segment on Christmas traditions around the world.

This version of Charles Dicken's classic story - though it may seem silly at first thought - is accurate, moving, and memorable.  My father gave it to us on VHS years ago and it became a family classic.  My father - very much a ""manly man"" - would make time in his busy schedule to watch this with us every Christmas season.  Summer 2002, we gathered around his hospital bed to watch it one more time together as a family.

The music is appropriate and moving from the opening song about Scrooge - ""When a cold wind blows it chills you - chills you to the bone!"" - to the last scene of the friends and family together singing ""The Love We've Found"".  I find myself singing ""It Feels Like Christmas"" months after watching the movie.  All of the music is wonderful!

Perhaps it is the genius of the comedic touch which makes this version so much better than the others.  In typical Muppet style, physical comedy is added to the mix.

Who would ever believe that someone could give such a performance for a silly muppet movie?  Yet Michael Caine somehow takes hold of this role and makes it his own and turns this into a wonderful film of incredible human depth and meaning.  And more interesting is the fact that he plays the role of a Scrooge who is less of an evil man and more of a blind heartless man.  Thats really how Dickens wrote it.  In that regard everyone can see himself as a potential Scrooge and can identify with the things they've done in life which have been Scrooge-like.  I've seen grown men sob and have to leave the room after watching the scene in which Scoorge see's himself as a young man foolishly losing the only woman that ever loved him.  It's a moment in which love dies in his life and he doesn't even know it.  As a young man, he simply walks away - he feels nothing.  But now an old man many years later, he's a broken soul and all he can do is stand behind this lost love, who is now only a shadow of the past and sob in terrible sorrow.  He asks the ghost of christmas past, ""how can you take delight in showing me this?""  With that moment, the truth of life is made reality and he understands the past can never be undone or changed.

What has been taken out I hear you ask? The Song 'When Love is gone.'This song, apart from being a beautifully stunning song, completely makes the scene (Belle tells Ebeneezer that he has made the choice to put his work above her and one day he will regret that decision).I cry almost every time. Granted, the song is played over the credits but that is little comfort. There is still the reprise of the song later in the movie which now doesn't make sense. I was really upset about the lack of one of my favourite songs and I don't think the gag reel special feature quite makes up for it. (Although it is VERY funny.)",1069977600,14,764,4.34965034965035

179634,5,078885996X,"What a great movie!
It's the Muppet Version of A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens. Ebenezer Scrooge is played, not by a muppet but by Michael Caine. Everyone knows not to mess with Ebenezer Scrooge - his penny-pinching ways and bah-humbug attitude could make even the bluest skies cloudy. But when he is alone on Christmas eve, he is visited by three spirits: The Ghost of Christmas Past, The Ghost of Christmas Present and The Spirit of Christmas's Yet To Come - and gets to see the impact that he has had on the world - and it's not a pretty sight! But, along the way he comes across the life of his poor and kind employee, Bob Cratchit (Kermit) and his family including Tiny Tim who teaches Scrooge the true meaning of Christmas and ends the with the immortal words ""God Bless us, everyone.""
This is a great movie to watch for kids and adults! Jim Henson's movies never disappoint! Full of hilarious jokes and good humor for families, and a wonderful performance by Micheal Caine, you and your entire movie will love this movie - and it will hopefully get you out of your Humbug mood and put the Christmas spirit in you too!",1069718400,2,1129,4.485436893203883
179635,5,078885996X,"I do not want to go so far as to say that it is impossible to put together a really unsatisfying version of ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens, first, because I have not seen all of the versions ever made, and, second, because I do not want to tempt the fates.  This is a classic story for which most people have several favorites, from the 1951 Alistair Sims film to the animated ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"" (I could have easily named another half dozen films to replace either one of those).  Still, with all of those versions floating out there is still room for those that retell the tale with a humorous touch, the best of which involved Mickey Mouse and the Muppets.
In ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" Michael Caine is the sole ""real"" person, playing Ebenezer Scrooge.  The performance is rather impressive when you take into account that he has to play straight man to the cast of Muppets but still manages to give the key moments of Dickens' story their gravity.  Basically, this version works because Caine never lets you know he is working with Muppets.  Persuading you to see this one is fairly simple.  You know the story and if you mention that Kermit the Frog is Bob Crachit, Miss Piggy is Emily Crachit, Fozzie Bear is Fozziwig (who else?), Robert the Frog is Tiny Tim, Waldorf and Statler is Robert and Jacob Marley, and the Great Gonzo is Charles Dickens, that should be enough to fire your imagination.  The ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come are ""new"" Muppets, which shows screenwriter Jerry Juhl and director Henson know how to preserve the spirit of the original while still letting the Muppets have their fun.
All things considered, ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" is the merriest version of the Dickens' classic.  The songs are by that living Muppet, Paul Williams, the best of which is ""Marley and Marley,"" although the two big songs are ""When Love Is Found"" and ""It Feels Like Christmas.""  None of these will become Christmas standards, but they are still enjoyable in the context of this charming movie.

179642,2,078885996X,"Okay, Many a folk has wondered why this long anticipated DVD is in fullscreen rather than widescreen.  Here's my answer:
In the original movie there were more scenes.  For example, when scrooge is at his desk in the beginning and beaker and his budy come in, they are supposed to sing a song.  The same with the Eagle when Scrooge goes to christmases past and is with the the eagle.  These songs, along with other scenes, were omitted in the VHS edition which many have come to love because they forgot about the original songs.
I suspect this is also why the soundtrack is amost impossible to find.  I got it when the theatre version came out, but I haven't seen it since!  Both of the deleted songs are on the tape though!
Hopefully the execs will get their heads on straight and release a good DVD, otherwise I recommend sticking with the video until other notice!

It was theatrically released in 1992 and has become a  family regular favorite to watch. It takes the classic Charles Dickens novel and gives it a funny and heart-warming twist with memorable scenes, characters and music. The screenplay was adapted by Jerry Juhl (Muppet Treasure Island, Muppets From Space) and stays true the original classic.
The song score is by Paul Williams (The Love Boat, Bugsy Malone, The Muppet Movie) who brings a lot of charm, humor and wit to these toe tapping and memorable little gems.  ""It Feels Like Christmas"", ""Just One More Sleep Till Christmas"" and ""Thankful Heart"" are some of my favorite songs.
It stars the regular Muppet repertory cast with the talents of Dave Goelz, Steve Whitmire, Jerry Nelson and of course Frank Oz (Yoda, Director of In And Out and Bowfinger).
The starring role is masterfully played - with much delight - by Michael Cain (The Cider House Rules, Austin Powers Goldmember and Miss Congeniality). His outstandingly evil and then learns what it is to be nice - really nice by none other than the three magical ghost and Bob Cratchit himself - played by Kermit The Frog!

""Fullscreen"" is a euphemism for the cropped image, instead of the ""widescreen"" image (also called ""letterbox"").

The dialog by Scrooge and the other characters closely follow the book.  What adds to this story, however, is the running commentary by Rizzo and Gonzo as Charles Dickens.  Sure, they take license by adding a second Marley, but it seems natural, and by changing names of stores - Fozziwig & Mom's, for instance - but it only personalizes it and makes it all the more entertaining.  The music is excellent and there is so much emotion in this movie - much more than in any other version I have seen!

Michael Caine was excellent as Scrooge. The love between him and Belle was really believable(when he joins her at the end of her song, you can tell he has repeated her parting words ever since; he MUST have loved her!). Emily Cratchet was finally mourning her son(more realistic), and Bob Cratchet's speech about being parted from a loved one is a fact of life is one of the most touching moments. The score to the movie, why didn't they make a soundtrack?! They each tie into their scenes so well that if they were removed, it would just be missing something; When Love is Gone"" is one of the saddest, most beautiful love ballads I've ever heard and its sequence is equally heartbreaking; no wonder Scrooge (and Rizzo)was crying when Belle left, he must have loved Belle very much and seeing it happen again...it would break the hardest heart, it did with me, and I'm 17 and hardened through and through, although I do care about others!

The Muppet ghosts are truly phenomenal--the Ghost of Christmas Present, especially, is wonderful. Michael Cane gives an uncharacteristically muted performance. The humor is all-over-Muppets, irreverent and pushing artistic liscence to the utter limit. But Dickens, I think, would grin; it's just up his alley.
The standout performances are Meredith Braun as Belle and the musical score by the very underrated American composer, Paul Williams. Braun sings Williams' ravishing song, ""When Love Is Gone"", with a coiled tension that's operatic, and when Michael Cane haltingly joins her at the end, every adult will recall their own lost loves with an aching heart. There won't be a dry eye in your house.
There's enough goofy fun, literary puns, and excellent ""casting"" to please adult and kid alike (the rag-and-bone man who buys Scrooge's still-warm blankets is a grasping spider in a Victorian stovepipe hat...and the wheedling women who steal Scrooge's bed-clothes are bedbugs...I think!), but what'll keep this Muppets movie on your shelf long after the kids have moved on is the genuine portrayal of adult guilt and redemption.

179675,5,078885996X,"If you are reading this review, chances are that you are as familiar with the story of Ebenezer Scrooge as you are with The Wizard of Oz. Who doesn't know the classic tale? Did you know the story of A Christmas Carol has been filmed over 200 times, the first film being made in 1908? Adaptations have run the gamut, from strict adherence to the story to the irreverent (Blackadder's Christmas Carol, 1988) and the modern (Scrooged, also 1988.)
Assuming you are already familiar with the tale, what makes an adaptation superior? Any story well known enough to have practically risen to the status of folktale is at risk of being so familiar its message becomes tired if not presented compellingly. On the surface, the broad plot action of A Christmas Carol might be summed up in the sentence: Scrooge gets scared straight. The challenge of any adaptation is to impress the audience of the personal joy that inhabits anyone who embraces generosity and kindness - we can all deduce that the lives of Bob Cratchit's family will improve financially, and that the poor in general will benefit from Scrooge's transformation: but what about the man himself? The beauty of the tale is of a bitter man who, in the end, really is given more than he can ever give. Even extremely liberal adaptations like Scrooged understood this: the real message in that film was summed up by Bill Murray in the closing sequence, where he tells his audience that once you start giving, you'll get a wonderful feeling, and ""You'll want it EVERY DAY.""
The film must inspire us to do likewise, not to mention entertain us along the way. Think the muppets are just for kids? Wrong! There's enough sophisticated humor embedded in this film to give anyone a laugh, largely provided by its narrators, The Great Gonzo (as Dickens) and his sidekick, Rizzo the Rat. There are other detail changes to the old story slipped in to spice up the old tale for those familiar with it - just hearing the august Michael Caine sincerely utter the line, ""Why, it's Fozziwig's old rubber chicken factory! I had my first job there"" is enough to set us laughing.
Let's talk about the ghosts. A successful adaptation has just got to have good ghosts, and the presentations here are wonderful. Christmas Past is represented by an ethereal child, voiced wonderfully; Christmas Present is the most welcoming spirit, voiced marvelously by Jerry Nelson (a muppet veteran) - these are the speaking spirits, and both are stunning muppet creations. True to tradition, Christmas Yet to Come does not speak, and manages to be chilling and stern without being too frightening to children (this creation is faceless, and for some reason that spooks grownups more than kids.)
Michael Caine is an absolutely fantastic Scrooge, very human and real. It's no small feat to interact realistically with non-human counterparts - even if they are the wonderful muppets - and Caine does this with vigor, gusto, and humility.
The only weak spot in the film is the detail on Scrooge's lost love; no one really seems to do this well. It's not very interesting for children (uck, the kissing stuff!) and it's too tired for adults. This section of the film also sports the only disappointing musical number (the rest are great.) Don't let this stop you, though - it's brief.
Why such a long review for the muppets? Because I think Brian Henson is simply doing the best family filmaking out there today. As I stated in a review of Muppet Treasure Island, such films must have appeal for all family members, and A Muppet Christmas Carol is no exception.

179680,5,078885996X,"Charles Dickens' classic tale ""A Christmas Carol"" has probably been adapted for stage, screen, and TV more than any other story in the history of literature. Many have been really great -- the Mr. Magoo animated version, Patrick Stewart's one-man stage show, the George C. Scott version, etc. But one of the best is definitely ""The Muppet Christmas Carol,"" directed with heart and intelligence by Brian Henson. This version is particularly noteworthy because it combines two beloved pop-culture icons: Dickens' story and the Jim Henson Muppets.
It's been a long time since I read Dickens' original text, but from what I remember, the MCC is quite faithful to Dickens. Like the other Muppet films, MCC combines human actors with the whimsical Muppet characters (just in case you don't know what a Muppet is, it's a sort of puppet). The great Michael Caine plays Scrooge, and the Muppets play other Dickens characters: Kermit the Frog is Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy is Mrs. Cratchit, etc.
One clever touch is having Charles Dickens (portrayed by Muppet Gonzo the Great) appear as a narrator in the film. Gonzo/Dickens is accompanied by Rizzo the Rat, and the two have some great comic banter and slapstick humor. This device nicely complements the main story without distracting from it. The film is enhanced by some lovely songs; my favorite is the one sung by the Ghost of Christmas Present.
Dickens' original ""Carol"" is, at its core, a compassionate and life-affirming story, and the Muppet version is right on target in preserving the soul of the tale. There are some genuinely sweet and moving touches (such as one Muppets' gift to Scrooge) that combine well with the trademark Muppet humor. Add to this good special effects, fine performances (both human and Muppet), and impressive sets and costumes, and you have a true classic: a film for every member of the family. In ""The Muppet Christmas Carol,"" Brian Henson and his Muppets prove that, with imagination and skill, new life can be breathed into a favorite old story.",1003622400,81,2024,4.9734513274336285

He warns him that if he is is selfish, he would get these chains, much heavier chains, all around him. It'll be made by his own selfishness.

179686,5,078885996X,"Charles Dickens' Christmas Carol has appeared many times in various incarnations, in the movies, on television and on radio.  I haven't seen or heard every version there is, but I would have a difficult time finding a version that is more enticing than this one.  In fact, I am not currently aware of any Christmas video that touches me more than this outing by the Muppets, not even my other two favorites ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""A Charlie Brown Christmas.""  Yes, it is directed to an extent toward children, but it is also directed toward the child in each of us, and in this it succeeds 100 percent.  In fact, being an adult is definitely a plus in catching some of the humor.
Some of the better-known Muppet characters play important roles in this adaptation, including Kermit as Bob Cratchit and of course Miss Piggy as Mrs. Cratchit.  These two are by turns comic and surprisingly moving as the situation requires.  Gonzo in the role of Charles Dickens narrates and provides comic relief, along with his cleverly-named sidekick Rizzo the Rat, but the two wisely disappear from the film during the more somber Ghost of Christmas Future episode, to return, as they tell us ahead of time, for the finale.  And Fozzie the Bear appears as Scrooge's old employer named, not surprisingly, Fozziewig rather than Fezziwig.
There are certain plot changes to the story, but none of them are severe and none affect the tale's basic meaning.  One of the changes is that Scrooge presides over an office of bookkeepers of whom Cratchit is the spokesperson.  Perhaps the biggest change is that there are two Marley brothers, Jacob and the newly created Robert, played by those two hecklers whose names I don't know.  This modification gives the two of them a chance to sing a darkly comic duet about their current situation.  We do get to see the brothers one more time, as guests at Fozziewig's Christmas party, so our final impression of them is not as the suffering spirits.  Another important change is that the final scene takes place at Bob Cratchit's house on Christmas day rather than at Scrooge's office the day after, thus allowing for a big finale involving most of the major characters.
The Muppets and even the subtle changes in plot all add a little extra something to the show.  However, it is Michael Caine as Scrooge who really brings this picture off.  He is younger than most Scrooges, which gives hope that he will be able to benefit his community for many more years than he might if he were older.  His portrayal of Scrooge is so full of subtlety that I find myself sympathizing with the character at a much earlier point than I do in most versions.  For example, when he joins his former sweetheart in her good-bye song ""Love Is Gone,"" I am genuinely touched, because I can see that he has repeated to himself many times over the years the words she said to him that day.  And when he discovers that this Christmas he is the butt of his nephew's rather unchristian Christmas game/joke, I feel Scrooge's pain.  So we are well prepared for his completely believable and indeed inevitable final transformation when he sees his tombstone.  Caine is so good in fact, that I don't even begrudge him his appropriation of Tiny Tim's immortal final line.  He surely deserves that much of a plum, especially after spending the film acting with a bunch of Muppets, which cannot have been the easiest assignment of his career.  A wonderful portrayal from every aspect.
I mentioned ""Love Is Gone"" as a touching representation of Scrooge's state of mind.  But the fact is that each of the half-dozen or so songs in the movie sets an atmosphere and a mood, and each adds something to the film that would not be there if the song were omitted.
The Muppet Christmas Carol can, of course, be seen merely as an introduction to Charles Dickens' famous story (and Gonzo does in fact advise the audience to read the book if they enjoyed the movie).  But I think the film also stands magnificently by itself as a wonderful retelling of this particular Christmas tale.  Either way, it's a Christmas film that is not to be missed, by young or old.  5 stars?  7 or 8 at the very least!",978998400,27,4177,4.648979591836735
179687,5,078885996X,"Imagine a world in which muppets and humans exist and live side by side; now imagine that scenario being used to present one of the most beloved stories in literature, and you have ""The Muppet Christmas Carol,"" directed by Brian Henson and starring Michael Caine as the inimitable Ebenezer Scrooge.  A movie for children, you say?  Absolutely.  Adults?  Most certainly.  All that's required of any audience is that you suspend disbelief for awhile and check your doubts at the door; do that and you're in for a thoroughly enjoyable ninety minutes or so as Caine, Kermit, Miss Piggy and all the rest bring you a unique and entertaining version of the Charles Dickens' classic, guaranteed to be unlike any you've seen before.  For the younger set, the antics of the  muppets alone will be enthralling; for the rest of us there's some subtle humor (as can be found in all of the muppets outings), and of course the story itself which, when well crafted and delivered-- as this one is-- always seems fresh, especially when seeing a new version for the first time.  Henson has done a tremendous job of melding the live actors with the animated and presenting them together in such a natural setting, and with such imagination, that it's easy to accept the world in which they live and thrive; so much so that if Gonzo came to your door while you were watching this one, you wouldn't think twice about it.  And there are so many clever bits sprinkled throughout, for instance, having the Marley ""Brothers,"" Jacob and ""Robert.""  Things adults will pick up on, and which will be entertaining to kids who will take what they see and hear at face value.  As for the casting of Michael Caine as Scrooge, to land such a gifted actor to anchor the story was a coup indeed; and Caine more than delivers, creating an imposing figure of Scrooge that he makes quite his own.  And how gratifying to see yet another interpretation of one of the most well known figures in literature played so well.  Caine immerses himself in the part and performs opposite Kermit the Frog or Miss Piggy with the same dedication and eye for detail that he did opposite Olivier in ""Sleuth,"" or Connery in ""The Man Who Would Be King.""  It's a performance that lends distinction to the film and illustrates what a consummate professional Caine is.  Everyone's favorite muppets are on hand for this one, with Kermit in the role of Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy as Mrs. Cratchit and The Great Gonzo in the role of Charles Dickens, who also narrates the story, along with the help of Rizzo the Rat.  The familiar tale remains intact under Henson's direction, and what a treat ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" will be to the youngsters who are being introduced to it with this film.

Although the Muppets present things in a light and sometimes downright silly way, the characters are so incredibly likeable that I really ""got"" the point of the story from watching this version.
The video features sarcastic humor and visual jokes and will make you laugh from beginning to end.  At the same time, you can't help but care for all the characters, and you really are concerned for Tiny Tim and his family, almost forgetting that they are frogs and pigs.  The video transitions neatly back and forth from humor to sensitivity.  Although obviously this video is not completely accurate to the details of Dickens's version of the story, the spirit that he was trying to convey is definately present.  Aside from the adorable plot, the music in this movie is wonderful!  The songs are touching and memorable, and the fact that they are sang by rats and vegetables is just an added bonus.  ""It feels like Christmas"" is absolutely adorable!

Kermit the Frog is Bob Cratchit: put-upon employee of  cold-hearted Ebenezer Scrooge. When Scrooge is visited by three ghosts (you  know the story!) Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat provide superb narration that  suprises by being both incredibly funny and spanning several types of  humour: adult, farce, parody and more.
The keyword in the Muppet movies  is entertainment. This is obviously not even worth comparing to the  Alastair Sim SCROOGE or even Bill Murray's gem SCROOGED. It's the Muppets  telling a story as they want to tell it: in their own magical way.",963705600,,864,5.028169014084507
179698,5,078885996X,"I loved this take off of the classic Christmas Carol.. They have some humor,  plus there is a lot of drama in it too... When Love is Gone sequence has me crying each and every time. The Scenes with Tiny Tim also  show just how precous that life really is... This is by far the best video  to be put out from the Henson Company",962236800,,326,3.9846153846153847
179699,4,078885996X,"This great video is an exception to the general rule that latterday Muppets films are not very good (c.f. Muppets Treasure Island, Muppets in Space, etc).  Michael Caine is wonderful as nasty Scrooge (he should have  got an Oscar nomination for his cheesy London accent in this, rather than  for his cheesy American accent in The Cider House Rules).  All the standard  Muppet favorites are here, and Rizzo the Rat is particularly fine in this  film.  Very funny.",959040000,,462,4.846153846153846
