8428233,3,B004FRVDX2,"The animation in this series is your basic Japanese, the pace of the story is quite slow, and the soundtrack is annoying. Still, the message remains powerful and loyal to the New Testament. The series does start getting better with the previous DVD (The Last Supper) and continues with this DVD (Jesus on Trial) and the next (Death and Resurrection). Great care was undertaken to avoid showing violent scenes, but for the sake of accuracy and comprehensiveness, these scenes were either mentioned briefly via conversations or heard (without actually seeing what was happening). It is an OK series overall, but I would not spend more than $5 for each DVD.",1437177600,,654,4.954545454545454
