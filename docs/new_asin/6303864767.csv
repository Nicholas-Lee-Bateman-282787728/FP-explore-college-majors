7854658,2,6303864767,"Alpha Video retains their reputation for putting out bad quality on cheap discs. A lot of people forgive the quality because of the price, but in this case, like many of their releases, you get what you paid for. I have a print of this movie from a 16mm master (which was custom transferred for me) and I was shocked to discover it's the same print. The sprocket jump in the same part of the movie, the 3 second skip from one scene to another, a hair flies on the screen from the transfer that stays on the screen for a bit, and so on. So it seems Alpha grabs their films from everywhere and doesn't do their own transfers. For years this company has been posting their logo on the corner of the screen, and even freeze-framing the opening and closing credits. But now, having viewed their newest release, but I recently discovered they are adding sound effects to the sound tracks. So do yourself a favor. Don't buy this film because you can get better quality elsewhere. Hopefully VCI Entertainment, with a superb reputation for releasing films unaltered, will get around to this one. By the way, it's not one of the better Tex Ritter films. It was produced in conjunction with FDR's request that the Hollywood studios start using their movies to promote the newly-founded Boy Scouts of America.",1296086400,2,1297,4.594827586206897
7854659,2,6303864767,"Tex Rides with the Boy Scouts, 1937 film

The story begins with a view of a Boy Scout Jamboree. Virtually every country has a Boy Scout organization. Its aim is to build character and follow the twelve rules. Elsewhere a steam train is flagged down, and the Express car robbed of a million in gold (about one ton!). We see Tex and two friends riding. They are warned against trespassing. Later they see a Boy Scout camp and they stop for the night. The laundry man also buys ""old gold"". Tex helps a young woman, and visits the office where she works. Tubby tells Tex what he saw. Tex goes to investigate the mine. He is seen and pursued. Back at the camp Tex sings a song. Norma doesn't talk about company business. Tubby and Pee Wee provide comedy. The next day Tubby buys a gold nugget. Tex thinks this is important.

A fight begins, Tex drops his letter in the dusty street. Dorman, the gang leader, reads its address. Can Tubby find his ticket? Norma's brother Buzzy overhears Dorman's conversation about that letter. He is shot as he runs away. Dorman hears that some of the gang members are trying to cross him. He captures them and plans his escape. Tex sends the Boy Scouts to watch Dorman's gang. Tommy tells Tex about that pack train. The posse arrives to chase Dorman's gang. Shots are fired, the gang is captured. Tex captures Dorman. The US Mint gold is recovered. There is a final joke.

This is an average story that is not improved by adding children as part of the plot. Tex's partners could be more serious too. Its too dramatic for a comedy, not funny for a parody. There was a time when you could fly an airplane over Washington DC.",1293580800,,1652,4.445544554455446
