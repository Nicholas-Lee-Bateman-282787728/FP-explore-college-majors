This is a very different type of movie than most cartoons, and because it is different, it easily differentiates itself from its contemporary counterparts. All of the voices are children or young people, so kids easily identify with it and find it appealing. The faces and bodies are mostly basic geometric shapes, which makes this easy for people who get overwhelmed visually, as is the case with autism and sensory issues. I think this is why people with autism and young children like shows like these.",1451174400,,633,4.925233644859813

8052172,5,B0007UVXDQ,"I took a look at this show a while back and I was really surprised. This show is based on the art and the books by author Todd Parr. One great story is when Todd and his friends learn that going over to a friends house for the first time may make you feel a little bit nervous,but when you give it a chance you will definitly have a great time. I use to feel that way but I definitly understand the lesson. This is a great show that is not just entertaining,but is a lot of fun with learning too.",1168214400,2,496,3.9207920792079207
