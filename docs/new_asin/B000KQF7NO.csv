8158916,5,B000KQF7NO,"I really enjoyed this film.  I was deeply surprised that it was so good.  It treated the subject with great respect and love.  It is a great insight into the late Pope's love and devotion to the Holy Mother, to several churches and retreats that were dear to him.  It covered aspects of the Pope's life and dedication to the Holy Mother that I have not seen in other documentary films.  If you are a collector of films on Pope John Paul II and/or the Holy Mother, this is one for your collection.  And if you are interested in Marian holy sites and churches that venerate the Holy Mother, this is a good film.  It is in Polish with English subtitles.  And not at all a distraction.  Portions of the filming are quite lovely as well.",1279756800,,732,4.323529411764706
