The acting is first-rate and the story manages to be poignant, amusing, uplifting, and tragic all at the same time--no small feat!  I'd recommend this little-known gem to anyone who appreciates the charms of straightforward, beautifully crafted storytelling.",1442966400,,323,5.708333333333333

8390215,5,B0036X491E,"I can't believe this hasn't been reviewed as of yet!  We loved the Irish brogue along with the strong female protagonist in this film.

Mary, the eleven year old protagonist, wants to be a race car driver.  She decides to enter the local go-kart race and sets out to build her go-cart all on her own since her father (played by a gruff Colm Meaney) initially tells her not to come to him for help.  Meanwhile, the family farm is suffering financially and they may lose it to the bank. Niamh McGirr plays the lead role with a determination and subtlety that plays out well in the drama of following your dream.  There's a bit of local color from the local rich kid and the faithful friend who encourages Mary to beat them all even though she is the only girl competing.  The movie appears to take place in the present-day.

This is a great little family film for discussions about topics ranging from prejudice, bullying, determination, and perseverance. There's inclusion about family hardships and helping each other but that there are also limits and sacrifices that are a part of life.  The movie does not have a perfect, happy ending but it is nevertheless a satisfying ending that feels heart-warming and realistic at the same time.

*Spoiler*
The financial strain and conflicts are too much for the marriage and the parents ultimately separate by the end of the movie.  The subject of parental separation is dealt with by the portrayal of some arguing of the parents and the mother eventually moving out but it's still clear that each parent still dearly loves their daughter as shown with the mother coming to see the final race.",1300233600,4,1636,4.688811188811189
