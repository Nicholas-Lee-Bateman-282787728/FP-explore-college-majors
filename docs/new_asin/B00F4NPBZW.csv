5967482,4,B00F4NPBZW,"This was a fun movie...kind of like an Elvis Presley/Beach Blanket Bingo but not really on a beach from an Asian point of view in the 50's, confused? I was too, but it was definitely fun and a lot of very attractive men and women in it and music and dancing and well it was fun. I am a big fan of the Chinese,  Japanese, Korean etc movies this musical comedy was quite a departure and I did really enjoy it. Seems strange sometimes but fun.",1391472000,,440,4.116279069767442
5967483,5,B00F4NPBZW,"I just watched the trailer. This movie is great. Its a wonderful combination of music, storytelling and landscapes. You can find out traditional Taiwaner culture and you can expect to see the old scene back to 50 years ago in Taiwan. It seems like to tell a common person's life but also imply the real cruel society at the same time. This is the movie you can not miss in 2013.",1383177600,3,378,4.338028169014085

8612297,5,B00F4NPBZW,"It was eveything I hoped and dreamed a musical could be! I only hope that one day I can have the fashion sence, that clearly the costume designer has. as well as the seemingly majestic dance fighting moves that I hope to one day harness.  Thank you. This movie has changed my life.",1436659200,,281,4.30188679245283
8612298,5,B00F4NPBZW,"One of my favorite Jay Chou movies, ever! Who doesn't love Taiwan and the amazing Jay Chou?! This movie will not disappoint",1415491200,,123,4.636363636363637

8612300,1,B00F4NPBZW,"It was hard to tell if this was purposefully suppose to be a spoof of American '60s/70s culture, music and film or just really bad. Think of a really bad attempt of the following cultural elements: Bowling Alleys, Westside Story, Woodstock, hippies, gangs, various car oriented movies, or more recently, Glee, etc. Song and dance numbers were sparse and thankfully so. An alternative comparison would be the cheap fast food offerings called Bollywood - this film was even worse.",1397088000,,478,5.063291139240507
8612301,5,B00F4NPBZW,"A brilliant and  rare musical treat from Hong Kong. Flawless in the acting, dancing and musical  numbers. The only fault is in the opening bathhouse scene. Everyone wears  large towels or  swimming togs. In  China  you  leave all your clothes in your locker. You  have to wear  sandals provided  at the entrance. The towels are the size of a tea towel.  It is the same as  Korean  bathhouses . I  went to  a  bathhouse in Shanghai ( 6 levels) and it was a completely  naked experience in the male  section.  I was also the only westerner there at the time of my visit.",1396483200,,568,4.339805825242719
8612302,3,B00F4NPBZW,"This is a likeable musical film by Jay Chou. There were many things to like about this film in the music and choreography. The story was OK (neither good nor bad). The reason for the rating is due to the way the movie leaves you feeling at the end of the film. I am glad I was able to see this movie and it was a worthy effort, but in the end I felt disappointed, but not enough to give it a bad rating.",1395792000,,403,3.8095238095238093
8612303,1,B00F4NPBZW,This was not the one I thought it was. So it will be going to the half price book store here.,1394150400,,93,3.4761904761904763
