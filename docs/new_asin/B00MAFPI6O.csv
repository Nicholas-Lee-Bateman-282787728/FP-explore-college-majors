8671117,3,B00MAFPI6O,"The beginning of the film opens with a quick prophecy that isn't on the screen very long. It predicts the child of Satan will be a woman known as the ""Drommelkind."" After that the film opens in 6/6/1994 as six different women of the ""New Bethlehem Community"" all give birth to girls. Elder Beacon (Colm Meaney) wants to kill all of them. He is stopped.

Five of the girls survive and become inseparable friends as they are under the watchful eye of the community which speak in whispers behind their backs. This is an Amish style community, separated from the world. As the girls approach their 18th birthday, killings and suicides crank up, although nothing supernatural.

The film changes gears about 4 minutes from the end...so keep watching. Not much in the way of horror. While people are killed, the camera is shy.

Parental Guide: No swearing. There is some minor male/female butt nudity. Girl forced to disrobe and is touched...discreet camera angels. Implied sex.",1455580800,,972,4.878787878787879
