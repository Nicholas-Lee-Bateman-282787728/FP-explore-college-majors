8564380,2,B00B9288WA,"I was able to get this disk to play, but only after several tries.  It would not work on my old 15 year old DVD player that's hooked up to my TV, and would only work on my computer after I used the latest software player.

In short, the authoring is much to be desired.

Ah, but to the content.  I got interested in Bollywood movies because of the flashy musical numbers.  But, there's only so much I can take, and, truth be told, the films themselves are fairly poor.  They mostly tend to be these multigenred action-comedies with a few musical numbers.  The content of the films is kept upbeat, but with very little in the way of IQ points.

This disk shows a few dozen musical vignettes.  The first few sounded like the music was pirated from a well known pop artist, while the others were just hard to take after a while.  The Indian Bollywood musical number almost struck me as heavy metal music from the 80s; they all sounded the same after a while (a few variations here and there).

I think the artistry in the Bollywood film in terms of the musical numbers and frame composition is worthy of note.  And if you're into Bollywood musical numbers (and have the latest drivers for your DVD player of choice), then this should entertain.

Otherwise, I might reccomend the casual viewer find a disc that has fewer technical issues.",1440028800,,1334,4.462809917355372
8564381,1,B00B9288WA,"The DVD does not work.  Not sure what to do.  I have plugged in the DVD in 3 different DVD players, including my desktop.  The DVD player in unable to read the disk.  Next time I need to buy an Indian music DVD, I am going to a store.  No more online Amazon for DVD's",1412035200,3,267,3.7818181818181817
8564382,2,B00B9288WA,The problem I have with this disc is that it doesn't want to play on 3 of 4 players that I own. I don't have any idea why it is so finicky. I will not buy any more from this company. If you don't have several players to choose from you may be out of luck.,1405900800,,255,3.5714285714285716
8564383,1,B00B9288WA,"I tried two three different DVD players and it doesn't work ! (Not sure if its faulty DVD or pirated !)

If you want to watch these on a laptop you can buy it or you can watch on YouTube.

Waste of Money !",1399334400,,205,3.6363636363636362
8564384,5,B00B9288WA,The song collection is excellent.  Some of the song move too fast that it's hard to catch up with the wording.  It will be nice if you provide the lyrics of those song in your DVD package.,1391040000,,188,4.054054054054054
8564385,2,B00B9288WA,Only about 25 of the songs on this DVD were any good and groovy. The rest were simply too slow or had too much useless dialog to dance.,1371513600,,135,3.857142857142857
8564386,4,B00B9288WA,"there were no ENGLISH subtitles.
I am a native English speaker and like to know what the Hindi words mean.
This helps me to understand and enjoy the DVD even more
Very good video quality except for the second to last song.",1369958400,,222,4.309523809523809
8564387,3,B00B9288WA,some very good songs in it but the mixes were not that good.  Maybe if the songs had been inh original form and not mixed like they were it would have been better.,1362614400,,163,3.9393939393939394
8564388,5,B00B9288WA,"Yet another great collection of Bollywood film song videos.  Among the featured movies are ""Cocktail"" ""Debangg 2"" ""Khilda 786"" ""Son of Sardaar"" ""Housefull 2"" ""Bol Bachchan"" ""Teri Meri Kahaani"" and ""Agent Vinod"".  Fans of Salaman Khan, Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgan should be in video hits heaven; also a nice dose of Saif Ali Khan, Priyanka Chopra, Amir Khan, Rani Mukherji, Deepika Padukone and many other familiar faces.  Once again, for those who are interested in Bollywood and are looking to ""dip a toe in the water"", this is an excellent musical collection of some of the most recent films.  No subtitles, but lots and lots of fun!",1361577600,6,636,4.861111111111111
