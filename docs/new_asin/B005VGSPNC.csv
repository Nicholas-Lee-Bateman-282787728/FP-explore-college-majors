8487455,4,B005VGSPNC,"Climax was a 1950's TV series, and A Promise to Murder (1954) was one of the TV programs of this series.  The show itself was quite good with Peter Lorre being one of the stars, a very good script, and contained within the time limit allowing for commercials.  However, it was the TV commercials with Bill Lundigan, about the new Chrysler, Desoto, etc. cars of that year that outshined the TV story, I guess I was fascinated because the commercials looked almost ridiculous in the way they were done, but that was TV in the 1950's.  Unfortunately, the video transfer was only fair, but as I said, the script was very good, the actors played their roles well, and I did hang in there, to watch a good TV program that had to compete with commercials.  The commercials should not have been included with the show in the video transfer, but they did give an insight into early TV advertising.",1410998400,,888,4.53125
8487456,2,B005VGSPNC,"Really don't know about the film itself - the quality of the transfer was so poor.  The sound was plagued with noise, and the image was murky.  I have attempted to watch other Synergy Archive Series films on amazon instant video, and they were also of very poor quality.  Such a shame.",1408406400,2,285,4.4423076923076925
8487457,5,B005VGSPNC,It was unbelievably suspenseful!  Forgot how good some of these old shows were.,1405468800,,79,5.076923076923077
8487458,4,B005VGSPNC,Lessons can be learned about trust and lonely people.  The story develops well and at times you really can't see much wrong with the situation.,1383091200,3,143,4.72
