4980349,5,B00699G6EU,I own the first 3 seasons and plan on getting the 4th before the 5th season comes out. I actually perfer Here's Lucy to I love Lucy or The Lucy show but that's how I feel.

4980350,5,B00699G6EU,"The fifth season of Here's Lucy will for sure please Lucy fans. Unfortunately Lucille Ball had a skiing accident and had to be in a wheelchair for most of the season. Lucy's daughter Lucie Arnaz got to show off her talent with guest stars such as Donny Osmond and others. The ratings for the show dropped. Ball was so depressed that she decided that the fifth season would be her last. They filmed a last episode with Harry (Gale Gordon) selling the office, packing up and remembering the times he had with Lucy (Lucille Ball), Kim (Lucie Arnaz) and Craig (Desi Arnaz, Jr.). At the last minute, the producers of the show convinced her to do the sixth season. She did. I already pre - ordered it and if I were you, I would do so too.",1322438400,8,732,4.350364963503649
4980351,5,B00699G6EU,"""Here's Lucy"" season five took a turn for the series and for Lucille Ball.  Lucy had broken her leg in Aspen, Colorado during the winter of 1972 and wasn't able to perform the physical comedy that she was so good at doing.  The writers had to write her broken leg into the series.  Lucie Arnaz had taken a larger role in some episodes and does begin to shine.  The fifth season of ""Here's Lucy"" was still going strong in the ratings but did drop out of the Top 10 for the first time.  The show still finished in 15th place for the year with a rating of 21.9 and 33% share of the audience and the series' still finished first in its' 9:00 - 9:30 pm time slot.  This was thought to be Lucy's last season on CBS, however, Fred Silverman head of CBS during that time, went to Lucy's house (in October of 1972)  personally to convince the redhead to do another season for the 1973-74 season (which will be the final season of the series).  Lucy agreed, and believe it or not, ""Here's Lucy"" was the first series to be renewed for the 1973-74 season.  The fifth season of ""Here's Lucy"" is one of the strongest seasons of the show.  Even with a broken leg Lucy managed to make millions laugh each week.  Some of my favorite episodes of season five include:  Lucy's Big Break, Harrison Carter, Male Nurse, A Home Is Not An Office, Lucy and Joe Namath, Lucy, the Other Woman (with Totie Fiels is a classic), Lucy and the Group Encounter, Lucy Is Really In A Pickle (one of my all-time favorites), Goodbye Mr. Hips and Lucy and Harry's Memoirs.  I for one am so happy to have all of Lucy's work on DVD from ""I Love Lucy"" to ""Here's Lucy.""  I must commend CBS Home Entertainment and MPI Home Video for the wonderful work they have done in releasing ""The Lucy Show"" (CBS Home Entertainment) and ""Here's Lucy"" (MPI Home Video).  Both companies have worked so closely with one another in the release of both series and their diligence shows in the outcome of the DVD releases.  We should have the final seasons of ""The Lucy Show"" and ""Here's Lucy"" released sometime before August 2012.",1322265600,5,2070,4.393700787401575
4980352,5,B00699G6EU,"On February 28, 2012 MPI Home Video will release the complete Season 5 of the beloved Lucille Ball sitcom ""Here's Lucy"". The 1972-1973 season saw the series fall out of the Top 10 in the Nielsen Ratings for the first time ever. In actuality this was the first season during Lucy's run on CBS (with this show and her other two comedies) that a Lucille Ball sitcom fell out of the Top 10. Still, ""Here's Lucy"" finished a very respectable #15 and considering who Lucy's competition was on the other networks (Monday Night Football on ABC and Monday Night Movies on NBC) the series still won its timeslot raking in a rating of 21.9, while football came in at #18 and movies garnered only a #29 position. Obviously people still loved Lucille Ball and her character in that a sixth and final year was planned for the '73-'74 TV year.

 The fifth season began with the writers in a very perplexing situation: Lucille Ball had broken her leg while skiing and they had to decide what to do. So, they simply wrote it in the script. In one of the first shows they hilariously showed Lucy in the hospital nursing her leg back to health with none other than Eva Gabor as her roomate.

 Other guest-stars this season included Donny Osmond, Joe Namath and Petula Clark.

 Like other sets the episodes have been restored from their original prints and look flawless and include the standard 24 shows in a 4-disc set. Of an important note the season's final episode entitled ""Lucy and Harry's Memoirs"" was intended to be the show's finale. At the end Lucy looks into the camera and winks and one is led to believe there would be no more ""Here's Lucy"". However, thankfully CBS persuaded Miss Ball to return for another year.

4980353,5,B00699G6EU,"Huge Thank You's To MPI for bringing us this Season 5 of Here's Lucy which will be released on February 28th of 2012! For us Lucy Fans, that means we will need only one more last Season 6 to have the entire series of Here's Lucy on DVD! 2012 also promises to have the last Season 6 of The Lucy Show on dvd from CBS as well- leaving us fans beyond happy to own the entire seasons of both Here's Lucy and The Lucy Show! MPI, as always, promises the best remastering/restoration of this Season 5 with plenty of bonus goodies included for us Lucy fans!

Here's Lucy Season 5 was the beginning of the end for Lucy's great television career. Lucy had more than one bad break besides the one from her tragic skiing accident, as the Nielsen ratings dropped Here's Lucy from out of the top ten to #15 this season. In 1970, an almost 60 year old Lucy fell in love with skiing, so much in fact that she purchased 3 condos in the ski resort of Snowmass, Colorado for the entire family. Lucy's natural athletic ability and her love of the crisp, cold air made skiing a perfect fit for her. The beautiful cold snow brought back her childhood memories from New York and the Midwest where she grew up. Sadly, this lovely retreat for Lucy turned into a tragedy, when in early January 1972, Lucy was resting to the side after lunch, as skiers passed her, when a woman came down the trail and plowed right into her. The woman and her skis broke Lucy's right leg into 4 pieces. This put poor Lucy into surgery and a full leg cast right up to her hip.

In the hospital, Lucy constantly kept chipping the cast down to her calf, but the doctors kept replastering it back up. Lucy would never get over the fact that her leg would never be the same being held together with 4 pins. When she was ready to go back to work on this Season 5, her confidence was shattered as she went through this Season's episodes from being in a wheelchair, to hobbling in a cast, to a leg brace worn under boots, long skirts or pants. For the first time, Lucy could not perform her physical comedy, and this would change the show's ratings. When Lucy found out that this Season's ratings dropped out of the top 10, Lucy was so depressed, that she decided not to sign a contract with CBS for a sixth season. At the end of this season 5, Lucy filmed a last show, selling the agency and reminiscing with Gale Gordon on shows past. At this season's last show's end, Lucy puts a sign saying TEMPORARILY over the Going Out Of Business sign and winks to the audience. The head of CBS didn't think the show was that far out of the top 10 and finally talked Lucy into doing a Season 6.

This Season 5 put Lucy out of commission, which gave daughter Lucie Arnaz more television time, and with her singing and dancing with guest stars, she simply shines. Lucie dances and sings as a pickle, a country girl, with Donny Osmond, a stellar performance as a flapper, with John Davidson, but her most notable performance is with Jim Bailey as they do a fantastic rendition of the song FEVER. You will see Gale Gordon as Harry Carter and Mary Jane Croft in most every episode. There are great guest stars as well with Lloyd Bridges, Eva Gabor, Joe Namath, Totie Fields, Petula Clark, Jim Bailey, Bruce Gordon, Donny Osmond, Eve Plumb, Ricardo Montalban, Ruth Buzzi, Reta Shaw, Don Knotts and Bob Cummings. Even without Lucy's physical comedy, there are some great performances by daughter Lucie and the guests. Totie Fields is hilarious as the milkman's jealous wife. Eva Gabor is adorable as Lucy's hospital room mate, who of course gets all the attention, candy and flowers. Ruth Buzzi totally outdoes herself in her singing and dancing. Don Knotts is always funny and must have kept his wardrobe from The Love God movie. Son Desi Jr. makes a rare appearance with Joe Namath and seeing a very young Donny Osmond with Eve Plumb (The Brady Bunch's Jan) is a real treat. The shows are still very entertaining, but Lucy's physical comedy is noticeably missed.

It is totally obvious that Lucy is doing some strange things with her leg cast this season. You will see her in a wheelchair, then hobbling in a cast. When the cast is gone, you will see her in boots, long dresses and pants or standing behind furniture to hide the leg brace. But suddenly, when the cast is gone, it reappears again in later shows. I would guess that Lucy is removing the cast too soon, like in the hospital, and the doctors are putting  it on again. You will see Lucy working a pottery wheel really fast with her leg in Episode 21, then in episode 23, the cast is back on. You'll notice the cast on and off during this entire season. Between the wheelchair, leg cast, brace and her natural aging, Lucy was a real trooper to keep going another season. The time it took her make up artist to prepare her for every show with the elaborate bands pulling her skin taught and doing her wigs was a lot for Lucy to go through for her fans. But thank goodness she did go through it, as her television shows will bring laughter and happiness to her fans forever thanks to MPI and CBS putting her beloved shows on dvd sets! One great thing they included in the first show this season is actual film of Lucy really skiing in Snowmass, Colorado, showing her great physical talent even nearing age 60!

The broken leg story arc seemed to change the trajectory of the series - Lucy was ""grounded"" a bit, allowing her to age, and the rest of the cast was allowed to shine more.  It became less of a ""celebrity of the week"" show and more of a traditional Lucy sitcom.  The show was getting long in the tooth by now, but I think it truly found a second wind this season.

Some of the scripts are terribly poor like ""Lucy and Petula Clark,"" ""Lucy Is Really in a Pickle,"" ""Lucy and Jim Bailey,"" ""The Case of the Reckless Driver."" Also, I do not particularly like ""Dirty Gertie."" Lucille Ball actually broke her leg this season! So it was cool how they tied that into the stories, but some of the stories were just too bland.

The extras too have been given special love and it shows how much respect MPI has for the show, its fans and Lucille Ball's legacy.

My only dismay with this release was that it came out with a BLACK DVD case rather than the clear. This presents a problem since the DVD cover is dual-sided with the episode guide printed on the opposite side, meant to be seen through a clear case once it's opened. I had to go through the trouble of purchasing a FRIENDS re-release at BJs for $8 (it too came in a clear case that houses 4 DVDs) so I could swap cases. Fortunately, the FRIENDS re-release has an insert, making the clear case almost unnecessary. With any luck, I hope to be able to sell it soon. A bit of effort to go through on behalf of ""Here's Lucy"", but as any fan can attest, the show and Lucille Ball are worth it.

4980378,5,B00699G6EU,"I must admit that I have always found ""Here's Lucy"" to be a very inconsistent series. Some episodes are great while others are quite silly and poorly written.  The first few seasons are a real roller coaster ride - with the occasional gem standing out.  (""I Love Lucy"" is a classic and was the gold standard for all of its seasons; ""The Lucy Show"" is also wonderful, especially the first 3 seasons with Viv - although the recent DVD releases made me appreciate the latter seasons even more).

So I was so surprised that Season 5 of ""Here's Lucy"" turns out to be one of the most enjoyable of the entire run!  By this point, as everyone else has noted, Lucille Ball was 61. Plus, she'd broken her leg.  But this forced the writers to use the entire ensemble much more. The stories become more organic (no more wacky animals!) and filled with even better interactions and plot points.  Lucie Arnaz has several stand-out parts in this season.

Having two of the original I Love Lucy writers back on board for many of these shows is another plus.  They contribute two of the best episodes of the season (and the entire series): ""Lucy is Really in a Pickle"" and ""Lucy and the Franchise Fiasco"".  I also found ""Lucy and Harry's Pot"" to be extremely touching. The clay wheel is a good source of physical comedy but it's the ending that really packs the punch. We see genuine heart and love between Lucy and Uncle Harry in the last scene.

Other standouts from season five include:  Harrison Carter, Male Nurse, Dirty Gertie, and Lucy and Donny Osmond. Sure, there are a few selections here that seem a bit dated. But for the most part, this is one of the most satisfying seasons from the entire Here's Lucy Collection.  Enjoy!

On a technical note: if you buy the DVD collection on Amazon, you might have the same problem I did. The episode guide is missing and the case is black, which means you can't see anything printed on the other side.  I contacted the distributor to correct this mistake.

4980379,5,B00699G6EU,This season is a very good one.  Right before the season began Lucy broke her leg skiing and had to do six episodes in a cast and she was just as brilliant as ever.  This is a really great season and if your a Lucy fan you'll love it!,1331683200,,234,3.7551020408163267
4980380,4,B00699G6EU,"I cannot believe Lucille Ball went through half this season with her leg in a cast... at the age of 61 yet. If that's not dedicated acting, I don't know what is! I especially liked the episode where she wore a high white boot on her left leg that matched the cast on her right leg, and with the way she barely hobbled around, you almost didn't even notice she had a cast on!

None of Lucy's later shows ever measured up to ""I Love Lucy,"" and that is the only reason I cannot give this 5 stars. I like ""Here's Lucy"" more than ""The Lucy Show,"" I think, and I would give it, say, 4.6 stars if I could. The only thing I never liked was the ""sameness."" The use of the name ""Lucy"" on every single show... she was even ""Lucy McGilliguddy"" in one episode! The frequent re-use of all the same guest stars by all their own names. Stuff like that. Sometimes it made it hard to remember which show you were watching.

The best thing about ""Here's Lucy"" is we got our continuity back. It also seemed to be aimed at a slightly older audience. On ""The Lucy Show,"" all the kids - and Viv - just seemed to disappear and were never heard from again (with the exception of a guest appearance or two from Vivian Vance). There was never a continuous storyline from episode to episode. And some of the plots were so juvenile. On ""Here's Lucy,"" the addition of her real-life children (although Desi Jr. / Craig disappeared) added a nice touch of continuity. (It was a shame, however, that none of the men who liked Lucy never lasted for more than an episode!). Lucy still got into a great deal of childish mischief, but for the most part it's enjoyable for all ages. Looking forward to Season 6!",1331164800,2,1672,4.287974683544304
4980381,5,B00699G6EU,"MPI delivers yet another fantastic ""Here's Lucy"" release with Season Five. Presentation-wise, everything is just as terrific here as it has been for the last four releases: gorgeous eye-popping colorful prints of the episodes themselves and a treasure trove of extras.

Of course, this is the year that Lucille Ball famously broke her leg and was confined to a wheelchair for several episodes and after it healed she was limited in the physical comedy she was able to perform. Actually at this point, the show benefits from Lucy's misfortune as she's forced to rely on comedic delivery and timing rather than schtick. No chimps, gorillas or Garboonas this season; nor do we have creaky musical numbers of seasons past. The plots this year become more logical (well, logical for Lucyland anyway) and Season 5 becomes the strongest yet of the series.

Most notable among the Bonus Features is a 30-minute collection of Bloopers; many of which fans have only read about up to this point: Jack Benny remarking on a retake that they'll ""have to do this G*damn thing all over again"" after Lucy breaks the heel of her shoe; and Carole Cook and Lucie Arnaz bumping-and-grinding during the ""Mais-Oui"" perfume number. There are plenty more and wait 'til you hear the off-color remark Lucy makes about director Jerry Paris!

While the episodes themselves certainly don't rate against the best of ""I Love Lucy"", when judging them against other ""Here's Lucy's"", this is the most consistently good season thus far. My favorite segment ""Lucy Is Really In a Pickle"" features an obvious rip-off of Vitemeatavegamin with Lucy making various sourpuss faces while rehearsing a pickle commercial, but the episode stands on its own merits.

Five stars for this release and only one more season to go. Thanks MPI!",1330387200,13,1790,4.996644295302014

8495167,5,B00699G6EU,"Season 5 of ""Here's Lucy"", could have easily been a clunker, with Lucille Ball, (having made her name, some 20 yrs earlier for physical comedy), virtually out of commission for the first three episodes, and then limited for a number of episodes,  by a cast on her broken leg. ""Out of commission""? ""Limited""? HARDLY!
Lucille Ball was the consummate professional. As a producer and star for
many years in Hollywood's television industry, she surrounded herself with the
best in the business and the best for what
she did! Her writers and directors took the situation head on! The result was one of the funniest and most entertaining seasons of the series. The one exception to this review would have to be ""Lucy &
the Franchise Fiasco"". for one reason or another the timing, the feeling of an uncharacteristic lack of attention to detail... it was almost as if they
were filming what some thought was a rehearsal.
there is one particular scene that had Lucy sitting
on the floor, NOT covered in frozen yogurt. Mary
Jane comes in and asks: ""Is that Lucy?"" This joke would have worked if Lucy HAD been covered and
unrecognizable (except for her signature
""Whaaaaaaaaahhhh"") by the frozen dessert.
instead she's sitting on the floor with some of the
yogurt on her shoulders and spitting out of the
machine... but hardly unrecognizable. As I say, this is the one exception that I found in the entire season, if not the entire series.
With a list of guest stars that is a ""who's who"" from 60's/70's entertainment, like Donny Osmond, Lloyd Bridges, Jim Bailey, Ruth Buzzi, Petula Clark, Totie Fields, Eva Gabor, and Ricardo Montalban...oh, and John Davidson!
There are also wonderful bonus features, including the Donny and Marie Show guest appearance.",1419724800,,1744,4.891891891891892
