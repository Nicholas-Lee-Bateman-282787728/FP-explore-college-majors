8049766,2,B0007OP1AS,"The Crooked Circle sounds like a plot that should come from a comic book or pulp magazine.  Maybe it did come from there for all I know.  It's about 2 elite groups of people: one is a hooded bunch of criminals and the other is band of amateur sleuths.  When the Sphinx Club gets a member of the Crooked Circle arrested the criminals set out  to get revenge by assassinating one of the rival gang's more prominent members.

The two groups end up in an old house with a history of strange happenings.  It's also chock full of secret passages.  I'm a fan of secret passage movies, and this has enough for 2 or 3 movies.  The movie as a whole is slightly humorous as well as suspenseful so the overabundance of secret passages adds to the lighthearted nature.

Lots of problems lie herein not the least of which is the technical quality being so poor (more details on that below)  that it actually makes the movie hard to follow at times. I came away with several unanswered questions and wondering if  the movie contains answers lost somewhere in the indistinct picture and muddled audio.  Either way I thought the ending was weak.  I mean I don't have anything against the ending itself, more-so that the Sphinx Club is supposed to be an impressive gang of amateur sleuths yet seem to be the most clueless people in the whole movie except maybe for the couple that is there specifically for the comic relief.

Speaking of that comic relief it comes mostly by way of a bumbling policeman and an easily scared maid.  These two have their humorous moments, but both of them get tiresome rather quickly.  I guess they do get a pretty good payoff in the end.

Content:
This is an extremely tame flick even if it does deal with attempts at murder.

DVD:
I got mine in a 50 pack called Night Screams. The audio is distorted to the point of being difficult to understand. It's marred by consistent white noise with more pronounced pops throughout. Some of the lines are clipped. The image is trashy and fuzzy. It's washed out badly in some parts and is generally just a rough looking picture. There are no extras.

I found only 2 other DVD options: a box set called It Was a Dark and Stormy Night collection 4 and a DVD from Gotham Distribution both of which sound like they offer the same crappy quality that I got. The run time on the DVD is listed as 90 minutes, but I cant find any evidence that a cut that long exists and so suspect that it is wrong in the listing (its actually just under 60 minutes) though I cant actually say for sure.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
If you like the really old-dark-house kind of flicks and want one with a sense of humor this might be worth checking out. Don't expect too much out of it, though. And go as cheap as possible, because there doesnt appear to be an edition that offers even tolerable quality. Though I might have considered giving it 3* with quality so bad that I cant follow the movie its not getting more than a 2.",1521158400,,2947,4.402214022140221

8049769,4,B0007OP1AS,"""Don't be a-feared.""  Even though the evil gang `The Crooked Circle' has gathered to cast a vote of murder on poor Col. Walters (Berton Churchill).  They swear an oath on the head of a skull.  Their one and only female member receives the winning card and must do the evil deed.

But the `Sphinx Club' has been tipped off in advance and plans to thwart the attempt.  Soon everyone is gathered at the creepy old Melody Manor.  People glide in and out of secret passage ways as the bad guys (and gal) seek to accomplish their evil scheme.  Unfortunately, there are far too many red herrings.  Amongst the throng are a suspicious blonde, a suspicious swami, the worlds worst butler, a creepy guy with tomatoes, a befuddled cop (James Gleason), and Zasu Pitts (a former silent film star who's still far too generous with her overwrought gestures.  It's basically a one note performance, in this case an oft repeated ""Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"").

Played mostly for laughs, this overly complicated farce proves less of a mystery and more of a vain attempt to keep all the characters straight.  Still, it's always fun to watch James Gleason at work.  Zasu Pitts, on the other hand, is an acquired taste.  A little of her hand wringing goes a long way.  She gives a whole new meaning to `clinging vine.'",1433116800,,1290,4.700892857142857
8049770,3,B0007OP1AS,As a big fan of Zazu Pitts I bought this movie strictly because she was in it.  The movie is pretty good but I should also add that I'm a big fan of these types of movies.,1429833600,,171,3.6216216216216215
8049771,3,B0007OP1AS,"The code of the Crooked Circle: ""To do for each other, to defend any brother - a fight to the knife and a knife to the hilt."" Honestly, I don't know that this code has that direct of a bearing on the film, but, damn, if it doesn't sound cool.

The notorious Crooked Circle of Criminal Masterminds, comprised of four hooded men and one woman (also hooded), has had enough of the meddling of the Sphinx Club, that band of amateur criminologists. Eager to send a message, the Circle targets the Sphinx Club's leader, Colonel Theodore Wolters, for execution at the stroke of midnight. But because, for a bunch of so-called ""masterminds,"" they turn out not to be so bright, the Circle boasts of this intended act to Colonel Wolters himself.

The main character is Brand Osbourne (Ben Lyon), who's about to retire from the Sphinx Club to get married. Along with the other members of the Club, Brand vows to protect the Colonel's life at all costs. They plan to meet at Long Island's Melody Manor, newly owned by the Colonel, to await the assassination attempt. Things soon take an even more inauspicious turn as Brand's fiancee Thelma Parker (Irene Purcell) begs him not to show up at the Manor. Also, it seems that Thelma and oily new Sphinx member, Mr. Yoganda, are acquainted with each other. Later Brand is held at gunpoint in his own apartment as he's again cautioned not to show up at Melody Manor. Brand doesn't listen.

The venue now moves to the Melody Manor, a dark and dreary place with a menacing history. There, a leering hunchbacked butler lurks and a ghost plays haunting music on the violin. Or, as the fretful maid Nora (Zasu Pitts) is won't to proclaim: ""And every time the ghost plays that violin, something always happens to somebody."" Since THE CROOKED CIRCLE is firmly planted in the Old Dark House style, it's no shock that the characters soon bump into that sub-genre's signature contrivances, from hidden passageways and moving furniture, to frightful shenanigans and, naturally, a murdered corpse.

THE CROOKED CIRCLE is a 1932 black & white film straight from Poverty Row, so the stuff we're treated to is strictly no-frills and bare bones. It's a low budgeted sucker; the atmosphere isn't moody as much as it is just plain dark. These B-movie offerings usually don't come with a lengthy running time, and, at 59 minutes, this film doesn't give its stock characters a chance to develop. In fact, the most interesting character turns out to be the sinister Hindu seer, Mr. Yoganda, slated to be Brand's successor in the Sphinx Club and who several times warns that ""Evil is on the way."" The bulk of the plot is dedicated to a whole lot of the cast frantically running around from one room to another as various spooky sequences surface. In the last 10 minutes or so, the script writers finally seem to recall the Crooked Circle, and so that nefarious bunch is thrown back into the mix.

Zasu Pitts receives top billing, probably because she's the most well-known name here at the time. Yet she doesn't bring much to the table as she's perfectly fine with sticking to her normal Nervous Nellie act. James Gleason also shows up as a bumbling policeman. He, too, does his usual shtick. Their brand of comedy isn't really the reason to check out this film.

With this film being over 70 years old, be aware that there's an audible audio crackle in the background, although, to me, this actually contributes an added quaintness to it all. And, for what it's worth, the film even has a nice twist near the end.",1206230400,15,3999,5.042360060514373
