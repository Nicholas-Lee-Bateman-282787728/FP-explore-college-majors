7879806,4,6304937008,"The video does a great job of sharing the accomplishments of William Boeing and Alan and Malcolm Longhead (founders of Lockheed).  While made in 2005, the 95 minute video does not share much of the industry activities that in many cases shaped the priorities of these three aviation pioneers.  For those seeking information about these three aviation pioneers this will be a great video.  For those seeking video of events during aviation's golden years, you should also be delighted.  For those as interested in the broader industries activities beyond Boeing and Lockheed, the video will leave you wanting more.",1171756800,,613,5.161616161616162
