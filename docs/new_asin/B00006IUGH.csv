1777269,3,B00006IUGH,I was not very impressed with this collection of DVD's...Not because of the acting but the story line and the way it was filmed.  I think it could have been done better and was quite disappointed in the whole series.,1334620800,,216,4.4
1777270,3,B00006IUGH,"Nice deal on the DVD set....although the movies are a bit ""hokey"" is was OK to watch. Nice to get em as a set instead of individually but I only wish they were a flowing story instead of separate movies all by themselves which was what I expected. Overall though it is a nice set.",1310342400,4,280,4.109090909090909
1777271,5,B00006IUGH,"You have got to see this great movie series about being a Christian in Biblical times. The movies have action, drama, and the truth! The Truth is that God died for us on the cross. Christians and Nonchristians alike should see this great movie series.",1298764800,3,251,4.6
1777272,4,B00006IUGH,"While I don't think that the prophecied endtimes will turn out like that (especially with people getting a literal 666 put on their hands), I enjoy the last 3 of these movies for the spiritual truths they attempt to convey.",1294099200,2,223,4.6
1777273,4,B00006IUGH,"The Apocalypse Collection is a great witnessing series for new Christians.  I showed this series to a group of new teen converts and they were literally glued to the screen.  As of this day a few of them have totally changed their lifestyles and have become determined not to be left behind.  ( The Judgment DVD, however, had them puzzled some but overall the series is great.)",1283212800,13,377,4.597014925373134
1777274,4,B00006IUGH,This is a good video to watch...if you don't want to read the book (but the book is much better...from my what my two sister's told me).  Good to watch for Christian and Non-Christian.,1265155200,4,184,4.411764705882353

1777276,4,B00006IUGH,"This four part DVD collection shows an absolutely frightening description of the world during the reign of the Anti-Christ. The murders, tortures, and torment of those left behind, for some reason or another; but still keeping or finding faith for deliverance. The results of those who refuse to take the devils mark; the dreaded numbers, 666 in there hands or forehead. Excellent drama, action and suspense. Will really get you thinking about dusting off your bible.",1250726400,4,467,5.157894736842105
1777277,4,B00006IUGH,"The movies are great!  But they don't go far enough.  The only go into the tribulation.  I would like to see a movie atleast touch on when Jesus comes back...  That would have been nice to see what some portray to happen at that instance.  But all in all, they really are good and make even a proclaimed christian think about his/her life.",1227398400,4,339,4.317460317460317

1777303,5,B00006IUGH,"This collection follows the lives of various main characters as their world goes from normal and everyday to suspenseful and chaotic. Viewers will witness the trials and tribulations of these characters as they struggle through the end of days as foretold by the Bible. Faith will be tested, choices will be made, and the ultimate fate of the world and it's inhabitants will be decided. I recommend this series to fans of end time, apocalyptic films. Quite a few well known actors appear in the series. Also a good series to watch if you enjoyed the ""Left Behind"" series. :-)",1427068800,,575,4.76

1777310,4,B00006IUGH,"I bought these older movies on account of I'm very interested in Eschatology.  I was surprised to find that, with the exception of the first one, they're fairly well done, especially the 2nd one (Revelation) which has a lot of comedic acting overlaying a serious story.  I liked these better than the more recent attempts of making movies on this topic visavis the Left Behind series.  They're entertaining, have the salvation message, and are fairly well directed.  The acting ranges from mediocre to outstanding.  I recommend this suite of four movies for all who are interested in the End Times.  The stories are fiction, but some, not all of the storyline follows Biblical prophecy.",1417996800,,686,4.973684210526316

1777313,5,B00006IUGH,"I didn't really like ""Apocalypse"" as much as the other ones in the Collection Set but like the last 30-45 minutes of ""Apocalypse"" was the best of the first movie. The third movie: ""Tribulation"" is the best of all because Gary Busey and Margot Kidder stars. What ever happen to these older actors? We didn't forget them, like Hollywood thinks we did. I rather see the older actors than these young actors/actresses any day of the week. This movie collection tells about the coming prophecies in the Bible: Rapture, etc. The second movie ""Revelation"" starring Jeff Fahey, I liked it. I wasn't a big fan of Fahey (when Jeff was younger) until he started acting in Christian movies. If you liked him in ""Revelation"" check out the movie ""Marriage Retreat"" he's really good in that movie. At least, we thought so.",1410739200,,807,4.7304964539007095

1777322,5,B00006IUGH,"No one really knows what it will truly look like during the tribulation period except what the bible explains & some will agree that alot of the book of Revalation is symbolic as well as literal, but these movies, I believe come close to what it might be like. It's a good example for those of us waiting to be raptured. Lets stay prepared, the day is closer than we think & I definately don't want to stay for the tribulation. Stay strong my fellow brethren. Let us not become weary with waiting for our king to gather us together in the sky to meet with him, look up for our redemption is near...",1368230400,2,598,4.254385964912281
1777323,5,B00006IUGH,"Left Behind was okay, but not as good as the books. This series, however, was really good. Since no one here has done a review for each film, I figured I would do one.

.Apocalypse= The first movie in the series. It starts with the battle of Armageddon about to start, when all of a sudden the rapture takes place. The antichrist comes and brings peace to the world. A news reporter, Helen Hannah (Leigh Lewis), tries to convince her boyfriend that God is real and that the rapture has taken place. Meanwhile, Christians are being captured and arrested for their beliefs. I thought it was a good start to the series because it had action scenes and things that Left Behind didn't.

.Revelation= The second movie in the series. The Christians left behind discover a new technology, a pair of high tech goggles that can transport you anywhere you want, virtually of coarse. But they soon discover that things might be more real than they thought. I liked it better than the first film. The plot is starting to get thicker and the characters are developing. It also has a lot more action than the first film.

.Tribulation= The third film in the series. This movie starts before the tribulation. A detective ends up in a car crash and goes into a coma. When he wakes up, the rapture has already taken place. He soon becomes hunted by the authorities to receive the mark of the beast. This one was my favorite in the series. It had the most action and most surprises.

.Judgement= The forth film in the series. A Christian is put on trial on live television. Her lawyer tries to get her to take the mark so she can go free, all while she is trying to convert him. Meanwhile, other Christians plot to break her out. This was my least favorite in the series, but it had Mr. T in it so it wasn't all bad. Most of the movie was in a courtroom, though. I heard Cloud Ten plans on making a fifth film, so at least it doesn't end here.

I highly recommend this series if you're wondering what the tribulation will be like.",1365811200,11,2011,4.409703504043127
1777324,4,B00006IUGH,Now that the End Time has passed I wonder what the value of this is.  Enjoyable for entertainment though at a good price.,1357689600,,121,4.260869565217392
1777325,5,B00006IUGH,I ordered 3 sets.  1 for myself and 2 for others.  This is very close to what should be expected in near future.  These films were made in 1998-2000 and they are exactly what we are seeing happen right now and could not be more on target.  I recommend you purchase 2 or 3 set and give them to people.  Have group sessions and talk about them and how they relate to right now.  I will be ordering several more sets of this collection.,1357603200,17,433,4.095238095238095
1777326,5,B00006IUGH,I enjoyed this set very much. I think most people would enjoy it if  you are a Christian and if you aren't it should give you something to think about.,1352160000,6,151,4.033333333333333
1777327,1,B00006IUGH,outdated. from Jack Van Impe ministries.  I thought it was part of the left behind series.  It was not.  What a disappointment.  produced 2001 and before. lots of news clips trying to tie in to relate to endtimes.  Okay in that sense.  But it is outdated.,1335139200,2,255,4.434782608695652

7969379,3,B00006IUGH,"The only problem I found is the same I find with all the TV PREACHERS, they claim the ""rapture"" comes BEFORE the tribulation. This is untrue! In Matthew 24:29-31 it says AFTER THE TRIBULATION... HE GATHERS HIS ELECT(church). John 12:38 says the words Jesus spoke will be our judge and he spoke the words in Matt:24 so this word will he judge us with.

7969385,2,B00006IUGH,"Made on what seems like the collective budget of Roger Corman's pocket change, the Apocalypse series came about due to sibling writer-producers Paul and Peter LaLonde being unable to purchase to the rights to the highly-successful Left Behind book series. Not to be deterred, they instead made this painfully cheap series of knock-offs, and not a single damn was given that day. Released between 1998 and 2001, the series suffers from all of the problems one would expect from this kind of film. The directing (Peter Gerretson 1, Andre van Heerden 2-4) is at best flat and  lifeless, and at worst downright incompetent. The first film in particular appears to have been shot on consumer-grade VHS tape, with an overabundance of jarringly awkward zooms, dutch angles, and stock footage making for a decidedly uncomfortable viewing experience. The second entry improves matters somewhat, with a few interesting lighting set-ups and some effective composition. The action sequences however, fail to excite, and feel incredibly uninspired. The dialogue alternates between competently engrossing and blatantly on-the-nose. The acting comes across as amateurish, and the presence of several noteworthy character actors (prominently featured in trailers) doesn't help matters, simply making the majority of the cast look worse by comparison. This series seems par for the course for what the Christian film industry seems to have become. It's cheap, uninspired, and as pandering they come. Avoid at all costs.",1480636800,,1502,5.446351931330472
