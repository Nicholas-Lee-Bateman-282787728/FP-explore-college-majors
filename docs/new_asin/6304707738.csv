915798,3,6304707738,"The film was excellent, don't get me wrong.  It was the quality of the video that ruined my enjoyment of it.  I first saw the film in college during a film studies class, and it remains to be one of the coolest films ever.  However, the video was grainy and sometimes it was hard to make out the subtitles.  If you've never seen Le Jetee before, don't buy this video.  See it on the big screen when it'll be shown with good quality film.  Otherwise, you'll end up thinking that this film is lesser than it actually is.
It's surprising that with the popularity of this film and the technologies available presently that the subtitles weren't in yellow or another more visible color, and the transcription of video was so poor.  I know there is a DVD version, but it's dubbed and what made Le Jetee special was its quiet Frenchness.",992044800,9,830,4.456953642384106
915799,3,6304707738,This is a classic film that I first saw on 16mm during college. The bad news is that here the conversion to video is very poor. You can't really appreciate the best sequence in the film (the only true video for those who have seen it).,982368000,,235,4.130434782608695
915800,4,6304707738,"(Five stars if the transfer had been at all worthwhile...) This is one of the most influential movies I've seen in a long time - I've shown it to everyone I could collar. And yet I've always had to wince when I show it -  the transfer to video is so bad, I have to read the subtitles to them  (which I can only manage because I've seen it so often). Many of the scenes  are full of ""noise,"" the contrast fades, etc. So if you can find  a copy on DVD (it was released as one of many shorts on a DVD-based  magazine, ""Short Cinema Journal""), then do that. Otherwise, buy  this film!",949190400,4,580,4.043859649122807
915801,5,6304707738,"...and I do mean that! I saw this originaly in 1979, in England, and, was surprised to see it as the support feature for teh 1980's release of Vertigo. I was even more surprised to fidn a 16mm print at my local library  in Canada, and, then to see it here in Hong Kong last year. The best quality  copy is on DVD (""Short"" magazine). The U.K. (pal video) is  expensive but good quality. The u. S. video is not good...but better than  nothing! The english narration version is very different to the french  subtitles (changes meaning of sections). DO SEE AND HEAR THIS  MOVIE!

915802,5,6304707738,"This movie is magnificent. I often tell people to rent it with the warning that it is all stills, not an actual film in a motion picture sense. It is to me like watching a nightmare. Not so much in the content, although it is  scary. Its the execution. The way its filmed in black and white stills, is  just kind of how nightmares are to me haunting ghosts of images. Thats what  this movie is. Haunting!",945388800,2,404,4.220779220779221

I had to watch it four or five times just to get to the really intricate parts of this film; it is truly an all time winner!  Send  me an email if you have seen this, I would love to hear more feedback on  things I may have missed.",919468800,,326,3.8059701492537314
7876275,5,6304707738,"I bought this set only to see Chris Marker's 1962 short film La Jet&eacute;e.  As a fan of 12 Monkeys I wanted to see what the original 'looked' like and how the remake compared.
Very interesting.

The idea and concept of this packaged release is excellent and offers a veiw of several other film related things.",1495670400,,312,4.553571428571429
7876276,5,6304707738,"For all of you La Jetee fans out there, good news: Criterion has announced a restored re-issue of the film, in co-operation with director Chris Marker. The DVD will feature both French and English voice-over versions. Worth waiting for!",1175126400,,236,5.076923076923077
7876277,4,6304707738,"It's true; the picture quality is poor to middling.  But all the more evocative for it.  I haven't seen any version other than VHS, so I don't know what I'm missing.  But it was a captivating film.",1029369600,,197,4.27027027027027
7876278,5,6304707738,"Who would have thought that a 30 minute film made up almost entirely of still images could be one of the most riveting films ever made? The print on this VHS copy is old and dirty, and the subtitles sometimes fade into the background, but no matter; five minutes into this film and you'll forget about the problems with the print.
To say any more about it would give away too much of the story. Suffice it to say that this is one of the truely great science fiction films.",1029283200,5,472,4.2555555555555555
7876279,5,6304707738,"'La Jetee' is a pier in Orly airport on the eve of World War 3 and the destruction of Paris; a barely distinguishable harbour in a concrete sea.  Despite the title, the only mention of water in Chris Marker's film is to the waves of memory that carry the hero back to his past.  He is now a prisoner in an underground labyrinth undergoing experiments by scientists who, space having been made redundant, hope to puncture a hole in time, through which men can be sent to bring back desperately-needed supplies.  After many failures resulting in death or madness, they have chosen the hero because of his singular imaginative life, fixated on one moment in his childhood on the pier, the face of the woman who haunts him, staring at an unknown man rushing through the crowd.  Meeting her in the past, they go for walks, visit museums, sunbathe, sleep.  The journey to the past being so successful, they try to send him to the future.
Marker calls 'La Jetee' a photo-novel, and it is composed entirely of photographical stills, except for one montage that secretes a surprise that is one of the most unexpected, literally eye-opening joys of the cinema, all the more precious considering the general gloom of the work, the foreboding atmosphere of death, the images of destruction, the frozen tableaux of torture and sufering.  The term 'photo-novel' however, implies that the film could just as easily be enjoyed as a book, and Marker has released 'La Jetee' in such a format.  But the film doesn't work this way - not only is the editing and the variation of pacing the images crucial to how we receive them, long-held compositions alternating with abrupt montages; but these sets of images interplay with a typically layered Marker soundtrack.  This soundtrack itself has at least three components - the narrating voice, authorial yet phantasmal; the (often sacred) music; and the manipulated ambient sound, whether it is the conspiratorial whispers that accompany the underground experimental sessions, or the sinister, pumping beat that segues imperceptibly into Herrman's score for 'Vertigo' for the sequoia sequence.
Like Hitchcock's film, Marker's ur-text, 'La Jetee' is a bleak study in memory, in the tricks it plays, in its fusions with fantasies, desires, lies and repression, in its importance for defining the self or its dissolution.  For Marker, this interest has always been political, revealing the fragility of the subject caught in the annihilating marches of history, a history it tries to transcend or evade, but which eventually swallows it up and spits it out.
'La Jetee' is also an early cinematic classic of post-modernity, a vision of a future Paris that, like Godard's 'Alphaville', is a diagnosis of the present.  Marker's fearless command of the abstract rooted in the particular gives his films, and 'La Jetee' especially, a heady charge that could be mistaken for the spiritual (some of the scenes of torture are like religious ecstasies sculpted by Bernini), and which is all his own.",1019692800,16,3014,5.01
7876280,4,6304707738,"I originally saw this short as part of a film festival in Toronto.  The stylistic black and white photographs, overlayed with sound and music to create a complex emotion and story, were quite mature and forward thinking for its time.
I also believe this to be a major inspiration for Millennium, although, only for it's costumes, style, and voice.
I recommend seeing this in the original language with subtitles if possible.  This was consequently the source material for 12 Monkeys, although they are substantially different in tone and emotion.
While this is also on DVD in ""Short 2"", I recommend you watch the VHS version here, as the english narration on the DVD is quite distracting.",1019433600,8,688,4.922413793103448
7876281,4,6304707738,"The first-time viewer of ""La Jetee"" may be distracted by the subtitles and french narration. The DVD version (still in-print as ""Short 2 Dreams"") has crystal clear picture and english narration without subtitles. However, if you've only seen the original, this might not seem an improvement. While hearing the voice of a first person narrator can rivet the viewer (as in ""Sunset Boulevard"") the actual voice of a third person narrator isn't necessary. In fact, having to read the subtitles helps create a bond between viewer and story in ""La Jetee."" Hearing someone else's voice tell the story is like an annoying person sitting next to you in a movie theater. As I don't understand french, the original narrator became part of the ambience. Unfortunately the DVD doesn't feature the original version, and muting the entire soundtrack while using the TV's closed caption is not a solution. This long-time fan of ""La Jette"" is still stuck between the muddy VHS version and the picture-perfect but modified DVD.",1014940800,3,1009,5.047904191616767
7876282,5,6304707738,"(Forget the potentially misleading association of ""La Jetee"" with ""Etienne Becker,"" who is little more than an image in the film written and directed by Chris Marker.)
A jetty extending into the vastness of sea and sky, a man's awareness of the image of a woman he loves immediately followed by his awareness of a threatening agent of death. These are the 3 key images of ""La Jetee,"" a science fiction film that rejects futuristic fantasy and affirms the power of human memory, leaving the viewer with a haunting, unforgettable meditation on the meaning of human existence. The film contains only one shot with motion--so subtle, in fact, that I was unable to discern it in the VHS copy, which I consigned to the garbage. If you can't locate a good 16mm print and projector, look for a sharp DVD copy (but be careful--some DVD editions are nothing more than VHS flawed master copies released in a digital format that merely preserves the fuzziness of the inferior original).",1012521600,8,974,4.803571428571429
7876283,5,6304707738,"I tracked this movie down because it was the basis for one of my favorite films, Twelve Monkeys.  I was not dissapointed.  Though it is a short film, there is quite an emotional buildup.  The final scene, though predictable, is moving.  It's also an interesting cross between fantasy and science fiction.
Any fan of film should check this out.",1002585600,,343,4.762711864406779
7876284,5,6304707738,"Yes, a quality video trasfer is hard to locate-- and avoid ""translated"" DVD version regarding the narration (that ruins it).

There is just something eerily familiar about this film, brief as it is-- something so fundamental that it can't really be described adequately. (Though only produced in the haunted, Cold War, Twilight-zoned era of the early-1960s would this film have worked so well; for the viewer, however, the effect is timeless).
