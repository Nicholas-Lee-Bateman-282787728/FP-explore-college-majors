4588572,3,B0056HTEDQ,"The documentary is made with an artist's eye, but there's little beneath the surface. These people have very interesting lives and spiritual paths, yet the documentary just catches small events in their lives without providing background or meaning. I know little more about their religions than when I started the movie, but now I have more visuals to associate with those paths. I saw many interesting things and heard about many more, but with little explanation of how those things relate to the religious practice or the idea of being a mystic.",1400112000,6,549,4.978260869565218

4588575,1,B0056HTEDQ,"Three examples of trailer trash well on the road to self-delusion.  A rather attractive red haired witch who lives in a broken down trailer with her broken down boyfriend, an ex alcoholic Lhakota who hangs himself from trees by his flesh, but has to live in county housing, and a fat unkempt ""spiritualist"" who makes his living cleaning out stables.  Absolutely these are the folks you want to give you spiritual guidance--if you are a maggot.  Magic may or not work folks, but it ain't doin' all that well for these people.  If someone has any real power, any real  superior abilities, they aren't living on welfare, or in trailers and at least they should be able to control their own weight.  Let's cut the crap, and if we want a guru, at least let's have one who can support himself and his family.",1385424000,2,802,4.534722222222222
4588576,4,B0056HTEDQ,"What does a spiritualist medium in training, a practicing pagan priestess and a Native American sundancer have in common? Answer, they are the subject matter of the 2011 documentary film `American Mystic'. This unpretentious 81 minute Indie documentary introduces the viewing audience to 3 out-of-the-mainstream American spiritual seekers who, despite the obvious differences between their chosen paths, all share one central idea and ultimate goal. They all believe that there is more to life than what can be perceived through the five senses and long to see beyond the veil and experience God.

The storyline of the film is simple and uncomplicated, allowing each to speak for themselves. They share the personal memory of when they first became aware of their spiritual yearning, the steps they have taken to arrive at their present situation and what they hope lies ahead at the end of the road. Nothing too dramatic or revelatory here, just honest longing for that ""something more"" that awaits just out of reach.

Undoubtedly whether one likes or dislikes `American Mystic' will by-in-large depend upon ones personal interest in things of a spiritual nature. If you're someone who seeks to understand the reasons and motivations that lead an individual to a particular belief system you will appreciate what these three young people have to say. Conversely, if the spiritual quest is not something you care about you'll never last to the end. In other words what you bring to the viewing will make all the difference.",1326412800,33,1523,5.137096774193548

4588580,3,B0056HTEDQ,"I came to watch this because I'm reading Witches of America. No, it's not the greatest documentary, but it doesn't deserve all of the one star reviews it is getting. Perhaps those people are going into it expecting something different. I just wanted to see some people leading lives that are different (not better or worse) than my own. The storytelling could have been better-we are given glimpses and that's it. And I agree with the fragmenting. There are scenes in which the person speaking is not the one onscreen and that would have worked if Mar was trying to show something the two people had in common, but that is not the case. So three stars is fair.",1459036800,,660,4.554621848739496
4588581,4,B0056HTEDQ,"Movie was done well. Only part I did not enjoy was the pagan. That part seemed silly, over acted. While the native Americans were in t shirts and baseball caps, the pagan was in robes and speaking about goddesses.
I recommend the movie.",1454630400,,236,4.511627906976744
4588582,3,B0056HTEDQ,"I watched it after starting to read her book ""Witches of America"" and was really disappointed in the production and the events depicted. That is why I gave 3 stars. She writes very well and was I waiting for something as interesting as the book. There is no continuity in the film and it looks and plays like something patched together on a very low budget. Give it a chance if you haven't read the book and maybe it will make some sense to you.",1453593600,4,445,4.247058823529412
4588583,4,B0056HTEDQ,"This gives several types of spiritual paths & the people who who are living them.
Sadly, the ""witch"" path, the magical path is portrayed is the only one where you glimpse the
""mystical freedom"" and someone living it.
  The other examples were not as certain in their ultimate outcome. Being a mystic
is a vocation of total surrender to love. It is a calling. Those shone were trying, but need
a spiritual mentor for direction.
  I recommend those who are interested in ""American mystics"" to watch this & see what
you think of the examples presented. But it is not satisfying as it could have been.",1449014400,2,597,4.60377358490566

4588585,1,B0056HTEDQ,"This documentary revolves around three people who follow a mystical path--a member of the Spiritualist church, a Lakota man who Sundances, and a Witch who is part of the Feri Tradition.  It promised to be an interesting look at non-mainstream religions in America, but fell mostly flat.  The actual film quality was nicely done, but the documentary was way too slow and way too long.  How many times do we have to watch someone standing there looking out over the landscape while they play wind noises or some such?

For someone who doesn't know much about the Spiritualist Church, the Lakota religion and modern Witchcraft, this documentary would have fallen short of imparting any kind of real understanding.  Perhaps, it would have been better to include a greater depth of background into the Spiritualist Church, Lakota ways and practices, and Feri Craft in order to really get where these people were coming from.  As it is, the documentary tried to tie all of this together in some way to comment on mysticism in America, but it was a very clumsy effort that didn't much succeed.  What was the real point of this documentary?  It seemed lost most of the time...

If you wanted the documentary to be about mystic paths in America, there are many others out there besides these three, including more mainstream Christian religions that have mystical practices.  The same is true of Islam and Judaism.  But if the point was to look at less well known paths that the general population knows little if anything about, I would think this program would leave them more confused than anything.  It could also leave them thinking these people are just crazy.

I can't recommend this documentary, both because it was too slow, too long, and way too pretentious and because its content didn't really leave you with a deeper comprehension of mysticism in modern America.",1447027200,,1866,4.867088607594937
4588586,1,B0056HTEDQ,"The movie was only moderately interesting in spots but generally not enjoyable. The three main 'mystics' did not seem very intellectually or emotionally passionate and, in my opinion, were not mystics at all. They were practitioners of three different 'religions' but certainly not visibly or audibly mystical in any way.",1446508800,2,321,5.44
4588587,1,B0056HTEDQ,"Don't waste your time. The one kid that wants to be a healer tries to bend a fork with the power of his mind. It doesn't work, and neither do faith healers. They all look like they have one hand in your pocket and the other raised to a God. The Indian kid who wants to preserve his heritage should stop dressing like a cholo, and maybe get a job so he's not raising his family in county housing. As for the witch....I'm interested in 'The Old Religion', but why do Wiccan rituals always look so hokey? How can anyone keep a straight face saying those chants and invocations? Did the film makers intend to make it seem depressing to be spiritual? Did they intentionally choose 'losers' to feature? There is no depth to the stories ( maybe the people really aren't all that 'deep') and no clarity of intent of the documentarians. You can find better information on youtube.",1436486400,2,871,4.45

4588591,2,B0056HTEDQ,"I appreciate that I know more about these practices and the motives of the adherents for practicing them, that is why I gave it two stars. I did not like the quality of the film. The music was good, seemingly appropriate for the content and nice sounding. And I liked that those producing the movie chose subjects that are like the guy or gal down the street, not celebrities.

  The Bible specifically condemns mediums and spiritual divination in Leviticus ch. 19 and 20 and in Deut. 29:29 wherein God states that He has revealed in the Bible all that He would have us know about the spiritual realm. Those who practice divination do not know what kind of evil spirit they are inviting into themselves. The emergent church, and those who practice Reiki, New Age Spirituality, and Wicca all practice Hindu meditation. The purpose of it is to silence the thought process in an attempt to contact their higher powers, spirit beings that they can not really identify. This is a spiritually dangerous activity. A book titled A time of Departing, goes into detail about this. A dvd called Wide is the Gate also does a nice job explaining the dangers of such spiritual seeking. On this dvd, numerous authors and former New Age practitioners are interviewed in depth for your further inquiry.

  I started my spiritual searching with spirit-ism about 30 years ago and checked out all the major Eastern religions, rejecting Christianity from the beginning because I had some experience as a child in the Christian church and didn't like being judged by the self-righteous people in the church. After those 3 decades of searching for some meaningful religion whereby I might rightly worship God, I came back to Christianity after my life crashed. At 53, I was born again after reading all the way through the Bible. I had read all the major religions holy writings, in part at least, and had not found anything that could decisively answer my spiritual questions -- my quest began in my 20s after my mother's sudden death, I had to know about the afterlife. The Bible answered all these questions and I was rocked by the fact that this book was put together over a period of 1500 years and had threads of doctrine about sin, salvation by a Savior, repentance, God's plan to again dwell with mankind again running all the way through. I knew that no group of men could accomplish such a feat without divine inspiration.
  Reading through the Bible also helped me define succinctly the difference between Christianity and all other religions, all the rest are based on acquiring righteousness by efforts of some kind; Christianity is about discovering ones utter sinfulness and surrendering to Christ and receiving His righteousness. God the Father, who created the earth and the heavens and all things therein, who has determined that there will be a day wherein He will judge the world for their sinfulness, sent Christ to die for those who would believe in Him.
  Those words might seem judgmental or trite to someone who hasn't read through the Bible, I know because before age 53 I had only read various parts of scripture and didn't get a lot out of it.",1423180800,,3148,4.770220588235294
4588592,5,B0056HTEDQ,"An extraordinarily respectful and sensitive film. Each mystic's symbol systems and traditions differ, but their experience of the mystical seems strikingly similar. I think of myself as an agnostic spiritualistI have no theology, and I tend to be very judgmental of New Age claims. But these mystics feel like the real thing to me.

4588596,1,B0056HTEDQ,"This documentary takes a sad look at a randomized group of so-called mystics.  One of the most apropos lines is said by one of the ""mystics"" priming her audience for a spiritual fleecing.  She says ""let yourselves be used,"" and these poor people have all apparently served as the voluntary vessels of impractical, anti-scientific thinking.  Their lives have suffered, but they still have hoodoo to cling to as comfort from the fact that they've been duped by archaic wish-mongering.  I can't tell if the film's producers were aware of how silly it all looks because they chose as their subjects the most obviously delusional and yet they seem to be presenting them as genuine.  I believe the intent was to inspire, but the film is just depressing.",1403395200,,747,4.850393700787402

8459610,4,B0056HTEDQ,"Alex Mar has a keen eye for visuals, and this film is edited with a great deal of skill and thought.  The photography manages to show the beauty behind three fairly different landscapes, and Mar blends the three stories fairly well.  If there is a flaw with this film, it is with the storytelling.  There is no narrative or obvious focus for the ideas in the film, and therefore the viewer is left without a direction to process the information.  This may make the film seem flat.  I would like to see what Alex Mar does next as a filmmaker.",1488499200,,541,4.37
8459611,4,B0056HTEDQ,"""American Mystic"" follows three young Americans living in different parts of the country as they follow the spiritual paths to which they've dedicated their lives. Kublai is a strong, sensitive black man in rural New York state learning the ways of spiritualism and its tradition of healing. Chuck is a Lakota man with a wife and baby daughter following traditional ways, including Sun Dancing. He lives in Rapid City, South Dakota. Morpheus is a witch in the Fairy tradition, who with her husband has created a pagan sanctuary on 100 acres of land in California. I appreciated the strength, sincerity, and spirituality of each of these young adults. I liked the way the film balanced their personalities, traditions, and beautifully photographed home bases. Each of these paths emphasized love: Kublai's love of others; Chuck's love of place, family, and tradition; and Morpheus's love of the gods and goddesses and Mother Earth. I was left with a positive sense of reality, feeling of peace, and desire to find and follow my own spiritual path. Highly recommended. Four stars rather than five, because I reserve five stars for films that are intensely, overwhelmingly good and unique. This film was well-done and beautiful, but not quite in that elevated class.",1486339200,,1263,5.106280193236715
