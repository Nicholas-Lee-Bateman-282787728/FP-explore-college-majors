7826022,4,6302468035,"Imagine a world wherein direct-to-video movies could be good on purpose; wherein the cast, director, and producers actually made an effort to match Hollywood; and wherein performers who had never been seen on theater screens matched the big-name action heroes of the day. Whether I'm romanticizing things or if such a time really existed is a matter of opinion, but it's plain fact that ""Martial Law II"" is a very good low budget martial arts feature, able to match the offerings that Van Damme, Seagal, and Norris were putting out at the time and still good nowadays.

The story: the star police team of Sean Thompson (Jeff Wincott,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mission-of-Justice/dp/6302586313/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mission of Justice</a>) and Billie Blake (Cynthia Rothrock,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/China-O-Brien/dp/6305232725/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">China O'Brien</a>) is broken up just as an ambitious lord of the underworld (Paul Johansson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Highlander-The-Raven/dp/B00092A1J4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Highlander: The Raven</a>) rises to prominence, killing a policeman in the process. The two will have to reunite undercover to unearth the crime and expose it with their lives intact.

At the time of this one's release, the only performer who was properly established in the action genre was Cynthia Rothrock, but surprisingly, this isn't really her vehicle. She gets her share of the action, but Jeff Wincott - making his action movie debut - is the one who really takes the helm in driving the story, showing excellent poise as both a legitimate leading man and an action hero. He's supplemented by a minor super group of performers also on their way to becoming B-movie dragons: in addition to Johannson as the lead villain, there's Evan Lurie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hologram-Man/dp/B000EXDRMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hologram Man</a>), Leo Lee (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Replacement-Killers/dp/6304970471/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Replacement Killers</a>), and James Lew (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Balance-of-Power/dp/6304371128/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Balance of Power</a>) as respectively awesome henchmen and Billy Drago (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Untouchables/dp/B00029NKU6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Untouchables</a>) as a conflicted police captain forced to go straight. Nobody's really pressured into heavy acting, but I daresay everyone performs - physically and dramatically - to the best of their ability and to the extent their roles allow them.

The fight content really shines. Be warned, Hong Kong fans, none of it is overly flashy or terribly acrobatic - it's just good, solid western martial arts action with an emphasis on kicks and minimal gunfighting. It's hard to believe that this is the first karate film Jeff Wincott ever did, considering his proficiency in varied disciplines, including forms, (cine)fighting, and weapons handling; his scene with his trademark batons is particularly vicious. A few of Cynthia Rothrock's fights seem like filler despite her stellar forms, but she's afforded at least one standout battle at the end with the ever-worthy James Lew. Evan Lurie gives possibly the best martial performance of his career when he takes on two huge bodyguards in a handicap match and gets to show off just how tough he really is. Of the 'round eight or nine fights, few of them are standout material on their own but, in a rare feat, manage to come together to create a fulfilling tapestry of hand-to-hand action.

The film's production values are deserving of praise as well. All too many times when I watch a modern DTV movie, I get the impression that the filmmakers or the studio are discouraged from presenting quality production on account of their movie's relatively low distribution; ""Martial Law II"", on the other hand, seems to have been made with the mindset that, specifically because it wasn't bound for a theatrical release, it had to try all the harder to impress viewers with its slick camerawork, varied locales, and good-as-Hollywood presentation. Even the VHS cover looks like it could belong to a theatrical movie. Therein, like most action filmsfrom this era, it's a bit superficial, but what were you expecting? The story's interesting enough to keep you interested as you await the next randori and the whole package is attractive enough to interest even viewers who haven't been weaned off of the big budget productions yet. Why this one hasn't gotten a Region 1 DVD release yet is beyond me. Get it.",1254268800,2,4853,6.185185185185185
7826023,4,6302468035,"Once again Jeff Wincott (Mission of Justice, Deadly Bet, Fatal Combat) stars in another above average martial arts flick.  Though Martial Law II isn't the best out there in my opinion, it is one of the best well-rounded B-action movies with great action, good story, and enjoyable characters.

In addition to the wonderful Wincott, Cynthia Rothrock (Tiger Claws 1,2,3, No Retreat No Surrender 2, China O'Brien), another popular martial artist, co-stars in Martial Law II.  Unlike most of their films, Wincott and Rothrock appear to have less screen time, but it works out alright cause the remaining screen time is devoted to pretty cool charactcers, such as Evan Lurie (American Kickboxer 2, Tiger Claws 2) Billy Drago (The Circuit), and even James Lew (American Ninja 5, The Perfect Weapon, Balance of Power).  Evan Lurie plays one of a few villains in the movie,Billy Drago plays one of the few crooked cops wrapped up in the decent storyline, and James Lew plays one of the lesser villains who ends up having a small but cool fight against the Cynthia Rothrock charcater.

The action is great, easily above par.  There is not an overload of fight scenes, but what there is, is great.  I especially loved the underground club fight scene.  The Evan Lurie character takes on 2 massive bodyguards, all part of a big business bet and in front of spectators.  He kicks there butts all over the place.  Not too long of a fight but it is well done and looks awesome.  The final fights in this movie were also awesome, Wincott versus the 2 main villains.

Martial Law II is a good solid flick.  Nothing is just all out wow in this movie, but the well roundedness makes it quite enjoyable.  Wincott fans, Rothrock fans, martial arts action fans will not be disappointed.",1164326400,,1765,4.7631578947368425

7826025,5,6302468035,"This movie is worth a look due its action and professional martial artists. Jeff Wincott (The Killing Man) and Cynthia Rothrock (LadyDragon) are in top form, making every blow to the bad guys seem like a walk in the park. There is even a small role with Billy Drago (LadyDragon II also with Ms. Rothrock) B-movie's best bad guy and veteran of many martial art films. Money well spent for a kicking good time.",990748800,,408,4.527027027027027
