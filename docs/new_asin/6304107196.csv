7861662,5,6304107196,"I have been looking everywhere for this Christmas special. I remember watching it and crying when Pinky gave Brain the world keychain. It was such a touching moment. I searched and searched for this so I can give it to my three year old. She loves Christmas just as much as I do. When she sees a plane or something in the sky she points and says it's Santa. This Christmas, we're going to sit around the TV and watch this episode. We'll make it a yearly tradition until the end of time. Or until the video tape dies.",1298246400,,516,4.222222222222222

this is ladies and gents one of the best episodes for ANY animated series out there, but don't watch it in front of your girl! you don't want her to see you crying! It doesn't go well with your macho persona!

Im 23 and I still cry everytime I see it.....what about my girl you say? I just avoid human contact meanwhile....... ;)",1223251200,,462,4.287356321839081
7861664,5,6304107196,"If you like ""Pinky and the Brain"" then you will enjoy this Christmas show.  It has all the regular features of the show, with an added Christmas flair.  My son (7) liked it, but I bought it because I am a big fan of these two mice. My wife and I discuss which is the genius and which is insane.  Listen carefully to the opening song; the words are different than the typical show.",1198713600,,380,4.108108108108108
7861665,5,6304107196,One of my favorite Christmas specials; it actually makes me cry if I haven't seen it in awhile!,1179360000,,95,4.333333333333333
7861666,5,6304107196,"The test of a truly extraordinary production, long or short, is its ability to evoke a broad range of human emotions, and that is exactly what ""A Pinky and the Brain Christmas"" does. From the opening scene, in which Pinky gleefully sings ""Deck the Halls"" while sliding down a decorative Christmas ribbon, to the ending, when they exchange gifts, our little mouse friends take us on an emotional journey.  We laugh hysterically as they are flown to the North Pole by a character strangely similar to ""Large Marge"" in ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"".  Later, we are captivated by Brain's brilliant pitch and Pinky's familiar, delightful giggle, as they interview to become new elves in Santa's workshop.  Then, in the the end, when Brain exasperatedly begins to read Pinky's selfless, innocent letter to Santa, we are moved to tears right along with him.
  In many ways, this episode is like any other charming, thought-provoking ""Pinky and the Brain"" offering; Brain conceives a brilliant plot to take over the world and Pinky laughingly assists him along the way, sometimes for better and sometimes times for worse.  This time, however, Brain's plan ""fails"" by his own choice.
  It is Pinky's innocence and loyalty to his friend that make this episode such special and touching Christmas fare.  Watch it and you are guaranteed to fall in love with these little ""rodents"", if you haven't already.",1045872000,9,1389,4.978354978354979
