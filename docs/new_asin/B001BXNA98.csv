8326291,1,B001BXNA98,"I bought this DVD and didn't play it for awhile (my error),  Although the DVD info says it is in English, it is NOT.. The DVD case with the word BIO. written on the case contains a DVD in Spanish and there is no set up option to change that.  Since I didn't play it right away, I am stuck, but don't make my error unless you are fluent in Spanish.",1503964800,,347,3.8732394366197185
