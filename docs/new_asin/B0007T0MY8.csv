8454009,2,B0007T0MY8,"Solid if unspectacular Uk low-budget action film.  My biggest problem with this film was it's lack of scope. For a short film (it's only just 60 mins long) it has a cast of less than 5 or 6 and often looks like it was shot in the film makers bedroom.

This isn't to say that it has it's moments.  Steve Lawson's fight with Wyndham and Chris Jones is pretty good but the whole thing just feels pretty small.",1124409600,,406,4.17948717948718
