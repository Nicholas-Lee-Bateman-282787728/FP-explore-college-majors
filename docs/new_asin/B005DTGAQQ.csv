4661802,2,B005DTGAQQ,"Being that this is another reissue, repackage, with some really lame bonus material that you can see for free on Youtube, I cannot see purchasing this over the previously released Protoculture Edition, or prior releases.

Had their been additional animation that was unreleased, like Sentinels material, or Dorvack, dubbed into Robotech, etc. I could see warranting a purchase, but the fact rremains that the most you will get out of this set other than the same old 85 Robotech Eps. is a rushed, lame version of MOSPEADA's Love, Live, Alive. Which, with no remastering visuals, or Blu Ray is like watching classic anime from the late 70's or early 80's. Do waste your money. Watch it on your Youtube app for free on your cell, or on your tablet, Hulu and YT, even Veoh for free is the way to go. Unless you need to nap for over 35 hours without the PC on then by all means. Otherwise, save your money for a real new Robotech production in about 2 more decades.",1320883200,9,961,4.554913294797688
4661803,5,B005DTGAQQ,"If you need an introduction, look no further than this: Robotech is an innovator and legend in Sci-Fi.

This show is responsible for many ideas that came after it. It set the bar for animation, sci-fi, storytelling, and character arcs. If you have not seen it, do so
immediately.

For those of you who are waiting for Blu Ray, continue to do so. It will be worth it.

5 stars for Robotech, 1 star for waiting for the Blu Ray release.

Robotech is SO worth it, and it will be in your heart forever..... guaranteed. You won't be able to stop after you see the first episode.

Let yourself experience this masterpiece!",1319500800,,615,4.455357142857143
4661804,5,B005DTGAQQ,"I don't remember this series.  I was eight at the time this brilliant show aired, and I was never aware of its existence which is REALLY sad considering this anime rocks on ALL conceivable levels!  What made me aware of Robotech was the fact that Macross was related to it.  I remember how I felt after watching Super Dimensional Fortress Macross II, the one that focused on Ishtar, Silvie Gena and Hibiki Kanzaki, when I was devoloping deep feelings of interest for anime in general.  At the time and even now, I thought to myself, ""What a stellar anime!  I wonder where it got its origins and ideas from.""...
Which brings me to Robotech.  So far, I've only finished the Macross saga, and am now starting to get introduced to the Masters saga.  I absolutely LOVED the Macross saga!  ALL of the voice actors did an exceptional job on making their characters believable and realistic.  I especially believed in and rooted for Lisa Hayes character!  She's the one who made a serious impression on not only my mind, but my heart.  Whoever did her voice is probably the same woman who did the voice of Relena Peacecroft from the Gundam Wing series (another excellent anime.  Lynn Minmay (Operation Minmay) was a cute character.  Although she seemed naive at times.  An ""innocent"" girl with an extraordinary voice, she performed at concert events with the help of her cousin and manager (can't recall his name because he was such a jerk to not only Minmay, but to military oriented personal.  My least favorite character.  And finally Rick Hunter.  I liked him, but I liked his older brother Roy Foeker (the original ""skull leader"") better.
All in all, an OUTSTANDING anime and that's a SERIOUS understatement!  I highly recommend it to all!!",1319155200,8,1737,4.752508361204013
4661805,5,B005DTGAQQ,"This is great I cant wait Iam preordering this. Robotech is an awseome starter anime for anyone interested. I got started on Robotech when my friend lended me his entire collection. He had the whole set even the extra dvds. So after watching it i made it my personal goal and track down all the dvds like he did but alas  the only ones i found were the last 3 of the macross saga and the movie. Now I can buy them all at once sucess. Like I said Robotech is a great anime plus if you like this you should get Tekkaman Blade complete set as well not the crummy english one Technoman B/c the english vertion screws the whole story up all the names of the most important characters are wrong. Even the main charcaters name is wrong.  Even the acting sucks. Well back to robotech this anime the english cast did a great job so pick it up.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teknoman-Complete-Collection/dp/B00151QYGM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teknoman Complete Collection</a>",1318204800,4,1006,5.054216867469879
4661806,5,B005DTGAQQ,"I have to admit that I really wasn't interested in anime and/or Robotech, until a friend got me to sit down and watch a couple of episodes. Sometimes, the original is best and 'Robotech' meets with my approval! Fascinating series, with better animation than any other anime series I've seen on television or DVD. I've ordered my copy and can't wait to see the many hours of bonus features that are promised!",1316736000,2,407,4.666666666666667
4661807,5,B005DTGAQQ,"I thought I'd leave a 5 Star review to balance out the one below.

Look, it's unlikely we're going to get the entire show redone to Blu Ray standards. Even if we could, it'd still be in the 4:3 presentation. So if Harmony Gold released a Blu Ray edition, it would essentially be the DVDs on Blu Ray - now that would be ripping off the public.

This release is simply to keep the show stocked for new fans, completists or old fans that need to replace the discs.

As a Robotech fan who lived for years and years with incomplete releases (The Perfect Collection from Streamline comes to mind or the mind blowing 2 episodes per tape FHE release [that was a rip off], Sci Fi played the show, but they also edited it to fit in more commercials, I could go on), I still kind of marvel at how effective robotech.com has been at unifying the fan base and keeping the show in the market.

Lord knows, the 90s were dark times...

So be careful what you wish for. Robotech has a large fan base, but it's nothing like Transformers (to use another 80s tv animation). If this show doesn't make constant efforts to stay fresh and make new fans, it'll basically disappear again.

With no new content down the pipeline (that we really know about, I'm not counting the movie, which I don't think will ever be made, Maguire just bought the rights cause it was there to be bought, but I digress...), Robotech may be on the endangered species list (again) soon. It's come back from near death quite a few times, but it's never taken over the market in the way it so deserves, or in a manner that guarantees its prominence 10, 20, 30 years into the future.",1314662400,48,1634,4.358552631578948
4661808,1,B005DTGAQQ,"Gee, can I buy this all over again for the 3rd or 4th time on DVD?  Or, you could try a Blu-ray release and get people to actually buy it... again....

Hey, I'm not saying that the show is bad.  It's great.  I just don't feel like buying it again.  If they could do a good Blu-ray release, then I'd pay a lot more.  I'm just bummed out that there is no BD version.",1314316800,16,364,3.8513513513513513

4661810,5,B005DTGAQQ,"Exactly like what I remembered growing up. The sound is amazing. Nothing cut nothing edited. Right down to Dana Sterling's shower scenes. Which I distinctly remember due to the fact that this was aired on television and I was only thirteen at the time.

Just goes to the quality of the remastering of this very loved animated drama. Thank you, A&E!!",1413244800,,349,4.721311475409836

I have been a big fan of the Robotech series since the 80s!  This collection saves space compared to my vhs copies, and I'm looking forward to watching the newer special features included in the discs.  Robotech was one of the first anime series to exist in syndication, so I must pay homage.",1386806400,,428,4.835616438356165

4661818,5,B005DTGAQQ,"I grew up with Robotech, and really like the story line.  I have even read all of the books -- from the Macross Saga to the Sentinels.  Now, granted, the anime series isn't as detailed as the books, and there are quality differences between the different Saga's, but taken as a whole, the entire story is great.  If you're into Robotech, I highly recommend getting this boxed DVD set.  I'm currently re-watching it now, and so far prefer the artistic style of the Macross Saga compared to the Master's Saga, but if you can get past that, and considering the continuity of the story as a whole, it's great.

As an analogy, I often bring up the Alien movies series.  Many people dislike the third installment where the dog is the host for the alien, and we find out that Ripley has one in her.  Most people's complaint (as was mine when I first saw it), was that they used digital animation for most of the alien creature instead of someone in a costume.  Granted, it wasn't the best animation, especially compared to these days, but when you consider how the third installment fits into the whole Alien series, it's really a great story and has many subtle levels that create unique dimensions to the Saga.  The same holds true for the Robotech series.",1383091200,2,1251,4.549107142857143

8467452,1,B005DTGAQQ,"I loved Robotech growing up, and I had gotten the Legacy DVD sets for the 1st & 3rd generation.  I was finally wanting to get the 2nd generation and I found that this compact, remastered set was released.  It seemed great.  Then, I found out, from IMDB (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088595/parentalguide?ref_=tt_stry_pg), that newer releases of Robotech had the nudity stitched back into them.  This set has that nudity.

One of the terrific services that Carl Macek did, in addition to stitching three separate Japanese animations together into a coherent story, was clean them up for consumption. This release undoes that service.  I will now go hunting for the older versions of the 2nd generation discs.",1439164800,,707,5.267857142857143
8467453,5,B005DTGAQQ,Good way to keep all released Robotech episodes (including The Sentinels episode and the original made for TV movie) in your own personal archive.
