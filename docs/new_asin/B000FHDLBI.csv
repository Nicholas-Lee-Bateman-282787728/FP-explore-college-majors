If you are a complete beginner, you will be so bored with the repetitiveness of this workout,  that you'll never want to work out again!  Please do yourself a favor, and look for better workout dvds on Amazon or elsewhere.  This one is perfectly awful!",1493251200,,365,4.553846153846154

8122601,2,B000FHDLBI,"The routines were definitely at the beginner level .. which would be fine except the back cover states for beginner through advanced. The instructor wasn't breathing hard and neither was I (I'm at the intermediate level). On the plus side, the instructor has a pleasant personality and the moves are easy to follow. So if you are an absolute beginner, I would give this 3 or 4 stars. If you're more advanced than that, I would look elsewhere.",1348617600,3,442,4.67948717948718

8122603,4,B000FHDLBI,Three good segment choices of varying difficulty with warmup and in twenty minute chunks make this a decent workout video. The lead woman is not annoying and the set up and music are enough to get you there but not distracting. Probably not flashy enough for some but as something to get me up and moving this works very well.,1313798400,,326,4.45
8122604,4,B000FHDLBI,"Suzanne Cox does a good job at providing a workout for both new and advanced or more athletic individuals.  I like the first and third workout on this DVD the best.  I got this DVD in the $1.00 bin at a local Walmart and it has been a true lifesaver.  On those nights I don't feel like hitting the track or the eliptical, it truly spices up my workout.  I lost 5 lbs in one week doing just video's by Suzanne Cox.  Along with a healthy diet of course!  I recomend this and her others to anyone who wants to start with a low impact workout and work up to a high impact over time.  If you a true first timer and want to start slow buy her ""Firm It Up"" Video and start with that one.  Then move on to ""The Fix""",1207526400,,707,3.895104895104895
8122605,5,B000FHDLBI,"Three great 20-minute workouts:  One athletic aerobics, one dancey aerobics, and one floorwork toning.  The music is thumping, the lighting is interesting, and the instructor (a former Gladiator from the UK) has a very friendly and non-intimidating attitude.  Money well spent!",1169683200,4,277,5.7073170731707314
