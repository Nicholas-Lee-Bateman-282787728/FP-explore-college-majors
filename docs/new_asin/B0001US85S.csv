2024314,4,B0001US85S,"When Rod Serling wrote ""A Stop at Willoughby"", his character, Gart Williams was a 38 year old executive that could not compete anymore in the rat race, dreaming of an age when things moved slower. He eventually is accounted as a suicide off a homebound train. In ""The Emperor's Club"" a teacher of long standing at a private school is passed over for a younger person to become the Dean. He resigns immediately but is compelled once again to return at the bequest of the younger Dean in pursuit of an alumni donation, where Mr. Hundert's services as a teacher are once again required.
This is the same storyline but with a different approach. Our executive is Michael Caine and he, like Gart Williams is in the advertising business. In a great reverse effect, the main character becomes a murderer /hero as at first he executes an agressive and violence prone subway beggar by accident with a subtle push as a train just happens to come by.
He leaves the subway like Paul Kersey in ""Death Wish"", climbing the stairwell amid the chaos as the Police run down the steps. This chance event now twists his mind and he begins to consider murder as a final solution with everyone in his way. Interesting and in some ways oddly funny, because you always know what is going through his mind at all times. The theme negates the term ""You can't always get what you want"" and it is somewhat of a fantasy of course. If there is anything negative to say  perhaps it  is that Caine seems very out of place using foul language here and there in the film. If you can overlook this over indulgence, it is an entertaining work.",1239926400,2,1607,4.518900343642612
2024315,5,B0001US85S,"Michael Caine is fantastic as Graham Marshall, a advertising exec who has been playing the game for many years, waiting his chance to be the big boss.

2024316,5,B0001US85S,Michael Caine gives a great performance in this movie as he was passed over for a promotion. He plays by the rules only to get trampled by those less deserving of said promotion.

2024318,4,B0001US85S,"Here's where Michael Caine shines, as a corporate exec who gets passed over for the promotion he's so feverishly expecting he'll get in favor of a young Turk--well played by Peter Reigert--who lords it over Caine's character in subtle (and not so subtle) ways. Caine's wife, also well played by Swoosie Kurtz, one of the great unknown American stage and film actresses, is a serious [problem] to him. So he has two people in his life who are supremely annoying.
What does he do? Well, let's just say that his solution to these two problems ends in the population of the world changing, shall we?
The dialogue in this very smart blackly comic thriller is sharp as a razor; it's a lot of fun to watch Mr. Caine give us his best as a put upon exec who's more than capable of flying into a rage at the drop of a hat and of executing his very sneaky and well thought out plans for revenge. Also on hand is Elizabeth Perkins, an equally intelligent office colleague who attracts Caine in more ways than one, but does not suspect him of any wrongdoing at all. That is, until...
One of the best office comedies around, A Shock to the System is a stinging portrait of greed and selfishness in America--for my money, far better than the somewhat overblown Wall Street. This is a movie that gives you a great evening's entertainment and part of the reason for that may be to secretly exact vengeance upon those corporate bigwigs who've prevented you from getting a job for so long, given this miserable economy.
Great job. Highly recommended.",1085270400,19,1531,4.570909090909091

2024360,3,B0001US85S,"'Shock To The System' is a film that might make many people's wishes come true. Wishes that they could never in their right minds fulfill. A middle aged man has given his life to his job, to his marriage and, he finds himself in a messy mess. His reward for all this work is to find himself looked over in a promotion, and a wife who won't forgive him for not receiving that promotion.

Michael Caine plays Graham Marshall , the man awaiting that promotion. His wife, played by Swoozie Kurts celebrates his anxiously awaited promotion. Frustrated that his hated life will never change, he devises a plan to take revenge on everyone who humiliated him, and he starts with his wife.  The film has several actors who will surprise you because they are so young!

Michael Caine is a genius in this type of film. It is not a nice film, per se. Elizabeth McGovern plays a colleague, young, lithe and adoring. It takes awhile for her to realize what a new life with Graham would be all about. This is a film that keeps you off balance, I was never sure which way the wind would blow, so to speak. Will Patton, ( you will recognize him, right away), plays a Connecticut State Policemen. Always prepared, ever sympathetic, but he has a mind that thinks like a criminal. Why he is the only State Policeman in the state to conduct murder investigations is never explained, but he must be one heck of a busy man!

This film will bring laughs, some 'uh, huh's', and some indecision.  I liked it, Michael Caine is a terrific actor, and he brings his best to this film.

2024362,4,B0001US85S,"Humorous story of basically decent corporate executive who accidentally kills someone, is not caught, then decides to resolve personal and occupational difficulties by committing murders.
  A great performance by Michael Caine, well-crafted script, and capable direction.
  Made during the era of ""downsizing"" and ""re-engineering"" of corporations in the 1980's, ""A Shock to the System""  demonstrates the road to success in an age of cut-throat capitalism which regards employees as objects to be used, discarded, and destroyed, is to become a destroyer of persons.  The latter is considered a crime, while the former is considered ""adding values for the stockholders.""  Caine's character's rise on the corporate ladder is directly related to his willingness to regard  objects to be elliminated rather than as human beings.
  Typical of the film's polished style is the title, which refers to a home wiring accident which briefly injures Caine's character, Caine's pass-over for promotion and humiliation, and also Caine's recipe for personal success - administering shock to the corporation's ""system.""",1366761600,5,1103,5.670731707317073

2024365,5,B0001US85S,"If any movie exemplifies the pitfalls of the upwardly mobile 1990's, it this movie here, A Shock to the System. It glorifies, yet vilifies, the face of corporate mobility, the infighting, the shifting loyalties, the costs and what it really takes to make it to the top.

There are undeniable elements of dark humor in this movie. The other reviews are testament to this part of the movie. There is however more social commentary present. Corporate attitude and disparity in the social classes are plainly set out and exhibited. This can be seen in the many portions of the movie where Caine the corporate warrior walks past homeless people camped in the streets of New York. The superficial camaraderie and brutal, smiling infighting of corporate life has rarely been better captured on film.

The movie features the music of Gary Chang played by the Turtle Island Quartet, which adds to the bittersweet atmosphere of this film.

The topping of this movie is the acting of Michael Caine. Caine brilliantly portrays a corporate officer who has been turned down to a promotion. Through machinations and scheming, he covets the higher position and eliminates everyone in his way. His acting in this movie is a gem in a long and stellar career.",1351814400,,1240,4.895238095238096

The good news is that he's expecting a major promotion that will at least cure his financial ills.

Then the promotion instead goes to one of his current underlings, and Caine's new boss delights in further undermining Caine's work stature. Caine decides to rid himself of his nagging wife aggravation by teaching his wife how to reset the system in a manner likely to shock her (she dies), eliminates his second source of major upsetness by blowing up his new boss, and eventually gets the CEO position by sabotaging the man's plane prior to a flight over a desolate area. En route to resolving this sources of aggravations, a pesky police Lt. starts piecing things together and almost gets a key piece of evidence from Caine's secretary that would prove Cain's guilt. However, Caine gets the evidence back, rewards the secretary with a promotion and reassignment to the West Coast, and everyone lives happily ever after.

2024379,5,B0001US85S,"I LOVED THIS FILM WHEN I saw it during it's first-run release in 1990 !  One of MICHAEL CAINE'S best performances.

Ever miss getting a promotion at work ?  Ever been replaced in your job by someone much younger ?  Ever been told that the ""companies taking a different direction"", and you won't be heading in that direction because your ""services are no longer needed"" ?  Or, the classic:  ""Sorry, but we're 'downsizing', and a number of our employee's will not be needed anymore.""

Okay, well if  you've ever been involved with the ""corporate world"" for any length of time, and, in any of those situations listed above, you'll understand the frustration of Caine's character (Graham Marshall)...and his need for not only ""getting even"", but for total revenge !

I love Elizabeth McGovern anyway, and she is beautiful and perfect in her role here with Caine as the one he can turn to in his ""time of need"". (She has since moved to England, and has received great Reviews for her work in the highly acclaimed BBC Production of ""Downton Abbey"".)

I will not spoil the film by giving you any hints as to how things eventually work out for Caine & his cohorts: I'll just say this is one of the BEST Black Comedies that you've probably never seen.

Swoozie Kurtz, Peter Riegert, Will Patton, and a super-cast all add to the mix.  ""A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM"" is available on DVD and can also be downloaded.  Watch & enjoy !!",1326153600,,1414,4.563492063492063

2024386,5,B0001US85S,"This movie is considered as black comedy by some, but I dind't see it as such. I saw it as a uniquely portraited drama/comedy about the reality of corporate America. Anyone who has actually worked in corporate America will see the subtle humor and the reality of the story behind this movie's plot.

Michael Caine may be at his best in this movie...the story includes watching Caine deal with his clueless tennis mom wife who has grown accustom to his ability to always pull off the impossible and come out on top...providing her with her every whim. He has grown tired of the daily grind over decades of commuting to the corporate slime pit and when he gets the corporate bird thrown at him he stumbles into the means for revenge.

You become a part of his plight as you find yourself pulling for him to get away with murder....because you know how it feels to be the one screwed.

Caine is brilliant as he delivers quip after quip to his new boss (who has just leap frogged him into the position he has been working for for decades, only to be snubbed for ""not fitting into the new program somehow"")...the story is very believeable and the twists of the story turn on where his cigarette lighter which ties nicely into the symbolism of the subordinates lighting their superior's cigars throughout the movie.

If you are looking for a humorous and well played drama with great acting by all the players this is a sleeper which will become one of your must have DVD's.

8016297,2,B0001US85S,"Review of A Shock to the System
Hot Toasty Rag, December 6, 2017

In this off-beat thriller, Michael Caine plays a very unhappy man. Hes frustrated with his wife, Swoosie Kurtz, bogged down by expenses and problems with his house, and hes desperate to get a promotion at work. When his friend and coworker John McMartin gets sacked and Peter Reigart gets the promotion instead, Michael loses it.

Im a pretty big Michael Caine fan, so this wasn't the best choice of film for me to watch. He plays someone who basically has an undiagnosed nervous breakdown and acts out in psychotic ways. He narrates the film and refers to himself in the third person, hallucinates, and plots the murders of those around him. I prefer to see him in dreamier roles, but if you don't mind him shouting and acting like an evil lunatic, youll be in a better position to appreciate the movie.

A Shock to the System is a very dark comedy. As dark comedies aren't my preferred genre, I didn't really end up liking the film. In the spirit of fairness, I put myself in the shoes of someone who does like this genre, and for those with a more sardonic sense of humor, its probably very entertaining. Theres a side love story with Elizabeth McGovern, lots of tension when Michael Caine is plotting his schemes, and twisted humor running throughout. Those who feel out of control of their lives will probably really like this flick.
