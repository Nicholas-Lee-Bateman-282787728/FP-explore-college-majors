2837905,5,B000QFAFRC,"It deserves 6 stars and I hope they make a new season.  If you like this show, you will also like True Heroes and Man vs Wild.",1205971200,3,126,3.6666666666666665
2837906,5,B000QFAFRC,"I loved this show when it was on, and then it just dissappeared and the discovery channel website said nothing about it which was frustrating.  I was thrilled to see that the show was being released on dvd.  There are like 24 episodes in this set and they are all good.  I have given this as a gift to several people and it is very popular.  Many people never saw the show when it was on and so it is all new to them.
The survival stories are amazingly recreated with actors and on camera interviews with the real life survivors.  Not everyone survives in these stories and you can kind of quickly figure that out when that person never shows up on screen in an interview.  It is sad.  I highly recommend this set if you enjoy shows like this.  I had a few problems with the dvds skipping (right out of the box) but it tolerable and did not happen on each disc.",1190851200,23,861,4.175757575757576
2837907,1,B000QFAFRC,This version has less footage than the version you order on line at the Discovery Channel website. This version does not have the commentary with survival experts. Discovery Channel is trying to pull a fast one on us.,1190678400,40,217,4.7368421052631575
2837908,5,B000QFAFRC,Awesome! I really enjoyed this show!  I hope they add more seasons.,1520726400,,67,4.583333333333333
2837909,3,B000QFAFRC,Good series but it plays like a TV show for people with no attention span. Repeating story and scenario constantly as filler is extremely annoying.,1520467200,3,147,4.92
2837910,5,B000QFAFRC,This is my favorite show. It is so well done and tells unimaginable survival situations and the triumph of the human spirit to persevere through the toughest moments in life. I wish they still made more episodes because I know there are countless stories to be told.,1520208000,,266,4.680851063829787
2837911,5,B000QFAFRC,"ok maybe I Shouldn't Like This As Much as I Do .. (lol)
 but the title says it all ..
 I got 6 (yes, six) seasons of this which is included with my Amazon Prime membership .. it included so many episodes and I would watch them (even during the day !!) when I am working on the phone, or doing something else, and this flippin thing is addicting .. !! I loved seeing the people beat the odds thorugh ingenuity, planning, tenacity, or even just plain Luck .. it was riveting and without the commercials .. ! lol the intro (and exit) where the commercials are supposed to be .. some repeated scenes for sure, but overall this was much better (to me) than watching Harry Potter or some sensationalistic mystery show .. because all of these are based on true events of what Really happened ..  Id say 5 stars just because of that .. but 4 1/2 stars is a more honest number .. (so rounded up, 5 it is !)

2837912,4,B000QFAFRC,"I love these stories. Each and everyone a miracle.
...unfortunately the format is unnerving.
I want to stick with it, but since it came from television, the segments are about 6 to 8 minutes. With the removal of commercials, we are  constantly being reminded about what we just saw at the start of the next segment.
Why the heck they do that, I'll never know.
Imagine you're sitting in the living room, watching this show.
After the commercial break, it come back to the story, but first it tells you a brief synopsis of what you just saw moments ago.
yeah, that
I'll be coming back to see the rest of these after I get over my recreational resentment

2837915,5,B000QFAFRC,"First, I am learning so much about the incredible stupidity of some people and how when you combine many bad decisions, it is catastrophic - I mean, who goes hiking in the mountains without water or a phone and then travels off the path?  It's made me really think about some quick decisions made without much thought and how they can be deadly.",1518998400,,345,4.476190476190476
2837916,5,B000QFAFRC,"Love ALL all the ""I Shouldn't Be Alive"" seasons and episodes!!  Some important survival (and avoidance) lessons to learn, but the Number ONE lesson is THIS:  Don't be a FOOL or an IDIOT!!  Some of these people's reckless and careless decisions and choices are utterly astonishing and perplexing as to WHY they would make such choices in the first place.  And some of the weak-minded friends that they manage to pull into their adventurous madness and lunacy are equally disturbing.  Seeing that they are ""saved"" in the end always brings tears to my eyes--not only that they are ""saved"" but also for the brave,  noble and admirable ""heroes"" who so often risk their own safety to SAVE them--thank God for real life heroes!  ALL the episodes are VERY well done--a mix of actors, facts, and real-life survivors' personal accounts.  Wish Amazon Prime would have ALL the seasons and episodes!!",1518652800,,887,4.906040268456376
2837917,1,B000QFAFRC,"I don't know what is happening with the intelligence of people..  I'm going to have to go against the grain on this one.  I think I've heard this narrator before, Eric Meyers, so perhaps it's my personal distaste for him.  But, he seems to use a method which ""dummies down"" the viewer - probably in order to intensify, or capture the audience with shock and awe.  Perhaps the problem is the show's director. For goodness sake, it is a true story; let the story tell it self - or reninact it - with the interjecting of the survivor him/her self.to fill in details.  That would be enough!

I will say that I survived an equally horrific accident, and I would NEVER allow this production crew tell my story.

If you have a large plate of Puruvian Cocaine on the living room table, and are entertaining friends, then his would probably be a perfect show; otherwise, read a book  - or open a can of dog & cat food and feed your animals.  It would be better time spent.  Mike Hall, Austin, TX",1517356800,2,986,4.368131868131868

My very favorite episodes was not included. One of the episodes ""42 Days Adrift""  was one  of the reasons I bought it. It was not there. Neither was others I was expecting.

2837934,3,B000QFAFRC,"I didn't know whether to laugh or hold my breath when I watched disc 1 of this series. I hate stupidity, and that is what this series is about: studpid people getting themselves into stupid situations by thier stupid decisions and blaming someone else. If you like to watch stupid people doing stupid things, then you'll enjoy this show.
Sorry, but I can't watch stupid people. these shows are a perfect example of natural selection. When your number is up, your number is up. The shows are well made with actors portraying the victims. Watch people at their worst. In disc 1 you can watch three adventure seeking young men follow a macho guide to an adventure only two of them return from.in the Amazon. I won't say anymore in case you want to see it. I don't want to spoil it for you.",1345852800,2,786,4.465277777777778
2837935,5,B000QFAFRC,"I stumbled upon this set of 4 DVDs in the local library 2 weeks ago. I had never heard of this show before. I wished I had known it earlier. It tells the stories of people who cheated death. It's full of suspense and terror. And best of all, they are all true stories.

What puzzles me is more than fifty percent of the time, these people asked for danger by themselves! It did not come to them because of freak accidents or the nature of their profession. For example, in the episode called ``Trapped under a bolder``, a seasoned hiker, at night, tried to climb the rocks!

There are 5 episodes in disc 2. They are listed below
1. ""Jaws of Death"" depicted a plane crash in Africa's wilderness.
2. ""Trapped under a boulder"" happened in Hinchinbrook Island, Australia.
3. ""Shipwrecked"" happened in Baja California, Mexico.
4. ""Alaska Avalanche"" happened to 2 experienced hikers when they tried to take the path that nobody else had tried before.
5. ""Ice Cave Survivor"" happened in Northern Turkey.

In short, this disc is suspenseful and terrifying. It's more entertaining than most of the movies I've watched in the last 2 years. I highly recommend it to everybody who loves suspense, terror and reality.",1328227200,8,1204,4.696682464454977
2837936,5,B000QFAFRC,"Having just discovered the show in the fall of 2010, I could not wait to get the DVD from the back episodes and it does not disappoint! Our whole family watches it together and it really gives you an appreciation of life when you see how close some came to losing theirs and some do. It it also educational in that it explains what is happening inside the body during frostbite, dehydration, gangrene and a host of other things the victims endure on the re-creations. I found one episode especially educational when you see what can happen when one drinks salt water in large amounts. Not pretty! We have learned a lot from this show.",1292976000,,634,4.521739130434782
2837937,5,B000QFAFRC,"I absolutely love true stories of human trials and adventure. This series is excellent for telling courageous tales of human survival. The well-acted dramatizations seem to depict each multi-dimensional story as remembered by all people involved, smartly portraying the ignorant confidence, desperation, isolation and humanity of which people are capable in these situations. The added human physiology blurbs are a nice touch to explain what exactly is happening in the human body when it goes into survival mode when confronted with severe hunger and dehydration, sepsis, hypothermia, or any other enemy of survival. If you enjoy stories about real people surviving some of the most incredible experiences, then this is definitely one series worth adding to your collection!",1286841600,2,776,5.584745762711864

2837939,5,B000QFAFRC,"I only watched it once a few weeks ago on cable,but it was enough to convince me to buy the whole series,which i ordered today.

Some shows just grab your attention,like this one.

A lot of people have mentioned what it's about so i won't go on to much about that.

Basically if you want real interviews and mixed with amazing real stories and dramatic reconstructions,all put together very professionally,
then i'd get this.

2837946,5,B000QFAFRC,"I love this collection of episodes. It contains 20 episodes (4 discs)of the Discovery Channel show ""I Shouldn't Be Alive"". Each episode details an event where people, sometimes through poor decision making, sometimes through just bad luck, end up in a life threatening situation. Then the story is told of what the people did to either survive or in some cases die. It really makes you think what you would do in their situations, as well as teaching you some handy survival tips. They tell the story through interviews with the actual survivors and dramatic reenactments (done very well with professional actors). Ever want to know what to do (or not do) if you are stuck on a life raft with no provisions, or how to talk your way out of a hostage situation? Live and learn from the people who have been there.",1207699200,13,811,4.638888888888889

8196095,4,B000QFAFRC,"Interesting collection of survivors who find themselves in extreme situations. Much more engaging than ""I Survived"" which has a similar theme - only I prefer this series as the other one focuses mainly on victims of assault, rape & murder attempts and is done only with interviews of the survivors occasionally cut with scenic shots with text and music - whereas this series employs recreations (mostly well done) and dramatic narration. Also this series focuses on one story, going into greater detail instead of juggling 3 different stories. To see how much more dramatic this series in comparison watch first episode of season 3 then see ep. 8 of 2nd season of ""I Survived"" and you'll see how much more interesting the way the story is told here as its the same story by the same person (woman gets injured in the canyon with her dog).

8196097,4,B000QFAFRC,"True stories with long episodes.....They are about people seeking a big adventure, somwhere out in the Wildness. And it also shows us how a persons luck can change so quickly too. Many of the stories are interesting, a few just a little slow. All these events took place on Mountains, down Canyons, in the Jungle, and on the Seas. After watching  ""I Shouldn't Be Alive""  I really needed to know why people would wish to place themselves in such Dangerous situations. Risking Life and Limbs, experinceing everything that the elements can throw at them. THIRST, HUNGER, EXHAUSTION, COLDNESS, ect.

Somehow, someway, somewhere I had seen these before and the narrator's words got hidden away on dusty neurons. It was a trip hearing his/their words come back to life in my mind. Definitely worth tuning into if you love the outdoors and you will learn a lot about safety, and what to bring with you. The rafter should have had a pack with the bare essentials and safety gear in case he got tossed overboard. And his actor had NO helmet which to me sounds crazy. I recently went on the roof of my home to clear the gutters and I wore a cheap bike helmet. Maintaining consciousness is key. I also used a chest harness alone at times, which I learn from ""Killer Crevasse"" is a big no no!",1522800000,,793,4.364864864864865
