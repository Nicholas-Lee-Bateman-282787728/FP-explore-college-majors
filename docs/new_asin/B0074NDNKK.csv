5055107,3,B0074NDNKK,It took me awhile to remember but I saw a documentary about this years ago.  it was either on Cold Case Files or American Justice on A & E.  This is actually a pretty good movie.  The only sad part about it is that it's true.  These events did happen.,1341100800,,251,3.96
5055108,1,B0074NDNKK,"Poorly made and poorly acted movie with a terrible script. I could go on and on but will not. This movie was made available for an inexpensive price but was still a rip-off. If it was free it would have merely been a waste of time but Amazon charged real money for a faux movie.
I cannot and will not recommend this movie to anyone. Just open your windows and listen to your neighbors argue. Cheaper and at least as entertaining....and free.",1341100800,,441,4.390243902439025

5055110,4,B0074NDNKK,"I have to say I was a bit skeptical about watching after reading the mixed reviews on the acting- The acting was not so bad actually-
Being that it was based upon a true story- It was pretty intense and I would recommend watching at a reduced rental fee.  I think I paid 2.99 and I was satisfied with that price and the movie quality- I would not pay more than that- but worth 2.99.",1338508800,3,382,4.093333333333334
5055111,4,B0074NDNKK,"Reviewed by Amanda Jane Volovik ""Chava"": This is somewhat based on the case of Theresa Knorr and the outrageous sadistic abuse of her children in Sacramento, Ca in the eighties. The real story is worse than the movie. Some fellow reviewers mentioned this movie has bad acting...most crazy religious zealots (Mother and the Cowboy Prophet) act like bad actors in real life, so maybe it was good acting! The children's acting was solid. It is worth a watch, but if child abuse bothers you, or torture, I wouldn't watch it.

Bondage is more powerful in a psychological sense for children, and we wonder why they don't try harder to fight it. **(possible spoiler): The ones who do fight get the worst abuse, as we see here.",1338163200,3,719,4.7063492063492065

5055113,4,B0074NDNKK,wow...where do i begin....i thought this movie was done very well - minus some so so acting - however the actress who played the mother was great......it is a disturbing portrayl of true events (they say ) - if u have any kind of a weak stomach when it comes to watching child abuse then u may have a hard time with this movie......from the beginning with the scene with the husband to the end it will keep u mesmerized in an sickening way......to think that this happened is extremely  bothersome to me....its a very impactful movie...it will stay with u well after u watch it.......and it definitely does not give religion a good name & it doesnt  do justice to preachers either.........this movie goes to show how deranged the abuse cycle can be & how happy endings are for hollywood............,1337990400,5,798,4.652482269503546
5055114,1,B0074NDNKK,"Ridiculously badly acted, especially by the lead actress playing the role of the mother. The movie amounts to nothing more than incompetent actors screaming and ranting.

5055115,4,B0074NDNKK,"WOW!!!  I don't think that I've watched a film that has such a high level of tension thru out, I'm actually exhausted!  Knowing that this is based on the true story of Theresa Knorr is unsettling to say the least.  The thought that this could actually happen in our society is pretty hard to swallow, but Theresa Knorr is in prison for two life sentences for what she did to her children and this film seems to show you what it must have been like to live in that house. I think a few words to describe this film are dark, intense, twisted and probably the best is disturbing.  I think that this is the new age of horror, something that pulls you in and wears you out emotionally and physically. One thing is certain, this film will stay with you for a while. Definitely worth watching.",1333152000,18,786,4.326530612244898
5055116,4,B0074NDNKK,"THE AFFLICTED, A Mother's Love Has It's Limits

Starring : Leslie Easterbrook and Kane Hodder.

Pretty amazing film about a dysfunctional family to an extreme of violent proportions.

The mother,Leslie Easterbrook, Is cruelly perfect in this role : Shades of `Mommy Dearest & Jason's mom from Friday The 13th'.

Kane Hodder has a wild role as the HELPLESS ? father/husband who is catalyst to plot.

This film has such intense scary moments, It could be Brain Damage biggest release to date.

I had seen the last daughter on a talk show. She did live but later on in life died from a heart attack most likely caused from her rotten childhood. I believe she had married and had children of her own. I highly doubt she treated them that way! I tell I'd love the chance to tell Theresa Knorr what I think of her!!!

5055159,3,B0074NDNKK,"First, I must say that Leslie Easterbrook acted her butt off! The ladies that played her daughters were also very convincing. Most of the other actors were awful.

This movie really frustrated me because I just couldn't understand why none of the children ran away, or why they didn't jump her. They all appeared to be older teenagers. It seemed that they had lived a fairly normal life up until that point, so it's not like they were trained to think this was acceptable behavior. How could they all sit by and watch/participate in the death of their siblings? I could not sleep because I was so disturbed and angry after watching this movie.

Anyway, I was shocked to find that this movie is loosely based on the true story of Theresa Knorr. It's definitely not on my top ten list, but it is a movie I will never forget!

If you're looking for something in that vein, this ain't it.

Not a whole lot happens except mom rants and raves. She fashions a wooden paddle, something she calls the Board Of Discipline, and uses it on her teen girls - and they let her. Huh? (Yes, I'm repeating myself.) Okay, there is a older brother, a kind of enforcer, but he's outnumbered, easily. And the girls allow themselves to be molested. Another huh?

Bottom line is we get nothing from this movie. Nothing about the mom, who is just a caricature of a nut job. Nothing about the girls that submit to her. Hell, there isn't even any gratuitous t&a.

5055169,4,B0074NDNKK,"I think I know the details of this case fairly well, from watching true crime shows on tv, so I know enough to say ALL the events in this movie don't happen the way they do in the true story. The details of the child abuse are true enough though... to the best of my knowledge.

This movie kind of sucked me in. I've seen ""The Girl Next Door"" and ""An American Crime"" and this film is definitely along those lines. The film isn't as tight and structured as it could have been but is effective none the less.

We're told the story through the journal of one of the abused children, the youngest one I believe. This approach to the narrative is standard enough until we sadly see her turn from an innocent witness of the abuse to an unwilling participant. That hurt! It tells about how one family is sucked into a sea of despair, pain and hopelessness as the matriarch slowly loses her mind. In between her binge drinking and spewing hate about her husband she finds time to distort the Bible's messages into a sadistic excuse to lay waste to her offspring in all ways possible. Her hypocrisy regarding her children is unimaginable. She prostitutes her oldest daughters out (to what has to be the most realistically portrayed pervert ever) and turns her only son into a sort of mindless enforcer all the while ranting that children should always obey their parents no matter what. She does such a good job in fact that she actually makes one daughter believe God is evil, her god at least. We learn the mother was also a victim of child sexual abuse herself, but this story almost makes me wish she killed herself and saved her family from the hell they would go through.

On another note, the Cowboy Prophet who seems to be in cahoots with mother is a very interesting character indeed. By the end, when his eyes are finally opened and he realizes the damage his ignorance has caused, it makes for a tension-filled climax of nihilistic proportions. I must say the writers did a good job with his complex character.

Also, slasher horror fans keep an eye out for Kane Hodder, everyone's favorite Jason Voorhees! He gets top billing in this film though he only appears at the beginning of the movie. I'm also glad the filmmakers decided to use the Bible verse from Revelation about an end to pain and suffering at the beginning of the film, to contradict what mother would preach about endlessly thoughout the duration. If you can stomach watching some of the most horrendous child abuse in history, and walk away from it a wiser person, I suggest this movie to you.",1347580800,8,2562,4.538961038961039

The plot is very simple. I also thought the actresses, who played her daughters also did an outstanding job. This movie is not for everyone but for some, worth a look.",1344211200,,333,4.758620689655173
5055175,5,B0074NDNKK,this movie was very good. if you like these kinds of flicks then you will really enjoy it. It is LOOSELY based on a true story. I really enjoyed the acting of the mother. she really did look/act like a crazy freak.,1343347200,,214,4.119047619047619
5055176,1,B0074NDNKK,"I rented this film via instant view which unlike many films here that are 1 day or 2 day rentals, this was a 7 day rental. I tried to play this movie on my media players and it simply would not load. The first night I attempted to play it at least 15 times and finally gave up. Same for the next 4 nights. Several attempts and it failed to load. Period. I painstakingly searched to and fro through amazon and my own profile here and couldn't find anywhere to report the issue. I find that very dissapointing to say the least. If such an option exists I can't find it. I know it couldn't possibly be my media player that caused the film to fail to load because I have two players vastly different players in two different rooms and the film will not play on either. Also I have rented roughly about 50 films through instant view and I never had this issue here. I did experience this same issue on netflix a few times, but the problem was reported by numerous fellow members just as I am doing here as a review, so again it couldn't have been on my end. I joined amazon instant view because I was getting very tired of netflix and their refusal to fix streaming issues. One film remained unplayable there for nearly 6 months. Despite customer complaints filed through reviews, phone calls, email complaints, etc. the problem was never fixed. At least there you have several options made available to complain but I do not see that option here anywhere. If it exists I can't find it. So just a warning , if you plan to rent this instant view and use a media player it may not load and you'll lose your money.",1343001600,,1606,4.303630363036303

8510167,1,B0074NDNKK,"The lighting, filming, set and acting are VERY VERY VERY BAD. The movie looks like it was made in a basement and the actors were pulled off the street.  I would suggest reading the real story if you are interested in what happened, but definitely skip this movie since others are saying that it did not follow the true story or chain of events.",1511481600,,344,4.375
8510168,2,B0074NDNKK,"Very tragic story, depressing and disturbing. But unfortunately this movie was awful. Bad acting all the way around. It was a
waste of time.",1510704000,,140,4.875
8510169,3,B0074NDNKK,Not bad of a movie. The mother was crazy and the acting could have been better. Sad ending.,1510444800,,91,4.111111111111111
8510170,3,B0074NDNKK,"I love Easterbrook. I think she's a very underated actor who doesn't get the credit I think she deserves for her acting chops.

I know this film is loosely based on the abusive dirtbag narcopath Theresa Knorr but my problem with the acting is that Easterbrook plays the character & it makes Knorr seem psychotic & out of touch with reality. They also deviated far away from the true story which I'll never understand because the TRUTH is horrific enough. No need to change a thing!

Make no mistake about it, Theresa Knorr was and is sane. She has all her mental faculties. She wasn't/isnt psychotic, she's a psychopath. So the portrayal of her flipping to the other side of her mind sort of gives the impression that she was out of touch with reality which diminishes her accountability for her cruelties & crimes.

Knorr knew what she was doing was wrong when she did it, but she enjoyed it so much.

Thats my main grievance of the film. I still would recommended watching it tho. Its a higher grade B-film & thats what it was meant to be. Give it a watch.

RIP the Knorr sisters, Suesan, Sheila and Terri.",1510358400,,1108,4.492537313432836
8510171,2,B0074NDNKK,"I get that this movie is based on a true story, but the plot of the movie was sloppy as all get out.  I don't want to give away too much of the story but the way the abuse rolled out, no sane teenager would stick around and I am not entirely clear on the when this story was suppose to take place but IMO none of the events that transpired would not fly in these current times. In one part of the movie, the preacher was able to cross the crime scene and not one office tried to detain him or arrest him.  Instead they let him stick around and contaminate the crime scene.  I mean who does that?  Thank goodness I technically didn't pay for it, but it was a waste of my time.  If you wanna fall asleep, just rent it from your local library, unless they had the good sense not to spend their money on this garbage.",1510185600,,813,3.993827160493827
8510172,4,B0074NDNKK,OMG... This story is so sad and frightening. The mother was so vile her actions literally made me vomit in my mouth. There are no words to describe this kind of madness. This is worth watching but prepare to be very alarmed by what you will see. I could hardly even finish it.  Every character in this was film was so twisted and demented. I just cannot even fathom growing up in an environment this dysfunctional. This movie is based on a true story concerning the antics of Theresa Knorr. Special emphasis on the word based because this movie is different from the real case but the actual story is just as horrific as this movie.,1509580800,,632,4.448275862068965
8510173,5,B0074NDNKK,"I think i cried all the way through it! Oh my lord what this woman does to this family is so bizarre!
Those poor kids! The story was good, wished they embellished on a few things maybe make it longer go further into details. But it is a well produced story about a horrible pyscho woman and how she abuses her children, some to death.
Grab a box of tissues you may just cry!!",1509321600,,375,4.081081081081081
8510174,3,B0074NDNKK,"As mentioned in a previous review, this is based on a true story but is not accurate.  There were two brothers who helped the mother ""punish"" the two sisters.  The girl does not kill herself or brother or mother at the end.  The mother is in prison and is eligible for parole in 2027!  Hard to believe.  I really didn't think the acting was that great and the changes made to the story made it a lot less believable.  I think it would have been much better had the writers stuck to the real storyline.  The true story is shocking all by itself!  Also, the lighting was crappy.  Much of the movie is filmed in the night and they really needed to do something better to illuminate scenes.",1505692800,,686,4.296875
