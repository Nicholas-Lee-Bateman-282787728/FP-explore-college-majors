8151911,4,B000JLPMR6,"Great vid.  Just seeing how powerful the hands can be is a great eye open'er.  Tons of great excercises and tips.
I played along with the video as much as possible.  Found some of the sheet music to the solos online and am trying to play them like Jeff.  Tons of content, and good excercises and breakdowns.
Immediately after practicing the vid I realized just how weak my left hand was and over a week it has already gotten way stronger.

--edit just downgraded to four stars.  Yeah its cool, but gotta leave some room for the truly fantastic products like Great hands....",1314144000,2,573,4.514563106796117
8151912,5,B000JLPMR6,"You don't have to be interested in drum corps to benefit from this video.  I've never met a drummer that didn't want better hands.  Probably best for intermediate to advanced players-- I'd suggest you at least have a handle on the basic rudiments, like paradiddle variations and flam accents, first.  If you are a high school line player, buy this video RIGHT NOW!  You'll have lots of fun amazing your friends with your new skills.

What I like most about this video is that there is a LOT of CONTENT.  Most drummers teach you 4 or 5 things and call it a video.  Jeff really does a lot of teaching here, and he does it well.  He also does not wax poetic about his drumming philosophy.  This is straight-up woodshed material.  His playing is authoritative, to say the least.  Video production is also first-rate.",1214956800,8,812,4.569444444444445
8151913,5,B000JLPMR6,I've got several instructional drum DVDs.  This one is just for the hands -- which ofcourse are crucial to drumming.  Jeff starts with very basic things and gets to very advanced work.  The amazing part is that you can master these rudiments and drills on one drum but then just split up your hands on a drum set and you have a masterful drum solo.  Very good.,1192665600,6,360,4.3283582089552235
