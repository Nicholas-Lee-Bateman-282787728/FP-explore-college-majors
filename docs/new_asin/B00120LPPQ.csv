8243398,3,B00120LPPQ,"Not sure when it was made official on amazon, but, The WWE: Sting DVD has officially been shelved.  Too Bad, I was really getting optomistic last week when I noticed it still was open for pre=orders on Amazon. But, I logged in today and noticed it's discontinued.",1228521600,,263,4.595744680851064
8243399,1,B00120LPPQ,"Bad news according to numerous updates, the Randy Savage and Sting DVDS have been postponed due to the status with Randy Savage and Sting Signing on with TNA through 2009. So I would be really shocked if these DVDS end up comming out in December. so it is indeed a sad day. I only wish TNA and WWE would recognize that Sting is indeed a legend and they should put thier diferances aside and make him a dvd ALREADY!!!!",1224028800,,417,4.291139240506329
8243400,4,B00120LPPQ,"When Sting retires and leaves TNA this dvd probably will come out. Since it was set to just be $26 though it probably wouldn't have been good as it could be. I mean how are dvds with just like 8 matches worthy dvds to guys like Sting, Flair and Curt Hennig ? It's pathetic that they act like those dvds are the legacies of the wrestlers. Sure they have biographies and comments from wrestlers but I buy the dvds for the matches. Anyway if this dvd ever happens I'd like to see these matches.:

  Matches in his Blade Runner tag team in his early career. Vs Mike Rotundo (TV title), feud with The Great Muta, vs Flair at Clash of the Champions, vs Flair at Starcade 89 in a tournament finals match, vs Flair at the Great American Bash, vs Vader in a King of Cable match, with the Great Muta vs The Steiners in Japan, vs Stunning Steve Austin (U.S title tournament finals, vs Arn Anderson, vs Rick Rude, vs Cactus Jack (Pin Falls Count Anywhere), vs Lord Steven Regal at a ppv in a great match, vs Flair at Uncensored, vs Kensuke Sasaki at Starcade 1995, vs Hogan on Nitro in an earlier match when they are faces, with Booker T. vs the Road Warriors in a street fight, vs Hollywood Hogan at SuperBrawl VIII, vs DDP on Nitro (WCW title), vs Scott Hall at Uncensored (WCW title), in the NWO Wolf Pack vs The Giant (Winner gets tag team titles), vs Flair to be commissioner of WCW on Nitro, vs Hogan at Fall Brawl (WCW title), vs Bret Hart on Nitro (WCW title), vs Booker T in a tournament, vs Vampiro, vs Flair on the last Nitro",1220400000,2,1524,4.248275862068965
8243401,1,B00120LPPQ,"I agree that something that was cancelled or is not going to be released by the WWE should be advertised as a pre-order! Just because Vince Mcmahon owns the rights to WCW and other former wrestling companies,doesn't give him the right to release a DVD of a superstar that has never worked for World Wrestling Entertainment! That's my opinion!",1211500800,,342,4.813559322033898
8243402,1,B00120LPPQ,"I don't know why this is still up for pre-order, Vince McMahon has already shut down producions on it, mainy because Sting is still under contract with TNA.",1207094400,,156,4.607142857142857
8243403,3,B00120LPPQ,"Ive always liked Sting. Hell, I own alot of WWE dvds just so I can have his match as an extra. He was colorful and rarely put on a bad match. Until he turned to black and white, then his matches took a tumble. I own his TNA dvd and its good but nowhere as good as his early 90's matches in WCW. I wish Vince would release this dvd anyways, he might be sued but you know how much money this money will make for him?

Side note: WWE is planning on releasing Best of Starcade on dvd. Dont know why but hopefully it'll become a regular thing with WCW events like Best of Slamboree, Best of Halloween Havoc, etc. You can probably get a Sting match on Best Of Starcade. He should at least have 2 or 3.",1204761600,,695,3.9642857142857144
8243404,1,B00120LPPQ,"Cancelled because Sting never worked for the WWE, and is currently working for TNA, WWE's competition.  Any attention made to Sting (outside of WWE 24/7) only helps TNA, and WWE refuses to acknowledge TNA's existence on the air.",1200700800,6,228,5.0
8243405,5,B00120LPPQ,"According to The Wrestling Observer, Vince McMahon has canceled this DVD. Sting has resigned for another year with TNA, so if this DVD is getting released, it probably won't be until some time in 2009.",1200268800,9,201,4.771428571428571
