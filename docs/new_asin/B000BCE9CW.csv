Only problem is - where can I find more?  I know this show ran in New Zealand for 5 years and that way more episodes exist.  Please make the whole series available!",1366502400,,220,4.45
8085070,5,B000BCE9CW,"I first encounted this DVD back in the 90's for my first grandchild, now have just gotten it for my fourth grandchild. Children love this DVD containing short story's played out by children. Wonderful in every sense.",1358294400,,216,4.864864864864865
8085071,5,B000BCE9CW,"This is a video for children - boys and girls from age 2 up to..... It's made in New Zeeland and has only children dressing up as different characters in the 10 different chapters. There is no talking only singing by fe/male singers. It starts with child/ren coming into a room finding a dress up box, opens it up and puts a piece of clothing on over their regular clothes. As the first item goes on, will the viewer suddenly be transported into this imaginary world, that can either be on a beach with pirates, in the bushes with spiders and butterflies, a meeting with zoombies, frankenstein and dracula, or even into the computer. The face painting on the children is fabulous. My daughter who is now 3,5 years old, has been getting it from the library since she was about 2 years old. Now is she able to watch it at home. The smile on her face shen she opened Santas gift was unbeatable.dre",1293321600,,894,4.424242424242424
8085072,5,B000BCE9CW,"If you have to put your child in front of the ""stupid box"", make sure this is the DVD playing. It is beautifully done (stunning visuals, good songs) and it actually inspires imaginative play in children.",1184803200,,203,4.666666666666667
8085073,3,B000BCE9CW,"I can't figure out which of the magical, wondrous skits I like most:

""Fossilized"", where two little kiwi birds are shocked when a collection of fossils springs to life and sings (in a forlorn, maudline little ditty) how they became fossils; ""The Messy Fairies"", where a group of elfin sprites are reprimanded for being careless about the garden's general upkeep; ""The Sly Fox"", where a hungry fox dresses up as a sheep and fronts her bloodthirsty search for lambs by pretending to run a laundry; or ""The Computer Geek"", where a drab, stick-in-the mud little girl is forced to learn how to have ""fun"" when her even younger brother pushes her into the C-drive of a PCU (dude, what the devil is THAT about?)

I think the greedy fox and the hapless girl in the computer are the BEST!

Honestly, I've watched this New Zealand-made DVD with my young relatives more than once, and, if nothing else, the creative tunes and lyrics that accompany each brief skit make for an excellent earworm one cannot eradicate from playing on the loop of the inner mind.

Think ""It's A Small World After All"".

Enjoy!",1173484800,,1095,4.682291666666667
8085074,4,B000BCE9CW,"My 3 year old daughter found this dvd at the library.

We'll have to return it soon, after renewing as many times as we are allowed. She has watched it hundreds of times, sometimes asking for it twice or more a day.

The costumes are very well done and the actors (children) are wonderful. The songs are catchy, tho sometimes it's hard to understand the words (but I'm catching on after hearing it so many times).

I'd recommend this for your toddler or preschooler. It's not too girly, so the boys will like it too.

Each segment is just 5 minutes, and you can choose to play them all or just one at a time.",1166572800,,608,4.260869565217392
