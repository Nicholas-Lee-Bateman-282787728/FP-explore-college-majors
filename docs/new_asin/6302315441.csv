451878,4,6302315441,"Well, if you aren't familiar with H.P. Lovecraft, this story may seem a bit odd. It was, in fact, based on ""The Colour from Outer Space"", which was a fine Lovecraft story concerning interstellar visitation by a creature unlike anything that exists on Earth. The movie, while rather low-budget, is nonetheless an interesting interpretation of the story, with plenty of slime, bugs, goo, glop and gore to satisfy seekers of horror. This is actually a better example of low budget horror in my opinion, and has genuinely disturbing moments, along with a few of the sillier ones you'd expect from a movie of this budget level....Still, if you know any rabid Star Trek: The Next Generation fans who have the hots for Wil Wheaton, this is one of his better cinematic offerings, in my opinion.

451913,4,6302315441,"My review for CURSE II: THE BITE:

This Italian-made, lensed in the USA production has a lot of good things going for it in the first 45 minutes. Then it turns into a run-of-the-mill horror film with an incredible premise. On the cross-country trip, Clark (J. Eddie Peck) and Lisa (Jill Schoelen) run over a bunch of snakes in the middle of the road. When Clark goes out to investigate, he is bitten by a snake and they stop at a gas station to get their vehicle fixed by a stubborn gas station attendant (Al Fann), who keeps a mutated dog chained up in an old shack. Seems the area has been the subject of radiation tests and the animals (mainly the snakes) have mutated and are extremely poisonous. Clark gets an anti-venom shot by traveling salesman (and part-time doctor) Harry Morton (Jamie Farr, who plays his role with a Jewish accent!), thinking that Clark was bitten by a normal poisonous snake known to the area. After a closer study, Harry realizes that Clark was bitten by a mutated snake and spends the rest of the film trying to locate Clark so he can give him the right inoculation (and not be sued for malpractice!). Clark and Lisa run into a local sheriff (played by Bo Svenson in his usual overwrought style), and thinking that Clark is high on drugs, arrests them both and sends Clark to the hospital for detoxification. Clark's behavior begins to change and the trip to the hospital to treat his hand turns rather nasty. It seems his hand is turning into a snake (!) and the snake-hand kills a nurse before Clark escapes after Harry faints before he is able to administer the shot. The finale shows Clark turning into a giant mutated snake who is about to devour Lisa in a muddy pit before Harry blows off it's head with a shotgun. Director Fred Goodwin (actually Italian director Federico Prosperi [writer of his brother's Franco's crazy film WILD BEASTS - 1983]) uses the New Mexico desert locations in the beginning of the film to good effect as snakes are run over in slow motion (a very good scene) and the locale does imbue an eerie hue on the film. Unfortunately, once Svenson appears on the scene and the location shifts to a city, the film suffers a lack of focus. The film resembles SSSSSSS (1973) to a certain extent, but is much more graphic. Released in both R-Rated and Unrated editions. The differences are Fann's attack (and death) by his mutant dog is more graphic and Clark's transformation at the end is more elaborate along with the hospital attack and other bits of gore in the Unrated edition. This film is good for a little fun, but only the Unrated edition. The R-Rated edition cuts away just as it is about to become juicy. A Trans World Entertainment VHS Release. Available on an Unrated double feature DVD (with the original THE CURSE [1987]) from MGM Home Video. Be aware that while the sequel on the DVD is in fullscreen, it is the uncut version. The original CURSE is in widescreen on the DVD and contains scenes not seen in the theatrical version or the ones released on VHS. Don't be fooled by the R-Rating on the DVD's packaging. There is some juicy, gooey stuff on screen. You should also be aware that none of the films in the CURSE franchise are related to each other.",1430265600,,3224,4.549053356282272

I saw this movie as a child and seeing it again after all these years, I am quite surprised at how frightful it was despite being an obvious low budget movie with rather poor acting.  Despite the obvious, you get sucked into the movie and it with this that I give it a high satisfactory rating and will love to watch it again.

451920,3,6302315441,"As it turns out, I was actually looking for a different movie when I ran across this one and mistook it for the one that I was after. Unsure if it was the right one, I really tried to find this with ""The Curse"" alone on disc, but I guess it's only available as a ""double feature."" Unfortunately, what the marketers of these ""double features"" are making us buy is one average movie and one bomb. I guess they figure, ""Why not milk it for all it's worth."" The Curse was actually an average older movie about a meteor that infects the water, and eventually the people, of a small rural community, while Curse 2 is really a boring waste of time about a guy who gets his hand bitten by a snake, thus turning his hand into a snake. While the effects of the original are a bit cheesy, they are disgusting enough to at least get a little reaction and frequent enough to keep things interesting, while the effects of the sequal are just hoaky and occur so infrequently that you are really bored through the times in between. I wouldn't pay more than the cost of a single feature for this ""double,"" because you really are only getting one watchable feature. I would really rather pay a little more for a single average feature alone than to have a real stinker attached to the back side of it.",1392076800,,1283,4.327800829875518
451921,5,6302315441,"I haven't gotten around to watching the second one yet, but the first is just as awesomely terrible as I remember it. Definitely a classic that you need for your collection, plus, who can ever get enough Will Wheaton?",1386115200,,217,4.589743589743589
452019,3,6302315441,"Low budget melty mutants get cranky and start killing things.  That's all I needed to hear to know I wanted to see this.  If you feel that's not enough to make an informed decision, then I assure you, this movie is NOT for you.  LOL.

During a storm, young Zack (Wil Wheaton) witnesses a meteorite landing on his stepfather's farm.  This meteor brought with it an other-worldly ooze that gets into the local water supply.  After exposure, the local produce immediately grows to look appetizing, but is filled with what looks like blood, guts, bugs and gook; the chickens become mangy and violently carnivorous; the cows become explosive reservoirs of rotten flesh and pestilence; and Zack's mother slowly becomes a psychopathic, drooling, open sore-covered pulsating mess!

Zack's stepfather is a no-nonsense, ""our God is a vengeful God"" kind of Bible-toting, God-fearing farmer who disciplines his kids with the back of his hand.  He is in denial about everything that's going on around him (even as his wife turns into a warty, stabby monster), thinking that God is punishing them all.  Being the only one to avoid exposure to the water, it's up to Zack to save his kid sister from the strange malady that has struck his family and their land.

Although allegedly an adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Colour out of Space"", I hardly find any Lovecraftian satisfaction in this--although it's still a dumb-fun movie.  Here's something totally random and symptomatic of terrible writing.  At some point a water treatment investigator (John Schneider), who has nothing to do with the recent meteorite sighting, randomly comes to Zack's aid.  The movie would've been fine if that character was completed deleted--no one would even notice.

It is blatantly obvious that this movie had a super-low budget, and with that comes its share of major filmmaking and writing flaws.  For example, the local doctor is somehow also the only scientist investigating the meteorite and its potential dangers.  The general randomness of the scenes in which we see new mutations just substantiates the lack of thought that went into this screenplay.

The gore and make-up work is entertaining.  Whether a blood-gushing head of lettuce or the pulsating forehead of Zack's mom, I was constantly smiling.  As the movie progresses, so do the pus-oozing make-up jobs on Zack's parents and stepbrother...who eventually ""melt"" away.

I think that's why we decided to watch this in the first place, right?  To watch melty mutants kill people.  I certainly didn't expect much from the writing, nor did I care that it sucked.",1378684800,,2596,5.0588235294117645

There's no bonus material included on this duel disc but because these movies are so rare it doesn't matter, it's just great to have them finally released on dvd, so sit back and enjoy!

I'll keep the review short and sweet as I usually do.  'The CURSE' -aka- 'The FARM', is about a huge meteorite falling into a farmer's property, so because of this, everything from cattle/live stock to plants begin to spoil! Also the water system is infected!  What happens when the farmer, his family, and town folk begin to eat and drink off of what this deadly meterorite created!!!???  You'll just have to find out for yourself!

'The Curse 2' -aka- 'The BITE'  is about a man getting bit and his hand starts to mutate, also develops a mind of its own!!!  It kinda reminds me of another forgotten horror flick, titled: 'Severed Ties'.  Yes, this is unlike the first one and so are the rest of the Curse 1+4 series!  It's kinda reminds me of what John Carpenter wanted to do with each 'Halloween' flick, by making a different story but under the same title.  These horror flicks are meant to be enjoyed and not taken seriously.  Both 1 + 2 have great make-up effects in my opinion.",1259798400,,1132,4.46829268292683
452097,4,6302315441,"The Curse is one of those fun, oddball horror flicks that you could catch on HBO at about 5AM back in the good ol' days.  I know because I watched it many times and even taped it on VHS.  I always liked the movie and thought it was creepy as a kid.  I guess a bit of that sticks with me when I watch it today, though it's not a very terrifying movie through adult eyes.
It's based on H.P. Lovecraft's story, The Colour Out Of Space, as was the Boris Karloff flick, Die,Monster, Die!  In the movie, Zachary(Will Wheaton-good, but not making quite the impression he did in Stand By Me) lives on a farm with his religious zealot stepdad, Nathan(Claude Akins doing a great job of making you hate him) and his bonehead son, Cyrus, who likes to torment Zack.  Zack's mother, Frances, and his little sister, Alice, are there as well. Nathan rules the family with a strict religious iron fist.  One night he's refusing his wife's advances, so she does what any horny, sensible woman unfortunate enough to be married to Claude Akins would do, and boinks the handyman.  Also at this time, a meteor crashes on the farm.  It's an odd marvel at first, but it soon melts and seeps into the newly built well.  Now the apples and veggies are growing like crazy, but that's a smokescreen.  Soon the water tastes funny, the apples are packed with worms, the lettuce is full of snotty ooze, and the farm animals are acting violently-full of bugs too!  Zack and his sister seem to be the only ones who know something funny is going on.  Nathan puts it all down to God's will, so he's no help at all, but more or less an accomplice of the curse.  The infected family members start getting nasty warts like the ones Lemmy from Motorhead has, and begin to act crazy.  Frances becomes downright grotesque and savage.  Zack tries to enlist the help of the local doctor and an EPA type guy played by John Schneider(yes, THAT John Schneider), but in the end he's the one who's gonna have to try to save himself and his sister from The Curse.
The movie was directed by actor David Keith(he's the guy who played Drew Barrymore's dad in Firestarter)making his directorial debut.  Lucio Fulci(billed as Louis Fulci) is an associate producer! I'll bet you horror fans wanna see this now, eh?  It's really not too bad of a little horror film, and worth checking out.
Curse 2:The Bite is one of those sequels in name only.  Apparently The Curse must have been fairly successful(though to this day I have yet to meet one other person who has actually seen The Curse.  I did force some of my childhood friends to watch it back when I was hot poop for taping it off HBO at 5AM), so the title was used again to make this film seem like a tie-in with The Curse.  Curse 2 didn't make it to HBO(I don't think), but it certainly appeared at all the local video stores.  It's entertaining in it's own right but just doesn't pack the same kind of punch.  It's one of those road trip type films.  Clark and his girlfriend are out on vacation and drive through a radioactive bomb test area infested with radioactive animals-primarily snakes.  Ol' Clark is bitten and things just get progressively crappy for him from then on.  His bitten arm slowly morphs into an uncontrollable snake head.  Clark and his girlfriend, Lisa(late 80s/early 90s minor league scream queen Jill Schoelen) are pursued by a police sheriff(Bo Svenson!) and a traveling salesman(Jamie Farr!!) trying to avoid a lawsuit by initially giving Clark the wrong snake antidote.  Lots of chasing, hiding, screaming, bandage oozing and snake biting. Even an eyeball sliding down a windshield!  There's a bit more gore in Curse 2 than the first film, but the gore isn't really a substitute for story, and The Curse had the more messed up story.  Curse 2 isn't too bad and a harmless way to turn your Saturday into a ""Curse"" night.
Bare bones DVDs, no trailers or anything.  That's pretty much expected though with these obscure flicks that don't really even qualify as Cult films.  I could have certainly done without this new lousy cover art(which seems to happen to almost every DVD release of a cool movie that had cool cover art), as The Curse had a pretty snazzy cover showing Wheaton's face next to the farm house held in the palm of a giant, yucky hand emerging from the ground.  Oh, well, at least I can replace that old VHS tape finally.",1256774400,,4364,4.533844189016603
452098,4,6302315441,"This double feature was a treat to find. The original feature (The Curse) was directed by a popular actor which was interesting, but the story was really good.

They all live on Nathan's farm in Tennessee. One night, Zack's frustrated mum decides to sneak out of bed and sleep with the burly farmhand. You can hardly blame her, as hubby is a stone-cold dud in the sack, unwilling to respond to her advances. Anyway, that same night, a meteor crashes onto the farm with a tremendous explosion. This thing is no ordinary space rock! It's cold, and it pulsates eerily! Soon, it melts, seeping horrendous goo into the ground like a river! This in turn pollutes the water table, causing the well to be infected with interstellar slime! Yep, you guessed it, everyone drinks this vile liquid, and all the farm's crops are watered with it! The livestock start getting weird. There's even a mad chicken attack! Mum is the first human to act strange. The rest of the family joins her in short order. Zack and his sister, Alice (Amy Wheaton) avoid the putrid food and water, only to be surrounded by their mutated, homicidal, orally oozing relatives! THE CURSE is a lesser known 80s classic, sort of the grand-child of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, and the grand-dad of movies like SLITHER. CURSE 2: THE BITE is not so much a sequel as it is a goofy spin-off. The story is completely unrelated to the original. This go round we get a guy named Clark and his girlfriend traveling through a government testing site in Arizona. Of course, radiation has caused desert animals (rattlesnakes this time) to mutate into vicious killers! Not only that, but the venom of these creatures causes further mutations in their prey! Clark is bitten and begins changing in bizarre ways. He becomes a crazed maniac with a unique method of killing anyone he comes in contact with. C2 is a gore-drenched semi-masterpiece of insanity! We also get Jamie Farr (!!) as a salesman turned gun-toting hero; and Bo Svenson (Snow Beast) as the sheriff!

452102,4,6302315441,"I purchased these, having seen them when they first came out, Curse I in
theaters and Curse II on VHS.  The first, starring Wil Wheaton shortly
after his role in ""Stand By Me"", was a tense, scary, horror film with
an interesting plot about the water turning people into reptilian like
crazies very gradually, though the ending was a bit hokey.  The title
refers to the boys father (Claude Akins) thinking that the changes in his wife (she's
the main victim of the tainted water)is a curse from God for her sexual
straying that he discovered.  Curse 2 is about a couple who are traveling
near White Sands where A-Bomb tests occurred and the man is bitten by a
snake, one of about a thousand lying all over the road.  He begins to
change, his arm becoming snake like over a few hours or days, which is
the only similarity to Curse 1.  The movie starts out pretty well, but
becomes rather tedious, with another disappointing ending, not that I
knew how to make it better.  Overall, these two movies should hold your
interest if you are a thriller or horror fan, but neither will be classics.  Curse 1 is definitely the better of the two. Curse 2 is called ""The Bite"".",1199318400,2,1164,4.462264150943396
452103,4,6302315441,"In ""The Curse"", a young farmboy named Zack (Wil Wheaton) has a dysfunctional family run by his bible-thumping stepdad (Claude Akins) until one night, a meteorite crash lands near the farm. It unleashes a slimey goo carrying alien parasites that suddenly contaminates the area's water supply and makes the crops look all huge and delicious but actually disgusting on the inside, the animals turn bad even if they rot and turns some of the farm owners into zombie-like mutants as now Zack must try to escape. In ""Curse 2"" which is not related to the first movie, A happy couple (J.Edie Peck and Jill Schoelen) traveling the southwestern part of America near a nuclear testing range that has contaminated the snakes around the area. Clark gets bitten on the hand by a deadly radioactive snake and soon his hand starts changing and he starts to become a mutated killer.

The first one is a highly entertaining and gooey Sci-fi horror shocker inspired by an H.P. Lovecraft story with some decent special effects, disgusting moments like the apple sequence you won't forget, and a couple of good performances by Wil Wheaton and Claude Akins. Sure some of the acting could be better on the other performers and the story a bit more coherent but this is a fun and disgusting movie that was co-produced by Lucio Fulci and is worth watching even for that suprising ending. ""The Curse II"" is a completely unreleated story but still enjoyable and gory at times with fine special effects by Steve Johnson, it's quite a ""Fly""-esque story of mutation and is filmed in my beloved state of New Mexico in Las Crusas.

The DVD on both features have no extras but good widescreen quality picture on the first movie and the second movie has decent picture with full frame.

J.Eddie Peck  was so phenomenal bringing his character on the silver screen. Not to mention a steamy and shocking scene! I never watch any kind of movie showing snake come out from the chopped hand. Is that amazing? The effect was excellent for the 80's period and the storyline also smooth and easy to understand. What more I can tell about ""Curse 2 The Bite"".Almost perfect! I love watching ""The Curse"" even though there's no connection with"" The Curse 2"".This movie also quite good and worth watching!",1188777600,7,646,4.81981981981982
452105,5,6302315441,"I have loved this film since I was a little girl when I first recorded it on Beta. Unfortunately, I lost the tape over the years and have only recently been able to obtain a used VHS. After all these years, I was afraid that I would no longer find that I enjoyed this movie. Luckily, I was wrong. I am still horrified and entranced by this magnificent film.

The horror all begins one stormy night when a meteor plummets to earth and lands on the Hayes farm. Disturbed, the local residents try to discover the identity of this mysterious object. As time goes by, strange events begin to transpire. The produce of the Hayes farm becomes worm infested, the animals start to appear diseased and rabid, and members of the Hayes family begin to become grotesque in appearance, as well as loosing their sanity. What has caused these horrific transformations? Will this horrible plague be ended, or has the terror of The Curse only begun?

I found the acting in this classic film to be very well done. The grim atmosphere that pervaded it was utterly encompassing. The characters, especially Frances, did an excellent job of portraying the quiet horror that was enveloping their lives. Also, the story line flowed wonderfully from the introduction of the Hayes family to the ultimate destruction that followed. However, I do have one word of warning, this movie can be very graphic in certain parts. If you are a person (such as I am) who is made ill by such scenes then you may not be able to completely enjoy this movie. Although such graphic effects often make me ill, I found the other qualities of this movie to be so absorbing that I was able to ignore the more disgusting elements.

To conclude, I would highly recommend this film. From its beginning to the conclusion, I was utterly captivated by the chilling atmosphere and the superb acting. This is one of the quintessential horror films of all time and it is certainly worth the trouble of obtaining it on the used market. It is a movie that you will never forget!

7824112,2,6302315441,"I have only seen ""The Curse"" so far, this cinema version of H.P. Lovecraft's story ""The Color Out of Space"" seems to be aimed at a ""white trash"" type of movie viewer, production standards are very low, the overall look and feel of the movie reminds me of the exploitation flicks of the 70's in a bad way.
I must state that I am of the opinion that the actors are not responsible for this lousy film, they just did the best they could with what was provided.
I give this film two stars out of five, and I'm being generous.
I don't feel very optimistic about ""The Curse 2: The Bite"" given the disaster that is ""The Curse"" part one.
On the other hand if you want to watch a decent movie with a Lovecraftian theme I would recommend the film ""The Mist"", although based on a book with the same title written by Stephen King, it does a much better job of exploring the Lovecraft mythos than does ""The Curse"". You can buy it here on Amazon.",1469318400,,932,4.212290502793296
