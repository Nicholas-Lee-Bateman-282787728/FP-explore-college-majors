8200526,5,B000009CE1,"I saw Luther in '72 at Western College for Women in Oxford OH, where he did a benefit for Bangla Desh. I got the impression he didn't know what Bangla Desh really was, but that he couldn't pass up on a gig at a college for women in some dinky town. Anyhow, the show was incredible. I'm not sure I ever saw a performer more connected with his audience. I was thrilled when I came upon this dvd several years ago, and though the song mix had changed his presentation eerily similar to the 72 show. A great blues player in the classic syle. Thank the stars for documenting him before he passed on.",1405209600,2,594,4.219298245614035
8200527,5,B000009CE1,"Blues fans in general and Luther Allison fans in particular will love this CD.  Luther sings with total abandon and conviction.  His guitar playing, James Solberg's guitar playing, the Memphis Horns, and the band as a whole are phenomenal!  I really treasure this album.",1379894400,,270,5.090909090909091
8200528,5,B000009CE1,The only reason I would rate this DVD with 5 stars is because a 10 star rating is not available. It is that good!,1169337600,,113,3.75
8200529,1,B000009CE1,"It's nearly unwatchable due to the very poor quality of sound. It sounds like your in a tunnel and the only instrument you can hear somewhat clearly is the keyboard player. There's not one good tune amoung the bunch. Get Luther's Live in Chicago double CD instead, it's great.",1030320000,4,276,4.653061224489796
8200530,5,B000009CE1,"I was very fortunate to see Luther Allison twice before he passed on. He was an excellant guitarist,probably the most underrated blues singer other than Freddie King and a superb entertainer. When he talked to you whether singing or between songs you really felt like he was talking to you. This show was done in the Indian Ocean and is an exceptional piece of work. What is also so beautiful is that someone actually had the foresight to record this. Luther is just cooking along doing his thing whether it be playing those great Gibson guitars or singing in his soulful blues voice. ""Just as I Am"" and ""There Comes a Time"" are the highlights as they show a little more of the man that Luther had become. Excellant sound for your DVD stereo sytem at home also. No disappointments here!!!!!!!!",994636800,3,793,4.631205673758865
