8267992,3,B0018017X0,I bought this movie because I periodically go through kung-fu stages and was very pleased with the movie. Some of the scenes are a bit contrived but it didn't take away from the movie.,1262908800,2,184,4.4411764705882355
8267993,3,B0018017X0,"I also bought this movie because of the game. The games are great and so in depth.  The movie was not really what i expected. it's very loosely tied to the game. Nishiki and Fuma are barely in the plot. its seems like Kazuma just ""runs"" into trouble, but really has no ties to these characters.

Kazuma and Nishiki don't even look like their characters, nor do they even look Japanese. I DO like that they have little ""funnies"" from the game here and there like the energy drink, which causes him to power up with a blue aura. Also, Yoo Gong is hot, but I really don't remember his role in any of the games.

It's fun to watch if you're into the game, but other's may find the story very choppy. Or maybe none fans will just enjoy the movie for what it is. Although it's not the best movie, i still enjoyed it.",1234483200,4,810,4.17948717948718
