2478729,5,B000E117IO,"The late actor Tommy Noonan did two films in the mid-60's with Jayne Mansfield and Mamie Van Doren respectively. ""Promises Promises"" with Mansfield and this one with Mamie Van Doren. Both resulted in Playboy spreads [...]. ""Three Nuts"" is the better of them in my opinion because Mamie is just more interesting to watch. The plot is really bizarre involving getting psychoanalasys for three with only one patient (Noonan, who's very funny) and the whole thing getting out of hand. Mamie plays a stripper named Saxie Symbol who's one of the ones wanting treatment. She looks fabulous [...] The film is low, low budget and alternates in b&w and color. Yet there's a looney, insane quality to it that makes you wonder what Noonan had in mind at all. And a host of character actors running around...Marjorie Bennett,  one of the plumbers from ""Green Acres"", several others. The print from VCI is quite good for a rare piece like this. Only minor scratches and one little jumpy part. There's some partially nude shots of Mamie ""behind the scenes"" but the best thing is the interview with Van Doren herself. She's delightful. If you're a Van Doren fan this is a must. I hope some her 50's films get DVD release besides ""Teacher's Pet"". She still has a following.",1141257600,21,1256,4.761467889908257
2478730,5,B000E117IO,"This movie is for the Mamie Van Doren fans.  The movie is not important unless you love her and I do.  She strips and takes a beer bath and keeps saying ""It don't taste like tomatoe juice"".  No idea what that means.  Out of all her films this one is a must.",1140652800,13,257,3.8846153846153846
2478731,4,B000E117IO,"The previous writer is in error.  ""Three Nuts in Search of a Bolt"" is definitely the Mamie VanDoren movie.  He has this movie confused with ""Promises! Promises!"" which starred Jayne Mansfield and Tommy Noonan.  The confusion probably arose because both films had Playboy spreads, and both co-starred Tommy Noonan.

""Three Nuts"" is a funny film and for the writer to give it one star just because he had to give it something does a disservice to the movie and Amazon customers.",1138579200,13,476,4.839506172839506

8103738,5,B000E117IO,"1964 saw the release of Three Nuts In Search Of A Bolt starring the Fabulous Mamie Van Doren. She looks her lovliest in this comedy, It played in art houses at the time and it is sexy. Mamie does by present day standards PG nudity. I laughed when she said sure don't taste like tomato juice. Mamie has always been independent, and the most talented of the three Hollywood Blondes of the l950's and 1960's. I liked Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield in some films, but preferred Mamie best. I have met Mamie and she is so nice to her fans. And admire her stand on women's and gay rights. A living legend and one of the last stars of the Golden age of Hollywood.",1392249600,,660,4.288
8103739,5,B000E117IO,"Tommy Noonan had the distinction of appearing in the following movies: ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" (1953), with Marilyn Monroe; ""Promises! Promises!"" (1963), with Jayne Mansfield; and ""3 Nuts In Search Of A Bolt"" (1964), with Mamie Van Doren.  Tommy co-wrote, directed, and starred in the third film.  The scenes (in color) of Mamie Van Doren doing a strip tease, and taking a beer bath, are worth the price of the DVD.  The rest of the movie is in black-and-white, which adds to its strangeness.  The premise of the film is unique, to say the least.  Tommy Noonan (as himself) is hilarious when he acts out the psychological problems of sexually frustrated stripper Saxie Symbol (Mamie Van Doren), alcoholic car salesman Joe Lynch (Paul Gilbert), and kleptomaniacal narcissist Bruce Bernard (John Cronin).  His session with the psychiatrist is supposed to be broadcast on closed circuit television to other psychiatrists.  It is accidentally broadcast on network television, and is a smash hit!  Tommy Noonon was ahead of his time, in this era of ""Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew,"" and similar shows on television.  In the interview with Mamie Van Doren, she mentions how Tommy Noonan wanted to include out-takes from the film, and show them at the end of the movie, or even during the closing credits.  That didn't happen, but it certainly did in later movies, such as the 1979 movie ""Being There,"" which starred Peter Sellers.  Tommy Noonan was a very creative comedian who left us much too soon.",1362182400,4,1496,4.991935483870968
8103740,3,B000E117IO,"Now this is one wacky, fun film! If you are a Mamie Van Doren fan, this dvd is a must. If you are a Tommy Noonan fan, this dvd is also a must. Other movie fans would most likely not appreciate this wacky ride. Now Tommy Noonan, who once starred along with Marilyn Monroe in 1953's Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, then moved on to star along with Jayne Mansfield in 1963's Promises, Promises, is in complete control here with Mamie Van Doren in 3 Nut's In Search Of A Bolt, from 1964. I must admit that the title alone cracks me up & has now become part of my funny vocabulary jokes. The plot is very Psychotronic & involves three ""nuts'-Mamie Van Doren as Saxie Symbol, a stripper, who teams up with two other 'nuts"" seeking psychiatric help. Her partners are an alcoholic used car salesman, played by Paul Gilbert, & a narcissistic male model, played by Paul Cronin. The 3 are all in need of psychiatric help but are unable to pay the doctor's fees. They solve their problem by hiring an unemployed actor, played by Tommy Noonan, to then play out each of their personalities with an expensive psychiatrist, Doctor Myra Von, who is played by Ziva Rodann. The sessions are filmed because the Dr. believes that Noonan has a rare triple personality. The sessions are broadcast on television & make Noonan a big celebrity who then becomes rich & lives happily ever after with Saxie. I know. The plot is totally wacky but actually works quite well with the aid of fine acting by Mamie & Tommy. Noonan is the writer, director, producer, & actor of this film. Just think of the possibility of acting along with 3 of Hollywood's biggest 50's blonde bombshells, Monroe,Mansfield, & Mamie Van Doren. This was not an accident. Unfortunately, in real life, Noonan died in 1968, in his 40's. The dvd by VCI is a real prize. The transfer is pristine & the special features include an excellent 45 minute interview with Mamie which is very revealing & captures her personality quite well. Even though Mamie is now about 80 years old, she is actually still quite attractive & has a very real personality as well. As I said in the beginning, fans of Mamie and/or Tommy Noonan would be ecstatic over this dvd. For that group-MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! SMRZ!!!",1352246400,6,2234,4.615577889447236

8103742,3,B000E117IO,"I'll keep this short: Mamie Van Doren is the only reason to watch this movie. The humor is somewhat dated, the story is contrived, the other actors forgettable. Mamie's beer bath scene is great. The print is superb and the extras are awesome! The movie itself: not so much...",1260144000,3,275,4.63265306122449
