7866427,3,6304246919,"I always enjoy a good movie about the outbreak of some dread epidemic--in fact, ""Contagion"" was one of my favorite such films in recent years.  So when I stumbled across ""Virus"" in my local thrift store, it looked like my kind of movie.  I finally got around to watching it with my hubby last night.  Turns out that by movie's end, both of us were thinking the exact same thing--RiffTrax REALLY needs to lampoon this turkey.

*SPOILERS ALERT*
The premise of the movie is that government bad guys have been running a basically unauthorized biological warfare program.  The opening scenes involve a horrific lab accident in which two of the three scientists doing the lab work are contaminated and the third--who realizes he has been lied to by the government bad guys (imagine that!)--runs away with documentation and the intention of exposing the program.  The lab accident scene was actually great as it immediately grabs your attention and implies the promise of a quality film.  Unfortunately, the rest of the movie failed to live up to that expectation and went downhill from there.

Following the lab accident, the surviving scientist runs away with evidence and contacts a journalist while the government tries to hunt him down.  Meanwhile, a contaminated shipment of the deadly chemicals is already being driven to another location in a tanker truck by a boozed up moron who is the worst, most obnoxious over-actor I've seen in a long time.  I was absolutely thrilled when he finally met his long-overdue demise.  However, before he checks out, he manages to crash his rig and spill said chemicals into the water of a national park.  People and animals are immediately infected while government goons are dispatched to cover up the spill and get rid of the evidence.

Of course, the President initially knows nothing about the program (sure) and sends his Chief of Security, played by Brian Bosworth, straight into the heart of the spill to scout locations for an upcoming photo op to boost his poll numbers.  Bosworth's character is quickly exposed to the virus, but not before meeting a female veterinarian out for a joyride on her horse.  Soon, some one-dimensional characters die and/or are murdered by government lackeys.  The vet's horse dies, everybody with whom they come into contact is infected and dies, but--miraculously!!--both Bosworth and the vet happened to be fighting colds at the moment of exposure to the deadly virus and so they're saved! Yay!  It's so far-fetched it is hilarious.

Ultimately, this one is worth seeing at least once just for the lab accident scene and the subsequent laughs resulting from the ridiculously outlandish story, acting, and dialogue.  NO ONE is going to win any acting awards here, as they're all pretty bad.  But I have to admit I love the scenes where the trained government agents armed with automatic weapons and even grenade launchers still couldn't hit the broad side of a barn if their lives depended on it.  Bullets and bombs flying everywhere, but our hero and heroine are unscathed!  It was so ludicrous I couldn't stop laughing--especially since it reminded Weird Al Yankovic's parody of ""Rambo"" in ""UHF"" (eg, Nazis are firing at Weird Al/Rambo from 2 feet away and still manage to miss).

Anyway, Bosworth and the vet survive.  Bosworth takes a moral stance against the President (who has since learned of the illicit biological warfare program) and is rebuffed.  Then, he is inexplicably allowed to just walk away with an envelope full of incriminating evidence after many other lesser characters were killed off so they wouldn't talk!  Eventually the program and President are exposed and all is right with the world again.

So, it was entertaining, but probably not in the way the filmmaker and writers intended.  As far as content is concerned, there's no sex or nudity, there is some violence, and there are also a few s*** words here and there.  Mostly it was offensive because the storyline was so dumb and full of plot holes, so view at your own risk.",1452038400,,4029,4.918639053254438
7866428,4,6304246919,"Interesting film even though it may be a B-type movie with a minimal budget. However, still not a bad film. Good action, simple plot, what do you expect with a budget under $10 million.",1329609600,,185,4.470588235294118
7866429,3,6304246919,"During a gathering of world leaders for an environmental summit at a national park in Oregon, a truck loaded with banned ""binary"" biowarfare agents plunges off a cliff, dumping its lethal cargo into a stream that empties into the Yellowstone River.  Brian Bosworth brings his usual brand of humorous machismo to the role of Secret Service Agent to the President, who stumbles upon the spill while casing the place prior to the summit.  With the help of a local veterinarian (played with little energy by Leah Pinsent), Bosworth finds some stricken campers, they both catch the virus, and are hospitalized in a fake hosptial set up by Petrodyne chemicals and the government.  Somehow they've miraculously escaped the virus, break out and begin a chase scene through the Oregon wilderness.

The usual government cover-ups are present, along with the typical villains and so-called ""patriots.""

This movie lacks the usual high energy of Boz's other films and he seems a little worn out in this one (maybe it's the virus?).  An entertaining, if derivative, film, that would be an entertaining rental, but I wouldn't buy unless you own a Bosworth collection.",1097625600,3,1153,5.074074074074074

Why? because this is the most disgraceful movie of all time, for the script, the directing, the actors, and even the  music. It's about a virus that contaminate a little town and makes pink  bubbles on the top of a river. Everybody is contamined except our hero: Ken  Fairchild. Why? because he have a cold...I don't tell you the end because  it's too creepy. And there's lot of directing errors like when a car, for  no apparent reason, explode in the air not one, but two times. I tell you  that you should see this movie once in your life. After you'll be able t  say:I saw the worst movie of all times. If you can stay in front of your tv  for all movie long you'll be able to say like Ken:""Yeah, I  succeed!
