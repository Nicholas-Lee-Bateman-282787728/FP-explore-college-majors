4237735,4,B00402FGJY,"As I write this, a review by another user has for over a year been the only one attached to this product, and while his opinions on the actual FILMS are no less valid than any of the hundreds of others you could find by searching, say, IMDB (where such reviews are more appropriate), a simple attempt to have him elaborate on the quality and technical specs of the actual discs in this collection proved fruitless enough to strongly suggest that he never actually purchased this set at all, and in fact simply viewed the movies via their individual DVD (or VHS?) releases, television broadcasts, etc. In fact, a harmless attempt to ask him for clarification was met ONLY with a sarcastic response from another Amazon user, presumably a friend of his. (it should be noted that the posting of THIS review drew him out from under his rock for some witty repartee; click the ""comments"" link beneath my review for his studious response)

Therefore, please consider this review to be an actual look at what you get inside this collection, rather than a collection of capsule movie reviews you can find all over the web.

First off, the set is comprised of 6 discs, packed rather tightly into a single-width DVD case, with flip trays. On the set I received from Amazon, scuffing was visible on one side of the disc inside the front cover and on the facing side of the disc on the first tray, evidently because the two were pressing against each other during shipment due to the tight packaging. They still played fine, but it's something to be aware of. The remaining discs were mint.

Next, bear in mind that most, if not all, of these discs are direct ports of original DVD releases dating back to the late-90's or early 2000's, with a couple from later in the 2000's. Most have never been reissued, so this is as good as it gets (or got). Only RONIN has since been reissued both on a special-edition DVD and a (surprisingly) bare-bones Blu-ray of widely reviled quality).

Now, here's what you ACTUALLY get in this set, WITHOUT my unnecessary opinions on all the films themselves. Technical specs are provided to the best of my abilities:

One last note: Late in 2010, Amazon lowered the price on this set to thirteen dollars and change, something to keep in mind when making your purchase.",1325376000,19,4991,3.73117254528122
4237736,4,B00402FGJY,"JUGGERNAUT: This movie is somewhat different than its cousin THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE. This one doesn't have any over the top acting or action. It isn't overblown in any campy way. It does have a fantastic all-star cast (Richard Harris, Anthony Hopkins, Shirley Knight, Omar Shariff and Ian Holm to name a few), loads of good dialogue, suspense and honest human emotion. .  What happens is a mysterious bomber threatens to detonate a series of bombs aboard a huge luxury liner, the Britannic, unless his demands are met. What follows is tense human drama, as time slowly ticks away while the bomber and his bombs are sought before he can destroy the ship.  It's a ""thinking man's"" action movie I guess.

THE KILLER ELITE: James Caan vs. Robert Duvall in an uneven Peckinpah movie about betrayal, friendship and the Passing of the Guard in the CIA of the 70's. The character study and dialogue make this much more than the usual video game style of actioner you get too often from Hollywood today. The intrigue and double dealing give way to kung fu fighting toward the end but it's still well worth your time.

BLOWN AWAY: You can't escape the sins of your past, especially if you're one Jimmy Dove, member of the Boston Bomb Squad and your sins are personified by Tommy Lee Jones, a stone cold Irish bomber. This movie is well acted, realistic and intense.

HARLEY DAVIDSON AND THE MARLBORO MAN: Everyone has their guilty pleasures and this movie is one of mine. Sure there is a lot of macho posturing even for an 80's action movie but it's done in a spirit of fun. Basically, Mickey Rourke and Don Johnson team up to save a friend's bar by robbing the evil, corrupt bank that holds their friends' mortgage. They accidently rob a transport carrying a new, illegal synthetic drug instead and wind up with the Authorities and The Mob on their tales. It's good, dumb fun if you don't take it too seriously. It also stars Chelsea Field, Vanessa Williams, Tia Carrera, Robert Ginty, Tom Sizemore and features Kelly Hu and pro wrestler Big John Studd.

NO MAN'S LAND: A fantastic movie about the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 90's. I've heard people refer to it as the CATCH-22 of this generation. I can't really explain it better than that except to say that in many ways it's the best movie in this collection.

RONIN: A freelancing former US intelligence agent tries to track down a mysterious package that is wanted by both the Irish and the Russians. He uses his own team of outcast specialists, only this time at least one of them is working toward his own ends. Directed by John Frankenheimer it stars heavyweights like Robert DeNiro, Jean Reno, Stellan Skarsgrd and Sean Bean. There's also a small role for Katarina Witt. It's tense, well plotted, top notch entertainment.

STONE COLD: This one is simple, dumb fun. It's even dumber than HARLEY DAVIDSON...and not as much fun, but it's still enjoyable. Ex-football player Brian Bosworth stars as a cop who goes undercover to catch a nasty outlaw motorcycle gang led by the rotten, evil, despicable Lance Henrikesen (assisted by the ornery William Forsythe). It's got humor, and fightin' and shootin'...all that good stuff.

WINNERS TAKE ALL: Mostly this is a predictable motor-cross drama with a group of riders training to win a big race. The twist is that they are taught by a female rider. That twist makes it a little more interesting than usual.

BOOT CAMP: Rebellious little Mila Kunis is shipped off to a reform school in Fiji (Club Serenity) with a crew of other misbehaving kids. Once they get there they find out the hard way not to back talk the counselors, as the kids are brutalized and tortured back to ""civility"". It's not great and it is a little brutal at times, but it's not horrible either. Lil' Mila does a pretty good job. It's not up the the level of most of the other films in this collection, but it's a decent enough little time waster.

WALKING TALL: This isn't a bad update of the classic 70's revenge/ justice movie. The Rock is suitably likable and heroic and Johnny Knoxville provides fine comic relief. There are no surprises or depth but it does have some laughs and a few exciting fights.",1288224000,12,4179,4.679836512261581
