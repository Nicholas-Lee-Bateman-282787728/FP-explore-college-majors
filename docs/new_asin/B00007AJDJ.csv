I don't know which ones were good and which was so-so since I don't watch old movies.  She likes it so I gave it a 3+.  The picture on the movies was pretty clear and seemed to be without flaws.  According to the g-friend, well worth it if you like old black and white movies. (one may have been in color, cant remember).",1169078400,,483,4.085106382978723
