8096564,1,B000CBD0K4,"This DVD has a great story, very well written....if only the animation matched! Very poorly animated. My kids didn't want to watch it because it was so bad. These are kids who will sit through and request to watch similar movies....so when they don't like the animation it's bad.",1465862400,,279,4.714285714285714
8096565,5,B000CBD0K4,This is not a Hollywood production. This is meant to be an educational movie for young children. It is a good value for money. Watch trailer first on kidsmedia.net before buying.,1296864000,,178,4.774193548387097
8096566,1,B000CBD0K4,"I bought this as a gift for somebody. But before delivering it to the kid, I wanted to evaluate and check it out if it is accurate or not.

It has two major, I mean very major problems:

1. It promotes Shiasm
2. It depicts Prophet Muhammad, angel Gabrial. Angel Gabrial is depicted as sort of tiny weeny angle, like doll, with a very unimpressive voice. Anyways these depictions are not allowed in Islam.

The quality is terrible. It is just moving pictures. Not the type of animated movies that you usually see.",1274400000,2,512,4.483870967741935
8096567,5,B000CBD0K4,This is a great introduction to the true moderate interpretation of true Islam.  Highly recommend it!,1206144000,2,101,5.3125
8096568,1,B000CBD0K4,"I bought this movie as an Eid gift for my 6-year old son, but was soon dissapointed as I started to watch it myself. The quality of the cartoon is very poor - worse than how cartoons were like four dedcades ago. Secondly, it clearly promotes shia idealogy in the narrative. Lastly, it depitcs Prophet Muhammad - both in voice and animation - which is offensive to the mainstream Muslims.",1162080000,9,387,4.542857142857143
