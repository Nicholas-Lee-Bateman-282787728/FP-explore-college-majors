8098105,5,B000CEGXZ0,"Wonderful to watch and listen to Led play and comment on his philosophy of slack key -- playing how you feel and improvising, something I've overlooked by trying to learn primarily from tabulature alone.  Bob Brozman's commentary is excellent and anticipates the questions and difficult spots the student will run into.

I've watched through Ku'u Ipo Onaona and the last 1.5 months have been working my way through the excellent tabs on variations (about ten of them!).  It's coming along!  The tricky thing was to switch to using the index and middle fingers for the melody on the first three strings, because my other main instructional resource, Ozzie Kotani's excellent introductory book**, has the index, middle, and ring fingers on them.

** If you're just starting slack key or new to guitar (as I was), I would definitely begin with Ozzie's book before Led's DVD.  I spent at least 6 months with Ozzie's book (worked through most pieces) before approaching the latter.  Led's DVD has new challenges but after the time spent working through fundamentals, and with much practice to come, I'm excited that they're within the realm of possibility:)",1506816000,,1152,5.031578947368421

8098110,5,B000CEGXZ0,"Slack key guitar employs tunings in which the open strings are tuned down from the standard EADGBE tuning in a way that produces a principal chord, around which compositions are played easily. Many open strings are used to play notes that ring for a long time as the melody proceeds.

I bought this because it teaches Ledward's beautiful ""Slack Key Lullaby""",1382400000,2,357,4.852459016393443
8098111,4,B000CEGXZ0,"This instructive DVD is great for beginning slack-key guitar players provided you already know your way around the instrument and have some experience with finger-picking (Travis or Cotton style). But someone who is new to the guitar is likely to find this DVD too advanced.

All four of the tunes taught are instrumentals. Three feature the most common slack-key tuning, Taro Patch in G (DGDGBD), and one is a Wahine G (DGDF#BD) in which the third string is lowered one-half step allowing some very nice sounding hammer-ons.

The first tune demonstrated, Slack Key Lullaby, features a melody played on the first and third strings against an alternating bass line. Then in the second tune, Ku'u Ipo Onaona, the second string is added to the first and third to play the melody.

Bob Brozman does a very good job as if a student himself, asking Uncle Led the right questions as well as pointing-out slack-key fundamentals and some of the cool ornaments that distinguish Led's style. Written tabs are included, but not needed as long as you're willing to do a lot of rewinding.

This is the real deal. Mahalo to Led, Bob & producer Happy Traum.",1307232000,7,1141,4.8061224489795915
8098112,5,B000CEGXZ0,"Led Kaapana is the consummate slack key artist. Priceless!

His willingness to pass on his knowledge is laudable.

Years ago slack key knowledge was jealously guarded.

If you are interested in learning this is the video for you.

If you are ever on Oahu he often plays on Sundays at Kona Brewing in the Koko Marina.",1305158400,3,316,4.589285714285714
8098113,5,B000CEGXZ0,"This is an excellent example for tuning and playing the slack key style of guitar. For a beginner it provides a new experience for tuning three of a guitar's strings to ""D"" and then playing the melodies.",1282003200,,203,4.513513513513513
8098114,5,B000CEGXZ0,"Hawaiian born and playing slack key taught to me by immediate family, Ledward Kaapana unselfishly shares secrets of his family playing style.  The pace and content of the DVD is detailed and slow moving to allow the viewer to grasp the various techniques.  The enclosed tab sheets are ""priceless"" and serve to refine the exemplified styles.  This is pure traditional Hawaiian slack key by one of the best players in Hawaii.  Much aloha to Bob Brozman and Led Kaapana for the production of a fine product.  As Led says, ""Jus' Press"".",1254528000,7,532,4.802197802197802
