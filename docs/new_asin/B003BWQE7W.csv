8394046,5,B003BWQE7W,"If you are a MCR fan than this is for you. Great story of success. A rag from riches story, that will keep you entertained and give you an in depth look at one of the greatest bands in music today.",1358812800,,197,3.8292682926829267
8394047,4,B003BWQE7W,"I agree with Karla Hopton, this DVD is for hardcore fans only. I suggest it for fans who have seen Life on the Murder Scene, and know almost  everything about MCR. I liked this DVD, because it had some things in it that I didn't know. I don't suggest it for fans who are just beginning to know My Chem.",1309996800,3,302,4.033333333333333
8394048,1,B003BWQE7W,"I recently received this dvd for Christmas and I must say, it is one of the worst dvds I have ever seen! It contains no real video clips of My Chemical Romance and barely any photos. What video clips it does have are of some random unknown people playing guitar and various scenes in New Jersey with some strange artistic effects  added to them. No MCR music is used, only some generic rock. A lady in the background will proceed to tell you facts that you, if you are any sort of MCR fan, already know. If you want a GOOD dvd of My Chemical Romance, purchase the cd/dvd combo of Life on the Murder Scene.",1293408000,19,605,4.2155172413793105
8394049,2,B003BWQE7W,This is a DVD/CD combo pack.  The DVD was previously released as 'Things That Make You Go Mmmm'.  It is an unauthorized biography.  The CD contains audio interviews.  I would consider this package a must for hardcore My Chem fans only.,1281657600,6,235,4.658536585365853
