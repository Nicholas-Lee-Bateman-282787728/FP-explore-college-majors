8475198,5,B005IX3C54,"Very good movie ! The most personel Robert Parrish' work ! The movie was, alas, unsuccessful ! At States and France both. Good work to Parrish, Jean Seberg pretty and talented. Wonderful ! Good casting : Stanley Baker, Addison Powell (both very good), Interesting cast of French actors ! Philippe Forquet, Maurice Teynac among others. I've never seen the movie (made in automn 1962). I'm at screen a few seconds, with 6 French words but face camera ! (The young French waiter of Saint-Paul de Vence). The movie was programmed for the first time on French TV, a few days before. Operation ""Second Chance"". Good duplication ... Satisfied !",1519948800,,637,4.853211009174312
8475199,5,B005IX3C54,"I'd forgotten what a beautiful actress the late Jean Seberg was. She captured perfectly the role an American expatriate who tried to make a career of a painter but the film was pretty much a spot on reflection of her own life. I thought the film was fascinating and it held my attention throughout. What a pity her real life was much more dramatic and she ended up a suicide in the rear seat of her car. Her Black Panther connection was controversial, whether or not it was real is debatable. She continues to be an enigma to this very day, but she left behind some classic films, the most notable was Breathless, a milestone of the French New Wave.",1507593600,,649,4.416666666666667
8475200,5,B005IX3C54,"What a beautiful woman Jean was, inside and out.  She is one of the few woman on film that the camera was able to reach into her soul. The black and white cinemaphotography is stunning. The film is shot in France and seems almost autobiographical and mirrors Jean's real life. I recommend this film to others because it is a study of great film making.",1424217600,3,352,4.415384615384616
8475201,5,B005IX3C54,"wonderful, sensitive and true to life. The girl became lucky. She found a man who took her away from the ""free love"" life-style which she innocently fell into.",1422835200,,159,4.714285714285714

8475203,4,B005IX3C54,"Hard to believe this film is released only 4 years after the iconic teen love story A Summer Place. The sexual mores of films from the late 50s and early 60s seem very dated for the most part. All that good girl/bad girl stuff. Unplanned pregnancies. This film points in the direction of the changes that will be on the horizon in 1/2 a decade henceforth. Though there are of course no raunchy explicit sexual coupling scenes (what a relief), Jean plays to perfection, the innocent American abroad who slowly becomes promiscuous, corrupted and cynical and in a series of unsatisfying relationships.  Seberg's delicate beauty and subtle acting were never much appreciated in American though I think she was something of an icon in Europe. She came to a very early, tragic end unfortunately. I enjoy watching her on the screen. The film is set in Paris which is always a treat in film. The costuming is very elegant, Holly Go Lightly Givenchy stylish (after her initial early days in the city). The hairstyles & clothing are very typical of the elegant Kennedy White House years which is nostalgic for us older film fans. I recommend the film primarily for women and gay men. I don't think most red-blooded macho type men would really find it all that interesting, but I definitely think it has some insight into the perils of love amongst the artsy jet-set crowd.",1403136000,3,1362,4.746835443037975
8475204,4,B005IX3C54,"A young American girl (Jean Seberg) has come to Paris to paint. But soon art takes a backseat to to a semi-hedonistic lifestyle of parties and affairs among the sophisticated and somewhat jaded ""artsy"" set. This is a lovely film. If anyone still needs proof that Seberg could act, this film ought to settle that. She's effortlessly convincing as the naive mid-western teenager out of her element and seamlessly morphing into the soignee darling of the jet set. Based on the novel by Irwin Shaw (RICH MAN POOR MAN) who also did the screenplay and co-produced, the film once again has Seberg as the Henry Jamesian like heroine (think DAISY MILLER), the unsophisticated American ingenue ripe for European corruption. But it's more than that, it explores the basic need to belong to someone amongst a crowd that considers such feelings petit bourgeois. Directed by Robert Parrish and handsomely shot in B&W by Michel Kelber (Renoir's FRENCH CAN-CAN). With Stanley Baker, Philippe Forquet, Claudine Auger, Addison Powell, Jack Hedley and James Leo Herlihy (the author of MIDNIGHT COWBOY) as Seberg's suitor.

The Sony MOD DVDr is a handsome B&W anamorphic wide screen (1.85) transfer.",1381795200,9,1179,5.108808290155441
8475205,3,B005IX3C54,I purchased this video because Jean Seberg was the actress.  She made so few movies but I want to see them all.  This is the story of a shallow American girl living in France who doesn't realize her dreams and becomes jaded by her experiences.  Worth seeing for the scenery & for the actress.,1371600000,,292,4.37037037037037
8475206,3,B005IX3C54,"""In the French Style"" is director Robert Parrish's stab at making a ""New Wave"" picture.  Hence the title, which also references the French manner of greeting with air kisses, and the open-ended French attitude towards relationships.

The movie is based on a couple of stories by writer Irwin Shaw.  The film follows the progress of a young, idealistic American girl(Jean Seberg, in her tenth film) who is trying to be an artist in Paris.  Starry-eyed but pragmatic, Christina James (Seberg) paints doe-eyed people ala Marie Laurencin.  She strikes up a friendship with a handsome young Frenchman named Guy.  The two have a breezy but contentious relationship.  At the point when Christina decides to consummate the affair in  a cheap Parisian hotel, Guy confesses that he has misled Christina about his age.

This sets the tone for the rest of the film, which awkwardly jumps forward 4 years to show that Christina has become a polished, but jaded adult, who has had multiple affairs within the Parisian fashion scene.  She falls in love with a roving journalist (Stanley Baker), is visited by her father ( who pronounces her a failure), lapses into a period of withdrawal from her life, and then decides to abandon Paris to marry an American surgeon she has met.

Awkward transitions and dull, pedestrian interior scenes doom this movie to mediocrity.  ""In the French Style"" is awfully meek at the times when it needs to be bold, holding all the characters at arm's length and developing no empathy.  Jean Seberg is beautiful as ever, but she is boxed-in by the material and by Parrish's lack of imagination.  Scenes of Paris are beautiful, but the interior locations are like cardboard. Only a few sequences work to evoke the ""jet set"" life, with the best of them being a scene framing Seberg on an airport platform.  But Parrish can manage no more than rote and inadequate storytelling, inhibiting and subduing character development.

A few years on John Schesinger would show how this type of movie should be made, with Julie Christie and ""Darling"" (1965).",1354320000,3,2060,4.927536231884058
