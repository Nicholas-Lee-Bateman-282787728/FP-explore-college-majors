7906237,5,B00000F0I8,"I love Marty Short. He is the best of SCTV Alumni. And still I collect all there is on his characters. I tapped this in the 80's and transferred it to DVD since the VHS was getting worn. I show to all my friends and they all beg me to send them copy's. I hate that there is no legal version on DVD. I made a comp of this I Martin Short Goes Hollywood and his 2nd special on Showtime, featuring Lawrence Aurbach, Gossip columnist Troy Sorren and of course Ed Grimley and Shelly Duvalls Johnny Appleseed, with Martin Short as Johnny and Molly Ringwald as his love interest. along with the original first runs of Glick interviews long lost. I wish I could get liscensed to make an official release of all i have accumulated over the decades of this comic genius. if anyone knows who i should approach leave a reply. i used to as a kid write to Marty at his office when he was under the Great Bernie Brillstien. I hate to go under Mr Shorts nose with sharing the undying laughter he has given to me and more than 2 dozen of my friends who always ask me for copys such as this... but...what can I do? laughter and brilliant comedy are truly hard to come by and its a shame to vault all Martin Short has given to the world for more than four decades. The highlights of this VHS are Jackie Rodgers JR, Jerry Lewis in Tender Fella, a parody of Tender Mercies and Marty's Idol dancer of all Dancers Dale O'Day. This is hilarious and definitely worth putting out on DVD. But how to do it legally...??? Open to ideas.",1358467200,2,1506,4.232638888888889

I can't afford a $145 or whatever VHS (which is obsolete technology), even if one could be found! Please, Powers That Be, re-release this!",1305676800,,254,4.543478260869565

7906241,5,B00000F0I8,"what a film! as if one hour of my favorite actor was not enough, roles by joe flahrety, dave thomas, catherine o hera, cristopher guest, tracy ulman, and more made it more facinating plus it was direted by american pie father eugene levy and co-writtenby dick blassuci ( i am not sure how that is spelt, but i do know that he wrote for sctv).
from the opening song to the closing song of 'someday' i laghed my head off. he begins the film by talking about a conversation he was having with the famous woody allen and how he tried to defend his new  home of hollywood wich had been insulted during the conversation wich is how the film begins.
martin takes us to visit his home theater which has changed a little ( it now reads sex sex  sex ) and gives us a bio of a boyhood hero of his, we meet jackie roggers jr., lawrence orbach, a plastic sergeon, siskel and ebert and of course the famous ed grimly.
this act ( ed grimly ) was definatly the funniest. while considering whether or not he should market the ed grimly silencer to promote himself, ed goes into the bathroom, shortly after siskel and ebert enter and ebert dies of a suden heart attack. siskel realises that it would look like murder. he finds ed grimly, a witness, in a nearby tiolet ( litteraly in the tiolet ) and decides he has to shoot him and to silence the bullets he of course uses the ed grimly silencer. just as he is about to be shot, ed wakes up and descovers that it waqs all a dream. of course he decides to market a board game instead.
all in all i give this film a perfect rating. if you like sctv, saterday night live or just martin short in general, this film is a must get!",1010188800,7,1657,4.191222570532916
7906242,5,B00000F0I8,"If you loved the old Canadian comedy series called Second City TV, you'll love ""I, Martin Short, Goes Hollywood.""
This all-new video  features most of the cast (though there's no Andrea Martin, unfortunately!)  and the comedy is the same:  an exaggeration of all those TV/movie cliches  you're kind of half aware of, but don't realize are so ridiculous until  Martin and the gang bring it out.
As with the series, there's also the  overlying gag that this is real television -- a special, put on to promote  the career of a real semi-star, Martin Short.  Lots of people won't get  this, I'm afraid, since Short IS a real comedian, but if you're aware  enough of TV's strange, separate kind of reality, the jokes are not only  hilarious but also fascinating, sort of like Monty Python's versions of  English history.  Since the SCTV writers always stay in that twilight zone  between ""real"" TV and satire, though, there are parts that a lot  of people just won't get.
Martin starts out with a Woody Allen-type  monologue (dropping Woody's name, of course, to show he's in with the movie  crowd), gets philosophical a la Woody, and then takes us along to see the  real Hollywood.
Among other things, we watch a short history of the man  who inspired Short to go into acting (including a spoof of ""The Wizard  of Oz"");  Jackie Robbins Jr. performing live on stage and resisting  the temptation to compromise his Art;  and a docu-clip about an actor who's  just not making it in Hollywood for some reason (!).
We visit a bustling  plastic surgeon's office and see him test a face for skin tightness (by  bouncing a coin off it and measuring how many feet it travels) and where we  catch a glimpse at one of his famous clients (""Make an appointment for  Monday, Michael -- no reason that chin has to look that manly!"");  and  then go to a restaurant where the movie crowd hang out, where we meet  Siskel and Ebert (Joe Flaherty and Dave Thomas), Ed Grimley (who's signing  a high-powered contract, and has a Hickcockian sequence in the men's room),  and lots of movie agents (Tracey Ullman is one).
At the end, Martin gives  a private screening of this video to hundreds of his close personal friends  at home.  They think it's so-so.  Martin's crushed, and his large Swedish  wife (played by Kathleen O'Hara) tries to console him, but to no avail.  Finally, an Oscar-type statue with Jerry Lewis's face and voice tells him  to never give up trying to make it in Hollywood.
""I, Martin  Short"" is wit and satire at its highest level.  There's also (unlike  the otherwise brilliant Mike Myers' stuff) a minimal amount of sexual and  scatalogical explicitness.  If I had 3 wishes, one of them would be for the  original SCTV programs to be made available on video -- not mangled, like  ""The Best of John Candy,"" (you wouldn't cut up ""Abbey  Road,"" would you?) but the whole, unedited shows.",964828800,11,2882,4.658682634730539
7906243,5,B00000F0I8,"Many times I've seen Martin Short in movie roles and he's been unable to really ""show his stuff"" comically.  In this video, ""Martin Short Goes Hollywood,"" he'll have you laughing till your sides ache.  I saw this when it was an HBO original, and I've always remembered how  funny it was and wished that I had a copy of it.  I was SO glad to find  that Amazon.com carried the video.  You will be, too.",945907200,8,400,4.266666666666667
