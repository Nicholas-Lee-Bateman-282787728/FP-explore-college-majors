7921867,5,B00004SSQS,"I heartily recommend In Search of Tuscany to anyone who plans to visit this area of Italy. It is beautifully filmed and host John Guerrasio is a charming and engaging guide for this journey. Especially in the scenes where he interacts with local citizens, Guerrasio brings a warmth and curiosity that enables the viewer to get a sense of both the geography and the humanity of the region. Most important for my family and me, Guerrasio asks the kinds of questions that we would ask and he does so without condescension. Guerrasio is the guide that any tour group would be grateful for and In Search of Tuscany is the best travelogue we own.",1363132800,2,640,4.62280701754386
7921868,1,B00004SSQS,"This is, without a doubt, the worst travelogue I have ever seen.  Beyond his egomaniacal ramblings, beyond his stale jokes that merely betray a profound insecurity about a land and culture he knows nothing about (nor truly wants to investigate), I was saddened to see such a trainwreck put forth by PBS, who should know better.  I was saddened that this is the face the honorable people of this beautiful part of Italy - the producers, winemakers, artisans and citizens of Tuscany - were forced to share time with in public viewing.  Mr. Guerrasio may have a career elsewhere, and I wish him well there - just stay away from anything remotely related to travel, food, or wine.",1178582400,5,676,4.711864406779661
