8397952,5,B003J8N1CY,"I originally watched Caroline Sandry on television and loved her easy to follow exercises. Now I can follow her on her dvd, which makes it much more convenient, since now I can watch her when I want. If you want to workout, but want something that is low impact then I highly recommend
her dvd. Her workouts last for 24 minutes and are designed for the upper body, lower body and the core. Buy it you'll love it.",1464393600,,412,4.294871794871795

8397955,5,B003J8N1CY,It's a great workout that's not overly complicated and you don't need a lot of stuff to do it. It also has a stress relief part that helps me sleep like a baby!,1378425600,,160,3.878787878787879

Includes core, lower body, and upper body workouts.",1358380800,,157,5.869565217391305
8397957,5,B003J8N1CY,"I'd been looking for this DVD and am so glad to have found it here on Amazon.  It consists of three 20-25 minute pilates based sections, for upper body, lower body and core plus a 10 minute ""stress buster"" bonus section.  I assume the stress buster is some style of yoga.  It really does bust stress.  I found the others, especially the core section to be very restorative.  Has Caroline Sandry put anything else out on DVD?",1349222400,2,424,4.454545454545454
