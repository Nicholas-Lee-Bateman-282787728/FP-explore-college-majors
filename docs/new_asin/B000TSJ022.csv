2909109,5,B000TSJ022,"I've been working out for years and years doing treadmill, swimming, elliptical, weights and decided to incorporate yoga into my newest weight loss phase.  This DVD is amazing!  All those years of gym-style cardio hasn't changed my body for the better as much as these 20-minute sessions 3-4 times a week has.  I'm leaner, stronger, more flexible, destressed, and happier (so is my husband!).  This is a great DVD for anyone.  Thank you to the Young Survival Coalition!",1222214400,,469,4.961538461538462
2909110,3,B000TSJ022,"This is set outside with a wonderful view that have been on other Self dvds & 2 women backup, one showing modifications, all in good shape. The production values are professional. The music starts with a good beat, though a little too like other fitness music, but it changes with the workout & gets lighter with more Asian & then meditative music which was wonderful.
Stephanie Culen does well telling you when to breath almost at all times when she's not giving pointers on how to do the poses right. She doesn't have time to give full explanations, only the usual reminders. Her voice was not soothing to me, not irritating, but it sounded a little stressed/stiff possibly from nervousness.
Intro about workout: 3 min
Active Sequence: 21 min
mountain with arms moved to breath, mountain w/side bends, wide angle standing w/arms moved to breath, standing wide angle bend, warrior 2 on each side, , warrior 1 & 2, repeat on other side, warrior 2, 1, 2, repeat on other side, standing wide angle bend, warrior 2, revolved warrior, triangle, side angle, crescent w/prayer twist, 1 leg hamstring stretch, down dog, standing fwd bend, mountain, repeat on other side.  Sequence again on both sides with poses only held for 1 breath each. Cat/cow stretch, hands/knees 1 arm/1 leg up balance, child's pose held several breaths. Locust, bridge, reclined butterfly.

Reclined butterfly, in that position, mild sit-ups a bit, knees to chest stretch, pilates ab exercise bicycle elbows to knees, pilates reclined single straight leg lifts/downs, knee to chest stretch, reclined w/straight legs up with flexed feet to stretch legs upward.  Reclined single straight leg stretch to head, figure 4 knee to chest stretch, reclined crossed leg spinal twist, fish, sitting fwd bend, legs in figure 4, go into table top position to strengthen legs, single leg sitting fwd bend, single wide leg fwd bend, single leg wide angle bend, butterfly, seated side torso stretch, easy seated spinal twist, seated, normal, slow, deep breathing
Final relaxation/Savasana: 1 min

I like Stephanie's importance of breath, but I did not feel the poses felt right, most felt like they should be reverse to open up better. I am  picky about body awareness. I also did not like the repetitiveness of the warrior 2s in the beginning nor the pilates workout for something titled ""de-stressing."" I can see how others would like it though. Since she does not have time for full explanations on doing the poses correctly, this may not be best for newbies as one of the backup girls did the warrior 2 incorrectly by allowing her knee to go past her toes.

2909111,4,B000TSJ022,"You don't have to be a yoga pro to do this DVD.  Stephanie Culen cues well and gives modifications if you need to make the poses a little easier.  She encourages you to work at your own pace and listen to your body.  The standing section starts out with side stretches and warrior poses.  Stephanie builds on the basics and it becomes a nice, flowing routine.  The floor routine is a little strange at first with the abdominal exercises.  You hold the stretches a little longer in this section.  I like both workouts.  You get a thorough stretch and it's not intimidating if you're not that flexible.",1206662400,,600,4.542056074766355
2909112,5,B000TSJ022,"This is a good workout with a great instructor--she is very businesslike in the sense of getting right down to the workout without extra chit-chat (religious or otherwise), but does so in a very calm fashion.  I only noticed a couple of areas near the end of the first workout where she seemed to rush things a bit (the twists) to where you were not quite in position to get a couple of breaths in before you were already getting out of it and going on to the next position.  However, since there is always a bit of lag time when you're following along anyway, this is something you can adjust for.

Whether you're a beginner or more advanced, you will get a very soothing workout. The scenery is beautiful. I hope Ms. Culen does some more yoga DVDs soon.",1205971200,,755,4.378571428571429
2909113,5,B000TSJ022,"Having done a Yoga class at my local YMCA and enjoying it, I decided to pick up a yoga video for home.  I grabbed this one and am so glad that I did.  As the other reviewers have stated this DVD is made up of 2 routines that both last 20 minutes.  The DVD allows you to select either one or the other.  If you choose to do the first routine (standing yoga) it will flow into the second routine (floor yoga).
The video was well done with enough repetition so that even the most green beginner would be able to pick up the poses.  The instructor was very clear and offered several different variations as to levels of poses.
The day after doing this yoga dvd (even though I typically do at least 45 minutes cardio and weight training at my gym several times a week) I had some muscle soreness.
This is a great workout for those who are looking for a low impact workout.  I would highly recommend it.",1200787200,9,897,4.186046511627907
2909114,5,B000TSJ022,"This workout is a great stress reliever for those times we feel anxiety, restlessness and stressed out. The format is yoga stretching style. The first section is done standing and is more active yoga stretching. The second segment is restorative meditative floor stretching. I loved the music and the instructors voice was very calming throughout the workout. The scenery is a very relaxing beautiful outdoor setting. I did the whole workout and felt very relaxed and gently thorougly stretched out at the end. I bought this workout so that I would have two 20 minute yoga stretching workouts to add-on to other high intensity workouts. But I found out that this is a great workout for just before bedtime also. This workout is a keeper with many uses. I would highly recommend this workout to all those that love good music, beautiful outdoor relaxing scenery and an instructor with a soothing voice and demeanor. Worth having in everyones workout collection",1198800000,12,959,5.0
2909115,5,B000TSJ022,I enjoy this dvd. You can do the whole workout or pick between two workouts---First is standing yoga--I liked it. Second is a floor ab/yoga stretch--very nice. It will make a great addition to my collection!!,1198108800,4,208,4.805555555555555
8210531,5,B000TSJ022,This is a great yoga dvd. I've tried quite a few through my library and this is one of the only ones I felt was worth buying.,1450569600,,125,3.6666666666666665
8210532,5,B000TSJ022,"Great flowing workout. Easy to follow and beautiful to watch. I do the first practice almost every day, and both practices when I have time. It was exactly what I wanted.",1401753600,,170,4.516129032258065
8210533,4,B000TSJ022,My husband and I enjoy this at the end of a stressful or active day.  Good directions are given and the ending chavasna is very relaxing.,1399593600,,137,4.269230769230769
8210534,5,B000TSJ022,"I've really been enjoying this DVD and find myself using it regularly. It contains 2 routines that both last just over 20 minutes. ""Active Sequence"" is a standing series of connected warrior poses and ""Restorative"" which is done on the floor. Usually I find that I only have time and motivation for about 30 minutes of yoga a day (no matter what my good intentions) but with this DVD I always end up doing both of them together, it's that good.

Stephanie Culen is a relaxing instructor, giving just the right amount of clear reminders (especially regarding your breathe) without becoming chatty or annoying. There isn't any Sanskrit used here and beginners with some basic knowledge should do just fine. This has a nice outdoor setting, good production values and enjoyable music that changes tempo depending on the routine.

ACTIVE SEQUENCE-(24 min) Nice warm up using breathe, moving into 2 sets of connected (add-on) Warrior poses. Great flow to this with some modifications given. Includes; Mountain pose, Warrior 1 and 2, Side Angle Pose, Triangle, Downward Dog, Crescent w/prayer twist,  Forward and Wide Angle Bends. She then moves onto the mat for Cat/Cow, Locust and Bridge pose.

At this point you can stop or continue on with the restorative section which begins right away from the reclined position.

RESTORATIVE-(21 min) During this part I really appreciated Stephanie reminding me to breathe deeply (which I always forget to do) It really helped me to relax (and I suppose de-stress). Here we work through; Reclined Butterfly, Crunches, Bicycle, Single legs lifts, Knee to chest, Reclined leg stretch (to head), Reclined crossed leg stretch, Fish pose, Forward bend, Table top, Seated side stretches, Spinal twists and a brief Savasana.

8210535,4,B000TSJ022,"SELF - Ultimate De-Stress Yoga is a good workout.  You can do either of the twenty minute segments or do the full forty minute workout.  Not terribly hard but good for anyone who is above a beginner level.  As part of a fitness routine that includes other workouts, it's effective.",1313452800,,281,4.58
8210536,5,B000TSJ022,Definitely the best yoga dvd I have purchased to date. Not only is this incredibly relaxing but it also provides a great workout to strengthen your muscles. The poses are well explained and flow easily from one to the next. I also love how the practice is split into two sections: an active sequence and a restorative sequence. Hoping for more yoga dvd from Self in the near future!,1312761600,,382,4.550724637681159
8210537,3,B000TSJ022,"I was looking for a de-stresser and I didn't get it in ""Self-Ulitmate De-Stress Yoga."" It was too repetitive with the warrior 1 and 2 poses, and the instructor's cueing was just blah. The two young ladies in the back appeared to be beginners as well. Not that there's something wrong with that, but, I just didn't hate or love the DVD. If I had to do it over again, I would have passed on this one. I didn't feel the energy, scenery, nor the background music.

Overal rating 2.0",1308873600,,478,4.311111111111111
8210538,3,B000TSJ022,"I enjoyed the first sequence of flow yoga.  Good instructions and variations are shown but not really talked about.  It was the restorative yoga portion I had problems with.  They should have called it what it is; a pilates workout.  Anyone who has done a restorative program knows you aren't doing crunches.  So, overall, a nice workout with good instructors, just bad with the descriptions.",1281484800,3,392,4.969230769230769
8210539,5,B000TSJ022,"I've taken a beginner's yoga course previously and got this DVD to help with some substantial problems dealing with stress. I believe it has helped immensely! The work-out level is light (as is the yoga experience level) but undoubtedly counts for something and I truly believe my body is having a healthier stress reaction since I've been doing it regularly for a couple of weeks. Added bonus: My little toothpick arms are suddenly toned. I wasn't trying to tone them, but it looks nice. I only wish the whole thing were longer because I enjoy it so much. I recommend this DVD to friends. Some reviews for other yoga DVDs have complained of choppy splicing... this workout does not have this problems. It flows beautifully. There is also a tranquil background and satisfactory soundtrack.",1275696000,,789,4.895522388059701
8210540,5,B000TSJ022,"Stephanie Culen presents an easy-to-follow yoga routine without difficult postures that look impossible to do. She cues well and her soft voice makes this workout more relaxing. The first 20 minutes is mostly standing postures and the second 20 minutes is mostly seated postures.

The setting is peaceful with a redwood platform set on grass with a stone wall in the background. I liked how the workout begins with lots of active arms while you are doing the postures.

There is a brief warm-up followed by warrior poses, triangle, a lunge, downward facing dog, forward bend, cat/cow, bridge and reclining butterfly. The second section starts almost immediately after this and includes sit-ups, scissors from pilates, leg stretches, spine stretches, fish, seated forward bend, hip stretches, more leg stretches, side stretches and seated spinal twists.

So how will you feel after doing this workout? You should feel calm, relaxed and centered. I really liked the stretching and the fact that I could do all the exercises without very much difficulty. This is not overly challenging and is designed to make you feel healed and nourished.
