8642772,5,B00IJZZCSI,"Excellent study! This book is by far my favorite book (and DVD) about the importance of respecting your husband, regardless of how you feel or the overall health of your marriage. It is also a great reminder of who we are in Christ and how much we are loved by Him. The book gives practical tips on how to show your husband respect in ways that are particularly meaningful to him. The results are powerful. You will notice a different response in your husband, even if it's just little nuggets of change in how he relates and responds to you. This book suggests you to be the one to put yourself out there and take the first steps, requiring nothing of your husband. However, the blessings will come to both of you. Even if the changes in the marriage relationship aren't dramatic at first, you can be assured you're walking in obedience to Christ in displaying respect toward your husband. Can't recommend it highly enough for all married women!",1466121600,2,946,4.603550295857988
8642773,5,B00IJZZCSI,"Dr Emerson & Sarah Eggerich came and hosted a Love & Respect conference at our church, Destiny Worship Center. At that time Sarah and Joy were launching this study, just for ladies.  We were one of the first to dive into these key truths and I personally have hosted a small group since. It is the most transforming, yet challenging studies that I lead. Dive into it. . . I promise you will see God unlock His power and influence in your life.",1465776000,,443,4.337349397590361
8642774,5,B00IJZZCSI,"I am currently using this kit for my personal use. I am applying respect into my marriage and this kit has really helped me through the tough lonely and hurtful parts in still staying the course like the 5 cd kit that I am also using. This respectfully yours kit has helped fine tune more of what women need to know when it comes to staying the course with a disobedient husband. This kit truly gives me that much more needed push to keep applying it baby girl. And to understand why my husband is not responding like how I pray. However, I am forever changed and am praising God for this change. I know I don't understand it all or how, but I DO believe in GOD and HE will help me finish this on the other side with more then I could ever think or imagine.  I am praising HIS name in this and letting anyone I know about Dr. Emmersons work he has done for me.  I trust God and will focus on him and not my problems. I do respect my husband and I love him dearly. And with time hopefully soon he will open his heart back to me. Prayers welcome.",1464393600,2,1044,4.063106796116505

She has already gone through the study and liked it so much that she wanted her own copy in order to invite other ladies for the study. (We both went through the Love & Respect study, which is also great.)",1425427200,,255,4.12
