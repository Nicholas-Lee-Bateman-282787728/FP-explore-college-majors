Anyway, this film is about Drew Carson a normal teenager who is a martial arts competitor but is humiliated in front of a National Audience by his opponent. After losing miserably to his rival, Trevor in that particular martial arts tournament he decides to carry on his sensei's  dream to become a Shaolin Monk and to seek further assistance from the monestary. When Drew arrived to the temple he was refused entry and thrown of the premises but refused to leave.

Its an eclectic, decent set, mainly appealing to karate aficionados but also containing a passable thriller. Whether or not you buy these films as a set or individually should depend mainly on how much you value picture quality, because these are clearly VHS rips.

Its a study of a man who must deal with the consequences of his infidelity, and Norton is bolstered by some versatile costars who help elevate the picture considerably (watch for a particularly good performance from Karen Moncrieff as the jilted wife). Nevertheless, the movie can get very boring: though the fight scenes offer some highlights, the overall slow pace and scruffy production values take their toll.

This 3 disc Collection on DVD is just OK. I bought American Shaolin import around the same time as this set which houses that film. All 3 films are on one disc and from comparing the import dvd and this film in this set the PQ is not as good. Its darker and more pixelated. But this is the only way to own this film if you don't have a region free player.

The other 2 films I have not watched yet. I say if you like the film and or films in this collection and don't have a region free player to import then this will be your only option so pick it up. No word on some one re-releasing this remastered and or on Blu-Ray",1448841600,,904,5.227586206896552

7828793,3,630264660X,"""American Shaolin"" is the fifth of seven martial arts movies created by the Season Film Corporation that combine Hong Kong action and production values with American performers. It's easily the most ambitious of the series but also arguably the least satisfying when viewed purely as a karate movie. The increased emphasis on plot and character development may be enough for others to rate it more generously, but I can't see fit to rate it any higher than three stars.

The story: martial artist Drew Carson (Reese Madigan) is defeated and humiliated in a tournament match by a dirty fighter (Trent Bushey, ""All My Children""). Vowing to never let this happen again, he travels to the Shaolin Temple in China to train with the legendary fighting monks...

I have to praise the film's aesthetic accomplishments. This is clearly a relatively low budget movie, but many of the scenes set in the temple highlight the lavish locations and a lot of the ceremonial costumes are eye-catching. The cinematography isn't without merit: scenes wherein dozens of monks strike forms in a courtyard would have fit perfectly into an older wuxia film. The dramatic content sets a high for the series, though I have to remind you that the acting in previous entries like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Retreat-No-Surrender/dp/B0002848WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Retreat, No Surrender</a>&nbsp;was pretty darn bad and not too difficult to build on. Reese Madigan is probably the soundest leading man the series ever had, and a young Daniel Dae Kim (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost/dp/B00005JNOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost</a>) as a supporting disciple shows some of the talent he'd subsequently find acclaim for. Head abbot Henry O (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Romeo-Must-Die/dp/B00003CXGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Romeo Must Die</a>) gives what's easily the best straight performance these films have ever seen.

The focus of the movie is on Drew, who - as a member of a class of disciples - goes through the rigorous training of the Shaolin tradition. Filmmakers long ago have learned that this is easy fodder for a bunch of cool training scenes, but ""American Shaolin"" is far from being&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-36th-Chamber-of-Shaolin/dp/B000MM0LEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 36th Chamber of Shaolin</a>&nbsp;in this regard. The training scenes aren't all that creative or entertaining, at least not as much as the out-of-nowhere practices in surrealism like an impromptu music video for a cover version of ""Summertime Blues."" Also, Drew isn't exactly the most sympathetic character for most of the movie: personifying the dumb American foreigner, he's always doing stupid things like playing pranks on his sifu (Cliff Lenderman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superfights/dp/B00009B8BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superfights</a>), complaining about the food, and sneaking his monk brothers out of the temple to fight at a dance party.

Things like character deficiencies would be easier to overlook if the action content was more engaging, but I think it's safe to say that this is a low point for the series. Then again, it's not a total loss: the fights get better as the movie progresses, finishing with a set of very good ring matches. However, most of the brawls are definitely below the standard. This is the first time where I got the impression that the performers just couldn't keep up with the pace required by the choreography: many of the battle are grounded exchanges of kung fu movements like you'd see in Shaw Bros. flicks, but most of the performers are slow enough to make the fights look fake. I think everyone involved here would have fared better with more conventional kickboxing-style fights.

The movie's upbeat tone eventually saves it from being too boring; I can't imagine what this film would have been like had it been directed in a more depressed manner. If you're going to collect the entire series, then definitely pick this one up (for a decent price), but unless the subject matter particularly piques your interest, save it for a rental.",1249948800,,4303,5.845541401273885

7828795,3,630264660X,"The sequal to ""King of The Kickboxers"" goes in a completely different direction, and could easily just have been called ""American Shaolin"" and left at that.  The same production company is involved, thus creating another cheesy movie, but with above average fighting compared to the typical American-made martial arts film.  Although the whole idea of an American (Drew Carson played by Reese Madigan) coming to study at the Shaolin Temple is a bit unbelievable, it ends up being a fun and unique story that seemed to grab my attention eventually.

The beginning is a little slow, acting is poor, and everything is just downright cheesy.  Drew is humilated at a local tournament, by a guy who fights dirty - including pulling down the pants of his opponent (don't worry, its not perverted or anything).  Drew feels the only to way to become good enough is to train with the best, and travels to China hoping to become a Shaolin Monk.  After painstankingly waiting for days, he is accepted.  While in the Temple, Drew constantly causes trouble, which leads others to do the same.  It actually becomes interesting to see if he can actually make it as a Monk.  There are still plenty of cheesy scenes, but alot of it becomes fun, and you gotta love the soundtrack, which is a slightly different version of ""Summertime Blues"".

The action is sparse in the first half of the film, but began to pick up more and more.  The real treat is the finale of the film.  Drew once again faces off in the ring against his former opponent.  There is a pretty good fight between the Daniel Dae Kim character and this guy, who eventually tosses Kim out of the ring.  Drew has no choice but to fight, and does so in a well choreogprahed fight which lasts at least 5 minutes.

In the end, I couldn't decide how I felt about the film.  I enjoyed the fighting the most, but couldn't decide if the story was just silly or what.  It is fun for what it is, but I got that darn Shaolin Temple blues song stuck in my head.",1187395200,,1994,4.50974930362117

Theres a tiny bit of language But it teaches great lessons in humility, descipline, forgiveness & acceptance.
