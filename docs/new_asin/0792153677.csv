137670,4,0792153677,My twin 2 year olds find this particular video of Blue a little dry as they are not quite up to the language engagement in this one. Best for 3 up.,1035504000,6,147,3.774193548387097
137671,5,0792153677,"My sons 23 months and he loves Blues Clues he just learned all the alphabet and i think now it's time for him to be able to recognize letters if he sees them it's even better that he has his favorite cartoon caracter teaching it to him this tape to me is perfect i ordered it last week and the day i recieved it he watched it 7 times and started saying things like mommy thats a C-H-A-I-R and it made me so happy i will diffently recommend this to all parents and the 1 2 3,s part is just as educational i really give blue and steve two thumbs up they really did there thing with this one GOOD JOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1031356800,6,616,4.099173553719008
137672,3,0792153677,"My son is 1 1/2 yr old, and is already a big fan of ""Blues Clues"".
""ABC's and 123's"" is just one of the many videos we have for him to watch over and over, and even though he is too young to really learn from the education standpoint, he still appreciates Blue, and all their friends.
The music and cartoon characters all seem to keep his attention, and now that he has been watching for awhile, they are all like old friends.  Blue, Sidetable drawer, mailbox(he loves the mailtime song),and all the other characters they meet in each episode entice him into keeping his eyes on the screen.  I don't think he is a big lover of Steve. Steve comes off as very goofy. He is trying to have fun and be a friend to children, but to me it comes off way too goofy, and I think even my son sees this too.
""Blue's Clues"" itself has been a huge commerical success and the marketing for it amazes me. They have every single toy you can think of. My baby is already being sucked in by the media frenzy!!! eeek!!! Anyway, this is a fun video, and he will have it for a long time as in another year he will really be listening and learning. He does learn now, he picks up words here and there. The overall lessons taught though are far beyond what he can grasp.
Still recommended!!! Toddlers will love the cartoon characters and music..and they will be watching for a few years...

137673,4,0792153677,"My three year old enjoys Blue's Clues.
I particularly find the second segment on this tape the more educational. In the first one, everything in the Blue's Clues environment is labled. However, they mainly do not look at the lable but rather just the first letter of an object. Futher, they get into reading comprehension when most kids are still trying understand what they hear when someone reads a story to them. SO I find the first segment a little bit of a loss educationally.
The second segment, however, deals with numbers and counting. Everything is counted out- number of ice cubes, blue dollars, steps to the door and so on. Great repetition.
I have to admit that Blue's Clues is not my favorite tv show. I find it irritating and do not appreciate the fact that Steve acts so goofy at times. So that may contribute to the lower four rating. However, it's mainly been rated a four due to the first segment being an educational loss in my mind.
I like the fact that it has to sections. This is an easy way to limit the tv/videos that my son watches. I only allow him a limited amount of tv/videos a day and this gives it an easy break point for stopping the video and playing with toys.
Enjoy.",1026777600,7,1201,4.4389140271493215
137674,5,0792153677,"If your toddler or preschooler misses Steve and doesn't want to accept that Joe now lives in Steve's house, well, you'll just have to get some of the videos featuring Steve! This one, ABC's and 123's, is very well done. Children are introduced to letters, words and numbers in the fun, upbeat manner that that has come to be synonomous with Blue's Clues. Join in while Blue challenges Steve to a game of Blue's Clues in each segment. Call out the clues to Steve as you find them (Steve cannot do this on his own you know!). This tape contains two episodes.",1025136000,,556,4.46078431372549
137675,5,0792153677,"Out of all the Blue's Clues tapes we have (9 to 10 of them), this one stands out as one of the best because it teaches the basic, beginning fundamentals of the alphabet and math.  Also, it holds my two-year-old's interest well especially now that he's a little older.  I'm sure going to miss Steve.  Anyway, I'd highly recommend this for any Blue's fan who's just getting into learning numbers and letters.",1012694400,,406,4.611111111111111
137676,5,0792153677,"Hi, This video is our daughters favorite. This one we have purchased a second copy of. We thought videos could not be worn out, especially after we only bought this copy 9 months earlier. This gets watched by our 2 year twice daily EVERY day. From a parents point of view it's a great learning tool for kids and fun with the ""absorbing"" quality that gets kids everytime. How sad it is, that we find ourselves sitting down too and watching it almost daily. This edition is the favorite, as we have 2 others. It covers ABC and 123's and although we have read other reviews with parents saying their 3 year old and under not suitable, we must admit that our 2 year old loves it. I guess every child develops differently and each to their own. One thing is for sure ... it's better than Teletubbies and you actually learn something here with Blue, Steve and the gang!",992304000,12,863,4.4
137677,5,0792153677,This video helped to teach my 3 year to count to 10. He watched it so much that the first one was worn out in three weeks. We love Blues Clues products.,972259200,,152,3.78125
137678,5,0792153677,"Thanks to this video, my 15 month old daughter no longer has any interest in Teletubbies.  Emma was immediately captivated by the First (ABC)  episode.  She took a little time to warm up to the second (123) one.  My  husband and I loved this tape from the start.  And not just because it  replaced Tubbies.  It's highly educational, has great music, and Steve is  an absolute riot!  A must have!",965088000,9,395,4.514285714285714
137679,5,0792153677,"This video is one of my son's favorites!  It really teaches them the alphabet, as well as how to count and even some simple math.  It really keeps my 2 year olds attention, so much so that he really doesn't know that  he is actually learning something while he is watching - thats the magic of  this video.  I thought it was much better than some of his Sesame Street  videos that try to teach the same concepts.  A must-have for your video  library!",953596800,13,450,4.273809523809524

Blues Clues VHS tapes (yes, VHS tapes) are a favorite of my grandson, so I was glad to find this one.",1328227200,,268,4.469387755102041

7791995,5,0792153677,"The ABC part is really a whole language reading lesson. Couple that with Dr. Suess's Hop on Pop and you can teach your kid to read.

The 123 part teaches beginning addition.

Very well done.",1130457600,,190,4.4
7791996,4,0792153677,"The title fooled me I bought this viseo. I bought it for my home daycare. I thought this would video to learn letters and begining count. This video is more advanced than that. It teachs words and begining math. It's a fun and well made video. It's jst not great for 18 to 2 1/2 yr olds. For that age group I'd suggest getting Sesame Street - 123 Count With Me, Sesame Street - The Great Numbers Game, Leap Frog - Letter Factory, & Sesame Street - The Alphabet Jungle Game",1126742400,4,472,4.197802197802198
7791997,5,0792153677,We've had this video for over 5 yrs.  It is now making it's way into our 2nd son's video repetoire.  My oldest absolutely loved Blue when he was 1 and 2 yo.  These videos are helpful in that they teach thinking skills using fun songs and bright colors.  It's no wonder that Blue's Clues is still in production all these years later.,1078531200,,332,4.306451612903226
7791998,4,0792153677,I really love Blues Clues and so does my 4 year old son.  He watches it every day on Playhouse Disney and he learned to count from this video.  i highly reccommend it to anyone!  ...,1051660800,,182,4.0
