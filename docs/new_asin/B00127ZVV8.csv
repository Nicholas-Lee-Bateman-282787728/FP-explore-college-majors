8244683,1,B00127ZVV8,"Whether you know anything about International foxtrot (which I do) or not, you will not learn anything from this video.  Only the first 20 minutes (out of about 50) cover international foxtrot.  The rest is kind of an advertisement for other instructional dance videos they offer -- giving you little snippets of dances ranging from cha cha to Texas two step.  They even make up dances I never heard of.

Even the first 20 minutes of international foxtrot are wasted because they never tell you what step they are doing!  When they put it all together, it sort of looks like a feather step to a left-had turn to a 3-step, but it's hard to tell because the room is so small.

I don't begrudge the Russian accents or the questionable taste in clothes, but I am totally disgusted with the lack of information that this video offers.",1404086400,,829,4.5675675675675675
8244684,2,B00127ZVV8,The instructions were given in a fragmented way. It's difficulty to connect those steps together despite clear instruction on each steps. The instructor should put all the steps in one coherent sequence.,1242604800,,203,5.375
