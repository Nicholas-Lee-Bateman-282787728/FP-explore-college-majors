It's labeled ""Historic Travel US"" when its really a bunch of movies about how to help teenagers learn to grow up and get along with their parents and eventually get jobs. How that relates to travel is anyone's guess, but if you are looking for travel DVDs this is not for you.

On the other hand, the clips, which were obviously made for schools are really, really good and go into a fair amount of detail about problems teenagers face and ways parents can work with them to find good solutions. The films about getting a job are ones I'd like to show to my little brother.",1148428800,,643,4.4033613445378155
8050016,5,B0007P7BHS,"You know, the 1950s must have been a really weird time to grow up in. I've ordered a bunch of these government training films (mostly for the camp value, some are hilarious) and can't believe how steadfast the government was that kids were about to become a huge problem that could be solved by showing them terrifying films.

This one takes a similar, if slightly different tact. As far as I can tell the governement must have been worried that with teh war over kids would get out of high school and just sit at home and mooch of their parents. So, they figured they needed to scare them into the idea that if they didn't get a job they would be scum.

The result is the expected silliness and overblown moral messages that are always good for a laugh.",1146528000,,754,4.378571428571429
