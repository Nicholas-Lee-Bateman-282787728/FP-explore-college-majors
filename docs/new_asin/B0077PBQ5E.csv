The animation is terrible, the acting is boring and unispiring, and the dialogue appears to have been written by a gradeschooler (no offense to gradschoolers).  Actually, the animation looks like it was done by children as well.  I would be ashamed if I was the producer and had my name attached to such a worthless movie.  I spent $1.20 to watch this movie and even that price is highway robbery.  I didn't think movies could get worse than The Last Airbender, until I watched Life's a Jungle.

Maybe if they showed this movie to prisoners, crime rates would go down. This film should only be used as a punishment, nothing else. I pity whoever has had to sit through this almost 2 hour long trainwreck. The animation is absolutely bottom rung. The story makes no sense. The sound and animation don't line up properly.

5061759,2,B0077PBQ5E,"You may notice a pattern of terrible reviews surrounding this film and that's a shame because Phase 4 films is really trying to become a factor in the CG animated feature film world ala Pixar and DreamWorks.  The trouble is films like Life's a Jungle: Africa's Most Wanted really do the animation industry an injustice and it makes sense that people who put down good money for this (even the $1.30 or so renting it from the Redbox would set you back).

The question then becomes how do films like this come to be and what makes them so inferior to the type of entertainment we've come to expect from some of the companies mentioned above?  Read on for a closer look into the process and to determine whether or not this one if right for you.

Life's a Jungle tells the tale of an extremely pampered house dog from England named Pip who goes on tour of Africa with his family.  When a rhino charges their open-roof jeep, Pip gets ejected from the vehicle and takes a poorly animated tumble into the wild of the Serengeti.

The core of the story (and its 85-minute runtime) consists of Pip trying to survive the rough and tumble environment while trying to reunite with his wealthy family.  To be honest, there's potential here.  One can imagine if Sony Image Works or Blue Sky got a hold of this premise, they could probably turn it into something decent.  In fact, a strong argument can be made that a tale not too unlike this has been told through DreamWorks' Madagascar or Disney's The Wild and sadly, told much better in either case.

Though the film was produced in 2012, the visuals do very little to aid in the missed-opportunity factor.  The character models are extremely stiff, the backgrounds flat and simple and the textures appear to have been lifted directly from an early 2000's video game.  In fact, it wouldn't be surprising at all to discover this film was built upon a machinima system (which, in case you are unfamiliar, is the process of using a video game engine to produce animation).

However, a supporter in the idea that pretty visuals do not a good story make, let's for a moment ignore the substandard looks of this work and discuss the bigger flaws at hand.  For starters, the pacing is awful- to the point where the few decent gags contained (like a flashback demonstrating Pip's version of playing fetch meant throwing the stick for his human owners to retrieve) drag out until all of the humor is erased.  In fact the deliberately slow movements of the characters coupled to long gaps without any spoken character dialog makes the entire film feel like a dream sequence.

The jungle itself doesn't exactly present the type of challenges one would expect a domestic (and unbelievably pampered) animal may face as well.  For example many of the wild occupants break out into a game of football where, it appears, an attempt to mock The Matrix with some bullet-time action becomes hopelessly muddled due to the fact that the whole movie runs in what is, for all intents and purposes, slow motion.

The ending attempts a little heartfelt lesson that again, may have been a bit emotional if not for the substandard animation, lifeless acting and pacing that can coax even the most patient viewer among us reach for the fast forward button on the remote.

Director Robert D. Hanna (who apparently also co-wrote the screenplay) was very clearly banking on the notion that younger viewers would find the talking animals angle enduring enough to forgive all of the crimes in animation this movie manages to commit (many of which become apparent in the first minute of the film).

With an estimated budget of around $230,000, one can hope a majority of the funds went to paying the vocal cast which, no exaggeration, consists of 7 individuals as the ambient sounds appear to have been taken directly from royalty-free sound libraries.

In all, it's sad that there is so little redeeming to report about this film.  This represents Prevalent Entertainment Inc.'s second foray into the realm of CG films (the first being the equally despised but slightly more coherent The Prodigy) and it appears as though the high-school project quality has followed them here.

In a way you want these guys to succeed- they are truly the underdogs in what is a multi-billion dollar industry and it is apparent that the company is clearly a passionate group of individuals inspired by the material  coming out of the larger animation houses like Pixar, DreamWorks, Image Works Blue Sky and so on.  But when it comes to parting ways with your hard earned cash (and keeping youngsters entertained for a couple of hours), you are much better off picking up something from the studios that inspire these guys!",1363219200,3,4710,4.73561811505508
5061760,1,B0077PBQ5E,"I watched this with my friend for our weekly movie night, which is a night where I get to take off work, make some nice popcorn and curl up to enjoy a cute, mindless children's film together. It's my one night where I can be happy, and this movie jumped in and pooped all over it.
The dialogue was probably written by an epileptic having a seizure against his keyboard. It makes so little sense that your brain will literally turn itself inside out trying to comprehend it, and the vegetative state you go into will be preferable to watching this movie. If you hold this movie against Stephen Spielberg and make the sign of the cross, he spontaneously combusts and fire shoots out of his eyes.
I would like to burn the movie and fart on the ashes. Actually, that's too dignified. I would burn it, fart on it and then bury it under the graves of the kids who did Columbine. If you think I'm exaggerating, you obviously haven't seen this movie. It's about as useful as a Warhol gallery for blind people, but I'm giving it one star instead of zero because it's easy to snort cocaine off of.",1362700800,4,1087,4.3861386138613865

My 2 year old actually LOVES this movie and calls it 'Dog, Dog, Dog', heaven help me- I've gotta watch enough movies to get this out of my recently watched list so he'll stop seeing it and jumping up and down to see it again (it does help me get dinner done)",1362441600,,577,4.275229357798165

Like, I kept checking to see if the DVD was skipping or glitching because it was so slow. It's like watching a movie in slow motion. Dialogue and plot (lack of?) makes NO sense. Nonsensical. And just weird. Not to mention the terrible lessons it's teaching. Hmm... Bully the cat and pull it's tail. How does the cat deal with the tail pulling? By throwing a baseball into the dog's face.

First up my wife mentioned it was loaded with seriously whacked sexual suggestiveness. I wanted to see if this production company by chance also made hentai porn videos ( check  out the eyes)  and just used the ""acting"" scripts they wrote 12 years ago over on this POS.

secondly- hell there is no second , this movie sucks so bad its makes for a great joke to play on the babysitter, grandma etc

for similar pain -
check out ""just for kicks"" it is a another movie done for kids but was produced by a porn company ( my guess)  who rented out their equipment and  a few actors/ actress even sets in the off chance they could sucker people to rent it.

5061777,1,B0077PBQ5E,"I watched this movie on Netflix with these 3 kids I was babysitting (two 4-year-olds and an 11-year-old boy) and we somehow survived an hour of it-or maybe it was 20 minutes. I have no idea. Those kids asking to watch something else was one of the best parts of my day. When I first saw it I thought ""oh it's one of THOSE movies"" the ones that are badly animated and pretty cheesy. The kind of movies that nobody's ever heard of before. I was sure it was an early 1990s animated movie, made when nobody even knew how to make 3D animations, but after searching for it so I could show my mom how awful it is, I find out that it's a 2012 movie!? I don't see how it's even possible.
Well, normally I could watch badly animated and cheesy movies just to get a laugh. I like watching them sometimes. I also love childrens (and babies) tv shows and movies, and I'm used to baby shows being pretty bad, but this is absolutely terrible. I tried to get into it, I have to watch whatever's on TV, my eyes are drawn to it, and this movie was painful to watch. The animation was not only terrible, but so bad, it was creepy. I can enjoy badly animated films, but the bad animation is just the beginning of the many things wrong with this movie.
The characters- Well, I don't even know their names. They didn't seem to have any backstory or personality. When they're introduced, you're left thinking: ""what just happened? Is this thing important?"" While there are quite a few other creepy things about this movie, the rhinos are the worst. One thing-among many other things- is the fact that they had fingers, and they looked like buff grey men with rhino heads. But that is what most of the characters in this movie looked like.
Another thing that really creeped me out was the baby panther. It just looks creepy and unnatural, and to make it even worse, the sounds it makes are human baby sounds.
The sound effects in this movie are bad and often unfitting with the situation, it seems like the creators had a very limited selection of sound effects to use, which is a bit pathetic. I have found tons of free websites with tons of sound effects I can use in videos. (I've been in a high-school computer animation class for a year and I already think I could do a better job than these people)
I'll admit I chuckled at one or two of the jokes, but even if there is an acceptable joke somewhere, it's ruined with it's bad timing, and the movie's horrid animation.
If there was a story, I didn't follow it at all.

So, the animation is terrible, the writing is terrible, the sound effects are terrible, the character modeling is creepy, this movie is so bad, you can't even watch it just to laugh at it. This movie will give me nightmares tonight. I've seen some pretty bad movies and enjoyed all of them at least a little, but this is by far the worst movie I have ever seen, and I feel like it has made my life slightly worse.",1344988800,3,2913,4.315693430656935

Unfortunately, neither of us could find anything...repeat...ANYTHING...funny, interesting, worthwhile or even ""emotion"" inspiring (except for frustration on my part) about this animated movie.

Life's a Jungle is just a strange, strange film. Textures pop in and out, animation glitches cause characters to stutter as they walk, and the film's soundtrack is permeated by odd noises, like loon calls, and cats that sound like human babies. Combined with the film's meandering pace--characters often stand around, silent, for minutes at a time--the film takes on a tone that's almost impossible to describe.

The film doesn't feel like it was made by ""people."" It doesn't remind me of anything I would come up with, or anything I've seen other people come up with. It feels like it fell out of a tree somewhere, created by a wholly alien intelligence. It's incomprehensible to us. This is not a compliment.

With unlikable characters, an eerie, static, dead world, horrendous sound and animation, a trite, predictable story line, and some of the most baffling and drawn out moments of on screen silence and inactivity ever, Life's a Jungle: Africa's Most Wanted has really earned its place in the pantheon of terrible animation.

5061797,1,B0077PBQ5E,"This is hands down the worst animated movie I have ever seen.

The animation is horrible, dialogue non-existent except for when it's non-sensical, and the sound effects are straight out of a kindercare music class, and not in a good way.  I echo the question posed in earlier reviews - what in the world was Redbox thinking putting this movie in their machines?  Do the Life's a Jungle producers (using the term very loosely here) have incriminating evidence on some Redbox executive???  They must, because this movie brings ""Waste of time and money"" to a new level.

My 7 year old (who likes nearly anything animated, with this flick being the notable exception) and I were back to the Redbox within 20 minutes to return this stinker. I've never been so thrilled at the prospect of a Chipmunks movie as I was tonight when we stuffed this waste of plastic back into the Redbox to get ChipWrecked in return.

Stay away from Life's a Jungle and send a note to Redbox (CoinStar is the parent company) and if you've been unlucky enough to rent it before reading these reviews, tell them what you think of this selection.  There must be something else that could occupy this space in the machine.  I'm thinking a 20-min loop of the emergency broadcast system would be a step in the right direction.",1338595200,12,1293,4.640350877192983
5061798,1,B0077PBQ5E,"Seriously, my daughter who is 8 is currently watching this movie and it's driving me crazy.  It says it's 85 minutes long but feels like a million.  It is so bad it's laughable!  Is this a joke?  Someone tried to create the dumbest movie ever and see if they could trick people into watching it.  Just horrible!!!",1338595200,,313,4.421052631578948
5061799,1,B0077PBQ5E,"I've never in my life seen a movie this bad. It put me in a terrible mood just from watching the first 20 minutes. Even my 3 year old couldn't watch it. There are just no words. I seriously thought I had accidentally ordered a video game as there were such long stretches with nothing happening at first (and through out), I thought I was supposed to be doing something with the remote to make things happen with the movie. Forget making this on a PC or Mac, I think I could make something with better CGI on my iphone in less than a day.

There are some movies that are so bad, they are awesome to watch and you can have fun with it. Like some Bravo show or something. Well this is NOT that. Both my wife and I were just angry from watching this. Nothing in my life ever made me hate my kids as much as this movie. You think I'm exaggerating, but in all honest, this review barely touches on how horrible this movie is.",1338595200,,920,4.111111111111111
5061800,1,B0077PBQ5E,I'm sorry I spent 1.98 to rent this movie.  My children and I watched the first 5 minutes and realized this was the worst made movie we have ever seen.  I was angry that anyone was allowed to sell a movie with such bad quality.  Don't waste your money on a rental.,1338336000,,264,4.038461538461538
5061801,1,B0077PBQ5E,this is what you call complete b.s. as in that is even an understatement. whoever made this should seriously consider another job like any job at all. i mean seriously it is simply horrible. whoever wrote the script did horribly. whoever did the animation messed the entire thing up. i mean the snow looks like dough and just cut the crap with the excessive music. it looks like a messed up video game. and i'm pretty sure alligator don't snap their jaws like that. i mean i had to watch this with my nephews and i seriously considered breaking the tv. i mean it. it IS that BAD. Don't let the pack deceive you!!!!!!!!!,1338336000,,619,4.43859649122807
5061802,1,B0077PBQ5E,"I can't even begin to describe how awful every aspect of this movie is. We got it from red box because it looked like a cute movie for the kids. The animation is terrible, the music and sound is terrible, there is no plot, and there are huge gaps where nothing is even happening. Everyone involved with the release and distribution of this crap should be ashamed of themselves.",1338076800,,377,4.478260869565218

8511794,1,B0077PBQ5E,"Overall quality was no good...from the animation, to story line, to acting/voice overs. My 4 year old watched for 10 minutes and he even agreed this movie was ""silly"" and not worth the time.",1479168000,,190,4.617647058823529
