I watched it again the other day and the scene where the main character meets his antagonist was so hilarious I was crying from laughter.  This movie is funny, disturbing, odd, thought-provoking, and still pertinent 20 years later.

I love this movie.  It's truly a favorite.",1360713600,2,359,4.634920634920635

I had not seen this movie in years and just had to have it on DVD. I had forgotten actually just how funny it was. This movie is totally off the wall in a manner of speaking here. And expect the unexpected at all times when viewing. Would I recommend this movie to the masses? Probably not because like I said here if you do not like dry British humor this movie is not for you. If you are a fan of the late Benny Hill or Monty Python than you will like this for sure. For me, I give it 5 stars across the board.",1349308800,4,681,3.9420289855072466
826162,5,6304282621,"A comedy of morals set in the world of advertising.
Despite being fully aware that it's a send-up, the naked truth of some of the dialogue helped blow away the last shards of advertising credibility for me.
""Let me try and clarify some of this for you.
Best company supermarkets are not interested in selling wholesome foods. They are not worried about the Nation's health. What is concerning them is that the nation appears to be getting worried about it's health. That is what is worrying Bestco, because Bestco want to carry on selling them what it always has, i.e. white bread, baked beans, canned foods, and that supperating, grease-squirting heart attack traditionally known as 'the British sausage.
So... How can we help them with that?
Clearly we are looking for a label' . We need a label that is brimming with health - and everything from the 'Nosh-Pot' to white bread will wear it with pride....""

The construction of the Movie is the thing that always impresses me, the way it totally makes sense within it's own twisted logic. If here's one criticism I have then it's the limited scope: there's not really anything that doesn't relate to the main plot. Some viewers might also be looking for an external conflict, an exciting conclusion, when really this is a story about metamorphosis.
Reservations stated, it's still so original that it deserves all the the glowing plaudits it gets.

p.s. What are some of the * and ** reviewers looking for? A Mercedes Benz being blown up? A gunfight? Some comedy pratfalls at a golf club? A love story? The beauty of this piece is that it doesn't fit into any satirizable genre.
and whoever posted  - ""John Cleese plays dual roles"" - thank you (whispered aside) I don't know what you were watching, but he's not actually in the movie....",1331856000,2,1788,4.742765273311897
826163,2,6304282621,"My friend and I rented this thing ages ago after I heard about it on a local radio show from a caller who said it was the funniest film he had ever seen.

Richard E. Grant plays dual roles in a film that does little to nothing to entertain.  It's a parable about what you need to get ahead in the cut throat world of advertising.

Not a film I'd recommend, simply for the fact that the humor is predictable and unfunny.

If you must rent it, then stream it for free.

Don't say I din't warn you.",1328659200,,495,4.010204081632653
826164,4,6304282621,"I've seen Richard E. Grant in Henry & June as well as The Player.
These were both roles in which he indulged in heavy drama, and did
very well in both.
  How to Get Ahead in Advertising is the first time I've seen Grant as
a comedic player, and I laughed until I fell off the couch. His paranoid,
bug-eyed antics and gestures are unparalleled; considering how he
verbally abuses his female consumer base, the huge boil mocking him
in the mirror is a fitting revenge. Watch and enjoy!",1325462400,,483,4.415730337078652

826326,3,6304282621,"This film is one long fantasy indictment of the advertising industry.  Sure, as a profession, they do a lot of weird and ridiculous things, so I don't mean to defend it.  But to base a whole movie on it?  After a while, it is simply over the top.  I saw this to see what Grant could do after the incomparable Withnail and I, one of the best black comedies I have ever seen.

Grant plays an ad man who is burnt out.  Cynical and drinking way too much, he is at that point in his career when he can find something new or plod ahead in a well worn track.  He wants to quit, but another part of himself wants to become the essence of the emptiness he perceives at the heart of the profession, manifesting itself in a pretty crude symbolism that I don't want to give away.  It is OK and Grant is at times very funny, but he can't make a mediocre and limited script into a great film.

Recommended tepidly.",1305072000,,900,4.126436781609195
826327,5,6304282621,"What a clever little movie. Bruce Robinson takes a Cronenbergian approach to his script that is just as funny as Withnail and I. The movie pokes fun of capitalism, marketing, hypocrisy, and even ends with a most convincing speech that almost seems to come from a war movie. Just the thought of boils makes me ill to my stomach. And the boil that Richard E. Grant grows has a mind of it's own, and also a mustache. Grant gives two high energy performances, he seconds as the grotesque pustule. At first the movie seems to pick sides saying that capitalism is bad, but by the end we realize that we need Walmart as much as Walmart needs us. We've started a sad and repetitive cycle of mass consumerism, and there is no foreseeable conclusion.

826329,4,6304282621,"""Greed has installed its lackeys into the highest offices of this land, and they're conducting a crime wave of unprecedented ferocity.  Anywhere you want to look they're at it.  Oil companies sold as champions of the environment.  Wild animals prancing through the woodlands.  Meanwhile the filth from their cars is wiping out half the forests of Europe...

""I beleive you were about to explain why hamburgers are going to be the cause of World War III..""

""That's right you cynical b@stard... Destruction of the rainforest by hamburgers is going to lead to a world crisis, and the commodity will be oxygen...""

This is kind of an interesting film for any who have argued with inner demons (and who hasn't?).  It's significant due to the particular demon (or boil in this case) which this man is dealing with.  That 'demon' is the ugly head of manipulative advertising and greed which this film hilariously, though in no uncertain terms, condemns.  It is a watchable film and gets funnier as it progresses.  Funny, but not without its grains of morbid truth, which is why on the level of significance and in terms of the caliber of it's script, acting and cinematography it's a 5-star feature (and deserves Criterion treatment).  While I did find myself laughing a good number of times at the absurdity of some of the situations, I have seen funnier and more entertaining movies.  Still it is a high caliber production of one of the more over-the-top and original of black humor films, and with a message that seems to be gaining more attention even now some 20 plus years after this was made in 1988 (see ""The Joneses"", or ""The Corporation""). Besides being a condemnation of marketing's shady techniques, it lambasts our beloved television as well (for another movie that did that well see ""Network"").  I'd give ""How To Get A Head.."" two thumbs up to the right audience. It's well worth seeing.",1288051200,,1937,4.812688821752266
826330,5,6304282621,"Imagine a world where corporations pay lots of money to men who in turn advertise their products by deceiving and manipulating people. In the city where I live alongside every major street or highway are so many billboards they crowd out the sky. Privately owned television stations run almost as many ads as they do programming, and even then the programming is often just another form of advertisement. History, art, and genuine cultural expressions are appropriated to sell products or ""entertainment"", i.e. profit-based fun. Game shows promote and exploit greed. People are turned into consumers. Culture(or lack of it) is manufactured, identities can be bought in malls, and ideologies become bumper stickers. Anything meaningful is transformed into an accessory with a price tag, and if it can't be sold is discarded. This movie is not a fairy tale that will make you feel secure, and it doesn't come with a happy ending to comfort you. Instead it strips that fantasy of it's glossy image and tells you that reality is not a commodity to be owned, it tells you that it's the way we interact with the world that makes us who we are, and that if it's just about keeping it all for yourself then it's a very shallow existence. It encourages us to examine the way in which a profit-based economy and consumerist mindset dictate the way we live, and how the freedom to choose between products is not the same as freedom. In doing so it gives you something much more meaningful that can't be made into a possession, and it does so in a way that is sincere, funny, and powerful. But it's not without hope, it makes clear that rejection of greed-driven philosophy can allow us to pursue a vision of a ""better"" world.",1253318400,,1714,4.735785953177258

826332,5,6304282621,"This movie is a riot. Richard E Grant gives an amazingly intense performance. His entire role seems to consist of nothing but brilliantly scabrous monologues. His acerbic take on everything around him starts at a fever pitch and then giddily topples over into outright inspired lunacy. See this film if for no other reason than to get a glimpse of him naked save for a kitchen apron, gleefully stuffing raw chickens down the toilet drain and all the while explaining, "" Everything I do makes sense, everything i do has a reason!""

I prefer this style of over the top attack much more than the drier and more subtle (!) mode employed by both writer-director Bruce Robinson and Richard E. Grant in their first collaboration, WITHNAIL & I.

The heights of comic outlandishness achieved in HOW TO GET AHEAD IN ADVERTISING is something that is rarely achieved by any film and it is doubly commendable that everything done here ( no matter how tastelessly crazy) still never stoops to the childishly vulgar levels that most American comedies regularly splash about in like mental asylum inmates happily playing with their own feces. Yes, despite everything this film attempts ( and achieves) it still retains a sense of sophistication that shows what thuddingly awful garbage ( i am looking directly at you AUSTIN POWERS, SCARY MOVIE, etc, etc) is usually regarded as the height of comedy.

826457,5,6304282621,"HOW TO GET AHEAD IN ADVERTISING is a wonderfully over-the-top piece of hilarious satire.  The always entertaining Richard E. Grant plays a stressed-out advertising executive who finally snaps and begins arguing with a head that conveniently grows out of his shoulder.  As this was written and directed by Bruce Robinson (the same man behind WITHNAIL & I) you can be sure that every line of dialogue sounds like obscene poetry and Grant delivers each of these with exactly the right amount of pure manic energy.
The humor present here is very dark, and at times could be described as disturbing, so this may not be for everyone's tastes.  Obviously, a comedy that centers around an ordinary man accidentally growing a second head isn't going to be something that's geared towards everyone's liking, but if you enjoy off-beat humour and outrageous satire, then this is probably something that will delight you.  There's certainly a lot to recommend: the acting is wonderful, the direction is very assured and the writing sparkles.  This is one of the few films in which it is almost impossible to predict what will be happening next.  Sharply critical of advertising, capitalism, industry, commerce, and half a dozen other subjects, this is something that will make you think in the few moments when it isn't making you laugh.

Rachel Ward is his supportive wife.  But her love is not enough to stave off his breakdown.  Grant snaps, quits his job and finally, slowly loses his sanity when a small pimple on his neck becomes another head that eventually takes over his life. A head that only he -- and we -- can see.  This is a ferocious film of extremes that skewers our narcissistic, media-driven culture. Recommended.",996710400,2,694,4.75
826459,3,6304282621,"Nothing exciting about this Criterion release : english subtitles, liner notes and a theatrical trailer, that's all. It seems that the HOW TO GET AHEAD IN ADVERTISING DVD release was Criterion price to pay to Handmade Films in order to be allowed to release Bruce Robinson's first movie, the cult classic WITHNAIL AND I. Holy Mysteries of the movie deals !
HOW TO GET AHEAD IN ADVERTISING is not a bad movie, it has even great moments principally due to the terrific performance of Richard E. Grant as Bagley, a young talented executive in the advertising business. Suffering from a nervous breakdown turning soon into schizophreny, Bagley develops a strange boil hiding an alter ego willing to take his place. This horror movie clich, with the usual special effects involved, gives director Bruce Robinson the opportunity to develop certain ideas about the world we live in. Television, advertised products, show-business have little by little killed our critical sense. We don't know anymore the difference between reality and the lies we have to absorb all day long from our TV sets. These are interesting themes but the satire, in my opinion, often falls short and doesn't have the acuity required by this peculiar genre.

Too bad this isn't as well known a film as it should be but with a beautiful DVD that only Criterion can make maybe more will experience this beauty of a film?

826462,5,6304282621,"Richard E. Grant as Bagley brings to the film both his best and most outrageous performance.  As the slick advertising salesman, Bagley is the cold-hearted business man who would see his own mother lose all her teeth  if he thought it would sell more denture cream.  The brilliant opening  scene has him announcing that we want to sell them 30% less [of fat] and  20% more [of nutrition]; they are selling an image and idea, not a product!  Bagley begins to second guess his profession and when the idea of having  to come up with a boil cream begins to make his conscience ill, he opts to  quit in pursuit of higher ideals.
It is then, that the supernatural takes  over, and Bagley gets a boil on his neck that he believes has begun to turn  into a face, causing him to go utterly insane to the horror of his wife who  sees nothing but the boil.  The insanity multiplies and the boil becomes  Bagley's evil advertising alter-ego, and the insanity delves into the  depths of all that is great in British black humour.
The boil-alter-ego  finally takes over the reformed Bagley identity, and Bagley becomes much  worse than he'd ever been.
The script is poignant, if not a little bit  preachy on the evils of advertising.  But Richard E. Grant gives his heart  and soul to make the character fully dimensional and incredibly funny.  His  insanity is put in perfect perspective by his wife, played sublimely by  Rachel Ward, who is as supportive and understanding as she can to a husband  who seems to have gone over the brink.
For the originality, commentary,  wittiness, acting, quotable dialogue, and pure insanity, this has been one  of my favourite movies ever.  It's no Citizen Kane (do people really like  that movie, anyway! ), but it is without a doubt a must-see, just for the  experience!",957657600,14,1797,4.6369426751592355
