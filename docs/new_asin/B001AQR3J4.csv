I ordered this bluray season twice, the first time it arrived in 2010 some of the later episodes would skip and the case it came in was broken.  I figured it was a fluke but I sent it back for a refund.  I tried ordering it again in 2014 and all the episodes played but the case was still broken.  I decided to keep it since the episodes did play and order a blank case for it later.  I ordered one blank case but it was too thick for the sleeve, the sleeve holds a 15mm case but I got a 21mm, I wasn't paying attention then.  I recently got a blank case the right size.  Amazon doesn't sell the cases individually, only in packs of 5.  I made the mistake of ordering cases to hold 6 discs instead of 5.  Oh well, all the discs fit and the case fits in the sleeve.

But I enjoyed the show when it was on and was disappointed when it was dropped in Season 2.  The Season 2 cliffhanger was extraordinary and was apparently written by writers who knew the series was concluding and wanted to usher in the beginning of The Resistance headed by Sarah Connor's son John.  It answered very few questions and created many in the minds of fans who, of course, were left to ponder over meanings of several key aspects of the story indefinitely since Episode 22 was the final one in the series.  All in all a pretty decent series with weak performances from Dekker and Headey held together by the strong performances of Summer Glau.",1473638400,2,772,4.696296296296296

3458019,5,B001AQR3J4,"Why did they have to cancel this show? Why??

I mean, you've got Summer Glau in the role of a Terminator. Who better? And Lena Hedley as Sarah Connor? Super amazing.

This is one of those female-driven shows that made me so happy. I have been a fan of the Terminator franchise since I was faaaaar too young to have any business watching them (3... 4 maybe?). The series starts after the events of Terminator 2, forgetting T3 and those other horrid sequels that we shall not speak of.

And then? AT THE END OF THIS SEASON... HOW COULD THEY?! HOW?? Serious plot twist cliff-hanger. Oh my god, it still angers me.

I so wish they would have renewed for Season 3, even though we may have been out our Cersei for a little longer. I cannot imagine anyone else playing Cersei at this point but... darn it! She was Sarah first, in my mind, and I loved it. Loved her. Loved the whole thing.

Even though it was a cancelled series, I still highly recommend watching it, especially if you're a fan in any way of the Terminator franchise. The story line is excellent, engaging, and suspenseful. For the time in which it was released, it was beyond amazing. I own both seasons on DVD and will upgrade to Bluray when I can because it is JUST THAT GOOD.",1460851200,,1238,4.3652173913043475
3458020,4,B001AQR3J4,"The show is what it is - cheap entertainment. Be forewarned that the packing is one of those triple page frankenstein mechanisms and it arrived with the inner parts smashed to smithereens. I bought a box of ten six-disk DVD cases from Amazon for around sixteen bucks so that I could replace this (and every other similarly shattered case) with a few to spare.
Re: Terminator TSCC  counting all iterations, there have been five John Connors, three Sarah Connors (who of whom are both queens on Game of Thrones) and three Kyle Reeses. No doubt, there will be many more to come.",1459123200,3,575,4.637254901960785

When I opened the case---the 6 disks came flying out along with the thing that's supposed to hold them all in place.  I mean, honestly...what the hell happened to the case---did your shipping crew kick it about like a soccer ball???
The case is ruined & now I have to find 6 separate cases to hold them.  And I pay the NEW PRICE for this.
I WANT SOME LOVE FROM AMAZON FOR THIS COLOSSAL SCREW-UP!!!  I did not pay nearly $13.00 for 6 loose disks and a pile of shattered plastic bits---and since I pay $9.99 a month ($120.00 a year) for Prime--mostly for the FREE SHIPPING.  I am not paying like $5.00 or more to ship it back for a refund.
I spend A LOT at Amazon---hundreds and hundreds--if not a few thousand by now--on your products and this is the 1st time I have ever asked for a  refund that didn't involve a package not being delivered.
 As far as the content---I can only hope the disks themselves aren't damaged.  I really enjoyed the Sarah Connor Chronicles when they were on TV.  In many ways,Lena Headey was much better as the role of Sarah Connor than Linda Hamilton.  Lena showed us a  more warrior side of Sarah Connor at a critical time in John Connor's life.",1458864000,2,1326,4.323886639676114

3458023,5,B001AQR3J4,"When Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles came out on television, I was immediately intrigued. I did not know what to expect with it being a Terminator television series rather than a movie. It starred Lena Headey, Summer Glau, Thomas Dekker and Brian Austin Green. It aired on FOX.

In the year 1995, at the end of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Sarah Connor, her son John and the 800-series Terminator successfully destroy the T-1000, as well as the arm and CPU chip from the Terminator sent back to 1984 in the first film. The T-800 from the second film, at its own request, is then also destroyed to eliminate any future technology that could be used to create Skynet through reverse engineering. Despite this, at the beginning of the television series, a T-888 using the name ""Cromartie"" is sent back to 1999 to kill John. ""Cameron"", a Terminator that John sent back from 2029 to protect his younger self, leaps forward in time with John and Sarah to the year 2007 in order to prevent a delayed Judgement Day once and for all. Now wanted fugitives with the fear of pending leukemia playing on Sarah's mind, they must also face the reality that other enemies from the future could be after them.

The show at times seemed great and interesting. But at other times, it was very predictable. You knew nothing was going to happen to the stars of the show at episodes end most likely. That makes it hard to imagine the worst to becoming the worst. In a movie, anything can happen. And, characters die.

Summer Glau does play her character as a Terminator as well as can be. I enjoyed how she carried her character amd portrayed being a Terminator. When she is fighting a larger Terminator can be a bit unbelievable at times not being defeated more easily.

Lena Headey was okay as Sarah Connor. But, the title of the show made it seem like she was the main and most important character of the show when she was really not in the episodes. I understand it was a show about what she experienced, but one would thing she would be the main character all episodes centered around and it was not the case.

I was not very interested in Thomas Dekker playing John Connor. But, the John Connor character is hard to pinpoint how he should be portrayed being the potential future hero and leader of the resistance. But, I still did like the show very much. It was very interesting filling in the timeline, and seeing what and how the writers would continue forward in the series.

Terminator is a very good franchise, and any media regarding it is interesting.

I recommend Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. I liked that much of it. I wanted to see how the series would move forward to make sense in the Terminator universe.

The Show: The show was will done, a bit slow in its first season, and hobbled by the writes strike of that year. So when season 2 rolled around I watched what I could when I could. The story was well done, the choices of music throughout are great and really set the tone, the version of Samson And Delilah is one of my favorites, as expected of Bear McCreary. The season proved that they could make a compelling and provoking show out of a hit movie series. Summer Glau was excellent as always, and paired with a solid performance from Thomas Dekker, and rounded off by great jobs from Lena Headey , Brian Austin Green, Garret Dillahunt, Richard T. Jones, and a pretty solid is she/isn't she performance from Shirley Manson the show was a solid, if not great show. Unfortunately while getting big money and backing from FOX, it also suffered the FOX curse to sci-fi shows, it gets cancelled quickly of it isn't X-Files.  The Packaging: It comes in a standard for 20+ episode TV series bluray case. All but discs 1 with 4 episodes, and disc 5 with 3, come packed with 5 episodes, counting for 22 episodes. Disc 5 is explained away s having majority of the extras like interviews. All discs come with cherry picked episodes with a commentary option, and cherry picked ""Terminated"" scenes, and one disc has the Cam v Rosie fight rehearsal. Luckily there is a guide to tell you what is where. The case itself is study enough, the thicker case design rather than what you would find on say, the Resident Evil cases. This was also the last season, as per upcoming release of Terminator  Salvation, FOX decided either fans were to dumb, or the story to complex, and felt that people would get confused over two differing timelines. In a Terminator series, based on changing and shifting timelines........... You get my point. Unfortunately because of that the ending and ultimately the show overall suffers as yet another show sets up for the next season, and never followed through as they get canceled.",1453766400,,2173,4.595360824742268

Review (c) Copyright 2015 Vincent Frank De Benedetto

Introduction

This is, for me, a quick-and-dirty review of the series, as time constraints preclude anything else. Warning: spoilers throughout. Summer Glau, special offer for you, below, in Conclusion section.

I'm a die-hard fan of the Terminator franchise, but upon just watching the Season 2 T:SCC premiere, even I am starting to see why the series was canceled. Here are my thoughts:

- Essentially the entire first season was excellent. I watched every episode. Groundbreaking television and great entertainment for Terminator fans (though I think that car-bombing Cameron so early in the series, potentially causing such grievous injury or even her death, was premature).

- Of Season 2, I have so far watched only its Premiere. But I'm penning this review because that premiere struck me rather negatively. It seem that things are starting to get explicitly stupid.

- For example:  there is little question but that John should have killed Cameron, as her mother and uncle aggressively urged him to do, when it became clear that Cameron was fatally malfunctioning. This whole, John I love you and you love me, from Cameron, and I need her! from John were patently ridiculous. Yes, of course one would have, and should have, presumed that the Terminator was likely fabricating, and yes, of course, we know that John on some level knew or suspected itbut the bottom line is he didn't kill her.

He took a huge chance in permitting it to live. A chance that maybe he didn't have the right to take.

- And whats arguably worse is, since Cameron apparently *was* repaired, and did *not* kill John, we have to assume that all or some of what she said whilst pleading for her life was true. So what does this mean? We find that our female Terminator has now exceeded the sum of her programming and is actually in love with a human (ala, The Doctor in Star Trek: Voyager)? Perhaps even more than this. Insofar as Cameron is highly perceptive and intelligent, is she perceiving, perhaps correctly, that John, a human--not to mention the leader of the resistance *against* these beings--is in love with *her*?

Hey, never say never, but this surely does stray quite far afield from what we know, love, and generally expect from this franchise.

- The Cameron almost-death scene in which much of this misguided cybernetic passion play takes place, where shes lodged between two trucks and begs for her life presents yet another problem with the Terminator franchisewhich this series exploits, instead of relegates: Terminators with simply too much humanity. Too much emotion. Too much human facial expression, etc. I don't care how advanced these things are, they are fundamentally glorified *robots.* And by the way how does *software,* which is what SkyNet is ultimately found to be, design and build these cyborgs? Or, OK, how did it originally build the factories that built them?

- Anyway, too much emotion, pleading, bulging eyes and human existential angst at the prospect of death, Cameron does it, and the T-X so-called Terminatrix did it upon the moment of her death, as well, in that Terminator travesty called Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. During the pleading, Camerons eyes just look too human, they should have thrown something into the eyes, or eye sockets, or something, to remind us that this is a machine being, not a human. How about the blue eyeballs, even, that we see during the opening of each episode? Even that would have worked.

This flaw, at that moment, combined with the instant-erection producing looks of actress Summer Glau, playing the role, make it very clear in one fell swoop that this is a killer-hot, young, human actress, no way a cyborg.

- Additionally, in pleading for her life Cameron tells John that she is fixed now, no longer fatally damaged. Yet, what was it, about 60 seconds earlier that she flung a large wrench through the front windshield of the truck, right at John, in an obvious attempt to injure or kill him? She did her self-test, *and* was somehow repaired in that single minute? Generally implausible.

(Yes, yes, OK, sure, maybe she was in a constant state of self-diagnosis and repair and in fact did come fully back to her proper programming in the space of mere seconds. But while viewers are watching they're not necessarily analyzingthey're *watching.* Watching and thinking, especially deep thinking, are two decidedly different activities.)

- One more point, to this end: again, in the scene where Cameron is lodged between two huge, heavy-duty trucks and is about to be terminated, herself, by John, she pleads for her life. OK, her existence. But her pleadingSummer, great actingis so lifelike, so painful, that its actually painful, and for me anyway, too painful, to watch. I don't think were necessarily looking for this apparently just-about real-life portrayal of human painespecially the pain of someone who is about to be murdered, genuinely begging for their lives. Anyone who has seen actual war footage, say, knows precisely what I'm talking about. So the series, you might say, wasn't real enough in certain respects (a believable Terminator), but was too-real in others, e.g. the imminent death of that character.

- Cmon, *another* female Terminator? And another *hot* female Terminator? In fact, if you count Catherine Weaver, the chick in white introduced in Season 2, we now have three female Terminators. Hell, one more and we can film their robotic chats and call it The View.

This is just too much. And by the way, one of my chief criticisms of T3 was, OK, if you're gonna have a female Terminator do NOT make her look like a fashion model, right down to her stiletto-heeled boots. In watching T3 I can never figure out if I should be afraid of the TXor turned on by her.

Which categorically means, of course, that the filmmakers failed.

Especially in a Terminator film where the stock-in-trade must be *fear.* Fear. Not comedy or something too akin to it, Mr. Elton John Glasses, not sex, Miss incredibly hot Kristanna Loken, but *fear.* Im not blaming Miss Loken; she was offered a killer, classic, essentially plum role and she took it. Regarding the glasses, if Arnie was on board with it, the producer/director/executive producer, somebody along the chain of command should have had the good sense and acquaintance with the Terminator franchise to deep-six the idea.

So even with Ms. Glaus certainly reasonable acting attempts to somehow represent herself not as a wide-eyed, pouty-lipped, daisy-duked, little-girl talking and emoting, skinny-sexy young-figured vulnerable teen, killer-hot d*** stiffener, but as a cold, mechanical, robotic, programming-driven cyborg, oh, right, cybernetic organism--it just really didnt, and probably couldnt, happen, at least not completely. Because no matter how good Ms. Glaus acting skill, nature will always get the last word, and for Ms. Glau nature was, as Andy Griffith said to a young, comely Barbara Eden-based character on TV many years ago, Nature was *real* good to you!

Moreover, how could this Terminator have even had anything remotely resembling the standard Terminator-sized endoskeletal chassis underneath or inside her? Shes so skinny (sorry, Summer:  thin) Those endoskeletons are usually rather hulking, man!

Follow the Money

Of course, we have to consider the possibility that the powers-that-be making this series *wanted* Miss Glau to look like that, after all, she was supposed to be a high-school student, right? Nonsense. They could have still made her a buttoned-up, more or less asexual Terminator. They deliberately wanted her to look hot to attract viewersplain and simple. Same with Kristanna Loken, same with Jeri Ryan on Star Trek: Voyager. Younguns, learn now that in the end its not about cinema, or artistic integrity, or even pleasing the true/hardcore fans. Its all about *capitalism,* which means its about earning *profit* for owners, *maximum* profit (in this case the owners of the TV production studios and/or TV networks), which means its about attracting as much advertiser revenue as possible, which means its about attracting not merely a *lot* of eyeballs to the screen to watch those great TV commercials and buy the products, but a real, real, real, REAL lot of eyeballsand if you dont, doesnt matter how good the product is, in this case the product is this television seriesit will be gone, in search of an even more popular product. For more eyeballs, more watching of TV commercials, which persuades advertisers making those commercials to pay even higher advertising rates, which brings in even more profit to the owners.

This is how the world works, boys and girls. Is this information relevant to a review of a TV show? Of course. Its not only directly relevant but its likely the most relevant thing you can discuss. Why? Because its the element of show creation and production that has the biggest bearing on everything that happenswith casting, story lines, budgeting, air times and dates, justeverything. Including, BTW, whether the show even stays on the air. Or maybe, even in the case of a generally excellent, top-notch show like T:SCC, gets canceled after just two seasons. Production for profit skews every part of our human existenceevery part.

Hey, Buds and Babes:  want to meet the *real* Terminators? We just didthey cancelled our show.

(Yes, you are permitted a moment to shed a tear. Because running the world this way *is* sad, not to mention illogical morally and economically. Now wipe your tear, pick up your copy of The Sane Society by Erich Fromm, and lets change things.)

Obviously they wanted Summer for her sex appeal; which is fine by me, hey, as the Woody Allen character of CW Briggs in Curse of the Jade Scorpion asserts, I eat Wheaties! But Id have preferred bringing Summer on as maybe Johns temporary love interest, and leave the terminating to an innately more intimidating actor, preferably a male. Ive always thought that if you're gonna have a female Terminator, she pretty much has to look like either of the female murderer characters in Monster, played by Charlize Theron and Christina Riccior forget it. Basically a chubby, ill-dressed, murderous dyke who hasn't showered in about two weeks.

(Note to censors: dyke is not a politically incorrect word. Lesbian women use it all the time.)

In any case, my little politico-economic explanation aside, I think theres maybe a bit better chance that well catch Pope Francis at a strip club, than fully accept Summer Glau as a Terminator. Even as I write this review, I think of Summer Glau not as I might think of any of the male terminators, like Hey, get me away from *that* guy, but more like, Hey, get me more of this chickpreferably naked. Shes just too hot.

- Another problem the show causes, seen in the character of Weaver, is again, just too human. This chick is walking, talking, conversing, looking, moving, like 1000% human beingwhich again, means the producers failed. Too prettied-up, how long does this TX spend on her hair and makeup in the morning? Yes, of course I know that the hair and makeup appear instantly and automatically given her TX status, but while you're watching the show you're not really deconstructing or analyzing things out like that. Shes just not credible.

More realistic human = more effective infiltration? Yes, I buy it in concept but somehow onscreen it just doesnt work. Maybe because of the other flaws I see.

- Now lets get to the real meat of the matter. Even if none of the aforementioned flaws did not exist. Even if the series was perfectand maybe being perfect would make the following point even more true:

Welcome to the Desert of the Real

I think that too much Terminator just gets depressing. Same thought process, I guess, regarding why I don't really watch mob movies (Goodfellas, Casino, etc) much anymore. Too depressing. The realities they portray are simply, for me, too ugly. Call me sensitive. Or, just call me somebody with my eyes open: in this day and age of ISIS, an uber-terrorist group that is moving rapidly around the globe spreading all manner of real-life termination activity, i.e. murder and mayhem, heavy on the murder, the most grisly and unspeakable kinds of murders, my state of mind is already taking a pretty big hit psychologicallyyours too, if youve been closely following the activities of ISIS.

The products of artistic creation, including film, are always a product of, and influenced by, real world events. So even for me, a huge Terminator fan, two hours of big-screen robot apocalypse works. Season after season of itmaybe not so much. The production flaws cited above probably just make it worse, as they diminish the entertainment value.

Conclusion

All of this kind of came together in my head last night as I watched the Season 2 opener. Hope everyone found these remarks interesting, thought-provoking, and helpful. For more of my writing and thinking, read my other reviews or better yet, see my Amazon.com user name.

Terminator franchise powers-that-be: bring me on next time as a consultant, would you? Lets interject a sizeable further shot of intelligence into the franchise at this point.

Summer:  email me. Sincerely: I want to take you to a museum, dinner, and a movie or concert. Your choice of all.

UPDATE

Upon watching a bit more of Season 2 I offer the following thoughts:

- The plotline is becoming far too complicated, introducing far too many new  characters. In my opinion, the show should have done more with Agent Ellison and the existing roster of Connor-clan enemies and friends, rather than retaining these characters while dumping another small boatload of new characters in our laps, starting with Catherine Yes, Im a Terminator, too, but youd never know it Weaver.

I also find this particular character somewhat annoying: her Scottish accent is a bit hard to negotiate, her rather stark overall look is a bit harsh on the eyes, and in terms of her personality, she obviously doesnt do warm and fuzzy.

To the point, however, how do we keep track of all these new characters and sub-plots? In many spheres of life, an increase in quantity often means a decrease in quality. As a suggestion for an alternative, for example, the show could have kept Agent Ellison from finding out the truth so soon, because once he did he was no longer a foe of Sarah and no longer pursuing her. Instead of this, the show could have tracked a lot of mileage from an intensive, hair-raising Ellison/FBI cat-and-mouse pursuit of Sarah and her crew. I think that we could have easily gotten a fruitful season out of that, avoiding the need to import another rowboat full of new characters and subplots.

In my opinion, theres just too much going on to keep track of, and to comprise the basis for the development of any particular really compelling substantive subplot thread.

This was a key flaw in the Terminator movies, as well, T3 and T4, specifically. Instead of the slow-and-steady wins the race of the first two movies, which tossed us about like a dinghy on a stormy ocean between slow nail-munching and outright cardiac arrest, these two movies de-emphasized character development and slow, building action and drama in favor of big, fast special effects and bombastic action. Why, for example, was there a no-holds-barred car and truck chase in Terminator 3 not ten minutes into the movie and the plot? Very cool chase, yes, but positioned far too early in the movie.

Star Trek: NG made a similar mistake in its movie First Contact. Not two minutes into the movie and were already thrust into a major human-borg battle, as if we were thirty minutes into the film. Very impatient, unprofessional, and somewhat profligate filmmaking. Theres still something to be said for the three-act structure of drama commonly attributed to Aristotle, whereby the plot thickens in act two and major climaxes occur in the third and final act.

- Alright, back explicitly to T:SCC: Season 1 ended with Cameron the victim of a planted bomb. At the start of Season 2 Cameron we find her damaged, and it becomes clear that though she survived, there will be residual damage.

In now witnessing a partially damaged, and consequently somewhat less cybernetically cocksure Cameron, I'm beginning to feel sorry for this being. One can choose sympathy towardalright, I'll elect for the personal pronoun and call this being herone can choose sympathy toward *her* even before her damage, as one might feel pity for a bright puppy. Bright, and thus better able to understand and survive in the human world relative to a pup of lesser intellect, with and among humans, but a puppy nonetheless, and so a being of a kind that will always be apart from most of the other beings around it, which is usually to say, humans.

Cameron is such a being. Why? Because her behavior suggests it; apparently nave, innocent, and vulnerable, her physical skill and capacity and advanced cognition notwithstanding. Whether her reprogramming by the Resistance, or original programming by the Terminata that likely inserted into her blank template of simulacrum the personality profile of a nave teen or even young child, even in her original fully operational condition she seems a bit lost. Her power permits successful assistance to humans in peril, but ironically she may be powerless to escape her own existential peril, that is, to become something other than the bright puppy.

Her ability to maim or kill is precisely what the bright puppy can do. Would you tease a puppy pit bull? Then neither would you wish the wrath of Cameron, for her innocence and unwieldy existential distance from her new human world don't detract from her inherent power to destroy it. Yet her power is powerless to render her anything better or greater than something less in the human worldunless, maybe, just maybe all or some of these Terminator beings are indeed cognitively sophisticated enough to alchemize into the essentially *human,* just as it was clear enough that the replicants of the Blade Runner universe, though a product of some variant of in vitro creation, in other words not borne of a womb, were actually human, or the functional equivalent.

If they, and she, do have the cerebral equipment, silicon, or its equivalent, technological where ours is biological, to wish to, and to learn to become the functional equivalent of human, then perhaps, too, can they, and shelove.

Is the notion really that far-fetched? Our bright canine puppy, or for this matter even our dimmest one, can behave toward us in a manner that most humans perceive or understand as love. Why, then, cant our brightest *cybernetic* puppy?

Didnt David, the A.I. child from the film A.I. Artificial Intelligence, love? Alas, you will assert that it was merely Davids *programming* that allowed this. But isn't it *our* programming, biological in our case, that allows *us* to love? Is there a difference? Or, did Davids programming merely permit him a *simulation* of love?

Love is the most powerful social force available to humankind. Without it, anything can and does happen. At such time that we begin to engineer human-like or humanoid beings--or they engineer themselves--wed better ensure that they value love, brotherly love, as much as we do, or should, or were *all* in big trouble.

Ultimately, however, for me this entire issue and the questions that surround it should be irrelevant: we should be working to better develop the capacity of the human race to love. However, there is no such focus at present, in large measure because such an endeavor does not serve the profit interests of the global ruling class, so it is not encouraged, and in part because people themselves, us, have not yet realized the critical importance of the principal of brotherly love to our present and--Terminator fans--our very Future.

Thus, we distract ourselves with subsidiary questions and pursuits of every kind, from the explicitly hedonistic to the intellectual, such in this age of technology as the question of the ability of nonbiological beings to approach humanity, and to love. A subsidiary question, of course, is not necessarily an unimportant one, merely one relative to which a more important question exists.

Cameron--do us proud.

It's unbelievable that anyone is bemoaning its cancellation when the show's creators clearly didn't even have enough material for 2 seasons. There is a ludicrous episode involving the reprogrammed Terminator visiting the library each night (!) and solving a Terminator-related mystery from the Era of Prohibition. Shockingly stupid. Speaking of the creators, someone involved must be a religious zealot because this series talks about ""god"" more than any scumbag televangelist. It's jarring and completely nonsensical to endlessly spout religious rhetoric in a show about killer cyborgs from the future. Terrible.",1447200000,,781,5.516666666666667

Whoever made the decision to cancel it should be ashamed. The last few episodes of the second season set the show up for some GREAT possibilities, but they got cancelled at a TERRIBLE spot in the story. I regularly go back and watch some episodes on my blu rays, and STILL get angry that it was cancelled. Anyway, I would definitely recommend that anyone buy both these seasons as well as the first two Schwarzenegger films. They all fit together very solidly. Also, I actually think this is Lena Headey's best performance and best character, and Summer Glau did a great job playing a Terminator. She really made the character mysterious and interesting while needing to show almost no emotion. And Shirley Manson really surprised me with how perfectly cast she was and how well she performed.

Cast members really get into it in the 2nd season. Richard T Jones really excels. Diminutive Summer Glau as a (good) Terminator is superb. Special effects are great.

The sound track is noteworthy for it's very haunting musical theme.

As anyone who watches Game of Thrones can attest, Lena Headey is a fantastic actress.  In TSCC she perfectly captures that combination of toughness and vulnerability that is Sarah Connor.  I can't say enough good things about Summer Glau's rendition of her character either.

My favoraite character is Cameron the Terminator played by Summer Glau. She's also in firefly and some other things. I think the directer confused her on how to play a cyborg--sometimes she is more human, other times she is more robotic. Lena Headey is an actress with a range of emotions and complexities, frankly in my opinion a bit too refined and feminine to play Sarah Connor. Linda Hamilton is definitely more gritty and prisony looking than Lena, but I thought she was fine for this show. Maybe the producers will bring it back as they keep making Terminator movies every year or so. But the great thing is I now have the complete series. Whoo hoo!

3458222,4,B001AQR3J4,"The most recent and indeed upcoming Terminator movies, while profitable, can no longer adorn the legacy of T1 or even T2 - each offering is staler and further from that original glory. Enter Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.
How misguided was my initial hasty snubbing of the show as yet more tacky franchise hijacking - and I hadn't even watched it yet!

I NOW STAND CORRECTED:

This show is the WORTHIEST SUCCESSOR to Cameron's masterpieces. Friedman & Co. have done utterly sterling work expanding and resuscitating the universe, art, mythology and science of Terminator in ways which baffle and inspire even die-hard followers.
In a time when the masses are switching off their TVs, this show brought out more depth and food for thought than anyone would've expected from sci-fi TV.

We witnessed the sci-fi horror of a Cyborg re-clothing itself in living ""Human"" tissue in a sequence eerily recalling the antics of Clive Barker's original Hellraiser film character Frank Cotton. Stunning work - riveting homage.
We are even walked through a Skynet slave camp complete with obsolete early-model Cyborg jail-keeper whose plastic features and shrewn ""hair"" give him more than a fleeting resemblance to the dreaded Michael Myers mask from ""Halloween.""
The show neatly captures the deeply immersing dark, mysterious, ominous ""night-time"" feel we all recall from X-Files. There's even a cryptic reference of sorts to Red Dwarf!
Such tasteful grasp of, and tribute to a wide palette of genres and screen classics is much appreciated.

There is a fiery moral, philosophical and emotional core which continuously questions and re-imagines what humanity should be and is heading toward, and whether it is something that can, or even should, be ""saved"". The romantic, domestic & comedic threads are equally gripping too.

This is the only mature, accomplished subsequent offering on par with T1, often surpassing the more childish, trivial aspects of T2, while incorporating its most essential elements.

Definitely buy this, and ask yourself why the *bleep* this incredible show was cancelled in favour of much of the unoriginal, brainwashed, vegetative drivel which pervades the modern viewing world.",1411430400,,2203,5.316091954022989
3458223,5,B001AQR3J4,"I loved this series, and the second season became even better than the first.

Networks always move shows and few survive after the move. i think Fox should have kept The Sarah Connor Chronicles and cancelled Dollhouse. When will the networks learn to keep a show on its debut night and stick with it so it can develop a following? it was not an expensive show to produce.

Every episode kept you guessing what would happen next and there will be challenges ahead when the day arrives AI are as sophisticated as those in this tv series. There was even a group of AI that opposed Skynet with a new timeline after the second Terminator movie. Very impressive writing.

Pay the $1.99 on Amazon Prime for this episode and there you go! Makes me not dread watching the final episode of season 2 so much. But talk about a cliffhanger!

I guess that's the beauty of time travel paradoxes and stuff ... you can kind of make it what you want it to be.  Anyway, I think it's a shame Fox decided not to renew the show for a 3rd season ... lame if you ask me, but what we did get was really good.",1401753600,,483,4.172043010752688

Of course many new story-lines are followed, many cool Terminator scenes through out. tracts how ""John Conner"" learns and matures into the leader of the future resistance. The ""good"" Terminator charged to protect young John sent back from the future is a hot young actress John's age - interesting. She does a great job at making you believe she is almost human.
Mom is overly protective and a real bad-ass, a lot of people get killed all the time. Terminators battle each other and time travel and flashback/forwards round out the science fiction nicely.

Occasionally story lines are a bit contrived - sometimes too much time is spent on wow-is-me my life sucks story, but if at 12 yrs of age I discovered my youth was over and the future world would be run by Artificial Intelligence that wanted to kill all humans and I was going to be the Leader of the resistance - I might have a few rounds with wow-is-me too.

It got a little trippy w/all the time travel, but the concepts were good and I wish they could have had it last at least one more season.

Alas, it appears that's sadly what is in store for this franchise: just a few more nails in the lid of the casket. With rumors of a reboot of the original films to put a new twist on the originals as well as a new tv show intertwined with said reboots, it's difficult to understand why the labels would rather ruin the already crippled franchise (esp. After T3 &4) instead of producing another excellent season (or four) of this gem. Spectacular casting, top-notch performances, and above average story development all combined to make many scratch their heads when pondering why this great series got nixed in favor of other prime time excrement that we are subjected to, courtesy our broadcasting companies.

Season 1 was pretty decent but then in season 2 john suddenly decides he wants to do everything just because he feels like it or that can't be so because i don't want it to be.  Kind of reminds me of Hannah (Ashley Benson) in Pretty Little Liars who's main philosophy behind why things are or are not a certain way is based on one and only one premise alone.  Extrapolate that into John's mind and here is an example of what you might come up with.  Oh Mom, I invited a complete stranger over to our new place and totally compromised our whereabouts but we don't have to worry you know why?  Because I don't want it to, that's why and nothing in this universe can refute that.  So Season 1 went from a pretty decent show to nothing but one mishap after another and your typical adolescent angst fueled drama.  IMO, it's almost like they canned the original writers and then hired the writing staff from Laguna Beach or something.  Season 2 lost any shred of respect I had for the show and I am going to quit at episode 2 because there is a limit to the amount of unrealistic stupidity that I can tolerate.

The acting of all the characters was superb and the writers fleshed out the characters so well that you become fully invested in them, and prepare to hang onto your seats for every show.",1397347200,,461,4.554216867469879
3458419,4,B001AQR3J4,"I've always greatly enjoyed the Terminator universe and had been eyeing this show for some time.

It definitely met, and in certain respects exceeded the expectations I had going in.

the story picks up shortly after the events in Terminator 2, with a young teenaged John Connor moving about and attempting, with his mom Sarah, to outrun the events centering around the desctruction of Cyberdyne Industries and the murder of Mile what's-his-name (black dude from T2 that blew himself / the rest of the building up).  Shortly after the show begins, a Terminator discovers John in highschool, he's attacked, and it's revealed that he's under the protection of a female Terminator named Cameron.

No, it's not nearly as poorly conceived as the female terminator from T3.  Cameron is the highlight of the series - and it doesn't hurt that the girl (Summer Glau) is gorgeous.

They run away with female terminator in tow, and through a series of events end up moving forward in time to 2007.  Without spoiling anything, the device they use to move from T2's 1999 to our current-gen (at the time of show) 2007 was quite believable.  The cast of characters is really strong, and season 1 is spectacular.  Season 2 falls off a bit around the midpoint, but all in all it's very worth watching.

The 4 stars and not 5 is due to the second season just kinda lacking... something.  It's worth powering through, as the story is a lot of fun to experience - but it takes a while to pick back up and permanently drops off right as they inject a new time travel arc into the story.

Best character development in the Terminator series, thanks to the time afforded by a TV series vs. a movie.  Cromartie, played by Garret Dillahunt (who can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned - he's incredible) is another stellar character.",1397260800,,1808,4.665615141955836

Most of the core characters/acting was actually pretty well done and believable.
Of course if you didn't like the T1` and T2 movies (which this follows) you won't like the series.
The series doesn't address anything in T3 or T4 pictures.
A new twist is the potential for a 5th column in the future terminators themselves.  This piece is not firmed up before the 2nd season ends.  But it is still entertaining up to the end.",1397088000,,617,4.491071428571429

It was so vastly superior to Terminator Salvation, I was unable to sit through the movie.  Christian Bale is a far cry from Thomas Dekker, plus the writing and dialogue were atrocious.  Yet somehow that travesty of a film led to the demise of the brilliant Sarah Connor Chronicles.  Which is my one and only complaint of the series:  it's cancellation.

And the resistance is a Mongolian fire-drill...
Honestly, there is no way that mankind can triumph over artificial intelligence. I guess, that was the final conclusion, because they pulled the plug on the series.

From a Biblical perspective, the series dealt with many issues.
What do you believe? Why are we here? What are we doing while we are here on this earth?

Why do you do what you do or more to the point, what do you act the way you do?
Do you have a soul? Where does your soul go after death? Was John Connor the Saviour?

3458509,5,B001AQR3J4,"Excellent show. I started watching the night it debuted and was supremely disappointed Fox decided not to renew a third season. SCC is well-written, but there is a caveat; the Terminator films are action-oriented and effects driven. While SCC doesn't shy away from action, much of this show is driven by the relationship between the three main protagonists. While Sarah Connor is the namesake, the focus is really about John Connor's transition from whiney kid to leader of the human race. Sarah's only objective is the protection of her son, but the closer she attempts to be to him emotionally, the further she unintentionally creates the man John is destined to become. The ""good"" Terminator here, Cameron (after James Cameron obviously), is very well written and acted. She is humorous as she attempts to learn what being ""human"" is (""that tattoo is 'tight'""), though unfortunately due to the cancellation, she never becomes fully realized. Future John only trusts a machine. Is it because he has come to love this machine and she, him? This is alluded to often, like a gentle dance across the subject, but never a tually answered.

Clearly, this show was created, written and directed by a Terminator fan. There's a lot of fan service and the dialogue and cast are all in. Again, it's a shame Fox canceled this show. It seems perhaps with shows like Sleepy Hollow, SCC was ahead of its time and Fox just didn't know what to do with it.",1393718400,,1440,4.806451612903226

I believe if it was up to the many fans of this show and shows like The Dresden Files, Terra Nova and many other incomplete TV series an ending would resolve the craving for more.  At least give us a conclusion like you did with FarScape with  The PeaceKeeper Wars to bring closure to some great TV series.",1393718400,,433,4.2682926829268295

3458531,3,B001AQR3J4,"While I liked the first season of Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles, Season 2 has been a disappointment. The characters, especially John Connor, seem to have regressed and become dumber. John starts acting like an angst-ridden teenager rather than the future leader driven with purpose. For somebody whose life is at risk, he makes far too many stupid decisions. The other characters aren't that much better. I felt like more than last season the characters aren't picking up on simple clues that are telegraphed clearly to the audience. Meanwhile, it seems the producers couldn't resist giving Cameron the Terminator a crush on John. For a show like this, where you're supposed to believe the characters are hardened veterans of a struggle against machines, it's never a good idea to let the audience believe that they're smarter than the characters.

The show isn't a total loss. Lena Heady still makes a compelling Sarah Connor. The production values, special effects, and acting are all a step up from Season 1. But I feel that there are too many dead-end plot developments and weak characterizations. I hate to say it but I can understand why this show was canceled.",1392940800,,1173,5.015384615384615

3458549,4,B001AQR3J4,"I thought this series had finally caught it's breath in season two, and I began to enjoy the work of watching it. However, like so many TV shows these days, it just didn't cater to the widest audience to deliver the big bucks to the bean counters in the back room. I think we some times forget that we the viewer are the product, and network TV's prime objective is to separate us from our money, not to provide entertainment or some community service.

So with that in mind it is no wonder, that Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles became just another casualty in that greed pipeline. The cancellation of the show in my opinion was a bad call for TV consumers by the networks in a long line of bad calls that has terminated so many good TV shows. Unfortunately in this TV age there is no room for the fringe who follow the oddball shows. So, in the accounting department I'm sure they were cheered for pulling the plug on this series. Like any smart virus the TV industry knows enough to move on to a fat, new organism to feast on without hesitation or thought, because the time a viewer invest in watching their product has no bearing on a TV shows outcome or life cycle. The only thing that matters is how much are we willing to pay to keep their product alive and in front of us. It is this attitude that has kept me away from network TV for years including HBO, Showtime and the rest. I just got sick of being told ""Hasta La Vista"" baby midstream.",1392508800,,1456,4.313868613138686

3458552,5,B001AQR3J4,"I choose this rating because the action, details and work that these producers, actor and directors put in to this was outstanding and I like it very much, but if only Arnold Schwarzenegger was in there; I think it would have been more epic and I would recommend this to anyone who is a terminator fan or a cyborg/robot fans who like to see supernatural things.",1392422400,,361,4.484848484848484

3458555,4,B001AQR3J4,I enjoy a well constructed story... This had reasonably good acting with characters that continued to develop.  They maintained the just of the original storyline but did not labor on what had happened in the movies. Sorry this only lasted two seasons but as with many sequels it was time to depart..,1392163200,,300,4.769230769230769
3458556,5,B001AQR3J4,"Very smart writing, much more character-focused than the movies.  Probably more appealing to female viewers, too.  The character of Cameron is one of the most intriguing creations I've ever seen.  Unlike Arnie in T2, it is never made clear if she is completely trustworthy.  She is loyal to John Connor (except for one hiccup that's a doozy) yet she is ice-cold along certain dimensions.  She apparently cares deeply for him, but not as a human would.  Kind of like having an intelligent Siberian tiger as a pet.  It won't eat you, but it might kill the mailman.  John knows he should not be so attracted to her, but can't help it.  Sarah Connor needs and uses Cameron but is fearful of being displaced by her as John's primary protector and companion.  This fear is amplified by the fact that John has reached the age where he naturally starts pulling away from a parent to begin his adult life.  The dynamic between these three characters is the most interesting thing in the show.  Lena Heady, Summer Glau, and Thomas Dekker are all superb.

The Blu-ray is excellent in terms of picture quality, and I say this as something of a home-theater buff.",1392076800,,1150,4.661691542288557

3458564,5,B001AQR3J4,If you haven't seen the show before... or you haven't watched it since broadcast it's well worth a look. Start with Season 1 since it builds rather nicely throughout the run.,1391731200,,174,4.645161290322581
3458565,4,B001AQR3J4,"Season one is great, exciting, lots of action.  Running around.  Season two starts to drag.  Like most of these shows, there ends up being too many close up staring shots and talking. And weird pauses like a soap opera.  And weird plot twists that are more annoying than entertaining.  It happens with almost all these types of shows, but usually not so quickly.  Probably part of the reason it was cancelled after season two.  Since you know there are only two seasons anyway, I'd recommend just watching season one if you like the original movies.

However, at the very end they come up with some interesting ideas and I would have liked to see a third season.",1391558400,,662,4.598290598290598

3458589,5,B001AQR3J4,"Best show ever. Even with a cliffhanger ending it still may be the best ending of a tv show.

3458668,4,B001AQR3J4,"This series ran on Fox a few years ago and while not perfect, is certainly better than a number of series on air now.
I think Fox had high expectations for the show and tried to move it to certain nights, what they should have done was leave it on one night and let it build a larger following. I think what the series had to say about machine intelligence and how technology really can't be controlled, if something is going to be invented, it will be. I think that's correct. For example, If Edison hadn't invented the light bulb, someone else would have, as technology had developed well enough to be ready for the invention.",1388448000,,628,4.422413793103448

3458674,5,B001AQR3J4,"There are few TV series I like and probably less than a dozen I have ever loved.  However, this is now one of them!

I had seen an episode of this when it originally aired (2008-2009) and passed it up, despite being a fan of the movies and Arnold!  I give it a second chance in 2013 (on Amazon Prime) and got hooked. I now think it is more than a worthy successor to the brilliant Terminator 2: Judgment Day.

After Sarah Connor, her son John and Arnold (T-800 Terminator) successfully destroy the liquid metal (T-1000) terminator, Arnold is destroyed (at his own request) at the end of Terminator 2, Sarah goes on the run to train John (to be the future leader of the resistance) and attempt to stop Skynet's development (by whatever means!?)...

Positives

+ Story:  Always a good action story (fighting against impossible odds), it is at its best when it also looks at the ""soul of the machine."" What are the ethics of the terminators and those of the people? Do the terminators have free will or do they only follow their programs or serve Skyet? Are there factions within the machines?

+ Acting: Main characters were solid; but, for me, the support characters shone the brightest.  My clear favorite was John Henry (as a T-800 terminator), in perhaps the best exploration of being a Cyborg since Arnold! The actor (Garret Dillahunt) does a fantastic job making this character come alive (sorry, I could not resist the bad pun). Others who I liked included James Ellison (FBI Special Agent with a bible), Catherine Weaver (scottish liquid metal T-1000 terminator disguised a something truly evil - a multinational CEO) and her intriguing daughter.

+ Music:  Though the great music from the movies is not used much, there is wonderful use of music is some episodes. The episodes I remember most, where the show reaches true brilliance, is where they use music a lot and words very little.  If memory serves, I think it was season II episode 5 that is the best example of this!

Negatives

I need more episodes!!!  Alhough after I googled to see if there were more episodes out there, I saw there may be more in the works in 2014 - so will keep my fingers crossed - and if they are not prevented from being made by Skynet, then I will accept the tantalizing invitation ""Will you join us?""",1388016000,,2292,4.597051597051597

I wish that I had been able to see the original telecast(s).  While the fast passed movies kept you on the edge of your seat I was left with questions such as where, when, who, and how afterwards.  The series gave you time to consider the sequence of events making the action understandable.  Closer to fiction than science fiction? The characters have depth ""and last for a while.""

The characters development was a complete miss - with so many hours - the characters could develop some more.
Especially John and Cameron seems to have a bond in the future  that was completely missed here with only few hints
especially in the 1st season.

The actors who play John and Sara were playing ok - but the characters were flat.  Cameron and Derek are the only characters who made the story a bit interesting.

Wow was I wrong.  4 years after cancellation I finally give the show a chance through Amazon's Instant Video.  I never even knew this show existed, and it was one of the most fun shows to binge.  I put it right there with Battlestar Galactica.  The cast and creative vision of Friedman take the Terminator world to the next level.  If not for the cancellation, I believe this story would have trumped the magic of the first two movies.  It is a ""rabbit hole"" type plot that makes yourself and the characters involved to rethink all assumptions about the rise of the machines and humanity's fall from grace.  Cameron and Friedman are working on Avatar 2 together.  C'mon guys, get the Sarah Connor Chronicles cast back together and make us a movie to wrap this thing up!

This show has great plots, dialogue, and layered meanings and themes hidden within the show. If you liked any of the terminator films, you'll absolutely love this show. If you like any scifi or action TV shows, you'll definitely love this show. Cancelling this show is the dumbest thing that FOX has ever done. What fools.",1386201600,,694,4.743801652892562

Worth watching if you like the Terminator story line, and certainly better written than the original Terminator movie. That being said, you can see why it was cancelled--it's big budget with special effects at times, but then the story is slow with lots of still emotional shots. I imagine Terminator fans would like more action and a lot more Cameron, since she is one of the more interesting aspects of the story that unfortunately was never fully developed before it all ended.",1384387200,,584,5.157894736842105

However the two years were wonderful, fun and a pleasure to have watched.  Better 2 years than one or none.  This is exceptional TV.  The characters are fascinating, the writing is top-notch.  I believe the machines will arrive.  They just have such an amazing cast.  One character after the other is positively excellent.  I have a bit of the blues with Sarah's chronic serious side - but she is trying to save John who is trying to save humanity - I guess that is a serious role?  Regardless, Season 2 is an EYE-POPPER !  Cameron (Summer Glau) out does her Terminator self and John Henry (Garret Dillahunt) is just entertaining.  Catherine Weaver (Shirley Mason) is weird and wonderful.  The characterization of her stolen daughter becomes intricately involved with everyone in the series.  The last episode was . . . .well at least there was a last episode . . . . If only, someone would pick that up.  It could be titled ""The John Henry Chronicles"" or Weaver's ""I'm melting, I'm melting."" Gotta love that ""Back to the Future"" ******.

There is NO Arnold Schwarzenegger in this. Cameron the Terminator - I doubted she'd pull it off - but she is Great!
I think as this TV series progressed - it drifted off too much into like a drama or soap opera. I really don't care about John Connor's love interests.
Too much mulling around - and people being uptight and temperamental.
And the real action - and not as much for special effects - started to turn me off.
Still - I don't get why there wasn't a season 2. Maybe it was written for just two seasons?

John, has been reduced to a teenager in high school no less, with high school problems... he's honestly my most hated part of the series.

That said, the new terminator protector is amazing.  there are a few episodes with her in the second session that really shine, like when she's in the house trying to figure it out, but the episode where she's trying to make friends was painful to watch, and completely uninteresting.  Luckily i just find her character fun, so i excepted it.  if it was john, i'd probably skipped the EP.

3458797,5,B001AQR3J4,"This show is actually perfect and it effectively conveys terror and violence of these would be apocalypse-bringers.  I actually like this show more than the films.  It's pretty heavy and intense.  The season premiere sticks out for two reasons: it made me a fan of Shirley Manson's singing and I would buy the Samson and Delilah song if I could find it; the other reason is that this is the episode where it becomes clear that the Terminators/Skynet need to keep the Connors safe for their own survival.  Any third party danger must be removed otherwise the future of the machines will be nil.

3458808,2,B001AQR3J4,"For such a great Season 1, and great characters, with good acting (sometimes one-note roles), they totally lost it in Season 2. Production values and acting seem fine, but the writing, specifically the story arcs, were bizarre, did not tie enough plot points together, created unnecessary time loops, were not clever enough concerning how skynet really got established, and sometimes were lame.
The basic concepts of the seven-year leap forward, meeting the same FBI agent, the development of a truly aware AI, what future John Connor does based on what current John Connor learns and his vague allegiance to Cameron are all really meaty conceptual development. What they did with it over 8 or 10 episodes just sucked. Somehow, the insistence on showing Sarah struggling with the fatigue of running became the subject of more than half of the episodes and Derek had a ton more potential than where he was actually used.

I did watch them all, though. Felt like a loyalty vote since I liked the original movie concept and Season 1 so much.",1379116800,,1038,4.8977272727272725

3458810,5,B001AQR3J4,The real shame is that there was never a season three to wrap up the story lines. Complex and flawed characters work through trust and betrayal to survive. A terminator who struggles with the fact that she might well be in love with the protagonist. I found it all very engaging.,1379116800,,279,4.490196078431373

Season 2 dragged a little at the start, but towards the middle and end it got very exciting as things developed. And we're of course left with a cliffhanger and no closure as to the TSCC universe now.

Highly enjoyed the main actors roles and looked forward to every next episode.
The story lines were also great, and awesome effects, so props on the writers and special effects guys on this TV series. There were a few creative liberties as with any spin-off, but they meshed well into the story.

Didn't like the character selected for ""Kyle Reese"", looked more like a dolled-up boy than a rough around the edges soldier. Too bad the at-time President of Fox TV, Kevin Reilly supported cancelling the show.",1376697600,,783,4.977099236641221

How's that for demographics?  It was enthralling.  The performances drew you in, the terminators made you lean back for the ride.  It's not easy to do a movie that is essentially one long chase scene, but to attempt and so successfully achieve it in a tv show is amazing.  Once Lena Heady is through with GOT, they could always start the series again picking up in the future.  Maybe then my mom would stop asking me when Season 3 is coming out.",1376352000,,604,4.3125

I love the additions of some characters that were included in this season. I love where this season picks up right where it left off with Cameron (Summer Glau) trying to kill John Connor (Thomas Dekker). The growing relationship between John and his girlfriend Riley Dawson that ends in tragedy. This show has a good mix of action as well as drama.

The Second Season is the best. Hollywood usually cancels the best shows(Firefly) so no need to wonder why they cancelled this one. I thought the writing, acting and action were really good.

Kind of like The A-Team, but with a really attractive woman in the lead role, and robots with guns. But it was much closer to Battlestar than A-Team in terms of quality: really engaging characters, plots and relationships that were complex and surprising, and of course a beautiful woman as the lead, and robots (also very pretty) with guns.
  Sad that it wasn't renewed, but a TV series is a delivery vehicle for advertisements, not quality storytelling and it sounds like they were put in a no-win time slot.",1374537600,,668,4.850877192982456

However, the acting wholly makes up for that and the story plot gets developed consistently with the plausible scenarios that could have been playing out in Sarah Connor's/John Connor's lives.  Too bad the less than visionaries at the studios killed this one. I for one would have been a loyal viewer for many more seasons to come.  I wish someone with the powers that be would realize what a fantastic show they had and how much potential was in it.  Too bad for us the viewers.  Maybe they Sci Fi channel will further develop it?

The overall mythology of this show echoed a lot of Battlestar Galactica: humanity's existence is at stake; there are a few morally ambiguous cylons/cyborgs; and there is a lot of grappling with judeo-christian religion and science as progressive and destructive. This is a multi-layered, dynamic, intelligent show that doesn't beat you over the head with lame platitudes and stereotypical characters. The moments between John and his mother are bittersweet and moving.

Lena Headey is amazing as always, and I'm glad she's getting more exposure with Game of Thrones. Thomas Dekker as John Connor is by far the best portrayal of the character. Summer Glau is exceptional as always (catch her on Firefly/Serenity and Dollhouse). Shirley Manson, Richard T Jones and Garrett Dillahunt are just such a pleasure to watch. And David Austin Greene - holy cow, what a transformation from 90210. He can BRING IT. Finally, I have to give mad props to Stephanie Jacobsen who manages to captivate every time she's on screen (see also Battlestar Galactica).

Okay, that's my rave. It's seriously sad when such a great show like this gets cancelled. But at least having these two seasons is well worth it. Do yourself a favor and watch the show.",1371168000,,1647,4.963768115942029

One of the best television series ever. And I have high standards, for me M*A*S*H and Hill Street Blues are the zenith of writing and acting- but this is also up there with them.

Brilliant!

Season two had some parts that weren't as strong as Season One for sure- some of it became a little soap opera-ish. Yet at the same time you still sympathized with the characters.

3458952,5,B001AQR3J4,"I had not seen the show before, and I was a bit worried about whether I would like it or not. My problem is that I thought the original movie was just about perfect - a closed loop that needed no sequel. It had a beginning and an end, a past, a present and a future, and the photograph tied it all together. I was disappointed by T2 for the simple reason that they changed that future and I didn't want them to. Selfish me. I saw some bits and pieces of the show when it aired, but didn't try to get into it. Then I saw T3 and didn't quite hate it, but close. I thought ""Is this guy ever going to grow up?"" Then I saw Salvation and thought ""He hasn't changed! What a wimp! Where the heck is John Connor?""

So I watched the series, and was satisfied for the first time in years. Their story follows directly on the heels of T2, but it had to start somewhere and it goes a long way toward validating what I wouldn't accept before. Season 1 was all about exploring the characters, but Season 2 was about the story. One of the the things I love the most about this second season is that it does what the movies didn't: We get to watch Sarah Connor's boy turn into John Connor, the legend. Thomas Dekker is brilliant in showing the man a sixteen-year-old can become if he has to.

I was a little let down by the ending, but only because of the open holes and unanswered questions. That said, they had been cancelled and had to do something. What they did do with what they had provided an outstanding ending for the series. I can't really go into my feelings without giving out spoilers, so I just have to say that while it was a little disappointing, I was highly satisfied with what they gave us, and I have no real complaints. Also, it was far better to my mind that either of the last two movies.",1367193600,,1795,4.140401146131805

3458969,4,B001AQR3J4,"Pretty much the same comments as those for season one.  A third season would give the writers an opportunity to properly close this portion of the Terminator franchise.

If you get a chance to watch the whole series from start to end, do it.  Even though the last episode was obviously an attempt to quickly bring this story to a close, the weaknesses could have been overcome with a strong opening in season three.

They did a great job with that from start to finish. There are a very few stinkers as well; you'll know 'em when you see 'em, that's all I'll say. Well worth your time, far better than most series.

The writing of the tv show is actually really bad, the actors try to do their best but the sophmoric and stupid ""realities"" the writers create are so frustrating at times you just want to stop watching. Every character is two dimensional and they always do things they know better just to create tension. Also I got so tired of all the charcters ALWAYS against each other. You would think that because the end of the world is near they might set aside their stupid feelings and work to gether. They are always tough and trained exept when they need to be, they always figure things out except when they need to and the civilins always accept what is going on even when there is no evidence.

My criticisms involve the casting -Lena Headey is too pretty and delicate to be a believable Sarah (Linda Hamilton is the yardstick in this case) and Shirley Manson as Catherine Weaver has facial features that are too old, tired and flawed to be a Kristanna Loken-type liquid metal terminator (yes, I understand that the Weaver character has simply replicated the physical features of the woman she is impersonating). On the plus side, these actors are very talented and buy into the script 100%. Thomas Dekker as John is alone worth the price of admission, as they say - unbelievable job! This is a series that transports you to a world that one can become totally engrossed in. Believable fantasy on this level is difficult to achieve.

This series takes up after Terminator 2. Lena Headey didn't feel right to me in the part of Sarah Connor. Too repressed, I didn't believe it when she engaged in hand-to-hand combat, etc. Maybe Linda Hamilton was too tough an act to follow. I've enjoyed Ms Heady's performances in other works (300, Game of Thrones), she just didn't seem the right actress to play Sarah. Having Summer Glau as a ""friendly"" terminator was an interesting idea, and it worked ok. Thomas Dekker was believable and enjoyable as a young John Connor finding his way and his destiny.

I guess there's been talk of doing the last two seasons and putting them direct to DVD, fine with me. I don't know how long ago that was but I really hope they'll still do it in the next few years.

*spoilers*

It seems that almost everyone misunderstands the ending. It is NOT a happy one. The redheaded terminator was NOT a hero. Think hard about the last 5 minutes of the finale. She protected John from the drone to gain his trust, then what? She immediately makes him jump 19 years into the future, where Judgment Day has long since passed, and he meets the humans of 2027. When they start talking, the truth comes out...NOBODY KNOWS HIM.

I REPEAT: NOBODY IN THE FUTURE KNOWS WHO JOHN CONNOR IS.

He never became the leader of the human resistance after JD, because he wasn't around. He jumped from 2009 to 2027. He's a nobody. The redhead's mission was not to kill him but to make him absent and irrelevant. She succeeded. Why would the drone crash into the office at that exact moment? She staged it...there is no other logical explanation.

*end spoilers*

This show is worth watching once, if you are a Terminator fan. Sure, it is full of plot holes, and sure, the effects are bad and the writing questionable. However, there are some great moments that make it worth the effort. There is plenty of eye candy and a fair amount of respect is paid to T1 and T2. I don't think Lena Headey was tough enough to play the war machine that Sarah Connor had become after T2. She had huge shoes to fill and didn't really live up to Linda Hamilton's at-all-costs portrayal of the character. She was too soft and feminine, which has its appeal, but is not what Sarah became to protect her son.",1359849600,2,1685,4.526315789473684

The issue I have with this season is the ending. Season 2 ends at a very interesting and critical event. I hope they decide to continue this show. This season also seemed to drag a little bit at times. Riley was focused on too much I think. A character like her wasn't really all that important to the main story. She did serve an important purpose, but she wasn't worth spending the time that they did on her. Overall I really enjoyed season 2. I think fans of the 1st season will probably agree.",1354320000,,983,4.318918918918919

3459118,4,B001AQR3J4,"I still don't understand FOX's penchant for cancelling their best shows: original Family Guy, Firefly, Arrested Development, Dollhouse--the list goes on. I remember that this show successfully came back after the Writer's Strike in Hollywood a few years back to a rather strong season 2 (I think season one had something like nine aired episodes). When this show was canceled, I resolved to never watch network TV regularly again (I mostly stream these days).

While some aspects of season one felt like thinly veiled homages to ""T2,"" season two shot into uncharted territory with a depth and humanity that had not been seen since the genesis of James Cameron's original films. There are equal proportions of drama and action (betrayal, love, hate, and all the things that make us human), as well as plenty of choice moments and one-liners for fans both new and old to remember. What you ""know"" about the war, the machines, Skynet, and even John Connor himself will be radically challenged in a way that is still respectful to and cognizant of the source material.

I think the original Terminator, T2, and this series (forget T3 or Salvation), along with certain issues of the Dark Horse comics, make a complete and nuanced canon for the ""Terminator"" universe.",1353715200,4,1261,4.971563981042654

3459125,3,B001AQR3J4,"First let me say I really enjoyed this show while it was on the air and on the dvds. The show had some outstanding episodes in the second season and a few in the middle that tended to drag, making the overall season uneven. What I want to address here is the season two DVD set itself. I found while the episodes themselves were well presented, the extras on the sixth disk were totally unwatchable due to technical issues with the disks themselves. The extras on disk 6 are full of glitches, the images are heavily pixilated, and the audio is choppy and out of sync when it plays at all. The extras are totally unwatchable, but since it was impossible to discover this before I had opened the set and played the entire second season run, the set probably is unreturnable. So if you want the episodes, the set is fine, but if you want the extras forget about it. Overall rating I give the second season four stars, the DVD set two stars for an average of three stars.

I am adding this later because when I contacted Amazon about this issue with the extras, even though the set was opened, they offered to let me return it and order a new set or a refund of 33% of the purchase price.

I was not interested in this show when it aire don television, as I am rarely interested in television shows as I am overly pessimistic and think they look.. stupid. Well, I bought prime for the shipping and decided to check out this show. I immediately got hooked. Some reviewers stated that they felt there was a lack of story behind some characters. I never understood this. I get annoyed with flash backs and back story fill. The bit that this show did was more than enough for me. Flash backs and back stories just hinder forward progression in my eyes. Yes in the second season John becomes a little more ""emotional,"" but I felt that this was a good thing. he is a High School teenager, and it shows. You can't just make him some badass kid that saves the world right then and there.

As the first season started with a jump to the future, this season, and indeed the series, ended with a jump to the future.

3459139,5,B001AQR3J4,"A worthy end to the series!

""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" is a show that starts off with a bang and has strong moments throughout the series. It allows the viewer to get into more depth about what life would be like growing up as John Connor, or being the mother of John Connor. The series did have some slow moments -- a few of the episodes dragged. Which is not to say that they were bad TV, just not up to the standard of the other episodes.

The Season 2/Series finale is certainly among the best of the series, and arguably the best. It acted as a nexus for the different plot lines to come together, and in this sense it serves well as a series finale. At the end of the episode John's life in the ""present"" time comes to and end, and he has, for the first time in my opinion, really begun to assume the mantle of leader in the conflict with the robots. So it is a good point to pause.

While it works well as a finale, it simultaneously blows the plot lines wide open and gave the story many new directions to take, new roles for all the major characters, and new newly-changed relationships to explore. It really is unfortunate that the series was cancelled, as there was really plenty of steam left in the story, and tons of room left for the characters to grow and mature, and develop in their relationships. (E.g. between John and his father and uncle, between John and Cameron, between Cameron and Ms. Weaver, and between John and Ms. Weaver. Basically every combination of relationship between people and cyborgs. Every combination of conflict, too.) Which all adds up to being more maddening than satisfying. What was the network thinking???

The final episode also sees Cameron enact a wonderful throwback to the original Terminator: an assault on a prison. (Summer Glau, how could I ever doubt you as a Terminator?) While more subtle a character transformation than John's, I think the change Cameron undergoes in this episode is just as interesting, meaningful, and important to the story.",1340841600,,2019,4.6155988857938715

3459184,5,B001AQR3J4,"It's a shame that this series didn't get picked up for more seasons; this really is exceptionally good work for a TV series.  In many ways it seems superior to the Terminator movies, in spite of what was no doubt a much smaller budget.

The major characters were all well cast.  Sarah and John are believable characters for people in such extreme circumstances.  Lena Headey's role as a soft-spoken Sarah Connor was, for me, a big improvement over the strident Sarah in the T2 movie, a more complex character struggling with how to translate her love for her son into the discipline needed to keep him alive and to ready him for the impossible role he is to play in the salvation of humankind.  And Thomas Dekker does a great job as a brooding young John Connor as he struggles with his mother and comes to grips with the reality of his destiny and the depth of his sacrifice.

You can think of the TV series as being like T2 but with half the action and ten times the character development.  The series is about human courage, flaws, suffering, relationship, and what makes us different from machines -- all delivered in a Sci-Fi action envelope.

Summer Glau did a great job as a Terminator; she is beautiful while still having a slightly unusual face -- large eyes and a big forehead.  When she holds perfectly still, tilts her head to the side slightly, opens her big eyes wide but keeps the rest of her face expressionless, she invokes the ""uncanny valley"" effect (look it up on Wikipedia) that makes her seem slightly creepy.  I feel sorry for her having to do more mundane ""beautiful young woman"" roles since; the Terminator role was perfect for her, and she did it justice.  And even her role as a cyborg was used to explore what it means to be human, with Glau appearing at times vaguely compassionate, but then suddenly turning brutally inhuman.

Most of the other roles are interesting and well cast, too.  The fellow who played Cromartie / John Henry did a wonderfully creepy job.  For some reason I didn't really like the role of Riley Dawson that much, though -- the one weak spot for me personally.  I think that role was intended to help us understand what this all meant for John Connor, but it rubbed me the wrong way somehow.

The special effects are reasonably generous (but of course modest compared to the T movies), and there is a good deal of action.  Episode 1 of Season 2 is particularly awesome -- true edge-of-your-seat entertainment.

The cancellation of this show was a shock to many people; kind of makes you wonder.  I think part of the problem may be that this show is a bit dark -- more like Stargate Universe and the new Battlestar Galactica than, say, Stargate and Stargate Atlantis.  Sci-Fi doesn't appeal to everyone, and even less so when it's the dark variety.  Add to that what were probably relatively expensive production costs, and it didn't make it.

Buying season 2 of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles was an excellent investment for me for several reasons.  Firstly, being able to watch the episodes back to back and in the proper order provided me with a more fluid and digestible experience than when I watched them on TV during their original airing.  Furthermore, while not overwhelming, the complexity of the characters and storyline make watching the series very repeatable, as you will pick up on something new every time you watch them.  The story is very well written, and you can relate to the characters and the situations they find themselves in.  You will find yourself faced with many of the the same choices they have to make, and their feelings and emotions are at times so real that they become your own.  The performances given by Summer Glau and Garret Dillahunt are stunning:  easily some of the best of their careers.  There are also many great action scenes in this season, including several explosive terminator fight scenes.  The endoskeletal damage sustained by various terminators throughout the season is some of the most realistic and amazing of the franchise.  The only episodes that kept me riveted to my seat even more than the first episode of this season are the last few.  The ending episodes of season 2 of The Sarah Connor Chronicles found me quite literally shaking on the edge of my seat from a combination of excitement, trepidation, sadness, and a overwhelming desire for more.

3459201,3,B001AQR3J4,"There is really no capitalistic purpose to this review. If you are highly interested in this show, you will most likely purchase both seasons without thinking about it, which I did. So the only purpose that remains is one of criticism.

Season One was fantastic. It was fun seeing the references to the movies for the first time, and being introduced to the new characters. The plot moved along, the writing was sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, and the action was non-stop.

Then Season Two came along. It started off with a bang in the first episode. It continued until the middle of the season, and then it slowed to a crawl. Be warned, this is a full, 22-episode season of television. To spread the season across these 22 episodes, they inserted gimmicky filler episodes and slowed the dialogue to a crawl.

I knew I was in trouble when I encountered one of the first filler episodes: a 1950s-era piece. This is a common filler episode theme. Then there was another one in a sleep ward, similar to a mental hospital - another common filler theme.

The dialogue in the mid to later episodes literally slows down. After one person speaks, there is an abnormally long pause until the next person speaks.

The second half of this season literally bored me to tears, although it did have a good season and series finale.

Again, I have nothing against the show. I bought both seasons because I wanted to see more of Summer Glau's thespian work. I loved Season One, and the acting was great in both seasons. It was the writers that really dropped the ball in the second half of this season.",1308614400,3,1586,4.6263345195729535

3459203,5,B001AQR3J4,"The second season, with its 22 episodes, as opposed to only 9 in the first season, develops further the relationships of the principle characters (Sarah Conner, John Conner, and Cameron), and adds new layers with the introduction of the Catherine Weaver (Shirley Manson) character who is a T-1001 model with an unknown agenda. There are many amazing episodes such as ""Today is the Day"" parts one and two, which focuses on Jesse's (Derek's girl friend) character and introduces us to John Conner's possible future alliance with the T-1001 models. Cameron's (Summer Glau) cyborg character continues to be one of the most intriguing aspects of the series as she walks the fine line between unfeeling killing machine and a complex searching mind that's trying to understand a world of emotions that seem just beyond her comprehension.

It's too bad that the season ended so abruptly since its ever complex web of stories and interconnected histories was opening up an intriguingly convincing world about a scary future where intelligent machines are beginning to take over and reshape this world of ours.

This set is packaged smartly and the episodes look great in blu-ray.",1306022400,,1170,5.12041884816754
3459204,4,B001AQR3J4,"A little while ago I wrote a review on the first series of the Terminator TV series. There I praised it for effective storytelling, relatively good acting and competant effects.
Many of the same comments apply to the second (and final) series. Summer Glau is incredibly good as Cameron the Terminator. Especially of note are the scenes where she is effectively playing two characters, and the contrast between the two is very good.
The other performers have relative degrees of success. Lena Heady as Sarah Connor does a good job but comes across as far more normal than Linda Hamilton. Thomas Dekker as John Connor is also effective in the role, and does well with what he is given.

The biggest problem with the second season is that it is long. 22 episodes is more than twice as long as the first season. What this means is that whereas the original season had a relatively trim and taut plotline this second season is a lot more disjointed. Plots come and go and there seems a lack of an overarching structure for the season. In many ways it's almost a traditional drama series with cyborgs added. Many of the plots don't really match up, and there are some significant plot holes.
The end of the season also makes very little sense at all. Considering the show was axed these will never be resolved, which is a shame since there is potential here.

So why then does it get 4 stars from me? Well, I liked it, even if it was a bit confused and drawn out. The acting was good for the type of show it is, the effects are good, and none of the characters or plots are grating. There is variety, even if that leads to it being unfocussed.

I would recommend this for people who like Terminator and liked the first season.",1304121600,2,1720,4.471337579617835

First of all the special effects were excellent and showed the improvements that have been made over the years since the first three terminator movies.  Character development was also excellent, allowing the watcher to learn a little more about each character as the series progressed. Characters changed naturally over time, just like flesh and blood reality.  Unlike TV shows such as the Law and Order series, each episode stood alone as a story and yet was different from all of the other episodes.

It just ad-libs from one episode to the next. In a nutshell, the two seasons depict how one Sara Connor babysits her woose-cookie son John, dragging him from one poorly concealed hideout to the next. They are accompanied by an unlikely uncle and a protecting she-robot from the future. The she-robot, who poses as John's sister Cameron, is the most rewarding aspect of the entire escapade. It's as though the producers knew the script wouldn't be engaging so they threw her into the mix to keep the viewers laughing, as she continually breaks arms, necks and gun's down people the Connors are too timid to kill. These are definitely not the Connor's who save mankind. They have obviously been planted by the future to keep the robots, from the future, guessing.

3459210,4,B001AQR3J4,"The first season of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles was enough to make me go 'This is one of the best shows that's on.'  Season Two of the show took what Season One did and took it to another level with not only more episodes but more of a chance to tell a story about the whole Terminator mythology.  Sure this season got off to a slow start but as it got more and more into it, I believe that the whole season blew the first season out of the water if not out of here in some way or another.  We had some introductions to some new characters such as 'Catherine Weaver' who turns out to be like that of the T-1000 from the second movie not sure if it's the same model or maybe a little more advance than the T-1000.

There are other things that was interesting like with Catherine Weaver who seemed to not take the side of Skynet, and what her intentions were I have no idea.  We even learn about 'Cameron's' backstory as to the person she was modeled to look like, and let alone that a couple characters die before the end of the Season but by the time that the Season finale came about the twist at the end there.  Like I said there are things that they went about doing for this show even though it only lasted two seasons but it exceeded my expectations by far and I wish that there could've been a third season to help tie up any loose ends that were left in the Season Two finale.

The series ended on a cliff-hanger, and I was pretty pissed it didn't return for a third season to tie up all the loose ends. Some people think the show ended because viewership had slacked off when the show was moved to Friday nights. However, it may be due to the fact that when the second season ended, the 'rights of ownership' on the Terminator franchise was caught up in a litigation battle in the courts.

The quality of the blu ray disk it's self is very good.  You get a sharp image with lots of clarity and colors that truly pop.  As far as prime time shows go this looks as good as any.

Ultimately TSCC is a fun show for fans of the films but won't appeal to many beyond that.  As there are only two seasons it one mustn't give up too much time if they choose to go along for the ride.

3459239,5,B001AQR3J4,"This is the second season of ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"", a strong departure from the calmness and tranquility of the first season. This is much more gritty, with more action, and less filler. In one way, it seems to me, that this season is trying just a little too hard to be like the first movie, or at least tie into the first movie. Creating a downside.  The downside is for those who really liked the first season and wanted more of the same. This is clearly not the same. It takes place a lot closer to Judgement Day, with a very clear goal for both the Connor group and the cyborgs. There are some downsides to this season. For one, there are way too many people and cyborgs being brought back to the present from the future. I find that all of this clutters up the storyline, which may have been the reason or at least part of the reason for cancellation (I do not really know why it was canceled.) There are major changes in John Connor, such as he loses the hair for a more adult hair cut, John finds a girlfriend. She too is tied to the future, though he does not know that. Derek reunites with a past girlfriend/lover from the future who has ties to Johns girlfriend, but neither John nor Derek know that. Which further muddies the storyline in my humble opinion. There just seems to be too much from the future that is brought back to mold, shape, and protect John Connor. That all having been said, I have seen the first 10 episodes from this season and find that I just cannot stop watching it. So, if you like action, I mean non-stop, gripping your seat, biting your nails, white knuckle action, this is for you. You need to buy this, and watch it.

have there stories told to a satisfactory conclusion, and only two.

The main characters don't so much have their stories told as......all meet up in the end.
THATS IT, they meet, and then a cliffhanger which answers nothing.

It is like the story never gets told, even though most scifi fans already know the story by heart. All they needed to do was let the characters have alittle more room and let the ""killer machines"" do their thing without getting in the way. It would have been nice to see John Conner (Thomas Dekker) actually fall in love and develop a relationship (over an entire seasson maybe), an on going relationship, that maybe the ""killer machines"" might terminate, who knows, the writers seemed too interested in letting Summer Glau (the friendly terminator) through her weight around and blow things up.

If you think I am being negative, I am sorry, because with all its short comings, it was still one of my favorite shows, and in the movies while history is refered to, it is nice to see how to see how it came to pass. While it seems some of these things are taking place, I felt they were being packaged for the TV time slot, you only have 43 minutes to tell the whole story and they could have let issues spill over more, let the story get more complicated, more overwhelming, more real.",1269216000,,1728,4.559485530546624
3459260,5,B001AQR3J4,"After the incredible awfulness that was T3, I was cheered up by news that a TV series was being developed that would only use the first two films as canon.

When Terminator: The Sarah Connor chronicles premiered, I was delighted to see that, not only was it beginning where T2 left off, it was maintaining the spirit and quality of the franchise - and I was quick to buy the first season DVD set when it became available.

Season 2 continued the same level of quality, but its audience dropped off. Apparently, many of them felt that not enough stuff blowed up real good - totally ignoring the fact that the series was smart and well done, based on solid characterization with a deft mix of drama and humour, along with the requisite action.

The second season DVD set is very well put together: lots of behind-the-scenes material and some generally excellent commentary tracks. And, since the actual episodes hold up really well to repeated viewing, the set is one of the best SFTV DVD buys available.",1268784000,2,1002,4.649717514124294
3459261,5,B001AQR3J4,"Obviously everyone interested on this product is well aware of the terminator franchise, the story and all of its elements, also, considering this is the second season we are talking about you should have seen the first season and know the show's pace.

Season 2 continues where we were left off and keeps building momentum until the super exciting season/series finale. Even when there is no real ending to the show it does feel like a chapter has been completed and the major misteries or plots of the season were addressed and answered at least partially. For the ones wondering if it is worth even with no ""real ending"" the ride alone should be more than enough, really! and as a plus you get a full season of Summer Glau awesomeness, sorry couldn't leave that off lol

And finally, about the blu ray presentation something that really got my attention from the first minute of this season, is the video quality, is just soooo much better than the first season, not that the 1st has a bad transfer or anything, but this one really blows your mind, i guess kudos to the studio are in order for at least giving us fans a proper treatment even after knowing the show has been canceled.

3459262,5,B001AQR3J4,"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles is better than you might think. It looks and sounds like an action series, and I'll grant you that there is plenty of ""action."" However, the scriptwriting is at the highest standard. Character development is nuanced and subtle. The dialogue is rich and surprising. And the episodes leave you with much to think about. For my taste, there is more action, and certainly more shooting, than necessary (I don't require any at all to be entertained). Thus my top-rated science fiction series this year remains the brilliantly-conceived and character-driven Stargate Universe (I haven't seen Caprica yet). Nonetheless, I really look forward to each episode of this series, because the characters and stories are so rich and complex. You might wish to reconceptualize this series as a science fiction/drama employing an action ""theme"" as a driver. The writers are brilliant. The acting is superb, with Summer Glau an old favourite from her Firefly days.",1268006400,,986,5.246835443037975

As a series Sarah Conner got off to a good start and only seemed to get better and better. The new charecters developed and progressed well throughout the show, particularly Summer Glau's terminator Cammeron.
But as said the network execs got cold feet and just looked at the viewing figures in the states and made the cowardly decision to pull the plug just as the production team were getting into their stride.
This second series is the best and longest of the two and demonstrates the strengths and some of the future direction of the show.

3459280,4,B001AQR3J4,"I really enjoyed both seasons of this show. Although these episodes are not as good as Terminator I and II* by any means, they do bring up an engaging glimpse into John Connor's teenage years, the people behind the creation of SkyNet, as well as philosophical questions, such as: What defines a human? Could a machine ever become human-like? What implications would that have on society?

The one thing I didn't like: A few episodes were just too ""slow"", not enough action, too much talking and some were just plain confusing.  What I do like about the show is how a lot of things happen in the initial episodes that you don't fully understand until much later in the story. The overall story seems to be consistent for the most part, I didn't detect any major contradictions in the storyline (or for that matter even with the first three Terminator movies). I also thought that for a relatively low-budget (as far as I know) movie the special effects were pretty decent.

It's disappointing to see that even though Season 2 got such great reviews (at least on Amazon) they decided to cancel the show. I was looking forward to season 3.

* The reason I think that this show is not as good at T1 and T2 is mainly because it is not as action-packed, and I think that that's what most Terminator fans were looking for in those movies. There are a lot of moments in TSCC were very little is going on (quite a bit of talking, memory flashbacks, etc), whereas T1-2 keeps you at the edge of your seat during 90% of the movie.",1264636800,,1518,4.469314079422382

Ratings need to include not only on-air viewings, but ITUNE purchases and whatever else there is to be had out there.  This futuristic audience of a futuristic program demands more than audiences of 20 years ago. TV just doesn't cut it anymore.  I personally was never home to watch--now I wish I had been.  I purchased the episodes on ITUNES instead, and have purchased the second season, but did not appreciate how they killed everyone off as a way to wrap the story up prematurely.

The acting is well done and the questions raised during the course of the the first and second seasons are very thought provoking and open-ended. Having also purchased the first season of Fringe, I find that both of these excellent series fill a void left by the departure of the ""X-Files."" This is particularly true of Fringe, but Terminator: The TV Series also belongs to the genre of cerebral science fiction. Personally I have no doubt that Asimov would have been a fan of both of these series, if he had lived long enough to see them. The bottom line here is that both of these excellent shows will be a part of TV history with such legendary TV series as Have Gun Will Travel, Star Trek, Kung Fu, X-Files, and Twilight Zone.",1261699200,2,904,4.552147239263804

This was a great show.  The special effects were almost as good, if not as good as a feature production.  And you can tell great care went into the writing and continuity of the plot.  My favorite character is Cromartie.  Talk about creepy... this guy has a smile that will make the hair stand up on your neck.  I'd venture to say this show was better than the last two movies combined.  It had a hell of a lot more heart to it, and the aspect of humanity is explored so much deeper than probably all the Terminator movies.

The season culminates in the last episode with an ending that only makes you want more.  Of course, this is bittersweet, because the a-holes at Fox would rather fill the airwaves with low budget crap like Cops and America's Most Wanted.

3459303,5,B001AQR3J4,"The task was difficult, herculean in fact. How can we fill the empty spaces of the trilogy, particularly the ""training"" years of John when he shifts and hesitates between being a libidinous teenager and assuming the war leader he is supposed to become, between a girl friend that has a mission that seems to be shady and a fake sister Cameron who is a cyborg more than anything else with a mission that even her might not know. The task is all the more difficult for the director, and the authors, because that two year series is supposed to reopen the closed trilogy and instead of hypothetically making John survive in the Presidential nuclear suite somewhere in Nevada bringing him to the future where he is going to take the head of the resistance. But that is not simple. Many adventures are thus invented with cyborgs that are looking for John in order to destroy him in his teenager's underwear and some others who have been brought down in a way or another, all of them obscure, in order to provide John with the proper means of transportation from 2008-9 to 2027. That is perfectly well done and John finds himself at the unripe age of eighteen in the middle of the final fight to the death between a handful of survivors and a mechanical world that has already tried to destroy humanity. I must admit the final tableau is a family reunion with John's own father, you remember that soldier that came down from the future to impregnate Sarah Connor with John, and that father's brother, John's uncle Derek who just died in our time, and John's cyborg he left behind all destroyed and her chip missing. We are ready for the last final descent onto the Rome of the machines. Hannibal has just arrived and the battle can start. It sounds like a clich, and it is, and that's why it works. Now this long chase, hunt, escape, trek of this second season is a little bit blurry here and there and some characters that appear in one episode and disappear in the next are not very clear in their use and finality, except to entertain us. And entertain us they do with action, explosions, special effects, emotions and even a lot of suffering, even if only one lesson can float on top of this big saga: never trust officials because they are nothing but vampire who live on our blood and marrow, never trust FBI or ex-FBI agents because they are always big liars in order to capture and keep their power, never believe the scientific brains of this world because they always lie to protect and satisfy their greed. One exception maybe is a catholic priest but he is Mexican, so he is different. He even knows how to pray. And praying is essential when the birds of prey are after you. And this series is worth a fortune by the length of these films: nine hundred and thirty five minutes, fifteen hours thirty five minutes. Quite an achievement to watch it in one go, if you can do that. Enjoy the trip, the trek, the dive in the recollections of the future some future survivors have of a future they haven't seen yet.

Season 1 gradually won me over and had me watching the episodes avidly after a while. It had glitches, never really cared for Lena Headey as Sarah, John's mother. But the introduction of Brian Austin Green, plus especially John Henry in season two, plus the story arc of the show emerging clearly in season 2, made this show captivating. There are some interesting sci-fi touches, it's intense and tense throughout, though there is room for quiet moments as well. I liked what they did with the A.I.'s. The enemy was very interesting, I'd love to have learned more about this brother A.I. to John Henry, John's future enemy, plus we finaly get to see a stunning T-1000 Terminator at work again for the 1st time since Terminator 2.

3459310,5,B001AQR3J4,"How often can it really be said that a television series actually atones for some of the big budget feature film releases of the same franchise?  Calling it a rare occurrence is massively underplaying it and yet that's exactly what many viewers consider Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (especially against the very average Terminator 3: Ride of the Machines).

It would turn out that Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles Season 2 would become last season of a solid science fiction television series that was well on its way to being a great one.  Fans will delight in the bitter-sweetness that is an exceptional boxset containing some of the show's finest moments as a grave marker for the entire series.  It's especially distressing on the staff commentary tracks where clearly the network's decision to cancel the series had not yet been revealed.

Unlike so many shows of late, this is one where the second season actually capitalized and realized much of the potential promised of in the first (which was pretty darn good itself). The cast expanded, with the addition of Brian Austin Green and Shirley Manson (yes the singer of grunge band Garbage). The scope of the prose enjoyed expansion as well, with new Terminators, timeline fluctuations (with visible consequence/ effect) and the intensity of the possibility of lead character death ever-present.

The acting, which was far above the norm for network television in the first series, actually manages to somehow improve for this season.  It's apparent that Lena Headey and Thomas Dekker became far more comfortable with their roles as Sarah and John Connor respectively while Summer Glau is given the opportunity to contrast her role as a human rather than a machine along the way.  Brain Austin Green was perfectly cast as Derek Reese (the brother of John Connor's father, Kyle) and Richard T Jones continues to dazzle with his gritty performance as James Ellison.  Garret Dillahunt takes the Cromartie role to the next level with an opportunity to ""reset"" his character here and even Shirley Manson, surely the biggest question mark of the casting selection, absolutely astonishes with her portrayal of a T1000 (liquid metal Terminator).

Naturally the restrictions of television budgeting result in a program that's not quite as visually stunning as the recent films of the franchise, it is very possible that it looks as good as, if not better than some of the earlier movies.  When T2 hit theaters, the whole ""liquid metal"" element was simply mind-blowing and Season 2 demonstrates the tactic ever-bit as well and as casually as if it were old hat.

Even so, the program ranks as among the best of the best of CG-heavy action on television. Just like with the films, massive explosions and gunfights abound with dark, moody environments and tones.  While it would be easy for the show's creators to fall into a rhythm based upon what's worked thus far, major kudos go out for the decision to keep the characters' whole world an ever-changing affair (just as it should be given the back story of living off the grid, always on the run).

The Dolby Digital audio is mixed quite solidly as well, which is a treat considering how solid the visuals turned out. The sound follows the onscreen action with near feature film precision and though a bit front-loaded to compensate for the abundance of dialog, the use of 5.1 Surround is particularly noteworthy.

In addition to a full-color booklet with episode synopsis, the extras (spread across the full 6 discs) include:

 ""The Continuing Chronicles: Terminator"", an 8-part featurette gallery
 The Storyboard Process: Cameron Goes Bad
 Gag Reel
 Cameron vs. Rosie Fight Rehearsal
 Commentary on ""Samson and Delilah""
 Commentary on ""Allison From Palmdale""
 Commentary on ""Adam Raised a Cain""
 Commentary on ""Born to Run""
 Terminated Scenes on Select Episodes

Just like with the first set, perhaps my biggest complaint is the mental overload of the source material's heavy reliance upon time travel.  If you really want to be a stickler, there are a few plot holes and mismatches that rear their ugly heads when laid out against the movie's timeline but in all honesty, and considering the overwhelming ambitions in sorting it all out, the television crew does an admirable job of keeping it straight.

About the biggest tragedy surrounding the whole affair is that the series does not end conclusively as again, it was cancelled before the production team could tie up all of the loose ends.  As it stands (and fortunately) the 22nd (and final) episode does not end on a cliffhanger per se, it just boggles the mind to consider where the writers were going next.  Considering that the program was nominated (and won) countless awards from the likes of the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, Emmy, People's Choice, Teen Choice, Visual Effects Society, and Young Artists Awards, the credentials speak far louder than any network's poor decision-making.  It's nearly impossible to come away from the second season without concluding that the series was just starting to find its rhythm.  It's sad that the show got the ax (especially considering how much junk was renewed) but I suppose the good news is that the Second Season box set is a beautiful addition to any library and a chance to own one of few truly impressive network television efforts of recent times.",1258848000,2,5400,5.012318029115342

In general since the first ""Terminator"" the notion of the ""Time Paradoxon"" has never been evaluated, so that people can understand what it means to travel back in time and to change something. Everything stays always on one level of a perceived reality. Terminator and The Sarah-Connor-Chronicles are shallow action movies with a lot of violence, stupid dialogs and a storybook that is in stellar distance off reality even in the Science Fiction Genre that in my opinion it is a waste of time and money.

3459450,4,B001AQR3J4,I really like it I am a fan of Terminator Movies I was 10 when T 1 came out and my wife and I really enjoy watching this TV series. We loved season 1 and Season 2 is even better. I am in a way sad that they did not continue but with the turn that T 4 took and the possibility of doing a new series in the future as well as T 5 and T 6 on the way I think that I am going to see plenty of Terminators in the future. Plus this serie had a time limit as it was between T 2 and T 3 so it could not be too long. In any case I enjoy the special effects and the characters and the way they interacts as well as the new characters that were not in the original. They definitely did a great job and I am very happy to have bought this series. We own both seasons.,1256860800,,753,3.5421686746987953
3459451,5,B001AQR3J4,"We have waited for shows this good, hoped, dreamed and hoped some more for shows this good.  Finally, there is a show this good: Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Season 2.

TSCC has all the explosions, chases and tension you expect from action packed Science Fiction.  That would just make it typical.  But, it is so much more.  TSCC is so well written, so well acted, directed and photographed that you can watch it over and over again and still find new things to enjoy about each episode.  The dialog is witty and entertaining and the interactions between principals are so well played that you will feel as though you actually know this family.  Headley and Dekker mother/son relationship is especially well played and enjoyable. After you have watched the overall story, you will go back and re watch those episodes, and like a fine Burgundy that opens up in the glass, you will be able to savor new layers of entertainment that you were too excited to appreciate the first time through.  The luxury of re watching on DVD will allow you to appreciate the subtle interactions between the cast like the tiny glances and facial expression between actors that add so much to the viewers sensory experience.  Also there are special features included that are informative and very enjoyable. You will see that there are more things to enjoy than explosions, such as, Headley and Dekker's mother/son relationship. They play extremely well together.

Another treasure, is Summer Glau's depiction of a Terminator.  As she mentioned in Season 1, she's ""Different"", to say the least. It is entertaining to watch her switch programming algorithms and go from high school sweetheart to amoral killing machine.  As lovely and kind as Ms. Glau probably is in real life, she has scenes where her Terminator will frighten you.

After watching both seasons on TV I did not hesitate to purchase the DVD and I have never done that for a TV show before.  Buy the DVD you won't regret it and you too will be waiting breathlessly for Season 3, TSCC",1256774400,2,2038,4.802292263610315
3459452,5,B001AQR3J4,"What is Terminator?
What is it about?

Seems like opinions about this questions differ heavily.
For me the Terminator Saga always was a story about Sarah Connor and her life that was changed back in 1984 and her alteration that won't mix up with our society.

Of coure there was action Arnold and of course Jim Cameron has the capability to mix both parts to a compelling movie above everyone else. This succeded two times with a bigger focus on the charakter part in the second movie.

This is where TTSCC comes in the game and it does it brilliant. The writers had a complex scheme of what they were about to acomplish whith the charakters that was only held of by some executives that wanted the ""Terminator of the week"" which was cool in some ways but got me bored and pleased that they kicked this kind of episodes aside.

The story is epic and extremely well written and the charakters are amazing. Special effects are good and loads of cameos to Camerons Terminator appear.

Since the decided to do a side story leaving the nice but expendable T3 aside you'll get the after T2 life in a very detailed way.

Who loves Terminator and the Charakters and wants to know what happend next to T2 and doesen't expect T4 in an action way gets maybe the best Sci-fi show that I have seen in a decade.

3459453,3,B001AQR3J4,"I was really excited to find out that they were gonna make a second run of the show, but when i watched it I was disappointed. There was nothing really new here and all the conspiracy/suspicious activities were kind of getting old now...It was really cool in the first season, because it was all new in a new episode-ical format, but after the first season, I think it was more of the same stuff and not enough of innovative plot twists or conflicts. I thought the only time I was really interested was when Cameron went out of control and the towards the end (SPOILER ALERT!!!) when little John gets transported to the future causing a shift in the time; but since that took place in the last episode of season two, it could not be fully explored.",1256428800,2,748,4.427536231884058
3459454,3,B001AQR3J4,"I was going to buy this anyway, I am a Terminator collector.  I'm going to watch it (and somewhat enjoy it) anyway.  But I can see why it was cancelled.
The storyline just gets all muddied and is all over the place.  It's like the writers had a block and decided to fill up the season with fluffy storylines (like Cameron's <the cyborg, no less!>  identity problems) and nothing to advance the story.  Sometimes fluff helps with character development but this fluff makes you like the characters less.  They took away the narrative Sarah Connor, and even the script for her makes her seem weak and annoying (as she dotes over her teenage son a bit too much).
They had such a great potential to make the newer characters (Agent Ellison, Reese's brother, and Charlie the Paramedic) move the story along with their own story, but the writers must've been drunk on those days.  And to make things worse, they added characters and storylines that were useless and downright annoying.  I know this is sci-fi, but when some girl seeks out and wants to constantly hang out with a guy with a personality of a piece of wood (the Riley/John story) its just NOT believable.  And the neighbor with the baby, what a waste of time.  And the most confusing thing they put in there was the Weaver character/story.  It wasn't the viewers lost interest; it was that the people responsible for the story just let it go.
What happened to that human, sinister, exciting show of last season?  I want those elements back!  I tried to tune in to those shows and watched them again after I purchased the first season.  The second season I was quite okay with just waiting till it came out on DVD and watching it whenever I get to it.",1256256000,4,1707,4.5359477124183005
3459455,5,B001AQR3J4,"This show was a pleasant surprise from start to finish. I have re-watched the entire series as it's a lot to remember, lots going on in all the 31 episodes. I personally found all 31 episodes to be brilliant, I would say Season 2 is a tincy better than Season 1. It's just for me, Season 2 is better because there is more, more action, more story. I was concerned going into this series that it would be a repeat of the quite tedious third installment of the franchise [Terminator 3] which was just action, no substance at all. I'm pleased to say this show isn't bang, bang, crash, bang, wallop like Terminator 3 is. I think people who aren't sure about checking out this series should give it a chance because I didn't think i'd like it but I've loved it from start to finish. I will say though in some episodes of Season 2 they were a tad slow but they were still really good episodes.

The finale didn't go well with me the first viewing as it all happenned all so quickly. Having re-watched the finale quite a few times now I do understand the finale a lot more and do like it a lot opposed to my original reaction [which was ""That's it, come on""]. I do think it would be nice to see a third season but in my honest opinion I think it all wraps up nicely so.... if a third season doesn't happen i'm not completly angry about it. I do think it's a shame that the show has been cancelled because I don't watch TV really, there's nothing really any good on now and sarah connor was the only thing I watched every week that was very consistent.

I think what's amazing is that the show's quality is very consistent throughout. I love all the actors in it. British actress Lena Headey is amazing as Sarah connor in my opinion. All the others, Thomas Dekker, Summer glau, Richard T. Jones, Shirley Manson, Leven Rambin [Riley, yes, i do like her character un-like some people]. The only character I didn't like was Jeese, Derek's girlfriend. If no-one has watched the series, I suggest you walk away as I'm about to spoil something. Ok..... Jeese in my opinion shows her true colours in the last few episodes we see her. I found her to be a bitch to be honest and I'm glad Derek broke up with her as I think she deserved it after killing Riley. Cold cow [Jesse].

I liked the Riley character to be honest, I found her quirky [but in a good way] quote ""I thought 'cos you were weird you would get me"" [to John]. I love her humour, she's so funny in my opinion ""They're too nice, they're aliens"". I agree with that people can be honest and express what they feel but I personally don't see what lots of people say about her character, I think she's a great character. I do think the actress who played Jeese did a good job with the character at the end of the day, so.... I don't think i was supposed to like her given the actions she did later on. I didn't mind her originally, I think her character is brilliant in Episode 9[Complications] of Season 2 when she interrogates a person she thinks is Charles Fisher from the future. She really showcases the bad-ass side that Sarah connor has. Having said that, this trait lasts with Sarah throughout the entire season and not the same for Jesse. I think Sarah connor is a likable person in the series, you can see she's very emotional at times, she can kick ass too [which is great to see]. The special effects are surprisingly very good for a TV show, the plotlines are fantastic, the pace is brilliant and overall it's a real treat from start to finish [wish it didn't have to end but doesn't everything have to, lol].

All in all, It's a great show. Great blu-ray, it works on a PS3 [Europe/UK PS3] fine [I'm from the U.K., not from the U.S.]. I don't want to spoil anymore because some much goes on in the show and yup..... 5 stars all the way [well deserved imho].",1255996800,,3814,4.307799442896936
3459456,5,B001AQR3J4,"Season 2 is superbly written.  Right from the start you have major suspense drama with Camrens chip being broken.  All this even though season 1 was NOT supposed to end where it did.  This show does an amazing job on a lmited budget.  The first episode featured a crashing car everyone almost getting killed explosions and the like.  The series continues with some amazing back story on Jeese Derek and an interesting twist on Riley.  The three dots plotline might have been the weak point and I thought the show was building up slowly to a climax.  well about four episodes out from the season finale(I won't say series because savethescc is trying to bring the show back) I thought we had reached teh climax and every episode after that TOOK my BREATH away.  The suprise death in the next to last episode made me wonder, how could they possibly top this episode was dramatic license.  Well the series finale did it.  With an ending that left you needing, not wanting, needing more TSCC because theres no way they could leave us with a cliffhanger like that one.

3459457,3,B001AQR3J4,"was it the name that kept it from getting another shot?  Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.  yes, it's a mouthful.  but maybe that's a small thing in the grand scheme of things.  so, was it the horrible and confusing ending?  no, the decision not to green light season 3 was probably made before the last couple episodes aired.  perhaps it was because The Mouthful pulled too many punches?

if the writers of this show wanted to keep people watching, they would have gotten to the thing we were all thinking about... does/will John Connor have sex with Cameron.  because isn't the relationship between them one of the main plot points of season 2?  a couple brief love scenes every episode would have assured itself a spot in next year's tv lineup. it kept BSG going even when that show sucked.

a few episodes were fantastic, but many of them were merely decent.  the wrong people died and that probably soured some of the audience.  i love a really dark show (like Blake's 7), but it just didn't feel right here.  the darkness was... incongruent.  Sarah was altogether too whiny and angry while Catherine Weaver was too mysterious and robotic (neither in the good way).  now we may never know what happens after the time-screw cliffhanger B.S. at the season's end.

basically, season 2 needed one final edit to make it shine.

In this sense it is comprehensible to anyone who is slightly familiar with the Terminaor franchise from the movies. It does differ in a number of ways but is still close enough in spririt. The addition of Shirley Manson (from Garbage) as an additional cast member is excellent and well thought out. The show was apparently recently cancelled and while it is excellent the reasons are probably in its excellence; the series portays a very bleak reality and the very life-like characters are not that glamorous as usually characters are on TV.

3459475,5,B001AQR3J4,"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles was truly great television. I use the past tense appropriately since Fox has seen fit to cancel one of the best dramas on TV. There were so many things right about this show. The acting by all involved was excellent. The stories were well thought out, held your interest, and actually involved IDEAS! the show made you think about issues and possibilities. The themes were so compelling that they have entered into our culture. I recently saw a program (on the History Channel I believe) about ten things that could lead to the destruction of humanity. One of them was the development of machine artificial intelligence. This program was not a fantasy, but a thoughtful exploration of the risks that face us in the future. On the Military Channel, there was a program about the research going on at present to develop humanoid soldier robots for our military who have enough intelligence to function independently of a human controller. That means the KILL/NO-KILL decision would be left up to the machine. In both of these programs, the Terminator movies were mentioned as examples of what could be. Numerous other themes were explored in this series, but in the interest of brevity I won't repeat what others have already written. A previous reviewer spoke about whether a machine could ever actually be taught to love or is it just all programming. Does it really matter? The Turing Test tells us that when a machine imitation of anything is so good that humans are essentially unable to tell the difference between the machine's responses and that of a human, it no longer matters.

The cancellation of dramas like this one by network executives is an example of capitalism at its worst. It is clear that in American industry (including the entertainment industry), NOTHING matters but the bottom line. All TV shows are viewed simply as containers for commercials. If the show doesn't draw enough viewers during broadcast, it is killed, no matter what other value it may have. Fans of a particular show or viewers interested in quality programming may fuss and fume, write reviews on Amazon, write letters to the network, but it doesn't matter. As the networks execs view it, that stuff doesn't bring home the bacon. Remember, the mantra of all American industries is ""SHOW ME THE MONEY!""

So, I have a suggestion to make to the execs who run these networks. It may appeal to their robber-baron mentality. If you have a really great show that has a solid fan base but just isn't generating the revenue from commercials, why not consider continuing to make the show, but sell it by subscription. Look at how many people are buying the DVDs of the Sarah Connor Chronicles. How many of them would be willing to sign up to receive regular mailings of new episodes on DVD for a reasonable price. I'd be willing to pay $50 or even $75 a year to receive new episodes on DVD. That doesn't sound like much, but when you multiply it by 400,000 or so, it starts looking a lot more attractive. It turns my stomach to say this, but someone in accounting at the network will immediately think of it: you could even put a few commercials on the DVD. Please, please put them all at the beginning or end and don't interfere with the pacing of the show that is so important in a drama.

There may be questions about whether the public would be willing to subscribe like this. It will depend on whether or not the producing organization is able to keep the price reasonable. I would suggest tying it to the going price of a movie. For example, if the average price of a movie is $8 to $10, and the average movie is two hours in length, then you could charge $50 for 10 hours of the subscription show. This would allow the salvation of some really good art, for I believe that a good drama like T:TSCC is art. The TV execs could even pretend that they cared about things like art, even though we all know that is bull.",1254960000,3,3942,4.636623748211731

3459510,5,B001AQR3J4,"Sarah Connor (Lena Heady) will do anything to protect her son John (Thomas Dekker), the future savior of the human race. The machines know about John, and have been sent back to terminate him before Judgment Day. There is also Cameron (Summer Glau), a machine sent back to the past to protect him. But Cameron seems to have another agenda as well. And joining the team on a regular basis this season is John's uncle Derek Reese (Brian Austin Green).

Settled in a new safe house, Sarah begins having visions, starting an obsession with a symbol of 3 dots.  John's relationship with his girlfriend Riley develops, and Cameron seems jealous. But Riley is revealed to be working with Derek's old flame, who has a mission of her own.  Meanwhile, Agent James Ellison (Richard T. Jones) is hot on the trail of the Connors.

The Connors kill the terminator Cromartie (Garret Dillahunt) that has been following them since last season. But someone has plans for the body. Shirley Manson comes on the scene as liquid terminator Catherine Weaver, a soulless machine that kills without a thought. Catherine uses the dead terminator's body to build a new AI, named John Henry. But Catherine doesn't seem to be sent back to kill John Connor. Instead, her focus is on John Henry and helping him learn what it means to be human. The characters are all perfectly cast. But Dillahunt's change from killer to new AI innocence steals every scene that he's in. And Manson's portrayal of the liquid terminator is always chilling.

The second season of the Sarah Connor Chronicles was even better than the first. With new mysteries, more danger, and John trying to break free of his mother's shadow.  Sarah and John are still trying to stop SkyNet before Judgment Day comes. Everyone has their own agenda. And each episode is more exciting and thrilling than the last. This was easily one of the best shows on television last year.

Unfortunately, Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles was not renewed for a 3rd season. And the end of season 2 leaves us with an enormous cliffhanger, where John travels to the future, where Cameron seems to be human and Derek doesn't recognize John.

I would have rated it lower if it weren't for the outstanding Samson & Delilah episode which has the best TV car chase of all time (Director David Nutter). Self Made Man is also much watch; like any classic episode of Star Trek Next Gen it had good morals, tommy gun action, and a crazy scifi plot. Mid-season production got lazy and did not use enough endoskeleton FX which Terminator was famous for. The blood curdlingly terrifying endo scenes were gone, replaced with wacky stunt(wo)men & a few gun fights. When the show was good it was REALLY GOOD and when it got bad/boring it unfortunately was a greater percentage of the time. Writing got corny. They changed Cameron too much and brought her out of line with the movies. I loved watching how sexy summer is in every scene, but I felt they kept her akin to Small Wonder's Vickie; a dumb robot. The nail in the coffin was the multiple character death. Every person I cared for dies. They didn't have the guts to kill bad guys or show the bad guys interact with John & crew throughout the entire 21 episode season!! Even worse was when the good guys started torturing people  (no joke!) for info and there was more than one episode in which they attend a funeral (why???). The writers even kill off an innocent dog.  Whoever gained the most creative control during season 2 is a sick person. I was scratching my head a lot, not for the plot, but at how destructive the writers became. I honestly believe the producer saw the end coming and decided to trash it all, despite what was said. Season 2 is in sharp contrast to all the cool hacks, computer chips, time travel, and endoskeleton stuff that was in season one. While I liked ALL of season one in its entirety, I think I enjoyed 4 episodes of this. But I did enjoy those 4 eps very much. If you saw season 1 you probably need to know what happens and should get this.

I want to love it. I recognize the great talent and time involved: Thomas Dekker, Brian Austin Green, and Garrett Dillahunt singularly keep the show alive. Lena Headey as Sarah was mixed. The T&A in season 2 is great but it comes where you'd least expect: the underutilized would-be superstar characters (Chola, Jesse, Riley). On the positive you'll find out what happens and watch something better than T4. You will also watch some rediculously awesome TV and hear some good music. I love Sarah Chronicles, but I'm reluctant to give this the full recommendation as I feel the creative & production talent, besides the actors and Bear McCreary (the composer), weren't truly on board for Terminator.",1253836800,3,2634,4.541052631578947
3459513,5,B001AQR3J4,"It's a shame this show hasn't lived to realize its own potential. TSCC broke the mold of other FOX shows with a decidedly dark tone and a well-written, complex plotline involving many characters. Every character in the show you grow to love, and sometimes simultaneously hate.

The show was canceled due to its awkward airing time making it only accessible to some people via Hulu. FOX gets little money from airing it on Hulu, so the project was scrapped. It is possible, however, that the powers that be will recognize the fans immense efforts to get the show renewed and concede with at least a comic or direct-to-dvd movie.

Why does TV kill the best sci-fi out there? TSCC has made so much improvement of the the second season. Between Lena, Summer and Garrett - this show was absolutely brilliant. Fast paced, action packed and deep emotional pull made this one of the best TV shows of the year and one of my all time favorite shows ever. Join the Resistance.

3459515,4,B001AQR3J4,"It's hard to figure out why ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" lost its audience. Perhaps it's the lack of humor (although there is some dark humor in the series)or perhaps it just didn't have enough variety for most people in the story department. Either way when Fox moved the series to Fridays (any show on Friday is making a slow death march towards cancellation the only exception to that rule was ""The X-Files"").That's a pity because the show demonstrated a knack for sharp, intelligent writing, action and was amazingly well made. The first season ran into a few minor road blocks with the first being the Writer's Strike which meant season one was cut short. The second season had some terrific episodes (and yes some of them had humor--albeit dry or dark humor but humor)and ""Terminator"" like its sister series ""Fringe"" had terrific production values making it a joy to watch.

The second season of ""Terminator"" dovetailed nicely with the four movies. The second season although it became a bit uneven towards the middle of the season picked up with a strong five final episodes. The cliffhanging grand finale also kicked butt but unfortunately we're not going to find out how the show was going to be resolved (Producer/writer John Middleton had plans to create a series of two hour movies to conclude the show but unfortunately that seems less and less likely although if this sells well enough who knows?).

The Blu-ray looks stunning with a sharp, detailed image rivaling the best transfers I've seen.""Write the Future"" features writer-producer-show developer Josh Friedman discussing how he came up with the story arc and individual episode plots for the second season.

We get a number of commentray tracks including one on the second season opener featuring actors Thomas Dekker,Lena Headey, Summer Glau, actress/singer Shirley Manson and writer-producer Josh Friedman.

""Blood and Metal"" focuses on make up artist Rob Hall and how he creates the make up effects for the show.

Although the show loses a bit steam mid-season it regains it by the handful of final episodes and suggests that there was a lot of potential for this show. It's a pity it was terminated.

""Designing Destruction"" lets Production Designer Marek Dobrowolski take center stage showing his designs for some of the futuristic sets and how he integrates real locations into the series.

""Choreographing Chaos"" has 2nd Unit Director Joel Kramer and Special Effects Supervisor Steve Galich talking about and demonstrating how they create the imaginative stunts for the show without putting anyone in harm's way.

""War Stories"" isn't about the imaginary future but, instead, has production crew discuss the challenges they faced in creating a science fiction show on time, often on location and on budget. For example, there was an unexpected earthquake that disrupted shooting on one day and they had to figure out a way to safely shoot the underwater sequences that appear during the second season on a their budget.

""Motivations""  lets the producers discuss the themes of season two.

""Cameron vs. Rosie: Fight Rehearsal"" gives us behind-the-scenes footage of the choreography sessions for the major fight involving Summer Glau . All I can say is that there is an amazing contortionist involved.

""Setting the Tempo"" lets music composer Bear McCreary (""Battlestar Galatica"") discuss how he develops many of the music cues for the series. Shirley Manson (of the band Garbage and one of the series regulars) performs on the opening season song ""Samson and Delilah"" and she discusses working with McCreary.

""The Storyboard Process"" takes us behind-the-scenes and lets us see the development of key sequences from the second season and how they were realized.

We get a gag reel and finally audio commentary on key episodes by stars Lena Headey, Thomas Dekker, Summer Glau, Shirley Manson along with writer-producer Josh Friedman and producers James Middleton and John Wirth.

Finally the Blu-ray has an exclusive interactive special feature ""Collision with the Future: Deconstrutcting the Hunter Killer Attack"". It allows viewers to take a look at the individual elements from a variety of views.

I'd suggest starting with the brief first season of the show before starting with this set (although the first season is nicely recapped in a 45 second introduction to the first episode of this season). The second season continues the story set up during season one--Sarah Connor (Lena Headey-""300""), her son John (Thomas Dekker), Cameron (Summar Glau-""Firefly"", ""Serenity"" and ""The 4400"") a Terminator from the future sent back to protect John and Reese (Brian Austin-Greene the original ""Beverly Hills 90210"") are trying to unravel the technological thread that allowed Skynet to take over the world and nearly make humanity extinct by going after the people and companies that developed the AI intelligence. They face a new threat from the CEO (Garbage singer Shirley Manson)of a company that is trying to develop the technology of that will help lead to the possible extinction of mankind.",1253664000,6,5084,5.174177831912302
3459516,5,B001AQR3J4,"I am undeniably a child of the eighties, growing up going to theaters to watch movies like ""Jurassic Park"", ""Stargate"", ""Deep Impact"" and ""Independence Day."" But one particular sci-fi film stands out.  I went in 1991 to see ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" with my dad and older brother and being only 10 felt like a BIG GUY; going to see an ""R"" rated film in the Theaters with my male family members.  The thing was that the film scared the ever living snot out of me! It also intrigued me, and captivated me and surprised me and had me cheering and sitting on the edge of my seat.  So, dad took me home and showed me the first one; which scared me even more and yet I was captivated by the whole aspect of these machines who looked SO incredibly like US! And the struggle that WE went through against them and also with them.  I always thought it would make a FANTASTIC t.v. show! But all I got in the subsequent years following ""T2"" was ""T3: Rise of the Machines"", which had a fantastic female teminator, a fantastic ending, but a horrendous premise and first 2/3's!  So, when I heard about ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"", I was 100% along for the ride from day one...

I was only scared of one thing, that the show would follow ""T3"", but after hearing who they hired for John and that it was set shortly after ""T2"" my fears were gone.  Then just to seal the deal, I heard that Summer ""Wow"" Glau, my favorite TV hottie was cast as the new Terminator, I was pumped. Needless to say, Season One did not disappoint.

I felt that the show was a strong breath of fresh air, instead of what many thought it would be; ""Terminator of the week chase and escape"", we got a well thought out intensely character driven show, that made you use your brain.  Yep, I said it.  In a world of ""American Idol"", ""Ugly Betty"", ""Desperate Housewives"", and about 10,000 reality shows there are very few shows with a brain.  ""CSI"", ""Fringe"" and ""Lost"" being two rare exceptions.

In what started out as a chase show, smartly steered away as John, Sarah and Cameron (Thomas Dekker, Lena Headey and Summer Glau respectively) decided to find away to shut it down, and that lead to them:
- Going to the future/present
- Creating a few well thought out time paradox's
- Getting the FBI on their tale
- Causing a few innocent deaths
and a few other choice incidents, but just like on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Battlestar Galactica"" choices had consequences, even choices like going to pick up a birthday cake.

Picking up said cake is where we leave the crew at the end of season one, Derek Reese; Kyle Reese (John's father)is introduced near the end of season one and brings a fantastic dynamic, spreading a small seed of untrust between John and Cameron.  Cameron gets into their SUV and BOMB! See you next season.

The seeds laid in season one are just the ground work for what would have become an ICONIC show if Fox had given ""T:TSCC"" the time to grow.  What we see in Season Two are the first blooms of the tree that is planted.  Regular and trusted characters aren't always meant to be trusted. Damage can't always be fixed; figuratively or physically. Being the good guys is in the eye of the beholder, and many other things are looked at in this season.

The main focus is on John's loosing trust in his mother, then his loosing trust in Cameron and finally realizing that he must stop hiding behind others and take the forefront.  We follow Cameron on an arc of self discovery, can she really love John or is it all a programmed lie, and who was the woman that she was modeled after?  We see where Dereks intense distrust of Cameron comes from, and find out a few secrets of his own. And what of Ellison? Is he good, bad, neither?

We're introduced to some Fantastic new characters.  Lead singer of Garbage; Shirley Manson takes on the role of Katherine Weaver a CEO of a powerful computer industry who holds a big secret of her own.  Stephanie Jacobsen is sexy and misunderstood as Jesse who's story, because of the show's cancellation, will never be fully explained, wash she good or bad? What's here ""REAL"" fate? Levin Rambin is fantastic as Riley, Johns new love interest who; as with everyone else has her own agenda and secrets to keep.

The action of season two was amped up, as were the effects, due to the addition of a T-1000 to the cast, and the Connor gangs attempts at finding pieces to the puzzle of what is happening; we have many great new effects.  The look of the new HK (Hunter Killer) that plays a large role in the middle and end of the season; looks just as good as it's big screen counterparts.  The T-1000's morphing scenes and action scenes are fantastic as well.

Josh Freidman is such a fantastic story craftsman, he knows how shows usually play it and he goes the opposite way half the time and then when we expect him to do one thing, out of the clear blue, something else.  Watch the episode ""Adam Raised A Cain"" and ""Today is the Day Parts I and II"". No one is safe in this world, and death even the deaths of our lead cast are not forbidden. In fact, they start to drop like flies in the final four episodes, leading to what I consider to be one of the best season/series finales of all time. It's just a shame the show was cancelled, what was given to us in season two was magnificent.  Maybe somehow in the near future, we as fans will get a third season, maybe on another channel or online, who knows.  ""The future isn't set"".",1253577600,3,5457,4.411764705882353

First, I'm all for strong women & women's independence and all that..., hell, some of my best friends are strong and independent women, starting with my momma & big Sis. But c'mon folks, I for one can't keep taking the blue pill! How many times is a 96 pound woman gonna kick the living stuffing outa a 250 lbs special forces trained bad guy without getting even one little scratch! And the lil momma's-boy is just to old for momma to be tryna save his bacon all the time! He's too old! Old enough to be leading the way & saving mamma's lil keister once in a while, dont-cha think. Oh yeah, and Sarah aint Arnie! So quit with the corny one liners written for him... coming outa the mouth of a 96lb woman or man it reeks of cornball machismo, and it's boring. I wish Hollywood could get it through their heads that a strong, independent woman does not have to be a man in drag, or act like one! A woman can be strong and feminine at the same time! Their strength is different, but equally potent to a man's, so stop writing strong women as women with gender identification  issues!  So, nice try, I have the 1st season on DVD and have already ordered the 2nd season, but lets face it... this stink bomb was doomed from the start, and I for one am NOT looking for a 3rd season.",1253491200,3,1477,4.178947368421053

3459540,5,B001AQR3J4,"The Terminator Series really ticked all the boxes. Superb acting, storylines, it took the cheesy gimmick script and storyline of T3 and said ""to hell with it!""
I eagerly awaited each new episode of The Sarah Connor Chronicles during its sophomore season with more gusto than I did LOST.

An epic web of mythology is created in season 2, the idea of multiple versions of the future becomes the main focus, with almost all of the 22 episodes executing a strong amount of intrigue, in a much more intelligent style than the ""Terminator-of-the-week"" format of season 1.

With the show tanking in the ratings but earning it all back in DVR (damn the target audience for being so web-savy!) the show was cancelled in favour of Dollhouse, which, while not a better quality product in comparison, is Joss Whedon's latest baby and FOX kinda owed him after screwing him round last time...

HOWEVER - there is a chance that in the style of another sci-fi epic, Battlestar Galactica, Terminator TSCC could be revived in the form of the DVD Movie. After the epic conclusion of Season 2, its what fans want!
But from a business standpoint, no one will sign off on that unless interest is still there.
What we need to do is buy this boxset, show the world what a fantastic fanbase this show has - because however we accessed the show when it originally aired, the format that binds us all together is home video!

3459542,5,B001AQR3J4,"Words, words, words.  They are difficult to contain the love I have for this series.  This love also comes with a broken heart.  It's cancellation hurts more than anything that has ever been canceled.  I can't believe it.

This series, its characters, its story: ICONIC.  This is a half told story.  This was Josh Friedman's Terminator story.  It is the greatest.  And I love him for it.  It is the greatest, and I love it, and they killed it.  The only hope I see for its return is if the sales for Season 2 on September 22 are monumental.  The sales would speak volumes and get attention.  It's the only way I see.  They need Josh Friedman to make the other two seasons to finish the story.

As for this particular product: Season Two.  BUY IT.  That is all.  The entire series resonates that feeling that Terminator 2 had about humans and artificial intelligence views of life, how we are different and similar, how a machine can learn the value of human life and a how a human can be cold and heartless.  Every episode of this series had me either near tears or silently crying by the end of every one of them.  It's beautiful and the love that went into this series with the end result is truly an under-appreciated accomplishment.

If James Cameron views this series, I truly believe he would be very proud.  (This is the real Terminator 3.  It follows T1 and T2.
T3 and Salvation is just an alternate continuation of the story, it has nothing to do with The Sarah Connor Chronicles.)

Buy The Terminator on Blu-Ray.  Buy Terminator 2: Judgment Day on Blu-Ray.  Buy Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles Season One and Season Two on Blu-Ray.  Then you have yourself the complete story (so far, if it ever returns).

Season 2 does have a very appropriate ending.  It's beautiful as the last moment of the series.  But knowing there was more coming and it getting canceled shatters the heart.  It reverberates that something special in the middle of its productivity is now dead before it could reach its untold, mysterious conclusion.

I declare this possibly my favorite series ever.

Watch T1, T2, T:TSCC Season 1, and T:TSCC Season 2.  In that order.  And you have yourself one of the most important and beautifully imagined stories ever told.

I'll admit that I watch very little TV. I only started watching The Sarah Connor Chronicles because Garbage frontwoman Shirley Manson joined the cast for the second season. I hadn't even seen the Terminator movies. The show totally blew me away and I got hooked catching up on season 1. It's become an obsession and I can honestly say I've never connected with a TV show like I have with The Sarah Connor Chronicles.

Fox canceled the show way too soon and fans are rallying at [...] The future is not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves.",1249776000,4,1142,4.781725888324873
3459546,5,B001AQR3J4,"Like Fox has done show after show they've created another brilliant TV show only to end it right when the going gets good. Fox is truly a network that cares nothing about the quality of the show or the viewer enjoyment but only about the ratings, which is why with the end of TSCC I am refusing to watching anything on Fox anymore.

Speaking as someone who didn't enjoy the Terminator films, I watched the show only on a whim since everyone who I knew who had watched it loved it to pieces, I soon found myself joining that group shortly after the first episode. TSCC may be the only show that had a Cyborg/robot portrayed so realistic that your baffled when you see the person who plays the Cyborg outside of their role because they have emotions. Summer Glau who plays Cameron on TSCC really stole the show and just had me and a lot of other fans with her abilities. She lacks almost all emotions but at the same time you can tell she has something more then most of the other Cyborg/Robots shown in the show, most likely because of her interaction with humans and John trying so hard to break down everything so she can understand how a human works. TSCC became an instant favorite of mine and whenever you can bet whenever I meet anyone looking for a good show I tell them to watch it.

Season 2 was an amazing season and I really enjoyed how they developed the plot in many different ways. A lot of time when I would watch and episode I had no idea what was happening until the very end which was fun and challenging and had me trying to figure out what was going on before the end. I will admit the thing I like most about the show is watching John and Cameron interact and her becoming more human and trying to understand our ways, it really makes you think about what makes you, you.

Currently, the show hangs in the balance and though we all want a season 3 I hope that they do anything to a movie like they did for Firefly or a book series like they did for Dark Angel, anything to make the series live on. The fan-base for TSCC for amazing and with their efforts I have hope that the series will live on.

The moment TSCC comes out on DVD I advise all fans of the shows to buy it, it's something any Sci-Fi fan will miss having in their collection.",1249776000,5,2260,4.236658932714617
3459547,5,B001AQR3J4,"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, had a glaringly awkward name, and little chance to live up to the best the franchise had to offer, as far as I was concerned. To my shock and surprise however, it ended up being one of the most thoughtful, intelligent and intense shows on television. It did tend to lag at times, but this helped to build to the heart-wrenching choices and brutal confrontations the characters faced. The show was bleak, brooding, deep and at times had a great sense of dry humor. It's darkness and slow pace probably sealed its fate in the world of network television though, where only the base, boisterous and obvious get consistent attention.

This show took time with its plots, characters and scenes and it may have been a let down for those who came expecting nonstop explosions, gunfire and cyborg action. There was a good deal of this, but usually only when it was necessary. The rest of the time was spent developing the characters, their relationships and how they collectively dealt with not only being at the focal point of an oncoming human apocalypse, but also trying to stop it from happening, despite all of the issues that strained their strange family.

It was heartbreaking for this show to be canceled, but it at least ended in a way that provided some possible closure, if you used your imagination. This could certainly not be said for the ill-fated Firefly, a potentially brilliant series that Fox utterly betrayed. Despite its short run, I'm glad I got to see this excellent short-lived series. Perhaps, it would have had a full run on a cable network like HBO, but now I'm just dreaming about what could have been.

In any case, please watch this show. It is a brilliant example of how to create deep, moving human drama along with great sci-fi action.",1249689600,3,1802,4.732484076433121
3459548,2,B001AQR3J4,"Let's admit it, the only reason the Terminator franchise was good was because of James Cameron, once he left, it was a crapshoot at best, with most of the proceeding Terminator-related material being crap. Take Arnold out of it, and let's face it, you better have one heckuva great storyline & great characters. This show, unfortunately did not turn out this. Always miscast, Lena Hedley & Thomas Dekker bring a brooding whinyness to the series, with a distinct feel of emo. Sure, Summer Glau elevates the show, but she can only do so much. For the first season, I started out engaged, but as soon as I watched an episode back, I realized it was the drek that it was. Of course, by the time I realized this, I was already 8 episodes in, and it was too late to turn back. Going into the second year, it only got worse. I kept waiting for plotlines to go places, but they'd lose my attention before continuing it once more. I'd wait for action, but what there was, was disappointing at best. Make no mistake about it, TSCC is a sci-fi drama, but the drama is uninteresting & undramatic, and painfully bad at worst.

Maybe I didn't get it, and maybe I'm not emo enough to put up with the brooding and emoness, but Fox made the right decision here in not renewing it for a 3rd season. I'm sure all would have been fine once the storylines, and the show got where it wanted to go, but I imagine in the end we'd all be left wondering why we wasted so many precious hours. A cancellation Fox actually got right, who would have thought. Don't listen to the fanboys, this is not worth your time, because this show terminated so many hours of my life.

  A pox on Fox for their usual habit of miraculously coming out with a winner and then kicking the fan base in the teeth.

Whats even more of a phisher is that the writer or producer in interviews refused to even give some hint of where he wanted to take the show though Im sure he already had ideas. They could have given us that much.

3459593,4,B001AQR3J4,"This series started to very high ratings, was voted the best new dramatic series of the year.  It had a wealth of complex human and nonhuman characters involved in long intertwined thought provoking plots. Toward the end of its second season when it was reportedly being considered for cancellation it had huge and disproportional support from viewers.  In one poll of which of several ""on the bubble"" shows would you most like to see renewed, T:SCC got 2/3rds of the votes.  But it was canceled at the end of its second season.  So is it junk, or worth buy the disks to?

The series starts a few years after the second movie, and 2 years after the prophesied august '97 start date for SkyNet.  Sara is engaged and has been living in the same place for most of a year.  More psychologically stable then in the 2nd movie, strong and capable, but emotionally brittle, and sometimes more short tempered drill sergeant then mother to John.

John is then given a new identity, and starts a new school.  In one sense John is a standard 16 year old.  Brooding biter, and feeling alienated; but John can be forgiven for it, given he's been on the run all his life.  Bouncing between countries, and counties, he may be fated to be mankind's savior - but he's a outsider everywhere he goes. Always the creepy dark new kid in school getting beat up or avoided by locals, and never able to stand up for himself.  But in this school the pretty, warm and friendly Cameron Philips sparks up a friendship with him, and he starts opening up and the two start to bond.  Then he's attacked by a terminator and is rescued by Cameron.

Cameron is an advanced model terminator sent back to protect and help John - and is concealing some other personal motive.  But though very loyal, she won't always do what they want, and often lies.  Once the others know she is a terminator, she starts being more robotic and unemotional (at least around the Connors) even putting down John for thinking she was more then that- and going to strange lengths to try to distance John from her emotionally, but she can't pull it off, showing flashes of anger or frustration, cringing after being angrily rejected by someone she was trying to befriend, but instead frightened by trying to warn him his cancer was coming out of remission.  As a couple characters mention, you can tell a terminator by looking in their eyes.  The other terminators in the show all do display the dead eyes - but not Cameron.

>>Spoiler<<
In ""Allison from Palmdale"" a damaged Cameron believes she is Allison Young suffering amnesia.  Allison was/will be the future resistance officer captured and copied to make Cameron, but Cameron is remembering in nightmares Allison's imprisonment, interrogation, and escape attempt - from Allison's point of view.

They decide to time travel to the future (our present) to stop a future construction of SkyNet. But with technology progressed so much farther now then when the second movie was filmed, the new source of SkyNet appears to not be a massive Cyberdyne project under military contract, but a hobbyist building a better chess machine for a chess tournament, out of salvaged video game parts.  Having told a close friend in the future that he built SkyNet, said friend comes back and kills the hobbyist; but the prototype A.I. (The Turk) is first stolen for some one we find out is a liquid Metal terminator.

Said liquid metal terminator has assumed the identity of the executive Catherine Weaver, and with the Turk uses her company to build a ""world changing A.I.""  As expected for a terminator, those that object disappear.  Unexpected is that rather then working toward a more lethal SkyNet.  ""She's"" hiring psychologists, ethicists, and other people, to teach it morals, humor, etc.  Having it play with the original Catherine Weavers daughter.  Trying to teach it all the characteristics she and the other terminators lack -and vital to dealing with humans.  Why is suggested by the A.I.s later name - John Henry.  In the old story, John Henry killed himself to drill blasting holes in rock faster by his mussels, then the new steam drill could.  Perhaps a hint that SkyNet's war to destroy the humans is just destroying everything either side needs to survive.  As she develops John Henry (who develops as a very interesting character) she's under increasing assault, apparently from SkyNet forces.

>>spoiler<<
As the series concludes season 2, in a very strong 6 episode set, several threads come together.  John Connors future resistance doesn't seem to revere him as universally as might be assumed, sending back conspirators to manipulate him into having the biases they want against the ""metal"".  One conspirator had planed on provoking the others death to more strongly bias John.  But Cameron doesn't react the way she assumed, and her co-conspirator realizes she was to be killed.  Further John proves to be much more cunning aware of what was going on then anyone assumed.

The future fissure in the resistance seems to be exacerbated by Johns attempt to form a alliance with a resistance group of terminators, also fighting against SkyNet.  Jesse, and the crew of her submarine turned on the captain (a reprogrammed terminator) when they were being taken deep into ""metal"" territory, to pick up a box, later found to contain a liquid metal terminator (presumably Weaver).  Jesse eventually sides with the crew and mutinies and destroys the captain and sub in a futile attempt to destroy the liquid metal terminator - who was an envoy to start negotiations for a alliance with the resistance.  And during the episode their were discussion how in general people were fearful that John Connor was getting to comfortable with the reprogrammed terminators (especially Cameron who was always at his side), and possibly the machines were gaining power in the resistance.

After john in the series risks his life to rescue Cameron, she warns him that now they won't trust him - the ""they"" not being the current group.  Was Cameron pretending to not be as human as she is - for fear that John would get close to her, causing the resistance to break up - or never form?  Was that why in the end when Weaver passes on a phrase (join us) used by John in the future to start trying to form a alliance with the anti SkyNet terminators - Cameron is stunned, refuses to tell John what it means, and later has John Henry insert her cpu into himself - resulting in John Henry (with Cameron in him) use Weavers time machine to travel into the future?

>> End spoiler<<

The show ended on with season 2, half way through a planed 4 year story arc.  John and Weaver in the future.

What the writers planed to do from there is unknown.  Some interactions with John and Allison, and dealing with a future where the fate of humanity never rested on his shoulders.

Why did the show die?

When it was on its mark T:SCC did very well, and added far more depth then you'd think could be mined from the Terminator scenario, and suggesting even deeper complexities.

On the plus side when it was on its mark it did very well, and added far more depth then you'd think could be mined from the Terminator scenario, and suggesting far deeper complexities.  The relationship with Cameron and J Terminators are not simply the walking metal angels of death - nor even seem to hate or hold humans in contempt.  Mainly they are enslaved by programs driving them to do given missions and are simplistic about how to accomplish them.  mainly they seem confused with humans and don't know how to deal with them.

But the show didn't seem to focus on that.  It focused a lot on Sara Connor, but increasingly wrote her out of the main storylines, and off on her own dealing with internal demons or pointless side stories.  Bull headedly pushing forward alone.  Worse she was increasingly a antagonist, not a ally to John and Cameron.  Though Cameron had through the course of the series consistently tried to be a friend to Sara, even trying to rely on her.  Toward the end of the series Sara confronts Cameron, and almost sadistically tells her how she was thinking of killing her, and wouldn't be the slightest bit upset in doing so, but John cares about her to much.  Though Sara would be justified in being angry with the way Cameron was playing with, and hurting, John.  Having the show centered around a character who was increasingly not part of the core story, and who hates the most popular and core character in the show would obviously drive away viewers.

The producer seemed to realize this, and admitted his putting several Sara centric stories in the middle of the season would anger viewers, and that people didn't like his way of doing a terminator show, but he did it anyway.

Further while the series seemed to drag through the second season.  Often seeming to pad out the season with weaker episodes, it tended to raise and drop interesting side plots, like Derek having known Cameron before she was reprogrammed by the resistance.  Or it focused to much, and to sympathetically, on charters like the coolly evil Jesse that the audience hated.  Even most of the sub plots in season 2 were irrelevant given Johns traveling forward in time preempts the whole future of his resistance forces and their internal friction.

Also the production staff made mistakes.  Sloppy bits (which can throw off smart viewers being asked to get involved in a complex plot.)  In the pilot Sara is shot in the shoulder and requires surgery, but after a nights sleep she has no trouble handling heavy weapons, and her bared shoulder hasn't so much as a scratch.  In the pilot the attacking terminator is blown up just before they time travel; forward.  But then the detached fleshless head travels forward with then, powers up, and remote controls a distant body lost in a junkyard to seek it out and recover it.  (No Cyberdyne recovering and studying this terminator.  Even with a SWAT team seeing the partly defleashed terminator, and finding a partial endo-frame clad in flesh, its just thrown away - but never scraped or even buried deeply in the scrap yard.

And then there was bad luck.  Fox shifted the show from Monday night, to Fridays.  Fridays are extremely hard for struggling shows to get any audience in, and in this case it happened about when the series was running several Sara Connor eps.  So the show took a big ratings hit.  Further, its rumored Warner Brothers were discounting the series to Fox to act as a leed in to the Terminator: Salvation film - but with the film out (and doing very badly) next season Fox would need to pay for more for a very low rated series.  The last 6 eps were VERY strong and fast paced, and increased viewer ship, but by the time they aired the show had all but officially been canceled.

Would John have confronted Cameron and forced her to join him, or lost her in the future?  Would she have opened up about her feelings and motives, or pulled back in shock finding she'd destroyed the John Connor resistance she'd wanted to assure?  Would Weaver develop a respect and alliance with John, or decide he's expendable?

In the end its show with a lot of great plot threads and characters, and some extremely strong episodes, but you may want to fast forward though dull parts of other eps.  But pay attention to some of the details.",1246924800,3,11363,4.7132725430597775

I'm still asking that question. I've seen the Terminator movies, and then one day, I came across the show on Fox, and the first thing I saw was a Terminator holding Sarah Connor's neck. I kept it on, and that was the beginning of the first episode, and I watched all the episodes of the season from there. I was excited for this season 2, and it was very well done. After seeing that, I said, ""There's definitely going to be a third season to this show"". Well, that sucks. It didn't happen. If only there was a way to save this show from being canceled.

However, all the actors were great for their roles, more than good enough to make up for the shows flaws.  Their inter-personal conflicts added a lot to the storyline and would likely have been worth watching even without the suspense of the upcoming apocalypse and possible extinction of the human race.

The ending for this season was amazing, but I think that to have a finale like that and cancel the show before the story can be concluded in the next season is both cruel and stupid.  Especially with the big movie coming up, it has to increase interest in the tv show.  I think I'll buy this season used so that FOX doesn't get any of my money.  They don't deserve it.

Granted Terminator was a sci-fi show and they are risky these days. Furthermore it was continuing an established franchise in a different way. Let's face it though, T2 was marginally okay (Edward Furlong nearly ruined the entire movie) and T3 was terrible. TSCC was a huge improvement! With all the hype for the upcoming Terminator Salvation, I would have thought that Fox would wait to see the box office on that and then make their decision.

The decision to keep Dollhouse and cancel TSCC shows that Fox is going to bow down to Joss Whedon on name value alone, no matter what garbage he produces (I may be the only person not terribly impressed by him.)

I watch one show a week: Terminator: the Sarah Connors' Chronicles. Now, how valuable is having an audience that includes people who haven't watched serial television in the last 15 years.

I can't believe some of the shows that get booted and some that stay.  I just can't seem to comprehend.  Dollhouse is also not a good pairing for this show and Friday nights is not a good night for the show.  This isn't a Dollhouse review but I will state that Dollhouse is not a quality show.  I like Joss Whedon but Dollhouse has the quality and substance of a horrible Sci Fi Channel original movie.  Terminator should be renewed.

But, the Season Two Finale 'Born To Run' not only lived up to that level of quality and emotion, it surpassed it in every way possible.

Again, I was in tears.

I watch all of two shows on TV and TSCC is one of them.  If they cancel the series (which is rumored) and don't do a 3rd season then FOX just doesn't get it.

FOX moved this series to the Friday time slot and of course the ratings tanked.  The folks who watch this show are out on Fridays (dates, restaurant, partying, etc.) and either watch the show on Hulu or on their DVR later.  Viewers like these who don't or can't watch TSCC in real-time don't count on the ratings!

Summer Glau (most noted for the FireFly series) makes the show even more worth watching. She simply creeps me out as a terminator. My wife watches it too and she doesn't care for Sci-Fi.

3459757,5,B001AQR3J4,"I was unsure how Terminator: The Sarah Conner Chronicles was going to be able maintain interest through an entire season, much less an entire series. I now know how and have been pleasantly impressed. In Fact, I have become a devoted Follower.
Terminator: The Sarah Conner Chronicles has mixed Action, Drama, Science Fiction, Special Effects,Mystery, Timely Comic relief, even relationships into a powerful and compelling story line.  The Character development has been outstanding. The acting has been superb, Lena Heady has gives Sarah several new dimensions that were never possible in T-1 or T-2 and makes her a very strong but sympathetic character who has been through a great deal who is hard as a Navy Seal and has come out of it still grounded by a strong moral code and an intellect that makes her very dangerous. Thomas Dekker Portrays John Conner as a you would expect from a 16 year old who is trying to deal with the loneliness of an underground lifestyle, while dealing with the knowledge that he will be the ultimate general in a war to save his race's very  existence and the fact tht he will be responsible for sending many people to their death. We see him growing into that leader right before our eyes. Summer Glau gives us Cameron, the replacement for Arnold's Uncle Bob in T-2. Cameron gives us a terminator who sent to defend John and is learning to be more human with each episode. She is convincing in each role she takes on and gives us Terminator that many now think of when the word comes up. Just when you start thinking of her as almost human, she stuns you with a very cold or insensitive action reminding you that she is still the most dangerous character on the show. She is given most of the great one liners on the show.
I have shown Episode 1 of Season 1 to 7 of my guests over the past three months and they wouldn't let me shut off the disc player until they had sen all of the episodes, then the special features. The next day two of them ran out and bought Season 1 and the rest watch the show religiously. Give The series a chance and I am sure any SciFi or drama fan will agree and join the resistance. I highly recommend this series, Both season 1 and season 2.",1240012800,8,2205,4.4689826302729525

3459789,5,B001AQR3J4,"Season 1 of TSCC blew my expectations away at its fresh approach to the Terminator saga. The first 2 episodes were less than stellar and unfortunately caused many people to discontinue watching it before it got progressively better with each subsequent episode until it became FANTASTIC by season's end. James Ellison became my favorite character as he has a totally different take on the events that transpire than any of the other characters and introduces biblical prophecy into the mix of what is to come.

Season 2 has been a more personal study of the different characters and at the same time an enigma. After watching these characters for an entire season you actually find out WHO they really are in Season 2 and how they developed into their current personalities. We even find out about Cameron's(John Connor's Terminator Protector) backstory and even about the human she was modelled after. Instead of understanding her (it)better, the writers took the opposite approach that they did with the other character reveals and she actually becomes MORE of a mystery, especially in the season finale. It was sad to see a couple of supporting characters die in the latter episodes, but their storylines had pretty much hit an obvious plot wall. I just wished that one of the character's demise had been more sacrificial or at least a little more heroic. But, its the Terminator and somebody ALWAYS dies...
Shirley Manson's character (Catherine Weaver) plays a major role in the second season. As Season 2 progresses, you realize that there is something completely different about her behavior than the rest of the Terminators. Even though its obvious that she is a T-1000 (liquid metal Teminator from T2) she seems to have another another agenda than just eliminating Skynets potential enemies (if she even IS working for Skynet ;-) ). Its interesting to see her interact with Savannah (her human daughter) and how she realizes that Mommy doesn't behave like she should or like she remembers. And the plot twist in the season finale is jaw-dropping and Awesome. At the same time it creates more questions than it answers. I'm really looking forward to Season 3 (FOX willing) and seeing plot questions answered and the pieces come together for John's maturity into the John Connor we know will lead the resistance and help save human beings from extinction.
With the upcoming movie series ""Terminator Salvation"" I think there will be enough positive buzz to entice Fox to venture forward with at least 1 more season of this very popular series that has a definite cult like following...

The pacing of the different episodes allows the audience to not only enjoy the typical action/chase dynamic of the Terminator franchise, but also gives them insight to the development of the different characters.  I truly enjoy the series more than the films, as it touches on deeper multiple concepts i.e. the human/robot relationship and the bond between mother and son.  So if you're looking for a sophisticated science fiction thriller that contains elements of dark humor, romance, and action, you've come to the right place.

3459846,5,B001AQR3J4,"Warning!  Multiple spoilers!

As I write this review, just after the end of TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES, the future of the show is very uncertain.  The ratings after the show's move to Friday night in February 2009 were never strong, although it persistently ranked #1 among shows having the largest percentage of their viewers watching via DVR.  The brute fact is that TSCC did not lack for viewers; it lacked for live viewers during broadcast.

I hope very much for a Season Three of TSCC.  This was easily one of my favorite shows for the 2008-2009 season.  When it was on Monday nights, I watched it live rather than either CHUCK or GOSSIP GIRL, two shows that I enjoy.  When it moved to Fridays I intentionally stayed home to watch it (and then for six glorious weeks DOLLHOUSE and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, for what was perhaps the finest nights of TV I've ever experienced).  Although the show lagged a bit just after its midway point (unfortunately right when it moved to Fridays), it remained persistently fascinating for the entire year.  If I had access to a button that would allow me to choose between either having the upcoming film TERMINATOR SALVATION or TSCC vanishing, then we would never have the movie but would get a Season Three of the TV series.  My preference is based on a love of character development and a richly articulated story, neither of which is possible in a 120-minute movie.  Besides, most movies quickly degenerate into a special effects extravaganza, and the previews of TERMINATOR SALVATION definitely leads one to fear that that is precisely what we will get this summer.

I do have a couple of complaints with the TV series.  I think that the writers sometimes allowed it to drag a bit in Season Two.  And while I'll grant that ""Sarah Connor"" was in the title and that John Connor is ultimately the crucial character in the Terminator saga, far and away the most interesting character on TSCC was Cameron.  Most of the weaker episodes were notable for having little or no Cameron.  Most of the truly great moments on the show had Cameron front and center.

Let me interrupt myself to insist that if you DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED, to not read any futher!

Season One focused primarily on tracking down the possessors of a computer with an advanced AI named ""The Turk"" (the name alluding to a famous 18th century chess playing machine in the shape of a Turkish male that vanquished many opponents before it was revealed that it was a hoax, a chess master actually hiding inside the machine).  That apparently accomplished, Sarah, John, and Cameron embarked on a series of clues that led them to the ZeiraCorp, headed by a shape shifting terminator played by Garbage lead singer turned actress Shirley Manson.  One of my favorite things about Season Two is that for nearly the whole season we are led to believe that Catherine Weaver (Manson) is an evil Cyborg.  After all, she kills numerous individuals and resurrects deceased evil Cyborg Cromartie to serve as the body for John Henry, the super computer that her company is building.  But in the season (series?) finale she is revealed to be on the side of the angels.  Or is she?  Given an easy opportunity to kill John and Sarah, she not only does not do so, but saves their lives.  And both John and Sarah seem to take her at her word.  All season long viewers had been looking forward to a Weaver/Cameron encounter, but instead we see Weaver insisting that she is fighting SkyNet, just as they are.  The whole plot is further complicated by Cameron apparently refusing Weaver's offer to join her cause.  The fact is that at the end of the season Cameron and her agenda remains a total mystery.

For the past year I've been engaged in a detailed study of robots in the history of myth, literature, film and television.  TV robots and Cyborgs have been widely prevalent but also not terribly complex.  I deeply love a character like Sharon Agathon on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, but Sharon is so clearly human - even if a Cyborg - that she doesn't really challenge our understanding of human/robotic relationships.

Even odder is that the sudden ending of their relationship seems to have no impact on her.  There is absolutely no question that within the next half-century robots will begin to play an increasingly important social role in human life.  In Japan especially scientists are working hard on companion robots for children and for the elderly.

If TSCC is not renewed for a third season, ending Cameron's story will be one of the great losses on the show.  At the end of Season Two she remains a complete mystery.  I personally want that mystery resolved.

Though we didn't need additional proof of it, TSCC is yet another example of the fact that there is absolutely no connection between quality, viewership, and renewal in American television.  It is further proof of just how broken commercial TV is.  The brute fact is that TV series are, from the corporate point of view, vehicles for commercials.  If they provide a platform for a large number of people to see the commercials that are the economic heart of the shows, they are in the eyes of the networks great shows.  Absolutely dreadful shows like TWO AND A HALF MEN or the endless police procedurals on CBS illustrate this.  I've never seen a respected TV critic with a kind word for TWO AND A HALF MEN, yet it remains the most watched half hour comedy on television.  Thus, it is the best platform for advertising.  PUSHING DAISIES was cancelled at midseason despite more critical acclaim than any other series on the four major networks.  Perhaps for fans of television the major networks have outlived their usefulness.  If they can't find a place for a show as fine as TSCC on their schedules, it is proof that TV is broken.  FOX eats up huge gobs of its schedule with the unceasingly awful AMERICAN IDLE while NBC has eliminated five hours of scripted TV in the 2009-2010 schedule so that they can hand it over to the untalented and uninteresting Jay Leno.

Or if you must watch these horrible shows, at least DVR them.  As long as they are the best vehicles for commercials, we are going to continue to lament the cancellation of the better shows and the unceasingly continuation of critically unacclaimed and artistically empty series.

The one reason for hope for TSCC is the film TERMINATOR SALVATION, which is likely to be the biggest box office hit this summer.

As I write this review, just after the end of TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES, the future of the show is very uncertain.  The ratings after the show's move to Friday night in February 2009 were never strong, although it persistently ranked #1 among shows having the largest percentage of their viewers watching via DVR.  The brute fact is that TSCC did not lack for viewers; it lacked for live viewers during broadcast.

I hope very much for a Season Three of TSCC.  This was easily one of my favorite shows for the 2008-2009 season.  When it was on Monday nights, I watched it live rather than either CHUCK or GOSSIP GIRL, two shows that I enjoy.  When it moved to Fridays I intentionally stayed home to watch it (and then for six glorious weeks DOLLHOUSE and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, for what was perhaps the finest nights of TV I've ever experienced).  Although the show lagged a bit just after its midway point (unfortunately right when it moved to Fridays), it remained persistently fascinating for the entire year.  If I had access to a button that would allow me to choose between either having the upcoming film TERMINATOR SALVATION or TSCC vanishing, then we would never have the movie but would get a Season Three of the TV series.  My preference is based on a love of character development and a richly articulated story, neither of which is possible in a 120-minute movie.  Besides, most movies quickly degenerate into a special effects extravaganza, and the previews of TERMINATOR SALVATION definitely leads one to fear that that is precisely what we will get this summer.

I do have a couple of complaints with the TV series.  I think that the writers sometimes allowed it to drag a bit in Season Two.  And while I'll grant that ""Sarah Connor"" was in the title and that John Connor is ultimately the crucial character in the Terminator saga, far and away the most interesting character on TSCC was Cameron.  Most of the weaker episodes were notable for having little or no Cameron.  Most of the truly great moments on the show had Cameron front and center.

Let me interrupt myself to insist that if you DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED, to not read any futher!

Season One focused primarily on tracking down the possessors of a computer with an advanced AI named ""The Turk"" (the name alluding to a famous 18th century chess playing machine in the shape of a Turkish male that vanquished many opponents before it was revealed that it was a hoax, a chess master actually hiding inside the machine).  That apparently accomplished, Sarah, John, and Cameron embarked on a series of clues that led them to the ZeiraCorp, headed by a shape shifting terminator played by Garbage lead singer turned actress Shirley Manson.  One of my favorite things about Season Two is that for nearly the whole season we are led to believe that Catherine Weaver (Manson) is an evil Cyborg.  After all, she kills numerous individuals and resurrects deceased evil Cyborg Cromartie to serve as the body for John Henry, the super computer that her company is building.  But in the season (series?) finale she is revealed to be on the side of the angels.  Or is she?  Given an easy opportunity to kill John and Sarah, she not only does not do so, but saves their lives.  And both John and Sarah seem to take her at her word.  All season long viewers had been looking forward to a Weaver/Cameron encounter, but instead we see Weaver insisting that she is fighting SkyNet, just as they are.  The whole plot is further complicated by Cameron apparently refusing Weaver's offer to join her cause.  The fact is that at the end of the season Cameron and her agenda remains a total mystery.

For the past year I've been engaged in a detailed study of robots in the history of myth, literature, film and television.  TV robots and Cyborgs have been widely prevalent but also not terribly complex.  I deeply love a character like Sharon Agathon on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, but Sharon is so clearly human - even if a Cyborg - that she doesn't really challenge our understanding of human/robotic relationships.  She looks like us, acts like us, and feels like us.  It is difficult to say in what significant sense that she isn't as much as a person as any human.  Cameron is perhaps the most complex, challenging robot/Cyborg we've ever seen on TV.  Summer Glau brilliantly portrays her as something both more than and less than human, something undeniably strange and ""other.""  She apparently lacks feelings, yet definitely has her own motivations.  She is a machine, yet at times seems eerily human, such as taking pains over her toe nail polish or practicing ballet.

I hope the show will last a long time but I hope, while they still have the actors together, whenever it leaves TV they will make a two-hour wrap-up for big-screen movie release and not leave us hanging as some good shows have done.

I've bought the DVDs of the first season and will buy any future DVDs as quickly as they are available. We didn't miss an episode because of the wonder of recording but I want them for the future. What great TV and what great drama.

3459887,5,B001AQR3J4,"I wrote an awfully scathing review of the first season after seeing only a few episodes of it when it originally aired.  I can't say for sure I was totally wrong, as the first season may have been as inferior as it seemed.  However, the second season has done it for me.  This is the first new sci-fi series in some time I can say has grabbed me.  In fact, possibly exceeding the quality of the spy/cop drama 24, which just had its two highest-quality seasons after several years of losing me during their last thirds every time.

True, season 2 of Terminator is not yet over, but I need to post this.  The music is phenomenal.  I don't know what the composer did before this, but he's got a very special ear and taste.  The photography and use of lighting has impressed me.  They cut John Connor's hair and got rid of that idiotic Ken-doll runway-model look.  The whole series, in fact, seems to have gotten shaved, mussed up, dirtied, and taken a shot of increased realism in its collective arse.  At the same time, they've focused in on smaller sub-stories and dramatic elements, even going so far as taking side episodes to explore this or that aspect of a particular character's life.  It's having the effect of fleshing out their development in a way I haven't seen since, well, Star Trek: TNG.

Is the cast at that caliber?  Is the writing?  No and no.  But it's really getting there, and to be fair, Next Generation was a huge budget, cast hand-picked by Rodenberry, and every stage actor & TV movie writer who'd grown up on the original series interested in being involved.  The X-Files is just an enigma of high-quality television, so it's terribly unfair to compare anything else to it.  Duchovny had the range to play a cross-dresser in Twin Peaks, for god sakes, another in this trinity of perhaps the greatest series in TV history.  The Terminator spin off had a lot working against it considering how myself and everyone I know wrote it off even before the pilot, and while at first blush it seemed to be a clichd, dramatically rough, overly ""pretty"" & youthful start, I think they may have found their footing...possibly in spite of the latter.

Interested in what I missed the first season and curious to see if my first impressions of last year's episodes were correct or not, I will shortly buy the complete first season and watch it strait through before making any further comments on it.  That original review is deleted, or should I say...no, no I don't think I'll go there.

In Season 1 the entire cast of The Sarah Connor Chronicles took their roles seriously, and they preserved the integrity and the awesomeness of the movies that spawned the TV series. I'm not seeing that in Season 2. I'm seeing continuity issues within the series itself and now big time with the films. Sure, the producers of the TV show need to take some liberties with the T 1 - 3 storyline that fans of the movies are so familiar with, but they are either running out of good ideas that can sustain the integrity of the relationship to the movies or they just don't really care about that relationship anymore. In Season 2 you really have to try not to think about why there's never any reference to all this TV show stuff in T3.

I'd recommend seeing Season 1 before venturing into Season 2, but then you'll be hooked into going for a disappointing Season 2. So if you really need a John Connor fix, you might best serve yourself by waiting for 2009's theatrical release of Terminator Salvation.",1229385600,2,2674,5.973890339425587
3459914,5,B001AQR3J4,"Warning!  Contains numerous major and high octane SPOILERS!  Don't read if you want to be spoiler free!

I thoroughly enjoyed TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES in Season One, but so far in Season Two it has shown vast improvement in very nearly every way.  I strongly encourage anyone interested in trying this show out to first watch Season One just for background, but with the knowledge that Season Two things get much, much better.  The two previous shows that I thought showed this much improvement from Season One to Two were BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and THE SOPRANOS.  TSCC is not as good as either of those, but it nonetheless is a far stronger show than its debut season.

I still don't think it is a perfect show.  I think the central narrative is still a tad fuzzy and I think there is too much of a tendency for the main characters to repeat themselves.  John started off the series disgruntled and he remains disgruntled still.  It is slightly easier now than at the beginning of the series to imagine him the future leader of humankind in its struggle against the machines, but not by much.  Mainly he seems a petulant teen.  It is difficult to envision anyone following him into battle, let alone being inspired by him.  This is something that the writers need to address soon.  Like sharks, shows need to keep moving or they die (actually, marine researchers have learned that sharks actually do stop and even sleep, but for the sake of metaphor let's overlook that).  John needs to evolve and mature.  And soon.

I love Lena Headley in the title role.  She seems utterly believable as a grimly determined mother.  I would like to see them work on developing her an emotional life in the midst of her armed struggle.  She is so focused on her son and on fighting the machines that we don't get a sense of her having any concern whatsoever for her own needs.

For me the best thing in the show, by far, is Summer Glau as Cameron.  In the history of TV, there have been scores and scores of mechanized humans, from Hymie on GET SMART! to Data on ST:TNG to Sharon and Six on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, to genetically altered humans like Max Guevara on DARK ANGEL.  But virtually all of these mechanized humans are pretty much that:  humans.  Sharon Agathon on BSG is so obviously a person that it isn't that interesting of a question debating whether she is or not.  Data was clearly a person despite lacking an emotional life.  Still, his actions were driven by something like compassion and a concern for others.  Cameron is different.  She is the first artificial human on TV who is at best only marginally a person.  Let me put this another way.

John Turing famously in an article for the British journal MIND devised a test for determining whether a machine can or cannot be considered a person.  He imagined a questioner separated from a test subject by a barrier.  He envisioned asking the subject a series of questions.  If in asking the questions you couldn't tell the difference between a machine's answer to the questions and those of a human, then, Turing argued, that machine could be considered a person.  Despite his lack of emotions, I think Data, the least humanlike of all TV's artificial people after Cameron, would past the Turing Test.  But would Cameron?  It is really hard to say.  Even a therapist on the show who has talked to her wonders if she suffers from Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism that manifests as a lack of empathy and human feeling.  Sharon Agathon on BSG is clearly deeply empathetic and manifests love and affection and loyalty and the full range of human emotions.  But Cameron has all kinds of inappropriate reactions and being human is far more of a mystery to her than it is to Data.  An example:  Sarah and Cameron rescue a boy from a terminator and hold him against his will to save both him and his parents.  He attempts to call home, but Cameron grabs him and holds him up in the air, telling him bluntly that if he makes the call it will result in the death of his parents.  Sarah intervenes and tells her to lighten up and she does, and while still holding the boy up in the air with one hand she completely shifts gears and asks, ""Would you like a bedtime story?""  Another example is a midseason episode in which she tries to make ""a friend.""  She means well, but her ineptness is striking.  She simply lacks the ability to ""make a friend.""

The mark of a good show is that it leaves you wanting to know what happens next.  And most of what I want to know revolves around Cameron.  For instance, in the very first episode we learn that as terminators go, Cameron is ""different.""  We still don't quite know what that means, but we know that she has a complex relationship with the future John Connor.  They seem to have been quite intimate (I don't mean sexually, though that also doesn't seem excluded).  She hints at a degree of familiarity that she does not possess with the younger John.  And in the season premiere, we see Cameron reverted to her original programming, to kill John Connor, only to be able to override it.  Was the override her own volition?  Or was it additional programming?  And earlier in the episode, thinking that she was about to be destroyed by John and Sarah, she hysterically -- with emotions that seem genuine rather than feigned -- tells John not to, that they love each other, that they are in love.  ??????  It is to date the strangest moment in the entire run of the show.  Clearly, there is a great deal to Cameron that she has not yet chosen to share.  Not least is why the John of the future sent back to his younger self this very unusual robot.  If, in fact, he sent her back.

All in all, this has developed into one of the most entertaining series on TV.  I strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys great SF or adventure.",1228867200,2,5839,4.5167144221585485
3459915,5,B001AQR3J4,"As a fan of the impressive first season, I give the follow-up season top review for one of the best series on television -- period. This show has establised itself as having one of the best cast, scripted, and, considering the large-scale Hollywood blockbusters it is living up to, budgeted shows on any other broadcasting station. Every episode of this season is tense, revealing, and ever-advancing the overall story -- which is quite difficult in a saga which everyone already knows how it began, where it's been at some point in between, and where/how it ultimately ends. Still, this incredible show maintains its own standing with increasing insight into the warzone-future eagerly anticipated in summer-2009's 'Terminator: Salvation', as well as keeping relavent to the many missing years bridging 'T2: Judgement Day' and 'T3: Rise Of The Machines' by use of gripping character interactions from very capable talent and 'Lost'-esque story-interweaving. ""There is no fate but what you make""; so make this a mission priority for your collection, to be seen in all its hi-def glory of Blu-ray(tm), the best in hi-tech visual!",1228780800,29,1128,5.2032967032967035
3459916,5,B001AQR3J4,"If you've missed the story arc for this season, this might be a good episode to jump in with. It is sort of like a stand-alone issue of a good graphic novel, which adds subtly to the overall arc but begins and ends within the hour of the show. I think it makes impressive use of the Cameron character, and Summer Glau really shines.",1228262400,,332,4.203125
3459917,5,B001AQR3J4,"It's a great show, and i'm glad Fox finally realized that and decided to give it 22 episodes rather than 13 for the second season. My only guess as to the other review is that it was either the tv, sound system, or a bad dvd. Great acting and good special effects, but then again Zoic always does great work.",1227052800,19,308,4.15

8278648,2,B001AQR3J4,"The discs come in plastic snap cases. The plastic swivel thingee that holds the season one discs has already broke. The plastic swivel thingee for the season two discs is okay so far. I've only watched this series once and I take care of my stuff so there's no reason why the swivel thingee for season one should have broken.

The series is overloaded with advertising. Every disc has ads for the terminator movies.

The first season of Terminator is short and good. The second season is a confusing mess, especially towards the end. Here's a laundry list of problems I had with season two: The season starts crazy with a big car bomb explosion, but no police show up in the neighborhood. Where they on strike or vacation? There's a big shootout at an apartment, but none of the other tenants notice. That's just the beginning of the stupidity. The female liquid terminator was too unrealistic for me. Pure fantasy. I didn't like it when Connor Trinnear from Star Trek Enterprise got shot. And the Riley character sucks.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002), and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969), Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001), and The Tudors (2007-2010). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1521158400,,2475,5.368556701030927
