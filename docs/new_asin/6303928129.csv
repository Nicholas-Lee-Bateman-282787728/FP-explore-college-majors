7855252,4,6303928129,"this is a richly photographed movie, but as a sword and sandal flick of Ulysses it needs Kirk Douglas. i can't remember any one point in the story that would carry the film, like the story in Douglas's movie you could follow that story. what i do think was great was the photography of the greek men in all there glory showing. it was a pretty movie, not well acted as all sword & sandal movies. i don't remember any sex scenes that would be considered explicit, but gentle nudity of men, all acting and looking like ancient greek gods and heroes and soldiers.",1357603200,,560,4.394230769230769
