8179506,3,B000NO1XI6,"Completely average vigilante flick, following loosely in the footsteps of Death Wish (1974).  The only negligible action takes place near the end, by that time, we don't care.

Has reliable actors in it such as Robert Culp (The Outer Limits (19631965), the classic ""Demon with a Glass Hand"", The Greatest American Hero) as Frank Sirrianni, John Colicos (he played the Klingon Commander Kor in Star Trek episode ""Errand of Mercy"" (1967), Battlestar Galactica) as Vincent Karbone, Belinda J. Montgomery (Doogie Howser, M.D.) and Bo Svenson (Walking Tall, Part 2, The Inglorious Bastards).

8179507,5,B000NO1XI6,This is a very hard movie to find and I'm lucky that I was able to get it on Amazon. I saw this one at the theater in 1976 and I enjoyed it. Its definitely a B movie but not every B movie is a dud. I'm glad that this one is finally part of my library.,1430352000,2,251,3.4210526315789473
8179508,5,B000NO1XI6,"I can appreciate any good mobster movie where the good guy carries a 6-inch Colt Python .357 Magnum.  If you like 70's action movies where the good guy exacts an appropriate level of damage on the bad guys, get this film.  It's hard to find and you're lucky to find it here on Amazon.com.",1358899200,3,288,4.314814814814815
8179509,4,B000NO1XI6,"Bo Svenson rises above the walking tall films with this revenge/thriller. Michael Mcbain (Svenson) witnesses a man beat to death by mafia hoods and intervenes. Before Mcbain can identify them in court, he, his family and acquaintances are stalked relentlessly and nothing and no one seems to help until the victim goes outside the law to fight back. Because of the presence of Bo Svenson, the entertainment value of the film goes up a few notches. With his believable performance, Bo practically carries this film himself. Although there is some well handled action scenes in this, it is the drama that makes it interesting and very different from other films. Robert Culp is good as the cop who tries but fails to give good advice to Svenson and keep his family out of the mafia's reach. The main mafia henchman has some great scenes and causes a lot of mayhem. Svenson's anger at Culp's never ending failures to protect his family, and the mafia henchman's dirty mouth make for some tense, but also funny moments. Svenson hulks his way out of the witness protection program and nearly tears a guy's head off! This is the most different revenge movie I've ever seen. 16x9 dvd picture is great, audio is too.",1227830400,3,1208,4.757142857142857
