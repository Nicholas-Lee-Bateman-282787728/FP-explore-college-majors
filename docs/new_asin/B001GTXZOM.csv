3620006,5,B001GTXZOM,"This is, undoubtedly, one of the best acted, well written television programs ever produced (and I say that with no pretension knowing what has come before).  My wife and I decided to forgo blue-ray to buy an allregion DVD and have bought all 6 seasons released thus far on Region 2 UK DVD since it's taken 3 years to get season 3 released. If you have yet to discover this program and enjoy intelligent, gripping, well thought out and presented mysteries...this is your show.",1232755200,7,476,4.666666666666667
3620007,5,B001GTXZOM,"Just so you will know. This series is still being produced on the BBC. the Seventh series just aired starting April 2008. At this time, BBCAmerica has no plans to air the seasons 5-7. They will be bringing the next series in Wired in the Blood in 2009.
So--Go yell at the BBC to air Waking the Dead--you will really want them to do so--(spoiler alert)due to the fact that there is resolution to Boyd's missing son.",1228262400,12,414,4.3896103896103895

3620021,2,B001GTXZOM,"I thought Seasons 1 and 2 of this show were a good honest police detective drama, well written and acted, and the only drawback was that the episodes had fairly predictable ending.
But perhaps some critic alerted the writers to this problem, because starting season 3, nothing made much sense any more and the plots were hard to follow and understand. I gave up on the show half way thru season 3.",1377993600,3,397,4.527777777777778
3620022,5,B001GTXZOM,"In this third season the actors seem really settled into their roles.  The plots are complex and outstanding.  Boyd has interesting facial expressions which flicker across his face.  The team works well together.  The writing is crisp and occasionally even humorous.  The quality doesn't abate, it continues.  This is a fabulous series.  I love to watch it while on the treadmill.  Love the setting backdrop of scenes in England.",1365379200,,429,5.115942028985507

3620024,5,B001GTXZOM,"Although I have watched this series out of order, the impact was not lessened in any way.  The stories and the way they bring it all together, forensics, reviewing prior investigation files, interviewing witnesses, it all fits together.  The main focus is solving the crime but you get to see the who, the what, the why, the way. I have now purchased up to Season Seven.
It's British TV and one of their best.",1361404800,,409,4.513513513513513
3620025,5,B001GTXZOM,"""Waking the Dead Season 3""is an entry in the acclaimed British mystery television series that ran from 2000-2007, when it was axed by the British Broadcasting Corporation  in favor of `newer, more innovative crime dramas.'  It played for some time on BBCAmerica on my side of the pond. It is a strongly -cast and -written ---by Barbara Machin, a woman, yay! -- police procedural/crime drama that follows Detective Superintendent Peter Boyd and his multi-discipline cold-case unit consisting of scientists and a psychologist as well as detectives  at the Metropolitan Police. The squad utilizes the latest advances in forensic science, psychological profiling of the unknown criminal perpetrators and other modern investigative techniques to crack unsolved murders.

Upon even initial viewing, its differences from similar-sounding American TV series are great.  The cop shop is anything but new and shiny, and poorly lit compared to American series that all seem to have been filmed on a sunny Southern California set.  The actors aren't shiny and new, either.  Trevor Eve, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heat-of-the-Sun-Boxed-Set-Private-Lives-Hide-in-Plain-Sight-The-Sport-of-Kings/dp/B0001WTUK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heat of the Sun Boxed Set (Private Lives / Hide in Plain Sight / The Sport of Kings)</a>) who plays Boyd, began his career as beefcake, but he's older now, showing how thoughtfully he's aged, but still very watchable.  He's backed, in the cop shop, by Sue Johnston as Dr. Grace Foley;, Wil Johnson, as DI Spencer Jordan; Holly Aird as Dr. Frankie Wharton; Claire Goose, as DS Amelia (Mel) Silver, and Tara Fitgerald (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tenant-of-Wildfell-Hall/dp/B00005JOA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hear-My-Song-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-2-Import-United-Kingdom/dp/B003H8CJLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hear My Song [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - United Kingdom </a>] ) as Dr. Eve Lockhart. All of them are very good actors, and not one of them is a beautiful young blond.  The series also used a number of excellent older British actors such as Shirley Anne Field (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saturday-Night-and-Sunday-Morning/dp/B00005S8KV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</a>, HEAR MY SONG); Tom Bell(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-L-Shaped-Room-Region-2/dp/B00009B0SC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The L-Shaped Room [Region 2</a>]), and the late director of offbeat films, Ken Russell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lair-of-the-White-Worm/dp/B00009YXHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lair of the White Worm</a>). The show is violent, intense and suspenseful; plots are intricate and complex: there's always something going on.  The episodes are:

Disc 1.  ""Multistorey, Parts 1 and 2.  Did the nerdy Carl McKenzie, who was arrested red-handed in the car park, really
kill 14 people on the White Water High Street?  Including one, Nick Patterson, a cop friend of Boyd's, and that with his own gun?
""Walking on Water, Parts 1 and 2."" A young man, a cross-dresser, is released from prison after serving time for killing his adoptive father.  But did he really?  And how does it happen that three women are still missing from this fishing-oriented family since that murder?  I found this a particularly strong episode years ago, still remembered some of it; set in the heavily tidal Thames estuary.
Disc 2.  ""Breaking Glass, Parts 1 and 2."" A particularly complex plot that gives Boyd a social worker, Miss Poole. To bounce off.  Unravels the history of a juvenile institution that has been closed.
""Final Cut, Parts 1 and 2.""  Long-hidden, mummified bodies come to light.  Very complex, and particularly involving, I thought, as it explores London's Jamaican community, and the important father/son relationship of DI Spencer Jordan.  Another one I've remembered for a long time.

Solid and workmanlike this series surely is, but it's much more than that; it makes for riveting viewing.  Too bad about the BBC's cancellation.",1340755200,,4309,6.453913043478261
3620026,5,B001GTXZOM,we here in the uk adore this program. the last series which aired here in 2009 (series 8 ) was so good i cant wait for the next one. to all you US fans we have a long wait between series even here! . alas the new series 9 which  is about to start will be the last one. sob! but  please take note that waking the dead  is without a doubt  one of the best shows the uk has and will ever produce!,1299888000,2,393,3.642857142857143

I saw Season One and Two. Am in the process of viewing Season Three. It's a series, which is getting better and better. This is not an easy accomplishment. Especially when the stories are so well developed and the acting superb throughout. A CSI British style or should I say BBC's view of that corner of criminology. It isn't CSI Las Vegas or Miami, but far superior. I already have purchased Series Four and plan to get Series Five, as soon as it arrives on the U.S. market in January. In short order, I have become addicted to Waking the Dead and look forward to the stories to crackle and pop during the long winter evenings. It's an expectation thoroughly pleasant to look forward to!

3620029,5,B001GTXZOM,"Season three (3) of ""Waking the Dead"" certainly kept me on ""the edge of my seat"" trying to anticipate the outcomes and the guilty parties of each of the four (4) episodes on two (2) discs with each episode being in two (2) parts with each part running over an hour.  Season three (3) is really a very good British ""Cold Case"" detective/mystery program. While viewing Season three (3), I found it to be very difficult (if not impossible) for me to pre-determine the outcomes of each episode until ""all was revealed"" at the end of each show.  There are no ""easy"" obvious cases this season.  No ""spoon feeding"" of clues to the viewing audience with no obvious outcomes.  All of the elements of this series seem to really have ""come together"" in a very marvelous way in this season.  Those elements being the acting, the direction and, most of all, the writing are simply fantastic!

The ""Cold Case"" unit of this series is comprised of a Psychological Profiler (played greatly by Sue Johnston), three detectives and a pathologist with one of the detectives (played wonderfully by Trevor Eve) being the Unit's leader.  ALL of the actors are superb.  As I have said in my review of Season two(2) of this series, what I really adore about this series is that all of the members of the  Unit are ""experts"" in their profession and are not afraid to disagree with the Unit's leader (played by Eve); therefore, there can be major disagreements and ""battles"".  This season the actors certainly seem to be really ""into"" each of their role without one ""weak link"".  My god, they all are very good.  Of course, all of this greatness in this show, to me, has to be attributable to the fabulous scripts.

The stories of each episode in Season three (3) are simply fantastic.  They all are so well written.  I too particularly loved the episode entitled ""Walk on Water"". That episode had me biting my nails.  In fact, I could not stop watching this season until I had viewed all of the episodes.  This season is so great; I loved it.

By the way, I must add that I really feel that this series is for adults with mature minds.  I used the subtitles not because of hearing problems but to catch the superb well written mature dialog.",1288569600,5,2214,4.559493670886076

3620032,5,B001GTXZOM,This is a must see series.  It has amazing writers and an amazing cast.  An A++ all of the way.  Why is it taking them so long to release the rest to the Region One market?,1252713600,,172,3.7222222222222223

3620034,3,B001GTXZOM,"Although the plots are interesting and well acted, the main character, Boyd, comes across as an arrogant, loud-mouthed bully.  I had hoped his character would grow throughout the series, but this doesn't seem to be the case.  This will be the last season I purchase.",1238371200,3,266,4.888888888888889
3620035,5,B001GTXZOM,"This is a wonderful series.  I love the fact that two of the main protagonists are over thirty and not six feet blonds with more beauty than brains.  The character interaction is deep without being over-powering.  Even the guest performances are big-screen worthy.  Better than CSI, although each version of those series have their place too.  The only t.v. I've seen better than this is Foyle's War {a different type of show entirely, but flawlessly written and acted}.  I enjoy this series and look forward to the next installment.",1235088000,4,533,4.932584269662922
3620036,5,B001GTXZOM,"Despite my obsessive dvr-ing of Waking the Dead on BBCAmerica, I somehow missed season three. All I have to say is ""Wow!"" This is such a fantastic season of this series. There isn't an ""off"" episode in season three. I will agree with a previous reviewer that the two-part episode ""Walking on Water"" is just outstanding; probably my favorite so far, maybe ever. I really recommend Season Three if you haven't seen it. This show is just fantastic.

As a (hopefully) helpful aside for fans of this series: Further seasons of this great series aren't currently available from the US Amazon, but you can get Seasons Four, Five, and Six from Amazon.co.uk. The prices on entire seasons are currently 11 ($16)-12 ($17) each, which is pretty fantastic. Shipping wasn't too bad either. With the pound being weaker against the dollar, now might be the time to order. If you haven't ever ordered from Amazon.co.uk, your same log-in and password will work. You will need a multi-region player as these are Region 2 and will not play on standard American players. Amazon carries some Phillips brand multiregion players for anywhere from $50-$75, right now. I hope this information is helpful to other fans of this fantastic show!",1234483200,30,1215,4.898058252427185
3620037,5,B001GTXZOM,"Well here in the US we who love this show are finally up to series 3.  This season really found it's stride especially after the four incredible episodes from series 2. What I really like about these DVDs is that you can view the parts that the BBC America network decided to foolishly cut for commercial time.  My favorite from this series is ""Walking on Water"". I won't give away any spoilers but the performance from Craig Kelly was simply amazing.  I really recommend this series to lovers of crime drama.",1233014400,8,509,4.571428571428571

8307121,5,B001GTXZOM,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this series minus the yelling screaming, demanding, pompous, tantrum throwing Boyd. Currently watching S5 and I am still hoping they get rid of him.
Other characters seem to work very well together with the writing in place, hoping it continues to be done as well as past epi's, and can continue to function very believably without the arrogant and self righteous goings on of ""Boyd"".
