Heero takes the Epyon out for a spin, he notices that Epyon has a striking similarity in that of the Wing Zero. You'll see Heero go completely mad as he terrorizes mobile suit pilots, mauling through every mech suit in his path with Epyon. Great fight scenes, tons of action, a must have for all Gundam fans!",989193600,,434,4.304878048780488

7935877,4,B00005AVRV,"Relena and Heero have come aboard the Libra to convince Zechs to stop his insanity, but he's not hearing it. Treize and his army have come asking for a one on one duel, but Zechs declines. The Libra and Peacemillion are about to collide, and the collision will destroy Earth. The Gundam pilots have to stop the catastrophe.

Many of the Gunadam series have a very similar plot. What distinguishes them from each other is the character development. Gundam Wing has a lot of potential, but falls short of greatness. There are some awesome battles and plot twists, but the characters are very boring and one dimensional. The voice acting is bad too, which doesn't help. This is a really good anime despite these things. I like the plot and the action can get pretty intense. If you like Gundam, then you will probably enjoy this, even though it's one of the weakest Gundam's ever made.",1355356800,,882,4.653846153846154
7935878,5,B00005AVRV,"Gundam Wing, like the other Gundam series, is an intricately plotted tale about the effects of war on people of varying temperaments. That sentence in no way does the show justice. There's action, intrigue, space battles and philosophical discussions between the characters about the nature of war. There's also a whiff of romance, though that thread of the plot is more subtly played. It's a great show to check out if you're interested in science fiction anime and meditations on war.

If you Netflix this show, you'll notice that Operations 6 and 7 are missing from the lineup. Operation 6, as many have noted, is mostly clip shows, though it's not a bad starting point if you haven't watched the series in a while and want a refresher on who is who and what they're up to. Operation 7 is well worth having, as the action kicks back into high gear after the lull. All of the pilots are well-represented in these episodes, even Zechs, and they all have exciting things to do. Since you can get this disc used for the approximate cost of a Blockbuster rental, why not have it to own? This is a particularly good one to keep - that is, if you're not interested in buying the whole set to watch anytime you want! I got mine through goHastings, and they were shipped much faster than I expected and arrived in the advertised condition. I am a very pleased customer.",1279411200,,1363,4.563265306122449
7935879,5,B00005AVRV,There aren't enough good things I can say about this series. If you like this genre then this is definitely for you. The storyline is complex but not so much so that you can't follow it. The battles are well thought out and not over done to where it looks stupid and the series isn't so drawn out that you forget what happened in the beginning. This is a great series from start to finish and I'd recommend it to anyone.,1229731200,,420,4.197530864197531
7935880,5,B00005AVRV,this is the start of the second season in the show and it great i love the gundam wing shows get this dvd it really is good,1037750400,,123,3.5925925925925926
7935881,5,B00005AVRV,"We finally get to see where Trowa went to.  Trowa had been missing ever since Heero fought Quatre in Wing Zero. Trowa is at the same circus he was during the first part of the series, but he forgets who he is and thinks he is Catherine's brother.
  WuFei makes his return as well in his new gundam.
  Duo gets to be in the Wing Zero for a brief time and almosted destoryed the colony Hilde is on. Duo attacks Wing Zero but doesn't destory it.
  Heero and Quarte are at the sanc kingdom.  Heero goes to fight for the Trize Fraction and meets Treize.  Treize gives Heero a new mobile suit called Epyon. Epyon is much like Wing Zero.  Heero destorys everybody in the battlefield, including the Trize Fraction.
  This DVD features a new menu compared to the other menus of the older DVDs.",1027468800,,784,4.3310344827586205
7935882,5,B00005AVRV,"In these five episodes, the Gundam pilots make their return after the Lunar Base incident. In episode 35, Heero and Quatre become students at the Sanc Kingdom. It is there that Heero reaquires his Gundam 01 and meets the war crazed Dorthy Catalonia. Soon, the remaining members of the Treize faction are taken in by the Sanc Kingdom as refugees, but Romefeller refuses this. While trying to destroy the Treize faction, Noin mobilizes the secret white Torus units to assist. In episode 36, Duo is hiding out in a colony with Hilde only to be welcomed by Trent with the Wing Zero. Duo is forced to pilot the Wing Zero and is overcommed by the Zero system. When Romefeller comes to stop this test, Trent throws Duo out and destroys the attacking mobile dolls. Duo heads back to kill Trent with 02 and ens up sending Trent drifting in space. In episode 37, Zechs attacks the mobile dolls headed for Luxemburg while Heero heads off there as well. In episode 38, while the Trieze faction fights off Romefeller, Trieze gives Heero the speical Gundam, Epyon. The Epyon has been equiped with a speical Zero system on it. Meanwhile, Trieze abandons the Talgese in the middle of a battle and switches over to the Wing Zero. In episode 39, Trowa is found by Katherine and Wu Fei is now infuriated with rage after seeing his colony destroyed. Zechs trys to ally himself with Wu Fei, but to no prevail. The disc menu is setup like the Wing Zero system. The only extra is the Epyon gallery and bio along with trailers. There is a nice trailer for Gundam 0079 I should add. The Japanese language is somewhat better than the English version which sounds ok, but gets a little boring. One thing I hate is that I'll have to wait for Operation 8 in order to see the second opening. Even though the main menu features it. Overall, a very entertaining disc that makes me want to buy the next volume so fast.",992736000,7,1885,4.514619883040936
7935883,5,B00005AVRV,"No Spoilers Here...
This DVD continues the saga established in the previous six discs with everyone's favorite fine young Gundanium mecha pilots still struggling to find peace, themselves, happiness and a place in the ever changing world After Colony 195. As with any serialized program like Gundam Wing, it is rather important for the viewer to have some (or a lot) of knowledge about the current state of affairs in the series prior to viewing this disc or a serious case of ""WHAT?"" could result.
Operation 7 covers a fair amount of ground and introduces some new characters as well as filling in NUMEROUS details about some character relations and personal information about the mechs as well as their pilots and those who seek to help them / protect them / steal them away / destroy them... can't someone just hold these boys close and leave them alone... perhaps on Operation 8???  No flashback filled episodes and while there are a great deal of romance and intrigue, this disc disc ups the ante on combat and strives to bring the reality of combat even closer than before.
A master work continues [and my japanese friends say that this is ""Kiddie"" gundam... can't wait for the ""serious"" Gundam] to build on a strong foundation.
The DVD transfer and encoding is a great improvement on the previous disc including a MUCH smoother transition feature and at least some attempt to incorporate better ""extras"" and some better  use of the advantages of the digital technology.  The trailers and additional materials are a nice touch and overall this disc looks MUCH better over all... about time, BANDAI.
My copy of Endless Waltz is STILL sealed and awaiting the last ""episode"" DVD to be released.

7935884,5,B00005AVRV,"i love these epsodes (mostly because i am in them).  don't i rule?  i may not have a twin buster rifle or dragon fangs, but i have the strongest beam saber!  so buy this dvd!  it's got some of the best episodes in the entire series.  in these episodes, heero gets really close to being blown to bits inside of his own wing gundam by a virgo mobile doll when a crazy leo pilot saves him.  heero goes to some mansion looking place after the leo pilot says something like: ""protect master treize, i beg you"" and then dies.  heero, being the cold-hearted gundam pilot that he his, leaves him there.....  this is taking too long.  anyways, treize gives him me, the epyon to take out for a spin and heero goes nuts and kills everything that moves.  there, finished.",990489600,,759,4.357142857142857
7935885,4,B00005AVRV,"When I first saw Gundam Wing,  I never thought that much of it.  I could never really get into it, probably because I thought the english dubbing was pretty bad. But I started watching the DVD's(in the original Japanese voices) from the beginning and found that Gundam Wing is actually deeper then it looks.  The story is quite political and serious(It's no Evangelion, but what is) and it does grow on you with time.  In these episodes, the story starts to really move into high gear with the intro of the Gundam Epyon which has the same system as the Wing Zero...driving the pilot crazy.  All in all, a good series.",990316800,,617,4.5225225225225225
