The people in this movie are his closest friends, james and I are actually business partners, the person that wrote the ignorant comment sounds like a jealous brother...but remember, the brothers were the one that craved after the white woman first , and would leave a sister standing in the cold. Get over it...",1338854400,,448,4.756410256410256

This film was just terrible!  The actors have bad timing.  Stupid stuff happens.  A journalist formally interviews a cop, but that interview takes place in a car, rather than a professional setting.  A character supposedly gets shot, but when you see him he has no blood or bullet wounds on him.  There are poorly-choreographed fight scenes too.

Cultural critics have consistently critiqued Spanish-language media for centering white-looking or light-skinned Latinos over darker Latinos or those clearly of color.  This film follows that shameful trend.  This takes place on the East Coast, yet hardly anyone is brown or black!?  Where are the Latinos who are Rosie Perez's shade?  Where are the ones who look like Sammy Sosa?  As much as this movie tries to promote Latino pride, it's basically Eurocentric.

This was an absolute stinker!  You have been warned!",1256428800,,1067,5.1104651162790695
