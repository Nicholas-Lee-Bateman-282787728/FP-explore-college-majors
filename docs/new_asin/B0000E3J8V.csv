8001997,5,B0000E3J8V,"I have found the Big Adventure Series movies to be well made, educational and great for keeping the attention of children ages 3 to 7.  The Big Auto Plant is a movie that shows how the Mercedes M class series is made from start to finish.  Though it may sound like it would not keep the interest of a child, the narration of the Big Series movies and the way they are made works like magic.  I am a big fan of these movies and so are the kids I work with.",1223424000,,455,3.9239130434782608

I was looking for something to use as an introductory training tool for a medium sized manufacturing firm and thought I might at least find small segments that could be used for an adult audience.  I was pleasantly surprised that even though it was intended for an audience between ages 3-10, it is still quite informative for adults as well.",1205366400,,456,4.7594936708860756
