3093407,5,B0012Q3SYG,"A genuine piece of history. The Paul segment is OK, the Ringo segment is he being his usual charming self. You gotta love Ringo.

The real value of this disc set is the full show that aired roughly 24 hours after John died, built around a re-airing of his 1975 interview with Tom.

The interview is fascinating, a nice blend of humor and John's sometimes caustic memories. He's clever but understated. Tom is his usually nebbish self, kind hearted, a bit star struck, a square in a leisure suit but extremely sympathetic to the counterculture. Rest in peace, Tom, you were a good man. You before anyone turned us on to the Jam and the Clash and many others...

But above all this disc transmits what a crushing event had taken place the night before. Columnist Lisa Robinson and producer Jack Douglas are interviewed a day after someone they knew well was taken from all of us, and they're shellshocked. As we all were.

It's hard to explain to someone too young to remember that night, but John's death was to my generation the greatest shock and deepest cultural heartbreak since Robert Kennedy's death. Think of it... more phone calls were made that night in this country than at any time in history, according to phone company stats. It was so strange... the way we all had to reach out to someone we love to help us get through it. Calling friends who hadn't heard the news.... and hearing them break down on the phone. Such a horrible night, as though we'd lost someone in our family. I remember watching this show as people around me openly sobbed, even after we thought we had no tears left. If you were ""there"" this disc may be difficult to watch, but it pays ample honor to an exceptionally talented man that to this day is in our hearts.",1208995200,23,1748,4.522151898734177
3093408,5,B0012Q3SYG,"THE TOMORROW SHOW WITH TOM SYNDER is a two-disc dvd set showing separate in-depth interviews with three of the Beatles: John, Paul, and Ringo.

DVD #1 - John Lennon - TRT Approx. 65 minutes

Features The Tomorrow Show's John Lennon tribute, which aired the night after he was murdered 12-09-80, containing a previous show that Lennon appeared on in 1975. That interview runs about 45 or so minutes and discusses everything from Beatlemania to Yoko's involvement in the group. Synder also asks Lennon how he feels about the success of his previous bandmates. The second segment talks about Lennon's immigration problem in New York City and Synder and Lennon are joined by John's immigration attorney Leon Wildes (to find out more about this case get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-U-S-vs-John-Lennon/dp/B000LP5CX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The U.S. vs. John Lennon</a>).
Once the show is done playing, the scene cut backs to the--then--current day and Synder is joined by journalist/writer Lisa Robinson and music producer Jack Douglas(produced&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Double-Fantasy/dp/B00004WGEK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Double Fantasy</a>)and they talk about John Lennon and Yoko Ono and what he was like at home etc.
I found the interviews fascinating to watch and Synder is an expert at asking difficult questions without turning his guest off.

DVD #2 - Paul and Linda McCartney; Ringo Starr and wife Barbara Bach (Angie Dickinson-Segment 2). These are two shows: the McCartneys interviewed on one and Starr/Dickinson on the other.

On the McCartney show(air date 12-20-79), Synder interviews Paul and Linda about their group ""Wings"" and asks about the difficulty in starting another group that's not the Beatles and whether or not the Beatles will reunite. He also asks them about touring etc., and how Linda became involved in ""Wings"" when she didn't come from a musical background. A music video called ""Spin It On"" by the group is also shown.

The show featuring Ringo aired on 11-25-81 and Ringo had just released an album(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stop-and-Smell-the-Roses/dp/B000002TRR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stop and Smell the Roses</a>). They talk about his marriage to Barbara Bach(who joins them half way through), how ""Ringo"" got his name, and why he always perceived himself as the dumb one in the group(which Synder quotes from an article in Rolling Stone magazine)and how he felt after Lennon's murder. Very informative and Ringo is entertaining and funny as usual, but the segment is way too short, running at 25-minutes.

Although I enjoyed the interview with Angie Dickinson, I would have liked to have a full show with just Starr.

The quality  of each show is pretty good, of course it doesn't look as sharp as though it were done today, but it works. All in all I would recommend this to any Beatle fan or fan of either John, Paul, or Ringo or Wings.",1207526400,30,3026,5.679203539823009

Lennon is just ridiculously honest and all of these were made before PR guys had soundbytes programmed into the mouths of the talent and Tom Snyder asked some  of the most ludicrous and  off the wall questions which all  ads to the fun.  More than a curiosity (as many of these DVDs of old shows are) all three of the fab four say interesting things and this set will get repeated viewing.
I can't  recommend this strongly enough.  If you are a Beatles fan (who isn't?) or a fan of pop culture or music in general...just amazing!

8247203,5,B0012Q3SYG,"Interesting mix of interviews between Tom Snyder and John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and Ringo Starr. The interview with Lennon included more about his life and time with the Beatles. The interview with McCartney was less interesting in that he and the members of Wings were interviewed via satellite prior to one of their performances. Sir Paul seemed more interested in promoting the Wings tour at the time then discussing his time with the Beatles or other noteworthy anecdotes. The interview with Ringo was more interesting it was after Lennon's death so he did reminisce a bit about John and his feelings toward the loss of his friend. Still overall a very interesting compilations of interviews. If this sort of DVD interests you I would suggest purchasing the Dick Cavett shows featuring John and Yoko and one episode with George Harrison.",1386460800,,843,5.0285714285714285
8247204,4,B0012Q3SYG,"Tom Snyder's replay of an interview and salute to John Lennon on the day after his murder is touching, hearfelt and brings a sense of being ""back there"" to the viewing. Lennon is open, honest and sincere in his interview. That is in contrast to the Paul McCartney interview which feels forced and hurried. Paul and Linda look very uncomfortable and Snyder a little rude in the beginning. No revelations here...just standard celebrity fluff. The Ringo interview is fun and enjoyable as he hawks his fine film ""Caveman"".
Worth the money for the Lennon interview, the others are nice to have.",1260316800,3,589,4.841584158415841
8247205,3,B0012Q3SYG,"This 2-DVD collection is comprised of TV interviews done by Tom Snyder on his late-night talk show ""Later"", broadcast during the late 1970's-early '80's. Disc 1 is a moderately insightful interview with John Lennon that was done in 1975, possibly his last televised interview. It is here being re-broadcast one day after his murder as a type of tribute. He talks some of the Beatles, the music of the day, drugs, songwriting,and some time is spent on his then immigration problems. His lawyer is also present for some of this. Later on Disc one, we are brought to the present (1980) with interviews one day after his death by interviews with Lennon interviewer and journalist Lisa Robinson and Jack Douglas, his producer on ""Double Fantasy"" and who had just left Lennon hours earlier. Total running time of Disc 1- 65 minutes.
Disc 2 is comprised of 3 separate interviews. The first is an interview done via satellite with Paul & Linda McCartney (originally broadcast on 12/1979) right before a concert in London. They speak of their music with Wings, some of the past with the Beatles, how they met, etc. No real nuggets of wisdom here. Wings' members Denny Laine and Laurence Juber join them for a time, and there is a clip of a music video of ""Spin It On"", something they had been working on. I felt as if Paul was trying to guide Snyder thru his clumsy interview process.
The second interview is with Ringo and his new wife Barbara Bach, originally broadcast 11/81. He is somewhat emotional talking of Lennon's murder, also speaks of his role in ""Caveman"", his bout with partying too much, and his new LP ""Stop And Smell The Roses"". There is a clip of a music video of his ""Wrack My Brain"".
The 3rd interview is part of the same program where Tom interviews actress Angie Dickinson. Total running time of Disc 2- 95 minutes.
It was a different time for television, and it is all the more enhanced by the naivette' that is part of Snyder's persona. He appears as if he is the only one who has ever considered asking about a Beatles' reunion like it is some big scoop or something. Actually, he shuffles uncomfortably like a bashful schoolboy when posing questions about drug use or the Beatles' experience with groupies.
All in all, a nice 2-Disc set if you are a big Beatles fan, a collector of stuff about Lennon's death, or are intrigued by classic television. I would try to find it for a fairly inexpensive price though.",1258070400,7,2428,4.635730858468677
