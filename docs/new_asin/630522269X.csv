993977,3,630522269X,"Poor Death has no game at all! Grazia is into him mostly because everyone else is boring. I wish we saw more of their relationship, and especially more why Grazia was so into him. Really, they should've spent more time together, period. But Death is amusing to watch. And the ending was great, because everyone is going: Grazia, NO! But Grazia responds with: Grazia, YES!

I guess this could be an allegory for a dying woman whose family won't acknowledge her upcoming death. The family members seek to shelter the woman from the horror of her death by not telling her she's ill. But she surprises them in the end: not only did she know she was dying, but she had accepted it.",1485993600,,688,4.548387096774194

994288,5,630522269X,"There is a pagan, mythic quality to this film...even though we first meet the beauty Grazia in a Catholic Church.  True, her name means Grace, symbol of Jesus' power of resurrection and kindness, but the actress actually mirrors the image of the ""Three Graces"" of Greek mythology painted by the Renaissance artist Raphael. The resemblance is uncanny. Therefore, the film can be translated into both religious systems.

As in Greek myth, Death himself is a personality. The Greeks called him Thanatos.  As Homer describes him,  he is a swift messenger who delivers corpses to new destinations. In the film, Death is originally portrayed as a grey shadow - not quite black, but rather like a gateway to a mysterious world. The pagan texture of the film is enhanced by the Renaissance villa in which the events take place - with its blooming gardens, ancient clocks, winding staircases, and stone lion figures.

As the reader of this review knows, Death decides to assume the mantle of a mortal being for three days; he is curious to discover what is so special about human life. During his lonely centuries of work, Death accepted lives indiscriminately, believing that all human pursuits were pointless.  Only at the end of his three days, when he falls deeply in love with Grazia, can he comprehend this wonderful aspect of humanity.  This, then, is why the film is always recognized as a romance.

A symbolic scene: When Death translates himself into a prince, he arrives at the villa and announces himself. All the other guests of the villa bow to him...but when he first sees Grazia, he first bows to her.  This is evidence of her quasi-divine status.

In fact there is no violence in the film at all.  When Death takes a holiday, people do not die.  We learn the reasons they do die usually occur because of their own negligence, recklessness, or stupidity.  When one of the guests at the Italian villa remarks that in a battle, the weapons of both sides are not working, Death assures him that mankind will not give up wars. Death is only giving man a temporary respite.

This particular movie cannot be made in color - it needs the haunting quality of its gorgeous cinematography of black and white...and the exquisite costumes that Hollywood created in the 1930's.  Evelyn Venable as ""Grazia"" is an ethereal beauty.  I never understood why she did not become a major star of the movies.  Nevertheless, in this film she will be remembered forever.

Ask yourself this question - to obtain eternal love, would you embrace Death?  The women in the villa are given this choice....and they provide their own answers.

In the 21st century, the word ""love"" is misused and dishonored.  People say they love their new clothes or love their amazing smart phones.  See this movie and discover what love is really supposed to be about.",1358812800,,2829,4.801652892561983

994290,4,630522269X,"Watched cause we like Meet Joe Black so much and it is presumably loosely based on this movie. A bit like a stage play, really, but it works well and it's well done and interesting to the art and values of the early 30's on display. Frederick march is good.",1352073600,,257,4.16
994291,1,630522269X,"Like one reviewer has stated, Death Takes A Holiday is a five star film but this overpriced bootleg copy selling at $18 a pop is highway robbery.

How is this form of producing a movie for sell any different than those illegal bootlegs that can cost someone up to 5 years in prison?  And yes this goes not only for Amazon but for Warner Brothers' Archive Series as well.

  Do yourself a favor and buy Meet Joe Black: The Ultimate Edition.

994374,4,630522269X,"Made in 1934, this is certainly one of Hollywood's golden oldies - any film that is still powerful 77 years after it was made is indeed a classic. If all you know is the lengthy & boring ""Meet Joe Black,"" you owe it to yourself to see the simplicity and charm of the original, of which it was based. At less that 90 minutes, this version still holds up - the villa, costumes and characters are all golden age Hollywood. The quality of the DVD could be better, as the film has obviously not been very well re-mastered - but it's great fun to see Fredric March as Prince Sirki, arguably the definitive Angel of Death, and to just enjoy seeing a genuine piece of the magic of old Hollywood. That there is still interest in this old classic is testament to its longevity and power - I think it's safe to say that no one will be watching ""Meet Joe Black"" 77 years from now... heck, nobody is watching or talking about it now!",1326067200,6,920,4.2628571428571425

He attracts the attention of all the ladies including the lovely Grazia (Evelyn Venable) who becomes enmeshed in the ultimate fatal attraction-with Death itself. Will love prove stronger than death?

994438,5,630522269X,"From the moment a strange shadow seems to be following the car lovely Evelyn Venable is riding in the mood for this beautiful and darkly romantic film is set. When death itself takes on physical form to understand better why humans fear him so, the stage is set for a rich and unusual film experience.

One of the great films of the 1930's, it is not as well-remembered as it should be. There is a strange and almost haunting atmosphere to what in the end is really a romantic look at love itself. Fredric March gives a solid performance as that which we most fear but do not understand. He is appropriately over the top and out of place on earth. Evelyn Veneable is memorable as the girl, Grazia, who Prince Sirki (March) comes to love; he experiencing for the first time what it means to be human.

But the world becomes chaotic while Death is on his vacation and Sirki must return to his grim duties. The question is whether the lovely Grazia will still fear him or choose love, even if it means going with him to what lies beyond. It is talky but so full of its darkly romantic atmosphere that it is almost hypnotic. This is truly a masterpiece of mood, the perfect blend of subject matter and atmosphere.

March's ""Death"" is the focal point but Henry Travers has some fine moments among a cast which includes Gail Patrick. It is Venable herself who carries this film, however, her beautiful eyes and face capturing with emotion and expression both fear and love. It is a true shame more films of this quality did not come her way in the 1930's.

I have never forgotten the first time I saw this film and having seen it more than once since that time have still found beauty in its presentation of love which might live far beyond the shadow which follows us all.

994442,3,630522269X,"We, as human beings, search for the meaning in bad things which happen to us, and we may find our belief systems just don't hold up anymore. Finding meaning is not the same as finding rewards. ""During a lenghty illness, we have a chance to make life changes while the person is still alive -- and we may be much readier to 'move on' that those dealing with a sudden death. We have to consider the unexpectedness of an auto accident which takes the life of a young person, which brings anguish due to the circumstances. We could not say goodbye or tell the loved one how much we love them. It's an overwhelming reality which leads to extreme sadness.

Those who are having trouble finding direction ""may have hidden anger, which can masquerade as depression."" One widow divulged, ""I have this hangover of a depression and have been diagnosed with post-traumatic disorder...have flashbacks and nightmares."" Certain areas of one's life take longer to heal than others. ""A lot of time goes toward digging deep in the wound and getting out the infection."" One mother admitted, ""Every year for Christmas, I still get a game for my kids"" even though they are past the age for such games. The main thing is to stay active and creative; see yourself as someone with something to offer the world. Staying connected with others, which those in bad relationships sometimes forfeit for the sake of peace is critical for mental health."" Don't take anything for granted. We have to help ourselves to 'let go' and 'move on' to pursue our own lives. Life doesn't have to be perfect to be fulfilling. ""Letting go of my desires, of believing I knew best, and just spreading my wings, was my spiritual awakening."" Spirituality forged during desperate times ""is uniquely meaningful."" Although our culture generally sees death and bereavement in negative terms, ""there is a richness to the grief process that is seldom acknowledged.""

Sometimes we grow not by learning lessons from the dead but by dealing with the aftermath of a death."" The more you think about others in terms of a higher power as practiced in the principles of Al-Anon, the more peace you have. ""It helped me forgive myself for not being able to help her more.""

Here is a good metaphor for the year following a loved one's death: ""When you plant winter wheat, you look around, everything is bleak. You plant it, and nothing happens...but, when you least expect it, the following spring -- there it is!"" Ofttimes, a sign appears to ease the pain such as a ""glorious shooting star as it cross the dark, winter sky."" After seeing the star, ""I began to think that there was something beyond myself...the possibility that our spirits and the spirits of human beings everywhere remain connected even after death.""

Some lingering slow deaths bring a sense of relief to the person left behind: such losses can sometimes transform our lives in dramatic and positive ways. Barbara Wood, in her book GOOD GRIEF, wrote: ""The realisation can not only be liberating but also prevents long-term feeling of alienation, especially in situations like the loss of a parent."" My dad's death, though I was no part of it, enabled me to return to a place I loved where life was good for me, growing up with a fierce independence and determination. After some hardships, I met the right people to set me on a path to make a public service poor folks in particular need to survive a little better. God had a mission for me in my hometown, and the unsettled life prepared me for the task of speaking up for others. God does indeed work in mysterious ways.",1162166400,,3579,4.712460063897764

And instead of being separate they were related death and life and love. I loved the dialect. The words they used were English in its proper usage. The romance was in the words not the characters. I was moved by the audio of this film. I actually understood it better than the modern day Joe Black which was made for visual purposes. I love the old films they had lessons and meanings today most just sell sex. This film is how you portray a message without desire but just what if death could take a holiday and fell in love? Unselfish but selfish he wanted to take a break from his job only to learn in his job there was love. People needed to cross over so people could enter a new realm where I believe love calls for them.

994510,4,630522269X,"Based on an Italian play that performed on Broadway in 1929, the 1934 DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY would be the inspiration for the 1998 Brad Pitt film MEET JOE BLACK--but whereas MEET JOE BLACK proved a highly literal interpretation of the theme, DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY is unexpectedly lyric in tone.

The story is a fantasy.  Death has grown weary of the fear he inspires in human beings, and in an effort to understand the tenacity to which they cling to life he decides to take a three day ""holiday.""  He accordingly presents himself at the house of an Italian nobleman as ""Prince Sirki,"" and soon discovers that human beings pass their lives in games, none of them of any great importance or interest.  But there is one ""game"" he has yet to play: love.

Like many films of the early 1930s, the script is a bit talky and the cinematography a bit static; with the exception of Evelyn Venable (as Grazia) and Henry Travers (as Baron Cesarea) the cast, including the usually subtle Frederic March, tend to play in a somewhat theatrical manner.  Even so, the overall tone of the film is unexpectedly touching, lyrical, and strangely lovely.  It is also, on occasion, gently humorous.  And before Death resumes his true identity and returns to the business of mortality, we receive unexpected food for thought.

The film is not widely available on either DVD or VHS, nor is it frequently televised.  That is unfortunate, for fans of 1930s cinema will find it darkly charming.  Worth seeking out!

Yes, it was a little creepy, but that was part of its charm. So I already had an image in my mind for many years when I saw ""Meet Joe Black."" For all its lavishness, and while I admired Anthony Hopkins' performance, ""Joe Black"" was too long, and the payoff wasn't there.

Ironically, these stiffs are already half dead. They have nothing to say yet prattle on endlessly about it. Death isn't much better. I fell asleep & had to rewind a bit. It didn't matter.

On re-screening it recently, I found that some scenes had lingered in my memory for 43 years.  Death takes human form temporarily to satisfy his curiosity about why we humans fear him so much.  During his ""holiday"", no one dies.  The idea that a moratorium on death for a few days would not become immediately obvious and would not cause screaming headlines worldwide cannot be taken seriously, nor can the entire film.  (Check out the climactic announcement, ""He is -- Death!!""  Very melodramatic.)  This is a film that requires a huge suspension of disbelief, but if you do so, you will enjoy it.  Fredric March was an unusual choice to portray Death, but he does his typically fine job.

994516,4,630522269X,"I watched this for the second time today and picked up a lot of details that I missed the first time.
For one thing, notice that the flowers that Grazia and Company are scattering about - they're white chrysanthemums. In Italy those are funeral flowers, just like the white roses they used to put in the folded hands of dead people. Another thing I noticed was the clock. Not just the face of the clock but the scythe and the snake carved into the top of it. The snake, I do not know if it has any particular meaning, but the scythe should be obvious enough.
I also found much subtle humour in the dialogue... making it worthy of laughs without distracting from the sombre theme of the film. Of course there are all the melodramatic love-speeches, but those are fun to listen to. And there are the two women at war for the attentions of the very attractive and mysterious Sirki. With a name like Sirki and from a country called Talba-Alexandri (or whatever it was), who could resist? Anyway, they are quite funny to watch, fighting over the Prince. And, by the way, Prince Sirki's snazzy outfits were some of best (I think) of Fredric March's career.
Overall I enjoyed the movie so very much the second time - it's definitely one of my favourite Fredric March films. I recommend it highly.",1031616000,6,1289,4.512820512820513

DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY proved that Mitchell Leisen, wielding a strong, dramatic sense together with a delicacy of touch, was a valuable addition to the studio's directors' list, on which he would remain for 18 years. The multi-awarded playwright Maxwell Anderson wrote the screenplay with Gladys Lehman and Walter Ferris, basing it on a play by Alberto Casella about the Angel of Death assuming human form. He visits a country house as a mysterious prince, fascinating but frightening all with whom he encounters....... E.

There is no need to ""hold a candle"" when this movie lights up the sky like a tremendous bonfire and diminishes ""Meet Joe Black"" to nothing other than the pompous, overblown, flickering, faltering travesty that it is.
This is film-making in the grand manner.  Story and mood and gentle, tender revelation are what it is about.  Not blaring, mood-setting music and uninspired acting.  There is room for humor and play in this movie and here it is honest, clean, and without self-conscious effort.
The lovely actress, Evelyn Venable, in the role of the woman who makes Death wish he were human -- she is fine and wonderful.  And the rest of the cast is excellent as well.

994613,5,630522269X,"I was very hesitant to see this original movie after being tortured by it's remake, MEET JOE BLACK.  I finally worked up the courage to see this film, and what a film it is!!
When I reference overacting in my review subject, I'm not referring to any of the leads.  Frederic March is just wonderful as Death.  Completely suave and charming, with some uncomprehension of this life and a few handfuls of macabre statements thrown in for good measure.  If anyone else was saying most of the dialog March had, I would think it was over the top, and lame.  But when he says it, I just sit back and sigh.  Especially the ending, when he's trying to persuade Grazia to leave him before he turns back into Death.  In my book, one of the most touching scenes in any romance movie.
Now, the great overacting I reference in the subject pertains to the supporting actors.  They have some fabulously screwy scenes, where their acting is over the top and wonderful.  This is best illustrated when Duke Lambert has to tell his guests who Prince Sirki really is.  ""He is the one you fear most ... "" <big gasp from the crowd> "" ... he is death."" <even bigger gasp from the crowd>  How can you not crack up at that scene?  Look for Henry Travers (a.k.a. Clarence the angel) in a fun role.
And the bad overacting in the subject?  Well, that, of course, is Brad Pitt.  Poor fellow can't tell the difference between being mysterious and acting like an imbecile.  Oh well.  At least he gave it a try.  Hopefully, he, and the director of MEET JOE BLACK learned their lesson.  It's a bad idea to mess with perfection.",983664000,19,1592,4.412371134020619
