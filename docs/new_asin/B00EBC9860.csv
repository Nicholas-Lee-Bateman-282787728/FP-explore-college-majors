8603492,5,B00EBC9860,Options for the arm bars and variations are amazing as well as everything else in the video.  I'm a white belt still but it helps watching these options to know what is available.  It's not in my muscle memory but in the head when I'm rolling and at a transition period.  All of his dvds are really great.,1385942400,3,305,4.224137931034483
