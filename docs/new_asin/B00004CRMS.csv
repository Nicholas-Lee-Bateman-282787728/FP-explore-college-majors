8223559,5,B00004CRMS,"This has long been one of my Top 5 L&H shorts, one of the ones I know by heart.  Many people have noticed that a number of L&H sound shorts make selective use of dialogue, and it's particularly true here.  Stan doesn't speak until about 8 minutes into it, and all of the dialogue combined, from both Stan, Ollie, and the other people present is outweighed by how much of the short takes place devoid of dialogue.  I could easily see this one having worked as a silent.  The boys are construction workers, and of course, just about everything that could go wrong at work does.  They also have a number of run-ins with Charley Hall, a short little guy who often played their foil, and was very effective at it because he had a really short temper and was a great physical contrast to Ollie, the one whom he usually had the disagreements with.  The final reel never fails to put me in stitches.  It's almost completely silent, as Stan gets a paintbrush stuck on Ollie's chin and labors to remove it by any means possible.  He finally gets all of it off, but Ollie gets really annoyed when the hose in his hand sprays water all over his face.  As Stan is hurrying to turn the sink off, Ollie pulls on the hose to try to yank it out of the sink and get the water shut off even quicker.  It totally backfires, as he manages to yank the sink out of the wall, which gets him pulled around on some sort of belt drive leading into a very long water chute.  When he finally ends up at the end of this hilarious ordeal, Stan climbs a ladder to get to him and can only say, ""You dropped this,"" and Ollie thanks him for giving him his hat.  Then a barrel of lacquer goes through the chute as well, forcing both men off of the ladder and on top of a small house, demolishing it in the process.  As they're fleeing the scene of all of the chaos, their car gets sawed in half, but there's one small comfort left for them when Stan realises that their primitive ""car radio"" of sorts is still working.",1137369600,,1982,4.225464190981432
