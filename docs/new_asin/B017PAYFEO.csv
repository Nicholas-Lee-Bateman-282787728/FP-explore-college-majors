8739971,3,B017PAYFEO,"A dying old man tells his daughter that he is not her father. Her father was an old, overbearing man killed by his suffering wife. The daughter is told that her mother is in prison or dead. When the old man dies, the young girl has to make her own way in the world-a harsh, cruel world. This film is a stage play transferred to the screen. The acting is stilted, and the story is simple. The film is watchable.",1503619200,,410,4.1375
8739972,5,B017PAYFEO,"As a silent film enthusiast, I am constantly amazed at the rediscovery of old movies long thought to be lost. Many were discovered in archives in Russia and Eastern Europe after the fall of the Soviet Union. However, occasionally, some turn up in unexpected places like THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC in a closet in a Norwegian asylum or a Mary Pickford film in a barn in New England. THE UNDESIRABLE was recently located in the basement of a Hungarian culture center in New York and returned to Hungary for restoration. The movie is a major find as it gives us the opportunity to view an early work from his native country of one of Hollywood's legendary directors .

Mikhaly Kertesz (who would become Michael Curtiz in America and later direct CASABLANCA) made this 1915 adaptation of a then well known Hungarian play. While the scenario is a pretty standard affair of a servant falsely accused of theft, the film is a remarkable historical document of turn of the 20th century Hungary. The peasant costumes worn by all the characters are visually striking and absolutely authentic (because they're the real deal) while the use of outdoor locations are like picture postcards. Although there is no camera movement in a film of this vintage, Curtiz's camera setups are direct and effective and show an early eye for how to compose a shot.

The performances are a little broad at times but then the characters are meant to be country folk. The actors occasionally step out and gesture directly to the camera (like an aside on stage) but that was normal for European silent cinema at this time. The story concerns a young village girl who goes to the city and finds employment as a maid. After being falsely accused of theft (making her THE UNDESIRABLE of the title), she is forced to go back to her village where her mother, whom she thought dead, has returned after being in jail for murdering her abusive husband. There is a reunion and a highly unexpected twist before the happy ending.

The restoration which took almost a year is absolutely stunning and the film looks gorgeous though I question the use of some of the color tints employed . Why are the city living room scenes gold for example or the return trip to the village green? Also some of the title cards are translated as if in peasant dialect ""I am a honest girl"" or ""she tried to flirt me"". The title cards are also ""leaders""  telling us what is going to happen rather than what is happening. The newly commissioned score by Attila Pacsay is wonderfully atmospheric and idiomatic especially during the wedding finale. Another excellent silent offering from Olive Films. More please!",1488499200,6,2646,4.720779220779221
8739973,5,B017PAYFEO,"I feel incredibly lucky to own this Blu-ray disc.  The fact that this film even exists, and in such pristine condition, and with such an amazing restoration and a beautiful new score... is mind boggling.  This is perhaps the most stunning silent film restoration I've ever seen among the hundreds of home video releases I've viewed over the years.  You'll be hard pressed to find a single scratch throughout the film's 66 minutes.  The film itself is also a joy to behold, especially when you consider that this is pre-Birth of a Nation.  Bravo to the restoration team, and bravo to Olive Films!  If you're a fan of silent cinema, this disc is an absolute no-brainer.",1472342400,2,667,4.706896551724138
8739974,5,B017PAYFEO,"I was skeptical when I bought this.  But this restoration is outstanding.  The accompaniment is appropriate and well done.  The storyline is really very good and quite enjoyable.  There were a couple of mis-spellings on the title cards, but I can forgive that.",1454371200,7,260,4.976744186046512
8739975,4,B017PAYFEO,"The Undesirable is a 1914 silent film by director Michael Curtiz. Betty (Lili Berky), a young woman living in the country, is told by her dying father that he is really her uncle and raised her as his own after her mother was sent to prison for killing her husband. Alone and not knowing her mothers fate, Betty travels to the city in search of work. There she finds employment as a maid in the home of a wealthy couple and their handsome son, Nick (Victor Marconi). Betty falls in love with Nick and is fired after being unjustly accused of theft. The drama escalates with the sudden appearance of Bettys mother Sarah (Mari Jaszai), presumed dead but recently released from prison, on a quest of her own to find her daughter.

Thought to be lost forever, a print of The Undesirable was recently discovered in the basement of the Hungarian House cultural center in New York and returned to Hungary for restoration. The eight-month restoration and digitalization process was accomplished by the Hungarian Filmlab, with support from the Hungarian National Digital Archive and Film Institute and the Hungarian National Film Fund and funding from the Hungarian National Film Foundation.

The film is of particular interest because Curtiz went on to become one of Hollywoods leading directors, responsible for Casablanca, The Adventures of Robin Hood, Captain Blood, Yankee Doodle Dandy, The Sea Hawk, Mildred Pierce, White Christmas and many others. He cast Bing Crosby, Joan Crawford, Errol Flynn, Doris Day, Cary Grant, John Garfield, Elvis Presley, John Wayne, Humphrey Bogart, William Powell, Irene Dunne and James Cagney, among others.

The restored version, not rated, features a newly commissioned score by Attila Pacsay performed by the Pannonia Symphony Orchestra, and conducted by Peter Illenyi. The Blu-ray release is in black and white in the 1:33 aspect ratio. There are no bonus extras.",1453420800,14,1896,5.090032154340836
