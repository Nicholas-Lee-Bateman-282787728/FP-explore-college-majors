8403795,5,B003RLA626,"In ""Fruit Fest"" Alton Brown gets into apples, strawberries, and bananas in a big way. These are all great episodes using quintessential fruits central to American cuisine. Of the recipes he details here one of my favorites is ""It's a Wonderful Waldorf"" from ""Apple Family Values"", where he discusses variations on the ubiquitous Waldorf Salad: though I don't care for some of his additions to the classic dish (like red onion and curry powder, both of which I like, just not here), I appreciate his opening up the recipe with an emphasis on balance. From ""Strawberry Sky"" the recipe for ""Strawberry Pudding"" was my favorite of the bunch, and used the most interesting preparation techniques, while ""Top Banana"" yielded tips for perfect fried plantains. All these and several other recipes are printed in the handy mini-recipe booklet included with the DVD, but I recommend watching the episodes first to see how it's done.

Alton Brown is a great teacher, and ""Fruit Fest"" is a particularly fruitful (sorry) DVD, as these foods are such basic and healthy staples that everyone could use some ideas about how to get more of them into their diets. Like other ""Good Eats"" DVDs, I highly recommend ""Fruit Fest"".",1438905600,,1207,4.945812807881773
8403796,5,B003RLA626,"Alton Brown Good Eats. What else is there to say. I never learned how to cook. Now I am learning how to cook things that I like to eat properly. Am I a professional chef no. But alton brown and good eats is a good source for someone like me to learn how to cook what I like, and I should cook it to make it taste and look the way I want it to. I might even cook things now for others to eat. Thanks for the help alton.",1397865600,,418,3.6555555555555554
