You are going to need to take notes.  I THINK I have it figured out, and if so, it is a good ending, and the CG graphics are spectacular,  but non-players are going to spend most of this movie lost.

8709545,1,B00V7ORPOW,"Regardless of whether you've played the game or not, this movie is very lacking. While the animation and art style is great, there is just too much story to fit in its hour and thirty minute run time. You'd expect a hard to follow plot with undeveloped characters, instead you get a very simplified and altered version of what the original plot was, and no explanation for why things are happening. Supporting characters from the game are either missing or make the briefest of appearances, The World and its lively community is missing, they removed the tournament and any reason to explain its existence, and instead of being told really why Haseo is going somewhere or fighting someone (other then the premises of hunting down Tri-Edge) you just watch characters tell Haseo exactly what to do. The movie is overall fairly quite and slowly paced. There is a lot of hang time between scenes or bits of information, and when dialogue does come around, a good chunk of it is someone's name being shouted over and over... More then usual for an anime even. I say steer clear. It doesn't do the original games story or its characters any justice. Find the G.U. games if you can. Those are so much more worth your time. Oh, and not a single Grunty to be seen...",1454544000,,1257,4.616071428571429
