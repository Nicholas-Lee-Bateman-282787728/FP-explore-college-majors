8392438,2,B0039V1DS0,"I have been practicing yoga on and off for almost 20 years, mostly with the help of DVD's.  I wanted something fresh and maybe a little more challenging than what was already in my library, but this workout is ridiculous for your average 40 something year old to accomplish.  First, the models can't even keep up with his instructions nor master the poses.  How are we suppose to do it when most of the time our face is directed towards the mat? I did watch it before I tried it, that doesn't help all that much. He speaks much faster than I or his models can move and then when there is stumbling, he says ""Ah, you have lost your focus"", and I say ""No, you are walking around the room and talking too fast"". The warm up is actually quite nice, but once he moves on to all kinds of crazy hand stands and other things I may as well put on my sweats and get a bowl of popcorn, because all I could do is watch while my heat rate and sweat dissipated.  I got a laugh out of Mark's advise not to push yourself to do what others are doing and to do what is comfortable for your own body.  Well, exactly what should us at home do while he shows off and his models struggle?  I do not think such advanced poses have any place in a do at home exercise video. The more advanced aspects of yoga should be practiced and learned in a classroom and with an instructor present.  He can have a bus full of lawyers write disclaimers to show before the video (and he does have a lot of those), but people will try what he is demonstrating and hurt themselves.  Perhaps if you have the luxury of attending Mark's classes these tapes would serve as a useful reinforcement, but for those of us who have never attended his class, it is frustrating and demoralizing.  There are plenty of wonderful yoga teachers making videos, but I do not count this one as a keeper.",1334966400,5,1844,4.215909090909091
8392439,5,B0039V1DS0,I wanted a workout to stay in shape and something that gives me the best results in the shortest time. I found it! This is the absolutely best Yoga DVD set. I have tried a few other Yoga DVDs for a while but nothing matches this one.,1292198400,,233,3.978723404255319
8392440,5,B0039V1DS0,"I never really knew how yoga could be such a fantastic workout that it actually transforms your body shape along with strenght.  I am fortunate enough to also attend classes at the studio, and I have to say, I am impressed with the professionalism and knowledge the yoga instructors demonstrate.  I am going on an extended vacation (to Bali, no less), and I am excited to have the DVD's with me in my journey to enjoy the essence of what yoga instills.
Thank you, Mark...and Elizabeth and all the awesome yoga instructors!",1284336000,2,522,4.663043478260869
