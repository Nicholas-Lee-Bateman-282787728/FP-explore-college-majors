2625658,5,B000H1RFTG,"A film that makes you conscious of the structure of all films (after all, aren't all movies the same?). That's probably why some people gave negative reviews: people don't like to be conscious that they're watching a movie when they're watching a movie, living life unconsciously maybe. As another reviewer mentioned, we do have an audience in front of which we live life. Well, all you can do is give this one a try...",1228608000,,419,4.675675675675675
2625659,4,B000H1RFTG,"and you didn't even know it was there.. or so the plot device goes.. although what's funny is the way that EVERYONE DOES think they have a
little audience.. that they primp and preen for.. a camera in the corner
of the room that follows them about.. Although it's not a benevolent
force as it's depicted in this movie usually.  It's a sense of 'always being watched'.. as though life compared unfavorably to the TV show that you saw last night, well your life, but it was being taped nonetheless, but like documentary or real-world style.. and nobody really cares.. But Jeremy's character's determination to make the plot up himself or you know - to be the leading man in his own life is a challenge to all of us I think and a dang good one at that.  Too much arm chair generalism and not enough trooping about I say.  Let the football fantasists and the video game freaks come out of their caves for a minute and see the sunlight again before it's too late.  Seriously.  At some point it has to become dull playing an extra in your own life hasn't it??

I think it does anyway.

1 star detracted for slight sense of being 'overly happy'
This would never happen.  The guy would be seen as a charming
masher and the boyfriend's 'assholishness' is way over the top..
otherwise terrific late night brain candy, mid-late nite movie.",1220313600,,1328,4.481327800829876
2625660,5,B000H1RFTG,"I loved this film. Idiosyncratic, light-hearted and whimsical in tone, it was a lot of fun to follow the main character Blake's quest to avoid cliche and make something worthy of his movie/life. The remarkable charm of the lead actor, Jeremy Sisto, sells the film--I couldn't help rooting for the character as he set out to win a ""love interest"", compete with conventionally successful men, and overcome a ""suspicious character"". I knew Sisto previously for intelligently played, intense characters with a dark side; I really hope this actor continues to get quality leading roles to showcase his range and talent.

Alongside this storyline, Blake often addresses his audience (us), an entity he can't see but believes in and wishes to entertain and ultimately protect. This last element really intrigued me, because this fun, light film has underlying questions to raise just as Blake is revealed to be a man of depth who is not as insane as he seems. While my date and I watched the movie, we were laughing and smiling. Afterwards, we found ourselves talking about what it means to be a somebody vs. a nobody, fulfilling one's promise by doing something with life, worthiness, conformity, insanity vs. creativity, and settling for less. It particularly spoke to me as an artist, and I liked how, in a fun way, the film challenges the audience to be more than just an audience and to instead imagine that they themselves are the ""hero"" with their own stories worth telling and worth investment.

My only qualm is that I wished that the DVD offered more extras: deleted scenes and alternate endings that the director mentioned, cast commentaries, etc. It was clearly a film made for love rather than money (the first-rate cast worked for near nothing), and I'd love to see more films with this kind of originality.",1216166400,4,1814,4.905537459283388
2625661,4,B000H1RFTG,I just happen to see this film the other day and I loved it. Its a fun little film with witty diologe. Its funny and heart warming and enjoyable. Its a little Corney but in a good way. Take a chance and watch it.,1198627200,,212,3.840909090909091
2625662,5,B000H1RFTG,"The Movie Hero explores the role movies can have as inspiring us to live more fulfilling, more productive lives. I loved the metaphor of ""audiences"" being what connects people to each other.

If you think movies can be more than just entertaining diversions from ""real"" life, if you're looking for a movie that you can love for its IDEAS and not just it's jokes, dramatic moments, or special effects, then you will want to see this.",1183334400,3,432,4.684210526315789
2625663,5,B000H1RFTG,"What a great social commentary on life. There is a little bit of ""The Movie Hero"" in all of us.",1181520000,3,95,3.8
2625664,4,B000H1RFTG,"While this movie lacks A-list stars, it is surprisingly good comedy! It's a fun movie with the lead character talking to the camera a'la Ferris Bueller. Too bad this didn't get a wide release.",1169769600,5,192,4.676470588235294
8135907,4,B000H1RFTG,"Fun movie that breaks down the barriers of the ""4th Wall"" and interacts directly with the audience, involving them in the story. This is also a great movie for the study of the hero's journey. Jeremy Sisto is incredibly likable in this quirky movie that seems to have somehow fallen between the cracks.",1443052800,,302,4.716981132075472

8135910,4,B000H1RFTG,A delightful movie that reminds me of Grif the Invisible in that it uses apparent mental illness as a metaphor for finding oneself as well as that one person in all the world who is exactly right for you.,1419206400,,204,4.256410256410256
8135911,5,B000H1RFTG,"It's quirky and cute, surprising and original. It was sent to me on a mixed disk when I belonged to Stephan Simon's Spiritual Cinema Circle (highly recommended). I watched it many, many times and invited others to watch - just remember one person's fascination with a movie is not necessarily shared by all :o).  I bought this additional one because I wanted a copy that was not part of a disk selection.",1416614400,,404,4.611111111111111
8135912,5,B000H1RFTG,this is a fantastic movie with wonderful actors and is very funny.  I really enjoyed it from a theatre person and a psychological point of view.  its a great movie for everyone anytime.,1382140800,,185,4.575757575757576
8135913,5,B000H1RFTG,Awesome movie. Love it to pieces. Amazon was only place I was able to locate after searching every single place local and about a week online looking.,1380067200,,150,4.592592592592593
8135914,5,B000H1RFTG,"Jeremy Sisco at his best - cute- funny - passionate, whimsical - Gotta see!  You will want to watch over and over again",1363219200,,119,4.173913043478261
8135915,5,B000H1RFTG,"its not a usual movie...the meaning behind it, is very powerful in spiritual terms.
story is good. i watched it several times...and every time i enjoy it. Highly recommended.
try watching the movie with the eyes of..""life is a movie, who is watching this movie ?""
observe the observer!",1362009600,,285,4.836734693877551
8135916,4,B000H1RFTG,"Your life is a movie. You are the star. Naturally, you are heroic - noble, dauntless, brimming with optimism. It is your task to keep your audience entertained by inventing exciting plots and to keep them informed of all the developments, which you do by addressing them directly, regardless who might be within earshot. You have identified a suspicious character who is up to no good. You need a humorous sidekick to watch your back and set up your punch lines with his ""irreverent wit."" Most of all, you need a love interest, because what movie worth living doesn't have one?
  You fall to your knees in the aisle of an empty temple of cinema, popcorn and soda in hand, and pray: ""Our movie, which art on screen, hallowed by thy name. Thy time has come. Thy will be shown in theaters as well as home. Give us this day our daily film and forgive us our bad choices, as we forgive those whose movies were so bad to choose. And lead us not into television, but deliver us from that evil, for movies are the picture and the sound and the greatest thing in the whole wide world forever and ever. Movies rule.""
  Not everyone understands you. Although everyone is the star of their own movie and has their own audience, you are among the few who realize it. You are not discouraged that you are surrounded by the oblivious. You cheerfully accept the burden of clarity. You must stymie the Suspicious Character and steal the heart of your Love Interest from her Doomed Fiance. You are Blake Gardner, Movie Hero.
  You are, of course, as crazy as a bucket of crickets. That is why you occasionally bump heads with the law and why you have a court-appointed therapist. Backed into rationalization by Doctor Orlando, you voice that most perplexing question, ""What am I supposed to do with my life that will make me worthy of the life I was given?""
  In ""The Movie Hero"" (2003), writer-director Brad T. Gottfred transplants ""Don Quixote De La Mancha"" from the fertile plains of 17th century Castile to the sun-splashed boulevards of 21st century Hollywood. Cervantes' timeless satire on romance and adventure speaks to our dreams of greatness, of being something more than our simple self. Don Quixote's mind is overheated, addled by all the tales he has devoured of knights, damsels, and chivalry. Blake Gardner, inspired by movies, yearns for purpose, but will settle for assurance. He pleads with Doctor Orlando, ""Show me I'm not crazy. Show me I'm not a fool.""
  Jeremy Sisto is the amiably deranged Blake, seizing the role con mucho gusto. Brian White is his sensible Sidekick Antoine. A breathless Dina Meyer plays Blake's therapist and Love Interest, Elizabeth Orlando, while Carlos Jacott is her patronizing, movie-hating Doomed Fiance. Red guitar toting Peter Stormare, in black trench coat and black car is, as always, a perfect Suspicious Character.",1313971200,,2851,4.788187372708758
