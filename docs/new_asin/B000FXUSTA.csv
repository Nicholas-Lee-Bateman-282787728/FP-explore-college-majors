8127606,3,B000FXUSTA,"Most people who have seen all four movies of the Les Boys series would probably find this the least enjoyable. That being said, I have to confess enjoying the movie regardless. The movie started off great but dropped off a little towards the middle. But Les Boys will be Les Boys and the usual gags and banter were present as they were in the earlier movies. A notable absence is Ti-Guy (Patrick Huade) though. But Pierre LeBeau as the chain-smoking Meo is ever entertaining and amusing. By far, Meo has been my favourite character throughout the series. All in all a must for anyone who have seen the first three movies.",1307577600,,621,4.603603603603603
