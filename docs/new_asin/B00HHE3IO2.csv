6163463,5,B00HHE3IO2,"I also ordered this set hoping to get the first edition full body (57 minute workout) and the second edition full body (57 minute workout).  I received the 57 minute workout, 30 minute full body workout, arms/abs booster and the thigh/seat booster.  The description does state a completely different package from the one I actually received.  I gave it three stars mainly because the program itself is very good but Amazon/Physique 57 didn't deliver on what was advertised in the description.

""Update"" I upgraded my rating to 5 stars.  Here's why.  I contacted Amazon based on a comment made to my review.  The person's advice was to contact Amazon and that they would do what they can to rectify my situation. Amazon must have contacted Physique 57 on my behalf. Physique 57 sent me a replacement for the missing DVD. As far as customer service goes, Amazon did their usual A Plus service.  Physique 57 added the cherry on top of the sundae by sending me the missing DVD.

As far as the workout goes, I have done the Full Body Classic 1, I have done Express Full Body, and the Thigh and Seat Booster.  Wow, what a workout. It moves fast, there is no time to get bored.  I look forward to working out with this DVD set.  I recommend buying the book for more detailed explanations on some of the moves.  I can't do all the reps but I do what I can.  I look forward to progressing further with each workout. This is one of the best investments that I have ever made.",1391558400,6,1465,4.458646616541353

  Physique 57 Classic Full Body Workout
  Physique 57 Classic Full Body Workout: Second Edition DVD
  Arm & Ab Booster 30 minute Workout DVD
  Thigh & Seat Booster 30 Minute Workout DVD

I did not receive the Physique 57 Classic Full Body Workout : Second Edition DVD, instead I was sent the Express 30 minute DVD which is not equal to the 57 minute workouts.

Not happy at all, as I ordered the set mostly for the two main 57 minute workouts that it states I would receive. Hoping Amazon corrects this problem. I have emailed with no response yet.",1391558400,10,608,4.486238532110092
8632741,1,B00HHE3IO2,"I received an email from Amazon to check on my order.  My order should have 4 CDs which includes ""Physique 57 Classic Full Body Workout"" but this has been substituted without my knowledge or consent.  Instead, I am getting 4 Express workouts (each 30 min long).  There was no information on the Amazon site indicating this at the time of my order, that the Physique 57 Classic Full Body Workout would NOT be included.
Had I known this, I would probably have ordered a different set which would have included the longer 57 min workout, some express workouts, and the exercise ball.  Prior to this I did not see other people complaining of the very same situation, so beware should you place an order for this product.  Although I read reviews for most items I am considering, I did not see this information before. Perhaps this is a recent situation, but please be aware you could end up with a substitution!",1436745600,,907,4.608695652173913
8632742,4,B00HHE3IO2,"I needed a break from my usual high intensity high impact workout routines and my sister mentioned trying barre workouts. Now I actually own a couple of Tracy Anderson DVDs, but she turned me off the second she said women should never use more then 3 pound dumbbells (I strength train as well so hearing that was the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard) but thought what the heck I'll look for something different.

First of all I love the music in these workouts. I have a small arsenal of Jillian Michaels DVDs and while the workouts are great, the music is terrible in most of them.

For more background on me, I've done Insanity and Turbofire, strength train with heavy weights twice a week and I work out with a personal trainer once a week. These DVD's were the change in pace that I needed. My body was feeling a little worn out from all the high impact activities, and while I consider myself to be in pretty good shape, these exercise moves made me feel the burn in a completely different way then what I was accustomed to (in a good way). I still do my other workout videos, but work in the Physique 57 minute workout once on the weekends, and then maybe the Express or upper body another day of the week.

I do agree the main instructor does get a little annoying. Luckily the good music gives me a focal point so I can tune her out some.

BTW did I mention I hate thigh dancing? How can something so simple hurt so much?!?",1412467200,,1436,4.327137546468402
8632743,4,B00HHE3IO2,"This is an excellent all-around strength workout package. I've done Callanetics and Lotte Berk, and this is better than the best of those two methods. Tanya Becker figured out how to combine those with some weight training (you use light hand weights) and classic calisthenics (sit-ups, push-ups, etc) to make for a truly fantastic workout.

I only deducted a star from my rating because the language Tanya uses in the workouts bothers me, and I wanted to share that with potential buyers. A little about me: I am a person recovering from an eating disorder, exercise addiction, and body image issues, and I'm doing these workouts for general health maintenance, muscle building, and bone density building. A list of the words Tanya uses during the program: jiggle, pouch, fat cells, strapless dress, saddlebags, overhang, bathing suit, muffin top, calorie, overhang, cellulite, skinny jeans. Then to really make you feel really crazy, Tanya ends the 57-minute program with the benediction: ""Be at peace with your body.""

I realize I'm highly sensitive to this kind of language because it mirrors the internal chatter I lived with for years that drove me to starve, binge, purge, and overexercise. If it doesn't bother you, I'm happy your mind isn't as messed-up as mine is.

I really enjoy this workout, but I do it with the audio off because hearing this type of chatter three times a week would trigger me. The workout is set to great music--for once, a workout with music I like! I wish the DVDs had an audio option to play the workouts with music only, like some of Jillian Michaels' do.

Also, don't expect much from the flimsy blow-up ball that comes with the set. It's just a bonus. Do yourself a favor and buy a real playground ball.",1412121600,5,1742,4.816053511705686
8632744,1,B00HHE3IO2,"High hopes for this one due to all the celebrity recommendations.  EVERY instructor, on EVERY video, talk the ENTIRE time.  There is truly no break from their voices.  I eventually had to mute the video and put on my own music.  Exercises range from beginner to advanced and are some good ones within the mix.....but the talking, talking, talking!  No thanks.  Give T25 a look.  You can mute his voice and have music only and follow along.",1409011200,,439,4.623376623376624
8632745,3,B00HHE3IO2,Not sure about work out. Threw hip out of place with ball. Had to go to therapy. Work is probably fine. Do not want grade badly as I truly as I had to stop. Need to stick with my working with weight workout. People laugh but old Firm DVD's.,1407196800,,240,3.9183673469387754
8632746,5,B00HHE3IO2,"This is the most unique workout designed for women ever.  I lost 10 pounds in two months with this workout while on hormone replacement.  The nurses and doctors wanted to know what program I was doing at home and I took them to tge Physique 57 website.  I have boxes of workout DVDs and these are my go to home workouts.  I have degenerative arthritis in my back and this workout helps me and does not hurt me.  I hope that I include these weekly in my workouts and stick with them this time. The compliments are never ending.  If you want to try before you buy rent them on the website,  Sorry so long but I Refuse to let this program be a 3 stars.  I wish the positive comments would post but usually no one says anything unless they are upset.  I do the same ...... go to the website and try them...Awesome just awesome program.....",1406505600,2,835,4.234177215189874
8632747,5,B00HHE3IO2,"I am happy to say that I can now give this item a 5 star rating.  Initially, it would have been one star.  I had an issue in the beginning where the set they shipped me was not what I was promised.  They changed the picture and the DVD's on the website after the purchase was made and shipped me an inferior set instead.  This happened to several customers as stated in many reviews. I had sent an email with my complaint and wasn't hearing a response. Finally, the seller came through with an apology and said they would ship the right item to me immediately.  They did mail me the item that I did not receive.  I was very happy that they followed through as I told them I would change the rating from one to five stars if they would  do the right thing and send me what I had initially ordered.  That was greatly appreciated.  I love the workout system, and I did give it 5 stars.",1395532800,,882,4.141176470588236
8632748,5,B00HHE3IO2,"This is my first Physique 57 purchase, and it made me sore. You get an excellent wrokout for your legs, abs and butt. Not much cardio, but it works wonders still.",1393891200,,162,4.258064516129032
8632749,1,B00HHE3IO2,"The only reason I purchased this product was because I received an official email from Physique 57 offering the package with free shipping. The DVDs arrived in two days which was a nice surprise but the contents were not as advertised. This package advertises Full Body Workout first and second editions along with upper and lower body target videos but what arrived was the Full Body workout, the 30 Minute Workout and the latter target videos. I contacted Amazon for assistance as instructed when requesting a replacement and the only solution was to return the product and repurchase the package. I was not satisfied with this solution since there was no guarantee the items would be correct the second time around. I contacted Physique's customer service center found through their direct website and they said they have nothing to do with the Amazon sales and couldn't even account for my order. They further stated they had no record of any package deals other than what's offered through their direct site. Frustrated and now hungry for the promotional offer since one class can run around $40 in the boutiques, I purchased the 6 DVD package (only $30 more than the Amazon offer) through their direct site and sent an email off to Physique asking if they can offer me free shipping since this entire situation was confusing and messy; 5 days later (today) I received a call stating they won't extend any offers or discounts and that Amazon is separate from Physique and I'm basically SOL in regards to the discount offer. As I was pleading my case a bit more my cell connection cut out and I was unable to reconnect with Physique since the call came from an unavailable number.

Long story short, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PACKAGE if you expect to receive the contents as advertised. The sale through Amazon will NOT be corrected and you will be paying for an inferior DVD set for the price. Physique's customer service practices are questionable and if you ask me, I'm about ready to cancel my purchase through the direct site, but it JUST showed up at my door, true story! Hopefully I have all the correct DVDs as advertised.",1392076800,,2129,4.754054054054054
