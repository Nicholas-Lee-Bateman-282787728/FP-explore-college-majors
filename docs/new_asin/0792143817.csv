122309,2,0792143817,"The First Wives Club is a good-humored but vaguely sadistic revenge picture billed as a madcap empowerment seminar. But madcap and zany? No way. For years, actresses have been complaining that strong roles for women  are limited--if not absent--in Hollywood. I couldn't agree more, but the  dearth is by no means aided by the dumber than dumb rampage of Brenda,  Elise, and Annie (Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn, and Diane Keaton).
If  white men can't jump, white chicks can't dance, and try as it might to be  hip and topical, The First Wives' Club instead becomes Waiting to Exhale  for white, middle-aged, housefraus. And these three ain't shoopin' no-how.  This movie's big-budget gets major mileage on small inspiration.",947808000,5,720,5.102564102564102

122433,3,0792143817,"A revenge film that offers false hope for middle aged women.  The premise is that women working hard are responsible for the success of their husbands --only to find themselves abandoned in middle age for gold-digging younger models.  Sad, though it is too often true.  The revenge envisioned here may be well deserved, but it's unlikely.  I like the use of the Lesley Gore classic.",1510963200,,382,4.8307692307692305

It has definitely stood the test of time for me, having seen it for the first time at 8 or 9 (not understanding the parts I didn't need to) and re-watching each year after picking up on more of the fun and jokes as time went by.

122548,5,0792143817,I love this movie.  If you like female revenge movies then this is a good one.  Three middle aged women who use to be friends come together after the suicide of another friend only to realize they are all in the same boat.  All their husbands have left them for younger women.  Instead of just getting mad they decide to get even.  In doing so they reform a bond that was lost a long time ago and discover some interesting things about themselves.,1500076800,,447,4.337349397590361

122572,5,0792143817,"I have absolutely adored this movie on so many levels since it came out and was happy to see it again on Prime. These three actresses have great chemistry and put it to good use in this story. Here they are, friends since college, now 40 something, their husbands have all replaced them with 20 somethings... Sound familiar? Anyone??  More to the point, one of our ladies took a dignified morning stroll off her penthouse balcony so this isn't just a bit of silly whining. That's the beginning, when there were four of them. Obviously these well educated, gifted, beautiful, sassy, imaginative, caring, loving...  New York women must do SOMETHING not only for themselves but other women as well. First order, resources; they decide to tactfully enlist the sponsorship of their ex's... after all, they supported and loved these men in their rise to wealth and fame so they approach their mission as any business transaction. From my experience, these transactions appeared  generally like any hostile takeover... Take it all, show no emotion, no mercy and most of all, just have FUN with it!. Boy, did they have fun! But, hey guys, what's that old nugget? Karma's a b**** or payback, something like that. The guys got to continue working in some capacity, fair enough. They needed the money to keep paying their First Wives!

Diane Keaton, Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn nailed their roles, made us laugh, cry, sing and maybe feel a little lighter even twenty years after the making of this film. Through their characters we see once again women standing up, taking back their power, overcoming obstacles and moving forward. It was excellent FUN watching them perform this on such a grand scale comedy. My supportive crazy theatrical friends and I were so inspired when this movie came out, we had a large celebratory divorce party on a yacht and sang ""You Don't Own Me"" then I happily threw my ring overboard! I felt fabulous, dahling!!  Life imitates art!? lol...",1499817600,,1962,4.862275449101796
122573,5,0792143817,"Loved it. Very funny. The husbands cast their wives aside for another woman, and then the wives plotted together and took everything from the husbands including their high class lives. !! Ahhh revenge is sweet.",1499731200,,210,5.0285714285714285

I sat down and watched it like I'd never seen it before.  This movie is still a delight and I loved it from beginning to end.  This is one of those movies that will make you laugh, cry, get angry and be happy.  I loved that the friendship between Bette, Goldie and Dianne re-kindled, even though it was due to a tragic reason.  These three women are so different from each other, but they had a special bond that didn't diminish due to the time that had passed.  I hate that Cynthia didn't reach out to her friends before doing the unthinkable - but it was sweet that she mailed each of them a letter before to prove that they were always on her mind. This definitely got me to thinking about my friendship than span over 40 years - Friends forever!

I especially loved the song and dance at the end of the movie - I watched them sashay all the way down that street.  Awesome movie!",1499040000,,1048,4.174129353233831

The scene where the girls' only escape is via the window washer's rig is absolutely hysterical. It may be true that ""You Don't Know Me"", but watching the girls become better women was worth every moment.",1477699200,5,533,4.34

I rent it periodically, and this time I did because there is a current automotive commercial using the song, ""You Don't Own Me,"" which I've always loved. I couldn't get the words out of my head so I decided to watch the movie. Keaton, Midler, and Hawn have great chemistry. The husband-stealing bimbos are perfectly cast, too. The movie uses humor to make a valid point, and it's wonderful when they realize they need to do something for a cause greater than revenge. My favorite moment? The song at the end where three 40-something women let loose and celebrate their accomplishment. It's a Wine and Relax movie night for me.",1477094400,3,680,4.628099173553719

And in refusing to let go but instead seeking revenge, they were allowing these guys to continue to control them.

I only wish that Stockard Channing who played a pivotal part in this movie had a bigger role.. This was shot during the women's lib movement so was a very appropriate movie for that time. Three strong ex-college roommates joining forces years later to give their overbearing cheating ex- husbands the payback they deserve in a brilliantly conceived plan that made for a hilarious and satisfying outcome.  And having Leslie Gore's ""You Don't Own Me"" included in here as the theme is really special.  Made memories come flowing back of those good happy days.  The days when any person could express themselves without having a label attached to them for their beliefs.  I remember those days with fondness and little bit of sadness.",1473552000,3,834,4.7172413793103445

125462,4,0792143817,"Another sparkling demonstration of the absurdity of any male citizen allowing himself to be snookered into the felonious enslavement divorce racketeering fraud of ""marriage"".  Annie is hardly the only ""wife"" who went into *competition* with her ""husband"" in what had been his business.  Nor is it uncommon for the ""star complex"" to have such as Elise proclaiming that she taught her ""husband"" everything he knew about the movie business.  Nor have lesbian codifiers of such pretenses as the ""innocent spouse"" rules in tax matters such as Morty's from which the ""wife"" massively benefitted intended anything other than abuse of snookered males.  Nor are criminal thugs such as the Uncle, below and beyond the capos of the divorce racketeering courts, any strangers to the homes paid for by enslaved males.  Most amusing of all was the multiply repeated singing of ""You Don't Own Me"" while every wiffey under the criminally corrupt judicial system is supplied with violence and threats of violence to enforce the absolute enslavement of ""husbands"" which the Supreme Court of the state of Missouri has judicially noticed as ""property rights in PERSONS"" in violation of Article XIII of the US Constitution Amendments.",1473379200,,1213,5.231958762886598

125532,4,0792143817,"A mega-production with a long list of famous stars who add variety and depth to the movie. Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler were particularly successful in carrying the weight of this film. The plot got complicated at times, but my interest never waned. Direction, cinematography, music, and choreography all contributed to the movie's effervescence. On top of it all, the movie carries some important feminist messages, which seem completely justified and relevant to the not so uncommon phenomenon of successful middle-aged men ditching their wives of many years to replace them with much younger ones. Very much worth seeing. 4 1/2 stars.",1473120000,4,637,5.254901960784314

Due to their unique circumstances a cast of screwball characters, they not only help each other; they devise a way to help a lot of women through the trauma. It is all done with humor and a great song at the end. Brilliant. Sliding Doors is a unique telling of a relationship and how it would have played out if one thing had changed. If the woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) had caught the train home. How would her life have been different? I love the way it shows that the way she gets there is different but both roads lead to the same man.

126527,5,0792143817,"Three women who were college buddies reunite at a funeral that they all attended. All three women knew the deceased, who was their friend. The deceased woman committed suicide, after going into a deep depression, when her husband left her for another woman. After the funeral, Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn, and Diane Keaton get together and discuss almost all night that they too experienced exactly the same situation that their deceased friend suffered from.

The three ladies decide to create and organize 'The First Wives Club.' A club dedicated to all women, who have suffered the loss of their husbands, who left them for another woman, and many that joined had their own stories of 'the younger woman' crisis. Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn, and Diane Keaton decided to seek revenge on their ex-husbands, big-time.

Diane Keaton is the mellow one, not as brave as Goldie And Bette, but she works with them to get the message across to their cruel, inconsiderate ex-husbands. Goldie Hawn is absolutely hilarious with her reactions, becoming the center of attraction. However, all three women give an outstanding acting performance, and they entertain until the final curtains close. Fun-filled, packed with humor, and enjoyable entertainment. Highly recommended!",1409097600,,1260,5.263681592039801

But things have changed and now this comes off as childish and mean-spirited.

Goldie Hawn looks fabulous in this, maybe the best she's ever looked. And I love her wardrobe, even now. There were clothes in this that I loved!!!

But the petty meanness of these women and their ""stupid"" husbands are portrayed as victims of their ex-wives is annoying and dated.

I don't really care for Diane Keaton's smile...it seems really vindictive or something. She has a sort of sarcastic smirk to her face that doesn't leave an endearing impression on me. I do like Bette Midler though. She has a ""best friend"" vibe that's interesting and easy to connect with.

Both Bette Midler and Sarah Jessica Parker are genuinely funny...I loved their characters and lines.

The husbands are all a bunch of clueless, testosterone-driven duds. I would expect dynamic and interesting women to have more interesting and dynamic husbands. Or at least husbands who could understand what their wives would eventually do to them, were they to divorce them.

The final scene is great, but it shouldn't have taken a bunch of revenge acts to make their dream real. That was the most ridiculous part of all. I understand that the lesson here was that there was some sort of epiphany that made them realize that revenge wasn't the answer, but to paint them as angels with the charity and white clothes was one of those dumbing-down moments that I thought the movie could have done without.",1390262400,3,1525,4.753787878787879

The story starts with 4 women who were great friends in college & lost touch only to be brought back together at the funeral for their friend Cynthia played by Stockyards Channing. Thus starts their journey on what their lives are really like.
One is an actress who is trying to stay young, one who is a business executive, and one who is a housewife. Each one finds out that their husband is having an affair with a younger woman. Through this experience we see the ups & downs of dealing with all the feelings of going through several changes in their lives that brings them back together & realize why their friend committed suicide. To help other women, they decide to establish a place where women can go to for help with legal information, counseling, health issues etc. How to pay for this great idea..you will need to get the movie!

126913,4,0792143817,"I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Most people would skip movies like that because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I love them because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"". Unfortunately, First Wives Club is not a ""clean"" movie. I actually watch it with a ClearPlay filter.

There are some sexual references, such as a girl tells her mother and father she is a lesbian; a man is seen in a dressing gown, his chest is seen; three women go to a gay club; all three ""wives"" husbands left them for a younger woman, whom they are having affairs with.

The only violence shown is a woman steps onto a step preparing to jump off a building, but then they cut the scene away; a woman hits another woman with a form baton for ""therapy""; three women slap each other in turn.

There are quite a few instances of minor curse words used throughout the movie and a woman is seen drinking and smoking at the beginning of the film and one woman drinks throughout the film.

The movie is about four college friends who lost touch with each other, until one of them commits suicide because her husband left her for a younger woman, and so kills herself because of loneliness.  The other three reunite after their friends funeral only to discover their lives aren't much better.  Brenda is divorced, left for a younger woman, depressed, and struggling financially. Elise, whose husband also left her for a younger woman, is now an aging alcoholic movie actress who has become a plastic-surgery addict to keep her career afloat. Annie, meanwhile, is separated, suffering extreme self-esteem issues, and going through therapy with her husband, until she finds out that he wants a divorce and is having an affair with their therapist  With the help of Annie's daughter, Brenda's Uncle Carmine who has Maufia connections, and Elise's money, they form the First Wives Club.  They starts out just wanting revenge, but then decide that it would make them no better than their husbands. So when they find out that Brenda's husband is guilty of income tax fraud, Elise's husband is dating a minor, and Annie's husband's business partners want to sell their shares, and so with the help of Elise, Annie buys them out - they use these situations to push their men into funding their new nonprofit organization dedicated to aiding abused women, in memory of their college friend Cynthia.

Each is dumped by their self-loving husbands for a younger, ego-boosting trophy chick and they decide to get even in the name of a good friend who was driven to suicide by having the same thing happen to her.

Sounds like a recipe for a real, dreary weeper, but how they turn that idea on its head!

As a fan of the Three Stooges, this is the modern version, and it doesn't get much better than the window washing platform dropping to certain death while the three ladies scream in terror. The chemistry between Goldie, Bette Midler, and Diane Keaton is so good you wonder why some producer didn't find a way to turn this film into a franchise so we could see more of them together. They fight, they commiserate, they gossip, and they love each other as old friends do who have been through a lot.

The script is extraordinarily good with catty barbs galore (""who'dja have over, Guns and Roses?""), and the secondary characters are all outstanding -- Sarah Jessica Parker, Victor Garber, Rob Reiner, Dan Hedeya, and even the dowager duchess of Granville Maggie Smith!  The astounding Stockard Channing opens the film and is so poignant she can make you cry, which is a good way to accentuate all the fun that comes later.

This is a movie, not a reality show. 2. Not only is it a movie, it's a comedy. 3. Also, it's a chick flick. I'm sure there are other chick flicks that bash men. I'm not saying that's right, but let's not get started on how many movies disgrace women. I never read the book, but I'm pretty sure there was a bit more detail in the book about how scumbag-ish the husbands were. Of course a woman in her right mind would not seek revenge to the extent these women did if ""their husbands just left them for another woman."" The guys were...scumbags.

Come on people. It's a movie...do you take Dumb and Dumber serious?

This was a good clean movie. No explicit language, no nudity, and no sexual content. It was just cute. If you're looking for a movie to straighten your moral compass, this one isn't for you. If you're just looking for good, clean, good humored entertainment, this is a good choice. Plus, this is where Jennifer Lawrence got her Golden Globe quote, ""It says, I beat Meryl!""

127263,5,0792143817,"Oh my god. I have had nightmares for two days after watching this movie. If you like bizarre indie horror flicks this movie may be for you.

This movie also led me to a couple epiphanies about the universe.

For one the surreal writing. This movie could only have been written by an androgynous alien organism that learned about humankind from weekday soaps and talk shows. Note for alien anthropologists, real humans do not act like this.  Thus, the movie is confirmation of sentient extra-terrestrial life - a major revelation for a skeptic like me!

While the writing could well cause nightmares, for me it was the alleged dancing and singing by these actresses.

Now I never thought much about the 'white people can't dance' phenomenon, but this movie both provided great evidence of that and elucidated a principle of pop psychology that I had long considered only in passing.

The alleged dancing in this movie was vanilla extract. If you took all the bad things about bad dancing and distilled their vile essence, you would have the directions for recreating the scenes where they are singing and dancing or whatever the frack they were supposed to be doing.

The pop culture realization I had was that the three friends were pretty much laughing during these orgies of ritual dancing evil - 'laughter is the best medicine' as they say.

Somehow, in the plot, the likely drug-induced vomit of movement and sound was healing to these three. Ahh! So the disease, lack of dancing genes, is ameliorated by laughter. For such a condition, in this rare case hopefully terminal, that laughter to have made them less than suicidal is clearly powerful medicine.

127307,5,0792143817,"Long before the Spice Girls were chanting ""Girl Power"", this was the film about women power.

The movie versions and the initial videos in my country was rated PG. And then, ratings were revised and First Wives Club was rated 18 years.

The film opens with Dionne Warwick's Wives And Lovers - a lovely 60s ditty.

Three women dumped by their hubbies for younger women gang up together to teach their straying men a lesson.

I absolutely love Goldie Hawn. She is so funny! An actress in her 40s, she goes for botox and ends up with lips bigger than Mick Jagger and Tina Turner put together. To quote Maggie Smith's character:""those lips!"" Her run ins with Hollywood's young crowd leaves her the option of playing mother to her younger love rival in a comeback vehicle.

Bette Midler is perfect as the caustic housewife who loses her husband to a shallow materialistic girl (Sarah Jessica Parker is brilliant!) interested only in the lifestyles of the rich and glamorous.

Diane Keaton is a timid and way too nice woman who is seeing a shrink who in turn is seeing her hubby. Watch her explode when she finds out.

There are a lot of art, interior decorating, glamour and lifestyles of the rich and famous elements.

Lesbians will love this as there is a very hilarious lesbian bar scene. Hence the 18 years and above rating in my territory.

 A bitchy witty comedy about love, revenge and being assertive! Watch the three women sail out the door singing:""You Don't Own Me"" One of my all time favourites!",1341878400,,1502,4.633962264150943

However, the most distracting aspect of the movie?  Diane Keaton's costume.  Why was she dressed as a gestapo agent, even down to the eyeglasses.  This is the worst costuming I have ever seen.  Who doubted that Keaton couldn't carry off this role without this bizarre uniform?  And, even her hair is in keeping with this ridiculous appearance.  I'd give anything to get an explanation for this travesty from the costumer or whoever is responsible for this travesty.  (Her character absolutely did not require such outfitting).  It makes it very difficult to enjoy Keaton's acting.

It hadn't sunk in that the center the women found has nothing whatsoever to do with wealthy, despairing women like the friend they lost.  It is clearly meant to serve the poor.  Huh.",1307404800,2,929,4.878205128205129
127342,5,0792143817,"Director Hugh Wilson's colorful and stylish 1996 comedy, based on a raunchier novel by the late Olivia Goldsmith(who cameos as a mourner at a funeral), greets us with Roy Liechtenstein-like art by Charles Beal, portraying women frequently engaged in various activities as Dionne Warwick sings her rendering of the '60s classic, ""Wives and Lovers"".
 Soon, the graphics fade, and Diane Keaton's repressed, guilt-ridden housewife, Annie Paradis, begins her narration with memories of her 1969 graduation from Middlebury College with her three best friends, who, via the brilliant casting of Ilene Starger, are played by actresses who bear incredibly strong resemblances to their middle-aged counterparts.
 The young graduates, including Annie(Adria Tenor), Brenda Murelli(Michele Brilliant), Elise Elliot(Dina Spybey) are gifted with sets of pearls by Valedictorian Cynthia Swann(Julihera DeStefano). Looking forward to bright futures, they toast the moment with champagne in paper cups as they pose for a snapshot of themselves. Indeed, the morning of life shines brilliantly for these four musketeers!
 But Life's midday(fast-forwarding to the '90s), is doleful. A now more mature Cynthia(Stockard Channing), is carrying another drink in hand, and giving her pearls to her maid, Theresa(Aida Linares) before making a fateful decision in response to her ex-husband's (James Naughton) jilting her for another woman(Heather Locklear).
 We find Annie being chided by her grown daughter, Chris(Jennifer Dundas), for being  a ""doormat"" to her estranged husband,Aaron(Stephen Collins), but lauded by her posessive mother, Catherine(Eileen Heckart) for the apparent reconciliation.
 Brenda(Bette Midler, snide, wisecracking, and playing for laughs as always)is busy coaxing her son Jason(Ari Greenberg) to study his Hebrew for his upcoming Bar Mitzphah, the only thing her estranged husband Morty(Dan Hedaya), who left her for a young woman who worked at his electronics store named Shelly Stewart(a churlish and manipulative Sarah Jessica Parker), is willing to pay for.
 We find the pampered, overindulgent actress, Elise(Goldie Hawn) in the chair of plastic surgeon Morris Packman(Rob Reiner) demanding yet another procedure despite
his claim that she has had too many.
 All three, who failed to keep in touch after graduation, as they had promised, share a jarring experience at the news of Cynthia's suicide. Reuniting at her funeral, they subsequently dine at at restaurant at Elise's invitation, and the presence of the empty chair at the table for four is palpable.
 Annie is the only one who cannot  publicly come to terms with the failure of her marriage, and will need to dismiss the psychobabble imposed on her by her therapist, Dr. Leslie Rosen (Marcia Gay Harden in the familar role of the femme fatale), whom both she and Aaron are seeing, but not quite for the same reasons, and accept the reality of her situation instead of trying to cling to an unrealistically postive view of things. Soon the reality will be jarringly and unavoidably harsh.
 In the company of Duarto Feliz(Bronson Pinchot), the interior decorator for whom she works, Brenda has an unpleasant run-in with Morty and Shelly at a women's clothing store, and Elyse learns her divorce settlement will include her having to pay her ex-husband Bill(Victor Garber)alimony, although she was the one who taught him the business, and he is in actuality, indebted to her. She also learns that her attempt to look younger has not paid off when Director Brett Artounian(Timothy Olyphant) hires her for the part of the older lead in his film when she'd hoped for the part of the younger woman, a role which will go to Bill's bimbo lover, Phoebe LaVelle(Elizabeth Berkley) who ultimately could be Bill's ruin.
 The recipience of the three suicide notes from Cynthia spurs Annie into action. The three women meet, and discuss how best to deal with their situation in what becomes the first meeting of the First Wives Club.
 Forging alliances with Elyse's friend, Gunilla Garson Goldberg(the incomparable Maggie Smith), the highly influential Queen of New York Society, and gaining support from Duarto, Chris, and Brenda's Sicillian Uncle Carmine(Phillip Bosco), the last of whom will be the muscle behind their operation,they carry out an agenda which will not only result in justice on behalf of themselves, but, amid some trepidation and strife,will eventually benefit society at large as well.
 Along for the ride are Kate Burton, Walter Bobbie, Debra Monk, and Jennifer Lam in cameo roles, as are Ed Koch, Gloria Steinem,Kathie Lee Gifford, and Ivana Trump, who utters the film's most famous line, ""Don't get mad. Get everything!""
 This is a cleverly crafted production that reveals the strength and renewal of forgotten abilities by the unity of three  friends in the midst of a crisis, who ultmately channel their powers towards the greater good. Three women reunited dressed in mourning will celebrate a victory clad in various shades of off-white, each sporting their precious pearls as a way to figuratively keep Cynthia near.
  The formerly timid Annie recounts her fear at having to sing for Cynthia on her 21st birthday, along with Brenda and Elyse. But ultimately these women sing not only for the fallen Cynthia, but also for themselves and for their triumph over adversity that their unity has created.",1307318400,,5378,5.336879432624113

If I could give this waste of acetate and expensive chemicals zero stars, or better yet, negative stars, I would have done.

The script is weak, but, possibly, just possibly, in competent hands, with significant portions re-written, played deadpan, perhaps with understated English irony, there might have been something to salvage.  Not here.

Good comedy relies on timing and delivery.  Those elements are entirely absent here.  No pace.  No timing. No chemistry. No nothing.

Instead we get leaden, over-the-top, exaggerated-as-if-it-was-a-silent-picture ham acting.  This wouldn't even have been good as Vaudeville.  Artless.

In many of the scenes, I cannot imagine what the director was thinking.  The direction is either weak, or over-indulgent, or non-existent.  Was the director even on the set during filming?

Bette Midler is most evidently not an actress.
This was a casting error. A bad casting error.
An even worse error than a weak script and poor direction.

Goldie Hawn is a good comedienne, but her talents are completely wasted here.

Diane Keaton is a capable actress.  Here she has been asked to re-play Annie Hall except without a competent script, without competent direction, and without other capable actors with whom to interact.  It falls flat.  It's awkward.  It's embarrassing. You feel bad for her.  You wonder why God decided to punish her in this way.

Did Hawn and Keaton read the script before signing on?
What possessed them?
Were they short of cash, and needing a paycheck?
Did they subsequently fire their agents?

The actress who plays Diane Keaton's mother does a creditable job in the midst of this train wreck.

Sounds like a great `I Am Woman' sicko-revenge trip, right? It actually is, for the most part - it's just that the film (based on Olivia Goldsmith's novel) becomes a bit excessive with its over-dramatization, far-fetched kookiness and stereotypical hoopla. The whole thing turns into a `How can we outwit these miserable men and take all their money and be really clever and coy about it the whole while' kind of story. After years of helping their husbands build hugely successful businesses, the three women are callously dumped for younger, sexier ""trophy wives."" What I don't understand is why these smart, business-minded, middle-aged women bothered with their husbands in the first place, or why they expel all this narcissistic energy in dealing with them! (For Christ's sake ladies, let this film be an example, learn early that all men are good for nothing!) Oddly enough, Diane Keaton's on-screen daughter is the happiest person in the film, not to mention the least dysfunctional, and she's a lesbian!  The whole movie comes off like a cross between 9 To 5 and The War Of the Roses, though nowhere near as sick and deranged as the latter - The First Wives Club points out everything in light-hearted raillery. Bette Midler is excellent as Brenda, the wife of an electronics-emporium magnate, and Goldie Hawn, as good as always, plays Elise Elliot, an aging movie-star who can't get any roles -- an important issue in Hollywood right now (key word being `Hollywood'). Being a member of Joe Blow's Average America, its hard to feel really sympathetic for the character (or the real issue). So an actress can't pull down that typical 3 or 4 million any more -deal with it, get a job at Pizza Hut, or shut the hell up! Diane Keaton, on the other hand, seems a little out of place in such a `free and easy' production, though her performance is plenty good, as is Sarah Jessica Parker's as Shelly. There are also some delightful little cameos from Heather Lockear; Jon Stewart, Ivana Trump, Kathie Lee Gifford, James Naughton, Rob Reiner and Elizabeth Berkley.",1220486400,,2287,4.94025974025974

127462,4,0792143817,"I watched this movie as a favorite for a long while and then decided to read the book- and I realized after a few chapters how different the book is to the movie. And yet that is a good thing- since the book version is to me so very isolating and dull, while the movie is heart- warming friendship- comedy type of story which makes it a lot better. So yes- if you are planning to read the book- don't expect it to be at all like the movie, and I don't recommend the book at all.

I do recommend this movie though highly. It is as I said a comedy at a best, with an actual strong cast to carry it off well. It is a true chick- flick, and I knew many men would get upset at it just because of the fact the men in the story didn't get their cake and eat it too. Well too bad. The whole point of the story was that the women helped their husbands get to their lofty positions and then when they got there they dropped the wives after all their love and support for younger trophy wives, and so the first wives got back what they themselves had actually worked for and not the men. If the men want it back they can actually work for it this time on their own. That was the whole point and I felt it was good justice. And no, I don't hate men- but I feel men who do the acts these men did to their first wives had the ""What goes around comes around"" saying coming to them, and it did. Good ole Karma.

This movie actually was very well- done, with some funny moments and a good amount of realistic drama. Very enjoyable film, especially Goldie whom played her role I felt wonderfully. It's one of my faves on my film shelf.",1146441600,4,1617,4.003095975232198

127466,5,0792143817,"This is the next generation of chick flick.  This is the chick flick for middle aged woman. Starting in the 60's, men and women got married and the woman supported men while he got his college degree or helped him build his business.  Then, once successful, they left their wives for younger women.

This is the basis for this film.  Cynthia (Stockard Channing), Annie (Diane Keaton), Elise (Goldie Hawn) and Brenda (Bette Middler) are all sorority sisters.  Over the years they have lost touch with each other.  All married and made their husbands wealthy.  When Cynthia's husband leaves her, she commits suicide.  The other three reunite after Cynthia's funeral.  Each claiming that their shaky marriage is solid.

Eventually, each husband trades in for the younger model.  Annie, Elise and Brenda are determined not have a similar fate as Cynthia.  Each has their own issues but one by one they pick off the ex's.  The best are Elise taking all of the marital assets and selling them for $1 and the next involves society matron Gunulla (Maggie Smith) taking Brenda's ex's bimbo (Jessica Sarah Parker) under her wing.

This is a hilarious fantasy that any person that has been dumped will love.  Some of the scenes are silly but overall it hits true.

Bette of course steals the show but Maggie Smith could have stolen the show if her part was bigger.

127497,4,0792143817,"This was a chick flick in many respects, but not so sappy and irrational that it annoys you like other chick flicks do.  All three leads are legitimately angry and the audience feels for them, because we've all been scorned (whether you're a man or a woman, but it will obviously speak to you moreso if you are a woman).  I wouldn't give this 4 stars because the song and dance routines were lame and kind of annoying.

Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler are three old friends who are reunited over the death of a college friend.  She committed suicide off her penthouse suite after her husband left her for another woman.  The three receive letters from her sent just before she jumped expressing her grief.  She wished she had all that they did, and that they were still good friends.  The three get back together after her funeral and discover that while the years have affected them differently they have all experienced the same woes when their husbands, who they were there to support in their early, lean years, achieved success, and all left them for younger women.

Diane Keaton, perhaps the weakest of them all, endures her mother's bullying and her daughter's coming out on top of her divorce, plus being used by her estranged husband while he is also seeing her therapist who she had been paying to help her sort out her problems.  {Ewww)  Goldie Hawn is an actress who, in an industry which glorifies youth and beauty unlike any other, had her husband leave her for a younger woman even though she has pulled her face taught and self medicating with alcohol rather than popping pain pills.  Bette Middler, the funniest of them all and always the star of every show, had her husband leave her for Shelly, a shark of a younger woman who was working in her husband's furniture store.  Being traded in for a newer model, the three decide to form a union to not just help themselves but other women in similar situation.

The plot unfolds in a series of screwball comedy antics, revelation, tears, and ultimately personal triumph for all, but it also tells us something else that we don't like talking about much.  Women have a fear of being overthrown based on their age, of getting dried up and loosing their attractiveness.  Then, when their husbands / boyfriends get tired of them they will be inevitably traded in for younger women.  Why?  There is no one answer to this.  Greed, a realization of one's own mortality, the proverbial ""midlife crisis"" situation, physical attractiveness or unattractiveness all play a role.  There is no real answer.  But, women have to stop harping on those things.  Society doesn't smile upon it, but women should start dating younger men too.  I have, and it's been very rewarding.  If you don't have a boyfriend/husband, well get over it and be happy with yourself.  You don't need a man to make yourself complete, you're a queen and deserve to be one.  And younger women, don't buy into this thing of dating older men because you find ones your own age jeuvenile or awkward.  Older men are just as jeuvenile and awkward to be going for someone young enough to be their daughter.

The best revelation I found in this movie was Bette Midler's husband's realization about his trophy wife.  While she is obviously a tornado in the sack, she summed it up best when she said she was not Brenda (his ex wife).  He simply said ""No, you're not"".  He realized he had made a mistake, and that he was thinking with something other than his brain.  I guess guys are just like that, they have to learn the hard way that they don't want some bubbleheaded, self centered princess.  They want to feel superior, but they want to be challenged as well.  Give them just enough of a challenge, and if they dump you make them feel guilty that they screwed up and let a wonderful woman like you slip through their fingers.",1132185600,10,3856,4.615271659324523

What a funny, poignant movie about friends drifting apart, relationships that go bad and the importance of building something together with those who you truly love.  As Cynthia Swan (one of four friends who commits suicide when left by her husband for a younger woman -- a great performance by Stockard Channing) says, ""perhaps the problem is lonliness"" in her notes to her three best college friends (played by Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton and Bette Midler).  A real delight, with a great sound track, esepcially the closing rendition of Lesley Gore's ""You Don't Own Me"" by Hawn, Midler and Keaton.  I especially like that the three women (after exacting justice on their own philandering husbands) have formed a strong bond, and that the film ends with them together, singing and dancing up a storm!",1129334400,3,892,4.848684210526316
127501,1,0792143817,"The distinctive thing about this movie for me is that it is superficially adequate, but a very, very bad movie upon closer examination.  For example, It must be a comedy since it can not fall into any other genre, but it is not funny.  Somehow, this is not immediately obvious until afterwards when you reflect back upon what you have seen.  I can not really explain this characteristic of the movie.

To continue, the movie is about the revenge of three women against their ex-husbands who have left them for younger women.  In the process, the children are used against the fathers.  Blackmail is utilized.  I don't have a problem with this.  Funny movies have been made about canibalism.  Funny movies have been made about divorce.  However, if you are going to make such a movie, it has to go over the top.  This movie handles everything like a sitcom.  To make matters worse, it seems to realize at the end that it has gone too far and become politically incorrect.  At root, the movie is making a statement that all men all scum.  Once it gets to the end, it proceeds to spend an interminable amount of time in trying ot redeem itself by having the three women open a crisis center for women.  This entire period is very, very, very long without any laughs.  I mean without any jokes.

Other random observations:  Not since the theatrical release of ""Bladerunner"" has a narration been so unnecessary.  One of the children is made into a lesbian so that the three women can go to a lesbian bar, and the sequence is not funny.  The before mentioned lesbian hates her father and surprises him with an announcement that she is a lesbian.  Perhaps some film maker somewhere could make this work as a punchline, but it doesn't work here.  Goldie Hawn's character actually wears makeup to make herself grosteque.  This is funny?  Oh yea, her character is an alcoholic who has an instantanteous recovery.  Bette Midler is actually quite good in this movie as an actress, but not as a comedience.  Lets see.  You have a movie about wives getting back at their husbands, and Bette Midler plays it almost straight.  I think she could have perhaps chewed some scenery.  This is the problem with the movie.  It does not know what it wants to be.",1127606400,15,2238,4.592405063291139

Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton & Bette Midler work wonderfully together in this movie, and they each play their characters to the hilt!!!

The gist of the movie is that these women were all great friends during their teen years but had lost touch through the years.  The suicide death of one of their ""group"" brought them all together once again.  While catching up, they realized that they were all going through similar situations in their marriages - they were all being cheated on by their husbands!

Once they figure this out, they decide to put their heads together to come up with inventive ways to get back at their husbands for doing this to them - and I must say they do an excellent job at it!!!

Three college friends are reunited by the death of another college friend. Though they were incredibly close in school, their lives drifted apart afterwards.

After all these years, there is only one thing that they have in common. All three have been dumped by their husbands in favor of younger women. They're not going to take it laying down and decide to recoup their losses, wreack havoc and have some fun doing it.

This is a very entertaining film. The characterizations are strong almost to the point of being charactures but there is some depth to it as well. These women are dealing with real pain. In accordance with the old maxim that shared pain is lessened, they share first with each other and then with their ex-husbands. I almost feel sorry for the cretins near the end but not quite.

127538,3,0792143817,"For a movie with a pretty big idea--that women whose husbands leave them for younger women can regain their dignity, control, and even, in some cases, their husbands--this is a pretty trifling affair. It's embarrassing to listen to Diane Keaton reduce all her acting talent to a 90-minute stream of shrill screams and whines and whimpers. Goldie Hawn's character undergoes plastic surgery, but that's not enough to explain the way she contorts her face throughout the film. And when Bette Midler and the other two get together to burst into song, watch out. You'll probably wince.
Still, this is a funny movie, with a decent heart, a pat but semi-satisfying ending, and a really great cast: Stockard Channing, Sarah Jessica Parker, Elizabeth Berkeley, Dan Hedaya, Balki from Perfect Strangers, the dad from Seventh Heaven, and Maggie Smith all make appearances.

127540,4,0792143817,"In 1996, Hugh Wilson directed a very funny comedy about three friends that were all dumped by their husbands for younger women in the film ""First Wives Club"".  Based upon the 1992 novel of the same name by Olivia Goldsmith (1949-2004), the three friends (who had met in college) are brought back together after their fourth friend, Cynthia Swann Griffin (Stockard Channing), jumped from her penthouse apartment in Manhattan after her husband left and she felt totally alone.  Upon learning about each others similar marital problems, the surviving friends, which include the boisterous Brenda Cushman (Bette Midler), the movie actress Elise Elliot (Goldie Hawn) and the timid Annie Paradis (Diane Keaton), decide to work together to attain vengence upon their ex-husbands.  Brenda's ex-husband, Morton 'Morty' Cushman (Dan Hedaya), wants to marry the very young and shallow Shelly Stewart (Sarah Jessica Parker).  Elise's ex-husband, Bill Atchison (Victor Garber), is dating the very young aspiring actress Phoebe LaVelle (Elizabeth Berkley).  Annie's separated husband, Aaron Paradis (Stephen Collins), is having an affair with Annie's therapist, Dr. Leslie Rosen (Marcia Gay Harden).  To assist them, the trio of first wives enlist help from their friends, which include the interior decorator Duarto Feliz (Bronson Pinchot), Annie's daughter Chris Paradis (Jennifer Dundas), the socialite Gunilla Garson Goldberg (Maggie Smith) and Brenda's Uncle Carmine (Philip Bosco).
Though the plot was somewhat weak and the acting and screen writing were not Oscar-worthy, ""First Wives Club"" is still very entertaining and engaging.  The most memorable acting comes from Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, Diane Keaton, Sarah Jessica Parker and Victor Garber.  The film did receive an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score.  Memorable scenes in the film include Cynthia on her balcony, her funeral, the trio at the restaurant, Elise visiting Bill's office, Annie's visits with Dr. Leslie Rosen, Morty's commercial, Shelly with Gunilla, Morty's apartment, the auction, the fight, Annie's purchase, Chris' announcement and the closing scenes.  Other memorable characters include Annie's mother Catherine MacDuggan (Eileen Heckart, 1919-2001), Dr. Morris Packman (Rob Reiner) and Brenda's son Jason (Ari Greenberg), as well as cameos by Ivana Trump, Kathie Lee Gifford, Gloria Steinem and former NYC mayor Edward I. Koch.  Olivia Goldsmith also made an unaccredited cameo.  Overall, I rate ""First Wives Club"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  It's a fun film that both women and men can enjoy, though women may enjoy it more since the men in the film are the bad guys.",1076889600,45,2642,5.493827160493828

Along the way, the three friends learn just how strong and valuable they really are as people, whether or not they have a man by their side.

I never thought I'd see such a selfish Stephen Collins, but he was great in this.
The story was great as well.  When one of the four friends dies, it reunites these college friends.  They all reveal to one another that their husbands have left them for younger women.  So what do they do?  Revenge, of course!  I thought the middle of the movie was very good.  There was definitely a climax and it was resolved very well.  Another thing I loved was the song that was played while Annie (Keaton), Brenda (Bette), and Elise (Hawn) were giving their husbands what they deserved.  Now if only I could remember the name of the song!  But what it did was it showed that women are just as strong as men, sometimes stronger.  I think that is one of the messages that the movie tries to convey to us.

127578,4,0792143817,"I enjoyed the ""First Wives Club""!

After graduation, each busy with her own life, time races by and the four lose track of each other.

Getting reacquainted they learn that each of them has been tossed aside and replaced by younger woman in their men's lives, after many years of marriage. Brenda is separated from her husband but hopes to reconcile, Annie and her husband are in therapy and also separated, and Elise, an actress who worries she is past her prime, is faced with splitting everything and making alimony payments to her soon to be ex-husband.  During a pity party, they realize it would be much better to spend their energy in getting even than to staying angry, feeling sorry for themselves, or following Cynthia's lead.  To accomplish their goal a strategy tailored to each man is set in motion.  I especially enjoyed the scene where Elise delivers the proceeds from the sale of their assets to her husband!

Overall a great movie, one of my favorites.",1045008000,4,1166,4.692682926829268

Even to this day, I still remember how mean-spirited this movie was. I don't care how you look at it, it's really just mindless cruelty to 3 guys who had nothing to do with the death of the friend of their 3 ex-wives. What they did to those innocent guys financially was in my opinion totally mean and uncalled for.
I thought that maybe the movie would be funny and turn out good at the very end. However, other than that guy Morty getting back together with his ex-wive, it was no better for the other 2 guys. I honestly did not enjoy this movie one bit. In fact, this movie enraged me and ended up hating women in general for a few hours to a few days after the movie was over.
Selling Bill's yellow Lamborghini at that auction and then having it bought back by his own money was indeed terrible! That's a car more valuable than a Ferrari!
This movie utterly disgusted me all the way. Other than those mean roles Diana, Goldie, and Bettie played, I've always liked those actresses.
Have a nice day,
Steven",1033516800,17,1112,4.225352112676056
127581,5,0792143817,"Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn and Diane Keaton star as three 40 something wives of husbands who in their prime and who now want some younger babes. These three women in return seek their own revenge against their husbands. Bette once again steals the show with her outgoing and zany personality. She also places herself as the leader of the group. Goldie Hawn does well as the old actress who is a drunk and who gives many comedic moments. Diane Keaton shows the most talent as she holds the film together the most among the three of them. The supporting cast which includes great performances from Eileen Heckart, Stephen Collins,Sarah Jessica Parker and others do a good job. This film made over $100 million at the box office which stamped a seal of success to the three women who were all 50 years old when the movie was released. It is a great female action/drama movie from the three and from Bette who is used to starring in pairs wiht women her age as in OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE, BIG BUSINESS and HOCUS POCUS. See this movie!!",1029801600,2,1025,4.576086956521739

A clever, funny, cruel, and intriguing movie which will keep you glued to the seat better than any ""Rambo"" movie could. Getting tricked by a date to sit through this wasn't pleasant, but be assured, I had the time of my life. Rent it, buy it, watch it over and over. No disappointments.

127583,5,0792143817,"Terrific!! Amazing!!!!  This film is one of best that I saw. I love Bette Midler. I adore Goodie Haw. And I've never seen any movie with Miss Diane Keaton. I was impressed when I saw these 3 girls together. I love the part when the 3 girls are in Morty's apartment. Funny! funny! I laugh everytime when Shelly ( Sarah Jessica) and Morty are coming back to apartment and MIdler,Haw and Keaton don't know how to get out there. While Brenda (Midler) is saying to Duarto Feliz to ""improvise"", Keaton is saying "" I'm clean! I'm clean! "" ( totally mad ). Shaking her body like an insane woman. Funny!
The whole film is very funny. Right movie to right actresses.
Excellent movie!!! It's in my Video Library. It's a classical!!",1003017600,,720,4.4961832061068705

If you wind up in my situation, you can get a ray of sunshine from those gals in this movie.  If you are a man, well laugh anyway.  The club would allow in any spouse who has been dumped!

127616,1,0792143817,"First of all, allow me to say one thing:  I am sick of people only writing reviews of the movies they really love.  It is possible to write BAD reviews as well folks....in fact, it's much more fun than writing good ones.  Think of some movies you really hate, then go and rip into them with a scathing review.  It's therapeutic!
Now on to this wretched movie.  I'll say right off the bat that I was biased against this movie before I even saw it, for several reasons:  I don't like Bette Midler, Diane Keaton, or Goldie Hawn - the three of them together have about as much talent as an arthritic flea.  Also, I don't like this genre - the sort of movies where womankind is portrayed as being the most powerful force on Earth, and nothing, least of all a scurvy, double-dealing MAN, can stop it.  And ladies wonder where the term ""feminazi"" came from - movies like this! BUT - even putting aside all my ill feelings, I STILL dind't like this movie, just because it has what is literally one of the worst casts ever assembled for a big-budget Hollywood picture, and so therefore the acting is horrid; the writing is devilishly bad, and the direction is third-rate.  Finally, and most importantly - the movie never made me believe that the husbands did anything so nasty that they deserved to be subjected to the dispicable acts of revenge perpetrated upon them by their ex-wives.  So they cheated on their wives - big deal!  It happens every day all over the world, and anyone who can't accept it to the degree that they feel the need to resort to sickening acts of vengeance needs to be institutionalized.  What the wives do to the husbands is far, far, far worse than what the husbands do to the wives - thus, you lose any sympathy the movie wants you to feel for the heroines and you end up leaving depressed by the fact that these hapless dames just ran a royal screw-job over these poor saps and they are gonna get away scott-free.  This isn't a ""feel good"" movie at all - it is a saddening indictment of the calamities that result when ""girl power"" is taken to the ultimate extremes.  Shame on the cast, shame on the crew, and shame on any and all who enjoyed this dreck called ""The First Wives Club"".",989280000,20,2205,4.412345679012346

Other reviews rate it negatively unfairly. The situation in this  movie plays itself out in America every day, the film becomes less about  getting ""revenge"" and more about sisterhood, and charity, and  bonding together. Midler Keaton and Hawn are three of the BEST and most  TALENTED actresses we have in America today. All give stellar performances.  Sarah Jessica Parker is also so fun to watch as one of the 2nd wives. The  film is hilarious and enjoyable and I would highly recommend it.",952646400,2,645,4.7657657657657655
