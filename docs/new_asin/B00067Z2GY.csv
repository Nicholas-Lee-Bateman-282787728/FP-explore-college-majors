HAUNTED FROM WITHIN is an indie/grassroots, micro-budgeted horror film, starring no-name actors. Story is set in Riverside City, Arizona. Don't know if there really is such a place, but it looks authentic.

Production values are rough. Much flat lighting, lacking artistry or nuance. But also some nice CGI and animation effects of the supernatural, astral projection, and/or dreams. These CGI sequences appear to have been done on a home computer, but they have a nice ethereal quality to them. Not up to Hollywood standards, but still admirable.

The acting ranges from decent to pretty bad. But the ""actresses"" are pretty, even if their acting isn't top notch. The husbands and male love interests look at least 20 years older than the ladies, so you can tell the casting was done by men. Hey, I'm not complaining.

Story concerns ""La Llorona,"" the ghost of a Mexican mother who killed her children. Now she goes about killing other mothers' children.

While the acting and production values are rough, the script and editing are particularly sloppy, especially in its arrangement of time. Consider...

1. Carmelita and Dr. Stern discuss Olivia murdering her kids. They are strangers to Olivia, so they apparently saw it in the news. But only LATER does Anna, Olivia's best friend, learn that Olivia murdered her kids. Anna says that she and Oliver ""go over to each others' houses all the time,"" yet Anna didn't know anything about Olivia murdering her kids -- while it's been all over the news so that even strangers know? Obviously, the scene with Anna learning about Olivia should have come BEFORE Carmelita and Dr. Stern discussing it.

2. Matthew wants his wife Anna to get pregnant, because it'll help with his political campaign. He says that she looks sexy pregnant. Apparently, a sexy pregnant wife gets votes. But in another scene he says the election is ""next Tuesday."" Less than a week away? Is that enough time to get his wife noticeably pregnant? Or even pregnant at all? (It's clear that all events in the film occur over a few days, so it's not like there was a big time lapse between the two scenes.)

3. Anna kills Roper late at night, in the privacy of his home -- yet seemingly hours later (at most) it's on the TV news (at 2 or 3 a.m.?), with a full background report that Roper was discovered to be a serial killer responsible for many deaths. Wow, that's fast police work! And speedy journalism! (BTW, Roper's murders -- which we never see -- have nothing to do with the film's story.)

4. At the end of the film, Detective Harrington reviews a VHS tape of her interrogation of Olivia, who killed herself DAYS ago. The interview might have occurred days before that. So it's been a while since the interrogation. Harrington is surprised to see a shadow/ghost move across the image on the tape. I'm surprised the detective didn't review the tape earlier, but instead waited so long to review the tape -- indeed, waited until after the case is closed.

This is a sloppy production, but I enjoyed it. However, you must have a high tolerance for amateurish, micro-budgeted horror films. I guess that includes me. A bit of blood & gore, a supernatural tale with a modicum of originality (not many La Llorona films out there, just a few), a bit of effort (nice, ethereal CGI effects), a city I haven't seen yet, and pretty actresses.

8040135,4,B00067Z2GY,"Hate Hollywood?  Try this nearly home made thriller, based on the legend of La Llorona.  Director Jose L. Cruz shot this film in Riverside City, AZ, a small mining town near Kearny.  ""Professional"" film critics gave it an average of 2 1/2 stars, which means in my book, it's very non-Hollywood-special-effects crap.  The story line and acting make it a great film; one that will keep your attention, and grant you a couple of chills.",1337731200,,433,4.733333333333333
8040136,1,B00067Z2GY,"The movie tells of the legend of La Llorana, a woman who drowned her children to be with her lover. He rejected her for what she did, then she committed suicide and wanders the earth, or wherever there are Mexicans, drowning children. Dr. David Stern (David Patrick Green) is an investigator and first person narrator for this tale. As a child his family was killed in an accident and only he survived. He has psychic abilities and can solve crimes. His goal now is to prevent crimes. He is fascinated by women who murder their children. He is convinced this can only be caused by possession and is proof of a higher power. Olivia's (Tamra Marez) children were drowned in her tub. She confesses to the deed, but can't remember doing it. It isn't long before these 2 subplots come together.

The plot was horribly written. Dialogue was tedious with many pauses. Acting was non-existing. Occasion subtitles. Kurt Sinclair in his underwear.

8040138,3,B00067Z2GY,"I admit it. I'm a sucker for cover art featuring pretty girls, so I was immediately attracted to the DVD: 'Haunted From Within.' I read the header, ""Based on the legend of La Llorona."" Always fascinated by anything dealing with mythology, folklore and urban legend, I thought incorporating the La Llorona legend of Mexico into the plot of a horror film sounded like a great idea. I was pretty much hooked at that point.

As for the movie:  What we have here is a case of an excellent original concept burdened with a low budget and incredibly mediocre performances. The sets are dark and drab, the acting stiff and uninspired. There appears to be no chemistry between the cast members, it's like a bad rehearsal where the only concern is delivering your lines correctly.

On the positive side:  The lovely Rina Fernandez does an admirable job in the lead role as the tragic and haunted Anna. The movies best moments are when Anna is alone on camera drifting back and forth between the material world and the spiritual domain of La Llorona. This is where the story becomes authentic and disturbing. The image of the grieving La Llorona is well done and leaves a lasting impression.

Definitely not a classic, but because of the films connection with an ongoing urban legend and the presence of Rina Fernandez it has the potential of attaining some level of cult status.

8040139,5,B00067Z2GY,"This movie is right up there with flicks like The Shining and The Exorcist.  It's brillant the way it combines an old folklore and puts a modern twist to it. I also liked that this movie had a ""who done it"" feel to it with a surprising ending, just like The Sixth Sense. But I won't dare watch this movie alone or in the dark.",1106352000,,326,4.015384615384615
