3639996,1,B001HNDR3Q,The screen constantly flashes and they keep on showing gang symbols instead of the show. The constant switching from one scene to another makes it very hard to focus on and follow.,1365033600,2,180,4.65625
3639997,5,B001HNDR3Q,"got season 1, now season 2. this is a very interesting show. it comes on the history channel. good watch",1353888000,2,104,4.25
3639998,5,B001HNDR3Q,"Very well made series. Each episode is focused on a different gang, inclusing interviews from current members, former members, aswell as the law enforcement agencys attached to investigating that gang. Definately some parts that may be hard to watch for some people, it is an understatement to say that this contains violence. My only 2 issues with this show is that it was made for people that watch 1 episode at a time, if you plan to sit down and watch a few in a row, you will find it gets repetative. Aswell, the first season is the best one by far, contains all the major gangs, the show kind of goes downhill from there, but thats not to say it gets worse, just not as good as the first season. I grew up in a very gang dominated city and throught i knew a fair ammount about gangs, apparently i was wrong. This series is a definate eye-opener.",1325980800,,851,4.3584905660377355

3640000,4,B001HNDR3Q,"This is my favorite season of Gangland due to the fact that it takes a look into some of the west coast gangs that I'm familiar with like the Bloods, Crips, and 18st. They go into the history of the gangs which is good, but they don't really look into the culture of the gangs too much. It's more like they're painting an image of all gang members being nothing more than low life criminals, but anyone who's grown up around gangs can tell you the lifestyle is much deeper than that. Even with that said, I still say this is a good buy for anyone interested.",1267056000,,558,4.224299065420561
3640001,3,B001HNDR3Q,"Gangland: The Complete Season Two (1998) continues where the first
season left off, covering this micro-history of the USA, focused on
street gangs of major American cities.

The quality of the filming, and the informal yet accurate and
straight to the point narrative is entertaining, allowing viewers to
change gears.

In the case of the 18th street documentary,it clearly lays out 3
separate areas of Los Angeles, which is the WEST SIDE, SOUTH SIDE
and the 18TH STREET area, all of which are very different. The 18th
St is a gang that is decentralized, having no central command or top
down hierarchy, instead comprised of a subset of gangs, such as the
Colombian LyL Cycos.

Understanding the mentality of members is hinted at, by explaining
how members worship a 5 stories high graffiti mural, highlighting
names and faces of recent notorious gang members in that community.
The introverted nature of members comes not only from their youth,
but from not having been exposed to much else.

Originating in Westlake, or Pico Union, West LA in the mid-80's, the
18th St adopted the most relaxed hiring policy of almost any gang at
the time, as compared to the Eme for exmaple, culminating in a
hegemony on the South Side, from its sheer number of members, of all
ethnic extractions  (not just of Guatemala  or El Salvador ), twice
as numberous as MS-13. It adopts the usual hand signals, tattos,
graffiti, rubouts of rivals, shakedowns of pushers, hold ups, and
the use of AK-47, car thefts, etc.

Areas are officially ""controlled and owned"" by a specific clique,
itself operated by a ""shot caller"" (or boss), whom the narcotics
pushers must pay through collectors, as much as $85,000 per week per
street. This results in turf wars between other cliques in the 18TH
st, or rival gangs, such as the Eme, for that revenue.

In this environment, members and opponents walk on eggshells, as
indifference or open animosity suggests a lack of respect for the
clique, prompting beatings, in some cases.

Those extortion rackets on drug pushers run parallel to narcotics
deals, to the point that the second in command, Termite Romero,
cobbled up over half a million USD in cash, at his home, before law
enforcement swooped in, after a measured surveillance operation of
wiretaps and video footage.

Suspecting  a confidential informant within their ranks, the leader
Puppet Martinez, greenlights a rubout on Termite, who rolls to the
FBI.

This is a unique series, although the stories are date from the
1990's.",1266796800,,2505,4.938095238095238
3640002,3,B001HNDR3Q,"there weren't nearly enough flash bangs used in the apprehension of suspects. i know these are based on real crimes, but everyone knows if flash bangs are used, criminals rarely repeat offend. Also telescoping batons are pretty cool and  in the hong kong gang episode i could hardly help but notice no mention of tiger claws repelling gear or the use of crane style kung fu. Its absence was most unexpected and disappointing. I did however like the visuals of early 90s Starter jackets in the Chicago gangs episode. But seriously, more flash bangs.",1265932800,,548,4.829787234042553
3640003,5,B001HNDR3Q,This was a terrific Christmas present for my brother-in-law.  He has shown everyone that visits him this DVD set.,1265760000,,113,4.947368421052632
3640004,5,B001HNDR3Q,"It's been over 10 years since I've witnessed firsthand the destruction that gangs have on the fragile thread that ties American society together. In reality, I've had friends who were gang members and this was a time where I learned about being careful about the friends I choose and watching my back for potential enemies.

Gangland is a series that not only revives those memories of my past vividly, but also informs everyone that the gang problem in the United States is a bigger problem than anyone could have imagined.

This a 3 disc set that includes information that is broad in its spectrum, covering history and current events of all various types of gangs from the bloods and crips of Los Angeles, Biker gangs such as the Mongol Nation, and even asian gangs such as the Chinese Triad in San Francisco.

What I found interesting about all the episodes in season 2, and the entire series in general, is that this program does an excellent job of denoting each gang's history, their rise to fame, the key players of each gang, how each gang finances their activities, and accounts from either current or former gang members. For example, this documentary did a great job in describing who Tookie Williams and Raymond Washington were and their significance in how the Crips came to power in South Central Los Angeles. In addition, the Bloods, who are outnumbered by 2-1, came to existence to protect other gangs who were not enticed to join True Blue. Chicago's history was well covered with the Vice Lords and especially the Gangster Disciples AKA GD6 who continue to terrorize the midwest. After watching this season, I kinda felt that this season should have actually been season 1 since the Bloods and Crips are known to anyone.

Although the episodes are very informative, I did find some information that was left out. For example, although information was discussed about how the word Crip came about, the narrator did not mention that CRIP actually stood for Community Revolution In Progress. Also, as someone who grew up in San Francisco, the coverage of the Asian Triad was nice, but neither this season 2 nor any season in Gangland provide history about other gangs in San Francisco, namely the turf war that continues to exist in the Hunter's Point/Bay View area, which included members of the infamous RBL Posse rap group (Mistah C, Big Cee).

Despite these minor setbacks, this is an excellent series for anyone interested in not only the history of gangs, but how the gang problem is something all of us should be aware of.",1242432000,7,2545,4.801369863013699

3640057,3,B001HNDR3Q,"I bought this series for research on the gang problem in America.  It is well written but careful in its criticism of the violent gangs that run rampant across the country.  I think perhaps it was designed for profitable entertainment rather than historical research.  On the whole it is rather shallow, unless you have an IQ equal to a rock.",1409356800,,342,4.666666666666667

3640060,3,B001HNDR3Q,Seems pretty generic and doesn't differentiate from all the other shows of this genre. Some episodes are obviously better than others but it rarely elicited any real excitement,1375056000,,176,5.321428571428571
3640061,5,B001HNDR3Q,"I'm fascinated by gangland tattoos so if you're like me this show is for you.  you will learn a lot about the ins and outs, dos and don'ts of gang life.  all police and law enforcement should watch this series, other groups such as the armed service and sports franchises could learn from this as well.

3640062,3,B001HNDR3Q,"I don't like how gangs are somewhat glamorized in this show. They never mention, for example, that one of the  Mongols motorcycle gang had been arrested for child molestation.

Gangs hurt communities and bring in prostitution and drugs, bring property values down. They keep citizens terrorized in their own homes. Many of them end up in wheelchairs due to violence. They break their families hearts and miss out on education and the chance to have better lives.

But forget that, let's turn a buck and glamorize gangs. Freaking lame. Hopefully some people will see through the glitter this show tries to put on it. Mostly those of us living next to a s***ty gang territory.",1372982400,,674,4.843478260869565
