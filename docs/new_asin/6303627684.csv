But the best single moment of the movie is the  ""Deep in the heart of Texas"" scene. I must admit that this is a  movie best watched with friends and plenty of liquid refreshment. Wait a  minute, I left out the sombrero wearing bug stomping dance. I must quote  the immortal Joe Bob Briggs "" This movie was filmed by 3 drunk  rednecks with a camcorder"".",919555200,4,519,4.255102040816326

Another thing, there are hardly any werewolf scenes.  Most of the film is a bunch  of rednecks  squaredancing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",917827200,,333,7.2
714875,1,6303627684,ok I saw this movie when it was relesed in 1995 and I can still remember that mostly the ENTIRE movie was rednecks dancing in a bar to country-western music. There were only a few scenes of a warewolf and they wernt that scary. I remember laughing the entire movie I think the makers of this film were having a good time and forgot what the movie was supposed to be about! LOL! Because they definatly over-did it with the bar scenes. I felt like I was watching a 2 hour hoe-down rather that a horror movie.,1109548800,8,506,4.22680412371134

FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE PRODUCTION CREW QUIT HALFWAY THRU THE FILMING AND THE STAR PRETTY MUCH FINISHED IT HIMSELF ALONG WITH THE VARIOUS AND SUNDRY CO-STARS WHO ARE ACTUALLY REAL LIFE RESIDENTS OF PIONEERTOWN CALIFORNIA! I BOUGHT THIS OUT OF CURIOSITY BECAUSE IM A REGULAR VISITOR TO THAT LOVELY HIGH DESERT TOWN BUT WHY ALL THE CORNY JOKES AND LINE DANCING IS BEYOND ME.

714878,1,6303627684,"""Look Jeb!  Them there flimin' people are gonna make a picture in our favorit bar!""  Hmmm... the director must have chugged a gallon of moonshine left around the bar.  There's absolutely no other way anyone could make such a dull, stupid movie.  What's the deal with the redneck square dances and drinking scenes?  Oh wait, let me take a sip of Farmer Whitey's best moonshine so I can get a better view of this ""unique"" perspective.  I mean come on.  A total disgrace to ""the Howling.""  There IS NO BEST SCENE BECAUSE THEY ALL BITE THE SAME AMOUNT.  Here, take an example.  ""The guards' guns are loaded with silver bullets.""  Really?  Where did they get them?  Or do all rednecks have silver bullets at home.  Mr. Fanatical Reverend?  The ""guards"" are drinking on the job!  Honestly, everyone has a thin personality and a drinking problem.  Oh, and the werewolf is a blur with a yellow T-shirt.  Any questions?",994032000,2,910,4.651898734177215
714879,1,6303627684,"Some people would say that this was a funny movie. Well, the only people that would say that would have to be someone who had something to do with the production of this sorry excuse for a movie. I say that it was the worst piece of garbage that I have ever seen. The Howling movies aren't supposed to be fun to watch, they're supposed to be horror movies. This was a movie about a bunch of hicks line dancing and singing terrible country songs. It never even showed a werewolf until the end, and it looked like someone wearing a cheap halloween mask. The so called actors acted like a bunch of losers picked up off the street and asked if they wanted to be in a movie. I would say that it had terrible special effects, but there were no special effects, there weren't even any effects. I hated this movie so much that I wanted to shoot the VCR and then burn the movie so that no one would ever have to be tortured by it again. I really despise everyone involved in this movie for tricking me into thinking that I would be watching one of the classic Howling movies.",988502400,,1066,4.230392156862745
714880,1,6303627684,"Clive Turner (director, writer and star) can be blamed for the decline of the Howling series since his involvement began with part three. Here he takes the entire process on himself, trashing the series with what is not only the worst horror film but absolutely the worst movie of all time! Yes, it is that bad! Witness line dancing sequences that roll before your eyes for lengthy periods of time, Turner himself hamming it up in front of the camera with stupid human tricks and a severe case of egomania, a werewolf that makes the kiddie masks at your local dime store appear realistic and last but certainly not least a host of actors who couldn't act their way out of a shallow grave. And that is where this pathetic celluloid trash should have gone in the first place... into a shallow grave! Horribly written, ineptly directed I suggest you ignore this lousy excuse for a movie at all costs!",986947200,11,897,4.6125
714881,5,6303627684,"Don't misunderstand me by my rating:  this movie is really really bad, but at least it isn't boring.  It has these hypnotic line dancing sequences,  great, dumb dialogue, the most maniacal music I've ever heard, and the plot  continuity is almost nonexistant.  If you like campy, you're going to get  your money's worth with this one.",940896000,3,334,4.875
7853639,3,6303627684,"although I doubt if the story/plot/backstory will ever come together completely for me. The final transformation scene definitely would be improved with a W/S DVD release. Otherwise, still worth seeking out!",1521331200,,207,5.709677419354839
7853640,2,6303627684,"Released in 1995, Howling: New Moon Rising chronicles events in a small California desert town after a long-haired Australian rides into town on his Harley (Clive Turner) and a series of murders occurs. A priest insists its the work of a demonic werewolf (John Huff ) and a detective (John Ramsden) zeroes-in on the stranger.

Clive Turner, the producer/director/writer/star was forced to use non-actors due to his limited non-budget. The only figure I could find was $250,000, but some would argue that it sounds like too much. Whatever the case, the bad actors, the focus on country music and the scarcity of a werewolf understandably prompts loathing from most viewers. But, if you can acclimate to the lousy non-acting, the storys another werewolf mystery in the mold of 1988s Howling IV and 1989s Howling V, both of which Turner wrote and had a bit part.

What I like about this installment is that it tries to connect all the movies with flashbacks to the two aforementioned flicks and, if you listen carefully, makes references to the others. It also brings back Romy Windsor from IV and regularly references Elizabeth Shs character from V; Sh is also listed in the cast, but I couldn't pinpoint her, except in the flashback scenes) (the comely woman in the yellow shirt at the end is Cheryl Allen, not Sh). The other thing I like about it is that its consistently amusing with several corny jokes and you can tell the cast had a good time together.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Pioneertown and nearby Yucca Valley, California.

7853641,2,6303627684,"Not sure what to rate as far as stars go for this movie. I have the entire Howling series on dvd with the exception of this one :-( seen it before but yet to be able to find it on dvd. Anyone out there know why this movie is not found easily on dvd? I am a huge collector/horror movie collector and wouldn't mind atleast finishing off the series despite its low reviews, I DO agree this isn't the greatest movie but I have seen worse! Feel free to hit me up horror fans",1455062400,,469,4.0
7853642,1,6303627684,"OMG why did I watch this? Now I need a lobotomy, the only horror in the film is watching it, and where is the werewolf? I feel cheated he was only seen a couple of times in the whole damn thing. It's done country style I thought hm this'll be good, however as the movie went on they have line dancing Which they went overboard with by the way and all the participants in it with their dead pan expressions look like their bored to death at a funeral and facing a firing squad plus it is agonizingly slow on parts of it, I've been to country and western bars trust me the dancing there is nothing like in this movie it's lively and energetic, there is so much line dancing this could be a music video randomly throughout the movie they switched from a scene to the bleeping line dancing, WTF?

Out of all the sequels made to the first movie [ The Howling ] they are great, but this one sorry to say sucks, the first one was very well done mixing elements of country and city perfectly. I found out it was not the same guy who did The Howling and it's sequels. The actors are wonderful though, honest to god I feel bad for them. instead of 1 star I wish they had a thumbs down rating then they'ed have no stars yes I am that evil muwhahaha",1420070400,,1237,4.1115702479338845
7853643,1,6303627684,"New Moon Rising was made on a $250,000 budget so the film ties together the previous three sequels, Howling IV: The Original Nightmare, Howling V: The Rebirth, and Howling VI: The Freaks, featuring characters and footage from each. New Moon Rising didn't even get a US DVD much less a Blu-ray. It is one of the worst horror films I have ever seen (perhaps it would be tied with House of the Dead). Even for the Howling franchise it's low-grade material full of square dancing and bad dialogue. They didn't pay the director, editor or actors and it is shockingly bad even for the 1990s. Sleepaway Camp looks deluxe next to this. I loved Howling V: The Rebirth but this doesn't come close. Do they even put the wolf in it anymore? I'm not sure a werewolf film can be scary but werewolves seem to show up for about 90 minutes of screen time in the eight-film franchise overall and they rarely look good. Clive Turner (director, writer and star) has been blamed for the decline of the Howling series since his involvement began with Howling 4. Not that the original was amazing but it was fun. Maybe The Howling in New Moon Rising means your sister in Part 2 or the kangaroos in Part 3. Even the Twilight-like sequel following this movie was an improvement. Howdy to Pioneertown, California residents! I can see they are selling it for $70 now. That's crazy-talk and the biggest price inflation I have ever seen for this quality of a product. Amazon reviewers give it a lowly 2.5 stars. IMDB rates it a 1.7 which is the lowest rating in their database! It ranks as one of the Bottom 100 Movies of All-Time.",1377648000,,1602,4.527586206896552
7853644,1,6303627684,"THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE. I like horror movies and loved parts 1,2,3,4,and 5(part 6 was bad too but had vampire vs. werewolf action WAY before Underworld was released), but this Razzi is why the Razzi awards were invented.

7853645,5,6303627684,"This has got to be the funniest movie ever made. There is so much wrong with it that it's overwhelming. Pointless, tactless camera angles, Abrupt, shallow scenes, horrible actors stumbling over ridiculous dialogue. To top it off, there are so many square dancing scenes that it honestly seems like it was just made by some square dancing club. If you read the cast list, most of the characters just have the actor's name. I'd definitely recommend it though, I've not laughed this hard at a movie as long as I can remember.",1153526400,5,522,4.684782608695652

ACTOR-DIRECTOR-WRITER-AND PRODUCER OF THE FILM DID A EXCELLNET JOB. ALTHOUGH I WILL ADMIT IT LACKED IN SOME PLACES AND IT'S PREDECESSORS. IT IS MY OPINION THAT THIS WAS AND STILL IS ONE OF THE BEST B-WEREWOLF FLICKS TO EVER END IT'S FRANCHISE. AND QUTIE SURPRISINGLY, I ACTUALLY OWN THIS ON A FACTORY COMMERCIAL RELEASE DVD, AND I ALSO OWN THIS ON VHS TAPE, ALSO NOT A BOOTLEG.YOU FANS CAN FIND A COPY OF IT NOW ON E-BAY, AND IT'S REAL CHEAP. ALTHOUGH SOME FANS SAY THIS IS REALLY NO GOOD, I BEG TO DIFFER. IF YOU THINK THAT THIS MOVIE WAS CHEESY, THEN SEE HOWLING II: YOUR SISTER IS A WEREWOLF. THAT WAS EVEN CHEESIER THAN THIS ONE AND 2 WAS REAL GOOD ANWAY. CHEESIER BUT REAL GOOD.",1128556800,2,845,4.320754716981132
7853647,1,6303627684,"Ok, I enjoy watching the B-est of B flicks. I like cheesy low budget films. This does not even classify as a B flick. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I could not even watch the entire thing (rare for me), though not from a lack of trying. The entire time in this movie people are just standing around in a bar telling bad jokes that you have heard a million times. Then for no reason they will cut to a scene with people line dancing to country western music in a dark room with light shining in through an open door. When they finally did get around to having a werewolf scene it was not remotely scary, horror like, or even cheesy. It was just sad. I would advise avoiding this movie like the plague, though the plague would probably be more fun.",1126656000,2,758,4.163265306122449
