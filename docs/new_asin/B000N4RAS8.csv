2755677,5,B000N4RAS8,Still my #1 favorite disaster film!!!!!!  I have watched this one at least 20 times and will probably watch it another 20!,1277683200,,122,4.545454545454546
2755678,5,B000N4RAS8,Two of my favorite shows together.  disaster films are so exciting and these two keep you on the edge of your seat.  Also if you are every in a situation that you require a leader; just hope someone like these guys will step up to the plate.,1216857600,,241,4.1063829787234045
2755679,5,B000N4RAS8,"This disaster double feature is a great addition to the collection of anyone who enjoys such epic adventures as ""Towering Inferno, ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" and ""Earthquake.""  Both movies have big name actors and great special effects.  If you suffer from claustrophobia, don't watch these movies.  Disaster survivors are trapped beneath earth and water and must battle hard to live.  My favorite is ""Daylight"" because it is very reminescent of ""The Poseidon Adventure.""  Instead of Reverend Scott trying to lead people to safety, you have Kit Latura.  I also enjoy listening to the theme song for ""Daylight"" - ""Whenever There is Love.""  Each movie is on a separate disc that is loaded with extras.",1200700800,4,698,5.123893805309734
2755680,4,B000N4RAS8,"Both Dante's Peak and Daylight are typical disaster flics.  The acting is second to the special effects.  Particularly for Daylight, where Stallone's performance is far from Oscar worthy.  Brosnan provides a more convincing performace in Dante's Peak, but both movies are saddled with mediocre scripts.  Notwithstanding, they are enjoyable and entertaining.",1199059200,2,357,5.9411764705882355

2755759,5,B000N4RAS8,"DAYLIGHT is hands down an incredibly underrated film. In fact DAYLIGHT is one of Sylvester Stallone's best films ever. Stallone as Kit Latura gives one of this best performance ever as he tries to rescue all those trapped in a tunnel under the Hudson River between Lower Manhattan and Jersey City, New Jersey. You talk about determined, Sylvester Stallone is so convincing and determined to save all of the those trapped. Stallone's performance is very physical and demanding. And there is also a very impressive cast including Amy Brenneman, Viggo Mortensen, Dan Hedaya, Jay O. Sanders, Karen Young, Claire Bloom, Danielle Harris and Barry Newman. The excellent score is by Randy Edelman. DANTE'S PEAK is another underrated film. It contains one of Pierce Brosnan's best performances. The acting and not the plot are what make this action film a cut above many others in the same genre.

2755781,5,B000N4RAS8,"Being a geologist (though not a volcanologist), I naturally went to see Dante's Peak when is first came to cinemas.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, both for the plot and for the convincing images of a volcanic eruption and its results.  Except, that is, for the lava flow, which was quite inappropriate for a volcano of Dante's Peak type - I didn't quite scream in indignation when I saw it.  Additionally, I'm not sure about the lake being so acidic as to dissolve the boat and flesh (near the end of the film).  Apart from these two objections, I consider it a very good exposition of the dangers of a volcanologist's work and the problems arising when an eruption appears to be imminent.  The story - strange events begin occurring, alerting the volcanologist and leading him to believe that an eruption, which with that type of volcano would be dangerously explosive, was imminent.  A large town lies close to the volcano.  The people must be warned - but how forcefully and with how much urgency?  Anyone forecasting a volcanic eruption or an earthquake has to fear giving a false alarm or leading people to think that the danger is closer than it turns out to be - or, of course, that it is further away.  Panic must be avoided but so too must giving a sense of false security.

Daylight, another disaster movie, I didn't see until I bought the DVD.  Disaster in a vehicular tunnel, with all the bad things that can happen and the bravery of people overcoming the dangers.  Also very enjoyable;  I'm very glad that I bought the pair.",1372723200,3,1533,4.591911764705882

2755783,5,B000N4RAS8,"These two movies here I was thrilled to find that they put them together like this.  First off these two movies are FANTASTIC movies and I love them....can't really explain why except they just are fantastic movies.  Action filled, awesome actors and dang it I just love these two movies and I giving it not only a 5 star for this reason but for the fact that they made this into a double feature so I didn't have to buy the movies individually!",1369180800,,445,4.349397590361446

2755789,5,B000N4RAS8,It plays like a new dvd even though it was bought used. The movies are Great Dantes Peak is always a GREAT MOVIE and while I hadnt seen Daylight I decided to get it after reading the Description. I like Stallone and the movie was well worth it. It also plays beautifully. Im never afraid to buy used Dvds or Cds from this dealer because they are always in very good condition and play beautifully. I always buy from them because they have never let me down. I would recomend them to anybody anytime. Used cds and dvds are a bargain if you find a reliable dealer and go hastings is very reliable.,1359331200,2,595,4.274336283185841
2755790,5,B000N4RAS8,2 really great movies in one case.  daylight is about a tunnel that floods in and sylvester stollone has to save the day.  Dante's peak is about a volcano that takes a whole town out.  dante's peak is a true story.,1342656000,,214,4.170731707317073

8174733,5,B000N4RAS8,"Nice collection comes with both movies, each on its own Blu-Ray disc. Both are good movies and I was amazed how good the effects in Dantes Peak holds up. Still think the grandmother was the dumbest person in the whole movie. Nice disaster movie.

Daylight is also a good disaster movie. Though it's biggest fault is an abrupt cut from Stallone and Madelyn to another scene, it feels like the movie jumps every time I watch it. In reality everyone would have died from smoke, fire, or fumes but that would have made it a mini movie.",1524614400,,531,4.474226804123711
8174734,3,B000N4RAS8,"Great price. Blu ray quality is okay with Dante's peak. The sound is 5.1, that is okay too. Nothing particularly amazing but if you like these movies then it is simply the best they have right now. Wish the picture was a bit more enhanced and the sound was 7.1 instead of DTS 5.1. Experienced Dante's peak in theatres, when it came out, now that was quiet an experience and the sound in the DTS theater hall was unbelievable. Good ole days!",1524009600,,440,4.378048780487805

8174739,4,B000N4RAS8,"Good value. Each flick on its own disc, with features.

Dante's Peak: Getting Close to the Show (multipart 4:3 making-of); commentary; trailer. 2.35:1. Nice A/V upgrade. Includes uHear Blu-ray ""enhancement"": Yellow button does a short rewind and with subtitles on; use Subtitles button to turn off again.

Daylight has most of the same features as the old Collector's Edition DVD: Multipart 4:3 making-of, music video, commentary, featurette, archives, trailers; no cast & crew listings. 1.85:1. A bit grainy in the dark chapel.

The Universal apps are mostly expired, no longer available, and a lamentable waste of space. For example, BD Live is ""coming soon"" on both discs. The flicks and features are still good value.",1521244800,,721,5.252173913043478
