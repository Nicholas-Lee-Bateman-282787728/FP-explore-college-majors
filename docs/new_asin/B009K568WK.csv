8542367,1,B009K568WK,"If you enjoy pointless, disjointed avant-garde movies this is the one you've been waiting for.  Maybe to be admired as some form of abstract art rather than a film with an actual narrative plot.  Somewhat reminiscent of unsuccessful experimental works produced during the very early years of film making.",1403481600,2,304,5.183673469387755
8542368,3,B009K568WK,"A 2012 Portuguese drama begins with a sort of metaphorical prologue about an adventurer, which is followed by the main story, told in two parts. In the first part, Aurora (Laura Soveral), an eccentric eighty-something old lady, often gambling in the casino, asks her housemaid Santa (Isabel Cardoso) and neighbor Pilar (Teresa Madruga) to find a man named Gian-Luca Ventura. Aurora is clearly dying.

Cue to the second part, where the story goes back in time to fifty years ago somewhere in Portuguese-colonized Africa. We meet young Aurora (Ana Moreira), married, who meets a traveler Gian-Luca Ventura (Carloto Cotta). Told entirely in a voiceover (without dialogue), the melodramatic story follows the fates of Aurora and Gian-Luca.

Portuguese critic-turned-film director Miguel Gomes pays tribute to ""Tabu,"" F. W. Murnau's final film made in 1931 (which also has a two-part narrative structure). Film critics would have a field day with this new film that seems to consciously play on many narrative conventions, with each shot carefully framed. But to me, Gomes' ""Tabu"" is a typical case of style-over-substance, though I admit I am impressed with the photography (especially that of the second segment) meticulously re-creating the black-and-white images of the classic films.

The acting cannot be faulted. Ana Moreira is excellent as young Aurora. Two Ronettes cover songs (""Be My Baby"" and ""Baby I Love You,"" both sung in Portuguese) are effectively used. Her performance and the Ronettes songs, albeit briefly, bring in something emotional that is missing in ""Tabu,"" a film that is beautiful to look at but too self-conscious for us to fully enjoy.",1380931200,2,1659,5.276515151515151
8542369,3,B009K568WK,"""Tabu"" is not a bad film, at least, entirely. It is made of an introduction presenting a sort of legend about a lady ghost and a crocodile, and two short films. While different in plot, according to what I read, ""Tabu"" is inspired by a 1931 film with the same title and split in two parts with the same names as well.

The first one is called ""Lost Paradise"". In my opinion, it is this short film the one that ruins the entire experience. First of all, the black and white doesn't work, at least for me, for a story set in modern times. The place is Lisbon, and it's the story of Pilar and Aurora: two older ladies who suffer from loneliness. The major problem with this first part of the film is the acting and the dialogues. Everything feels stiff and mechanical. The actresses representing Pilar and Aurora are good, but I think it's the script what conveys an atmosphere that comes across as listless rather than melancholic, as it pretends to be. The girl who plays the friend of Pilar's daughter is the worst of all; she even sounds and moves like a robot, although, fortunately, she plays a short part. To be honest, this first part is a ""lost"" case without any redemption. I thought it was boring and I would not watch it again.

The second part is called ""Paradise"". It is this part, in my opinion, the one that modestly saves the film. The plot, which has to do with Aurora's youth, has been done before over and over, so there is nothing new here. However, perhaps it is the African setting, perhaps it is the narration, this story of unrequited love set in colonial times, where the black and white actually works, is very romantic in an old fashion kind of way. It is completely narrated with no dialogues at all, but it is almost like a poem with a silent film feel to it. This part of the film I would watch again.

This was my first Portuguese film, and while I am not utterly impressed with this one, I am still curious to watch more Portuguese films. All in all, a film whose second part is worth watching is you're in the mood for an old fashion story of unrequited love done in modern times.",1373932800,2,2111,4.352791878172589
8542370,2,B009K568WK,"Sometimes I think critics include a movie on their top 10 lists simply because it's the last one they remember seeing. That might be the case with ""Tabu,"" which showed up on more than one list, but isn't nearly as interesting a film as it pretends to be, or as the critics who rave about it seem to think it is. ""Tabu"" is full of auteur tricks and cinephile homages. It borrows its name from an obscure FW Murnau silent, it's filmed in black and white and utilizes two different film speeds, and the entire second half has no dialogue, only voiceover. But underneath all those tricks is a surprising conventional film. Well, more precisely, two films.

After a brief interlude involving an intrepid explorer, a ghost and a crocodile, Part 1 begins, which is titled ""Lost Paradise."" It's about three women living in present-day Lisbon -- Pilar, her neighbor Aurora, and Aurora's African caretaker, Santa. Aurora is wildly dramatic, and probably senile.  She sneaks away from Santa to gamble away any money she comes across. She corners Pilar one day and shares her fears that Santa is a servant of the devil who has imprisoned her and cast a curse upon them all. Of course the truth is much less dramatic, but Pilar still feels obligated to try and do something for her aging neighbor. And when her health takes a turn for the worse and Aurora asks her only friend to track down a man she once knew, of course Pilar obliges her.

The man's name is Ventura, and he's not very hard to track down. The second half of the film, titled ""Paradise,"" is his recounting of his relationship with Aurora; the entire thing is narrated by him but acted out like something from ""Unsolved Mysteries"" -- the actors on the screen speak but we never hear their words, only ambient sounds around them. It is an interesting way to portray a memory, to keep us aware that this isn't happening, it's being remembered. But really - an hour of flashback? The contrivance grows old fast, and we never transition out of it into more immediate and direct storytelling. The memory takes place in Mozambique, back when it was a Portuguese colony. Aurora is the beautiful bored wife of a rich merchant, and Ventura is a rake and a roustabout. He looks an awful lot like pirate Johnny Depp in ""Chocolat."" Of course this is the kind of guy you should never trust around your women, but Aurora's husband is out of town quite a bit, and there's the matter of a constantly escaping pet crocodile. Pretty soon they are in bed (Aurora and Ventura, not the crocodile) and not long after that they are in love. But she is pregnant, and the baby is her husband's, not her lover's. This is a love story that can only end in tragedy. (Which, of course, we already knew, because this is all being tragically remembered, mind you.)

So essentially, we have two movies -- the two parts are too stylistically different to be considered anything else. The first half is a quiet, borderline boring Euroflick about aging and loneliness. It has a vaguely Almodovarian feel, though there are no transvestites or ghosts, only a cadre of middle-aged women. The second half is more classical, and also more formulaic, reminiscent of sweeping, exotic romances from the golden age of Hollywood without ever approaching that kind of grandeur. (Indeed, it uses pretense to steer clear of that kind of grandeur and emotional intensity. Of it was as overheated and melodramatic as the movies it's emulating, it would probably be unbearably campy.) Both halves are decently made short films -- probably better than average, but I think for ""Tabu"" to really work, the two halves need to connect on a deeper level than the plot. And that never materializes. I want the two halves to comment on each other, to enrich each other in some way, but it's just not there. So really, all it amounts to is, ""hey, you know that crazy old lady next door? She's got a quite a story, set in Africa, about infidelity and murder and crocodiles. Imagine that!""

""In all my films there is an urge for fiction,"" Mr. Gomes said in an interview with Slate. ""There is a first part that begs for another film to appear, and it does because of our common desire."" I'd say he's accomplished about half of that goal, twice over. While watching ""Tabu,"" I kept waiting for another film to appear, a more interesting, more subtle and complex, more deeply layered film. But it never does. So I guess I'll move on to the next thing, and keep looking.

Random Notes:

-- I enjoyed the relationship between Pilar and the painter more than most anything else in the first half. Though they only have two or three scenes, volumes are communicated between them. She's lonely, and he wants to be her companion, someone to go to the movies with. She's not impressed with his art, and he's awfully sentimental. I think he's about to propose to her in the scene after the movies. Would she say yes? Maybe, but not because she loves him. Because he's better than being lonely, and there's no one else in the picture, nor is there likely to be.

--Gomes' style and cinematic tricks -- especially the opening prologue reminded me of Guy Maddin's films. But Maddin accomplishes a great deal more in movies like ""My Winnipeg"" and ""Brand Upon the Brain"" than Gomes manages here. There's a method to Maddin's madness; Gomes is just all sound and fury, signifying nothing.

-- A lot of critics have raved about the way ""Tabu"" pays homage to silent films, in the same way they raved about ""The Artist."" last year. But as I said last year, it's fine to pay homage to a bygone era, but you still have to make a good movie in the meantime. ""Tabu"" fails in the same way ""The Artist"" did; both of them just make me want to watch any one of the truly great silent films.

--Throughout the film there are somewhat aggressive hints at race relations - between Santa and Aurora, and between the white colonizers and their African subjects. The film ends with the beginning of the Mozambique revolution. My hunch is that the connection between the two halves was supposed to be sociopolitical, centered on Santa's relationship with Aurora compared/contrasted to the Africans in colonial Mozambique. But this element always sits on the edges; it never comes front and center the way it needs to. I feel like maybe something got lost in the editing process. That's just a hunch.",1369353600,,6354,4.64
8542371,5,B009K568WK,"This is probably the only film where a crocodile and a ghost sit side by side next to a river. ""Tabu"" is quite an oddball effort, divided into two parts - one is Lisbon in winter and the other is the steamy landscape of colonial Africa. Though both are in black and white, the African sections are filmed as silents, even using a different film stock to make the transition to an older time feel more distinct. The connecting link is the story of Aurora, now a dying woman who asks a friend to inquire about her former Italian lover.

It's a film - like a moving impressionist painting -  about loneliness, longing, memory - of forgotten love affairs and dangerous places - in the world and in the heart.  Since this movie does not follow any typical familiar Western narrative structure, you simply will have to experience it as...texture, music, and mood. Portuguese ""Fado"" is like that.  I particularly looked forward to the African sequences which have no dialogue other than the old lover's monologue and background sounds, even some popular music.

In summary, the director, as artist, is dramatizing how our imperfect memories reimagine the past. Now ""that"" is using cinema in a creative way.",1363046400,6,1199,4.7729468599033815
