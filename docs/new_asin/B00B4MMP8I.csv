5555738,2,B00B4MMP8I,"Not funny enough and rather slow.  Wasn't quite what I expected from Australian film makers.  Ryan Kwanten was, as always, sweet and goofy, however, I didn't think the enough thought was put into the goings on.",1366761600,,210,4.805555555555555
5555739,5,B00B4MMP8I,"I love these types of movies. Ordinary people. Extraordinary circumstances. Real people facing difficult situations. What do you do?

Here's the story line. Young party guy finds out he has testicular cancer. Once he has surgery he will no longer be able to have children. He loves the idea of having a family.

So young guy tries to find someone, anyone, who will bear a child for him. Finally, his best friend steps up to the plate. She is willing. Not excited about the possibility of being a mother but there are some benefits that seem appealing. So they make a pact and try for a child.

This movie is so entertaining and engrossing that despite the raunchy sex we stuck with it and were rewarded with a wonderfully endearing story and finale. Totally recommend this film. It was far better than we expected.",1406851200,3,814,4.638888888888889
5555740,4,B00B4MMP8I,"""Not Suited for Children"" (2012 release from Australia; 97 min.) brings the story of Jonah (played by Ryan Kwanten), a twenty-something happy-go-lucky guy who DJs parties and is living the good life. Soon into the movie, he learns he has testicular cancer, and before he undergoes remedial treatment, which will leave him infertile, he decides he wants to find some woman, ANYONE, to have a child with. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, despite the subject matter,,this is not a raunchy movie by any stretch, on the contrary. It is in fact a movie about someone reflecting on the real possibility that he will never have a child. It turns Jonah into a completely different person from who he was when the movie opens. His quest to find someone leads to all kinds of hilarious, smile-inducing moments. Second, I love the movie's title. Is this film not suited for children? Is Jonah not suited for children because of his medical condition? Or because of the person that he is? Just watch! Third, there is some great music in the movie (Jonah being a DJ) and the soundtrack is available here on Amazon.

Bottom line: when I picked this movie up at my local library the other day, I didn't really what to expect, but I was charmed by the movie, It's a nice 'little' indie movie (which happens to come from Australia) that entertained me from start to finish. ""Not Suitable for Children"" is definitely worth checking out.",1393977600,,1525,4.707865168539326

5555742,4,B00B4MMP8I,"This was a pleasure!  Ryan Kwanten has a face and expression that emote such feeling that he hardly has to speak the words.  He created Jason Stackhouse and is nothing like that character, yet we love and laugh with him every episode of True Blood.  These movies should be more advertised to us happily-ever-after people so that we can relate them to each other and make them a hit.  We don't need gratuitous death,  just a slightly complicated resolved happy ending.  Life is already full of misery.  Give us just the right amount of sex and a great epilogue and we'll keep coming back for more.  Someone should cast Ryan Kwanten in a hit that showcases his empathy.  He would be a major star and I being 62 and not a beefcake groupie, would watch anything in which he starred.  Enjoyed this movie thoroughly and would recommend it to all happily-ever-after junkies.  (The other two major characters were also perfectly cast.)",1375056000,5,927,4.695652173913044
5555743,3,B00B4MMP8I,"From Australian TV director Peter Templeman (""Lockie Leonard"", ""Bogan Pride"", ""Marx and Venus"") and writer Michael Lewis (""Offspring"") comes the Australian romantic comedy ""Not Suitable for Children"".

Released in theaters in Australia in July 2012, the film stars Ryan Kwanten (""True Blood"", ""Summerland"", ""Spellbinder: Land of the Dragon Lord""), Sarah Snook (""Crystal Jam"", ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""Sisters of War"") and Ryan Corr (""Where the Wild things Are"", ""Silversun"", ""Packed to the Rafters"").

VIDEO:

""Not Suitable for Children"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and presented in 2:35:1.  Picture quality is good, but there are times where the picture looks a bit soft.  But for the most part, the film looks natural and picture quality is well-saturated.

As for the audio, ""Not Suitable for Children"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and Dolby Digital Stereo.  The film is primarily dialogue driven with a lot of music.  Surround channels are not used all that much throughout the film but primarily during crowd sequences but for a film such as this, the lossless soundtrack is appropriate.

JUDGMENT CALL:

There have been a good number of comedies that took on the best friends looking to raise a child together.  From the 2010, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston film ""The Switch"" to 2011s Jennifer Westfeldt film ""Friends with Kids"" and in 2012, we have the Australian romantic comedy ""Not Suitable for Children"".

Where the wanting to have kids shown on films are usually the female protagonist, ""Not Suitable for Children"" goes a different route and gives us a single man who wants to have a child, because he will no longer be able to have children after treatment for testicular cancer.

For the character of Jonah (portrayed by ""True Blood"" actor Ryan Kwanten), his life changes when he is told by his doctor that he has cancer and although treatable, they need to remove a testicle.  Because he is in his 20s, a party guy (who runs parties for a living), he feels that life has dealt him a severe blow of not having any possibility to have children ever.

While his two good friends and business partners, Stevie (portrayed by Sarah Snook) and Gus (portrayed by Ryan Corr) try to give him moral support, they try their best to make him feel positive about his life.

So, he contacts his ex-girlfriend and women he has dated and trying to find a woman he can get pregnant, so he can raise a child.  Of course, no woman is not going to take him up on the deal, but his best friend Stevie tries to give him encouraging advice of possibly helping out a lesbian couple, which also doesn't work out.

Being a very good friend of Jonah for so long, Stevie realizes that she wants to have a kid before she turns 40 and so she tries to have a mutual deal that would help both her and Jonah at the same time.  But of course, after continued sex in order to get Stevie pregnant, both start to realize that their may be some feelings that the two have for each other.

While the film is charming and fun, it's also straightforward and banal.  It is predictable and there are not many surprises with this independent film.

As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is good but a little soft at times, the soundtrack features a good amount of music, so dialogue, music are crystal clear while the surround also takes advantage of the more crowd environments and overall party ambiance.  And you get two special features plus a trailer.

Overall, ""Not Suitable for Children"" is an enjoyable independent film from Australia that takes the ""best friends try to have a child together"" storyline, but with a male protagonist wanting to have a child.  While predictable and straightforward, ""Not Suitable for Children"" is a fun and enjoyable film worth checking out!",1372896000,,4347,4.931224209078405
5555744,3,B00B4MMP8I,"Diagnosed with testicular cancer, a weekend-party-arranger stops to play for fun but desperate for a female willing a kid with him to produce as clocks ticked for his surgery.

Personal revelations follow such quest for fulfilling a time-sensitive goal.

It seems, this work, unwittingly, is a good parody on talking of family values and sex-as-pure-reproduction only. Accurate lovemaking-scenes add to run of a screening enriched with swearing and sexism.",1370304000,3,456,5.594202898550725

5555746,2,B00B4MMP8I,"With undecipherable Australian accents and no subtitles to help, I probably would have enjoyed this more.  It did, however, offer a few amusing scenes to keep up the interest",1369440000,,174,5.0
5555747,3,B00B4MMP8I,"Overall, I liked this movie.  It dealt with the polar opposite of what most movies about ""baby fever"" are focused on.  This time it's about a guy who finds out he won't be able to have children and suddenly, he finds himself questioning what he wants out of life.

There were some very predictable parts, but that's to be expected with a movie that's meant to be a rom-com.  The character development of Jonah was good through the movie.  Like another reviewer stated, there were times that the movie seemed to be slow, but when dealing with the subject matter - it made sense for more ""showing"" versus telling to happen.

My biggest complaint was the ending.  It felt unfinished.  Even just a small snippet of Jonah and Stevie in the not-so-distant future would have made it feel complete.  Had there been a true conclusion/finale, I would've given it 4 stars.",1369353600,2,861,4.6490066225165565
5555748,5,B00B4MMP8I,"I thought this would be a very raunchy movie, but it turned out to have more more heart than you would think. Some people might find it slow, but I find that slower indie movies are much more realistic and easier to relate to. I will mention that it might offend some people's sensibilities. Obviously there's sex - an mildly extended blowjob scene, and some tastefully done full on sex scenes in the middle. Obviously premarital sex and babies, and treating reproduction as a business arrangement. Lastly they throw in some cocaine, which I found rather jarring and unnecessary. Still, funny movie with a core that I think a lot of people can relate to.",1368144000,4,654,4.695652173913044

8562444,4,B00B4MMP8I,"Another solid film from Australia.  The two stars, Ryan Kwanten and Sarah Snook are both quality actorsl--especially Sarah Snook (see her play a guy in Predestination with Ethan Hawke), who's clearly the stand-out of the film and someone to watch.  The dialogue, acting and production quality are all first rate.  This isn't a Seth Rogen raunch-out, like you might expect, but rather takes some twists and turns that keep you pulling for our protagonists as we watch them change. Heartfelt and endearing without being sappy, and really a surprisingly good film.  Time well spent.",1452124800,,579,5.127659574468085
