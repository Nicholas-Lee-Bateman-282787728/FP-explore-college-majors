7554368,5,B018T4A4N6,"While the sai are widely recognized weapons in martial arts fandom, very little is actually known about how the weapon itself is utilized.  Even in martial arts cinema, outside of a cartoon turtle, very seldom are the weapons seen in action.  Are they defensive or offensive? Sharp or dull? Used for stabbing or blocking? Or both?  In this DVD, YMAA answers all those questions.

In the introduction, Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming provides a little history and principles behind the weapon.  Following the introduction, Nicholas Yang goes into further detail demonstrating proper handling followed by fundamental sai combat techniques.  Blocking and striking fundamentals (including trapping and sticking) are covered in depth, in all possible arrangements of the dual weapons.  Partner training demonstrations further illustrate and highlight the fundamental movements and applications.  A complete sequence (taolu/kata) is then shown in four separate sections, each section first shown slow, then at full speed, before being broken down into individual movements followed by demonstration and discussion of combat application.  Combat applications versus long and short weapons is discussed although most applications are shown against a long staff.  This is the only YMAA DVD to date that demonstrates techniques of paired short weapons; many of the stepping, blocking, and striking techniques shown can be applied to a wide range of other paired short weaponry, such as short sticks, butterfly swords, tonfa, etc, making this a valuable DVD to add to any martial artist's media collection.

In it's entirety, the presentation lasts approximately 180 minutes.  A multi-page booklet outlining the video content and offering additional historical information about the sai accompanies the DVD. Overall, the content and presentation of the material in this DVD make it by far one of my favorites of the YMAA collection.",1457395200,2,1910,5.570934256055363
7554369,5,B018T4A4N6,"In martial arts weapons are a significant emphasis. The goal, in the end, is to become proficient in a broad spectrum of armaments and so to become fluid and flexible enough to turn anything into a weapon. The Sai (Chinese: chai) has a long history in short-range weaponry. Nicholas C. Yang has crafted a 4  hour video to walk martial artists through the basic fundamentals of using double sai, teaching the sequence of the Chinese White Crane Double Sai, and carefully illustrating the martial applications of almost all of the various moves.

The DVD begins with a special presentation by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming on the history and principles of the double sai. Then Nicholas Yang takes over to explain and demonstrate solo moves of both blocking and striking. He next gives a sampling of partner training, and finally spends the remainder of the time working the sai trainee through the double sai sequence in four sections. Yang and two helpers exhibit each section several times, after which he then expounds and establishes the combative features of each move, normally against a long bo staff.

Sai: Fundamental Training is an efficient DVD training program that is useable at home and in martial arts schools. Watching and following the suggested regimen will give the viewer a good working knowledge for this weapon. I highly recommend the DVD.

My thanks to YMAA for the free copy of Sai: Fundamental Training used for this review and sent at my request. The assessments are mine given without restrictions or requirements (as per Federal Trade Commissions 16 CFR, Part 255).",1456358400,3,1582,4.981060606060606

8742891,5,B018T4A4N6,"Dr. Yang, Jwing -Ming and his son from YMAA delivers again. I practiced with the Sai and Butterfly Swords/Knives when I was younger. However, I departed from my practice due to work and as of late health related issues. I needed a good reminder to kick start me. As a Gung Fu practitioner of  Hung-Gar, White Crane and Tai Tong Long styles I highly recommend this DVD and other YMAA materials.",1515801600,,393,4.535211267605634

8742893,5,B018T4A4N6,"This DVD is really well done. The production is great, tons of content, well organized, with clear explanations. If you are looking at this you probably already know there isn't a huge amount of sai related stuff available in the first place. This was worth the buy even though I'm not studying this particular style.",1494547200,,317,4.781818181818182
8742894,5,B018T4A4N6,"This is an excellent martial arts weapon instructional video on the Sai.  Though it is presented from a chinese martial arts point of view it will be of great interest to Sai practitioners of any style.  The topics covered are: 1. Intro  2. History & Principles (by Dr. J-M. Yang)  3. Solo Training  4. Blocking  5. Striking  6. Partner Training.  All the techniques are clearly demonstrated and explained and make for easy learning.  Applications of many of the techniques are included as well as a number of Partner Training drills, Sequence.  At the end a lengthy practice Sequence is presented movement by movement with explanations and applications.  Another outstanding YMAA DVD - Highly recommended for any martial artist.",1485993600,,729,5.093220338983051
8742895,5,B018T4A4N6,Definately the son of a true master. A master himself. True art in rare form. This needs to be recognized for the discipline that it takes to perform this work of art.,1472860800,,167,4.25
8742896,5,B018T4A4N6,Learning about this curious weapon has been awesome. Nicholas gives clear and concise information and instruction. I am definitely watching it again.,1461196800,,149,5.818181818181818
8742897,5,B018T4A4N6,"I had heard about the plans to produce this DVD two years before it was released and I was very excited to learn in the summer of 2015 that it was to become available at the beginning of 2016. I have always been very intrigued by the weapons DVD's that YMAA Publication Center produce. While most martial arts weapons may not be practical for use in combat today, training with them adds an authentic feel to the styles you are practising. The weapon taught in this DVD comes from Dr Yang Jwing-Ming's White Crane style. Also as they state in the DVD summary 'The skills acquired from sai training can easily be applied to other activities that require finely-tuned motor skills, from daily tasks to the use of other weapons.'

As with all the DVD's that they produce, it is well structured and contains the same important features such as; History on the weapon and sequence, basic drills and techniques, the sequence being broken down into four parts and demonstrated at both slow and regular/fast speeds, as well as martial applications. Nicholas Yang provides in-depth explanations into the theory behind every movement, so that the learner can understand important factors such as power manifestation and how to avoid developing bad habits that would hinder their form and technique.

This is a must buy for any martial arts enthusiast, you will NOT be disappointed!",1458864000,,1371,4.879828326180258
8742898,5,B018T4A4N6,"Excellent introductory information regarding this weapon, followed by comprehensive training on usage of the Sai baton weapon - shown in both slow and full speed.  A great dvd",1458432000,,175,5.25
8742899,5,B018T4A4N6,Fascinating!!! I watched the DVD three times. It explained the history of the SAI weapon and its uses. It shows how to use the SAI in solo training in blocking and striking and partner training in long and short weapons. There are four sections of Sequence in slow and regular speed with explanations and applications. The SAI is not a toy. It can inflict harm to both opponent and user if not properly trained in its use. I applaud Nicholas C. Yang in his very clear and concise instructions on the proper handling of the SAI weapon. I am inspired to learn how to train and use the SAI and integrate it in my daily Tai Chi practice.,1458432000,,633,4.372881355932203
