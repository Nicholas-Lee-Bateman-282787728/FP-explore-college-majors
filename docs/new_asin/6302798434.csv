515921,5,6302798434,"""I'm No Angel"" is widely considered to be the film which saved Paramount Pictures from bankruptcy;it also contains hilarious double ententres written by that great shady lady of the screen - Mae West. From  beginning to end, this movie is a real gem; this was made before the  censors made her ""tone done"" her ribald style which most of the  public loved  and couldn't get enough of. Miss West was forty, fat and  feisty; she was a cinema original the likes of which the public had never  seen before (or since)-she made prudes blush,and prissy women  giggle at  the same time. Here she plays carny gal Tira, who, for a healthy hunk of  change, actually gets into a cage and puts her pretty little head into a  lion's mouth! Tira camps it up with her plump black maids and says to one  ""Beaulah,peel me a grape"",a line which spoofs everything. Catch  her scene with the lady-like Gertrude Michael-it's a riot- as is the  courtroom scene where she puts every man in his place and wins the  admiration of the judge. The29 year- old Cary Grant is ONE of her many love  interests  and he's the guy she ends up with. Recommended viewing for young  and old alike;Mae was liberated and saucy,but she always had a heart of  gold and there's nothing truly offensive about her famous wisecracks;she  made fun of sex and in 1933 the movies grew up a little- in 1999 she's  still fascinating to watch!",944179200,29,1389,4.5465587044534415
515922,5,6302798434,"This movie is a riot. Strictly a vehicle for star West, it has some of her bawdiest, fruitiest lines. This film is a real gem because it only one of three (the others being SHE DONE HIM WRONG &  NIGHT AFTER NIGHT) of West's movies where she has a free rein over her lines (the censors thought her next film, which was intially entitled IT AIN'T NO SIN was indeed and they  changed the title to BELLE OF THE NINETIES after whitewashing the script.) Her character, Tira, is a carny gal who's been around and then some. She gets involved with a very young Cary Grant - and there are the predictible mishaps.  Highlight of the film is Mae's courtroom plea.  This is arguably West's best film and usually credited from saving Paramount from bankruptcy along with her first 1933 feature, the smash-hit SHE DONE HIM WRONG.",943833600,3,815,4.523809523809524

515986,4,6302798434,"Mae West and Cary Grant starred in I'm No Angel, an excellent comedy from the early 1930s that shines even though the Hayes production code watered it down a little. The plot moves along at a very good clip; and West, who wrote the screenplay, gets in plenty of innuendos, double entendres and wisecracks all along the way. Unfortunately, there is one problem: even though the movie itself is wonderful, the quality of the print is not the best; hence four and one-half stars instead of five. Try getting this on a DVD that is not manufactured privately.

The action begins at a local circus where Tira (Mae West) does her nightly song and dance number to the delight of many men. What most people don't know is that Tira and her not so charming buddy Slick Wiley (Ralf Harolde) ""take a little off the top"" from men Tira romances as she and Slick steal from them. One night one of Tira's ""social encounters"" goes horribly bad when the guy she's ""romancing"" gets hit by Slick; and after Slick gets sent to jail Tira needs money fast to get herself a good lawyer to avoid jail herself.

In order to get the cash she needs, Tira caves in to the demands of the circus owner: she must put her head into the jaws of a lion. (Mae West did this stunt herself!) In exchange for this stunt the circus manager gives her plenty of cash--and she gets to know a man who really likes her as he lavishes her with gifts, Kirk Lawrence (Kent Taylor).

Well, Kirk's fianc&eacute;e doesn't like Tira at all after that; but it takes Kirk's friend Jack Clayton (Cary Grant) to convince Kirk to stay with his fianc&eacute;e. When Jack visits Tira in her new swanky apartment provided to her by Kirk, the romantic sparks in the plot REALLY begin to fly.

Of course, what happens could surprise you. No spoilers here--watch the movie to find out!

This film was not only written by Mae West, she warbles her way through two or three songs as well. The scenes in the lion cage reflect great choreography. The cinematography is excellent--in real life Cary Grant and Mae West detested each other so their ""love scenes"" were filmed with only one actor, one day at a time and then spliced together to make it look as if they were in the scenes together. That's pretty good for a film from 1933!

Overall, this film provided Mae West with an excellent vehicle for her classic red hot mama act; and she gives an excellent performance. Although the film belongs to West, the other actors and actresses do a fine job and they also support West very well.

I highly recommend this film for Mae West fans and people who enjoy fast paced comedy flicks from the early 1930s. Cary Grant fans will like I'm No Angel as well.",1346025600,,2685,4.478527607361963

515990,4,6302798434,"The legend of Mae West was well and truly sealed when she wrote and starred in 1933's I'M NO ANGEL.  Most fans will single out this as her greatest movie, and I wholeheartedly agree.

West plays Tira, a carnival dancer/lion tamer, who makes a very profitible sub-career out of charming older men and reaping the rewards of their large fortunes.  That all changes when she meets Jack Clayton (Cary Grant), a millionaire who actually wants to marry her!

I'M NO ANGEL introduced many of Mae West's classic quotes; and is filled with great sequences, including the court case where Tira is confronted by almost every man from her past!  Despite a very large supporting cast (Gregory Ratoff, Edward Arnold, Gertrude Michael, Ralf Harolde, Gertrude Howard, Libby Taylor), this is TOTALLY Mae's show, and the audience is never allowed to forget it.

Cary Grant adds a lot of charm to the story; Mae West hated working with leading men who were attractive and made no secret of her dislike for Grant.  Apparently the feeling was mutual and Cary Grant refused to work with her ever again.  Following I'M NO ANGEL, the male leads in West's movies were always incidental and played by older character actors.  Despite their personal feud, the chemistry between West and Grant is palpable.

I'M NO ANGEL remains a sparkling, fast-paced romantic comedy from Hollywood's pre-code days; the perfect entertainment for a lazy weekend afternoon.",1190073600,4,1428,4.987341772151899

515992,3,6302798434,"I've read many wonderful things about this movie, and it certainly is an important one in the history of Mae West's career because it is a film adaptation of her scandalous theatrical show called Sex. However, I found it to be quite dull.

Basically what we have here is a study about a woman who enjoys the company of men and who gets tired of them as quickly as she falls for them. One day, a special man rolls along (Cary Grant) and she wants to become a one man woman. This does not happen, though, until about halfway through the film.

Perhaps the code helped West more than it hurt her. When it was put into effect, she had to censor herself more, forcing her to limit the amount of inuendo used and to create a solid storyline. The lack of any real direction makes the movie more of a curiosity than an endurable classic. There is no refuting West's talent with words and her obvious sexuality, but you CAN have too much of a good thing, and this is a perfect example.",1168041600,,976,4.298913043478261

516004,4,6302798434,"Tira (Mae West) is a gold-digging circus performer who reluctantly agrees to a dangerous lion-taming act to get herself out of a jam. The act is a great success, making Tira the talk of the town. Her flashy show at Madison Square Garden catches the eye of a wealthy businessman named Kirk Lawrence (Kent Taylor), who becomes infatuated with Tira and lavishes her with expensive gifts. Concerned for Kirk's social situation, his cousin and business partner, Jack Clayton (Cary Grant), attempts to convince Tira to reconsider their relationship. She does, and falls head over heels for Jack. But just as it looks like Jack and Tira will live happily ever after, Jack breaks off the relationship. A heartbroken but still stubborn Tira decides to sue him for breach of promise.

1933's ""I'm No Angel"" was Mae West's second starring role on the silver screen. After her previous film, ""She Done Him Wrong"", saved Paramount Pictures from financial ruin, the studio gave her carte blanche to do whatever she liked on this one. ""I'm No Angel"" was written entirely by Mae West. It's a romantic comedy, but West's character is not a romantic. Tira is nothing if not practical in her relationships with men. And there is no mistaking that the film exists entirely to showcase Ms. West's oversized personality and eye-catching figure. This is Self promotion and Star vehicle with capital S's. Mae West was 40 years old and a tad chunky when she made this film. But she didn't hesitate to cast herself as a sex goddess whom men of all ages found irresistible. And she gets away with it by sheer force of personality. West deserves a lot of credit for making audiences root for a union between a trash-talking middle-aged strumpet and a 29-year old gentleman of means. Such a relationship wouldn't gain approval in real life in 1933, and it wouldn't now. The success of ""I'm No Angel"", then and now, is testament to its star's great charisma. Cary Grant is more handsome than he would be during his years of star status, and surprisingly thinner. I don't think any actor could hope to share a scene with West without being upstaged by her, but Grant does a nice job of making Jack Clayton sympathetic, especially during the trial scenes. ""I'm No Angel"" is sometimes absurdly contrived, but that's the nature of romantic comedy. No bigger personality than Mae West ever graced the screen, and it's her presence that makes this film worthwhile. The DVD has no menu, only scene selections. And the movie begins as soon as the disc is inserted into the player.",1075766400,8,2542,4.790432801822323
516005,5,6302798434,"Mae West basically saved Paramount Pictures from bankruptcy with this and her other hit film of 1933 ""She Done Him Wrong"" (her other career highlight, also with Cary Grant). She was 40 when she made this film, and even for the early 30s she was plumper than the female ideal, and her face was wide and her nose was too long. But since she acted like she was the sexiest thing who ever was, and told you so too, you believed her: her uncontrollable sex appeal was her costant running joke and it never ever palled. Here she's Tira the lion tamer, who tames the richest men in New York society with equal ease: when Cary Grant withdraws his engagement she sues him for breach of promise, and she has great fun cross-examining the witnesses in her trial. Years before Lucille Ball or Carol Burnett, Mae West proved the old sexist canard that ""female isn't funny"" is an out and out lie. Who could be funnier than she is, sashaying around with her African-American maids delivering her ripest lines?",1069459200,4,994,4.558659217877095
516006,4,6302798434,"Decades before the women's movement was to gain momentum in this country, Mae West, with her inimitable combination of feminine wiles and macho, and a keen wit thrown into the mix, began her own revolution by standing all previous conceptions about women and their societal roles on their ear.  Her substantial talent in singing, acting and one-liners give her the wherewithal to have the whole act succeed where many others' attempts would not.  The result is great entertainment, a hallmark in the history of American cinema, and an impression on the audience that we were all better off for this woman having graced our culture.",1065744000,3,631,5.0
516007,5,6302798434,"It's hard to believe they let this go out of print. It's one of Mae West's brightest and funniest films.  Before the censorship czars got after her, that is.  Legendary Mae struts and sings her way through this tale of circus hootchie Tira who gets in a legal jam thanks to her hoodlum boyfriend. Needing fast cash for an attorney, she reluctantly agrees to be the show's lion tamer and put her head in a lion's mouth. She becomes an immediate star and rises to the top. She hooks a rich beau (Kent Taylor) but falls for his business partner Kirk (Cary Grant) and they become engaged to marry. But her old circus cronies won't let her retire and try to frame her in a scandal to break up the engagement. When the ruse works and Kirk breaks off with Tira, she takes him to court for breach of promise. ""I'm No Angel"" is all Mae. From the screenplay (which she wrote) to the gowns (which are knockouts---especially the ""spider web"" gown) she's the star and dominates every scene she's in. She's absolutely wonderful. From strutting around and singing with her maids to taking over her own case in the courtroom, you can see there was no one like her and never would be. She was totally unique and unequaled in terms of sheer star power. Some of her racy quotes are here in ""I'm No Angel"" but, alas, the better ones lie in ""She Done Him Wrong"" (also with Grant) and that one never made it to DVD. These two are the better of her films---""My Little Chickadee"" with W.C.Fields notwithstanding---and it's a shame they're not in print. The Universal DVD of ""Angel"" looks good and is a collector's item now. But I'm for re-releasing ALL of her films on DVD. As I'm sure she would love to know, Mae West still has an audience and always will.",1064707200,10,1733,4.429467084639499
516008,5,6302798434,"Mae West is outrageously funny as ""Tira"" the lion tamer, a woman supposed to be completely irresistible to all men. Her smart wisecracks, full of double-entendres were her trademark, and here they're at full display, just before the Production Code's censorship toned down her lines, which were written by herself.
Her hip-swaying, her moans and fluttering eyelashes, etc., are a joy to behold...her lines, spoken with her woman-of-the-world-reassuredness are top-notch. Her scenes with her maids are especially funny, because they're full of non-stop wisecracks about us men. A must!!
A very young Cary Grant plays the object of Mae's affections and Edward Arnold is the circus owner and  Mae's employer.

516009,5,6302798434,"Mae West was an unlikely sex symbol.  She was a small woman with a face that defied most standards of beauty and an unremarkable body--and by the time she hit film she was edging into middle age.  But as West herself might have said, it ain't what ya got, its what ya do with it. If anybody knew what to do with it, Mae West certainly did, and I'M NO ANGEL finds her doing it in remarkably fine style indeed.
The story and script, by West herself, is hilariously improbable.  West stars as Tira, a carny entertainer who divides her work between a hootchie coochie act (which gives her the opportunity to perform a sizzling ""They Call Me Sister Honky Tonk"") and a lion taming act--but when she runs afoul of a small town romeo she hits the road for New York, where she captivates both city and Cary Grant with her circus act.  Needless to say, there are comic complications galore, but like the Mounties, Mae West always gets her man.
West did a number of justly famous films during the 1930s, but I'M NO ANGEL is arguably her best, salted with with one memorable quip after another as she cracks whips, snubs snobs, frolicks with her maids (""Peel me a grape!""), and waylays the willing Cary Grant with considerable aplomb.

516012,5,6302798434,"Mae West was purportedly quoted as saying, ""I fear no man"". Whether she actually did, I have no trouble believing it. In ""I'm No Angel"", Miss West plays ""Tira"", a carnival hootch dancer who becomes a lion-taming headliner in ""The Big Time"", and has numerous men orbiting her, like moons around Venus. She is a women completely at ease with herself, fears no one, makes no apologies, and the men love her for it, in spite of themselves. Miss West played, essentially, the same role in real life, the ""Bad but not Evil"" woman. No beating around the bush for Mae-she told you who she was, what she wanted, take her or leave her-and made you laugh!  She was ""Women's Lib"" in flashy gowns, big hats, and lots of diamonds. There are many of West's famous lines in ""I'm No Angel"", such as ""When I'm good, I'm very, very good, but when I'm bad, I'm better"", ""Beulah, peel me a grape!"", and many more. Her co-star is screen legend Cary Grant, whom Mae selected for 2 of her films on sight. The first was ""She Done Him Wrong"", and then this one. She said, ""He was so good I had him twice-in pictures, I mean."" The lady was an original. She was not ""beautiful"" or slender, but men were drawn to her (her brains being her sexiest feature), progressive (she defended homosexuals long before Stonewall), had interracial friendships and romances (she had lovers of African descent, as well as having black performers in her films), and was still attracting men well into her 70s! She also wrote her own material. So, if you're feeling a bit adventurous, go West, because ""You can be had!""",981504000,11,1573,4.538732394366197

For the rest of her (brief) film career, she  alternated melodramas with farces; this and ""Goin' to Town"" are  the best of the comedies. Cary Grant seems much more at ease than he did in  ""She Done Him Wrong"" -- he's still not the polished farceur he  would become, but he manages to hold his own with her... no small  achievement. This movie features more classic one-liners than seems  possible; my own favorite is this little exchange:

I couldn't help myself thinking how much Rodney Dangerfield's style--also aggravating--resembled that of Mae West.  Was Dangerfield deliberately mimicking Mae for laughs?

7831747,4,6302798434,"""I'm No Angel"", along with her first starring feature, the classic ""She Done Him Wrong"" (1933) is often considered to be one of Mae West's best features. Whether this is true or not, it does contain some of her wittiest and funniest dialogue.

West plays Tira, a circus performer who hits the big time as a lion tamer. Her fame and prestige catches the eye of several male suitors. One of them is the dashing Jack Clayton (Cary Grant) who is clearly smitten and proposes marriage. Wanting to settle down with Clayton, Tira decides she wants to quit her circus act but her shady manager  and business partner, Big Bill Barton (Edward Arnold), who is making a fortune off of her show, concocts a scheme to keep her in the show but it ultimately destroys her relationship. The last quarter of the film is a hilarious court room scene which is probably one of the funniest court cases ever seen on film.

Much has been said about this charming early 30's comedy. As mentioned, it contains some of West's wittiest dialogue and she delivers them fast and furious. Many of her most famous lines are featured here including ""When I'm good I'm very good but when I'm bad, I'm better"" and ""It's not the men in your life that count, it's the life in your men"". Another note-worthy piece of talk that again, showcases her incredible wit is when she is asked by her shady Manager (after Tira got herself in a bit of trouble) ""How are you mixed up in all of this?"" Tira's response: ""Like an olive in a dry martini."" The woman was a hoot however she was also her own worst enemy. West's ego stroking is at it's zenith in this film which is also my main complaint. Despite the bawdy humour and hysterical dialogue, there is too much of Mae and far too much swooning over her and her physical appeal. A bit less would have worked better especially considering that Hollywood's other more conventional bombshells, Harlow, Monroe, Welch, Hayworth etc, hardly had this many men salivating over them in one 90 minute feature. We get it, Tira, as written, is a bewitching temptress, but the audience doesn't need reminding every 5 minutes on how irresistible she is since it becomes a bit tiresome and the standard then becomes too impossibly high to meet with only a few women being able to meet or exceed it. Still, this is a funny movie that showcases the wit, wisdom and enduring personality of one of the most legendary comedienne's of the silver screen. Although I still crown ""She Done Him Wrong"" as her absolute best, this one comes mighty close in matching that brilliance. They don't make movies or stars like this any more and this comes highly recommended.
