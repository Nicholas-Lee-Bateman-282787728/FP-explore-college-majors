8320107,4,B001LX4BWI,"This time period was a tumultuous one, wherein England's crown was fought over, stolen and betrayed multiple times. In this DVD, the narrator, Brian Blessed, takes the viewer through this time when the houses of Lancaster and York - and their respective roses - fought for control of the realm.

I thought the video did a decent job of showing the utterly confusing and tangled web of loyalties and alliances as well as could be done in a video of this length. There was a fairly good chronicle of the course of events, the main players, the changes in the balance of power, the battles and the fates of kings and queens.

I would have liked to have seen more in-depth treatments of the battles and better 3-D maps, but a fairly good treatment of the subject.",1479600000,,759,4.532846715328467

8320110,3,B001LX4BWI,It's just ok. Informative but the production values are 30 years old or more. This subject really needs a upgraded video.,1382227200,,121,4.809523809523809
