8454621,5,B0052WNHEM,"I am slightly biased as I adore Metzger's uvre  (and that of Henry Paris too -  Radley's nome-de-porne) but this takes him to a new level! Alongside Mac Ahlberg, and the masterful Joe Sarno, Metzger made the most gorgeous erotic films ever! If you enjoy beautiful looking films, if you have a penchant for the psychedelic epoch, and you prefer slower editing - so you can gaze freely -  and ornately constructed sets, and oodles of sexiness, well then, you might well have found your fountain of joy!",1490486400,,500,4.659090909090909
8454622,5,B0052WNHEM,"Score - This is a very interesting film! I was captivated with it the very first time I saw it, and it was even inspirational to me. Score's main characters are Jack and Elvira. They are married and bisexual swingers in a swanky fashion. They play a game of seduction in which each takes a turn trying to seduce someone of the same sex. This time it's Elvira's turn, and her target is a younger, married girl named Betsy. Elvira seems to be having some trouble getting Betsy in the sack, and her time limit is quickly approaching. Jack seems to take an interest in Betsy's husband, Eddie, as Elvira continues to attempt to seduce Betsy.

""Score"" is an adult comedy/drama, and the sex scenes are interestingly crafted. The film is full of tacky charms, witty lines, and memorable images. It's a great reflection of the swingin' 70's, and the sexual revolution. I think ""Score"" deserves repeated viewings.

THE LICKERISH QUARTET - During the 1970s, many art and soft-core porn hybrids were released. Probably the most famous (and certainly best) one was ""Last Tango in Paris"", but that was more towards the art side of the spectrum. One that found a comfortable middle ground was Radley Metzger's ""The Lickerish Quartet"". My only previous experience with Metzger was his hardcore feature ""The Opening of Misty Beethoven"", but after seeing both of these, its obvious the man was very intelligent and had more ambition than your average skin salesman. ""The Lickerish Quartet"" in particular adventurously toys with the concept of meta-fiction, and blurs the line between reality and fantasy. It is, along with ""The Stunt Man"" and ""8 1/2"", one of the few films which manages to pull off film within a film and avoid seeming gimmicky. Sure, it does have some of the excess of the era and may come across as being pretentious to some, but there are genuinely fascinating ideas here.

Another reason why the film works is the technical skill invested. Radley Metzger shows he had genuine directing talent and probably could've crossed over to the mainstream. ""The Lickerish Quartet"" would've probably been more renowned if it wasn't for the soft-core porn trap. There are several tracking shots here which are absolutely brilliant. Seriously, just about every frame in the film is mind blowing. The acting is very good all around as well. Silvana Venturelli manages to find the right blend between sexiness and mysteriousness and manage to be seductive all the time. Spaghetti western vet Frank Wolff (""Once Upon a Time in the West"") does a fine job as a dissatisfied and aging wealthy man. Erika Remberg and Paolo Turco are also quite good as the mother and son. ""The Lickerish Quartet"" is seriously near a masterpiece.

CAMILLE 2000 - This is a superb film, witty, stylish, and beautifully conceived and executed. One of the things I love most about Metzger's work is the way he takes classic literature--in this case Dumas' ""The Lady of the Camellias""-- and reworks them for a modern audience. Earlier renditions of this story--such as Cukor's 1936 film starring Greta Garbo, ""La Traviata,"" and seven silent movie versions--were unable to depict the life of a courtesan with such frankness, showing what is after all one of the main aspects of a courtesan's life: her moments in the bedroom. The film, while intensely erotic, is also very much about love. The lovers want to look at one another and experience moments of wonderment at the sheer existence of the other more than they want to do bedroom antics. They are young and beautiful, and their beauty as well as her illness makes us feel achingly the fleetingness of love and youth. Moreover, the joy of youth and the erotic play out in every aspect of the film. The stylish sets and costumes, the lush party scenes, and the sensual music depict a world of pleasure-loving children who never want to grow up, but want to continue enveloping themselves in brightly-colored adult playgrounds full of sensory stimulation. The stigma normally associated with a courtesan is stripped away in this world of pleasure, in which life lived to its fullest is the ultimate goal, and an early death is a small price to pay. In this sense the parallel to some of the concerns of the swinging sixties is brilliantly captured. A 1969 review from Roger Ebert disappointingly puts down this movie, and yet Ebert's own script for ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" is no more than a crass joke, with no feeling for the humanity of its characters or for the dignity of love, sex, or even life. He ridicules the moment when Camille is breathing heavily, not understanding that the depiction of female pleasure on the screen was so necessary to our understanding of the heroine's journey.",1420070400,,4715,4.853416149068323
