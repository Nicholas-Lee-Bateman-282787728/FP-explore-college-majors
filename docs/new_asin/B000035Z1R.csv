1258401,5,B000035Z1R,"I am a HUGE Buffy fan. I own Season I & now i'm dieing to collected all the seasons. Season 2 brings Buffy & Angel to a stand still when her love lifts the curse and Angel returns to his evil ways. Season 2 In my opinion tops the first. Seth Green's charicter Oz is introduced, and a main charicter meets her end at the hands of Angel. I will pre order this DVD pack as soon as possible.",1014768000,8,387,3.911392405063291
1258402,5,B000035Z1R,"This tape offers up a pair of emotional episodes from the second season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""  In ""Passions"" Angelus provides Giles and the rest of the gang with chilling proof of why he was the most vicious vampire of his day.  Even after Angelus' shocking murder of Jenny there are two unforgettable scenes: the first when Giles comes home and finds Jenny's corpse in his bed and the second when Buffy confronts the grief stricken Giles.  Then in ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" we get to see how good former Emmy Award winner Sarah Michelle Gellar and relative neophyte David Boreanaz are as actors.  Buffy and Angelus are possessed by the restless ghosts of a male student and the female teacher he loved.  But the twist is that the genders flip when the unhappy lovers take possession of Buffy and Angel.  One of the best acting moments in the entire series, all setting the stage for the shattering two-part finale of ""Becoming.""",1003622400,,939,4.66060606060606
1258403,5,B000035Z1R,"Of the three tapes in this boxed set from the second season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, this is certainly the weakest of the three, but that is only because Volume 1 offers the ""Surprise"" and ""Innocence"" episodes where Angel turns into Angelus after making love to Buffy and Volume 3 offers the two-parter ""Becoming"" finale.  Given that this particular collection specifically focuses on the Buffy-Angel relationship rather than being simply the best episodes from that second season, the pair of episodes on this tape are the perfect choices.
Of the six other episodes featuring Angelus, Whedon picked the perfect two to bridge the beginning and end of this epic: ""Passion,"" with the brutal death of Jenny Calendar offers a pair of emotional scenes, first when Giles discovers Jenny's body in his bed and when an agonized Buffy angrily confronts Giles about his reckless attack on Angelus.  ""I Only Have Eyes for You"" finds Buffy and Angel caught up in the lives (and deaths) of another pair of star crossed lovers, and offers a painful reminder of the feelings they had for each other before things went so horribly wrong.
Because these two episodes make sense only in the context of the return and departure of Angelus, there is little reason to have this particular tape without the rest of the set.  This collection perfectly captures the whole Angel/Angelus story arc.  Furthermore, ""Becoming, Part 2"" is one of the 10 best television episodes I have ever seen in my entire life (and I watch a LOT of television).",971136000,4,1520,4.87984496124031
1258404,5,B000035Z1R,"I was so happy when my Buffy and Angel Gift Pack arrived- three cassettes!  Since I'd only read BTVS books and none of the episodes (no cable), my  expectations for these 6 episodes were quite high. Now, all I have to say  is: It was everything I hoped it would be and more.
The Second Volume  contains `Passion' and `I only have eyes for you', and is light- medium  blue in colour.
In `Passion', Angel has lost his soul, but has gained an  obsession: terrorizing Buffy. When she learns he has been sneaking into her  home and the homes of her friends, she sends Giles to Jenny Calendar for  help. Perhaps Jenny might also restore his soul. But the demonic Angelus  doesn't want his soul back, and making sure Jenny will never cast the spell  falls right in line with his plan to bring Buffy grief.
In `I only have  eyes for you', Buffy stops a bizarre shooting in the school hallway, then  is later momentarily transported back to 1955, when a student in love with  a teacher shot her, then himself. When the school janitor kills a teacher  in exactly the same way. Buffy realizes that people at Sunnydale High are  being forced to reenact that murder. Determined to end the curse, Buffy  lets herself be possessed by the ghost...which unfortunately puts her face to  face with her one true love: Angel.
Vol. 2 isn't as great as Vol. 1 &  3, but helps along the story and adds in those small important details.  You realize that Angel truly has turned evil when he kills Jenny, and that  his cure is lost forever (till Vol. 3, that is). You also see how Buffy has  to come to grips with what has happened and her own inability to forgive  herself.
I still think it's better to get the Gift Pack than the  individual tapes because the experience won't be the same. You're worth it  so don't cut yourself short.",968025600,5,1810,4.4316109422492405

1258406,4,B000035Z1R,"Passion is a truly touching episode which mixes love and evil brilliantly. IOHEFY is not as good and gets bogged down by Buffy's minner demons, that are not fully explained. This video is worth it though for Passion alone.",951868800,,222,4.717948717948718
1258407,5,B000035Z1R,"In these two episodes, Passion and I Only Have Eyes for You (IOHEFY), the true depth of Buffy and Angel's actions are explored In Passion, Angelus strikes out at last at someone near and dear to Buffy. His evil nature  becomes apparent. In IOHEFY, Buffy faces her guilt for the rash actions  that cost Angel his soul through the plight of another pair of star-crossed  lovers, one of whom is haunting the school with a violent passion",948585600,12,434,4.6103896103896105

1258424,5,B000035Z1R,"I received this item quickly and it was packaged well with no damage to it or the container.
I'm a huge, huge, huge Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan. As in, when I'm not feeling good or down in the dumps, my husband knows to just put Buffy on and leave me to wallow. I'll eventually emerge feeling much better.
I'm not sure what happened to the VHS tapes I used to have, but they've managed to go missing long ago. Not that it would matter, since they're obsolete. I had always diverted back to Netflix whenever I wanted to watch my favorite show. However, Netflix has a nasty habit of just randomly dropping a title. Because of this, I'm slowly collecting the DVD sets.
I'll eventually buy one of the special edition box sets, but, for now, I'm enjoying these slim sets that I'm slowly picking up season by season. I like them because they take up little room and fit nicely on my shelf with our other movies and games.

1258450,5,B000035Z1R,"The second season of Buffy is a fantastic turnaround from the first. While the first season has a lot of fun, it was really there to introduce the idea of the world, and lay out the basic groundwork for all the characters. In the second season, we see the world expand out from Sunnydale a lot more, see the characters develop personalities to make them more relatable, and get a glimpse of something a bit darker that's coming down the pipe. While having these serious elements, we maintain some of the humor that we enjoyed in the first season, while refining its whimsy into something that you can enjoy as a moody teenager, or as an adult.

*Bonus* For those who are watching the entire season, you may notice references to things that will happen in later season as well!",1454371200,2,776,4.542857142857143

I love the humor, dark as it tends to be, I love the devotion of the Scoobies, towards each other. I love the relationship between Buffy and Giles. It continues to grow, into an amazing father-daughter duo. Buffy continues to grow, both in maturity, and as the Slayer. The season begins with her returning to Sunnydale, after the summer ends.

This story is everything Twilight wishes it could be: smart, sexy, epically poignant. This is the best season of the show for its story arc and acting. Other reviews provide details of individual episodes so I'll skip that and just say that if you can get past the show's admittedly cheesy (but appropriate) title you will be rewarded with one of the best stories ever written for TV.",1447372800,,544,4.618556701030927

The firsts eason was ecxately the ''School of terror'' from episode three to eleven there were several episodes each one with a different texture,then at the end of the first season ''Prophecy Girl'' The profechy that said that Buffy had to face the Master was not true in fact after she went to confront him he told himself,in the end Buffy close the hell mouth and kill the master then when all it's over the gang decides to go to a party in the bronze,but we understand that when Buffy goes away from the skeleton of the Master she gives him one last look like she's forgotten to do something.
And this was a little spoiler,in the second season epsiode one Buffy behavior was very strange she wasn't Buffy anymore it's like she become Master shadow.
In the same epsiode Buffy went to the Bonze and met Angel but he spoke with him rudely also offend him,the she goes to xander and seduce him in a sensual dance,only after buffy understood that the weight of the world was on her shoulder.
The same night she went to save his friends from a ressurection ritual of the master then buffy understood what bothered her so much it wasn't Angel her friends niether but the master,she had to kill himcompletely so nobody will be a slave of his shadow,she take a hammer and threw it violently against his skeleton to riduce it into small pieces",1425686400,,1422,4.536964980544747

Some story-lines could be construed as ""disturbing"" but you're watching a show about vampires and demons, so.... Besides that, there is extremely witty reparte, a few laughs, some surprises, and a whole lot of friendship going on.  You really need to pay attention since the details of the shows are outstanding.

1258810,5,B000035Z1R,"The first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer covered a lot more than most seasons cover within 3 seasons, in my review for season 1 I said it was ""superb"", ""an absolute blast of fun, action, horror, humor, romance, drama, and everything a good show have"", ""great heroes, likable, several great monsters/villains"", and ""this show is not just a vampire show"", all of these things and everything else I previously said is even MORE true to THIS season, season 2 captured what many other shows fail to even consider or grasp, the second season has two sad deaths, many tragedy's, losses, heart aches, people grow, loose loved ones, new friends, get boyfriend's or girlfriend's, and of coarse go through REAL life things, we care about these characters because they are not just characters to us anymore, we share in their experiences and have went through everything they have and do go through. This season showed just how much of an impact our choices can have on ourselves, including other people, and sometimes we have to make hard sacrifices and compromises for the sake of ourselves or others we love. There is more sexual content, nothing that was not necessary by any means, and there is a lot more action violence, all in good PG-13 fashion fun. There are even more awesome and unique monsters, and more strange episodes, like the episode Ted and Bad Eggs are the most bizarre. I cannot recommend this show enough, I HIGHLY, HIGHLY, recommend this show, check it out now!

My favorite episodes of season 2 are:

Becoming: Part II
Innocence
Surprise
Becoming: Part I
Ted

Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 2 ***** out of *****

Violent Content: 3/10 - Strong Stylized Action/Horror Violence.

1258823,4,B000035Z1R,Thi season so far is building on Angels past with new characters Spike and Drusilla. Id forgotten how comedic spike seemed yet the odd and scary Dru that has him mesmerized is really creepy. Theres more of Angel in Buffys life which was my favorite story line. The intro of Oz character is also cool as he seems to enter as a strong character with a similar name to production member i hadnt noticed in past.,1395619200,,408,4.381578947368421

1258830,5,B000035Z1R,"Joss Whedon once said, he would rather make a television show that 100 people must see, rather than one that 1,000 people simply liked.  Buffy the Vampire Slayer is such a show. It's about people, and it uses vampires and monsters as metaphors for things we face in our daily lives. It also uses the flash of action and the bling of absurd plots to entertain while telling tales that have surprising depth and contain far more emotional realism than most of the straight dramas on TV.  But it's not just a drama. Humor bubbles beneath nearly every scene, and Whedon's trademark, brilliant dialog lives throughout.

It also has the peculiar distinction of being a show that everyone who has *never* seen, will line up to tell you how bad it is.

In any event, it is pointless to try to talk anyone into watching it--the title alone polarizes the majority of people into giving it a great, big 'pass'.  Try it. You may like it, you may not, but don't let the silly title keep you from giving it a try.  Also, keep in mind, episodes of this show really aren't 'stand-alone'. The show begins in Season 1 and ends in season 7.

But asked my opinion, it is one of my favorite television shows of all time, and season 2 is one of the three best seasons.",1394064000,,1246,4.414847161572053

Speaking of exhausted, poor Sarah Michelle Geller must have been sick to death of Buffy by the end of the long series. She's in almost every scene  acting the soap opera of teen angst or action hero doing battle with the forces of evil. Thank God I was so busy back in the 1990's that I missed the original broadcasts.

1258915,4,B000035Z1R,"After watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete First Season, I had very lukewarm feelings towards to show. It came off as rather silly for the most part and I had a difficult time keeping my interest in the silly plots and demons. But I had to keep watching from all of the praise I hear this show gets. It has to get better, I would tell myself. And this Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Second Season did get better. A lot better. From the very first episode, the tone is set different. It is very dark and feels a bit more mature and professionally made. While some of the episodes in the first half of this season fall under being much like season 1, the second half is a completely different show.

Buffy the Vampire Slayer - Season 2 is about Buffy's Junior year of high school and most importantly Spike and Drusilla, two very funny and entertaining vampires, taking over Sunnydale! Much to Buffy's dislike, they want to capture her boyfriend Angel. These are two of the best characters this show has ever seen and keep the show rolling with fun and entertainment. I have never enjoyed the dark side so much! Xander and Willow become more interesting with their sprouting love lives, Cordelia and Oz, and Giles even finds love. Buffy continues to be a positive role model for woman and becomes stronger throughout the show. Her love with Angel is an interest and even brilliant aspect of the show. The show really picks up it's pace in the episodes Surprise & Innocence and leads to one of the most amazing episodes of television I have ever seen in my life, Becoming Part 1 & Part 2. Words cannot explain how it falls into place and how emotional the entire ride is. While there might be some silliness to watch in this box set, it is well worth it for the amazement. The highlights are Halloween, Surprise, Innocence, Passion, I Only Have Eyes For You, and Becoming. The weaker episodes consisted of Inca Mummy Girl, Reptile Boy, Bad Eggs, and Go Fish.

This show consists of high school and metaphors for the tough times that take place there but I find it completely intelligent and has elements that both adults and teenagers can enjoy. Much work and creativity is put into this show and it obviously has payed off in the long run. This show is considered a classic and this season is why. While many other seasons may be more consistent than this, they are not as memorable or powerful, at least from my viewpoint. This is Buffy's true high peak and I am glad to have enjoyed watching it. I highly recommend watching this over other high school student shows and honestly, most shows, high school or not.",1373241600,,2632,4.527310924369748
1258916,5,B000035Z1R,Good show.  I like Joss Wedon's story telling.  Also interesting observations on what it's like to be in High School.,1372550400,,117,4.8
1258917,5,B000035Z1R,"Without getting into spoilers, this season is pivotal for many reasons.

First, it builds upon the foundation of the half-as-long season 1, which introduced all of the characters and began to tell the story of Sunnydale. While good, the first season was very short and did not have adequate time to complete its dialogue. Season two helps to get the story more fully fleshed.

Second, it introduces many plot elements and characters, such as the dynamic Spike, and of course the soon-to-be-long-standing relationship of Angel and Buffy, which was only really lightly touched on in the first season.

Third, it serves as a story arc into the future seasons, where Wheadon really got into the ""end every episode with an audible audience gasp moment"" groove. Some of this season's episodes are like that, with a few being truly gut-wrenching.

The only downside, if there really is one, about this season (and series) is that you really need to be there from the beginning. Fortunately, if you're looking at this series then you only need to see season 1 to be all caught up. It's a minor downside though, and common with a lot of non-comedy television series (you could jump into the middle of Will and Grace if you wanted to, but not Lost or Heroes).

I highly recommend this series - for me, my favorite seasons are, in order, 2,3,1,5,4,6,7. And if you get hooked, one warning, you'll want to get into Angel!",1371945600,,1408,4.754098360655738

We learn a little about the watcher and Angel's history. We are taken for a roller coaster ride this season. And it's a good roller coaster ride.

You can actually see what she is going through, and she usually does what is best for everyone else even though it isn't what is best for her. Buffy the Vampire Slayer is not your typical Vampire, Love Struck series, but has it the old fashioned way: have to be asked to come in, burn alive in sunlight, crosses, holy water, stake to the heart, etc. THIS is another reason why it is so great, because it isn't the glittery vampire crap everyone is into today.  You will never guess the outcome of this season, because you can't guess what is going to happen.

Storylines start to evolve along with the standalone episodes, and are edited just right so I can still understand them. The comedy aspect of this show fits right in without neutralizing the horror. There are moments in this show that are pure psychological terror. Its just as supernatural as ""The X-files."" Season 2 has an emotional feel that isn't quite matched in other seasons. I think its like the moon aligning and all the elements that made up the show are here. Of course its cheesy, but its also great. Episodes like Inca Mummy Girl, Halloween, Whats my Line 1 &2, and Ted all cascade into a cool finale. While Season 3 is heavier on drama, new characters, and some of the horror that was in season 2, it just can't touch how actually scary and fun Season 2 was.

There are a zillion and one ""high school student with special powers"" shows out there, most of which are not worth watching, let alone remembering.

1259125,5,B000035Z1R,"This not just the best season of Buffy, I think it's the best season of TV ever produced.  I have never seen a show so capably swoop between the highs and lows of human emotion, while still being humorous, battling monsters and telling allegorical teen stories.  I really don't think there was one bad episode out of the bunch this season and they never stopped surprising me (in a good way).  All teen shows that can't seem to get high school right could learn something from this season of Buffy.

Standout episodes are:  Surprise, Innocence, Passion, Becoming 1 and Becoming 2.  But anything from this year is a must see.

In season two, if Buffy cried, it was for a darn good reason.  Not the case in seasons three and four.  She also knew when to come out swinging instead of tearing up and I felt like her heart was as much in her fists when she had to fight as it was in her eyes when she had emotional moments.  Buffy had heart this season and she was a force of nature before the writers began to diminish her power either because they suddenly decided strong women were bad or to justify making witchy, whiny Willow (who does not become whiny until she becomes a witch, she's still great this season) the center of the show from season four on.

There are not words to describe the perfection of the tragic love story written for Buffy and Angel.  The first half of the season I spent breathlessly waiting for them to hit the sheets, but the second half I often found myself waiting for her to beat the crap out of him.

I enjoyed Willow and Oz.  Also liked the surprise of Xander and Cordelia.  They were a great snarky couple.  Jenny and Giles were fun to watch as he got dating tips from the kids, and finding out Jenny's true purpose was a shocker.

LOVED Spike's alliance with Buffy.  The scenes where he approaches her about it and then meets Joyce were priceless.

Bumbles and fumbles in no particular order:
1.  In Halloween Buffy says Angel was 18 and still human in the 1770s, but in Becoming 1, they show him becoming a vampire in the 1750s which is also inconsistent with his age 241.

2.  If one slayer is born into every generation, Kendra would have to be a baby or not even born yet, but she's Buffy age so they are the same generation making their whole, ""Into every generation a slayer is born..."" a big fat lie.

3.  In School Hard, Spike calls Angel his sire, but in a subsequent season, it's revealed Drusilla sired him.

4.  The spell Willow uses to restore Angel's soul is an approximation of the original gypsy curse, perfect for saying the happiness clause (which was really stupid to build into it in the first place) no longer applies, but the chance is ignored.

5.  This is more season 3, but it starts here, Joyce very forcefully tells her teen daughter in Becoming 2 that if she leaves the house not to bother coming back.  What right does Joyce have, in season 3, to tell Buffy her angry words were Buffy's fault for dropping the slayer bomb on her and that Buffy should have known to ignore them instead of running away? Buffy is a teen, her mom said not to come back, how would you have taken that at 17?

6.  Instead of Xander telling Buffy that Willow was going to try the spell again in Becoming 2, he instead tells her Willow's message is to kick Angel's a**, leaving Buffy to be blindsided by her beloved's good guy turn at the end.  She could have stalled Angel from taking the sword out of Acathla had she known, instead of stalling to put off killing him, or at least been braced for the heart break to come.  Xander betrayed her and the writers ignore it until the final season because, in spite of fan comments that we saw it as a betrayal, they refused to admit it was until then.  Xander was a jealous Angel hater who saw a chance to get him gone and took it at Buffy's expense, any later anger he had because she grew jaded over life's miseries (and they do make her life miserable) is partially his fault with this one sentence.

As you can tell, I was bitterly disappointed with what came after for all the characters in seasons 3-7.  I'm not sure if the writers realized they couldn't live up to this season and didn't bother to try or if this season made them think every idea they had was perfection so they went with it, ignoring fan response.  Either way it goes downhill fast after this.  Seasons 5 and 6 sucked big time.

My advice would be to finish high school with Buffy in season three because although three is annoying given Buffy's doormat turn with her friends, Scott and Faith, it draws a close to the school years which is where Buffy did its best work and decide what came next for yourself.

To the really brave I would say watch seasons one and two and make up your own ending.  As devoted to this show as I was after season two, never knowing that Angel would be written out, Buffy diminished and turned into a single mom to an obnoxious pointless fake sister who whines and mopes, Spike a joke, Xander superfluous, Giles mia and Willow turned into a harpy; it would have been hard to have convinced me at the time to take my own advice and stop here.  But in hindsight, I wish I didn't know what the writers did to all the characters I loved to make a mockery of the people they created in this, Buffy's finest season.

Watch this season, enjoy it and either skip the rest.",1303344000,,5354,4.34944612286002

The writing was cleaner, the visuals were more impressive and the characters came more into focus. As we fall more and more in love with Buffy and watch her trials and tribulations, characters like Xander, and especially Willow become so endearing and near to our hearts that you feel they are almost real. This is also the season that Buffy's love affair with Angel becomes ultra hot and heav. Then we meet Spike -- My favorite baddy of all time!!!! Listen closley to what Spike says in the episode ""School Hard"" when he referes to his relationship with Angel, because it is completley wrong, and the writers did not correct it till later once Drusilla's orgin was connected with Spike's. James Marster's Spike character was only supposed to be around for one or two episodes and then die, but he became an immediate hit so they left him on the series, hence the writers going back to correct the flub. You gotta love Josh for letting the mistake stand, he could have re edited the scene or did a voice over, but he left it just the way it was, worts and all. Get season 2, its classic, and to me, marked its territory as hands down the best show on TV, despite the emmy nominating committees suggesting otherwise.

1259167,5,B000035Z1R,"If I could only own one season of buffy it would be this one. The second season is actually what drew me in because it's amazing, the rest of the series is great too but this season is just the best. There's everything you could want, romance, hot guys, funny moments, angst, action, kinda scary moments, and something only Joss Whedon does that I just can't name. I would say what it's about but plenty of other reviews plus the summary already tell you. I just want to add another 5 star review because this season deserves it.",1255996800,2,529,4.408163265306122
1259168,5,B000035Z1R,"And I really mean that.  This is by far my favorite season of Buffy.  This season opens up with a bang.  (This review will contain many spoilers).  The first episode, ""When she was bad"", is one of my favorite episodes in the whole series.  Buffy comes back from summer vacation acting very different.  She is very moody, and is acting very wild.  Her friends assume she is possessed by some sort of demon.  It turns out that she is just in a deep depression from her death at the end of the previous season.  The episode ""School Hard"" introduces Spike, the villain for the first half of the season, who is also one of the best fictional characters of all time as far as I'm concerned.  ""Halloween"" and ""Lie to me"" were two other great episodes, the first for its exceptional comedy, the second for its excellent drama.  The two-part episode ""What's my Line"" was not one of my favorite episodes, but a scene from it caused me to laugh out loud at this show for the first time, the scene where Xander and Cordelia start making out.  Their whole relationship was funny.  Some people didn't think it worked, but I thought it was great.  However, the downside of this episode is the character Kendra.  She was way too wooden, and her accent was horrible.  The two episodes ""Surprise"" and ""Innocence"" chronicled Angel's loss of his soul and his return to being a vicious killer.  I have to say, Angelus is definitely my favorite villain in the whole series, possibly one of the best TV villains of all time.  In ""Becoming"", the two-part season finale, Buffy loses everything.  Her friend Kendra is murdered, she is wanted by the police for said murder, she is expelled from school, and her mother kicks her out of the house.  She has to stop Angel from awakening a demon that will swallow the world.  She sacrifices him to save the world, after his soul has been restored by Willow.  That scene almost brought me to tears.  And I'm a guy.  A macho guy.  And I knew he had his own spin-off series lined up, but still.  Buffy then leaves Sunnydale to get away from her calling as a slayer.

 This was a huge improvement over the first season.  If you read my review of season 1, you know I had some problems with it.  The acting, the effects and makeup, and the actions scenes were not very good.  They weren't horrible, but they weren't great either.  The acting is much better this time around.  Anthony Head is brilliant as usual, but Willow, Xander, and Angel's acting has improved a lot.  Even Buffy, who ironically is not one of my favorite characters, does a pretty good job.  The romance between her and Angel is pretty believable.  Contrast that with the relationship between Xander and Cordelaia.  Their relationship was funny and enjoyable to watch, but it was not very realistic.  Someone as superficial as Cordelia would never have publicly dated Xander.  But hey, it's a TV show, not real life. The action scenes are not very well-choreographed in the first few episodes, but they get better as the season progresses.  By the second half of the season, they are great.  The final fight between Buffy and Angelus (a sword fight) was very entertaining.  Everything about this season was almost perfect.  There were a few cheesy episodes, such as ""Some Assembly Required"", ""Inca Mummy Girl"", and ""Go Fish"", but, you know, nothing's without a few flaws.  Overall, this was a very good season.  If you have never seen it, or if you have seen it but just want to own it, buy this DVD.",1255392000,3,3484,4.575364667747164

Spike and Drusilla revel in Angel's new persona and help him try to destroy Buffy and the world. The dialogue once again is funny, witty and clever. All the characters get fleshed out and grow even more in the second season. Willow gives up her crush on Xander and starts dating a really cool werewolf named Oz; Xander starts a secret romance with prissy and popular Cordelia Chase; Buffy's mom finally finds out she's the Slayer; even Spike grows in his first season when he gives up world destruction to be with Drusilla.

1259205,5,B000035Z1R,"Buffy The Vampire Slayer Season 2 was a giant improvement over the average Season 1.  There are two main reasons it was tons better then Season 1.  One was the amazing plot Arc that concerned Buffy's realtionship with Angel.  This is truly the greatest relaionship story in Television history.  The second reason is two actors: Juliet Landau as Drusilla and James Marsters as Spike.  These performances made the second season.  It was a joy whenever they were on screen.

The season started out with a few lackluster episodes including the forgetable ""Some Assembly Required"".  There were also some truly excellent episodes, including ""School Hard"" and ""Lie To Me"".  THe season really hit its stride with the episode ""Innocence"".  This was my favorite episode of the season.  It had everything, great continuity, magnifient performances from everyone involved, and plot twists galore!  From then on there wasn't a bad episode(except for the worst episode of Buffy EVER! ""Killed By Death"").  Another truly astonishing episode is ""Passion"" in which a pivitol chracter is killed.  This is the most emotional episode of the season.  The season finale ""Becoming"" is another outstanding episode.  Another important chracter is killed off, and the Buffy/Angel relationship reaches a conclusion(for now).

The performances of the season were the already metioned Juliet Landau and James Marsters, and two other actors: Sarah Michelle Geller and David Boreanaz gave heart-breaking performances as Buffy and Angel the star-crossed lovers.

The writers were also at their peek. Right when the Angel and Buffy romance started to get a little boring, they turned him. I also liked the ending and how choices that she made will come back and bite them later. Sending Angel to hell after he turned back- Angel crabby in the thrid season.

1259212,5,B000035Z1R,"This classic episode began what was to be a classic tradition of celebrating Halloween, Buffy style. Buffy and the Scoobies dress up in costumes supplied by Ethan's, a store owned by an old ""acquaintance"" of Giles. A spell is cast by Ethan and they all become what they are wearing. Buffy dresses as a woman from the time when Angel was young,and becomes weak and helpless. Willow first dresses sexy and provocative, but then wimps out and throws on the ghost costume over that. She then becomes a ghost. Xander dresses in fatigues and goes commando. Spike, who normally would take the night off (all good vampires and demons take Halloween off), takes advantage of the chaos and goes after the now helpless slayer. Of course Angel steps in to save the day. However, the best part of the entire show is Xander, who normally is wimpy and helpless.

Season two starts where season one finished, Buffy's back from her summer vacation in LA with her dad, ready to kick some vampire butt and Her romance with Angel the vampire gets more serious.

This season also introduces some new characters to the show, such as band member Oz who goes on to become Willow's boyfriend and later werewolf. Vampire couple Spike and Drusilla.

Oh and Xander gets a girlfriend, Cordelia Chase, the girl he hated most of his teenage life.

1259219,5,B000035Z1R,"In the second season of ""Buffy,"" we begin to see what will become a theme in the Buffyverse - first, no love affair will be allowed to be happy, and second, no matter how close the Scooby gang is to one another, they will never truly allow one another into each other's lives when it counts.  Now, I imagine everyone and their uncle has already seen Season Two by now, but if not, be aware there are some spoilers in my review (because I am assuming everyone had seen Season Two by now).  But if not - you have been warned.

There is a lot of dissent in Season Two, beginning when Buffy returns from her summer with her father distant, moody and downright Cordelia-esque.  It turns out she hasn't quite gotten over the fact that the Master killed her.  No sooner does she get that out of her system, then our favorite bad boy and girl arrive on the scene - Spike and Drusilla.  Who will ever forget that terrific scene - that awesome car that Spike drives screeching into town, running down the ""Welcome to Sunnydale"" sign, the door popping open, the boot stepping out, the awesome leather duster, pan up to the blond hair, lighting the cigarette, pan to the face - Spike in vamp face - take a drag on the butt - ""Home sweet home"" fade to black.  Beautiful!  There are lots of wonderful scenes with Spike this season - some of the best are right at the end of the season when he has to team up with Buffy ""OK, just let me kill this guy . . ""  Buffy: ""Ahem""  Spike: ""Oh, right . . ""  Not to mention the precious scene with Spike and Joyce in the living room, both of them sitting there, all uncomfortable, when Joyce turns to Spike and says ""You know, you look familiar, have I met you before?"" to which Spike replies, all nonchalantly ""Oh, you hit me with an axe once, you know, 'stay the hell away from my daughter'""  To which Joyce just says  ""oh, right""

Then there is Kendra, the vampire slayer ""check out the mini-Giles"" - the Judge ""you get the people to safety, I'll take care of the Smurf"" - and Angelus making an appearance.  Oh, and we can never, ever forget Xander's betrayal of everything by not telling Buffy that Willow was trying the curse again, so that Buffy is forced to kill Angel after his soul is returned to him, sending him to hell and her out of town to try to forget about it.

Basically in Season Two Buffy has to grow up really fast and as I mentioned in the first paragraph she refuses to let anyone else in to try to help her.  This is what ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is all about, at the core of it - one girl, in all the world - facing down the demons and monsters, alone - even if those demons and monsters are her own internal ones.",1188086400,,2665,4.214566929133858
1259220,5,B000035Z1R,"With its second season, this program became one of the best shows on TV.  The impressive dramatic arcs demonstrated that creator Joss Whedon and company were masters of setting up surprises and convincing us that our characters are in real jeopardy, no easy thing to do on a weekly series.  All of the main figures found love this season, and more than one of those affairs ends tragically.  It is rare to find such an effective mix of thrills, laughs, and genuinely affecting drama, and the fact that this show sustained its quality for seven seasons makes it rarer still.

1259222,5,B000035Z1R,"Any other Buffy obsessives re-viewing Season Two this weekend?  Season Two (I have the ""non-slim"" version that unfolds dangerously to get to most discs) may have been the best ever.  The writing and quips are at their best here.  Expect to go from laughing out loud to jaw-dropping heartbreak within a scene or two.  And, of course, you get the first appearances of Spike and Dru(scilla)!  Seth Green's laconic and way-cool Oz!  As well as buxom new Slayer, Kendra (sexy Bianca Lawson).

This season included one of television's all-time famous plot twists in the aftermath of Buffy and Angel's first...time together.  The scenes between Sarah Michelle Gellar and David Boreanaz were spectacular all year long.  Sex has consequences, as series creator (""uber Boss"") Joss Whedon reminds us in a special commentary feature.  If only it was something ""simple"" like a pregnancy...instead, the result was lethally bad news for several Sunnydale residents, including a key supporting player.  Actually a Joss comment that always bothered me was his semi-threat, semi-boast(?) about his power to fire (kill) the cast members off at any time.  Carried out a bit too often.  But David's incredible acting earned him a spin-off and gave us five more seasons of this amazing fantasy world to savor into our collective dotage.

The 2-part episode ""Becoming"" introduces the never-before-seen, oddly never-seen-again Whistler character and shows the sirings of Angel (by Darla) and Dru (by Angel).  And another heartbreaking ending that causes Buffy to head into Season Three, as she did Season Two, alienated and mopey.  Quite Goth, really.

I am now enjoying Joyce meeting Spike.  This time in her living room, sans axe.

Etc:  The great, and still-lamented, John Ritter emerges as a rare celebrity guest star in ""Ted.""  We also have Buffy telling Joyce her big secret (it goes not well), Willow's first forays into witchcraft, Xander/Cordy fireworks, and constant lurking from Principal Snyder.

Inconsistencies:  several things would/should have triggered memories of the upcoming ""flashback"" episode when Buffy was institutionalized.  Spike calls Angel his ""sire"", which is actually wrong.  (I think he's a ""grandsire."")  Spike seems unaware that Angel and Dru were lovers before, which I believe was the subject of a big flashback scene later in ""Angel.""  Finally, Snyder knows about the hellmouth but his raison d'etre is never clarified (for me)...maybe when I re-re-watch Season Three.  And, since I'm STILL in denial about sweet Willow, note how boy-crazy she is all year.  Was it the Black Arts that made her lose interest in me...men!  I meant to say men.

My biggest problem (with BTVS), and maybe it's mine alone, is the difficulty watching...over time, the loss of so many supporting Scoobies.  This year, two are killed.  One undeniably helped the plot.  The other, well, led to the creation of Faith, which to me is the very essence of ""silver lining"".  But by the end of ""Angel"", we lost so many friends...too much bitter for my sweet.  Anyway, don't let my little gripes distract.  This and Season Three are the best ever.  You must own them.",1180224000,,3147,5.122047244094488
1259223,5,B000035Z1R,"When I watch buffy these days, I love watching season 2 more because it made the ultimate bitch-slap to fans of the show.

I was enjoying the second seasons first half of shows, it felt like an improved season 1.

What made me an ultimate fan was Angel becoming Angellus! What a twist!

Spike made his first appearance and is probably my favorite character next to Xander.

The Last episode was excellent and a sad one because it's hard for Buffy to kill Angel and I was really digging this twist.

It's a rare thing when you care for fictional characters in this day and age of recycled garbage on TV. But if you make time, Buffy and her gang will be your second family!",1178150400,,671,4.336
1259224,5,B000035Z1R,"Although the second season of Buffy has the same mix of comedy and tragedy that makes the third and fifth seasons of the show so popular, in other ways it is a very unusual season.  This is the only plot-driven season of Buffy, which is generally a character-driven show.  And the plot is fantastic: it surprises the audience and tortures the characters, who show far more depth than in the first season.  Half of these episodes feature Spike (he's not always the focus of the plot, but he's always around when big things are happening), and they are brilliant.  Spike and Drusilla are the show's first proper villain, although the second half of the season gives us an even better one.  While David Boreanaz is not a great actor, this season uses him brilliantly, and he gives wonderful performances in ""Innocence"", ""I Only Have Eyes for You"", and ""Becoming Parts I and II.""

The non-plot episodes of this season are a different story.  Some of them are fantastic - like the step-father story ""Ted"" and Oz's big episode, ""Phases.""  Others are bad but tolerable, like the anti-frat ""Reptile Boy.""  But ""Bad Eggs"" and ""Killed by Death"" are far more painful than anything in the first season of Buffy, because they're not only bad, but they come between fantastically written and important episodes of the season.  Had these episodes been aired in the quieter first half of the season they would have simply been forgettable, but their placement throws off the pacing of the story.

Another reason for the second season's inconsistency is that it has the best cast of any season of the show, but many of them are recurring characters.  This is the only season of Buffy where every character has a love interest, as Willow's man Oz is introduced and Jenny Calendar takes on a larger role.  Both characters are adorable with Willow and Giles.  Spike and Drusilla are hilarious but complex characters, and Spike's decision in the last episode is interesting enough to draw our attention from the gut wrenching emotion of Buffy and Angel's story.  Jonathon and Harmony are noticeable in a number of episodes this season, but they won't become fully-fleshed characters until later seasons, where they will become fan favorites.  The second season episodes with lots of recurring characters are great, while the ones without them are often lackluster.

Why is the second season of Buffy a 5-star product despite two truly terrible episodes and several other mediocre ones?  First of all, the worst episodes of this season don't contribute to the overall plot, so it's easy to skip them.  If you cut out the crap this is arguably the best season of the show.  The second season deserves respect for being the turning point of the show, when it went from being an enjoyable monster  show to being a work of art that holds its own when compared to Twin Peaks and the great HBO dramas.

Actually, let me clarify that.  The most impressive thing about the second season of Buffy is not that it changes from entertainment to art, but that it gets even funnier while doing so.  Most people believe that TV and movies can be nothing but entertaining brain-killers or serious art.  These people need to watch Buffy.",1177372800,2,3198,4.791970802919708

1259238,5,B000035Z1R,"Season 2 of Buffy was the pinnacle of the series.  Right after Season 1, Joss Whedon decides to go for the jugular.  He puts the audience on an emotional and gripping rollercoaster ride.

You might argue how one can consider a vampire to be Buffy's best villain when she's fought against more powerful demons, gods, and even a friend as a witch.

Whedon sets up the Angel/Buffy relationship to appear that everything is running smooth as silk for these two lovers.  There are some very touching episodes and moments leading up to the nightmare that Buffy must endure.  It's obvious how much Angel and Buffy love each other.  Buffy loses herself in Angel and can't even envision a life without him.  But that is exactly what she must face when ancient curse, caused by a moment of pure ecstasy robs Angel of his soul, and Angelus emerges.

The episode, ""Innocence"" showcases this, and is, in my opinion, the best episode of the entire series.  Whedon immediately shows his audience that ANYTHING can happen on this show, and that he isn't afraid to turn Buffy's world upside-down, which is exactly what happens.

Watch Sarah Michelle Gellar's acting during the course of this season, and see how she's able to get in touch with Buffy's emotional center.  Buffy is the slayer, but she's still a young, teenage girl, as suseptible to all of the pains and hardships that go with the loss of someone you love.  But, it's worse for Buffy.  Angel doesn't just die, he's transformed into her enemy.  An enemy who loves to torture his victims.  We get an idea of just how vindictive and cruel Angelus must have been.  Drusilla is probably his masterpiece...a woman he drove insane before changing her into a vampire.  And Angelus makes the most of his opportunity to shove it all down Buffy's throat without any feelings of remorse.  He tortures and even kills those closest to her and her friends.  David Boreanaz is finally able to show his acting ability.  Before, he was a dark character who brooded and lurked around in the shadows.  The transformation finally gives him a chance to break out.  David has even said that he loves to play Angelus because of the freedom it gives him as an actor.

There's a scene in ""Innocence"" when Buffy realizes that Angel is gone, she walks into her bedroom, looks down at her hand to see the ring that Angel gave her.  She breaks down into uncontrollable sobs as the hard truth begins to sink in.  As a viewer, you can't help but feel the level of loss that Buffy feels at this point.  It's almost heart-breaking to watch.  There is a great piece of music that is played throughout the season.  It's the Buffy/Angel ballad the sings music of love and loss.  It adds to the power of the story that is being told.

The hardest enemy to deal with is one who you love.  That is why I feel that Angelus/Angel was the best villain for Buffy in this series and why Season 2 is so good.  In the last episode, Buffy gets Angel back, but there is a price to pay as she's asked to make the ultimate sacrifice.

Whistler, a demon, isn't sure if Buffy is ready to do what needs to be done.  ""I am,"" she says.  ""I've got nothing left to lose.""  ""You're wrong.  There's one more thing.""  Somehow, Whistler knows that Buffy will not have to kill Angelus, but Angel.

Season 2 sees some other great moments in it.  Spike and Drusilla are added.  James Marsters is absolutely fantastic in his role of Spike, and it's little wonder that fans became so enamored with his character, that Spike was brought back for more seasons after he was originally supposed to be killed after a handful of episodes.

We also get a look at the origin of Angel.  It isn't as in-depth as some of the origin episodes in ""Angel,"" but this is the first glimpse we're given at his life before Buffy and how he came to discover her.

The writing is first rate in this season.  I've always said that a film/television series is only as good as its writing.

Most television shows have a ""best"" season.  And while almost every season (except for the 4th one) is very good during Buffy's television reign, Season 2 is the peak of the series' success, and seems to sum up all that was great about this show.  It was here that Buffy the Vampire Slayer showed that it wasn't JUST a fantasy series, but that it was more than capable of going much, much deeper to tug at the heart and mind of its viewers.",1157760000,2,4387,4.492405063291139

BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER worked hard to cement its place in television history, it really did. And I can honestly say the show was at its creative peak here, though some believe it hit that plateau in seasons three or five. After the critical acclaim from the first season, the WB ordered a round 22 episodes for the next, and fans ate it up. If the writing from last season was exceptional to avoid a possible cancellation, the writing in this season evolved into something even better - as if Joss Whedon and his team of merry morbids were determined to make the most of the renewal they were given. And they certainly did.

Season two continues the exploits of Buffy Summers, Vampire Slayer and Neiman Marcus aficionado, as she tests the choppy waters of first love with Angel, vampire with a soul (played masterfully by David Boreanaz, who is added to the opening credits this year). Things are complicated when you're a sixteen-year-old girl, sure - but of course things are even more complicated when you lose your virginity to a soulless jerk who then proceeds to kill your friends. Wait, what? That's not supposed to happen. Yes, Buffy does sleep with Angel in a moment of unrestrained passion, and it costs her dearly: the soul he was cursed with is removed in his one true moment of happiness, and the demon who murdered half of London is back in business.

Thankfully, though the season revolves around Buffy and Angel, the supporting cast is given plenty to do on their own, and their characters grown onscreen in a fashion you rarely see anymore on TV - realistically. Xander ends up falling in love with bitter enemy Cordelia (who finally has a reason to be in the main credits this season), to the angst of a crushed Willow, who meets cooler-than-cool guitarist Oz (a laconic Seth Green in one of his best roles), who turns out to be a werewolf... add to that a dash of romance even for Giles, and the appearance of a new Slayer, and you have a year full of emotional twists and turns that will culminate in what is arguably the most unforgettable season finale this show has seen. It doesn't hurt that it yanks unmercifully on the heartstrings, too.

As usual, the special features are only for hardcore fans with nothing better to do - but the audio commentaries are always worth a listen, especially Joss Whedon's on ""Innocence."" Definitely worth the $50.",1149033600,,2399,4.677725118483412
1259250,5,B000035Z1R,"A spoiler warning for an older show like BUFFY is probably not called for, but just in case, the following does contain some major ones for anyone who has not seen the show.  If you haven't, let me just write this.  BUFFY creator Joss Whedon recently wrote a review of the DVDs of the first season of VERONICA MARS, a show profoundly influenced by BUFFY.  The highlight of the review was:  ""Best.  Show.  Ever.""  As much as I love VERONICA MARS, I disagree with Whedon.  Why?  Because BUFFY is ""Best.  Show.  Ever.""

That a large television critics and television studies scholars would in 2006 consider BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER the best show in the history of television would have been seemed impossible in 1997.  I remember my response on hearing that a TV show based on a failed movie was going to debut on the WB:  ""Why?""  Why indeed.  But as time went on, the show not only built a small but passionate group of fans, it became distinguished by the quality of its fans.  And now in discussions of great TV, BUFFY is often used as the standard for determining the quality of other shows.  It has influenced many of not most of the truly great shows of the past decade.  For instance, the main creative force behind LOST, Damon Lindelhof, has cited BUFFY as the major model for what they are trying to do.  Not bad for a show for which almost anyone in January 1997 would have predicted failure.

The first season of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER was good, but this is where it got great.  I recently read an article on the Internet about the end of THE SOPRANOS and the author's reflections on how it was in Season Two that it became a great show, and spent much of the article contrasting it with another great show and the season where its greatness came out, BUFFY.  Season Two of BUFFY goes down in the books of most TV critics as one of the great seasons in the history of television.  Although Season One was good, Season Two can be almost shocking in its impact seeing it for the first time.  In fact, much of Season Two feels like an extension of Season One, only getting really good about a third of the way through the season.  It is possible to roughly identify when the show kicks into a higher gear, but the truly shocking thing is that the show goes from very good to great, and then gets greater and greater through a series of amazingly well done episodes.

There are some good things in the season's first third.  The first episode ""When She Was Bad"" and the third ""School Hard"" is important for introducing vampires Spike and Druscilla (the plan was to kill Spike, but he was such an instant hit that he was kept un-alive, eventually becoming arguably the most popular character in the series, perhaps not even second to Buffy), but there were also some fairly weak episodes, such as ""Some Assembly Required"" and ""Inca Mummy Girl.""  The moment when BUFFY starts moving from merely very good to truly great comes around the seventh episode, ""Lie to Me,"" where an old friend of Buffy who is dying of a fatal disease tries to trade Buffy's life to Spike and the other vampires in exchange for being made immortal (the friend is played by ROSWELL'S Jason Behr).  That episode is followed by other strong episodes such as ""The Dark Age,"" which introduces Ethan Rayne to the show, and then by the superb two-parter ""What's My Line?""

At this point one watching for the first time might imagine the show was peaking, but the show was just starting to get good.  The 13th and 14th episodes, ""Surprise"" and ""Innocence"" were neither nominated for an Emmy, but are now considered among the best single episodes in all of television.  These were the episodes where Buffy loses her virginity to Angel and we learn the full truth about Angel.  Though a vampire, we knew in season one that Angel was one with a soul, the victim of a gypsy curse.  When one becomes a vampire, one loses one's soul and therefore one's conscience, but when Angel regained his soul he was tortured by all the sins he had committed.  What Angel didn't know was that the gypsies curse provided that if he were ever to know a moment of perfect happiness, he would once again lose his soul.  And of course when he and Buffy made love, he experienced such a moment, and he instantly resorted to Angelus, an unspeakably sadistic vampire.  The ""big bad"" of Season One had been the ancient vampire The Master, but Season Two's was shockingly the good and beloved Angel.  These two episodes truly are as good as television can get.

As good as those two episodes are, I think the moment I realized just how great BUFFY was came in ""Passion,"" with the wonderful voiceover provided by David Boreanaz.  Unlike movies, TV has largely been a ""safe"" medium.  Viewers know that the dangers presented on TV shows are largely pseudo dangers.  The show must go on and therefore the cast will be back.  One important character in the first two seasons of BUFFY was Jenny Calendar, a beautiful teacher at the school who taught computer science despite being a self-identified techno-pagan.  She and Giles become romantically involved.  We later learn that she is in fact a gypsy of the same group that cursed Angel and she was largely in Sunnydale to spy on him.  When he loses his soul, however, she instantly regrets that this had been allowed to happen, and begins to research a spell to restore Angel's soul.  Just as she is getting close, however, Angel enters the school, chases her down, and shockingly breaks her neck.  Although I had witnessed the death of Deep Throat and X in THE X-FILES, I still had a sense that TV characters were safe and that somehow in every situation the good guys will escape and only the bad guys will die.  I was stunned by Jenny Calendar's death like nothing I had experienced before.  As terrible as that was, things then got worse as Angel took her body and positioned it in Giles's bedroom in a romantic setting.  In that scene BUFFY not only made its world unsafe, it embraced The Hurt in a way that no prior television shows ever had.  Before BUFFY and ANGEL ended, around a dozen and a half important sympathetic characters would die.  To this day only a tiny number of shows have had a world as unsafe as that of BUFFY-FARSCAPE, THE SOPRANOS, SIX FEET UNDER, and LOST to name most of those few.

The last half of Season Two is taken up by the struggle between Buffy and her demon lover Angel, culminating in what is almost certainly the greatest season finale in TV history, the two-part ""Becoming.""  The second part of ""Becoming"" is so good that only rarely do the movies come up to its level.  I have little patience with TV snobs, those poor souls who love to patronizingly say things like, ""I don't watch TV"" or ""I don't even own a TV.""  What idiots.  What they have missed is that during the past couple of decades TV has pretty much overtaken and passed the movies as a narrative medium.  I'm not sure that I could come up with enough movies to fill the fingers of one hand that have affected me as powerfully as did the ending of the Second Season of BUFFY.  The episode itself was a masterpiece of compressed story telling, filled with one great moment after another.  I think of the episode and I think of such things as Buffy and Spike's conversation in front of a police squad car where Spike calls for a truce and a partnership in defeating Angel.  Or Buffy telling her mother that she is a Vampire Slayer, and their ensuing conversation (Joyce:  Have you tried not being a slayer?).  Or Joyce and Spike sitting uncomfortably in the Summers's living room, Joyce nursing a drink that she so desperately needs.  And then the great battle between Buffy and Angel with Willow restoring his soul just moments before Buffy has to kill him.  Finally, the Sarah McLaughlin song that brings the episode to a close with Buffy on a bus out of Sunnydale.

I still my disbelief at the end of the final episode.  How, I wondered, was it possible for TV to be this good?  I actually think that Season Five of BUFFY is the show's best season, but by then I had come to expect great things of it.  But I have never been as overwhelmed by a television show as much as I was by Season Two of BUFFY.  Although BUFFY would remain a truly great show for five more seasons, had it ended with that episode its place in television history would be secure.

Now that the show is priced to own, I urge anyone who loves quality entertainment to get his or her own copy.  There are episodes from Season Two that I have watched more than a dozen times.  This is definitely not a series that you want to watch only once.",1146268800,8,8607,4.487459807073955

1259253,4,B000035Z1R,"The first season of ""Buffy: The Vampire slayer"" showed tons of promise, a dose of originality and a handful of classic episodes. But overall that season didn't show the full potential of the series and its tone (which wavered between campy and light-hearted with the exception of a couple of episodes). But the second season of ""Buffy"" showed what the series truly was, an original and addictive show anchored by terrific performances, clever writing and an endearing mood. Although the second season began with the weak opener ""When she was bad"", it bounced back with numerous entertaining and sometimes wonderful stand-alone episodes (like ""School hard"", ""Lie to me"" and ""The Dark age""), then it suddenly shifted gear in the second half of the season (beginning with ""Surprise"") and never looked back. From that episode onward ""Buffy"" reached storytelling and thrill-inducing heights that few shows ever reach and combined with some truly amazing visual moments made the second season and its two-parter ending ""Becoming"" one of the best seasons of the show and the first to show its true nature and potential. Dealing with Witches, zombies, curses, mummies and of course vampires, the show oozes supernatural mayhem and thrills, while dealing with emotional and moral issues in effective and original ways that transcend the show's genre and make it something else entitrely. So these 22 episodes are mostly a delight (with a couple of clunkers like the horrible ""Bad Eggs"" and the downright awful ""Go fish"") to fans and people who want to sink head first into the show. *The DVD sets features adequate transfers which can not transcend the humble origins of the show as the first and second seasons of the show were shot on 16mm film stock resulting in a slightly grainy image, as for the extras they are plentiful and mostly entertaining*.",1142294400,,1844,5.049180327868853
1259254,5,B000035Z1R,"WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD.

After the first season found success as a mid-season replacement, the WB renewed BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER for a second season, this time with a full slate of 22 episodes.  It was during this second season that fans were given their first taste of the brilliance that made the show so popular in the seasons that followed.

The first half of this season sticks, for the most part, to the first season's ""Monster of the Week"" formula, as Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) does battle with an array of creepy crawlies.  Some of these episodes were great, such as ""Halloween"" (in which our gang becomes whatever they're dressed up as) and ""Lie to Me"" (in which Buffy finds herself trying to disillusion a group of vampire worshippers); many were not (""Reptile Boy"", ""Inca Mummy Girl"").  One of the finest early episodes of this season is ""School Hard"", which introduced the fan favorite characters of Spike (James Marsters) and Drusilla (Juliet Landau).  But it's during the second half of the season, beginning at episode 13, where the show finally realized its potential and became the brilliant drama we all know and love.  The primary storyline of the season's later episodes revolves around the relationship between Buffy and Angel (David Boreanaz).  Centuries ago, Angel was cursed by gypsies, who restored his soul, thus forcing him to eternally torment himself for the pain he had caused as the evil vampire Angelus.  If Angel ever experiences a moment of true happiness, he will revert back to his original form as the vampiric barbarian Angelus.  As you may guess, Angel experiences a moment of true happiness, causing Buffy to question whether she can cure her true love - or whether she'll ultimately be forced to kill him.

Many of the show's finest episodes are in this season.  They include ""Surprise"" and ""Innocence"", in which Angel undergoes his surprising transformation; ""Passion"", in which Angel psychologically torments Buffy's friends and family; ""I Only Have Eyes for You"", in which Sunnydale High is haunted by the ghost of a former student-turned-murderer; and the excellent two-part finale, ""Becoming"", considered by many to be the finest episodes of the entire series.

The second season of BUFFY features surprising plot twists, terrific acting (Gellar is outstanding), clever and witty scripts, and a great soundtrack.  Many a fan considers this to be the show's finest season; I'd say it's definitely up there.  Those who watched Season One and enjoyed it will feel well-rewarded whilst watching BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER: Season Two - it's all that Season One was and so very much more.

This leaves the DVD presentation's features. While fortunately they constitute an improvement over the last season, there's still a lot of work to be done. Out of 22 episodes, only four have a commentary track, and of those only one - Joss Whedon's track for ""Innocence"" - is worth listening to. The first of the rest, David Greenwalt's ""Reptile Boy"", is actually one of the worst commentary tracks I've had the misfortune to hear. Greenwalt does nothing but describe the episode, as if the viewer had forgot to see it before turning on the track, and he is a boring and irritating narrator, sounding quite a lot like Butthead of ""Beavis & Butthead"". One keeps waiting for the imbecilic chuckling to commence.

The menus are not as awkward and clumsy as in the first season, yet they will insist, upon one's selection of an episode to play, on running a silly little CGI sequence for a few seconds. This sequence cannot be skipped. It may sound petty, but try to watch this 22 times - it will get old very fast.

It goes without saying that there are no gag reels. There are a few scripts and a handful of ""interviews"" (each lasting less than a minute) tossed in, and those are of minimal interest. The production features are better, but some tend to run on.

Lastly, the screening quality itself is not as good as can be desired, but this is not package's fault - the first two seasons were filmed in grainy, cheap 16 mm film, and it shows. I suppose that the transer actually did it justice, since I remember it looking worse on the original TV broadcast. Still, one cannot help but wonder if there was no way to improve the quality further.

So why did I give it a four star rating? That's simple: because of the quality of the episdoes themselves. This may be the finest overall season of the show, including classics like ""School Hard"", ""Lie to Me"", ""Innocence"", ""Passion"", ""I Only Have Eyes for You"", and ""Becoming"". Too bad that the WB couldn't be bothered to treat it properly.",1141171200,,2190,4.534177215189874

In addition this television series is a modern myth that portrays the development of and relationships to powerful femininity.

1259258,5,B000035Z1R,"I must admit, I was not a HUGE fan of the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. To me the story was weak and a little too corky. However, the second season more than makes up for all that. This season Buffy and her friends face challanges that were shocking and extremely fun to watch.

At the Beginning of the season, Buffy returns to Sunnydale after spending the summer with her father in LA. She returns a changed woman after dying at the end of the first season. Buffy and her friends quickly find out that there are two new villans in town, Spike and Drusilla. These two are one of the reasons this season is so great. Drusilla is absolutely insane and a trip to watch, and Spike is pretty funny this season, but not nearly as funny as his later appearences.

Buffy and the gang fight Spike and Dru for the first part of season two. During that time the Buffy/Angel love story really takes off. It was very nice this season to see how well the functioned as a couple, at least for a time. Mid-way through the season, Angel becomes the most deliciously evil character of the series. With his turn to the darkside it makes it quite interesting to see how Buffy delt with having to fight the man she loves. The season ends with a amazing finale that would bring just about anyone to tears. With Angel and Buffy having one final battle.

I would say the most engaging part of this season is the unexpected plot twists. They are ALL OVER THE PLACE! A viewer watches this season and thinks they have someone/something figured out and in a matter of episodes your comletely shocked....IE Xander and Cordelia's unexpected relationship, the coming of a new slayer, and the true identity of Ms. Calander.

Season two is amazing, and honestly my words don't do justice to this amazing season. I suggest that you watch season 1 first. You might have to force yourself through it, but season 2 makes it more than worth it.",1140220800,,1918,4.4714285714285715
1259259,5,B000035Z1R,"Ok, so I started watching Buffy on dvd. I was never a fan of the show, but I liked the movie with Kristy Swanson. So, Season 1 was humorous, with some cool action sequences and lots of bad vampire acting. I wasn't expecting much more from season 2. Well, I was wrong. Dead wrong.

Buffy Season 2 starts off with a bang. Over the summer, Xander and Willow have grown close while Buffy was down in LA enjoying the time off. Buffy returns with a vengenace, and deep seeded issues about the vampire master who tried to kill her (season finale of season 1) As the episodes go on, Buffy and her friends make new friends and form new relationships. Angel becomes a rather important character as well, and he is seen in MANY episodes.

New to this season is Spike, and his mentally insane vampire babe, Drusilla. (Isn't she one of Cinderella's evil stepsisters?!?) We discover more about Angel and his past, get rid of the ""annoited one"" or annoying one as Spike refers to him as. We get more action, more deaths and more vampire humor, Buffy style.

As campy as this show is, it has a HUGE cult following. If you take the time and watch an episode or two, you will discover why, like I did. Buffy is more of a satire about vampires, but done rather seriously. We are supposed to beleive that vampires have these...monsterous faces when they attack, and not laugh?? Well, Buffy and her friends are like normal high school teenagers, with some BELOW high school level intelligence vampires stalking around.

Im hooked for the humor, the action and the general feel of this show. Part of the reason it is so enjoyable is the ""scary"" aspect of the show, with the mummies, vampires and monsters running around, and watching Buffy kick their butts. I wasn't a fan of Sarah Michelle Geller until now, but she plays the dumb blonde perfectly.",1140134400,,1827,4.544072948328267
1259260,5,B000035Z1R,"I do not consider it hyperbole to talk about the second season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" as scaling operatic heights, culminating with the glorious aria of ""Becoming, Part 2,"" which I still relentlesly tout as one of the ten best dramatic hours on television I have ever seen in my life. I have watched a lot of television and have been teaching classes about this topic for over half my life, so I believe I can make a pretty convincing case. We witnesses the potential of this series in Season 1, when creator Joss Whedon held off on the revelation that the mysterious Angel was really a vampire, who just happened to have a soul and loved the Slayer, until half way through the abbreviated first season. In Season 2, we find out just how far true love can go wrong.

Love continues to be a very painful thing for the Scooby Gang, as Cordelia (""Some Assembly Required""), Xander (""Inca Mummy Girl"") and Joyce (""Ted""), find out. Then again, prospects look much better for Willow (""Phases""), although we never really do take the Cordelia-Xander romance (""Go Fish"") to be anything more than a cosmic joke, which does offer up the delightfully twisted ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered"" as the exception that proves the rule (footnote: Buffy spends most of the episode as the Buffy rat because Sarah Michelle Gellar was hosting SNL that week). Of the off-arc stories, ""Halloween"" and ""Ted"" are clearly the best of the bunch. But when it comes to romance, Buffy and Angel are truly on the road to hell paved with the best of intentions.

It is clear in the season premier episode, ""When She Was Bad,"" that things are different. When Buffy dances seductively with Xander, taunting him with her sexuality, the ante has been upped considerably. The pivotal point in the season comes with episode 13 (of 22), ""Surprise,"" when Buffy unknowingly undoes Angel's curse on the night of her 17th birthday by making love to him. Why the gypsies put in the Faustian (in the Goethe sense) escape clause via the moment of true happiness and contentment is debatable, but the galvanizing effect on the show is truly impressive. When Angelus brutally slays Jenny Calendar in ""Passion,"" leaving her body in a grotesque display for Giles to discover in his bed (while opera music soars in the background), it is the symbolic Hellmouth of the show opening up. The audience is shocked into realizing how bad things can get, only the worst is yet to come. Giles's anger buys him one shot at Angelus, but Buffy has to rescue him. They turn on each other in anger, and Buffy actually slugs him to the ground before they collapse weeping in each other's arms. Buffy tells him, ""I can't do this alone,"" but this proves to be most ironically incorrect.

Clearly Whedon constructs each season around two half-season story arcs. The first half of Season 2 heralds the arrival of Spike and Dru, and the quick departure of ""The Annoying One."" Of course now we look back and are amazed at what James Marsters has done with the role of Spike, but at this point it is Juliet Landau's ditzy psychotic vampire who provides the flair of the dark side. Whedon brings the first half to a climax in ""What's My Line?,"" the show's first two-parter, where we are introduced to Kendra the Vampire Slayer. It seems Buffy's brief moment of death at the hands of the Master in ""Prophecy Girl"" has some long reaching implications we only begin to appreciate at this point. But with the return of Angelus everything changes. Spike and Drusilla are trying to reassemble the Judge, a grotesque who cannot be killed ""by any weapon forged."" Then everybody learns the truth about not only Angel's transformation but also Jenny's betrayal. Thus begins the deadly game of cat and mouse between Angel and his former allies, which culminates in the two parts of ""Becoming.""

Both parts of ""Becoming"" are written and directed by Whedon, and represent the apex of his work on the series. When Angeleus opens the portal to Hell, only his blood can close it, but things are not going to be that easy for Buffy. The dramatic culmination contains the best fight sequence (with swords) in a show that prides itself on innovative staging of its fights, and is an ultimately emotionally shattering experience captured beautifully by Sarah Michelle Gellar's slow dissolve into tears while the haunting Sarah McLachlan song ""Full of Grace"" is played. Joss Whedon had set this moment up from the first episode of the series. It is a payoff usually reserved for the final episode of a series and not simply the end of the second season. ""Becoming"" is truly an astounding accomplishment in the history of dramatic television and when you watch the entire second season again you can appreciate how brilliantly this shattering conclusion is set up.

The original theatrical film was a teaser, the first season on television was an appetizer, but the second season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was epic and once you see this, whether again or for the first time, you are not going to want to stop here. It was also nice to see that the extras went up a couple of notches for the Season 2 DVD collection, especially since we expect more goodies from Whedon and crew, especially given the high quality of ""The Watchers Guide,"" the show's official companion volumes.  There was a lot of thought put into this show, which means any and all insights and looks behind the curtain are greatly appreciated.",1137974400,6,5429,4.75185577942736
1259261,5,B000035Z1R,"Season two of Buffy is the finest season of this series and of any television series I have ever seen. With the series renewed for a complete second season, creator Joss Whedon decides to depart from his basic ""Monster of the Week"" format of season one and present the season in story-arc format. The first part of the season presents vampires Spike and Drusilla as villains, and they are interesting from the moment they are introduced. Spike has brought his vampire mate Drusilla to Sunnydale in search of a mystical cure for her chronic illness. The answer for her cure brings up the issue of Angel's place in both their pasts and indicates the depths of the evil of Angel's unsouled persona, Angelus.

Also throughout the first half of the season, the romance between Buffy and Angel builds. At midseason Angel's ""curse"" of a soul is lifted and in a surprise twist he is once again the evil unsouled Angelus, perhaps the worst of all vampires ever in existence. Buffy spends the rest of the season dealing with both her guilt over her part in the loss of Angel's soul and her duty to kill Angelus who has the outward appearance and memories of her dearest love, and nothing else. This hesitation on her part causes the death of someone near to the scoobies, and ultimately Buffy decides that it is time to take the fight to Angel. She forms a strange alliance with Spike for the purpose of killing Angel, when she learns that Spike dislikes Angel for reasons of his own. For one he is none too keen about Angel's current plan to cause the end of the world since it turns out that Spike actually enjoys comingling with humans - of course for completely selfish and unsouled reasons. Also, Spike does not like the romantic attention Drusilla has been giving Angel since Angel has lost his soul. This is the first we see of the poetic side of Spike which is investigated much more deeply from season five onward. The final battle is preceded by a ""good demon"", Whistler, giving Buffy a few words of advice on how to deal with Angel. Buffy responds by telling Whistler not to worry, that she has nothing left to lose. Whistler prophetically tells her after she has already left his presence ""Wrong kid, you got one more thing"". That last battle between Angel/Angelus and Buffy has a shocking ending, one in which Buffy must make a choice that in many ways colors her viewpoint on life and slaying for the rest of the series.

In addition to this main tragic story arc involving Angel and Buffy, there are other excellent subplots taking place. Willow begins to step away from her daydreams of a romance with Xander and begins a real relationship with Oz, a senior who has his own band and is best described as monosyllabic and devoted to Willow. Xander starts a romance of his own that can only be described as unexpected. Finally, there is the continuation from season one of the relationship between Jenny and Giles that ends abruptly when Giles learns that Jenny has misled him and the scoobies about her true reason for coming to Sunnydale.

It's hard to find a perfect season of television, but this one almost completely fits the bill.",1132444800,,3141,4.625448028673835

I don't regret, this season is awesome. Spike and Drucilla - masterpieces. I just love Spike's accent and his sense of humor. I had no idea that at the age of 28 I can enjoy adventures of a high schooler so much. But I'm hooked and I definatelly recommend season 2.

1259264,5,B000035Z1R,"Television doesn't get better than this (though season three comes rather close, I must admit). If you only buy one season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, let it be this one, and I guarantee you will not be disappointed. This is one of the most well thought out, affecting, heartbreaking, meaningful television seasons. If someone tells you that season six is dark, they're lying - that's just depressing. Season 2 is, in my humble opinion, the darkest season in many respects, but Joss Whedon constructs the story in such a nuanced fashion that the dark aspects are far more subtle. And to those that pay close attention, this can make it much more creepy. Angel's turn to the dark side is by far the coolest arc of the series and without a doubt the most shocking. This is the season with the perfect balance of horror, romance, comedy, and drama, and all the characters are at their absolute best (even when they're at their worst). Don't miss it.",1128556800,5,947,4.642857142857143
1259265,5,B000035Z1R,"I was just another person who laughed at the show, actually I didn't give it much thought at all. I mean, the movie was a flop and come on people, a blonde cheerleader fighting the ""forces of darkness"" and vampires in a miniskirt? Seems like a nerdy teenage boy fest to me. But the very first episode of Buffy that I saw was Becoming Part I. Not the best of places to start out, granted, but I don't think I'd change it for the world.

It literally changed my life.

Becoming Part I and II were the possibly the most moving things in my life thus far and I didn't even know an entire two seasons of back story. Maybe my life was pretty dull up until then, I don't know, all I know is, this really, completely, and happily changed my life for the better.

But the season finale is just the climax of this brilliant set. Because it's the perfect balance of funny, sad, moving, and witty all rolled into one. I was especially happy with Passions which makes the show a lot more than just another fake, money making scheme and I can actually say that Buffy is more real than a lot of other shows in that sense. Sure, Friends doesn't deal with the supernatural (other than the one with the Yeti) and 24 doesn't have vampires, but when you watch it, it's some how more than just another show.

I was actually sad at the end (the second time around) that I hadn't had to wait that torturous week to see the next episode because it seemed to fly by, yet at the same time I could still feel the indents on my armrests from Lie to Me, or I would still smile when I thought of Xander and his crazy antics. Still got goosebumps when I heard the word surprise.

I've seen a lot of TV shows and plenty of movies, but this show, this season of the show, draws you in like nothing I've ever seen.

I don't care if you buy it, that's not what this is about, I'm saying watch it, and watch the whole thing through, because after Surprise, your life will just be a little bit better. If you're unsure about devoting a few hours of your life to this, then rent just the last disc (though I really don't reccomend it, it's incredibly, incredibly powerful after two seasons) and I promise you it will be something that you will never forget.",1128556800,,2219,4.23404255319149

Like the popular superhero icons Superman and Lois Lane, and Spiderman and Mary Jane Watson;  Buffy and Angel prove themselves to be in just the same rank.

There are no words to describe this piece of art, and for some reason, I can't stop crying. This season, this series, is the epitome of television, and everyone should own this season and all the other Buffy seasons. I have been a fan of the show for eight years now. There has never been anything on television that has changed my entire life and my persective on the world. Many people think that a show called ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" would be incredibly retarded and would teach you nothing. I am not alone when I say that ""Buffy"" has the best writing I have ever seen and is definitely the best television series ever created. You fall in love with these characters almost immediately. When they feel pain, you feel their pain. This series is so culturally rich that even college classes and academic conferences around the world have been centered around the philosophy and lore of ""Buffy"". I would suggest that you not rent or buy the first season first, because you will not be convinced. Rent seasons 2-7 first, and then when you are a die-hard fan, rent season one. I guess I oughta give some information on the show before anyone starts dishing out money. Buffy Anne Summers is the Slayer: a girl who was Chosen before birth, endowed with superhuman strength and impeccable fighting abilities, and pushed into the world to protect and guard mankind. In this season, the one thing that was keeping Buffy going day after day is taken away from her: the love of her life. Angel, also known as the vampire Angelus, becomes evil once more when Buffy and Angel have sex for the first time. In the end, she realizes that she must kill him. I will not give away any more of the plot points. As years pass, Buffy turns from a confused young girl who has no control over her life, to a woman who takes charge of her life. People come, and people go over the next five years, but Buffy keeps fighting because it ""never stops"". You would have to be a fan to get that line.",1118880000,2,2064,4.492021276595745

The romances between Xander/Cordelia and Willow/Oz are entertaining and provide a lighter counterpoint to Buffy's relationship angst.

The Angelus arc is brilliant, but unfortunately, is only featured mainly in Surprise/Innocence, Passion, I Only Have Eyes for You, and Becoming part 1 & 2. This season has a lot of monster-of-the-week episodes (Bad Eggs, Killed by Death, Go Fish, etc.) that don't really advance the main plot very well.

The result of Whedon's increased artistic freedom is a series that has enjoyed both critical acclaim and audience notoriety. Nominated for 14 Emmy's during its seven year run, the show managed to win only two (both in 1998 for Outstanding Makeup and Outstanding Music Composition in a television series).

1259287,5,B000035Z1R,"I've only recently been watching Buffy on DVD, and never watched it back when it was actually on TV. I'm not a huge fan as such, but I have to say, I thought Season Two was really fantastic.

By all respects, it is a tremendous achievement that there were so many gripping, exciting, and emotionally engaging episodes. It was genuinely thrilling to ride the wave that was the Surprise/Innocence combo, and then to follow it all through to the impressive season finale, with a variety of top-notch episodes in-between.

Buffy Season Two really is fantastic television, and it's certainly the season that I think was Buffy at her very best.",1113609600,,638,4.790909090909091
1259288,5,B000035Z1R,"This season was the bomb! Okay, so the begining was a bit.. y'know... After, Angel turns evil and joins uop with bleachy Spike and mental Dru, it picked up like crazy.

I think this season is the real coming out of Buffy. The gang is fighting harder demons, studying harder ect. This season was one of the best seasons. Some people were a bit iffy after the first season (okay,me) but after watching the second season, I WAS AN ADDICT!!!

It's definetly a must see season!!!",1112572800,,474,4.5
1259289,5,B000035Z1R,"This is not my favorite season because there are some stupid episodes in it, like Some Assembly Required, Bad Eggs, Killed by Death and Go Fish. But this is an amazing season.. Buffy and Angel's relationship is really touching. Spike and Drusila are lovely and scary at the same time. Xander and Cordy, Willow and Oz are so cute together! The theme is love, passion in this season so be prepared for romance and some heart-breaking episodes such as Surprise, Innocence, Passion, I Only Have Eyes For You and Becoming 1&2.

The show hits its stride here and it remains perfect throw seasons 2-6. Not that season seven is bad but not as good as the previous! If you haven't watched it yet, give it a try.",1111017600,,702,4.52755905511811
1259290,5,B000035Z1R,"Out of all the seasons, this is the best by far!  It is just so intense and real.  This is the season that really defined Buffy as a show.

This season is just so intense!  Joss Whedon does an amazing job!  If your not a Buffy fan . . I would start out with the first season but if you are a Buffy fan this is a definite MUST!!!",1110153600,,4193,4.52972972972973
1259291,5,B000035Z1R,"After gaining some fame during the twelve-episode run of the first season, ""BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER"" was given a full twenty-two episode comeback for season two.  Many fans consider the show's second season to be its best, and there are definitely some great episodes here.

Beginning a year after the end of the first season, ""When She Was Bad"" is a surprisingly poor effort from the genius behind the show, Joss Whedon.  The following episode, ""Some Assembly Required"", isn't much better.  But at the third season, the series begins picking up.  I'm talking about ""School Hard"", which introduced the characters of Drusilla and Spike, the ever-so-awesome badass vampire who would play a pivotal role later on in the series.  Seth Green joins the cast of the show in ""Inca Mummy Girl"", as Oz, who takes an interest in Willow (Alyson Hannigan).  Other great episodes include ""Halloween"", ""Lie to Me"", ""The Dark Age"", and ""What's My Line (Parts 1 & 2)"".  John Ritter guest stars in ""Ted"".

The most important part of season two is Angel's (David Boreanaz) transformation from the kind and protective Angel to the murderous, sadistic killer Angelus.  You see, Angel was cursed by gypsies who restored his soul - however, if he experiences one moment of true happiness, he'll revert back to his less-nice form.  He experiences that moment in an unbelievable cliffhanger at the end of ""Surprise"".  As he mentally tortures Buffy and threatens her friends, Buffy tries to work up the courage to kill once and for all her former lover.

The season ends with ""Becoming Part 2"" which, in my opinion as well as that of countless others, is the best episode of the entire show.  The ending is so heartbraking and depressing that you can't help but shed a tear.

Sporting great performances from the cast - especially Sarah Michelle Gellar, who deserves a box full of Emmys - as well as creative and endlessly surprising writing, the second season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is supreme entertainment, television at its finest.  When you find a show that will keep your heart racing throughout the entire season and then leave you dying for more, you know there's something great here.",1109635200,3,2175,4.885558583106267
1259292,5,B000035Z1R,"Buffy's second season is probably the best show I ever watched. The story between Buffy and Angel is so romantic. The fact that Buffy is the slayer and that Angel is a vampire makes the story even more interesting. It is certain that this season does not have a lot of action and suspense, but according to me, it's the best. If you love love stories, you'll like this show. If not, the other seasons are better.
Congratulations to Joss Whedon !
I love Buffy and I have all the seasons, even the compact discs !
Five stars !",1109030400,,524,4.303030303030303
1259293,5,B000035Z1R,"By the end of this season, you should have an idea as to why Buffy is, as I say, the Greatest Show of All Time. But, of course, don't start here--you must start with the First Season and watch this in its proper order. Buffy is not standard tv-fare, viewable in any which way. There are running storylines, and the characters evolve and grow (as does the overall tone of the show); it demands to be seen in order.

The Second Season contains what is possibly the best episode of all of television, all time: Becoming. Becoming's main competition comes from other episodes of Buffy. Becoming, and the Second Season, are as wonderful as they are for the emotional impact they produce. Becoming is devastating, haunting, and its climactic moment should be studied by all prospective writers as to define what ""climax"" is, and what it should do. Becoming is not, of course, the only great episode of the season. There are several others, including When She Was Bad (the season opener), Lie to Me, Innocence, Passion and I Only Have Eyes for You.

There are a few episodes which are sub-par, by Buffy's high standards, but these are normally mitigated by the generally witty and spot-on dialogue, strong and consistent characterizations and the overall fun and fancy of the show itself. Representatives of the lower end include Bad Eggs, Reptile Boy, Killed by Death, and Go Fish.

Notable also are a guest appearance by John Ritter (in the episode Ted) who provides one of the best guest spots in the series, the creation of the marvelous villains Spike and Drusilla, the addition of the always likable Seth Green, and the breakout acting of David Boreanaz (as Angel).

The Second Season is arguably the best season of the series (I agree with this view). It has wonderfully fun plots and moments you'll never forget. Its theme is love (what other show can you intelligently talk about its seasons having *themes*!?) and the ecstacy, madness and dangers therein.",1106438400,2,1958,4.801186943620178
1259294,5,B000035Z1R,"Established: Buffy is the best show that has ever been on T.V.

That being said, I'll get on to the second season.

The setup is this: Buffy and Angel are in love, which is great, except Angel's a vampire. Granted, he has a soul, but he is still a vampire. And when he and Buffy finally...um...he loses that soul. Now Buffy had a supervamp to deal with, one who's wearing her boyfriend's face--because of course back before Angel got his soul he was one of the most powerful vampires in centuries.

The first 1/2 of the series has the major villains being Spike and Drusilla, a pair of seriously slutty, and in Drusilla's case more than a little insane, vampires. They're extremely powerful and used to run with Angel back when he was the evil Angelus. Now they're hanging around Sunnydale making trouble.

Note: James Marsters did an exceptionally good job playing Spike; his performance was interesting enough for the writers to insert an extremely unlikely plot twist in Season Five to get him to stick around (a chip in his head? um, nice, but requires some suspension of belief). An actor who can turn a slightly important baddie into a full-time cast member is pretty talented. Funny performance--even while he was trying to be evil and serious it came off as really, really funny.

The whole 'Angel turns evil after he and Buffy get intimate' thing was interesting because of many teenage girls' experiences with boyfriends after intimacy. Many say that their partners completely changed and sometimes seemed like entirely different people after they (the girls) 'gave it up'. Seems to me that the writers took that common dilemma and extended it with the whole Angel/Angelus business.

""Becoming, Part II"" was one of the best single episodes ever to air on television. First of all, because it had swordfighting. I'm big on swords, don't ask me why. Second, because of the intense emotion involved. Buffy's decision was difficult, almost heart-wrenching, yet she makes it with barely a blink because she has to. I especially love when Angelus disarms her in the courtyard and says, ""...No weapons, no friends, no hope. What do you have left?"" And thrusts the sword at her heart. Buffy just looks him in the eye and says, ""Me."" Excellent point.

Another great part of the finale was when Spike and Buffy team up. The whole thing was halarious, esp. when Joyce says, ""Have you tried not being a vampire slayer?"" Spike looks so out of place sitting on Buffy's couch, and their conversation by the police car is a laugh riot. I thought it was interesting the way, after they decided on their temporary alliance, they are walking toward Buffy's house and keep glancing sideways at each other. Both Gellar and Marsters do an excellent job portraying the whole, ""I cannot believe I'm doing this!"" mindset. It's pretty obvious even then why the writers decided to make Spike stick around; they've got great chemistry (not just of the sexual variety).

Oh and also David Boreanez (sp?) does an excellent job going from heartbreaking vamp-w/-a-soul to evil Angelus who lives to torture Buffy. ""Passion"" was an exceptionally good episode.

The only problem I have with this season is that I'm really not a fan of all the unrequited/star-crossed love stuff. If you're a fan of agonizing, gut-wrenching misery then you'll lap this season up--but it kind of bugged me. If it's not real then I like happily-ever-after, thanks.

Although I understand that the season wouldn't have been half as good if it had been happily-ever-after for Angel and Buffy.

All in all, an excellent season in a superb series.",1106438400,3,3598,4.853181076672104
1259295,5,B000035Z1R,"The Becoming prt 1 and 2.

Hands down the best acting in the entire series of Buffy.

Close seconds came in season 4 with Hush and Restless.",1104883200,,140,4.148148148148148
1259306,3,B000035Z1R,"I loved this boxed set, but felt there was much more they could have added in regards to special features.  So far none of the Buffy boxed sets have had any cast interviews except the 6th season, which was only a Academy of Arts and Sciences featurette.  I wish they had more special features!",1102032000,3,293,4.407407407407407
1259307,5,B000035Z1R,"This was and still is my favorite season. I am an average fan of buffy who also likes the Smallville series and Friends and King of Queens so if you like any of those, you'll love this. It has comedy that is at it's freshest (if it is a word) and purest. There is a dramatic love story which takes you away from those ordinary redundant love stories. Angel in this season is the ""Big Bad"" in the end and is in my opinion the best villian on the Buffy series. He and Buffy have an ""intimate"" moment which rids Angel of his soul and turns him back into the vicious killer who drove his prew crazy before he killed thim (an example: Drusilla). Spike is abnormally funny and is the starting ""Big Bad"" in this season.

The funniest episode is on here and its about a halloween in sunnydale where everyone turns into their costume. Xander turns into a military soldier, willow turns into a ghost, and buffy turns into a 16 century girl.

  The saddest episode is also on the second season with the final fight with Angelus (the killer Angel). A suprise ending leads to great tragedy.

  All in all, this is the best season of buffy. Season 1 wasn't so hot, 2 is the best, 3 is right behind it, 5 is right behind that, 4 is behind that, 6 and seven come last. the feeling of buffy is gone by the last seasons. hope you make the right decision and buy this.",1101686400,4,1349,4.22568093385214
1259308,5,B000035Z1R,"Well, ""great"" is maybe an understatement.

I never watched this fantastic show while it was originally airing (sad to say), but after watching a few reruns on FX, I knew that this was a wonderful show--and so i got my hands on all the dvd's. I finished seasons 1-3 in one week (that's right, one week), and let me say that this is probably my favorite season for several reasons:

1. Angel and Buffy: they are so warming to watch, and it will be hard to get used to buffy dating someone new in later seasons. Angel is such an amazing character, and his love for Buffy is pure and heartbreaking.

2. Spike: definitely the prominent comedian, and my favorite villain of the season (how can anyone argue with that?) He is so likeable, even when he is purely evil.

3. The season finale: Can you say great acting? The scene where Buffy must make the ultimate sacrifice is so heartbreaking that i found myself crying hours afterward. Sarah Michelle Gellar is so convincing in her laughter, love, and loneliness, that anyone watching this episode will cry and cry and cry.

Let me just say that this season is magnificent, in story, acting, effects, etc...

This is a MUST HAVE. Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the BEST of the best.",1101254400,3,1222,4.531818181818182
1259309,5,B000035Z1R,"First off, let me say that I was totally disappointed in the later seasons (i.e.,5-7).  I mean, Dawn was totally annoying and there was more than one slayer.  Isn't the storyline ""Into each generation, there has been a slayer.  ONE GIRL in all the world...""  I mean, there was like twelve of them! (referring to the seventh season).  Come on, that's pushing it.  But, the second season is my second favorite season.  The romance arc between Buffy and Angel is so heatrbreaking and poetic that it will make you feel for both of them.  And, Sarah Michelle Gellar, as always, delivers 110% here.  And, is it just me, or does she look absolutely gorgeous?  This season opened a gate for the drama to come, and kept the action coming and rolling with the punches, it's amazing that this show isn't re-ran more often.  If you are a strong Buffy fan, and you haven't boughten this, I stongly suggest you do so to preserve the golden Buffy!",1101168000,2,932,4.554216867469879
1259310,5,B000035Z1R,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season two, considered by many fans to be the highlight of the series seven season run, is a must for any BTVS, Sci-Fi, or television fan. The appearance of Big Bads Spike and Drusilla is a refreshing change from the old fashioned Master, and their dysfunctional relationship gives another dimension to vampiric life. The season hits its hearbreaking climax in Innocence, after Angel and Buffy consummate their relationship, and Buffy's slow realization that her boyfriend is gone is painful and entertaining to watch.",1101081600,,543,5.252873563218391
1259311,5,B000035Z1R,"It's a tough race, but I give this one the nod over season 3 as the best BTVS season ever. David Boreanaz really shows his acting range in this season and the final season arc telling the story of the doomed Angel/Buffy romance was engaging and nail biting.  I was never a fan of the Angel/Buffy romance and didn't get emotionally attached but the last ten episodes made for some great edge of your seat drama.  One of the high points of this season was more screentime for Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), the most underrated regular cast member, who was really underused in season 1.  She's hilarious and is not shy about dissing Buffy when necessary (an important contrast since most of the other characters often agree with Buffy as if she can do no wrong)yet she continues to evolve into a three dimensional chracter from the  stereotypical shallow popular girl she was at the start of season one.

Two underrated episodes of note:""Reptile Boy"" in which Cordelia and Buffy go to a frat party and nearly end up sacrificed to a demon.  David Greenwalt's commentary is great too.  I noticed a couple of reviews that say Greenwalt's commentary is not good and all he does is comment about what's on screen.  They must have switched it off before the end when he reveals how the episode was originally supposed to end.  The other is ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered"" in which Xander enlists Amy (the fantastic Elizabeth Anne Allen, introduced in the season one episode ""Witch"")to cast a spell to make Cordelia love him, but it backfires and every girl except Cordelia loves him.

I have seen several reviews that complain about the picture quality.  The show was on a tight budget the first two years and used a lower grade of film, nothing wrong with the DVD transfer, that's how the episodes first aired.  The picture quality on the DVD certainly beats out taping an episode off of FX.  Should Whedon have upgraded the film for the DVD release?  No, because then the ""purists"" would read him the riot act about how he should preserve the classic BTVS episodes in their original state (you know those people that wont' get off George Lucas' back for the changes to his first Star Wars trilogy).  Joss couldn't win.  I recommend getting season one first, but if you must get just one season, this is the best one to get and with only 12 episode gone by, not much to catch up on.",1100995200,3,2380,4.630952380952381
1259312,5,B000035Z1R,"Season 2 was awesome.  The love, the sex, the killing, the drama, the laughter all contributed to making this Buffy's second or third best season (behind 3 and maybe 7).  Really what this season comes down to though is the introduction of the character that is arguably more popular than the title character herself.  That character is the 100% bad@$$ Spike.

In ""School Hard,"" the third episode of the season, Spike, and his psychotic psychic vampire lover Drusilla are introduced to Sunnydale in an amazingly terrifying episode.  James Marsters makes Spike not only the best Buffy villain of all time, but the most awesome with an amazing adeptness that will never be seen by a television actor ever again.  Spike is the quintessential hardcore villain that the good guy can't wait to get rid of, but cannot leave because the audience is so entranced by the villain's every move.

Spike revolutionized Buffy when he appeared on the scene.  Six years later when he moved to Angel, he did it again.  Season 2 is great for Buffy and the scoobys, but it's unbelievably amazing because of Spike.",1100822400,2,1092,4.827956989247312

David was incredible in this season as were James and Juliet. This season was what really got me hooked on the show. Almost all of my favourite Buffy episodes are part of this season!

  Since this season has the big fight scene with Buffy and Angel, many fans claim this is the best series.  But we really cant look at a series as a whole, you have to look at the ups and downs of the series.  As i said before, I believe the middle of this particulary season with all of season 3,4 are the best of Buffy, but I know many of you will not agree with me.  The love matches made in this series are-to me-even more interesting than the Buffy/Angel, lovers/enemies storyline.  For example, Xander and Cordelia, whose rocky romance is very...I cant think of a word, but if you remember the episodes, you know the feeling.  Even the Oz/Willow romance is starting up.  Thats a plus.

The only episode I didn't extremely like was the Inca Mummy Girl, it seems like Xander should find a true, TRUE love that doesn't have a problem.",1097020800,,1003,4.338709677419355

You know you're watching a great piece of television when you see episodes like 'Becoming Part one and two', 'Innocence', and 'Passion'.

1259341,5,B000035Z1R,"A few years ago, had you told me that I would have thought that ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" was one of the best shows on television, I would have recommended a CAT scan of your brain, and a psychiatric evaluation.

Today, after finishing the second season DVD package, I would owe you a deep, heartfelt apology. Or I would need a CT and a shrink myself. Season Two amplifies on the promise of season One, and then soars to become a modern epic.

The show is laugh-out-loud funny, jump-from -your-seat scary, and makes-you-swoon romantic.

The high school drama on the show is about as good as the travails of high school have ever been put to screen. ""My So-Called Life"" and ""Freaks and Geeks"" I consider to be the highpoints. This gets close, and it's only PART of the show.

The monsters (Buffy's own ""freaks and geeks"" if you will) are movie-quality good. Note the homages to all the classic Universal creatures during this season. Besides the vampires, you have an episode modelled after ""Frankenstein/Bride of Frankenstein"", you have a ""Wolfman"" episode,  and you have a ""Creature of the Black Lagoon"" episode.

The Shakespearean romance between Buffy and Angel is done amazingly well. It feels more real and intense than pretty much anything else on ""normal"" TV at the moment. The tragedy inherent in their relationship threads throughout the season, culminating in the last few minutes of the finale. I was emotionally involved in a way I would have never imagined...again...in a show called ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer.""

The characters are a joy to spend time with. Xander, Cordy, Willow, Giles, Miss Calendar, Spike, Dru...their chemistry creates an ensemble comparable to something like ""The West Wing"" or ""MASH"". They've all become essential.

Then there is something I will call passion. There is a passion behind the creation of these episodes that infuses every inch of your TV screen. A passion for quality, a passion for depth (who'd have thunk...), a passion for telling a grand story...there is one episode, the title I've given away...that had me on the brink of tears.

""Buffy"" had a 40-year-old trauma surgeon on the brink of tears. How is this possible?  Will I start TiVo-ing Oprah next? Or worse, The Lifetime Network?

No. This is impossibly good television doing it's job. Making you think. Making you care. Involving you.

And I see from other reviewers that subsequent seasons are considered ""better"". I need to prepare myself for more sleepless nights...",1095465600,3,2481,4.951807228915663

The mixture of drama, comedy and science fiction is great.  All the actors and actress this season make you actually feel the emtions of the episode.  The way the producers and writers handled social issues especially Buffy losing her virginity was amazing.  They showed great craftmenship in the writing.  The shows were tight in all manners from writing, acting and special effects.  The Spike/Drussilla and then Angelus villians were brillient because it allow Buffy to face certain aspects of her life that was missing in the first season.  The Buffy-Angel romance and break up was compelling and very powerful.  The music score and soundtrack to the season just added so much to the show.

1259365,5,B000035Z1R,"This is the season that made me love the show. This is the season that has the most impact of any season in the show's history. Spike, Angel, and Dru need I say more?

Well I am going to anyway. The turn of Angel was gutsy and needed. The avoidance of the after sex cliche was perfect. Angel loses his soul and David proves that he is a great villian. IMHO Angelus is perfect and should supplant Angel for good. Devilishly devious and the most effective villian against Buffy. His interaction with Spike and Dru is well done and gives Spike the first inkling of sympathy.

The season is well crafted into two parts. B.A.(Before Angelus) and A.A.(After Angelus). The intro of Spike ep. 3 B.A. is a highlight of the entire series. Right off the bat he steals every scene he is in and is downright hilarious. His removal of the kid was much appreciated and he immediately became my favorite character. B.A. the show lacked direction since the main villian was Spike and he had no greater purpose or direction. He was the Gen-X villian it would seem. The shows were entertaining but really were just pure fun. Then came Surprise/Innocence and the show moved to A.A.

Angel was the champion guy that made all the hopelessly romantic girls swoon. Now they watched in horror as he ripped Buffy's lovemaking skills and happily blew her off. This is the point that the show first proved that it had courage. A main character is offed by Angelus further cementing his villany. He and Spike clash as alpha males often do and history is made.

The last episode is poetry with Buffy and Angelus fighting it out over the safety of the world. I won't ruin it for those that haven't seen it. I'll just say after season 5 this is the best ending to a season.",1093651200,2,1741,4.482649842271293
1259366,5,B000035Z1R,"All the characters just shines in this season. especially Buffy and Angel. Angel turning evil is just the best twist of all. You totally see a whole different Angel and from it a whole different Buffy. It also revealed to fate of the relationships between Buffy and Angel- that a vampire and a human just don't work. instead of the soul saving Angel from his evil self ( which is what it seemed at first, the whole tortured by guilt was rather empty before) it revealed the true nature and torment of Angel's curse, . The point that it was Angel's demon who committed all the crimes, yet Angel had to take on the guilt and punishment of it. Buffy learned the lesson from this, she did not realize Angel's soul was for tormenting purposes and gave him happiness, which really freed Angel from his torment at the expense for the ending of their relationship, and the danger of the ending of the world. Becoming was a fabulous season finale, it marked the fate of Angel- the point that his place belong in hell so he couldn't recieve happiness again (and again shows the cruety of it because Angel again had to take on the guilt he did not really commit). It also marked the fate of Buffy, the realization of the cruety of her duty. Becoming was truly heartbreaking and the season is fabulous",1092873600,,1289,4.48936170212766

Here is where we get the first half of the tragic Buffy<=>Angel love story. Here is where we get Spike (James Marsters is so good he managed to stay on the show for six seasons, and then move to the 5th and last season of Angel). Here we also get a good chunk of the ""vampire pre-history"": the background on the relations and relationships of Angel, Darla, Drusilla and Spike (that line will continue for another season of ""Buffy"", and then for another two of ""Angel"").

The show as we know it is just about in full force here already except for the lack of Faith: that bucket of joy has to wait until Season Three. Several episodes might be slightly on the weakish side: birth pains, really, nothing terrible.

1259369,5,B000035Z1R,"It's their junior year of High School, and the summer after Buffy slayed the Master is over.  We join our main cast, Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Xander (Nicholas Brendon), Willow (Alyson Hannigan), Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), Angel (David Boreanaz), and Mr. Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), in the first actual full season of BTVS.

In a very brief sense, Buffy comes back from spending time with her father in California kind of different, and a bit more mean.  She seems just a little too anxious to start slaying vampires again, and is pushing all her friends away, including Angel.  As it progresses, it ends up she's still upset and wired about the Master, as she's still having nightmares.  That problem gets taken care of.  And so we delve into a very emotional seasonal storyline, including the introduction of Spike (James Marsters), Drusilla (Juliet Landau), and Oz (Seth Green) as regular season characters, as many difficult occurences enter the worlds of our heroes such as Angel's soul, a powerful demon that can eradicate anything with just one look, death of the Anointed One, The order of Taraka, a new slayer, new love affairs, and love lost.

Some of the best episodes include:  When She Was Bad, What's My Line, Surprise, Innocence, Passion, Bewitched Bewildered Bothered, I Only Have Eyes For You, and The Becoming.  This is a very important season to watch, and is 100% necessary for any Buffy fan to buy this set.",1090281600,,1439,4.937759336099585
1259370,4,B000035Z1R,"After the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, fans knew that the show could only get better, and season two definately brought the show to a whole new level. Season two had so many things working for it, from the introduction of my favorite character Spike and Buffy's relationship with Angel heating up, to the introduction of Angel's darkside Angelus who turned out to be one of the show's greatest villans. Now season two is very good and I definately enjoyed it. However, I also feel that the season is overrated because many fans of the show think that season two is the show's best season, when seasons three, five, and six were much better overall. I mean, let's be honest here. There were some really bad episodes in this season like - ""Some Assembly Required"", ""Ted"", ""Reptile Boy"", ""Inca Mummy Girl"", ""Bad Eggs"", and ""Go Fish"". In order for a season to be worthy of a five star rating, it needs to be great from start to finish, with a minimum number of bad episodes.
The second season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer does feature some wonderful episodes however that manage to make up for season two's shortcomings. ""School Hard"" is one of my all time favorite episodes because it introduced my favorite character Spike. The bad ass leather clad vampire proved to be so popular, that the writers ended up keeping him around for the rest of the show. The classic episode ""Halloween"" has everyone turn into whatever they dressed up as for Halloween. ""Bewitched, Bothered And Bewildered"" is another one of my all time favorites and is definately a candidate for funniest episode ever. When Cordelia dumps Xander on Valentine's Day, he seeks help in a witch at Suunydale High named Amy to cast a spell on Cordelia to make her fall in love with him. Unfortunately, Xander ends up becoming the object of every woman's affection in Sunnydale. The two best Buffy/Angel episodes of the entire show are ""Suprise"" and ""Innocence"" in which their relationship ascends to a new level, and we are introduced to Angel's darkside Angelus who turns out to be one of the best villans ever. Season two comes to an amazing conclusion in ""Becoming"" parts 1&2. Other episodes worth mentioning are ""What's My Line"" parts 1&2, ""Passion"", ""Phases"", and ""I Only Have Eyes of You"".
Even though season two is not quite as good as a lot of people claim, it is still a highly enjoyable and definately worth owning. What really makes the season two DVD set special is the bonus features. The set has many featurettes and interviews, as well as commentary on several episodes.

1259371,5,B000035Z1R,This is by far the best season of Buffy the Vampire slayer.  I thouhgt the relationship between Angel and Buffy really catapulted the show.  The acting was excellent as always from the actors and the writing and creativity of Joss was really good.  I am glad I have this season in my DVD collection,1087776000,2,298,4.481481481481482
1259372,5,B000035Z1R,"Season 2 is one of the best seasons of Buffy not only because of the Buffy-Angel romance (which, I would imagine, is what draws most of this season's interest), but also because of Joss Whedon's examination of the nature of good and evil during this season.  The arrival of Spike (at this point, the antithesis of Angel) to Sunnydale signals the arrival of the ""big bad"".  While Spike and Drusilla plot the elimination of the entire world, Buffy has no clue that the biggest bad is right beside her... in Angel.
Outside of the obligatory running vampire arc, the other episodes this season all really deal with the nature of good and evil and identity, shadowing the arc with the vampires.  The Halloween episode (where the characters become their costumes) is nothing short of hillarious with Buffy prancing around as a helpless ladylike debutante.  Its interesting to see what each character would be like if just one thing about them was changed - if Buffy didn't have strength, if Xander was confident and ""manly,"" etc.  Another interesting episode is the Dark Age when the consequences of Giles' past come back to haunt him... and those he loves.  Hillarious and harrowing is Ted, the episode with guest star John Ritter as Joyce's boyfriend/robot serial killer.  The most interesting part of the episode is the few minutes when both Buffy and Joyce think that Buffy has killed Ted and how they handle it.
Finally, of course, is Buffy's now consumated romance with Angel which ultimately causes him to lose his soul and become his former murderous self.  The pain that Buffy goes through is intense and many girls can relate to it at a romantic level.  When Buffy is ultimately forced to kill Angel (with his soul returned to him), both Buffy and the audience is grief-striken.
The season works well as a whole - possibly the best of all the seasons.  Each episode, though whole onto itself, moves the characters and stories toward the ultimate goal of examining the good and evil in each of them and what each of their identities entail.",1086998400,3,2043,4.778409090909091
1259391,5,B000035Z1R,"If you thought that it couldn't get any better than the first season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", they you were 'dead' wrong. Now, with the show fully in motion and a hard core audience viewing, ""Buffy"" is for sure becoming a classic and great television show. Not to mention, this second season is the best season of ""Buffy"" over all- without a doubt. It builds on the relationships, has a great story once again, and has a perfectly assembled cast. Don't stop your collection with season one, be sure to get the 'Best of ""Buffy""'- season two.
First, the tangled web of relationships from season one gets even more tangled in this season. Season two starts out with the same love story- Willow (Alyson Hannigan) loves Xander (Nicholas Brendan), Xander loves Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Buffy loves Angel (David Boreanaz), Angel is a vampire. But as the story moves on, the characters begin to split and find other people to fall in love with. Willow, for one, falls in love with a socially strange guy named Oz (Seth Green), who is also a lead guitarist in a band titled ""Dingoes Ate My Baby"". Besides that, Willow discovers that her first boyfriend is more than just a cool quiet guy, but he's also something dark underneith. Xander finds his first girlfriend to be the one person he truly does not like, the self-centered Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter). As the two try to hide their feelings for each other, they are drawn out, and eventually, have to reaveal themselves to their friends, creating tension between Willow and Xander. Buffy lives her life dieing to be with Angel, and when the two finally do connect, serious and heartbreaking consequences occur. Meanwhile, Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) and Jenny (Robia LaMorte) have a budding romance that also ends in tears. Also, the villains have a great relationship. They are the punk vampire Spike (James Marsters) and the insane vampire Dru (Juliet Landau). Their relationship also has challenges and makes the couple even more appealing and fun to watch knowing that they care for each other as Buffy cares for Angel. Without question, the relationships of this season could make a show in themselves, and add so much more to anticipate.
Second, the story follows as a great work of art that only Joss Wheadon, the creator, could have thought of. Besides the disasterous soap opera going on within the relationships, the story arc for the season is just amazing. Spike and Dru are perfect villains, but when tradgedy strikes and Angel's soul is taken, he turns into the killer and monsterous vampire Angelus, who teams up with Spike and Dru to end the world in several ways. From battling the Master's last minions to fighting Angelus, from fighting a demon that steals the humanity from people to stopping a demon from sucking the world into hell, Buffy's second season is a perfect mix of grief, joy, chills, thrills, laughs, romance, sci-fi, and mythology.
Finally, the cast is once again unbeatable. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Buffy with such emotion that truly deserves an award for all she puts into it. Alyson Hannigan steps up and makes Willow more interesting and complex from season one's dull Willow. Nicholas Brendan does a great job as some humer with Xander. Anthony Stewart Head is even better this time around as he gets to interact more with his slayer and begins to develope a fatherly relationship with her. David Boreanaz does a wonderful job changing from a good hero to an all out evil villain. James Marsters and Juliet Landau are a lovable yet hateful couple, which is exactly what they are meant to be. You just won't be able to get enough of them. Charisma Carpenter plays the loud mouthed Cordelia as a funny and likable girl, while Seth Green plays the quiet Oz as a mysterious and great guy. Kristine Sutherland once again plays Joyce, who gets even more screen time as Buffy's mother who just doesn't know what to do with her daughter. The guest stars are still great, and John Ritter tops it off as a step dad who's just a tad evil. Joss Wheadon created the best television show and his ideas are just so unpredictable and fun.
To conclude, this is a great show with great relationships that could have an show on their own, a great story with pure heartbreak, and a great cast and crew that puts the show where it all is. Although it is just the beginning, it's still the best of the series. Season Two is a must for anyone who is even interested in buying this DVD, and be sure to continue your collection and complete it with all seven seasons of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""",1086739200,4,4574,4.7330827067669174

This season has every element that makes Buffy such a success. The amazing storyline and chemistry between Sarah Michelle Gellar and David Boreanez, and who could forget the introduction of Spike and Drusilla!  They also were two characters that really made the episodes a lot more interesting than the first season episodes.  Cordelia and Xander's very surprising and cute love affair was a shock and a delight to watch as it was very amusing and funny.  We also get introduced to Angel's evil side ""Angelus"" who adds more action and emotion to the show.  Having Buffy fighting her lover and being forced to push aside her love for Angel is a real fight for her and Sarah plays it wonderfully.  The reason I think Season 2 is by far the best season is because of Angel/Angelus, the introduction of Spike and Drusilla, and the drama and pain and whirling emotions everyone had to deal with which were so much stronger than the first season or any other season for that matter.

It starts a bit slowly but the first half of the season introduces some really great new characters(such as Spike).It also has its batch of masterpieces such as School Hard and Lie to Me. Also,it is just more entertaining than season one,already. Things really pick up with the second half,however. The Angelus story arc has never really been outdone as far as emotional story arcs go and is one of the greatest achievements of the show,ever. Hell,Becoming is my favorite episode(both parts)of the entire show. Okay,Innocence and Passion are big contenders,also. There are many other great episodes,too. Season two really starts to develop the characters and flesh them out even more. We get to know about Giles' past and Cordelia starts to date Xander for example. It's also the season that started to go more in the grey area instead of just black and white. Basically,we can consider season two the most important season of Buffy because it made the show into the greatness it's become. I must also mention that Angelus is a favorite of mine as a Big Bad. Unfortunately,season two is a little overrated at the same time. Some episodes are really bad(Reptile Boy,Killed by Death) and the season does not fully pick up until the second half. The good outweighs the bad but considering I see no real flaw with some other seasons,I consider season two a little overrated,indeed. Season two is must-own for Buffy fans. It makes season one look only okay in comparison and its best episodes will always stand as some of the greatest tv ever made,even outdoing season one's Prophecy Girl. The dvds are fine with a decent amount of extras but with average picture quality due to the 16 mm film. The menus are annoying. They look good but I don't like them too much.

A Buffy fan to the end, I can truly say that the second season is when it all clicked:  each character's personalities culminated in a spectacular 22 episodes of comedy, horror and shocking disbelief.  As now our dear Buffy and Scooby Gang are dearly departed, I encourage you to pop some popcorn, make yourself cozy in your favorite chair and watch the best darn season Buffy had to offer!... and the extras on the DVD set ain't half bad either!",1085184000,,531,4.510416666666667

In the second season, however, it clicked. The writing was witty and intelligent, the relationships between the characters were hilarious and heartfelt, and of course, the legendary story arc of the season was...well, legendary! There are a few so-so episodes here (""Some Assembly Required,"" ""Reptile Boy,"" etc.) but overall the episodes were great. Some of TV's best hours are here, and no one should miss it. Humor, angst, wit, and heart are all found here in Buffy's second exhilarating year at Sunnydale High.",1085184000,,665,5.110091743119266
1259398,5,B000035Z1R,"This was a great improvement over an already great show.  The characters start to develop more and become more than just archtypes.  Xander and Cordelia fall for each other breaking all rules of status in High School.  Willow finds a love interest in the rebellious genius Oz(seth green).  Buffy falls more and more for Angel, the noble vampire with a soul.  As well as adding some of the most loved vampires on the show.  The rebellious Spike(aka William the Bloody) and the insane seer Drusilla(interestingly enough the same name as the sister of Roman Ceaser Caligula).
Here are some of the high points.
Some Assembly Required:  a disturbing look at lonlieness and what a boy is willing to do for his brother.
Halloween:  A funny take on a magical spell creating chaos over the town.  It also introduces a person from Giles's checkered past, something they previously hadn't touched on.
Lie To Me:  A former friend of buffy's returns to town, but is acting strange.  He has something to do with a cult that worships vampires as well as possibly Spike and Drusilla.
What's My Line? 1&2:  They introduce another slayer, one with a horrible accent, must have taken lessons from ms cleo.  A big bad is renewed and another is crippled.
Innocence:  Angel looses his soul and becomes Angelus, an insanely cruel and sadistic vampire.  He then starts stalking Buffy and the rest of the scoobies with zeal.
Phases:  Oz turns out to have a secret that runs in the family.
Bewitched, Bothered And Bewildered:  A funny tale of Xander using magic to try to get Cordelia back.  Only it fails to affect her at all but every woman he comes across falls madly in love with him.
Passion:  A dark and intense episode, showing how devious and cruel Angelus can be.
Becoming 1&2:  Angelus, Drusilla, and Spike have a demon that could suck this reality into hell, and they are willing to use it once they can figure it out.  But the allegences aren't as clear as they were before, and the scoobies must unite to stop them.  A classic end of season two parter for one of the best seasons available.

1259400,5,B000035Z1R,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer really came into its own in its brilliant second season.
This season introduced an extraordinary new villain, the charismatic vampire Spike, superbly played by James Marsters.  Spike's partner Drusilla, a mystically crazed vampire who sees strange visions and longs to destroy the world, is a less successful creation.  Also introduced in this season is Oz (Seth Green), who becomes a love interest for Willow, allowing her to drop her childish infatuation with Xander and mature as an individual, and Jenny Calendar, who provides a bittersweet love interest for Giles.  Comic relief is provided by Principal Snyderman, well played by Armin Shimerman, who becomes the nemesis of Buffy and her friends at Sunnydale High.
In the main story arc of the season, another 'new' character is shockingly introduced in the episode, ""Innocence"".  Angel, the good vampire who Buffy has fallen in love with, is suddenly reborn as his evil self, and we learn that Ms Calendar has been hiding a dark secret.
Buffy struggles to cope with betrayal by her lover and the realization that she may have to kill the man she loves.  This sets up the plot arc that drives the second half of the season to a shattering conclusion in the two part season finale.  The final moments are unforgettable.  This is where BTVS transcends mere entertainment and becomes truly great television.
It isn't all wonderful.  Some episodes fall flat, such as ""Ted"", where the late John Ritter does a guest shot, and ""Go Fish"", where Buffy investigates the mysterious disappearance of members of the swim team.  But even the weak episodes have some redeeming moments - Cordelia's speech when she thinks Xander has been transformed into a fish is priceless.",1083196800,2,1739,5.031358885017422
1259411,5,B000035Z1R,"I think this easily was the best of the Buffy seasons. I loved every season, and each one is great in its own way, but I think when it comes to great TV drama, season two is the winner.
So much happens in this season. We see: Buffy and Angel together, and Angel turns bad; we see a glimpse into Giles' past, Giles and Jenny, and Jenny's demise;  Oz and Spike are introduced, Willow and Oz get together; Cordy and Xander get together. A lot happens, but it isn't overwhelming, the pacing is just right.
The seasonal arc with Angel losing his soul was just the best arc of the show, and ""Becoming"" was, in my opinion, the single (including both parts) best episode of the entire show. I've seen it dozens of times, and I still get goosebumps when I watch the ending. Simply amazing.
I thought both season 5 & season 3 were spectacular, but this season still beats it out (IMO the order of seasons from worst to best would be 7, 6, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, just for arguments sake). If you're a fan of the show, obviously you must have this.  But even if you've never seen the show before, if you're a fan of great television, this is must see.",1082592000,2,1131,4.207373271889401

I can imagine the torture for people who watched it when it was on tv when this season ended and they had to wait for the next. I big improvement over the first season because of the money obviously put into the show. What people really didn't notice about the show it seems is that some of the actors are extremely talented regardless of how campy this show may be sometimes. I recommend this to people who feel negatively toward this show now.,1081900800,,537,4.326732673267327
1259414,5,B000035Z1R,"I very much enjoyed the first Season Volume of Buffy. Each episode (with the exception of the last one) was good lighthearted fun. The ending left me wanting to know what happened next. But wanting to know what happened next in a, whenever I get around to buying the next volume, kind of way, And frankly sometimes I need a little help getting motivated. Fortunately, while doing some grocery shopping I found the second season and like the first season grabbed it on an impulse. The first season got me interested; the second season got me hooked.
The theme from the first season was all about starting out and getting a feel for things. I think the theme for this season is about love as every character falls into sort of a love triangle with each other. Fortunately towards the end each character kind of resolves his or her issues and finds true love with someone.
The first episode shows that as a result of each characters experience in the previous season that each character now has grown a little darker. But that edge is suppressed a little as the first half of the season presents stories more akin in feeling to the tales if the past year. While little is moved forwards in terms of a story arc, a lot of these episodes are pure gold. Episodes with Spike are just great, The Halloween episode is phenomenal and an episode with John Ritter as a guest star had me giggling with pure glee.
And then the second half of the season starts and everything gets ripped to shreds and then goes to hell very quickly. While earlier Buffy and Angel had time to establish a romance, after a night of passion some seriously dire consequences begin to affect all the characters. I think this is the first truly dramatic arc that really lets the audience know that bad things are going to happen to these characters and it's going to take more then one episode for them to get over it.
The second season takes the groundwork laid down by the first and adds to it with the introduction a few more of the greatest characters and plottwists that will effect the entire series. It also continues the tradition by presenting some imaginative monsters and great witty dialog. But it's the heart breaking love story between Buffy and Angel that propels Buffy from a simple teen drama to one of my very favorite shows.",1080345600,,2306,4.559036144578314

1259416,5,B000035Z1R,"Buffy season two is the first complete season of the show (Season One having started half way through the television season).  It is a great one.  Some of the most memorable episodes are in this season, including ""Halloween"", ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered"", ""Becoming"", and ""Innocence"".  The season is filled with ups and downs, with Buffy and the Scoobies duking it out with evil demons and eventually one of their closest friends.
This season also introduces several of the greatest characters the show has ever seen.  The first is Spike, who in my opinion, is the greatest character Joss Whedon has ever created.  The second is Drusilla, Spikes psychic, psycho, vampire girlfriend.  The third is Oz, played by a very funny Seth Green.  The show adds Angel as a full time cast member without dropping any of the main characters from season one.
This season easily sets the bar high for following seasons.  The stories are incredible with every emotion known to man impacting the viewer at least once throughout.  After watching this season, the viewer is well aware how brilliant of a television show this is.  You find yourself really relating to several of the characters in this season.

1259418,5,B000035Z1R,"The second season of BTVS was energized with a mission. Having totally distanced itself from a campy low-budget 1992 movie, there was no doubt this version of Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) was authentic. More sure of itself, the series took some interesting storyline risks which definently paid off in the immediate and long-run.
Season two is the series which many long-time fans (such as myself) remember with incredible fondness because of the wide range of roller-coaster emotions invoked without gratuitous soap. The budding relationship between the slayer and ensouled vampire Angel (David Boreanaz) was a major theme this season.
Attempting to be like the girls Angel knew during his own 18th century Ireland youth, Buffy purchases a costume from a new magic shop. Unbeknownst to her, this costume is haunted, and she is forced to actually act like a noble woman (issusing pronouncements against women's litteracy and independent thinking). Ironically one benefit of his transformation allowed Angel to see the progression of women's rights, and consequently meet women that he genuinely found interesting.
And then of course, we have the pivotal two-parter where Angel looses his soul after a night of spontaneous passion with Buffy. The famed gypsy curse has a very important clause which prohibits his sexual activity; one moment of true happiness unleashes the monster known as Angelus. After seeing David as the strait-laced Angel, his playful side in Angelus was both disturbing and interesting. Buffy previously slayed many vampires, but she never actually felt for one---instead viewing the task as mundane and robotic.
In addition to the episodes, this DVD has so many extra features for the devoted BTVS fan. The behind the scenes extras convey how much time and dedication really go into these episodes.",1076803200,2,1822,5.307958477508651

Spike is freaking HILARIOUS..And he is without a doubt a scene stealer..And the chemistry between Spike and Druscilla is Pure or should i say Evil Magic through and through..SPIKE RULES..The people behind this show say they modeled them both after ""Sid and Nancy""..I can see that but even more Spike resembles that of Billy ""Rebel YeLL"" Idol..Another standout episode is ""Halloween"" in the words of Spike that episode ""Isn't this just....Neat????""..Definatly one going for the full comedy..My question why would WiLLow want to cover herself up like that..I don't want to say what i mean coz it will ruin it lets just say that this is the first time that WiLLow makes herself look that way..WiLLow is sexy anyway wait til you see her here..Another standout episode is "".....Bewitched....."" *can't remember the full title of episode and the box set is currently being borrowed by a friend*..In it Xander gets too much attension from the opposite sex..Another question how can he turn down WiLLow and BuFFy?? But hey i guess anything is possible on tv right..Between the ""Halloween"" and "".....Bewitched....."" episodes you may have a hard time getting your breath from laughing so hard..This season 2 you will also have loads of sight gags i won't ruin it by listing them..But all i say is watch carefully..One i would have done better..There is one part where WiLLow has a ScOOby Doo shirt on..I would have put them in ScOOby shirts that are most like them..Like Willow = Velma / BuFFy = Daphne / Angel = Fred / Xander = Shaggy..This is also the season where Angel goes evil villian..And when he does you can see how much funnier villians are..When he is good Angel he is more serious..But when he gets to be evil Angel he all of suddon becomes more like Spike..And Angel is letting the one liners fly..And Angel then gets funny and a great addition to Spike and Dru..In a interview the actor who plays ""Spike"" said ""Spike isn't really a bad guy all he needs is some Mother's love and some chocolate milk""..I think that sums up the silly corniness of this show and that is just way we love it..This Season 3 of BuFFy just keeps getting better with every episode *though i do feel that ""Bad Eggs"" was somewhat a weak effort but that is just my opinion*..BuFFy the Vampire Slayer is the ONLY modern day show that can be called an Instant Classic and can stand up along side shows that we grew up on..Nothing is as fun as BuFFy..It is very addicting..Brilliant show that never loses it's bites or blOOdy kiSSeS...Long Live BuFFy & The ScOObieS and of course Angel Dru and Spike too......",1074902400,,3318,4.722413793103448

She's also able to get over Xander to some extent and starts a relationship with lead guitarist of Dingoes Ate My Baby, Oz (Daniel Osbourne).",1073692800,,496,4.522222222222222
1259431,5,B000035Z1R,"Awesome gruesome battle scenes, tragic love story, and amazing acting by the entire cast are just three ways to explain the second season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This season achieves marvelously weaving through broken hearts and broken bones. It has intelligence, wit, and humor but will make you cry your eyes out at the same time. Buffy once again has the role of saving the world from the dark demons who plan to demolish it but fail. This season has more emotion and depth than alot of other series out there and was very overlooked by the emmys, one for Gellars stunning performances and the entire show.
Allison Hannigan takes on the adorable role of geeky and shy Willow who falls in love with her best friend who falls in with the school's popular ditsy Cordelia, OH BOY! So many love traingles, so little time. The season was filled with so much emotion and amazing climaxes it was hard to find a favorite episode but by far the final conlusion of the series was a marvelous closure. It may have been the ending but only started a new beginning to an excellent third-season.
Buffy is without a doubt one of the best shows on television, although I started to break away from it episode by episode ever since it turned to the UPN. After that it seemed like everything flopped and I didn't even catch the seires finale! So I am patiently waiting for that to come out on DVD so I can catch up on the rollercoaster life of Buffy.

1259433,5,B000035Z1R,"""Well, we could grind our enemies into taucum powder with a sledgehammer, but gosh, we did that last night.:
 - Xander
That really sums up the second season of Buffy. It builds on what it laid to foundation with the first (and sadly short) season, and shoots into hyperdrive to tell great stories, explore the chracters, the world, and the themes of the show. Sure, we did that last night, but it was  fun.
The relationship between Buffy, the average girl-turned-mankind's-last-hope and Angel, the vampire with a tortured soul, is at the center of the main story thread of season two, and is handled with delicacy and grace, and with unflinching tragedy. There are some disturbing echoes of abusive relationships in the real world here, along with the overtones of how people you think you know can change horribly. Of course, it's also just good Buffy.
The main characters are all back from season one, and all of them grow while still remaining true to their roots. In addition, some really nifty new characters show up, including the duty-first slayer, Kendra, the insane vampire who Angel sired when he was still evil, Druscilla, the coolest werewolf ever, Oz, and everyone's favorite leather-clad pottymouth, William the Bloody, Spike to you. Of all of these characters, Spike rises into the ranks of Buffy greatness with style and fun to spare, holding his own against the brooding Angel and the feisty Buffy, even though the two lovebirds have more experience under their belts. No wonder Wedon decided to make him a mainstay.
However, where things really turn spectacular is the revelation of the full extent of Angel's curse, courtesy of some vengeful gypsies. He will be burdened with a soul for all time, unless he experiences a moment of true happiness. Guess what he and Buffy do.
This storyline plays out so well, and pulls on so many heartstrings, it's out-emotes any tragic romance ever made for TV, and a lot that weren't. David Boreanaz really shows his acting chops as he transforms from the brooding but sweet Angel to the wholly evil Angelus. Angelus is so different from all of Buffy's other villains, mainly because he's Angel's polar opposite, someone who enjoys causing pain so much. It's downright spooky to see Boreanaz playing the role so well. This change of character is best displayed after Angelus has killed a character close to the Scooby gang, and we hear Boreanaz doing a voice-over concerning the need for and pain of passion. This is good TV making.
The DVD features a set of extras similar to the first, and a slightly better video and audio transfer. Of course, the fact that there are twenty-two juicy episodes in this collection makes it look all the more tasty to Buffy fans, and anyone who enjoys some good vampire action should check this out.

The characters had started to develop as we get to know more about them especially Cordelia on how she's not all that shallow! =P  As a Buffy and Angel fan, that is one reason why I loved this season soo much.  Seeing Buffy lose her innocence to the man/vamp she loves and to be the reason for Angel going all *drool* evilly Angelus just broke my heart!
The fight scene in the finale in Becoming Part 2 just kicked-butt!  A lot of action with the swords and seeing Angelus in tight leather pants... I'm not complaining. ^_~ hee hee

1259435,5,B000035Z1R,"Season 2 of Buffy had one of the most moving conclusions ever written in television.  Essentially the big evil to be fought with this season is Spike and Drusilla, a bonnie and clyde-esque vampire couple, who eventually team up with Buffy's former boyfriend Angel, who loses his soul after a special night.
The cast is essentially the same as season 1, with Angel becoming a new regular on the show.  One of the key themes of this season is that of love, and in most cases, the call of duty in conflict with love.
Standout episodes and twists occur when Kendra, a second vampire slayer is introduced (after Buffy dies momentairly in Season 1, a new slayer was called).  The two girls are polar opposites and provide some humor and insight into the life of the slayer.  Other new storylines emerge, such as Willow and Oz's blossoming love in episodes like ""Career Week"".  Xander and Cordelia begin (and more or less end) their relationship as well.  Buffy and Angels relationship reaches an emotional climax (haha) and they are torn apart shortly after in the episode ""innocence"".  Also this season boasts one of the best and most influential Halloween episodes (Xanders military training need I say more) where the Scooby Gang is transformed into the costumes they buy in the episode aptly titled ""Halloween""
As new orders of evil are released to reign havoc in all of the slayerettes lives, Buffy is finally faced with a heart-wrenching decision that isn't helped by last minute turns of events, leading to one of the most emotional finales ever.  All in all, this season is similar to season one, wiht a lot more individual demons to battle, but the general evil 'bad guy' of the season has a lot more influence throughout the story.  A good season for a number of reasons, if not the finale alone.",1070841600,,1800,4.725239616613418

The beginning few episodes did a wondeful job of introducing what was to come. And as for the actos and actresses, all I can do is congraduate them on their talent and potiental.
This season also has the one of the top tear-jerking episodes out there. Becoming Part 2 being that episode. It was probably one of the best of the season, and showed how connected Angel and Buffy are, and just how much Buffy has to put up with.
If I had to recommend a season, this and seasons 1 & 3 would be just those seasons.

1259437,5,B000035Z1R,"`Buffy the Vampire Slayer' changed my life. I'm not embarassed to admit it either (well, not much...). From vacuous cheerleader to empowered but tragic heroine whose destiny is to sacrifice her own hopes and dreams in order to protect the world from the forces of darkness, `Buffy' has become the embodiment of wise-cracking 20th/21st century existential angst.
The show`s humble beginnings as a belated spin-off from a mediocre movie starring Kirsty Swanson, belie its now revered status as one of the most brilliant TV series ever to have graced the schedules. The introduction of a sassy, short-skirted Californian airhead (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar) with an endless stock of witty one liners, who kicks vampire a** was always going to be a winner, on reflection. Throw in a razor-sharp script, an excellent cast and lots of high-kicking action - after the first few vampires showcase their martial arts prowess, you forget to question where they learned their moves - and you're onto a winner.  However, the real strength of `Buffy' is the brilliance of the characters: Buffy's bookish `watcher' Giles (Anthony Stewart Head); Willow, the techno-geek (Alison Hannygan); the nerdish loser Xander (Nicholas Brendon); Cordelia, the acid-tongued, Prada-loving bimbo (Charisma Carpenter); and Angel, the brooding vampire with a soul (David Boreanaz), as well as the chosen one herself.
Series 2 is where `Buffy' went major league. Lighter on the humour (though still boasting an impeccably sharp script), heavier on the angst, the main theme of the series becomes the doomed love between Buffy and Angel. With Spike and Drusilla, the hilarious `Mockney' vampires (Spike was pitched somewhere between David Bowie's goblin king from `Labyrinth', and Billy Idol), as the new big bad, and an unlikely romance between two of the scoobies, this is probably the best series of `Buffy' (though series 3 runs it mighty close). The two part `What's My Line', `Surprise', `Passion' and `Killed By Death' are all absolute classic episodes, but it is the awesome finale `Becoming' which elevates the series to near-epic status, and truly makes for some of the finest TV viewing ever. I won't give away too much in the way of plot, but suffice to say the show kicks on, and then some, from Series 1.
It's not too late to get into `Buffy' if you feel it's passed you by. The good folks at Amazon can set you up with all 7 series now, and I would highly recommend a small financial investment (or better still, a hint to a loved-one for that special stocking filler!).

The second season is where the show really began to pick up momentum as the main characters became more fleshed out, and the show displayed it's first signs of brilliance towards the end of the season when Angel (David Boreanaz) loses his soul and goes evil.  Season 2 was a pivotal season of the series as it introduces the vampires Spike (James Marsters) and Drusilla (Juliet Landau); both of whom would play major parts in the development of the show's story arc's.  Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Angel confessed they're love for one another, and Gellar and Boreanaz both shine in the later episodes when Angel goes bad.  I found myself surprised at how heart wrenching that story arc turned out to be.  Xander (Nicholas Brendon) fell in love with popular girl Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) while Willow (Alyson Hannigan) found love with werewolf by night Oz (Seth Green), and Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) fell for fellow teacher Ms. Calendar (Robia La Morte) in a relationship that would end in tragedy.

This season has the surprising death of Jenny Calendar and the turning of Angel to Angelus who is so fun. When Spike got out of his wheelchair at the end of I Only Have Eyes For You and says ""sooner as you think"" I was like hell yes, this is great and the romantic link of Willow and Oz is great. Though seeing Nicholas Brendon is Speedo shorts is scary to me. and also Xander and Cordelia hook up. The end ep has Spike making a deal with Buffy and the scene when Spike hits Angelus with a crowbar kicked. Spike grabs Dru and drives off, Buffy stabs Angel in the heart and sends him to hell but we all know what happens. Dramatic, great and sexy..a masterpiece of a show..thanks Joss Whedon for making this, I love ya, your my G J-Dog.",1070409600,,1055,4.528795811518324
1259440,5,B000035Z1R,I am writing again to tell you more about this season. To me this season showed more action and more non vampire story lines. In season two Buffy gets into a more serious relationship with Angel(Angel gets to be part of the cast not just a guest star.) Also in this season Xander actually gets a girlfriend. Hint Hint its Cordelia. Willow also gets a boyfriend too. Many changes in love  but now about other things. In this season Spike and Drusilla come. The sad part of this season is Angel turns evil and Buffy has to kill him. So go check this season out its filled with tons of great episodes.,1070150400,,598,4.339285714285714
1259461,5,B000035Z1R,"The second season of buffy started out pretty well.  There was no telling what direction it would go in, no telling what tricks Joss Whedon (creater of the show) had up his sleeve.
We start out with ""When She Was Bad"" not particulary a great episode but a good way to start it all off.  But the way they had Buffy acting it just wasn't part of her character, but we realize that she had a problem dealing with her death from the last season (""Prophacy Girl"").  But from there on the season became something so much more.
You had the introduction of Spike and Drucilla, you had Angel lose his soul and become Angelous, you had Buffy lose her virginity, you had Willow getting a boyfriend, Xander and Cordy hooking up, and a season finalie that would leave you in tears.
""Becoming"" parts I and II were the most amazing episodes in the searies to that point.  They were everything that the show was, and would be.  They were dramatic and wonderful and Buffy's character really came to a new level.  They were the episodes that would change the way the whole series would become.
The second season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was truly the first great season.",1068768000,,1155,4.476190476190476
1259462,5,B000035Z1R,"I remember when I was a kid, a local movie reviewer here in DC gave ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" five stars. This was a big deal because in his entire history of reviewing films, four stars had always been his highest rating. He justified it simply by saying, ""(Raiders) is the perfect example of why we go to the movies in the first place.""

I broke my own rule and gave Season Two five stars, because Buffy as a whole is a perfect example of what TV can do when it is done right, and Season Two is a perfect example of a great show at the highest peak of its energy, creativity, and enthusiasm. Now, before you roll your eyes, I know I pulled a Milhouse in my review of Season One and got a wee bit overstimulated, wearing out the thesaurus with words of praise and sounding like a love-struck geek on too much Adderol, so I promise to be more restrained here and limit myself to a story you Buffy-heads will probably find amusing.

A year ago I moved back to DC from Pennyslvania, and for about 6 months lived with my mom while I looked for an apartment and fumbled around with my new job. During this tough settling-in period, which coincided with the DC area Sniper shooting people every day right on my doorstep, and boy wasn't that a fun time to work in Rockville, MD, I started watching back-to-back Buffy episodes on FX. I had been only a very casual watcher of the show prior to this, but quickly got hooked. Of course, as I lay on the couch in my shirt and tie, drinking beer and eating Triscuits, my 62 year-old Mom (who is in Seminary) would inevitably walk through the living room, roll her eyes, and say, ""What are you doing watching this CHILDREN'S PROGRAM?"" (Remember when your parents told you as long as you were under their roof, you were still a child to them? This rule still applies at the age of 30). For weeks I silently endured this abuse, which was worst when she happened to be in the room reading about Nietsche's ""World Spirit"" or Schopenauer's ""Die Welt als Wille Und Vorstellung"". Many sneers were directed at the appearance of Buffy's bra-strap, or Cordelia's little cheerleading skirt, or the Master's Kool-Aid mouth and WWI flying ace leather jacket. Gradually the criticism faded. And then, one day, out of the blue, I heard: ""Hey....why is Buffy kissing that vampire?""

That was around Halloween. By Thanksgiving day, she would not leave the house to go to dinner until I assured her that a tape was in the VCR, recording every minute of FX's ""Buffy's Skewers Choice Marathon."" For Christmas, she gave herself Buffy's First Season on DVD, thinly disguised as a present to me. In short order followed Season Two and Three. Then I moved out to my own place. No matter. When Four came out, I was compelled to invite her over every Sunday for two episodes. As of this writing we are about five episodes away from the end of the season. Luckily, Season Five will soon be released, which will prevent her from breaking her into my apartment and looting all my DVD's like a crazed junkie going through a pharmacy. Then again, for Christmas this year, she wants a DVD player of her own, and...gasp!....I've already invited her in!

Suffice to say, if Buffy's Second Season could convert my Moms, Seminary and all, it HAS to be good. Some (not all) of the highlights: ""School Hard"" (enter Spike & Dru), ""Reptile Boy"" (hilarious, but creepy), ""Halloween"" (just hilarious), ""Lie to Me"" (moving), ""Ted"" (in retrospect, a good tribute to John Ritter), ""What's My Line I & II...."" (Xander and Cordelia!) ""The Dark Age"", ""Bewitched...."" (also hilarious), ""Passion"" (most disturbing episode of the series), ""Go Fish"" and ""Becoming I & II.""

If liked Buffy after the first season, Season Two is probably what made you a fan. And if you're not a fan, you might want to give these 22 episodes a spin. If that doesn't work, check your pulse. You're probably dead. Congrats! Wipe off that grave dirt, take a gander at the moon, wander around the cemetary and have a nice long drink of someone's blood. Just do yourself a favor....stay out of Sunnydale.",1068508800,15,4065,4.563013698630137

However the extreme poor quality of several of these discs force a reduction in overall rating.  These imperfections caused too many distractions from the overall enjoyment of the episodes affected and as a purchaser I do feel taken advantage of here.

There are a few very haunting moments in Season Two and Joss Whedon makes it perfectly clear to the viewer that he is in control.  He establishes an edge that keeps the watcher on their toes in anticipation and uncertainty.
We are introduced to Spike and Drusilla, the new bad demons, as they come to take over Sunnydale. Buffy and Angel's relationship matures to a monumental climax. And even Giles, Willow, and Xander fall into relationships of their own.  And all this leads to a dramatic ending where responsability and accountability clash together when doing what is right becomes that which feels so wrong.

1259467,5,B000035Z1R,"This is by far the best season of Buffy, the Vampire Slayer.  This season flowed the best.  Here the focus has slowly started to shift from exclusively being Sarah Michelle Gellar's show to an ensemble cast.  The acting in this season has greatly improved from season 1, as have the special effects.  Buffy grows up a bit, and realizes that her actions do have consequeces (a lesson we all learn at about the age Buffy is in this season, which is 16-17) when she is the cause for Angel to lose his soul and revert into her nemesis Angelus (in which actor David Boreanz really gets to shine, and you can begin to understand why he earned his own spin-off later on).  Anthony Stewart Head as Rupert Giles becomes quite the three-dimensional character after being given virtually nothing to do in the first season besides spew out extremely long monologues that explained the background to the audience.  Xander, Cordelia, and Willow all get much more face-time in this one, and begin to work quite well carrying more of the show than before.  It becomes more apparent that this isn't really a show about vampires.  It is a show about human feelings with fantasy elements thrown into the mix.  With the superb writing, acting, and sophisticated themes, this is the season of Buffy that all one-hour dramas should strive to become.",1064448000,,1327,4.734782608695652
1259468,4,B000035Z1R,"Now don't get me wrong here. Season One was good, a great way to get people into the series. But season two is where Buffy truly finds it's voice for the first time. I mean where do I begin? While you do have your throw away episodes, season two begins to build on the Buffy universe like never before. With the introduction of characters that would become favorites almost instantly, one can trace the success of Buffy right back here to season two.
First we have the new villians in town: Spike and Druscilla. We all know about Spike and how he goes on to become one of the reasons Buffy stayed on the air for seven years. Dru, in her own way helped alot as well. She played a big part in season two, and her character would be useful later on in guest appearences, especially on ""Angel"". Both Spike and Dru were welcome changes from the Master.
Then we have Oz. Seth Green joins Buffy and while his character at first glance seems a bit boring, they liven that up instantly with the werewolf storyline. As Oz plays Willow's love interest from here till the beginning of season 4, this is where we begin to see how the Xander/Cordelia/Willow/Oz relationship plot would take shape. That is the beauty of Joss Whedon's writing and his crew...They make is all flow together so seamlessly when you look back upon it.
This season also shows us that, yes, main characters that are good can and will die. Kendra, the slayer who was called when Buffy briefly died in season one, gets snuffed by Dru...And unfortunately Jenny Calender, a favorite of mine (and a killing I still do not agree with), also is killed off by Angel. These deaths I think really made us realize how real Buffy as a show was getting. The kiddie gloves were off, and we were not in offical horror/action land with the Slayer and the Scoobie Gang.
This brings me to the main plot of season two: Angel and Buffy's torrid romance, which sees Angel revert to Angelus, his former vampire persona. I won't spoil anything, but David Boreanaz impressed the hell out of me here with his ability to do good as well as he did...But to do evil so much better. If anyone questions why Angel was given his own show, I would point to his work here as the starting point for my case.
Overall we are treated to a great season, that gives us a nice build into season three, which is one of the best without a doubt. Season two is where the truly great stuff begins, though, and I would highly recommend it to any true fan of the Slayer.",1064275200,,2485,4.404347826086957
1259489,5,B000035Z1R,"Alright, this has to be one of my favorite Buffy Seasons out there. The story with Angel and Buffy are awesome! I really love this show because it relates to all of us, and the writers have the most incredible stories, and they always have a twist! Like they say they do it on purpose just so the characters could develop more, and the characters are always facing something. There is no one else who can play Buffy as good as Sarah Michelle Gellar cause hey she can act! I mean the scenes with Angel are so dramatic, specially on Becoming part 1 and 2. The last scene with Buffy and Angel...big shocker! Now, Nicholas Brendon, Alyson Hannigan, and Anthony Stewart Head are awesome actors. There is the whole Willow loves Xander, but then Oz comes along! Then Xander falls for Miss Cordelia! Yea, also, Kendra shows up, and can I say that Spike and Drusilla are great! Can I? ok, then, yes, they are amazing! They play really strong roles! Spike is hilarious! I love the Spike accent! So, anyways, you have to but this box set, it has the best episodes in here, come on, if you don't buy it now, you'll regret it!

1259490,5,B000035Z1R,"This is one of the best seasons of Buffy and it has the three (in my opinion,)best episodes of the series. ""Surprise,"" and ""Innocence"" are THE episodes to watch if you love the Buffy/Angel romance. I won't give anything away if you haven't seen the episodes but I will say that this was the twist that NO ONE saw coming at the time. These episodes were full of everything that makes Buffy great. They had love, loss, suspense, drama, and sacrifice. These episodes really make Angel and Buffy's star-crossed love more tragic and they really set up the sacrifice that Angel makes for Buffy in ""The Prom"" and ""Graduation Day Part Two"" (The final episode of the third season).
""Passion,"" another episode in this season, also really has everything that makes Buffy great. It kills your faith that Buffy will restore Angel but it also renews it in the final scene with the disk landing near the desk. It also has a scene where Willow makes a really touching statement about the Buffy/Angel relationship. It is a excellent episode that makes this DVD worth the price. It is, without a doubt, the best season in the series.",1062892800,,1115,4.66497461928934
1259491,5,B000035Z1R,"It is the opinion of most fans and critics that Season Three of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was the season in the run of the show, and while none can doubt the excellent story-telling, fluid continuity and superior presentation of Season Three, it is certain that Season Two took the viewer on the more emotional rollercoaster, and encompasses within it five of the most heart-rendering, shock-inducing and *best* Buffy episodes of all.
Buffy Summers is the Chosen One, the Vampire Slayer: the only girl in the world with the mystical strength and skill within her who can defend the world against the forces of evil, under the guidence of her assigned Watcher - in this case Rupert Giles, the school librarian of Sunnydale High School.
Season Two begins with Buffy returning from her summer in L.A. with her father, mentally scarred after her temporary death at the hands of the Master. After her bad behaviour puts all her friends in danger, she once more assumes the mantle of Slayer in order to save them and prevent the Master from once again rising. It is one of the quintessental Buffy episodes, and perfect for any new viewer of the show to grasp the basics of Buffy's duty, the dynamics of those around her, and the themes of the show that carry throughout the entire show. It ends with a scene that portrays the very heart and soul of the show: that of Buffy and her two dearest friends Willow and Xander simply sitting together, talking about nothing in particular. The beautiful relationship between the three characters, the way they bounce off each other and the extreme loyalty between them has always been the very core of what has made this show special for so long - all other characters have come and gone, but Sarah Michelle Gellar, Nicholas Brendon and Alyson Hannigan have weathered the show from beginning to end.
Throughout the duration of the Second Season Buffy comes across a range of foes, including one of the most original and ""likeable"" bad guys: Giles's old acquantice Ethan Rayne, a man who found savage delight in causing ""glorious chaos"" and in making his old friend miserable, and Billy Fordham, Buffy's old flame from L.A. with aspirations of becoming a vampire himself, leading Buffy to an immensely difficult decision. But foremost among the evil-doers of the show was the marvellous James Marsters as vampiric Spike, the dyed-blonde, leather-clad who became huge favourite among viewers, and his girlfriend, the insane and physic Drusilla, a character to both fear for her cruelty, and pity for her tragic back-story. But of course, the real big-bad was that of the sadistic Angelus...
It begins in ""Surprise"": its Buffy's seventeenth birthday, and Spike and Drusilla have their own little surprise for her - a demon known as the Judge that burns all the righteousness from living beings. After a close escape, a shaken Angel and Buffy declare and consumate their love, with devastating results. The curse placed upon Angel's soul had a clause - should he ever experience a moment of pure happiness, his soul would be torn from him once more - and this moment he finds in Buffy's arms. Reverting once more into the loathsome Angelus, he joins forces with his old allies to make the Slayer's death long, painful and slow, a fate she faces in ""Innocence"". From here comes more painful revelations - friend and ally Jenny Calender confesses she was not who she said she was: her true identity is that of a member of the gypsy tribe that originally cursed Angel, sent there to ensure he remained tortured by his memories. The confession destroys her blossoming romance with Giles, and in ""Passion"" she goes about rectifying her mistake by finding the ancient curse, but with truly tragic consequences. The series comes to a head in ""Becoming Part I and II"", when the vampire trio find a stone demon Acathla with the power to swallow the world into Hell. Angelus is preparing to open it, and with her allies around her, Buffy must deal with both the supernatural components of her life, such as having to destroy her lover despite having his cure, an uneasy alliance with Spike and the death of yet another dear friend, with the (slightly) more ordinary - her explusion from school, her mother's unacceptance of her Slayer-dom and her being a wanted fugitive by the police. There they are - the five best episodes of the series: the most beautifully directed, written and acted moments of all time.
Supreme moments are forever stamped upon the viewer's minds - Buffy taking out the indestructable Judge with nothing less than a rocket-launcher (courtesy of Xander), Spike stands from his wheelchair with a smirk, Xander confessing his love to Willow at her bedside, Drusilla hoisting her unconscious lover up off his feet by his arm, Buffy and Kendra facing off for the first time, Willow being suddenly and violently possessed during her first casting of a magic spell, Buffy running in slow motion down the school hall toward the library with her heartbeat echoing off the walls, Buffy gazing at her friends from afar in her silent goodbye to the strains of Sarah McLauchlan, and Buffy and Giles standing before Jenny's grave to the haunting melody of the ""Buffy and Angel"" theme. Most potent and heartbreaking of all: Buffy and Giles weeping in each others arms outside the burning factory, and of course, Buffy's final sacrifice - destroying the thing she loves most at the moment of reunion to save the world. I defy anyone not to get at least a little teary.",1062374400,6,5498,4.831389183457052
1259492,5,B000035Z1R,"After a surprisingly satisfying (though underrated) first season, season two is where Buffy and the Scooby gang gained massive popularity with rich storylines, incredible characters and smartly handled tragedy.  The season first highlight is the arrival of Drusilla and Spike, blood-lusting  who have an ancient tie to Angel.  Things get worse when Angel is stripped of his soul (indirectly caused by Buffy) and rejoins his old comrades in causing mayhem.  From there, Angel goes on a killing spree, which claims the life of Giles' girfriend in one outstanding and unforgettable episode.  Buffy is hopelessly torn between  killing her lover or trying, by some miracle, to help him regain his soul.
This even, sky-high story-arc is balanced by various love stories between and among the Scooby Gang.  Willow and Oz begin a relationship as does Xander and Cordelia.  How Xander wins her love is by seeking revenge on her with a love spell that backfires in one crazy, inventive episode.  But the real beacon of this seasn is Buffy coming to terms on her torrid tie to Angel, that grows steadily to a heart-wrenching conculsion when Angel tries to descend the earth into hell.  Elsewhere, Buffy reveals to her mother that she is a Slayer in the final episode of the season, and the torrent of conflicting emotion that follows is almost unbearable.  That, is why this season is as memorable as it is.  The emotion in this season is tangible, and that is why Buffy The Vampire Slayer is so unforgettable.",1062288000,,1499,4.9282868525896415
1259493,5,B000035Z1R,"Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is back for her junior year at Sunnydale High along with her friends Willow (Alyson Hannigan), Xander (Nicholas Brendan), Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), and Angel (David Borneaz).  But this year, she must face evil in the form of Angellus, the demonic version of Angel, who has teamed up with Spike (James Marsters) and the crazed Drusila (Juliet Landau), who plan to do whatever it takes to destroy the world.  Angel's curse was broken when he and Buffy made love, thereby making Angel happy, which breaks his curse.  In this season, we learn of the secrets of Giles's past, the truth about Willow's new boyfriend Oz (Seth Green), Willow's secret powers, and the true power of Angellus.  This is a great season because of the powerful story arc of the trio of vampires and their relationship with Buffy, but it also has great individual episodes such as ""Halloween"" and ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered"".  Creator Joss Whedon once again proves his powerful writing ability and the actors do a great job in all of their roles.  This is a box set to die for.",1061510400,,1090,4.833333333333333
1259494,5,B000035Z1R,"In season two of Buffy, the show transformed itself from merely a hip, funny new series to one of the truly great achievements in the history of TV.  Abandoning the ?monster of the week? format of the first season, the show shifted to the season-long story arc that characterized all the ensuing seasons and focused especially on the relationships between the various characters rather than the creatures of evil.  The results were electrifying in both regards.  By focusing on personal relationships, viewers came to love the characters in a way they could never have in a straight forward horror show, and the season long story arc of the tragic love affair between Buffy and Angel brought television portrayals of romance to levels never before seen.
In addition to the central story of the romance between Buffy and Angel, there are a host of subplots that are also developed over the course of the year:  Buffy?s reluctant acceptance of her destiny as the Slayer; Willow?s romance with Oz; the introduction of the Slayer Kendra; the romance, against all odds and reason, between Xander and Cordelia, and the latter?s elevation to fulltime Scooby status; the relationship between Jenny Calendar and Giles; and, perhaps most importantly for the history of the show, the introduction of two new vampires, the psychotic Druscilla and the platinum-haired punk Spike.  In interviews, James Marsters acknowledges that he was originally introduced in order to be staked a few episodes later, but he immediately established himself as one of the most popular supporting characters ever, and not only avoided being staked but eventually was elevated to one of the most important characters in the show (and now apparently will be the lone characters to survive the end of BUFFY to become a fulltime character in ANGEL)
But Season Two is primarily about Buffy and Angel.  As the attraction between Vampire Slayer and the vampire with a soul grows, the two consummate their love, with dire results.  As all BUFFY fans know, the gypsy curse that restored Angel?s soul, also stipulated that if he achieved a moment of true happiness, he would lose his soul and return to his murderous state, all of which happens when he and Buffy make love.  As likable as David Boreanaz is as Angel, he is probably always more interesting as Angelus, his demonic, murderous, soulless alter ego, proving, as both Milton and Dante did, that evil always plays more interestingly than good.  The second half inversely mirrors the first half, focusing instead of the growing and deepening love between Buffy and Angel, on Angelus?s attempts at psychic torture, leading up to the season finale.
Although it would be rivaled by later episodes like the final episodes of season five and the astonishing episode ?The Body? from that same season, the final episode of the season is without question one of the most emotionally overwhelming episodes in the history of television.  By the final episode, BUFFY has gone to places rarely if ever experienced in television, with central characters shockingly being murdered, with some of the most realistic depictions of teen romance ever, and the apparently complete estrangement between Buffy and her mother.  The final moments of the season, as an emotionally devastated Buffy leaves her friends, her mother, and Sunnydale on a bus heading to Los Angeles with Sarah McLaughlin?s ?Full of Grace? playing in the background, is as intense as any moment anyone could ever hope to see.  Truly a magnificent culmination to not merely one of the greatest moments in the history of TV, but in our fin-de-siecle culture.  An absolute masterpiece.",1061510400,2,3651,5.065
1259495,5,B000035Z1R,"I started watching BUFFY at the start of its fourth year (having missed the high school years, for the usual reasons-- ""A show called *BUFFY*? Pah! What adolescent nonsense!""-- I thought the seeming clear break of college would be a good place to start). I was immediately hooked by its intelligence, humor and creative daring (Silent episodes! Musical episodes! Wow, they killed her! Wait-- she has a *sister*?). I started catching up with the high school years through the re-runs on F/X (and just a word here-- I think it's great that Buffy is syndicated, but F/X has made the unfortunate decision to cut minutes from episodes to make room for more ads. Such cuts are death to the intricate narrative rhythms of BUFFY, so I really would advise you to purchase the DVDs), but it was not until the heartbreaking finale of the brilliant, underrated sixth season that I finally broke down and bought the Season Two box.
  As I watched that season's final epiosde, ""Becoming Pt. 2,"" and wiped the tear from my eye, I went from being just a fan to realizing that BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is probably the best show to air on television in the last twenty-five years (THE SOPRANOS and THE SIMPSONS run a close second and third), and certainly the most consistently excellent. I realize that praising a show for its ""consistency"" is something of a backhanded compliment, like saying your blind date has ""a nice personality."" But think about what a remarkable achievement it is -- until its disappointing final year, BUFFY never had an off-season in its seven-year run (and, like a great pop band, when the wear began to show, they called it quits). Not even THE SOPRANOS or THE SIMPSONS-- the only shows in the same period to show anywhere near BUFFY's daring or self-critical smarts-- can claim that.
  Season Two is the show at its best, buidling on the mythology established in the previous season, deepening the relationships between the characters, and setting up the emotional conflicts that would play out through season six. BUFFY started as a mid-season replacement in the spring of 1997, and only aired twelve episodes in that intial run. With the prospect of a full order-- and ten more episodes to play with-- in Season Two, creator Joss Whedon and his brilliant cast and crew took full advantage of the longer year, and the show pulses with the sense of creative folk energized and enthused by their success. Season Two is definitely where the passion is.
  ""Passion,"" is, in fact, the title of season's most terrifying episode (and one of its best), but I think those coming to the show for the first time deserve to see it ""unspoiled,"" so I will try to convey my enthusiasm without giving plot points and twists away.
  Season Two is all about the couple-- Buffy and Angel, Giles and Jenny, Xander and Cordelia, Willow and Oz, love and duty, magic and science-- and how all of these tangle together tenderly and tragically. Perhaps by thinking about some of the behind-the-scenes ""couples,"" then, we can think about what makes the show tick:
  1) Joss Whedon and Sarah Michelle Gellar: Yes, he's brilliant, and yes, she's beautiful, but try to imagine one without the other (or, just watch FIREFLY or SCOOBY-DOO). As the lackluster Kirsty Swanson proved in the initial film version, it takes a special kind of performer to play a cheerleader-turned-slayer with passion and sincerity; it also takes a special kind of writer-producer-director to make that character three-dimensional and empathetic, and to allow the viewer to get caught up in fantastic plot turns.
  2) Anthony Stewart Head (Giles) and Charisma Carpenter (Cordelia): The entire ensemble of this show-- including Alyson Hannigan, Nicholas Brendan, Robia La Morte, David Boreanaz, Seth Green, James Marsters, and Juliet Landau-- deserves praise, but I am continually drawn back to these two, who manage to imbue potentially hazardous stereotypes (stuffy librarian and school princess, respectively) with real humanity and wit. Neither Giles nor Cordelia are super-powered, like other characters on the show, but their honesty, intelligence and courage make them heroes, and the embodiment of the show's message that even the most extreme characters are deserving of sympathy and respect.
  3) Michael Gershman (cinematography) and Christophe Beck (Music): The writing's great, the direction's tight and the cast is fabulous, but where would all those elements be without these two guys, the unsung heroes of the BuffyVerse? Working for the first two years of the show on 16mm stock (most filmed shows shoot on glossier 35mm), Gershman utilized the film's narrower range and slight graininess to create a world of sharp constrasts, haunting plays of light and shadow. Composer Christophe Beck tossed out the first season's synth squiggles for a lusher orchestral sound, which echoes famed composer John Barry's edict for scoring James Bond movies: ""No matter how ridiculous the action on the screen, always make it sound like a million bucks."" Working on a relatively low-budget weekly tv show, these two men gave BUFFY the look and sound of a big-budget feature.
  These are just some of the reasons for investing in this wonderful program, and if they sound too technical, let me put it like this-- BUFFY is pop culture at its best, a fabulous mixture of adventure, romance, drama, subtle social commentary, screwball wit and scary horror. In this season alone, you'll get swashbuckling sword-play, spellbinding magic, goofy demons, punk rock vampires, steamy love, and the most breathtaking finale in the history of the idiot box. Really, what more could you ask for from a TV show?",1060646400,5,5657,5.014925373134329
1259496,5,B000035Z1R,"Buffy The Vampire Slayer aired from 1997-2003. It started out obscure but soon developed a cult following due to great writing (largely from Joss Whedon) and original ideas. The show produced seven seasons, with most fans in agreement that Season 2 was the best (Season 3 usually comes in a close second).

  The 22 episode arc begins with the debut of Spike and Drusilla (old friends of Angel), and establishes them as the villains for the season. The central story-line focuses on Buffy & Angel and their battle against Spike & Dru. Even most of the stand-alone episodes contribute to the main arc. Along the way we see the first appearances of many supporting characters, some of whom stuck around for future seasons.
 In ""Halloween"" Ethan Rayne debuts (former friend now enemy of Giles). ""Phases"" focuses on newcomer Oz (musician/werewolf). And ""What's My Line"" Parts I & II introduces Kendra, the vampire slayer.
 However the biggest surprise takes place in episodes 13 & 14, when Buffy and Angel sleep together...and Spike & Drusilla are no longer the lead villains of the season...

  The running commentaries on selected episodes are interesting for aspiring writers, directors, and casual fans alike.
 If you are at all interested in drama, humor, horror, romance, or just interesting writing, buy this DVD...don't dismiss it just based on the unique title.

1259507,5,B000035Z1R,"This DVD set gets 5-stars from me because of certain episodes, not because of the DVD itself.  ""When She Was Bad"", ""Becoming 1 and 2"", ""The Wish"", ""Surprise"" and Innocence"" are the reasons this gets 5-stars.  Those episodes are fantastic, and the DVD quality was great and the sound was excellent.  My UHF picture is horrible, so after Buffy went to UPN I never got a prestine picture like  I used to on the WB, so I am happy to get them on DVD.
The extras are another story. The commentary is to die for IF it had been on pivitol episodes. There was no commentary on myth-arc eps like ""Becoming,"" ""When She Was Bad"" or ""Passion."" Commentary on Reptile Boy? Did we need that? Over Becoming? I don't think so.  Not to mention that Joss isn't a fan of explaining a lot or really talking about behind the scenes stuff. I think this DVD set could have been tailored more to the fan instead of just any ole' joe who would buy it.
After all, FANS are the ones buying it.  The extras are few and weak, but there was a very good one on the set of Buffy where we get to explore the Summers' home, which is very cool. We'll never get commentary by Sarah Michelle Gellar, or any other cast members, but if I can get commentary on some of the best, controversial or plot-continuing episodes (Once More, With Feeling, Restless, Helpless, Fool For Love, Amends, Who are You?, Bad Girls, The Prom, Faith, Hope and Trick,  Enemies, Revelations, Buffy vs. Dracula,  Choices, Graduation Day 1 and 2, not to mention the entire seasons of 6 and 7) I'd be happy.",1060560000,,1541,4.382456140350877

The dynamic between Buffy and her friends, and the insane chemistry between her and Angel is so real it makes your heart ache. All of the seasons are good, but season 2 is the one that truly sold me on Buffy and cemented my loyalty as a fan. Its just a beautiful season, where we really start to feel for the heroine... where we see that just because she is the slayer, she is also human and that the very things that break our hearts, can also break hers.

I really enjoined the overall arch of the season, Angel, Spike/Dru worked amazingly well but if the season was examined in individuals episodes as the DVD ultimately accomplishes, you see how the season fails.  It lacks the fresh look of season 01 and the shorter supply of episodes.  It seems as if the staff was trying to work out a 22 episode season (up from 12) and used a lot of filler.  It creates an unbalanced and flawed masterpiece.  But if you remove all the filler and leave the essential episodes: the early episodes, Passion, Innocence and Becoming, you have yourself a true piece of art, a drama that excels all that has come before and leaves you feeling all the emotions these characters portray.  Watch this for Becoming.  Stay for the fun of the filler, they are fun but don't work well in DVD format.  A Must own for Buffy fans.

1259514,5,B000035Z1R,"...to a pinnacle of achievement.  It's hard to describe Buffy the Vampire Slayer's transition from the first season, which establishes a solid framework for a really good TV show, to the second, which knocks the framework down and transcends to TV greatness.
Buffy, for those who were fooled by the show's name at the time, was one of the brightest points in the rather dismal history of television writing.  It was smart, witty, fun, dramatic, intoxicating, and entirely accessible - a combination that is almost unbeatable.  The second season picked up where the first left off with a vengeance.
""When She Was Bad"" gets pretty far into establishing that circumstances aren't going to be the same this year as they were last; Buffy was going to be able to change and grow, which is pretty remarkable for a TV character to begin with.  It stumbled a little at ""Some Assembly Required,"" but the subsequent ""School Hard"" introduced Spike and Drusilla.  Spike would be perhaps the show's most loveable villain, but he still earned his fangs.  Even down episodes like ""Inca Mummy Girl"" and ""Reptile Boy"" were still great writing and character advancement.
It turned around, though, with ""Halloween"" - bringing in another solid villain in Ethan Rayne and playing with all-new rules.  ""Lie To Me"" is a brilliant commentary on real-world ""vampire"" thought.  Then ""The Dark Age"" hit and the character revelations started to truly come clear.  Giles' past was a revelation that we then thought couldn't be topped.
""What's My Line?,"" the first Buffy two-parter, introduces what a ""normal"" slayer is like in the gradually likeable character of Kendra, and also finally lets Spike and Dru play big bad for a while.  ""Ted"" is a brilliant, relatively unconnected episode that brings out a lot of psychological factors.  Even another lesser episode like ""Bad Eggs"" is pretty close to the best that a lot of TV shows can offer.
Then ""Surprise"" hit with a brutal punch.  The Buffy / Angel relationship is finally consummated, and Angel loses his soul - bringing his character to a completely new level, and indeed elevating the show a lot higher.  ""Innocence"" brings Buffy into conflict with Angelus, and he begins to show why he will rank high among Buffy's villains of all time.  ""Phases"" brings the weirdness home in a different light than before, and ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered"" is a masterful Valentine's Day episode that brings out a lot of great stuff about the odd Xander / Cordelia relationship.
""Passion"" follows up strongly on the dare set by ""Surprise"" by killing off a major, likeable character.  ""Killed By Death"" is a genuinely creepy, disturbing horror episode.  ""I Only Have Eyes for You"" is more so, and brings out even more wrinkles in what is going on with Buffy and Angelus.  ""Go Fish"" is another one of those good episodes in the midst of absolutely brilliant episodes; by itself, it's pretty good, and it does do a lot for characters even if it's not up to the brilliance surrounding it.
""Becoming"" shows Buffy taken to her final extreme, in many ways the ultimate test for her, and its ending is an amazing Pyrrhic victory.  To kill Jenny Calendar was one thing; killing Angel took real guts.  It is the kind of season finale that would really set Buffy apart from everything else on television at the time.
Buffy took the high school metaphors to a really higher level in this season; the ultimate of these was Angel / Angelus.  The relationship between Buffy and Angel was built so well, so sweetly, so entrancingly, that the betrayal was a real shock.  It is perhaps the show's ultimate achievement that it really changed things in this midseason; characters went beyond surprisingly two-dimensional and into bewilderingly three-dimensional.  And it would only get better the next season.
Through it all, Sarah Michelle Gellar was the glue that held the show's disparate elements together.  She could be happy, or serious, or fun, or brooding, or lovey-dovey, or heartbroken, all with a tender genuineness.  She gets to run the gamut of emotions, and proves that she can pull anything and everything off in the course of the season.  ""Becoming"" is some of her best work.  Ever.  The pain in that two-parter is real and affecting.
The rest of the cast backs her up with style.  David Boreanaz manages both the dark, brooding Angel that we know and love, and the hateful, cynical Angelus with a contrast that is entirely believable and totally real on screen.  You *know* that his character has changed.  The tension between Nicholas Brandon (Xander) and Alyson Hannigan (Willow) is downplayed after a few episodes, but very real throughout.  Their relationships with Oz (Seth Green) and Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), respectively, are also masterfully written.  Anthony Head - a great actor to begin with - gets to add about a hundred interesting layers to his stereotypically British character in this single episode.  In the secondary parts, James Marsters (Spike), Juliet Landau (Drusilla), and Robia LaMorte (Jenny Calendar) all manage to create definitive, real personae who add a lot of the season's unique flavor.  LaMorte also had great chemistry with Head that was never really explored as thoroughly as I would've liked.  It's one of the finest acting ensembles that was ever assembled for a television show.
For seven years, Buffy was the best show on television.  Just watch an episode or two from this boxed set, and you'll wonder why more shows this good don't get made.  I know I do.",1057017600,2,5518,4.939328277356446
1259515,5,B000035Z1R,"Ah, the nostalgia. No sooner had I popped in the DVD of the first 4 episodes, that I was sent back to my Junior Year of HS, when Buffy was my favorite show, and the memories it brought back (mostly of waiting on line for David Boreanaz' autograph the DAY AFTER the season finale). And among the memories of season's past, I also got a chance to dissect these episodes even further looking for common threads that linked them to the later seasons (like Jonathan, I had no idea he was in SO MANY episodes)
But I'm aside myself. THIS was Buffy's finest (22) hour(s). Many of the greatest plotlines and jaw dropping story twists took place right here, from Angel's turning evil, to Spike and Drusilla's appearance, to Oz's first time as a werewolf (not to mention when he and Willow began dating). All the classic episodes like Inca Mummy Girl, What's My Line, Ted and I Only Have Eyes For You. All are here. Memories for all the Buffy fans who grew up with her, went through High School and College alongside her (like I did), all the fun, laughs and tears shed. I know this sounds weird, but if you only buy one season on DVD, make it this one. You will NOT be sorry you did.",1056326400,,1173,4.336363636363636

Here, the relationship between Buffy and Angel is established and intensified, with one of the best storylines of the season. The best ""Buffy"" villians EVER--Spike and Drusilla--are also introduced here, and the show develops the dark tone that will be present throughout the rest of the series, with things getting progressively darker as they go along. All in all, the sophomore year is very different in tone to season 1, but it brilliantly develops what is to come.

The season did start off mediocre with the few stand alones. One lowlight that springs to mind is ""Reptile Boy"". That all ends after ""Innocence"" where everything becomes incredibly engaging. It was lovely to have the main heroin have to fight her lover to the death after he becomes a homocidal monster. This season sets up the Angel/ Buffy tension for Season 3 very nicely and ""The Becoming 2"" is one of the best hours ever to air on television. BTVS is equal parts, funny, charming, disarming, and heart breaking. The commentary for ""Innocence"" made me laugh out loud several times. Joss is a funny guy. Unfortunately not all of the makers have Joss's wit so when they recap it tends to be a play by play of the episode you just finished watching with very little insight into the process and very few if any chuckles. Sigh. Anyway, it's worth every penny and since BTVS is being sold very affordably I have every mind to own all 7 seasons.",1055203200,5,1095,4.5353535353535355

This would be tramatic for any teenager, even if she is The Slayer.  This launches a great season where Angel turns and two other Slayers are introduced.  Full of Drama, snappy one liners, wit, emotion [and comedy] Buffy's sophmore season shines and raises the bar on the great storytelling and character development that happens over the 24 episodes.

1259541,5,B000035Z1R,"Season one of Buffy was amazing on its own. We were introduced to Buffy, Willow, Xander, Giles, and Cordelia. It was a great season that ended with an awesome season finale. Now Buffy's back in Sunnydale after spending the summer with her father in LA. Still suffering from the trauma of drowning & facing the master, Buffy returns...different. It's ""When She Was Bad"" & she didn't know how to deal. After a while of settling back into her slayer duties, Buffy is finally back to her old self. Season two is packed with halarious, sad, and action filled episodes that took the show to a whole other level. Buffy and Angel sleep together for the first time which causes Angel to lose his soul & become Angelus again (""Surprise"", ""Innocence""), we get to meet Oz & discover that he is a werewolf (""Halloween"", ""Phases""), and tons more. Each episode in season two is a gem, a classic. Season two also features the simply heartbreaking two part season finale ""Becoming"". Buffy faces off with Angel, and right before she's going to send him to hell to stop the world from ending, Angel regains his soul. Thus, as Buffy states in season three, she kissed him, he held her, and then she killed him. Buffy loses everything & leaves Sunnydale. There are so many amazing moments in season two, and this boxset is just perfect. Not only do you get all 22 episode, there's tons of special features like commentaries (very informative), fun featurette, episode interviews with creator Joss Whedon (the genius), and a photo gallery.

1259542,5,B000035Z1R,"It seems that either people watch Buffy sometimes, never, or all the time.  It seems as though the show has lived through many years of changing television but Season 2 of the Slayer years still seems to take the cake for the very best season contrived by Joss Wedon.  The first actual full season of the show gave so many new views of characters shown throughout Season 1 but with some additional cast that makes this season an absolute scorning hot season.  Opening with ""When She Was Bad"", we see a side of Buffy never really apparent, the tease and deeply hurt and angered 16 year old.  Two episodes later in ""School Hard"", Spike enters the storyline and proves to be an interesting and amazing character, the epitome of the bad boy vampire.  ""Reptile Boy"" might emphasize issues between Cordelia and Buffy but a pivotal point comes when Angel and Buffy at the end of the episode actually profess their feelings for one another.  The ""What's My Line?"" couplet of episodes shows a new slayer but the very potency of Spike and his love Drusilla, only laying groundwork for an even more intense rest of the season.  ""Surprise"" actually marks the beginning of the star-crossed lover relationship between Angel and Buffy that ends in a full consumation of their love but also the loss of his soul.  This episode stands out so strongly among all the Buffy episodes simply because it is a definate predictor of the deep passions both have for each other and as we all know, one can love a person in one and moment and hate them with the same degree of passion in the next moment.  ""Innocence"" shows the torturous ways of Angel towards Buffy and her inner turmoil that consumes her so heavily.  ""Passion"" shows just that, the very passions that drive each of the characters and this is a particularly sad episode as Giles suffers the loss of his true love, Jennifer Calendar.  ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" seems to hint upon the relationship between Angel and Buffy that neither of them can escape and the ""Becoming"" set of episodes proves to be one of the best season finale's I've ever seen, chalked full of sacrifices by everyone, including Buffy having to kill Angel just as he regains his soul.  Season 2 shows the high and the lowest points of the emotional rollercoaster in each character but its emphasis on the doomed Buffy/Angel relationship just makes it all the more intriguing and amazing.",1054512000,3,2396,4.665083135391924
1259543,5,B000035Z1R,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer. What a dumb title! I mean, wasn't that that movie with that chick and that dude? You know what I mean right? Anyway, if you're expecting a bunch of cheesey one liners and alot of attractive people, uh, well, you've come to right place I guess.
Let's review kiddies: Master comes, Master makes the Annointed One, Master dies. With me so far? I hope so, because this is where it gets difficult. Angel, he's a vampire. So, naturaly the Slayer should, well, slay him. Oh but back up, he as a soul. Well, he's still a vampire so OFF WITH HIS HEAD!! But he hates being a vampire, and to compound that problem, he's in love with Buffy, and (gulp) she's in love with him.
Now, on to season 2. With the Master gone, who's going to terrorize the Hellmouth? That position is filled very aptly by Spike, a rather nasty vampire with a pention for rhyming and his wickedly drooly girlfriend Drusilla. Between this and Angel and Willow and Xander (her two best friends) she has a hell of time keeping order.
But Angel and Buffy, Oh man, what a fantastic, absolutely beautiful love story. William Shakespeare couldn't have written a better love story if he tried. The amazing persision and depth of this love story is so pehnominal almost to the point of hatred. You find yourself turning away from the TV because you can't watch Buffy and Angel struggle and fight their emotions. I personally found myself yelling at the TV and narrowing my eyes when I was watching this. You hate each of them for doing certain things that neither would do in a ""normal"" relationship. You down right dispise Angel and hate Buffy, but you know they're meant to be together, but do they?
Now, on a differant note is Willow and Xander and the inclusion of Oz into their group. Oz, for spoilers sake, is a werewolf who has a crush on Willow, who finally gives up HER crush on Xander. These subplots are a stark contrast between Buffy and Angel's romance and it's rather refreshing to see a not so heavy relationship.
So, if you're a fan of TV, or good TV at that, see this, because if you don't, well, you're missing out.",1054252800,,2112,4.488311688311688
1259544,4,B000035Z1R,"Although I've only recently boarded the Buffy express, I'm glad I decided to purchase this DVD set.  When you consider this season as a whole, it is dizzying to think about all of the story lines that extended simultaneously, often times intertwining.  This was the season where Whedon began to truly flex his story telling muscles-from the producer's angle.  There is so much to love about this season that it is easy to gloss over the few weak points.  Although I despise romantically themed stories, it was easy to put up with the Buffy-Angel trauma because there were so many eye-popping detours, from disgusting monsters to hammy, well-acted villians/villianesses.  Where the stories succeed the most are when they challenge the viewer and force them to become introspective long after the closing credits for a particular episode have been run. Episodes such as ""Passion""  ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" and the unforgetable season finale, ""Becoming, Part Two"" will not only leave you feeling like you walked through a war, but will haunt you for a long time after.  If you loved the Universal Classic Monsters of the 1930s and 40s, then you will also love this season, because all bases are covered: Some Assembly Required (Frankenstein), Phases (the Wolf Man), Inca Mummy Girl (the Mummy), and Go Fish (Creature from the Black Lagoon) all pay their respective homages to the great ones of the past.  Truly what made this series shine brightest was the story arcs created by Whedon.  Granted, the doomed Buffy-Angel romance was the central theme of the second season, but the mesmerizing enjoyment only began when the side-line players such as Spike and Drusilla (swaggering into town in and staggering out by the season's end in that black car!), principal Schneider, and even the Judge try to seemingly sabotage this arc.  In the end, that is what you can say about the show as a whole:  it doesn't walk in a straight line, and the zig-zags it takes with plot and character development are what make universe of Buffy such an enjoyable place to be, or at least visit until dark.",1053648000,,2083,4.8559322033898304

1259556,5,B000035Z1R,"Truly magnificent. Buffy The Vampire Slayer: Season II is the heart of the series. Back due to popular demand, Season II begins with Buffy and the Scoobies returning from Summer Break, only to find that the Master may not truly be gone. When his lackeys due their best to ressurect him, the episode focuses on the emotional damage left on Buffy due to her death. She comes to terms with it, and grows both emotionally and physically.
That is basically the theme of the season. Growth. As juniors, the Scoobies find themselves at an awkward time. But one that is perfect for TV. The Season focuses on Buffy coming to terms with her role in the world, as presented in ""What's my Line"" Pt. 1 and 2. It also finds Willow breaking out of her shell and becoming more outspoken, and Xander actually obtaining a girl-friend, albeit Cordelia, who also grows from a snotty popular girl, to a snotty popular girl with semi-important points.
We also learn about the past lives each character has lived. We learn more about Buffy's past at Hemory High, and discover just how evil Angel really was. We then find the Scoobies pushed to their limit without the merciless acts perpetrated by their former friend Angel, and the effects of one of those acts, that being the death of one of the main characters. Angels descent into darkness brings out a side of Buffy not yet seen...her willingness to do whatever is right...no matter what the cost, even if it kills her one true love.
At a time when budget increases give Whedon more room to work and more space to realize his dreams, the series hits one of its two highest points, the next not seen until the fifth season. Buffy hits a creative peak here. This is after the limited resources which made the plots some what hokey, and before ratings importance forced the show to comform to whatever the viewers wanted to see the most.

1259559,5,B000035Z1R,"Being a HUGE Buffy fan, i believe that the 2nd season was THE BEST, it was the year Angel turns evil, Spike has a bigger part of the show, and Giles' love Jenny Calander met her doom. I feel that the 2nd season still holds some of the better episodes, like Halloween (where everyone turns into what their Halloween costume is), Whats My Line Pts. 1 and 2 where a new slayer comes to town, mistaking Buffy for a vampire. Innocence(where Angel first turns evil after he and Buffy have sex), I Only Have Eyes For You (this is my favorite episode.. just watch and you will see why!) Becoming Part 2--bring on the tissues --this one REALLY got me! Overall I LOVED season 2 it was my favorite. I highly recommend to any Buffy fan-new or old!",1051228800,,735,4.333333333333333
1259560,5,B000035Z1R,"The story arcs in the second season are brilliant. The romance between Angel and Buffy reached gothic heights with Surprise/Innocence (Surprise is astonishing). When Angel turns bad, David Boreanaz manages to do a sensational job of acting the transition (the episodes ""Passion"" and ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" are incredible in detailing this, and Buffy's reaction). Willow's romance with Oz is wonderful, and Giles attachment to Jenny Calendar a welcome addition.
This show still manages to be surprisingly funny (as seen in Halloween, and Bewitched Bothered and Bewildered) and packs a wallop (the two part season ender, Becoming I & II, are essential viewing for any Buffy fans. They are incredibly moving). Yes, there are some clunkers (Killed by Death, Bad Eggs), but they are more than redeemed.
My favourites are: Becoming I & II, Surprise/Innocence, I Only Have Eyes for You, Passion, School Hard, When She Was Bad, and Lie To Me
For a show set in high school, the writers have neatly side-stepped making a caricature of Anthony Stewart Head's librarian/Watcher Giles. His befuddled sexiness is immensely appealing. Alyson Hannigan's performance as wallflower Willow blooming into a witch (her growing powers are smartly charted by writers all the way through season six) is strong, and having the animosity between Xander and Cordelia boil over into lust was a masterstroke. Finally, we have to give the star her due. Sarah Michelle Gellar proved with this season that she's actually a capable actress, both with comic timing (Halloween) and pathos (Surprise/Innocence).
The second season was an immense improvement over the first season (a solid debut) and the quality continues. In my mind, the second and third season need to be bought together (or at least both bought). Story arcs introduced in the second season are wrapped up in the third season. Buy this set, you won't be disappointed.",1051142400,,1903,5.1618122977346275

1259562,5,B000035Z1R,"The second season of ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"" is awesome! The style, context, and overall feel to it is unbelievable! Just like the First Season, each episode is jam-packed with fast-paced, dramatic scenes and events. To be able to own all 22 episodes in one nicely packaged set is an opportunity you can't miss! With the show coming to a sad end on May 20th, I encourage you even more to go pick up a set.

1259563,5,B000035Z1R,"This season is my third best season(after season 3 and 5).  I really liked the two new vilain Spike(James Marsters) and Drusilla(Juliet Landau).  This season contains a lot of memorable moment.  I really liked the episode School Hard(introduction of Spike and drusilla), Halloween(Halloween goes wrong and everybody has the personnality of their costume), What's my line part one and two(Introduction of Kendra a new slayer), Surprise and innocence(Angel goes evil), Phases(A really great episode starring Seth Green as Oz), my favourite episode of the season Bewitched, Bothered And Bewildered( Xander and Amy does a spell and every girl except cordelia get in love with Xander), Passion(A really great episodes with the death of Jenny calender(Robia Lamorte) and the two part season finale.  This season contains a lot of great moment: The beginning of the relation of willow/oz, and Xander/Cordelia, the death of jenny calendar, angel becoming bad and the arrival of Spike and Drusilla.  Overall, this season is a must have for every true Buffy fans.",1049328000,,1053,5.319277108433735
1259564,5,B000035Z1R,"Even better then the first season, more episodes, more laughs, more tears. Everything is better, including the hair. It is a more exciting season, as well as much sadder. But there is much less useless backflips, which i miss, but still great. It's a season to remember, and has memorable episodes like, ""Surprise"", ""Killed by Death"" and ""Becoming"". Spike and Drusilla are introduced, they are the most intriguing characters to ever appear on the show. Evil, loving, and so careless. If u loved the first season, get the second... now!",1048377600,,535,4.955555555555556
1259584,5,B000035Z1R,"Buffy season 2 has a very different feel than the first season. While te first season had a loose ark of Buffy vs. The Master, most of the chapters could stand by themselves, requiring no deeper knowledge of the whole Buffy / vampire mythology.
During the 2nd season, the series started to take itself more seriously. The humor is still there, but it's not as light hearted as season one was. Since the first season served as an introduction to the people and themes of the series, the second one starts developing them. The caracters (especially the minor ones) are no longer caricatures (such as ""Cordelia the Shallow Cheerleader"" or ""Jenny the Cool Computer Teacher"") but beacome real people. More background is given about Angel's past. Even though there are a few 'unrelated' chapters (such as 'Bad Eggs' or 'Ted'), there were a few prominent plot arcs (such as the Angel / Buffy love story) which were viewed and analyzed through different chapters.
'Taking itself more seriously' also means that the question 'what being a slayer means' is explored in depth. In 'Ted', the question of Buffy harming a non - vampire / demon / monster human comes up. We realize how lucky Buffy is to have her supporting network of friends when we realize that Kendra, the 2nd slayer (who had been activated when Buffy died at the end of season 1) has a completely different (and solitary) life. At the end of the season, Buffy comes to realize how alone she is anyway, does what she has to do, but then leaves it all behind.
And then Angel turns bad (then good again for the last few meanutes of the season). This was not only THE major plot twist of the season, but also gives the 2 main actors a chance to show how good they are. Sarah Michelle Gellar does a great job in portraying Buffys pain and confusion while confronting the 'bad' Angel (or rather 'Angelus', as he is called in his soul - less stage), but also her power and decision during the last 2 chapters of the season, by doing what has to be done - alone. David Boreanaz finally gets a chance to portray something different than a depressed, brooding vampire with a soul ,and seems to enjoy doing it.
And last (but not least) - Spike and Drussila. This is another point where season one had a flat - one - faced evil (The Master) while season 2 has a more complex and deeper pair of vilains to go against Buffy.",1048291200,2,2366,4.5174825174825175
1259585,5,B000035Z1R,"I normally NEVER watch this kind of suff. Many times when I would read or wright, I would have the tv on. The tv would watch me. Since we only get like 5 chanals, Buffy would come on and many times I would change the channel. Well as time went on, one day I began to watch when Spike fell in love with Buffy. After watching the show a couple of times, I found my self totely involed. It is absolutely GREAT! Now I need to catch up on Angel. I want to get Angel, 1rst season also. I AM CURRENTLY A BIGTIME BUFFY FAN and MUST have all and aything to do with her and the gang.",1048291200,,573,3.864406779661017
1259586,5,B000035Z1R,"Season Two of Buffy rocks. Full of funny quotes (like the one from Xander mentioned in the subject) and heartbreaking moments, you'll not only laugh, you'll cry, you'll smile, you'll yell at the TV screen and throw things when the plot takes a bad twist. With the introduction of Spike, this is THE season.
This season has a darker side to it than the first though. Many things happen that will leave you crying
...
There are the usual funny monster episodes, like ""Go Fish"" where members of the Swim Team start turning into fish and ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered"" where Xander accidently invokes a spell that has every woman in Sunnydale in love with him.
Season Two is great, and I suggest everyone buy it, just for the Willow and Xander almost kiss in the first episode",1048118400,,779,4.6521739130434785
1259587,5,B000035Z1R,"Buffy The Vampire Slayer stepped up in Season 2. It started off with a Season Premiere in which Buffy dealt with any remaining anger and hurt she had about what happened between her and the Master in the Season 1 Finale. However the real feelings that became really important were those that were involved in her loving Angel. The very heart of Buffy The Vampire Slayer came to fruition midway through Season 2. You see, in Season 1 we've already established that Angel was cursed with a soul by gypsies. However we learn that if Angel was to ever experience true happiness he would lose his soul and become an evil vampire. Unfortunately this little clause isn't discovered until Angel has made love to Buffy and is evil again. Throughout the second half of Season 2 Angel is trying to torment Buffy and her friends. He even kills a teacher who Giles (Buffy's Watcher)was close to. All of this builds up to the part that is sure to bring a tear to your eye in which Buffy says ""Close your eyes"" to Angel before finally having to kill him. It is this moment and the build up to it that formed probably the greatest Season Finale on television and established Buffy The Vampire Slayer as the iconic series that it is.
The Complete Second Season DVD is a vast improvement on Season 1. The menus look fantastic, and a real effort has been made with the special features which include Audio Commentaries for for ""Reptile Boy"", ""What's My Line?"" ""What's My Line? (Part 2)"" and ""Innocence"" and Interviews with Joss Whedon on ""Surprise"", ""Innocence"", ""Passion"", ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" and ""Becoming"". Also included are the featurettes ""Designing Buffy"", ""A Buffy Bestiary"", ""Beauty and Beasts"", 2 UK TV spots, 6 domestic TV spots: ""Spectacular"", ""Sensation"", ""The Warrior"", ""Ultimate Scare"", ""Deadly Trap"", ""Big Bad John"", ""Angel"" video trailer, Season 2 ""Buffy"" DVD trailer, still gallery of set designs and monsters, updated cast bios and additional still photo galleries (150 stills).
Great DVD set for possibly the best season of Buffy The Vampire Slayer!!",1048118400,,2057,4.830028328611898

1259589,5,B000035Z1R,"If you like Buffy, you'll love the second season just as much as you love any other season.
The only thing I can say that might be wrong is the depressing ending, which might drop a few people out of the like-buffy-box, but that's fine! IT'S GOOD AND DRAMA-PACKED!
For the person that asked, the last song in the end is ""Full of Grace"" by Sarah McLaughlin (I think that's how you spell her name?) I had it stuck in my head for a while, too.
VERY good show. VERY good season. Buy it, it's awesome!",1046736000,,496,4.177083333333333
1259590,4,B000035Z1R,"Having watched the entire first season of Buffy and being thoroughly hooked by the Angel/Buffy plot, I had to get the second season.  My comments on the first season are still valid.  The series is still compelling and demands watching every episode.  My favorite has to be the last two episodes, particularly James as Spike.  I think he's an incredible actor, and it's fun to watch him be the bad guy.  You can tell he enjoys it.  That said, my criticisms from the first series also hold true.  The navigation is still poor in that the special features are not easily accessible.  Secondly, I was disappointed that there were again no cast interviews, though promotions for the set indicated there were.  However, it was great to see the TV commercials, particularly the ones from the UK (they got the entire series on video? ugh, why can't we be so lucky).  The behind the scenes stuff was also very interesting, and the animation on the episode selection menu was nice, though by the third disc it gets old.  Good stuff, which could be better, but just missed the mark.  Let's hope season three is better.",1046563200,,1108,4.654639175257732
1259591,5,B000035Z1R,"This is got to be one of Buffy's best seasons. Especially in the second half. It was so pivotal in Buffy history. Like Angel going back to being Angelus. One episode really stayed with me, ""Passion"" It was so provocative. One of the best episodes. I would recommend you getting this, but be sure to see the first season!",1045612800,,320,4.440677966101695

1259613,5,B000035Z1R,"For all the Buffy fans... wait you already have this if you're a Buffy fan, right? At any rate, like many people I got into the second season on reruns, and it's been a blast to watch her relationship with Angel develop in all its subtleties before going up in flames in the most shocking plot twist ever, leading to the most shocking finale ever. Honestly, nothing less than hyperbole serves to recommend this show. If you've never seen it, listen to that friend you keep making fun of for watching a show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer and pick up this set so you can know what you've missed!",1045008000,,595,4.418181818181818
1259614,5,B000035Z1R,"Season two of Buffy The Vampire Slayer was the first full season as season one was a brief thirteen episodes.  Season two focuses on the development of romantic relationship between the cast members.  The core relationship, of course, is the one between Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and the vampire Angel (David Boreanaz).  Throughout the season their relationship grows until finally they consummate their love for one another in the ""Surprise"" episode.  Since Angel is cursed with a soul, he can never have that curse lifted unless he obtains a moment of true happiness.  Upon making love to Buffy, he experiences that moment and loses his soul. In the next episode, ""Innocence"", Buffy experiences all the emotions of a young person who has just lost their virginity and it is compounded by the fact that Angel has become evil and it turns out to be the fault of their actions.  The rest of the season finds Buffy and Angel pitted against one another and the pain that Buffy feels is torturous and real.  Also in season two, Xander (Nicholas Brendan) and Cordelia (Charsima Carpenter) fall in love as does Willow (Allyson Hannigan) and Oz (Seth Green), who is introduced in the ""Inca Mummy Girl"" episode.  We find out later in the ""Phases"" episode that Oz is a werewolf. Spike (James Marsters) and Drusilla (Juliet Landau) are introduced in the ""School Hard"" episode and they play bigger roles later in the season as the join forces with the evil Angel.  We get a glimpse into Giles' (Anthony Stewart Head) past as his old friend Ethan Rayne first appears in the ""Halloween"" episode and then ""The Dark Age"" in which we see that Giles isn't just the stuffy librarian he appears to be.  A second slayer, Kendra (Bianca Lawson) appears in the ""What's My Line"" episodes.  The season ends with the two parts of ""The Becoming"" in which we see how Angel becomes a vampire at the hand of Darla (Julie Benz) and how he psychologically tortured then sired Drusilla.  Angel is trying to end the world by awaking the demon Acathla who will bring hell on Earth.  He fails, but then Drusilla captures Giles who knows the spell.  In the process she kills Kendra.  Meanwhile, Willow has found a spell to restore Angel's soul.  Buffy confronts Angel, but she is too late as the door is already open.  She knows she must kill Angel as he is the key that will lock the door.  While in battle, Willow successfully performs the spell restoring Angel's soul.  When Buffy realizes that Angel's soul is back, she still kills him as it is the only way to save the world.  The season ends with Buffy leaving Sunnydale on a bus.  Season two does have some lighter moments such as the ""Halloween"" episode where a spell is cast on costumes and the wearer becomes whatever the costume is (Xander becomes a soldier and Buffy an 18th century noblewoman), ""Ted"" where John Ritter guest stars as Buffy's mom's new too perfect to be true boyfriend and ""Bewitched, Bothered & Bewildered"" where Xander has a spell cast to have Cordelia love, but it backfires and every girl in Sunnydale loves him except Cordelia.",1043971200,4,3079,4.717757009345794
1259615,5,B000035Z1R,"In the second season, things finally start moving.  I can't imagine any Buffy fan being without this.  People complain about the film quality, but remember the first 2 seasons of Buffy were done on a very small budget for a network/prime time show (considering that sci/horror/fantasy shows are much more expensive to produce then say a sitcom).  The first two seasons were filmed on inferior 35mm film and that is why the picture is grainy, not because of the DVD's.  In fact, while watching season 3 eps, you can tell when they put in stock footage of the highschool that was filmed for season 2 just because of the difference in film quality.  I am most upset with the people who give such a bad rating to the DVD's for film quailty when it can't be helped.  (This grainyness appears on reruns of the show on FX as well, so all you people who wrote nasty letters to FOX berating the DVD's for the film quality should shove it, the execs are laughing at you)  Well, anyway, I am happy with my purchase.",1043971200,,1004,4.453551912568306

1259617,1,B000035Z1R,"I doubt I am the biggest Buffy fan out there, but I am enough of one to shell out a lot of money for a Boxset and in return expect decent picture quality and packaging that won't damage when I drop it on the floor. I have had a heck of a time with two of my Buffy Box sets, mostly the packaging, but I was disgusted to discover the horrible picture quality in episodes like ""Some Assembly required"".  I personally think that Fox should have their head's examined, thinking they could release Buffy fans this kind of DVD.  I was so upset the quality of this DVD that I wrote Fox a big letter complaining about it. If you feel like Buffy fans deserve some respect or your just annoyed by the film transfer, then send a letter Fox's way.  I have to imagine that the entire budget for this DVD was spent on the the overly elaborate 3d menu's.",1043539200,2,838,4.192546583850931
1259618,5,B000035Z1R,"My wife got me Season One and Two for Christmas.  I've managed to watch them all, and go onto Season Three with a smile on my face.  The show keeps developing the main characters, and every now and then throwing in a grim plot twist that wrenches your heart.  Xanders and Willow are great comic/human counterpoints to Buffy's complex, often melancholy life as the Slayer.  I'm so into this series now, I'm already regretting when Sarah Michelle Gellar may decide to call it quiets down the road.
This DVD is incredibly fun.  I found myself watching two and three shows a night.  I'm eating it like candy and loving it.  As far as originality, the show itself is a mixture of humor, horror, and action.  And it all manages to be like a little bit of harmless Halloween fun everytime.  Can't rave enough about Joss Weadon's creation.  Some of the monsters and story lines are just the same old monsters and story lines we've seen in hundreds of horror films since clear back to the Universal Studios days, BUT, remember that in writing fiction, there is no original idea, only original ways of presenting it.  And I find myself wishing I was in the shoes of the writers of this show; they are managing to present old ideas in a bundle of fresh fun, and seem to be having a ball doing it.",1042675200,,1285,4.472103004291846

1259621,5,B000035Z1R,"The finest season of one of the finest shows on television, Buffy the Vampire Slayer's Season Two launched the show into mainstream fame and took it to perilous new directions.  Picking up mere months after last season's shocking finale, ""Prophecy Girl,"" left off, Buffy and Co. find themselves ready for the beginning of their junior year of high school.  Only one problem:  Buffy's death is having far ranging consequences, personally and mystically.  With the possible resurrection of the Master a real possibility, Buffy is forced to battle her own personal demons and fears, and this is all in the Season Premiere.
Buffy's new sense of focus this season was her relationship with Angel, begun midseason last year.  A vampire with a soul, destined to walk the Earth seeking redemption for hundreds of years of merciless killing, Angel too must confront his past before his future with Buffy can begin.
Xander's inevitable relationship with Cordelia as well as Willow's blooming love for Oz captivate the viewers, and the long-anticipated Giles/Jenny romance all highlight Buffy's season of ""agony and ecstasy.""
The introduction of Spike and Drusilla, two vampire lovers hellbent on raising hell, Kendra, the second slayer called in response to Buffy's untimely death at the hands of the Master last spring, and Willow's new flame Oz, the werewolf rocker who likes girls that do more than ""walk and talk,"" all play pivitol roles in future episodes and seasons.  That's the best of Buffy it's like Dicken's for t.v., with minute details of this moment having far ranging reprecussions season's later.
By midseason, Buffy and Angel's love for oneanother has reached its peak, and on her seventeenth birthday, the two take the next step.  With virginity behind her, Buffy is jolted out of her euphoria when Angel turns to the darkside.  Apparantly, the take back his soul and return him to the viscious killing machine that he was, all that was needed was one moment of true happiness.  Vowing never to feel so human and weak again, Angelus (Angel as satanic vampire) embarks down a path that destroys the lives of all of the Scoobies.  With Jenny Calender's brutal death, which revealed Buffy's ultimate message (no one's safe), Angel tears at Giles, separating him from the group.  With reason aside, Buffy and the others are forced to battle ghosts on their own, ghosts that are telling a story far to similar to be taken lightly.  But true love is shown to conquer all, until Angel and Buffy are jolted out of their possession and back into their dark reality.  When Angel plans to finally rid himself and the world of all things human, Buffy faces her second apocalypse with reservation and weariness.  The return of Kendra, as well as her death, set Buffy up for her most harrowing day ever.  A restoration spell on Angel's soul goes awry, but Willow's determination to use the dark arts for good (something that she loses momentarilly in Season Six's finale ""Two To Go"" and ""Grave"") means that Buffy saves her Angel.  However, after she rescues Giles from Angel's tortureous grasp, as well as teaming up with Spike, Buffy's ultimate test of her heroine status occurs.  Angel's soul is restored, but he has already opened the gates into hell.  His blood being the only possible closure, Buffy is forced to send her newly resouled lover into the dark depths of hell forever, and as he reaches his hands towards her, his eyes wide with sadness, betrayal, and fear, she must stand back and strong, unmoving, unwavering.  However, mere seconds after the portal closes, mere seconds after she sends the love of her life into a world of eternal pain and torture, the Slayer breaks down for the first visible time since this entire situation began.  Tie that into her being accussed of Kendra's murder, being kicked out of school, and being told by her mother to leave home when her Slayer status is discovered, Buffy makes the only choice possible:  to leave home.
The season ends with Buffy splitting town, with an unsure future ahead of her.  Season Three picks up off of that action, and catipults the show into some familar but still tricky endeavors.  Season Two sets up the betrayal of the Scooby gang by someone they trust as an integral part of the seasonal story arc, as well as a Big Bad that is least expected.  The Master may have been the first enemy to kill Buffy, but Angel is by afar her greatest foe.  For ne'er was there a tale...
A strong plotline, innovative twists, and timely introduction of key characters, Season Two Buffy is the highlight of a show full of highlights.  The show was at the top of its game with its flawless exectution and delivery of one of the most heated and dramatic scripts ever.  From ""When She Was Bad"" to ""Becoming, Part II,"" Season Two Buffy creates the Buffy we love to watch.",1041897600,3,4827,4.819393939393939
1259622,5,B000035Z1R,"Buffy The Vampire Slayer's second season took on an epic feel to it. Each week instead of there being a new bad guy for our heroine to pounce, it felt as if the story were moving into a much higher direction; and it was. Since we last saw Xander and Willow, their friendship turned into a bit of summer romance that was basically nothing more than two young best friends exploring life together.
Although when Xander's desires for the beautiful and popular Cordelia became a possibility, his torch for the raven haired Willow soon came to an end. Meanwhile, Buffy and Angel's romance heated up behind some closed doors and Mr. Giles' crush on teacher Ms. Calendar was becoming more and more apparent. Everything seemed to be going well...
Enter vampires Spike and Drusilla into the mix. The dark and mysterious couple who had only one thing on their minds: destroying the slayer. Of course in typical Buffy fashion, Spike and Drusilla were nothing more than an illusion blinding audiences from the season's real threat - Angel.
On the night of Buffy's 17th birthday, she spent the night with Angel and the two made love; unknowingly setting off an ancient spell that the gypsies had cursed Angel with. The spell was to take away his soul if he were to ever experienced true happiness. And so on the night of Buffy's birthday, the man she was so deeply in love with once again became a monster. A monster who wanted to kill not only her, but everyone she was closest to.
This season was about love and sacrifice. How it makes us all vulnerable and how it can make us do things we wouldn't normally do. The story was gripping and emotional; each week feeling like a new chapter in a novel you couldn't put down. The ride was bittersweet watching as Buffy had to protect herself and the ones she loved from the same person she was so deeply in love with.
A showdown was inevitable...
I can't imagine too many people reading this who haven't already seen it, but for those who haven't I'll say no more.
Buffy really showed it's staying power with this season. It's audience began to expand, new favorite characters were introduced to the show and the writing and the acting were superb. It also introduced us to such new characters as Oz, the werewolf who stole Willow's heart, Spike, the rebel vamp with the bad attitude, Drusilla, Spike's torchered and psychotic vampire girlfriend and Kendra, the new slayer.
Overall, this heartbreaking season is some of the best television ever made. It's story will move you and send chills down your spine and leave you begging for more. And as BTVS fans all know,
The best was yet to come...",1041724800,2,2628,4.641630901287554

however, i think companies that release things on DVD should take the time to spice it up for a DVD release. fancy dvd intros and menus don't cut it for me.
its the original series, exactly how they were aired. there's no remastered video or audio here - the film is grainy at times during dark scenes (which is, what, 90% of the series?), and your sound is Dolby Surround (not to be confused with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround). kinda disappointing when the rest of your DVDs have the Digital 5.1 (or DTS) option.
but, hey, buy it, its $. i'll be buying the 1st and 3rd shortly",1041206400,,699,4.384615384615385

It's got 22 great episodes, each with some of the best ... kicking, humor,and romantic action I've ever seen on a television show. I mean, I only just started watching this show in its sixth season and its second season seems just as perfect! here are byfar the best episodes on this 6 disc set:
1. When She Was Bad: Buffy has to fight off a group of vampires trying to raise the master from his grave. 2. School Hard: Everyone's fav vampire, Spike, and his quite unusual girlfriend, Drusilla arrive in town 3. What's my Line 1+2: a group of demon assasins is sent to kill Buffy, but spike kidnaps Angel (Buffy's blood-sucking boyfriend with a soul) to cure Dru of her illness.
4. Ted: Joyce falls for a brainy computer guy whom everyone falls for his charm except Buffy. 5. Surprise+Innocence: when Buffy and Angel Bang, things get problamatic as Angel loses his sole and joins Spike to unleash hell with the Judge (remember folks, don't have sex when your 240 years old!). 6. Becoming 1+2: Great action, but if your a die hard fan of Angel you might want to bring tissues. Oh, and don't forget to be ready to scream like a woosy if you're about to watch Killed By Death.

1259636,5,B000035Z1R,"This is my favorite season. It is the beginning of Buffy and Angel's real relationship. Sure, in season 1 you found out a little aout him. He's a 242 year old vampire with a soul but now you begin to get deeper. You see their relationship blossom and how much they really care and love eachother. Also, other people begin relationships. The unpredictable Xander/Cordelia mix. Oh and Oz and Willow,which is such a cute couple. You also see some new villians come to town. Dru and Spike (Spike being a very cute vamire), come and are after Buffy. This is the first and not the last time you see Spike...

1259638,5,B000035Z1R,"This is the ultimate Buffy season and a MUST SEE for anyone who wants to take a dive into the Buffy universe. The soap opera aspect really takes off with the season opener as Buffy returns from her summer vaction with a whole new attidude after killing the first season's lead villain, the evil vampire Master simply known as The Master. As the season continues, the romance builds between Buffy and Angel which result in dire consequences and Angel becomes the evil Angellus once more. The good and bad side of ""love"" seemed to be the theme of the season. Plots to watch: 2 new romantic villains arrived in Sunnydale, Spike and Drusilla... Giles and Jenny Calender grow closer but not all is as it seems with Jenny.... Willow and Xander get involved in unlikely relationships with Cordelia and newcomer, Oz... a second slayer comes to town... and you'll see the tragic season 2 finale with a confrontation between Buffy and Angellus. Every episode was enjoyable and the kind you can watch over and over again. The series is at its best with drama, horror, suspense, comedy and great writing.

1259639,5,B000035Z1R,"In season 1 of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", everything was scary and great, but season 2 takes the show to a brand new level, revealing more plot twists. This season shows that Buffy is not just a teen horror show, but there's plenty of drama. Many of the episodes are hilarious and are also nailbiters. For example when Xnader's love spell backfires on him or the Halloween episode. These are truly originals. The villians at the same time are totally awesome, the crazy, future-telling Drusilla and the malicious Spike. And if this cannot convince you to buy the season two DVD, there are great guest appearances, like John Ritter in the episode ""Ted"" or Shane West in ""Go Fish"". And don't forget the heartbreaking 2 part season finally!",1039910400,,738,4.7734375

I am a huge fan of Angel and am looking forward to Season 3.  I recommend this DVD for any Buffy fan....especially if you have a computer to access the additional ""extras""!!",1039651200,,296,4.345454545454546
1259641,4,B000035Z1R,"This show has been on television for a while now, but I only recently started watching it.  Based solely on what the show appeared to be about, I didn't think I would like it, and for many years never saw it.  After seeing a few re-run episodes last year, I have come to find that Buffy is a great show that consistently causes me to laugh out loud and immediately fall in to believing the characters - if not the lives they live!  It is well written, amusing, and interesting to watch.  I am grateful for all the wonderful ironies contained in each episode.
It is mind-boggling that the video quality of this set is so bad.  Everything else about this show, this season, and the artwork and care put into this DVD are high quality, but more often than not the video is two steps down from watching it over cable from the broadcast station.  It often appears like a grainy film was displayed over a plate of glass and that we are looking through that plate of glass.  In one scene during Inca Mummy Girl you will see more video noise than actual show.
In spite of the fact that the video quality is poor, you should not stop yourself from obtaining this DVD.  It's worth having and watching.",1039564800,,1191,4.357466063348416
1259642,5,B000035Z1R,"Season two came right out of the gates with When She Was Bad, and the magic those 22 episodes encompassed has not been seen since on any show in any genre. This season holds some of the  best episodes in the shows history, episodes that still shine almost five years later; When She Was Bad, School Hard, Passion, Innocence, Surprise, and Becoming Parts One and Two.
  Everything came together in season two for ""Buffy"". Angel (David Boreanaz) was finally added as a regular cast member, as he deserved. His acting in this second season made leaps and bounds into the good, and his transition from Angel to Angelus in Surprise and Innocence  is still probably the best piece of acting he has put forth, except for perhaps the scene in Becoming Part II.
  The original cast shines in this season, and without Charisma Carpenter, David Boreanaz, and Anthony Stewart Head, BTVS has been severely lacking. There will be nothing like the original cast and the emotions they portrayed early in the series.
  Romance wise, the Xander  and Cordelia relationship is begun, as is the Willow and Oz relationship. Giles' own tortured romance with Jenny Calendar comes to a haunting and shocking demise in Passion. Chemistry between all couples is off the charts in this season, showing that the writers were right on when pairing couples together.  It is not only the emotional scars that the characters must endure, but the physical and psychological.
  Sarah Michelle Gellar shows how talented she is in this season, showing her range of abilities. Whether it be a well-timed joke, a heart-breaking speech, or sending her Lover to hell, Sarah excells in this season.
  No doubt the best relationship ever to come from this show, (and one of the best in the history of television) the Buffy and Angel relationship, a tale of star-crossed lovers, reaches the high point, only to plummet downward in Innocence. Surprise and Innocence is a close second the Becoming Part I and II for the best two parter in BTVS history.
  All in all, season two is by far the best season in the show's 7-season history (at this point). It has all of the necessary elements. Even if you  have missed out on season one, you can still watch season two and enjoy it to it's full potential. It's re-watchable and enjoyable the second time or seventy-second time.",1039219200,3,2327,4.791979949874687
1259657,5,B000035Z1R,"As someone who started watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer in its fourth season, it was a little hard to watch the earlier episodes. I am not at all an Angel fan, and especially not an Angel/Buffy fan (I know that everyone swooned over their relationship, but I find her current ""relationship"" with vamp Spike has more intrigue to it, and maybe even more depth), so these earlier episodes maybe don't hold my interest as much as they should. However, being a true fan of the show, there is no way I can dislike any season. But truthfully, I think the second season is one of the best. A lot of stuff happened in these 22 episodes: Spike and Dru came to town and started wreaking havoc, Xander and Cordelia became a mismatched couple, Buffy and Angel had intimate ""relations"" which made Angel turn all evil, a new slayer came to town, and oh yeah - Buffy killed Angel. My, oh my.
Season two had some classic episodes that could be put on any Buffy fan's top 10 list of episodes: ""Halloween"" is a devishly fun episode that has everyone in Sunnydale becoming whatever it is they are dressed up as; ""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"" is a Xander classic, where he has witch Amy put a spell on Cordelia to make her want him back, but instead it makes her hate him and makes every other female in Sunnydale love him. And of course, ""Becoming, Part One"" and ""Becoming, Part Two"", the two-part season finale, where the showdown between good (Buffy) and evil (Angel) takes place. But really, it was the simple moments that meant the most: shy Willow and geeky Xander almost kissing, evil Spike teaming up with his biggest enemy Buffy to save the world...little things like that which make the show priceless. This 6-DVD set is wonderful, with great featurettes and interviews with cast and crew, and great commentary on a few of the episodes.

I live in europe and would like to share some thoughts..here in europe(I live in holland) we have season 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5(in a couple of days/weaks) released on DVD.
The US sets are much cheaper than what we get, our sets are about the same price as your X files box sets and sometimes even expensiver than that.
We also have a more beautifull packaging(kind of a book thing).
Back to this set, Season 2 is not the best season that is/are season 4 and up(widescreen(!), better sound, more extra's etc.
but still it's worth buying, the quality of our season 2 is okay but not stunnig.
A friend of mine has also got the us edition and we compared it and i think the region 2 is slightly better(my opinion).
But season 3 is a lot better!(If you wanna buy a good set, this is for u) the quality is verry much improved compared to season 1+2(wich are the worst quality of all)the menu's are easier and you don't have that symetery walk trough thing.
Season 4 is really good, it's in my opinion not a good season but the dvd's are the best! Widscreen finally.. and it looks soooooo much beter! the sound and extra's are also fare more beter than the previous sets.
Season 5 is also verry promosing, this box has probally the best extra's and is also widscreen blablabla...
I just wanted to let you know what you can suspect, it's a shame you don't get the same packaging...season 1 fold out to a crussifix(is this the right way to spell it? ;) and season 2 and up had some sort of book style wich is verry beautifull and easy to use.
So keep in mind that this is info about region 2 sets(region 4 has other packaging wich is not really nice)I don't know if the upcoming us boxes will have the same quality..because there's such a price difference..
If you decied to buy region 2(because you cant wait or someother reason) keep in mind that only th UK, and Dutch and Belgium sets have the special packaging..
The German(cut's the season in half(except S1)) and frence(cut's the season in half and also has whole season in a different packaging, like the us packaging) and australian(region 4, cut's the season in half)editions have other different packaging..
I have all the seasons and have never had had any problems what so ever with these dvds(no skipping, no pixelateting(is this the way to spell it?), we almost never had those kind of things..
I hope this helps in your decicien.. :)

But then I started hearing people say it was good.  I couldn't believe it.  But at the time, I was already hooked on Babylon 5 and Deep Space Nine, and I concluded I only had so much time for TV and didn't watch it still.
So, after those other shows went off the air, I kept hearing that Buffy is a good show, but I figured by that time I was several years behind and no point watching now.  So I still didn't watch.
So, now that seasons 1 and 2 are on DVD, I figured, what the heck.  I can buy them.  If I don't like 'em, I could give 'em to friends or sell them or something.  So I bought seasons 1 and 2 on DVD.  Man, its a great show.  I wish I would have started watching years ago.  I can't wait for the season 3 to come to DVD.  (and 4 ...)",1031356800,,997,3.79126213592233
1259703,4,B000035Z1R,"After purchasing the first Buffy season on DVD and gobbling it up rather quickly, I eagerly awaited the arrival of the second season which in essence takes everything that was good about the first season and multiplies it ten fold. The entire 22 episode season is spread out across 6 discs (each disc contains four episodes except for the last one which has the final two episodes plus some extra features). My favorite disc is probably disc 4 which has epsisodes 13, 14, 15 and 16 on them. I liked virutually all the seasons episodes but these were among some the best in my opinion. The packaging leaves a bit to be disired just because it's so large and bulky it is kinda hard to handle sometimes, but this is a minor complaint. The footage is also kinda grainy but that has to do with the camera's that they shot the show in (or so i'm told) The extra features are great, there is at least one commentary or interview on every disc and on the 6th there are a lot more. The commentary and interviews are insightful and interesting to any fan of the show and reveal a lot behind the process of making Buffy. In all this DVD package is a must have for Buffy fans. It has 22 good episodes and a good deal of extras and other features to boot. Season 2 has some surprisingly good episodes in it which i had sort of forgotten about and it was a blast to go back a revisit some of them thanks to this great package. A must have for all true Buffy fans.",1031184000,4,1449,4.253623188405797
1259704,5,B000035Z1R,An exclent pack for Buffy fanatics. Angel and all older friends are there. It's watching the old days of Sunnydale. With wonderful familuer faces.,1030924800,,146,5.125
1259705,5,B000035Z1R,"Every television writer tries to create believable characters in a imaginary world like the great writers of fiction it is something for which all stive, but few achieve. Of those authors and TV producers that success are forever linked to that creation, and few have succeed as Joss Whedon did in Buffy's second season for few seasons or books have ever defined a series so completely. In a world filled with Vampires, Demons, and mythological creatures we find a believable world that sucks into the lives of characters and makes us care about their fate. The show mixes drama, humor, and surprise in a plot lines that put the characters we love through hell. Good guys characters of the scoobie gang  Xander, Willow, Giles, and sometimes Cordellia Chase are brought together and ripped apart as they struggle to survive the evil that they encounter. We are also become involved in the lives of evil vampire lovers Spike and Drusillia as their own love is ripped apart in Sunnydale. In the shows first Episode we are thrown right into an introspective episode about Buffy having to deal with the fact that she died, and to have to put that behind her. We are given the first romantic relationship with Buffy & Angel that in mid season takes an unexpected turn that ends in tragedy. The beautiful writing of this story of star crossed lovers drives the emotions of the season which makes us believe that love can conquer all even a 224 year age gap. Then we find ourselves confronted by reality that in this case love is a threat to people's lives. The brutal return of Angelus in the midseason episode ""Surprise"" sets Buffy up against the one person she loves the most. As the second season heads toward its conclusion Joss throughs us another trick that will become familiar over the next 4 seasons as Ms. Calender is killed by Angelus just as she is about to restore his soul. Once more our emotions are put through the meatgrinder that concludes in the two part season finale ""Becoming pt1"" and ""Becoming pt2"". I have seen alot of writers use up so much during the rest of the season that season finales seem nothing more then half hearted affairs, but here we find one of the truly great season endings of all time. Buffy must finally confront Angelus in a do or die battle to save the world, but in the spirit of the season there are twists and surprises that keep us riveted to the screen. Giles, Buffy's watcher, is captured and tortured by Angelus. Kendra another Slayer and Buffy's friend is killed by Druisilla. Buffy is believed responible by the police, and must hide from them as she struggles to overcome Angelus bid to destroy the world by unleashing a demon that would suck the world into hell. In the 11th hour with hope and most of Buffy's allies taken out of the game (Willow in the hospital,Giles captured by Angelus, and Xander to emotionally confused to be of any help to Buffy), and Buffy's mom forced to confront the fact that her daughter is the slayer Spike one of Buffy's worst enemies comes to her aid. In an uneasy alliance Buffy and Spike battle Angelus and the vampires who follow him. Xander arrives and frees Giles, and soon only Angelus and Buffy are left in the fight with Spike taking an unconcious Drusillia away from Sunnydale. Meanwhile, back at the hospital Willow awakes and with help gathers the supplies necessary to restore Angel's soul. Then just as Buffy is about to make her killing blow Angelus hollows in torment, and collapses to the ground. Angel has returned, but even as Buffy reaches out to once more hold the man she loves the demon begins to awake. The only way to defeat the demon now is not to kill the evil vampire that freed it, but the man she loves whose soul has just been returned. Buffy has no choice but to send the man she loves to hell, and as he is sucked into hell he stares into and tries to reach out with his hand to onto her. Buffy has succeeded in saving the world, but in doing so has pushed herself beyond the breaking point. Buffy leaves Sunnydale after one last look at her friends, and like the great hero's of the great greek tragedies Buffy is emotional broken by the cost her victory had cost her. The final scene with Buffy leaving in a bus out of Sunnydale says in silence what words never could.",1030406400,5,4283,4.555123216601816
1259706,5,B000035Z1R,"In case you hadn't noticed, Joss Whedon is a genius. Writer and director of some of the greatest episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, his work is stellar and has been praised by TV critics the world over. After a successful run earlier in the year in the form of Season 1, Buffy returned with full force in the US on September 15th 1997 for it's much praised second season.
The season begins with When She Was Bad. Written and directed by none other than Joss Whedon, it sees Buffy return to Sunnydale after a summer in LA with her father. It is apparent that Buffy has changed - for the better. The storylines are stronger and more consistent with a lot more character development than the previous season. Episodes such as Some Assembly Required, Inca Mummy Girl, Ted, Bad Eggs, Bewitched Bothered and Bewildered, I Only Have Eyes For You and Go Fish follow a similar pattern as that of Season 1 in the way they are singular episodes that do not have a knock-on effect in the future. School Hard sees the arrival of Spike and Drusilla in Sunnydale. Spike is 124 years old (he reminds us in Season 4 that he is ""only 126"") and has killed two Slayers in the Boxer Rebellion and New York. Drusilla is Spike's companion; drove insane by Angel when she was a human who killed everyone she loved before finally turning her into a vampire. They make many attempts to kill Buffy and end the world in episodes such as School Hard, Halloween, Lie To Me and What's My Line Parts 1 and 2 before becoming a bigger threat to Buffy as the season chugs along.
Love plays a bigger role in the second season than it does in the first with almost every member of the Scooby Gang finding themselves in love. Giles continues to hide his attraction from Jenny Calendar - that is until she asks him to a Football game on a date. Their relationship is an on/off one that has its fair share of highs and lows before Jenny's subsequent death later on. While Xander continues to pine for Buffy, he realises he's getting no where as Buffy is more interested in Angel and finds himself secretly falling for Cordelia and vice versa. Willow has been rather unlucky in love. She starts to date Oz, a super-cool guitarist. Her love for him is proved when she finds out, in the worst possible way, that he is a werewolf. Their relationship is strong and lasted until Season 4. But when it comes to relationships in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, none is more troubled, tormented, certain and passionate than that of Buffy and Angel. Their love for each other is legendary as he is a vampire and she is a vampire Slayer. They continue to see each other in almost every episode of the first half of Season 2, but become more romantically inclined in the episode What's My Line Part 2. Angel is almost killed at the hands of Spike as he tries to transfer Angel's strength to Drusilla. They are both deeply and madly in love by the episode Surprise and end up sleeping together on Buffy's 17th birthday. She unknowingly undoes Angel's curse which results in him losing his soul and turning back into the evil, demented vampire that he was eighty years previously. He goes to Spike and Drusilla, who are still trying to work on a way to kill the Slayer, and offers to work side by side with them to kill Buffy. He goes after the people she loves, like he did with Drusilla, and attempts to kill them.
The season finale, Becoming Part 1 and Becoming Part 2 are both written and directed by Joss Whedon and represent his best work on Season 2. Angelus plans to open the portal to Hell through the statue of Acathla which will suck everything on Earth into Hell where every living being with a soul will experience unbearable torment and eternal hell. Only Angel's blood can open the portal and therefore, only his blood can close it. Willow works on the spell of restoration and returns Angel's soul after he opens the portal. No matter what, the only way it can be closed is if Angel is killed. His soul is restored, but Buffy knows the only way to save the world is to send Angel to Hell. This makes it all the more gut-wrenching and heart-breaking for Buffy and the audience - not only because Angel has been restored, but because he will have to suffer eternal torment and torture in Hell now that he has a soul. Buffy kisses Angel before plunging him into Hell. This all proves too much for Buffy now that her mum has found out that she is the Slayer, something she doesn't accept. Becoming is truly an astounding accomplishment in the history of dramatic television that deserves all the praise it has received.
OVERALL GRADE: 10/10
Many fans of Buffy the Vampire Slayer consider Season 2 to be the best of the entire series. I'm not sure about that, but it sure does have some of the best episodes of Season 2 - Surprise, Innocence, Passion and Becoming Parts 1 and 2 are all undeniable proof of this and are true classics in TV history. It's a shame that Buffy as a TV show doesn't get enough recognition because it really is good. People who don't watch the show are put off by te show's name and see it as a sexy girl who scuttles around killing vampires - but the show is so much more than that. If everyone between ages 15 and 40 watched Season 2 of Buffy, I could guarantee that more than 80% would love it to bits.",1030147200,,5285,4.427104722792608

I only started watching Buffy at the end of season five.
All of my friends were addicts and i didn't understand what the excitment was all about. But let me tell you this show is so incredibly addictive!!! I took the time to watch a show or two and I have now gone back from the orginal movie, purchased season 1 and 2. They are simply fantasic!!!!
There is a lot more to this show than meets the eye.
You have Buffy who wants to be an ordinary girl but with no choice must be the hero at all times, Willow (Buffy's best friend)who just wants be cool and noticed romantically by Zander, Zander who is in love with Buffy and will never get her, and then there is Angel not only is he the hottest guy on the show he wins Buffy.
Joss Weadon is amazing at what he does, you are guaranteed to
laugh, cry, be terrified and be hanging off the edge of your seat waiting for more!

1259719,4,B000035Z1R,"I think I've liked the series since I first saw it in syndication on FX last fall. It has always been so much better than the 1992 movie version starring Kristy Swanson, don't let that mess put you off on watching the series which I honestly think I would've loved even if I'd never seen it on television. Every episode seems to have lots of action (the fight scenes are generally very impressive), humor (at times that can be bizarre to say the least), something for everyone. I find it most impressive that the cast is so well assembled, so perfectly matched, they do a great job on even the strangest of scripts.  The stories don't always flow directly one from another although they seem to be linked( sometimes the link can run from one season to the next, even for years)lots of little things to watch for. In 1st season #3 Witch (one of the bizarre humor stories)we first meet Amy, she shows up again in 2nd season #16 Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered,and in 3rd season and beyond. Her mother ended up trapped inside a cheerleader trophy at the end of Witch, Oz mentions that trophy in #15 Phases (he likes the way the eyes seem to follow you).
  I'm not really bothered by the occaisional graininess in night scenes some complain about. The mini-documentaries on disc 6 are pretty good, especially the set tours. I knew that James Marsters was American although I somehow expected him to sound more like Spike. Juliet Landau, also American, is absolutely nothing like Drusilla, seemed very likeable.
  My only real complaint is that 7th season will soon be broadcast and we're only up to 2nd on DVD with 3rd due this winter. At Amazon. UK the British viewers can already buy up through 4th season on DVD and about 1/2 of 6th on VHS, why do we have to wait?",1028505600,,1766,4.540880503144654

If you're an avid Buffy fan like me, you already know what I'm talking about, and this review is pointless :) - it's really here just because we can't stop talking about this great show! If you're new to the Buffyverse, at least the first few episodes of season one are really crucial, so you know the characters, but then you can jump right into season two and really get hooked, as I did. :) You can watch with no knowledge of Buffy and her pals, just prepare to be a little confused at first!",1028246400,,878,4.201183431952662

Its classic tale of romance-gone-bad, with brooding vampire Angel becoming a true monster after a night with our Slayer was the stuff that great TV is made of.  As usual, Sarah Michelle Gellar is wonderful in the title role, while Anthony Stewart Head is stalwart as her mentor.  James Marsters and Juliet Landau are a hoot as the vamp couple, Spike and Dru.  Finally, David Boreanez gets to sink his teeth in the role of the good, then evil Angel.  The DVD special features are somewhat slim, with only 4 episode commentaries, but the mini-features are fun.  Overall, this is a must-have for any fan of the series and quality TV.  Highly recommended.",1027900800,,753,4.746153846153846
1259722,4,B000035Z1R,"This is not a review of the second season.  Let's face it, if you are interested in the box set, you are probably already a fan of the series.  Rather, I want to express a few thoughts about the DVD set itself.  First, the drawback of shooting season two in 16mm is grainy footage at times.  Season one was also shot in 16mm, but I didn't really notice grainy sections on that set.  This set has them in spades and not only in sections of the show that are dark (in lighting, not mood).  It is not only unfortunate, but also a bit distracting.  Of course, the set is so reasonably priced compared to the season sets of other shows that, combined with the 16mm original footage, it may be forgivable.  Still, I would have liked more in the way of quality control before the set was released.  The season one set seemed better technically.  With season three and those following being shot in 35mm, we can hope for an end to any grainy film in future sets.  Otherwise, the set is full of extras, more so than was the season one set.  I'd still like more input from the show regulars, especially from Gellar, Hannigan, and Brendon.  Still, it is an improvement.  I have heard that ""Buffy"" in Europe is shown in letterbox.  If true, then I would certainly prefer that to our standard TV format for the sets.  Also, while the menus screens are very well done CGI scenes, they are too long.  When you want to watch the show, you don't want to have to sit through too-long roving camera movements each and every time.  Less here, would be more.  Finally, a better printed guide accompanying the set would be welcome, mapping out exactly what is included and where it can be found.  (The season one set also shared this failing.)  Ultimately, fans of this great show and its excellent second season will enjoy the set, but its technical drawbacks are evident.",1026950400,7,1851,4.465671641791045

If you start at the beginning of season 1 and work your way through this, you will be on the edge of your seat, smiling and laughing and ultimately moved by what is going on. I know people who have actually cried watching this and I, myself am touched by several of the ideas and emotions expressed. This is the best tv serial since Twin Peaks.",1026950400,,639,4.333333333333333
1259744,5,B000035Z1R,"This is without a doubt the best season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  This is the one season where the ""Big Bad"" was not only a physical threat, but an emotional one as well.  While Buffy does save the day in the end, it does come at a heavy price (not to be all melodramatic and cliched, I'm just trying not to give away too much for people who haven't seen this season).
Along with the great stories (""Lie to Me"" was my favorite episode of this season, although ""Surprise""/""Innocense"" and the 2-Part season finale ""The Becoming"" were great too) we get the introduction of some of the best characters in the Buffy-verse.  Ofcourse I'm talking about Spike, Drusilla, and Oz.

Through her growing pains both as a teenager and a slayer many of the issues that plague real teens in the modern world are addressed . . . and Buffy always comes out a winner.  Although there is a certain amount of violence this series is a real feel good show showing a teenage girl and her friends overcoming the complexities of becoming young adults.

1259746,5,B000035Z1R,"Season 2: the season of pain. So much pain that my friends and I have taken to referring to the last half of the season as simply ""The Pain.""
This was the season when BUFFY really hooked me. I liked season 1. I kept watching when season 2 started, but I wasn't addicted until The Pain. At the time, I thought Angel was a big wanker, so his evil turn was exciting and refreshing. And I credit the makers for making me care even when I didn't want to by giving us ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" (beautifully written, directed and acted). Sarah Michelle Gellar's lovely performance makes Buffy's pain that much more poignant. So many of the actors finally get to explore their characters in season 2, and the show really starts going places. Willow starts experimenting with witchcraft, Giles shows his dangerous side, and we meet the infamous Spike and Drusilla. (Ah, Spike...thank GOD they didn't kill you off as originally planned.)
And this DVD set definitely beats out season 1 in all categories. The features are so much better. The menus are a little more user friendly (if still lacking the nice ""Play All"" function that can sometimes come on tv show DVDs). There's more behind-the-scenes stuff. We even get to hear some commentary by both David Greenwalt and Marti Noxon, two of the more prominent early writers/producers on the show. The best, of course, is Joss Whedon's commentary on ""Innocence,"" the first episode where The Pain is in full-swing. As usual, it is only through the eyes of the creator that we get our most insightful looks into the Buffy-verse.
So I definitely recommend this boxed-set to anyone, whether they be hardened fans, people who've only watched occassionally or newcomers to Sunnydale. Pain has never been this much fun.",1026518400,2,1751,4.7631578947368425
1259747,5,B000035Z1R,"Happiness, right now, is having the DVD's for the complete second season of BTVS playing on my own overworked monitor screen.  Since I case a bit late to Joss Whedon's delightful invention, I have known the shows of this season mostly from the novelizations and way too few reruns.  The novelizations are okay as that kind of thing goes, but nothing beats watching the shows themselves, right there in living color.
The first season was wonderful, but the second has turned up the quality by several notches.  The actors are in full stride, the sets are in great form, and the writing is outstanding.  Season two develops the major plot arcs, all of which turn on relationships instead of just dwelling on monster slaying.  Buffy's relationship with Angel plays out to its tragic ending, Xander and Cordelia discover broom closets, and Willow discovers Oz.  The romance between Jenny Calendar and Giles blooms and dies horribly.  Nor should we forget the unholy mnage a trois formed by Angel, Spike and Drusilla.
What makes BTVS more than a one-half season wonder is that it is about people trying to live normal, happy lives, and having to face all the challenges that entails, intensified by the everyday chaos introduced by life on a hell mouth.  This is not a happy ending series, but one that brings home many of the painful experiences of growing up slightly (or perhaps majorly) different.  Sometimes killing vampires is the comic relief.
Also notable are the strong positive values of the Scooby gang and their supporting casts.  The strongest thread that runs through these shows is not the violence, but the abiding friendships between Buffy, Xander and Willow.  As will become more and more evident, Buffy's remarkable ability to survive and her longevity as a slayer depend not on speed with a stake, but in the support that is always available to her.  This is a lesson we all need to learn, and Buffy will face every variation of it in the seasons to come.
Naturally, DVD sets are judged by their extras, and of these, there is no lack.  Multiple Joss Whedon interviews throughout, as well as  in depth commentaries by Whedon, Marti Noxon, and David Greewalt.  Whedon on ""Surprise"" is absolutely superb.  And several features on design, monsters and make-up fill out the set.  Such is the stuff of happiness.  Of course, greater happiness will come when Fox finally releases seasons three, four, and five in the United States.

However, I will agree somewhat with the folks who complain about the picture quality. However, they must consider that (I believe) the first few episodes of this season were still shot on 16mm.
What I do have a very strong complaint about is the lack of printed notes on this (and the first) edition. Nowhere in the booklet are we told which episodes have special features such as commentary or interviews. Also, there is a lack of episode titles on the discs themselves. With the first season package, this was minor with 3 discs. However, with 6 discs in the flip out package (a very pretty product in itself, but...) they have provided, this becomes unwieldy, as one must unfold the entire package to access both the booklet and the first discs. If the episode titles had been included on the discs, this would be much less necessary.

Let's talk Sarah Michelle Gellar, Alyson Hannigan, Nicholas Brendon, ect. You want to talk a critically acclaimed, underrated, brilliant television show with enough wit and guts to outplay any other horror dramedy every thought of? Let's talk Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Especially the highly praisable second season in which every future storyline for the show was set, and the relationships of the characters were set in complete line. Thumbs up and kudos to Joss Whedon and crew for coming up with the most interesting and heartfelt storylines for the show. There were so many twists and turns in the 22 episode season to fill up a dozen movies. Not to mention the many moments when you had to either fight back the tears or just let them flow. It was also neat to see the many references to classic movie monsters during this season. There's even one baddy and his storyline that resembles that of Freddy Krueger and the Nightmare on Elm Street series, and I must say that that one episode (Killed by Death) is one of the creepiest Buffy episodes ever, after the all-silent Hush. This season could not have been so awesome if it weren't for the superb cast. All the cast shined here, but big credit has to be given to the four main players. Sarah Michelle Gellar, Alyson Hannigan, Nicholas Brendon, and Anthony Stewart Head. Their portrayal of friendship and loyalty is the best I've ever seen by a TV group of friends in a drama. In my utmost opinion, Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the best television show ever composed. And I'm very thankful for having the second season on DVD.
  The DVD collection itself is a must-have. All 22 episodes are here. There is one problem I have with it, although it was expected. The picture of certain segments of some episodes turned out to be very grainy and almost hard to watch, but with the type film they shot this season on, it would be hard to have an almost perfect transfer. Although I wish FOX would have tried harder to clear it up. There are four commentaries to four different episodes here, with Joss Whedon's commentary for Innocence being the most entertaining. Three featurettes on set design, the villains, and costumes are also here and are sure entertainment and give full insight. Also available are interesting trailers, scripts for certain episodes, and an extensive photo gallery. The menus are very innovative too. Very neat.
 The second season DVD collection is certainly a high step up from the first season. Now, I must sit and wait for Buffy's third season to be released this winter.",1025740800,,2662,4.757575757575758
1259756,4,B000035Z1R,"First, this is an awesome show and a great DVD set.  But since dozens of people have already explained that, let me add my two cents about one particular aspect of the DVDs: the commentaries, specifically by Joss Whedon and Marti Noxon.  These are two very talented people with a lot of interesting things to say, but at times they forget that some of the people watching these DVDs are Buffy newbies.  At times they reveal key plot developments in future seasons without warning.  So, anyone who hasn't seen BtVS beyond season 2 may want to skip the commentaries until after they have caught up.  At the very least, they should wait until they have watched ALL of the episodes on the entire set to go back and watch the commentaries, because while they contain just a few important spoilers beyond season 2, they all contain LOTS of spoilers about the remaining episodes in season 2 beyond the eps being commented on (very serious spoilage, I might add).  So, get the DVDs, enjoy them, but be forewarned about this aspect of the product so you don't get too much information before you really want it.",1025654400,3,1102,4.625641025641026

Plenty of shows today can boast of good writing and
earnest production.  What separates Buffy, particularly
its second season, is the humanity that Buffy producer
and creator Joss Whedon instilled into his creation.
I suspect Whedon took a long look around the television
universe and lamented at its glut of narcissistic
characters, particularly its YOUNG narcissistic characters.
Aware that he was making a show about and primarily for
young people, he seemed to forge Buffy as a rebuke to all
of television's cry baby teenager fare.
The tribulations of growing into maturity are truly banal
and commonplace, unless couched inside of some suitably
entertaining allegory. How crushing is a nose pimple or a
relationship break-up compared to the possible invasion
of Earth by brain-eating demons?  Demonic teachers and
vampire boyfriends don't only make strong metaphors;
handled correctly they make for razor sharp melodrama and
characters that learn to live as much for their friends
and community as much as for themselves.  It makes for
stories that aren't only fun, but spiritually uplifting.
This balancing act, performed to perfection in Buffy:
Season Two (and again in season three) is near impossible
to perform at length.  Even Whedon couldn't keep it going
forever, and Buffy's later seasons have adopted some of
the same whiny tones and character narcissism that infest
other, lesser programs.
This collection, Season Two, is Buffy at its melodramatic
height (although Season Three perfected the show's pacing)
and can hardly be beat.",1025654400,,1559,5.32520325203252

(Some people think Fox has incompetent flunkies working on this stuff.  Those people don't understand the recorded media revenue model.  It will become clearer to you in a few years, when the ""Special Edition Remastered Rerelease"" (with rave reviews about the vastly improved image quality) comes out and Fox gets our money again.)

1259761,2,B000035Z1R,"As a long-time Buffy fan, I was extremely disappointed in the poor quality of the transfer to DVD. The types of video defects seem to vary by scene -- bit noise is evident in the darker scenes, which makes the picture look simultaneously solarized and grainy.

1259762,5,B000035Z1R,"Season 2 of Buffy was TV at its best.  It was a great mix of humor, action, fun, romance, heartbreak, betrayal, death and wit.  What else could you ask for.  It really intertwined the responsabilities that Buffy had to face as a vampire slayer and the even tougher challenge of growing up in highschool.  The season was connected to an elongated story arch that continued from season one with the continued growing relationship with Buffy and Angel and it dives into a dark twisted climax that leaves Buffy stunned for a deep realm of season three.  Powerful stuff.",1025568000,,565,4.724489795918367
1259773,5,B000035Z1R,"There are only two possible complaints with season 2 of the hit program Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  First, due to budget limitations, the whole season was filmed with a 16mm camera, so the image quality is not a good as it could have been.  Second, there are only 22 episodes.
The whole season flows perfectly, from Buffy's return to Sunnydale after summer vacation in L.A. (still freaked out about dying in season 1), to her departure at season's end after destroying her whole life to save the world.  Season Two features what is still my favorite episode, ""Passion.""  While death comes suddenly and often to background characters in this series, they take it seriously when a main character is killed.  There are long term repercussions, and people don't recover from the emotional trauma of losing a loved one in just 1 week.  ""Passion"" was the first time we got to see how the Mutant Enemy production crew dealt with a major character's death, and it was quite powerful.  Other episodes that deal with the death of major characters are ""Becoming (pts 1 & 2),"" Season Five's outstanding ""The Body,"" the first three and last four episodes of Season Six.  I guess we'll still have to wait awhile for those.
Seriously, I have gotten more people hooked on this show with select episodes from season 2, than any other season.  If you haven't seen it before, you're missing something special.
I also recommend the Season One DVD collection.",1025395200,11,1437,4.7854251012145745
1259774,5,B000035Z1R,"I was so excited for season two of Buffy that I ran out and picked it up on the first day, as I did with season one. Season one had a few strikes against it, such as poor video and lack of extras. Season two solved one of those problems, though I was really hoping for them both. First off, the problem that wasn't addressed is the video quality. Some people have commented that it's just fine, which it really is. However, some parts *mostly on disk one* look just terrible, the grain completely covers the characters to the point where you can't even make out their faces. Fortunately you will only run into these scenes a couple of times, and not for very long, and only on disk one. Other then the rare ultra-grain on disk one, the picture is only 'decent', nothing to really complain about, unless you were expecting some kind of drastic change, and nothing to write home about. That is the only negative thing I can say about the season two DVD, and it wasn't bad enough for me to lower the score, everything else makes up for it big time. For starters, the extras they included put season ones offerings to shame. You get some interviews with Joss Whedon as well as commentaries *Joss's are great*, three featurettes explaining things like monter designs, complete with lots of interviews from cast members *but no Buffy?*, photo galleries and more! The other great thing about season two of Buffy is that it's season two of Buffy! Everything is bigger and better, characters are deeper, stories are better, more interesting things happen overall, not to mention Spike and Dru, apparently the vampire versions of Sid and Nancy, and of lastly a huge cliffhanger ending. It is so nice to have have season one and two on DVD, and am looking forward to season three, which is my personal favorite. One more thing, these disks are a steal! As with season one it's dirt cheap, it's only around [price], and worth every penny.",1025308800,,1926,4.585507246376811
1259775,5,B000035Z1R,"I could go on for hours about how ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is the best television show of all time. But, those not versed in all things Buffy (like the Emmy voters) wouldn't listen or care. I will, however, take comfort in the fact that many, many years from now future generations will recognize the show's brilliance. They will study and analyze every detail and aspect of the show much in the same way today's scholars interpret Shakespeare. And, I, along with millions of other Buffy fans will be revered for having the vision and foresight to recognize genius even when the rest of America snickered.
Oh and as far as the second season...this is when the show really started coming into it's own.  If you've never watched this show before, the second season would be a great place to start.  Unfortunately, the quality of the DVD is sub par at best.  There were some scenes where I swear VHS would have been better.  I hope 20th Century Fox fixes this problem before the release of the Third Season DVD.  I wouldn't mind paying twice as much for the DVD set as long as the quality improved significantly.  (Incidentally, the X-Files dvd collection costs more than twice the amount of the Buffy set for the same number of episodes, but the dvd quality is far superior).",1025136000,,1275,4.619469026548672

I had to adjust the color on my television set multiple times because the pictures were always too red or too dark. Also, part of the fun of a DVD, is the deleted scenes and or bloopers, and I was kinda diappointed not to see either. However, the Star/Character bios were a nice addition, they helped some of my friends who had not seen the first season understand what was happening in the second. But honestly, the truely die-hard buffy fans, those who eat, breath, and sleep the legends of the famous slayer, will not care about anything else other than the fact that they now possess the ability to watch Buffy over and over again.

I was skeptical, not being a big fan of the show, but was delightfully proven wrong. I suggest that you buy the first season on DVD before this (a 3-disc set) so that you can get some of the background jokes and understand the mythology of the show. But if you need to choose any season of Buffy, this would be the one. The episodes are described in much better detail elsewhere, but I will say that having the entire season as a whole, without commericals, makes it feel very cohesive and gripping.
Whether you're a casual fan of television or a die hard scoobie wannabe, you'll love this set.

This scene was also cut from the F/X re-runs - but is on my original tape. If your spending money for a DVD - isn't it supposed to be uncut?",1024876800,,440,3.888888888888889
1259781,5,B000035Z1R,"Overall, this set is fantastic. If you're already a fan of Buffy, then you know that the second season was one of best for the series. This is the season for the big Buffy-Angel drama. The commentaries are pretty cool, and this time around Marti Noxson and David Greenwalt got to play too. The featurettes are neat, and nice and long.
This set is a bit improved over the first season set. The menus are visually nicer, and easier to navigate. They added some pretty cool 3D digital images for the DVD menus. The sound is great, but in a couple of places the picture is *very* grainy, almost like VHS taped off of broadcast, not what you'd expect from DVD made from the original masters.
Like last season, they didn't include the short ""Previously on Buffy..."" montages at the beginning of each episode. In the first season this was jarring in terms of the musical scoring, but with this set it was *much* improved. Most of the time, I didn't notice at all. For some episodes they included the ""She is the slayer...the one girl in all the world... "" intro, but for others they didn't. I don't know what the rhyme or reason was for including or skipping it.
Overall, it was definitely worth the wait. An improvement in every way over owning a VHS box set. Now we just have to wait 6 mos. for season 3!!",1024876800,3,1300,4.420833333333333
1259782,5,B000035Z1R,"First of all the second season was way better then the first.  All the main characters did an even better job this season then the last.  Xander was even more hilarious, but we had also viewed his serious side when Willow gets into danger during the first episode.  It is also cool to watch Giles and Buffy interact with each other, do to their completely seperate personalities.  Also, in the second season Willow begins her magic abilities which leads to the suspensful, and rather cool ending to the sixth year.  All in all, this season was awesome, and the collection is a must buy for buffy fanatics.  Can't wait for the third season.(whenever it comes out)",1024790400,2,662,4.663793103448276

Anyway, Buffy had a good first season, one that I watched off and on, but I waited for the second season to see if improvement was on the horizon.  Jaws dropped and disbelief was the order of the day when I realized I was watching something truly original and ridiculously great.  Only after the whole season was done did I realize how much had happened and how much everyone had developed.  Joss Whedon had started to develop a kind of Lars Von Trier-esque attitude towards his main character, basically meaning that he was going to put Buffy through every hell imaginable and see how she would turn out.  This season centered on the relationship that brewed between B and Angel in the first season, it goes horribly awry and everything just collapses, in the worst possible way this season.  And the last episode is an unforgetable piece of TV that will always be a highmark for this show and the medium in general.  Spoilers aren't going to be in this review, suffice it to say, going in with no prior knowledge is the best possible way to experience this show, it continually subverts cliches and takes turns no one can predict, and basically just keeps you guessing and entertained while making you basically fall in love with the characters, in a TV sort of way.  Last thing, David Boreanaz surprised me a hell of a lot with his Angel performance in this season, it was just another in a long line of surprises this show serves up.  I like the DVD presentation, considering the lack of both budget and means, this show looks astoundingly good.  Even now, there is still this insane level of hesitation to like this show from my friends and siblings, they don't take it seriously, but I will make them damn it, and this season will help me.",1024790400,,1918,4.498559077809798

Season 2 is where creator Joss Whedon put every single character through the emotional grinder...and achieved some astonishingly powerful moments. Nicholas Brendon really comes into his own in this season, developing the character of Xander into an ever-more-complex character; Sarah Michelle Gellar rises to the challenge as her character is subjected to incredible emotional strains, from her mother's new boyfriend to her tumultous relationship with Angel (David Boreanaz). Angel and Buffy's relationship makes for some beautiful (and tragic) moments. Season 2 also introduced two secret weapons -- James Marsters is just stunning as Sid Vicious-inspired vampire Spike, charming, vicious and hilarious at the same time, and Juliet Landau plays the insane vampire Drusilla with a unique creepy charisma. The twisty relationship of Drusilla, Spike and Angel makes for a top-notch subplot in the season. Honorable mention also to Robia LaMorte and Anthony Stewart Head -- their characters provide a much-appreciated contrast to the teenage characters with their more grown-up perspective.
The terrific scripting, a Buffy trademark, is once again in abundance. Aside from Whedon's own scripts, which always push the envelope, another standout is Marti Noxon (not surprisingly, she went on to become co-executive producer on the show), who penned some of the best scripts in Season 2 with ""What's My Line"" and my favourite episode of Season 2, ""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"", a rollicking comedic masterpiece about Xander's romantic misadventures.
Needless to say, I derived much enjoyment out of this mammoth six-disc set, and my respect for the series continues to grow. Can't wait for Season 3.",1024704000,4,1917,5.501694915254237

When I finally watched it, I was quite impressed with how witty, sly and suspenseful it was all at the same time without contradicting itself. The characters are quite aware of the absurdity of some of the situations they get into and play it off with a somewhat campy nature. It is completely different than Buffy the movie and that movie is the furthest thing from your mind while viewing the show.

The majority of the episodes are really grainy, to the point where you lose facial definition and other such details in the shadows.  Parts of the first 2 episodes ""When She Was Bad"" and ""Some Assembly Aquired"" have an interlace problem, this was present on the Region 4 Australian release and obviously not fixed.  Check out the locker search scene in ""Some Assembly Aquired"" and you'll see what I mean.
The set also seems to be suffering from major authoring problems.  I've seen countless complaints about discs skipping or not even playing.  I'm on my second set and I am still experienceing the same problems that were present on my first set.  The 3rd episode on the 3rd disc likes to skip around during the first 2-3 minutes before the shows opening.  The authoring problems were present in the Region 4 and 2 releases and again, not fixed.
Lastly, there is an instance of at least one cut scene on the set.  Fox decided to cut the ""love"" scene between Angel and Buffy on the episode ""Surprise"".  They just fade to white then got to the shot of Angel running onto the street.  However, in the interview with the series creator, they show the scene.  It makes me wonder what other scenes were cut or altered for this release.  The love scene was tame enough to be shown on the WB network during it's orginal broadcast, but not tame enough for the DVD release?
I gave this set a 1 star rating, because the DVD's are horrible. Fox could have easily improved the picture quality by only putting 3 episodes per disc instead of 4.

I peticularly liked this 2nd box set because you get to see how Spike was before he loved Buffy, and how angel went from soulful to souless, having to watch as buffy has to let go of him.

This season rocks! i cant think of a single episode that i would call a Dud, and there were several that were just simply wonderful, like School Hard when Spike shows up, or Innocence, and the surprise that Buffy gets on her birthday. plus, you cant beat the episode when Xander gets a witch to brew up a spell to get Cordelia to love him. that was one of the funniest episodes written!
All in all, this season rocks and is worth getting.",1024444800,,910,4.296511627906977
1259864,3,B000035Z1R,"Reading reviews of this DVD here and elsewhere has been helpful. It convinced me of one thing ... I'm not crazy.
 Well, maybe I am crazy, but not in regards to my feeling about this DVD boxed set. The video quality is truly substandard. Now, I seem to recall reading back when the first season came out that the filming on the first two seasons was way below standard. But I thought the first season DVD set was better than this.
 That being said -- the second season has some wonderful stories, great acting and really is the year this show began to shine. (The 3rd season is my overall favourite.) And I particularly like Marti Noxon's commentary track on What's My Line.

 I just hope the video quality for season 3 is better.",1024358400,,733,4.407407407407407

It combines so many elements that I find to be missing in today's television shows.  The DVD itself is excellent quality.  I almost have to comment on Drchumley's review, the third or so review of the bunch, about the poor quality.  I honestly think it has to be his DVD player because I'm using my Playstation 2 to play it and it plays flawlessly so I may think that is the problem.  The picture quality is flawless for me!

However, the DVD picture quality on most of the episodes is down right nasty.  Some of them, like  ""Inca Mummy Girl"" are so grainy and dark you have to laugh.  Random ""night"" scenes are so dark that most of the features in Buffy 's face dissapear.  I own some of these same episodes from the VHS release - and the picture quality is TONS better.  I have no idea what happened in the transfer. Somebody please fix this for future releases. What's the fun of Angelus when the scenes are so dark and grainy you can't even see the sheen from his leather pants!?",1024272000,4,713,4.430769230769231

After watching almost 3 seasons of Parker, Riley and Spike the only one I enjoyed the most was the Love scene w/Angel.  The fact that it is cut out just really makes me mad, but almost makes me wonder when season's 4,5,6 come out, are THOSE all going to be fade to white.
To make things worse the interviews w/Joss show the scenes.
Otherwise it's a great dvd, fun to watch and interesting to see the set ups.

After all, if you're looking at buying an entire season of a show, you're hopefully already familiar with its premise.
That said, this is one of the worst DVD transfers I've ever seen.  I'm frankly surprised that DVCC, the company that did the transfer, even puts their logo at the end of each disc.  Not to mention the numerous problems with halting-motion...  Whereas the first season was crystal-clear picture (or nearly), this season is pixelated and grainy.
The extras are fine, I guess.  Someone should've told David Greenwalt (commentary on ""Reptile Boy"") that narrating what is happening on screen is a waste of time for both him and the viewer, while Marti Noxon's commentary was fun and relatively insiteful.
So, in conclusion, if you have it all on video, don't buy this.  Your videos are probably better quality anyway.  If not, be prepared for a big let-down, but you'll no doubt enjoy it anyway.",1024272000,4,1104,4.71875

However, the DVD packaging/quality falls way short. When I first purchased the product, I ended up with TWO disk 2s and no Disk 1, which resulted in me having to return it and getting another. The picture quality is up and down, which can drive you nuts. One minute the picture will suffer from ""salt and pepper"" effects, yet in another scene the picture will be perfect. Which is much like Season 1 DVD Collection did. This should NOT turn you away from buying this DVD, as I said the show is great itself, unfortunately the DVD isn't so great.",1024272000,,805,4.558620689655172

That being said, BUFFY RULES.  End of story.  Actually thats what matters, the story isn't hurt by the transfer, either is the acting.

The episodes themselves have been great so far... season two looks like one of the best for storylines.  But what is with the horrible digital transfer??  The night scenes are so grainy they look like a low quality VHS tape.  The brightness levels are all over the place.  Without a doubt, this is the worst quality DVD transfer I've ever seen.
While I credit Fox for trying to keep the price down on the DVD set so younger fans can afford it (The X-Files sets are still ludicrously expensive), I honestly have to say if the quality is going to be this bad, I'd rather lay out more money for a better picture.

1259895,5,B000035Z1R,"Just about everyone reviewing or looking at buying this DVD set knows about the second season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. As such, reviewing the episodes almost seems a bit redundant. (I, however, will go down that road anyways.) Simply put, all 22 episodes are either classics, or contain classic moments (such as Cordelia's thoughts on tact in ""Killed By Death"", or the reactions by Cordelia, Buffy, and Willow to Xander in a speedo [and nothing else] in ""Bad Eggs"") that almost singlehandedly save the so-called ""dud"" episodes of Season 2. Furthermore, some events (particularly Willow's magic use, Angel's loss of his soul, Cordy's brief flirtations with Angel, Spike's obsession with the Slayer, and the doomed-to-never-happen relationship between Willow and Xander) are still hot issues at the beginning of Buffy's 7th season (and Angel 4th).
The DVDs are treated very well, with an attractive CGI graveyard and stylized menus that are a major improvement over the rather drab Season 1 menus. There's still the color and grain issues, but these are again because of the film stock used during the first two seasons.
Though I haven't had a chance to listen to the various commentaries, they are of course very welcome, although even more (hopefully attended by more than just one ME staff member per episode) would be nice in the future. Basically, more is better. :)
The packaging is also much nicer, in part because the godawful promo photos from before season 1 have been replaced by the nicer shots made specifically for Season 2 (duh). Also, the discs themselves feature images of Willow, Xander, and Spike(?!) instead of just Buffy, making for a bit more variety visually.
Basically, if you have a DVD player and like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, you're pretty much guaranteed to buy this set. Casual or hardcore fan, it probably won't matter, since most of the episodes are legendary. Newer viewers (or people curious about the series) may want to buy or rent the first season set simply for the need to understand some of the situations referred to (""Witch"" is mentioned at least twice, and ""Teacher's Pet"" is referenced many times). However, this is the set that will ""seal the deal"" so to speak with anyone unsure about the series. Although you'll definitely want to have a hanky, a friend to hug, and a good therapist around when you watch ""Becoming"", Part II. You'll probably need it. Just before cursing Joss Whedon for being *too* brilliant. :)",1024012800,3,2461,4.946859903381642
1259896,1,B000035Z1R,"Season 2 is awesome fun, Buffy rules, etc., etc. but omigawd, the creator commentary is bad. I do not need Marti Noxon telling me OVER AND OVER that the show is filmed on sets!  David Greenwalt's is even worse.  He basically synopsizes ""Reptile Boy"" for you while you're watching it.  ""This is the scene where Cordelia asks Buffy to go to the frat party with her.""  ""This is the scene where people are treating Buffy like a kid and the episode is about how she doesn't like that.""  It's amazing what little insight some artists have about their work.  I'd say about 10% of the commentary is relevant and worth listening to, and the rest is mind-numbing jabber and self-congratulation (""The actors are so good!"",  ""Cordelia is funny!"", ""Joss wrote that  line!"", Very little is shared about where the ideas come from and how they're shaped in the creative process, why certain directorial choices are made and not not others, etc. etc.  Some commentary from the actors would also be nice too, but seems rare on DVDs generally.
The featurettes on the last disc are better, perhaps because the actors are more comfortable than the writers talking about their craft.  James Marsters is particularly good, and it was a treat to see Julie Benz because she's so wonderful and has relatively little exposure otherwise.  The visual artists are likewise impressive.  The mini-interviews with Joss before Becoming's I and II are bad.  ""Sarah's really good with the sword!""  Sarah's good with *everything* and we've all known it for years.  I have no eye for discerning the nuances of picture quality...it all looks fine to me, but if it was bad I wouldn't be the one to tell you.",1023926400,4,1667,4.7595818815331015

The extras are pretty blah (and the scripts unreadable--couldn't they have at least made the text sharper? and not white?), but worse still, the picture quality is DREADFUL.  It looks like a third-generation videotape that's starting to deteriorate--grainy, bits of snow, just awful.  The few videos of this season that were released in the US look better than the DVDs do; so do my poorly-converted copies of the UK release vids (which covered all the eps, not just the handful we got here).

Overall, I'd have to give this set 4 stars for content (because, really, who could NOT like this season?  You've got Real! Spike, Interesting! Willow, and FacialExpressions!

1259899,5,B000035Z1R,"'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' started as a midseason replacement on The WB in early 1997.  The lead actress, Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy Summers), was pitied by her friends and colleagues who told her 'You'll find a good job next year.'  No one expected Buffy to make it past its first episode, let alone the first season.  However, the show defied the overwhelming odds when it came back for it's second season in the fall of '97.
The second season simply picked off where the first season left off.  However, the show became stronger with wittier dialogue, and better, more emotional storylines.  Once the characters seemed to be finding themselves and their places on the show, the viewers were easily able to identify with the characters and put themselves in their place.  The show wasn't just about supernatural demons.  This was a story about a core group of friends facing unbelievable odds much like teenagers do today.  The Buffy and Angel romance which was hinted at in Season One, continues much rapidly here.  It leads to one of the most popular storylines in 'Buffy' history.  Episodes such as 'Surprise,' 'Innocence,' 'Passion,' and 'Becoming Pts 1 & 2,' all play significant story-altering arc episodes.  There are many great individual stand-alone episodes as well such as 'Bewitched, Bothered, & Bewildered' in which Xander (Nicholas Brendon) performs a spell in order for Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) to fall in love with him but instead everyone BUT Cordelia falls for him, 'I Only Have Eyes For You,' in which two spirits possess the bodies of Buffy and Angel, and 'Phases' in which we see when OZ (Seth Green) first learn of his werewolf characteristics.
The extras in this boxed set are more satisfying than those in the first season boxed-set.  There are three very-informative featurettes in which even if the biggest 'Buffy' fan may learn something new, Art galleries, episode scripts, interviews with creator Joss Whedon, and several episode commentaries.  Season two is known by legions of fans to be the ultimate Buffy season.  This show catapulted many of its stars careers.  Any true, loyal, Buffy fan must own this boxed set.

Were I to give the show a rating, it would be a very high 5+.  However, I gave this DVD boxed set such a low rating because of the quality of the DVD.

I have been able to get drastically superior results by capturing my analog cable broadcasts and converting them to video CDs.
There are a couple of episodes that are so bad, they are nearly unwatchable.  It looks as though certain scenes were filmed with a camcorder.  This is particularly distressing considering that the season 1 DVD had very few problems like this.

This is what makes Buffy the best show on television today. I won't leave a review on each episode. This DVD is so much better than the 1st season, not that I don't love the first season. When you first put one of the six discs in your DVD player, the Buffy logo comes up, and then you are led into a menu introduction. You are taken through a 3D Sunnydale with the cemetary, statues, gargoyles, and fences. It looks really cool! The menus are set up fantastic too! They are very organized. What impressed me the most was the three 20 minute long featurettes which show you how Buffy is made & how much hard work and creativity go into each and every episode. You also get 4 Art Galleries: screen stills, set blueprints, set pictures, and a monster gallery. They are all great pictures! And the TV spots and trailer are amazing too, a really cool special feature. And the cast/character biographies are great as usual also. The episodes on here that are my favorites are ""When She Was Bad"" (the season opener that was very emotional and very great season premiere), ""Ted"" (because it is so evil and it deals with real life issues), ""Bad Eggs"" (one of my favorite standard episodes), ""Suprise"" and ""Innocence"" (because of the tragic occurance of Angel losing his soul because he experienced happiness, very sad), and of course the the two part season finale: ""Becoming Part One"" and ""Becoming Part Two"", in which is definetly this season's and possibly the show's greatest episodes ever. Buffy has to make a tragic sacrifice in order to save the world. I won't tell you the end in case you somehow haven't seen it, but this is what television was made for!

1259973,5,B000035Z1R,"In the fall of 1997, Buffy the Vampire Slayer came back for a second season on the WB, a well-known network of teenage drama and comedy. It was no small event, either, for it was the beginning of a year that, for those paying attention, would change television forever. This mildly popular series had already gained many positive reviews and a growing fan base in the spring of 1997 with its 12 episode long first season. From the start, this show was obviously in a league of its own and fans knew something wild and different was happening. By the time the second season rolled around, the characters were all set up, the themes were all in place, and the quality was all there, just waiting to be put to use. And what followed was one of the best seasons of any television series, ever. When Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar, a prodigy in her generation) came back from vacation in the season premiere ""When She Was Bad"", things had clearly changed. And they continued to change. Over the course of a year, battles raged, emotions soared, hearts bled, and lives were turned upside down...on screen and off. Simply put, there has never been anything like it. Probably never will be again. The critics all knew it. The fans all knew it. For all those who were paying attention, Buffy the Vampire Slayer reached amazing heights and the best show in television was born. The first season may have been where it started, but the Buffy saga began in the second season. The story arcs are now classic. The season finale was one of the most dramatic and shocking hours of TV, in which I and many others believe was the absolute best hour of television in history. No other series can take the audience on such an amazing ride in the course of an hour. Whenever something happened on the show, it was handled with such skill and such care that the impact of it bled into the lives of those watching. When the episode was over, you didn't get up and go about your business without the aftermath of what happened on your TV playing through your mind and toying with your emotions. Some groundbreaking episodes can make grown men burst into uncontrollable tears. The audience is taken along with Buffy like nothing else. In the end, no other TV series ever looks the same. You can't watch any other show without comparing it to Buffy. No other show can match it. After seeing this, all other TV becomes extremely blase, so incredibly unappealing. If you want a taste of something I can't even put into words here, if you want to watch a show that will reach you on all levels and change the way you see TV, then this is the series for you. You won't ever find anything else like it.",1023494400,8,2669,4.505154639175258
1259974,5,B000035Z1R,"The second season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is undoubtedly the best season of the long running television program.  The script increases Buffy's involvement in her love life, revealing the dangers of her passion for Angel.  The emotions and reactions to the several complicated situations are genuine, displaying what true passion really is.
The season also introduces Oz, played by Seth Green (""Austin Powers"", ""Rat Race"", ""Idle Hands""), who lights a spark of happiness in Willow's lonely heart.  His role adds to the complication of the plotline, making him one of the most memorable characters on the show.",1023235200,,613,5.23469387755102
1259975,5,B000035Z1R,"I, like so many people I know who later became huge fans of the series, was initially convinced that the show was nothing but teenage horror nonsense, similar more to ""Idle Hands"" than Shakespeare. This opinion was, needless to say, unforgivably uninformed. I took the silliness of the title, my giant lack of feelings toward the movie of the same name, and the caricatures put forth by the equally uninformed, and created for myself a negative mental picture of the show. The picture carried me straight through the first season of the show, as I, in my great ignorance, did not watch Buffy. A couple of episodes into the second season, however, the naysayers started to get shouted down, and Buffy became a force to be denied no longer. I had to try it, if only to have fuel for my anti-Buffy arguments with friends.
The first episode that I watched was ""School Hard,"" in which Spike and Drusilla first arrive in Sunnydale. It was a huge episode, full of action, adventure, suspense, humor, and high drama. Oddly enough, though, impressed as I was by those elements, it seemed like there was a deeper reason and meaning to everything, and even in the most plot-centered of moments, the characters shone through as real and interesting people, including the villains. That impressed me even more. I then watched the next episode on the very next week, entitled ""Inca Mummy Girl."" I had a lot of fun with that episode as well, thinking that surely it was another of Buffy's greatest episodes. Other television wasn't like this. Surely Buffy wasn't consistently like this either. As I later discovered, ""Inca Mummy Girl"" was actually very much a substandard episode for the series, and yet still it was better than anything else on television.
I've always thought that the most impressive thing that a television show can do is to win over someone who is only watching it for evidence by which to condemn it. That is exactly what Buffy did for me. Throughout the second season Buffy kept up its excellence, reaching even higher highs that the first appearance of Spike, and making other television look about as unappealing as food poisoning.
Just try this package of episodes. Rent it if you're unsure. Borrow it from a friend and ask them what episode they recommend that you watch first. I would pick ""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered,"" for its humor. Just give Buffy a chance. No one who gives it a chance once ever stops watching.",1023235200,12,2436,4.774881516587678

Some surprises were Kendra as another Slayer and Jenny Calendar being descended from the gypsies that cursed Angel.  Also, the pace and storylines are truly excellent and has the best of the Big Bads ever to grace the show.
Now then, as so many say this show is for teens, I have to disagree, there are homages to many things the average teen audience won't have seen, being older allows you to enjoy this all the more.
It may not souynd promising saying this season is the height of the show, but it is true, season 3 tried to hold the standard but anything after that is dire in comparison.  Buy this and watch it over and over.

1260019,5,B000035Z1R,"I've got the season 2 DVDs and it's amazing! Best Season of Buffy. You have to love the season 2 episodes which include 'Halloween', 'What's My Line pts 1 & 2' and 'Becoming pts 1 & 2'. It's the season of Drusilla & Spike, and when Angel turned bad. Special guest stars include Jason Behr (Roswell/ I don't watch it, but i bet some of you used to) who's in the episode 'Lie to me' and Brian Thompsom (X - Files) who's in the episode 'Innocence'.
You get audio commentary by David Greenwalt, Joss Whedon and Marti Noxin. The audio commentary by Joss Whedon in one of the episodes is very interesting, explaining an overall view of Buffy and it's actors/actresses and how buffy is a mix of genres. He also says something about Anthony Head on the set about his pants, which is amusing. Great featurettes, excellent in fact, revealing the inside of Buffy and the work put into designing sets and make up. Interviews by Nicholas Brendon, Joss Whedon, Charisma Carpenter etc. are in the featurettes and tell us about their point of view in Buffy. Some scripts included as well as trailers/ biographies and more.
The sound quality is good, a rating of 4/5, only really because it's in Dolby Digital 2.0. The picture quality is good, but watch for the dark scenes because it gets pretty dodgy.
The episodes are fantastic! Especially the stunning season finale of Buffy in the episodes of The Becoming. I can keep on watching the last two episodes of the season and always get a thrill out of them each time. Season 2 by far stands out as the best season and important as it not only had awesome episodes but proved ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer"" was an extreme hit. Well worth the purchase for any Buffy fan or any new Buffy fans or anyone in fact! It's AWESOME!",1022371200,7,1752,4.512578616352202
1260020,5,B000035Z1R,"This season is almost twice as long as season one, thus allowing the characters, storys arcs and relationships mature gradually and not seem rushed. Season two of Buffy cannot be touched by critics, it is perfect in every way. Season one was merely the stepping stone to season two; it introduced the characters, it made us familiar with Sunnydale and showed us that some very weird stuff happens there. Season one was fun entertainment, but always had a darker underbelly. Season two, although still extremely fun, took the darker underbelly and painted it all over our TV screens. This season is hard to describe, as is the Buffy series as a whole, there is comedy, jokes, drama, action, fun and tragedy. And it's the way the writers and actors deal with their characters' happiness, joy, anger, love despair, grief and sadness that makes these characters so believable. When someone smiles we believe it is because they're happy, when somone cries we believe it's because they're grieving. And season two definitely delves deeper into the dark than season one did. I can't say much more other than this is Buffy at it's greatest, to say more would spoil the twists of the season's plot, which ultimitely proves devastating. You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll have fun, but most important, you'll be entertained.
As for the DVD extras: A few interesting commenteries on a few of the episodes by Marti Noxon and Joss Whedon; three featurettes(in the British version anyway), which explore how the actors feel about the show, how the monsters of Buffy are brought to life, things like that; and a very interesting (and sometimes confusing) animated menu; and a couple of other bits and bobs.
In the UK the first four seasons have been released on DVD, and they all are absolutely fantastic.
Thank you for listening, and understand me that this is one of the best and most intelligent shows on the planet that isn't afraid to break the boundries that other shows are confined to.",1022284800,,1976,4.8664688427299705

1260022,5,B000035Z1R,"""...they first make mad.""
Buffy's second season succeeded in elevating romantic melodrama into high epic tragedy.
With Buffy's successful defeat of The Master, the Order of Aurelius is in chaotic disarray.  Enter the psychopathic vampire Spike (James Marsters), a.k.a. ""William the Bloody,"" and his demented paramour Drusilla (Juliet Landau), to rearrange the pecking order and initiate a violent ongoing vendetta against the Slayer.  Spike has two Slayer kills already to his credit, and is eager for a third; mad Drusilla, before the season is out, will bag one of her own to match him.
The Bonnie-and-Clyde vampire duo were created by Buffy's great love, Angel, before his soul was restored  -  when he was known as Angelus, the Scourge of Europe.  With classic hubris, Buffy unknowingly sows the seeds of her own psyche's doom by consummating her love with Angel, costing him his regained soul and reverting him to the exceedingly violent killer he once was.  The act ends up costing her the lives of many near and dear loved ones  -  and pits her in a life-and-death apocalyptic struggle that will force her to lose her greatest love...or the world, itself.
This was the greatest tear-jerker season of Buffy, and  -  along with the third season  -  its highest dramatic peak.  The melodrama is intense, the tragedy even more so.  The story arc is very impressively handled, focusing first on Buffy's conflict with Spike and Drusilla, and the two killer vampires' newfound conflict with their sire and former mentor in evil, Angel, and then lethally tipping the scale with Angel's fall from grace and reunion with the diabolical duo.
New loves are to be found, along with new cast members, most notably Seth Green as Oz, Willow's lycanthropically cursed boyfriend.  There are numerous surprises and betrayals, and more twists and turns in loyalties and allegiances than can  -  or should  -  be easily recounted.

1260025,5,B000035Z1R,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer is one of the most clever, stylish and deep shows on TV today, and Season Two is where it really starts to shine. This boxset contains all 22 episodes of the show's second season, which featured one of the biggest story arcs ever on the show: Angel (good vampire and Buffy's boyfriend) loses his soul after a night of passion with Buffy and becomes the evil, sadistic Angelus.
Note that while several of the episodes from Season Two have been released on VHS, this is the first time that all 22 episodes have been available (at least in the U.S.).
Notable episodes in this boxed set:
""School Hard"" - Spike and Drusilla, two British vampires who become series villains, are introduced.
""Inca Mummy Girl""  - Oz, a laid-back guitarist who will eventually romance Buffy's friend Willow, is introduced.
""What's My Line"" (2 parts) - Career Day coincides with several assassination attempts on Buffy. Introduces the ""other Slayer,"" Kendra.
""Ted"" - John Ritter plays the stepfather from hell to Buffy.
""Surprise/Innocence"" (2 parts) - The seminal episode in which Buffy turns seventeen and Angel turns bad.
""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"" - One of the best comic episodes of the show, featuring Buffy's friend Xander.
""Phases"" - A werewolf is attacking teens, and apparently Oz has something to do with it...
""Passion"" - The Angelus matter comes to a head when he starts going after Buffy's friends.
""Becoming"" (2 parts) - The tearjerker season finale, in which Angelus is determined to send the world to hell and it's up to Buffy and her motley Scooby gang to stop it.
This boxed set also includes a boatload of extras, including interviews with actors and with the creator of the show, Joss Whedon. And while it may help to have seen Season One, it's not really necessary to understand the events of Season Two. If you've never seen Buffy, this is a good place to start (I have a feeling you'll like it).

I am proud to say I am a 36 year old viewer who got hooked taping it for my too busy (then) freshman daughter.  My 42 year old husband and I have watched it from day one and now that he's overseas, I have to give online reports!  The writing is amazing, the subtle and hilarious comedic aspects of this show catch you off guard every time!  Even after 6 seasons, they will say something that will catch you totally offguard.  In seasons 1 & 2 if you watch the episodes carefully, they translate from a demon story into a story of current problems our kids are facing in everyday life.  For Instance, a story that involves a boy who turns into a demon when he gets jealous, resulting in violence towards his girlfriend and other people in the situation.  Also Willow fighting her magic ""addiction"" in the current season.  You can relate almost every story to a problem our kids face everyday and the kids from sunnydale seem to make it through.  The writing is excellent, and the casting is brilliant.  I know someday this series has to end, so keep putting out the dvd's.

Xander and Cordelia's mismatched romance, Giles and Jenny's developing relationship is worthy of it's own miniseries, and the growth and maturity of Willow shows mature, insightful scripting and actng - the keystone of this series.
And the show is FUNNY.  Xander tends to enter the realm of absurd at times, but for the most part his comic relief is welcome. The show walks the fine line between comedy and horror without becoming campy or ridiculous - an AMAZING feat.
The creative take on supernatural events, occult practices, demons, witchcraft and vampires is creatively and intelligently handled.  The central Buffy/Angelus storyline is well-crafted and worthy of being immortalized in a DVD set.",1020556800,4,1161,5.298913043478261
1260069,5,B000035Z1R,"After Buffy's great, if sometimes uneven, first season, the show came back with the second season and really stood it's ground. It had found it's voice. Lucky for us. The season's metaphors for it's horror and monsters was more deeper and meaningful Some examples being date rape in ""Reptile Boy"", step parents in ""Ted"" with a creepy John Ritter and more. It was just all better. The Buffy/Angel love affair came into full bloom and was dazzling with every single frame. The psychotic vampire duo of Spike and Drusilla arrive in town in ""School Hard"". They are the Sid And Nancy of vampires. They are to be the main villains, until a shocking turn of events at the end of episode ""Surprise"" changes everything. So many things happened this season. Revelations were made about Oz in ""Phases"", Angel's past in ""Becoming Part 1"", teacher Jenny Calendar in ""Innocence"", Giles' younger days in ""The Dark Age"" and much more. The episode ""Passions"" was a strong and devastating episode. Horrifying, sad, shocking. That's Buffy for you. The ability to be scary and deep and make you believe it, to turn around and have something really funny happen or said. The show does it so seamlessly. The show can be great camp as well. The show also knows that. They don't take the campy stuff seriously at all. One U.K. website said otherwise a while back, but that's because they didn't know any better. The camp doesn't come often, but when it does it shows that they are all in the joke. The audience gets it. Some detractors don't. Buffy isn't camp. It can be, but that's only for fun. It can quickly turn around at the drop of a hat and attack you with serious, unrelenting drama that is usually better than most acclaimed dramas on air. Buffy never gets that kind of recognition because it's called ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"". Oh well. Buffy became notorious for killing off a much liked(or loved) character. One happens here that shows you that anything can happen in Sunnydale. No one is safe. James Marsters as Spike and Juliet Landau as Drusilla are real finds. They are definitley two of the most interesting characters to grace television screens. The cast is in fine form here. The gang were all on target from the beginning, but they just keep getting better and better. They are real. Some may have odd lives and unearthly abilities, but they are still real characters with real, normal everyday problems. That has always been the genius of Buffy and creator Joss Whedon. Take real issues and turn them into horror stories. Brilliant. There are a few mediocre episodes here, like ""Inca Mummy Girl"", and ""Bad Eggs"". But even the worst episode is ten times better than most good shows on T.V. Season two headed for it's final season story arc in the two part season finale ""Becoming Part 1"" and ""Becoming Part 2"". It's an epic tale with great moments and great shocks. It made viewers want to fast forward immediatley to season 3. Buffy has always been one of the richest shows on T.V. with it's lush direction, sharp wit, deep stories, impecable mythology, incredible acting, and so on. Season two delivers the goods. The extra features here are a lot more generous than the extras for the season one DVD set. Thank you Joss for that!. We got audio commentary from David Greenwalt on a couple episodes; An interview with Joss Whedon; TV spots; Still gallery; and a whole lot more. It's a deluxe package. It is not meant to be missed. If you are a Buffy detractor, it's time to wake up and realize what it's all about. Leave the dark side and come on over to the smart side. I can't wait for season 3 DVD. It's my favorite. Keep on slaying Buffy!.",1020384000,,3643,4.640866873065016
1260070,5,B000035Z1R,"what you have here is a teen show that clearly begs for and deserves a wider audience. very few programs targeting that demographic can make such a claim.
the buffyverse is very baby-boomer friendly ..... with a caveat or two. you have to be able to get past the name ... the premise ... and the theme song. not a problem for this fifty-something ..... but, as with anything, your mileage may vary.
to these jaded eyes, the writing and the spirit of buffy touches everyone who has lived through this turbulent period of life. buffy's high-octane blend of comedy/drama/horror is pure guilty pleasure ... whedon's world is unique .... the dialogue is deft and clever (albiet modernized) and moves at a brisk pace .... the characters engage ... and the stories hit the mark much more often than not. JW stacked the deck for success on buffy with some truly inspired casting choices. gellar positively shines in the lead .... and hannigan's ""willow"" is beyond adorable .. ASH, marsters and dushku among others all do exemplary work here.
that all being said ......
many of the reviews here may leave one with inaccurate assumptions regarding the show .......
first ..... the statement ""season 2 is clearly the best of the series"". a highly debated topic. the truth is that ... quality wise ... season 2 & 3 are very difficult to separate. a side by side comparison IMO gives season 3 a SLIGHT edge. season 2 devotees would counter that the finale .. ""becoming part 1 & 2"" (a legitimate high-water mark) is good enough to settle the debate. i would counter with ""season 3 has a little higher percentage of *excellent* episodes"". i must however state that i am splitting hairs here.
finally ..... and this is a huge misrepresentation .... comments to the effect that the show is getting better ever year are utterly and completely bogus. after MANY viewings of every episode of the series, a few things become clear.
season one felt like a good show gaining its equilibrium. a very watchable 12 show package with two episodes that belong on a ""BTVS greatest hits"" DVD (angel and prophecy girl).
season two and three as stated before would occupy the lion's share of the ""best of"" package.
season four takes buffy to college and signals the beginning of the end for many long-time viewers. the simple fact is that the show was made-to-order for the high school setting. with angel and cordy leaving to start ""angel"" (the spinoff) and a different environment, a period of adjustment for the fans was required. watching these episodes during their first run was equal parts entertaining and a bit of a letdown. while the show was easily as good or better than what passed for good TV at the time, it still suffered when compared to the high bar set by seasons 2 and 3.
season five .... at this point i feel i must reiterate that comparing buffy episodes to other buffy episodes is VASTLY different than comparing buffy episodes to other TV programming. that said, i must say there was a palpable feeling that the show was losing altitude. the highs (the body, fool for love, crush, etc) were there, but the average quality of the remaining episodes was slipping. the feeling among devoted fans was that the success of the show offered joss too many distracting new opportunities. whedon delegated the responsibility of running BTVS to his assistants while he attempted to oversee the ever growing buffy empire. while as a whole season 5 was still very watchable, the nagging memory of the mercurial high school years diminished the experience. whereas season 4 seemed to improve with a second viewing, season 5 did not.
season six ... what can i say ... this hurts. to this point, outside of the musical (which was STELLAR), this year's episodes are sadly lacking. it's not that the episodes aren't well crafted ... it's more the spark that once propelled the scripts is somehow diminished. i still watch ... i still have faith that it can be turned around .. at least i want it to. the feeling that joss is spread too thin at this point is hard to escape. his absence from the proceedings and the repercussions thereof cannot be ignored.
seasons 1 thru 3 fall into the ""love at first sight"" category. seasons 4 and 5 require an extra showing or two to fully appreciate. season 6 will take a bit longer ... at least for me.",1019347200,8,4314,4.677631578947368
1260071,5,B000035Z1R,"Hands down, season two proves to be by far the best of all the seasons. A showcase of the true genius of Joss Whedon and David Greewalt, season two has such classic episodes as ""Halloween"", ""Reptile Boy"", and ""Becoming"" which match pithy humor with angsty desperation. Sara Michelle Gellar confirms her truly amazing range, ultimately allowing Buffy to demonstrate a mixture of innocence, wit and strength. Of course this season has its downsides, none more depressing than the Cordy/Xander coupling, but the introduction of Seth Green's stoic OZ and increased attention given to David Boreanaz's Angel quickly make up for it. Season 2 Buffy also provides a nice contrast for any Angel fans who are wrapped up in the engaging 3rd season Cordy/Angel romantic subplot (myself included)...its always nice to go back and see Cordy do some pining.

Season One was mostly fun and games, Season Two really captures the people. ""Passion"" is one of the most well scripted beautifull episodes I have ever seen in the show. The story arcs are brilliant and the acting flawless. If you have never seen Buffy, I would actually advise you to buy this season first. If you like what you see, buy the season one as well for the collection. I would say more but there is really no point. I'll just say what everyone else says.

1260075,5,B000035Z1R,"Some consider the third season to be the best of the series, I
tend to disagree. The second season starts out slow, the show
obviously trying to find itself. The early loss of the obvious
new reoccuring villian (the Annointed One) strikes the show a
blow, and although Spike and Drusilla manage to be nothing like
the Master; they still seem somewhat derivative. However, the
storyline that begins on Buffy's birthday is a masterstroke, and
the emotion of the following episodes cuts to the bone. The series doesn't let up, and the two-parter that ends the season has never been topped. I wouldn't be surprised if people who saw that episode for the first time started crying. By all means, buy this set, and prepare to be blown away.",1017446400,3,734,4.6976744186046515

In season one Buffy started out as a sleuthing show, similar to a Nancy Drew or Hardy Boys book, where Buffy and friends solved a different ""case"" each episode.  Season two took the show to another level, by developing the charactors and putting the punch into the series, relationships are built with the charators that forever alter the theme of the show.  Also, season two reveals secrets, betrayals, and twists unimaginable.
I believe the boxset will be a ride from beginning to end, sure to make any new Buffy viewer a devoted fan, and to give  fans like me something to watch over and over again.",1017273600,,743,4.481481481481482
1260097,5,B000035Z1R,"""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" began its first season, displaying a brilliant trademark sense of humor, drama, horror, and emotional realism. And for what it was, it was great. But compared to the seasons that were to follow, it was only a brief glimpse of what brilliance could come out of the Slayer mythology.
The second season is described by many fans as the best season of ""Buffy,"" but I would argue adamently against that. Yes, I love it, as I have every season, but it is only the ""best"" in a nostalgic sort of way, since the show has changed a great deal since then. Although some say it has gotten worse, I think it is the only show I've ever watched that has gotten consistently better and better from season to season. Each season's story arc is stronger than the one before, and as the actors matured and grew into their characters, and new characters were added, ""Buffy"" became a true television masterpiece by the fifth season.
Also, while the second season has a brilliant year-long story line, with some great ""mythology"" episodes, and some great stand-alones, it is not a consistently great season, and actually is the one that has the most weak, disposable episodes, more than any other season.
""Some Assembly Required,"" ""Reptile Boy,"" ""The Dark Age,"" ""Bad Eggs"" and ""Go Fish"" are all weak episodes. ""Buffy"" is such a well-written show, with such great continuity that I will say that all of these episodes do have something worthwhile about them, whether they be a few great scenes, the great acting, or an important character development that comes out of one of these episodes. But these are still not-great episodes.
On the other hand, this season also boasts some brilliant stand-alones, most notably, ""I Only Have Eyes for You,"" a postmodern ghost story that is effective as a standalone and yet also ties into the story arc of the year, brilliantly analyzing the characters.
""Halloween,"" ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered,"" and ""School Hard"" were great episodes with a comedic bent. Equally great were all other stand-alone episodes of the year.
And the major story of the year--the Buffy/Angel relationship is pure genius the whole way through. It leads up to one of the emotionally gutwrenching and beautiful episodes of any show in TV history...""Becoming.""
This season is very well-worth owning. The great episodes you'll want to watch over and over, the not-so-great ones all have their own values, and you can continue to see from the first season the evolution of television's best show. What was always great about ""Buffy"" is how organic it is. The show has changed cast members and locations even a great deal, and yet that was never a detriment. The constant change has kept the show fresh, vital, and brilliant. Beloved characters die, new ones come, new villians crop up, etc etc. The show now, in its sixth season, is still the best thing on TV, so the second season was great, but it is only the first year of brilliance.",1016928000,3,2959,4.826771653543307

1260101,5,B000035Z1R,"Building on the first season, this second season is often seen as the best by many long-standing fans.  This is perhaps a wise choice as it is season two that really proved to the critics that `Buffy' was not just some ordinary science-fiction drama.  Through use of metaphor the show has transcended its apparent limits.  For instance, a boyfriend turning `evil' after the heroine sleeps with him and puberty being shown as being literally monstrous.  If it were merely the show's intelligence that was standout then it certainly would be interesting to watch.  However season two manages to combine various elements to prove once again that `Buffy' is one of the best TV shows at the moment.
This season has a distinctly gothic theme in accordance to its knowing nods to its several references.  Yet maybe it is the pop-culture heavy dialogue and references from sources as broad as Humphrey Bogart to `The Exorcist', that make this show so original.  With its intelligent themes it has won over the critics whilst its solid stories and clear knowledge of what being a teenager is like have endeared it to countless people from all age groups.  In a particularly clever device, school is literally hell.
One thing certainly worth noting is the acting though, which is never less than excellent.  It would be pointless to reel off names, yet Sarah Michelle Gellar brings a real vulnerability to her role as the slayer and is perfectly complemented by David Boreanaz as both her loving boyfriend and ironically her worst enemy.  Also worth noting are the several new characters that appear in the second season such as Oz (Seth Green), Spike (James Marsters), Drusilla (Juliet Landau) and Kendra (Bianca Lawson).  Whilst obviously centring around Buffy, the show does well to manage to progress all of its other characters as well.  For instance, all of the main stars have an episode which is revolves around them, notably Xander with `Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered' and Willow and Oz in `Phases'.
With a winning formula of absolutely laugh-out-loud comedy, the programme has also managed to stage tragedy and drama effectively as well.  Whilst the many comic episodes are superb, the pivotal and overwhelmingly tragic episodes are what really impress.  Yet what is even more impressive is the fact that each of these episodes remains distinct and outstanding in its own right.  In particular, `Passion' is devastating after an effective and genuinely scary build-up of tension.  The mid-way episode `Innocence' has such a tenderly moving and upsetting final scene that it manages to evoke tears without death or injury.  Season two manages to go out with a bang too, with a two-part finale which promises the end of the world.  Under many directors this could well have been reduced to just a cheesy plot, yet writer and director Joss Whedon manages to create a real glimpse at the horrors of adolescence and has mastered all of the themes that seen synonymous with the genre, especially friendship and love.
Season two is a showcase for a show that not only has unerring popularity yet is also unerringly brilliant, witty and intelligent.",1016150400,9,3146,4.994252873563219
1260102,5,B000035Z1R,"I do not consider it hyperbole to talk about the second season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" as scaling operatic heights, culminating with the glorious aria of ""Becoming, Part 2,"" which I still relentlesly tout as one of the ten best dramatic hours on television I have ever seen in my life.  I have watched a lot of television and have been teaching classes about this topic for over half my life, so I believe I can make a pretty convincing case.  We witnesses the potential of this series in Season 1, when creator Joss Whedon held off on the revelation that the mysterious Angel was really a vampire, who just happened to have a soul and loved the Slayer, until half way through the abbreviated first season.  In Season 2, we find out just how far true love can go wrong.
Love continues to be a very painful thing for the Scooby Gang, as Cordelia (""Some Assembly Required""), Xander (""Inca Mummy Girl"") and Joyce (""Ted""), find out.  Then again, prospects look much better for Willow (""Phases""), although we never really do take the Cordelia-Xander romance (""Go Fish"") to be anything more than a cosmic joke, which does offer up the delightfully twisted ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered"" as the exception that proves the rule (footnote: Buffy spends most of the episode as the Buffy rat because Sarah Michelle Gellar was hosting SNL that week).  Of the off-arc stories, ""Halloween"" and ""Ted"" are clearly the best of the bunch.  But when it comes to romance, Buffy and Angel are truly on the road to hell paved with the best of intentions.
It is clear in the season premier episode, ""When She Was Bad,"" that things are different.  When Buffy dances seductively with Xander, taunting him with her sexuality, the ante has been upped considerably.  The pivotal point in the season comes with episode 13 (of 22), ""Surprise,"" when Buffy unknowingly undoes Angel's curse on the night of her 17th birthday by making love to him.  Why the gypsies put in the Faustian (in the Goethe sense) escape clause via the moment of true happiness and contentment is debatable, but the galvanizing effect on the show is truly impressive.  When Angelus brutally slays Jenny Calendar in ""Passion,"" leaving her body in a grotesque display for Giles to discover in his bed (while opera music soars in the background), it is the symbolic Hellmouth of the show opening up.  The audience is shocked into realizing how bad things can get, only the worst is yet to come.  Giles's anger buys him one shot at Angelus, but Buffy has to rescue him.  They turn on each other in anger, and Buffy actually slugs him to the ground before they collapse weeping in each other's arms.  Buffy tells him, ""I can't do this alone,"" but this proves to be most ironically incorrect.
Clearly Whedon constructs each season around two half-season story arcs.  The first half of Season 2 heralds the arrival of Spike and Dru, and the quick departure of ""The Annoying One.""  Of course now we look back and are amazed at what James Marsters has done with the role of Spike, but at this point it is Juliet Landau's ditzy psychotic vampire who provides the flair of the dark side.  Whedon brings the first half to a climax in ""What's My Line?,"" the show's first two-parter, where we are introduced to Kendra the Vampire Slayer.  It seems Buffy's brief moment of death at the hands of the Master in ""Prophecy Girl"" has some long reaching implications we only begin to appreciate at this point.  But with the return of Angelus everything changes.  Spike and Drusilla are trying to reassemble the Judge, a grotesque who cannot be killed ""by any weapon forged.""  Then everybody learns the truth about not only Angel's transformation but also Jenny's betrayal.  Thus begins the deadly game of cat and mouse between Angel and his former allies, which culminates in the two parts of ""Becoming.""
Both parts of ""Becoming"" are written and directed by Whedon, and represent the apex of his work on the series.  When Angeleus opens the portal to Hell, only his blood can close it, but things are not going to be that easy for Buffy.  The dramatic culmination contains the best fight sequence (with swords) in a show that prides itself on innovative staging of its fights, and is an ultimately emotionally shattering experience captured beautifully by Sarah Michelle Gellar's slow dissolve into tears while the haunting Sarah McLachlan song ""Full of Grace"" is played. Joss Whedon had set this moment up from the first episode of the series. It is a payoff usually reserved for the final episode of a series and not simply the end of the second season. ""Becoming"" is truly an astounding accomplishment in the history of dramatic television and when you watch the entire second season again you can appreciate how brilliantly this shattering conclusion is set up.
The original theatrical film was a teaser, the first season on television was an appetizer, but the second season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was epic and once you see this, whether again or for the first time, you are not going to want to stop here.  It is especially nice to see that the extras have gone up a couple of notches for the Season 2 DVD collection which is clearly priced to be accessible to BtVS's loyal fans.  Yes, we all appreciated having the entire first season, just like our Buffy brethren across the sea, but certainly we expected more goodies from Whedon and crew, especially given the high quality of ""The Watchers Guide,"" the show's official companion volumes.  Clearly there is a lot of thought put into this show, which means any and all insights and looks behind the curtain are greatly appreciated.",1015977600,151,5629,4.758478931140802
1260103,5,B000035Z1R,"With the features-packed DVD of ""Buffy"" Season 2 due to hit our mailboxes any month now, it's time for a look back at the episodes that arguably turned the show from closet-watching fascination to cult phenomenon.
Season 2 was ""Buffy""'s first full-length run of 22 episodes, up from 12 the previous spring.  David Boreanaz (Angel) joined the cast full-time, and in his first episode, ""When She Was Bad"", it's clear that his feelings for Buffy have not gone away during the season hiatus.  The romantic tension between the leads is intense in the season premiere, with Buffy challenging Angel to a fight (which would come back to be very important later), and Xander and Willow nearly kissing.
""School Hard"" introduced the season's recurring villains, Spike and Drusilla, the ""Sid and Nancy"" of the vampire world.  Spike hunts down Buffy through dark school characters, and Principal Snyder drops the first hint of the dark Sunnydale conspiracy of silence.
""Inca Mummy Girl"" and ""Reptile Boy"" are two fun monster shows.  David Greenwalt, later the driving force behind the ""Angel"" show, will give audio commentary to the latter story, and this is anticipated to provide a great glimpse of how he's influenced both shows.
""Halloween"", ""Lie To Me"", and ""The Dark Age"" explore the characters of Giles, Angel, Spike and Drusilla much more thoroughly, each showing scary glimpses of their dark pasts.  The first of these stories introduces the recurring warlock Ethan Rayne, an old ""friend"" of Giles.  The second features Jason Behr, who appeared in every WB teen series ever.
""What's My Line?"", a two-parter, here with audio commentary by executive producer Marti Noxon (another huge cog in the ""Buffy"" wheel), introduces the notion of the ""second slayer"", sends the Buffy/Angel romance to a new level -- and features a surprising coupling between two other regulars.  It's the first of the season's three two-parters, and you'll be impressed to know that this is the weakest of the three.
""Ted"" is notable for Special Guest Star John Ritter.  At the time, this bit of casting was seen as a triumph for the show, just getting attention in the national media.  He's a great psychopath, Jack Tripper-style.
""Surprise""/""Innocence"" is the next two-parter, presented with Joss Whedons commentary.  ""Innocense"" moved ""Buffy"" from Monday nights to Tuesday, getting out of the ""Seventh Heaven"" shadow and anchoring its own night on the WB.  Buffy and Angel have their moment of true happiness; Xander and Cordelia give Willow a moment of true unhappiness, and suddenly Spike and Drusilla are no longer the only villains.  These two hours are among ""Buffy""'s greatest achievement.
""Phases"" is a funny werewolf show, moving Seth Green's popular Oz into the inner-circle Scooby Gang.  ""Bewitched, Bothered and Wildered"" is Xander's comic Valentine's Day nightmare, with another appearance by Amy the teen witch.
""Passion"" revels again in ""Buffy""'s ability to kill off regular characters.  Many BtVS fans name this their favorite episode of all time.
The season ends with a final two-parter, ""Becoming"", and when part two aired, the four-month hiatus until Season 3 began, became unbearable.  These two hours show, via flashback, the origins of Drusilla, Angel, and Buffy.  The Buffy/Angel ""forbidden romance of all time"" comes to a shocking conclusion, and Spike comes to a sudden decision about his loyalties.  Pay special attention to his fight with Buffy at the beginning of Part Two.  Five years gone by, he's still with us.
The final episode changes every basic premise of the show, and if you haven't seen it before, you'll be left stunned.  Indeed there's barely a rotten episode in the bunch, with only a couple of the 22 hours you won't watch more than once.  With a sixth disc full of production featurettes, and hours of commentary from the production time -- and at an extremely reasonable price for a 6-disc set -- this is the must-buy DVD set of the year.",1015891200,59,3953,5.052307692307692
1260104,5,B000035Z1R,"Most everyone who I know that watches BTVS feels that the second season is the best, and I couldn't agree more.  The scope and sequence of the shows is truly amazing, from episode one in which Buffy sports a nasty 'tude in dealing with the Master, to the last episode where Buffy must make a heartbreaking decision about Angel.  What happens in between these shows is an expansive list of entertainment:  the introduction of Spike and Drusilla; Zander falls in love with an Incan mummy; Buffy attends a fraternity party only to find out something evil lurks in the basement; the first Buffy Halloween episode; Giles's past comes back to haunt him and his friends; the original second slayer, not Faith, but Kendra, is introduced; Angel's past is revealed; Oz is exposed as more than human; Zander getting more than what he bargains for in the Valentine's Day episode; Angel loses his soul, becomes evil again, and kills one of the characters on the show; that bad, blue dude, the Judge, is assembled and plans to destroy the world.  I haven't even mentioned ""Some assembly required"", ""Lie to me"", ""Ted (with John Ritter),"" ""Bad eggs,"" ""Killed by death,"" ""I only have eyes for you,"" or ""Go fish.""

Season Six (which is currently airing with new episodes on UPN) parted from this formula with a kind of slow season, but its really picking up now. I recommend that you order this DVD becuase it is so worth it, and better than the first season, with a pretty low price, compared to X-Files, Twin Peaks, and Sex and the City.

1260118,5,B000035Z1R,"The second season continued one what was successfully started in the first season.  The second season is a lot more ambitious (remember, the first season only had twelve episodes, unlike the rest which had 22).
  The story arcs in the second season are brilliant.  The romance between Angel and Buffy reached gothic heights with Surprise/Innocence (Surprise is astonishing).  When Angel turns bad, David Boreanaz manages to do a sensational job of acting the transition (the episodes ""Passion"" and ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" are incredible in detailing this, and Buffy's reaction).  Willow's romance with Oz is wonderful, and Giles attachment to Jenny Calendar a welcome addition.
  This show still manages to be surprisingly funny (as seen in Halloween, and Bewitched Bothered and Bewildered) and packs a wallop (the two part season ender, Becoming I & II, are essential viewing for any Buffy fans.  They are incredibly moving).  Yes, there are some clunkers (Killed by Death, Bad Eggs), but they are more than redeemed.
  My favourites are: Becoming I & II, Surprise/Innocence, I Only Have Eyes for You, Passion, School Hard, When She Was Bad, and Lie To Me
  For a show set in high school, the writers have neatly side-stepped making a caricature of Anthony Stewart Head's librarian/Watcher Giles.  His befuddled sexiness is immensely appealing.  Alyson Hannigan's performance as wallflower Willow blooming into a witch (her growing powers are smartly charted by writers all the way through season six) is strong, and having the animosity between Xander and Cordelia boil over into lust was a masterstroke.  Finally, we have to give the star her due.  Sarah Michelle Gellar proved with this season that she's actually a capable actress, both with comic timing (Halloween) and pathos (Surprise/Innocence).
  The second season was an immense improvement over the first season (a solid debut) and the quality continues.  In my mind, the second and third season need to be bought together (or at least both bought).  Story arcs introduced in the second season are wrapped up in the third season.  Buy this set, you won't be disappointed.",1015632000,277,2136,5.145348837209302
1260119,5,B000035Z1R,"The second season of Buffy is on its way, and it's about time.  With the second season, we get the full 22 episodes instead of the 12 of the first season.  We also get to see all of the cast members really find their characters.  Sarah Michelle Gellar simply shines in this season, reprising her Buffy character and in doing so, brings us along as she matures while dealing with high school, a boyfriend (Angel, a vampire to boot), and her mother finally discovering that she is the Slayer.  Willow (Allyson Hannigan) begins her foray into Wicca (which will play heavily in later seasons), and gains a boyfriend as well (Oz, played by Seth Green)).  This season is where the show finds itself.  Xander, Cordelia, Giles, and Jenny Calendar, all are here and start really bonding together until the scoobies really come together as a unit.
 This season has MANY great episodes, and the story arc that builds is considered by many as the best of all the six seasons of Buffy. This is the season where we see Buffy and Angel become both lovers...and worst enemies.  David Boreanaz plays his evil-self part very well, and many will argue that the 2-part season finale (Becoming 1 & 2) are the best episodes of Buffy period.  One of the other things we see is Spike (James Marsters) becoming a likeable villain.  This will pan out in later seasons.
 For Buffy fans, this DVD set is of course a no-brainer.  For those who have not watched the show, or don't understand the passion behind the fans, this is the season that will open up your eyes.  Ignore the fact that the show sounds like some teenie bopper flick show...it's not.  I highly recommend it.",1015545600,34,1647,4.595890410958904

I own the first season on DVD, and am excited to hear that second season is in the works.  The filming techniques and acting can only get better, in my opinion.  Season two flows much better than the first season, drawing away from the slightly choppy filmography, and some of the best characters that have ever been on the show are introduced, including my favorites, Spike, Angelus, and Oz.  The underlying storyline really takes off at the beginning of the second season, and comes to a tear-jerking climax in the two-part finale, ""Becoming, I and II.""  Joss Whedon's baby is pure brilliance, and I can't wait for the later seasons to be released.
Buffy is a show that the teen audience can really identify with.  Even though Buffy is a superhero and must stop the apocalypse numerous times, she's also trying to live a normal teenaged life.  Unfortunately it keeps getting interrupted by her sacred duty.  Her character is a role model to young women, showing them how to be strong and brave, albeit under unusual circumstances.  The simple epitaph on her headstone at the end of Season Five read, ""She saved the world a lot.""  And she did.  In these circumstances I am glad the movie was a complete flop, because otherwise the amazing cast members that have been introduced to us over the years would still be out bartending or walking dogs for a living.
All hail the creativity of Joss!  (Just kidding.)  Thanks, Joss, for changing pop culture with your cult t.v. show.  We appreciate it.",1015459200,3,1583,4.7299270072992705
1260122,5,B000035Z1R,"When I first viewed The Buffy Angel Chronicles set, I was hooked. I have purchased/read/viewed most all the published story lines of the BTVS and Angel.  Sure I get weird looks from adults when they ask about my favorite TV/book stories (after all, I'm f51). But a hobby is a hobby and imagery with love, pain, hope, fear, terror, good/evil, fun, friendship, loyalty, suspense, and all with great writers/editors/directors/actors; can be a really wonderful experience.  I purchased Season 1 DVD and can't wait for Season 2.  In season 2 the actors really refined their acting abilities.  It's a great year to see again.
  It's tough to review a DVD that's not out yet but after viewing BTVS on FX this season, I expect the DVD to be superb since it won't have cuts for more commercial breaks.  FX really chopped scenes to make those cuts for the... commercials.  All my recorded vhs tapes are worthless because of this.  (Maxwell 8 hrs vhs suppliers made out big though.)
  Price is a little steap though.  What warrants this steap price anyway.  It may make me wait until the price drops some before I buy.",1015113600,9,1107,4.703125
1260123,5,B000035Z1R,"Season 1-3 are by far the best seasons with the best episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Season two is the highlight.  I easily would rate this the best season.  The episodes are all high quality.  And the mid season climax Innocence forever changes Buffy.  The season finale of S.2 is *THE* Best.  Becoming pt 1&2 will forever and always be my favorite episodes, even though right now we're in season six.  I would recommend this DVD season to anyone who's a fan, old or new.  Because seriously, this is the best season.  (if you haven't already gotten the point:))",1015113600,6,569,4.61
1260124,5,B000035Z1R,"This is the season where the Buffy cast hit its stride.  There is a rich tapestry of plot and myth associated with this show, and most of it started in season two.  Sadly, most of you who read this review are already sold on the quality of the show, but there are legions who would be dumbfounded by the consistant quality if they could only get past the title.
  Do yourself a favor - take a chance on a sure bet.  This DVD is guaranteed to entertain.  Pick it up and be amazed.",1014854400,22,479,4.096774193548387

The show was okay, but not really for me. I'm not a fan of supernatural vampire type shows. I watched two seasons of Buffy, which is more than any other vampire series I've watched, but it was enough for me.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520985600,,1697,5.565891472868217
