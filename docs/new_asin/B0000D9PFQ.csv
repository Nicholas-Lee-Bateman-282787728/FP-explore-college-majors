1921504,5,B0000D9PFQ,"This film is a must see for any fan of literature or of film.  Not only did Mark Moskowitz manage to pull off an absolutely fantastic first documentary film, he also managed to dig up and help re-establish a lost American literary genius - Dow Mossman.

1921506,3,B0000D9PFQ,"This documentary is too long by half and a structural shambles, but the gay subtext is fascinating. The male director, an ostensibly married man who lives in a homiosocial world as virile as Robert Bly's, becomes enamored of a lost male novelist he has never met.
He searches obsessively for him, eventually finds him, and, in the closing frames, walks off with him into the sunset. The only woman allowed a speaking part is the director's yenta mother. The director's ""wife"" will only allow her feet to be shown.
One could debate the sexual orientation of the director, but not his obsessive devotion to the writer.",1075593600,19,616,4.820754716981132
1921507,1,B0000D9PFQ,"This movie is a very, very long three hours. I disliked it not in a scolding way but because it induced boredom to the level of panic, a desire to flee the theater.",1075075200,25,164,4.0
1921508,5,B0000D9PFQ,"Wow, I love this film! Upon hearing about Stone Reader's big double win at Slamdance Film Festival, I made sure to catch it here in New York at the Tribeca Film Festival. I raved about it to a legion of friends that took my advice and caught its' theatrical gallop across the country. They loved it too. In the same way that seeing Rocky for the first time caused me to chug glasses of raw eggs (I was just a kid), Stone Reader put me on a reading binge that is still going strong today. This film single handedly re-awakened my atrophied appetite for literature and once again I am making time to read. The film is incredible for taking a potentially dry subject (literature/lost writers) and making it a suspenseful, dramatic, educational, cinematic journey along a fulfilling story arc. And who could ask for a better ending? I went back to see it in the theater two more times so that I could copy down all the book titles mentioned. I bought two of the special edition DVDs for Christmas presents and was impressed by the depth of material (two discs) and creative design. Thankfully the DVD contains the extensive list of book titles that I had to scrawl down in dark theaters. I submitted this review because I noticed a couple of cynics out there trying to drag this film down. When highly regarded professional film reviewers like Roger Ebert and Janet Maslin make a special effort to acknowledge an independent documentary film like Stone Reader, you can be sure that it is GREAT! Buy with confidence.",1074902400,7,1511,4.620817843866171
1921509,5,B0000D9PFQ,"When I learned the film was finally coming to Portland, Maine (things move a little more slowly up here!), I was eager to see it, and brought a friend. We both loved it. Loved it. I was struck by Dow Mossman's story, of course, but also by how courageous director Mark Moscowitz was in pursuing his passion, investing time, energy and resources with no clear outcome, right up to the moment when he called Dow on the phone for the first time. I so support that way of being. What is there to lose? And how much to gain!
The story is a true love story in its own right -- so affirming at a time when the world is so crazy and volatile.",1074902400,5,634,4.120967741935484
1921510,1,B0000D9PFQ,"I remember seeing Stone Reader last year in a theater and thinking it was more interesting in the talking-over afterward than in the seeing. My main problem with this documentary is the gimmicky approach to the emptiness of life without books, an approach that does not convey what books mean or what they're for. An hommage to literature and reading can't be paid through a trick shortcut to profundity (i.e. an unconvincing search) or a filmmaker's inarticulateness. The sad truth is that most books don't make people think, and print is as neutral as a TV screen. Books are not magical objects, but that's how this rhythmless movie treats them.",1074470400,28,647,4.890909090909091
1921511,5,B0000D9PFQ,"This unique documentary is especially effective. It is more than a search for a book author, it is a love story to reading and books. Lovers of literature should definitely see this film.",1072915200,7,187,4.696969696969697
1921512,1,B0000D9PFQ,"I saw this film in a theater shortly after it came out in 2002, at the urging of a friend who is a documentary film maker. Ten minutes into the film, I said to my friend ""This film is so contrived it's nauseating. I'll bet I can find Dow Mossman with Yahoo!'s people search in minutes."" We sat through this excruciating movie where Moskowitz does everything possible to NOT locate Mossman. He wastes the viewers time with visits to the graphic artist who did Mossman's cover art, despite knowing such artists never meet, much less know, the authors whose books they do cover art for. He goes and talks to countless people who's only common thread is that they'd not have any legitimate reason to know where Mossman was. The bottom line is that since in the end Dow Mossman was in the phone book living in the house he'd lived in for decades, when we got home from watching this film, we did find Dow Mossman's home address and phone number on Yahoo1 in a matter of minutes. Bottom line is that Moskowitz spend a lot of time and money going through nothing more than a masturbatory exercise. Had Moskowitz bothered to live in the 21st Century with the rest of us, he'd have realized when making this movie just how silly the premise of this movie is.",1344297600,,1249,4.458515283842795
1921513,4,B0000D9PFQ,"To me, this wasn't just about him tracking down Dow, but every writer who wrote their one story, then vanished, but so did the book! The doc also sparks interest in many other ""lost"" books. Salinger isn't around to discuss what his life was like for the past 40 years, John Kennedy Toole isn't around to discuss ""Confederacy of Dunces"", but Mark captured Dow on film, and even if people have their issue with the documentary, it succeeded in what Moskowitz set out to do. Just a book he remembered from childhood that he didn't get at the time, revisited it and blew him away, and began his journey into what happened.

1921514,5,B0000D9PFQ,"If you love the written word--to read it, to write it, even to LOOK at it sitting on the shelf--I urge you to ignore the snarky reviews here and see this film. Have you ever read a book and utterly fallen in love with the author's voice, so much so that you want to devour everything that person has ever written? If so, you will be captivated by STONE READER. The experience of watching the film is akin to sinking into a comfortable chair with a richly imagined piece of creative nonfiction. The cinematography is lush, the music captures the reflective nature of Moskowitz's journey, and there is a genuine emotional payoff to his quest to find an author. If you read to have a quick, slam-bam-thank-you-ma'am experience, maybe this won't be your cup of tea. But if you like to slow down and EXPERIENCE a good book, to savor every syllable and regret reaching the last page--watch this film.

In the film, Frank Conroy says something that perfectly explains my personal experience with the written word, both as a reader and as a writer: ""It's like food, you know? There are some pleasures that simply never run out, and books are one of them. In every way, simply diverting yourself from life, you enter worlds that you couldn't possibly enter in any other way. You feel the pressure of another human soul on the other side of the book, and that makes you feel less alone, and less trapped in your body, and less isolated. You feel that you are the brother of the author and the two of you are working together. It's a very profound and moving experience. It's almost spiritual. When I read Dickens, the old man might just as well be sitting right next to me--that's how close he is. I feel him right there; he's with me.""

I came to the film just two years ago--and never knew a thing about Moskowitz lobbying for votes, so really, I couldn't care less. I have watched it at least a half-dozen times and it warms my soul each and every time.",1275868800,4,1946,4.47887323943662
1921515,5,B0000D9PFQ,"I find it sad that so many people panned this movie.  There is an unmistakeable element of cynicism in those reviews -- a cynicism that reflects the negativity and misantropy that's rampant in today's culture.

I thought the movie was excellent.  I can count on one hand the times I've seen a movie that, at certain points, made me cry.  This was one of them.  For example, when Mark Moscowitz calls Dow Mossman on the phone, introducing himself for the first time, they arrange to meet, whereupon Mossman says: ""I hope I don't disappoint you."" ... That was deeply moving.

There is also a fascinating *subtext* to this movie.  On the one hand, Mark Moscowitz took a certain path in life that garnered for him ... a nice house ... a nice income ... a wife, a home and children in the suburbs -- while Dow Mossman took an entirely different path.

Moscowitz creates political ads (the truth be damned!); Mossman, on the other hand, in writing his novel sought the truth so intensely that he nearly went mad.  In fact, in the voiceover commentay Mossman says to Moscowitz, in so many words: You're better than what you're doing.  Society should have something better for you in mind.

In one of the DVD extras Roger Ebert, a strong advocate for the movie, says to Dow Mossman: I wish you could do a monologue for an hour a day on National Public Radio.  Such is the brilliance of Mossman's observations and even-while-meandering thought-process.

I came to this discussion site thinking that not one person would have panned the movie; that it would be heartless not to be moved by the arch of this story -- ""a man reborn,"" personally, professionally and artistically.

Not to dwell on those among us who are so negative but, frankly, I find the criticisms of the movie sophomoric.  SO what if Mossman could have been discovered sooner.  So what if the film quality and sound qulaity aren't always great.  So what if Moscowitz included pictures of his house and children and backyard in the movie.  That's not what the movie is about, knucklehead!  Mark Moscowitz *isn't* a smooth, easy-to-swallow narrator.  He's not a craftsman when it comes to making a movie.  Quite the opposite, and that works for the movie, the amaateurishness of it.  because the amateurishness of the ""production values"" only underlines what the movie is about -- CONTENT.  Ideas, discovery, sharing, openness, vulnerability.

At first I didn't know what to make of Mark Moscowitz.  But then I realized how much I respected him.  Respected him because he loved books.  And, no, he wasn't ""showing off.""  Moscowitz and Mossman have a quality that all great teachers, all great communicators have -- ENTHUSIASM.  ""En theo"" -- the god or spirit within.  You can't help paying attention to them because all the while you're saying to yourself: ""Hey, if this guy is so excited about what he's saying then I guess there's something to it, I better pay attention. ... Because truly enthusiastic people should be *encouraged* in our cynic-laden society.  They should be respected, not sniped at.

One criticism of Moscowitz is that he's pushy.  Forgive me but this strikes me as the kind of comment someone would make who *judges* as opposed to *understands.*  Judgments are easy; they're as common as you-know-whats.  And I don't mean belly buttons.  Understanding, on the other hand, is what life and art and repect for the other person is all about.

The world is a big place; filled all too many sad, boring, uninspired, unenthusiastic people.  So that when a handful come along who are excited and engaging and not afraid of showing thier love for books and ideas and the creative process in general (I'm of course speaking of *all* the people in this movie) -- then when push comes to shove, I'm on those guys' side.  Because one thing people like that *aren't* is cynical.

Finally, I have the feeling that the people who gave this movie a negative review --from the comfort and anonymity of their computer desks -- hidden, anonymous and, as such, ""private -- I think those people would perhaps be not so judgmental if they had to express their snipping, belittling remarks in a forum of living, breathing people.  I think if that was the case, that is to say, if this discussion was taking place after the showing of the movie or perhaps in a classroom that the shallowness of their remarks might embarrass them.",1266969600,3,4385,4.770252324037185
1921516,1,B0000D9PFQ,"This is a documentary--of sorts. It documents an irrationally organized 'search' for a 'lost' author that ignores the very basics of investigation. You would learn a lot more about how to locate someone watching old episodes of Perry Mason than this movie. Driving aimlessly around, not using the phone effectively (or the internet for that matter), and basically just making silly choices--that's what the narrator does throughout this overlong and at times painfully dull film. The director is obsessed with himself and devotes far too much screen time to rambling, narcissistic monologues. Few of the questions he asks are interesting, and his analysis (literary and otherwise) is devoid of insight. In short, this is a very boring movie that has completely muffed the opportunity to examine an interesting novel by an interesting man--instead we get a movie about a boring man ineffectively looking for an author using mind-numbingly stupid methods. The only redeeming qualities of the film surround the actual novel ""The Stones of Summer"" and it's intriguing author.

Skip this one--if you're interested in the topic, just buy the book and read it.",1263686400,2,1153,5.266304347826087
1921517,3,B0000D9PFQ,"To a bookworm, the plot of the documentary The Stone Reader is irresistible. Filmmaker Mark Moskowitz fell in love with a 1972 novel titled The Stones of Summer. Moskowitz found that Stones' author, Dow Mossman, had never published another novel and had vanished. Moskowitz then began a years-long quest to find Mossman and ask what had happened.

It's a shame that Moskowitz could not quite make a film that lived up to this promise. Moskowitz spends far too much time on trivial aspects of the search for Mossman. We see, for instance, Moskowitz flying to Florida to interview the designer of Stones' dust jacket. The man has already told Moskowitz that he doesn't remember creating the dust jacket; when Moskowitz arrives in Florida we learn that, indeed, the man doesn't remember. This two-hour film should have been cut by at least thirty minutes.

Moskowitz never establishes why Stones was so meaningful to him; amazingly, after watching for two hours you still don't know what Mossman's novel is about. Moskowitz is socially backward and has trouble engaging other people. This is a huge flaw because Moskowitz fails to recognize some of the best stories that he uncovers. (Most members of the literary community are very helpful, but Moskowitz has trouble interacting with them). I agree with Mr. Weeks of Blacksburg, Virginia, who wrote that the film spends far too much time on the filmmaker and not enough on Mossman.

Bookworms will still want to see this film. The joys of finding an ""undiscovered"" book make reading all of the mediocre books worthwhile. For all of my frustrations, I still enjoyed The Stone Reader.",1260662400,2,1630,4.985294117647059
1921518,5,B0000D9PFQ,"If you love literature, literary criticism and discussing the art and craft of writing and publishing, watching this fascinating film will be time well-spent. Explores the spiritual role and place of literature and authors in our emotional lives; the price authors pay for leaving bits of their heart and soul in the pages of the books they write; and, the underlying, unspoken theme that luck, or ""the roll of the dice"" often plays a cruel role in whether a writer's efforts will result in commercial and/or artistic success or abject failure.

The dialogue consists of a series of conversations between the producer and those individuals he interviews. Asking probing questions about favorite books, Mark Moskowitz progresses to a discussion of the impact of one book that he read at eighteen -- titled ""The Stones of Summer"" by Dow Mossman.

Though the book has been out of print for more than 25-years, Moskowitz becomes obsessed with the idea of trying to figure out why it did not become a commercial success; why there is so little information available to inform readers about the author; and, why no other books ever appeared in print by him. Moskowitz determines that the novel was likely one of the last fiction books published by Bobbs-Merrill before that company went in a more commercial direction. But, it perplexes him that even though the book received excellent reviews -- including one on page four or five of the New York Times Book Review -- Dow Mossman appears to have dropped off the face of the earth.

Moskowitz' obsession turns into a most interesting quest as he goes off in search of anyone remotely related to Mossman's book to interview -- up to Maine, down to Florida, across to Pennsylvania, and then finally out to Iowa. He then offers interviews of Mossman's agent, the book cover designer, literature professors who may have known him, and finally one who taught and mentored him while enrolled at the Iowa Writer's Workshop.

I enjoyed how Moskowitz used the book and author as a medium through which he talked about the impact of books and the spiritual kinship readers often feel toward authors whose works we love. Though the film is really something of a facinating ""acting out"" by the producer regarding his obsession, the quest to find this author that affected him so deeply so many years ago is an ejoyable jaunt for all.

I won't give away the ending -- but, will, simply say: If you love books and often feel a spiritual bond with the writer whose works you read -- go immediately and buy or rent this beautiful, deeply moving documentary.

1921519,4,B0000D9PFQ,"This is a fun documentary in which the director is a participant in the story of finding the author of what he considers a great novel.  If you enjoy books, you will likely enjoy this.",1244332800,4,184,4.257142857142857
1921520,3,B0000D9PFQ,"I can fully identify with a book that haunts you and even one that it seems you are its only reader in the world.  Thus the tracking of this youthful literary passion was one I was fully prepared to follow and enjoy.  It was even possible to overlook the fact that there were next to no women writers in the lists of great reads.  For many of us this was the sad truth.

However, about a third of the way through this became a film about Moskowitz and not about reading or Mossman or The Stones of Summer.  Moskowitz deserves a lot of credit for caring about reading in a way too few do, but when he interviewed people, he was actually often disrespectful, wanting to ask his questions or be focus of attention.  Maybe that is the editing.  It was particularly disturbing to see how he treated the man who finally connected him with Mossman, William Carter Murray.  In my culture, there is be more respect for the older man's wisdom and his role as mentor.  Moskowitz insultingly calls his mother and asks her to call Mossman, after Murray has asked to be able to do it.  It is clear when Mossman talks to his mentor he is thrilled to do it.

Nevertheless, if it hadn't been for the Murray portion, which was the best part, Moskowitz's interviewing technique could be forgiven - even the times he tries to either put all his books in front of an interviewee or tries to eagerly take things out of their hands. He also paws through things that are not his.  He obsesses on finding the contract, which should have seemed odd to Mossman. It is strange that he loses interest in the film, which undermines the seriousness of his passion in a sense, although the cause is a personal loss. Seems odd as well that he should be entrusted with bringing the book back, by both author and agent. And is Harry Potter an appropriate comparison to The Stones of Summer, as we see in the final scene with the boy?

Perhaps this old-fashioned respect for readers and writers makes me wish the reader/director had been a bit less prominent in a very touching, profound tale. That would have kept the reading process and the genius writer more in the forefront.

The topic shines for its devotion to reading and the written word.  I will read the book which is out of print and which I ordered online, and will continue to think about the best reads of my own childhood and youth.

1921521,2,B0000D9PFQ,I was eager to view STONE READER as soon as I heard about is since  the story of promising writer (Dow Mossmon) who seemingly vanished off the face of the earth after publishing one well received novel (The Stones of Summer)  is intriguing.  Director Moskowitz takes this fascinating idea however and pads his movie to a two hour plus length  with information and lingering shots seemed designed to convince the viewer of the brilliance and specialness of HIMSELF!  If this movie had been maybe an hour and a half in length and Moscowitz had stayed on his side of the camera the film could have been great but instead this effort is mediocre and annoying and I'm being generous. Some of the scenes are obviously staged and I am more than a bit incredulous that Moscowitz would have had much difficulty in finding Mossmon in the era of people finding internet search engines.  I was also disappointed by how little attention Moscowitz and the other literary people he interviews give to women writers.  Even with all that I would have been willing to give the film three stars since parts of it are well made but then I come on the Amazon site and find our friend Moscowitz has been involved in a scheme to get people to write positive reviews of his film even if they have never seen it!  No wonder media hog Moscowitz was so fascinated by reclusive Mossmon since they are true polar opposites.,1204416000,6,1394,4.592741935483871
1921522,3,B0000D9PFQ,"Although hailed as a great film for people who love reading, this film's first love is clearly filmmaker Mark Moskowitz. His work on political campaigns is painfully evident throughout the troublesomely concocted ""storyline"" of his ""quest"" to find one-novel wonder Dow Mossman. He's sometimes visibly distintered in what the subjects of his ""interviews"" (which he typically dominates) have to say, preferring to use almost everyone as a prop in a story which is more about his own life than Mossman's.

He carefully massages what ought to have been an afternoon's worth of phone calls into a journey which crosses many miles to talk to vaguely related people who often have no knowledge about anything he wants to talk about (he TRAVELS to interview the illustator of the novel's original cover-- who, it turns out, has almost no recollection of the event). It quickly becomes clear that he is staging almost everything for the camera, and, since most of the people he talks to don't know or don't care about the subject of the film, the majority of it focuses on his rudely cutting off experts to get his own opinion on film or just generally dominating the discussion to harp on and on about his supposed love of reading (not to mention a good deal of name-dropping to demonstrate how well-read he is).

This is all hugely annoying, and made even more so, because the acutal subject of the film --dealing with author Mossman and the world of writing and publishing in general-- is actually very interesting. Mossman's book is a very good (though sometimes frustratingly obtuse) read, and his story begs deeper exploration. Instead, even when Moskowitz finally reveals Mossman to the camera (after about twenty minutes of obvious milking the ""Mystery"" when Mossman's wherabouts should have been about one phone call away) the focus of the film gets right back to Moskowitz's agenda to get the book re-published, shamefully ignoring Mossman's real life after spending the whole film ostensibly tring to discover it. This is after two hours of focusing on Moskowitz telling us about his OWN life.

Still, if you can survive the contrived setup, overlong runtime, and rude and self-interested director, there are easily 30 minutes of extremely interesting interviews with literary figures and with Mossman himself. This alone justified sitting through the film for me, providing real insight into some fascinating and oft-unexplored areas of life.",1164326400,12,2445,5.092269326683292
1921523,5,B0000D9PFQ,"Filmmaker Mark Moskowitz's inspired documentary, Stone Reader, begins with the singular notion of uncovering more of writer Dow Mossman's literary works. Upon discovering that Mossman's body of work began and ended with The Stones of Summer, a highly acclaimed but mostly forgotten first novel, Moskowitz sets out to learn how a writer, and a work of such promise, could have vanished with nary a trace. In the process, Moskowitz treats us to some delightful detective work that introduces us to an engaging cast of characters - critics, writing instructors and literary agents among them - who provide the clues to the puzzle that is Dow Mossman, but ultimately reveals the painful story of Mossman's creative odyssey. The search for Dow Mossman is at the heart of Moskowitz's story, but so is his love of great literature and the sad truth that talent is almost never enough to achieve literary success. It is a story told with sometimes ordinary, even mundane snippets from daily life - mostly Moskowitz's, his family and friends - that is at the same time deceptively complex. Stone Reader reminds us of our own lives and the daily struggle to make sense of the world in which we live. There are no happy endings, just the discovery of good ideas, great literature and the desire to create a thing that has truth at its center. Watching Stone Reader is not unlike receiving a present that, when opened, reveals other, smaller presents within which surprise and delight as we unwrap them, none more delightful than the present that is Dow Mossman himself.

It takes an elusive subject, the love of reading, and structures it around a search for an elusive novelist who seems to have disappeared after publishing what filmmaker Mark Moskowitz considers a wonderful novel. Camera in hand, and traveling across several states, he eventually tracks down his man, but along the way we learn much about book publishing, the teaching of writing, and the various experiences of authorship itself.

In particular there is the surprisingly common experience of the one-book author, who achieves recognition with their first published book (e.g., Harper Lee's ""To Kill a Mockingbird""), never to publish again. The film also memorializes the experience of young readers who fall under the spell of reading, their lives and relationships to others forever touched by the pleasures of immersion in the written word.

1921527,1,B0000D9PFQ,"than see this t*rd again.

My wife and I had heard about the elusive film so we went on an investigative journey to track down the genuis filmaker Mark Moskowitz. Our first stop was to the local produce stand (it took us over 23 minutes to get there) where suprisingly, our green grocer had never heard of this great work of art and refused to mark down bananas.

Discouraged, we then cleaned up dog poop in the back yard and pondered our next move.

We found ourselves strangely gravitating towards the pet store (13 minutes), as we heard that filmaker Moskowitz had once owned a pet. The pet store had never heard of Moskowitz but ironically mentioned that cat litter was on sale.

We cursed our bad luck and cleaned our pool with a large net, retrieving leaves and filtering our thoughts as to our next move.

In a mad stroke of inspiration, we drove across town (7 minutes) to a local coffee shop, where rumor had it some people there read books. We ask a few of these ""readers"" if they might tell us where we could find this brilliant filmaker Moskowitz. OUR FIRST BREAK, one of these ""readers"" suggested that we try a new path called ""the video store.""

What luck! Although tired and weary from our endless search (my friend's cat had passed away, and my wife and I longed to hear her purr for one final time) there was a ""video store"" just across the street.

If only we had used what some people refer to as TELEPHONES we could simply have called ahead.

After seeing the movie, I question my own sanity. ""Why, OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WWWHHHYYYYYYY"".

The horror.

But I was eager to view the film, so I set aside a time to sit down with a glass of iced tea and an open mind.  I love this film.  Forgive me if I state the obvious here; the film is a documentary.  Within that genre, there are documentaries which are structured in the same way a memoir might be... as the reflections expressed by the central character... but The Stone Reader is not all about Mark Mosokowitz... it is somewhat about his love of books, and how he came to be a reader... but he does allow some fascinating people to simply talk about the mystical processes of first writing a great novel--then finding an audience for that novel.  As all writers know, most works do not go forward simply on their own merit.  It is tragically true that one can write a searingly brilliant piece of work and still have it turned down for publication countless times.

There are two distinct types of people who will love The Stone Reader.  Writers will love this film because, yes, we need that validation.  We need to hear that ""there are no rules in publishing"" and that Faulkner had a job shoveling coal for 12 hours a day and that, yes, brilliant novels ""slip through the cracks"" and do not get read.  It is a brutal, solitary life we sometimes lead in order to pursue our passion.  Readers of good books will also love this film, will love hearing the titles mentioned--old friends that they haven't heard from in years.  I had forgotten how Catch 22 and Tender is the Night changed my life in high school. I want to visit them again after watching this film.

I was already crying by the end of The Stone Reader... but the best part, the little bit that touched me the deepest, was the tag line at the very end.  As writers, we work alone in the dark, pouring our hearts into the words we string together.  Then we set them adrift on the open sea of humanity, hoping that someday, somehow, they will be swept up by someone and appreciated, whether as a moment's brief delight or as a life preserver to someone drowning in sorrow or something in between.  It took Mark Moskowitz 25 years to finally read The Stones of Summer.  When he did, his life was changed.  I think his film depicts this quite nicely.",1123545600,8,2482,4.4131868131868135
1921529,5,B0000D9PFQ,"I found this film fascinating - I had never read ""The Stones of Summer"" before, nor even heard of it, or the movie.  But anyone who complains that the film focusses too much on the filmmaker hasn't noticed the title of the film -- ""Stone READER"" -- it is a film about the journey of the young boy who first read Mossman's book and is now searching for him.  It is not a film about Mossman or even so much about writers - it is a film about readers of books, and especially this one reader.  The movie explores many themes, including the quest to find out more about an author you love and why some books and authors catch on and others do not.  The very aspects of the film that others seem to find annoying, I found fascinating -- as we watch this filmmaker search and head down blind alleys, and yet keep searching.  If you enjoy a good quest, if you have ever wanted to write to or go visit a favorite author, or if you just like a good story, I would highly recommend this film.",1109116800,29,982,4.147368421052631
1921530,1,B0000D9PFQ,"Mark Moskowitz has to be kidding.  His documentary has little to do with ""The Stones of Summer"" or the author Dow Mossman, and everything to do with himself.  What possesses some documentarians to make meandering, mindless films about their ""search"" for their alleged topic?  Moskowitz is arrogant and thoroughly unlikeable in this two-hour ego trip.  I read the reviews and really wanted to like the film, but Moskowitz made that impossible.  The best parts turned out to be his interviews with various professors about writing in general, but these moments were few and far between, and ultimately had little if anything to do with Mossman.  The rest was Moskowitz dragging the viewer around the country on a whim, revealing very little about the book and author, and everything about what a pushy, feckless, self-centered opportunist Moscowitz is.  I bought the two-DVD set and wish I'd saved my money.  And now there's a three-DVD set?  Exactly how much material (and money) does Moscowitz think he can mine from this hack job?  Dow Mossman was grossly ill-served by this filmmaker, and that was the last thing he needed.",1107907200,9,1125,5.0

Instead of ""Stone Reader"" serving as the payoff I believed I deserved after slogging through the heaviness of ""Stones,"" I was, unfortunately, subjected to spending close to two hours as an intimate of Moscowitz, whom I found to be one of the more irritating people I've encountered recently.

Perhaps it was due to his habit of interrupting the subjects of his interviews midsentence after inexplicably foisting stacks of obscure paperbacks in front of them that bothered me to such an extent. Maybe it was the way he ran around Mossman's house as if he owned the place. Regardless, I was completely incapable of developing any manner of fellowship with Moscowitz in his 'quest' to find Mossman. Perhaps it's a leap, but his on-screen persona leads me to believe Moscowitz is the type of guy who'd rather show you the list of books he's read without actually ever taking the time to develop the capacity to say anything substantive about any of them. This deficit is all to apparent throughout ""Stone Reader,"" and is, in a literary sense, completely incongruous with what one who has read this great book would expect from a documentary about it.

A worthwhile project, poorly executed.",1107302400,4,1514,4.929411764705883
1921532,3,B0000D9PFQ,"This is the kind of film to make every writer's heart go pit-a-pat.  An overlooked writer finally recognized.  A forgotten book rediscovered.  This is the dream of every writer who turns up his nose at mere readers and writes the kind of book his teachers and the critics say is a great book.

The unstated assumption (or ""subtext"" if you want to sound hip) of this documentary is that it was the greatness of the book that caused it to be finally discovered and promoted, and the lack of taste of readers and absence of promotion from the publisher that caused it to fail in the first place.

But was it?  In spite of a lengthy documentary and hours of talk by ""literary"" figures, we still do not learn much about this book.  The fundamental message is that the disappearance of this book from public view was a mistake.  Is this true?  That is the crucial question.  If the book does not give us, the readers, much of anything, then the publishing-promotion system is functioning the way we want it to function: ridding the shelves of dead wood.  If the book IS rewarding, then the system is not serving us, the readers, whomever else it might be serving.  We already know that the book publication-promotion system frequently shoves in our faces books that give us little or nothing.  To show that omitting this book is really the crime against humanity that the filmmaker wants us to believe it is, he needs to show us that the book does give us something.  And this, he is less than successful in doing.

So, what did cause the book not to sell?  What did cause the filmmaker to like this book so much?  Causal assertions are easy to make but difficult to back up.  The book couldn't possibly have failed, could it, because the book was tedious, boring, insipid, with characters that you wouldn't even want to share a brief subway ride with.  No, that couldn't be the cause.  And the factor that caused this one reader to like it so much?  It couldn't be something in his own personal life that this book dealt with?  Or that the book exemplified the criteria that the filmmaker was taught define a good book?  Or that he and the author happened to come from the same social background, so the book rings true?  No, impossible!

We'll never know until it's too late--until we've bought the bloody book and found out the hard way.  Probably a few people will like it.  Certainly, many people will praise it because now everybody else and the critics are praising it, and they always like such books because they have good taste.  But some of us will wonder: if the book was all that great, why didn't he make a movie of it, like ""Possession,"" instead of a documentary about finding the author?  Or did he try and couldn't get anyone to put up the money?

The bottom line is that, in fact, some good books ARE not promoted--and readers lose out as a result--and that some worthless books ARE hyped--and readers are snowed as a result.  The problem is not whether books should be promoted or not, but who decides, who controls the means of book publication and promotion.  Is there a level playing field?  Does every writer have an equal opportunity?  If you believe that, let me tell you about this bridge I've got for sale.",1106697600,6,3227,4.525951557093426
1921533,1,B0000D9PFQ,"One thing is certain, no one will try to track down Mark Moskowitz twenty years after seeing this ego driven exercise in self aggrandizement.  Firstly, because the movie is so singularly uninspiring, but also because after this film we already know more about Moskowitz and his life than we would ever want to.  Billed as a journey to discover the fate of a writer and a book that made some impact in the Seventies but then very quickly disappeared from the public's attention, the movie comes off rather like a puff piece about Moskowitz himself.

Alternating between lack luster interviews, drawn out sequences of ""beauty shots"", and ""grind the film to a halt"" observations and ruminations on his own life, the film plods along like a grotesquely elongated political ad.  Scenes include: ""Moskowitz shaking hands"", ""Moskowitz cleaning his pond and does regular guy stuff around the house"", ""Moskowitz driving to around town"", ""Moskowitz hanging out with regular people"".  His ham handed camera tricks and ""made to look unrehearsed"" set up shots remind one of the worst of Home and Garden Television (think of Bob Villa ""interrupting"" people hammering nails or laying tile.)

The film's bloated two-hours-plus running time could easily be cut down to ninety minutes, but that would take away from the posturing Moskowitz is so fond of.  Technically, the film is weak.  The camera work and editing are amateurish, and the music is repetitive and even annoying in places.

He does find the writer at the end, although not without stalling to create ""a more dramatic,"" albeit boring, journey.  The story of Dow Mossman is summed up in five minutes of screen time.  He wrote a book, he went crazy, he moved in with his mother, he now lives in the home he grew up in, and he never published another word.  An opportunity to investigate the role of mental stability in determining why some writers complete just one book and then quit writing???  Not in this film.  Moskowitz instead uses this brief sojourn into the life of Dow Mossman to springboard the film back to his favorite subject, himself.  The film then becomes a heroic struggle, of Moskowitz, to return the book to the public eye and get it republished.  Not an easy task, as Mossman, the silly boob, has lost his original contract.  Moskowitz's frustration is palpable as he is forced to deal with this addled writer more interested in welding helmets than in being famous.  Of course this guy fell from the public eye, he are invited to think, he knows nothing of self-promotion!

I get the feeling that Moskowitz lost confidence in his subject matter somewhere in the process of making this film, and what we see here is an attempt to make ""something interesting"" out of a story of a crazy writer who was ""one and done"".  It is never much fun to sit through a film that has been ""salvaged"" from a failed idea, especially when it wasn't the idea that failed but rather the filmmaker's imagination.  The story of Dow Mossman and the price of his genius could make a great, thought provoking film.  Unfortunately, that story was lost somewhere in Moskowitz' home movies.",1105920000,11,3128,4.829268292682927

1921535,5,B0000D9PFQ,"I had the opportunity to view the Stone Reader earlier this month. It was a extremely well done film because Mark Moskovitz has an unpretentious, guy next door style of helping the viewer discover what the meaning of ""great books"" is all about.

Not only did I find Dow a humble, modest, literary genuis but what I found most interesting were the comments and epilogues shared on the second DVD. Dow's former editors, publishers, mentors and other cronies in the field of *lit* really summed up what the key to a *good book* is.

The key is what the reader holds not the writer when opening the book and turning the pages. Dow and other writers without literary pretensions but heart, soul and eclectic imagery wrote stories that opened the doors to readers from all walks of life, all ages bringing the readers together as much as the stories in the Stones of Summer come together as you read Dow's novel.

Hats off the all the academics on the DVD who pooh poohed the stereotypic notion that ""great works"" are only comprised of books that follow a certain ""writers code"" or fall under a certain genre.

How true that what matters the most is that the author writes about what matters to him and her. What's far more important is that the book breathes authenticity and that the young, the old,  the rich, the poor, the big and the small are connected not divided by the work(s) of a true *W*riter. In every sense of the word.

To hear the stories about Dow's ordinary life post-authordom and about the stories of many other one time novelists who settled into the backrooms and backalleys of their everyday lives, never to be heard from again cannot help but leave the viewer of the Stone Reader asking ""why?""

Moscotvitz sets out to answer that question and in turn asks many more questions and receive answers from all sorts of individuals without directly answering the question about why Dow never wrote again.

It's a film that leaves the viewer igniting in sparks with a clear validation that *the great books* create cohesion amongst readers, not divisiveness. The tiny insular overeducated academic or cliquish literary crowd is only one small tiny piece of the pie.

The pie which is devoured from start to finish when readers from all walks of life come out of the wood work to sing the praise of the Stones of Summer.

And more importantly to sing the heavenly hymns pertaining to the most important thing about reading and the work of authors: to bring people together via their shared

 love of books and reading, regardless of the book per se...be it sci fi, romance, mystery, non-fiction, western, classics, new age, chick-lit, eighteenth century lit studied in PHD classes or Curious George with torn and scribbled pages...

We absolutely loved it and were literally brought to tears, having been so moved by the director's love of reading and his lengthy search for an elusive author.  We bought the special edition DVD from the Stone Reader website, and I recently ordered several copies from amazon to give as gifts this Christmas.  If you watch it, be sure to check out the bonus features for additional recommended reading.  My advice to anyone interested is, if you love books and love reading, then you will love this movie (and be as perplexed as I am by some of the negative reviews herein).  I hope that there are some bibliophiles out there who will give this movie a look merely based on its subject matter, and NOT waste time scrolling through some of the nastier, baseless reviews, because 1) I think the movie works better without the viewer having pre-conceived notions about its arguable shortcomings (and certainly is more fun to watch without knowing what will happen - as many reviewers so boorishly and carelessly report here - duh!) and 2) any review that refers to homosexuality in the movie is DEFINITELY posted by someone who has either NOT seen the movie, or has ulterior motives (and furthermore, I find it curious that labeling something as gay - especially in the field of creative arts - is supposed to automatically be interpreted as a kiss of death; this movie is not at all about anyone being gay, but even if it were, would that alone make it worthy of a negative and hateful review?!  Puh-leeze.).  And finally, yes, okay, maybe the director is a bit egotistical in his telling of the story (which didn't faze me at all when watching it, by the way), but I agree with another reviewer who rightly pointed out that we all can get carried away sometimes when we feel so intensely about something... and that intensity (about books) is what you should have in order to really love and appreciate this movie. I actually wrote to Mr. Moskowitz after seeing the movie, and received a lovely, thoughtful letter in reply - so don't fall for the director-bashing reviews - he's just a guy who loves reading, and if you do too, then you'll LOVE Stone Reader.",1100563200,22,2313,4.613138686131387

1921539,2,B0000D9PFQ,"I really don't know where to start here. Most of my feelings about this film have been covered by other negative reviews...but I felt the need to write one.

 This film IS worth watching...if only for its rare moments of book-lovers expressing their thoughts. The premise is interesting as well...and the payoff of finding the author is satisfactory in some ways.

 HOWEVER, I offer a caveat to those thinking about buying this film. The director is one of the most off-putting people I have ever seen do a documentary like this...in the tradition of Nick Broomfield or the guy who did that Michael Jackson expose last year, Mark Moskowitz has the ability to drive the viewer batty.

 There are a few things that almost brought me to the brink with this guy. The worst is how, after finding the author of the long forgotten ""Stones of Summer,"" he basically doesn't even let the man speak to him on the telephone...interrupting him by childishly putting another man on the phone & then cutting him off mid-sentence to put off discussion until the next day. It is moments like these that make it very apparent that MM is holding back information from the viewer for effect...I think that he knew a lot more about his subject before he lets on in the film & holds it back from us to lengthen his film & search for Dow Mossman. I find this offensive & upsetting...because it's so damn obvious. The film could have easily been an hour shorter & would have benefitted from a lot of cuts.

 Watching MM tear through Mossman's house at the end looking for the contract of the book is one of the most uncomfortable scenes I have ever seen in a documentary film. Since Dow's mother had passed away just a month earlier, I would think he had no energy to stop this madman from tearing through his house at will, otherwise I think he would have flipped. If ANYONE ever dared come through my home like that, grab boxes & papers right out of my hands as I went through them, I'd wring their neck.

 Needless to say, it's moments like these that make the film a difficult one to watch in the end. But I will not go so far as to say not to watch it...because there are bright moments from many of those interviewed. The love of books comes through, even from the director, it's just really hard to deal with this man's overzealous & pompous approach toward the people he encounters that will cause much squirming as you watch his lengthy movie.

Mark Moskowitz' documentary about his search for the long-forgotten author of a book that he loved succeeds at something that I've never seen another movie even attempt.  It revels in the joys of reading and makes devoted readers seem like members of an extended family.  I enjoyed the meandering style of the film.  Finding Dow Mossman, while being an important part of the film, was never the entire point of it.  The conversations about books and authors and the long, lingering shots of shelves full of books is not the filler that some people felt it to be; it goes right to the heart of what this film is about--the love of books.  There are some interesting characters in this movie, too.  I liked Mark Moskowitz' style, enthusiastic but kind of goofy.  I can't remember the name of the old man who was in close contact with Mossman during the writing of the book (Frank Conroy?), but he was delightful, full of good humor and the love of reading.  Mossman himself was a pleasant surprise, not at all the disheveled, disturbed recluse that I had been fearing to see.

1921541,2,B0000D9PFQ,"Stone Reader (Mark Moskowitz, 2002)
It seems like a documentary that would be tailor-made for a bibliophile. Mark Moskowitz, book lover, pulls out a book he tried to read years ago and didn't like. This time around, he finds it brilliant, and decides to buy everything else the author wrote. He can't find any other books by the author, and thus becomes obsessed with finding him. Along the way, he talks to teachers, scholars, other bibliophiles, and the like. It's all about the books.
All of which is great, in theory. In practice, well, the end result is boredom. Moskowitz himself is not much of a charismatic individual, and much of his delivery is stilted. Once he gets to talking books, he loosens up, but those he's talking with range from the presentable-at-best to the should-never-be-on-camera. The conversations themselves are sometimes intriguing, but are usually made frustrating by a subpar sound mix in places and a lack of subtitles (which, given the abominable sound quality to be found on most DVDs and videos as a seemingly inescapable consequence of the mixing process, are necessary for any film that goes from big screen to DVD/video). By three-quarters of the way through the film, you find yourself not caring whether he finds his author or not.
Much of the film's problems could have been eliminated, or at least mitigated, if the twenty or so minutes of shots of nothing had been eliminated. (One gets the feeling they are filler to draw the length of the film out to two hours.) Long, immobile takes of Moskowitz cleaning his pond. Moskowitz driving. Moskowitz on a ferris wheel. No narrative. Just that guitar line, which gets really annoying after two hours.
In more capable hands (one thinks, fondly, of Amy Kofman's wisdom in calling Kirby Dick in to do some professional work on her documentary on Jacques Derrida; Dick's intervention saved the film, and made it watchable), Stone Reader could have been something great. As it stands now, it's rather like reading the diary of a twelve-year-old book lover. **",1086566400,5,2043,4.92463768115942
1921542,4,B0000D9PFQ,"Stone Reader is a documentary that is understandably not to everyone's taste but what I found most interesting about it is that it's very difficult to pigeonhole who would be inclined to like it versus who would not.
On the surface it would seem that if you have a considerable interest in books and literature the film would be tailor-made for you as it follows director Mark Moskowitz on his search to find the author of his favorite book The Stones of Summer.  While it would be hard to label Moskowitz as deep (he does come across as kind of a goofball) it does contain some interesting insights into writing and literature, particularly from the point of view of an author.  As is germaine to his theme, why do some authors produce one great work and never produce another?
The film runs about 30 minutes too long - it should cut off right after the big climactic moment but instead goes on and descends into a talking heads picture.  However, leading up to that point, I admit that I was fascinated by the little mystery that Moskowitz had set up and how he was going about trying to solve it.  I can totally understand how some true, passionate lovers of books would find the film to be problematic and Moskowitz to be a buffoon.  Quite honestly, I could have done without the pans through his bookshelves to show us how well-read he is and how versatile his tastes are - it's self-indulgent.  That being said, there's no doubt in my mind that he's done this as a labor of love and as an expression of his passion for a particular book.
The best parts for me are some of the later interviews where Moskowitz is able to more or less spring surprises on his subjects by revealing his motives, all of which eventually lead him further on his quest.  Is it contrived?  In some places, but it was still satisfying on a very basic level.",1086134400,8,1838,4.465671641791045

The reason I even say that is because I met one of the people involved in the making of Stone Reader - after it had been completed.  In truth I purchased the Special Limited Edition just to look at the film making aspect.  I wasn't sure the search for the author of a book that was out of print was going to make a movie I would be interested in but the video aspect my friend was involved in did interest me.  I thought the movie got off to a little bit of a slow start.  As I continued to watch I started to really wonder if the author would ever be found.  I think there are two stories going on.  One story is about the search for Dow Mossman.  The other story is about something I have never given much thought to but probably should.  It's about the kind of energy and committment it takes for an author to start and actually complete the writting of a book.  I started to think about all the books that are written and have merit but never really seem to make it and what happens emotionally to those authors.  To my surprise I really started to get excited about the search for Dow Mossman.  I'm not going to tell you the story but the movie does reach a climax and I found my self pretty excited about what was about to happen.  This is not an adventure movie - but really a journey into the thoughts and the world of writer's.  It is also about one man's quest to understand how someone who wrote such a good book could just vanish. At the end of the movie I understood why it had won several awards at the Slamdance Film Festival.  If you are looking for a film that is relaxing to watch, touches your senses and leaves you with a warm feeling - you'll enjoy Stone Reader.",1084665600,4,1738,4.146268656716418
1921545,3,B0000D9PFQ,"I enjoyed this movie.  I was caught up in the ""quest for the elusive one"" story that reminded me of Roger and Me and even got me to ponder the greater significance of this type of story, (i.e. Apocalypse Now, Roger and Me).  I came up with the idea that a lot of us expect to meet someone when we die, when we reach the end of the quest.  Whether that person is God or someone from your past or whoever.  Perhaps for that reason, Stone Reader is an archetypal story.
Some moments of this movie thrilled me, such as Bruce Dobler's story about how his writing teacher tried to toughen him up into becoming a better writer.  I did notice the amateurish filmmaking technique, but seeing how bumbling an artist Moskowitz was actually made me enjoy the movie even more.
(...) P>When I watched the movie, I forgave the manipulative touches, like filming his friends opening their mail, but after reading all these angry reviews I think stuff like that is pretty unexcusable.  We, as the audience, deserve better.  Moskowitz strikes me as a shameless filmmaker, an uninsightful interviewer and an appalling family man. Reviewers here keep talking about how manipulative and (my favorite) ""soulless"" this movie is.  I give Moskowitz the benefit of the doubt.  I believe he really loves this book and even if he doesn't there are many interviews with writers who really do love literature and have colorful things to say.",1083801600,5,1411,4.703252032520325
1921546,2,B0000D9PFQ,"(...)I saw the DVD version of this film last night and most of its special feature clips, of which there are quite a few (on a second DVD). I thought the film was an enjoyable ramble by an obviously passionate lover of books. Dow Mossman, once found, proves to be a delightful thinker, and I'm intrigued enough by the whole project to seek out his one novel, The Stones of Summer.
After awhile, though, it became evident to me that Moskowitz has bought into a very old-fashioned notion of ""great literature,"" a notion handed down to us from a time when Euro-American men filled nearly every academic, publishing, and book reviewer position. The tendency of such men to universalize their perspectives, that is, to avoid labeling their conceptions of great art as THEIR OWN conceptions, is all over this film. This film is homosocial in that every ""great"" book and author mentioned in it, and every smiling, ecstatic reader and reviewer interviewed, is a man (and with the tokenized exception of Ralph Ellison, white).
So, (...).
I'm a big enough lover of books to have read most of the great white-guy (and Jewish-guy) lit referenced throughout this film, but I've also read many other great non-white and female writers who never get mentioned here. The macho exclusivity of this film would've probably turned me off more it I were not a white guy myself; as such, I've been lucky enough to realize something that I hope Moskowitz isn't too old to learn: that there's a lot more great art out there than the stuff I can ""relate to"" because I somehow see myself in it.
On other thing--you and some of your buddies should rethink your tendencies to fetishize books as collectible objects (like this film's no-doubt-priceless baseballs on their own little display pedestals). It's what a book does in your head that counts, not how much money it's worth.",1083628800,5,1852,4.790625

He said he could turn right-to-the-page of the periodical guide to literature in seconds when he was in 3rd grade.  Clever lad, and fast.  He could fit paperbacks in his back pockets [his wife's jean's pockets are made too small, so she couldn't read as much, hence, couldn't appreciate The Stone Summer and didn't want to be filmed].  Catch-22 excited him, Joseph Heller he imaged was the friend whom he could never find in life.  He didn't wear a wedding ring.  The shots at peeking at other people's books was interesting.
I wished he spend more time with Dow Mossman, he had some immediate dimension to him.  And I did enjoy looking up some of the books I never read.  Overall, I found the filmmaker too erudite and plucky and flat.  I'm not a fast reader and envy those who can, so I could not appreciate it on that level, but the possible subplots I imagined were fun while I watched this movie that was a little different.",1081555200,2,1033,4.54054054054054
1921548,4,B0000D9PFQ,"Just yesterday, the following question was posed to me: Are publishers cutting down in the number of serious literary fiction they provide to the readers? Several aspects should be considered to answer this question and most of them are presented in this movie. It has been a trend in the past that masterful novels become bestsellers only years after first been published. One of the most notorious cases is Heller's Catch-22. Most publishers are guided by profits, and since serious literary work is usually ""financed"" by other bestsellers, economic conditions may hamper the amount published of the former.
This movie is a documentary that shows the quest of Mark Moskowitz to find the author of a book, ""The Stones of Summer"", that marked him deeply and left him wondering why Don Mossman never published another book. The viewer finds himself participating in the search that involves finding other readers of the book, talking with people that knew the author either as his peers, publishers, dust-jacket designers or tutors. Some of the interviews will immerse you in the world of books and you will find yourself either revisiting or discovering masterpieces worth reading. The juiciest interview, in my opinion, was the one Moskowitz conducted with Prof. Fiedler, who has a very interesting view of why there are so many one-book writers.
This movie is clearly made by a book lover for book lovers, if you do not belong in this category you should not even attempt to watch it or you will get bored easily. However, those people that are always eager to learn about authors and their inner turmoil, novels that are worth reading and how the publishing industry works, will find this movie delightful. I must say that I have not read ""The Stones of Summer"" and am not planning to do so in the short-term. Nevertheless, I do not think this fact, or the one that you read the book and did not like it are an obstacle to enjoying the movie.",1078704000,4,1945,4.826347305389222

It made me feel really good that something like this was out there for the public to enjoy.  The crowded theatre made me feel proud to be a reader and this feeling was amplified by the DVD.  Some of the literary allusions were over my head, I majored in History, but others made me smile, if not chuckle aloud.  I also felt that this was too literate to be considered for an Oscar, unfortunately, I was right.  I have leant my copy of the DVD to several in our book club and all have agreed that it was an exceptional film.",1078358400,2,638,4.031746031746032

(Viz.: the Feb. 08 story in the New York Times). As much I would like to oblige, I cannot in good conscience. The tragedy of this unthinking exercise in self-love is that it swells with marginal scenes that do not move the action along and a concomitant storyline that bogs things down even more. The director may have intended the secondary story as comedy, personal revelation or merely filler, but it does not work on any level. Time and again he demonstrates an unwillingness to listen to any of the people he is interviewing. People are mere props for him. This did not  really bother until the staged scene in which he made a prop of his own son, posing the boy tearing open a package and then reading a Harry Potter book.  From that moment on I was repelled.

But if you love to read, and especially read good books, this film is like an unanticipated gift of something you treasure.  (If your reading doesn't extend beyond the King/Grisham/Clancy/Steele boundaries, you should stop right here and perhaps purchase a Jerry Bruckheimer DVD--possibly something with Ben Affleck.) Political campaign commercial director Mark Moskowitz communicates his own life-long love of reading through a search for the author (Dow Mossman) of a book (""The Stones of Summer"") long out of print but hailed upon release thirty years ago.  Along the way, he talks to all manner of book people--writers, editors, agents, critics.  I saw the film twice in theatrical release and loved it: it's very funny, sweet, sad in spots, and intelligent.  The DVD uses outtakes of several of the best interviews to provide much more footage, most of it terrific.  (See esp. the Leslie Fiedler interview, particularly valuable since Fiedler died shortly after.)  BTW, ""The Stones of Summer"" is now available in a reprinted edition, thanks to Moskowitz and the popularity of the film, published by Barnes and Noble.

The meat is there, but the director has no clue where. You lose your appetite with all that fat, i.e the director's dull, meandering search for an A.W.O.L. writer. The gristle is the witless, self-absorbed personal story that leaves you wondering why the director bothered going through the motions. The meat is the interviews with publishing types. To get to it, the butcher makes you chew on indigestible scraps.

This, then, is my first ever review and I am writing to express my extreme shock at the negative reviews and the references to homosexuality ( what film were those people watching??). I had some of the same reactions to the director and interviewer, but I quickly realized that most of us who are passionate about a book can be, at times, obnoxious in our excitement. We feel that we own ,( and maybe even created ), a book that we love and that speaks for us. As for the interjection of the film maker's life into the film - that MADE the film - much like reading an honest memoir can be more powerful than reading fiction - I loved it! My husband watched this movie with me ,(and he is not an obsessive reader), and he was so caught up in it - he looked at me and said, "" I understand how you feel now"". For those of us who don't belong to book clubs because we think our feelings are often too personal to be shared, this movie is heart- expanding. I have  long held the belief that there is unmined gold in old books and prefer them to new ones hyped by talk show hosts. I will own this DVD and look forward to exploring the titles mentioned in the film that I haven't read. I don't expect to totally agree, but then, that is the beauty of reading.

I shake my head in visceral astonishment at the utter profundity of several of these reviewer's stupidity.  Truly.
Anyway, the story behind the film is interesting.  Unfortunately, the filmmaker, at some point, decided the story wasn't good enough and basically made a home movie of his quest without much thought as to why he was doing this or if perhaps his brazen (sometimes rude) approach would translate well onto the screen (it didn't).

The whole idea of making a documentary about tracking down the writer of your favorite obscure book seemed very neat. Unfortunately, the film-maker has very little story to tell and so, instead, subjects the viewer to over an hour of failed attempts to track the guy down. You see him interviewing people who have never heard of the author he's looking for.
""So, you've never heard of him?""
""No... can't say as I have.""
""Heh... isn't that something? Well, what do you think I should say to him if I find him?""
""I don't really know.""
""Yeah. Yeah, I don't know what I'll say if I find him.""
""Huh.""
""Yeah. Heh. So, can you think of any other writers who have written one great book and then disappeared?""
""Well, there was that one guy...""
and so on.
You also get to see the film-maker raking leaves a lot. And driving places. And interviewing people but not really listening to them because all he really wants them to talk about is this author that they've never even heard of.

My criticism is that I couldn't sit through the movie even though I love books and I'm a voracious reader. Stone Reader could have been good if it concentrated more on the book people, but most of it was about the director and his problems. Whenever he talked I just thought about doing my laundry.

I enter this discussion as someone who has watched the Stone Reader DVD,  including the post-film discussions the film's director, Mark Moskowitz. I did not receive one of the thousands of e-mails he sent out begging people to post favorable reviews for Stone Reader even if I had not seen the DVD. My personal feeling is that if this was intended as a joke, it was not a funny one and that most of the people who received it did not take it as such. This feeling is seconded by a previous viewer who did receive such an e-mail and did take it seriously. I assume many of Mark Moskowitz's apologists who posted favorable reviews below did so in response to his e-mail. My thinking is too bad for the rest of us. Who can you trust? I'm afraid not Mark Moskowitz's defenders. The waters have been muddied by his hamhanded attempt to manipulate critical reaction. In my view the interesting thing about the e-mail is how it shows his cavalier attitude toward people and filmmaking. If a story does not conform to his preconceptions, for example the disappearance of Dow Mossman when he was in front of his nose the whole time, he forces a square peg into a round hole, for example making Dow Mossman seem to be hiding. The failure of this film is not that its director doesn't know what to do with the literary people he parades around for his own glorification, but that he could care less about them. I agreed with the reviewer that called Stone Reader a vanity project. Stone Reader tries  to appear weighty and thoughtful but all I was left with was vanity.",1077148800,16,1623,4.47972972972973

My sense is that it was VERY serious. The New York Times believed it was serious too. Why else would Moskowitz send it out? How creepy!
I can't understand the Amazon reviewers who write that the search for Dow MossMan was meaningless. If there was no search there would be no movie. So why did I only give this movie one star.

Salinger's Holden Caulfied says something to the effect that you know that a book is truly great when you wish the author were a friend so that you could call him up and quiz him on the details of the story. Mark Moskowitz clearly felt that Dow Mossman's ""Stones of Summer"" was a novel of that stature and so didn't give up on his quest until he could have those conversations for himself.
I found Moskowitz's passion and some of his discoveries along the way interesting and in some cases, quite moving. (Whether or not the book ""Stones of Summer"" is any good is an entirely separate issue for me.)

As far as questions regarding whether this film has a latent gay message, I will not speculate. I will say that I liked some of the interviews with writers, but those were few and far between. As farfetched as I found the story, I suspended my disbelief. I accepted what I saw as truth.

Even more than a tale of a political-ad filmmaker's search for the missing author of a long-ago ""masterpiece"", it is a story about the love of reading, about how much people love books and how important  certain books can be to an individual.  There are many interviews with publishers, editors, professors about what they consider to be both the most important and most underrated books of the last century, conducted as personal conversations.  If you love books, and talking about books, this is a movie that you can't afford to miss.
As far as the ""gay subtext"" (mentioned by an earlier reviewer) goes, we have to say that we didn't see it, nor did anyone else at the festival apparently, since the subject was never broached in the lengthy panel session afterwards with the filmmaker and Dow (the ""missing"" author).  I suspect that the view expressed by the previous reviewer may be the same fuzzy thinking that sees every tower as a phallic symbol.

Commercial success is not irreconcilable with artistic merit, nor does a bond of admiration and friendship between a writer and a reader have anything to do with homosexuality.  Indeed, the entire message of this movie is the connection between those who write books and those who read them.
If books are in any way a part of your life, be sure not to miss ""Stone Reader"".",1076630400,8,959,4.895061728395062
1921577,4,B0000D9PFQ,"I've read through all the reviews on this site. First off, I'll say that I agree with many. This is a unique and suspenseful documentary about one man's search for the author of a great novel.  Moskowitz's search is illogical, even lacking in common sense...however, because of (or in spite of) that, we are taken on an intersting journey through the world of writing and publishing. While probably about a half hour too long (it meanders a bit towards the end) this film will reawaken any passion a person has had towards reading, and more importantly, will want to make you share and discuss those books with others.
Now, the second thing I have to say about the reviews on this site: many of them are hateful, and intentionally slanderous. This film is NOT about homosexuality, or about the director ""coming out"". This movie is about books and reading and what those things mean to people. There is nothing homosexual about this film! I believe some reviewers are intentionally saying this in order to hurt the film and turn people off of it. This movie is NOT about homosexuality, but about reading. In fact, this movie is completely asexual in nature. Its about books. Period. Stop the hating!!!",1076630400,12,1200,4.769230769230769

1921580,5,B0000D9PFQ,"Had the pleasure of seeing Stone Reader last May at the Angelika Dallas. It's a wonderfully delicious film that deals with books and the people who write them, read them, and love them. It made me think twice about being embarrassed to have so many books on our shelves here (most of which are still in boxes after a 10-ton move to Dallas; most of those ten tons were books) and come to terms with it.
What is remarkable is that this is a film about reading that sends you out of the theatre ready to read at least one of the books that you saw in the film on a shelf, in a stack, shared in discussion, because you will recognize many of your favorites, see some of your ""I really want to read this"" books or ""I tried once and put it down"" books discussed by people who read them, and be intrigued by the themes running through books and the film, the main theme of which is ""remarkable books by 'one-book authors,'"" a fascinating category into which falls the author of ""The Stones of Summer,"" a book with which Mark Moskowitz became so fascinated that he documented his search for that author in this film that covers something no other film has -- a love of reading and books that is both intellectual and visceral, or viscerally intellectual - never dry, always loving.

If nothing else, it gives some assurance that there are still people out there who get excited about what they've read and are reading.  Plus, for people like me who are about the same age as Dow Mossman, there's a bit of nostalgia, a reminder of the 60s.

It is a film for anyone who loves books, not the slick, formulaic ones that often hit the best seller lists then fade away to be forgotten, but those that linger in memory for years and somehow speak to us on a deep personal and spiritual level. It is a film about how difficult the life of a serious writer of fiction can be in our society. I am grateful that the film has been issued in a handsome DVD format.  I purchased one as soon as I heard it was to be released.
I frankly am baffled by some of the vicious reviews posted on this site about this film. There is no homoerotic subtext in this film, nor is it boring.

1921594,5,B0000D9PFQ,"I first read about Stone Reader in the newspaper, right after it had won Best Feature film at the Slamdance Festival. I couldn't imagine how someone might make a documentary about a book he'd read as a teenager, so out of sheer curiosity, I went to my local bookstore and bought the DVD.
  Every book-lover should see this film-and in particular, everyone who has ever written a book should see this film. Stone Reader, which follows director Mark Moskowitz on his geographically diverse, emotionally persistent journey to find the long-lost author of a 1972 novel, is a compelling ode to literature. The novel, THE STONES OF SUMMER, by Dow Mossman, met with some critical acclaim when it was published, but never saw a second printing and was quickly forgotten. But not, happily, by Moskowitz, whose beautiful film gave me a glimpse into the emotional price of giftedness and underscored the uncertainties that are inevitable in every writer's life.
  I have seen other films about books and those who write them, but it's Moskowitz's integrity as a book-lover, his tenacious search for the reclusive author of one that changed his life, which made this film a rare and wonderful experience. As a writer about to have her first novel published, the mystery surrounding the disappearance of Mossman was eerie and yet, sadly, believable. All writers, to some degree, must traffic between two worlds-the real one and the imaginary one-and yet there remains an invisible chasm wherein many of the more gifted novelists and poets seem to fall. Moskowitz, out of a pure love for one man's lyric imagination, has resurrected a single casualty and I, for one, have been enriched.

8000246,5,B0000D9PFQ,"An absolutely brilliant, utterly captivating film about a subject near and dear to me, reading.

And this film addresses a catastrophic need in the U.S., where I have read a number of media reports about the inability of recent high school graduates to write effectively.  If one is having trouble writing, one should be reading more, to learn how its done - just like important authors do.

For me, however, the importance of this film is not what just about everyone else seems to regard as this film's major theme, the search for a lost writer.

For me, the major benefit of this film are the interviews with the many literary commentators, such as literary book critics, professors of writing, one literary agent, and other authors of prose - with the equally priceless commentary contained on DISC TWO of additional outstanding treasures.

If a person took a one-semester course in literature or writing at a high-quality college or university, one would be exceedingly lucky to have as one's professor just a single one - just one - of any of the literary figures who appear in this film or DISC TWO.

The filmmaker's very first interview is with Leslie Fielder, an accomplished author and critic, with an entire lifetime of perspective on literature and authors of literature.  The ""jewel in the crown"" is the utterly fascinating interview with book editor Robert Gottlieb, with another entire lifetime of experience and insights of not only writing, but also publishing - Gottlieb adds more commentary in DISC TWO.  There is another entire lifetime of experience on literature, literary authors, and publishing, from literary critic John Seelye, who authored the key critic's review of Dow Mossman's book..

Then there are the university professors of writing, including Frank Conroy, Bruce Dobler, Robert C.S. Downs, and William Cotter Murray, who have unique insights on, among other things, spotting literary talent and literary ability in their students.

DISC TWO contains the invaluable interview with book editor Betty Kelly, who edited ""lost author"" Dow Mossman's book, for publication.  DISC TWO contains treasure after treasure, including, inter alia, ""Further Conversations,"" ""Roger Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival,"" and the ""Writers Panel"" of young authors.  The ""Writers Panel"" is not to be neglected, or are the short bios of the ""Writer's Panel"" participating authors, indicating their impressively relevant literary credentials, and their credibility.

One young author on the ""Writers Panel"" cogently observed that modern ""editing"" is all about MARKETING to MAKE MONEY, not about promoting artistic literary qualities - and that a modern ""editor"" would have chopped up STONES OF SUMMER into several books, to market, to make MORE MONEY.  Book editor Robert Gottlieb, is the EXACT OPPOSITE, being interested in the artistic quality and literary attributes of book authorship, and marketing that literary quality.

The same young writer on the ""Writers Panel"" observed that modern ""editors"" DON'T edit - an observation with which all of the other young authors on the ""Writers Panel"" nodded their heads in agreement.  Betty Kelly, who edited Dow Mossman's ""Stones of Summer,"" is the EXACT OPPOSITE, because she edited the book for artistic literary content - including length.  Betty Kelly also remarked that she liked ""Stones of Summer"" because it is about the Midwest of the U.S., which Betty Kelly describes as the ""HEARTLAND.""

Robert Gottlieb and Betty Kelly are reveled to be editors of the ""old school,"" exemplifying the best of book editorship.

Both the film and DISC TWO contain fascinating insights into to the literature publishing industry, the ""'gatekeepers"" of literary critics and proper publishing houses, and their critical role in what books get published and what books get promoted to the reading public.

From the readers' end of the spectrum, DISC TWO contains film clips which include public presentations that involve commentary from members in public audiences, which is revelatory - audiences which would never have included some of the ""customer  reviewers"" of this film, as posted on Amazon.

This film, and DISC TWO, are so extremely educational, that they should be mandatory viewing in any college or university class on either literature or writing - they would serve as a powerful catalyst for student discussion.

There is one point in this film which is central to an understanding of the the book STONES OF SUMMER, the book written by the ""lost author,"" Dow Mossman.  This ""point"" is only mentioned as a sort of ""buried footnote"" in the film.  That pivotal, buried point that is that the book's author, Dow Mossman, was educated in  POETRY, not in PROSE, as his academic ""major"" in his undergraduate degree studies, and that his academic education in poetry is reflected in the prose of his book, STONES OF SUMMER.

Dow Mossman's ""Stones of Summer"" seems to be SUI GENERIS, a one of a kind book of possibly a new literary genre of ""prose poetry.""

The film STONE READER mentions, quite a number of times, how so many people who attempted to do so, were unable to become interested in reading STONES OF SUMMER, but never explains why.  I suspect that the difficulty in reading STONES OF SUMMER may be due to its author's academic training in poetry, rather than prose, as well as in most potential readers' corresponding lack of knowledge about poetry.

Due to its seemingly SUI GENERIS status, I suspect that STONES OF SUMMER - like MOBY DICK (who some find to be a difficult read) - will be studied in academic literature and writing courses in the future - there does not seem to be another book like STONES OF SUMMER, because of its unique literary attributes and qualities.

Remember, MOBY DICK was out of print - and virtually unread - for a long period time after it was published, until it was ""rediscovered"" as a great American epic.",1470700800,2,5902,5.084974093264249

We sat through this excruciating movie where Moskowitz does everything possible to NOT locate Mossman. He wastes the viewers time with visits to the graphic artist who did Mossman's cover art, despite knowing such artists never meet, much less know, the authors whose books they do cover art for. He goes and talks to countless people who's only common thread is that they'd not have any legitimate reason to know where Mossman was. The bottom line is that since in the end Dow Mossman was in the phone book living in the house he'd lived in for decades, when we got home from watching this film, we did find Dow Mossman's home address and phone number on Yahoo! in a matter of minutes.

8000255,2,B0000D9PFQ,"The premise of this film is great: a young man buys a book in 1972 after reading a favourable New York Times review and can't get past the first 25 pages. A quarter of a century later he tries again and is blown away. Yet when he tries to find out more about the author he draws a blank, so he digs deeper and deeper. I'd never heard of Stone Reader until I found a copy in my local DVD store and read the irresistible blurb on the back.

There are three problems with the documentary and together they sink what should be a great film. It's too long. It's artificially constructed. And we never learn why the film maker so liked it. This is my main complaint: you take two years to track down the author of one of the most amazing books you've ever read and you don't tell us anything AT ALL about the book? The second flaw is the artificial construction. There are too many staged shots for this to be believable. The author wasn't hiding and could have been tracked down right away, yet the film maker wants us to see the documentary in a certain way and drags us down that road, even as the blatant artifice becomes ever more irritating. Even at the end I was half convinced the whole idea was a fake and we were seeing actors rather than real people.

Somewhere in this is a potentially intriguing film about a man who produced a book when young and found the experience to be so stressful that he had a collapse. He then worked as a welder for 20 years. Stone Reader though is a big disappointment.",1350172800,2,1504,4.255244755244755
