4069825,4,B0034TTKRS,"if your a halloween fan or a horror fan in general this is a very nice one disc set. I am a big halloween fan and always loved the franchise. Halloween 6 the curse of michael myers gets mixed reviews and most feel the directors cut is better and i agree but it will never see a proper release, so shabby bootlegs are only available. I do enjoy the theatical cut too so it was a must on blu ray for me. H20 is the gem of the set and the reason i bought it. its up there right after the original and 1981's halloween II. Most fans really dislike resurrection, I am one of the few who dosent hate it but its still my least favorite. The plot of story is not good, Busta Rhymes hurts the film terribly and there could have been more Jamie lee Curtis. But there are some good scares, the effects are also good and the kill senes are classic Rick Rosenthal who also directed halloween II 1981. With a better back story, more jamie lee and Busta Rhymes axed from the cast this may have been a much better movie. Now the important part, the quality of the films themselves on blu ray. First off the echo bridge U.S versions of  Halloween 6 the curse of michael myers and H20 are horrible. I have seen them and its really not worth the upgrade from dvd. As for these aliance canadian releases its not the case. The curse looks great on bd. First the films have great vivid color and all the films have a good dts hd 5.1 and dts 5.1 tracks. H20 dosent have the best transfer of this set but its in original 235.5 aspect ratio and it looks better than the dvd but it could have been cleaned up more. Its better than the dvd just not as good as the other two films in this set. As for resurrection in my opinion it looks as good or better than the curse. Its unfortunate the worst film in the set looks better than the best film in the set. H20 has some dirt spots here and there. Some senes really stand out and are far better than the dvd of h20. H20 is why i bought the set i think it was worth the upgrade over all. Plus i like part 6 and that looks great on bd as well. Who knows when we will see a better release of h20 and this is as good as its gonna get for a while most likely. So grab it well you can",1318896000,,2199,3.9863945578231292
4069826,4,B0034TTKRS,"For what it is (which is to say, the 3 less impressive (but still enjoyable, if you're a die hard fan) sequels of the original Halloween series*), it is a pretty good deal. The three films Hi-def tranfers aren't bad, and are certainly notably nicer looking than the regular DVDs. And from the complaints I've heard of the previous release of a couple of these on a blu-ray transfer, I would have to guess these are much better. There are no special features or anything, but still, it's 3 movies, for a good price, and I enjoyed them all. The stand out movie, and Hi-Def transfer, was definitely H20, but I think they all were done well enough.
Worth it says I.

[*Note:  I do not consider 'Halloween 3' part of the original Halloween series. Not only does is not involve Michael Myers, it is also a horrid abomination of a film, that should be viewed by no one. But that has little to do with this review.]",1312848000,,907,4.392857142857143
4069827,5,B0034TTKRS,"Okay so i was a little reluctant to buy this at first being I am in the US and this is a Canada release.

First off I want to point out that there are no special features. But the quality makes up for it!

All three movies are looking great on blu ray!!

Also this is a SINGLE DISC Blu Ray with all 3 movies on one disc and a pretty sweet Halloween Menu :)

I am 100% satisfied with this release. Now we will all await the release of Halloween 2-5 on Blu Ray!",1298419200,2,459,3.8
4069828,4,B0034TTKRS,"For fans of the Halloween series, this blu ray is worth the 35(ish) dollar upgrade. The movies are presented with better audio and much better picture quality. Also, The Curse and H2O are finally anamorphic. The image is more crisp, clear and colors and details are stronger and more vibrant and alive. All 3 films are on 1 single sided disc and although bare bones, the quality makes up for the lack of special features. This set is really pleasing because the quality upgrade and although these films don't totally wow in blu ray's big budget movie fashion, the films do look and sound much better, especially ""The Curse"" in my opinion because the colors just really radiate in that film. It's one of the only colorful Halloween sequels and it pays off on Blu. These films may never get released on Blu ray here (at least not for a few years) so this is definitely the best way to get them in high quality. It's region A (which plays in US and Canada). The only things that may have made this set even better would be if Alliance had put some kind of ""Halloween Documentary"" or some sort of special interview looking into Dimension and it's backstory on buying the 'Halloween' franchise and making these 3 films. It baffles me that ""The Curse"" has never had specail features, even on the DVD released in 2000, because I know there are like 30 deleted scenes from an alternate cut and there was a lot of behind the scenes interviews that I've seen on youtube. I really hope that one day these films get the total treatment they deserve here in the US with a special edition blu ray release.
However, I have nothing to complain about, this set is really a fair price and the quality is good. Definitely good enough to make you throw away the old DVDs of The Curse and H2O (minus Resurrection on DVD because the DVD is loaded with special features!)

Fans should buy this, it will hold them up until The US releases blu rays of these films with special features...Which may take...forever.",1291766400,2,1988,4.537604456824512
4069829,4,B0034TTKRS,"This is a canadian release that I bought on amazon.com. You can play it on your blu ray or ps3 player with no problem though as we are in the same region.  Canada has put out many titles like 'final destination 2' on blu ray that we just don't have in the states.  This one is the exact same as the dvd triple pack but the sound options are better with master audio on a few of them.  The prints as the other reviewer said look great on halloween 6 , and halloween resurrection' both of which are good halloween movies. Some fans hate 'resurrection' but I don't it's a decent flick in the series. 'h20' or halloween 7 doesn't have the best print , it's acceptable but it has artifacts little specks that pop up here and there.  They should have found a better print like the other two movies have in this set. Still it's watchable and not really shredded. There are no extras on this set because three movies are on it.  two are 1080i and one in 1080p although what is more important to me is that they get a better print for h20.
In fact the rest of the series needs to be put out on blu ray with as good of prints as 'halloween 6 and resurrection"" has. the first one is out but you could easily double up h2, h3,  and h4 and h5 in two blu rays. Hopefully someone will do that.  If you enjoy the halloween series then this is worth it. However they do need to put this out in the states as well.",1287446400,5,1396,4.072992700729927
4069830,4,B0034TTKRS,"Alliance has released a very good Blu-ray combo pack of the last 3 Halloween films in the original franchise. While the picture in Halloween 20 Years Later could use some improvement, Halloween 6 and Resurrection save the day with nice, crisp picture quality. The audio for all 3 films is the same as the DVD releases but they're in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound so it's not like we have bad audio options. Overall, this is a solid release considering these films have a long way to go before we see them on Blu-ray in the US. This release is worth every penny!",1287360000,6,564,4.485436893203883
4069831,5,B0034TTKRS,"So I have been wanting H20 to replace my dvd for some time because of the fact it wasn't anamorphic and i hated having to zoom my tv in to watch in in somewhat of a widescreen format, instead of a box in the middle of my screen.

So I ordered this after researching a little and reading that the U.S. Echo company version, the audio was only 2.0 for H20, which i wasn't a fan of.  So then I came across this version, read some reviews and took a chance.  I was not disappointed.  I don't care much for Halloween 6 so I am disregarding that from this review.

Halloween H20 - Video is correct aspect ratio that everyone has stated it was, nice clean picture, a few artifacts but very rarely, but that doesnt both me in older film, i kind of like it as long as it isn't horrible.  The audio is in nice and clear coming through all 5.1 channels.

Resurrection - Video is same as H20 Clean with few artifacts.  Audio is 5.1 clearing coming through all channels.

The downside to this was the price, and i didn't want Halloween 6, but overall very happy with this purchase.  Now to get Halloween and Halloween 2 on bluray, and i will be all set.",1398470400,,1140,4.1880733944954125
4069832,5,B0034TTKRS,Love the whole Halloween series. Got most of em on video tape. Now I want em on blu Ray. This collection is good for anyone that wants to save money instead buying them separately.,1396137600,,180,4.323529411764706
4069833,5,B0034TTKRS,This is the Halloween triple pack from alliance it has Halloween the curse of Michael Myers 1 78 1 Halloween h20 2 35 and Halloween resurrection in 2 35 1 with no special features beings it's 3 movies on one disc so get this blu ray instead of echo bridges.,1395619200,,257,4.16
4069834,5,B0034TTKRS,great for my blu ray collection i will be buying more and thank you for the great deal you rock,1379548800,,95,3.8
4069835,3,B0034TTKRS,"Three Halloween movies in the 10-film canon are included on one disc in this triple pack. We get The Curse of Michael Myers, H2O and Resurrection. I can't wholeheartedly recommend this triple pack because H2O is by far the best surrounded by two of Halloween's worst sequels. There are absolutely no extras included in this value pack. If you want an inexpensive way to complete your Halloween Blu-ray collection then consider purchasing this Canadian import (works great on US BD players and computer BD drives but untested on PS). The next decision is deciding if you want classic Halloween (I-V) or Rob Zombie's remakes (IX and X; released as Halloween (2007) and Halloween II (2009)). Check for the best versions you can buy because Halloween I, II and III have enjoyed great Blu-ray releases with plenty of extras. Forget about a complete Halloween Collection on DVD or Blu-ray (I've never seen more than 3 Halloween films packed together in the US). This Triple Pack remains the best version of these sequels in Blu-ray.

Skip that Echo Bridge version because this Alliance triple pack is considered superior in picture and audio quality. There's no extras for the Echo Bridge versions of Curse and H20 either. It does have some ported DVD extras for Resurrection but nothing remarkable.",1377561600,,1527,5.639130434782609
4069836,5,B0034TTKRS,"Even though I owned Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers, Halloween: H20 And Halloween: Resurrection on Blu-ray release by  Echo Bridge, I still prefer this Version because Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers looks much better than the Echo Bridge version and it's got a better sound quality. What I really like about this this version of This Halloween Triple Pack is that Halloween: H20 its in it's original Aspect ratio: 2:35:1 although the film has a little grain, but that doesn't bother me that much, where as Echo Bridge cut the film to fit on your screen 1:78:1. Don't really care for Halloween: Resurrection never watch it they should've stopped in Halloween: H20! I would Highly Recommend if your a Halloween Fan!",1367798400,2,726,4.902439024390244
4069837,5,B0034TTKRS,"It was great. I have been a fan of all the Halloween films since I was a kid. I'm glad that they released a ""triple feature"" for these. When sequels are released just like this it saves room on my shelf for more movies. That's why I like these type of releases.",1361750400,,261,4.038461538461538
4069838,5,B0034TTKRS,"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers - Of the three films, I enjoyed this transfer the most. There is
background grain/noise, but it's not too distracting as the movie gets going. It is to be expected with a
catalogue release like this, and at the very least shows there is no DNR on this release. Blacks are
dark, and the colors stand out. The audio in this release is very strong, and definitely sticks out better
than it does on Echo Bridge's region-free release.
Video - 4/5
Audio - 4.5/5

Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later - Unfortunately, H20 suffers the most of the three films on this
release. The opening moments are very grainy, but it does get better when the movie gets going. It
seems like it might have just been some print damage that affected the video on this one, but it still
looks far better than it ever did on DVD. As has been said before, this release contains the best audio
of the H20 releases. Dialogue is crisp and clear, and the score sets the mood easily.
Video - 3.5/5
Audio - 5/5

Halloween Resurrection - As the only film with the 1080p transfer, it was obvious that Resurrection's
transfer would be the best (though I do personally feel like Curse came across the best). The audio is
clear and the video looks great, even if the film itself is pretty bad.
Video - 4/5
Audio - 4/5

Unfortunately, this release is without English subtitles and bonus features, but I still recommend it for
those of us who can't play the Region B releases of Curse and H20, as the audio and video are both
superior to the releases that Echo Bridge gave us.

4069839,1,B0034TTKRS,"First off, I love the Halloween series and this review is based on this release. Now if you think this release will feature H20 in its OAR of 2.35:1 then you're wrong! This release will still present the film in an open-matte presentation of 1.78:1 and not only that but Resurrection is presented in 1.78:1 too (either cropped or open-matted from its OAR of 2.35:1)! Now you're probably asking yourself ""How does he know?"" I'll tell you how I know; this release was released early at Best Buy stores and a Blu-ray.com forum member got the release and told the info to confirm. I was hoping Echo Bridge would present this release as a 2-disc set with Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers and H20 on the first disc (with H20 in its OAR of 2.35:1) and Resurrection on the second disc with extras (basically a repackage of the April 2012 release) but sadly, this is not the case. My advice; avoid this release and buy the single disc releases of Curse and Resurrection from Echo Bridge and the Canadian Triple Pack from Alliance just to get H20 in its proper OAR.",1348099200,27,1060,4.526041666666667
4069840,4,B0034TTKRS,"Canada is our neighbor to the north and it's only fitting that their production company releasing this triple pack set is called Alliance. Form your Alliance today with the only decent release of 'Halloween' 6-8. I don't know what else to say, really. 'H20' is in its correct Aspect Ratio and looks great and actually feels like 'H20' again. 'Curse' is very brutal and intense in its approach and tries its best to explain Michael and his madness which takes all the mystery out of the character but overall it's an entertaining movie. 'H20' is the centerpiece and in my opinion, the sole reason to buy this set. 'Resurrection' is hated by most and I understand why. But even the worst 'Halloween' film is better than most slashers. I won't give it away but I will say that it gets a lot of undeserved hate. I think the movie is ahead of its time with the live-internet-show direction. Michael's ""resurrection"" could've been explained much better but after the ending of 'H20' it's kind of hard for him to come back without it being completely ridiculous. The explanation could've been 10 times worse. I think the major problem for most fans is Busta Rhymes and the end of a beloved character at the beginning.

If you're a big fan of the 'Halloween' series or just a casual fan who doesn't want to go through all the trouble of buying each disc individually then this is the one for you to complete your collection. All 3 are of good picture quality and with an HD 5.0 audio track. Skip the Echo Bridge releases. Even the menu is far better and feels like an extra even though it isn't. There's no extras for the Echo Bridge versions of 'Curse' and 'H20' anyway and the extras on 'Resurrection' are ported from the DVD so you're not missing much. No loss. Do yourself a favor and get this release. You won't be sorry you did!",1338422400,6,1826,4.533333333333333
