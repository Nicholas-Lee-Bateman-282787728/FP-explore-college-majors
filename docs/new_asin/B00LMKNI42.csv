8666673,5,B00LMKNI42,"It was very educational. Interesting to see how far some women are going to get more attention from men. Those kardashians and Nikki Minaj have really started some mess and the sad thing about it is that the women that get it look just as fake as they do. Fake butts don't sit up right and they just don't look good ESPECIALLY in pants. Pants and tights show all the definition, doesn't hide anything. They ain't foolin anybody.",1410480000,,428,4.5
8666674,3,B00LMKNI42,The duration of the film did not warrant a charge of $3.99,1410307200,,58,3.9166666666666665
8666675,3,B00LMKNI42,"I have to agree with the other reviewers and say I wish this was a little bit longer. Would have been nice if this documentary had more information on the risks, aftermath/results, etc of the black market injections (Vanity Wonder would have been a great addition to cover for this subject). Also would have liked for the documentary to highlight what role and impact the strip club culture has on the ""toosh"" phenomenon. Not overwhelming in information, as a lot of this information is stuff many people may already know by now. Non the less, this was an okay viewing worth watching at least once.",1409356800,2,598,4.704761904761905
8666676,2,B00LMKNI42,"I've seen better documentaries on  the Discovery Health Channel with Dr. Jan, the surgeon who performed a Lipo procedure on Kanye West's mom. Prior to Mrs. West's unfortunate death, Dr. Jan gave u the ins and outs of cosmetic surgery and the visual of several procedures for said procedure. This piece was thrown together to suck money out of the curios person like me on coverage a 10 year old could have filmed on their cell phone. All the info.in this so-called documentary were actually taken from news clips and YouTube! Don't waste your money! Don't buy or rent!",1408406400,3,568,4.737373737373737
8666677,2,B00LMKNI42,"I thought this might tell me something I didn't know.  But,  the video is very superficial and disappointing.",1408233600,,109,5.0
8666678,5,B00LMKNI42,"Bottoms Up was very interesting and informative. The documentary gave me incite on what's actually going on because I was puzzled. I was seeing celebrities looking one way and then seeing them a few months later or on the next season of a show looking another way and not really knowing what happened but knowing something happened. It has become a trend now and not just with celebrities but also amongst every day women. Personally, I don't understand why sisters who have assets want to go altering their bodies in such a way. To each their own, but the documentary just made me love myself even more just the way I am. I'm going to keep what I have and work with what I got. I'm very blessed and thankful for who I am.",1406505600,2,722,4.395522388059701
8666679,3,B00LMKNI42,"interesting documentary, wish it was longer and had more information and true stories of both sides of how it can go bad and good. Its crazy what people are willing to do for attention, not all attention is good and i for one hate being objectified. But hey to each her own.",1405814400,,274,4.288461538461538
8666680,3,B00LMKNI42,"Wish it would have been longer, but a great doc none the less. The directors did a great job tracing how black america's appreciation of a curvy body has turned  into a global fixation. Some of the commentators can be a little annoying at times and that can kind of distract from  the doc.",1405728000,3,289,4.333333333333333
