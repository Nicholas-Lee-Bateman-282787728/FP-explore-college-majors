8512638,4,B0079C8TPU,"We selected this one because it appeared to be a legitimate ""chick flick"" and we were right. We watched the entire movie though because it was a touching and compelling romance. The acting, the scenery, and the story are all well done and carry the viewer along on a very romantic ride. It's easy to create a bond with the characters and sympathize with them and their respective plights.

The story is not a new departure from the romantic story line and there are really no surprises but it's a warm familiar journey with an ending that should please most viewers. There are some scenes which would not be suitable for young children but they are handled with restraint.

If you enjoy a romantic journey you'll enjoy this one too.",1357257600,4,732,4.623076923076923
