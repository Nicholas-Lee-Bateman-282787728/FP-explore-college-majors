7796169,2,156127755X,"This video was actually filmed in 1985. The film focuses only on the unpleasant side of Route 66. The video overwhelmingly focuses on Christian fundamentalists ""healing"" each other and shrieking on the radio. The people we meet on the route are mostly religious extremists, overweight barflys, tramps, alcoholics and other assorted losers. I felt sympathy for some of these people like an unemployed, bearded man and his wife, but the video takes a patronizing view of these people. The leftist bias of the European filmmakers clearly comes through in a scene showing cattle being killed in a slaughterhouse intercut with  nuclear test warnings. In Texas the filmmakers focus on a man who wants Texas to seceed from the U.S.; in New Mexico on an alcoholic Indian; in Arizona on a damaged Vietnam veteran. Chicago is shown only as a collection of hovels. Los Angeles is skid row with alcoholics and drug addicts passed out in the gutter. Nothing more. All these things exist but the video is all one sided and negative. The filmmakers apparantly were more interested in reenforcing European prejudices about America than giving us a true portrait of Route 66.",1082073600,,1158,5.0
7796170,5,156127755X,"If you love ""The Mother Road"", this is a must-have video! I have traveled and explored Route 66 and its history, but this video offers more insight into Route 66 than I have ever seen anywhere else. Director Mike Okado did an incredible job capturing the spirit of Arizona stretch of Route 66, and some footages are phenomenal. I highly recommend this video to anyone; it is as good as traveling on Route 66! This video is a treasure in my video collection. A+++++++",1005264000,6,466,4.559523809523809
7796171,1,156127755X,"If you're interested in the Mother Road and want a tape to inform and let you know how the road and people are today, you do NOT want this tape.
Filmed in the mid 80s, this tape is NOT an accurate depiction of  the road as it is today.
As the road is always changing, restaurants and  motels opening and closing, buildings being torn down, etc. - I found this  tape useful in providing a view of 66's roadside as it was in the 80s, and  not much else.",952646400,,451,4.033707865168539
7796172,4,156127755X,"Most Route 66 videos (and goodness knows, I own most of them) focus on a nostalgic history of the road and an upbeat look at the recent resurgence in interest in what has become an American icon. And that's great; for  myself, too young to have driven the road in its most vital days, Route 66  is now something of a 2,400-mile amusement park for adults, who want to get  out on the open road and really see the United States.

This isn't one of  those videos, but there are a couple of things you have to consider when  assessing it:

1) Although released in 1997 by White Star video, this  documentary was actually made in the mid- to late-'80s. This was shortly  after the last of the route was bypassed and before the renewed interest in  the route heated up, with the publishing of Michael Wallis' ""Route 66:  The Mother Road,"" in 1990. It was a time when there was little  nostalgic feeling and a lot of fear that these small towns would dry up and  blow away.

2) Central Independent Television, which produced the  documentary, is a British production company. These were people coming to a  foreign land, theoretically without any preconceived notions, and were just  going to present what they came across. Those who don't like this video  would likely say that the United States was being shown in a bad light. You  can tell that the director and editor are drawn to the surprising or odd,  and there's nothing scientific or representative about how they chose their  interview subjects. And yet, they allow to seep through the spirit of  Middle America to tough it out through the bad times.

This really isn't  as much about Route 66 as it is about America in the mid-'80s, and in that  sense, it's better sociology than any other Route 66 video. There is no  narrator; everything is authentic snippets from an AM car radio (local  news, religious programming, Paul Harvey), or interviews with individuals,  or music either discovered live on the road or matching the region being  traveled. You may cringe at some of the things being said, but no one can  accuse the producers of sugar-coating their trip from Chicago to Los  Angeles.

On the other hand, if you're looking for a more nostalgic look,  try Pacific Communications' ""Route 66, An American Odyssey.""",952387200,4,2275,4.678481012658228
