8507202,4,B006ZQWMO0,"Whew!  My brain is tired after a viewing.  This is definitely advanced level, and involves several moves which are fancier and longer variations on moves taught in Volumes 1, 4, and 7.  Many of the moves are for duets or trios of dancers, and are flashy, beautiful show-stoppers.  I look forward to learning and performing them, but it'll take a lot of practice!  I wish this 2 DVD set used the little box highlighting the foot movements that was on a previous DVD - that was very helpful.",1359158400,9,489,4.511363636363637
