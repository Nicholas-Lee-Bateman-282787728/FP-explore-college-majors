3521129,5,B001CO42LQ,"I recently received the first season of The Donna Reed Show and am extremely pleased after watching about six episodes.  These days, pre-ordering TV series on DVD can be quite an iffy proposition what with big corporations such as Paramount mutilating television shows such as The Fugitive and My Three Sons by re-scoring them and then milking their customers by charging full price for half seasons.  No such problems  as those with this first season set of Donna Reed because as far as I can tell, the music appears to be intact.

The picture quality is very very good despite some compression.  There are some artifacts in the opening of the first episode and over the end credits that don't amount to anything much to worry about.  The music appears to be entirely intact as well so that's a major plus.  Plus part of the proceeds go to the Donna Reed Foundation for the Performing Arts so besides being able to enjoy a great classic series intact and at a more than reasonable price, you can feel good about having bought it as well.

Really, one has to wonder why some companies can manage to get it so right and the big companies like Paramount get it so wrong as they continually price gouge and take consumers for granted.  I eagerly await the release of Season Two of The Donna Reed Show.",1225411200,6,1298,4.560344827586207

While mostly a family sitcom, with Donna Reed having so much influence on the show, many subjects not dared touched by others were sensitively portrayed.

3521134,5,B001CO42LQ,"With the blessings of her children and production by Arts Alliance America, ""The Donna Reed Show"" has finally made its way to DVD!

As with Oscar winner Walter Brennen in 'The Real McCoys', Academy award winner Donna Reed moves to the the small screen as homemaker Donna Stone accompanied by Carl Betz (future Emmy winner) as her pediatrician husband, Dr. Alex Stone. With Shelley Fabares and Paul Peterson as their children Mary and Jeff (and soon to be teen idols), the 'The Donna Reed Show' depicts a late 1950's sitcom family resulting in mostly comedic outcomes while including many tender family moments representing poignant & groundbreaking social issues of the time.

Arts Alliance America brings us this delightful series with the complete Season One (no half season release here) with a whopping 37 episodes in pristine Black & White. Although 50 years since its debut, the 'The Donna Reed Show' will delight viewers old and new with it's contemporary family friendly moral themes.

Even after 50 years this is true quality family programming at its best!

UPDATE: 11.02.08

I just finished watching Disc #1; it just took me straight back to 1958 (yes I was a little guy back then but do remember the show in its first run).  I can't think of a finer TV show for the whole family, maybe 'The Real McCoys', that truly puts forth family values.

3521135,5,B001CO42LQ,"I have waited what seems like an eternity (Actually it's been 50 years since the show debuted) for The Donna Reed Show to finally be on dvd. I am just so happy to be able to view this fantastic show again whenever I want!

The Donna Reed Show debuted on ABC, on September 24,1958 and ran until 1966, for eight seasons. It's first sponsors were the Campbell Soup Co. and the Johnson and Johnson Company. It starred the Stone Family, Donna Stone (Donna Reed) the most wonderful mother you could ever want, Dr. Alex Stone (Carl Betz) her pediatrician doctor husband, Mary Stone (Shelley Fabares)(1958-1963) Donna's 14 year old daughter, Jeff Stone (Paul Petersen) Donna's 11 year old son, and a later on adopted 9 year old daughter Trisha Stone (Patty Petersen, Paul Petersen's real life sister)(1963-1966). Trisha came into the show after Mary (Fabares) went away to college, in reality, Fabares left the show to pursue her acting and singing career. The other regulars in the show were Donna's next door neighbor and best friend, Midge Kelsey (Ann McCrea)(1963-1966) and her husband Dr. Dave Kelsey (Bob Crane)(1963-1965, Bob left the show to star in Hogan's Heroes). Jimmy Hawkins played George Haskell in 1959, then became Scotty Simpson from 1960 to 1965. Scotty was Mary's boyfriend. Darryl Richard (Smitty 1962-1966) and Janet Landgard (Karen Holmby 1964-1965)were also regular friends on the show.

The Guest stars were numerous on the show as well, including some of the better known: Jamie Farr, Buster Keaton, Ted Knight, Jack Albertson, John Astin, Harvey Korman, Dabney Coleman, Kim Darby, James Darren, Don Drysdale, Kelly Drysdale, Ginger Drysdale, Gale Gordon, Swoosie Kurtz, Johnny Crawford (the Rifleman's son), Paul Winchell, George Sidney, Margaret Dumont, singer Tony Martin, Cloris Leachman, Willie Mays, Leo Durocher, Ellen Corby, Arte Johnson, Marlo Thomas, Jay North (Dennis the Menace), Marion Ross (Happy Days Mom), Mary Wickes, George Hamilton, DeForrest Kelly, Lassie, Esther Williams and on the last show in 1966, singer Lesley Gore.

This show always had such a real ""loving home"" and ""loving mom"" type atmosphere with the performance that Donna Reed gave every week. Playing Donna Stone, she was always there for her children, with love, advice and always caring about any needs they had at the moment. Donna's pediatrician husband Dr. Alex Stone also had his office in the front of their home, making it such a convenience for Donna to help out with his practice by working as his nurse when he needed her help. Many doctor's had their offices in their homes in the 1950's, it was very common. The doctors also made house calls, like Alex and spent many hours in the hospitals as well. This aspect of the show is great for anyone who remembers these times, and how differently we lived back then, compared to now.

Paul Petersen had already been a child star before his debut on the Donna Reed Show as Donna's son Jeff, as he was briefly, a Mouseketeer on The Mickey Mouse Club Show. After two weeks as a Mouseketeer, Paul (real name William Paul Petersen) was fired for disorderly conduct. Paul said at the time he was 10 years old as a  Mouseketeer, and that "" I didn't know that a kid actor shouldn't act like a kid."" On The Donna Reed Show in 1963, Paul sang a song called ""My Dad"", which went on to be a hit for Colpix Records.

Shelley Fabares (Mary Stone, Donna's daughter) went off to college on the show in 1962. During her college year on the show, she sang a song called ""Johnny Angel"". The song became an instant hit record, selling over a million copies and going Gold. Shelley recorded 5 albums after this hit from 1962 to 1964. Of course, Shelley (real name Michelle Marie Fabares, she is the niece of actress Nanette Fabray) left the show after having this gold record, and pursued her acting and singing career, which led to her sucessful movies and television shows for many decades. Following The Donna Reed Show, Shelley then became famous for co-starring in the Elvis Presley movies, ""Spinout"", ""Girl Happy"" and ""Clambake"". Besides her parts in many movies, Shelley also starred in numerous television shows, such as Mork and Mindy, Murder She Wrote, Love American Style, The Twilight Zone and many more. Shelley was last known for her television show ""Coach"". In October 2000, Shelley received a liver transplant due to an auto-immune disorder.

It will really be so wonderful to see all these truly heartwarming, great shows again. These shows really give you a great view of life in the late 50's and early 60's with one of America's Best T.V. Moms ever!",1217030400,47,4608,4.869897959183674
3521136,5,B001CO42LQ,"It's time to celebrate, the First Season of the ground-breaking and truly iconic classic The Donna Reed Show is coming to DVD after years of fan pleadings - along with a promise to release Season 2 next year!

Joe Amodei, President of Arts Alliance America and Mary Owen (the daughter of Donna Reed) made the happy announcement together. The release will celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the show's debut episode. ABC first aired The Donna Reed Show on Wednesday, Sept. 24, 1958 at 9:00 p.m.

The series took place in the fictional town of Hilldale. It centered around the dreams, ambitions, and frustrations of the Stone family: Alex, a pediatrician; his wife, Donna; and their children, Mary, Jeff, and Trisha (unofficially adopted in later episodes).

It was the beginning of a long relationship with America as viewers tuned in weekly to visit the Stone family for eight years, representing 274 episodes. The series' final episode aired March 19, 1966.

Ms. Reed was Emmy nominated four times for her role on the show, and in 1963 won a Golden Globe as Best Female TV Star. She also won the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role in 1953 for her performance in ""From Here To Eternity,"" but is probably best known for her role as Jimmy Stewart's wife, Mary Bailey, in the Christmas masterpiece, ""It's a Wonderful Life.""

The series was one of several family-based shows that literally helped shaped the landscape of reality in America - rather than the other way 'round. Other Classic iconic family shows of the era included Father Knows Best, Leave It to Beaver, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, The Patty Duke Show and My Three Sons.

The adventures of the Stone family were similar to what those other TV families had to contend with - measles, girlfriends and boyfriends, school problems, little white lies, and so on, compounded by the fact that Dr. Alex was always running off at odd hours to attend his patients. Like those other shows, it had a wholesome quality that endeared it to audiences.

But, the ground-breaking difference between this show and all of the others was its focus: In this series, it was the Mom who knew best. This was the first show of its kind where the Mom was the lead character. And what a Mom! In my opinion, Ms. Reed was - and remains - in a class by herself.

When this show originally aired, Ms. Reed became an influential role model to women - as mother, wife and professional.

Despite all of these shows utter lack of racial and religious diversity and conservative depiction of conformity at all costs, I still love them all. I'm a liberal feminist so it makes absolutely NO sense, but there it is. My favorite is Father Knows Best, but this show comes in a very close second because of its star.

Ms. Reed was effervescent without being mechanical. She was sweet, funny and forgiving - everything a child could ever want in a Mom. In addition, her relationship with her ""husband,"" played by the brilliant Carl Betz, had just a hint of real sexuality that was blatantly missing in the other shows.

In addition to Mr. Betz (who later starred in the Classic TV courtroom drama Judd for the Defense,) the cast included Shelley Fabares and Paul Peterson, as the Stone's children, Mary and Jeff. The Donna Reed Show remained on the air so long that the original children grew up. Mary left for college in 1962 and Jeff did the same two seasons later. An 8-year-old orphan named Trisha was adopted by the Stones joined the cast in January of 1963 to maintain the ""family"" appeal of the series. Patty Peterson, who played, Trisha was Paul Peterson's (Jeff Stone) real-life sister.

Close friends of the Stones were Midge Kelsey, played by Ann McCrea, and her husband, Dr. David Kelsey, played by Bob Crane (long before the Classic TV comedy Hogan's Heroes.) Children pals were Smitty, played by Darryl Richard and Herbie Bailey, played by Tommy Ivo.

The Donna Reed Show had numerous special guests stars including Buster Keaton, who appeared twice on the program, Marlo Thomas, Esther Williams, and baseball greats Don Drysdale and Willie Mays who appeared on the show as themselves.

For 10 years syndicated re-runs of The Donna Reed Show entertained new generations of young people on Nick at Nite. In a growing resurgence of nostalgia and a salute to Mothe;'s Day, the cable television network, Nickelodeon, aired a week long ""Seven Day Donna-Thon"" of episodes in 1990.

Ms. Reed's daughter, Mary Owen, said, ""My Mother always said that she and my Father (Tony Owen was the Producer and principal architect of The Donna Reed Show) had climbed a mountain together making this show. For a whole generation of Baby Boomers, the Stone's were their second family. Today, when Boomers are starting to retire, it's time again to sit and watch The Donna Reed Show, this time with their grand kids and let them be amazed at who established and sowed the seeds of the American family. In the 1960's, before we lived with computers and cable TV with over 200 channels of mostly junk, the Stone family showed what love, respect and support for one another looked like.""

In the debut episode, ""Weekend Trip,"" audiences were introduced to the Stone family and got a glimpse of their sometimes chaotic day-to-day life flavored by the loving influence of Donna Stone who dispenses advice, discipline, humor and wisdom to her family. When series begins, Donna and Alex Stone had been married for 15 years.

All of the First Season episodes are included in this boxed set and are: 1. Weekend Trip (9/24/1958); 2. Pardon My GLoves (10/1/1958); 3. The Hike (10/8/1958); 4. Male Ego (10/15/1958) 5.

The only negative thing I can say is the phone at the beginning of each show. After watching the entire season in one sitting I hear the phonel in my sleep.  LOL.. I really like the Amazon unbox feature.  Too bad more shows are not available on it. Great show. Many lessons taught in a loving, humorous sensitive way.",1353715200,,600,4.191304347826087

I bought this show as it always got better ratings than LITB. What a disappointment! The scripts are razor thin, the humor is non-existent, the whole series reeks of the kind of blandness that fifties sit-coms are mocked for. Poorly written by hacks, this one is moldy and has aged very poorly. Carl Betz is handsome but wooden. Donna Reed is pretty but totally unconvincing. The kids are self-consciously annoying actors with Paul Petersen's character hinting at the aggravatingly precocious child actors to come later on in TV land. Skip this one.",1334534400,2,689,5.0

3521210,3,B001CO42LQ,"The Donna Reed Show ran for eight seasons between the years 1958-1966. During that time, women were expected to be good little homemakers who were only supposed to find fulfillment in their household chores and the rearing of their children. In 2011, that notion is considered preposterous. While this show is charming and enduring in its depiction of a family in small town middle America, the way it depicts how women should give up EVERYTHING for their children and husband in order to have the perfect home is small-minded. The fact that there were many other shows like this projecting the idea that women should not have careers and instead only be content with their homes is frightening. Again, this show can be enjoyable, but it's important not to lose sight of the fact that how it's depicting Mrs. Stone is merely an idealized version of what men wanted all their wives to be like during this era and because of this, women internalized this desire of their husband's to be just like Donna in order to meet the expectations for what men considered to be the perfect wife, and attempted to do everything they could in order to live up to the standards of a television character. Thank goodness women have gone forwards in their thinking since the initial airing of the show in 1958. Television shows like The Donna Reed Show should be viewed with a cautionary tale that while a husband's manipulation of his wife was more acceptable during the 1950's, that doesn't mean that that should still be true in the present. If anything, it's quite the opposite.",1302825600,,1564,4.7536764705882355
3521211,5,B001CO42LQ,"The Incredible First Season of ""The Donna Reed Show"" is HERE!!! So Call your Relatives and Call your Neighbors because this particular sitcom which is an 'Iconic Family Series' is without a doubt, a much ""Treasured Gift"" for all!

This truly masterful ""Donna Reed Show"" series is all about the trials and tribulations of The Stone Family. This family sitcom can appear at times like a continued documentary on a real life family. I say this, because the cast members seem to be so very comfortable with each other that they truly appear to be actually related to one another! This is what drew the audiences to this Classic TV Sitcom in the first place, when it had first aired in the late 1950's. And with it's greatly selected Cast, plus this show's Fantastic Story Lines in which Actress Donna Reed herself had much influence over, is indeed what actually propelled this series with its Loyal Audiences for Eight Wonderful Seasons, with a vast number of episodes, 275 to be exact!!!

""The Donna Reed Show"" which had originally aired on The ABC Television Network, had it's first premiere episode airing on September 24, 1958 at 9 PM on a Wednesday Night. And after the completion of this Family Sitcom's First Season, this series did remain on the ABC Television Network for 'Seven' more Successful Seasons!!

The cast includes in the starring role, the forever gorgeous & charming Donna Reed! And of course, this Academy Award Winning Actress was a 'Big Plus' in attracting audiences to this show. As was her continuing ability to play in a very convincing manner, her role of the Donna Stone Character, who is a Very Capable, Successful Wife, and Mother of two. Seasoned Actress Donna Reed truly makes this Donna Stone Character her very own! And as a direct result of this, her 'Maternal Role' in this series shines very brightly indeed which had gained her many new ardent fans over the years of this show's run!

Carl Betz plays the character of Dr. Alex Stone, a very pleasant looking husband and 'Father Figure' who is also a charmer. And in this series, he has a most distinguished career as a highly dedicated doctor in the field of Pediatrics. This Dr. Stone Character is portrayed excellently & quite convincingly by the very Accomplished Actor Carl Betz! Also, I might add here as a side note, that when Actor Carl Betz's is performing with his Fellow Cast Members on ""The Donna Reed Show,"" his precise timing and comical effectiveness, are always consistently Brilliant!!!! A trait of a truly Fine Actor!

Shelley Fabares plays the role of the Character Mary Stone, a very fresh faced, quite attractive, and truly likable Teenage Girl, who is coming of age into her young womanhood with wonderful results! The naturally Talented Actress Shelley Fabares is 'Great' in this role, and gives a highly admirable 'Charismatic Performance' in portraying her Mary Stone Character! I would also like to say that throughout this ""Donna Reed Show"" series, (and really heating up during the Fourth Season) Mary Stone's sarcastic remarks towards her brother Jeff, are truly hilarious because they seem so very real!!! Especially after Mary spews forth with her not so flattering remarks, and then these very disgusted and disdainful expressions take over her face, which are all aimed so mightily towards her brother Jeff!! It is Just Priceless!!! Actress Shelley Fabares has this Brother Sister Act down to a Complete Science!

Paul Petersen plays the role of the very Effervescent Mr. Personality Plus, and just Down Right FRESH Jeff Stone Character, and is also the youngest family member of the household. This cute Jeff Stone Character adds a lot of spice and life to this show! He is a very energetic & animated character that on occasion can appear somewhat bratty, but still lovable to the point of being very outrageous from time to time with his smart aleck remarks, that are actually Quite Funny!!! The very Talented Actor Paul Petersen gives the audience a first rate performance, and does an amazingly 'Superb Job' in his portrayal of the Jeff Stone Character!

Every episode of ""The Donna Reed Show"" is like watching a short Classic Movie since every episode is a Masterpiece in itself! So if you're expecting any comparisons of this show to match the Television Shows of Today, FORGET IT!!!!!!! ""The Donna Reed Show"" was done very professionally with a top grade quality that far outshines the poorly written, produced, and directed TV shows of this present day. Even the Camera Work is much more interesting to observe in this Very Classic Sitcom than it is on today's TV sitcoms. When watching any episode from this Fantastic Family Series, you will know from the very first scene that you're in good hands, which guarantees that the viewer will be taken on a mesmerized journey of pure joy and entertainment!!!

This Wonderful First Season of ""The Donna Reed Show"" remains incredibly strong even today, with its Great Cast, and Well Written Story Episodes! And it's very lovely and talented star ""Donna Reed"" with her unique screen presence, adds sheer magic to this extremely Well Crafted TV Series!

So don't you dare miss out on any of these episodes from this very Iconic TV Show's 'Fun Filled First Season' which is a masterful and cleverly put together TV Series that is truly a Classic Sitcom!

Note: There are a Whopping 37 Episodes from The Donna Reed Show's 'Number One Season.' All of the episodes are complete and uncut as they were originally broadcast during this 1958/1959 Season. It is such a 'Treat' to view these ""Classic Episodes"" from this bygone era of Great Television!!!! :)",1290729600,6,5618,4.885624344176286

Donna Reed, Season 1, brought back many memories. I would have loved living in that era, especially if life was similar to the Stones. (Not getting stoned, like most of today's programs.) Nice but modest home, happy, intelligent children, food on the table, and a mother who'd listen and help resolve our problems.

For those who enjoy watching Good-Old TV shows, I recommend Donna Reed, Season 1.

This is really a great old TV show that represents what all families should aspire to be like as the good Doctor Stone , played wonderfully by the late Carl Betz, and his wife Donna Stone, set up a family practice in the mythical town of Hilldale. The kids, Jeff and Mary,  are played by the talented Paul Petersen and the always cute Shelly Fabares.

The comedy here is somewhat mild but always entertaining as Donna in each show manages to dole out motherly advice to the children to keep them out of trouble, run the household  expertly and be the perfect but strong wife for Alex.

They definitely don't make family shows like this anymore and its such a horrible shame as families today gathering together in front of the TV are bombarded with immorality and profanity.

In one episode on the first disc, She goes behind her husband's back, cons his friend into pleading guilty to an unjust traffic citation instead of fighting it, just so the family can go camping.  In the end, she gets her way, and her husband thanks her for watching out for him and gives her a kiss.  Excuse me??  My husband would be livid, and rightly so!  She is always there, ready to conquer any situation and set everything to right, no matter the cost as she puts on a smile and ever so sweetly puts the man in his place.

This is one of the best purchases I have made in months- I have so enjoyed watching this wonderful show again. The episodes are funny and touching, but without being corny...okay... maybe kids today will think the show is a bit corny, but our generation certainly won't as that was our life!
The quality of the DVD's is perfect and at least we get the entire season in one set, not like other TV shows that are split up with ""season one-volume 1""...nothing like that with Donna, you get all 37 episodes in the one set!

The Donna Reed Show!

I just adore Donna Reed and so I was so very sad when they stopped playing the show! I was even one of those fans who petitioned on the Nick at Nite site to bring it back.

About an hour ago I decided to search Donna Reed on YouTube to see what I would find!

Well, to my surprise at the end of one of the clips was a screen that said: ""The complete first season out on DVD October 28, 2008!""

WHAT!!!

So, I got my butt right over to Amazon and there it was, in stock and on sale waiting for me!!!

I ran downstairs (yelling in excitement as if I was a little kid on Christmas day) to go tell my husband what I just found (I told him a long time ago about how I was so sad that they didn't play her show anymore and he remembered when I started telling him about it all!) So, he just ordered it for me and got the 1 day shipping so I can have it as a my stocking gift!!!

I have to agree with some of the comments though, the Nick at Nite airings definitely had better quality prints than the DVD's. I find them to very dark at times, but definitely viewable - if you like the show you certainly won't be disappointed.  Just being nit- picky for some reason the few Arts Alliance America DVDs that I own (Banacek being another one) use rather abrupt fade ins and outs that seem rather quick, not the way I prefer them - I like smooth transitions. But, like I said that is just a preference - in no way does it interfere with my enjoyment of the content of the show. At least Donna Reed did not get into the hands of the butchers and slaughterers over at Paramount/CBS DVD - (not that it would have - it was Screen Gems and would have been released by Sony)  but I like to stick it to them any chance I can for DESTROYING the best classic TV shows... Anyway ...Looking forward to getting Season 2!",1227398400,9,1157,4.230769230769231
3521242,5,B001CO42LQ,"I have always loved The Donna Reed Show and was thrilled when it finally came out on DVD.  The show was so well made and the actors were great.  Okay, some of the plotlines were a little dated or hokey, but Donna Reed is so likeable and charming that it doesn't really matter.  It's a pure joy to watch and relive the era and the show.  I hope they get the rest of the seasons out soon.  With all the filth that is on TV these days, it's nice to just pop in ""Donna Reed"" and go back to a time when things were a whole lot kinder and gentler.",1227052800,2,541,3.881818181818182
3521243,5,B001CO42LQ,"It is hard to believe the shows on this DVD set are 50 years old. The quality, both audio and visual are excellent. The stories are excellent. It is great this fine show has been finally released. Hope for season 2 soon.",1226707200,2,220,4.261904761904762
3521244,4,B001CO42LQ,"I, like millions of others, remember seeing ""The Donna Reed Show"" on Nick-At-Nite in the late 80s through the early 90s. I had never seen the show before Nick aired it and I fell in love with it and the Stone family and have anxiously awaited a release of the series to DVD. I was thrilled to find out that we'd be getting a full season (37 episodes!) release this fall. After major disappointments this year with a lousy ""My Three Sons"" half-season set with altered music and a ""Father Knows Best"" release containing incomplete and inferior quality prints I didn't know what to expect of ""The Donna Reed Show."" So, does the DVD release live up to my hopes? I would have to say it falls a little short of my expectations. I'll break it down below.

THE QUALITY OF THE SHOWS:
I have to be honest here (and Donna fans don't get mad!) the episodes don't look as good on the DVDs as I remember them from Nick-At-Nite. I even got out a few VHS episodes I had taped off Nick to compare. I remember the shows on Nick as being cleaner and sharper. The prints on the DVDs seem a bit fuzzy to me.

I don't know the reason why these episodes aren't as crisp as Nick's except that this DVD release has nothing to do with Columbia/Sony (which was originally Screen Gems back in the day). Sony syndicated the show to Nick and, obviously, supplied the tapes they aired. This DVD has no mention of Sony/Columbia/Screen Gems, etc. so this leads me to believe they no longer have any hold on the series. I'd be curious to know who has the master negatives to these shows and if they may still reside in some Sony film vault.

This whole Screen Gems thing leads me to another complaint. I realize this next thing is very nit-picky but I miss the old Screen Gems ID at the very end of each episode. The shows on these DVDs end very abruptly after the Todon logo appears and the Screen Gems ID has been cut. Yes, I know this is minor but I still miss it.

THE PACKAGING:
This is another area of complaint for me. Okay, I know this is purely subjective but I found the graphic design on this set to be a little amateurish compared to many other classic TV series sets. Even Shout Factory's ""Father Knows Best"" release with it's crappy quality prints had slick, high quality, graphic design. I just wanted more for Donna Reed.

WRAP-UP:
Would I recommend this set for purchase? Even with all my complaints (some admittedly nit-picky) I would definitely suggest this DVD set of ""The Donna Reed Show"" complete first season. You get all 37 uncut episodes (at least I think as they all run about 25 mins) for a very affordable price. Since this series may never be released on DVD again I would highly recommend getting it while you can.",1226102400,15,2710,4.390438247011952
3521245,5,B001CO42LQ,How wonderful is this show!! I never thought I would see the day that it would be released on dvd but here it is in pristine condition. Every episode is a joy to watch as well as being just plain fun. This is what TV was meant to be in my opinion. Just good clean family fun. And I hear they are going to release season 2 real soon. I can't wait to get my copy. I only hope they release the entire series. I highly recommend this set to anyone interested in classic TV.,1226102400,2,469,3.9473684210526314

8290705,5,B001CO42LQ,"I purchased this because I love the Donna Reed show... I loved it as a kid, and watching it again is both nostalgic, and WHAT a refreshing break from the filth, profanity, sex, and gore that tv producers seem to think today's society demands. Well I don't doubt a lot of them do; but I can assure you that in showing these to my grandkids... they LOVED it. (Even though it was in black and white).  Now I have Amazon Prime, and can watch it streaming (not sure if it's one of the free or  ""pay"" shows, but I LIKE ""owning"" my shows. There's something about KNOWING you can watch what you want, WHEN you want--and you don't have to pray your Wi-Fi or streaming is working to watch it. Now it says ""4 dvd's"" on this package, I might add, what I got was TWO dvd''s that were double sided.  I don't mind that (especially for the price) They all played great (and I am VERY careful with them). It had some features including the captions if you want/need them. But the BIG plus here... is the PRICE.  Have you seen what seasons two and three cost? Much as I love Donna and her family, I can't fork over nearly $25 or more per season-- I'll just have to wi-fi it for anything after I finish season one (but like the good ol days, I'm stretching it out! I watch it once a week in my own timeslots, but Thursdays are Donna Reed Days.. and that way my collection will entertain me for a year. I hope the prices come down for the other seasons; because I'd really like to get them, but well over $100 for just 4 seasons is a bit out of this teacher's price range. If you love wholesome family entertainment from a time when the world was a LOT more ""family"" oriented and enjoyable -- you'll love this show!",1519862400,,1695,4.206153846153846

8290708,4,B001CO42LQ,"I watched this show a a child.  I liked it but didn't realize that good TV would soon be a thing of the past.  The first season is really good. Great plots and just a feel good show.  The first 5 seasons of Donna Reed are good. The acting and writing is good and the show is not completely syrupy, like Leave it To Beaver.  It is  fairly realistic from my memory, of our family life. I enjoy this show. I only watch old shows, I don't like the trash on TV now. It is trash, sex, violence and a lack of morals and  maturity that is disgusting. I only watch the first 5 seasons of this show,  after that this show became silly and the plots frivolous and boring. Not sure what happened but the character of Donna changed and not for the better. The character of Trisha was annoying. I saw a few episodes of the show on YouTube, the later seasons. They were not good.  So glad the first 5 seasons are on Amazon.  They are  the best seasons and they entertaining to watch.",1499212800,,968,4.128342245989304
