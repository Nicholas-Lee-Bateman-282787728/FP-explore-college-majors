4314320,5,B004B93RG0,I enjoyed it very much. It is about issues faced many places. Only thing was I do not believe in ghosts coming back into our lives.,1352073600,2,131,4.076923076923077
4314321,3,B004B93RG0,"I have not received this DVD yet, nor any of the others which I placed on the order at the same time.  Perhaps you would be kind enough to check into that for me.

I have tried to ""track"" the order but it just tells me it has been dispatched.

Kind regards

4314338,5,B004B93RG0,Clover is a wonderful story told by a 10 year old girl.  It is the story of a little black girl when her father is killed in an accident and she suddenly becomes the step daughter of a white lady.  I happen to have met the author who is a delightful lady that runs a peach stand in North Carolina.
