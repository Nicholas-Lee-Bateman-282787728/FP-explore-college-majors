444960,3,6302256690,"Initially I was a little disappointed that the story didn't go deep enough, but as time goes on, I find myself feeling very fond of the movie.
Hillary O'Neil (Julia Roberts) needs a job and a place to live, and so interviews for a live-in position taking care of a sick person in the ultra-wealthy neighborhood of Nob Hill in San Francisco.  The job calls for some nursing skills, which she doesn't have.  She flunks the interview.  However, the young man who is sick, Victor Geddes (Campbell Scott), is secretly watching the interview.  He overrides the interviewer and hires her. The job pays $400.00 a week, plus room and meals, which for Hillary is the good life.
Victor, Geddes Hillary learns, is a Phd. student in art history who has completed everything but his thesis.  His thesis is about two, or several, German impressionists.  He shows Hillary slides of their paintings.  The artists were obsessed with the women they were painting.  One of the artists, Clint, has a number of paintings of a thin woman with big, flaming red hair.
The connection between Hillary and the red head in Clint's paintings wasn't pulled off very well.  We still feel like Victor hired Hillary mostly for her looks, independent of anything else.  It still comes off more as a coincidence than one of the reasons he hired her.
Hillary comes from a background where she worked in Diners, parties in clubs and discos and sleeps with construction workers.  Victor comes from a background that included butlers, personal assistants, never learning to drive because his family employed a full-time driver.  The two have a lot to learn from each other.
She doesn't know what she got herself in for.  Victor has Leukemia.  One of Hillary's jobs is to accompany him to chemotherapy treatments at the hospital and take care of him afterwards.  Hillary has quite a strong reaction to just seeing the rest of the patients, large in number, at the chemotherapy ward in the hospital.  It's a normal, human reaction.  I don't blame her.  I would react the same.
Hillary is the type of person, who, when the going got too tough, always packed her bags and left.  She was without a place to live because she had walked in on her live-in guy, in bed with another woman.  So Hillary packed her bags and left.  After returning home from the hospital, Hillary has a temper tantrum, because she can't deal with it, and packs her bags.  Luckily she didn't leave.
We see scene after scene after scene of Victor suffering the after-effects of chemotherapy.  The impact of chemo, as show in the movie, can't be underestimated.  No wonder when people speak of chemo they tend to do it in the same hushed tones as the big ""C"" itself.
In any movie with a young good-looking female and male lead, we viewers expect, or hope, they fall in love.  This aspect, I feel was handled well, somewhat realistically.  Hillary is ambiguous throughout.  They become close; they become friends, but any normal woman would hold back from falling in love with someone in Victor's shape.  Nothing in the movie was suggestive of gold digging, except for a remark by Hillary's mother, and that's to be expected.
Victor intentions are much less ambiguous than Hillary's.  He just doesn't spell out what they are, early on.  In the latter part of the movie, Victor lies to Hillary and tells her he no longer needs chemo and takes Hillary to a vacation house in the country.  The truth is, Victor has renounced any more chemotherapy, and what he wants to do in the country is to try and live normally for a time before he dies.  You can't blame him.
Victor's life has been cold and isolated.  He tells Hillary early on that his father, a lawyer, is in Japan on business while suffers through chemotherapy.  When Victor first hires Hillary, she subtly and insinuatingly manages to probe if Victor has hired her with the intention of sleeping with her.  Victor bluntly replies that there have been other women in the house before.  What Victor is looking for is love and intimacy.
My hope for Hillary's character is that the experience will help her to put her own problems in better perspective.  Can't deal with seeing the chemo ward?  Try having leukemia yourself.  Hillary can always pack her bags and leave.  Victor cannot.  My hope for the viewer is that s/he comes away with a respect for the life of the dying.
Julia Roberts' and Campbell Scott's roles were balanced, but the film focuses more on the drama surrounding Hillary rather than Campbell Scott.  Although looking at the problems associated with being the caretaker for someone dying of cancer is a legitimate one, the person with the cancer has the bigger problem.  Campbell Scott should have been the lead role.  His was the far more dramatic viewpoint.
Hillary O'Neil was a more sober role for Julia Roberts than her usual movies, although the personal side of Hillary was similar to the Pretty Woman and Erin Brockavich roles.  This is what viewers have come to expect of her.  I find that one of Julia Robert's most interesting strengths as an actress and a woman is that she is capable of turning on hundreds of different facial expressions showing all sorts of nuanced feelings, attitudes, shades of emotions, colors and facets.  This story was a perfect vehicle to exploit that talent, but we see little of it.
What is disappointing is that given the material and the cast, the producers, director and screen writers should been able to create a much more powerful movie.",1028332800,11,5481,4.739176346356917

445046,4,6302256690,"I'm giving this story a 4-star rating for portraying the suffering of cancer patients and the frustration of Victor, who feels denied of hope, of a future and of the ability to enjoy life & connect with others because of his disease.

In 1991, I was a teenager when I watched the movie; 25 years later, I have just read the book. In between, I have been through a number of life experiences, such as falling in love and seeing family members through cancer. So revisiting the story I find it tragic but for the less-than-obvious reasons:

**Spoiler alert**

1. People whom I know that are / were living with cancer get hope from making the most of the good days in between treatments and in remissions. However, neither Hilary nor Victor's father really understand how to help Victor improve his quality of life despite the disease on the physical (through palliative medical care) or the emotional (helping him to participate in life, find some fulfilment & happiness in his good days) front.

2. The love affair between Hilary & Victor feels forced - but that doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the story as that's a realistic view on things. Hilary didn't know Victor before he was sick, and in both the book and the movie, there is the feeling that although she cares for him and is fiercely loyal, part of this is because she would find it unconscionable to ditch him in his physical state. To me that is the 2nd tragedy, that if Victor had a partner who had known him and shared his life before the illness, that partner would be more able to see him holistically and help him pursue a quality of life that could mitigate (though realistically, not necessarily eradicate) his bitterness.

- The book's ending was realistic given how the characters were portrayed -- Hilary didn't love Victor enough, I got the impression that her conscience was the only thing stopping her from leaving him. And that's why her love was not enough to give Victor the will to carry on.
- The movie's ending was more uplifting and carried a stronger inspirational message, but the story arc of the characters felt too rushed and I think more could be done to show how Victor could find quality of life in spite of the suffering in going through treatment.

Still, this was written in the 1990s so kudos to this story for making some effort to surface the less pretty aspects of cancer, beyond milking it as a tear-jerker plot device but glossing over the less-than-glamorous realities (""Love Story"" / ""A Walk To Remember""). More strides have been made since then in the thinking behind palliative care & quality-of-life, and I hope these get the spotlight someday in popular culture.",1471651200,,2671,4.684434968017057

445178,3,6302256690,"Enjoyed the picture, and particularly appreciated how the two main characters inhabited very different worlds.  The male lead is art graduate student working on his doctoral thesis, well educated, but lacking in human sensitivity.  Who is suffering from leukemia. The female lead is a likeable working-class gal, with little education, but some smarts and heart, who answers an ad for a live-in support person. The film sported a fine musical score and excellent production values.  I found myself wondering what other work Campbell Scott has done, as he was decent in this role.

Yet, I find I have ""had it"" with the hackneyed theme of a cancer patient relying on obsolete, yet conventional, oncology treatment...suffering with serious chemo-related side-effects (Well, duh, this is mind-numbingly horrific poison you are injecting!), improves, then ultimately succumbs.  Sure, it's sad (lots of pathos!), but more exactly pitiful...as an educated person would have some awareness of alternative cancer theory and treatment methods, or would make some effort to secure someone competent in this field..or read some books, for Christ's sake.  Or consult the Cancer Control Society for information and referrals.  There was a slight nod in this direction, in that the female character provided her ward more wholesome meals and herbs, and insisted he stop smoking.

The reality is that providing some alternative measures, while continuing with conventional therapy (like the regimen of the highly advertised Cancer Treatment Centers of America these days) is akin to washing down arsenic-laced cookies with a solidly nutritious smoothie at the neighborhood health food store.  In a word, nuts.

One who understands the nature and etiology of cancerous tissue will understand that the ""Terrible Triad"" of surgery, chemo and radiation is precisely the ""wrong way to go.""  For a start, Google ""Cancer, Dr. Otto Warburg"" or ""Cancer, Alternative therapy,"" and use your noggin for something more than holding up your Stetson.  And, PLEASE, insist Hollywood provide us with more interesting, and more hopeful, stories about cancer patients.  Sheesh!!

If you are tempted to dismiss me as an unrealistic dreamer or someone who lacks experience with cancer (or a heartless SOB), consider that I had a mother with a couple of breast lumps, who was subjected to a double radical mastectomy by a butcher of a surgeon in the seventies, providing her a legacy of a few more years, in a life which had been thoroughly devastated.  And, consider that I have known cancer patients who have beaten this disease using alternative methods, and are happy and healthy many years later.",1313366400,,2663,5.292161520190024
445179,3,6302256690,"DYING YOUNG is a story about a pair of twenty-somethings, who are thrown together by way of a newspaper advertisement for a nurse. Campbell Scott plays a 28 year old graduate student in art history, who is enrolled at Yale University, but elects to stay at home in his Pacific Heights home in San Francisco, because of his need for extended chemotherapy. Julia Roberts plays a 23 year old nurse wannabe, who answers a newspaper add requesting a nurse to take care of Mr. Scott. Campbell Scott is the son of George C. Scott, one of Hollywood's most famous actors.

For those not familiar with the San Francisco Bay area, Pacific Heights is where the wealthiest of wealthy make their homes. The character played by Julia Roberts lives in the crime-ridden, un-glamorous city of Oakland. The cinematographer accurately portrays Oakland's lower class neighborhoods (where Julia Roberts lives), as being the home of a harmonious melange of Asians, Latinos, and African-Americans. Anybody can visit the small Chinatown in Oakland, located in between Webster Street and Broadway, and see a neighborhood that is similar to that in the movie. Julia Roberts plays an uneducated type without any particular technical training, who adheres (but not fanatically so) to an array of superstitious beliefs regarding nutrition and diet. Ms. Roberts' beliefs regarding diet are a distict improvement over the dietary habits of the Campbell Scott's character. Mr. Scott's diet, as shown in the movie, consists of Hostess Twinkies supplemented with cigarette smoking.

Okay, these two characters are thrown together. Then what happens? The storyline allows the two characters to click together and to develop together. This is a good thing. The graduate student has a father (wealthy attorney), but he is on a business trip in Japan for most of the picture. Ms. Roberts takes care of Mr. Scott when he is vomiting, when he has night sweats, and so on. Then, there are moments of tension. At one point, Ms. Roberts threatens to abandon Mr. Scott, because his bout with leukemia is too stressful for her.

Then, the two develop some sort of emotional attraction for each other. This particular pairing is reminiscent to that of Julia Roberts with Richard Gere in the film, PRETTY WOMAN (a pairing which, to my mind, was most improbable but certainly not impossible). Then, Mr. Scott decides to bring Ms. Roberts along on a vacation to the artists' colony in northern California known as Mendocino. The movie does an excellent job at showing the scenery about Mendocino, as well as the charming statue atop city hall in Mendocino. And again, there are more moments of tension, where low-life farmworker living in Mendocino takes a liking to Ms. Roberts, and attempts to steal her from Mr. Scott.

The film has a surprise ending, which develops reasonably and with deliberation towards the final dozen minutes of the film. I would like to give the movie FIVE STARS because of choice of filming in Mendocino, but I gave the movie only TWO STARS. Why only TWO STARS? Because I did not exactly care for the love triangle that involved the farmworker. Wasn't the Campbell Scott character under enough stress because of his leukemia? Was there any need for the storyline to subject him to the love triangle, as well? The time spent on showing this love triangle could just as easily have been spent on other activities available in the Mendocino area, such as whale-watching, or a trip on the Skunk Train in nearby Fort Bragg, or perhaps a drive through the Chandelier Tree (a redwood tree) in Leggett, California. Also, the scene with the maze did not fit well into the plot -- it was just something added on. The first half of this movie is fine. But the storyline in the second half of this movie is garbled.

445206,5,6302256690,"""Dying Young"" The soundtrack alone is enough to make you watch this movie over and over again. Why not just buy the soundtrack? You might ask, the scenes' and the music fit together like a beautiful puzzle and its cinematic magic to watch the music and the scenery in unison.

Julia Roberts gives ""in my opinion"" her best performance as Hilary, a woman who pretends to be a nurse so she can get a job as a live in caretaker to a man with leukemia `unbeknownst to her at the time"" after her boyfriend cheats on her and she leaves him. Campbell Scott is heart breakingly convincing and a pleasure to watch as Victor the handsome young man she is going to be taking care of. The chemistry between the two is wonderful, at times you can feel Victor's yearning for Hilary so strongly that you want to reach out and touch her for him. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous as is the film itself..

This movie never fails to touch my heart. It is a tear jerker but a lot of times in a "" that's so sweet kind of way"" and sometimes in a heart wrenching manner.....It's in my Listomania of ""My Favorite Tearjerkers"" Its also in my top 20 favorite movies of all time",1172880000,4,1152,4.304147465437788

445209,2,6302256690,The plot of the story was ruined by the immorality and language.  This could have been a beautiful story if sexual immorality and profane language had been eliminated.  It is possible to have something beautiful and clean where when you finish you feel that you have experienced something encouraging and uplifting.  Dying Young and the plot of sickness and someone caring is beautiful.  Falling in love is beautiful but it is degraded by stooping to immorality.

445210,3,6302256690,"Before she became a star Julia Roberts did small films such as this one.  Although she doesn't have great range, she does a good job and is believable as a woman who gets drawn in emotionally to a dying man.  The leads are very good, but sometimes the movie relies on cliches.  She's from the other side of the tracks, goes clubbing and is uneducated.  He's working on his phd, is cultured, and hasn't been able to experience a full life due to his illness. This part could have been done better.  Still it is a welcome relief to the pat dramas Hollywood is turning out now.",1152144000,,574,4.327102803738318
445211,5,6302256690,"I find it refreshing whenever Hollywood puts out a

touching love story which involves real life situations.

Beautiful performances are given by Campbell Scott & Julia Roberts in this highly insirational film. If you think

this is just a depressing movie dealing with a man

dying, this is not so.  I found that Victor, the 28 year

old man suffering from leukemia since 18, is a very

sharp educated & loving person.  You really cant help

to not only like him but really pull for him as you

watch this film.  It's interesting to see Julia Roberts(Hillary)

in a role where she experiences such unconditional

love for a man in his condition.  He is strong yet weak

& she is naive but smart.  What I took away from Dying

Young is how Victor & Hillary both share this transition of

experiencing unconditional love through such an adverse

situation. Its very inspiring for us to see how such strong love

can be such a gift. Two understanding people in love can

successfully melt all of lifes fears away by allowing it.

It has surprisingly well humorous moments so there is a nice

balance.  I appreciate that this movie is not doom & gloom

by showing the human spirit can not be defeated when unconditional love is present.  Victor & Hillary

help remind us to live each precious moment in our lives

to its fullest. How inspiring.",1131667200,3,1341,4.591489361702128

445213,4,6302256690,"DYING YOUNG has many of the markings of an Indie movie - good story, fine script, exploration of sensitive subject matter, solid acting.  But this 1991 Joel Schumacher film has big stars, gorgeous settings, and as fine a music score as you can imagine, so it proves that Hollywood can get to the core of fine message film making after all.

Hilary O'Neil (Julia Roberts, radiant and in peak form acting-wise) lives in Oakland, CA with her ditzy demeaning mother (Ellen Burstyn) and has a lousy boyfriend and clearly needs a new life.  She finds a job description in the newspaper that leads her to apply for a position of a nurse to a family living on elegant Nob Hill in San Francisco.  Clearly out of her element but determined to better her life, she fakes her way through an interview with a Mr. Geddes (David Selby) and his butler Malachi (George Martin) and overheard by Victor Geddes (Cameron Scott), the son who has been living with leukemia for 10 years, only to be dismissed as unacceptable.  After storming out of the mansion in disgust, Hilary is followed by Malachi who says she must come back for another interview - this time with Victor who is impressed with what he heard and saw and ultimately hires her.

Hilary's life changes dramatically as she lives in elegance and discovers the difficulties of caring for a cancer patient on cyclical chemotherapy.  Between Victor's near-death bouts of post chemotherapy side effects, Victor shares his writings about art, introducing her to the works of Klimt and Rosetti and the joys of classical music.  Hilary shares her lifestyle of bars and disco with Victor and the two become bonded.  They eventually take a vacation after Victor informs her his chemotherapy is over and they enjoy the bliss of the wine country where they are nourished by friends, among whom are the wise Estelle Whittier (Colleen Dewhurst) and the funky Gordon (Vincent D'Onofrio).  It is evident that Hilary learns from Victor and Victor from Hilary and it is a sharing and bonding that is beautiful and wholly believable.  The film ends quietly with a tremendous reverence for life.

All of the actors give excellent performances and Schumacher paces the fluid action with such skill that he allows us to enter the lives of these people with grace and naturalness.  It is good to encounter a film with heart that knows its message and its bounds.  Grady Harp, April 05",1112832000,3,2404,4.789346246973365

I also was not convinced by Julia Roberts performance and saw no reason for her to gradually fall in love with the gentleman that is going through the ordeal.  He seemed to be very obnoxious the whole time!

445249,4,6302256690,"Okay, I'm not any kind of Julia Roberts fan. I think she comes off as pompous and self-centered in all her movies...with the exception of this one. She plays a girl named Hilary, a bright, intelligent girl who is trapped in a world of limited funds and virtually no career advancement. She deserves better, but she's not likely to find it in her dead-end, working-class milieu. Salt in the wounds is added by her insensitive mother who compares her unfavorably to her, Hilary's, peers and by an unfaithful boyfriend. Seeking a way out, she answers a help-wanted ad for a nurse/companion to a critically ill young man. She fudges the interview and is promptly dismissed. Her pride wounded, she bolts down the sidewalk street of the affluent San Francisco neighorhood only to be called back by the ubiquitous butler, Malachy, who informs her that the job is hers. Turns out that Victor, the critically ill young man, was surreptitiously observing her during the interview and has chosen her over many much more qualified candidates. The pay and fringe benefits are a dream come true for Hilary, who promptly moves into Victor's mansion as his live-in nurse/companion. When he isn't busy showing her slides of Klimpt's work and debriefing her on Art History 101, he is either going for chemo in the hospital or throwing up at home. We suddenly don't envy Hilary, as she more than earns her pay and keep in these trying duties. Victor and Hilary are from different worlds: he turns her on to Klimpt; she turns him on to the local bar scene. Each learns from the other. And Hilary, the impoverished girl from the other side of the tracks, gives Victor the one thing that all his money can't buy him: the joy of life and the desire to live. I deducted a star because it was unclear whether or not Victor would live at the end of the movie. It was gratifying that they fell in love.",1050624000,4,1875,4.633633633633633
445250,5,6302256690,"""Dying Young"" is one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen on film! The story centers around a woman (Julia Roberts) who is hired to take care of a cancer patient (Campbell Scott). When they first meet, they don't have the greatest respect for each other. Through time they both teach each other incredible things and eventually fall in love. What makes this movie so heart-breaking is Campbell Scott's refusal to continue his cancer treatment towards the end of the movie. I won't tell you what happens at the end, but believe me, you'll need plenty of kleenex - remember, crying doesn't necessarily mean a bad ending. :)
I would highly recommend this film.

And shes simply astounding here, with not a false note or stumble in any scene. Campbell Scott plays Victor with a sensitivity that I don't think any other actor of the time could have managed.
