8442908,3,B004V4RUYK,"THE GENERAL in 3D has its virtues but it also has serious liabilities.  In its favor, the 3D effect works well.  It's not overdone and it has a pretty realistic and rounded appearance.  I'm no connoisseur of 2D to 3D conversions but for the most part this is as good as any I have seen. The only glaring problem is with the title cards, which, of course, have nothing 3D about them and seem to my eyes to be blurry rather than sharp, and with some color fringing.

As is well known, the film is a masterpiece.  In my opinion, the 3D conversion doesn't do it any harm, but it does not improve a beautiful work which was just great as made by Buster Keaton.  It would be worth while if it could persuade someone who otherwise would never look at THE GENERAL to experience the film here.

The amazon.com page states that this is a DVD-R manufactured on demand, either by amazon itself or by some vendor that is not disclosed on the product page.  However, the copy I received from amazon is actually a pressed DVD, published by a company in Greece called ""Blue Laser.""  It is Region 0 but in PAL (European) format, which means that it cannot be viewed on most equipment in North America which reproduces NTSC only and does not support PAL.  Also, although it is clearly stated that 3D glasses (anaglyph, red/green lenses) are required for viewing, none are supplied with the DVD, leaving each purchaser to obtain them apart from this DVD purchase.

The image quality and musical score (uncredited here, but by Robert Israel) are very nice, as they should be, for they have been stolen from the Kino ""ultimate edition"" DVD.  Although the film is in public domain, pirating another publisher's product, especially one in which a great deal was invested, is at least unethical.  The music score is copyrighted and as I produced it, I can attest that its use on this product is unlicensed.

Buy this if you are terribly curious to see the 3D conversion; otherwise, I would recommend either the Kino ""ultimate"" or Blu-Ray editions, or the Image Entertainment edition which offers THE GENERAL as a double feature with Keaton's STEAMBOAT BILL JR. and scores by the Alloy Orchestra.",1313539200,9,2171,4.634464751958225
