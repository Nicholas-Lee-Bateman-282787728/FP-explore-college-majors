8756764,4,B01DRYRJIG,"It is quite a musical roller-coaster ride (the image of one suchlike coming back onto the screen here and there in the video!) to see and to hear the entire British TV series, ""The Story of Popular Music"" (5 DVDs together in the container, in ""The Palmer's Classic Series"", the North American edition viewed being Isolde Films TPDVDBOX-1), most of which offers good image at a 4:3 screen ratio (expressed as 16:9 on the container), with infrequent exception. Actually, since the playing time per disc is not particularly long, it is possible to get through it more quickly than one might suspect at first glance.

The first evening spent with the set, I viewed and enjoyed immensely the first three DVDs in the set, comprising the introductory DVD and episodes one through nine on discs two and three. The range of pop and related styles there and throughout is so much broader than in many documentaries of this kind that the set never loses a single moment of interest. There is the usual inane sociological sort of commentary or focus on song texts that non-musically-trained commentators annoyingly natter on about at the expense of the music itself, but even that sort of thing is less heavy-handed, for the most part, than what so many thick-skulled American academics and other would-be specialists mouth off! (Such people really need to read Gunther Schuller's close, truly music-oriented two-volume historical examination of jazz, blues, swing, and such styles, although, of course, the series casts its net even wider than that among black styles); Schuller's is a really pathbreaking work unrivalled even since its initial volume came out so many decades ago (at a time when I was working for Gunther Schuller as one of the staff of the New England Conservatory of Music).

For example, that fashionable black liberation/identity dude, Leroi Jones (a.k.a. Amiri Baraka), is among those whose inanities are even more irrelevant, all the more marking him out as a ""faux-savant"", than those of some of the others heard speaking about the music. Baraka even makes a ludicrous comment, given the example that he chose to prove his point, about how catering to white taste degraded black music. The song and performance of it which he singles out is a good ""cover"" of the Platters' hit, ""Only You (Can Make My Dream True)"". That song is a wonderfully sophisticated and beautiful one, by any black or white standard, even if it does not conform to the jazz-blues/saloon-roadhouse-bordello/gospel model that Jones so esteems, The poor nincompoop, obviously, does not notice some of the soulfully refined detail to be heard in the rendition, the bass playing, for example, being very artful, but Leroy Jones has too much social theory clogging his head to perceive such musical subtleties! Black music is as varied in type, expression, and musical means as white music has been, in all of its own ebony and nearly infinite variety also is, and ""Only You"" is a song to which any ethnic group should be proud to lay claim.

Anyway this production is very enjoyable, despite such gaffs that occur along its course. Of course, the ""All You Need Is Love"" documentary is a very famous series which got loads of well-deserved attention when it came out. Not having had TV since 1962, I never had seen it previously, which makes discovering this 1976-1980 documentary gem so much later makes it all the more fun to view. The segment, to single out something among so many treasurable episodes, which is devoted, quite generously, to the variety show genres (music hall, vaudeville, burlesque, etc.) in the U.K., in France, and in the U. S. of A., is particularly fine, with much interesting footage included that apparently (some of it, anyway) had been little known or viewed previously.

The set gradually winds down, by the 4th and especially the 5th disc, in regard to continuity, production quality, and cohesion at these points, but I still enjoyed the last two discs immensely. There are, alas, more flaws in the commentary, but not enough to spoil things unduly most of the time. It was particularly outrageous to compare black gospel music to the wonder-bread white, icky, bloodless likes of Pat Boone, whose tepid music-making is in no way a fair comparison point with black gospel. (This is not even particularly to have in mind such other lily-white neo-evangelical crud as C.C.M., a.k.a. ""Christian rock"" and the at least equally lame Christian hootenanny, whiningly intoned dross that also constitutes another strand of C.C.M. slop!) For one thing, gospel music, black and white alike,  traditionally is a Fundamentalist and Pentecostal musical phenomenon, of the gospel-based Baptist, Wesleyan Methodist, and Pentecostal/Holiness sects in the inner city and in small towns of the South and Midwest. Boone has been part of what is called ""neo-evangelical"", white suburbanite, tamer-than-tame blas, less strict, often kitschy, middle-class Christianity.

There is a common thread, a strong, musical, and pervasive one, that is at the root of what genuinely constitutes traditional white gospel music as well as black gospel music. That, namely, is the repertory and practice of the singing and playing found in the Revivalist heritage of ""hot-gospelling"" Fundamentalists and Pentecostals. Both  whites and blacks share the same repertory of 19th century Revivalist hymns and gospel songs which, as the common starting point, one finds in the gospel music anthologies (and, to some extent, the shape-note hymnals of the mid- to late-19th centuries) of those religious movements. The most famous compiler of 19th century repertories (anthologies) of gospel music (hymns and gospel songs alike) was Ira D. Sankey. His publications have never gone out-of-print. I have vintage 19th century and reprint 20th century copies of these, as do many others who cherish this music. The content of such volumes still forms the backbone of gospel music, black and white alike, as heard in its genuine manifestations. That gospel music is RED HOT, neo-evangelical dross is NOT. The reason that I, for example, as a young fellow, could sing in  racially integrated white and black vocal quartets in gospel music, as I would do with another white boy and two young black dudes at the famous Baptist church (demolished in recent years, which made me sad to learn) in its heyday of gigantic gospel concerts with great celebrities involved as well as regular church-goers, black and white, is that the four of us were accustomed to singing the same thing, from a musical aspect: the kind of four-part harmony which traditional white and black gospel music share.

What makes the white and the black sound differ in how they perform gospel music is tonal quality, vocal and dialectic accents, and different degrees of rhythmic articulation and freedom within the beat. Otherwise, black and white gospel music, ""the real thing"", is the same, which is why black and whites could be singing together in that music. Leroy Jones rears his ""polically correct"", rather Marxist, and sociology-obsessed head again, to sow misunderstanding, making his contribution to obfuscate the real issues about black and white music, secular pop or religious. He is a musically-deprived, crazed ideologue who does not know so much  as he assumes about the substance of what he is ranting on about when it comes down to the music itself!

However, all of that is incidental to the enjoyment of so much of the really fine musical documentation and journalism that one finds in this series, which covers such wide ground and diverse styles that to discuss more (let alone all) of it surpasses the scope of a mere review. I love this series!",1504742400,,7702,5.0566929133858265
