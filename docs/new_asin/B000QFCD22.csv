and the movies are the best in my own oppinion, I love Rocio
Durcal and Marisol, the best singer in Spania, not forgetting
Joselito, I was very lucky, because I saw the movies and hear
them all the time in radio, I love Marisol, Rocio and Joselito!!!",1273536000,,312,4.216666666666667
8227672,2,B000QFCD22,"I was very dissapointed when I watched this movie. Both, video and audio quality are not the best. It seems like whoever has made this ""legal"" copies of Rocio Durcal's movies is taking advantage of the demand of them after her untimely death. ""Las Leandras"" and ""Cristina Guzman"" (movies) have the same problems and they are only worth purchasing it if you were/are a hard core fan of Ms. Durcal and her early years.",1213920000,,416,4.635135135135135
