2653842,5,B000I8OFK0,"Leonard Bernstein dedicated this performance to the memory of his late wife, the actress Felicia Montealegre. It was recorded during two concerts in July 1988 in the beautiful St. Mary's Cathedral in Diessen at the Ammersee and has been available as a CD since 1989. The DVD's bonus has the conductor present, as an introduction to the work, a deeply felt reading (in German) of a letter by Mozart to his father dealing with the subject of death and its serene acceptance. Bernstein uses the Franz Beyer ""completion"" of Mozart's unfinished mass. His tempi are predominantly slow, accents are sharp, and the excellent Bavarians, both orchestral and chorus musicians, achieve a high level of transparency despite the reverberant church acoustics. Bernstein's reading of the score is neither ""romantic"" nor ""authentic"": it is unique in its uncompromising, searing intensity. The four soloists are outstanding. All in all, this may not be your one and only performance of the Requiem, but it is immensely moving and it will stay with you. Get it while you can.",1243814400,10,1056,5.074712643678161

2653845,5,B000I8OFK0,"I am a Bernstein fan but I usually find his late-period performances drawn out in a way that didn't necessarily bring out anything in the music.  His slower-than-Furtwangler approach sometimes meant doing something TO the music rather than WITH it. In this case, in the Mozart Requiem (in the edition by Franz Beyer), his late tendencies work. Or, more likely, he simply reins things in more. (This performance was released on CD years ago and you can head over to those reviews and read every sort of adulation and criticism.)  It is a powerful interpretation and appears to be very spontaneous - sometimes Bernstein pauses between sections; other times, he plunges into the next section.  Although this is not a period performance, he does not use a huge chorus.  It is a very measured, personal and gripping performance, extremely emotional but not infuriatingly so.  The setting of this performance is a wonderful church in Bavaria.  Bernstein makes his entrance and there is no applause.  (Either the audience was asked not to cheer before the performance of the Requiem or the setting/occasion discouraged applause.)  Similarly, there is no applause at the conclusion of the work.  Instead, we hear church bells tolling as Bernstein quietly exits without much fuss. His ""Lenny"" persona is nowhere to be seen.  He died two years following this July 1988 performance, nine months after his Berlin performance of the Beethoven Ninth, a performance that is almost painful to watch.  In the Requiem, we see him still strong (relatively), although there are none of the podium mannerisms that were his trademarks.  He is an old man near the end of his life - he understands the meaning of a requiem beyond its musical value. A compelling extra feature on this DVD is a short introduction by Bernstein.  He reads - in German and with little dramatic empasis - a letter written by Mozart to his father.  The letter explains his - Mozart's - happy life but also his awareness of the shortness of life.  The letter sets out very concisely part of Mozart's character.  He was a vibrant young genius who nonetheless was deeply aware of the impermanence of everything.  To hear Bernstein's deep old man's voice reading these young man's words is a small revelation.  Here, Bernstein seems to be indicating, is a young man with his life ahead of him and yet thinking of death as inevitable and he does this without a trace of self-pity, terror, or irony.

Bernstein, of course, sees himself in this work but he does not aggressively act it out or overpower it. He does not meddle with the music. It's not going to be to everyone's taste - this performance is, after all, a Bernstein performance. Yet, there is much more Bernstein than ""Lenny"" here.  It is a defining, almost valedictory, performance, one that, if I were doing a documentary film about either Mozart or Bernstein, I would end with.",1169510400,37,2889,4.857142857142857

The orchestra, the choir, the soloists, the church, Lenny, the filming, even the extremely disciplined packed-in audience could not be better.

8144424,5,B000I8OFK0,"Bernstein clearly has the devotion--even adoration--of the Bayreuth forces at work here. While Bernstein wasn't known as a ""Mozart conductor,"" the performance here is totally enthralling.",1389052800,,187,6.230769230769231
8144425,4,B000I8OFK0,"Having heard at least two dozen different recordings of this work over 30 years, and participating in its choral performance twice ... I can confidently state this is the most unusual performance out there.  However, unusual is not necessarily a bad thing.  This is an extremely moving rendition, and I would rate it well above the Bohm and Solti DVDs in terms of pure watching & listening enjoyment.  And I surprise myself because I have always been generally suspicious of Bernstein, and would have normally preferred Bohm or Solti in just about any repertoire.

Yes, parts of it are slower than average--the Lacrymosa in particular is excruciatingly, even unmusically slow.  The Agnus Dei also borders on the tedious.  But one cannot say the whole performance is slow.  Some of the other movements are quite sprightly, I would say for example the Domine Deus and Confutatis are even more sprightly than most other recordings.

There are a few other odd touches such as the unexpected subito piano here and there, crescendi and decrescendi not indicated in the score, and annoyingly the final sung syllable ""est"" being held out interminably.

Still it is a great production, and recommended.  What this production has that others lack is a sense of event.  Bernstein's whole heart and soul is into this performance and it shows.  It is also visually stunning.  Visually it is one of the most beautiful and enjoyable DVD concerts I have seen.  Also, don't miss Bernstein's spoken introduction in German, and be sure to run subtitles even if it's hard to find as it is on my player.

Unfortunately it is not a distinguished group of soloists.  Other than Maria Ewing, I would have to say the soloists are basically unremarkable.

IMO the greatest Mozart Requiem on CD is the old Karl Richter recording which maybe most people don't know about, or the Karl Bohm CD with Ridderbusch (NOT the Bohm DVD--more on that some other time).

In short this should not be one's first or second Mozart Requiem, but it could definitely be third out of the huge field, realizing that it is a personal, different interpretation.",1381795200,4,2112,4.884831460674158

8144427,3,B000I8OFK0,"This is one of the great requiems with 4 great soloists. It was shot in a baroque cathedral of immense beauty. Unfortunately the video at times looks like it was shot through cheesecloth and video is only 65 minutes long. And the skin color of everyone is kind of pasty, With these old videos they should be combined to give the viewer more value. For instance this would have gone quite well with his Mozart's Mass in C also shot in Bavaria.",1335139200,,442,4.402439024390244
8144428,2,B000I8OFK0,"I purchased this performance a couple years ago, never having watched or listened to Bernstein and his conducting style.  I love Mozart and here was a chance to experience a concert with an accomplished conductor.  I came away from the multiple viewings consistently feeling that this interpretation is not for me.

This Requiem is not about Mozart, or the orchestra nor the vocalists.  It's about Berstein.  I do not care if it's a piano concerto or sonata, a quartet or trio, an aria or an opera; if the participants place themselves above Mozart it just doesn't work.  Maybe if you've had too much wine or beer or whatever some night and you're feeling ALITTLE over the top, this DVD may do something for you.  But not for me.

There is one curious item to note, however.  Most people know that the Requiem is actually divided roughly in half.  Up to the first 8 bars of the Lacrimosa is Mozart, or as we say ""Mostly Mozart.""  The second half is Sussmayr.

Bernstein seems to have a better feel for the second half!  Which leads me to feel(without being polite about the matter) that he can raise music that is average to a higher level of appreciation.  Music that does not need to be raised to a higher level (such as the 1st half of the Requiem), he actually hurts and destroys.

Think of this not so much as a critisism of Bernstein; think of it more as a reflection of one performance on one piece of music at one point in a famous conductors life.",1284076800,4,1456,4.462121212121212
8144429,5,B000I8OFK0,"This old Unitel production from German television in 1988 is, as far as I'm concerned, one of the real highlights of the late period of Leonard Bernstein. It is more measured, and less sentimental, than many late Bernstein pieces -- although don't get me wrong, I actually love the sentimentality of his late conducting. But this one is different, it is a solemn and powerful reading that manages to be very emotional without exaggerated sentiment.

Bernstein uses the Beyer edition of the Requiem, a revision of the traditional Sussmayer completion of Mozart's unfinished score to make it more ""Mozartian"". The tempi are slow, which is not much of a surprise for late Bernstein. The main program on the DVD has a runtime of about 64 minutes, of which the actual performance is roughly 58 minutes, once you take out a (sort of strange) one-minute break in the middle. Compare this to Harnoncourt's performance of the Beyer edition, which clocks in at just 49 minutes or so. Still, the slowness is not cumbersome, but effective in this performance.

Bernstein dedicated this performance to his deceased wife, as he says in his touching German-language spoken introduction to the piece. I'm a bit skeptical because she had died ten years before the performance. Since Bernstein himself died just two years after the recording, it is tempting to look on this performance more as his own reflection on mortality than a tribute to his wife. This is indeed the feeling I got at the end of the performance, when Bernstein kisses the four solo vocalists and then disappears into the offstage darkness in silence (the audience must have been instructed not to applaud). It had the look and feel of a departure, and was actually quite moving.

The stereo sound is beautiful, and a 5.1 mix is also included on the DVD although I have not heard it. My only problem with the sound was the organ, which kind of distracted me a couple of times as it sounded like it was just hanging out by itself somewhere in the distance on the right channel, almost as if we were hearing the organ from the church next door.

The video looks, well, like it's from German television in 1988. But the church is spectacularly baroque, and the performance by the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and Chorus is terrific. Highly recommended!",1249603200,9,2307,4.818181818181818
