If you are a Popeye fan, chances are you already own these cartoons, probably more than one version.  As with most Popeye releases, this DVD has no particular restoration or special features.
None of these are particularly standout Popeye cartoons, coming from Famous Studios' ""cheap gag"" era.  The ""& Friends"" part is from the inclusion of a Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoon and a Foghorn Leghorn cartoon.  These are not ""Popeye meets..."" cartoons, but entirely separate.
