I bought this video because the other street fighting video by him that is sold here on amazon is about $30 more and sounded exactly the same. I just assumed this one was the same with new packaging. I don't know if it is or not.

Well, if you're like me, you like fighting and learning new things. Hey, why not learn something new from a legend like Bas Rutten? He's a real cool guy. What I liked about this video was Bas talking more than showing fighting techniques. The talking was funny and actually helpful. He's great at presenting the different scenarios. Most of the video takes place in a ""typical"" bar and shows you various bar fighting techniques. Then it moves into a 1/4 size ring and he shows you a couple more ""advanced"" techniques. The video is about an hour and fourtyfive minutes.

The fighting moves are practical and I'm assuming, effective, as Bas is a professional fighter so he knows what he's talking about.

The moves are explained and played at full speed,(but his opponents are moving in obvious ""I'M GOING TO THROW A LOOPING OVERHAND RIGHT"" super slow motion)and some are shown from a couple angles, then, annoyingly, re-played in silent, slow motion, which is helpful, but can become irritating.

I bet these moves work GREAT when all your attackers are coming at you in slow motion like the bad guys on the video. They don't stand a chance! I'm assuming you need a partner to really gain the full effect of these moves, as practicing them at half speed as shown is the only way to develop the muscle memory to make them effective.

So, I would recommend this video if you can round up a buddy to practice with, building up to 3/4 speed punches and kicks, or if you want to get a general idea of some moves you may remember in time should an actual bar fight occur.

Not really anything new that you haven't most likely read in a basic karate book. Pretty basic moves, pretty elementary techniques like ""use a beer bottle to attack your enemy"" or ""pick up a chair to create distance."" I think most people would naturally reach for a weapon, trained or not, in a real fight situation.

So, worth buying if you don't really know ANYTHING about fighting, or if you are a big Bas Rutten fan and appreciate his candor.

NOT really worth purchasing if you have even the most basic understanding of fighting.",1351209600,,2351,4.525943396226415
