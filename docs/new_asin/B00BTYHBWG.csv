5673277,5,B00BTYHBWG,"Well damn!  I just finished watching this movie-I had not really heard of it when it was released, but I'm collecting all things Redford as he is one of my favorite actors.  I loved Barefoot in the Park, and Butch Cassidy, and The Sting, and Out of Africa, and The Way We Were, and Three Days of the Condor and Up Close & Personal. Hell, I LIKE all his movies, but this one surprised me; it was really great. I think the plot was intriguing, there was great character development, and it certainly did have a resolution (something lacking in too many movies) though I hated to see the way it ended.  It was just well cast and very well done.  Robert Redford is not just another pretty face and he shows over and over again that he can do more than fluffy romantic comedies.  I'm very glad I added this to my DVD collection.",1464393600,3,823,4.283870967741936

5673283,5,B00BTYHBWG,"This is a film that I think many people will enjoy. It is about a three-star general who made a mistake that resulted in the death of eight of his soldiers, and as a result he is sentenced to ten years in a military prison headed by a colonel who never saw military action. This colonel runs the prison by using fear and the mistreatment of his prisoners. The general soon sees that he needs to take over the prison in order to save the prisoners. The acting is very good and the suspense created by the tension between the general and colonel is good, as is the question whether one of the soldiers, who was always a self-interested conniver, will join the general or help the colonel.",1448841600,,686,4.3671875

5673291,4,B00BTYHBWG,"I've caught parts of this movie on TV before, and I've always wanted to see it from the beginning.  Now I've finally gotten the chance.  It's a great movie with a star-studded cast.

[SPOILERS FOLLOW]  (Well, only one spoiler, but it's a major one)

It's a good honest story, which is my way of saying the ending is tragic.  However, it's not a complete downer.  It's both uplifting and sad in different ways, so if you only like movies with happy endings, this one isn't for you.  The only thing I would have done different if I had directed it is I would have made James Gandolfini's character more complicated.  He is a two dimensional villain in this movie, and I think he should have had some redeeming qualities to make him more interesting.",1440979200,3,747,4.514925373134329

5673296,5,B00BTYHBWG,"The movie is as I remember it.  I saw it recently and found a copy on your website. I enjoy it very much. I thought it was one of Redford' s better movies. Makes you wonder about the phrase ""once a soldier always a soldier "".",1431561600,,225,3.891304347826087
5673297,5,B00BTYHBWG,"This is a movie right up there for me with the film, ""Brubacker.""  Both are highly recommended-- particularly for those working with institutionalized human beings.  The quiet, contemplative, and sensitively concerned personality types Robert Redford plays so naturally is a personality type crucial to managing people whose lives have been stopped in mid-course by institutionalization.  Running places that do that sort of thing to people is a no-win situation, one that often arouses sadistic qualities in the people responsible for them.  This is the result of the limited satisfactions such work offers, and weaker personalities invariably fall to fantasies of being super tough to compensate for the sense that their task is always bigger than they are and full of internal contradictions.  Institutionalized human beings who have lost their way have always served as blank slates, invisible to the public for who they (the institutionalized people) really are because we prefer to project upon them out own fantasies of what they are all about and of what is going on within them.  We pay a huge price for this, of course, as the institutionalized come out (if they ever do) largely dehumanized by their stay in such places.  Alternative approaches are possibleas I have done all of my career, and as these two movies seek to illustrateprovided we can control our frustrations over how difficult the job is, how much unrecognized creativity is required, and the tons of generosity and forgiveness one must be ready to dispense.  There is such a huge gap between those who run these institutions and the public, and I am grateful for the way such movies try to get them closer to each other.  I urge you to buy and watch it, as I have.",1429920000,,1741,4.975862068965517

8573783,5,B00BTYHBWG,"I saw this movie when it first came out, and have been trying to track it down for a few months. Finally, I came to Amazon and was not disappointed; especially with the price.

If you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you rent it and give it a shot. This was the movie that got me into Robert Redford movies, and thus I discovered movies that came before this that I now still enjoy. I won't go into what the movie is about, I don't want to spoil too much. The movie is engaging from the opening credits until the very end. You'll form opinions quickly on the main characters, you'll bond and connect with them, and almost feel their pain the entire journey. Do not miss out, I assure that you will not be disappointed.",1486080000,,720,4.255474452554744
