8602634,5,B00E8PZ7CE,"This is a very good DVD.  There is much discussion on Thomas Sheraton's notes on how to create the molding which gives you a peek into the historical background of the molding.  In it are demonstrated, rabbet, hollow and round, snipes bills, and side round planes.  These are not planes that many people will have, but if you do and are interested in the subject it is an excellent reference.  I enjoyed the DVD",1479686400,,411,4.513513513513513
8602635,1,B00E8PZ7CE,"This is a waste of money material. It doesn't demonstrate the subject you want nor does it explain and give the measurement.
Don't buy this you won't benefit a thing out of it.",1429056000,,176,4.363636363636363
