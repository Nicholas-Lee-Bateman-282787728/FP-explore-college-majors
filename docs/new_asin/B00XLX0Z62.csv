7170971,5,B00XLX0Z62,"Think of this movie as every disaster movie rolled into one. I enjoyed San Andreas a lot and they certainly managed to cram almost every survival scenario into one movie.

When the movie started I thought it would be insanely cheesy with some of the lines Dwayne Johnson was saying, but luckily it got much better. Don't get me wrong, there were certainly cheesy parts (certain romances, and cliches) but when you see the first 5 minutes you'll know what I mean about expecting it to be way cheesier.

The movie is similar The Day After Tomorrow in that it's about one group's Journey and another's survival. Without giving anything away it focuses on two separate groups of people trying to get to eachother, however unlike most other disaster movies the main character (who is extremely likeable) is someone who is adequately trained and equipped to handle the situation, not the fish out of water that most disaster movies like to turn into the survival experts by the end of the film. This at least makes for a more believable plot and one heck of a fun ride.

In 2015 we expect great visuals and CGI, San Andreas does not disappoint, there were several points during the movie that I was focusing on the CGI to see it's quality and I was impressed. Hollywood's big budget disaster movies get better and better at destroying our cities with every iteration, San Andreas falls right in line, the visuals and accompanying audio are truly spectacular.

I highly recommend you see San Andreas if you like disaster movies, once the action gets started there are very few slow points, at only two hours long the movie does not feel drawn out - you won't be bored by the end of it. Watch it with big sound and a big screen if you can.

Hope you enjoyed my review! Wish I could be more specific but I don't want to ruin any of the (albeit somewhat predictable) plot.",1432944000,200,1862,4.562874251497006
7170972,5,B00XLX0Z62,"If there has ever been a disaster film showing the severe damage that a earthquake can cause, it is this one, the premise of this film is nothing new, Hollywood has had its share of disaster films over the years, this one more or less has elements of ""2012"" in it, but is more faster paced than ""2012"" was, but it does borrow from that film which was good in its own right, like that one, we have a estranged couple (Dwayne Johnson & Carla Gugino) who are brought back together by this disaster, Johnson plays a fire department search & rescue helicopter pilot who witnesses Los Angeles suffer a severe earthquake, it appears that the San Andreas fault has begun to shift & buildings begin to tumble with Gugino just barely escaping with her life who is rescued by Johnson, it also appears that the quake is also causing San  Francisco to be affected as well, which suffers far more devestation than Los Angeles, their teenage daughter is in San Francisco with Gugino's new boyfriend who ends up abandoning her to fend for herself, Johnson & Gugino decide to fly to San Francisco to rescue her, although we have seen Los Angeles & New York leveled in other films, never have I seen a film in which San Francisco gets leveled to the extreme, residents of that city are not going to be fans of this film, this scenario is so real as San Francisco gets leveled like never before, the filmakers make it looks so real & frightning, even the Golden Gate bridge gets leveled,  definately one of the best disaster films to come along in awhile, this one is definately ranked up there with films like ""2012"", ""Deep Impact"" & ""Independence Day"" & is what the filmakers of 1973's ""Earthquake"" might have done if the technology of CGI had been available then, Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) is fast becoming one of Hollywood's best action stars, I would definately put him up there with Stallone & Arnold, a former wrestler turned actor, Johnson is one of the few to make such a transistion, others have tried & failed, but Johnson is no doubt a natural when it comes to being a action hero, & Carla Gugino proves that at age 44  you don't need plastic surgery to look younger, just take care of yourself, Gugino is still beautiful & one wonders why she hasn't had a better career before, somehow she has been overlooked by Hollywood over the years, & I have to wonder why, if you like disaster films than this is not one to be missed.",1432944000,169,2418,4.490909090909091
7170973,4,B00XLX0Z62,Great casting for this movie although I wouldn't have chosen Duane Johnson to play hero rescuer.  If Costner was available he would have been very good in the starring role.  Don't get me wrong Johnson is still A Rock but he still can't act.  Others were very well chosen.  High packed adventure with great special effects.,1432857600,3,323,4.714285714285714
7170974,5,B00XLX0Z62,"I thought this movie was fun, exciting, action-packed, and sorta sweet at times.
The actors do a very nice job, especially the two leads, and yet the real stars of the show are the action and special effects.
From start to finish, there is nothing but movement.  Saw it in the theatre, and you're always wondering if noise and talking will be a problem - this movie started, and nobody made a sound.  Johnson does an especially nice job, and clap-hands to the CGI department on this flick.
Great fun Summer movie.",1432857600,3,513,4.565217391304348
7170975,3,B00XLX0Z62,"Considering how disaster films have been a bit sparse for the past few years, I was looking forward to getting my fix of the genre in seeing how ""San Andreas"" would portray ""The Big One"" that'll inevitably hit the Sunshine State, and all the destruction and chaos that would come with it.  While the finished film wasn't quite the show-stopper I was hoping it would be, it was still a fun time.

In many ways, ""San Andreas"" feels like a poor man's version of ""2012""  The two have a similar look and feel, right down to the wide vistas of LA sinking into the ground and CGI that looks almost identical; I wouldn't have been surprised if some of the scenes of destruction were deleted from Emmerich's film and re-used here.  But where ""2012"" was a global epic with numerous scenes of mass-destruction, ""San Andreas"" feels much smaller, with only a few such sequences.  To be fair, ""Andreas"" isn't meant to be a world-wide event, but it does have a poorly-developed idea that the quake would affect the entire country, which gives the impression that the scope was trying to be much bigger than it should be.

The story of ""Andreas,"" regrettably, is predictable and formulaic: the first half is the standard ""Fractured Family Tries To Survive And Reconnect As A Big Disaster Happens"" scenario that we see in so many disaster films, complete with the ""Hero Trapped In A Building That's Surrounded By Chaos,"" ""Hero Trapped In A Car In A Dangerous Environment,"" and ""Scientific Expert Who Was Ignored But Now Has Everyone's Attention,"" tropes that are presented time and time again.  Heck, we even get the ""Intrepid Reporter Out To Get Her Big Scoop"" and ""Hero Spots Cowering, Terrified Child That Nobody Else Notices"" moments that feel like they were crossed off a checklist (thankfully, there's no teddy bear that falls down and gets left behind in the latter example).  I was even able to predict what some characters were going to say at certain moments.  A vital path is blocked?  They're not going through... they're going around!  Likewise, I correctly guessed that the hero was inevitably going to step in and save the day at the opening incident when his coworkers fail to do their job.  San Andreas' story feels like it was almost assembled by a committee, which doesn't do much to separate it from the other big-budget disaster spectacles we've seen over the years.

However, this ""Movie-by-formula"" feeling is overcome in the second half when a tsunami hits San Francisco (not a spoiler, since it's in the trailer); earthquake movies focus almost exclusively on the ground opening up and buildings falling down, so having the third act focus on a flooding city rocked by aftershocks is a refreshing change of pace and makes for some terrific action sequences that I won't spoil here.  If you like seeing lots of environmental damage and carnage, San Andreas will fit the bill nicely.  With only a few exceptions (the flipping car in the beginning is so cartoonish that I had to stifle some giggles), the visual effects crew are to be commended for doing a great job, especially with the tsunami hitting San Francisco sequence, which by itself is worth the price of admission.  I was also pleased with the cast; all do solid work, the child character isn't annoying in the slightest, and The Rock is excellent as the Charismatic Larger-Than-Life Family Hero With Really Big Muscles.  One thing I really liked is that, unlike other disaster heroes who are angry or upset at their ex, the Rock's character gets along with her well, and doesn't hesitate to come to her rescue when the shaking starts.  It's a small moment, but one that makes him really likeable.

While the film isn't destined to become a classic of the genre, ""San Andreas"" a very solid B movie that's content to provide visceral spectacle, a good pace that doesn't dwell on things unrelated to the quakes, and characters who aren't plagued by self-doubt and hung up on their flaws and fears.  You won't remember much about the movie the week after you see it, but if you like disaster films, it's a fun way to spend two hours.",1432857600,30,4097,4.751763046544429
7170976,4,B00XLX0Z62,"SAN ANDREAS (3D, 2015), although Dewayne Johnson, a former TV wrassler, is the featured player, let's face it -- the special effects are the real star.  The story, apart from the special effects, is cliche disaster movie:  The hero's wife has left him and already has a new boyfriend, the hero's teenage daughter is in danger, the wife's boyfriend is totally inadequate to the challenge, and the hero rescues his daughter by the most heroic and improbable methods, winning back the love of his wife, and even the daughter has a new beau and everyone is happy.  A plot that can be described in one sentence.

The special effects are well worth the money you paid to see this flick.  Johnson plays a rescue helicopter pilot for the Los Angeles Fire Department, and the film starts with a skin-of-his-teeth rescue from a car halfway down a chasm.  From there, seismologist Paul Giamatti has just developed a method of predicting earthquakes and proves it with a spectacular scene of Hoover Dam breaking up. This is immediately followed by signals predicting an enormous earthquake up and down California's San Andreas Faultline, from Los Angeles all the way through San Francisco.
And that happens within the hour.  Johnson's daughter is in the high-rise belonging to mom's bf in San Francisco when the quake hits and the plot takes off from there. You might even forget to ask ""Who's steering this copter/plane/boat with stuff being thrown right in our path?!""

What is obvious is that the film's technicians and artists did breakthrough work on the Star Wars level.  You go to this movie to see the spectacular effects of an entire city roiling in a series of extreme earthquakes, followed by a tidal wave, with skyscrapers tumbling like axed trees; if the dialogue were in Turkish, you'd still go. So go for the gusto and watch it in 3D.",1432857600,4,1837,4.806349206349206
7170977,2,B00XLX0Z62,"A divorced couple (the guy is LAFD helicopter search and rescue) aspire to locate their daughter after severe earth shift in California. Numerous buildings pancake and some survivors roam the streets like zombies while others loot.

The lost daughter teams up with two brothers from England and aspire to stay alive long enough for the dad to locate them. Some swear. To me this looks like it aspires the question, ""What would have happened if Lex Luthor's plan had worked in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-The-Movie/dp/B0012QVJXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman: The Movie</a>?"" as Hoover Dam breaks just like it did in that movie.

7170978,5,B00XLX0Z62,"San Andreas, starring Duane Johnson (The Rock) gives an emotionally effective performance in his efforts to rescue his wife and daughter separated by one of the most explosive, massive earthquakes the world has ever recorded in history, causing unforgiving devastation throughout the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco. Buildings topple left and right like lumbering giants, crushing all in their path. A huge Tsunami smothers and destroys everything in its path, the Golden Gate Bridge just a tiny obstruction to be bowled over in a wash of deadly sea water.
The Rock's journey into the heart of chaos is matched with heartfelt family bonds made stronger through the nightmare. Entertaining and well told.

The 3D in San Andreas is equally effective, essentially bringing you into the destruction with powerful 3D dimensions of objects, people and debris in each sequence. Rarely does the 3D let up, resulting in a thrill ride that doesn't disappoint. With a good amount of out of the screen scenarios, the 3D gets in your face as one would hope for a movie of this destructive caliber. Exciting movie and 3D for fans of the apocalypse.",1432857600,5,1142,5.010526315789473
7170979,1,B00XLX0Z62,"Mediocre entertainment. CGI galore but an incredible idiotic and thin story line. The script has more holes than San Andreas fall and don't even let me start talking about the acting. Even if you expect a good popcorn movie, you will leave the movie theater disappointed. There is a great disaster movie classic called ""Earthquake"" from 1974 that is much more enjoyable and realistic than this computer generated stupidity.",1432857600,8,423,5.144927536231884
7170980,5,B00XLX0Z62,"I am shocked this wasn't a bigger blockbuster.  It was so much fun and the acting was really good.  The script was, of course, not big on introspection and there were a few WTF plot moments.  But I enjoyed the heck out of it.",1533772800,,225,4.068181818181818
7170981,4,B00XLX0Z62,"It has Dwayne Johnson so how bad could it be right? Well, not bad at all. The special effects were so incredible that I was convinced several moments that I could feel my bed shaking! The storyline was *meh* but the CG made up for it...and the Rock was there too, so......had to take a star on that.
Yeah, one must suspend belief at times but there was a good lesson to be learned; we are woefully unprepared for the Big One. We here in Southern California are living on borrowed time! Unfortunately, in order to do what is necessary to avoid apocalyptic loss of life, it would take more money than we are prepared to spend. Sad commentary on where our priorities are.

Yes, the San Andreas fault has a hissy fit that scores almost a perfect ten on the richter scale, laying complete devastation to anything in its wake. Although the CGI special effects are spectacular, they are, at times, so over the top that they look to be what they are. No matter...they still keep you glued to the screen, beginning with the opening scene, when a car goes off the road in the mountains.

As the earthquake devastates northern California, the ""Rock"" goes into hero mode, as he fights for the survival and rescue  of his estranged wife and daughter. San Fransisco has definitely seen better days,  As buildings topple and a tsunami develops and engulfs the city, the Rock is right there,  flying a plane and skippering a boat...what ever it takes...As San Francisco collapses around him.

The action is highly improbable, but entertaining, nonetheless. The cast is very likable. If one likes disaster films, then be prepared to love this one, despite the need to suspend belief.",1519862400,,1046,4.853932584269663

I do remember that the people's reactions were very realistic...The way they walked in a daze, lost, crying, searching for loved ones, etc., and the reactions of the police and paramedic and fire rescue vehicles and protocol etc., was also what you would expect. I would recommend it for the most part, but if you tend to be more scientific minded and a medical professional, as I am, you probably wouldn't watch it twice.

7171092,3,B00XLX0Z62,"The Rock anchors the fault in this film which is saved, barely, by the cataclysmic visuals and not by any of the actors.

The two reunite and go on a road trip from SoCal up to the Bay Area to save their daughter (who should have been on Baywatch she does so much running and bouncing) amidst the carnage laying waste to California as the San Andreas fault slips and slides and creates mega-quakes.  The sub-plot/ light love interest involving two brothers and Roginos daughter may connect the younger tween and teen set to this flimsy film but will do little to involve adults who will wince at the obviousness of it all.  Will this movie scare the Cali locals into supposedly safer parts of the country?  No, theres so much sun in California that it literally bakes everyones brains (I know because I grew up there).  Will the scenes of massive destruction and the threat of Califor-nigh-A falling into the sea dissuade people from moving there?

7171128,2,B00XLX0Z62,"Can't argue with others as to the overall quality of the special effects but, Christ, I'm soooo burnt on beginning to end stereotypical blockbuster disaster CGI.
It's looking like one movie after another just roll into each other in a flurry of crashing, debri besotted, disaster porn - with the barest thread of a story or character development.
Regardless the premise, I'm continually disappointed by unrelenting examples of over the top, poorly realized, and very inaccurate, science, as well.
I want to be entertained, sure.
But pandered to, or given an overpriced Saturday morning cartoon?
Tired of it.

The Rock's good.
He's a natural.
But, again, it's the Rock.
We never worry that he will be outperformed by a tidal wave.
'Nuff said.
Beyond him, there are no memorable characters.
So, we're back to shock and awe.
The contemplation of what a community, in the midst of utter destruction,is experiencing, is best viewed at a Hollywood distance.
Otherwise, the film becomes something else.
Less adventure, more horror.
For most of us.
It's too huge.
Therefore, we get a snapshot of a handful of previously hashed and rehashed character archetypes that, by the end of the film, I still am not feeling one way or another about as to their various fates.
It's exciting, loud, SPFX'ed out the wazoo but so empty.

On a smaller, intimate scale, I'd recommend 'The Wave' from director Roar Uthaug.
It's a subtitled Norwegian film that, even with a similar premise, removed to a fjord and following, similarly, a family, over the prelude to, duration of and aftermath of a disaster, still brings forth more of a sense of audience involvement with the major players.
It's a much quieter, stately film.
There's no ""let's throw everything at the wall and see what sticks"" mentality going on.
And I didn't feel intellectually insulted by the end.
'San Andreas' wasn't even a blip, to me, when the credits rolled.
Say what you will about the generic 'who lived or died' ending, there was still a resonance about 'The Wave' long after it was over.
It followed a formula but imbued it with a little fresh air.
The effects are still very good in 'The Wave' but the difference is, is that the film isn't carried by those CGI moments.
Without its CGI, 'San Andreas' would never have popped its head out of a studio door.
The secondary actors were abysmal.
'The Wave', if it's effects had been filmed in a bathtub, with paper ship hats, still outperforms 'San Andreas'.
Yeah.
My opinion and everybody's got one.",1511913600,,2499,4.836448598130841

7171173,4,B00XLX0Z62,"(NO SPOILERS)

A big budget disaster movie. I'm a HUGE fan of disaster movies. It was nice to see some high quality effects in this niche.

BUT, I was expecting it to be a little better in the scientific accuracy department. If SyFy can satisfyingly get close enough for layman to buy into the premise of disaster, why couldn't this? I had a hard time getting over that.

Also, there's no real protagonist, except the earthquake. No creepy, jealous scientist, no corrupt, shady politician. It's just straight up survival. That didn't bother me so much, even if that's my favorite formula.

The action was enjoyable and the climax delivered. The actors, especially the English fellows were good. The romance was cute. I was ready for more Dias

STILL, it's a disaster movie worth seeing, especially for true fans. I'm glad I rented this one!",1505347200,5,840,4.805555555555555

But, don't think San Andreas fault would initiate a huge tsunami into San Francisco bay and the sea water would just stay there instead of receding back into the ocean unless the land mass of San Francisco fell a considerable amount.  The only reason the Golden Gate wrecked was due to a very large container ship carried on to it by the tsunami.  Otherwise, I think this bridge would have weathered the earthquake and tsunami.  The bay bridge, obviously, went down with all the cars and people on it.  The manly male star stole a helicopter from the LAFD to go to SF to save his kin, stole a pickup truck and stole a boat to zoom up the tsunami before it crested and then raced all around SF in deep water full of debris and had propellers which never hit anything.  Could never figure out whether the British youngish male lead had a brother or sister tagging along.

Dwayne has a solid movie career now of producing family-friendly films that pretty much manage to be appealing to adults, without being too scary for older kids.  He does it once again here.

I feel like Dwayne Johnson doesn't get the same baseline judgement as other actors due to his origins, and sometimes gets poor reviews due to the wrestling background.

In this case, he plays an excellent role, routinely with nuance.
The daughter character (Blake) is a good one, well fleshed with both vulnerabilities and strengths, a reasonable and realistic character, as is the mother (Emma) and Ben.

While there are some impossibilities regarding magnitude and follow-on disasters, it's a reasonable premise and believable story line. The effects are excellent, the story moves well, and the action manages to be fast and hard but also reasonable and realistic. The extraneous characters are as good as the main four or six.

I judge a book by how much I want to NOT read those last pages because I don't want it to end, and by how much I want to know what happens to the characters at the end. This movie checks both those boxes. Really excellent. Definitely on the shelf to rewatch going forward.",1492732800,8,1015,4.855491329479769

7171271,3,B00XLX0Z62,Dwayne Johnson did a great job.  He has turned out to be a fine actor.  The movie just boarded on the preposterous with one overblown sequence of events leading to another and then to another.  Similar to 2012 with John Cusack.  Good acting unable to pull itself out from the rubble of the movie special effects and pretentious calamity scenes.,1492041600,,344,4.683333333333334

This movie over the top sequence and human version of homing pigeons. Someone in editing or the script should have said..should we really do this? But I assume that massive amounts of starbucks expresso was in the writers and editing room..I like The Rock..but I think he is just getting to big..he walks odd at this point. Maybe make a movie of him moving things..and call it Flex..no theme..just moving stuff.

7171329,4,B00XLX0Z62,"I liked most of it.  I was disappointed how they cast Ioan Gruffudd as a total coward and made his part miniscule.
He looked too cute to be tossed aside and marginalized in this major special effects production.  This does not diminish
my respect for the quality work done by the other actors in this movie though.  I would also have appreciated some foreplay in the
script.  Everybody is always in such a hurry in the movies these days.  Why weren't there any people with bad dreams or overactive pets?
In the book ""The Sense of Being Stared at,"" he suggests that animals are the best indicators of impending doom.  They know what is
about to happen and are hypersensitive.",1486166400,,674,4.575

I was happy to be wrong and, while it is certainly requires a large dose of ""oh, give me a break"" it is lots of fun with good characters and a pretty good story. Really good special effects and imaginative action scenes. I would recommended it as entertainment and it is almost a family film, though maybe not for the youngest. It gets intense, though there is humor and some nice irony. I watched it first for free and then went and bought the bluray.",1486166400,,583,4.214285714285714
7171331,1,B00XLX0Z62,I need to clarify this rating.....I really like the movie( who wouldn't with the Rock) but I really don't like the DVD itself!!!! The movie was going along fine till it reached about half way through and the DVD went south!!!! It just started to fast forward all by itself then stop and not do anything then go all pixely and in slow motion. This went on for nearly the rest of the movie. It is very hard to watch a 3D movie like that.  BUMMER Unfortunately I didn't open the movie until it was to late to return it thinking it was fine coming from Amazon. I have never had this happen before. So I guess my lesson is to open and watch the movies as soon as they come to make sure they are alright so I can return if it have to.,1486166400,,728,4.020689655172414

7171346,3,B00XLX0Z62,"The Rock is honestly quite an amazing actor. Capable of range that few would expect out of an ex-wrestler, Dwayne Johnson is quite adept at fully embodying the roles that are put before him. Whether this particular performance was him slipping or the Director telling him ""okay, your objective is to be as bland as church wafers"", the ball was absolutely dropped. I would absolutely classify it as a disaster movie, albeit not because of the genre of film. To its credit, the three decent actors are the Rock's daughter and the two British boys who accompany her through the majority of the film. To its discredit, no one else seems to care (sorry, that's not entirely true. Paul Giamatti's performance was quite entertaining). The plot is thin, the special effects are pretty bad. Not Sharknado bad, but definitely not to par with other AAA films. Additionally, the main ""love"" interest to The Rock is his ex-wife, who's dating an architect who actually doesn't seem to be that bad of a guy. However, after leaving their daughter to die in a collapsed parking garage, he was written off by the ex-wife who then proceeds to rebuild the broken relationship with The Rock (why were they divorced? They clearly still like each other. And even if they get back together, the problems that caused them to divorce aren't going to magically disappear). Whatever, it's a crapton film that's laughably bad. Have fun.",1485129600,2,1407,4.842323651452282

7171376,5,B00XLX0Z62,"Just finished watching ""San Andreas"" released Warner Brothers.
""San Andreas"" can best be described as a tribute to all of Irwin Allen's [sadly no relation] classic disaster movies and television shows all of which hinged upon a disaster of some sort.
Los Angeles Fire Department rescue helicopter pilot Ray Grainger may be the best pilot on the West Coast; but his personal life is in shambles.  Ray is still suffering from the pain of being unable to rescue his youngest daughter from drowning during a trip down the rapids; and as a result of the burden he's carrying deep within his soul, his marriage has fallen apart and his wife is waiting for him to sign the divorce papers so that she can marry her multimillionaire boyfriend - who just happens to be a world famous architect.
Yet when seismologists discover that the San Andreas Fault is about to cause the biggest earthquake on record, the warning comes way too late and Grainger  breaks the rules and absconds with a helicopter to rescue his wife from a skyscrapper just in time before it collapses.  Then Grainger and his wife learn that their daughter is trapped and has been left in an underground parking garage in Los Angeles.  In order to rescue their daughter, the newly reunited Grainger and his wife outwit and out flee looters, a tidal wave, and collapsing skyscrappers.  All in all, great fun.

They played in Race to Witch Mountain which is another good Disney movie. I like the chemistry between these two, this movie is about everyone surviving a major earthquake and Emma (Carla) and Ray(Dwayne) and their starter finding each other after a major earthquake  and the things that they have to deal with along the way. She meets Ben who was at  her mother's boyfriend's job for an interview who winds up rescuing her is little brother from a car she is trapped in, in an underground garage. The daughter who also played in Percy Jackson The Lightning Thief and the second movie The Sea of Monsters( I can't remember her name) who plays their daughter is trying to meet up with her parents.

The daughter's car flipped down a mountain a dozen times which damaged the car and shattered the windows. Nevertheless, the cell phone remained in the car and it was just fine. Impossible! How did she even get reception in the mountains to make a call?? Later...the mother was partially crushed by a building yet she walked away unharmed. Oh really?? There are lots of ridiculous scenes in this movie. The best part was the fact that it finally ended. I gave it two stars simply because it made me laugh so hard. Save your money.

It was really scary watching what could happen to LA if ""the big one"" hit because it was quite realistic.  It is a definite A+ action disaster movie in my book.",1474588800,,444,4.444444444444445

7171589,1,B00XLX0Z62,"""OH. MY. GOD"".  That phrase, with varying inflections, is the bulk of Carla Gugino's speaking part in this massive turd of a movie.  ""Dumb"" doesn't even come close.  It's as if they took every disaster movie cliche, put it in a blender, took every ounce of drama out, and Ta-DAAA!!  We actually had fun watching it at a certain point, it was like a parody of itself.  We just gagged and laughed and groaned and chanted ""Oh my God"" along with
the unfortunate Ms Gugino, a talented actress whom hopefully was well-paid for this bloated barf-bag of a movie.  And Paul Giamatti...well we all need a paycheck, don't we?
Those two are really the only bona fide ""actors"" in the film. Dwayne Johnson is.....well....what can I say.  He looks like a swollen  thumb puppet, but a thumb puppet is a better actor.
Carlton Cuse's ""script"" does no one any favors.  Every dumb line from every dumb movie ever made is recycled here.
  Highly recommended...if you are drunk, stoned, and dropping acid.  This movie makes Roland Emmerich's chhesy disaster films look like masterpieces.  Okay, I guess you get the picture.",1472860800,,1101,4.761904761904762

I think they only thing these folks left out was the earth opening up and a couple of businesses going into the breach.  If you live in San Fran and you own this DVD/BluRay, the last frame of the movie shows an overhead map of the west coast starting around San Fran and going south.  This map is what is projected (in real life) for the San Fran coastline and it's broken into islands and would necessitate a lot of bridges that they didn't need before.

7171631,1,B00XLX0Z62,"Ridiculously cliched and bland acting. Follow The Rock and some women as they use every form of transportation available, to reach their daughter. Helicopter, boat, plane, truck, it's ridiculous. If they had managed to throw in a hot air balloon and maybe bicycles it would have been more amusing and enjoyable. There's about 5 minutes worth of fake science with a professor and some students reading laptop screens with graphs going ""off the charts"". They're supposed to somehow represent how they can predict earthquakes but of course never with enough time to properly prepare for the quake. Jackass step-father character gets squashed by a cargo ship but we all saw that coming. Then there's the tsunami. A tsunami, apparently generated by a slip-type fault (what??) swallows the golden gate bridge and floods SanFran with 100's of feet of water, which is somehow perfectly clear and doesn't recede. Just forms a lake in the downtown area. Also all the debris manages to stay to the sides of the streets (naturally) so that travel by boat through downtown is not only possible but perfectly plausible (Idiotic).

Also, I accidentally bought this movie on the TV app - thought I was renting it. I don't even care that it cost me $8. Just wish Amazon could remove it from my library so I don't have to be reminded of how awful this was.",1470873600,,1338,4.817391304347826

My husband hates anything that is extremely unrealistic and even he said it was a good movie. Some of the graphics are a bit far-fetched but it is expected with any type of action/suspense/thriller movie.

7171654,4,B00XLX0Z62,"Im not a particularly big fan of disaster movies. Ive only seen a few of them, and about the only ones I really liked were A Night to Remember and 1997s Titanic. I recently decided to watch San Andreas,"" a disaster film from 2015. This movie imagines a major earthquake striking along the entire length of the California's San Andreas fault. This isn't your average major earthquake, either its the big one thats been predicted for years

San Andreas  stars include Dwayne Johnson, Carla Gugino, Alexandra Daddario, Archie Panjabi, and Paul Giamatti. Not exactly a Whos Who of elite A-List actors here, but I think they all performed very well in their respective roles.

Dwayne Johnson plays Ray Grainger, a Los Angeles Fire Department rescue helicopter pilot.  When a major earthquake hits all of California, Grainger takes off from Los Angeles with his soon-to-be ex-wife Emma (Gugino) in order to rescue their daughter Blake (Daddario). She is trapped inside a car that's buried beneath a destroyed building in San Francisco. While Ray and Emma spend their time trying to overcome various obstacles in their path, Blakes peril increases. Can her parents get to her in time to save her?

The screenplay for San Andreas, which was co-written by Carlton Cuse, Andre Fabrizio, and Jeremy Passmore, is about average for a disaster film  lots of soapy situations (impending divorce, rich boyfriend moving in, etc.) and disaster film clichs scattered everywhere. Somehow, however, it all seems to work. The story manages to hang together very well, thanks mainly to the very effective performances of Johnson and the rest of the cast.

Much credit must go to the first-class special effects shown in San Andreas. They are quite realistic, and, I suspect, gives a pretty clear picture of what could possibly happen when (and if) the big one actually hits California.

San Andreas may not be the very best disaster film of all time (that honor goes to Titanic from 1997), but I think it is an intense, exciting, and highly entertaining film that I can easily recommend.",1470182400,14,2064,4.9623188405797105

The acting was surprisingly okay, which is excellent for a disaster movie. I guess that I would have actually liked it more if the acting sucked because it would be bad all-around. Instead, it's more eh than bad, which makes it less enjoyable.

It was kinda boring, so unless you just need to waste time, I wouldn't bother.",1468022400,,518,4.34020618556701

For a professional wrestler turned actor, Dwayne Johnson has done pretty well in movies, but rarely above a three star rating. You can appreciate the love his character has for his family, but it's just ridiculous that he saves scores of people at each turn of events until he is finally in a position to save his own daughter and her new friends.

3d effects: 9/10, great depth throughout the movie, this is one of the movies where they pre-designed the 3d for the movie while in theaters instead of post processing for just the blu ray. very well done effects.
audio, the atmos sound track is fantastic, 9/10, they did a great job producing the surround track for each speaker and there are plenty of atmos sounds from the helicopter, explosions, building crashing, glass flying, etc. if you are an audiophile type person, get this blu ray for the sound effects alone.",1466985600,4,658,4.632478632478633

Some of the pros included the amazing cinematography, awesome cast, noteworthy action scenes, and deep themes. The only downer which unfortunately affected the entire film was the ""cheese"" prevalent throughout. It is one thing to be serious but it is another to go completely off the deep end. For this reason, however, I along with many friends thoroughly enjoyed the movie. We laughed through most of the film in between the extremely deep scenes just because Dwayne Johnson and Carla Gugino (his wife) reacted with such cliche sap.

7171936,3,B00XLX0Z62,"Dwayne Johnson has come a very long way when it comes to ""real"" acting as opposed to that Pro Wrestling stuff.  That's one of the best things of the movie.  As Ray he gets the job done.  Paul Giamatti, an actor whom I normally have a great deal of respect for, suffers in this film.  I'm not sure he was the best choice for the role.  He seems way too one dimensional and ""flat"".  The ""girl"" who plays Blake, Ray's ""teen"" aged daughter, is 30 years old.  Do people really think viewers are so dumb they don't realize this stuff?

The special effects certainly has this movie tied up.  They are good.  I imagine that were pretty fantastic on the large screen.  We expect big things from Hollyweird but we don't expect bull sh*t like ""the earthquake will be felt all the way to the East Coast"".  Yes, there are dumb people out there and they DO believe what they've been told.

7171956,4,B00XLX0Z62,"I thought that there were some great parts to this movie and then there were parts where the movie just dragged on and on for no reason. It's hard adjusting to movies where The Rock plays a serious character, but he does a decent job.

Here's the bottom line without spoiling the whole movie; if you love TONS of computer graphics and loved the movie 2012, then you would probably like this movie. It's basically 2012, but only focuses on the San Andreas fault. Seriously, the only way they were going to make this movie this long was by dragging out many scenes.

Language is what it is and there is a lot of death in this movie, so I definitely would not recommend for children to see unless you want them having nightmares for the next year.

In the end, the movie is extremely far fetched and the heavy use of computer generated graphics gets annoying after a while, but if you watch it strictly for entertainment purposes rather than to see what will actually happen during a major earthquake, you won't mind this movie.",1462147200,,1025,4.5

Well, that might be so, and I'm sure he is a huge box office draw, but this was just an OK movie at best. The story was quite unbelievable, but aren't all these end o' the world movies? The visuals were awesome, especially on my 102"" screen with surround sound, and for those reasons alone, that is why I gave it an extra star.

7171999,3,B00XLX0Z62,"Watched this on Comcast on demand. It's okay. The primary focus was on the family relationships of the main characters. All of the action was shown in the previews. This is very annoying. People go in expecting an action-packed, non-stop thrill ride. What they get is a lot of 'hurry-up and wait.'
Don't get me wrong. The acting was good. The story (what there was of it) was okay. But, either put your full focus on the seismology experts & the 'event', or on the family. It was like wrapping two movies up together. Neither got an opportunity to shine.",1461542400,,554,4.55

If it weren't for The Rock and Carla Gugino, I wouldn't have bothered with this.  I'm pretty jaded, but the big quake scenes made me say ""whoa!"".

The think about this DVD it has all the extras with the actors / director interviews .. very interesting.  Dwayne Johnson did all his own stunts .. he'a an impressive man and good actor.  It also showed a good use for a laser ... You will like this action thriller ..... it's amazing how many special effects were built just for this movie.

However, I actually like the movie so I bumped it up to a 3.  The sound quality, however, is really good.  Lots of bass to rumble your sub, and a fairly good score.

If you already have this on blu ray (1080p) I do not recommend this version.  Even if you have HDR, you will not notice the typical 'pop'.  If you don't own this movie, and have a 4k blu ray player - it may be worth a look.",1459814400,,525,3.7181818181818183

The coincidences were laughable and the idea that a family finds each other in such chaos is so far-fetched that it makes a bad movie seem even worse. Were two leading actors ever so mismatched? In no way could the young actress be their daughter. And to top it all off she finds her true love only to almost drown but come to life after 10 minutes of screen time. Give me a break!

It was great until they started looking for the daughter and one min she's trapped under a garage and the next she's walking around on the street? Uh yeah totally unbelievable bc they skipped a part or 2. I was a little disappointed with this movie. I was expecting Dewayne Johnson action non stop beginning to end and it fell flat somewhere. Did they run out of explosives or ideas? The whole theory they were able to find the kids in the middle of a disaster was unbelievable too so I never got into it for lack of reality. Try harder next time and if you're going to hire Dewayne, let the man do what he does best.

7172308,3,B00XLX0Z62,"You'll understand my topic title when (if) you watch the movie.

I would have loved to give San Andreas a higher rating but it's filled with too many clichs.  Every single natural disaster plot point that you've seen for decades now in other films, and which are now usually relegated to the SyFy channel because they're no longer strong enough to capture the attention span of most movie watchers, is used in this action-packed film.  The movie writers clearly thought the presence of a popular powerhouse in Dwayne Johnson would be enough to carry the storyline through, even if it means the storyline is as formulaic as can be.  Then we have another problem- Dwayne Johnson movies tend to feel watered down, clichd and overrated.  I have no idea why this keeps happening.  It's like regardless what the storyline is about, it really feels like the same writers are working on *every* Dwayne Johnson movie giving them the same lackluster vibe.

I also wonder how people in San Francisco feel about a movie like this.  Powerful earthquakes of ridiculous proportions completely destroy the city, and they continue to destroy the city one section at a time.  For a while I thought this movie would be completely awful because it had way too many problems and the exaggerated special effects weren't helping matters, but it does slightly improve (based entirely on the amount of dangerous situations occurring for Dwayne, his ex-wife and their daughter as the movie goes along).

We got more clichs on the way!  Why does it seem like every natural disaster film has a teenage son or daughter who doesn't get along with their mom or dad's new boyfriend or girlfriend?  Yet *again* this type of characterization occurs.  This time Dwayne visits his ex-wife (Carla Gugino) who's dating a selfish scumbag of a man (Ioan Gruffudd) who doesn't seem so awful at first and instead seems impatient and/or dedicated to his business.  That is, until he leaves Alexandra Daddario (the daughter) alone to fend for herself when the earthquakes starts causing too many problems for Paul to deal with.  He runs away like a coward.  He pretends to care about her before this, but you can tell by the way he's acting it's only a matter of time until his true colors show.  Also speaking of predictable, notice how the kids always split up from their parents and THEN the natural disaster strikes, leaving two separate problems and clichd hopelessness only for the kids and parents to finally reunite in the nick of time and help each other?  Once again that occurs here.

Then we have two British guys (a teenager and his younger brother- hilariously the older brother is either Hugo Johnstone Burt or Colton Haynes- they both look the same so I can't tell you which one is really the older brother!) who are visiting San Francisco, and the older one happens to fall in love with Alexandra in the silliest way ever with no build-up whatsoever.  All the while Paul Giamatti's character is the scientist detecting unusual activity underground and warning people of a potential earth-changing earthquake that blows away all the 9.1 earthquakes of the past.

Unfortunately the movie relies so much on special effects involving Dwayne Johnson finding himself in against all odds situations only to prevail miraculously that it's hard to really enjoy this movie on a suspense level so it becomes an unintentional comedy.  Of course, predictably, he falls in love with his wife again as she ditches that scumbag of a guy she was thinking about getting serious with.  Well... the earthquake sort of gets rid of the guy for her, hehe.  I really hope people in San Francisco don't worry themselves sick over a movie like this because it does show all of San Frans distinct landmarks getting destroyed.  The darn news doesn't help either by reminding us that California is due for another major earthquake.

But fear not- Dwayne can do anything!  He can jump from an airplane and land perfectly on the Giants baseball field (AT&T park) with his ex-wife (and WOW is that a scary scene showing the ground beneath the stadium flapping like a blanket!)  Dwayne can control a boat and move it out of the way of falling cargo and huge approaching ships during the highest of tides.  He can rescue anyone who might be drowning (ahem).  Dwayne can stop trucks from driving over a fault line in the nick of time, and he can control helicopters and allow for safe crashes.  Even Chuck Norris must be impressed with these advanced skills.  At this time, I'm surprised Dwayne wasn't able to stop buildings from falling.  I also wondered what was going on with all the people in the city while the story was focusing on the main characters trying to deal with the earthquakes.  It was like they disappeared because there weren't any screams or signs of life.  Instead it got really silent which isn't real of course, because people would be screaming and we'd see people running around scared.

I actually think the two British kids were the best actors in the movie.  Their presence was at least a step in a different direction for the action/natural disaster genre, which I appreciate.  After all usually the teenage daughter falls in love with some clueless bozo.  At least this guy made an effort to help Alexandra.  Everybody else was bland, predictable and uninteresting. The same goes for the storyline, but the exaggerated special effects make this movie passable.  At least San Andreas never stops the excitement.  That darn earthquake however- it's almost like it knows when a life or death situation is coming up and uses *that* exactly moment to cause more building-shaking chaos!  Yeah passable and that's it.",1456531200,,5678,4.840414507772021

7172446,3,B00XLX0Z62,"I have always loved disaster movies.  They are almost all terrible, but they are often on the leading edge of special effects.  And I'm talking about all the way back to Irwin Allen's TOWERING INFERNO or even back to GODZILLA.  As a kid, those movies blew me away with their awesome destructive power!  In recent times, films like DEEP IMPACT or TWISTER breathed new life into the genre, featuring what are now pretty dated, but were once pretty advanced, effects.  I enjoyed 2012, not for it's great script, but for it's outstanding scenes of global destruction (and Woody Harrelson's delightfully unhinged performance).

So I prepared for the same guilty-pleasures with SAN ANDREAS.  But it let me down to some degree because the ""non-destruction"" scenes were particularly dumb and unbelievable.  Bad script, bad characters, bad acting.  Dwayne Johnson can be quite a charming actor and he seems on the surface to be well equipped for an undemanding lead role like this.  He will never win an Oscar, but his physical presence and charm should have tided him over.  But his part was SO painfully cliched and by-the-numbers that even The Rock crumbled under the weight of its high school level writing.  It was as though a child had watched a bunch of disaster movies and was told to write the dialogue to be like all those.  Or perhaps it's more accurate to say that it felt computer-generated.  No soul...just plot points to tick off.  Estranged ex-wife and her new husband who is clearly doomed to die (yep, just put Carla Guggino in Amanda Peets' role from 2012).  Attractive daughter in distress, causing Johnson to abandon his role as a search and rescue guy when the world most needs him?  Check.  Cardboard scientific characters will little purpose other than explaining to us the ""science"" of what is going on in a vain effort to lend credibility (thinking DAY AFTER TOMORROW here).  Check.  A ""cute"" kid who is spunky but still needs a bit of rescuing?  Check.  A romance developing out of nowhere when everyone ought to be focused on things like staying alive and the end of the world (thinking the POSEIDON remake).  Check.

Add to that some truly dreadful performances by Guggino and Alexandra Daddario (as the daughter), along with embarrassing turns for Paul Giamatti (as the ""scientist""...hope he got a good paycheck) and Archie Panjabi as ""the TV reporter.""  Just not good.

Fortunately, the movie is still watchable due to its scenes of destruction.  There is perhaps 20 minutes here of truly jaw-dropping special effects work as we watch major cities crumble to the ground in spectacular fashion.  This is the stuff viewers like me come for.  And SAN ANDREAS delivers.  (I watched in 3D...the 3D is okay, but I don't think it adds so much that you should go out of your way to see it in that format.)  The CG cities are convincingly rendered and more convincingly toppled.  (Things get dicier near the end when Johnson and Guggino zip around on a speedboat through CG debris.  They never quite look like they're really ON the water.)  So I enjoyed those moments very much.  They are just as rote and predictable as everything else...but as I said, I take guilty pleasure in these movies.

So, for me, it's 3 stars.  If you DEMAND good scripts and acting from your disaster movies...keep looking.  This is perhaps a one-star film for you.  And if you have a higher tolerance for bad writing and acting, then this might even be a 4 or 5 star movie.  So take my thoughts in their context.  If I watch this movie again some day, I'll be skipping MANY scenes and just cutting to the chase of some great destruction!",1455235200,,3629,4.751602564102564

The younger characters are delightful and the mother and daughter make strong female role models.
Mother is the soon to be ex-wife of ""The Rock's"" character who is all set to move in with her new richy rich architect boyfriend (who is a total sleaze but Mother hasn't figured that out yet.
There's plenty of CGI Destruction going on with an occasional practical effect thrown in just for variety.
The ending is a dreadful clich and has been since 1989's ""The Abyss"" (which was the last time that particular suspense inducing McGuffin actually worked. But over all I'd say the movie is Okay.

I don't know about the technical side of the fault issues like a comment made on the sidenotes on my kindle that said it was unlikely that the San Andreas fault would have made a tsunami that came back on the city of San Francisco but I wanted to see an action movie that did not go crazy with impossibilities and I got just what I wanted - a great view.,1454457600,,386,4.012987012987013

He also had his ex wife on board the helicopter. I certainly understand the circumstances involving his decision , but at least incorporate involvement of his superiors in the storyline to make it more credible.

I can't ever remember seeing Alexandra Daddario, who plays Blake Gaines, the daughter of Ray, before. She has a screen presence. Maybe it's her eyes (Green? Light blue?). I enjoyed the beautiful shots of a still intact San Francisco early in the movie. There's a parachuting scene into AT&T Park, home of the San Francisco Giants. What a beautiful ballpark. Just outside it, McCovey Cove. It's my second favorite ballpark just behind Cincinnati's Great American Ballpark. The second DVD that comes with this Special Edition is loaded with extras.",1454198400,,696,5.060869565217391

7172815,3,B00XLX0Z62,Could be just me but seems if you've seen one movie on some natural disaster you've seen them all for the most part. Not much of anything realistic about this flick.  The main character is portrayed as some sort of superman and the entire movie is pretty much predictable from beginning to end.,1453161600,,294,4.547169811320755
7172816,5,B00XLX0Z62,"Dwayne Johnson is Raymond Gaines, who works for the L.A. Fire & Rescue; the perfect ""hero,"" and man, was he was well-cast in San Andreas. This guy is flying helicopters and airplanes, driving boats and trucks, repelling down cliffs, running, swimming, etc. You name it, he's doing it, ten-fold.

Carla Gugino was a perfect partner to Johnson's machoism. Alexandra Daddario, playing Raymond Gaines' daughter, Blake, had a few moments of ""bad acting,"" but I think it was only because of awkward scripting in said spots. For the most part, she did an excellent and believable job. Paul Giamatti was excellent, as always, in his supporting role as Dr. Lawrence Hayes, a seismologist or geophysicist or a combination of both or something like that.

There is no need to go any further into the plot of this movie. Most people can figure it out by the title. However, just know that it is VERY well done, and everyone involved, actors and behind-the-scenes, alike, most obviously, put everything they had into it; heart and soul. If you enjoy disaster flicks, you will not be disappointed. If you don't, you will still find it to be entertaining and suspenseful from start to finish. Its four-star rating here on Amazon is no fluke. It really is that good.",1453161600,,1250,4.836448598130841

7172834,4,B00XLX0Z62,"Yup one major quake will cause subsequent quakes and it will start at the Hoover Dam between Nevada and Arizona causing the san andreas fault to crack open and cause a wave like quake up the state of california from la to sf a total of 382 miles whereas the actual 1989 earthquake that was shallow 10 miles affected 75 miles ( santa cruz to san francisco) IN THE SAME STATE!!!
Aside from the highly unlikely nature of all the coincidental incidents and the additional ""dont land the plane but sky dive out of it"" scenarios it was entertaining ..just like running up a wall of water out of SF Bay only to have a Tanker peak over the top of it...it could happen but most likely you have to remember that the SF Bay is about four to five miles before the actual wall of water to hit the GGbridge and that is if it could sustain the distance...me think not",1452988800,,852,4.265432098765432

Five Stars!
This was a kick a** movie. I haven't enjoyed an Apocalyptic Ride like this since John Cusack saved his family in ""2012"" The Movie.
Not only was this believable -- the characters were perfect too.
I'm not going to spoil it for you, but this is not as predictable a movie as you might think.
Furthermore, Dwayne Johnson is becoming a first rate actor. Not only does this man look good, but he's believable and (dare I say it?) I can't wait to see him in another action movie with integrity.

Please, give this man all the roles with guts, glory and God.

 Lots of fun. Popcorn-popper at its best!  Great effects and appropriate performances.
 Dwayne Johnson (in a 2-d extra) laughingly says he drove every kind of vehicle that could move in this film and, LOL, it's true!

My only slight complaint: The 3-D, while excellent for depth and clarity, makes the millennial mistake of being TOO ""tame."" Surely during all those eruptions, explosions, shatterings, a FEW things might actually come flying right at you!! It's fun. Ask your 10-year-old",1452384000,2,525,5.141176470588236

From the opening chapter to the end of the movie I was absolutely transfixed by it.  I do not have a Dolby Atmos system so the movie defaulted to Dolby TrueHD and I was just overwhelmed by the sound effects.  I hope this at least gets an Oscar nod.  If you ever want to demo your system, or impress your friends, look no further than San Andreas.  I cannot imagine hearing this on a well designed Atmos setup.

7172956,1,B00XLX0Z62,"There is quite a bit of irony in this movie. Dwayne plays a search and rescue pilot who has been through a traumatic experience. When the West Coast starts experiencing huge earthquakes due to plate tectonics, Dwayne dismisses the lives of everyone else around him and focuses only on his problems. People are dying all around him as he ignores their cries for help and begins the search for his ex wife for some unknown reason.

There are plenty of moments that will leave you unimpressed and saying ""that could never happen"". For example Dwayne somehow finds the one person he was looking for as he flies through thousands of people fleeing San Francisco without any help or the use of a cell phone, radio, etc.

Also, none of the characters are memorable or draw any sort of emotion from the viewer.

7172974,2,B00XLX0Z62,"Over the top and absurdly unrealistic. Most extreme disaster movies are, but I had higher expectations for this one given the ratings. Why this movie has such a high rating is beyond me. Two stars are for production quality, decent special effects and some of the actors do hold the movie above water. Otherwise the dialogue and acting is quite uninteresting. The cutesie attitudes of the characters in the beginning chopper rescue scene is obnoxious and clich. Johnson seems completely disconnected with true emotion throughout the entire film, except for his trademark angry/serious look. The storyline moves along impatiently, wasting no time before throwing characters into chaos before you really get familiar with them. It would seem the rush to over-the-top effects was done due to a lack of patience in creating authenticity, creativity and originality otherwise.

Not recommended. Movies should be refundable if you decide not to finish them.",1451433600,,951,5.34

His soon-to-be ex-wife, Emma (Carla Gugino), is in Los Angeles and his daughter, Blake (Alexandra Daddario) is trapped in San Francisco.

The San Andreas Fault is absolutely real and very basically goes from Salton Sea to Parkfield to San Francisco. Palmdale sits on the edge of the fault, in fact, The Antelope Valley Freeway 14 cuts right through it. The long-awaited earthquake is over 100 years over-due. It will happen.

Update: February 2016. Writers have been hired to work on writing a sequel starring Dwayne Johnson again. As of April 2017, they have a story treatment outline. No release date yet.",1451433600,,1304,5.49

7172987,1,B00XLX0Z62,"Save your time and money.  Really, really bad.  They should have hired an acting coach, a decent director, and a science consultant and MAYBE they could have pulled this off.  As it is, there is no suspension of disbelief at all!  All the action does not make up for the lack of substance, when none of the scenarios are plausible or believable in the least.  For example, the Hoover Dam, which has stood for decades, just spontaneously crumbles to bits at the very beginning of a 7.0 quake.  Houses utterly implode, and then explode, at the mere thought of a quake.  I'm no expert, but I think that kind of massive destruction usually starts a little into the quake, maybe after 30 seconds or so.  Then the final scene with the Rock speedboating through a tsunami-flooded San Fran.  Where were all the bodies in the water as he's zipping about??  Then he ends up swimming through the water to save his daughter.  It was crystal clear...no silt, debris, electrified wires, sharp objects, or dead people anywhere in sight.  It looked more like the lazy river tube ride at Aquatica.  Some of the Rock's other movies were tolerable (Tooth Fairy), but this was barf city.  His acting was over the top bravado and cheesy.  I want my $10 bucks back plus compensation for my time.",1451347200,,1273,4.620535714285714

To all those people, please don't ever watch a movie on the SyFy channel. Any of them.  For those who watch a movie without a notebook and stack of #2 pencils, this was really entertaining.

(live near an air force base)  While the plot may be somewhat predictable, I watch a lot of Los Angeles going under pics, there was enough variation on the theme that it was well worth watching several times. I especially thought the story line of the daughter/friend/brother of friend, refreshing. I also appreciated that the daughter was a nice person and capable.

Really, Dwayne?  Trusting ""autopilot"" to keep your chopper in one spot while you - the only person on board the damn chopper - go to help your ex-wife climb up the rescue rope?

Flying from Southern California to San Francisco on a maintenance-downed chopper and then running out of gas.  Borrowing a plane and flying the rest of the way - and then crashing the plane.  Grabbing a boat and then having to go out the Golden Gate to avoid the tsunami and then turn around and come back in - and somehow magically locate your daughter and her new friends.

San Andreas lays waste to LA and San Francisco on a scale that you have to see to believe. The film does seem to try too hard to be ""disastrous"" in destruction.
Through all of this Johnson and his wife, Carla Gugino, work to save their daughter and patch up their relationship. Luckily, the daughter is being helped by a couple of plucky young Brits in SF.
The action is pretty much non stop and there are plenty of great toys (trucks, helicopters, boats etc). San Andreas is an all-out disaster flick and I found it to be a lot of fun......if not somehwhat saturated with special effects",1451001600,2,801,4.493150684931507

7173065,1,B00XLX0Z62,"I can forgive a movie for having a few minor plot inconsistencies if it tells a story well. I can forgive lackluster special effects if the rest of the movie holds together. Unfortunately, not even the gratuitous special effects in San Andreas are sufficient to redeem it. Let's face it, even in a movie in which the entire point of the movie is the special effects, there is a lot more to pulling them off than the ""WOW"" factor. When it becomes necessary to suspend belief repeatedly, the entire movie falls apart. Frankly, the original Godzilla movies had more believable special effects. Physics matters. When the ground beneath you is collapsing, you're in a free fall and weightless. You can't leap to safety if there's nothing to leap from. This sort of thing happens repeatedly in San Andreas and one is left feeling at best disoriented.
Worse still is the plot, which is one of the worst I have seen in years. Firstly, without giving away too much, let's just say that the destruction of one of the largest dams in the world should have consequences far beyond the few people trapped on the dam at the time. Releasing millions of gallons of water into Southern California should have utterly destroyed LA, yet that wasn't even mentioned, let alone shown in the movie. That event should have been at least as dramatic as what happens to San Francisco in the film.
Speaking of which, a magnitude 9 earthquake, the most powerful in recorded history, would indeed be powerful enough to feel on the East Coast. That alone should have leveled San Francisco, and toppled buildings hundreds of miles away. Why even suggest an earthquake of that magnitude and then portray something far less dramatic? The resulting tsunami would have brought the force of billions of tons of water, bearing down on the entire West Coast, not to mention much of the Pacific Rim. Any buildings in San Francisco that weren't toppled by the earthquake itself should have been leveled by the tsunami. San Andreas made it look like Godzilla let his bathtub overflow. The streets of San Francicso flood with water but so what? The weight of a wall of water as tall as the tallest buildings would have crushed everything in its path. Not a single building or person should have been left standing.
All of that might have been overlooked if there were a decent underlying plot. Instead we have a main character, someone whose job it is to rescue people, who spends the entire movie rescuing his own dysfunctional family. How many people did he allow to die, simply because he selfishly performed rescue after impossible rescue of those he'd previously driven from his life? No one would want to be in that situation, but when you take a job that involves saving lives, your responsibility is to the greater good and that often means your family becomes secondary. Doctors, nurses, police officers, firefighters and countless others take on that kind of responsibility every day and under far less harrowing circumstances. Frankly, the two Brittish boys were the only likable characters in the entire movie.
San Andreas was certainly memorable, but only because it was awful. Like a case of food poisoning, it's a movie I really wish I could forget.",1450828800,,3222,4.817689530685921

CGI is awesome...by that I mean it is done so well you don't realize it is CGI. Effects follow seemingly real physics so the eye sees what it expects to see. It all blends very well and nothing seems phony effects-wise. I can be a hard critic of CGI heavy movies (i.e. Man of Steel, Star Trek Into Darkness) that are weighed down by too much 'look what we can do' effects and fake physics. San Andreas gets it perfect.

The story is cheesy but that kinda adds to the fun. Johnson proves he can actually act in this one; He's come a long way since The Scorpion King where he was just plain bad. Johnson also has a magnetic and easy-going charm that the camera captures perfectly. Alexandra Daddario is also quite good as his daughter and presents a strong female character (total eye candy too -- opening bikini shot...very nice).

The picture quality is excellent,although the color timing seems intentionally skewed a bit towards the brown. Sound is very good with ample low frequency rumbles at appropriate moments.

7173169,5,B00XLX0Z62,"I was certain that I had outgrown movies that were heavy on CGI, but San Andreas showed me that it's not that I'm too old, it's just that too few movies use CGI properly.  San Andreas is a movie that would succeed or fail by CGI.  You aren't watching the movie to see the Rock and Pauly Shore's love interest in ""Son in Law"" work out their estranged relationship while trying to rescue their daughter... who I'm pretty sure is pushing 30, which means this child was conceived when he and the child's mother were around 13 or 14 years old.  THAT probably deserved a bit more discussion, but you know.... ""willing suspension of disbelief"" and all that.

But that silliness notwithstanding, San Andreas takes you there.  You feel like you are right in the middle of the end of the world, earthquake-style.  Once the ride starts, it doesn't stop until the closing credits and I lost myself in the chaos.  It's big, it's noisy, it's stressful, it's over-the-top pure movie fun.

If you are a 'precision' movie watcher, you may be a little annoyed because this movie has more than it's fair share of continuity, logic, and science glitches... minor stuff really.  Guy starts truck by hotwiring it (not possible with today's column locks and security wiring) and then shuts it off later with a key.  You probably won't even notice them.  Dwayne kind of grew on me, I was somewhat expecting him to be a little bit strong and not so intelligent.  Actually a pretty good actor, I'll be watching for his other work.

Oooooh, and his tsunami jumping jet boat? This guy gets all the breaks....over and over and over.

7173441,5,B00XLX0Z62,"I just finished watching this incredibly well made movie.  I immediately signed on to buy it.  I'd watched a regular DVD from my local library and am ordering it on blue-ray.  I'll have to write a separate review for the new 70 inch 4K Ultra HD Vizio smart TV I purchased 4 days ago on Black Friday.  But,,, Wow!! its amazing how good a regular DVD looks when played on the Samsung 3-D blue-ray player, how much better it will be when I buy and receive the actual blue-ray DVD, I will have to wait to see, and I'm sure I'll wait till after Christmas at least since I just watched it.  But now let's talk about the movie itself.  I am once again amazed at how critical so many people's reviews are as they bash the movie, totally un-deserved!!  The movie was one of the best for many reasons. Acting was spot on, perfectly realistic every second. Dwayne Johnson was so impressive I never knew he could be this good, He's now moved up several notches with me after this movie, excellent work Dwayne!  and all the supporting actors were excellent too.  This movie is 1000 times better than 10.5 which is nothing special at all compared to this gem.  I have to say this is the best for special effects over every disaster movie I've ever seen.  I thought 2012 was underated for it's effects but this was 10 times better than that movie.  I don't care if you buy it, rent it of go to your local library if they have DVD's like mine does, but just WATCH IT!!!!  And see for yourself.",1449014400,,1477,4.307971014492754

7173469,2,B00XLX0Z62,"First off definitely and entertain movie. High action, great soundtrack and that feel good experience at the end. Acting was OK, and it was slightly predictable. The CGI was excellent, the tension was there throughout, problem for me was the movie had no substance, and as another reviewer already mentioned, The Rocks character, took way too many chances on his own without any direction from base, he selfishly stole the chopper to save his own family disregarding the hundreds of other people that needed help. This is an insult to the Rescue people that really do put their lives on the line when something like this happens.
Rescue people do not take advantage like this. Although we are all human and may think about doing things like this, I don't see how The rocks character can sleep at night knowing the oath he took and then disregarding it for his own selfish wants.
Right I know...its only a movie...sure the action and CGI was fantastic but it fell short because of the self centered and selfish arrogance of his character. With all the pain in the world today with terrorist threats and of course natural disasters, we all do need a pick-me-up, but Hollywood, don't surrender the morals that made this country great just to make a few bucks.

7173480,1,B00XLX0Z62,This movie is complete drivel. Predictable plot. Bad acting everywhere. Special effects are nice but not even good enough to warrant more than one star. If you're in the mood for a mindless action movie this is for you but as a piece of work this is subpar even for transformers level type of blockbusters.,1448668800,,306,4.581818181818182

While some parts were completely unrealistic (the types of things that make you go ""yeah, right, there's no way"") I found that I enjoyed this movie and was sucked in to see how it ended. I would never buy it, but would watch it someday if it were to be on TV. We watched it for a date night and my husband really liked it too.",1448668800,,446,4.079545454545454

7173488,4,B00XLX0Z62,"So...if you are able to suspend your disbelief, then you will definitely enjoy this movie. It doesnt take itself too seriously, and that is good, because some of the stuff that happens would make you dislike this movie if they did. However, they know they made something completely unrealistic, and so those crazy scenes work accordingly.

The visuals are what you would expect. Immense, often breathtaking, sometimes terrifying.
The story...well, it is what it is.
The actors all did well with the matter at hand, and you really cant help but like The Rock and the rest of the cast.

I would say I loved the movie - but it was fairly predictable. Nothing horrible or bad in here - just standard Hollywood fare.

7173641,3,B00XLX0Z62,"I really enjoyed this film even though it definitely had its flaws.

I like the Rock he always seem really nice and seems to have a great personality as well especially in interviews.

I don't think he's a horrible actor it's just that with certain parts it's more difficult for him to get to those points.

I enjoyed his character in this movie however the emotional parts where he was trying to cry were very awkward to watch.

I also found a few of the characters more suited for a Lifetime movie like the young British kid for me he was kinda obnoxious at times.

The special effects were pretty impressive except the parts that looked cgied to death.

The attempts at drama for the most part I found really corny and funny for the most part.

One part near the end involving drowning for example that was funny and illogical to say the least...both parts of this specific scene.

The movie also didn't have nowhere near as many characters to follow as they normally do in disaster movies.

So the movie stretches the drama (comedy) , the special effects and the pretty boring science mumbo jumbo.

I like Paul Giamatti he's always been a great actor and he did a good job for the most part.

Except when he also got dramatic at one point he even says God help you all or something along those lines and that saying is one of the biggest cliches of a disaster movie.

There is always some character that makes the destruction or what's still yet to come seem even more cataclysmic then it actually is or will be.

Yeah the special effects were cool, it was humorous in parts, they had the also cliche guy that seemed decent only to turn out to be a coward when the going got rough , the science mumbo jumbo, and the cliche ending I won't ruin.

Was it a good movie ? That's subjective up to each person's perspective of movies like this.

I've seen so many disaster movies I can't even keep track of them all from Independence Day to Dantes Peak to Day After Tommorrow to Volcano to so many others.

So it was a good movie...to me anyways but I wouldn't say a GREAT movie it definitely had its flaws but overall I enjoyed it and for me personally that's all that matters.",1448150400,,2175,4.373134328358209

It's not unusual to see lower California experience dieaster, but this one has new twists all over the place.  The music is great, the acting is great, and the ending is not soupy like so many other disaster movies who put the world on hold to rescue someone's wife/daughter/son/whatever.  For once the teenage daughter is not whining about not getting bars on her cellphone and falling down a lot, the father is not a macho jerk, and the mom is not a helpless bitch who ignores everyone exept her own circle.  All in all, a very well done disaster movie, and (let's face it) it's satisfying to see Los Angeles get  hammered.  Sort of mythic, sort of payback for hubris, and a good metaphor, all in all.  [We really love you, LA.]  The only drawback to this version is all the previews at the beginning of the DVD, but what the heck, that's why it's not $30, right?

case are definitely Oscar-worthy. What this move lacks is the star-power of those
older blockbusters. Dwayne Johnson does well enough in his role, though I prefer
his comedy roles, but behind him, the actors are pretty cardboard.

The movie could have been four or five stars if they didn't always put impossible feats within the movie. But for those that don't mind the nearly impossible, I could see them rating this higher because it is full of action good special effects and a cast worth watching. Its like when he pulled the helicopter down to the skyscraper to pick up his ex wife, there was no reason for him to fly to a different spot where the building is collapsing for her to make a miraculous leap to the copter. I would have enjoyed the movie more had she just walked up to the parapet and boarded the helicopter just one of a couple overdone parts of the movie to make it more exciting and the producers mind I'm sure.",1448064000,,810,4.198717948717949

Then, I can't see them getting together again even due to the disasters so that theme was disappointing. Not real world stuff I think. Daughter wasn't much. The two English brothers were more believable.",1447718400,,592,4.542056074766355

As a thriller, the roller coaster ride from riveting scene to riveting scene was exhausting. After all that, in the end, the emotional release is strong and left me feeling this was one movie that was well-worth the $14.99 inflated Amazon price. I recommend it quite highly.",1447545600,,424,4.808219178082192

7173959,3,B00XLX0Z62,It's a family action movie from Disney with Dwayne Johnson. There are incredible unbelievable things that happen that made me laugh and then the family falling apart and brought back together by disaster storyline. It was entertaining and I sat through the entire movie without getting bored and will probably watch it again at some point.,1447545600,,339,5.071428571428571

And that's saying a lot, considering I love the natural disaster genre, to be bad for this type of film pretty much means it should have been on FX and not in the theaters, bad script, bad acting --- This was more about his personal life, who cares - we want to see a rescue pilot in a natural disaster film saving the public, the earthquake in this movie was the backdrop to a poorly conceived, no one gives a hoot family drama ---which missed the mark by a long shot.

7173990,5,B00XLX0Z62,"Best special effects of any film to date.  First film I have seen with Dwayne Johnson, a very good performance and an excellent on screen 'connection' with the fine actress that plays his wife.  Great disaster film, action starts at once - right after the main title!  Really gives you your money's worth, I bought the 2 disc version with lots of great 'extra's'  I first saw this at a theater in NYC - it was amazing to watch the audience hold on to the arms of the theater seats as though they were on a 'Coney Island' roller coaster!  I read a few ""scientific"" reviews that said a 9.6 earthquake could not happen, one said the max is an 8.5 the other said it could only be a 9.2 -  No one seems to know, I looked on line and saw that
the fault DOES go into the S.F. bay - so I guess there could be a tidal wave (another thing they deny).  Let's remember two things - this is a science fiction disaster movie - not a Discovery Channel Documentary of facts.  Finally as mentioned in the film...""scientists don't know everything""
Just enjoy the film, I recommend it.",1447372800,,1066,4.268656716417911

7174088,4,B00XLX0Z62,"Theres nothing I love more than a good disaster flick.  However, this isn't one of them.  While the spectacle of so much destruction is awesome in scope, the story leaves a lot to be desired.  The sheer number of movies Ive seen with this very same family dynamic is ludicrous.  Stop me if youve heard this before.  Dwayne Johnson plays Chief Ray whos in the midst of a divorce.  His ex-wife-to-be (Carla Gugino) is about to shack up with an architect (Ioan Gruffudd).  They have one remaining daughter, another one drowned.  GUILT drove the married couple apart.  They join forces when their one remaining daughter is lost in the quake.  The number of times they stall the action so they can belabor the dead daughter situation is tedious.  They already had plenty of action going for them; why dredge up some stale melodrama to go with it?  And poor Paul Giamatti is stuck on the sidelines playing a Caltech seismologist who suspects impending DOOM.  Its a thankless role.  At least Art Parkinson was fun as Ollie.
Still.  When they allowed the action to consume the screen, they had a hit on their hands.  Pity some actors got in the way of that.

The song they should have played during the closing credits was Cass Elliots California Earthquake, not Sia singing California Dreamin.",1447200000,,1286,4.7207207207207205

The special effects are good, if anything, the scenes with the quake were very intense, perhaps too intense for the PG13 rating (no blood, but lots of people dying).

I'm sure the taxpayers who funded his little trip were not happy to be abandoned while he went on his personal quest.  Left him as less of a hero to me when he ignored the immediate need of the people around him.  If he hadn't been a public servant I could have got behind him.

Does it get her killed? No. She listens to loud music while driving along a narrow, rickety mountain road? Does it get her killed? No. But wait, there's more. You forgot THE ROCKS!!! Yup, just in the nick o' time, a bungee load of rocks cuts loose from the rickety mountain roadside. This takes the girl on a Alice in Wonderland-esque trip down the mountainside where her car tips upside down, sideways, etc. Etc. Etc. And it goes on from there. The effects are solid, the dialogue is ok and, if you know what to look for, the plot points are telegraphed a mile away. It's not bad, for 1.99$, from Amazon. Suppose all the actors got paid and it did basic box office.

7174376,3,B00XLX0Z62,"San Andreas has great special effects and realistic looking scenery when it comes to the disaster part of the story, although I am not sure I buy the skyscrapers crumbling so easily in an earthquake.  In a lot of ways, this movie is about what you expect in a typical disaster thriller.  The story here though is pretty lackluster and a bit nonsensical at times with our hero flying around in a rescue helicopter that no one seems to mind that he is using for his own personal rescues, among other things that seem a little silly.  But of course, this is a movie that to enjoy you have to suspend belief a bit and just eat the popcorn and watch.  It seems to me that this summer has been a series of formulaic movies and this is another of those.  Its formulaic, predictable storyline is nothing special but the special effects keep the movie moving along that is entertaining enough to spend a forgettable two hours.

7174437,3,B00XLX0Z62,"This is a movie about a LA fire department rescue leader who has to save members of his family during a massive earthquake event that destroys both Los Angeles and San Francisco. The disaster and rescue scenes provide a lot of action excitement. There are also a couple of romantic storylines involving the main character's ex-wife and his daughter. The plot follows a fairly standard formula in which the kid gets separated from her parents who desperately struggle to find and save her. Along the way there are many last-second escapes and close calls. Many of the characters in the movie are likable and you want to root for them to be safe. The special effects are well-done and fun to watch. Unfortunately, most of what happens in the movie is quite implausible. A large portion of the disasters could not happen in real life. They conflate events that could only happen around other types of faults with the famous San Andreas fault. A number of the details of the rescue attempts seem to stretch credibility also. If you are willing to suspend disbelief and accept some of these things for the sake of entertainment, this is a fairly enjoyable film. In some respects, it is similar to the movie 2012. The disaster and action sequences take up so much of the film that there isn't much room for extensive character development or follow through for some of the secondary story lines. This leaves you feeling like there could have been just a bit more to the film. Even so, this is still an entertaining movie and worth checking out if you like disaster films.",1446854400,,1565,4.694545454545454

San Andreas is semi entertaining I suppose, but it is not very believable at all in more than a few areas. Only in a movie kinda thing. For me, I didn't care for all the cheesy jokes, reminiscing, and romance in this, it just doesn't fit when you're in the midst of a major life or death type disaster. If you've seen the day after tomorrow and 2012, this film is very similar. The tsunami scene will make you think you're watching the perfect storm again. Two stars",1446854400,,554,4.4411764705882355

7174491,4,B00XLX0Z62,"Suspend logic and rational thought. Accept that the pedestrian script will be delivered with one-dimensional acting. The characters are watered-down stereotypes. They don't even facetiously try to hide the predictability of the script. There is a 'George Lucas' thing going on where they took great actors and made it look like this was their first film. You will doze off during the 'quiet' part of the film where there is actual plot because by that point you don't care and just want to return to seeing things destroyed. They will tease you with just enough 'science' that you might go to Wikipedia or YouTube to learn more about earthquakes - which in real life, are one of the scariest events you can experience (personal experience).

You will show reverence for the less than 5m Kylie 'sent from heaven' Minogue in on screen and every single time Paul 'breathtaking' Giamatti is on screen.

Opening Scene - that's what you get for texting and driving.

Now, the good stuff. The CGI is AMAZING... and you will crave more, even though you know it's expensive. This film delivers on ALL fronts where CGI and destruction are concerned. Like - over-the-top scenarios. And you will eat it up and want more. That 'one' character you don't like, totally gets what they deserve and it satisfies.

This movie is for the eyes, not the brain - thus, the main characters are attractive and by the end of the film look like nothing really happened to them. As is with most action films.",1446768000,6,1480,4.747081712062257

7174563,2,B00XLX0Z62,"the people who made this movie are probably not FROM california, as the film is very unrealistic about earthquakes. i'm from los angeles, and i couldn't get past the silly factor to enjoy the film very much.

the amount of damage depicted in los angeles and san francisco in the film was due to an 8.5 quake followed by a 9.6 (largest ever recorded). quakes of about 9 probably can't happen along the san andreas fault, and only happen along a few tectonic plate locations,such as japan and peru/chile.

the amount of damage depicted is more consistent with an 8 point quake, what californians have long called ""the big one."" each 8.1, 8.2, etc. goes up a magnitude of 10. therefore, an 8.0 is 100 times stronger than a 7.0. we got a 7 in Northridge, ca. in the Los Angeles area in the 1990's.

when you get to 9, no building, house, freeway, structure of any kind would be left standing. all roads would be torn up, and there would be huge openings in the earth. a big city would have no cell or landline service, no water, no electricity, no emergency sirens working (they would be destroyed), tens of thousands of fires and most of the population would be dead or dying.

a 9.6 would be about an extinction event for the area. there are 18 million people in los angeles county. i think 95% would die. same in san francisco. there would be no way for emergency personnel from out of the state to go in. all earthquakes have aftershocks right away - the larger the quake the larger the aftershocks, which can do more damage. a quake of 9.6 would easily have aftershocks of about 9, 8.6, 8.1, 7.6 ...within the first hour.  large to moderate earthquake aftershocks would continue for days (smaller for weeks). there would be no way to get people/vehicles in, and where would helicopters land - and for how long with everything on fire?

there is a scene where someone warns people to get out of san francisco on tv. no one would have electricity to see tv. most people would be dead. you cannot evacuate cities with as many people as san francisco in hours or a day, and there wouldn't be enough emergency personnel alive and uninjured enough to control and guide people out. there would be mass panic and traffic jams and violence if you could declare an evacuation before an earthquake hit. some people don't have vehicles and have to rely on public transportation. a mass evacuation would take days without a disaster already - days of everything working, every cop/firefighter/paramedic/bus driver, etc., tv, internet and radio working together to give instructions and reduce the chaos and violence.

also, helicopters create some wind with their blades. the scene at the start where a car goes off a road (looks like angeles crest) and flips over and over before getting stuck isn't possible. i've had the misfortune to flip a car upside one time. all the weight of the car comes down on the roof. only the pillars between the windows hold up the roof and keep it from completely collapsing on you. the heavier the car, the more weight comes down on that roof. once or twice may not collapse the roof enough to kill you, but many times? that's silly. the car's roof in the film wasn't collapsed at all - and it isn't a volvo.

there are, however, many canyon roads in los angeles county with big drop offs, like malibu canyon which was used for the scene in the original movie ""the postman always rings twice"" with lana turner and burt lancaster where they try to kill her drunk husband by dropping the car over the side of the road. people drive awful fast along malibu canyon road - no sense. i hated driving on it and took alternates like topanga canyon road (where they drive fast, but you don't have an edge off the road to fall down).

then, the car wasn't at all affected by the wind created by the helicopter. i thought that alone might cause the precarious hold to let go.

i love special effects and stunts in films. this film just departs from reality too much.",1446681600,,3978,4.543296089385475

Then there's a really boring, contrived sub plot about two people reconciling a marriage, wedged between ridiculously over the top destruction scenes, jumping out of airplanes, fires, floods, etc. The dialog was so drearily bad, with the most base level cliches and character archetypes, that you wonder why they bothered to attempt any depth at all. You don't care about the characters, in fact you kind of wish the droll dialog was suddenly interrupted by a crumbling building instantly squashing them, or a sea monster emerging from the sea and breathing fire on them, or discovering that the earthquake was caused by alien invaders, because any of those scenarios would have been just as credible and would  have been hilarious.",1446508800,3,935,4.949044585987261

Buildings fall down and explode AROUND them, as they are somehow untouched.  Every rescue is at the last possible second, people rise from the dead, etc. And the Rock and his wife get back together.

Being in CA during 2 earthquakes leads me to believe that they shake & roll, but not as was portrayed in this movie. As far as the Fault, it wouldn't create a that deep fissure since the plates rub against each other & would push both up & downward.

One example: they made this huge deal about ""getting the word out"" that another quake was coming that was even worse than the first one and warned the people to get out of SF. That's really cool except the first quake had already struck and there was no electricity, no cell service, and no way for the people to get a warning about a second quake. Plus, the roads were destroyed. So all of the greater bay area was supposed to walk out of the danger zone despite having no idea that a warning had been issued. Really stupid movie.

The action is solid, and the visuals hold up through most of the film (though that boat sequence through the city...well, you could tell the animators were flat out bored at that point...)  Unfortunately, that's about all you can say for the movie, as the lazy writers reached for every standard been-there-done-that-way-too-many-times situation.  Carla Gugino has an amazing performance when her daughter is dying...but it's totally ruined by the fact that as you watch her committed acting, it's more than obvious that the kid's going to come back without a single lost brain cell.

7174997,5,B00XLX0Z62,"This movie was much better than I expected. It was very entertaining. Of course, liberties were taken on the technical level; but really, what did you expect. This is Hollywood and they need to make it exciting. I've been designing buildings in California for earthquakes for 40+ years and even worked with the LA Co Urban Search and Rescue teams. Sure things were exaggerated, but it wasn't as far fetched as I thought it might have been and it was done tastefully for entertainment. That needs to be kept in mind. In the real event, the main suffering will be after the event during the recovery period. People in California, especially the leadership will likely be overwhelmed and dreadfully, inadequately prepared. This film didn't show that part of it, but it wasn't intended to be a training film. Relief and recovery will be incredibly complicated and take a significant period of time. Regardless, I recommend it to people.",1446163200,,932,4.905063291139241

7175001,3,B00XLX0Z62,"The whole time you're watching this you're thinking, isn't Dwayne Johnson supposed to be a rescue pilot?  Yet he's ignoring thousands of people in obvious immediate need of help. simply to try to initially, what stay in the good books so he can potentially rehook up with his ex wife who has met another man, by picking her up in his helicopter (which isn't his it belongs to rescue agency and is kind of a... needed), so he can comfort her after she experienced an earthquake.  Then of course his daughter at the other end of California needs her daddy so like those selfish parents who hears their kid scraped their knee and get in their car and runs through stop signs and red lights, weaves through traffic and risks countless lives to unnecessarily be by their side.  You could understand if he's that type of selfish parent when he thinks she's trapped but he still continues to go there after she has rung him and told him she's safe.  Surely at that stage at least he should have said, ""so relieved to hear that baby, you know I've taught you what to do in emergencies, first aid and stuff, do me proud and help those injured around you, help out some distressed kids whose parents have been killed from not getting taken advantage of by predators and direct those around you to help.  Meanwhile there's plenty of people below me who clearly need my help.""  Yet he doesn't do this and she as well steals stuff from a firetruck that although no longer maybe mobile, is still likely needed by rescue personnel, I mean there were cops still active on the job just behind her.  I'm surprised she wasn't shot for looting, both then and when she broke into the phone store.  There didn't seem to be any looting in the big cities, yet in Bakersfield there is.

The buildings falling down and other disaster footage was granted impressive to watch, although it seemed to stick to being young child viewer friendly.  We don't see anyone jumping out of the windows of burning high rise buildings like we did on September 11 for example. Nor really any blood or burnt, disfigured corpses. Every building seemed to fall down as well, older ones probably would sure, but surely some recent decade ones are built for the strongest possible earthquakes?

Watching it as a pure Sharknado realism disaster film, it is entertaining enough.  But perhaps Johnson should have been a tourist sightseeing helicopter pilot and not a senior fire and rescue type professional who was really quite a disgrace to the uniform, not to mention the taxpayers who paid his wage and lost their lives. I imagine in the days after he was charged with theft or vital rescue equipment during a disaster, treason or whatever you call abandoning your post and likely sentenced to be shot.",1446163200,,2756,4.648148148148148

I really like Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, but I believe he needs to play an all or nothing type of hero. I don't like action movies where the main character does everything without instructions and nothing will stop then from doing anything except notice the little things and have them be pointed out to them.  That drives me crazy and the entire movie is like that.  As far as a disaster movie this was just fair.  I still like 2012 better.

7175244,3,B00XLX0Z62,"This is cookie-cutter filmmaking, a movie remarkably dull and bland in its execution. There is nothing so outrageously bad or offensive, yet nothing exciting or memorable either. It is a prime example of when Hollywood goes to work to manufacture a very safe blockbuster over creating any sort of art.

The viewer can feel every whim of the focus-test masses being serviced in one of the most predictable stories ever made. There is hardly a single beat or surprise in either character or plot throughout the film. Despite its promising intro that alludes to a sort of darkly comedic horror film, the rest is completely paint-by-numbers in the simple story of a man saving his family. Of course in these modern times, the hero must be tortured and grim, so an odd backstory is invented that actually toes the lines of darkness and taste in this otherwise family-friendly fare.

While the special effects are solid, they are used sparingly and are unoriginal. The film is caught in a conundrum where it wants to gleefully destroy everything, yet must also refrain from showing any actual human casualties to be a sanitized and kid-friendly film. So the entire spectacle is neutered by its PG-13.

The average viewer has seen this type of disaster film repeatedly by now, and this one hews to the lower end of the spectrum via its simplicity, blandness and uninspired destruction.",1445904000,,1378,4.905579399141631

7175408,3,B00XLX0Z62,"A lot of things about this picture were just an insult to the intelligence of anybody with even a low to moderate knowledge of physics, geology and aviation and marine engineering. Add to that the fact that I am a survivor of the 1964 Good Friday quake in Alaska and I have some facts to correct in the movie.

First, Paul Giamatti's character tells his students that the 1964 quake was a 9.1, and that it hit Anchorage, Alaska.

In truth, the quake's first magnitude report has it at 8.9, and then when they re-evaluated it using modern seismic data, it was revised to  9.2 on the Richter scale.(http://www.greatlandofalaska.com/reference/GoodFridayQuake.html)

Not Paul Giamatti's fault, but whoever wrote the script failed to fact-check. Also, the 1964 Good Friday quake's epicenter was not Anchorage, but Valdez, Alaska, and while parts of Anchorage were absolutely demolished, Valdez got far worse. In fact, the entire city of Valdez had the be moved miles inland because the subduction fault lowered the entire area by as much as 30 feet, and Valdez's significant economic feature was it's port.

Now, about the action sequences: The tip-the-hat helicopter stunt was pure nonsense. No rescue chopper pilot would *ever* run such a risk, not with the lives of his crew on the line. Certainly not with the additional lives of the film crew on board. Those choppers have ample amounts of rope, and they could easily have lowered a man down much farther with the chopper hovering safely high above.

Secondly, helicopters in such tight surroundings would not be able to maintain flight because the supply of air the blades would have would be choked off by the narrow canyon characteristics and the instant one chopper blade made contact with anything solid that chopper would have rotated and crashed immediately.

Next were the overblown effects in downtown Los Angeles. The high rises of L.A. are not nearly as fragile as portrayed, and the notion that a quake would cause a domino effect of high rises knocking each other down is far-fetched.

Next, the notion that an L.A. Rescue chopper pilot could commandeer his own chopper, rescue his estranged wife and then proceed to fly toward San Francisco is 1- An insult to fireman, who would serve the people of their community instead of putting the lives of Angelinos beneath the lives of his wife and kid.

2- The dust and debris around the chopper as Duane Johnson's character rescued his wife would have choked off the air filters on his turbine engine very shortly thereafter.

Thirdly his crash-landing into a Shopping center would have produce immediate fire and explosion. The viewer is essentially asked to pretend to have a 1st-grade mindset to accept the flawed sequences in this movie.

And then comes the theft of an already hot wired truck, then the theft of an airplane, then the theft of a boat from the San Francisco Harbor, the impossible ""climbing"" of the tsunami wave, only to almost be chopped up in the spinning prop of a mega-barge cargo ship, then to ride the wave over the Golden Gate, and essentially surf into Downtown Frisco, and then navigate the floodwaters jammed with debris was ludicrous. With all that debris in the water, the prop would certainly have been damaged or it's shear pin would have snapped(if it were a prop assembly). If it were a jet-drive, the intake on the turbine would have clogged with debris and th would have lost the ability to race through the water.

The visual effects were high definition, but it's been done so many times before that it loses me.

However a few redeeming qualities were: the girl that played Duane Johnson's daughter was gorgeous, and her role of a smart kid of a competent firefighter was fun. And her mom was pretty hot too.

Aside from all of that, it was fun to watch, as long as you agreed to suspend your inner critic.",1445731200,51,3855,4.821212121212121

Had your typical storyline of disaster movies where you really get to know families in depth and their personal struggles with life.

It's supposed to be about the disaster itself and how everyone survives and/or doesn't survive.  Unlike a lot of critics out there, I think there was enough of a personal story written into this plot for San Andreas to allow human emotions and characters to evolve.  I would have liked to have seen even more character development, but honestly, there was enough. It was a disaster/action movie, not a romance.  As far as the disaster theme goes, they hit the nail on the head.  Could it have had more content for the human element?  Sure, always, but I think it's fine the way it is.  I think it was cast beautifully;  I wouldn't have changed any of that.

7175519,3,B00XLX0Z62,"The special effects were great! Very well done. The dialogue had at least three instances of where screenwriter Carlton Cuse plagiarized from other screenplays. One of them was when the news reporter asked the geologist, ""Who do we tell now about the big 9.0 earthquake that's going to happen within a day or two?"" The geologist pauses and says, ""Everybody."" That was stolen from the movie ""Contact"" where Jodie Foster's character say the exact same thing with the exact same timing when one of her fellow scientists says, ""Who do we tell now about the signal from outer space?"" Another copied dialogue moment (more like a scene) was near the end when the Rock's character is trying to revive his drowned daughter. After repeated attempts at mouth-to-mouth and CPR, he gives up. She's dead. After a pause, he aggressively again starts performing mouth-to-mouth and CPR. This was copied from the the movie ""Abyss"" where the main character attempts to revive his ex-wife Lindsay after she drowned. There were a couple more instances where Cuse blatantly plagiarizes from other screenplays. You can find them for yourself.

The plot was predictable and had some holes in it. For example, there is NO way any earthquake on the San Andreas Fault could cause a massive tsunami as shown in this movie. There were many other holes in the plot.

It was an enjoyable movie if you can tolerate the plot holes, plagiarized dialogue and scenes from other movies, and the Rock's deadpan delivery of most of his lines.",1445644800,,1503,4.890196078431373

Oh, and the villanous man who abandons one of the protagonists getting his comeuppance at the hands of the natural progression of disaster. Luckily the number of one liners could be counted on your hands, but there was alot of basic comic relief that could have been done away with. Dwayne Johnson's acting wasn't always spot on.

7175588,2,B00XLX0Z62,"Oh, boy. I hate rating movies this low because I feel like I should come up with a way it could have been better. But this movie is just a cookie cutter version of so many previous that I even knew better than to expect different. What's worse, it seems a minimum amount of time and money was allocated to special effects and CG. By today's standards in the movie industry this movie had calamity scenes that looked cartoon-like at times, and just plain underdeveloped at times. That's not to say there wasn't good CG, there was, but they only made the bad ones really stand out I guess.
The acting was good and is what makes this movie achieve anything that it does deserve merit-wise. I liked all the actors and like watching them ply their craft. Some scenes were very believable and well edited.
Now, on the ""could this really happen"" front, there were several scenes that have things happening that you just know couldn't really be reality, in anybody's view probably. I try not to be such an egg-head about that, but, come on people. Having vehicles in the sky and on the ground do things that could never really happen, if egregious enough, takes away from the overall effort, I think anyway. Also, just how lucky can a person or persons be at any particular time? How many times consecutively do we normally get super lucky?  Well, at least there isn't a WHOLE lot of that in this movie........ uumm hummmm.

I feel that The movie is somewhat predictable. Throughout the movie I could pretty much tell what was going to happen next ,or what was lurking around the next dark corner. There were really no surprises, twists or suspense. Just the obvious, you would expect to happen, happened. The sequence of events were completely predictable, but the movie was still fun to watch. I never felt the urge to sleep. (LOL).",1445558400,,572,4.663366336633663

7175670,5,B00XLX0Z62,"All the great cliches of a superlative disaster movie: troubled Dad has to patch up his marriage, save his family, and rescue everyone from extreme peril while the world is destroyed all around them. I've been hooked on mayhem at the movies since forever. And this one's got ""The Rock"" as Dad. And takes place on the West Coast of the US, where I actually live. Cool! I know those buildings that just toppled! Whoops, there goes the *** Tower! Look at what happens to *** Street when a wall of mud hits it! Wahoo! What fun!

Ahem. Time to sober up. Yes, horrifyingly, The Big One will happen here, quite possibly in the near future (I believe we're 'way overdue geologically), thousands of real people will die, tens of thousands more will be injured, children will be stranded, looting will be rampant and nothing will ever be the same. And I most sincerely hope we here in California defy all the science and somehow avoid our earth-shaking destiny, despite the tectonic lessons of Banda Aceh, Fukushima Prefecture, Alaska in 1964, San Francisco in 1906 and 1989, Chile in the 1880's, and so many others along our ever-volatile Pacific Ring of Fire.

Disasters happen constantly in this world: earthquakes, fires, floods, plagues, famines, volcanic eruptions, eruptions of human rage. We all need to stock up on food and water, retrofit bridges and masonry, know to run uphill when the ocean suddenly recedes, set up rendezvous plans with our families. Let's do that. Let's give money and time to relief agencies whenever we can, and be grateful for peace and prosperity in our own lives right now. Meanwhile, guilty pleasure or no, I do so enjoy sublimating my terror by watching it all fall apart from the relative safety of my popcorn-littered sofa.",1445558400,,1754,4.804635761589404

7175817,3,B00XLX0Z62,"I enjoyed this movie about as well as I thought I would.  We played a drinking game while watching it and every time the movie did something quite cliche/predictable, we took a shot.  Well, after several shots and only a half hour into the movie we decided to stop.  Overall, this isn't a bad movie but it's certainly forgettable.  If you're looking for an action movie and simply want to turn your brain off for a while, this is definitely a good choice in movies.  One bright point of the movie was the acting, I honestly didn't have a complaint there.  And it was relatively entertaining throughout the entire movie.

I think one of my main issues with the movie is the premise of the movie.  Its about rescue helicopter pilot trying to save his daughter.  At the beginning of a movie, he's freaking using a rescue helicopter as if its his.  So, with everything he did in this movie, it kind of left me wondering how many people died that he could have saved had he not been so focused on simply saving his daughter.",1445558400,,1019,4.43010752688172

Even though I had to suspend reality in some situations, it was easier to do because I truly identified with the characters and was wrapped up in the emotion of it all.  That and the special effects made it an awesome disaster movie.  It was definitely a refreshing improvement on all the crappy disaster movies out there.

One thing that bothered me, though, was the soundtrack.  I had to constantly adjust the volume dependent on what was going on.  With action scenes I had to turn it way down and with dialog scenes I had to turn it way up.  While I'm not sure what the deal was with that, it was quite annoying.",1445558400,,627,4.353448275862069

We tried using all our other apps as well as watching another movie we had on our Amazon and all if them worked well. It was just this movie that kept freezing up and was frustrating to watch. From what I did see, it was a lot of over the top natural destruction. The hoover dam breaking apart, skyscrapers falling, riding a speed boat through a flooded downtown, It was cool for a good action movie.

7176043,3,B00XLX0Z62,"Was not as bad as it could have been.  A little too much over the top special effects made it kind of hard to buy into.  I kept recalling the old ""Earthquake"" disaster movie with Charlton Heston; which this one improved upon in most every respect, but still kind of goofy.  Dwayne Johnson's acting seemed a little stiff, as he seems to have a little trouble transitioning from a tough rescue pilot and a father/husband.  It was entertaining, and almost worth the money to rent it.  I hope someone someday will make a good movie about this subject...probably after the real thing.",1445472000,,579,4.637254901960785

7176045,2,B00XLX0Z62,"It was ok, not scientifically accurate at all... Seriously, nothing that was required to drive the plot could actually happen in real life. I knew the earthquake and tsunami weren't realistic going in, but then they throw all this stuff in your face like ""the leading scientist says this"" and ""this guy who is a leading expert and knows all the stuff there is to know honestly believes this"", when a 5th grader could tell you that earthquakes don't work like that.

And then the love story... why the hell would you apologies to your ex husband for moving in with your boyfriend? It obviously wasn't a very good relationship, in the first place, if she jumped ship that quickly. So why the big deal with trying to make some meaningful story about a failed marriage? Go to marriage counseling or get over it, using on some massive catastrophe to ex machina your relationship is a horrible message.

Even with the basic scientific flaws this could have been a good movie, but when you find yourself saying ""What? No that could not happen, that is not what you are supposed to do, why the hell would you do that?!"" in literally every scene, its not a good movie watching experience.",1445472000,,1179,4.609523809523809

7176317,4,B00XLX0Z62,"""San Andreas"" is great! This is how the story goes: In the aftermath of a massive earthquake in California, a rescue-chopper pilot makes a dangerous journey with his ex-wife across the state in order to rescue his daughter.

The cast led by Dwayne Johnson (as Ray) & Carla Gugino (as Emma) is great. The directing by Brad Peyton is great. The story by Andre Fabrizio & Jeremy Passmore and the screenplay by Carlton Cuse is great.

The music by Andrew Lockington is great. The cinematography by Steve Yedlin is great. The film editing by Bob Ducsay is great. The casting by Deborah Aquila & Tricia Wood is great. The production design by Barry Chusid is great. The costume design by Wendy Chuck is great. The art direction by Michael E. Goldman, Jacinta Leong, Tom Nursey, Matthew Putland & Charlie Revai is great. The set decoration by Lisa Thompson, set dressings by Gillian Butler, Laura Drummond & Zlatko Kasumovic and set designs by Nicholas Dare & Andrew Kattie is great. The special make-up effects designed by Tom Woodruff Jr. is great. The stunts coordinated by Bob Brown, Keith Campbell, Jon Devore, Paul Jennings & Allan Poppleton is great. The special effects coordinated by Leanne Brooks & Joe Pancake and supervised by Brian Cox is great. The visual effects coordinated by Eva Abramycheva, Shelley Andagan, Ann-Marie Blommaert, Sara Bold, Jason Bradford, Philip Cabana, Cj Cole, Jamie Erickson, Suzanne Evans-Booth, Ryan Flick, Megan Galbraith, Simran Khalsa, Shannon Y.F. Lum, Megan McDonald, Kristin Patterson, Mohan Sangeeth & Andrea Schimpl and supervised by Martyn Culpitt, Bryan Grill, Allan Magled, Nordin Rahhali, Katherine Rodtsbrooks, Bruce Woloshyn & Colin and Greg Strause is great.

This is a great action-packed thrill ride that is entertaining, well-made and well-done. Dwayne Johnson is solid as usual as Ray. Brad Peyton has directed a solidly-crafted movie. This is (or was) one of the better movies of the summer season and one of the better action movies of the year (also of the summer, as well, too), so far, as well, too.",1445472000,,2057,5.044117647058823

This is not a ""art film"", (which few make blockbuster money anyway). The kids loved it, (it was intense so not TOO young).  I had my Surround System on, and boy did that ad to the effect.

7176368,1,B00XLX0Z62,"Starts out stupid and gets stupider (starting with the first quake event):
1. Very fake scene of a car stuck on the side of a cliff. The downwash from the copter's blades would have increased the likelihood of car going bye-bye . The whole event was more incredulously laughable than believable.
2. The usual backstory of family issues so stereotypically common in these types of movies. Producers telling writers about demographics and its relation to making loads of audience money.
3. Film industry's stereotypes of scientists continues unabated. Have these writers ever been around anyone with a science background?
4. Continues image stereotype of a tough hero with narcissistic muscle mass and overly tight tees to sell that image to female paying viewers. Must be the only image appropriate for our role model for heroic deeds.
5. Improbabilities abound everywhere as family and friends happen upon one another though out all the havoc. And/or happen to rescue or survive harrowing life ending events.
6. Final scene of our flag unfurling to inspiring music. I guess it means even with a city destroyed and millions dying there is still a reason to still be positive.

7176376,5,B00XLX0Z62,"I went into this with average expectations. I constantly enjoy Dwayne Johnson when he's in family adventure movies, but at the same time, I'm always hesitant if he will deliver, yet he always comes through. I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt from this point on.

'San Andreas' was a fun adventure throughout. If you didn't enjoy this, then you're either cynical, or just don't get the movie. This is a disaster film. We go in for the disasters, with expectations of a sufficient story, with likable characters. This movie more than pulls that off. I won't go into plot points as I don't want to ruin any surprises. I'm very thankful to the filmmakers for not showing everything in the trailers.

PROS
The special effects are astounding. This movie NEEDS to be watched in 3D for the full experience. This is one of those films that need to be experienced. No texting at home, no distractions, just watch it uninterrupted and enjoy the ride. This is hands-down the best disaster film in years.

CONS
The story is fairly predictable. Everyone does a decent acting job with their character archetype. It's almost a little too happy ending for me, but The Rock seems to go for good old family fun, with some morality lessons thrown in; this is perfectly fine.

My eyes did water up for more than a few scenes, and I was on the edge of my seat for most of it. Watch it today in 3D! Recommended.",1445212800,,1393,4.53784860557769

7176389,1,B00XLX0Z62,"Remember the 1970s movie Earthquake with Charleston Heston? I figured this would be an updated version of that. Turns out the original movie was a Mensa-level production compare to this one!

The science is bad, the portrayal of building crumbling like sardine crackers instead of rolling as they should makes no sense, and the Rock spends most of his time as a rescue helicopter pilot rescuing his own family instead of everyone else.

Even people who live in California know not to run outside of a building during a quake; you go into the elevator area or under a desk. But in this movie everyone runs out into falling debris.

Even the Rock seems to be laughing at this; he always as a goofy smile on his face.

Ah well, there's more rich white teen girls for people to rescue . How come no one else gets rescued?  Oh cool, another enormous skyscraper just fell onto a crowd of people walking on the sidewalk. Meanwhile the rock and his sort of ex wife are waxing nostalgic  about their dead daughter who drowned several years ago as they fly in the helicopter over vine yards. Oh no, the Rocks helicopter just broke! He's falling! Luckily he and the wife landed in , yes in, the front door of a sporting goods store where the rock picked up a new shirt cause his old one was covered in fuel.

Oh gun loving Charleston Heston, where are you when we need you?? If you can hear us, send some talking apes to truly finish most of these people off! Oh gawd they are still talking about their drowned daughter ... Cornelius, Zera, come save us!

Ending spoiler alert....

These people are cockroaches. Nothing kills them! The Rock and ex wife have now used a medium sized power boat to go up and over the 200 foot tsunami wave,  the daughter just got smashed in the face by concrete and office windows and lived scratch free until drowning in front of the Rock, who with the lung capacity of an elderly Japanese pearl diving woman, dragged his daughter's carcass out of the water.

Then Mr Helicopter Rescue Guy started CPR and mouth to mouth on his daughter -- hey there Sport, you might want to roll her on her side and get all the water out of her lungs before forcing your manly oxygen into her. Oh, never mind, she came back to life.

Naive young couple has brief, ""chance"" meeting and somehow end up willing to risk life and limb for said strangers and they get together in the end (surprise!). The parents miraculously just happen to find kid on the first try in the end of times.

You don't have a chance to build any sympathy for the main characters - they're not even likable. The dad and the scientist are the only ones who seem to have any common sense, the women always need rescuing and call for help instead of figuring things out on their own, it's incredibly misogynistic.

Beyond that, the characters are selfish, egocentric people who literally come upon and repeatedly ignore everyone else's plight, pain, suffering, and danger, they steal cars and boats and planes, everyone seems to know how to instantly and expertly drive said modes of transportation with no previous experience - to reunite. They are constantly going up when others are going down, north when others are going south - knowing others are going to their doom, they help others only once. Actually, the MAN helps only once while the woman cowers and does as she's told, apparently too stupid to know to do anything.

The visual effects are poor and obviously CG.

7176405,3,B00XLX0Z62,"You don't have to be a seismologist to know that San Andreas is far-fetchedthough an expert will certainly confirm your suspicions.

In this 2015 disaster movie starring Dwayne Johnson, an earthquake caused by a fault no one even knew about completely destroys the Hoover Dam, setting off a chain reaction that leads the San Andreas Fault to shift dramatically. When that happens, all of Los Angeles spectacularly crashes and burnsno spoiler here, youve seen the previewsand all the massive skyscrapers and buildings for many miles topple like dominoes. Then a second quake and a tsunami knock down everything and everyone who thought theyd survivedagain, in spectacular fashion. Were not just talking about L.A., either. The destruction begins in the City of Angels with a 9.1 quake on the Richter scale and spreads across California, with a second major quake to the north registering a 9.6.

The actual San Andreas Fault is nearly 800 miles long and has the potential to cause a disastrous earthquake, but not one above 9.0. Thats because, according to experts, the fault is not long or deep enough. Plus, the level of destruction wouldnt be nearly as massive. Scientists predict a San Andreas earthquake would cause 1800 deaths and 50,000 injuries, with hundreds of old buildings and a few skyscrapers collapsingnothing remotely close to the wholesale destruction we see in the film.

Then again, subtlety has never been a Hollywood trademark. Thinking back to disaster movies of the 70s that started it allfilms like Airport, The Poseidon Adventure, and The Towering InfernoIm struck that at least this time there isn't a woman like Shelley Winters shrieking in panic the entire time. Besides, these are popcorn movies that rely more on story than factuality, and on special effects more than story.

Viewers will recognize two stories combined into one: Godzilla (only this time its nature doing the stomping) and any number of cop dramas where the guy has to rescue his estranged wife and/or daughter. Paul Giamatti SanAndreasscreen2plays the lone scientist trying to warn everyone (really?). So its all pretty familiar, and if you happen to miss the first act you're not missing a lot. We don't learn much about these people except that Ray (Johnson) is a helicopter rescue pilot who served with his team in the military, and his ex-wife Emma (Carla Gugino) is moving in with real-estate developer Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd). Rays not happy about that, but grown-up daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) understands and provides another person for him to worry about when the quake strikes. The only backstory we get is that Ray and Emma had a daughter named Mallory who drowned years earlier, so of course that tsunami proves especially terrifying. Throw in a few British brothers visiting California (Hugo Johnstone-Burt, Art Parkinson) and you get a romantic sideplot and comic relief.

If San Andreas skimps on character and story development its because it goes all-out on the special effects. These are perhaps the coolest and most lavish special effects Ive seen in a disaster movie, and for many viewers that will be enough. But the sight of The Rock in a boat (howd he get that?) navigating through debris that would sheer a cotter pin on most propellers and going RIGHT to a building where he needs to go, or seeing The Rock pilot his helicopter to a building where he knows someone dear to him is on the roof because he told her to head for high ground is so far-fetched that it makes the special effectswell, less special.

San Andreas has its faults but its not a complete disaster. For those who demand logic and some character development it probably merits a C- because it is so implausible, with no development beyond the CGI effects. But if you're a thrill seeker at heart and you live for special effects, youll probably love this film. Certainly the effects are better than average.

The movie is well-paced with a couple interwoven threads. They tried real hard to balance the computer effects with good character development.  The computer generated disaster deserves special mention here.  They didn't economize on the CGI; it's non-stop and well-integrated with the movie, very well-done.  And nothing struck me as technically implausible (other than,perhaps, his magic helicopter)  But as for the 9.6 that destroys San Francisco, it's probably the least far fetch disaster movie to come along in quite a while.",1445040000,,699,5.425925925925926

The ONLY things that this crap was saved by was the studly Dwayne Johnson - he could be filmed just sitting on the toilet and I'd love it (wait - that's not really how I meant that to sound!) At any rate, the story and plot were so incredibly unscientifically sound, anyone who knows the slightest thing about plate tectonics, specifically the N.

If you want to learn about the real thing go read a book on earthquakes or watch Discovery or National Geographic channels. For me it was action packed and the chemistry between the main characters was believable. Also, the acting while it will never win an Oscar, was good.

If you have seen any disaster movie before this one, you would have to be pretty dumb not to be able to predict this whole movie. The story is very basic. To the point, don't watch this if you are looking for a good story. The acting is also quite bland, but i am a Rock fan, 'nuff said...

Ok, i am no pilot but i am sure some of the stunts pulled in a helicopter, is definitely quite impossible. I love action, when it makes you feel it can be done, but when stunts are pulled that are so unbelievable I start to feel that the movie is presuming I'm too stupid.

The only positive i give this movie is the visual effects. The actual event and the after math of the earthquake was stunning.

Over all, it was an ok movie. If you like natural disasters, (which i do), you may enjoy this movie. Definitely a ""Seen one, seen 'em all"" type story.",1444867200,2,911,4.101123595505618

San Andreas is a predictable, cliche'-ridden, and CGI-saturated mess that requires viewers to check their brains at the door in order to accept its far-fetched plot devices. Add to that, the sentimentality is dripping saccharine sweet nonsense that belongs on the Hallmark channel. There were more there's-no-way-in-hell and oh-please moments than you could shake a seismometer at.

That said, the movie flows well, the pre-tsunami CGI provided some good disaster eye candy, and thankfully shake-cam effects were limited or absent altogether. I also liked Paul Giamatti, and Alexandra Daddario - they were both likable and believable. However, I am NOT a fan Carla Gugino. Whether it was the role they piled on her or its her style, she just came off as annoying.

Fortunately the movie got better from there and was visually amazing because much of the dialogue and acting was cheese-ball. Paul Giamatti brought the only consistently good acting in the flick, it felt like taking a big breathe after drowning every time he appeared on the screen. Then of course the rock would show up again and suck you right back under. I think I could watch Alexandra Daddario knitting and still have a good time so there was that too. All in all the movie was fun and entertaining. I enjoyed it despite gagging several times throughout the movie. I think the Rock might have beat me to a pulp afterwards but I still would have slapped him if he were sitting next to me for that line he dropped when they landed in the baseball field, good lord that needed to be left out.

I saw it twice in the theaters, once in 3D with a co-worker and again in regular 70mm with my mother and pre-ordered from Amazon. While I'm a believer that nothing is better than seeing a movie such as this in a theater/big screen, the picture clarity and sound at home is awesome. As a displaced Californian, it always bothered me the scale/addressing of high-rises collapsing never made sense, but it did in this movie. Yes, if AON Tower did collapse in downtown Los Angeles, it would crash between the buildings specified.

Then after cutting to the side and getting over the head of the tsunami, cargo cars start dropping into the water and they weave in and around the falling cargo cars.  I mean come on!  The whole movie was outrageous like this.  The thing is, it didn't need all the preposterous close calls and impossible escapes.  I don't understand why the makers thought they needed all the absurdity because the effects carried the movie anyway.  There were unnecessary characters too.

7176706,4,B00XLX0Z62,"Films such as this are always gong to attract a mixed-bag in terms of review ratings, as with many previous films
of this type of story-line ...Disaster-Movie... it relies very heavily upon the visual content to carry the day.
And yes, the visual-effects are impressive as would you expect, the story-line though often tense is as with films
such as 2012 predictable with a series of unlikely narrow-misses along the way as the world around crumbles.
In this we follow 'Ray' (Dwayne Johnson) a Helicopter-Rescue-Pilot who as the drama unfolds first secures his ex-wife's
safety then together head nearly 400 miles from 'Los Angeles' to 'San Francisco' in response to their daughters plea for
help.
The early warnings for an imminent disaster are signaled when a little-known fault-line fractures in Nevada destroying
the Hoover-Damn..........
When a 9 - plus quake hits the western seaboard causing considerable damage to both L.A and San Francisco seismologist
'Lawrence'(Paul Glamatti) with all the data he's receiving realizes for 'San Francisco' there is much worse yet to come, he has
to find a way to warn those living there.
Meanwhile 'Rays' resourceful daughter 'Emma' (Carla Gugino) has been rescued from her earlier predicament by new found
friends 'Ben' (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and younger brother 'Ollie' (Art Parkinson) together with the faith 'Emma' has in her Dad's
determination to find them, battle the extremes of what is taking place around them in the hope of being rescued.
The Golden Gate Bridge ? .... well we've seen it collapse in so many disaster movies down the years, not giving too much away
if i mention the film does not let the tradition down.
As mentioned earlier, i find films such as this difficult to rate in truth, i love the visual content that is on offer, yet have to say
the story-line is as mentioned earlier = predictable.....however, if like myself you enjoy the special-effects films such as this have
to offer, the film is certainly worth a spin.
(The reality of the subject matter 'The San Andreas Fault-Line' is that the likelihood of 'The Big One' happening is more 'When'
rather than If )

I was disappointed San Andreas came across as a B movie instead of living up to its full potential. The special effects rated a 5. The story line should have matched as well.

Needless to day, if a cataclysmic earthquake occurred on the San Andreas reaching from LA to SF (which devastated every city in between as well); it would take years before any rebuilding took hold.  All the water lines, gas lines, electricity, roads, bridges; well you get the picture...plus there would be bodies bodies everywhere.

From what I have read from geologists, an earthquake of the magnitude depicted could not occur along the San Andreas, though it could occur in Seattle or Portland.
What kills the movie is the human interest story line, which bounces from predictable, to hilarious, to downright stupid.  The contrivances and coincidences outpace anything Charles Dickens ever wrote.

Stupid plot.
This could have been such a great movie even, with all the effects, if they had only stopped, thought about it, and said, ""I know. Let's write a really good script!""
Instead of making it about the real San Andreas fault line, it becomes another life and death story about just one family trying to rescue their little girl. And then they let the computer geeks go nuts with their falling buildings and falling freeways and cars crashing into each other. Not a lick of real science can be had.

I literally was able to predict the lines the characters where going to say, it was that formulaic. No talent went into the writing of this thing, and the CGI looks like CGI. This is TV movie quality at best. I've 0.0 idea why anyone would give this 5 stars, it's quite scary to think this is ""quality"" to many people.

7176752,4,B00XLX0Z62,"San Andreas combines amazingly realistic special effects with a larger-than-life hero and a plot that harks back to the disaster movie craze of the 1970s. Theres action a-plenty  harrowing escapes, buildings collapsing into one other, fire, flood, explosions. Amid the chaos, a small group of individuals try to survive as thousands around them are flattened.

Ray (Dwayne Johnson) is a rescue pilot who isn't afraid to risk his own life to save others. This is established early on when he springs into action to save a young woman whose car goes careening down a mountainside and gets caught precariously against some rocks. Ray doesnt think twice about maneuvering his helicopter into a narrow gorge and lowering himself to the ground while a fellow rescue team member handles the controls. Of course, he pries the woman out moments before the car plummets hundreds of feet.

Meanwhile, Cal Tech Professor Lawrence (Paul Giammati) has predicted that an earthquake of Biblical proportions will occur in California. One is long overdue. Sure enough, the San Andreas fault obligingly rends the state asunder from Los Angeles to San Francisco. Ray has to save wife Emma (Carla Gugino) and daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario). Naturally, he powers through one obstacle after another.

Johnsons natural charisma charms us into accepting the movies unlikely scenarios. Ms. Gugino and Ms. Daddario are on hand to be placed in need of rescue. Of course, Ray is the only person in all of California whos up to the task. Ioan Gruffudd has the thankless role of a Donald Trump-type millionaire builder whose cowardice under pressure contrasts unflatteringly with Rays derring-do.

The characters are standard-issue disaster movie types and much of the plot is predictable. Going on the 3D journey is fun up to a point. The marriage of effects and story is unbalanced. Because the effects are so good, the sub-standard writing is all the more painful. Audiences deserve a sharper script with characters who are more people than plot devices.

Director Brad Peyton makes the mistake of overdoing some of the effects. Though impressive and flawlessly executed, too many are repeated too often, dimming their dramatic impact in an effort to add more and more mass destruction. No one who sees this movie will feel its stingy with pandemonium. You can be sure that most iconic structures along the fault line will meet their doom.

Rated PG-13, San Andreas contains relentless action with just enough plot to serve as backdrop for breathtaking images of a state being ravaged. The movie offers some exceptional aerial images of California under attack by Mother Nature.

Bonus extras on the 3-disc 3D Blu-ray Combo Pack include commentary by director Brad Peyton, deleted scenes, gag reel, stunt reel, and three behind-the-scenes featurettes.",1444521600,,2828,5.18640350877193

7176758,2,B00XLX0Z62,"I love disaster movies. They are usually pretty dumb, but the good ones are great entertainment. Earthquake? Towering Inferno? Twister? The Day After Tomorrow? 2012? Sign me up. So I was eager to watch San Andreas, Hollywood's latest installment of disaster porn.

The plot recipe for these types of films has recently been honed to a dull perfection: take a dysfunctional family; the wife has left her seemingly irresponsible husband out of concern for the children and found comfort, if not true love, with a much richer contender. The sudden threat of global destruction triggers heroic behavior on the husband's part; he regains his wife's love and children's respect. They find redemption in society's smoldering ashes. That's it. That, and spectacular effects.

The trick is to put some kind of spin on this tried and true, but by now somewhat tired, formula. How well the writers do this, along with the quality of the acting and the special effects, determines whether you end up with a successful piece of entertainment, or garbage.

Unfortunately San Andreas' writing never even tries to takes off, the cast is persistently uninspiring - even Paul Giamatti, a fine actor, falls flat - and only one minute, sixty seconds, of the effects are worth watching. A number of the Los Angeles effects are eerily reminiscent of 2012; one has to wonder whether assets or even shots from this film were re-used in San Andreas. But mostly, on the whole, it has all been done, heard and seen too many times before.

The film simply does not measure up even to mediocre disaster flicks of the past. It's too flat, predictable and boring.",1444521600,5,1632,4.9021739130434785
7176759,3,B00XLX0Z62,Excellent special effects but dumb story line. Boat traveling through tsunami waters littered with junk...not gonna happen.  Finding your daughter by chance in a city that just went through multiple disasters in the last hour....not a chance,1444521600,,241,5.513513513513513
7176760,3,B00XLX0Z62,"Great special effects, story that could have been written by a fourth grader.  Some decent little glimmers interest though, in particular some of the rescue techniques employed.  I doubt many EMT's would agree on how the movie treated these incidents, but it was entertaining to watch at least.  I'd rate this a star lower than 2012, which had better end of the world special effects and embraced just going all-out crazy in terms of story.",1444521600,,440,4.84

7176987,3,B00XLX0Z62,"I read a lot of the positive and negative reviews before getting this movie, but decided to get it any way. I am a fan of disaster movies and understand you have to take them with a grain of salt and expect a few outlandish scenarios so I was prepared...I thought.

Even with a grain of salt and knowing a few outlandish scenarios would be included, there is no excuse for a poorly thought out story line. I watched WORLD WAR Z with Brad Pitt and comparing the two movies, I can believe a worldwide zombie apocalypse happening, before I believe a major earthquake would destroy California.

SPOILER ALERT STARTS HERE:

- When Ray and Emma crashed the helicopter it was too convenient that they crashed in the clothing department and even MORE too convenient that they didn't have to look through the racks to find their size (it's not like The Rock can fit any ole size shirt).

- My daughter pointed out that they must be the luckiest people on the planet to be able to just so happen have a helicopter, truck, plane, and boat at their disposal just when they need it. I don't think they walked once during the whole movie. Which takes me to my next point.

- Their luck continues when they just so happen to get the fastest boat, out of all the CGI boats, that can get over the tsunami crest - none of the other boats made it (they could've given a few people some cameo moments in the film by flashing their faces on the screen as they all look at each other once they got over the crest like, ""whew, we made it"").

- While we are on the water let's talk about how lucky, again, Ray and Emma were that didn't get smashed by the barge or any of the 2 ton falling cargo! They even got the top of their boat sheared off and neither one of them got a single scratch. I mean even in WORLD WAR Z Brad Pitt had dirty fingernails.

- Let's get back to Blake and her saviors. As they are walking with all of the other displaced citizens being shepherded by the authorities, they just so happen to come across an abandoned fire truck in their path.
  a) They are able find important tools like an emergency radio (don't you think the fire fighters would have taken that with them)
  b) The authorities didn't try to stop them from taking items from the fire truck
  c) Not one single citizen went over to see what they had or what they may be able to take

- When they get to the electronics store they are able to find a flash light and a laser pointer that work without having to scrounge around for batteries, how convenient!

- I just threw up my hands when Ben got caught in a rain shower of falling glass and not one single itsy bitsy chard of glass hits him except that chunk that struck his leg, which takes me to my next point...

- First, as big as that glass was, it should have totally incapacitated him ESPECIALLY with that uber weak tourniquet Blake put on him. But, noooo he was able to limp through the rest of the movie, piggyback his brother and carry Blake. Stop it...just stop it!!

- So Ray and Emma make it in to downtown in their boat and they work their way through the destruction and debris - none of which interferes with their boat - they just glide right on through. It's like the modern day parting of the red sea only with chunks of sky scraper buildings being in the water.

- I'll end with what other reviewers have said about the casting - Blake, in her current state, was not believable as Ray and Emma's daughter. If Alexandra Daddario was the best actor to play the role of Blake, then she should have had colored contacts in her eyes and preparation for the role should have included getting a sun tan because she was way too pale to be the child of  Dwayne Johnson and Carla Gugino. The other thing casting/producers could have done was to cast the mother with paler skin and light eyes. That would've been believable.

:END OF SPOILER ALERT:

So, as you can see there are just way too many inconsistencies with the story telling to make this more than a mediocre movie. I took so many grains of salt watching this movie that I had to take a diuretic pill by the time it was over.

Others have said the acting was horrible, I don't agree with that. I think they did a decent job. I was especially impressed with Art Parkinson who played Ollie. Paul Giamatti is one of my favorites and he did his role justice.

The CGI was terrific and saved this movie from getting a 1 or 2 star rating from me. Actually I think the CGI people should be pissed off that their hard work was paired with such crappy story telling.

This could have been a world class disaster film if the plot and story telling would have been thoughtfully planned out.",1444176000,,4666,4.288154897494305

7176992,5,B00XLX0Z62,"As a native Californian living in the Bay Area, this movie certainly hit close to home. Both of my sons live in San Francisco (and some of the scenes were filmed on the same street one of my sons live on!), and I certainly worry about them being in the City the next time a high magnitude quake hits.

I was ready for the classic cheesy disaster film and was very surprised that this film surpassed any expectations I might have had. The story line (yes, there really was a story line!) and writing was much better than I expected. Dwayne Johnson showed his chops as a dramatic actor. It was probably the first film I've seen him in where I really cared about his character. Alexandra Daddario as the daughter was excellent. The brief ""romance"" that developed between her character, Blake, and Ben (played by Hugo Johnstone-Burt), made you want to know what ultimately happened to them after the dust settled. The little brother, Ollie (played by Art Parkinson), stole your heart. This kid will be going places in future roles. The one character that you almost cheered for when a cargo liner fell on top of him (Daniel Riddick, played by Ioan Griffud), deserved every hiss and boo for leaving Blake to die in the back seat of a limo.

All in all, the acting was pretty solid, the story line and writing was very good for a disaster film of this magnitude, and for all the artists that worked on the CGI for this film, kudos to all of you! I think the artists are the unsung heroes of this film. The destruction in both LA and San Francisco, and the tsunami in the Bay were done so well that you almost believed it could be real. Well done!

If disaster films are a genre that appeal to you, this one was better than most. I would highly recommend it. Definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat and holding your breath.",1443916800,,1822,4.416666666666667
7176993,5,B00XLX0Z62,This seems like a reboot of the 1974 movie Earthquake based on the similar scenes in  each movie. There was a group who predicted the earthquake in the 74 version. There was a dam the broke. And even some of the buildings that came down looked similar to what at the time was state of the art visual effects in 1974. All in all it was pretty good in my opinion. I see that many people reviewing this movie were complaining about Dwayne Johnsons role in the film. I think the problem for most people is that he has been type cast in most peoples eyes and don't see him in this type of role where he is flying aircraft and saving a daughter. Instead they see  him blowing up stuff and fighting monsters. IF you can get past that type of type casting for the actor youll see that this was a good film.,1443916800,,798,4.141935483870967

 Once it does begin to evolve into the obvious earthquake, the things that happen to the people involved are not as predictable.
The story line throughout the movie is a well written story that is realistic to the time we live in.

All the graphic depictions are incredible. If you don't like the storyline, and don't care for the characters, just watching the special effects is amazing to behold and well worth the wait!

 The information contained in the movie is timely and relevant.
This movie would be a great movie to use for disaster preparedness scenarios because of the complete way it shows what could happen in an earthquake of this magnitude, and how the deployment of the  various resources would have to be deployed to be effective.

In fact, Brad Peytons San Andreas is not as bad as you may be led to believe, as long as you keep watching its charismatic star Dwayne Johnson and eye-popping special effects.

The story is simple. Dwayne Johnson plays a veteran rescue-helicopter pilot, who sets out to save his estranged wife (Carla Gugino) and daughter (Alexandra Daddario) when an enormous earthquake hits the West Coast with disastrous results. The supporting players include Hugo Johnstone-Burt, Ioan Gruffudd, Will Yun Lee, Archie Panjabi, Art Parkinson and Paul Giamatti. Oh, and blink your eyes and you will miss Kylie Minogue.

San Andreas is an awkward mixture of dazzling visuals (of crumbling buildings, huge tsunami and so on) and contrive story. The film focuses the heroic acts of the protagonist and it is certainly thrilling to watch them, but when he emotes about his sad past, things suddenly get boring. Most supporting players have little to do in the story other than to run around and look terrified.

Of course, the CGIs are top-notch and you get plenty of them. Dont expect anything more than that and perhaps you may enjoy San Andreas.",1442793600,2,1299,4.8954545454545455

If you seen any movie released within 5 years from the rock than you haven't seen anything new from him,must throw in the plot of him trying to survive a earthquake and you already prob seen this",1441670400,,412,4.1625
7177120,4,B00XLX0Z62,"I'm sure the San Francisco tourist department appreciates the good lookin' out this movie just gave it. Like, hey, y'all, come to the City by the Bay. Check out the quaint trolleys and the fine architecture and Fishermans Wharf and Nob Hill and the Golden Gate Bridge - but, also, don't forget to drop, cover, and hold on for dear life. SAN ANDREAS preys on every Californian's big fear. According to the onscreen seismologist (Paul Giamatti), 1.3 million earthquakes occur around the globe annually, and that the San Andreas fault - that demarcation between two tectonic plates and which runs up the spine of California - activates in a big way every 150 years. And that it's one hundred years overdue for its next major tantrum.

To set the fretting Rock-heads at ease, this is Dwayne Johnson proving that he's still very much a huge box office draw. SAN ANDREAS is a blockbuster disaster movie. This ain't Merchant Ivory, meaning that this movie bypasses your intellectual bits and targets your lizard brain. It's jaw-dropping spectacle brought about by swagger and CG-heavy effects. The characterization is shallow. Ain't much of a plot; no clever twists. We get those requisite soap opera moments and cheesy lines like ""Now, we rebuild.""

Except that the Rock happens to be the most convincing salesman in today's film industry. It's a given that you wouldn't give two shucks about this movie were the Rock not in it. He sells this movie. He plays Chief Ray Gaines of L.A. Fire Rescue, and we won't discuss how he flat out abandons his post when he was needed most. I can't fault him as I would've done the same in a heartbeat were I to learn that my family's in grave danger. Off go Chief Gaines and his estranged wife (Carla Gugino) to Frisco to rescue their imperiled daughter. Along the way, they'll commandeer this and that vehicle, slug a random looter or two, and brave the wrath of an ungovernable natural disaster.

One notable swerve is that, for a disaster movie, SAN ANDREAS deploys a comparatively modest cast. Normally, these suckers are won't to present an all-star roster, each with their own personal baggage to gum up the works. We instead roll with three story threads, two of which revolve around the Rock's family, the third focusing on the CalTech seismotologists for several rounds of sciency exposition. I harbor no hate for the actors. They all come with good dramatic chops. I've had a longtime crush on Carla Gugino, and I love how she's here playing another strong female character. Alexandra Daddario plays her and the Rock's daughter, and I said there's nary a clever twist, but there is this refreshing turn of presenting this teenager not as a quivering damsel-in-distress but as someone who is capable and resourceful and who decisively takes control of her tiny group of survivors. And I can't fault the logic. It makes sense that the daughter of a helicopter rescue pilot would pick up survival tips from her old man. Hugo Johnstone-Burt plays her companion, a young British engineer. Yeah, he's the obligatory love interest for Daddario, but he generates such an earnest, likable front. What I like best about his character is that he's sensible enough to realize that the girl's got a better grip of the situation than he does.

SAN ANDREAS delivers impressively in its genre. The scope is epic, rife with breathtaking visuals of various landmarks biting the dust. It's sort of humbling, watching these mammoth man-made structures collapse like sissy sand castles or just plain out get obliterated. So, yeah, it's campy. The action is dopey. The dialogue is ridiculous. But the movie's got the Rock, and he demonstrates all over again why star power makes all the difference. I don't care that there never was any real sense of jeopardy when he was onscreen. I just couldn't take my eyes off his intrepid self. I don't even care that the movie daughter, Daddario, doesn't, in any shape or form, resemble the Rock. Yeah, this movie's gotten to my lizard brain, baby!",1441670400,3,4007,4.8452554744525544

Am I the only one that thinks making a car crash in CGI is stupid? It just looks fake. I get not building a life size model of the Titanic just to sink it, but you're telling me that it's better filmmaking to CGI a compact car tumbling down the hill than it is to just drop a real car down the hill? How can this be cost effective? And it looks stupid.

Dwayne Johnson plays the swaggering hero in his loveable, everyman way. The same character he plays in virtually every movie, so at least he's found his niche, right?

Despite the genre being built on extreme suspension of disbelief, this character is over the top heroic. Like comic book super powered big. He jumps from helicopters hovering inches from canyon walls (despite being the pilot, who leaves the cockpit when they are inches from death?), defies death a half dozen times in the first hour (explosions, helicopter crashes, and armed robberies, oh my), and singlehandedly saves his family (but not many other people, despite being an LAFD rescue pilot - even cruising past people literally begging and screaming for help).

The Rock knows how to hot wire cars, rappel down mountains, and he can even fly and talk on the cell phone at the same time (which I think is not only against better judgment but the sort of thing NTSB crash investigators salivate over finding)! He literally does the job of like five people at all times. Why did his wife divorce him? This man is a demigod!

The quake itself is comically large as well, taking all of mid and southern California out. Carla Gugino and Alexandra Daddario are the reason to watch this movie! I'd watch either of these women read the phone book. Heck, they don't even have to read. Just put a camera on them and I'll pay to watch them stand there and do nothing at all.

7177131,4,B00XLX0Z62,"Director: Brad Peyton

Screenwriter: Carlton Cuse

Cast: Dwayne Johnson, Carla Gugino, Paul Giamatti, Alexandra Daddario

I am pleased to say that San Andreas, the new action film from director Brad Peyton (Journey 2: The Mysterious Island) is by far the directors finest work but also a really enjoyable film from start to finish. Many action films struggle to find a niche for themselves given their overabundance at the box office, especially in the disaster genre, but San Andreas manages to deliver for the most part.

Dwayne Johnson plays Ray, a California rescue chopper pilot who knows the ropes. Recently divorced, Ray is trying to pick up the pieces and maintain a strong relationship with his teenage daughter, Blake (Alexandrea Daddario). When Lawrence (Paul Giamatti) a Cal Tech Seismology professor discovers tremors in a new fault line under Nevada that allows him to accurately predict upcoming earthquakes, he realizes that San Francisco is in for an earthquake, the magnitude of which the Earth has never seen before. Now, Ray has to risk it all to rescue his family.

Ill say this once just to get it out of the way and leave it at that. This is not the film from 1996 about the scientists who are trying to invent a way to increase warning systems before a natural disaster hits centralized around a recently divorced protagonist with a tragic past that risks it all to keep his family safe, including his ex-wife. That film was Twister. This is also not the film about a group of heroic men who through strength and determination are able to save various female characters who are depicted as much weaker, until one female character with a masculine name (Jo) proves to be just as tough as the boys. That film was Twister. This is the one from 2015 that has the girl named Blake.  Oh, and did I mention both Jo and Blake spend most of their respective films in tight cotton tank tops?  You know, the ones male action characters often wear with the unfortunate colloquial term, wife-beater.

Ok, snarkiness aside, this is a fun movie. Feminists will cringe at the fairly common occurrence of women getting into trouble and requiring men to save them, in some instances costing the male characters their lives. However, screenwriter Carlton Cuse has tread these waters before. Mostly known for his television writing on shows like Lost, The Strain, and Bates Motel (the latter involving a female character named Bradley), Cuse knows how to thrill, pace, and deliver some thrills. Furthermore, director Brad Peyton creates a spectacular scene of San Franciscos demolition throughout the film. The tension is palpable and tangible regardless of our familiarity with this genre and the formulas that come along with it.

San Andreas is a traditional summer tent pole blockbuster, but as more and more of these types of films are starting to feel stale, this one works. Johnson continues his ascension to being the next Arnold Schwarzenegger, only with more charisma (of course, I am aware that there still is a current Arnold Schwarzenegger, but did you see The Last Stand, Sabotage, or The Expendables 3?). Unoriginality and misogyny do hold the film back slightly and boy oh boy does the final shot reek with clichd patriotism, but I still recommend the film on its merits and believe audiences are smart enough to not find the films shortcomings offensive.

Let me start off by saying what a great job they did with the special effects, awesome job! The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) actually did pretty good. I haven't seen that many of his other movies but I think he did a really good job. He cant cry though, there was more than one scene where it was necessary to at least get his eyes to get all watery, shiny, glimmering and ready to burst into tears, or at last kind of red, but his face was like K (All that was needed was the song ""LIKE A ROCK"" followed by a picture of a Toyota crushing a few rocks)

If you haven't seen this movie, you should, yes some scenarios are cheesy and it gets you to say WTF really? Or noooo! GET OUT OF HERE! But overall its real good. I have to comment on the British guy and his brother, I forgot their names already, they were a good element to this movie. Usually kids are annoying as heck, *cough Jurassic world*, but the little kid was actually kind of cool, in fact he was a wing man! Far from LEGEN.Wait for itDARY but he did good. Dont get me started on Blake! Choooowww! Nice casting director! 10 thumbs up for you! (That's a fake score metric I just created by the way. Overall his was an awesome movie, I enjoyed it!

7177137,4,B00XLX0Z62,"San Andreas follows the story about a rescue chopper pilot named Ray (Dwayne Johnson), who must go on a dangerous journey across California with his ex-wife Emma (Carla Gugino) to find their daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) during a massive earthquake. San Andreas came out on May 29 this year and I did see it during its opening weekend in 3D. San Andreas is one of those movies that you'll either love or hate, considering its genre. For me, San Andreas was a movie I went into hoping for 2 things: A fun experience and an above average story and for the most part, it delivered on both of those things. This was a much more memorable experience than I thought. San Andreas has a relatively dramatic/emotional story going for it and it has well developed characters. Specifically, the three main characters Ray, Emma, and Blake. The CGI used to make the buildings look like they're collapsing do look really nice and it almost makes it look like the buildings are actually being torn apart. The movie isn't perfect though, it is kind of predictable,some of the other characters we see throughout the movie either aren't as well developed or they don't appear as much as the main characters do, and the 3D effects aren't utilized as well as I was expecting it to. Not saying it looks bad, it just won't blow you away. Overall, San Andreas was a fun and memorable movie that I enjoyed quite a bit.

7177139,2,B00XLX0Z62,"Nine Things About the Movie ""San Andreas""

1. This could have been a fun little piece of disaster porn. Too bad it sucks.

2. The movie basically starts with an earthquake scientist team that thinks they can predict earthquakes by using big vocabulary words (this was made up). When they see signals that an earthquake may hit the Hoover Dam, they don't warn anybody. They just go stand on the Hoover Dam and watch it get destroyed.

3. Super fireman/rescue guy Ray (played by Dwayne Johnson) hears about the destruction of the Hoover Dam and is called in to work, but takes the day off to see his daughter before heading to the disaster site.

4. When the San Andreas fault shifts and the earthquake hits Los Angeles, Ray gives most people the actual, real advice to drop to the ground, cover yourself with a table or up against a wall, and hold on. But he tells his ex-wife to run to the top of a skyscraper and wait for him on the roof so he can abandon his job and pick her up in his helicopter. Then Ray talks to his daughter in San Francisco. When she says she's fine, Ray doesn't tell her to evacuate the city with the rest of the people. He tells her to run back into the earthquake zone, climb a tall building, and wait for him on the roof so he can abandon his job again, fly to San Francisco from Los Angeles, and pick her up in his helicopter.

5. The star, Dwayne Johnson, publicly said that earthquake experts consulted on the film and determined the movie was realistic. This was a lie. Earthquake experts did examine the script but said most of it was crap. The filmmakers ignored the experts and did what they wanted.

6. Earthquakes cannot be predicted. The San Andreas fault isn't the right size to make an earthquake that big. The San Andreas fault cannot make tsunamis. Many buildings in California are built to handle an earthquake, at least long enough to let people escape - they don't collapse like a house of cards. I could go on, but you get the idea.

7. One of the biggest disappointments for me was that the movie was pretty boring. The disaster scenes were fun, but they were only about half the movie. The other half of the movie consisted of Ray and his ex-wife opening up about their feelings, and their daughter falling in love with a random British dude.

8. The screenplay was amateur, the characters were one-dimensional, and the acting was terrible. I cared more about what happened to the buildings than what happened to the people.

9. I went in to this movie with low expectations; I just wanted to see some fun destruction and a halfway coherent story. It turns out that this movie really is a disaster, but not in the way I was hoping.",1437436800,23,2679,4.428861788617886
7177140,1,B00XLX0Z62,A big zero. About as realistic as a Flintstones carton. Cheesy real cheesy!,1436745600,6,75,4.846153846153846

7177143,3,B00XLX0Z62,"I grew up watching super-producer Irwin Allen's disaster films. They were always filled with stars, featured great special effects and were really thrilling - to a ten-year old. I can't remember the Allen film I first watched, but I remember thinking ""The Towering Inferno"" was very good. And the reason I would have watched this was because of Fred Astaire - I have always loved his films. I also have fond memories of ""When Time Ran Out"", featuring Paul Newman (again), William Holden, Jacqueline Bisset and an active volcano threatening a posh island resort.  Somehow he managed to get A-Listers like Newman, Steve McQueen, Gene Hackman and many others to appear in his films. Allen must have really lavished these stars with some money because, let's face it, they aren't very good films. Sure, they are campy fun, but they don't hold up. They don't have very good acting and the stories are pretty ludicrous. Because each film had a huge cast, they also attracted many aging stars and up and comers, eager for a big break. They were a bit like big screen versions of ""The Love Boat"".

The films follow a pretty rigid formula. A greedy man builds something he shouldn't (it's too big to be safe, he's rushing the construction, it's built next to an active volcano) and his former right-hand man returns for the opening to voice one last objection and to rekindle his relationship with the greedy man's daughter. And all of this happens just as something happens (fire, tidal wave, volcano) to threaten the lives of everyone. The right-hand man becomes a hero and wins the heart of his ex.

When I first saw the trailer for ""San Andreas"", it immediately brought back memories of these old disaster epics. And I wanted to see it, real bad, if for no other reason than to relive a little piece of my childhood.

Ray (Johnson), a pilot for the Los Angeles Fire and Rescue group, is flying his copter over the City of Angels just as a major earthquake hits. His ex-wife, Emma (Carla Gugino) calls because she is trapped on the top of a crumbling highrise. They soon learn their daughter, Blake (Alexandra Daddario, the ""Percy Jackson"" films, TV's ""White Collar""), on her way to college and hitching a ride with Emma's boyfriend, real estate tycoon Daniel (Ioan Gruffud, ""Fantastic Four""), on his private airplane, is stuck in a garage under one of Daniel's huge San Francisco highrises. They make their way to the Bay Area to save Blake, who has partnered with Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt, ""Miss Fisher's Mysteries""), a young Brit who is applying for a job at Daniel's firm when the quake hits. Ben has his younger brother, Ollie (Art Parkinson, ""Game of Thrones"") along for the trip. Meanwhile, a professor of seismology (Paul Giamatti) runs around trying to get people to listen to his predictions about the quakes.

Directed by Brad Peyton (the sequels to ""Cats and Dogs"" and ""Journey"") and written by Carlton Cuse (one of the creators of ""Lost""), ""San Andreas"" does a remarkable job of paying homage to the Allen films, but in a weird sort of copycat way, duplicating all of the bad. It would be great if they managed to pay homage by making a better film. But they didn't do that.

When you are making a film, you are creating the universe these characters live in. And there have been many stories about what this film gets right and what it gets wrong - I'll bet every expert was contacted for a quote. I can't speak about the science presented, because I'm not an expert. But what I can speak to is the fact that characters talk about various things, presenting them as facts, and the filmmakers don't seem to be listening to their own creations and their own words. This creates plot holes that are about as big as the San Andreas fault is long. Worse yet, they stick out like sore thumbs.

Dwayne Johnson is an extremely likable guy and he is almost always watchable. He doesn't do anything wrong here, he is the hero and he does this well, as expected.

In fact, everyone is about what you would expect, because ""San Andreas"" doesn't really do anything to elevate the genre. As soon as we hear Blake and her mother's new boyfriend are headed to San Francisco, we know what will happen. As soon as Lawrence (Giamatti) and his trusted sidekick Dr. Kim Park (Will Yun Lee, ""The Wolverine"", TV's ""Hawaii Five-O"") head to Hoover Dam, we know what will happen. As soon as Ray and Emma head to San Francisco in his helicopter, we know what will happen.

The one character that should be allowed to play it pretty big and hammy, CalTech scientist Lawrence, is played with far too much earnestness by Giamatti. Most of the time, he is attached to a television reporter (Archie Panjabi, TV's ""The Good Wife""), trying to explain everything that he knows about earthquakes - which is, of course, a way for him to explain to us everything he knows about earthquakes. He almost seems to be channeling a real scientist, when in fact he needs to find a little more of the mad scientist in him. When he should be shouting and fuming, he simply speaks in hushed tones.

In a way, ""San Andreas"" is almost the disaster movie cousin of ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"". Ray and Emma use just about every form of transportation in their quest to find and save their daughter.

The problem with ""San Andreas"" (and so many other films) is that everything in the film and everyone involved falls short of helping the material go above and beyond the hokey parameters of the genre. Maybe a more talented and experienced director would have fixed the plot holes? Maybe a better cast would have caused us to feel more empathy for the characters? Maybe? Maybe? Maybe?

Also, there is a tremendous amount of none-too-subtle foreshadowing for the big dramatic moment that will close the film. Because these moments are so obvious, you see this big moment coming far in advance and can guess, again, far in advance, how it will play out. This robs the scene of any drama and surprise. And this is the last moment of the story, our last impression of the film.

The one thing I can say is that the special effects are good across the board. But this also points to a common problem in big budget studio films. Films are sold on concepts and someone thought this would be a cool idea to make into a film. Peyton was given a big toybox filled with money and  special effects, and he was unable to see the plot holes and the merely acceptable performances of his actors.

""San Andreas"" is fun - disaster movies always are - but it still isn't a very good film. And it is ultimately disappointing.",1435536000,7,6567,4.624892703862661

Disaster starts very soon into the movie and does not stop until the end. Lots of destruction and explosions. One thing that usually bothers me in this types of films and I generally overlook was just too pronounced in this one. I get that some of the events just do not need to make sense and they are totally unbelievable and unrealistic. But this one took the prize for unrealistic. The idea that they made it alive just stretched my ability to overlook the unbelievable too far. I get it, if you kill them the movie is over, but when they rode the waive and got through it i just started looking at my watch and hoping it would end soon.

7177149,4,B00XLX0Z62,"The Rock is an Army & LA rescue team helicopter pilot who tries to save his daughter, ex-wife, and as much of California as he can in, ""San Andreas"".

 I have always been a big fan of the ""Rock"" since his time in WWE to today in television and film media where he shines splendidly.  He plays a very refreshing character act that is missing in many of Hollywood's modern ""PC"" media, a very strong and tough macho man who boldly shows balls and charisma with no apology in the true fashion of ""Arnold"", ""Clint Eastwood"", ""Chuck Norris"", and ""John Wayne"" before him.

 Many aspects of this movie are down right fantasy driven implausible, and completely silly.  Some examples include a series of triple to quadruple Earth quakes back to back, or giant title waves, tornados, ect where our big muscle bound stud hero the ""Rock"" comes up with a daring on the spot solution, while rescuing his ex wife and daughter (who both happen to be stunning sexy young women that wear tight shirts & have fairly large full captivating breasts).

 One part of the movie I felt they depicted accurately was the total break down of law and civil order in society, where in the city of Bakersfield the Rock with is lovely ex, try to escape the pandemonium of the crime ridden streets when a scumbag looter tries to attack them with a gun, but the Rock's skills at martial arts combat were enough to turn the tables on that bastard.

 The only problem or ridiculous element of the movie I found was that we are led to believe that divorced couples, if only they teamed up to survive a super natural disaster of global proportions together, would magically fall back in love and forget their previous problems.  That only happens in fiction.  A more realistic story would be the Step Father character wouldn't act like a loser coward, and the Rock would still save them all accepting that life for him and is ex wife would have to move onward (but after all this is Hollywood).

I had felt this was a remake of the 1970's ""Earthquake"" movie, but either way it was enjoyable to a certain degree so I give a mild thumbs up, recommend for ages 11 to adult possibly, and a grade of B-/ C+",1434758400,,2162,4.48469387755102

I grew up on disaster movies (Towering Inferno is seared into my brain) so I have a special place in my heart for them. So I enjoy Hollywood revisiting them every few years despite the fact that most of them are quite poor. But theres still something fun about watching mayhem and carnage on the big screen and, for special effects, San Andreas is incredible despite the fact youve seen most of the best ones in the trailer. The rippling of the earth is almost worth the price of the ticket alone although how they spend so much on FX and still have one of the worst photoshopped family pictures is beyond me. Plotwise its incredibly predictable and the fact that a decorated war hero stole a government helicopter to save two family members over the thousands of people he is paid to save is completely overlooked.

I want to know who did the casting. You have a black man with an olive skinned Italian wife (light brown eyes) who have a white, blue-eyed daughter. It was distracting. I was wondering who her real dad was. Also, the two other main people are supposed to be British, but one is most definitely Australian -- they couldn't have changed their nationality?

Pros:
Special Effects

Cons:
The script (obvious plot and pathetic dialogue)
The acting (even with several actors I really like)

BEWARE SPOILERS (however this movie is so predictable that you can guess the spoilers just knowing what you're about to watch):

1. The movie starts with the LAFD crew that's been together since Afghanistan or Iraq (some war zone) and are like family, rescuing a a girl stuck in a car perched on the side of a narrow ravine. A news crew is with them so you can get their back story explained quick and easy. The problem is, after this rescue and one other brief dialog you never see this band of brothers again. Did they survive? Were the off rescuing others? Who knows? Obviously, there fearless leader wasn't as invested in this tight-nit group because he doesn't even mention them for the remainder of the movie.
2.  One big event happens and just when you think it's calmed, the next hits. It was consistent throughout the movie. You knew the moment it was looking like things were getting better, BAM, another quake or explosion or something was going to hit. It was ridiculous.
3. A tsunami is coming, boats are speeding to get to the top before it crests but apparently only one gets through -- guess whose. Considering there were dozens in front of them it was silly to the point of stupid. If others made it, the CGI department forgot to add them. As they are reaching the crest and everything looks like it will be fine, BAM, a cargo ship looms above and they have to get around the ship and its falling cargo.
4. The journey in this movie is The Rock and his estranged wife trying to rescue their daughter who was in SF (they were in LA). Along the way, they discuss the loss of another child (because there isn't enough drama in a natural disaster movie -- they have to add angst). When they finally find their living daughter (after crashing a helicopter, almost driving into a bottomless pit, jumping out of plane, cresting the tsunami and boating through the wreckage) the building she is in starts to collapse and water is filling the floor that she is stuck in. The couple stand on the boat talking about how he is going to rescue this daughter no matter what (who is most likely drowning while they share a kiss). Why is it, in their need to put romance in ALL films, characters don't seem to move with the appropriate level of urgency?
5. A long, drawn out scene of trying to rescue her finally culminates when she looks to have drown and Dad's able to move the debris that was in his way all along but wouldn't move before. He takes her to a higher level and begins doing CPR, only not -- just chest compressions, no breathing. The building has lowered again so that higher level is now eye level to the wife in the boat and she rams her way through the window to rescue them (there were two other people with the daughter all along so she can have her own romance brewing in the face of everyone dying). They get on the boat and, BAM, the building starts collapsing. Does she back the few feet out of it in the opposite direction of where the building is collapsing? No, She full throttles it through falling debris until the reach the outside on the other side but must still clear the falling building. All the while, daughter is still not breathing, but why would she? No one's thought to clear her lungs or give her breath. Dad gives up. Oh, no she's dead! No she's not! FINALLY, dad gives her mouth to mouth. What happens? She coughs up water and is alive.

There were a lot more things like these but you get the gist. I really wanted to like it and even though I heard there was silly dialogue I was willing to overlook it for a fun disaster movie. It missed on all points (except effects).",1434153600,19,4310,4.468869123252859
7177154,4,B00XLX0Z62,"The last disaster movie I saw in recent memory was the 2009 movie 2012. Frankly, I think at that time I was more scared of the events in the movie itself as opposed to the supposed ""Mayan Prophecy"". I like disaster films that cause you to think as a viewer and allow your mind to ponder about all the possibilities if such a disaster could occur. And with no further adieu, here is my review on the movie San Andreas.

After rescuing a girl from almost falling from her car to her death, Ray later calls his daughter to talk about their trip to San Francisco. Ray soon arrives at his soon to be ex-wife Emma's new home belonging to her new boyfriend Daniel. Over at the Hoover Dam, Dr. Park and Dr. Hayes are both currently investigating a possible earthquake, when suddenly a fault ruptures starting an earthquake. Upon further realization, Dr. Hayes realizes that the San Andreas fault is shifting; thereby on the verge of causing a massive earthquake.

Over the past couple of years, Dwayne Johnson has made quite the name for himself. And he does a really good job as the helicopter rescue pilot Ray. Also starring in the movie is actor Paul Giamatti as Dr. Hayes and I definitely enjoyed his performance; due to how well his character is able to explain the cause that ultimately lead to the disastrous effects. Alexandra Daddario plays Ray's daughter Blake alongside actress Carla Gugino who portrays her mom Emma. I enjoyed Alexandra's performance, though there were times I felt that Carla Gugino could have done a bit more in certain scenes. Overall though, I was satisfied in terms of acting.

In terms of story, there is not necessarily a major plot line to follow, but then again this IS a disaster movie. In that, you get these enormous earthquakes that cause massive destruction that ultimately ends up being really marvelous to look at; thanks to the impressive visual effects. Visually, San Andreas can do no wrong and is a gorgeous watch.
And believe me when I say, once San Andreas DOES take off, there is no slowing it down. Even better, I found the third act of the movie to be executed exceptionally well; because of the still growing suspense, and due to a few touching moments between the main characters. And just so you know, San Andreas is a movie I encourage you to GO SEE because of the acting(just remember Carla Gugino does only just enough), the visual bravado, the pacing of the movie, the timely manner in which the story is executed, and the the exceptional payoff of the third act. It may not be a perfect disaster film or even the best disaster film, but it is one of the better disaster films in recent memory and that is why San Andreas is

The movie never really lets up and even through all the cheesy dialog and unbelievability it is very fun to watch and is one that is easy to see over and over. Overall, exactly what you would expect from a movie like this. Cheesy but super fun and exciting to watch. I recommend this. I give it a high B+.",1433808000,7,916,4.300578034682081
7177157,1,B00XLX0Z62,"Didn't even finish watching it. The special effects were over the top and totally unrealistic because it was one off the wall scene after another. The story line of a black male with a white, blue-eyed daughter was just as unrealistic and completely, totally wack. It actually detracted from the movie but the movies are pushing this theme all the time instead of just telling the story.

And that's another complaint I have. The racism in most of today's movies. They never show black men who are married to or have a loving  relationship with a black woman. It's like black men don't even know black women exist and that's what Hollywood wants to promote. It's so bad that the black males in today's movies most of the time don't even know any black people!

And the people being rescued are always white females. Is it too much to ask that a black male ""hero"" actually helps anyone black? I think this is part of the programming of what a black male hero must and should be: Someone totally disconnected from other black people and only then can he be portrayed as a decent and courageous man.

Couldn't enjoy this totally wack film and left midway through the movie. I would not recommend this movie. Not at all. Very poorly done.",1433808000,11,1234,4.570135746606335

7177160,4,B00XLX0Z62,"It has been known for decades that, of all the major cities in the United States that are vulnerable to massive earthquakes, both Los Angeles and San Francisco rank at the very top. Not only are there many fault lines running underneath each city and its outlying metropolitan areas, but there's also what is arguably the most notorious fault line on the planet, the dreaded San Andreas Fault. Scientists have said that a major quake usually occurs along this fault line every one hundred fifty years; and in the year 2015, that time is severely overdue; and while there have been significant quakes in that period, they've occurred on rift zones other than the 800 mile-long San Andreas, which runs all the way from Eureka southeast to the Mexican border. But in the 2015 sci-fi/disaster opus SAN ANDREAS, California's time has run out.

Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson portrays an L.A. Fire Department chopper pilot who is expert at saving people's lives, but who wasn't able to save one of his daughters during a whitewater rafting trip that turned tragic; and soon his life is turned upside down when his wife (Carla Gugino) serves him with divorce papers. In the meantime, over at the seismological lab at Caltech in Pasadena, the school's chief seismologist (Paul Giamatti) has detected ground pulses in southern Nevada, which unfortunately start a chain of horrific ground events, beginning with a massive quake destroying Hoover Dam. Yet this is only the beginning; to him, it indicates a possible chain reaction on the San Andreas Fault Zone on the 400-mile stretch between L.A. and San Francisco. Sure enough, his predictions come true with extreme consequences, as all of California is hit with a swarm of quakes in the 7.5 to 9.5 magnitude range along the infamous fault line, with Los Angeles and its surrounding environs being hit first. Johnson is thus forced into action to rescue Gugino from a crumbling high rise in Downtown Los Angeles; and with the knowledge that his only surviving daughter (Alexandra Daddrio) is up in San Francisco, he and Gugino must outrace the continuous destruction to get her.

Without question, like a lot of Hollywood blockbusters that rely so heavily on CGI, SAN ANDREAS suffers at times from plausibility issues, as real-life Caltech seismologists Lucy Jones and Kate Hutton pointed out. There is only minimal scientific evidence that ground pulses of the type mentioned here could trigger seismic events on any other fault lines, let alone a monstrous catastrophe along the San Andreas Rift Zone. Still, in terms of certain important rescue and destruction scenarios, like many older buildings collapsing with nightmarish results, SAN ANDREAS does things right, especially with the presence of Johnson playing an Everyman type of hero.

Though it shares its scenario with two other important films of this type (1974's EARTHQUAKE, and the 1990 made-for-TV film THE BIG ONE: THE GREAT LOS ANGELES EARTHQUAKE), SAN ANDREAS also borrows liberally from more recent high-octane sci-fi/disaster films like 1998's DEEP IMPACT, 2004's THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, and, perhaps most especially, the 2009 end-of-the world spectacle ""2012."" But while director Brad Peyton is not in the human-interest category of a Steven Spielberg, he is still able to get the best out of his six main cast members, who are not stereotypical cardboard clichs, even with a script and storyline with plausibility problems. Several moments in the film, like the rescue of Daddrio from a San Francisco high rise swamped by the tsunami, are quite frightening. In the end, SAN ANDREAS, whatever gaps there are between illusion and reality, does serve up the goods in true Hollywood fashion. But it also warns that the people in both Los Angeles and San Francisco are at risk from The Big One now more than ever before. For those reasons, I am willing to forgive its occasional ""faults"" (pardon the pun).",1433721600,7,3909,5.057364341085271

7177163,3,B00XLX0Z62,"PLOT SPOILER REVIEW???

Ray (Dwayne Johnson) is ex-military working for LA Fire and Rescue. In the opening scene, God rightly attempts to kill the world's most distracted driver, and Ray foils the plan with a helicopter that has its own swagger music. In a subplot that never connects,  Paul Giamatti plays Professor Hayes at Cal Tech who predicts the big one, i.e what happens in Vegas, happens in LA.

The basic plot is the same as an  Asylum disaster movie plot. A great disaster happens, and the film concentrates on one typical 2.3 child family trying to come together. In this case substitute a new male friend and his brother for 1.3 kids. The main difference is that Ray is separated from his wife (Carla Gugino) who is going to live with her new boyfriend Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd) and his daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario). Yes I had ""Taken"" plot flashbacks and wondered if they were going to include Albanians. Liam Neeson would have stopped the looters.

As far as the plot, I really don't have to say anything more. Unless you are younger than the film rating, you will have the whole thing figured out in the first 10 minutes. Even the action within the scenes are predictable, like the Hoover dam scene hand off.

The soundtrack was typical. What separated this from an Asylum flick was the special effects, actors, and lack of insignia gaffs.

If you want on overly predictable action/disaster film, this is it.

Whoever was in charge of the script should have said, ""We rewrite.""  SAN ANDREAS tells the story of a couple whose divorce is about to finalize (Do you think they will reunite?!) and two young singles who have a happenstance encounter (Do you think they'll get together?!) as earthquakes and their accompanying tsunamis ravage California.  A lot of the disaster footage looks authentic and, despite at times overplayed to the point of silliness, is the biggest reason to see SAN ANDREAS, but that is only because the most interesting aspect of the film, a seismologist played by Paul Giamatti who predicts the coming catastrophe, does not get enough screen time.  It would not surprise me to learn the original script of SAN ANDREAS focused on the Giamatti character until someone decided to cut down his part so there could be more room for rescues by action star Dwayne Johnson (his nickname is ""the Rock"" but, as we see when he saves his daughter, ought to be changed to ""the Fish"") as well as the aforementioned romantic drama, though don't ask me why you would want to stop for a kiss when the city of San Francisco is crashing down on your head.",1433548800,2,1223,4.700934579439252

You know, the usual.

But this one really stands at the head of its pack.
- The CGI is mind-boggling. (Remember when The Last Starfighter broke records for CGI complexity?) Even by today's mind-boggling standards.
-- They got the science right, to within reasonable confidence intervals. Good science takes nothing away from an exciting flick - quite the opposite.
-- The ""family values"" thing is as strong as ever, and I kinda like it. Daddy taking care of his own, without having to shoot up half a continent in the process - peace to Liam Neeson, there are other ways to be a family man.

But, I still bit my tongue struggling to suspend disbelief more than once. Like, how many randomly stolen Cessnas will just happen to have a tandem rig in the back? (Oh, and how many have the back seats out, like for jumpers?) And how many chopper pilots are tandem masters?

But, c'mon. It's a disaster flick. And a daddy thing. Within those parameters, I rank it among the best. Totally popcorn-worthy.

I'm a fan of disaster movies and expected to love this one, but I'd already seen most of it in ""The Day After Tomorrow"":

1.  Brave dad goes off to rescue independent teen child from natural disaster
2.  Teen falls in love while dodging doom
3.  Tsunami (coming from the wrong direction) pushes ship into city street
4.  Dad easily finds child despite impossible odds
5.  World almost ends but divorced parents still reunite

And all this happens without the lead actresses' makeup even getting smeared!

It was just too corny for words.  Dwayne Johnson was the only likable or sympathetic character in the whole movie, and he's stuck uttering the dumbest lines (""We rebuild!"").  There are two young, cheerful  guys with such sickeningly sweet English accents, I expected them to break out in songs from, ""Oliver!""  The worst offense was to film many of the big disaster scenes with a very shaky hand-cam and to focus on the stars' faces  instead of the crumbling landscape.  None of the effects were believable  because, though millions were killed and maimed, the stars emerge completely unscathed and looking effortlessly handsome/beautiful.

The story is how a singe family navigates it's way through a series of cataclysmic earthquakes along the San Andreas fault, and the story centers on the destruction of San Francisco.  No, California does not fall into the sea.  Sorry.

There is also a side plot involving a scientist who has a team that predicts earthquakes, but those characters aren't developed as much.

The movie began with action and character development at the same time, and through the entire film the action and character development keep pace with each other.  As buildings fall, we get more and more of the characters' backstory.  It's sort of a roller coaster between getting to know the characters and seeing their world fall apart.

The special effects really impressed me.  Even though we live in a time when we expect fantastic effects, I was still amazed by what I saw.  The destruction of San Francisco reminded me of 9/11 in an eerie way.  It left me wanting to see a ""making of"" documentary.

The one part I didn't really get was why there would be a tsunami inbound to San Francisco harbor after earthquakes along the San Andreas fault.  It didn't make much sense to me, but it made for more awesome visuals.  Seeing the navy destroyer upended between the office buildings was weird, but it's one of my main memories from the movie.

7177173,4,B00XLX0Z62,"I have to admit this movie was not high on my radar to see.  In fact I bought a ticket to see another movie but had time to kill so went in to see this one and didn't leave.

Many movies are set in San Francisco, whether it's Hitchcock's  Vertigo,  Eastwood's Dirty Harry series ,  Allen's Blue Jasmine, Verhoeven's  Basic Instinct. or Planet of the Apes the city's skyline, and the Golden Gate Bridge provide an iconic backdrop that's hard to match, then there is that other thing San Francisco is famous for - earthquakes.  I remember watching a movie about the 1906 earthquake as a child, little thinking I would one day live here.

We always hear the next big one is coming and I arrived here shortly after the last big one in 1989, saw many earthquake damaged buildings and experienced my first of several minor earthquakes shortly after arriving.  Even so, the thought of such a thing looms bigger in the minds of people who don't live here than people who do.  Still watching this movie  conjures some very odd feelings for me as a person who lives in this city as I have to keep reminding myself this is a movie.  I work two blocks from Coit Tower, which becomes  a focal point in the movie.

The movie starts out with a precursor.  A girl texting in a car,  when a shake hits the road, and the rescuer in the from of The Rock appears in a helicopter to oversee a vertiginous rescue.  A tv reporter in the helicopter provides the connecting tissue to the other story, the seismologists with their predictive models of how big the quake is going to be.

One of the interesting things about this movie is that the protagonist is resourceful not ordinary.  Often these movies pit ordinary people in extraordinary situations.  You suspect though The Rock will be able to handle anything that comes his way.  The Rock's character is getting divorced from his wife.  What's the problem, you may wonder, as they seem to be a couple with great love and chemistry for each other. I liked how this aspect of the story unfolded.  The wife happens to be dating a San Francisco developer who seems a decent guy, but when put to the test in the earthquake situation is found seriously lacking.

I found the story very engaging.  Carla Gugino does a wonderful job as the mother. This is a very much a family story and how they respond to the situation.  Another parallel story involves the couple's daughter and her being thrown into this situation with a somewhat bashful love interest whose younger brother plays matchmaker.  There were even moments during the movie that got a little applause.

There are a number of story improbabilities, such as the young suitor's near miraculous recovery from a hideous leg wound, a long distance search for a daughter in a distant city with little hope of finding her, and a resuscitation scene which seems to be drawn out a little longer than necessary.  Overall though, I was relieved when I left the theater to find all the familiar landmarks still standing.

I imagine few cities are as well prepared for an earthquake as San Francisco, the tops of some tall buildings have a sway factor of as much as 15 feet built so these tall building will not simply collapse.  And many residences are of timber framed construction so they will not simply fall apart.

I think most people who go to see this movie will enjoy it.",1433376000,4,3354,4.55685618729097
7177174,3,B00XLX0Z62,"The disaster movie model holds up better than the hundreds of crumbling, shattering buildings in the earth-rattling San Andreas, a film that finds Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson (and his biceps) battling Mother Nature to a stalemate. Expecting the film to live up to the staggering heights of classic '70s disaster flicks is probably too much, but director Brad Peyton, who teamed up with Johnson on the equally campy Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, knows that he's got a star who can literally carry this kind of old school action spectacle on his broad shoulders.

The tropes of disaster films have become so ingrained at this point that we no longer expect any variation, and San Andreas certainly doesn't try to break the mold. Johnson plays heroic helicopter rescue pilot Ray Gaines, a guy so good at what he does the Los Angeles news sends crews to chronicle his exploits. Basically, Johnson is playing Johnson here; his t-shirts are a size too small, he always looks like he just bathed in baby oil and anything can be solved with a flex of his biceps and some strong words. That's the Johnson audiences paid to see and they get it in spades. Gaines has a soon-to-be ex-wife (Carla Gugino) and a beautiful young daughter (Alexandra Daddario), who we all know will be in need of rescue when disaster strikes. But they also need to be rescued from the mother's new boyfriend, a sleazy architect (Ioan Gruffudd, always good at playing the rich sleaze bag) who builds skyscrapers we know are destined to crumble.

So lots of easy setup here by screenwriter Carlton Cuse (Lost), who gives us some family drama to tug at our heartstrings while the entire west coast shakes, rattles, and rolls into oblivion when the largest earthquake in history strikes. Paul Giamatti plays CalTech's Dr. Lawrence Hayes, and gets all of the geeky geological stuff about fault lines that nobody really cares about. His job is to make everything sound ominous, and to predict stuff we already know is going to happen. When he tells us the worst is yet to come, we already know it.

That San Andreas is predictable as Johnson sweating buckets won't surprise anybody. That the film is still largely entertaining throughout is all that really matters, and that is due to Johnson's alpha male performance and genuine chemistry with Gugino. While their characters' marital issues are laid out pretty thin, the past tragedy they share is what inspires their dogged quest through Hell (meaning Hollywood) to save their wayward daughter. That we can buy into easily, with Gugino and Johnson delivering solid performances as the frantic parents. As great an actor as Giamatti is he's had more than his share of junky roles and this is another one. But he also knows how to calibrate his performance perfectly to the level of the material, so we can sense him having quite a bit of fun as the stodgy professor urging citizens to evacuate ""because your lives depend on it"".

Peyton acquits himself well with this Emmerich-sized disaster, delivering an impressive mass destruction of San Francisco and Los Angeles, with the decimation of the Hoover Dam the biggest payoff scene. But when you've seen one CGI building collapse you've seen a thousand, and pretty soon it loses any real shock value. It doesn't help that Johnson and Gugino's characters are often above the fray, literally flying over the worst of the chaos. The bulk of the survival action involves Daddario and co-star Hugo Johnston-Burt as a British tourist and potential love interest, plus Art Parkinson as his precocious little brother.

Reverberating like massive aftershocks, the film goes from one exciting set piece to another with little time to catch a breath in-between. It also doesn't leave much time to think about the plot, such as it is. Disaster movies may be the most reliable genre Hollywood has to offer, but as a recent flick like Into the Storm proves, they're also remarkably easy to screw up. San Andreas is predictable fun, but with Johnson swinging in to the rescue it also delivers plenty of muscular thrills.",1433376000,,4069,4.882778581765558

Mostly, the acting is engaging. Carla Gugino and  Alexandra Daddario are believable as a mother and a daughter.

With that said, I didn't particularly like the storyline or some of the characters. By the end, I was secretly hoping that the wife or the daughter would not escape unscathed - particularly the wife.

Reminded me a little of 2012 in one scene - everyone is dying around them and they're reminiscing about their relationship problems. There was exactly the same scene in 2012 while enroute to China, she corners her ex-husband in a car and prods him to talk about the old days. ('You didn't give me enough attention waaah.') Several billion people have just perished painfully and this woman is so vapid, she's dwelling on relationship issues?

7177179,4,B00XLX0Z62,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.  The big, bold and brainy (not) disaster film is still with us and in terms of technical, CGI and green screen quality, ""San Andreas"" raises the bar, if ever so slightly.  Dwayne ""Rock"" Johnson plays Ray, a Los Angeles firefighter who specializes in high risk helicopter rescues - we see a doozy right off the bat.  He's on the verge of divorce from his wife Emma (Carla Gugino, ""Sin City"") and together they have a college age daughter, Blake played by Alexandra Daddario.  Ms. Daddario is probably best known by younger viewers as Annabeth from the ""Percy Jackson"" films.  Older viewers will probably recognize her from her...uh grown up role as Lisa in last year's ""True Detective"" on HBO.  And in case you're wondering (I was), she's less than 14 years younger than the ""Rock"" in real life.  Acting!

In any case, the film deals with the effects, before, during and after a giant (9.6 on Richter scale) earthquake devastates parts of Nevada and coastal California.  The film, directed by Brad Peyton (""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island"") has some terrific, if implausible rescue scenes involving Ray and Emma.  Emma, having lunch with her boyfriend's (Ioan Gruffudd) sister (Kylie Minogue) when the earthquake hits L. A.  She must scramble to the top deck of the high rise, where Ray has maneuvered his helicopter to save her.

Daniel (Gruffudd) has driven Blake to San Francisco where she attends school.  When the quake works its way up the coast, it hits the Bay area the hardest.  In the meantime, Ray with the now rescued Emma head north by helicopter and later by small plane to rescue Blake.  Blake meets cute with a young Brit named Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) who is interviewing for a job at Daniel's architectural firm.  He has dragged along his 13 year old brother, Ollie (Art Parkinson).  This trio must survive the quake and its aftermath in San Francisco until Ray and Emma rescue them.

So how does that happen, which of course we know it will?  It turns out Blake has some inherent survival instincts and tricks learned from her dad.  And then there was a brief phone call with Ray when he advises her to move to higher ground.  That's about it.  Once Ray and Emma get to the now devastated city, they jump in a power boat, defy an oncoming Tsunami and maneuver their way through the flooded and debris riddled city to find Blake.  There is a secondary plot involving a seismologist (Paul Giamatti) who is doing a TV info piece with producer/interviewer (Archie Panjabi).

 Either the Rock-actor and ex-professional wrestler Dwayne Johnson is getting better as an actor or his directors, Brad Payton in this case, are getting better at shooting him to his best advantage.  And having the trio of writers (Carlton Cuse, Andre Fabrizio and Jeremy Passmore) giving him things to do rather than things to say helps.  A lot.  The writers are all seasoned Hollywood pros.  San Andreas has a much bigger budget than director Brad Payton has had control over in the past.  He directed the Rock in the 2012 film Journey 2: The Mysterious Island which might have helped him focus on Johnson's virtues and avoid his weaknesses.
 We think of San Andreas as a massive disaster film, massive with a reported $110 million budget and massive in the shaking, crashing destruction of San Francisco and Los Angeles California. We don't need no stinking character development here.  Rescue fireman Dwayne Johnson must find and rescue his estranged wife (Carla Gugino) in L.A. from the first mega quake and then find a way across ravaged California to San Francisco to rescue their daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario-an actress so beautiful that we tend to ignore her strong credits in film and TV.)  A second quake hits Frisco following the first hit on LA.  Along the way we get chopper crashes, a parachute jump, an encounter with a tsunami, a helicopter dodging falling sky scrapers, a cowardly lover and two English lads who lend a helping hand.  Young Art Parkinson plays young teen Ollie Taylor in a well written and acted minor role.
 While the rest of the cast runs around, fleeing falling stuff, fire and rising water, the admirable Paul Giamatti has a role written for him that allows him, almost uniquely in the film, to act.  He plays a Cal Tech earthquake scientist who's life project comes to fruition as the quake event begins.  He invents a program to predict major quakes and his program saves who knows how many millions of lives.  Giamati always puts in interesting performances and he does so here.
 This film has light roles for the major players and a huge role for the special effects guys.  Wow, does California ever get a beating.
 This massive extravaganza carries a PG-13 rating (we see a lot of wrecked stuff but very few dead people) and a good three and a half saw blades.  It runs one hour and 54 minutes.  I had fun watching it and people from Reno to Rangoon will also have fun watching it.",1433116800,2,2443,4.7281323877068555
7177182,3,B00XLX0Z62,"I went to the movies to see this because I wanted to see the special effects on the big screen.  Plot-wise, you can't expect too much in a disaster film and it held true with this.  Without spoiling, some of the people who lived should have realistically died three times over.  A person who probably had no experience driving a boat handled one immediately like a pro.  I don't think you can take a boat like that and zip effortlessly thru water that is filled with junk and bodies.  For all the expense and effort spent on special effects, I think they should have gotten longer screen time.  I didn't feel it lived up to what I was expecting for this cataclysmic event.  I hope no sequels are planned.",1433116800,,704,4.410852713178294
7177183,5,B00XLX0Z62,"I confess, I would much rather watch movies at home. But San Andreas is one of those movies that should be seen for the first time on a big screen. The visuals are stunning--terrifying at times--and let's face it, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, in all his muscled glory, was made for the big screen.

The story opens with rescue chopper pilot Ray Gaines (Johnson) and his team attempting a particularly difficult rescue. After a couple of way too close calls, Gaines takes a big risk to save a young woman. In some ways, this scene reminds me of the opening scene in the 1993 film Cliffhangerbut with a better outcome.

Yep--this is the kind of white-knuckle movie I love.

At Caltech, seismologist Dr. Lawrence Hayes (Paul Giamatti) and his colleague, Dr. Kim Park (Will Yun Lee) are working on a formula to predict earthquakes. They travel to Nevada to monitor small tremors detected at Hoover Dam--and end up caught in a major quake, where Park is killed.

Meanwhile, back in LA, Ray prepares to take his daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) up to San Francisco, where she's attending college. That same day, he receives divorce papers from his estranged wife, Emma (Carla Gugino). Ray doesn't want the divorce, but a family tragedy has come between them and Emma sees no way back. Shes moved onand moved in with new boyfriend Daniel Riddick (Ioan Gruffud), a wealthy developer who, it turns out, has a yellow streak down his back as wide as theyesSan Andreas fault. When Ray is called to assist rescue operations in the Nevada quake, he has to bail on Blake and their plans. Daniel immediately offers to take her, since hes headed for San Francisco anyway. What better way to score points with Mom than to fly her daughter to school on his private plane?

Returning to his lab at Caltech, Hayes makes a terrifying discovery: a major quakemajor as in part of the state maybe dropping into the oceanis about to hit the San Andreas fault with devastating consequences. The worst of it will destroy San Francisco. (We didn't need a seismologist to see that coming, did we?) The first quake hits LA while hes preparing for a TV interview, and the interviewer  (Archie Panjabi) helps him get the word out to hopefully save as many people as possible.

As soon as Ray hears the news of the LA quake, he abandons his mission (he probably would have been fired, had this movie had a Marvel-style post credits scene) and heads back to save Emma. Good thing he knows where she was having lunch with Daniels snotty sister (pop singer Kylie Minogue)because he arrives as the building is collapsing. Together, they head for San Francisco to get their daughter. En route, their conversation reveals the details of what ended their marriagethe death of their other daughter, for which Ray blames himself.

Their journeyboth physically and emotionallymay seem a bit farfetched to some moviegoers. Ive seen reviews use the words no way repeatedly. But as a parent, I can honestly say that if my child were facing such danger, Id move heaven and earth to find him. Its the family dynamic that makes this movie workthough the special effects are pretty great, too. And the women in this movie are as capable and resourceful as our hero. One of my favorite lines is a phone message Emma leaves for Daniel after discovering he abandoned Blake in the chaos in San Francisco: If you're not already dead, Im going to kill you!

Does Daniel does get a smackdown from karma before Emma can make good on her promise? Yep, and its a good one.

I loved the two British brothers, Ben and Ollie (Hugo Johnstone-Burt and Art Parkinson) who end up with Blake in San Francisco. Ollie as the kid brother is delightful, smarter than he should be and possessing the boldness of youth. Ben is shy with Blake at first, leaving it to Ollie to play matchmaker for them (sequel, anyone?).

However, two genres draw us out of the house - disaster flicks and dinosaurs. I cannot resist a disaster/apocalypse big budget movie and San Andreas certainly fit the bill. The CGI effects were excellent and the tension was exactly right for this genre - not too ramped up and the slower parts didn't make you wonder where your action film had gone.

The acting was solid all around - even the supporting cast was respectable. Dwayne Johnson has grown and matured over the years and his skills are improving with every movie, I really enjoyed him in San Andreas. He felt like a Dad and a husband here, not just an all powerful hero to save the day. I do wish we had a little less of the Sci-Fi channel type plot devices in this movie -the broken family reconnecting, the ignored scientists now proven correct, the romance that springs from shared experience.

7177186,2,B00XLX0Z62,"A movie with faults.

There are varying degrees of disaster movies. They range from the utterly awful (2012, Dante's Peak) to the pretty entertaining (The Poseiden Adventure, Towering Inferno). When I plan to see one, my expectations are pretty tepid - I know it's not going to be high art, but I hope it'll be entertaining enough. I think San Andreas falls somewhere right in the middle.

The story is simple enough. The titular fault line that runs from San Francisco to Los Angeles activates, causing the biggest earthquake in recorded history. A rescue pilot named Ray (played by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) goes on a hunt to rescue his wife and daughter.

It's hard not to root for The Rock - not only is he the biggest action star on the planet, but he's a genuinely awesome person. His charisma is clear on screen, but it's a bit hard to take him seriously as a helicopter pilot. He's also apparently the worst rescue worker ever, because he takes his helicopter and flies 300 miles north to rescue one person instead of trying to help thousands of the city of L.A.'s trapped citizens. The rest of the cast is easily interchangeable - Carla Gugino plays his wife and Alexandria Daddario (Woody Harrelson's muse on True Detective) plays his daughter. The cast does pretty well with what they have to work with. The problem is, they don't have much.

This script is abysmal. It's terribly predictable in the sense that whatever you see or hear onscreen WILL come up again. Ioan Gruffudd is cast as Daniel, a villain (as if Mother Earth wasn't big enough) - his sole purpose in this film is to anger the audience. I think it would have been much more interesting if he was a genuinely good guy, having to help The Rock with the woman they both love. Paul Giamatti stars as ""time filler scientist"" in a story line that, if taken out, wouldn't have made a bit of difference. He's simply there to fill screen time and spew exposition on why earthquakes happen. Newsflash, we understand why earthquakes happen. Some kid stars as ""comedic relief character"", as you'd expect, along with his brother, who stars as ""contrived love story guy"", because we simply have to appeal to everyone. There were two other rescue workers introduced at the beginning that never appeared again, which was unfortunate, because I think they could have added to the story.

That being said, we don't watch disaster movies for the story, do we? We watch them for the destruction, and that's where San Andreas thrives. Most of the CGI is fantastic - buildings crumbling, bridges collapsing, cruise ships capsizing - they all look amazing. There was only one scene, the opening scene of an SUV tumbling down a cliff, that looked awful. The rest was really good. AT&T Park folding in on itself was particularly satisfying. Being from this area, it is interesting to see a fictional version of your city being destroyed - a thought that's always in the back of the minds of Californians who have dealt with earthquakes before.

If you're looking for high art, you won't find it here, but you can do much worse  than spending a lazy afternoon with The Rock, but you can do a lot better. Go see Mad Max: Fury Road instead.

Yes, it is harebrained and at times lands with a thuda climactic shot of an American flag grandly unfurling as the sun sets is groan-inducingbut the set pieces are realized with muscular showmanship and convincing computer-generated imagery, with the mega-budget spectacle (the tsunami!) nicely complemented by moments of ground-level, in-the-moment suspense involving trapped legs and crowds of looters.

The plot is the usual Hollywood stuff with good people and some jerks too plus the usual scientific inaccuracies and personal relationship dribble. I will say the acting itself is not bad however, you just know what is coming with the personal relationship sub-plots.

Some compare it to 2012, I don't feel that way. 2012 is way more into the sci-fi/fantasy camp.  This one is more ""believable"" and less ""cheesy"" than 2012 - I did find 2012 to be entertaining however.

SEE SAN FRANCISCO SHAKE AND BAKE!

THIS IS ONE TIME THEY CAN'T PUT THE BLAME ON MAME!

Whether it can actually happen or not, this movie should make San Franciscans, indeed all Californians, think seriously about packing up and moving to Nebraska.

I certainly hope all that devastation was CGI.  This is probably the best disaster movie I've seen lately and Dwayne Johnson is very good. He has some memorable lines which require actually acting and to my mind has proven he can handle that as well as being an action hero. Though there' snot all that much dialogue, the entire cast delovers enough fortitude and emotion to make up for that.

You want TENSE moments?  This story has 'em, from the scene as Hoover Dam explodes, while the seismologists are testing their equipment which can predict eaerthquakes to the underwater rescue from a skyscraper submerged by an 85-foot tsunami. POIGNANCY?  The brief cameo of the elderly couple whose car breaks down on the highway leading into San Francisco. SHEER COWARDICE?  Having only seen Ioan Grufudd as a member of the Fantastic Four and in ""Forever,"" it was a little difficult to accept him as the cowardly, self-centered businessman but that's my problem. HEROICS?  Just about everyone in the film.

Most EXCITING moment:  Cresting the tsunami only to meet an ocean liner coming from the other direction.

Having gone through the aftershocks of some rather mild earthquakes while living in California, all I could think while watching this film was how glad I was I'd never had to experience a REAL one...and I was very thankful to be viewing this one from the safety of a seat in a theater...and that it was only make-believe.

7177194,5,B00XLX0Z62,"San Francisco is having a bad day.  A very bad day.  But, when ""The Rock"" Dwayne Johnson is your dad, you have nothing to fear.  No little 9.7 Earthquake can stop him.  San Andreas impressed me and had more heart and better effects than I was expecting.  I was anticipating a story much flimsier and as shaky as one of those high-rise buildings swaying back and forth in the film, but I was pleasantly surprised.

Dwayne Johnson further solidifies his role as Hollywood action hero in this film and with those arms like boulders, he can save anyone, any day.  Yet, as I've always admired about him, there's still an ""everyman's"" quality about Johnson and his ability to connect easily with his audience that I think is an overlooked talent he possesses.  There's even character development and arcing in this film which is so often forgotten in an ""in-your-face"" action flick such as this one.  Dwayne's character struggles with his past and the loss of his marriage.  It ain't Gone with the Wind, but it gives the film depth and heart and gives the audience something more to invest in than just crashing buildings and shaky sidewalks.

San Andreas certainly delivers its share of realistic Earthquake effects here. There's no shortage of that.  You won't be leaving the theater thinking, ""I wish just one more quake could have struck and one more building could have toppled.""  Nope.  There's plenty in the film.  The carnage can be a bit much (do we really need to see a man fall off a building?)-- and it sometimes approaches ""horror-movie-like"" status, but at least it's brief.

Alexandra Daddario (Percy Jackson films) really shines here as Dwayne Johnson's college-aged daughter while she befriends a fun-loving, polite pair of brothers on her journey to find her dad.  The brothers bring some lightness and humor in the midst of this natural disaster and there's even time for a kiss between Daddario and the older brother later in the film.  The real story here is this 20 year-old daughter's struggle to survive and her aid to the brothers she befriends.  She has plenty of emergency disaster knowledge (hey, her dad rescues people for a living-- this girl knows stuff) and is a strong-willed hero, just like dad.

Another strong player in the film is a surprise performance by Paul Giamatti as the genius professor who invents a method of predicting Earthquakes.  You might ask yourself why an Oscar-Golden Globe-Emmy nominated actor is in this loud, crashing action flick, but he's a believable and dependable actor who adds weight to the film.

Does Dwayne Johnson find his family and save their lives?  You'll have to find out yourself.  This film is definitely worth the $15 to watch the heroics unfold on screen in the midst of those crashing buildings and crumpling sidewalks.  (Did I mention the tsunami yet?  Yup.  You'll see that, too.)  One more thing-- I've been seeing some news articles today complaining about the ""shaky"" science in this film.  Are you kidding me?  We pay our money to watch Dwayne Johnson swoop in like a superhero and save the day, we watch for the incredible special effects-- we don't watch a movie like this for a lesson in seismology science.

Kid Factor:  The Earthquake violence is jarring, loud, and lengthy.  Might be too scary for children under 8.  There is some pretty intense carnage during the first half of the film (people being crushed by blocks of cement, legs being pinned in cars, people falling out of buildings).  This approaches almost horror-movie status at times-- could be too frightening for kids under 10.",1432944000,4,3576,4.8448844884488445
