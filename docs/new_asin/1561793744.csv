7796249,5,1561793744,I enjoy watching the Last Chance Detectives movies with my second graders.  The Ledgend of Big Foot was by far the most exciting and fun for the children to watch.  I only wish they had made more movies.  I have often wondered if Mike ever finds his dad alive and if his mom married Smitty.  Exciting movies.  Fun for the whole family.,1277164800,,335,4.338709677419355
