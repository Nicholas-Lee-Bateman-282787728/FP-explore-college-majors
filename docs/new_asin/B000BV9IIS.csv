8092990,5,B000BV9IIS,"I really have to commend NEST on this series of animated Biblical stories. They are well done, high quality animation, and are very respectful of the source. This story is one that no one seems willing to tackle, Elisha did so much in the bible, you don't want to leave anything out. This is a great opportunity to finally see the great acts of the prophet in a visual form, and it is well done. I have 2 minor issues, the first is that in the attempt to cover as much as they could they and to rush through some incidents, but if they had spent more time on each and skipped some I would probably not have liked that either. You just can't have it all in the short time frame they had. I suppose the story could use a feature length film, and 30 minutes is not enough. The only other issue is that they show Elisha's helper time and again hoping to profit himself from situations, when it is only recorded once in the Bible. I am sure they did this to better explain what happens to him as a result, so I do not fault them for this and will keep the video for repeat viewing. Some of the NEST titles are on DVD, but are very expensive so mine are all VHS for now. My favorite in this series is the prophet that came before Elisha, that is Elijah. If you start buying these, to me that is the best story they have done of the ones I have seen so far. If you like Biblical animation, another series to check out is the Testament Bible in Animation series from Wales.",1263686400,,1465,4.125874125874126
