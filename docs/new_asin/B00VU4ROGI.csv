8711261,1,B00VU4ROGI,The worst cane dvd ever! He stands by himself and tries to teach. Techniques require 2 people not one! Do not waste ur money!!,1503100800,,126,4.291666666666667
8711262,1,B00VU4ROGI,"With any kind of video claiming to teach defensive or fighting techniques, there's a simple universal convention:  the techniques are always demonstrated with another person standing in as the attacker, to allow the viewer to see how the techniques are applied, and their supposed effects.  Apparently Stelzer never got this memo.  This is 60 minutes of him standing alone among gym equipment flailing his sticks around with poor quality video and sound.  It's followed by a long crawl that serves as Stelzer's CV, then by a series of previews for equally useless videos, all of which show him alone in a gym or alone in a park or backyard.  There's far more useful information available for free on YouTube, and all of it taking less time.  Save your time and money, and skip this garbage video.",1480118400,2,796,4.8161764705882355
