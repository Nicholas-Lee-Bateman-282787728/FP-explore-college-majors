6925335,5,B00RC16T7S,"Heady Intellectual German comedy. The main character has a terrible job, but always ends up in interesting situations. Have not laughed so much in years. Hooked on this series. Episodes are re-watchable, layered plots, amazing dialogue. Love it. Simple on the surface, nuanced and deep structure. And funny. Ordered Season One immediately after watching an episod by chance. Scratches both my funny bone and brain.",1424390400,2,414,5.384615384615385
6925336,5,B00RC16T7S,"What a great series!  We didn't know what to expect with the first episode, but soon realized that it was one of the funniest and most intelligent things we've watched in a long time.",1423612800,11,183,4.382352941176471
6925337,5,B00RC16T7S,"I have only seen three episodes so far (thank you MHz International
Mystery channel, and also Comcast for carrying it!), but I can tell you
right now that this show totally, absolutely, brilliantly, rocks.

Crime Scene Cleaner is one of the funniest things I have ever watched.
EVER. Bjarne Mdel, who plays our ""hero"" is brilliant. The writing,
even as translated into English, is hysterically funny. The show is
simply jaw-dropping, mind-numbing, amazing. It is surreal, bizarre,
somewhat existential and laugh-out-loud-at-your-TV funny.

It's about a man (Heiko 'Schotty' Schotte) whose job it is to clean up
the horrid leftovers after a terrible crime has taken place -- for
example the leavings of a murder or a suicide. His motto is ""My work
starts where others pass in horror,"" (which can be interpreted in
several ways). During the course of his job he meets, let us say, some
extremely strange people.... a sweet old lady obsessed with her sofa
(who maybe isn't as sweet as she seems), a grumpy writer whose dead
aunt didn't help his writer's block, and a charming, dedicated,
prostitute.

Schotty is a decent bloke. A sort of Everyman. He's kind and honest. He
turns on the TV to watch soccer at one crime scene (but feels bad when
his boss catches him at it), and at another crime scene when offered a
bribe, he turns it down. He's likable, kind of cute, and goodhearted.

I am told Crime Scene Cleaner is incredibly popular in Germany. I am
not surprised. It is really fun to watch. The episodes are less than 30
minutes and they go by so fast, you're left wishing for more.
(Incidentally, don't turn it off before the credits end).

There are a lot of in-jokes to be found here -- for example, Schotty's
ringtone is the theme for Germany's (if not the planet's) longest
running crime series (""Tatort""). Characters show up from other German
crime shows and make fun of themselves.

The writers are not adverse to making political statements of the
progressive kind. The shrewd adeptness of these proclamations just adds
to the brilliance of the show.

Der Tatortreiniger is perfect. Simply perfect. Watch it if you can.

And MHz Worldview International Mystery -- thank you so much for all
you do! Please show as many Crime Scene Cleaner episodes as possible!

6925343,5,B00RC16T7S,"Stumbled on this comedy on my Netflix while vacationing in Germany. It had no subtitles, but enjoyed it and laughed my head off. The main actor is so good, I could understand what was going on without knowing the language. I continued to watch it to gather German phrases while traveling.... super super hilarious.  Madel is a great actor. An everyman, he reminds me of guys I know, that put in a hard days work and keep their optimism no matter what.  Back in the US, all my german TV, movies were gone.  Too bad, I wish Netflix would continute to carry foreign shows no matter the location, it would expand all of our horizons.  Ordering the DVD with subtitles. Can't wait.",1457222400,,675,4.508196721311475

6925349,5,B00RC16T7S,"This show is one of the best ones I have ever seen!!! My husband and I recommend it to everyone!! Sure the show is in German so you have to read subtitles, but its worth every word. This show is extremely funny, incredibly well written and even thought provoking. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!! I hope there are more episodes in the future, the world needs more Shotty!!!",1453248000,,363,4.432835820895522
6925360,4,B00RC16T7S,Kind of dumb but it is entertaining. The main character sees himself as the good guy that does whats right but then given a bit of temptation he is willing to compromise. I think most people probably fall into that category.,1448582400,2,224,4.487804878048781
6925361,5,B00RC16T7S,"Incredibly Funny !!!

Each episode is about 25 minutes long (perhaps with commercials it's a half hour TV show) made in Germany.

 Crime Scene Cleaner is an incredibly great, original, comedy series, with some of the best writing in any comedy. In fact everything is great the scripts, the acting, and the directing.  There are very few TV comedies that even come close to comparison.
You have to be completely without humor to not laugh your head off.

If you don't want to purchase the video, you can watch this series on MhzChoice (streaming programming), with subtitles, so you can enjoy the original audio, even if you don't understand German.",1446422400,,648,4.8545454545454545
6925362,4,B00RC16T7S,"Interesting series, about as good as I hoped it would be. Surprisingly, there isn't really all that much about crime scene cleaning. Each episode is primarily a discussion between the ""star"" and various people he runs into---friends and neighbors of the deceased, and others, a shaman and even the murderer at least once! It's actually a very ""TALKY"" series, with almost no action. I thought maybe our hero would sometimes solve the crime but actually he has no interest in doing that: he wants to do the job, eat his baloney lunch, get paid and go home and watch football and drink beer.

The funniest episode is the third, which also features a cameo from Burkow & Koenig. He's cleaning one victim's apartment when a call girl makes her scheduled visit. A very cute encounter ensues, only interrupted when B&K show up to collect the ""evidence"" that was left behind in the bloody bathroom.

I enjoyed the 10 half-hour episodes in the box. I do wish I hadn't watched them back to back within a couple of days. A bit too much dosage of an amusing and interesting, but not awe-inspiring series. This is one show that would be more enjoyable watched at the half-hour a week pace, since there is no continuity to speak of and each episode stands alone.",1446076800,4,1248,4.642533936651584
6925363,5,B00RC16T7S,"Who knew the Germans had a great sense of humor? Couldn't start laughing from the second we put the DVD in the player. Fantastic show, can highly recommend!",1442361600,,156,4.607142857142857
6925364,4,B00RC16T7S,"Being a fan of shows like MONK and PSYCH, I went on a search for something similar and ran across this.  I was initially  a bit skeptical when ordering the DVDs because I couldn't  get a sense of the mystery element from the product description or the reviews. What I discovered, however,  was that the mysteries are more existential in nature, but certainly no less enjoyable. In fact, I was truly delighted and impressed at how the philosophical elements are woven into the comedy.

Each episode is about 25 minutes in length. So, I recommend you watch the 1st and 2nd together. While episode 1 is funny and sets up Schotty, our beloved cleaner, as a true professional who is presented with a moral dilemma, it isn't until episode 2 that the shows deeper, more intricate philosophical nature gets revealed. And please know it was extremely enjoyable to me even though I do not have a German background.

SPECIAL NOTE: Episode 3 contains adult material. Plan accordingly.

Also, this 2-DVD Set came marked Disc 1 Episodes 1-5 and Disc 2 Episodes 7-10.  Rest assured ALL 10 episodes were available for my viewing pleasure.",1441584000,7,1122,4.77720207253886
6925365,5,B00RC16T7S,"This is a very interesting and entertaining movie. The interaction of the protagonist with various people he meets on the job often results in interesting discussions.

6925366,5,B00RC16T7S,"Tatort (Scene of the Crime) is a German series featuring 2 Cologne detectives. It's tough, colorful, & hard-hitting. Der Tatort Reiniger (Crime Scene Cleaner) is a hilarious, clever take-off on the original. The anti-hero is hapless & good-hearted, & he runs into a series of quirky people when he arrives to do his job. His wishful creed: we arrive when others flee in horror!",1440892800,,377,4.90625
6925367,1,B00RC16T7S,"static, boring, no pace, so disappointed. One DVD that I feel I should be able to have my money back.
It seemed it could have been produced in the very early days of crime films rather than in the 21st century. In fact, I can't think of one crime series from the 1950s or 1960s that isn't better than this.",1436140800,,306,4.116666666666666

6925392,3,B00RC16T7S,"I wanted to see what a German television comedy was like so I purchased this set. Heike ""shotty"" Schotte, is a thirty-something, proudly working-class male whose job is to clean up after deaths; violent, bloody deaths. Driving the ten episodes is the interaction between his persistent desire to be the best crime scene cleaner in Germany and the family, friends and others he encounters while doing  his job. The offbeat encounters play out most closely to the old Alfred Hitchcock half-hour program. Unlike some other reviewers, I found the humor more lower key, almost existential, though there are laugh-out-loud moments. One of the issues with foreign language programs is that some of the insights and humor fly by those of us who do not understand all the cultural/language references of those who have the language skills. For example, does the nickname ""schotty"" have some significance in German? That said, the 26 minute or so episodes are well-made, well-acted and will appeal to adults who appreciate more than the traditional punch-line driven American style sitcom. There are a small amount of four letter words. This program might be a good learning tool for high school German classes. It is easy to see why those with a greater appreciation of the humor gave four or even five stars.",1430784000,4,1300,5.018518518518518
6925393,5,B00RC16T7S,"Amazingly funny and poignant... Comedy delivered in a series of delightful, light-hearted, yet incredibly thought provoking episodes.

8694767,5,B00RC16T7S,"Just this winter I discovered Crime Scene Cleaner, AKA Tatortreiniger, way up there on the list of cable programing. Very funny and original writing. I find it particularly appealing because the characters are for the most part portrayed as typical north Germans, specifically from the burbs of Hamburg. Typical Hamburg idiosyncrasies, dialog spoken in Hochdeutsch not Plat, and mannerisms. Such characters! Schotty is not just a crime scene cleaner, he's a deep, intelligent, emotional man, at times flawed, at times a child and always broadminded. Every episode brings along with it a wonderful cast of characters. Makes me slightly homesick.
