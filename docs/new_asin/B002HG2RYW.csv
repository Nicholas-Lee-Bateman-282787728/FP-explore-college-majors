8370317,5,B002HG2RYW,"Just finished watching ""Department S - The Complete Series,"" 35th Anniversary Special Edition released by Umbrella Entertainment.
Department S is described in the liner notes, which were written by Grant Taylor, as the series which was the precursor to ""The X-Files"" and ""Jonathan Creek.""
I mildly disagree with that comparison.  If anything, each episode of Department S is playing homage to Alfred Hitchcock - most notably in the spellbinding episode ""The Man In The Elegant Room.""
Each episode of Department S starts out with a bizzare situation - an airplane landing but nobody inside, or the theft of cans of fish soup, or the suffication death of a man in a spacesuit in downtown London, and follows each case to a logical and non-supernatural solution.
Department S starred Peter Wyngarde as Jason King; Joel Fabiani as Stewart Sullivan; and the lovely Rosemary Nicols as Annabelle Hurst - the three agents who made up Department S.
Also staring in Department S was Dennis Alaba Peters as Sir Curtis, who was the British head of the Interpol Department that Department S fell under.  What made this so unusual for a television series in 1968 is that you actually had a black man in charge of government unit.  Of special note, Sir Curtis was British, not an African American.
What the ""S"" in Department S stands for is never revealed in the series.
Now I'm probably going to get in trouble for this observation; but I believe Jason King was actually the first metrosexual and bisexual character potrayed on television.
In the first few episodes of Department S, Stewart Sullivan, though fully dressed, is in Jason King's bed and the two actually share a bed.  In once scene Jason isn't surprised to find Stewart in his bed.  While it's hinted that Stewart and Annabell do have a romantic relationship, even going as far as sharing a hotel room with a single bed together; its actually Jason and Annabell who kiss just once in the entire series.
Department S pays homage not only to Alfred Hitchcock, but also to Agatha Christie as well.  With each case, Jason, Annabell, and Stewart must connect seemingly random dots to solve or prevent a crime from being committed.  The best example is the episode ""The Man In The Elegant Room"" written by Terry Nation.
Perhaps the most intriguing and thought provoking episode which dealt with the issue of increasing longivity is the episode ""Spencer  Bodily Is Sixty Years Old"" where the WHO is trying to discover and contain immortals - close to X-Files territory.
All in all, Department S is a great series and its a shame that Jason, Stewart, and Annabell only had one season of adventures together, though Jason King did get his own spin off series - sadly without Stewart and Annabell.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
