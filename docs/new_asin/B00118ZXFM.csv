8363511,5,B00118ZXFM,"Almost everything has superior quality. I mostly got this for ""Hawaiian Birds"", and ""Betty Boop's Rise to Fame"". They were restored more properly than the previous 30s characters compilation. Although Betty Boop still has the U M&M corp. copyright notice, it still has the Paramount logos in the beginning and end! And they are all restored to perfection! Once again, Thunderbean outdone themselves again! It is not as good as the Noveltoon set, but I got to admit, they still did a good job.",1364601600,2,492,4.869047619047619
8363512,4,B00118ZXFM,"I watched these cartoons as a small child and loved them. However, my very favorite cartoon was not included on this DVD, which was a disappointment. It was called Puddy the Pup, Scat Cats. I'd love to find a DVD that includes that one.",1320278400,,236,4.386363636363637
8363513,4,B00118ZXFM,"Once again, the folks at Thunderbean have done a fine job restoring public-domain material from the Golden Age of Animation. Though most of the Max Fleischer and Ub Iwerks cartoons are familiar, ""Return of the 30's Characters"" features rare gems from Van Beuren (the Tom & Jerry classic ""Joint Wipers""), Charles Mintz (""The Museum,"" directed by Dick Huemer), Walter Lantz (""Making Good,"" an Oswald short animated by Tex Avery) and Warner Brothers (""Boom Boom"" with Porky Pig and his short-lived partner Beans). The primary special feature is a 16mm Castle Films print of Iwerks' ""Balloon Land,"" aptly retitled ""The Pincushion Man."" It's interesting to compare both versions of this cult classic. For collectors, the DVD includes an original 16mm film strip from a Cinecolor Iwerks cartoon - a wonderful touch.",1237939200,9,809,5.230769230769231
