7154560,2,B00WUVRQS6,"Moderately interesting horror movie dealing Nazi fascination with the occult and a suicide mission with regular army troops having to deal with the SS and a female occultist.  If the German army as a whole operated like this supposedly exceptional squad, the war would have ended a lot sooner.

OK, if you like this kind of stuff, which I do, but, definitely not a ""must see.""",1495670400,2,376,4.681818181818182
7154561,3,B00WUVRQS6,"A group of German relic hunters enter a haunted forest in Romanian on a top secret mission even as the Russians are advancing. The nature of the mission is revealed 38 minutes into the film, which was a bit silly, but I just went with it. The events that unfold are discussed as theology by the German soldiers. In this film the German soldiers have various English and Irish accents except for one German which spoke English with a German accent. Okay, its low budget, I understand, but what was with the one Russian speaking Russian?

Now in order to appreciate the film you must realize that the main plot runs in full color while the other-life elements run in washed color. The regular Germans are ""good guys"" while the SS and Russian regulars are bad guys. The main downfall of the film was the deliberate confusing editing.

7154562,4,B00WUVRQS6,"Over all worth a watch, some poor writing here and there, but over all I think I liked it. I liked how it did a good job of portraying the soldiers.

 The Wehrmacht was not a Nazi organization, in fact their symbol, the Iron Cross is still in use today. Most of its soldiers were just that, soldiers. The SS were the real monsters and the movie depicts this well. Furthermore it shows the Russian Soviet soldiers very accurately. The Soviets were pigs and monsters who in fact murdered more innocents then the Nazis. Germany murdered some 17 million, the Soviets were sitting at 23 million.",1508803200,,590,4.556603773584905
7154563,1,B00WUVRQS6,"An enormous waste of time. Although the film was low budget, it was shot and acted decently. However, the plot was silly and contrived and without any real resolution. I watched it until the end, hoping there would be a rational conclusion that made sense. Nada, zero, zilch. Don't waste your time.",1508716800,4,298,4.75
7154564,5,B00WUVRQS6,"I thought it was great. Weapons and uniforms were accurate. A few minor flaws but what movie doesn't have a few?
If you like ""The Twilight Zone"" you'll like this. It's a 3.5 to 4 star flick but i gave it 5 because it definitely doesn't deserve 1 or 2 stars some people gave it.",1508544000,2,277,4.054545454545455
7154565,4,B00WUVRQS6,"Mine is 12th review on IMDb if you wish to read it.  Here are some highlights:
1.  A background in old science fiction *reading* would help in the viewing of this flick.
2.  Ignore the anachronisms as a low-budget flick can't always have an historian handy.
3.  Pay very close attention to the little clues or you'll miss something big.
4.  My real vote is a 3.5/5 but Amazon doesn't offer that.",1508371200,,395,4.430555555555555

7154568,3,B00WUVRQS6,"3.5 stars.  I took off a half a star because of the horrible English annunciation.  It would have been better subtitled.  The movie depicts the SS and the Russians as monsters.  Caught in the middle are a group of seasoned infantrymen fighting to stay alive in the mysterious forest.  I noticed that the German armory was fairly set to period, i.e., mostly MP-40's.  Perhaps I'm mistaken but did that Sargent have a Thompson?",1504828800,,425,4.7534246575342465
7154569,5,B00WUVRQS6,Reminded me of the Bunker horror flick which was a small film done a few years back about some German troops held up in a bunker on the Belgium border close to the end of the war that turns out to be haunted. Not to be confused with the other hand full of Bunker films. But I like that they show the German soldiers as humans and not some cartoon evil guys as the communist were. I also like how they showed how awful the communist armed gangsters were. The SS guys were a little over the top but then they were in real life too. The story was cool and different yet still classic like The Keep. There should be more German supernatural horror flicks set in WW2 it's a good device and Rumania or Hungary are great places to put them in.,1504483200,4,736,4.118055555555555
7154570,2,B00WUVRQS6,I gave this two stars because I watched the whole thing but really it's not even worth two stars. It tells the story of a small group of allegedly Elite German soldiers led by a major on Eastern Front hunting for some kind of Relic in the haunted forest. Predictably the German major is openly anti-nazi witch in real life with a probably got him hung. They send him and his men on some secret mission to get the Relic and send an SS major and a female Professor with them. Turns out he has history with the female professor. The movie tries to make something of the known Nazi fascination with the occult but it never really gets anywhere. I can't really recommend the movie it's just not very good. Too many Germans with English and Irish accents along with Russians that have English and Irish accents. I think somebody was speaking Russian at one time. It is a very low low but apparently they couldn't afford people who could speak the language or at least had a decent accent.,1504483200,2,982,4.430939226519337
7154571,4,B00WUVRQS6,"Wow!. I think I actually enjoyed it. A bit different from ""Out-Post"" and ""Blood Creek"" but they all have the same plot (The master race).",1503187200,,137,4.52

Wow, this movie surprised me.  I was expecting the normal, corny B-movie style, which I love btw, but this movie was a step above that.  The actors did great in their roles and the story, well, let me tell ya -- if ya like that supernatural, weird, horror style like me, this movie is for you. The story was interesting, different from anything else I've seen and will keep you hooked till the end.  Thumbs up to the writer, the director and the special effects guys -- the blood and gore was perfect.  The only thing I wished for was maybe one or two 'sudden scare scenes'.",1532736000,,602,4.348214285714286

8714399,2,B00WUVRQS6,"Yeah, it's a pretty lousy movie.  Good only as something to have on while doing laundry; doesn't matter if you miss parts here and there.  Actually, this is the best part, missing parts here and there!

Oh yeah, in the beginning of the (alleged) movie ""BASED ON ACTUAL EVENTS"" pops up.  Well, World War II was indeed an event that actually happened.",1520121600,,349,4.580645161290323
8714400,5,B00WUVRQS6,A Little slow and low budget. But not going in expecting much mad me really enjoy this movie. You have to live WW2 accuracy and some thing super natural . B budget as it is . I like the characters and small parts as much as i can. its fun if you like ww2 suspense.,1520035200,,264,3.8181818181818183
8714401,2,B00WUVRQS6,"It's ok if to kill some time but not a great movie. By the way, the Tiger on the cover is not in the movie. The introduction to the movie was nonsense. It asserts that the Wehrmacht had no part in the atrocities committed during the War laying the blame solely on the SS. Sorry, the Wehrmacht's hands were bloody, too. At any rate, the acting varied from decent to ""don't quit your day job"". Basically, German soldiers are ordered to take a scientist and a couple of SS guys into a forest to find the ""god men"" who are ancestors of the Aryans (meaning Germanic, as erroneously interpreted by some). If there was an explanation as to why the Germans didn't know about these ""god men"" earlier in the war, I missed it. There are also no surprises. That there is history between the lady scientist and the German commander is obvious. It also came as not surprise that she was the primary villain. The SS accompanying the mission are stereotypical. We are supposed to hate them. One German soldier carries a U.S. Thompson sub-machine gun. Since the U.S. sent more than 130,000 Thompsons to the Soviets I didn't fuss about that since it could have been Lend Lease war booty. Oddly, the medic has a grandfather who is Native American. Apparently, that makes him an expert with the tomahawk with which he whacks a few Russians. The story becomes a convoluted tramps through the woods as they encounter Russians and Survivors of a previous German expedition (who are either mad, dead or aged beyond their years). They find a civilian who had been crushed by a tank with no tracks leading in or out. We later see him die as what looked like a jagdPanther drops on him from the sky--exactly why the god men bothered is not explained nor why they took the vehicle away. Are they encountering time warps...ghosts? I didn't really care. One by one the soldiers are sucked into an alternate reality where they meet their end until we are down to the German commander, an SS officer who takes a licking but keeps on ticking and the scientist. They find a massive stone structure that even a blind pilot could have seen from the air (so why couldn't they just go directly to it? the question is rhetorical, don't bother). There is only one survivor who is later found by Russians aged well beyond his years. Spoiler alert: the movie doesn't end fast enough.",1513296000,,2341,4.562945368171022
8714402,1,B00WUVRQS6,Pathetic.  The movie starts with the map of current German borders as the borders of the 3rd Reich in 1939.  Then it gets from bad to worse.  Hard to find anything that bad anywhere.,1511049600,,182,4.294117647058823
8714403,2,B00WUVRQS6,"The whole tank thing added some comedy that was otherwise an average horror flick. Not sure if the in-fighting and killing of each other was as undisciplined as the average German unit, but it would be nice to think that the Wehrmacht had this opinion of the SS, but I don't think German protocol would have allowed any of this behavior. Most Germans of that era were not the monsters portrayed by Hollywood and propaganda, but it would be naive to believe that most of them didn't know what the fascists were implementing.",1510272000,2,523,4.634408602150538
