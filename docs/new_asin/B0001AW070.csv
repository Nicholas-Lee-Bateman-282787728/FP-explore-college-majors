1985533,5,B0001AW070,"I resent the Amazon reviewer's caustic remarks about the movie, Richard and Steele.  This movie was a true delight from beginning to end.  The dancing was glorious and lots of it.  The songs by this time were old friends.  Incidentally, I've heard the cast recordings of the London, Bway and movie versions.  A few songs were the same in all 3, others came and went, which I thought was odd.  Tommy Steele (35 years ago, can you believe it!) was wonderful as was everyone, it was a little long (2 hours and 25 minutes), but it was always fun and exciting.  I loved it.  Incidentally, the villains were just nasty enough to get their point across, nothing to enrage you, and their comeuppance was also just right, not some scathing triumph.  I found the whole thing a pleasure, just as I did 35 years ago.",1085529600,26,804,4.489655172413793
1985534,3,B0001AW070,"For the longest time I thought I was the only one in the world who could be hoping against hope for a widescreen stereo DVD of ""Half A Sixpence"" and thought it would never happen. I'm delighted to be proven wrong on both counts.
While I had no problem with what looked like a fine visual transfer, the stereo sound seems to be from faded magnetic tracks that have not been restored. It all sounds a bit muted, and in one scene one of the channels has a wobbling-hissing sound underneath the dialogue and music. I just wish they would have gone the extra step to polish the great soundtrack. But still, half a ""Half A Sixpence"" is better than none; this is a lavish, fun, boisterous musical.
Now if they would FINALLY release ""Flower Drum Song"" in widescreen and stereo...Anyone know what's taking so long?",1081900800,14,805,4.52054794520548
1985535,4,B0001AW070,"Contrary to what another reviewer has said, Half a Sixpence was a throughly delightful show on stage, at least on Broadway, thanks to a great performance by Tommy Steele, a charming cast, and wonderful choreography by Onna White who went on to do the choreography for the film version of Oliver! The movie version of Sixpence didn't quite have all the charm of the show, but it does have Steele, who gives his all, a touching performance by Julia Foster as Anne, and Grover Dale from the Broadway cast (who would also appear in the Demy film musical The Young Girls of Rochefort. The production values are pleasing to the eye. I'd say one of the flaws of the movie is the unimaginative choroeography  by Gillian Lynne (who eventually worked on Cats)--I'm not sure why White wasn't available. The movie includes most of the score of the show, but it cuts one of the show's best songs, Long Ago--it's sung briefly by a chorus at the beginning and is also used as background music but it was an important number in the show because it reaffirmed the love of Kipps and Anne.  Having said all this, Half a Sixpence is worth owning because it is an example of lavish filmmaking we don't get to see much anymore. And it's a good musical that for some reason isn't performed very much, at least in the US. I just wish they would have done an interview with Steele about being in the musical. I believe this movie did much better in England than in the US when it was originally released.",1081555200,30,1479,4.4944237918215615
1985536,3,B0001AW070,"""Half a Sixpence"" is the story of Arthur Kipp (Tommy Steele), a destitute young man who inherits enough cash to buy half of London. So what does he do? Raid the music halls for love, life and pleasure in all of its decadence. Co-starring Julia Foster and Cyril Ritchards, this is a high octain piece of fluff that would really have nothing going for it if it were not for the fact that Tommy Steele is about the greatest one man show in show biz. Riddled in the kind of adrenilin rush that would leave every other actor (save Robin Williams) comatose, Steele is the real reason to fall in love with this tripe that, apart from my critique, is a genuinely amusing film.
TRANSFER: Just average here. Paramount delivers a bare bones anamorphic transfer that is at times very clean and solid, with rich colors. However, at other times film grain seems a bit excessive and color balancing leaves flesh tones on the pasty side. There's also a problem with the framing of several shots that appear to have been cropped on the sides. The audio is Dolby Surround and nicely balanced.
EXTRAS: This is Paramount! Not a one...not even a trailer!!! If you were surprised, I'd be surprised!
BOTTOM LINE: Yes to the film. Ho-hum to the transfer. Three cheers for the elegant Mr. Steele!",1081209600,,1271,4.60352422907489

1985562,5,B0001AW070,"Tommy Steele (the leprechaun in ""Finian's Rainbow"") is perfect in this role, so full of energy and enthusiasm he should be twins at least.  The supporting cast and everything else about this little gem are also top-notch.
  The story comes from an H.G. Wells piece entitled, ""Kipps,"" which by itself tells you essentially nothing, but it's one of the funniest stories I've ever read.  It's a natural musical for Tommy Steele, who wasn't even born during the lifetime of H.G. Wells.
  Wells is mostly known for science fiction of course, which he and Jules Verne mostly invented.  Wells also invented the time-machine idea, and of course his best-known stories are ""The Time Machine,"" and ""War of the Worlds.""  The latter may not be, but the former is highly relevant today, well over a century after Wells wrote it.
  There's nothing esseffy about ""Kipps,"" or about ""Half a Sixpence,"" though.  It's a timeless story in which a young orphan suffers from being homeless and overworked, but grows up and inherits a fortune from no source he ever knew about.
  Wells didn't invent the plot, but stole it from Charles Dickens (""Oliver Twist."")  Anyway, having spent and otherwise lost his fortune, Kipps is ready to go back into the workingman's life, when another fortune comes his way, equally unexpected but resulting from his earlier generosity to a friend.  Boy gets girl and good life all in one package.  It's lots of fun and a happy ending.",1396396800,,1443,4.852459016393443

1985570,4,B0001AW070,"MY FAIR LADY was based on George Bernard Shaw's PYGMALION and first appeared on stage in 1956 and was filmed in 1964.  OLIVER! was based on the novel OLIVER TWIST by Charles Dickens and first appeared on stage in 1960, eventually reaching the screen in 1968.  HELLO, DOLLY! was based on Thornton Wilder's THE MATCHMAKER, opened in 1964, and was filmed in 1969.  And then there was HALF A SIXPENCE, based on the novel KIPPS by H.G. Wells, which hit the stage in 1963 and was finally filmed in 1967.  All four plays came out at about the same time and were set in approximately the same period and were extremely well received, but only MY FAIR LADY,  OLIVER!, and HELLO, DOLLY! have gone on to become staples of the theatre, and while the film versions of MY FAIR LADY and OLIVER! received critical accolades and frequently turn up on television, HALF A SIXPENCE did not and does not.

The reason for this rests on the fact that HALF A SIXPENCE was very specifically designed for a particular actor: Tommy Steele, and when it played in London and later in New York both the show and Steele proved a very popular ticket.  But virtually everything in the show--songs, choreography, dialogue, even the use of a banjo--was created with Steele in mind, and without him at the center of the show, it proves very thin stuff.  In 2008 a revival toured the United Kingdom, where the play is still fondly recalled, but it has never received a significant revival in London or New York and, becoming more and more obscure with every passing year, it has never become a significant title in world theatre.

According to most sources, and with the exclusion of a bit here and the addition of a bit there, the film version of HALF A SIXPENCE is surprisingly faithful to the original play.  Steele plays Arthur Kipps, an indentured shop clerk, who is in love with Ann (Julia Foster), a woman he has known since childhood.  But through a series of flukes, Kipps inherits a fortune and, suddenly too good for Ann, climbs the social ladder.  Through a similar series of flukes, Kipps then wastes and otherwise loses his inheritance, sadly realizes that money cannot buy happiness, and discovers that Ann has remained loyal.  It is flyweight stuff indeed, and like most musicals of the 1960s it feels excessively overblown, but the colors are pretty and the musical numbers are enjoyable and all in all it has a lot of charm.

The cast is quite good, including a cameo by Cyril Ritchard and a bit part by young John Cleese, and Julia Foster is appropriately winsome as the long suffering Ann.  But the big noise here is indeed Tommy Steele, and in truth he may be too big of a noise for some viewers.  Steele (b. 1936) is generally regarded as England's first pop teen idol.  He had a significant recording and singing career between about 1955 and 1965, and throughout his life he has had major success on the stage as both actor and director.  But he was much less successful on the screen, appearing as an actor in perhaps a dozen films and television programs, most often in supporting roles.  In truth, like many other stage performers, Steele had difficulty modulating his stage personality to the screen, on which he seemed less energetic than flatly manic.  There was a general feeling that, when it came to the movies, a little bit of Tommy Steele went a long way.

Ultimately, how much you like HALF A SIXPENCE depends on how much you like Tommy Steele.  At about two hours and forty minutes, the film feels overlong, and while all his bright and bouncy energy is fun at the beginning of the film, it begins to feel a bit wearing as the film rolls on.  By the time you finish the second hour you may feel you've had enough of Tommy Steele to last a lifetime, and never mind those last forty minutes.  Still, the movie is well made, well put together, and if taken in the right spirit entertaining in the same excessive, too-pushy way as the Barbra Striesand HELLO, DOLLY.  The picture elements are very good, but the sound could use a bit of a brush-up in spots, and there is absolutely nothing in the way of bonus material.  If you're a musical fan who has never seen the film, give it a try, but don't feel badly if you can only cope with it in half-hour increments.

1985571,5,B0001AW070,I purchased this dvd for a friend who had seen it before and liked it ....wasn't dissapointed with the film for a second viewing.... old style charm... somethibg the newer filmakers don't bother with anymore or don't know how to do anyway...perhaps the film is just a result of the simpler times when it was made,1310601600,,312,4.589285714285714
1985572,4,B0001AW070,"Arthur Kipps (Tommy Steele) is an orphan who's spent the last 10 years as an apprentice in a well-regarded draper's shop (what we might call a dry-goods or ready-made-clothing store) run by the miserly and tyrannical Shalford (Hilton Edwards), sleeping in the cellar with his three fellow apprentices (Grover Dale, Leslie Meadows, Christopher Sandford), trying to dodge his employer's ""'undreds of rules we must all obey,"" and carrying on a correspondence with Ann (Julia Foster), who was his best friend in the little country town where he grew up.  When a chance meeting with flamboyant actor/would-be playwright Harry Chitterlow (Cyril Ritchard) results in the discovery that he had a wealthy grandfather who on his deathbed decided to legitimize him and make him his heir, he can't take it in: the prospect of an income of 1250 pounds a year (approximately $337,000-374,000 in 2009 dollars) is so bewildering that all he can think of is buying ""somethin' I've wanted all me life""--a banjo!  But while being free of Shalford and being able to live as he pleases and buy what he likes is certainly pleasant, he soon finds that money brings problems he wasn't expecting.  Elevated into the ranks of the well-to-do, he has a whole new set of ""'undreds of rules"" to cope with, and even the sponsorship of Mrs. Walsingham (Pamela Brown) and her grown children Helen (Penelope Horner) and Hubert (James Villiers) doesn't make it easier--or pleasant.  He falls in love with Helen and actually gets engaged to her, resulting in a painful breakup with Ann--only to discover that the hypocrisy and high-toned manners of his would-be fiancee and her counterparts aren't for him.  But when he marries Ann and tries to make her happy, he discovers that it may not really be her he's doing it for--and she doesn't seem to appreciate it: she has no patience with what she calls the ""la-di-das"" of ""'igh society"" (""I know what I am...ordin'ry and natural...I just can't abide what's false and sham!"").  Then Hubert, who has become his financial advisor, turns out to have been speculating with his clients' money--and losing it.

Steele, who began his career in music halls, is at his best in big, brash, loud production numbers like ""If I Had Money to Burn"" and ""Flash, Bang, Wallop (What a Picture),"" but perhaps because he actually came from humble roots, he can also convincingly portray the fish-out-of-water ""tradesman"" trying to find his way through the intricacies of Edwardian high society.  His Kipps is a very decent fellow at heart, who doesn't want to hurt anyone but can't seem to figure out how to keep his loyal friends from Shalford's while still enjoying his unexpected prosperity.  Though frank and generous, like many people newly promoted to wealth, he falls somewhat in love with his money and is resolved to not only make up for everything he's missed (which is understandable) but to put everyone around him in the shade; and because he's eager to blend in and be ""a proper gentleman,"" he's forced into a mold he doesn't really fit.  (It does seem a bit improbable that a country-reared orphan living in or near Folkeston would speak with a Cockney accent.)  Yet the movie's theme isn't so much that money doesn't buy happiness, as it is that happiness can be achieved with the aid of money as long as you remain true to yourself and mindful about what you really *need* and what you're just doing to impress other people.  The lavish costumery and settings are an added attraction.  It's unfortunate that the soundtrack is only available on vinyl.",1296432000,4,3559,4.892026578073089
1985573,5,B0001AW070,Most people may associate Tommy Steel with rock n' roll but in this film you meet a professional singer and dancer. For more than two hours you are spellbound by the dancers and many of the songs are well known from the late 60-ties.,1273795200,,233,4.318181818181818

Of course it all turns out in the end.  You won't think this is the greatest musical ever made but it is pleasant and fun with lots of energy.

1985575,4,B0001AW070,"I saw this movie on Saturday and I thought it was good. It was 20 minutes too long. I think Tommy Steele was convincing as Arthur Kipps. Let's also give credit to Julia Foster's performance (one of the women that Michael Caine's character romances in ""Alfie"" in case you didn't know) as Anne. I noticed that the movie is in the same timeframe that ""My Fair Lady"" was. My favorite scene is early on when Kipps visits a stage rehersal (it leads to the song ""If I Had a Banjo"") and it leads to him meeting an actress named Nora (played by Juila Sutton-correct me if I'm wrong); who is in her lingerie and Kipps puts his head on her lap! Then it leads to the musical number and how often do you see a movie today in which one of the actresses (with the exception of Nicole Kidman in ""Moulin Rouge"") dance while wearing lingerie and shaking it in front of the lead actor's face? That scene as a whole was a hoot (an example that ""The Times They Were a Changin'"" in the 1960's). You should of felt my blood pressure drop when Kipps almost married Helen (Penelope Horner) and then feel it go back up again when Kipps breaks the engagment (when that happened I yelled out 'Good! What a bitch!') and goes back to Anne and marries her. A rarity: The lead character gets the girl. Above all, it is a decent movie. It's too bad this movie is not a special edition.",1173657600,4,1352,4.264591439688716
1985576,3,B0001AW070,"If only musical and production numbers could save a musical, ""Half A Sixpence"" is a good example that they can't.  The movie is graced with a batch of nice, tuneful but not great songs, energetic choreography and with pastel colors and pastoral scenery the movie looks good.  But oh the screenplay-adapted from the London and Broadway stage show is a real snoozer. Boring is the kindest word I can think to describe it.

But the title song, ""All In The Cause Of Economy"" ""Money To Burn"" ""If The Rains Got To Fall"" and ""Flash, Bang, Wallop"" are the highlights of the score and are lavishly mounted and the remaining eight numbers range from good to fair.  The music only fills 60 minutes of the movies 145 minute running time-so when I play my DVD I skip to the musical numbers and avoid the mind-numbing screenplay.

Tommy Steele the star is both an asset and a liability to the movie.  He is an all-around accomplished performer-he can sing, he can dance and he can act-he can even play a mean banjo but on screen he over-emphasises his virtues and comes across as manic at times.

So as long as the movie is singing and dancing everything is fine but unfortunatly that dreary screenplay is wrapped around them.",1123545600,2,1212,4.583333333333333

8009480,5,B0001AW070,"Admittedly, I did find this 1967 relase, based on H.G. Wells' novel, ""Kipps: The Story of a Simple Soul"", to be a bit overdrawn, but deligthful for children.
  The prologue of this story, directed by George Sidney, finds us in the English countryside of the late 19th century, where two childhood sweethearts, Arthur Kipps and young Ann (an appropriately cast Jeffrey Chandler and Deborah  Permentor) are about to part because the recently orphaned Kipps has been assigned as an apprenticed to  a London department store owner. Ann finds a sixpence on the ground, and Artie insists on keeping it because as a girl, her clothes have no pockets. Kipps gets into trouble for being late for his ride to the orphanage. We follow his journey through the English countryside to London, where his new boss, Mr. Shalford(Hilton Edwards) promises to make the lad work his hands raw, acclamating him to his tightwaddish Efficiency Economy System.
  Soon, it is 1906, and we see the now-grown Kipps(the toothy and irrepressible Tommy Steele) sleeping in his bed in the store basement, then awakening, then to have a pleasantly toned, but doleful conversation with the department store cat, Edwin,there for the purpose of chasing mice, then preparing for  work with his buddies, the begoggled Buggins(Leslie Meadows), the flirtatious Pearce(Grover Dale, who appeared with Steele in the Broadway stage eversion of this  story), and Sid(Christopher Sandford), who is a Marxist.
  All four complain about the inequities of their situation as drapers in the song, ""All in the Cause of Economy"", including inadequate pay, no savings, no pension plan, and the fact that Shalford even sends them to church on Sundays whether they want to go or not, which at that time, would have been less contraversial, and they note the rumors that Shalford's wife is neglected.
  The female employees, Flo( a pert Julia Sutton),  plump, red-haired Edith(Carole Walker), and golden-haired Victoria(Elaine Taylor) join them for inspection, and soon they bein their busy day.
  Not long after it ends, Artie receives a letter from Ann(Julia Foster, sung by Marti Webb) that her employer is moving  closer to London, and that she wishes to see him again.
  Their reunion at a beachside amusement part is a charming affair, during which Artie gives  Ann half of the now-severed sixpence they found as children as a lover's token, recommending that they hold their halves of the token and think of each other when separated. They  sing and dance gracefully when performing the title song.
  Artie hopes for more dates with Ann. But when the upper-crust Walsinghams, who are among Shalford's best customers, including  Lady Walsingham( Pamela Brown), and her son, Hubert(James Villers), discuss the woodworking class run by their daughter and sister, Helen( a cool and beauteous Penelope Horner), Shalford volunteers Kipps for it, putting a monkey wrench in Arthur's plans.
 Before he can go, and eccentric playwright named Harry Chitterlow(Cyril Richard), crashes his bike into Shalford's store, injuring Arthur, but informing him of a sizeable inheritance left by his grandfather.
  This results in their  going to a music hall called the Old Methuselah to celebrate, and Kipps meets the performers, most notably, a sensuous Laura Livermore(Aleta Morrison). When Chitterlow tells the others about  Kipps' new found wealth, a discussion about what the others would do with great wealth leads to the extensive number""Money to Burn"", and Kipps ending up a little soused. His fellow employees, who followed Kipps and Chitterlow in the music hall after returning from their outings, join them in the raucous revelry. But soon, Shalford puts the brakes on it and sends Kipps to the woodworking class where he has a fateful encounter with Helen Walsingham.
  The next day, a hungover Artie encounters an irate, Ann who was stood up by previous night's events, at a seaside resort.
  The gossip of Shalford's female employees had led Ann to believe that Artie has been unfaithful.
  Through a series of events, Kipps leaves Shalford's employ to enjoy his newfound wealth, and viewers learn, amid the site of courtly estates( including  Winston Churchills' birthplace, Blenheim Palace), the Henley Regatta, the influence of the coldly aristocratic, and overly righteous Walsinghams, Lady Botting(Jean Anderson), and lively numbers, including one that reveals his playfulness with children, will have in showing Kipps what matters most in life, amid traditional British class-consciousness.
  This was one of three films that introduced America to 50s Rock'n' Roll singer, Tommy Steele's lively, amiable personality in 1967, the others being ""Finian's Rainbow"", and  Disney's ""The Happiest Millionaire"" .
  As a tribute to him, in time for his upcoming 80th birthday, it would be a delightful film to air on American televison, and introduce to a new generation of children.",1479427200,,4926,5.249360613810742
