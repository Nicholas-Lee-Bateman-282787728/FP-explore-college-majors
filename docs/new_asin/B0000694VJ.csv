It's great science-fiction and goes along with the Emeraldas setting.  Check it out!!",1374364800,,260,4.711111111111111
7964923,5,B0000694VJ,"This is a good series and this volume introduces many characters in Leiji Matsumoto's universe.  That is one of the things I like about this series, it connects different series such as Gun Frontier, Galaxy 999, and Captain Herlock.  The story is quite interesting and keeps you guessing. If you are a Leiji Matsumoto fan buy this series.",1268870400,,338,4.810344827586207
