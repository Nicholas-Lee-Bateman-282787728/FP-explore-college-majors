8249009,5,B00133F418,"Oki when i first here about this anime I did not now what to expect but I was a bit suppressed in may good an bad ways and i think you guys will be to the story is like this
The heroine of the story, Taruto is believed to be the legendary Kinka princess. She often is found goofing around and talking with her master, Iori, who she admires deeply She says ""meow"" (""nyan"") after almost every phrase she says, though she is the only cat who does this And her master Iori is very gentle but easy-going. His hobby is making all kinds of sweets and foods, and he is very good at it. He is very affectionate towards Taruto, but, since he is a human, cannot understand her and sometimes frustrates her when she is trying to communicate with him. He is smitten with Anzuko but she shows no interest in him whatsoever. and that's it. The show it self is a bit plain and after  a bit you will now where it goes but it got its moments to and you will laugh your head off but i think the guys who maid this did not now what to do whit it or where to go whit it and its a mix a comedy/adventure and some characters pup out of the blue and you don't now what and way or what was the point of them showing up any way. Oki to mack it short it's  a good anime for maybe younger viewers but you should have fun watching it to the english voice actors are good and the dvd itself is done in a real good way whit some good extras like songs done by the japanise main characters in cosplay.
Its a good anime whit some funny good moments but did not reach in my opinion the full potential you need to buy it and mack you own mind but the time you spend on watching it want be wasted and you will enjoy it so go a head and do so",1346457600,,1705,3.910662824207493
