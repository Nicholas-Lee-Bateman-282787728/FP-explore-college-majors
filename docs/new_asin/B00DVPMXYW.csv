5859823,3,B00DVPMXYW,Last seen 1959. Still enjoyable and better quality than I expected. Fun film and Pat Boone's lovely velvet voice  a thrill to hear again. I was surprised at how much Gary Crosby reminded me of Bing.,1407801600,,198,4.5
5859824,4,B00DVPMXYW,"They did it!  The folks at 20th Century Fox got this on DVD in a full-color, pristine copy with plenty of songs for fans of Pat Boone and Tommy Sands.  If you are a collector of youth musicals, you must own this gem.",1405900800,,216,4.0
5859825,5,B00DVPMXYW,This has been a favorite of mine forever. So glad it finally became available in DVD. Pat Boone at his best!,1397174400,,108,4.190476190476191
5859826,4,B00DVPMXYW,"A beautiful film full of songs and beautiful colors! Unfortunately, The DVD is pan and scan. Only the titles are non anamorphic letterbox.",1396483200,4,138,5.043478260869565
5859827,1,B00DVPMXYW,"What a great film this was in Cinemascope and stereophonic sound.  Exactly the reason you should steer clear from this, another shoddy Fox Archives release.  I sure hope Twilight Time comes out with a Blu-ray release of this, ""The Best Things in Life Are Free"" and ""April Love"" - they seem to be the only home video company that gets things right.",1389398400,7,347,4.580645161290323
5859828,3,B00DVPMXYW,"In 1958, after the ""success"" of ""April Love"" and the controversy of Pat Boone's kissing on screen (and beefcake), he does kiss Christine Carere and have his shirt off in the locker room and wears gym shorts several times.  Again the songs of ""Mardi Gras"" are by Sammy Fain and Paul Francis Webster, but none are particularly memorable, even Pat couldn't get a hit from them.  Added to the cast are Tommy Sands, Gary Crosby, Dick Sargeant as Pat's fellow roommate cadets.  Sheree North turns in the most memorable performance and is great in her few singing and dancing numbers.  She is perhaps most noted for """"How to Be Very, Very Popular"" in 1955. She plays along as Ms. Carere's assistant to Fred Clark who is once again very annoying as crass representation of Ms. Carere as her agent or manager. Ms. Carere plays a French film star in Hollywood who falls for VMI military academy cadet played by Mr. Boone while at the Mardi Gras in New Orleans.  As directed by Edmund Goulding it all becomes rather listless despite being filmed in Cinemascope and Color by Deluxe.  20th Century-Fox Cinema Archive once again presents the film in pan and scan ruining any chance to Goulding's compositions for the Cinemascope widescreen process to be appreciated.  Also repeating from the success of ""April Love"" the year before, Winston Miller worked on the screenplay, this time with the help of Hal Kanter and together they worked from a story by Curtis Harrington.  It's a pleasant 107 minutes, but could have been better than it is.  I'm not sure why Pat Boone did such a turnaround in his next feature, but one can only speculate.",1381276800,5,1625,4.73404255319149
5859829,1,B00DVPMXYW,"If you are another irritated DVD buyer of FOX ARCHIVE DVD-on-demand,then please read my data under ""COMMENT"" in reply to a very pertinent essay by ""Noel"" regarding the dreadful pan and scan DVD of APRIL LOVE.

Those individual comments relate perfectly to the further low-standard release of an otherwise very entertaining film, MARDI GRAS from 1958, which is also another Pat BOONE favourite which should be in CINEMASCOPE and not pressed from an old Video master of standard screen shape.

Buyer beware.

Once again, the old TV print, on hand, will have to do after waiting so long for a quality DVD in the original correct ratio.

Will FOX ever take notice?

5859830,4,B00DVPMXYW,"Fox has done it again. Instead of keeping the ""Cinemascope"" format, it has used the 'pan and scan' version that was made for tv broadcast. They should have gone back to the original negative and made the transfer, instead of short changing the buyers, most of whom have widescreen tvs.",1379203200,10,285,4.72
5859831,4,B00DVPMXYW,"This is not exactly a review. I enjoyed the film when I first saw it and did again when I received the dvd. Nice musical comedy romance....but I have one complaint and I figure it ought to be said. The artwork on the cover of the dvd indicates it as a Cinemascope film. It is not. For some reason, Fox decided to release it as an 'altered' edition 'formatted to fit your television screen. In other words, the opening and cloisng titles are widescreen...but the film it self is Pan & Scan.

There was no indication unless you checked the back of the wraparound cover the very very tiny small print.

This is my big complaint about a fun musical comedy film partly on location, it seems with a nice zing or two at Hollywood. It also features Barrie Chase, who was Fred Astaire's dance partner, as well as soloist, on his television specials. She blew me away when I saw her saw in this film and she stills does.

An enjoyable escapist musical. But...if you are expecting to get the full 'scope image, forget it. Caveat Emptor!",1376438400,20,1025,4.441489361702128
5859832,5,B00DVPMXYW,This is another I enjoyed again.  Saw it when originally released.,1434240000,,66,5.0
5859833,3,B00DVPMXYW,Review is based on when I actually saw the movie in a theatre.  The DVDs  received from Amazon and on re-ordering would not play.,1432166400,,129,4.333333333333333
5859834,5,B00DVPMXYW,"Although there's been much negative discussion regarding the pan and scan print of 'Mardi Gras' from movie buffs on the Amazon network, I must say that, although it is minus 'the edges' this movie was, and is, an enjoyable part of our social history of its time (1958) when the majority of film fans were more pure-of-heart and the world was a much kinder place to inhabit.  So in a way we should be grateful that we have this 'squared presentation' to watch whenever we want to.  And that must at least get a positive tick. Maybe Twilight Time will release an anamorphic Bluray in the future.

Despite the non-Anamorphic CinemaScope print used, the image is absolutely pristine and the Color-by-Deluxe is gorgeous being bright and colorful, just like a Mardi Gras should be.  Another bonus is that, although it is 4x3 ratio, it has directional sound as did the original CinemaScope release - so if someone is on the left of picture, the sound comes from the left side speaker and also the same on the centre and the right channels.  On a large front projection screen it looks and sounds wonderful.

Back in 1960 I travelled with Pat Boone when he was in Australia for concert appearances, and his character and persona was a great delight to see, projecting all that was good in the young folk of that era.  One of the nicest entertainers I've had the pleasure of working with.  I saw him drinking his glasses of milk (as he does in 'Mardi Gras') when the media was interviewing him at press gatherings while the rest of the room were all getting blotto.

I for one can heartily recommend this movie to classic movie fans who love nothing more than to escape back to that magical musical era of  the 1950s.  Go for it it guys!",1432166400,,1728,4.541935483870968
