This is listed as region B/2, but I got a region A blu-ray.  However, it was a single disc: just the blu-ray.  It is not the BR/DVD 2 disc set.

But the blu-ray itself is glorious.  Great music, incredible mix- highly recommended.  The video does suffer from the ADHD editing w/ way too many/ too quick cuts.  But the music sounds spectacular w/ SW's excellent 5.1 mix.",1487635200,3,395,4.47887323943662
