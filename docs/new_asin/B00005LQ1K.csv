1623097,4,B00005LQ1K,"This was the first yoga tape I've ever bought. I've gone to the gym and taken yoga before and really liked it, but I wanted to find a challenging enough workout to do at home. This tape was it! It's great for the beginner to intermediate and the instructor is a nice-girl-next door personality. I found the workout to be challenging, and just when the thought ""is this ever going to be over?"" crosses your mind, it is just that-over! I think it's a great workout in the 45 mins it takes. I hope they come out with another tape soon.",1012003200,6,532,4.2772277227722775
1623098,5,B00005LQ1K,"This is a great video in my opinion.  Her instructions are easy to follow and her voice pleasant.  Her video is a good replacement to my yoga class when I can't make it. She is good for beginners and intermediate yoga students.  I really feel that anyone starting out can do this video without much difficulty, yet with some challenge, and it is still challenging for continuing yoga students.  It may not be enough for advance yoga students though.",1009065600,,449,4.6455696202531644
1623099,4,B00005LQ1K,"I just got this tape yesterday.  I watched it first before I actually worked out with it;  I really didn't think I would get that much out of it.  It was a challenging workout, but I didn't break a sweat.  The instructor is very knowledgeable, and explains all the moves.  If you're an experienced yogi, this tape would not be for you.  If you're a beginner like myself, this is a great starting tape.",1008288000,5,401,4.351351351351352
1623100,2,B00005LQ1K,"I would not call myself an advanced practitioner of yoga but I have been practising for a few years.
I was really hoping that this tape would be a more rigorous workout than it was.
Although the instructor was very clear and easy to follow, i really wished that there were more sequences and that the class would move a little bit faster.
I would recommend this tape more for yoga novices and not for intermediate practitioners who are looking for a more challenging workout.",1006732800,14,475,4.6
1623101,5,B00005LQ1K,"In a word: perfection.
I'm a 30-something professional who has been practising yoga for over five years now. When I purchased my Crunch-Fat Burning Yoga video, I was looking for a challenging workout that I could squeeze into my hectic work schedule, and I found it.  Crunch-Fat Burning Yoga gives me a full-body workout in only forty minutes.
The workout is great, and the instruction is even better. Sara Ivanhoe's attention to detail and articulate instruction is unlike any other instructor I've ever worked with.  I honestly believe that my yoga practise has improved.
If you're shopping for a new fitness video, I highly recommend Crunch-Fat Burning Yoga.",1005782400,10,661,5.111111111111111
1623102,4,B00005LQ1K,"Whew, what a workout!  I did this today and did I sweat!  I try to practice yoga 4-5x's a week, usually power yoga, and I like to mix it up with tapes to keep from getting bored.  If you have yoga experience you'll know these poses, but they're linked in a way to make it a ""workout"".  You willfeel it in the upper body, lower body and especially the abs!  If you've wanted to try yoga but were leery of the ""mysticism"" this is your most pragmatic choice.",1000857600,43,455,4.125
1623103,5,B00005LQ1K,"I loved this tape!  I thought the instructor was motivating and a real person.  Fit without being too intimidating.  She explains all the moves really well and reminds you to breathe in sequence, which I found very helpful.  I didn't think yoga could be ""fat burning"" but I was sweating and energized at the end of the workout.  Plus I was sore in all the right places the next day.  I really like the Crunch series of tapes because most of them are 30 - 45 minutes which is alot easier for me to squeeze in to my day.  This tape will become part of my regular schedule.  I highly recommend it for beginners and intermediates.  It probably wouldn't be suitable for advanced yoga enthusiasts.",1000684800,332,691,4.464

1623105,4,B00005LQ1K,"Overall this is a quality Yoga video.  The instructor is much less annoying and condescending in this video versus Crunch the Joy of Yoga (although I actually like that workout better.)  This workout is not particularly difficult, so I am not sure I agree with the ""fat-burning"" aspect to the title.  However, it does provide some good overall flexibility and strength work.  She spends a lot of time on lunging poses so if you need flexibility in your harmstrings and quads this workout will feel good.  I hike a lot and like doing this workout a day or two after a hike to stretch out my legs a bit.",1074470400,4,601,4.477064220183486
1623106,3,B00005LQ1K,"Crunch's Fat Burning Yoga mimics Yoga by speeding up traditional poses, as many Yoga-for-weight-loss programs do, but this one fails to provide the gentle stretching essential for any exercise program. And since Yoga is supposed to be stretching, I debate the use of the word in this routine. I have Fibromyalgia and have been doing Yoga for over a year and have never hurt myself...until I tried to keep up with this video. Within the first five minutes of the routine I pulled the muscle in the back of my thigh.
There was also a lack of meditative effects, which is also key for Yoga. It's the benefit I most appreciate.
The workout did, however, raise my heartrate at a comfortable pace, so I assume it would help in weight loss. I would not recommend this to anyone other than the youthful and the fit who are looking for variation in their workouts.",1073088000,3,855,4.594771241830065
1623107,5,B00005LQ1K,"As a Yoga practioner of over 7 years with a large and growing library of yoga videos/DVD (over 70) I am always curious to see the way different instructors put together a yoga practice along with their various teaching styles.
 This tape was a pleasent surprise because the other crunch video ""Joy Of Yoga"" fell a bit short for me, though it's not bad by any means. I've always thought that Sara Ivanhoe was a very capable and dedicated teacher but this is the program where she really shines.
 The routine is extremely well put together. The poses build gradually starting with simpler movements that warm you up and gently take you into the more challenging versions of the poses from one series to the next.
 She has a student who demonstrates modifications which is always quite important for a program like this where you may have a person who has never done yoga before or who may have physical limitations.
 This is a very thorough routine which leads you through a wide range of motion and also incorporates a really wonderful flow.
 My only miniscule complaint would be that I prefer a longer guided relaxation before the final seated pose, but of course one can always just shut off the program to extend their relaxation and then put it back on to finish it off in sitting. This in and of itself wasn't a big deal because there is still at least some semblence of relaxation (which is treated gratuitously in many programs).
 I would highly recommend this for someone looking for a flowing yoga practice that is very easy to follow.
 Also, when your ready to move on to a wonderful intermediate practice I also recommend Sherri Baptiste Freeman's ""Power Of Yoga"" which is available on Amazon as well (see my detailed review).
 Namaste",1072051200,3,1745,4.6797385620915035
1623108,5,B00005LQ1K,"I have this tape and love it. Sarah Ivanhoe, the host, is great. She's very real and normal, and talks in a conversational manner. There is another woman in the room (along with all the usual backup exercisers) Natascha, who does an easier modified versions of the excercises, which is a great way to ween yourself into yoga. I'd never tried any yoga before, and now I'm twisting and triangle-ing away with no problems! Sarah's  catch phrase is ""if it's not fun, you won't do it. And the only way to burn fat is to do it, and do it, and do it"". I think that's great! It's a very realistic approach. The exercises are well explained, and not very strenuous. You finish feeling refreshed, alive, a little sweaty, but not overly drained. It's a great morning workout, or an off-to-bed thing. I can deffinately see improvement in my flexibility, and I know my body awareness is much better. I'd recommend this is a flash for anyone looking for an easy and fun intro to yoga. I just wish Sarah was on OTHER yoga tapes too!",1067299200,2,1017,4.467741935483871
1623109,4,B00005LQ1K,"I bought this thinking it was for beginners like it said, but if you never did yoga before and are not that flexible its not for you.  Just couldn't do have the stuff on the tape.",1062720000,2,179,3.9722222222222223
1623110,4,B00005LQ1K,"This is a good workout for those who find themselves easily bored by yoga and are interested in a more active practice.  While not at the pace of power yoga, this workout moves quickly through the use of sequences:  several poses are combined together in a flowing sequence, and rather than holding each individual pose for any length of time, the entire sequence is performed and then repeated several times.
The workout begins with instruction on breathing using the simple mountain pose.  The first sequence involves mountain pose, standing forward bends, and chair pose.  After this warm up, a longer sequence follows, containing lunges, push-up pose, simple backbends, and many repetitions of downward dog.  For each repeated sequence, a slightly more difficult variation is introduced, and by the end of this series, your arms and shoulders have gotten an intense workout.  A series of twisting lunges comes next, followed by some basic standing poses such as proud warrior, triangle, and side angle pose.  Again, these are done in a sequence that flows quickly from one move to the next.  A short abs section caps off the workout:  after a few boat poses and seated backbends, there are also two Pilates-like exercises for the midsection.  Finally, the practice ends with some brief seated stretches and an even briefer relaxation pose.
Instructor Sara Ivanhoe is completely non-intimidating; she uses language such as ""wiggle your fingers and toes"" and ""you might want to take it up a notch.""  She places strong emphasis on breathing and enjoying the workout and de-emphasizes perfect form.  Her yoga instruction is completely Westernized, with little evidence of the more mystical/mindful aspects of yoga practice.  Sara's cues are detailed enough for those new to yoga, and the program is appropriate for beginners, especially with the modifications provided.  However, some prior familiarity with basic yoga postures might be beneficial, and it should also be noted that this is intended to be intense and energizing rather than a relaxing practice.  At 45 minutes, this program provides a nice change from traditional weight-bearing strength workouts while still offering the opportunity to work on toning at a more moderate pace.",1059609600,,2242,5.240896358543417

AS FOR BEGINNERS INTRIGUED ABOUT YOGA, GOOD CHOICE.  I BELIEVE THERE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER METHODS OF BURNING FAT IN THIS WORKOUT.  IF YOUR ADVANCED, I WOULD SKIP.",1058745600,,493,4.788235294117647
1623112,4,B00005LQ1K,"This video was what I used for the first time I ever attempted yoga and, after being slightly discouraged at my lack of skill during the first few times, I have now advanced to a stage where I actually look forward to doing yoga, thanks to this cassette.  It's a great toner, especially for arms (usually a difficult area to trim down for me) and abdomen. And I very definitely find myself working up a serious sweat.  Sara Ivanhoe's (cool name, I must admit) extra-calm demeanor can be somewhat annoying at first but you get used to it and afterwards even learn to appreciate it.  The cool-down period could have been a little more extended.  After mastering this cassette, one can probably move on to a more advance workout.",1056412800,,726,4.604651162790698
1623113,1,B00005LQ1K,This video is very slow and certainly not fat-burning.  The instructor is the most annoying I've ever found in an exercise video.  I am not a yoga expert but an intermediate and found this too easy and not motivating at all.  Don't waste your money.,1055289600,15,249,4.488888888888889
1623114,5,B00005LQ1K,"I really enjoy this tape.  I used to take a power yoga class - which of course is the best way to do yoga - and when I had to quit, this was an excellent substitute.  The instructor gives very clear instructions and is easy to understand.  Also, there is one participant who does modified moves, which is very helpful when you don't feel like doing the tape at its full intensity.  Most of my wokout tapes have only been used once or twice, this has already been used a lot.",1055289600,,474,4.175824175824176

When I started again a few months back, I wanted minimal impact exercise with a lot of stretching for flexibility as well as a flow series that would get me sweating. Crunch's Fat Burning Yoga did the job! It doesn't make you sweat as much and the poses are for those who are more or less knowledgeable about yoga basics but you can easily follow Sarah's instructions and if you practice in front of a mirror, you'll manage to adjust your posture correctly. It's a good everyday workout for those days when you're neither too lazy nor too energetic. I do this 3x a week. Nice!",1055203200,,625,4.396551724137931
1623116,2,B00005LQ1K,"I was really looking forward to using this video, but once I got it I was disappointed.  The video doesn't offer much of a workout, and I found the host to be annoying.  At the end of the video viewers are taken through a series of sit-ups, which are good for the abs, but not at all yogic.
For anyone looking for a good yoga video, I would recommend the MTV Yoga tape.  The host is great and it moves at a faster pace, offering a better workout in my opinion.",1054166400,3,460,4.032967032967033
1623117,4,B00005LQ1K,"True, this may not be the best yoga video for someone who's badly out of shape, but the instructor is great, and if you're able to touch your toes, you should be able to do most of the moves in this video.  The work out is very well balanced.  In three days I could feel an increase in flexibility, it two weeks I could feel myself stronger, and trimmer.  I would have liked a longer relaxation pose, but I just do it anyway while the video finishes.  ENJOY!",1053907200,2,458,4.170454545454546
1623118,5,B00005LQ1K,"This video is a GREAT, low-key yoga workout. It is good for beginners and newcomers. Most of yoga poses demonstrated in this video focus on stretching the legs and back muscles (e.g. lunges, side stretches, triangle pose, downward dog, warrior pose, etc.). At the end of the workout, Sara concludes with a six minute ab workout, stretches, and a brief relaxation meditation.
GREAT: Sara starts off this program by focusing on your breath and making you aware of your breathing. This is key in yoga! This program also provides alternative poses so you can start gradually and at your own level...you will actually see another instructor demonstrating these alternative poses. This is great and helps you to modify the program! The video shots are great--you can clearly see all of the poses demonstrated!!
BAD: I think the title may be misleading because it is not an exercise yoga program or an aerobic yoga program. So you may be burning fat but not in the traditional sense.
COMPARISONS TO OTHER VIDEOS:
 (1) If you like Gaiam/Living Arts Yoga videos then I would consider this the next level to advance to. If you ever used/watched the Living Arts ""Stress Relief"" Yoga program then you will recognize some of these poses. And will probably enjoy this rountine.
 (2) There is no comparison Bryan Kest's power yoga videos. Kest is for people who are more advanced, want a more challenging yoga workout, and a longer routine.
Moreover, I think all of the videos I mentioned are great. So choose the video that best suits your needs, your level of ability, and fits into your schedule. The Living Arts series is certainly for beginners (programs are usually 20 minutes and easy), the Crunch series is probably the intermediate level (programs are usually 30-40 minutes), and try Bryan Kest's Power Yoga videos if you want something challenging (50 minutes).
RECOMMENDATION:
 Buy the ""Crunch - Perfect Yoga Workout"" on DVD which includes this program + another yoga program entitled the Joy of Yoga.  You get two yoga programs for the price of one.  Enjoy!",1053388800,24,2054,4.9077809798270895
1623119,5,B00005LQ1K,"Sara Ivanhoe (really cool name notwithstanding) is tops in explaining not only the way a yoga position is done, but the why of it as well.  Fat Burning Yoga is challenging without being impossible.  Sara guides you through the entire process and adds modifications for the novice.  Also a plus, the presentation is terrific.  Quiet and restful but flexible enough to let Sara's playfulness shine through.  There is no better yoga workout.",1052092800,2,438,5.027777777777778
1623120,2,B00005LQ1K,I thought this would be doable since it is for burning fat.  I am trying to lose weight but couldn't even get through the tape because my body didn't bend the way hers(a skinny person) did.

1623122,5,B00005LQ1K,"I have tried tons of different yoga tapes, and this is the first one I've actually stuck with. It's not extremely difficult, but you feel like you get a great yoga workout in only 30 minutes.

1623124,5,B00005LQ1K,"I have done numerous yoga videos over the years, but this one by far has to be one of my favourites. For me the principle reason why I think this is such a  motivating video is down to the instructor. She is extremely motivating, in a very calm and reassuring way. She has an extremely soothing sounding voice which still motivates you into pushing yourself that extra mile. In fact you feel as though she is right there with you.
Of course, the moves and sequences are great and excellently explained. Don't be fooled if you watch the video through first. It looks fairly routine and basic, but it really does stretch you. I had  aches and pains in all the right places the next day, but felt completely rejuvenated immediately after doing the video.
Of course, the video only lasts 45 minutes so is ideal for fitting into a busy day.

1623127,5,B00005LQ1K,"This is a great yoga tape -- probably the best one of used in terms of providing a great workout with a nice, pleasant instructor and setting. Sara Ivanhoe is a likeable instructor, and she structures the sequence so that you're always challenging yourself, but you never reach the point of feeling like you can't go on. I've done this tape with friends at all levels, and it has been great for everyone since they demonstrate modifications and more advanced stages to keep everyone working but not overworking.
Don't be intimidated by the ""Crunch"" label -- this is still real yoga, albeit less spiritual than other forms. But not all of us need to know the name of every asana or know which chakras we're affecting. Sara still gives a great background on yoga overall and highlights the different benefits of each pose.
I have several DVDs from Gaiam/Living Arts (the Yodney Yee and Patricia Walden yoga folks) and from Yoga Zone, and this one is by far my favorite for length, full-body workout (you feel this workout everywhere!), and balance between the spiritual goals with fitness realities.
Do yourself a favor and get this tape!",1042588800,17,1136,4.801020408163265
1623128,4,B00005LQ1K,"I must say that when I first seen the video without doing the exercises I didn't appreciate it. The poses are basic yoga: downward facing dog, plank pose, cobra and simple back bends for floor series. For standing series: triangle pose, warrior poses and modification of side stretch poses.
The beauty of this tape and Power yoga in general is that the flow of movement along with proper breathing helps to create energy and burn fat. I never though I would sweat that much from such simple poses.
The instructor is helpful and calming; she reminds you constantly to breathe, which is quite important because usually you tend to focus on perfecting the pose and neglecting your breath.
Note that you need to practice with the tape for two to three times before you can do it smoothly and without looking into the video.
I would recommend this tape for beginners and even for intermediate yoga students. I have been practicing Hatha Yoga for a year and half and find this tape helpful. I would've however liked it if it was a bit more challenging.",1038700800,19,1046,4.65945945945946
1623129,4,B00005LQ1K,"I did this for the first time this morning. I'm  fairly experienced at Yoga, intermediate. So I knew the asanas. Actually only a few of the very basic asanas were used in this video.
The instructor is excellent. She takes her time and explains each asana. But more importantly she  stresses how to breath while doing them. This is really very important.
For those who have some physical limitations or are beginners, there are modified poses demonstrated.
This video is good for beginners or intermediate. More advanced would find it far too slow I imagine. It's not exactly Power Yoga but it's very close to it. I can't swear it burns calories but I would be surprised if it didn't. For a more challenging workout try Brian Kest's Weight Loss video. It's about the same length and will certainly make you sweat more. At least it does me.
But having said that, I find this video fun and a nice change of pace. I do feel it gives me a good workout.
The beginner should know ""Down Dog"", ""Plank"" and a modified ""Cobra"". You also should know ""Triangle"" and ""Warrior 11"". I found her flow in Warrior a bit confusing so I did it as I was used to and came out no worse the wear. That was the only asana that I thought she could have done a bit better. I also would have liked a more advanced Cobra. She also did the Boat pose which is a challenge for me as I have spinal problems or the sort that make this almost impossible for me to do.
Toward the end you do some ab work, which is good. The cool down and rest period is too short and not enough emphasis is put on stretching the legs like you'll find on Baron Baptiste and Brian Kest videos.
The music is exceptionally good and fits the workout. It's relaxing and yet invigorating. I highly recommend this tape for someone wanting a change of pace or just beginning. For more of a challenge, consider Bryan Kest...",1038268800,27,1860,4.372832369942197

It treats yoga like an aerobics class.

The moves are very basic, and there's very little flow - the whole quiet peacefulness of yoga (which is it's real power) is lost in the too-quick movements. It seems as if what the instructor lacks in difficulty she tries to make up in speed.
And let's talk about the instructor, shall we?  She seems knowledgeable, but her weird vocal lilt and incessant giggling is just downright irritating.  Her instructions are relatively good, but the moves are so basic that shouldn't be too difficult.  I'd recommend the Buns of Steel Power Yoga if you're looking for a good yoga workout, or any from the Bryan Kest series.",1029110400,7,716,4.75
1623135,5,B00005LQ1K,"I just received this video yesterday and I was eager to try it out this morning. The moves provided me with the focus I needed and I came away feeling refreshed. The instructor made sure that proper breathing was the first priority which is so important in making any yoga movement more fluid. The downward facing dog pose was featured throughout which had me feeling slightly uncomfortable in the neck area. However, I believe that is due to tensing the muscles instead of relaxing and breathing. Yoga takes daily practice and with this tape, I believe I will become more grounded. I highly recommend Fat Burning Yoga !",1028764800,,620,4.75
1623136,5,B00005LQ1K,"I have just started doing yoga, and this was the first tape that I've bought.  I can tell you that this workout, combined with a healthy eating routine, has helped me to lose 5lbs. so far (and I *just* started!).  I recommend this tape if you are a beginner like me.  The instructor's cheerful attitude, and modified versions make it easy to get the routines down, and you can actually enjoy the workout!",1027382400,5,404,4.506849315068493
1623137,5,B00005LQ1K,"I really enjoy this workout.  The instructor does her job well without being condescending, intimidating, perky, or otherwise annoying.  The routines are simple to follow, and there is a lower-level option for those who can't keep up.  I am a yoga novice and perhaps the least coordinated person on the planet, and I found this workout to be completely within my level of mastry.  So, you do not have to be a yoga guru to do this workout.  It leaves me feeling relaxed and energized.  I'm not sure about the fat burning claim --I'm not sure my heart rate ever gets that high-- but I do find this to be an enjoyable workout.",1025568000,10,623,4.469026548672566
1623138,5,B00005LQ1K,"This Yoga video is great.  I decided to get it after I read all the good reviews and was not disapointed.  Sara Ivanhoe is a fantastic instructor.  You don't need to be straining to look at the TV screen the entire time because her explanations are very thorough and you can follow along by just listening to her.  Her voice is soothing and calming as she leads you through the poses.  We all know the health and relaxation benefits you get from Yoga, this video has that and a good workout that makes you sweat!  What is also great is that you can do this whether you are a beginner or advanced.  There are modified poses for those who want more or less of a challenge.  At the end of the video, there is a wind down and brief meditation leaving you feeling relaxed and rejuvenated.  This is the complete Yoga workout that you'd hope for.",1022889600,16,839,4.326923076923077
1623139,5,B00005LQ1K,"I'm 50+ in fairly good shape and love this tape.  Although I'm not as flexible as those on the tape, I'm getting better and even though I will never be able to touch my head to the floor while sitting cross legged, I do what I can and it works wonders.  I always feel great when I'm finished.  Would highly recommend it  -  I did have some familiarity with basic yoga moves before, but it could be done without that.",1021852800,3,416,4.15
1623140,4,B00005LQ1K,"I bought this video because I love Crunch's Joy of Yoga. While I do enjoy this video, and there are some different moves in it, it still reminds me of the first video. I agree with another reviewer that it will be a slower day video. That's actually fine by me, as I enjoy flowing poses, but feel yoga should be more relaxing. I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't that unique. I will rotate between this and Joy of Yoga though, as it's great to wake up in the morning too.",1018915200,3,471,4.075268817204301
1623141,5,B00005LQ1K,"Yoga has greatly enhanced my life, it can yours as well.  Burning fat is important and you'll definitely do it with this workout! Sara Ivahoe's philosophy is, ""If it isn't fun, you won't do it. And the only way to burn fat is to do it, and do it, and do it."" Sara is a special instructor who succeeds in making this vinyasa (free-flowing) workout FUN! Yes, FUN! She reminds us to be aware of our breathing and that the QUALITY of the breath directly affects the MOVEMENT. The workout moves at a wonderful, even tempo--not too fast or too slow; also, it isn't too easy or too difficult.  FAT-BURNING YOGA is enjoyable for the beginner to intermediate because you can follow Sara (intermediate) or her friend, Natasha, for any needed modifications.
The movement sequences are logically choreographed to be very smooth which maximizes the flow and the breath. Before the final relaxation pose, there is some heavy-duty abdominal work that is short but very intense and gratifying to complete. Sara's cool-down is a real TREAT that makes it all worthwhile and will bring a smile to your face and joy to your heart.
I'm so happy to have finally found an exercise that I truly enjoy doing and feel completely rejuvenated afterwards! A extra special benefit I've noticed is that yoga alleviates my back pain and helps me sleep better. My back knows the days I do yoga and the days I don't. FAT-BURNING YOGA is a fun, challenging workout that I highly recommmend.

The class moves fast enough so I feel like I am really getting a workout. The other ""fat-burning"" yoga tapes go too slow!  I am still trying to find another tape just so I can have some variation, but I always come back to this one...",1016755200,4,408,3.8333333333333335
1623145,4,B00005LQ1K,"This yoga tape has a good combination of experienced participants for inspiration, beginner modications for those building up their yoga skill & a very soothing, encouraging instructor in Sarah Ivanhoe.  The basic postures are included (could be better explained) & once they are grasped in a few repetions they are built upon in sequences of moves.  I find this makes it interesting & very fluid.  It makes the time go by quickly!  I like that it does not involve a lot of props, (as I find in other videos), because for me these distract & make the session disjointed.  I enjoy the extra ab routine (about 5 minutes) at the end of the tape (again there are modifications provided).  My only small issue (for the 4 out of 5) is the relaxation instruction at the end of the tape.  I'd like it to be a little longer & to include more relaxation instruction.  Overall a great experience for me!",1015459200,6,892,4.566037735849057
1623146,5,B00005LQ1K,"This is a great workout, just the right length as one reviewer mentioned. I agree with everyone who likes the instructor--I remarked to my husband that she was the best fitness video instructor I'd ever seen, helpful, low-key and pleasant. I also appreciated the use of another participant demonstrating modified moves. Although I've done yoga on and off with books and magazines, I'm by no means great at it, yet I was able to do most of the moves unmodified. It felt great and worked up a sweat, yet I did feel energized afterwards. Curious to see how sore I'll be tomorrow. It's interesting that some people said this was way too hard and others said it was way to easy--for me it was just right!",1015027200,4,699,4.555555555555555

The instructor is down to earth and although I have some experience in yoga and the terminology commonly used this video explains each pose (asana) without ""dumbing down"" the movements.

The instructor is really likable and the routine is nice and varied and goes at a good pace (Not a lot of pausing to talk which is good). I work out a lot but am pretty new to yoga. She gives good instructions for beginners. I found this quite challenging but was able to do it all the way through with the modifications she shows for beginners. My legs and arms are definately working hard. And my whole body feels so good after I do this video (especially my back), energized, rejuvinated, and stronger. Love it.

This is a wonderful introduction to yoga.  I don't necessarily work up a sweat, as the others reviewers have said, but I can feel it in my muscles after I'm done.  The instructor works slowly, her cuing is excellent, and there are variations offered for beginners.  When I'm finally able to run again, I'll still continue to use this tape, it's a lot of fun & an excellent workout!",1013385600,6,540,4.59375

It's challenging and I am going to have to work at it to get my balance right but I had just gotten home from a 6 hour shift at a busy restaraunt waiting tables and felt like collapsing in bed but instead I popped in this tape and afterward felt energized-so much so that I went grocery shopping at 10pm! I would not recommend this video if you are seriously overweight-I think it would be too hard on your knees. But if you are in ok shape this tape is GREAT! The stretches for the thighs are so incredible I never realized how much stress I hold there. The instructor is great. I love her realism and there's no annoying people in the background making stupid woooing noises. everyone is silent. the music is slightly elevator but light some candles, turn of the flourescent lights and enjoy.

Too perky will drive me crazy and too slow is not up to my abilities.  Sarah Ivanhoe is just right.  Very calming voice without being mind numbing and she explains everything perfectly.

I was afraid to try a fat burning video for fear I could not keep up. I rented the Candlelight Yoga video from Netflix and loved it. I bought this video too, but was still intimidated, maybe I could not do it. I finally tried it and love it. The pace is just right. The poses are not impossible, in fact they incorporate options for any person's conditioning level. And the music is nice. There is no religious aspect to this video, and I like that.

7944293,4,B00005LQ1K,"I have used this video many times over the 6 years that I've owned it and, while I will agree with the reviewers that state this is not a pure yoga practice, it is a decent workout for beginners or those of us that may not be as focused on technical correctness.  While I do tend to vary widely in my own fitness level, for the most part even at the times that I'm most out of shape, it is do-able.  Yes, the instructor does chatter on a bit, but that seems a positive to me as well--it helps me make sure my form is correct.

Having said that, it is definitely not a spirit-renewing sort of practice.  At completion, I feel that I've done a decent job of moving my body, but I do not feel trance-like as I would after a David Swenson practice.

I would consider it an intro for a person interested in beginning yoga...you will get an indication of what the poses are like physically, but you may not experience the delightful mental and emotional side-effects of a true yoga practice.

Instructor cues  for breathing are inconsistent, about 50% of the time there is no cueing at all. Her cues for poses are very poor, she mostly mentions if the pose is hard to do or not. You cannot follow her without looking at your TV screen, and if you do not know which muscles to flex or stretch, 50% of the time she is not going to tell you. The program does contain two levels, for more and less flexible. Yet, transition from one pose to another is so quick that you can barely get your balance. Try Jane Fonda Yoga instead, or (and) Kundahlini yoga.",1127520000,2,656,4.248
