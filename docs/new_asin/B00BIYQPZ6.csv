8569177,5,B00BIYQPZ6,"I started buying these old Chipmunks DVD's late last year from different places.  I daughter loved them and the music in them gives me a throw back to the 80's.  It was a great way to introduce her to something that I enjoied as a child.  Then when the new 3D Chipmunks started coming on the Disney Channel a couple months ago she was so excited because she had already been introduced to who the chipmunks through these DVD's.

Also, if you are looking to get some of the new 3D episodes on DVD this is NOT it these are the original episodes from years ago.  The music is awesome.

This DVD has over an hour of music and laughter with The Chipettes and,  Alvin, Simon and Theodore! In Cinderella, Cinderella, The Chipettes star in the retelling of the classic fairy tale! Overworked Brittany dreams of her mean sisters & stepmother and finds herself living the fairy tale, complete with Fairy Godmunk (Simon) and a handsome Prince Charming (Alvin). This DVD also has 3 extra adventures included, The Chipettes: The Glass Slipper Collection. Episodes: Cinderella, Cinderella - 22 min Sisters - 11 min The Chipette Story - 22 min NEVER BEFORE ON DVD Operation Theodore - 11 min
