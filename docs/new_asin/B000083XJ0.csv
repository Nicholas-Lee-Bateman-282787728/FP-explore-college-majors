7978812,5,B000083XJ0,What I expected. Nice interpretation of Tango via Ballet. Nice music. Would have loved to hear tango music in DTS. But it was nice.,1378857600,3,131,4.5
7978813,3,B000083XJ0,"I have the tape, put out in 1984 (?).  I wanted the DVD for better quality and ease of skipping to different sections of the ballet.  Guess what, they didn't put in any ""chapters"", just copied the tape onto a DVD.  You have to fast forward to go anywhere.  As the ballet is 1 hour long (I am in it!), that seems pretty cheap on their part to not put in chapters.",1374192000,2,362,3.986111111111111
7978814,4,B000083XJ0,I love the tango and I am learning how to dance the tango at a college level.  be prepared for a difference in style but not technique.  All the tango moves are there but they have a ballet flare to them and have some solo parts that are ballet.  This is due to the fact that it is a ballet company putting it on.  If you want something that is a little bit different than basic tango I would recommend this DVD. The dancers are great and their footwork in the DVD is absolutely amazing. Enjoy!,1105660800,11,494,4.114583333333333
