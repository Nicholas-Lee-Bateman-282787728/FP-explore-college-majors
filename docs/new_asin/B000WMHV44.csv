The movie centers around a buxom blonde searching for another missing blonde who may or may not have been kidnapped by a Satanic cult in the middle of the desert.

2987105,3,B000WMHV44,"The ridiculous title obscures this movie's past title, which was Mark Of The Beast.  This movie is about a woman's death from a Devil group, and her twin sister's determined drive out into the desert to find the truth.  This movie features cloaking mysteriousness, probing acting, and rugged desert scenery.  While it's attractive seeing the woman wearing her panties and running around the desert at the end, her amazing killing of the pursuing Devil group members causes the movie to lose the strongly-realistic seriousness that was present earlier.  Overall, this is a well-made movie that presents a realistic social possibility.",1259539200,,633,5.3

This is also educational with insightful commentary on satanism and strong feminist undertones.
