8507417,1,B00701QRJK,"I saw this movie a long, long time ago and it was a decent movie filmed in places I had visited. I bought a VHS copy of it sometime in the 80's. The copy was terrible. Some scenes were so dark they were little more than a sound track. Ten minutes of the original film were edited out, probably with a hatchet. When I saw this ""digitally remastered"" DVD I thought I would finally get the real deal so I gladly paid the high price. OOPS.. What I got was the very same VHS copy from the 80's transferred to DVD. If you've seen this movie take a few minutes and try to remember it. You'll have a better time remembering than trying to watch this DVD. I got ripped off but I consider it the price of my education.",1395878400,9,708,4.064285714285714
