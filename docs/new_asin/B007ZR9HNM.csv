5115392,5,B007ZR9HNM,"A complete set, no duplicates, color and sound  are as good as when the original program was on tv.  Thank you.",1393977600,5,111,4.238095238095238
5115393,4,B007ZR9HNM,Many of the DVDs have broken plastic pieces where it's supposed to keep disc in place. Without them in tact the discs are slipping all around inside their cases.,1388534400,2,161,4.586206896551724
5115394,4,B007ZR9HNM,"This was a wild show that still manages to shock the viewer. The quality of the dvd set isn't stellar but it also isn't terrible. If you love the show then you will get everything you want out of it.

The discs

The discs come nicely as each of the originally released seasons are shrink wrapped together. There is no 'special packaging' for this set but that is hardly a disappointment.

If you are buying this as the whole series then you probably don't care too much but the people who have released these sets decided that for season five, six, and seven they will be releasing two sets per season. This makes little difference if you are buying the whole bundle but it just feels wasteful.

The price

The price for this set is a bit high as far as complete sets go today but the final season only came out a year ago so a high price might be expected. The final season volume one + volume two costs roughly sixty dollars combined right now.

Image and sound.

The image quality is sub-par. Fortunately, that doesn't matter for a show like this. There may be an explosion or two in this show but nobody is really going to be too disappointed with the presentation. I am only mentioning it to temper expectations. The image simply doesn't look much better than the original rendering.

The sound itself is pretty hollow. The dialogue is audible but the surrounding sound simply isn't all that rich. Again, nobody is really tuning in hoping fir Dolby digital surround sound.

Extras

There are some extras for the first three seasons but then they go away entirely. It's a shake when you think there had to have been more content to share, but as long as you are getting every episode might not be that big of a deal.
The extras we do get are mostly labeled 'featurette' and aren't all that exciting. Most of them just celebrate the most popular scenes from each specific season.

Conclusion

This is a large amount of content. There are so many episodes and that is well worth the price of admission. The image/sound quality is below average but that shouldn't take away too much enjoyment.

If you love this show you will love this set.

My review is four stars rather than five due to the lack of effort surrounding the image/sound and does not reflect feelings for the show itself. The show quality was able to allow me to feel very strongly about giving this four stars.",1384905600,8,2378,4.5
5115395,5,B007ZR9HNM,I really love Melrose place it keeps you entertained with every episode from start to finish you watch one episode and you can not wait till the next episode.,1381363200,5,158,4.482758620689655

5115398,4,B007ZR9HNM,"Say what you want, but the 90s delivered tv series en masse like no other decade since did - and Melrose Place is just another money maker for Aaron Spelling who really had the midas touch for tv shows.

Love it or hate it, this overly dramatic borderline soap opera is perhaps on of the most iconic guilty pleasures of its time. The cast was amazing and while the plot lines were sometimes ridiculous - especially in the last two seasons - it's still an epic show :)",1467072000,,467,4.306818181818182
5115399,5,B007ZR9HNM,"As advertised and quick delivery.

5115401,5,B007ZR9HNM,I have watched this series so many times over the years on tv and I know most of the quotes and one liners by heart. I'm glad the price for the complete series has became very reasonable after waiting a few years for it to drop. It is definitely great to revisit MP and all of the residents of this hot and edgy prime time soap opera!!,1458000000,5,335,4.014925373134329

5115405,5,B007ZR9HNM,"Melrose Place is a series created by Darren Star and produced by Aaron Spelling. It follows a group of 20-somethings living in an apartment complex called Melrose Place, in Los Angeles, California. We get a look into the lives of the residents.

The show stars Thomas Calabro (as Dr. Michael Mancini), Josie Bissett (as Jane Mancini), Andrew Shue (as Billy Cambell) and of course Heather Locklear (as Amanda Woodward)

I never imagined watching a soap opera kind of show but I was very glad I did. I fell in love with Kimberly's tricks, Amanda's attitude, Sydney's need for attention and everything else tied into the show!

Melrose Place features great writing and plots that'll stick with you. How could you not watch? It has relationships, explosions, asylums, murder, and of course a lot of revenge. This is a can't miss series!",1452470400,4,832,4.886524822695035
5115406,5,B007ZR9HNM,Love this show. So happy to own and be enjoying these DVDs. It gets better and better starting about halfway through season 1. No problems with DVDs or packaging.,1451865600,,162,4.620689655172414
5115407,4,B007ZR9HNM,"These all arrived OK but I was expecting a sort of boxed set. They were just shrink wrapped together. Melrose Place is not my cup of tea but my wife and her friends decided to get together and watch the whole series together. She is happy.

5115413,3,B007ZR9HNM,"When American TV turned permanently horribly bad. After they realized the preachy social moralizing (gun control, racism, etc) ""Designing Women"" approach wouldn't work about 3/4 of the way through the first season the show became addictive. It was at first a guilty pleasure. The show was had a very quick turn of events that kept you glued. You had to be if you were going to keep up. It was pretty entertaining. But as you approached season 4 you realized it had no redeeming qualities and was just pure trashy TV. The characters even started making fun of themselves doing horrible awful things. They all had at that time slept with each other and countless others. They had all been in 1) a mental hospital or 2) jail or 3) both. The plots were rehashed. The characters were tired. The show was just a joke. The only reason I watched this show was because I lived in a foreign country and was starved for Americana. This was on but several years old in re-runs. So I watched it. Got hooked. But I decided to catch up on what happened after I returned to the US. I was disappointed that nothing happened. There are only so many times you can have billy and allison not marry because of their whiny self centeredness that you realize you are being jerked around emotionallyjust for the heck of it.",1437955200,,1299,4.531914893617022

8523449,4,B007ZR9HNM,I never caught this show when it aired so I took a chance in ordering it. I have to say the first season was rather painful as it was awfully goody toe shoes for my tastes that I almost stopped watching it. Thankfully I can be stubborn because it started to take off and I have begun to appreciate the stories as well as the characters..........,1490227200,,345,4.242424242424242

8523451,4,B007ZR9HNM,Great series.  The DVDs were in good shape but the boxes they came in did not hold up well.  The DVD holders broke (on several seasons) and the DVDs moved around.
