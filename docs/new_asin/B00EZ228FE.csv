5957663,5,B00EZ228FE,"What do you say about a series that involves high school girls and tanks? Hmmmmmmm, well first of all you have the sensha-do (tank) program at a school that originally let it go, the captain of the team who wanted nothing to do with tanks, a student council who revived the program at their school and drafted the poor girl, newly made friends who for various do want to join the program, mix them all up with great characters from teammates to opponents as well as bonding times out of the tanks make up this light heartened story of underdogs and these girls come out, dare I say it, ""Guns Blazing"". Not much of a description I know, but I did not want to give a lot away and I talk a lot! Girls und Panzer is a wonderful series and I enjoyed every minute of it when I ran across it on Crunchyroll and I think you will as well!",1381363200,,829,4.15527950310559

5957666,5,B00EZ228FE,"Thought that would get your attention...LOL.

Ok first off I usually like to iterate, that I don't repeat the editorial summations. ""THIS IS NOT GUN FU"" If you want guns go watch Gun Slinger Girls (which is a good but slow drama - it's an anime that must be watched to the end to make a good decision on......sorry off topic) This is about TANKS. This is not a war story, this is a Sports Competition.....with tanks , in tanks, about tanks(""Tanks we ride them"").

What is Girls und Panzer - An all girl's middle school tankey club. Why wouldn't you want to watch this .......LOL. The design of this series is basically a play on words so to speak. Ken-do - ""Way of The Sword"" and Sensha-d ""the way of the tank"". Both start with a bow and end with a bow.....This is ken-do but in tanks(group style).

Check out [...]

So back to the Title - ""Panties WHAT"". Its lines like this that make the world go around. In the second episode(i believe) Miho, Saori , Hana and Yukari , girls of the Middle School Tankery club go look for an abandoned tanks. Yukari the tanks fanatic yells "" Panzer Vor!""  and the clueless Saori misunderstand the statement and replied ""Panties what"". Luckily, soda didn't shoot out my nose at the time. At that point the series was sold. Each episode is like this. It has plug or reference to things with tanks, about tanks. Another plug was  for the green polygon tank arcade game way back when - Battlezone (1980 video game). The destruction of a Ferrari  F40 - I cried laughing so hard. 2 plugs to Kelly's Hero's movie ""oldball - woof woof"" and when they show the blurb of the Sherman shooting the back end of a Tiger with a paint shell.....hmmmm, the girls did this also but no paint shell. There are references for ancient wars, commanders, a quote from Sun Tzu and other galore. I won't give away any other surprises.

All the schools that are represented have one nations WWII modern tank corp type. Example,  St Gloriana  school consists of the British. Then there's the American, Russian, German and Italian.  However your beloved Oarai Girls school has the rag tag, mothball mixed tier 1 tanks(P.O.S)......and they kick butt......LOL

This is an off the wall anime with detailed renderings of the tanks, tactic and etc. Anyone that has any interest war history, war movies and etc should watch this.

Girl's und Panzer is a comedy unto itself and is a must. Anyone that wants to down play this as factual.....ok yea it's not 100% real....it's a freek'n anime....it's made up. What anime is real. You think gravity defying hair and gigantic boobs that can knock people out literally (tangent point) is real.....get real people. Acme would be out of business because the coyote would be dead.

This is an add to my collection, though my only concerns is that Sentai will be doing the english dub. hopefully they won't screw this up like they did with the Horizon 2  english dub. So thats my 2 cents have at it folks.

EDIT - OK I have to retract my statement of the Oarai girls in tier 1 pos tanks. Sence I started to play World of Tanks I can see what is in what tier.

Update Note 11/21/2013. I just wanted to say to those that buy the Bluray set not to freak out when you go to the episode list and see only 12 list when 15 episode are listed from Crunchyroll and other anime streaming site. The missing 2 are under the ""Special Features section"" they are the Introductions 1 and 2 eps. The reason I know this is that I got my preorder early (not from Amazon but a different distibutor). For those that want to cry BS.....Also in the Special Features is the Japanese TV Sport and Promo and under the ""also on bluray"" trailers for Kokoro Connect, LA Storia della Aracana Famiglia, Btoom and Say I love You in that order.

So I watch it all yesterday and was not disappinted (well maybe with the english dub. the VA didn't do the series justice). Watching this on a Hydef 47"" LCD screen in 1080p was fantastic. I thought the detail to the tanks in SD on crunchyroll was good. I think you guys will be just as impressed. Worth every dime I spent.",1379548800,12,4073,4.451612903225806
5957667,5,B00EZ228FE,"This show is simple amazing! I can't really say anything bad about this show. It was everything I love about anime in one show.  If you love shows that have teams pairing off against each other, and watching how the underdog somehow figures outs a way to over come odds then you will enjoy this. The characters are easy to like, the comedy and action is fantastic, the cuteness is off the charts, and the way they take real life tanks and use it in this fictional setting is superb. On a scale of 1 to 10 it is an easy 10.",1378857600,6,522,4.117647058823529
5957668,5,B00EZ228FE,"I own a few books about WWII tanks and have watched many documentaries on WWII tanks. Needless to say, I really enjoy things about tanks! Especially in video games or TV shows! That being said, I also play an online game that has everything to do with these things called, ""World of Tanks,"" and it is how I first heard about this anime. Some people absolutely hate it, but many more absolutely love it!

I first saw this show being streamed on Crunchyroll (an anime streaming website) and after hearing about it from some fellow online-players, I decided to give it a shot. For the first two episodes, I honestly couldn't stop laughing at how ridiculous (but entertaining) the concept of little Japanese high school girls shooting each other in tanks was. However, by the third episode not only was I hooked, but I suddenly was taking the show a lot more seriously! The concept is pretty far-fetched, admittedly, but the show is an absolute blast! And honestly, I don't think I could even use a calculator to add up all of the ""far-fetched"" anime plot lines out there! In comparison, this one is pretty damned believable.

Just a few of the amazingly well-drawn tanks you will see in this anime are: Pz. Kpfw. IV, Sturmgeschtz III Ausf. F., M3 Lee, Sherman Firefly, Elephants, Pz. Kpfw 38(t), Cromwells, Jagdpanthers and even a Maus!. The list goes on and on and you can check under the Wikipedia entry for this anime for a few more of the tanks you will see. Fact of the matter is, however, that you WILL NOT find a movie, cartoon, television series or any type of viewing material that will show you more tanks in action than this show does! Okay, I must admit, the Military Channel's, ""Greatest Tank Battles"" probably will have this beat, because it is a historical depiction of tanks and tank tactics and not one meant solely for ""entertainment purposes."" But barring that... this show is FANTASTIC and definitely wins the medal of most unique and entertaining anime!

Amazingly enough, the tanks are drawn perfectly and exactly like their real-life counterparts. And the show will even help you learn a little bit about tank mechanics! They talk about penetration, distance, modifications and armoring among other things. Also, one might assume that the anime would be predominantly about the dramatic lives of Japanese high-school girls with a sprinkle of episodes regarding tanks... however, this is not so! Tank battles and character development are interwoven deeply and I would say that they both appear about 50% of the time and at perfect, well-timed moments.

This show got surprisingly big in Japan and they even have plans to import it this year to NA/EU (Dec. 3rd 2013 by Sentai Filmworks). It is pretty short, with only 12 episodes, so it isn't a huge time-investment either. Already, more OVA's and even an entire movie are being worked up to follow the huge success of ""Girls und Panzer""!

Honestly, there is no reason not to like this show (unless you don't like anime or don't like tanks; failing those however, NO REASON whatsoever!). Although some obvious reality of the show has to be cut to make for an entertaining anime series (and really, they do this in board games and video games ALL the time), it stays as true as possible to real tank battles and they use real tank tactics! Not to mention, I loved the ""World of Tanks"" plug they did in the show, which is apparently where the creator got the inspiration for it.

I would recommend this to just about anyone who is either interested in tanks, anime, both, or is wanting a truly unique series! It's an addicting show, with interesting characters and a great balance of drama and action! But I must point out that if you are not easily entertained, that you *MUST* stick with it until Episode 3, where the first tank-battle actually occurs before you begin to make judgments. Even then, I would watch the ""Battle with Pravda (Ep 7)"" (an amazing and epic battle) before throwing out words of resentment and discouragement to others who might otherwise be genuinely interested in this show. This show really is great, but you have to give it an honest chance!

With some pretty epic tank battles, its incredible originality and enjoyable plot line, I definitely give the, ""Panzer Vor!"" for ""Girls und Panzer!""  \( ^_^)/

Edit: Oh! There is also a video of the dubbed version from Sentai Filmworks! You can find it by going to Youtube and searching for, ""Girls und Panzer Sentai Filmworks."" -- Honestly, the propaganda reminds me a lot of 'Rosie the Riveter,' but with tanks!!!",1378684800,67,4555,4.755696202531645
5957669,5,B00EZ228FE,"4 times in 3 weeks. That's how many times I saw this show, and I'm not even a tank enthusiast! Three times on Hulu, ordered the Blu-ray and saw the dub for my 4th once it arrived. This is without a doubt my favorite anime; from the voice acting to the story, the characters and the action, there wasn't a single moment of the experience that I didn't enjoy! No ecchi (Not that I'd have minded either way) so unless you have a rule against seeing girls naked from the shoulders up, parents can find this to be a show the kids can watch too! Anyone looking to start their experiences in anime should definitely start here.

My only issue was with the dub. A lot of the voice acting in English seemed either rushed on some lines or didn't convey the feelings the characters should have been experiencing. While Mako Reizei's Japanese lines in particular were soft spoken, the subs helped you understand what she was saying. The dub, on the other hand, used even quieter voice acting and has no English subtitles at all, so her lines sometimes became unintelligible. I also didn't much like the way they pronounced certain words, particularly turning the honorific ""-chan"" from Chah-n into the same way we usually say Jackie Chan's name. Not that these things can be helped. The dubbers have to match the mouth flaps to their own voice work, so they can be forgiven.

Please watch this. Drop everything you're doing, buy a copy, then get the OVAs, the movie, and the mangas. You won't regret a thing!",1493769600,,1496,4.557620817843866
5957670,3,B00EZ228FE,"GUP could have been a great show, But sadly it is plagued by sloppy plot points,cliches and a single season. The pacing of the show feels rushed.. Characters barely meet and then seem to become best friends overnight simply for the sake of the plot. Example Miho is invited to lunch by 2 characters seemingly at random and then by the end of that lunch they are friends who's loyalty cannot be questioned, Zero build-up, Zero development,nothing to bring them together, nothing to hold them together just a plot convenience friendship. The 4th member of the group stalks the trio for no other reason than plot,she is promptly invited to hangout and soon becomes a staple of the group by episode 2. Episode 2-3 is also where they meet their driver and this is the only member of their tank crew that has a legit academic reason (Benefits given for joining) to even be in this little tanker club. Many of the characters are cliches. You have: Ms. Bubbly, Ms. Serious, Ms. Authority, Ms. Lets-do-our-best, Ms Natural/Prodigy. Ms. Intensity etc etc etc. Overall Girls und Panzer is a nice concept that while enjoyable to watch is in desperate need of actual believable plot for it's characters.",1492473600,,1190,4.781553398058253
5957671,5,B00EZ228FE,"Cute and a lot of fun. It is one of those anime, where you need to leave the real world at the door. It has sever World War 2 tanks from America, Germany, Japan, and Russia. So if you are a history buff, you will recognize all of the tanks in this series. It is easy to see why there are only 12 episodes, but it does not leave you hanging and like some animes winds it all up in 2 episodes by killing everyone off. It is fun for all ages, no excessive violence, no nudity, and not any really bad language. It was good clean fun. This is not my usual run. I prefer Ghost in the Shell, Appleseed, and those type.

5957672,4,B00EZ228FE,"Simple anime with girl schools in competition tank battles. The tanks look great, and there are many other interesting pieces of equipment, like the jeeps and the aircraft. Lots of details in clothing, food, etc. My favorite thing to love and hate is the aircraft carrier schools - the scale is way off, but the idea is cool - more than tank battles as a school club, these aircraft carriers make me interested in this world. And the townspeople are ok with tanks tearing through their property? The tank cafes and shops are also pretty cool. The battles in regular old neighborhoods are my favorite, but there's a nice variety of locations. The girls come in a dizzying variety, with some overlapping designs, like the flower girl and sleepy genius are a bit too similar. But there is some attempt at character development crammed into this short series. It's a simple anime with good Japanese voice acting. And, surprisingly, I can't really think of any fanservice, besides a public bath or two. Good and I'd like to watch more.",1486857600,3,1030,4.759776536312849

If only I could get someone to do a movie on the SS Amerika 2 campaign and have the artwork in this Girls Und Panzer that would be great. They do the facts for tanks pretty good here. Of course far fetched as 7 tanks are going to beat 18 stronger Kuromarie (German basically heavy tanks ). But I enjoyed how they did it. The last battle scene between the Tiger and the Panzer 4 that was cool. The one thing I did not like was that you saved somebody and lost your honor and you did that for it was the thing to do but you weren't sure if it was wrong or right.

5957703,5,B00EZ228FE,"While the concept of high school girls battling in tanks is an odd one, to say the least, Girls und Panzer does it quite well, ensuring that viewers can easily relate to the girls and their rivals, who battle it out for the championship just like other school athletes, ensuring that we enjoy seeing their efforts from beginning to end.

The plot is somewhat standard sports fare- a relative underdog team, with a talented but less than confident leader, must defeat all its rivals and win the tournament, but it's done fairly well. The various characters have their own reasons for competing, which helps the viewers get invested in their struggles and root for them.

Miho is a relatively interesting protagonist who changes a great deal over time, particularly becoming somewhat more confident in herself and willing to command, without losing sight of who she is. Her friends also have their own struggles to deal with, and develop nicely over the course of the series.

The secondary cast is fairly large and diverse; its size is a natural result of how each of Oarai's five tanks requires 3-6 girls to crew, and the team gets larger over time, and its diversity is a result of a broad variety of clubs and groups of friends being recruited. Unfortunately, many of the groups are limited to one or two personality quirks per individual.

Oarai has an interesting collection of rivals, from the laid-back and friendly Kay from the American-themed Saunders to the egotistical and ruthless Katyusha of of the Russian-themed Pravda. Such characters could have used more screen time, though, especially Miho's older sister Maho, who becomes significantly more likable and interesting in light of Little Army showing more about her true motivations and relationship with Miho. Additionally, Oarai's match against their second opponent in the tournament, the Italian-themed Anzio, is skipped entirely, and only shown in an OVA.

The tank action is quite entertaining, and appropriately suspenseful for the protagonists, who tend to be outnumbered and overpowered in most of their battles. The ""flag tank"" rule in most tankery matches- defeat a single tank with a flag to win- gives the Oarai girls a fighting chance in spite of their disadvantages, and effectively keeps things suspenseful.

The series is somewhat short, at around 12 episodes, and while the series resolves most of the plot threads, there are some that could be expanded on further, such as Miho's relationship with her family. Here's hoping there will be a second season..

While I'm usually a fan of English dubs, I recommend watching the original Japanese in this case. The English voice actors are decent, but not especially good.

All in all, Girls und Panzer is well worth your time, as it provides both exciting action and a well-written story.",1440806400,,2817,5.030042918454936

This could have easily been a goofy fan-service fluff piece. Instead it's full of heart, full of hope. And full of tanks. My only complaint is that it isn't longer. Something THIS awesome deserved a 24 episode run. In any case, I would highly recommend it to those that enjoy stories with heart, with a side of accurate tank combat.

To the story I enjoyed it.  You have a small school rai Girls' Academy fighting to survive as a school.  Our main Miho running from her past in Tankery  or sensha-d  winds up being pushed into the very heart of her fears.  As the story progresses she overcomes her inner battle and shows the true stature of a leader and inspiration for her team.  And in overcoming her own struggles she helps each member of her team to overcome the inner struggles of their own lives.  I am rating this one high due as a matter of personal preferences and hope you enjoy it as well.

5957718,5,B00EZ228FE,"Japanese animation or Anime is justly famous for animating concepts that no one in his right mind,... uh,... that is,... nobody else would ever think of, and Girls und Panzer is in a class by itself.

In a slightly alternate universe, in addition to the traditional feminine arts of calligraphy, tea ceremony, and flower arrangement, young Japanese school girls are also encouraged to learn the only slightly newer traditional feminine art of Sensha-do or Tankery, tank combat as a sport, a sport which has spread around the world.

This is actually less insanely lethal than it sounds.  Special sensors and reduced power tank rounds are used in order to make the game as safe as possible, and while there is always the possibility of decapitating a tank commander with a wayward shell or suffering a fire or other mishap, nobody is supposed to die or be seriously injured.

As our story opens, Miho Nishizumi has transferred to the Oarai Girl's Academy in order to AVOID Tankery because she had a falling out with her mother and older sister over how far she was willing to go in order to win at her previous school, Kuromorimine Girl's High School, the acknowledged premier school for Tankery in the world thanks to her family's contributions.  Her mother is the Tankery instructor, the hardnosed advocate of the Nishizumi Style of Tankery that takes pride in strength and despises weakness, and Miho had lost what would have been Kuromorimine's tenth straight victory in the national tournament of Tankery by abandoning her command tank in the midst of battle in order to save some teammates when their tank fell into deep water, an action that was pretty much condemned by everybody,... excepting those she saved from drowning.  Unfortunately, for reasons revealed later in the story, Oarai is reviving their Tankery course, and Miho gets dragooned into it.  What follows is a parody of every sports story ever told as a hopeless band of Tankery newbies and misfits must band together, learn quickly, and train hard in order to Win It All against impossible odds while teaching those who have forgotten that it's not supposed to be a war, that it's supposed to be fun.

The creators do an amazing job of handling a very large cast, in part by dividing the girls up into shared interest/situation teams assigned to specific tanks: the disbanded volleyball club, the history buffs, the first years, the student council, the auto club, the hall monitors, and the online gamers.  Only reluctant commander Miho's crew is particularly diverse: the flower arranging gunner, the narcoleptic driver, the advice-to-the-lovelorn radio operator, and the fanatically tank obsessed loader.  They also have a lot of fun with international stereotypes in the various school opponents: the unflappable, tea swilling British (from china cups mind you, DURING battle), the insanely wealthy and overly dedicated to fair play Americans (calling penalty strokes on themselves), the passionately enthusiastic Italians (best food, weakest tanks, most audacious tactics, most enjoyable post loss party), the bombastic, chip on the shoulder Russians, and the Kuromorimine girls who combine the most unpleasant characteristics of both German and Japanese militarism into something that has EVERYBODY cheering against them.  With the odds so hopeless, much of the fun is seeing how Miho and the Oarai Girls deal with the challenges; their apparently developed on the fly tactics for taking out the super heavy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Platz-Maus-Kuromorimine-Version-from-Anime-TV-Series-of-Girls-und-Panzer-Kit-1-35-Scale/dp/B00CFECWI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Platz Maus Kuromorimine Version from Anime TV Series of Girls und Panzer Kit, 1:35 Scale</a>&nbsp;(arguably the strongest tank available under Tankery rules), during the championship match are insane but appear workable.  Arguably, Miho turns hers and her team's inexperience into a virtue by coming up with a brand new set of tactics idealized for each opponent while they operate under the unrecognized burden of their team styles, which hammer every opposing team as if it were an identical nail.

But, let us be honest with ourselves, the REAL reason to watch this show is the gorgeous, heart-stoppingly beautiful, drool-worthy, anatomically correct,...

WWII era tanks.

While these stray from the canon in a number of areas, most notably during the Anzio battle, the projected plot for which must have changed drastically before the OVA was animated, they also clarify a few mysteries from the TV show, and thus are probably worth purchasing for fans.

Note: The two compilation episodes produced and televised in Japan because the creators were failing to meet their deadlines are included, though only in Japanese with English subtitles.  ""Introductions!"" which fits between TV episodes 5 and 6 is in the Special Features section on Disc 2, and ""Introductions 2!"" which fits between TV episodes 10 and 11 is in the Special Features section on Disc 3.  (On the Blu-ray both can be found in the Special Features section on Disc 2.)

Note: A DVD collecting six&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Girls-und-Panzer-OVA-Specials/dp/B00GB0OX42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Girls und Panzer OVA Specials</a>&nbsp;is a must buy for fans of the TV series; among the most interesting things are an episode explaining (to the extent that is even possible) why all of the schools are built on converted or replicated aircraft carriers and a longer, more detailed version of the battle winning reconnaissance mission during the TV episode 9 match against Pravda.  (There are also a couple of episodes where the cast spends most of their time wearing bathing suits for those interested in that kind of stuff.)

Note: A new OVA episode has been released in Japan but not yet here, entitled ""This is the Real Anzio Battle!""  Set during TV episode 7, this depicts the full story of the battle with Anzio that until now had taken place offstage.

Note: For those interested in a chronological listing of TV and OVA episodes combined, here is my best guess:

From internal evidence OVA episodes 1 and 2, in that order (because the swimsuits purchased in the first are still being worn in the second) take place before the first tournament match, which means between TV episodes 4 and 5.

From internal evidence OVA episode 3 must take place after Yukari's reconnaissance mission before the Saunders match in TV episode 5 (and arguably after the Saunders match itself in TV episode 6) and before the hunt for more tanks in the latter half of TV episode 7, so I place it at around the halfway point of TV episode 7, well before the Anzio match at the very end of TV episode 7, which is expanded in OVA episode 7.

OVA episode 4, which includes the Hall Monitors but no later joining teams in a costumed, Oarai set performance of the Angler Fish Dance of Shame, must take place sometime between their joining in TV episode 7 and the other teams joining in TV episode 10.  Since exactly these girls performed exactly this dance, albeit in their competition uniforms on the field of battle during the match with Pravda in TV episode 9, the logical conclusion is that this was a commemorative performance of what was now a Dance of Defiance, taking place during TV episode 10 after returning to Oarai victorious.

OVA episode 5 is a longer, more detailed version of the battle winning reconnaissance mission during the TV episode 9 match against Pravda.

OVA episode 6 is the tale of what happened at the victory banquet after TV episode 12.

All of this results in the following chronology:

TV  1-4,
OVA 1-2,
TV  5,
TV  5.5 compilation ""Introductions!"",
TV  6,
TV  7, 1st half,
OVA 3,
TV  7, 2nd half,
OVA 7,
TV  8,
TV  9, 1st half,
OVA 5,
TV  9, 2nd half,
TV 10, 1st half,
OVA 4,
TV 10, 2nd half,
TV 10.5 compilation ""Introductions 2!"",
TV 11-12,
OVA 6.

Note: Since it isn't obvious at first glance, it is worth mentioning that this anime parody is truly suitable for all audiences.  There is no gratuitous violence (or any real violence at all), no gratuitous nudity or even near nudity (there are some brief sauna scenes with everything covered, and a couple of OVA episodes with lots of skimpy bathing suits, but that's it), no panty shots, and no sex.  You can watch this with your youngest children, and the only thing to worry about is the possibility that they might develop an unhealthy interest in armored vehicles.  What's more, the values being taught are all laudatory: making friends and being a friend, teamwork, playing fair, school loyalty, watching out for each other's safety, trying your best, having fun, giving thanks where thanks are due, and caring for each other.  Pride, arrogance, cheating, and winning at all costs are gently but steadily condemned.

Note: If you love the show, chances are you love the music, too, so you are likely to want the original soundtrack album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Girls-und-Panzer-O-S-T/dp/B009S8D3JK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Girls und Panzer / O.S.T.</a>, and the main reason is the second disc.  That's because while the first disc contains several arrangements of the main theme and a nice collection of expanded musical snippets of BGM from the show, the second disc contains the complete opening and ending songs, the complete march or marches from the various schools, the version of Katyusha with Russian lyrics that Sentai Filmworks was unable to license, and the complete version of the Angler Fish dance of shame song with Japanese lyrics.

5957722,2,B00EZ228FE,"This is.

The second-worst anime dub I have ever heard.

Girls Und Panzer is an amusing and surprisingly well-done anime set in a ficticious future world where tank operation has come to be considered a ""ladylike"" sport, alongside horsemanship, tennis, and swimming. The series was apparently written by tank aficionados, because the attention to detail for the operational specifications and the terminology is, while I'm not qualified to determine its accuracy, downright educational. Each tank is modeled accurately and uniquely, and while the plot is B-list Saturday morning cartoon, the execution of that plot pulls out all the stops, presenting a cast of well over 30 characters and giving each as much personality development as she deserves. The Hetalia-esque nods to various national reputations is also entertaining, and the series really knows when realism should take a backseat to entertainment.

The dub, on the other hand, seems like the executives at Sentai Filmworks went down to the local highschool and passed out a sheet asking who wants to be in an anime, then gave the girls lines without bothering to check the recording. Personalities are flat, performers are utilized in roles they're poorly suited for, and two great musical pieces of the series are either horribly massacred lyrically or wholesale replaced with something ""more American sounding.""

Don't bother buying this version. Stream the subs on Crunchyroll.",1419379200,2,1441,5.3628318584070795

5957724,4,B00EZ228FE,"Don't let the little girls fool you. This anime is pure testosterone fueled action. It was my favorite anime of 2012. The premise is more or less a sports anime with the protagonists being the underdogs going for the gold. The battles are well orchestrated right through to the end. Characters are likable and there are a lot of intense moments.

The purpose of my review is to talk about the localization.

As for the English dub, there are a few exceptionally well voiced characters, namely Katyusha, Saori, and Momo-chan. Major props for them, they really got the characters dead on. On the flip side, some of the other voices like Miho and Yukari fall flat. They're not bad per se. They're just very plain and generic. Like if you don't see Miho's mouth flaps, it's hard to tell she's the one speaking during a scene. Again, they're not bad. Certainly passable. But a little more ""Oomph!"" to reflect their personality would've been good.

Also, quite an important change from the original, the Katyusha song was edited from episode 8 in both the Japanese and English dub due to copyright issues. It was replaced with Korobeiniki aka the Tetris song. This is a pretty major change and I know it's not Sentai Filmworks' fault for having to remove it.

Why 3 stars?

While the series is watch worthy, I'm questioning if it is own worthy.  By all means go watch it on Crunch Roll or whatever streaming sites got the rights to it.  Sentai's attempt at getting this series to American shores was a weak one.  I'd like to remind them this isn't a very friendly or forgiving industry right now.  Funimation offers Blu-ray DVD combos as well as a nice dust cover for their releases.  Sentai has only provided me with a box and some blu-rays.  Rather spartan offerings for 40 dollars.

But that's hardly the most painful aspect of Sentai's bungled release.  One of the most notable scenes in the entire series was edited out because these poor guys couldn't get the song rights to Katyusha.  I'm guessing the editing of that scene probably cost more than the song rights, but whatever.  Voice acting was merely average.  Overall I've found Funimation can at the very least offer more value for the price.  And other companies can offer more content for the price.

This was overall a great, creative, and engaging series let down by Sentai.  Bought it to show my support for the series.  Hopefully Sentai will up their game.",1407110400,10,1505,4.578947368421052

The idea of high school girls fighting in tanks as a sport may sound strange but both the writers and animators pull it off very well. the battles are exciting and the plans are clever. They are also well paced. Some fighting anime make fights last forever which becomes drawn out and boring. These battles have the ideal length; long enough to see the heroes' sweat but short enough to feel fast paced.

The character development is fantastic. The main team alone has almost two dozen characters and if you include enemy teams and other characters, the count reaches more than thirty. If a show can develop that many characters in a dozen episodes than there is no other word than ""fantastic"". Miho's development as a commander and as a person deserves special mention as the contrast between the first and last episodes are remarkable and yet make perfect sense.

There's plenty of funny stuff here generated by the cast's interactions; lots of good clean fun.

I was disappointed by the English dub because many of the voices sounded off. I thought Miho sounded like a boy and that Anzu sounded like she was voiced by the same actor as an adult newswoman.

If you have seen the original Japanese broadcast you will notice it fast enough...the largest being (to me) that they took out the ""Katyusha"" song, how you ask? Well they do not sing at all, and they replace the animation showing them just riding along in the snow...
The voice acting is well enough for me, I have no real complaint there. For the blu-ray disk its self....I do not think they put a lot of time into it, feels like they just slapped it together made sure it worked and boom done. I still liked watching it, but at the price I paid for and from what I bought of other animes its just feels like I have been cheated..

5957764,5,B00EZ228FE,"The tank animations are superb.  Any fan of tanks or WWII history should watch this show if nothing to see the tanks move and fire.  They are well researched, inside and out, down to the awkward loading position in the Hetzer.  Each one has a personality of sorts, from the cranky but ultimately heroic Porsche Tiger to the spunky Type 89.  There are plenty of in-jokes for WWII buffs and fans of Kelly's Heroes, too.

Each of the main five characters (the crew of the PzIV) has a story, which unfold as the story progresses.  The plot is well done, friendship and finding one's own path.  No pantsu here...you can (and maybe should) watch it with your kids.

The Blu-Ray transfer is good, video is sharp and the audio is fine.  The English voice acting is a bit flat in the first episodes, but improves after that.  Not much in the way of extras, just the Japanese TV spots.  The OVA short specials are sold separately.  There is a difference from the original Japanese broadcast:  The song ""Katyusha"" is missing, replaced with another Russian tune (without vocals), due to the near-infinite length of US copyright protection.",1389657600,,1127,4.688775510204081

Despite the premise (or perhaps because of it) this is a great show.  It is a funny show that actually has a lot of strategy to it.  It is also very hard to describe.  The Dub is very very good and I think the show applies well to all audiences.

5957766,5,B00EZ228FE,"The premise of Girls und Panzer consists of girls in tanks. What could go wrong with that? I thought this would be an entirely light hearted series with no real depth. How wrong I was. The animation of the characters is good but the combination of the excellent CGI of the tanks themselves makes it stand out. The story line is relatively simple featuring a reluctant commander who has to bring a collection of girls into the world of tankery. The characters and script are quite compelling keeping tension across the episodes with enough cliff hangers for a club of mountaineers. It kept me gripped and fascinated to see how the story ends with no slowing down or wasted episodes. A truly heartwarming experience.
Just one sour note though. The third disk in my set was quite glitchy coming to a stuttering halt at a couple of points in the last two episodes. It did this on a PS3 and my DVD player so it's the disk not the system. Still gets 5 stars though.",1389484800,,959,4.485714285714286

The only thing I really missed in the series was the song ""katyusha"". If you have not watched the original, then you should not notice that it missing (I think). But if you're like me and have seen it, you become a little disappointed, as it was one of the of the most enjoyable surprises.",1389052800,,521,4.381443298969073

The TD was completely forgotten, alas! The MAUS was there (only about 1 was ever operational) and made much of - da-da-da-da!

The only problem i had with it, and the reason it lost a star, is cause they did change a few things from the original series. Some of the animation and one of my favorite parts, when the the Russian start to sing, oh that part was truly magic when it came up on the disc I cringed and paused it so i could go watch the original scene on the net.

5957772,5,B00EZ228FE,"I rarely write reviews, but there doesn't seem to be any other way to address the errors and assumptions in the Amazon editorial review by Mr. Solomon for Girls Und Panzer.  Anyone considering getting this series should know that it does not contain either nudity or Nazi imagery.  Saying it contains ""violence against women"" is a misleading use of the term since the violence is rendered as sports competition between teams of girls.  No one is killed, hurt or being victimized in this story.  The judgment that admiring tanks used by the Germans in WW II is ""tasteless, if not offensive"" to Western audiences I simply don't understand.  Even during the war, the Desert Fox (Rommel) was at least grudgingly admired by those fighting him.  Why not warn that the series contains tanks used by the Japanese in WW II, or tanks used by North Korea in the Korean War?  What make this series work (for me) is that the tanks are treated as magnificent machines, not as political props.  Just as gamers and re-enactors have turned the fights of the past into competitions and tributes to the equipment of the past, so does this series.  The way the story presents tanks as one of the most natural interests in the world for girls is a different and entertaining inversion of the usual clichs that girls like ponies and boys like race cars.  And telling the story in terms of the girls developing teamwork, skills, and cooperation to work toward a seemingly impossible goal makes sure that while the tanks are fun, they never take over the story.  It is also great to see the detailed, accurate recreations of so many tanks.  A typical US animation would have used generic tanks rather than real ones, and lost a lot as a result.  The world in Girls und Panzer could never really happen because of the sheer costs of the tanks and the battlefields (not to mention those school ships), but one of the joys of anime is the way creators dream up something that would be cool and just run with it.  This is cool.  Have fun.",1387238400,32,2010,4.591036414565826
5957773,5,B00EZ228FE,"Great fun, with exciting action and wonderful female characters; written with depth and complexity.

5957774,1,B00EZ228FE,"While this is a top rated show and one of the best of 2013 Anime, this is just a pathetic excuse of a release when it's not even the original series anymore because they removed all the Russian songs, and altered the animation! For those that watched the original Japanese broadcast will be truly disappointed about this. If you are looking for a complete anime set, then this is not for you since it is no longer the original show.

5957775,5,B00EZ228FE,"I am not a huge fan of anime, I love Cowboy Bebop, like Champloo a bit less and thats pretty much it.
This was something I happened across by accident on Hulu and decided to give it a try, as a former US Army tanker, I love all things tank.

I was absolutely blown away in the first few minutes by the accuracy of the depictions of the tanks, their movement and sounds.

After only a few episodes, I was hooked on the plot, character developments and music. The dialogue is not corny and the execution of the art, choreography and music/sound effects in the battles are top notch and very dramatic.

The BEST part is that this is a cartoon I can watch with my 8 & 3 year old daughters and not have to sit thru pink ponies, winged fairies or Barbie ballerinas. THEY LOVE IT TOO!
It is great because it shows strong female characters, working together, solving problems and competing as a team. I feel that is something all too rare in modern cartoons and childrens programming in general. Theres no graphic violence, language or nudity, all of which is also extremely rare in anime. My girls also can now tell the difference between a Hetzer and a STGIII and play at being 'on panzers' on the back yard swing set.

For a good look at the show, look up ""The Art of Tankery"" trailer on YouTube, if that doesnt seal the deal, nothing will.

5957776,5,B00EZ228FE,"I love tank movies, from Kelly's Heroes to Patton to Tank, but in general tanks are just plot device and not the central character (except Sahara I suppose).  One can't spend much time on the mechanical advantages or limits (aka procedural) of a model of tank when you have only a 2-hour window to tell your story.  The same goes for elaboration of the tactics and strategies behind a battle that might delight a history geek, but otherwise bore the $ sign out of your average film goer who just wanted action.  But for those who does indulge in the mechanical, the tactical, the geekiness of the wargaming nerd herd once populated the country, G und P is our prayer.  How accurate it is to the real thing is not the point; what's important is in the execution, and boy does it and well.  Now for me personally, the fact that the premise of the battles are all non-lethal, non-militaristic, non-nationalistic, non-political, and 100% cute, is only a double plus:  Removes any bad taste out of the mouth when you see a Nazi war-machine taking out a Sherman.  For others, especially those unfamiliar with anime, the mileage may vary.  So if you're into stories where you demand characters be killed in combat, or struggle between good and evil in definable terms (ala superhero crap), this may not be for you.  But otherwise, I haven't had such a good time watching tank battles since, well, forever.",1382227200,5,1398,4.673469387755102

Would this reviewer call a German citizen a Nazi?  Would that be fair?  FYI: I met a German who was called a Nazi.  That person felt REALLY REALLY upset, said ""I am not a Nazi,"" and will tell you this generation had nothing to do with it.

Pros:
-Nice anime visuals and animation
-WWII tanks based closely to the real vehicles
-Real WWII nostalgic marching music cuts are a nice touch
-No one dies while being knocked out in tank battles
Cons:
-The series seems rushed with little character development, no love circles or fanfare. It is very basic with just a few side plots involving characters. It is just enough to keep the story flowing.
Conclusion: It is worth a watch if you like anime and WWII. However, I feel It is not worth a second viewing. Its very forgetful for all that is put together here.
