4097662,5,B0039USJBK,"While on out-of-town business, I had the chance to see this film at a screening at a nearby theater. Frankly, I wasn't expecting much, so I was blown away at how great this movie looks on the big screen. I couldn't believe most of the planes were done with CGI; the flying scenes looked quite realistic! The studio took a chance making this film with mainly German actors speaking English, but boy, does it WORK and work well!

I'm looking forward to seeing the film again on DVD (bonus features should be interesting) and showing it to my family and friends. I DO wish they had left out the smoking (never any need for that!) Nevertheless, a great work!",1272931200,9,654,4.495798319327731
4097663,2,B0039USJBK,"Now first up I have to admit I'm a bit of a WWI aviation buff, so I was really excited about this movie, HOWEVER! I found the movie so very disappointing on so many fronts, I don't know where to start. The biggest joke was watching the paltry extras, and listening to the producer claiming that the film was historically accurate...NOT! There was a non-stop stream of historical inaccuracies, and they even resorted to just plain making stuff up. Very very disappointing, because there was no need to resort to making a work of almost total fiction instead of something that actually resembled reality.

Here was a chance to do a really good WWI aviation flick, and I did quite enjoy the flight scenes, but they were too few. I guess they had to make room for the ""love interest"" angle, which was another historical inaccuracy, led nowhere, added nothing and took up valuable screen time. I understand that most people watching either wouldn't know the difference between fact and fantasy or wouldn't care, and that's fair enough. It is just such a wasted opportunity. A big budget with great CGI, and they decided to make this instead of something that could have been much more interesting and actually true!

They didn't even show his last flight and his death! Why not? A further blunder was insisting that to this day nobody knows who actually shot him down - total rubbish! It's been proven that he was shot down by ground fire from Aussie soldiers, no recognition given to them in the movie. Don't buy it, it's a waste of money, I wish I hadn't. Wait till it's renting for $1 and fast forward through the dross and just watch the flying sequences, everything esle is a waste of time.

I went from being very excited about the movie to thoroughly regretting spending good money on buying the dvd. About the only thing it gets right historically is his name. Flyboys was better, despite it's own historical flaws, and The Blue Max is so superior to this movie, even though it was made over 40 years earlier, it's not funny. The only thing that saves this sorry excuse of a biography from one star is the flying scenes.

This laughable film deserves to be shot down in flames!",1268352000,36,2180,4.610824742268041
4097664,5,B0039USJBK,"This movie can be called a serious version of Flyboys, from a German perspective. It is well written and acted and is simply the best movie ever made on the Red Baron. Anyone who likes Flyboys, World War I aviation, or action movies will enjoy this. It is too bad it was never released in US movie theaters.",1267401600,13,307,4.310344827586207
4097665,5,B0039USJBK,"I thought this movie was a profound and very inspiring story. A man who did not love killing, and yet fought a war that would be lost. Great movie, well worth watching again.",1513555200,,174,4.303030303030303
4097666,5,B0039USJBK,"I am a history buff. I have a degree in history, and I specialize in battle. I also have a deep interest in aviation. The Czech Republic has just done itself some serious credit. This is historically accurate, ESPECIALLY the parts where the shot down pilots from the opposing sides are shown together. Duh. I don't have time or the interest in re educating the present day beings posing as ""reviewers,"" who got here before me, but GAAAAH, if you'll just listen to what the characters say to each other, or even notice that the opening shot is of pilots from one side dropping a wreath on the coffin of a pilot from the other side, it's made very OBVIOUS, the fliers on either side of the war deeply respected each other as fellow fliers. Practically the first flying folk on earth, they felt close to each other, respected each other's skills. This is how it really was. Haven't you even heard of the ""Christmas truce?"" in the trenches? Same deal. There was still civility, and honor between people then.",1511395200,7,1004,4.583333333333333

4097668,3,B0039USJBK,"Mostly enjoyed it up to the end, though as others have said, I do wish Hollywood would stop putting their absurd spin on *everything.* Seriously, the audience can handle some ambiguity! Being true to reality would be a massive improvement. Or even just edging a little bit closer. Every now and then.

But my biggest criticism is the cutting of the last fight! I mean, you've got to be kidding...

The bios before the credits were a nice touch, and other than the above, it was done pretty well for what it was.",1509408000,,511,4.483870967741935

4097671,4,B0039USJBK,"A very enjoyable war movie. The film gives us a glimpse of the life of the famous WWI German Ace Pilot, ""The Red Baron"".
I have no ideas as to its historical accuracy. This is a German film, so who better would know. (excellent English encoded)
The casting was great, with the exception of the actress who played the nurse and girlfriend to the Baron.
She was too old for the part. Richthofen was only 25 years old when he was killed in a dog-fight. (April, 1918)
FYI. I very seldom give five stars to any movie, unless it is an exceptional film; ie ""The English Patient"", Snow Falling on Cedars"".......",1502236800,,603,4.441441441441442

4097676,5,B0039USJBK,"A very entertaining movie of First World War air combat from the German point of view.  The story is centered very loosely around Manfred von Richthofen and his compatriots.  The special effects, equipment, uniforms, etc. are very good but historical accuracy in the story of von Richthofen is lacking.  However, the aircraft look right.  I am not an aviation expert but the German planes do look very much like Albatross fighters and the allied planes look right as well.  The movie accurately shows that von Richthofen flew an Albatross much longer than he did the Dr 1 triplane which is most often associated with him in popular culture.  The acting, directing and script are fine.  Forget the historical inaccuracies and enjoy the movie.  If you want history, don't look for it through Hollywood's glasses.",1499472000,,810,4.992537313432836
4097677,4,B0039USJBK,"Not the best movie, and the story was a bit hard to follow, but it's pretty much just a highlight reel of Richtofen's apparently romanticized last days. Still, good entertainment value, and worthwhile for engaging interest in the time. Going to be reading a bit more on his life as a pilot now.

Someone said this is better than Flyboys, by a mile. I'd disagree. They both have pros and cons, but are about the same value to me. I think, while the story of Flyboys was more of a fictionalization, the story was more coherent, whereas this movie seemed to try to put a story to the actual events of those days. Either way, both are worth a watch if you're interested in the pilots of the time.",1498953600,,692,4.364341085271318

4097680,4,B0039USJBK,A well made movie but am left wondering how much of it is actual fact.  Film producers are known to distort history in order to make a more palatable movie.,1497657600,,156,4.2
4097681,4,B0039USJBK,"Spectacular air battles with wonderful WW-1 aircraft. Aviation buffs will love it. The characters were plausible and Von Richthofen's performance made him an interesting, compelling character. The romance seemed a bit thin, the pacing lagged a tad at times, and some more tension would have improved the movie.

4097684,4,B0039USJBK,"Well made, well done, well worth watching. Good acting, good portrayal and good action. The Red Baron's story is a great one, and deserving of an even longer film. That's my only real negative take away is that time jumps around, but I realize they have to do that a lot. I wish a bit more of his pre-war and pre-fame career were taken into account as well. Still, for anyone with intest in him or WW1 dog fights this is a must. Good to see something portraying the other side, especially WW1, a rarity.",1493596800,2,503,4.3052631578947365

Good casting, acting and plot, which covered only the most significant/last 3 years.  I wonder just how many flyable Albatross DIIs were made and how many of the aircraft were not flyable or were CGI.  I wonder how many know that the Red Baron just wanted to fly, and he even applied to the RAF/RFC but was turned down.  Anyways, the team produced an excellent film.",1486598400,,483,4.647058823529412

4097695,3,B0039USJBK,Entertaining aerial scenes are the best part of the film.

The acting is pretty good. CGI battles hold up. The score was very well done even though it's suppose to play into the emotional investment you have for the characters which the story didn't quite manage to do as everyone is pretty much 2D.

4097750,2,B0039USJBK,"While not actively terrible at any given moment, this is a dull slog most of the time. The action scenes are decent but never exceptional. Each character is two dimensional and the dialogue is stilted. Playful banter is utterly predictable and groan inducing.

The only saving grace of this movie is that, despite the paint by numbers action, the dogfights are unusual. Tearing fabric and smoking engines accompany the falling planes as they spiral toward the ground like a falling leaf, standing is sharp contrast to the WWII and later dogfighting films in which the heavier than air craft plummet to the ground like a rock and explode in bright flames.

What impressed me the most was the quality of the way this feature film told the story. This is not solely a story told from the side of the German Air Force during the events of WWI. It's a beautiful story of the Red Baron; depicted with heroism, loyalty, bravery and character, and set with heavy losses and the harsh realities of being a human during the time of war. It's a story of friendship, of romance and of ordinary men's lives. And of course there is plenty of action in many great aerial combat scenes.

4097834,2,B0039USJBK,"The actors in this movie are all very likable, but it's really not very good at all. It feels like a made-for-TV movie that you might see on CBS. Imagine the creators of CSI, Bavaria were tasked with creating a WW1 period drama about the Red Baron. The movie ham-fistedly borrows the premise and substance of La Grande Illusion (1937) and at the same time attempts a love story and also tries to turn Von Richtofen into some anti-establishment crusader AND also tries to whitewash Germany's role in both WW1 and WW2 by introducing a fictional jewish character (yes, yes I know it's completely true that a great many German jews served in the German armed forces in WW1 but still...). This movie is limp and maudlin and fey.

Other problems:
* Actors playing Germans speak in English with a German accent. I thought 'Swing Kids' (1993) demonstrated how completely silly that is.
* Writing and plot are trope-laden. Dialog is wooden and pantomimes the unrealistic broad ideas of the plot. Both fail to effect any real passion or conflict or realistic characters.
* Completely unrealistic and gratuitous battle depictions. A handful of scenes have the Baron strolling through a trench for some reason and meeting the Kaiser while men are slaughtered right outside some fortress or other. The writers/directors/producers obviously have little or no knowledge of the reality of the conflict.
* Main plot arc depicts Richtofen as some kind of iconoclastic, anti-war humanist -- how can this possibly be reconciled with his 80 kills? I don't buy it.

The flick does have some really good-looking planes, both CGI and mock-ups on the set (possibly even real planes, I can't tell). The little kid in me also really enjoyed one or two large-scale CGI depictions of the front -- lots of cannons and planes and no-man's land and stuff. The costumes look really great. Lena Headey is really cute.

Do yourself a favor. Don't watch this movie. Watch 'Paths of Glory' instead. It doesn't look as flashy but it's a waaaay better movie. Or if you want the German perspective, watch 'All Quiet on the Western Front' (1930) -- or read the book of the same name that this film is based on. It's the best war book ever. Heck, watch a documentary on the Great War like BBC4's ""The First World War,"" based on the historical account by Hew Strachan. The mood and gravity and pathos of that doc are way more interesting than this flaccid movie. Or watch 'La Grand Illusion' -- it's a bit old in a lot of ways, but it's considered one of the great films.",1460592000,7,2528,4.714932126696833

The meaningless consequence of war and the privilege of the upper class come into the story as well.  Naturally it is a true story but that doesn't always make good movies.  This one is spot on.
Con:  I liked the movie so much ( streaming it from Amazon Prime ) that I bought a DVD of it.

4097890,5,B0039USJBK,"Many reviewers missed the point in my opinion.  On the one hand, you have those who say it's not accurate enough, others complain that it is ""too corny"" and still others who think it is worse than ""Flyboys"", the WW1 film starring James Franco et al.,  In some ways both are similarly successful but getting right to the point on this film the balance is actually extremely impressive in that, while the creators do take some liberties with the facts, they do it for a very useful reason----they made the decision to bring the most important aspects of the German aces to life and in this they have succeeded marvelously and here is why you should buy this film, even before Flyboys (get them both ultimately). In fact for knowledgable pilots and historians of German Aces of WW1, this film is far more accurate than any other film on the subject to date and to prove it, one only needs to look at the incredible attention to detail.  Just a few---notice the ""side slip"" Voss uses (along with Josef Jacobs, this was one of the ""secret weapons"" of the German pilots and it worked fabulously in both Albatross and Fokker), where only rudder is used to turn quickly.  Notice the ""washed out"" crosses on MvR's Albatross.  Notice it's a DV, while many others still fly the more slab sided DIIIs.  Note that although many of the individual markings indicate A/C from units other than J's 4,6,10 or 11, a study of history tells us they did switch places not infrequently for a variety of reasons.  There are wonderful representations of Jacob's smoke blowing devil, Kirchstein's Zebra (or Udet's since he borrowed K's later, LvR's red-yellow bird, Voss and Kissenberth's and Graf von GK---many represented for the first time in film.  Catch the OAW manufacturer on MvR's early DIII? Look for the radiator shutter controls where they were and the open valve tappets on the Mercedes inline---rotary, not radial on the Dr1's.  And consider how much history is jam packed into this film and you will be amazed.  LvR's much greater PC (in Germany at the time) attitude compared with later MvR, the interesting and skillful development of best friend Voss' character wonderfully brought to life by Germany's most talented and popular actor Til Schweiger, and the amazing casting---(that's pretty much what Hindenburg looked and acted like!).  Okay, you can nitpick details--probably a Clerget not a Bentley in Voss' Dr1 but how many young people have heard of a Clerget?  Yet a Bentley thanks to current pop culture is well-known by those under 25, so a wider appeal is the result.  And do we really know it was not a Bentley?  New facts are emerging all the time.  Recent medical records show MvR was wounded by a ""newbie"" in the Circus, not by the two seater he was battling when he received his head wound.  So hold your ""facts"" for now and enjoy the massive history.  Sure it's a Curtiss Jenny on the home estate, but you have to admit, it's about as close to a Rumpler C1 or CII as you'll see in film.  Sure Hawker should have been in a DH2, but an Se5a is prettier.  In the end, this is a love story and Lena Heady makes Kate believable.  Fiennes plays a useful role as Roy Brown complete with accent and of course the liberties with history are off, but the bottom line is, the characters are very useful and interesting and unless we want WW 1 films about aces to only be shown at EAA conventions, we should be a little more open-minded.  The more you read, the more you will appreciate that this is not corny for WW 1 Germany, nor is it lacking in dialogue if you listen carefully.  It is a love story between a man and a woman and between men and men and the real characters are wonderfully represented as skillfully as the flying, the aircraft, the life, the scenes.  Bodenshatz really was like that, per interviews and diaries and so was Hoeppner.  I love the way they wove in the closeness of the combatants----RB's comment....you are all related in Europe....and the way the fighting in the air was so much different from the other military arms.  If you watch this film more than once you will see it is actually a love story with incredible action to keep it moving along with subtle dialogue (Voss' comment.....""Trust me I had to argue a little with the chap"" about the stolen Bentley (clerget) and fabulous relationships.  MvR actually did all those things and more---he was at the surrender meetings and met future bolshevik leaders--true story.  He was truly one of the most caring leaders who grew up at lightning speed.  So here is a movie that will actually age like fine wine.  For me, it is up there with some of the romantic classics like Casablanca because it shows tragic romance in the worst possible settings amid a brutal war.  So many touching moments----Sterni waving goodbye to Voss, MvR's grief right after giving him the harmonica (notice one other accurate detail.....in Berlin, three beautiful women walk by and what does MvR notice?  An ad for a Seidel harmonica--two facts are revealed---MvR hardly noticed women (other than Kate) and his pilot comrades were more important to him than almost anything else and second, his incredible attention to noticing everything, which was remarked about by many who were there---he ""saw Sterni lose it"" and he noticed that Roy Brown unsnapped his holster---there are many stories of how he ""saw everything"".  These are just a few of the incredible number of details that make up a ""cliff notes"" of real history and the history is better than hollywood.  Speaking of that, I wonder what people don't like about Flyboys?  One cool thing is there again---the coordination of aircraft timing is off, but do we really care?  How many Bristol F2's have you seen in the movies lately?  I admit, that Cassidy's character borrows a lot from MvR's real-life character, but I'm willing to bet Hawker was a lot like that or at least there is a composite of British leaders that were.  So if you are a flier like me, enjoy the really fun details like a whirling rotary rather than a radial (about time!), the ""ladies landing"" (almost) by MvR (true event), and the love stories in the midst of incredible brutality.  If you put aside your biases, what you will have in almost every detail, some representative fact of true events and you will be far more informed and entertained that way.  Watch the movie more than twice and you will come to appreciate this masterpiece for what it is.",1454112000,2,6438,4.683836589698046

It is a tragic story of young lives wasted and destroyed by war in all its insanity. I compliment the script writer for showing the love of aviation that many had and still have. I also must compliment them for portraying the role that all infantrymen played on both sides; all people from all walks of life, caught up in the madness conjured up by the influential few.  I became interested in the movie for its portrayal of aviation. It is unfortunate, though, how war does capitalize on technological advancements.

4097931,4,B0039USJBK,"A decent movie for entertainment and the effects were superb.  It did seem to gloss over the fact that flying planes of that era was incredibly daunting from low visibility to the shear mechanical runoff.  The S.E. 5a carried thirty-five imperial gallons of oil...the rotary engines would spew oil like nobody's buisness.  No one is coming back with a white scarf after flying those types of planes.  Caster oil was even used as a lubricant of choice in rotary engines as it was unaffected by fuel...as a result most pilots inhaled and swallowed a considerable amount of it resulting in persistent diarrhea.

The story was marred on the historical front as others have mentioned.  On the ideological side Manfred actually espoused the value of killing the pilots.  ""I never get into an aircraft for fun.  I aim first for the head of the pilot, or rather at the head of the observer, if there is one."", Richthofen, Der Rote Baron: die ganzee Geschicte des Manfred von Richtofen 2007 Castan.

The movie seemed to portray a overly romanticized version of Richtofen that was generated as propaganda by the German military and polished off with active imaginations.

For example, one of the Baron's adversaries (Hawker) is shown flying a much later SE5A, when he was actually flying a rather frail-looking DH-2. A very ""glossy"" production and obviously a lot of money was spent -- the full size replica aircraft (for ground scenes) must have taken a huge amount of effort to create.

On the other hand, if you want to see real film of actual aircraft flying, the ""gold standard"" for WWI aviation movies remains ""The Blue Max"" which is a terrific DVD to watch in high def widescreen.

4098038,4,B0039USJBK,"For some reason Hollywood can't do WWI right.  However, this movie does a pretty good job of showing the darkness that covered Europe in the Great War.  Don't get me wrong, this movie isn't perfect and has its fair share of artistic license, but at least it conveyed some the brutality and pointlessness of WWI.  What makes this movie particularly clever is that as the Baron's view of war changes, so does the tone of the movie.  At first he espouses a very gentleman's way of fighting the war by telling his fellow pilots that their goal is to shoot down planes, not kill people.  The movie is bright and a little playful.  As he starts to see the reality of trench warfare, his views of war and flying start to sour and the movie gets progressively darker.  I thought this was a great bit of filmmaking.

People seem to criticize this movie over the use of CGI in the dogfight sequences.  Do you have any idea how difficult and expensive it is trying to film actual airplanes in flight?  Of course you need CG!  Could the CG have been done a little more sparingly or better?  Probably.

Some of maneuvers these aircraft perform don't seem possible given the ""G"" stresses they would have to endure, but it does make for great flying!! I do like how at the end of movie they give a brief statement about the main characters.

And so...  We are left with the human stories.  infinitesimal vignettes of the true horror of such ""great"" and ""modern"" war, when all such wars are anything but.

  By all accounts, it's not a very accurate portrayal of Richthofen's actual approach to combat, as he seems to have been a bit more a killer.  Not so much a stretch as the meetings with Captain Brown, but I think it serves the storyline well, and that it's a reasonable presumption as to the effect that carnage must have had, even when it would not have been publicly voiced.

  It's a good story, about a complicated man, living tumultuous times not of his making, who will always be remembered for his leadership and accomplishments.  I think it's fair that we err on the side of a little more humanity, rather than the failures that must lead up to one young man closing with another and pulling a trigger.  Those are for a different and more serious venue.",1436400000,,1335,4.440329218106996

MvR is one of the most celebrated war pilots in history. I was not expecting a romance novel from this film but alas the nurse from hell haunted you from every corner...she was the sly crafty creature, not MvR!!!

If you know much about aviation history I can pretty much say with confidence those aerial acrobats with WWI aircraft were over the top maneuvers. I recall Howard Hughes having problems with his ""Hells Angels"" film to accurately portray the insanity of air warfare, so what did he do?? He added clouds! Not CGI spins and dives and almost UFO action to the screen. Even if you worked on more modern aircraft you know the evasive moves are impossible to perform with all that drag. I loved ""Top Gun"" for the much aligned hard to fathom interplay but this vehicle takes it to the extreme. Yes, it was fun to watch, if I wanted to see a cartoon.

The cookie cutter flyboy look was impressive but please, a titch of variety might keep me on target with the characters. Maybe that nurse implanted a GPS in MvR's brain, eh? I did like to imagine he had a fling or two given his high testosterone levels but three kisses and one I love you was not exactly Take Me Away Calgon level.

The lovely friendship with his dubious killer Fiennes was delightful and really added to the friend/enemy distinction. How much of all this was researched, accurate, or extrapolated my dear German filmmakers? I dare say this could not possibly be your responsibility and wondered how badly you balked at the final production.

Oh well, MvR was truly adorable and a humble aw shucks kinda dude. They should sell scarves with his red logo! High recommend for CGI aerial warfare scenes, cute flyboys, and never showing the actual battle that took his life. Kudos LuftWaffles!",1434758400,,1804,4.625
4098178,5,B0039USJBK,"In junior high school, I used the bi-plane as my topic of a report in history class.  I can remember talking about how the twin ""Vickers"" machine guns were synchronized so that they would fire between the blades of the propeller and not shear the blades off.  I can remember talking about the extra lift that was gained from having a second parallel wing.  I talked about Spads and Fokkers ... and about the Red Baron.

Baron Von Richtoffen was a legend, pure and simple, among the pilots of World War I.  He was respected on both sides of the conflict as an honorable man who set the standard for combat in the air.  But don't think for a minute that this is only a war movie.  The Baron has a love interest who is precariously positioned in a small cottage along with her bothers and sisters, entirely too close to the fighting.

The Red Baron is more than just a pilot who racked up some high scores against the enemy.  He's a leader who rallies the troops and keeps them focused on the job at hand.  He's a teacher who shows pilots how to bring down more enemy planes (hint: don't start firing until you're close).  But more than anything, the Red Baron is a person who struggles between his drive to excel at fighting the enemy, and his deeply held sense of honor and fairness.  ""We are here to bring planes down, not to kill pilots.""

The cinematography and special effects are visually stunning, the music track reserved and appropriate, all production values very high. This film hits on all cylinders including it's tightly woven believable love story and it's portrayal of the well-documented ""sportsmanship"" atmosphere that existed among aces of that era (which often transcended nationalism). Richthofen was a huge icon in his day so the hero-worship is not at all exaggerated.

Also this movie makes the Red Baron and his brother more 1990's-present 'sensitive boy' types as opposed to the tough men, both physically and mentally, that they actually were.  Gets a bit slow in the romantic sections.  Good actions scenes and as a period drama.  Considering that this is a WWI movie, the movie does overcompensate for WWII's treatment of the jews in that the the writers go a bit overboard creating a jewish German pilot character.  There certainly were jewish German pilots, but making him one of the 5 main pilots might deceive people into thinking that they made up 20% of the air force which simply wasn't the case.  Also, having him have a jewish star painted on the side of his plane and have the Red Baron get really overemotional when he died was way over the top.  Keep in mind that when the Red Baron's other Protestant (or whatever) friends in the air force died, he had little to no emotional reaction, so it was a bit bizarre.  Let's face it, guilt over WWII just doesn't belong in a WWI movie.

Of course, the historical inaccuracies could have been worse if had been made in the U.S.  Heck, America's ""History"" Channel portrays it as common to have a Xena-like woman warrior leading a group of male warriors in their show Vikings, LOL!

I would also like to see the original version of the movie which is available from other countries (as the U.S. version is edited from the original version), of course there is no guarantee that the European original cut is a better movie but who knows.

4098335,4,B0039USJBK,"In Hollywood, to produce a successful movie, especially one based on a true story, you usually have to add some fluff. For example, you might add a character to feed into the plot, or enter an event that didn't actually happen into the plot. Sometimes directors even take actual events out because they don't like them, they don't flow, or a different reason. In the movie The Red Baron, based on a true story, I believe the writers and directors did a better job than most directors of not adding too much fluff to a great story.

 The movie is based on the true story of Baron Manfred von Richthofen, a famous German Ace fighter pilot in WWI. The movie accurately depicts his life, from his family to his friends and love life. It shows him fall in love with Kate Otersdorf, a military nurse, which actually happened. It also shows the men in his squadron, who all actually existed except for Friedrich Steinberg, who represented all the Jewish fighter pilots of WWI.

 There is a little bit of fluff in the movie, however. The creators of the movie add a scene where he shoots down and then talks to Roy Brown, an actual Canadian fighter pilot twice, and another one where he visits a strip club. But the biggest fluff in the entire movie is The Red Barons completely artificial personality. In the movie, the writer and director give him a merciful personality, where he tells his squadron do not to kill the pilots, just disable their planes, and we are pilots, not butchers. However, legitimate history records tell us that in real life, he was actually merciless with the enemy, and was known to aim for the enemy pilots head.
Overall, the writers and directors of The Red Baron did a very good job of keeping the movie pretty accurate historically, making it a rather trustworthy source if you want to learn about the life, and death, of Manfred von Richthofen. Because in the real world, theres no time, or place, for fluff.

4098337,4,B0039USJBK,"This film is based on The Red Baron's life whose primary source was his own brief autobiography.  Manfred Von Richthofen became ""The Red Baron"". He published a book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Red-Fighter-Pilot-The-Autobiography-of-the-Red-Baron/dp/097918133X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Red Fighter Pilot: The Autobiography of the Red Baron</a>&nbsp;(Der Rote Kampfflieger) in Germany in 1917 while the First World War was still raging. Richthofen was the head of the Flying circus Jagdegeschwader Nr. 1. He was the greatest flying ace of the war, downing 80 enemy aircraft before he was killed on April 21st 1918 over the Somme valley. He had managed to land his red Fokker Dr1 Triplane, but he had been shot and killed by a single bullet, likely fired by allied ground forces; He was twenty five years old.

The Red Air Fighter, though heavily censored by the Kaiser's government, contains many interesting details about the life of the Great War's greatest flying ace.

World War I was a family affair for the Richthofens. His younger brother Lothar, who survived the war, also flew in the Flying circus and won the Ordre Pour Le Merite as well. His cousin, Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen, served in the German infantry in the Great War, but later rose to become a General Field Marshall in Hitler's Luftwaffe during the Second World War. Manfred's sister Ilse nursed the wounded during the war.

Richthofen was born into an aristocratic land owning German family in Breslau (now Poland). His father served as a cavalryman in the 12th regiment of Uhlans. Manfred was an indifferent student - ""I did just enough work to pass"". He loved hunting, football and gymnastics. He joined the cavalry and became an officer in 1912.

Reading Richthofen's book reminds one of his essential boyishness. He writes about the first time he was ever in an airplane, ""The houses seemed to come out of a child's toy box. Everything seemed pretty. Cologne was in the background, The cathedral looked like a little toy."" Later Manfred even takes his dog 'Moritz' up on a flight with him, ""Once I even took him up with me. He was my first observer. He behaved very sensibly. He seemed much interested in everything, and looked at the world from above, Only my mechanics were dissatisfied when they had to clean the machine. Afterwards Moritz was very merry.""

The night before the outbreak of the First World war in August 1914 Manfred writes that he and his fellow officers ""were eating oysters, drinking champagne and gambling a little. We were very merry. No one thought of war.""

Soon after the start of the war though, Von Richthofen develops a startling callousness. He writes, ""I heard that the inhabitants (of Arlon, France) had behaved very treacherously several days previously towards our cavalry, and later on towards our ambulances. It had been found necessary to place quite a number of these gentlemen against the wall.""

Von Richthofen apprenticed with the German ace Oswald Boelcke. ""Everything that Boelcke told us was to us gospel truth. During the last few days he had, as he said, shot for breakfast every day one or two Englishmen,"" Von Richthofen writes. He once asked his mentor Boelcke how he was such a successful fighter pilot. Boelcke replied, ""Well it is quite simple. I fly close to my man, aim well and then of course he falls down."" On October 28, 1916 Boelcke's plane collided with another German plane and he himself ""fell down."" Richthofen reflected, ""Nothing happens without God's will. That is the only consolation we can put to our soul during this war.""

On September 17, 1916 Von Richthofen shot down his first enemy plane. He writes, ""My Englishman twisted and turned, flying in zig-zags. I did not think for a moment that the hostile squadron contained other Englishmen who conceivably might come to the aid of their comrades. I was animated by a single thought: 'The man in front of me must come down, whatever happens.' At last a favorable moment arrived. My opponent had apparently lost sight of me. Instead of twisting and turning he flew straight along. In a fraction of a second I was at his back with my excellent machine. I gave a short burst of shots with my machine-gun. I had gone so close that I was afraid I might dash into the Englishman. Suddenly I nearly yelled with joy, for the propeller of the enemy machine had stopped turning. Hurrah! I had shot his engine to pieces; the enemy was compelled to land, for it was swinging curiously to and fro. Probably something had happened to the pilot. The observer was no longer visible. His machine-gun was apparently deserted. Obviously I had hit the observer, and he had fallen from his seat.""

Von Richthofen admired his English opponents and disdained those of France. He wrote, ""Everything depends on whether we have for opponents those French tricksters or those daring fellows the English. I prefer the English...The French have a different character. They like to set traps and to attack their opponents unawares. That cannot be done easily in the air. Only a beginner can be caught, and one cannot set traps, because an aeroplane cannot hide itself. The invisible aeroplane has not yet been discovered. sometimes, however, the Gallic blood asserts itself. Then Frenchmen will then attack. But the French attacking spirit is like bottled lemonade. It lacks tenacity. In Englishmen, on the other hand, one notices that they are of Germanic blood. Sportsmen easily take to flying, but Englishmen see in flying nothing but a sport...Therefore, the blood of English pilots will have to flow in streams.""

About his fellow Germans Von Richthofen wrote, ""In my opinion the aggressive spirit is everything, and that spirit is very strong in us Germans. Hence we shall always retain the domination of the air."" Two World Wars in the 20th century would tend to confirm Richthofen's notion of a ""strong aggressive spirit"" in the hearts of many German people.

Von Richthofen took pride in being a sportsman and not a butcher, unlike his brother Lothar who, he tells us, ""was differently constituted"". On a leave from the front, he boasts of having shot a rare European bison on the estate of the Prince von Pless.

In the very last chapter of The Red Air Fighter Manfred playfully speculates about the future of aviation. He writes, ""I think things will come to this, that we shall be able to buy a flying suit for half a crown. On the one end there is a little engine and a little air screw. One sticks one's arms into the planes and one's legs into the tail. Then one does a few leaps in order to start, and one goes up into the air like a bird...Besides Giant aeroplanes and little chaser machines, there are innumerable other types of flying machine, and they are of all sizes. Inventiveness has not yet come to an end. Who can tell what machine we shall employ a year hence to perforate the atmosphere?""

In the appendix of my edition of Manfred's book there is a poignant list compiled by editor Norman Franks of the 80 allied aircraft he shot down. There was, for example, an engagement which took place ""on February 1, 1917 between the Red Baron and a BE2d on a photo-reconnaissance operation to Thelus, piloted by Lt. P.W. Murray from Durham, England (died of wounds) and observer Lt. T.D. McRae, Canadian (died of wounds). Forced down inside German lines and destroyed by shell fire twenty minutes later"". This information helps us to understand why so many allied pilots and air crew were moved, perhaps, to utter the phrase, ""Curse you, Red Baron!""

While Manfred von Richthofen was surely an exceptional pilot, his tragedy was the universal story of callow youth caught up, buffeted about and ultimately drowned in the maelstrom of total war.

This movie is a reasonably faithful portrayal of Richthofen's short and tragic life.  It features great aerial combat scenes.

The aerial action is great.  The actors are mostly German.  This movie is based more on the real events of his life than Von Richthofen and Brown and does not show the final battle between the two famous opponents.  The movie ended with brief recaps of what happened to the surviving flyers. I enjoyed the movie.  There is one made up sequence when Brown and Von Richthofen meet on the ground and have a discussion. The story is straight forward.  Because this mostly a true story there are no plot twists or surprises.  One pat of the real story not shown in the movie was that the Australian soldiers who found the body, gave the Baron a full military Funeral with a 21 gun salute.  After the war his body was moved from one cemetery to another and finally it came back to his families home.  I enjoyed the historical glimpse of how the air war was fought during WWI.",1415664000,2,1023,4.336842105263158

4098341,3,B0039USJBK,"While not quite the silly, two dimensional social commentary hijacking of a great story as was the film version of  Jack Hunter's The Blue Max, this embarrassing parody of a true soldier's story runs a close second.

At least Hunter's Bruno Stachel was a fictional character and it can thus be argued that whatever 60's zeitgeist violence was done to the truly excellent story line of the original work was no more than a literary version of smearing cheap catsup on a filet mignon.

Manfred von Richtofen however is a bonafide historic figure, and one who, given every contemporary source we know  whether recounted by ally or enemy, in no way resembled the effete, wide eyed, self questioning bed wetting frat boy this movie serves up.

Richtofen was a man of his time, not an aberration of the present.  He was a late 19th century professional German officer fighting the first truly modern war, and he was very good at what he did.  He was a dedicated killer who collected trophies of his victories and ordered silver cups to commemorate every confirmed allied plane he shot down, and never once, at least for posterity, left any record of regret for what he accomplished during the war.  By all accounts he was a truly superior combat leader who led from the front without a hint of self doubt and insisted his subordinates be as dedicated and aggressive to killing his countries enemies as he himself.

Good, bad, however one wants to view him, von Richtofen was in reality a true larger than life character, and nothing about him would fit into our early 21st century notion of sensitive neo-masculinity.  His story one that would make truly excellent cinema told truthfully and unadorned.  This pitiful effeminate caricature and the puerile rearrangement of historical fact, colorful enough in reality to outdo Lord Of The Rings if told right, probably has  Manfred, along with The rest of JG1 rolling over in their collective graves.

Completely farcical.  Saved only by some pretty good special effects.",1412812800,,2013,4.882352941176471

4098369,3,B0039USJBK,"Shot in English with a largely German cast, Nikolai Mullerschon's 2008 German would-be epic The Red Baron is perhaps somewhat better and slightly more ambitious than the recent Flyboys, but it still pales beside earlier films about the first war in the air like Aces High and, in particular, The Blue Max, which it at times strives to emulate. But where John Guillermin's film had a genuinely ruthless anti-hero and stunning aerial sequences shot in real planes, this quickly chips away at its hero's early arrogance to find the New Man underneath and too often limits the dogfights to brief green screen and CGI sequences that are good enough but not particularly convincing (though at least are slightly better photographed than the soft and undetailed scenes on terra firma). But while it spends far too much time on the ground and never offers a single prolonged or outstanding aerial setpiece to energise the film, it's not without redeeming features, offering Von Richthofen as the first superstar air ace, star of a thousand battlefront postcards who even has French prisoners stopping him to ask for autographs he gladly signs. There is even some attempt to look at the psychology behind his tactics and the propaganda machinations behind his rise to fame, Germany's need for a hero combining with his initial arrogance, thrill of the hunt and ideal of fighting a war with grace to create the perfect media-friendly heroic image in an increasingly ugly war, while it acknowledges the incestuous nature of the war in Europe, with relatives fighting on either side in family ties that mirror the old collapsed system of European alliances. Unfortunately it raises issues but only pays them lip service and all too often dumbs down with rushed scenes and on-the-nose dialogue that spells everything out far too specifically - it even adds captions like `Berlin, capital of the German Empire' for those who flunked their basic geography.

Matthias Schweighofer is adequate in the early scenes where Von Richthofen's arrogance exceeds his actions, but develops little gravitas as the role progresses, underlining the bland predictability of the character's journey from exhilaration to disillusion as he becomes increasingly uncomfortable with his role as a propaganda tool. Til Schweiger and Lena Headey fare rather better in their clichd roles, though Joseph Fiennes is unable to do anything with his painfully trite scenes as Roy Brown, the Canadian air ace credited with shooting down Von Richthofen (the film dodges that controversy by not showing the Baron's demise, giving him a romantic farewell before flying off into legend instead). Rather than offering any alternate perspective to the Red Baron's view of war, he's simply there to help facilitate the German ace's relationship with Headey's nurse, who opens his eyes to the true horrors of war and turns him into a politically correct jaded 21st Century figure who even answers back the Kaiser about the futility of mechanised murder in the hope of making him more acceptable to modern audiences. Unfortunately it tends to make him rather bland and anachronistic instead, something the sporadically inappropriate moments of clichd world music in Stefan Hansen and Dirk Reichardt's score only amplifies. The end result is a watchable but unconvincingly romanticised potboiler that never does its subject or its setting justice and never offers the kind of thrilling scenes in the air that films made over half a century ago did.

Monterey's US Bluray and DVD release of the film is heavily cut from 129-minutes to 106, but the uncut English-language version is available in a region-free Blu-ray edition in the UK from Showbox's with an acceptable 2.35:1 widescreen transfer considering the weaknesses of the original cinematography and a decent array of extras: making of and visual effects featurettes, 6 brief deleted scenes, outtakes, stills gallery, trailer and, er, music video of the end title song - yes, the film ends with a German pop song...",1399248000,2,4017,5.168970814132105

To put it bluntly, it focused too much on the completely fictionalized romantic relationship between Richthofen and his nurse Kate, and didn't focus nearly enough on his career and the war. I don't mind the made-up love story-- this is, after all, a movie and not a history book; a little creative license is understandable. The problem is that it was really ALL it was about. It is true that Richthofen's attitude towards the war seems to have changed, but it was not because some chick opened his eyes (classic Virtuous Woman Reforms Bad Boy narrative). This change came about as he lost many of his friends, and after he himself was injured and almost killed. He was also plagued by guilt over the enemy pilots he killed, and probably suffered from PTSD. The dogfight scenes were great, though.",1393632000,,870,4.69281045751634

4098379,4,B0039USJBK,"The leads were well cast and the grinding pace of the war was well-portayed. This isn't a movie about air battles, this is a film about the war from the supposed perspective of Von Richthofen himself. The real Von Richthofen is an enigma; there are his letters home and an Autobiography which was heavily edited by Wartime Propagandists. Not many of his friends survived the war, and his brother Lothar died within a few years of the War's end in a flying accident while working for the fledgling airmail service in Weimar Germany. Those who knew him best simply didn't live long enough to tell their stories, and I think that is why his story resonates so well. That all said, I think that this movie did a fine job of explaining the situation he and his fellow aviators were in (on both sides). Without giving any spoilers, the second scene perfectly explained one of the problems these men faced; this issue was particularly true of British and German aristocrats. The movie is not particularly bloody or gory, but still manages to touch upon the horrors of trench warfare, and the risks of aerial combat. I was a little disappointed that Von Richthofen's early flying was not touched on. His early flying and aerial missions on the Eastern Front might have painted a more complex picture of him. Also touched on but not explored were problems with the planes themselves; that they flew at all was a minor miracle. I didn't like how they portrayed Anthony Fokker as a rude profiteer; as a designer, he worked very closely with the pilots to make good planes. To be sure, there were faults with the Triplanes, but they were discovered and corrected quickly. In all, a poignant and enjoyable movie.",1392768000,,1699,4.704697986577181

Whilst there is not much really known about his love interest ( she immigrates to the US after WWI and promptly disappears ) the view into this section of history is a wonderful journey, I especially like some of the sub plots and choices for the actors, as they were young men dealing with significant peril on a daily basis.

Think of it , on a good day , - they would pilot planes powered by castor oiled engines with just pipe taps to control the gravity flow of fuel and oil. Breathing in exhaust, un-burned gasoline and oil vapor constantly ( which creates nausea ) while people are shooting at you.....

Therefore with my woefully inadequate Finance degree and my wasted MBA, I'm completely incapable of telling which film I enjoyed, being historically accurate and which film I hated because it was complete and utter FICTION!

What nefarious film producer sinks so low as to include fiction in a movie no less?!

Judging from other reviewers of this film, I'm completely incompetent to review this film.  Because the problem is, I enjoyed this movie, a lot.  I've watched it over and over.  I like the action scenes as well as the love interest of the ""Red Baron."" It is well written, tells an engaging story, the cinematography is beautiful and the CGI is top notch.

I love flying movies of all types, WWI is my least favorite genre, thus I was ""trapped"" one night into watching it.  To my surprise, I loved this film. Accurate or not it is enjoyable.

4098419,4,B0039USJBK,"I thoroughly enjoyed all of this movie.

Filmed in Germany, France, and the Czech Republic. It is in English. A few of the scenes near the end are evocative of The Blue Max, and of Paths of Glory, and of All Quiet on the Western Front (the No-mans Land scene with the Poilus sitting in the water-filled bomb crater).

I watched those scenes over and over. The Kantine scene, with the dead man, in the white pants, is chilling. Those rifles look like the Gewehr m/98. Nice touch.

I was not there, but that is what I think it must have been like. I spent much of my adolescence building Aurora and Monogram 1/4 scale airplanes. Among my favorites were the World War I German fighters. We see them in this film; the famous Fokker Dr. 1 Triplane, but more of another type: The Albatros D-5, or is it the Pfalz D-3 fighter? And a tour of Anthony Fokker`s factory in Schwerin!

He tried to sell his early designs to the British, then the French, but was turned down. He only sold to the Germans last. They put his work to good use. Or so I remember, from a book I read over 40 years ago (Arch Whitehouse`s Years of the Sky Kings).

One thing about this film that is missing from all other war films: The horses. Horses suffered greatly in both world wars. This is the first film I`ve seen that hints at the suffering millions of these animals endured.

We see real airplanes, and CGI, and airplane models in this film. I greatly enjoyed all of them. I wish I could have worked on the set in this film. Highly recommend, for drama, pathos, action, and reflections on war.",1368662400,2,1565,4.342465753424658

4098424,4,B0039USJBK,"A well made and acted historic fiction that although not entirely true to history offers some nifty CGI and a captivating romance.

Directed and acted by very good German and English actors and crew, the story of the Red Baron unfolds as a tale of an aristocratic, naive, spoiled ""sportsman"" who flies more as a competition rather than a killing effort.  His eyes are opened by an attractive French nurse(played intensely by a competent Nina Headey) who shuns him and the so called glory and honor of war, and by his interaction with an enemy ace, the amiable and practical, Captain Brown.

The Baron soon discovers war to be a brutal, horrific slaughter, and his star power nothing more than a pawn for the Kaiser's propaganda.

The dogfights and the background settings are super,e.g., showing opulent Berlin or the desolate ""no man's land""; giving us lots of biplanes, triplanes, and dirigibles.  They're great; I love that kind of stuff.

The message of the film is anti-war.  It doesn't glorify the battles, but rather offers a perpsective.  One sees the hopelessness of the men in the trenches- getting cut down in an instant (and for what?); the nurses dealing with endless casualities; the fragile planes ripping apart.  The pilots try to keep a sense of mutual honor and respect, but as Captain Brown plainly says, ""We're just here to kill each other.""

Yes, they tend to exaggerate the Baron's pacifism, the romance with the nurse is a speculation, the meeting with Brown, fiction;  they don't highlight in any detail the Baron's comrades, like the daring Voss, and there is no final battle seen on screen. We see the pilots faces going into battle, knowing they are pretty much doomed and then, cut away to a graveyard.

Overall, regardless to the naysayers, I enjoyed this film.  The romance is touching, the characters, whether true or not, interesting, and the feel of the movie didn't leave me depressed, very well done, and they include a making of feature in the extras.",1363564800,4,1987,4.84319526627219

I cringed when von Richthofen says to the nurse ""you're my greatest victory"" because you could see it coming a mile away. But the greatest disappointment in this film is that it's missing the greatest single aerial combat of WWI, and perhaps of all of history. I'm referring to the aerial battle between a solitary Werner Voss and the whole cream of the crop of the British Air Service. When I saw that Werner Voss was one of the leading characters, I couldn't wait to see this legendary dogfight portrayed in a movie (as it deserves), but for reasons that escape me, the director chose to skip it all together.

The movie does have some good points though. Despite the complaints of some, I loved the dogfight scenes despite the fact that they are not 100% realistic (Richthofen venerated Boelcke, but his Jasta didn't seem to know what a wingman was!).

4098436,2,B0039USJBK,"This film is basically a failure with some honest CGIs. Below I will try to describe the reasons why I judge this film so harshly, including some limited SPOILERS.

The greatest weakness of this film is the political correctness which pushed the director and the scenarist towards the complete historical inaccuracy - as the result, the ""Red Baron"" on the screen has virtually NOTHING in common with the one that really existed, except for the name, the number of victories and the date of death.

In the film Richthofen is almost a non-violent pacifist who cares greatly about not killing enemy pilots and observers and reminds it frequently to his men. In reality, exactly the OPPOSITE was true. Richthofen knew well, that men were the most vulnerable (and also the most precious) element of enemy airplanes, as even a single well aimed bullet hitting the pilot could finish a fight, when the destruction of engine or the wings took much more effort and munitions. He also always warned that when fighting the two placed planes, it was essential to kill the observer, who manned a defensive all azimut firing machine-gun, first, before going after the pilot.

In the film Richthofen has doubts about the sense of continuing the war and he even shows insolence towards the Kaizer and general Hindenburg, advising the latter to finish the war as soon as possible. Those things never happened! The ""Red Baron"" was a Prussian aristocrat, son of a professional soldier and himself a career soldier, who started attending a military school at the age of eleven! When the war began he was already an officer in cavalry since 1911 and before joining the aviation he already fought as cavalryman in Belgium, in France and in Russia. He never expressed doubts about the issue of war. When in 1918 the high command, concerned about the possible consequences of his death on the morale on the nation, asked him to accept a post in headquarters, he refused and insisted to fight in the first line, even though his health was diminished after grievous wounds he suffered in 1917. A patriot, a monarchist, a natural born fighter and a Prussian and German nationalist, von Richthofen was never this kind of gentle ""peacenik"" we can see in the film!

Less serious but quite annoying is the idiotic sweater von Richthofen wears all the time. It almost seems to me, that the director tried to ""demilitarize"" his character as much as possible and therefore made him wear an outfit which makes him look like a hippie from 70s rather than like a military pilot. I checked a lot of pictures of von Richthofen on the internet and I couldn't find even one in which he would wear such a thing - he either wears an uniform or, when relaxing with his fellow pilots, an open leather flying vest.

The film doesn't even mentions the famous silver cups von Richthofen had made on special command for each of his victories - well, I guess that would made him less politically correct... In fact, probably the only moment when the REAL von Richthofen is shown at the screen is the moment when he orders the mechanicians to paint his plane all in red, and when reminded that it will prevent all surprise, he answers: ""I do not want them to be surprised, I want them to be afraid!"". Other than those few seconds, for the rest of the film the REAL von Richthofen is carefully hidden behind a sweater wearing, peace-loving, non-violent anti-war protester from 70s, who somehow by some strange accident happens to be the greatest fighter ace of World War I...

Other historical inaccuracies are by comparison rather harmless. The completely fictious scene in which von Richthofen meets in person Captain Roy Brown, who in real life would later down and kill the ""Red Baron"", is of course absolutely fictional, but it is a good scene and it didn't offend me half as much as the alteration of von Richthofen's character. There are also some inaccuracies concerning the technical things (types of planes, paintings, etc.), but you need to be a real expert in World War I aviation to notice them.

The romance with the nurse played by Lena Headey has some charming moments, but mostly it is completely useless. Once again political correctness pushed the director into making a scene in which the nurse shows von Richthofen a hospital full of badly wounded soldiers, seemingly to show him how horrible is war - well, as it was already said earlier, he certainly had a pretty good idea about it, after fighting as cavalry officer in Belgium, France and Russia in 1914-15... Also, let's remember here, that von Richthofen was 25 when he died and the nurse, Kate Otersdorf, with whom he was in love, was most probably of his age or younger - in this context, choosing for this role Lena Headey, who was already 35, gives to this film a kind of ""cougar factor"", which it really didn't need...

The were only few things I liked in this film. The CGIs were maybe not great, but they were honest. Director made a good choice by selecting Matthias Schweighofer to play the main character - but sadly completely butchered the character itself... Finally, the rather elegant solution of taking care of von Richthofen's last fight and death - considering how controversial is this event, I think the director did the right thing by not choosing any of the sides in the controversy...

But bottom line, this is a very BAD film, which deliberately FALSIFIES history in the name of political correctness. The REAL film about the REAL Manfred von Richthofen remains to be done.",1350259200,,5522,4.761755485893417

It is the first film I've ever seen to give a reasonably accurate picture of Manfred von Richthofen -- the real man, not the myth. It shows him as he really was, a very young man, born into the old European aristocracy, trying in vain to fight a bloody war with as much grace and chivalry as he can.

The aircraft are all CGI, but they are ACCURATE, in a way not seen since the real machines were available for movie making. The performance capabilities of the real planes is matched with great care, engine parts such as rocker-arms actually move, and rotary engines actually turn in their cowlings.

As a aviation buff for the last 40 years i know that this film ranks one of the worst about the first world war and one of the worst about Von Richthofen himself. As i said in many other forms it seems that Hollywood or other film studios around the world has to have a love intrest in any and all films because of the females seeing movies and all that crap , blah blah. Well not all films need a woman in it or the remakes , because of past history (Remake of Rollerball , Flight of the Phoenix as examples) bombed in a film that has almost NO females in it. And like this mess destroys the story of one of the most writing about figures in the pass 100 years. The baron NEVER had a love intrest in his military career , and he NEVER violated any orders from HQ , bent the rules a little but never out and out disobeyed orders , he was to much a pro for that conduct. The nurse as we seen in the photos of during the war when he was wounded was nothing like this girl and she was a bit older , so it also destroyed any fact with the original nurse as well , as making his brother Lothar a total ass , which he WASNT , he was a brash and head strong fighter pilot and a great ace as well , but he was respected by his men and at times took over the Jasta when his brother was away. This Roy Brown BS is what it is bull$h!+ , the Baron never shot down Brown , and thou he was credited for shooting the Baron down , they never met , EVER. And the same goes for Hawker , who he shot down for this 11th victory and NEVER knew who he was til a day or so later. This writer should have his head checked for a bullet hole instead of Richtofen , because his brain must of leaked out. Horrible story and total unnessary events in his last couple of years. The movie ranks worst than Flyboys , the Blue Max and Richtofen  and Brown , Malcolm McDowell in Aces High or that piece of trash C movie of Mickey Rooney's Revenge of the Red Baron.

Looks like i'll have to wait for another 10 or so years before someone tried to make another WW1 flying flick with a little more truthfulness to the story , unlike the latest Red Tails that bombed big time for WW2. Seems nobody can get it right , Pearl Harbor , the Flying Tigers , Bah Bah Black Sheep ... ect.

Maybe i should stay on the ground for WW1 , i would be better off. Time to put on Paths of Glory.

And it also felt like this film was written to be a four hour film chopped down to an hour and a half-- stuff was happening for no good reason at all, there was no introduction to the Albatross airplanes that they started the film flying (for those in the audience who know only the tri-planes); there was no ""introduction"" to them getting their iconic Fokker Dr. Is; and they end the film with perpetuating the misinformation that Roy Brown shot down Richtofen-- most scholars support the theory that he was shot down by an Australian machine gun crew, a theory that is supported by a great deal of forensic evidence.

There was no character development.  I don't care about ANY of these people by the end of the film.  I REALLY wanted to like this film, but I should have known better to put faith in a movie about the Red Baron that I had only just heard about today (even though it's three or four years old already)",1336521600,3,1484,4.386861313868613
4098454,2,B0039USJBK,"A German production ""The Red Baron"" attempts to be two things at the same time, a biographical film (with a romantic focus) and a Michael Bay-like effect-ridden action film. This is a very ambitious project with a cast of mostly German players speaking English (probably international market in producers' mind). The story of the Red Baron, or Manfred von Richthofen (played by Matthias Schweighfer) - which was taken up in a Roger Corman film ""Von Richthofen and Brown"" back in 1971 - would be perfect for the basis of action-packed period piece, but to be that ""The Red Baron"" still needs one thing: a tight and engrossing script.

The unfocused screenplay tries to cover so many things about this legendary person, such as his love story and conflict with his brother Lothar Von Richthofen (Volker Bruch), but everything looks clichd. There is no dynamic interaction between him and other flying aces like Captain Roy Brown (Joseph Fiennes) and Werner Voss (Til Schweiger), which would have made the generic story more compelling. The film just moves on from one episode to another, without letting us know about the characters.

The combat scenes (obviously using green screen effect) are decent, but its pace is a little hectic. The effects themselves are fine, but fail to show us what made the Red Baron Germany's most feared air ace. His romance with a pacifist nurse Kate Otersdorf (Lena Headey) lacks passion with their dialogue devoid of emotions.

""The Red Baron"" is a generic and by-the-numbers bio-pic. What you want to see, you probably won't get here. Considering its famous and interesting subject matter, the film is a huge letdown.",1334361600,,1650,4.992727272727273
4098455,2,B0039USJBK,"this movie was one i looked forward to ... finally, i hoped at least, a movie with the facts and hopefully an exciting movie about the greatest fighter pilot ...

but no ... alas ... this is not even close

much like the recent 'Sherlock Holmes' tripe starring Robert Downey Jr., this movie has as much to do with the real Red Baron as I had to do with WWI ... in Sherlock Holmes the characters are there but the resemblance to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's seminal mysteries ends there ... nothing is even close to the legendary writings ... good god Watson had his revolver out and was squeezing off round after round more in the first 30 minutes of the movie that he ever did in the whole of the Holmes stories ... shameful and disconcerting frankly ... if they wanted to make a Victorian Era detective story where they act like it's a modern american cop shot 'em up, then call it ""A Victorian Era Detective Shoot 'Em Up"" and not Sherlock Holmes ... it's unfortunate nothing can be done to stop these 'crimes against legends' ... and frankly it is just insulting to any fan of the doyle stories that they think some hollywood hack screenwriter can come up with a better mystery than the originals ... now we have a new young generation that thinks sherlock and watson were running around shooting up london, having titillating sexual escapades, and basically look like every other cop movie that comes out of hollywood

one saving grace for that movie and this one is however the CGI FX

while in between battles in the sky, this Red Baron leads a life no one who has ever picked up a book on WWI aviation would recognize BUT the cgi planes and dogfights are pretty spectacular ... it's nice also they did some research into the myriad of the personalized paint jobs given to so many planes ... they really do look spectacular and they give you a sense of what it must have been like in the skies over europe during those years ... the shot of Richthofen's Albatross with the first red paint job is one i screen captured and use for wallpaper on my computer ... they got it right too right down to the paint being applied over the german cross and the white outline on the side as they did not bother to paint around it ...

so how can they get a detail like that, minor and not well-known, right and fill the rest of the film with complete crap?? i don't know ... it really is amazing that they also think they can invent a more exciting life than the Red Baron himself led? seriously? this guy was the greatest fighter pilot of all time ... he literally wrote the book on dog fighting ... why does hollywood always seem to think they can 'improve' on a legend?

so fast forward thru the embarrassing 'real life' parts and get to the dogfights ... really amazing work on those ... but now we'll have to wait another 20 years for the next effort since if anyone brings up the Red Baron as an idea for a movie, the hollywood executives will say ""oh no, we're not making another movie about that .. .the last one we made didn't make any money ... that guy is boring and people don't want to see a movie about him""

no, people do want to see a movie about him ... in fact, they are still waiting for it

so two stars for the cgi guys who really did spectacular work",1334102400,3,3261,4.308319738988581
4098456,3,B0039USJBK,"I've said it before in my reviews and I'll say it again here, don't get your history from Hollywood.  Hollywood is in the entertainment business and not the education field.  The Red Baron is a classic example of a movie that is allegedly based on fact.  The fact that this movie wasn't even made in Hollywood doesn't change the fact that is meant for entertainment purposes only.  This film is loosely based on Manfred VPN Richtoven's amazing life as a World War One flying ace, but that is about where fact leaves off and fiction begins.

Von Richtoven is depicted in this movie as a caring noble pilot who seems more a victim of circumstance rather than the calculating killer he really was.  When I say calculating killer I do not mean to further the myth of imperial German militarism or make the Germans to be the bloodthirtsty monsters history has labeled them.  Instead I mean that von Richtoven had one choice when in the air, shoot down others before they shot him down.  The life expectancy of a First World War pilot was measured in days, not months or years.  The fact that Von Richtoven lasted as long as he did is testimony to his ability to kill when he needed to kill.  This movie fails completely to put him in that kind of context.  Rather it makes him to be a celebrity (which he was) making the best of a bad situation (which he probably did) while trying to be compassionate (which he wasn't).

I give this film three stars not because of the storyline, which is weak, or the acting, which is mediocre, but because of the aerial dogfight scenes, which as quite entertaining.  The fight scenes puts the perspective of the pilots in context for those of us who were not there.  Compared to The Blue Max, The Red Baron shows how technology has changed so that virtually anything is possible with special effects.  For the fight scenes alone this movie is worth watching, especially if you watch it on Netflix.  I do not recommend buying it, there are too many reasons not to.  But watch it and you will appreciate what the pilots went through.  Then you may begin to realise how difficult their role was.  Then, if you are intrigued to learn more, get a book on the Red Baron or the air war in general.

This movie is a German production that was done in English.  I've read that the intent was to tap the American market.  Unfortunately for the film's producers, there is little such market even if the main character is portrayed as the king of person we would relate with.  The net result was an indifferent American audience and an uncaring German audience.  Perhaps the producers learned one of those counterintuitive lesson, how not to make a movie.",1332633600,2,2674,4.546025104602511

4098460,4,B0039USJBK,"Needless to say this film is not a historical accurate documentary; far from it.  History buffs will groan and cringe a bit when they watch this one as I am not at all sure if the producers even got many of the dates correct.  On the other hand, they did a pretty good job in recreating the planes.

But that is okay.  Films of WWI are my nature extremely depressing for me personally.  This is because WWI (And any war for that matter) is depressing.  Of all the wars I have studied though, with the possible exception of our own Civil War, WWI is, for me, more depressing than all the others; everything was so senseless and from the hindsight of history we know that all that loss and human suffering only led to an even greater tragedy a few years down the road. So many lives shattered, and for no good reason.

But I digress....

I did enjoy watching this particular film because I have a lot of little boy in me and the digital work with the air battles in this film made it worth watching.  Was it real?  Of course not, but to be honest I did not watch it for the realism but rather the fantasy.  The computer folks did a fine job on this one.

The other aspect of the film I found nice was the long gone ""nicety"" displayed by the men who were trying their best to kill each other.  I thought the film brought out how different morals, manners and overall outlook have changed from that era to the one we presently live it.

The producers of course brought in a love interest as all producers do and it was tastefully done even if rather gratuitous and unnecessary to make a great film...and a great film this could have been if the writers had simply stuck to the facts.

This is a nice film to watch in the wee hours of the morning with the dogs in your lap.  It held my interest if not educating me in the least.

I am giving this one four stars simply for the digital work.  As to the acting, I thought it was a bit flat and no one actor (unless it was the young lady who played the nurse and the Baron's girl friend is considered) stood out.  I doubt if there were or will be any awards handed out here.  That being said - I have seen much, much worse.

Overall, for me, it was a semi-enjoyable movie and the dogs did not object.  Of course they were sound asleep so are really in no position to offer an opinion.

And for those techies who want to know about blueray, DVDs and such.  I did not watch this on a machine...watched it on one of those Gawd awful movie channels.

4098478,5,B0039USJBK,"I first watched this movie on Redbox and loved it! Weeks later, I watched it on Netflix and loved it! Then I decided to buy it, watched it when it came in the mail yesterday, and still loved it!

The story goes into who Baron Manfred von Richthofen really was--a man of mystery which some called him. I first heard about the Red Baron as a kid reading ""Peanuts"" comic strips and wondering what that dog Snoopy was imitating while sitting on his doghouse and in an outdated flying outfit. Then I heard the mentions of a great German ace, one of the best in WW1 with over 80 kills before his own plane went down in flames in the spring of 1918. When I first watched it, I found out what kind of man that the Baron really was, a respectful one.

Apparently, he made little notice of his reputation until 1916, which is where the movie begins. The first scene is of the Baron and his German flying squadron soaring over the mourners at the funeral of a fallen British pilot-officer, and as the stunned Allied troops look on with surprise, the Baron drops a bunch of flowers directly into the freshly-dug grave from overhead, getting chewed out for it by a German superior later on. As the number of kills increase to his name, you see him confirm his kills by ripping off the flying insignia from each destroyed Allied plane, and finally get promoted to commanding his own squadron, which his younger brother even joins. But what really makes a name for himself is when he downs a British major, a flying ace that no one thought he had a chance at defeating.

von Richthofen believes in fighting a war the ""gentleman"" way. ""We down planes, not pilots."" he says, giving his enemies the chance to land their wrecked plane safely. He is outraged during a scene in the movie when his cocky brother is seen directly over the airfield, gunning down a helpless British plane and murdering the pilot when it was already apparent that the British plane was going down anyway. The German ruler, Kaiser Wilhelm II, is impressed with him, telling him in one scene, ""The ladies must be all over you.""
""Not many ladies are up at 10,000 feet."" the Baron says, drawing laughter from the surprised Kaiser and his staff.
But finally, an attractive nurse named Kate, who even tends to the Baron as well when he is injured, opens his eyes and shows him what the war really has to offer. So many hospitals, that they all have to be numbered, and full to the brim with wounded men, most of which will soon die.
The war soon goes into the massive German spring offensive of 1918. You see the Baron and his planes chewing up the entire British air fleet overhead, but the war is different on the ground, where the Baron can easily see advancing German infantry being cut into ribbons by British machine guns. He even tells a German general before the offensive that he thinks Germany must surrender. ""You know how I became the victor of 63 aerial battles? Every time I got into a fight that I could not win, I flew away."" He tells the same to his own pilots, to disengage from battles that they clearly have no advantage of over the enemy, but the Generals are not impressed. Even though the enemy respects and fears him, the Baron seems to sense that his own end is near, and flies on his final mission. His death is credited to Captain Roy Brown of the Canadian Flying Corps, a pilot he had encountered twice earlier in the war and in the movie, where he helps the wounded Captain Brown out of a wrecked plane, and then when both men face each other in battle and force each other down, where both men have a respectful chat before the Baron points him to where his lines will be.

Such a sad end to the Baron's life and flying career, but also a great movie to span his achievements all within 2 hours!

They did a superb job of making it look like World War I. It goes rapidly downhill after that. Schweighofer and his fellow pilots act and look more like a lost group of Heidelberg frat boys who somehow ended up in the Great War. They have about zero military bearing. Schweighofer looks like he just rolled out of bed when he receives his Blue Max in Lille. I kept thinking, stand straight for God's sake, you are a Prussian! Schwweighofer's performance is just all over the board. He's cool, he's blowing up, he's after a nurse, he's not...He actually did a much better job in his small role in Valkyrie. I think he has more potential than this nonsense. Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, there wasn't one single real plane used in the dogfights. After a while, it looks remarkably cartoonish, like Wil E. Coyote cartoonish. I was so aggravated after watching this one that I just had to turn on the Blue Max. As soon as I saw Karl-Michael Vogler climb out of his plane and bark orders, I knew I was watching the German military of 1917.

4098492,5,B0039USJBK,"(Spoilers ahead.)  Five stars for the costumes and scenery.  Three stars for the film itself.  This film really had so much potential to be a great movie on the highest scoring ace of World War I.  In the end, it degenerated into a tale about a young man who only wants peace and an end to war, his heart turned by a love affair with his nurse.

WHAT??  This was Baron Manfred von Richthofen?  The truth: he was a Prussian aristocrat who was a cavalry officer before he joined the air corps.  His father was a Prussian aristocrat and an army officer.  The Red Baron was the poster boy for the war effort and lionized by the public.  The fact and fiction are put together so that the truth becomes blurred.  I am the first to say film is art, and art can go into abstraction, but this is abstraction to the extreme.  They have turned the fighting ace--the Red Battle Flyer--into a loverboy and peacenik.

Many things are delightfully recognizable:  there is ace pilot Verner Voss, a close friend of Richthofen, but he is not portayed as Jewish.  (It it often held that Verner Voss was Jewish.)  The role of the Jewish pilot is given off to some other minor character who is killed off.  (Voss, BTW, was killed in his triplane and not an Albatros--with a mustached face painted on the cowling.)  There is Richthofen's family:  the father and mother (Baron Albrecht--unbearded--and Baroness Kunegunde), the sister Ilse as an army nurse, and (I think) the youngest brother Karl Bolko.  Even the Baron's dog Moritz makes an appearance, albeit as a German Wirehaired Pointer and not a Great Dane.  Would it have been that hard to hire a trained Great Dane for the movie?  The middle brother Lothar, also an ace in his own right, is given script prominence as a blood-thirsty combat pilot strutting about with his riding crop.

Matthias Schweighofer does an admirable job playing the Baron with conviction, but he is far too tall to be a convincing Richthofen with his statuesque height and tousled blond hair.  (The real Baron was quite short; photos show him almost the same height as nurse Katie.)

The costuming and sets show marvelous research and detail: the uniforms and flying kit of the combat pilots on both the Allied and Central sides, for instance.  Exact photos can be referenced to some scenes:  an Albatros biplane with a white Edelweiss flower (actually the plane of ace/dentist Paul Baumer, who does not appear in the film), the Baron's turtleneck sweaters, and even the Geschwaderstock, the squadron walking stick.  The Baron, after his head injury, is shown with his jaw wired shut and nursed by Katie Odersdorf (the real nurse Katie is spun into his love interest, eventually being seduced in an aerodrome tent, of all places!); in truth, it was Lothar who had his jaw wired shut after he was injured in a flying accident.

The flying scenes in CG images is engaging and entertaining.

With all of the painstaking research given to this film, why the melodrama?  I guess this is an entertaining film, but for fans of history and Manfred von Richthofen, the man, it's a disappointment.  So much more could have been made of this pioneer of air combat.  Some of his ideas are still taught at dogfighting schools such as Top Gun.  He was also an innovator in combat aircraft design, working with engineers on a three-wing design after a captured Sopwith triplane.  (Both Fokker and  Pfalz were in the running.)

I kept waiting for aeronautical engineer Anthony Fokker to show up.",1303344000,3,3490,4.718543046357616
4098493,4,B0039USJBK,"One of the absolutely funniest things I've read recently: The specialist reviewers who are livid about the historical accuracy of this film and more specifically Director Nikolai Mullerschon's choice to not depict the death of Richthofen.

Why did he do it? Because it's the very entrenched melodramatic mentality of these varied experts that the filmmakers were trying to avoid. If you show his death one way - the other dozen experts are suddenly up in arms, screaming their ""facts"", sputtering their perspectives, and of course, entirely missing the point. The Red Baron was dead.

Productions like this will always attract the very worst specialized kooks in life.

A mountaineering movie will be filled with angry mountaineers ""explaining"" to the masses how wrong the filmmakers were, what was wrong with the equipment, how wrong the techniques that were shown. A car racing movie... a skydiving movie... a sailing movie... a.... have you noticed that most of the A-type personalities and their specialized endeavors harbor the most venomous reviews?

Ironically, if you talk with these guys in real life, when discussing other rarified endeavors and their representation in the media, they couldn't give a crap. In their tunnel-visioned view = only their world is decreed pure, untouchable and unfilmable. (laughing)

There will never be a satisfactory movie for these self-absorbed knuckleheads - never.

So now my review.

A fascinating portrait of the world famous ""Red Baron"" - Manfred von Richthofen.

If what I've read about Von Richthofen is accurate - it is apparently verboten to depict the Baron as something other than a stout nationalist determined to win the war for the fatherland.

But then you have to remember, even the historically ""accurate"" biographical information is extraordinarily speculative. Beyond the specific dates and places - we can't know for certain what he thought or how he felt. Not with a degree of absolute certainty, especially since he died so young. Who can honestly say what you were thinking and feeling when you're 25 - is how you think and feel when you're 45, or even 65. With age comes perspective, and it's something we will never have since Richthofen was killed at an age when most of us were just beginning to mature into mental adulthood.

Honestly, think about it, he was twenty-five years old when he died.

So I appreciate the film for what it is, not what it was 'supposed' to be. From a pure film perspective I found it to be a touching portrait of the man who would become the greatest combat flyer of World War I. Certainly, the filmmakers were taking some fairly broad artistic liberties with the character. Would a dedicated officer, born to the aristocracy, question the imperial throne and his personage? Ludicrous. But it gave the film the required juxtaposition of light and dark - we have our hero, now we need the enemy. And certainly not the enemy of the flags, rather the embodiment of the other: The Warmonger.

Additionally, the aerial combat scenes were superior to most, including the heavily CGI-driven '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flyboys/dp/B000LAZE8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flyboys</a>'. I honestly felt like I was sitting in these first generation aircraft - impressive and breathtaking aerial dogfighting. The last time I felt like I was ""in the cockpit"" was 1975's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Waldo-Pepper/dp/B003L16F7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Waldo Pepper</a>"".

Again, this is not what I would consider a historically accurate film. It's fairly obvious that Mullerschon had romanticized his countryman - but can you judge a John Wayne combat movie with a critical eye toward realism? Or do you, as a cinephile, appreciate the story which is being told?

This is not actually a war film, that is to say, it is not an action film; so the amount of on-screen flying and dogfighting is minimal. The technical details are almost entirely correct. I did see where many aircraft types were in operation long before their historical entry date (and Lanoe Hawker flew a DeHavilland DH2, not an SE5). Compared to the travesty that was CGI ""flight"" in ""Fly Boys"", the flight and combat scenes in ""The Red Baron"" are epics of realism. I was satisfied visually with the little bit of war ""footage"" that this film gave me. Also, despite most of the critical, even objectionable commentary that I have read in the years since this movie first came out, I did not find the script particularly poor, as movie scripts go. There were no glaring embarrassments where my belief in the story, as it was being presented, was utterly suspended or offended.

Those are the positive aspects of the film. Now to the far weightier negative side:

This is meant to be an anti-war picture, using ""the Red Baron"" as the catalyst. Or, I should rather say, exploiting Manfred von Richthofen long after his death to make an anti-war statement - again and yet again, as if we haven't already got enough deliberately, politically correct anti-war films. But as an anti-war statement it largely fails. This is mainly because of the undue focus on the romantic relationship with Kate, the nurse who ministered to von Richthofen while he convalesced following a serious bullet wound to the head (unhistorically, inflicted by Roy Brown - Manfred was actually wounded by the gunner of an FE2 observation plane). Kate is a major character in this movie; no matter where Jasta 11 goes, there too goes the nurse. In their last scene together she even emerges from the baron's tent, having obviously spent the night. The romantic attachment is okay; it might even be mildly historical, since she and Richthofen would have seen a great deal of each other for weeks. But to have Kate also nurse Roy Brown earlier; then to have the two of them meet in ""No Man's Land"" and discuss her over sips of brandy from Brown's flask, is pushing the romantic ""triangle"" into strained emphasis. All we see in the end is this doomed, embryonic romance which dominates the plot and saps any anti-war message going on.

There is ""lip service"" paid several times throughout the picture to the horrors of war and the hypocrisy of the German propaganda machine that the media had become. But we never see more than a few severely wounded men in a hospital ward. There is no feeling of countless hundreds of thousands of troops doomed to push each other back and forth through curtains of lead and high explosive. All we see are a few dozen soldiers at a time. (Even Young Indiana Jones on TV got the panoramic scope of a massed advance across ""No Man's Land"" right.) ""The Red Baron"" shows virtually none of the horrors of war that it is out to decry. So as a film it fails in its purpose and leaves the viewer with a pallid, unconvincing love story instead; and not even a tragic one at that, since virtually everyone viewing the movie already knows that von Richtohofen was killed in combat.

The ""making of"" track hammers home the unhistorical relationship of Richthofen and Brown that the movie portrays, as if everything we've just seen actually happened, and in fact NONE of it happened. I found the ""making of"" track largely a waste of time. And the actors' interviews were shallow and groping (perhaps the actors are, I don't know).

So, in summation: I give three stars for the visuals and photography - it is a pretty picture; 2.5 stars for the casting and acting over all; if the historical accuracy (especially of Richthofen's personality) had been there I would give at least two stars for the script, but since the script's only virtue is that it is a film first and history last - and as such it is terrible factually - it gets only one star for script. And this crime of bogus ""facts"" masquerading as history is pounded home further in the ""making of"" documentary, making me want to kick some writers', directors' and producers' backsides around the block.",1301443200,2,4490,4.736572890025576
4098496,5,B0039USJBK,"The Red Baron, Manfred von Richthofen allows us to see the young inocense of the average warrior; then and now.  His real love: the game in the sky, is stolen by the first woman he ever saw, Kate.  She's the kind of woman that makes a man a man, and for Manfred:love at first site.

In the dialogues of Kate wooing Manfred there is an undercurrent of the first world war; so subtle; you'll almost miss; what's it all about.  WWI was after all the war to end all wars and the storytelling themes of that ere are very systematically; as ""Johnny Got His Gun;"" woven into Nikolai's pitch.

The mind of the noble were sophisticate and complex, yet humanely portrayed by the older, Roy.  Still a kid loving the game, with maturity; showing respect for the younger, brother, enemy.  As of old, in the more ancient story, the Art of War; respecting ones opponent is well played by his character.

The final chapter brings to life with a crescendo what war is like: someone facing his opponent will live and someone will die.  Few historical novals will meet the public image of what's good.  However, the human element of Nikolai's storytelling makes ""Red Baron"" superb.  Look again at the scenes, the admirable effort to bring the settings to life as it was during the turn of the 20th Century makes this film a masterpiece.

It does not work. ""The Blue Max"" is much better. Even the atrociously historically innacurate ""Von Richthofen and Brown"" is better. Is this supposed to be historically accurate?

This camel of a film tries to be many movies but succeeds at none. War flick, love story, or period piece. It comes up as a soap opera in uniform, but expect no ""FROM HERE TO ETERNITY""; not even ""A FAREWELL TO ARMS""; not even the Sandra Bullock remake! Blame it on its disregard for actual history, pointless story, uninteresting characters, organic romance (no chemistry whatsoever), or limited CGI action sequences amid an ocean of endless schmaltzy dialogue that tries hard to sound ""deep"". Thespianly speaking, Matthias Schweighofer plays the title role with frozen Ezekiel white bread gusto; Joseph Fiennes makes an unforgettable embarrassing cameo (remember me when you get to the scene where Roy Brown and Von Richthofen muse about life and death in no man's land), and shapely Lena Headey (300) manages to wear her signature ""Metamucil-ain't-working"" frown in every scene she's into (no triplane Fokker in any of them, in case you're wondering).

So, anyhow, the night before I'm to show this, I went ahead and watched it at home, attempting to make a viewing guide to go along with it.  Well, honestly, I thought it was fantastic.  I mean, the coincidences that they created to tie the characters together in a more cohesive manner were a little bit of a stretch, but I rather liked the addition of the love story and the emphasis that the pilot class of soldiers had a much different outlook on the war than the men in the trenches.  The contrast between the two, in fact, was what I chose to focus on for the assignment.  In the end, my students loved the movie (which, for at-risk kids from Detroit, is an amazing thing) and I have decided that this is something I need to own.

It portrayed the accurate view of the gentility of the pilots, vastly different than the in the trench common man warfare.  It was sensitive, and deeply developed the character of The Red Baron.  His awakening of consciousness by the nurse.  I found the movie to be beautifully acted and gave you a feel for the tragedy of such a brutal war clashing with romantic notions of war.  That, after all, was the symbolic conclusion of World War One.  Romanticism giving way to industrialization.  It was reflected in music, novels, and all forms of society after the war as well.  As Randal Wallace said about Braveheart, ""History should not be left to the historians"".  Further this is not a documentary.  This movie took no greater liberties than most do following ""loosely such themes.  One must be able to see the archetypes and yield to the deeper understanding.

4098515,4,B0039USJBK,"I have been a WWI and WWII aviation buff since I was 10 years old.  When I was 12, my parents took my brother and me to see the then-acclaimed ""Midway"" with Charlton Heston in 1977.  I enjoyed the movie, but enjoyed more pointing out to my parents and brother the facts the movie got right and those it didn't.  Whenever I see a war movie, I'm usually critical about the facts not depicted correctly.  As many reviewers here have pointed out, ""The Red Baron"" takes many liberties with the facts and when I started watching it, I proverbially sighed and thought this was an opportunity wasted.  However, I became increasingly engrossed in the film as it progressed.  I suspect many will disagree with me, especially the aviation history aficionados, but I have to say this is an interesting and entertaining film that captures the spirit of WWI combat aviation even as it takes many liberal liberties with the facts.  It accurately depicts how the early WWI pilots valued chivalry and saw their war as a sport, not the bloody combat it was, and how as the war progressed, the reality of war became increasingly clear to the pilots.  Manfred von Richthofen is accurately portrayed in the beginning as interested in nothing else but shooting down his prey.  Although it is unclear whether von Richthofen actually harbored the same doubts as in the movie as the war progressed, this motif accurately captures the grimness of war.  The aerial combat scenes were well-done and are the centerpiece of the film, and show the potential of CGI and hopefully more WWI and WWII aviation movies will build on this promise.  I was completely captivated by all the aviation combat scenes, as well as the opener in which Richthofen and his comrades ""attend"" the funeral of a British fighter pilot in their aircraft and drop a wreath, somewhat incredibly, into the pilot's grave.  I'm particularly impressed with the accuracy of the Albatros and Fokker Triplane fighter recreations.  Although the movie spliced the many historical figures into fictional relationships--the great fighter ace Werner Voss was a friendly rival of Richthofen's, but never a close comrade as depicted in the film; Lanoe Hawker never flew a Royal Aircraft SE-5 as it appeared well after his death--I was impressed that almost all the major characters were correctly named after their historical prototypes.

Yes, the movie twists the facts around greatly--the fictionalized scenes with Roy Brown, the RFC pilot who was initially credited with shooting down von Richthofen before facts showed the ace was downed by ground fire, will make many historians gag.  I can immediately count at least 10 facts the film morphs into fiction.  I also have to comment on one other aspect of the movie.  I thought the producers admirably included a Jewish German fighter pilot as one of Richthofen's close comrades and the movie noted at the end that this pilot never existed, but was instead a composite for the real Jewish German fighter pilots who flew in WWI.  The producers lost an opportunity here, though, in completely neglecting to depict Werner Voss's Jewish ancestry.  They could have depicted Voss's Jewish heritage instead of creating a fictional pilot.  However, if one looks at this movie as a novelized bio-pic of Manfred von Richtehofen, this is an engaging and enjoyable dramatization, marred only by the clumsy intimate scenes between Richthofen and Kate, the nurse who in real life only helped care for the ace after his head wound and remained a friend, but did not have a romance with him.  At least one German WWII fighter pilot wrote a novelized version of his autobiography--Gunther Bloemertz with ""Heaven Next Stop""; Bloemertz was a fighter pilot with JG 26--and it was well-received in Germany and worldwide, eventually translated into several languages and incurring several orders.  I think ""The Red Baron"" can be viewed similarly.  I recommend this film for those who are interested in a period WWI aviation film and who can appreciate the spirit beyond the facts.  The movie is worth seeing for the aviation scenes alone.  Admittedly, those who demand historical accuracy will proverbially gag if they view this movie.",1290038400,,4195,4.992816091954023

And it definitely lived up to that expectation!  The film is absolutely gorgeous in its cinematography.  The lighting is wonderful, the locations and sets are incredible, and the historic detail (whether accurate or not) takes you right back to the beginning of the 20th century.  Even the special effects are top notch, giving you the sense of flying through the air in WWI planes.  The casting was perfect in my opinion.  German actor Matthias Schweigh&ouml;fer lights up the screen and has an incredible magnetism to him in this role.  His smile and his emotions pull you in.  Apparently he also played a small role in Valkyrie (2008), Tom Cruise's WWII epic about the attempted German assassination of Adolf Hitler.  Another good movie by the way! Lena Headey from 300 (2006) plays the love interest for the Baron and her resistance to his charms is fun to watch. The costumes are really good in this flick as well, giving the ""war"" film an interesting feel that I wouldn't have expected.  I imagine the costumes are based in historical accuracy and that these fighter pilots didn't have the strict Nazi Uniform of WWII yet.

While the movie is very good, I feel like something is missing from it.  Probably from a story standpoint.  I think the story didn't quite pull together all of the emotion and powerful acting that I felt and saw throughout the film.  The actors really made me feel their roles, but it was like it was for nothing...no cause.  Somehow, the WWI cause was just not giving enough story or context for me to have all of this emotion bump up against.  But I definitely want to watch this movie a second time before making my final rating on it.  But this movie is definitely worth viewing and appreciating simply for its cinematic qualities.

4098646,3,B0039USJBK,"THE RED BARON, a film about won of aviation's greatest figures, barely gets off the tarmac.  Written and directed by Nikolai M&uuml;llersch&ouml;n it seems to have good intentions - sharing the very brief life of Manfred von Richtohofen (2 May 1892 - 21 April 1918) historically known as the' Red Baron' who was a German fighter pilot with the Luftstreitkr&auml;fte during World War I, having the record of 80 air combat victories. The unique aspect of von Richthofen's career was the fact that he was admired by all fliers for his unique strategies and flying acrobatics while having as his goal the downing of enemy aircraft rather than the killing of men.

The presentation of the film in segments, each labeled with a place and date, makes this film seem almost documentary in nature, and perhaps that excuses the presence of one of the weakest scripts to it the screen.  The dialogue is stilted and silly, leaving very little room for character development.  Another problem with the film is the casting of Matthias Schweigh&ouml;fer as the Red Baron.  He lacks chemistry with almost everyone else on the screen, most of all the ludicrous 'love affair' he has with  nurse K&auml;te Otersdorf (Lena Headey).  The cast does include two fine actors - Til Schweiger and Joseph Fiennes (the Canadian flier with whom the Red Baron has as interesting a relationship as  with anyone else in the story) and the actors in the smaller roles deliver acceptable performances given the script form which they must create.

The film begins to be interesting  (outside of some acceptable aerial photography) when the Red Baron discovers he is being used as a propaganda pawn for the Germans, a fact he loathes and actually seems to live up to his reputation for being not only clever and skilled but also compassionate.

4098648,3,B0039USJBK,"Sweet! A WW1 aviation movie that uses state-of-the art technology to show some of the incredible aircraft and air battles over the Western Front! Super sweet!

Bitter! Too many liberties taken with known facts...the real von Richtofen is almost unrecognizable in this portrayal. The Rittmeister was a cold-blooded professional soldier and an unforgiving Prussian aristocrat. A real Darth Vader, not a Luke Skywalker.

Did you see the 1960's film ""The Battle of Britain""? The director took an actual event and its real characters and turned out an entertaining movie that basically stuck to historical truth. A certain amount of Hollywood generalization was neccessary in the interests of brevity, but it wasn't extensivley fictionalized in order to sell movie tickets and DVD's. Surprisingly it did really well at the Box office; it was evident then that audiences actually prefer to see truth when directors are interpreting historical facts. That is the reason why ""The Battle of Britain"" shall remain a classic, and why ""The Red Baron"" can only be considered 'entertainment.'

The Hollywood war-movie 'recipe' has become painfully obvious over the last few decades, and in a movie about the wartime exploits of the ruthlessly ambitious Manfred von Richtofen such a formula was completely unneccesary. Let me show you what I mean;

HOLLYWOOD RECIPE for a WAR MOVIE

1. Have a chance meeting and even bonding between enemies (in this case, between von Richtofen and real-life opponent RAF Captain Brown - never happened)
2. Lead character is to develop anti-establishment, anti-war sentiments (here, von Richtofen defies superiors - unheard of for a Prussian officer),
3. Construct a romantic interest using a VERY HOT nurse (von Richtofen's nurse, Fraulein Otersdorf in this one - the real von R. had a long-term love interest from his own aristocratic class and doted on her frequent letters to him at the front)
4. Insert a plucky Jewish comrade-in-arms somewhere (here it's the fictional ""Sternberg""...This was weird - revisions to history to stimulate Hollywood's financiers, perhaps?
5. Sprinkle generously with crowded, breathtaking action and battle scenes, set to an awesome soundtrack (actually no complaints here).

All that said, ""The Red Baron"" does do for Manfred von Richtofen what ""A Knight's Tale"" did for medieval jousting legend Ulrich von Leichtenstein. It goes some way to reveal how much a culture's most successful warriors were celebrated like demi-gods in their day. In sad contrast to how our own shallow culture now idolizes Reality TV vermin and ignores its true heroes.

The young actors are extraordinary despite the liberties taken with the facts, and the film is still bloody entertaining as art. There is no doubt about the talent and star-quality of Mattias Schweighofer (von Richtofen) and Til Schweiger (Voss). I would love to see them, or similar young European actors, as young Luftwaffe pilots in a 1940's era ""JV 44"" or ""Defense of the Reich"" movie. With the caveat that it is done well, and with a nod to historical accuracy. Hollywood should not give up on producing/funding aviation combat movies - far from it - It has the talent and the means to do wonders. Just next time let the facts drive the plot. The truth often needs no embellishment, and in this case the incredible exploits of Manfred von Richtofen were exciting enough.",1281571200,3,3376,5.160877513711152
4098649,3,B0039USJBK,"""Every once in a while a movie comes along that you can't wait to see, but when you finally get to see it, you realize -- sigh -- that it's just a movie, and not a very good one at that. ""The Red Baron"" hit me that way.

Made a couple of years ago, ""Der Rote Baron"" was supposedly the most expensive film ever made in Germany, and when it was released, it was a tremendous flop. It was hard to figure out why from reviews. The YouTube clips of the flying sequences looked tremendous. Apparently, Germans don't care much for war movies these days, even those that star a great national hero.

It took from then until now for the film to be released on disk(in the USA.) I tried to pick one up at Suncoast, but the girl there told me tartly that a film like that doesn't appeal to ""their"" class of customers. Shrug. Order a copy of ""The Red Baron"" on Blu-Ray, which arrived promptly. . .

The Red Baron is Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen, the highest-scoring ace of the Greta War, with 80 victories, one of the first superstar pilots and a pop-culture icon. He was the terror of the Western Front until he was shot down by either Canadian pilot Roy Brown or a gang of Aussie soldiers on the ground popping off with rifles.

. . .With a grand budget and the latest CGI techniques, and ""The Red Baron"" looks terrific and the aeroplanes are wonderfully accurate. The old gang is here, particularly Voss, although the new movie makes him a grizzled veteran instead of a talented teen. Nikolai Mllerschn, who wrote and directed, also adds a fictional Jewish pilot, although there were plenty of real Jewish pilots in the Fliegerkorps, such as Wilhelm Frankl. It's an odd political move that smells like apologia.

. . .interestingly, it makes much of the German pilots' veneration of ace Oswald Boelcke, almost as if he were a religious figure.

Virtually every (previously published) review of ""The Red Baron"" points out it fails whilst on the ground, although it soars while in the air. Absolutely true. Taking the audience along in the dreamlike trance of flight is something movies are good at. It's not only a thrill ride for the audience, it also helps explain the motivations of the pilots.

There are many things that go wrong here. One is the reoccurring figure of Roy Brown (Joseph Fiennes) who seems to slip through the Western Front with ease just to have chitchats with von Richthofen. Another is a drummed-up romance with nurse (Lena Headey) that relies on her having abrupt changes of personality in every scene. And it's storytelling suicide to cheat the audience out of the the two most famous dogfights in the Great War, von Richthofen vs. Brown, and Voss vs. a whole sky full of British SE.5s. These battles, that should have been the cathartic heart of the film, are simply shrugged away.

It also doesn't help that Matthias Schweighfer, who plays the title role, is thuddingly void of command charisma. It's partly the fault of the script, which pushes the image of von Richthofen as a rather sweet, sensitive soul who just happens to kill dozens on men in vicious aerial combat.

The main problem, though, is that Mllerschn just couldn't decide what his film was about. It needed a tough rewrite from someone who could keep eyes on the prize. Is ""The Red Baron"" a meditation on the evolving spirit of German martial ardor during the 20th Century? An analysis of the conflict  between command and celebrity? A three-way romance between a pilot, his gal and his fighter plane? An engaging bio-pic about someone was once a world-famous figure, and is now a label on a frozen pizza?

This last is the worst. If you're going to tell the story of a historic character, even if you have to telescope events and personalities, at least get his personality right. Otherwise, it's literally character assassination. Von Richthofen was a dangerous, wily aerial tactician; a killer; a charismatic leader; a superb manager of public image. That's an interesting person. This rather damp, twee youngster posing in aviator togs in ""The Red Baron"" is just playing dress-up.""

4098663,2,B0039USJBK,"The planes are beautiful, if historically inappropriate.

The dialogue is slopping and frequently childish or even silly.

But it's the editing that is really to blame here.

Someone said the movie was originally longer but edited down for the American audience. Whoever did it should be flogged.

As one example, there is a scene where the Baron and friends have been bounced by a larger force of fighters, coming right out of the sun and on their tails. The baron is being chased by someone supposedly a very dangerous enemy pilot, and suddenly, we see the baron shooting down a two-seater and no sign of the enemy fighters. No explanation-- just bad editing. That the 2 seater supposedly carries Roy Brown and that the form a friendship and have several conversations together is just bad fairy tale. But the editing makes this truly wretched.

I disagree with another reviewer about a competing movie. While ""Flyboys"" had some really silly stuff (like the entire German air force was made up of red fokker triplanes and the fight scenes generally felt like a video game), there was actually a STORY that a person could watch and enjoy. Yes, some historical gaffes and some silliness, but you could follow the story, get involved with the characters, and have a sense of beginning, middle, and end.

You get none of that in Red Baron.

I did not think anyone could make a movie worse than ""Von Richthofen and Brown,"" but they did.

If it wasn't for the beautiful planes, I'd give it zero stars. As it was, they are fabulous and most of them based on real paint schemes.",1279843200,3,1572,4.6909090909090905

After finishing watching the film I was highly disapointed in the fact that Someone edited the film from it's original version to an illogical way at times.  No idea if it was even approved by the films director, but I find the changes highly disapointing and they now shadow a film which I fell in love with whense everyone else I know through the film was already lacking.  It is just not the same film when they have one pilot flying three different airplanes in the same scene because the editing for this version of the film was so bad, even cut one of my favorite scenes as they used most of it for one of their edited air battle scenes.  As the film stands now, if someone didn't see the original I feel sorry for them.  I can't even rate this film in the way I wanted, if I could I'd refund it because of the changes.  They butchard the Richthofen vs Brown fight, took battle clips from several scenes so they could add a scene where Hawker gets shot down which they never had in the original film.  As well as cutting entirely Luther's oil leak engine trouble as they took part of the scene for their Hawker battle edit.  This is really unacceptable, this is not a Japanese cartoon show being edited for American TV in the 80s!  I could call the film still good, but seeing a Sophwith Camel show up in 1916 because of editing is something I'd think a 1960s film would of made just for the sake of lack of special effects and option aircraft to use.",1276819200,25,1615,4.321192052980132

However, It's completely modern in its sentiment and not at all reflective of the times. Furthermore it is hopelessly inaccurate. There is too much made of the romance between Richtofen and his nurse than there is support for and multiple meetings between Richtofen and Roy Brown that are completely fanciful. If it were ""just a WWI movie"" I might shrug and say ""oh well, movies"", but it pretends to be an accurate biography and it is far, far from it.

4098671,3,B0039USJBK,"I have had a fascination with World War I since I was a young boy. My grandfather fought in the ""war to end all wars."" My father bought me a copy of Floyd Gibbons' ""The Red Knight of Germany"" when I was 8 years old and I have read it several time since. I have read as many books on World War I aviation as I could afford and possess several film doumentaries about the war. I have seen and own ""Wings,"" ""Hell's Angels,"" ""The Dawn Patrol,"" ""The Blue Max,"" ""Richthofen and Brown,"" and ""Flyboys,"" among others.  When I found out there was a film called ""The Red Baron,"" I immediately pre-ordered it. I was excited to see how a German film would portray him. I am not a film-goer who is overawed by CGI. I look for a good story and, if possible, minimal effects to enhance real time action. I was quite disapointed in ""The Red Baron.""

First of all, it was done in Englsh. I thought, at least, that they would work a bilingual film on us. Second, I was downheartned by the story choices made by the filmmaker. I understand dramatic license, so I was willing to overlook the contrived multiple personal meetings between Richthofen and Capt. Roy Brown. I was even willing to suspend my disbelief and accept that he had an affair with his nurse. It was good to see Werner Voss in his sweater tinkering round in the repair shop. I know that Richthofen wore a turtleneck sweater on the flightline. I just wish his characterization had a little more formality to it. It even had Richthofen greet the Chief of the German Air Service, General Von Hoeppner, casually attired (tsk,tsk). What I can't forgive is the gratuitous passing over of the final showdown in the air. Whichever way the filmmaker chose to end it, either being shot down by Brown or by anti-aircraft fire from the ground, I just wanted to see what they would do. Unfortunately, they chose to ignore it and leave an anti-climactic feeling suffocating their audience. Last, I wish that the CGI wizards would spend more time researching and watching real planes work in the sky. There are times in ""The Red Baron"" where I would rather watch real planes or good model work than sit through the CGI offerings. In the film's favor, I will say that it was wonderful to see an Albatros fighter in the sky, even if it was CGI. Audiences are used to Fokker Triplanes and D-VIIs. We have even seen the Pfalz D III in the air. Finally, we get to see the Albatros. My thanks to the filmmakers for that.

4098672,3,B0039USJBK,"At age 20 I knew more about Von Richthofen's entire life than the director and his crew seems to show -- though it was their task (& stated goal) to create THE movie about his life.  Non! For the life of me, I can't fathom who makes decisions in the creating of historic dramas.. the director? the producers? the studio?  WHO?  Because just about everything they could get wrong, they did.  Do the actors not do any research?  If so, why don't the actors have the guts to ask to director and producer, ""Hey, why don't we stick to history? Roy Brown didn't know the Baron, nor were they drinking buddies, why are we fabricating whole fiction and destroying true history? This is bound to infuriate fans of history, the audience for these types of dramas.""  It wasn't as bad as FLYBOYS, but then again, nothing has been that bad.  I was so hoping it would be DAS BOOT of the air, perhaps with the same director.  Watching the extras on the disk, it always drives me crazy when they talk about how much research they did, and how much CGI magic went into creating the most realistic everything, ever, etc..  But then the movie MASACREs the true story of the Red Baron.  How can you brag about being realistic, when you masacre the story? I kept asking myself as I watched this, ""Why?""  Why leave out out his most famous battle - his last?  Are people too afraid to take up the issue of who shot down the Red Baron?  The History Channel took it up, and did a marvelous job.  The movie has some very realistic-looking scenes. At moments, it really captures the era; I loved the howitzer scenes at the front which reminded me of my days on the Ft. Lewis artillery range, and for that I give it 3 stars. As for the ""true"" story of the Red Baron, as advertised in the disk extras, it was a fail, trying to be too much like FLY BOYS... love story & the futility of war, all that.

4098683,5,B0039USJBK,"Let me start off by saying, I have seen just about every movie on World War One aviation. The Red Baron and Flyboys are the ones I enjoyed the most. I waited for this for nearly 4 years but it was well worth the wait. It starts off when he was kid and sees an airplane for the first time then takes off from there. It showed the relationship he had with his squadron and the people around him. The dogfights scenes are spectacular, especially the night flying scene. It was nice to see flying the red Albatros and Fokker DR1 airplanes. There can always be more of them though, you can never have too many ww1 aerial duels. The romance between him nurse Kate was a little overboard but not too bad. Manfred did have sense of humor, which was in the film. He also rode a bike from time to time. There is a picture of him doing so in the book Under The Guns Of The Red Baron. I don't think he ever met Roy Brown, but who knows? He probably didn't tell people everything he did either. It should have shown his last flight but with all the contreversey surrounding his death, it probably would have cost too much. With all the documentries such as: Who Killed The Red Baron, Red Baron and the Wings Of Death, Death of The Red Baron etc its all good.

Ostensibly, this is the story of the German ace,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baron-Manfred-von-Richthofen/dp/097918133X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baron Manfred von Richthofen</a>&nbsp;(Matthias Schweighfer), who had 80 confirmed kills, making him the greatest flying ace in that or any other war.  But writer-director Nikolai Mullerschon wants to tell the story of a true knight of the air, making the Richthofen not only German nobility but a German nobleman, who insists the goal is to shoot down planes rather than kill pilots.  This ideal of aerial combat should stand in stark contrast to the horrific trench warfare happening on the ground, where troops had to contend with such innovations as poison gas, machine guns, tanks, and aerial bombardments, but Mullerschon is more interested in painting his main character as not just a gentleman hero, but a clearly German one.  In 1918, Richthofen died in April and the war ended in November, and in this film the character actually tells his superiors that they should end the war because, from his purely practical perspective, they are not going to win the war.  Clearly, this is a Manfred von Richthofen who has contemporary post-Vietnam sensibilities.

Consequently, not only does this film turn the title character into a different type of hero, it fails to pull off the effort.  In the same spirit of revisionism the film offers up the fictional character of Friedrich Sternberg (Maxim Mehmet), who represents the handful of Jewish aviators who fought for Germany.  Instead of constituting ominous foreshadowing of what is to happen with the Third Reich in the next generation, this is just another element suggesting these characters represent good Germans.  The Red Baron's chivalrous notions are rejected by his younger brother, Lothar (Volker Bruch), who is only too happy to fight without the pretenses of elegance.  But that fraternal conflict, and the larger debate about the nature of warfare it represents, are never fleshed out in any meaningful way.  I looked up Schweighfer's age, because I thought he looked a tad too young to play Richthofen, but it turns out he is the ballpark.  Still, he and the rest of the German aces are so young and handsome that they look like a Barvarian brat pack and I was worried that if they stood out in the sun their skin would start sparkling.

The final and grossest outrage offered is the idea that Richthofen and Captain Roy Brown (Ralph Fiennes), the Canadian flier credited at the time with shooting down the Red Baron, are friendly enemies.  History is rewritten so that Richthofen shot down Brown and then saved his life, setting up Brown's rather ungentlemanly failure to return both parts of the favor.  But then this movie decides to just skip the episode of Richthofen's death and the controversy over who actually fired the fatal bullet that killed him (I think the evidence clearly supports that bullet was fired by someone on the ground and not by Brown from his airplane).  This would be like skipping the last leg of Amelia Earhart's fatal attempt to fly around the world in ""Amelia.""  For that matter, not only does the movie skip a key part of the end of Richthofen's life, it also omits his early time in the war, where he started off as a cavalry officer before switching the air corps and learning how to be a fighter pilot from Major Oswald Boelke.  There is also a relationship between Richthofen and Kte Otersdorf (Lena Headey), the nurse who takes care of him after he is wounded, but this turns out not to be romantic but more an opportunity for our hero to wax rhetorical on the way he sees fighting.  Neither the script nor the acting transforms Richthofen into a memorable heroic figure.  Take away the impressive tally of 80 confirmed kills and there is simply not much here to make an impression.

When it comes to movies about the First World War, it seems that the greatest ones are going to end up being the black and white classics made in the decades after the war, with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wings/dp/B001R28D2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wings</a>"" (the film that won the first Oscar for Best Picture), ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Quiet-on-the-Western-Front/dp/B000KGGJ0Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All Quiet on the Western Front</a>,"" and, my favorite, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sergeant-York/dp/B000HWZ4CA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sergeant York</a>.""

Besides, a ""true"" World War I movie has to have either trench warfare or biplanes, none of which really apply to those later films.  Even with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gallipoli/dp/B000BDH6C6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gallipoli</a>,"" where you have the trenches, but the message of that classic Australian films is that the English were always looking to stick it to those members of the Empire from Down Under, which ultimately puts it more in the same category as ""Breaker Morant,"" than other tales of the Great War.

4098686,3,B0039USJBK,"Allow me to say, I've anxiously awaited the release of this DVD in U.S. format as I'm an extreme military history enthusiast, especially in the fields of WWI and WWII aviation and armor.  I've watched clips of this movie and the trailers for it on youtube for well over a year and expected it to have the fluffy love story others have complained about, but, that is just one of the movie's many problems.  Once again, movie makers have proven they have NO IDEA who the audience is for HISTORICALLY THEMED MOVIES!  I'm starting to get really amazed at how consistently movie makers miss the mark - and waste magnificent opportunities to make a great movie in the process.

First off, everything was here for them to make the end-all fantastic movie about the life of Manfred Von Richtofen.  They built 23 Albatros and Fokker airplanes for this film for pity's sake!  Then, all of the flying, apparently, is done using green screen and CG technology - there is no ""real"" flying in the movie.  Watch the extra features, they show how this was done - I was stunned.

On the plus side, this movie is far better than ""Flyboys"" which was just horrible.  On the downside, I have no idea who this movie's about, because it darn sure isn't about Manfred Von Richthofen.  The only things they got right here are that he was German and he had a red airplane - other than that, they made everything else up from scratch.  His friendship with Werner Voss is touched upon, but only because they use Voss (shamefully) to push along the pointless and fictional love story between Richthofen and a nurse who seems to be everywhere.  The actual careers of the pilots themselves is entirely glossed over.  Voss's phenomenal last flight isn't shown and if you don't pay attention, you won't even realize when Richtofen finds out he's been killed.  Likewise, Von Richtofen's last flight isn't shown at all.  There's actually very little flying in this movie - almost all the flight scenes are up on youtube.

If you're going to make a movie about Manfred Von Richtofen, it should've started when Oswald Boelke picked him out to join Jasta 2, and show him learning from the master to forge his skills.  This movie starts months after Boelke's death just before MvR is awarded his Blue Max - a downright pointless place to start I thought.  Believe it or not, in this movie, MvR and Captain Roy Brown ARE CLOSE FRIENDS!  WHAT?!!!  In fact, Manfred shoots Brown down in early 1917, Brown escapes from a POW camp, they meet again later after having both been shot down, share drinks and notes on the SAME nurse, then they just pal around!  WHAT A CROCK!  You really have to struggle to write history this badly.  Then, all the German troops in the trenches look like they just got back from the dry cleaners.

The only reason I give this movie any props at all is because the actors did great with the terrible script they were given - the acting is quite good.  The aerial scenes are spectacular and look quite real, even though there aren't enough of them.  And, they got the uniform details right, even though they went a little too floppy on the caps.

Perhaps someday, someone will do a GOOD movie on this legendary figure and do so without having to insert 80% fictional fluff and filler.  Richtofen, Voss, and Roy Brown deserved a much better telling of their story than this.",1276041600,160,3357,4.5966386554621845

In Flyboys, all Germany planes were painted as if they were the Red Baron (minus the one mystery ace who fly a black plane) and they all flew the experimental Fokker D.III triplane that saw only limited production because of its lame engine/top speed and horrible visibility. At least Manfred spends most of his time in an Albatross in this movie (as he actually flew) so I can't see how a 'WWI buff' could support Flyboys EVER.

My wife is a historian of Europe and she was so well pleased to see the recreations of the WW1 time in the cities. I've been a very long reader of the Baron's books and studied his history for a very long time. When I had heard this was movie was coming out on DVD I got very excited. Some scenes were a bit off track and the love angle was a bit over played, but mostly it stayed very close to his story, even where the nurse asks him what he's writing and he tells her it was his story.

As for the fight scenes I really enjoyed those lots of good action and to see the Baron in his Red Albatross chasing down his targets was pretty cool. When they showed him flying his red tri-plane I was pretty pleased with how they had kept his paint scheme the same as pictures of his prize plane show.

All in all an excellent movie, great story line, and over all exceptional acting. I was a tad disappointed there were very few extra's, but maybe an upgraded DVD will come out later on.",1275868800,2,1153,4.052631578947368
4098689,3,B0039USJBK,"I recommend this film if you are looking for a good, old-fashion, fictional war movie and not a historical depiction of the Red Baron's military career.  The special effects were very good.  However, the open scene where a youthful Richtofen is hunting with his younger brother Lothar and his cousin Wolfram really misses it.  Richthofen, even at an early age, was an avid hunter and not easily distracted from his prey as his later military career reflects, and what contributed to his death at age 25.  His interest in aviation came in 1915, after World War One had already begun, and when it became evident that the cavalry had become obsolete.  One scene, when Richthofen is seen sitting with his fellow pilots in a brothel and drinking, indicates that the writers did not do a great deal of research concerning the Red Baron's personality.  The fact that the writers have Richthofen and Brown meeting in the middle of No Man's Land after basically shooting each other down, and then have them become somewhat friendly is really stretching things.  But if you can get past what you know about the historical Red Baron, stop dissecting the movie for historical inaccuracies (as my wife suggested I do), then you can come away with enjoying an interesting film.

I was looking forward to seeing Lena Heady (300) and Joseph Fiennes in the cast but it was Matthias Schweighofer who stole the movie for me. Besides being insanely good looking his acting was intense and subtle. I am very much surprised we haven't heard more of him here in the United States.

The movie action wasn't over the top because while this is a WWI movie it also has a human element to it. The sets, costumes and decoration were beautifully done -- takes you to another era. Very top notch. The cinematography was stunning especially one of the final scenes of the trees. (If you liked Terrance Malick's the New World's look and feel this movie may be up your alley) The score was haunting and moving.

Overall this movie strives to be more than just a guy's action flick or a chick flick with token flying scenes. The Red Baron tries to be more ambitious and in my opinion succeeds wonderfully.",1275436800,8,1256,4.4803493449781655

The Kaiser, Wilhelm II was portrayed as wise and very kind which influenced all of his decisions pertaining to his war planning. It was very interesting to see a more in depth look at the life of the Red Baron a real WWI German hero.
Has English subtitles. Not difficult at all.",1521504000,,371,4.470588235294118
