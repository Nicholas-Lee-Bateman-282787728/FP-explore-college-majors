8192996,5,6303486711,"Leslie Chase (Robert Patrick), a ruthless property developer,  heard the last gasp from the Totec indian chieftan he killed. Now the spirits from all the dead tribe live in his body. They have deathly needs which Chase is now compelled to act out. I really enjoyed this movie. It has a great storyline and is written in MY favourite genre - movies to watch in the dark! ... and ladies... the best parts of all are when Robert Patrick takes his shirt off. I've watched it four times so far and am still counting. A definite 5 stars.",987033600,4,531,4.418367346938775
