3415880,5,B0018CWEVW,brothers and sisters was the best family  drama since iguess 7th heaven its very hard finding family dramas of course both are opisite from each other. im very excited for this 2 come out.,1213833600,3,188,4.529411764705882
3415881,3,B0018CWEVW,LOVE this show. So amazing. My problem is that fact that since the writers strike went on for so long.....how much of a full (second) season could this be? Please check the number of episodes before your purchase.,1213315200,10,213,4.631578947368421

3415883,4,B0018CWEVW,"Season 2 got more intense. Older sister Sara's marriage collapsed and Joe got nasty. Kitty and Robert still try to have a child, Kevin winds up back with Scotty. Uncle Sal finally 'came out'. I think the best scenes this season were with Dave Aannable and Sally field. Justin came back from Iraq injured and refused to take any medication for the pain. His mother and doctors talked him into it and he again got hooked. That was hard to watch but very touching. I hope for some good DVD extras.",1211846400,8,494,4.43956043956044
3415884,5,B0018CWEVW,"Brothers & Sisters is truly one of the finest dramas currently on network television. The show's writers embrace current and highly pertinent issues in modern day North America, and work them into the story line of each episode beautifully.

The cast of actors is one of the most talented we have seen to date- Sally Field, Rachel Griffiths, Calista Flockhart, Rob Lowe, Ron Rifkin, and Emily Vancamp are standouts among them all. Field's role as the matriarch of the family is particularly stunning, and her brilliant ability is even further explored in the second season as she is forced to make tough decisions about her life, and is faced with further conflict created by her family. Griffiths provides another extremely compelling performance as Sarah Walker, who is forced to deal with her crumbling marriage.

Throughout the second season, the storylines become more complicated and the Walker family is thrown into a tangled web of turmoil and deception. I would highly recommend this DVD if you enjoyed the first season- it only gets better!",1209859200,13,1050,5.063583815028902

3415946,3,B0018CWEVW,"I started watching this series because I was such a fan of Ally McBeal, starring Calista Flockhart, who plays one of the Sisters in this series, but I couldn't stand all the homosexual propaganda.  Ally McBeal also pushed the homosexual agenda, but not, to me, as nauseatingly and overtly as this series.  It is a sign of our times when even children are depicted taking homosexual relationships for granted, as if they were as common and admirable as reading, writing, and arithmetic.  For someone who agrees that homosexuality is good and normal, this series would probably be immensely amusing and entertaining.  For a homophobe like me, or anyone who believes what Leviticus 18:22 correctly states that a man lying with a man as with a woman is an abomination, this series is probably not for them.",1450051200,,802,4.875

3416113,5,B0018CWEVW,"TV series ""BROTHERS & SISTERS"" showcases a family portrait par excellance.  Walker matriarch (a singularly gifted Sally Field) has reared a family of five whose relationships may be seen as 21st Century American.  No room for antiquated or hypocritical squeamish ideas of ethics or morality here, the large international cast is arguably the finest in TV series history.  The brilliant writers (creator Jon Robin Baitz & team), directors (Ken Olin & team), in short, everyone connected with this vehicle is top notch.  Season 2 covers diverse issues from multi-fasceted revealed secrets (of Dad's, played by Tom Skerritt) which affect all, to a refreshingly honest and 'normal' homosexual relationship shown with the highest level of intelligence and profundity.  (Matthew Rhys, a handsome Welsh actor with a perfect voice, here a particular standout as family lawyer, Kevin, who meets his match in Luke MacFarlane as non-family member, Scotty, the only soberingly honest character full of quick wit, sincerity, ethics & panache - no small feat.)  It covers politics & pundits brilliantly (excellently played by Rob Lowe & Calista Flockhart) from close range, and the unfortunate factor that no amount of money can help conceive a baby with a mother's damaged uterus - a devastating and daunting challenge.  It also covers a devastating divorce (a delicious Rachel Griffiths as Sarah creates another finely-etched portrait), a returning warrior from Afghanistan war, Justin, played by Dave Annable (a gifted & handsome young actor with a brilliant future), and the possible threat of losing the family business (Balthazar Getty plays Tommy, imbued with his father, William Walker's business acumen/hidden flaw, he is quiet and likeable and I, at least, root for Tommy to outdistance his father.)  Last, but definitely, no least, there is the seeming family nemesis, Holly Harper (played with relish by Emmy winner Patricia Wettig), and  finally, Holly's daughter, Rebecca (played by a fresh and beautiful find, Emily VanCamp.  Her beauty seems to radiate from within).  I recommend this thoughtfully conceived, multi-level drama to anyone seeking to fill his/her TV viewing time with grade 'A' relevancy.",1297987200,,2204,5.415204678362573

Also when I called to Amazon telling them that they have sent me 3 of Brothers and Sisters instead of 1 as I had ordered, the guy answering me the phone call said oooh! I loved that  one too, isn't it wonderful?

3416168,5,B0018CWEVW,"In my opinion this is one of the best written TV shows about a family in a long time.  Each and every episode will make you both laugh & cry.  Granted the Walker family has money, but the issues they face are issues we all face, they are real people dealing with real issues.  You can relate to this family, you share their happiness & feel their sadness.  Sometimes they do the right thing & other times they fall flat on their faces, but no matter what happens the writers & actors make sure you feel it right along with the characters.  Each actor plays their role perfectly and have transformed themselves into their character flawlessly, with the natural little quirks & habits we all have.  The humor is well done and the drama keeps you coming back for more.  The Walkers are a fantastic family and the most believable to come along in a long time.",1257292800,,855,4.407643312101911

3416173,1,B0018CWEVW,"I put in the fifth disc in this set to continue watching Brothers and Sisters, only to realise it was the 'extras' ! The series ran for just 16 episodes rather than the 23 of the first season! I presume season 2 was curtailed because of the Hollywood writers strike?

What was even worse though was that the whole season and last epsiode ended in such a way that I just DO NOT CARE what happens next to the upscale, millionaire Walker family. The plot progression is either so fast it's lost if you blink, or they introduce characters for the mother and one of the sons just to give them something to do!

The key WEAKNESS of the show (apart from the sugary/ over sincere scriptwriting) is that there are TOO MANY characters, yet in desperation one of the main producers Ken Olin appears as an important character.

I was FOOLED into buying the 2 seasons by the presence of Rachel Griffiths, but clearly she needs HBO scriptwriters to write for her! Her role in this is a waste of her acting talents.

Plot idea ! Rachel takes a holiday in Hawaii, at the same as the rest of the Walker family are mortally infected by a rare vine pest at their vineyard and Ojai foods!

Peace at last in Pasadena....

3416211,1,B0018CWEVW,"I actually really enjoy this series, what I object to is the rampant, unashamed and in your face nepotism that pervades this show like a bad smell. It truly beggars belief that the producer/director cast his wife (attractive but now quite frankly too old for the part) as the glamorous `other woman' in the show, himself (fat with overly long greasy hair and grey stubble) as her new romantic interest and his son as one of the writers! How many talented actors and writers were sidelined so that Mr Olin Senior could cast Mrs Olin in one of the key roles and give Mr Olin Junior a key position on the writing staff? It seems that actors would have us believe that acting is a difficult 'art' or 'skill' for which they deserve to be paid vast sums and to receive awards for their 'brilliant' and 'outstanding' performances (so they tell us).  We are then expected to also believe that this 'dazzling talent' is miraculously inherited by their offspring who, in turn, apparently deserve to be paid vast sums and to receive awards for their 'brilliant' and 'outstanding' performances... and the cycle continues. The whole thing is starting to resemble some extraordinary scam with us cast as the gullible marks! So, Mr Olin, get rid of yourself (as the love interest), your wife and your son and bring on board some genuine talent that actually deserves to be there!",1238716800,,1364,4.707112970711297

3416215,5,B0018CWEVW,"It seems that these days most family dramas revolve around teenagers; so it's a real pleasure to see one where all the kids are grown up, some with families of their own.

This show is superb.  The right mix of drama and comedy; and exceptional performances by all the actors.

You get hooked so easily into this show because it is very well written, and performed; and because you end up wanting to be a part of this family.  I always end up having a big smile on my face after watching this show, even if I have also shed a few tears in one sentimental moment, which are frequent but never corny.

Watching this show feels like being a fly on the wall, observing a real family and not a fictional one.

For those who cannot wait for Season 3, it is available on iTunes.  You can get a Season Pass.  There are 15 episodes available for downloading now, and additional ones will be added weekly one at a time, after it airs on TV.

Las actuaciones son muy buenas, y en un mismo captulo logran transmitir sensaciones variadas que provocan desde una risa a carcajadas hasta una lgrima llena de sentimiento.

3416281,5,B0018CWEVW,"The second season of Brothers & Sisters offers the same elements that were present in its first, only better. After this second season, I quickly realised that I'm completely in love with these characters and their storylines. Anyone who's close to their siblings will find many similarities in the plot of this show.

The show continues where the last season left off. Kitty is still with the Senator and he is still trying to take his seat at the head of his party. Sara's marriage is still in trouble. Justin is still at war and will become more troubled than before. Kevin is still looking for love and hiding his aloneness with cynicism. And Norah... well she's still the matriarch with so much goodness she causes more harm than good. The family business is in trouble, and many of their relationships as well.

These characters are going through real situations that I found myself indentifying with. There are many gripping moments in this series that just brings you closer to these characters because they often reflect our own. Sure, the show is about a rich Californian family that seems to have all that they want. But the characters are never overzealous, which makes them real.

What I find amazing about this show is the dialogue. When the entire family is together, the dance that takes place back and forth between these characters is so realistic that it sends shivers down my spine. The performances are all strong, even more in this second season. The actors are truly empersonating their characters and they seem much more at ease with one another.

Brothers & Sisters is a real gem. I wish more people would be able to watch and enjoy this show about family relationships and family secrets. I can garantee that after just a few episodes, you'll be completely hooked.",1223510400,,1790,4.783171521035599
3416282,3,B0018CWEVW,"Brothers & Sisters Season Two is listed as having a Run Time of ""1 minutes"" as I write this review; this is clearly wrong.  (The Season One DVD set is listed as having a Run Time of 988 minutes.)

Season One had 23 episodes.  Season Two had only 16 due to the writers' strike.  The Season One collection was on 6 discs.  Season Two is on 5 discs.  There's no advance information about what extras they added to the Season Two set, but logically you'd expect the price to be about 2/3 of that of Season One.  That's not the case.

I won't go into details about the Season Two plot lines involving the faux Walker sibling; others can cover that.  But based only on the amount of content versus the price of the set, I've got to say I'm disappointed.",1220659200,15,747,4.24113475177305
3416283,5,B0018CWEVW,"Broadway Diva Betty Buckley played the matriarch in the pilot and she was at her excellent best. Enter Sally Field. The series was supposedly based around star Calista Flockhart, but not surprisingly, Field stole the show and won an Emmy for both seasons. Her character is complex and natural. The plots are intricate, if at times, not confusing. There is too much busyness going on and at times, one loses sight of the story until two time Oscar winner Field steps in. The entire cast is quite good that includes Rob Lowe. I do not know if there is a season three, due to the writer's strike which hampered this show, but let's hope there is. Despite the over complex plotting, the acting makes up for any confusion the viewer may feel.

This is a solid show on the every shifting changes in traditional family values. That in itself is an important message and worthy of watching due to the erosion from globalization and technology.
