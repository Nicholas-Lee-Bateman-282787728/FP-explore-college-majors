7209387,5,B00YAZNBTI,"A must watch film, honest and harrowing, based on evidence and proven facts, very very interesting. The director, actor and contributors did a remarkably good job. 10 out of 10!",1434672000,13,177,4.933333333333334
7209388,5,B00YAZNBTI,"Even though Tom Grant, the Private Investigator that Courtney Love hired to find Kurt Cobain after he left a rehab facility in LA, has publicly stated for 21 years that Courtney was involved in a conspiracy to murder her husband, she has never pursued legal action against him. WHY? One word: Deposition!

This film is based on the FACTS surrounding the death of Kurt Cobain. I became extremely curious about his death after the Seattle Police Department began releasing photos of the crime scene on the 20 year anniversary of Cobain's death. I must say, once they published the derogatory wedding vow note, that had never been seen by the public before, I had to know WHY so many people believed that Kurt Cobain was murdered. Soaked In Bleach takes you through the events as they unfolded in the days leading up to the discovery of Kurt Cobain's body in the greenhouse above the garage of Kurt & Courtney's Lake Washington home.

This film is primarily documentary, with reenactments of key events. Director Benjamin Statler used the audio recordings of conversations between Tom Grant & Courtney Love, as well as conversations that Tom had recorded between himself & Kurt & Courtney's attorney Rosemary Carroll, and he perfectly dubbed the voices of Tom Grant, Courtney Love & Dylan Carlson over the actors' for a good portion of the reenactments, which were jaw dropping.

The documentary portion of the film contains interviews with those who knew Kurt prior to fame, as well as the testimony of several medical experts, a document examiner, and a homicide detective. There is a substantial amount of evidence to prove that Kurt Cobain was murdered, the most irrefutable being the fact that he had been injected with a 3X lethal dose of heroin (for the most severe addict), which would be a 75X lethal dose for a non-addict. Diazepam was also found in Kurt's system. Medical experts agree that it would have been impossible for Kurt Cobain to have shot himself because he would have been immediately incapacitated or dead. Yet his death was ruled a suicide in 54 minutes (according to the SPD reports, which are available online). There is absolutely no way that a cause of death can be determined without an autopsy & a toxicology report, but nonetheless, it was still labeled an open & shut case of suicide. Kurt Cobain's death investigation needs to be reopened by an authority, completely independent of the Seattle Police Department!",1434672000,117,2443,4.910411622276029
7209389,5,B00YAZNBTI,"I challenge the naysayers to watch this and then say it's merely a ""conspiracy theory.""The truth is it's likely a conspiracy was committed; being two or more people conspired or planned to commit a crime-homocide- in secret.

7209390,5,B00YAZNBTI,"The most alarming and damning of the film's evidence, for me, was the practice sheet allegedly found in Courtney Love's backpack by Rosemary Carol, Kurt and Courtney's attorney and Godmother to daughter, Frances Bean. The sheet contains various letter combinations virtually identical to Cobain's handwriting that, according to various forensic writing specialists in the film, could also be found in his suicide note, particularly the last four, most contended lines. If that doesn't make your jaw drop, nothing else will.",1434585600,121,523,5.55
7209391,5,B00YAZNBTI,"The glaring fact that he had 10x the normal dose of heroin in his system is the one fact all these skeptics are forgetting. Can't say I've ever done heroin myself. But, from what I hear from addiction expert Dr Gabor Mate, it doesn't seem like you would be suicidal after shooting up. Maybe before, or after coming down, but not during. Of course it was possible that he was suicidal. But, given what I know about how the world works, CL had a great motive to kill KC and seems statistically more plausible for her to have killed him for those very reasons. Women kill their husbands or destroy them in divorce court all the time so they can get access to their wealth so they never have to work again. This is what our system produces.

So, let us say that even if KC offed himself, you can't deny that other women kill their husbands for the very same suspected motives. My point here is that it is a systemic social issue. Not just personal. Murdering people is profitable, especially if you can afford good lawyers. They could reopen the case and maybe find her guilty. But it won't address the root of the problem. Husbands will still get murdered for their wealth. Or social system overwhelmingly favors women. Watch The Red Pill.",1501027200,5,1236,4.493333333333333

7209396,5,B00YAZNBTI,"This documentary outlines the suspicious activities and behaviors of the people ""closest"" to Kurt Cobain on and around the date of his supposed suicide.  It is narrated primarily by the private detective that was hired by Courtney Love prior to Kurt's death, who found a number of issues surrounding his death that were very disturbing.  He taped every single conversation/interview he ever conducted with anyone during his investigation.  There are also interviews with leading pathologists and other experts that are very compelling in their opinions as to how Kurt's suicide may not have been a suicide after all.  It is very organically suspenseful.",1494892800,,653,5.310679611650485

7209398,1,B00YAZNBTI,"tl;dr this documentary is a farce of Michael-Moorian proportions, as is the Courtney murder conspiracy. Get Montage of Heck instead, which presents both Kurt and Courtney as human, and often unflatteringky so, but not as an angel God icon and his harpy from hell. And totally get the Home Recordings album that accompanies it.

I have so many problems with this, from Tom Grant's unilateral dismissal of any evidence that contradicts his theory, to the witless caricature of Courtney Love, which was written more inline with the static idea of Courtney that conspiracy theorists already have than with any real human, ever.

Tom Grant presented his theory to another documentarian in 1998; well-respected BBC filmmaker Nick Broomfield followed up on leads and evidence provided by Grant in Kurt & Courtney, including discussing with a medical professional the claim that Kurt had ""too much heroin in his system to fire a gun."" He ultimately concluded against the conspiracy theorists, which seems to be frequently overlooked in reviews and critiques of the film. He presents witnesses who support the conspiracy theory, then points out how poor they are as witnesses to their faces, then literally says, ""I no longer believe the conspiracy theories.""

No one in Soaked in Bleach knew Kurt Cobain well. All these people insisting he ""wasn't depressed"" knew him tangentially at best. Lest we forget the glaring irony of a guy who never met Kurt, and who has access to zero first hand resources,  insisting repeatedly that he wasn't depressed. Of course, most who knew him closely believe he was (even Dylan Carlson, who appeared in Kurt & Courtney fervently denying that Kurt was depressed or suicidal -- as one would be likely to do if he bought the shotgun his best friend used to kill himself days after participating in an intervention with that friend -- now sober, expresses regret for his earlier interviews, and says that fame destroyed Kurt. He was notably absent from Soaked in Bleach).

There are so many alternatives that don't just exploit and commodify Kurt as a dead icon.",1492128000,,2085,5.014450867052023
7209399,3,B00YAZNBTI,"This was somewhat interesting, but I believe that Courtney Love and friends were so high all the time that none of them could really recall what was happening from one day to the next, or what they said or did.  Why did Grant take them so seriously?  I don't believe that they were scheming or conspiring to commit murder.  I don't even think they were smart enough to organize such a feat!",1491868800,,390,4.388888888888889
7209400,1,B00YAZNBTI,"He takes insignificant details and dramatically disproves them with emphasis, in order to guide people toward his theory of a poor investigation...typical of most conspiracy-theorists. For example the chair, was it wedged against the door or simply near the door? It wasn't involved in the suicide so what difference does it make!!! Shell casings, I was in the infantry for 13 years and fired 100,000-500,000 rounds during my Army career...casings go everywhere. Kurt was wearing long sleeves, his cuff could have deflected the shell to the opposite side. The suicide, I honestly would pump myself with a lethal dose of heroin ""in case"" I didn't die from the gunshot, immediately (especially for a gun that I had purchased ""used"" and never previously fired). The practice page with the letters...It was in possession of the attorney, maybe she wrote it. When she found out he was recording her, she immediately ceased all communications with the PI and threatened to sue him if he used anything she said. Maybe she killed Kurt and was trying to frame Courtney. The sealed note, Courtney said it was under the pillow, the PI said he checked and it wasn't there! Look, she's a crackhead and may have been confused. Doesn't prove a single thing. In conclusion, Courtney Love can't even spell simple words correctly (if you read the missing person's report)....She was stoned every single time the PI met with her...Yet, she concocted a brilliant plan to kill him on the fly while his whereabouts at that point, were still unknown and while a PI and the police were both looking for him? She's an undercover mastermind then, posing as a complete fool for the past 30 years.",1488844800,6,1669,4.901060070671378
7209401,3,B00YAZNBTI,"I gave this three stars because it wasn't bad, and Tom Grant presents his point of view in a rational clear matter, but I feel the poor guy got sucked into the Courtney Love crazy tornado and allowed that to taint his judgement. In other words, fans of Nirvana know how Love acts and talks. She's straight up nutty. She more than likely has severe mental illness coupled with years of mind altering drug use. She rambles, free associates, exaggerates, talks fast changing subjects, says one things & then says the exact opposite a few seconds later. Just listen to her old interviews.
Tom Grant walked in and met her the first time and was greatly influenced by her weird actions and talk. When we as fans of Kurt understand this is not a woman to take seriously at all.
Also, there was no real forensic evidence of a murder, or witnesses. A lot of speculation based around Love's inconsistent ramblings.",1488585600,,904,4.62111801242236
7209402,5,B00YAZNBTI,Very sad. This case needs to be re-investigated. He was definitely murdered. Too many variables that rule OUT suicide.,1488499200,2,118,5.2631578947368425

7209404,5,B00YAZNBTI,"Great to see some follow up to the conspiracy laced death of the genius Kurt Cobain. I never felt comfortable with the immediate result- case closed/suicide. Although a fan of Hole, never trusted Courtney, or any of her motives. This film does a great job of reminding us that there was more than meets the eye. Not an exploitation film by any means, but a sincere revisit to the event. Filled with new facts and footage to solidify the curiosity. It leaves the viewer to determine their own thoughts. Although pretty obvious. The fact that Detective Tom recorded all conversations (albeit edited for drama most likely) regardless, one can only wonder. Some of the ""recreation"" scenes are a bit cheesy, tolerable nonetheless. They appear heartfelt and realistic to what many of us believe to be the circumstance overall. Regardless, the world lost an important human being who represented a huge portion of society. Kurt was just like anyone else. He made a difference in my life, still does. He was struck by lightening and shared it with everyone. Ashamed of his fame, but he exuded confidence and hope behind his words and music. Rest in Peace Kurt.

7209412,4,B00YAZNBTI,"It was an interesting ""documentary"" But I am always a little skeptical with the use of strategically placed sound bites. I hope in my heart he was not murdered. It would be nice if an independent law enforcement agency would look into the situation and finally put it to rest. This has to be very taxing on his family to always live under a veil of suspension.

7209413,1,B00YAZNBTI,"I think that the private investigator in this mockumentary is trying to create a conspiracy to make money. There are better things for a police department to focus their time and money on than reopening the Kurt Cobain case. Nothing will bring him back. So they just need to move on.

I expected to learn more about Kurt Cobain, maybe his childhood, family, his philosophies, or how he became the lead singer of Nirvana. This movie does none of that. Just creates a conspiracy theory.",1482969600,,484,4.694117647058824

Obviously, this is one viewer's opinion, not gospel, and no, I wasn't there.  But I don't think Love's reputation is what it is for no reason.

Like Halperin and Wallace's convincing argument much like former Love investigator Tom Grant that Cobain's death was not quite so shut and dry as it appeared, there is now even more fuel to add fire of in reality: the perfect murder, and some of them truly do make that fire scorching. We even have real recordings out of ever the opportunist for attention Ms. Love's lovely mouth to go with more facts that point to something very sinister in how Kurt came upon his death. Some will say conspiracy, here we go again, but there is more here than in most conspiracy cases in my view.

The fact that he could not have been conscious or even alive  after a massive dose of heroin, much less shoot himself should be all the evidence needed to reopen the case. Who did it and why is also obvious but proving that this many years later would probably be impossible. What was most obvious to me is that Courtney comes across as not just a drug user but a drug dealer, something far too many inner city kids spend decades in jail for. The elite are obviously protected..and not just by good lawyers.

Experts present us with scientific evidence on why Kurt could not have committed suicide. The film does try to paint Kurt as being a lot more happier than he really seemed to be at times, but did an excellent job at showing us where Tom Grant came up with his belief on the matter of Kurt's death. I am also a fan of Daniel Roebuck, having watched him in Matlock when it was on the air, I was happy to see that he was in the film. Our minds were completely changed when we saw this film, just like so many others. I think that the role of Dylan Carlson could have been cast a little better, but the actress who played Courtney Love did an exceptional job and looks so much like Courtney when she was young.

Just who are these experts?! The story makes perfect sense BeSiDeS the HEROIN FACTOR. 60 MG may be an average dose for a low level to mediocre addict. Just over 200 MG of Heroin for a CHRONIC user (the good stuff) is closer to a mediocre dosage. Another thing that these completely clueless or lying experts left out is that just ONE 10 mg pill of  Valium can and likely will stay in your system for nearly a month. Just F%@king Bollucks!!! Kurt was just high, so what? He was an addict. Go check out stats on heroin dosages and the half-life of Valium!!! I believe his suicide and the scene of the crime was staged. However, this filmmaker and Nick Brookfield (Kurt and Courtney documentarian) are both using false information about the lethal dosages of heroin dosages and the Valium half-life either ignorantly from ignorant so-called experts or they know it is BS but are just selling it to you so to have as many as possible to buy into their theories. I believe the PI and I love Broomfield and all his documentaries. This is just ONE fault in their theories. I'll buy all the stories and evidence they present besides the drug story. Everything still makes sense even though this drug story is so wrong my blood is boiling! I am happy that Seattle is now investigating this now, and hopefully very seriously! I cannot stand Courtney. I hope justice is served to anyone involved in this tragedy. Don't believe everything you hear. The fact they are selling that these drugs completely incapacitated Kurt is total BS!!!!!!!! Try to do some research of your own instead of believing everyone or everything you see in a film , broadcast, and so forth.

I know this because Tyler knows this...

Seriously, research lethal heroin dosages and Valium half-life. Go to medical sources, go to YouTube, go to the darkest forums online where junkies chat about dosages, you will see that these drug allegations are so far from truth.",1464220800,2,1948,4.687134502923977

7209543,3,B00YAZNBTI,"My only problem with this film is that it doesn't want to be a straight documentary.  Consequently, some of the more convincing facts don't receive the emphasis they deserve.  The greatest parts of this film are the use of the actual telephone recordings with Courtney and she and Kurt's attorney.  The use of Tom Grant in his own words was important and necessary.  I feel they did not go heavy enough on the recordings or Grant.  I read ""Love and Death"" several times and am very familiar with Tom Grant's notes and work product on the case, so the film was another dimension to all of that information.  However, had I not been as familiar I am not sure this film would have led me to a conclusion one way or another.  Overall, a great supplement to the information already out there.",1461542400,,787,4.5
7209544,5,B00YAZNBTI,This definitely raises a few questions that need to be answered. Great film. I have a lot of respect for Mr. Grant and his work.,1461283200,,128,4.16
7209545,3,B00YAZNBTI,"I think this is a well-intentioned biography, but not ultimately persuasive. Major developments in post-mortum toxicology have occurred since 1994. We now know that the concentration of a drug found in the blood of a deceased person might not be a very reliable indicator of the amount of the drug he or she took just before death. Upon death, the body can release a great deal of drug that had been stored in the tissues. (In one reported case, a post-mortum toxicology result indicated that the subject had recently ingested sixty bottles of Aspirin - an amount that would have been impossible to consume.)

The results of post-mortum blood tests are particularly unreliable when the blood is drawn from the heart. This was not known, or at least not widly known, in 1994, and it is very likely Cobain's blood concentration of heroin was tested from heart blood.

We can't know how much heroin Cobain consumed (or was given) just before his death. The idea that Cobain received an amount that would have killed him is inconsistent with the physical evidence and with Tom Grant's theory of what happened at the time Cobain was shot. Cobain (at least according to Grant, and the animation of the shooting in the movie) died when he was shot, not before. A huge and lethal dose of heroin would likely have killed Cobain before a murderer had time to put him in position on the floor, arrange a shotgun backwards in his hands, and fire.

Anyone who has ever fired a gun knows that you can't predict exactly where a shell casing will end up afterwards. And the assertion that Cobain and Love were ""going through a divorce"" seems a bit stretched. That they were angry and fighting a lot, and that he threatened divorce - or even outright told her that he wanted one - is not the same thing as ""going through a divorce."" Many couples do and say these things but don't file for divorce. That he called his lawyer and asked if Courtney could be taken out of his will might indicate that he wanted a divorce, but it also might indicate that he was considering killing himself. What twenty seven year old thinks very hard about his will? At that age, if you think cutting your spouse out of your will has much significance, you're probably flirting with suicide. For most twenty seven year olds, it's much quicker to get a divorce than wait to die of natural causes.

That Courtney initially told the press Kurt's overdose in Rome wasn't a suicide attempt but later changed her story means nothing. There is little doubt she'd have lied to the press to protect his career after the incident. If the public knew that he was self-destructive, it could have affected others' willingness to work with him and book him for engagements. But anyone who ends up in a coma from a combination of alcohol and drugs is obviously at least a little self-destructive, in my opinion. At best, it is myopic to think you can ""debunk"" the suggestion that this was a suicide attempt. It's not that simple.

The movie makes a big deal of what a solid, ""stand-up guy"" Tom Grant is. How he resigned from the police force with distinction, and lacks the checkered past of most P.I.s. I believe all this is probably true--and I believe that this is precisely Grant's problem. At heart, he's still a cop. Cops want nothing more than to get the bad guy. It would be easy for a ""stand-up guy"" like him to immediately sense a bad guy when he met Love--and the movie suggests that's exactly what happened. In all, I didn't see one piece of evidence that came anywhere near to convincing me that Love was involved in her husband's death. The implications we draw from evidence depend on the mindset we view it with, and I don't think I watched this film with any particular mindset. I've never thought much of Love or her music, and I like a good conspiracy as much as anyone.",1461110400,2,3836,4.577874818049491

7209633,4,B00YAZNBTI,"I think its important to know that the P.I .(who worked as a dectective for the LA County Sheriffs Department) only wants the case to be reinvestigated because it wasn't handled properly. I think its also important to keep in mind that this documentary isn't made by top filmmakers in the industry and its made on a little budget. The purpose of the film is to get some points of information about his investigation out there so the public can go to cobaincase dot com for the full outline of his investigation and make an informed decision for themselves as to what they believe.

I, personally, haven't listened to Nirvana since I was a teenager in the 90s and believed for 17 years that only emotional fans wouldn't believe the offiicial suicide ruling until I came across by chance and read the outline of the case and also listened to the recordings of Rosemary Carroll (Kurt & Courtney's attorney) stating they were in the process of getting a divorce.

I gave it 4 stars for the pertinent and critical information it contains not the filmmaking. Yes, the film is poorly made but some people are more interested in the wealth of information that a documentary provides and are not concerned with if its low-budget. I watch documentaries for that reason myself not for the fabulous effects and acting!

As an aside, I find this statement made by Courtney Love's first husband very informative.

 ""When we were married, she certainly seemed to know a lot about hit men. If somebody pissed her off a lot, she would pay this guy she knew fifty or a hundred dollars to beat them up. It was pretty scary. From my own experience, shes dangerous. She definitely has an evil side. She once tried to burn my bed when i was sleeping. A fire started and i woke up in shock. Its impossible to figure out Courtneys motives. Her disdain was powerful, and she came off as a spoiled little snot. Courtney is a violent person who, even in the midst of our anonymous, crummy, poverty-stricken little marriage, threatened to have me beaten up for two hundred dollars when I didn't do what she wanted. I was so scared of her i caved in immediately. In those days, she was just this junkie stripper and prostitute, but give somebody like that a couple million and you cant overestimate how dangerous they might be.""

It is important, for so many reasons, that this investigation should be held up as an example of how NOT to conduct an investigation into the death of a person who has been reported suicidal and/or may be mentally ill - many people are demanding justice for Kurt, but the fact is that there are probably dozens, maybe hundreds of people whose deaths were ruled ""suicide"" despite the evidence never having been processed.

7209636,5,B00YAZNBTI,"Fast-paced, fascinating and deeply disturbing. Soaked in Bleach reenacts the last few months of Kobain's life, exploring his relationship with Courtney Love, his medical problems, and state of mind, using letters, interviews, and the records of a private detective hired by Courtney Love.

Before renting this documentary, I firmly believed Kurt Kobain committed suicide. Now...I really don't know what to think. Was Kurt Kobain murdered? If he was murdered, who was responsible? We may never know, and the cops who ""investigated"" the case don't appear to care. I'm embarrassed by the practically non-existent investigation carried out by police officers in my state. I don't want to give too much away, but you know it's bad when the former police chief openly admits that his office failed to properly investigate what he now admits was, at best, a suspicious death.

The film presents a compelling case for reopening the investigation into Kobain's death. While it does occasionally delve into what might be deemed conspiracy theories about Courtney Love, it also puts forward some very practical questions concerning physical evidence, and puts to rest many of the myths surrounding Kurt Kobain's final months.

It paints a very serious accusation of a theory that she and a couple of other people hatched a plan to kill her famous husband, I'm not here to pass judgment on Love herself and whether i think I she is guilty or innocent of these accusations. This is what I will say- The private eye who was hired by love makes a very compelling argument in making his case.
The movie goes into great detail about the events that led to Kurt's death. From conversations to with Love herself or The final days of how Kurt lived. It has a pretty historical account of how the police conducted themselves during the investigation- especially interesting is how they let Love have her husbands remains be cremated so soon after his death and allowing the crime scene to be demolished not long afterward
There are no extras on the DVD not even a director's commentary  If you have Hulu or Netflix you can catch the movie there However die hard Cobain fans will probably get the DVD at any rate because they would find this movie worthy of adding to the Nirvana Library they have",1456099200,,1159,4.41588785046729

7209674,1,B00YAZNBTI,"I did research on Kurt Cobain's death for my High School senior project.  I read all the books, saw a bunch of home video, heard all the music, and saw all of the movies.  It's obvious who did it: the pizza delivery guy.  It sounds like I'm joking, but I'm entirely positive on this.  The case would've been solved in about 10 seconds, too; but the delivery guy's father (oh, this is important: his father is the chief of police), anyway, his dad arrived first; disallowed any cops from questioning the son, citing previous head trauma; and didn't have anyone check for any clues what-so-ever.

This is so important because when the facts came out that Kurt was actually much happier now, and had many long-term plans/goals, suicide made less and less sense.  So, and i'm guessing here (See? I admitted it), the officer needed another scapegoat to pin the death on.  So before his son became a target, he Googled the closest one to Kurt.  He found Courtney, found that they had some drug problems and scuffles, and focused everybody's attention on her.

I don't know Courtney Love; never met her.  However, everybody makes fun of her now because she's fallen apart.  Now that Frances is older, she's getting a little shaky, too.

7209696,5,B00YAZNBTI,"Thank you Tom Grant for not backing down and continuing to pursue the truth, even when you are met with so much negativity. Millions of people, myself included, believe as you do...that Kurt Cobain's death happened as a direct result of two or more people conspiring to commit murder and then go to great lengths to make it look like a suicide. If all of these facts were presented to a law enforcement agency as a case for a John Doe, they would have this case reopened in a second. It's sad that due to Kurt Cobain's fame, and the media coverage of his so called ""suicide"" and what supposedly led up to it, that no one seems to want to take a serious look at all of the factual evidence that Mr. Grant has. Courtney Love, in her own words in recorded telephone conversations, admits that she manipulates the media and her (and Kurts) fans to get what she wants. She straight up admits to planting stories in the media to gain whatever publicity she desires at the time, and paying others to do so as well on many occasions.

This documentary is not just Mr. Grant discussing his opinion of what may have happened to Kurt. You will hear MANY recorded conversations with Courtney Love, Rosemary Carroll (family friend & attorney for the Cobain's), and others close to the family that contradict what has been said to have taken place in the week leading up to Kurt's body being found. Mr. Grant doesnt claim to have all of the answers about what happened, he simply would like to see this case reopened and examined thoroughly by unbiased eyes, as well as have the autopsy report be made public. There are too many missing pieces in this puzzle, and the pieces that ARE there definitely don't show a clear cut suicide. Quite the contrary, actually.  This case will never have closure until the people that have those missing pieces, or information that could lead to them, finally come forward. If they aren't willing to do so, then one can only assume that they have something to hide.

I pray that one day this case will be properly investigated and the truth will prevail. Above anything else, Kurts daughter deserves to know what really happened to her father.",1454112000,8,2164,4.572164948453608

7209722,4,B00YAZNBTI,"I'm not a fan of Nirvana, Kurt Cobain or Courtney Love. But I'm an avid fan of good mysteries. After watching this documentary I did a little snooping around the net for more information (since I had no idea who Kurt Cobain was) and found that this did qualify as a good murder mystery. There's a lot of ""crap"" out there in la la land so it's hard to know who to believe or even what to read.

This documentary is an interesting point of view from an investigator who was actually there. It seems to be pretty factual compared to what information is available but it still leaves so many unanswered questions.
Obviously the documentary is slanted in favor of Cobain being murdered but it's not an extreme slant. It will make you think that murder was a distinct possibility but it doesn't contain the evidence to convince.

It's hard to come to a conclusion when you're dealing with heroin junkies whose lives are continually teetering on the edge of epic failure and you've got to question if they even know the truth or are just trying to function with heroin saturated brains.

For those of you who question the heroin tolerance theory I would ask... why do heroin addicts overdose by the thousands every year? If you can build a tolerance able to withstand 3 or more times a lethal dose you would think it would be pretty hard to overdose a daily user. Not true. Happens every single day all around the world. How much was too much for Cobain? Don't know. Could he still function after that dose? Don't know.

Courtney Love had means, motive and opportunity. There was a lot of questionable behaviors and deceit when it came to her part in this story. Her cash cow was bugging out and taking the farm with him. You always have to ask... why the deceit and the controlling manipulation if you have nothing to hide?

The only conclusion I can reach is that the Seattle Police Dept were completely inept and Cobain died under suspicious circumstances.
Unless Tom Grant has more evidence than presented in this documentary, it would do no good to re-open the case.

It's an interesting documentary - worth a watch. But sadly I can only conclude that Cobain's death will remain a mystery.",1452124800,2,2187,4.580562659846548

However, no evidence of this is presented. Tom Grant has no place critiquing the police investigation and conclusion. He went looking for Kurt at his estate and didn't even notice the room above the garage. He claims he couldn't see it because it was dark. A P.I. who doesn't bring a flashlight to a night-time search? No headlights on their vehicles? I just don't believe that he could only see 8' up and then total blackness.

The takeaways are Tom doesn't like Courtney. Kurt was mentally ill, reclusive and a heroin addict who made a career out of public scream therapy and writing about guns and drugs and psychosis; and then,...he killed himself. This video would make a decent 40 minute Dateline NBC, but at an hour and a half, it just feels too long.

Also, he is basically accusing Frances' mother of killing her father. Super irresponsible and wrong. Kurt loved Courtney and would have called this what it is. ""Bulls***!""",1451779200,2,1068,4.705882352941177

7209726,5,B00YAZNBTI,"I rarely review videos; but I thought this was a well done documentary giving you one side of the story in the whole Kurt Cobain death fiasco. As with all documentaries, I tend to watch them with one eye open since I know there are always multiple sides to every story as well as different interpretation of the facts.

The movie's focus on the handling of the situation by the Police rather than the details that lead up to the death are what I consider its best parts. Conspiracy theories or not, the protocol in which the ""crime"" scene was handled and the events following thereafter were way out of line and that's what I really took away from Soaked in Bleach. What you feel about the people involved can be more of a personal thing; but the negligence of law enforcement in the movie is the real eye opener and what resonated with me to the end.

7209737,5,B00YAZNBTI,"Great doc! Even if your not a Kurt Cobain or Nirvana fan but, your a fan of  forensic details and police investigations this is a good watch.  Tom Grant had the instinct to tape record and document every interaction he had with anyone involved in this case. These recordings provide detail and really raises a lot of questions regarding the death of Kurt Cobain.
At first, it is a hard sell that Courtney could be the mastermind behind her husband's death.  After all, she was a junkie at the time of his death and seemed really out of her mind.  As the documentary continues, it shows what steps she had taken to find Kurt (allegedly)  and to be quite frank, the steps she took were pretty ingenious.  Filing the missing person's report under HIS mother's name, Having their friend Dylan be the go between herself and Tom Grant etc. So maybe there is some truth in that old saying:  ""There is a fine line between insanity and genius.""

I remember Kurt's death vividly.  Of course this was a huge story back in 1994.  The media played it out the reason Kurt killed himself was he felt he was becoming a sell-out.  The corporate machines, corporate greed was taking over what he loved.  To many of us, this reason seemed logical.  Now I have to come to rethink that his death wasn't a tragic suicide but the work of a killer.

Let's get this case re-opened!  For justice sake!",1449964800,4,1375,4.487903225806452
7209738,5,B00YAZNBTI,"I think this documentary  shows good facts about Kurt Cobain's death investigation. I have also seen Montage of Heck and Soaked in Bleach is the complete opposite side of the story. Both are worth it. My views about Kurt's death changed completely after seeing this. I still don't think Courtney Love did it. Grant could have interpreted Courtney's behavior his own way and make her seem like she's the villain. I am not team Courtney, but I don't think she was that smart or that she got too lucky and got away with murder. Like I said, this only raises more questions, but there's definitely something funky involving Kurt's death and hopefully, if they reopen the case, the truth will come out. Gosh! just the thought that somebody could have killed him makes me nauseous. He was very talented and a good guy. He was just a bit crazy, but aren't we all?",1449878400,3,856,4.594771241830065

Though I wonder, is the SPD really that incompetent or were they paid to be that incompetent?  Kurt's daughter and loved ones deserve the truth, regardless of what it is.  People often question why Frances and/or the other Nirvana members have so easily bought into the suicide ruling.  But I wonder if they were scared into buying into and are still too scared to speak up.  I think they owe it to Kurt and Frances to speak up, if they truly believe that he was murdered, and can in any way help the truth to come out.  But I understand that they also have family and loved ones safety to think about.  None of know for sure why they have remained so quiet about the murky circumstances surrounding their good friend.

7209742,5,B00YAZNBTI,"As a teenager in the 90s, you couldn't get away from Kurt Cobain and Nirvana if you wanted to. Whether you loved, hated or barely tolerated their music, they were such an integral part of our teenage angst that, more than two decades after his untimely death, just the opening chords of Smells Like Teen Spirit transport me back in time, instantly.

I personally wasn't a huge fan of grunge or Nirvana in particular, but everyone I knew had their CDs, t-shirts and then some. There was no party that didn't feature Nirvana's haunting and sometimes angry music. And while their music made no particular impact on me as far as featuring in my playlist, the memories associated with those years do.

I found this documentary drama absolutely exceptional. It offers an admittedly biased view from the perspective of the private investigator hired by Courtney Love in the supposed disappearance of Kurt Cobain days before his dead body was discovered - an event that registered on all our minds back in 1994, regardless of whether we were ardent fans or not. What makes this documentary stand out to me is that it successfully blends actual tape recordings with a film version of the events - something that doesn't always translate well.

Riveted by the narrative and testimony, I personally came away absolutely shocked not only by what clearly seems like a concerted effort to portray Cobain as suicidal to set the scene for what one can only assume to be his premeditated, calculated murder. When you couple that with the unmistakable evidence of ineptitude on the part of the Seattle Police Department, you cannot help but feel that his death should, indeed, be re-investigated. You cannot help but be moved and feel some sort of anger, even, by this documentary film - even for someone like myself who, admittedly, was never a huge fan of Nirvana's music. Much like most people did at the time, I too was shocked by his death but accepted the ruling of suicide - a premature conclusion which is unmistakably called into question by this film.

By the time the credits rolled, I felt...aghast, shaken and perturbed. The idea that willful ignorance, corruption and cold-hearted greed may have been the real reason why Cobain was dead at only 27 cannot possibly leave anyone who was affected by his music indifferent. Even as someone who was never a fan but who lived in the world where Nirvana's music was as ubiquitous as a still-awesome MTV channel and pictures of Cindy Crawford, I find myself angry that the investigation into his death was not given the due diligence it deserved.",1449187200,6,2584,4.826185101580135

Repeated throughout, the viewer is reminded that the amount of heroin was so great, that he would have died quickly from the drug on its own, and been incapable - not to mention unmotivated - to engage a firearm, seeing that imminent death was already assured. Therefore, he was murdered. Or possibly murdered.

This is pretzel logic. If someone indeed wanted Kurt Cobain killed, surely giving him a lethal dose of heroin would have done the trick, no? Why then fiddle around with a shotgun, stage the scene in such a way as to satisfy the police and medical examiner, not to mention take the risk of being caught? After all, the sound of a gun shot often alerts the authorities. You can't take a supposition and have it only apply to one scenario. The lack of critical thinking regarding this particular aspect is bewildering. Toward the end, the investigator says, ""If you want to get away with murder, kill a junkie."" He also contends that staging a scene to make a murder appear to be suicide is easy if the victim is drug-addicted with a history of suicidal ideation. (but even that, he disputes. Apparently Cobain was a happy guy...not buying it...) But again, why the gun? It's ridiculous. Also, the suggestion that a daily heroin user cannot survive a textbook idea of ""lethal dose"" is unscientific.

The maker of this flimsy film admits that he's never seen the medical examiner's report or the police photographs. He never set foot in the part of the house where Cobain was found dead. His conclusions are therefore dubious. Lastly, the re-enactments with the actor portraying Courtney Love are cringe-worthy. The entire DVD is ridiculous - glad I took it out of the library.",1446940800,12,2235,4.815104166666667

I have seen, with my own eyes, a murder being discounted because the report had already been written. I know that there is favoritism given to some when investigation crimes. I know that suicides are always investigated as possible foul play and not just slapped on as a suicide as soon as the body is found. There are many many points this movie does not touch that are available in Mr Grants writings. This is a great movie, and hopefully with all the press it has gotten this case will be reopened.

Raises some pointed questions, though unsurprisingly this documentary lacks the evidence to convict.  My takeaway: murder is a possibility, not a certainty.  Seattle PD investigators are presented as imprecise at best -- incompetent at worst.  Courtney Love comes across as narcissistic, particularly in light of some of the more damning voice recordings.

The documentary has some gaps.  Anecdotes and opinions are offered as fact and/or causal in ways that I doubt they were.  Irrespective of suicide or murder, Kurt's death was a tragedy.",1444867200,3,579,5.511363636363637

7209980,4,B00YAZNBTI,"This film is focused on the death of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain as seen through the eyes of Tom Grant, a private investigator hired to find Kurt just days before his body was found.  The central focus is the protocol-defying ""investigation"" which resulted in a very premature ruling of suicide as official cause of death.  The film is a visual representation of all information Tom has gathered from his interaction with Courtney and other key figures in Kurt's life, using reenactments interlaced with actual recorded audio from his conversations.  It serves to inform those who never challenged the media's reporting of his death by presenting detailed information that was overlooked, along with many behaviors that make suicide entirely implausible as the cause of his untimely death.  Watch the movie and decide for yourself if you still believe that what you've ""known"" about his death for the past 21 years is really the truth.

*Note: I would have given 5 stars but as someone who's thoroughly reviewed the facts of the case, I feel there are some very compelling facts that were left out, most likely in order to keep a respectable running time.

7209985,5,B00YAZNBTI,"Even if you are a tepid fan of Kurt Cobain and Nirvana, you owe it to yourself to set aside an hour and a half of your time to watch this extremely compelling docudrama. I see many other reviewers claiming that most of the content in this movie is and has been public knowledge for some time and I am sure that must be true; but for those of us who are not super hard core Nirvana fans and have not had the privilege or interest in researching said info, this docudrama will be a serious wake up call.  Based on the fairly clear cut, well documented evidence presented in this film, it would be quite a shame if the Seattle PD or DA and/or the Washington State Attorney General's Office did not , at the very least, take a second look at the so called ""suicide"" of Kurt Cobain. As the movie makes potently clear, an estate worth close to a billion dollars in future royalty revenues is certainly quite a motive to commit murder(especially since the current inheritor of that estate - Courtney Love - was a stone's throw away from being served divorce papers and cut out of Cobain's will; a fact I certainly was not aware of at the time).
 This docudrama very skillfully and entertainingly walks the viewer through the timeline of the final week before Cobain's alleged suicide and the crucial time-frame directly after as seen by the the private detective hired by Courtney Love shortly before the event.  It becomes quickly obvious that Ms. Love chose the wrong detective to use as a unwitting accomplice to the ""suicidal Kurt"" narrative she painstakingly attempted to create in the media. Immediately sniffing out the glaring inconsistencies in his ""assignment"" and refusing to be the ""unwitting accomplice"" in the narrative, Tom Grant(the private detective) starts his own investigation into the situation; meticulously tape recording and documenting everything he said, heard, did and witnessed. This film is a culmination of all the evidence he uncovered along with the actual available ""suicide"" scene evidence(much of which is still being repressed by the Seattle PD - for God knows what reason). All of which has been independently verified by experts in several fields of forensics. This cornucopia of information and analysis appears to lead to only one logical conclusion.  The Seattle Police Department and Courtney Love's camp still insist that Cobain's death is a simple suicide, but the movie challenges the audience to come to their own conclusion - Suicide or Homicide.....You Decide!!!",1444435200,4,2503,4.89622641509434

You cannot tell me after looking at the absolute facts of this whole case that Love is innocent.  She may not have pulled the trigger but I would damn near guarantee you she paid for it...

I've never combed through Grant's site nor had the masochistic urge to endure listening to Love's recorded conversations, yet somehow have long known the documented facts presented on this film. Even so, I found the screening very well crafted and engaging. As suspicious and damning as Courtney's own words and actions, along with those of the attorney that represented K&C's personal and entertainment interests, were, the superb casting of Kurt's close friends and testimonies of ""expert witnesses"" (including SPD's former Chief of Police) added significant notes of credibility. [One aspect not given due attention was the use of Kurt's credit after his established time of death]

Whether you are familiar with all of the questionable circumstances or not beforehand, I believe the majority of those that watched Soaked In Bleach are left with the sense that a comprehensive, independent investigation is quite necessary.",1443657600,,1125,5.471264367816092

I remember watching MTV, and learning that he had ""killed himself"" while taking a lot of heroin and then getting a gun and shot himself in the head. Teenage years are some very difficult years for any normal teenager experiencing life itself; to learn your music idol, kills himself was devastating for me, (68 kids all over the world committed suicide after he died because they thought that's what Kurt would do). Being so young and naive and I believed everything the guy said on MTV, about Kurt Cobain killing himself. It wasn't until this year I started doing my own research about his death and learned many details surrounding him before his death and learned more about him. Everything you need to know that Kurt Cobain did NOT KILL HIMSELF is in this movie. Tom Grant deserves an Oscar award for his 20+ years of dedication on Kurt Cobain's death investigation.

Most of the testimony offered is provided by private investigator Tom Grant who contributes damning tapes of telephone conversations he conducted with Cobain's widow, Hole singer Courtney Love among others.  The greatest service this film could provide is enough evidence to reopen the case in a manner that documentarian Errol Morris' ""The Thin Blue Line"" did a generation ago.

You do hear recorded conversations with the private investigator, Courtney Love & others involved. Even though you hear some of the conversations, if you've followed this case & the people involved, there will be no surprises in those recordings. Courtney Love is Courtney Love. A true fan of Nirvana and Kurt Cobain will not be surprised by anything recorded by the P.I. You have to give Courtney kudos for standing her ground all of these years. She didn't want to speak publicly about this back then & has maintained that all of these years. She is the mother of Kurt's daughter. Even if you don't agree with her position or silence she has been consistent about protecting her child in her own way. You do see photos from the crime scene which I didn't feel added much clarity to this suicide/murder mystery. I was left feeling like I didn't have any better understanding or clarification one way or another. I still feel the Seattle Police should reopen this case, but there wasn't really ""new"" evidence you haven't heard, read or watched elsewhere to compel police to reopen the case.

This absolutely felt like one more person trying to cash in on this tragic loss. I have never given ONE STAR on any review I've ever written. Ever. I wish I could give less than one star. Don't waste your money or time on someone else trying to make a dollar off of Kurt Cobain's death with nothing truly new to tell or share.

7210148,4,B00YAZNBTI,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

In 1994 the world was stunned to learn of the death of Kurt Cobain, one of the leading founders of the grunge rock movement. An apparent suicide his death affected tons of fans, some going so far as to follow in his footsteps and kill themselves by shotgun blast. But what if that wasn't the truth? What if Cobain didn't actually commit suicide?

Thats the premise for this documentary that combines interviews, taped recordings and re-enactments to offer up another scenario as to what might have happened. When the movie is over youll be scratching your head as to why no one has done more to investigate this death. Before thinking that they already investigated it once Id suggest you watch this movie.

The movie is based mostly on the investigation done by Tom Grant, a private investigator hired by Courtney Love, Cobains wife, prior to Cobains death. While she hired him to track down Cobain things seemed fishy from the start, enough so that Grant began taping the conversations, both live and on the phone, with Love. An ex-police officer, Grant had the feeling that things were not as they appeared.

To begin with, as depicted here, Love did not seem to be the distressed wife that one would expect if her husband was suddenly missing. Her responses to questions about locations he could have gone too seemed vague and certain spots she said he couldn't be at seemed odd to Grant. Her nonchalant attitude didn't sit well with Grant and while he was working for Love and other pieces of information she provided him didn't jibe with his investigation. That she sent a heroin addict to assist him in his investigation also made him wonder what was up.

On top of that there are questions that revolve around the way the case was handled by the police at the time. Clues at the crime scene were ignored as officers jumped to the conclusion that this was a suicide and nothing more. That there could have been a murder set up to look like a suicide never crossed the minds of the officers in charge of the investigation. Looking back the police chief at the time now thinks the case should be re-opened.

Forensic experts are brought in to discuss various items in the death of Cobain. Looking over the information gathered from the crime scene as well as reports filed at the time almost all think that this was not a suicide. But without all documentation provided to them a final conclusion cannot be offered. As each one appears to discuss what they have looked at the question of why these things were not discussed in 1994 keeps rearing its ugly head.

Movies can be manipulative, especially documentaries. When you begin with a theory you think you have the answer for you tend to twist the facts to suit your ends rather than following the facts to find the end. There is that possibility with this film. But as I watched I became more and more convinced that there was something being hidden about the real death of Kurt Cobain. Perhaps it was a murder and he didn't commit suicide. If so, who killed Cobain? But there is the possibility that he died of a heroin overdose. If so then the suicide was staged but for what reason? With the millions in royalties on the line for his heirs there was motive for any and all possibilities. That he was talking about divorcing Love also comes into play.

The odds of us ever discovering the truth are very slim by this time. Without access to the physical evidence at the time it makes discovery less likely to happen. Innuendo and supposition can only get you so far. And here, over 20 years since Cobain died, what we are left with are more questions than answers. If you're a fan of Nirvana and Cobain then youll want to see this movie. If you enjoy documentaries youll want to give it a watch. And if you love a mystery then youll definitely want to watch. While the truth may never be known the discussions as to what really happened will never end.",1440547200,4,3969,4.564606741573034

7210156,3,B00YAZNBTI,"Now I'm convinced.  Suicide.  The timeline did it for me.  It seemed pretty clear he flew down to LA mainly to say goodbye to his daughter.  Even though he was at a clinic, I think he knew he was a junkie for life and wanted to spare bringing his child down with him.  At the end of the day, I also feel that Cobain knew what his fans didn't.  That he wasn't much of a talent.  For someone like him, that had the piercing ability to see through phoniness, and to related to stories of abusive childhoods.  To then turn into the same phony, was too much for him.  I think he consciously could not bear to live out his fate, which again, to someone of his sensibilities would have been the ultimate torture.  It was really kind of weird that with all his fame, he would have all that time to himself, or to be relatively alone in a big remote house like that.  But then, perhaps that indicates how much of it was showbiz, and not real.  I think what killed him was his own judgement of himself.",1440028800,4,992,4.163157894736842

I have always thought Courtney Love had something to do with it and now after seeing everything laid out onto the table in the recorded evidence Tom Grant provided in the movie i cant see there being any way she had no clue what was going on. Other awesome points to this movie is it was well filmed,very well organized, and kept you informed of dates, time lines, etc without anything confusing.

7210167,5,B00YAZNBTI,"I will not write s long review here as I think it has been done many times over at this point. I did want to register my vote as the trolls of Courtney Love are out there following their orders and using every opportunity they can to downgrade this movie by giving it low ratings.

I hate to spoil it for them but their ploy will ultimately fail because the grass roots movement through simple word of mouth will triumph in the end. Courtney Love tried to get Nick Broomfield's Kurt & Courtney stopped at every opportunity and failed. She managed to have it taken out of consideration at the Sundance Film Festival, it failed it was shown down the street.

She just recently sicked her attorney's on the makers of this film and the brave and courageous theaters that were going to show it! All but one went against Love's cease and desist order. Again she failed!

Why? Because hundreds of thousands of people firmly believe after 21 years there are many unanswered questions surrounding the death of Kurt Cobain. These questions persist, because they have not been answered. They could have been dealt with honestly many years ago, they were not. Ms. Love despite promising to release the autopsy report to independent investigators has not done so. Nor has she come forward and addressed any of the questions regarding the conflicting statements she made and her suspicious behavior in April 1994.

Why? Well, I am not entirely sure. But it seems to me an honest person, a guiltless person would not want people walking around thinking they were responsible for the demise of their husband. I would have done everything in my power to answer all the questions and allow whoever wanted to examine the documents to do so. Why? Because I am innocent and have nothing to hide. Knowing this I would go as far as taking a polygraph test, just like the man she allegedly offered $50,000 to ""whack"" Kurt Cobain did and passed without a doubt. But none of that has happened so the questions remain unanswered.

Tom Grant has pursued these answers for 21 long years. He has been labeled so many negative things, from being an outright liar to making millions during the decades he has worked to find the truth. His character has been denigrated, and maligned on countless occasions but he is neither a liar nor a wealthy man. He lives a very simple life on a small pension and has held his head up high every day since that unfortunate day he answered the phone in his Los Angeles office on Easter Sunday in 1994. This is a man I believe in. I believe he is telling the truth as he experienced it and has asked for the questions to be answered. He has persevered these indignities to find the truth. I respect and support that.

This movie, while not entirely his movie, as some critical reviewers would state, does tell story of what he experienced and the questions and inconsistencies he discovered in April 1994. These questions are all discussed and explained succinctly and backed up by expert testimony. Every expert calls for one simple thing, to reopen the Kurt Cobain case.

Find the answers to the unanswered questions and the reasons for the rush to judgment, i.e. the closing the case and labeling it a suicide the very same day Kurt Cobain's body was discovered in the green house. This was a mistake made by the Seattle Police Department and today the former chief of police at the time has said publicly that if he were in charge today the case would be reopened. What more do people want? Labeling this case so quickly a suicide was not what should have happened and that is very clear movie or not.

Kurt Cobain deserves better than that. He deserves another hearing. He deserves an independent investigation conducted by an agency other than the police force in Seattle. If this is done and it turns out Cobain actually did commit suicide, so be it, but for god's sake reopen the case and let's put an end to this decades long controversy.

What the hell is wrong with giving it another look, what are people scared of? We need to find this out!",1439510400,13,4056,4.606648199445983

She may delayed the film but it still saw day light. She threatened legal action but never follows through cause if she did take them to court that would mean a possibility of reopening the case and she does not want that cause she is guilty.. Other sites have been sabotaged on reviews even before the film was released and after to try and make people avoid seeing this documentary.

While there is some dramatization by actors to flesh out some of the chronology of events, the majority of the film presents interviews with law enforcement and medical experts, and most of all private investigator Tom Grant. Mr. Grant is unimpeachable. The facts presented in ""Soaked in Bleach"" are the result of his research as the man hired by Kurt Cobain's wife to investigate Kurt's disappearance in early April 1994. Please watch this documentary and decide for yourself whether the death of Kurt Cobain deserves to be reopened and investigated by an unbiased, third-party law enforcement entity other than Seattle PD. Decide for yourself why someone threatened legal action when this movie was released in theaters, yet never followed through with that legal action.

I was not a Nirvana fan in the 1990s, I saw them on MTV (how could you not back then?) and really knew nothing about Kurt Cobain. I was indifferent to the band.

7210178,5,B00YAZNBTI,"I was aware of Tom Grant's claims, but have always been skeptical of ""conspiracy theories"". I never gave any credence in the El Duce claims (and still don't). I was very wary before watching.

I had not heard Grant's tapes and a good deal of the actual evidence until this documentary and to be honest the case it makes is extremely compelling. At a minimum someone staged the house, but at a maximum this could actually be a case of murder.

So much of what's been put out about Cobain can best be described as propaganda. This documentary does a great job of stripping the myth away and correcting the misinformation that we were all fed surrounding this event. I would be interested in seeing this film maker possibly venture into doing a piece on Kurt's life as well, since up until this point we've all been fed ""90% bull-"" about that too. I'd love to see a documentary with interviews with people like Buzz Osborne for a change. People who aren't bending the narrative to support their own personal motives.

I hope this documentary takes off and gets greater exposure. We may never know the truth about what happened, but even little things like SPD investigating and possibly officially discrediting the ""suicide note"" would make a huge difference as it still serves to inspire impressionable people with heavy hearts to take their own lives to this day.",1436486400,14,1362,4.714285714285714

There is so much evidence presented and so clearly shown, without a doubt there was foul play. The Seattle Police department mishandled this case in everyway, from just pure lack of competence. The reenactments are superb. I love how he ties them in with the actual recorded phone calls. Bravo to Benjamin Statler for doing what no one else has managed to do and present this case in a clear concise manner. A must see.",1434844800,12,591,4.481481481481482
7210183,5,B00YAZNBTI,"First of all, Courtney Love is trying to intimidate cinemas from showing this film by having her attorneys send threatening letters. Most are ignoring her empty threats. What is it she doesn't want you to see and hear? Her own voice making damning statements and caring more about her career than her missing, ""suicidal"" husband? Well, ""maybe it will help sell records"", right?

There is so much information in this documentary you'll need to watch it more than once to catch it all. I've watched this film several times and I constantly pick up new info.

Based on Tom Grant's actual recordings, case files, and observations during the days leading up to Cobain's death, this film takes painstaking steps to ensure accuracy. Thorough the use of actual recordings, you will hear Courtney Love explain how she easily lies to manipulate the press. Although she hires Tom on April 3rd (Easter Sunday) to try to find her missing husband, she conveniently leaves out critical information (he was seen by their nanny at his own house on April 2nd). She has Grant search everywhere except their house until April 6th. Love is clearly obstructing the investigation, keeping Grant away from the house until she is ready for him to look there. Why?

Includes police reports and interviews with expert forensic scientists and medical examiners across the country. The physical evidence suggests another person in the room as Cobain could not have pulled the trigger with the level of heroin in his system. The shotgun shell isn't where it should be. And, Love and Cobain were in the midst of a divorce. The film also includes comments from the former Seattle Chief of Police, Norm Stamper, who says, ""If I were the Chief today, I would reopen this investigation.""

7210185,4,B00YAZNBTI,"I have been studying this case for a number of years, quickly digesting any new material that comes to light.  After seeing this film as well as the Courtney-authorized film Montage of Heck,  my conclusion is that the case deserves to be re-opened.  There are simply too many details that don't add up.  Tom Grant seems to be a man of integrity,  but his inexperience with the hard drug world is somewhat apparent.  While many of the questions raised are valid,  I don't hold merit to the fact that Cobain had a huge amount of heroin in his system.  It is well known that Cobain had a large habit and frequently sought oblivion in getting high.  I also don't hold merit to any testimonies that Cobain wasn't suicidal, that is mere opinion.  But this film does present a number of inconsistencies that should've been properly investigated by police but were not - especially surrounding Cali Dewitt and Dylan Carlson.

One thing is certain.  The life & death story of Kurt Cobain is by far the most intriguing and though provoking story in rock and roll history.",1434672000,5,1061,4.645161290322581

7210187,5,B00YAZNBTI,"This is a movie Courtney Love does not want you to see. It demonstrates how the wealthy and powerful can so easily manipulate and control the media, police, and consumers into believing anything they are told. It clearly cements the fact that the Seattle police did not conduct a proper investigation into the death of Kurt Cobain-despite being alerted by a former LASD detective of the many inconsistencies and contractions spewed out by Kurt's (black?) widow before and after the body was discovered. They were told Kurt was suicidal and they bought into it, hook, line and sinker.

A few days before Kurt's body was found his estranged wife, Courtney Love, phoned in a fabricated missing person's report claiming to be Kurt Cobain's mother, telling authorities he had just bought a gun and was suicidal. She didn't tell them she knew he had been seen at his own house-or that he left a contact phone number where he could be reached. She also hired a private investigator, Tom Grant, to help track Kurt down by telling him someone was using Kurt's credit card. Grant later found out that was a lie, which she admitted. Though she tries to deny it in Montage of Heck, it's a well known fact she had or was currently having an affair with Billy Corgan. In fact, two weeks after Kurt's body was found they were spotted together at the Canyon Ranch Resort. So Kurt wanted a divorce and Courtney was in a state of panic trying to get ahold of him before he filed. She was used to controlling him, hoping she could stop him before he filed-but he wouldn't take her calls and was totally ignoring her.

A divorce would cost Courtney Love dearly, but as his widow she would inherit half of his estate-possibly worth billions in future royalties. Her album was days away from being released, and at one point she is heard on audiotape discussing her plan to gain sympathy from Kurt's unsuspecting fan base. The audience hears her planning the false story, and how she pays people to cover up her unethical behavior. We even hear her say, ""How's that for a spin?"" The movie proves her stories are all false, but the media reported everything she told them to say. Kurt Loder is heard saying, ""According to Courtney Love"" over and over.

There is so much disturbing evidence it would take up too much space. But the facts are there and the movie can't even cover all of the evidence Tom Grant has against Courtney. They do discuss how a handwriting practice sheet was found in Courtney's backpack by her attorney, and that the last four lines of Kurt's suicide note look different from the rest of the note. However, the most compelling evidence of murder is the heroin level found in Kurt's body. There are no documented cases of anyone injecting such a massive dose and then being able to pick up a shotgun, or a paperclip for that matter, much less having the time to neatly place the needles back in the box, pick up a shotgun and pull the trigger. It is not uncommon for people to be found with the needles still in their arms, that's how quickly an injected dose takes effect. With the level found in his system, he would have been unconscious within seconds-similar to when a doctor has a patient count backwards when they are going under for surgery. People try to counter that Kurt was a junkie due to his stomach problems, but during a taped interview shortly before he died he said his doctor had cured him a year earlier-making many suspect the note found at the scene was written well over a year prior to his death, when he really did have stomach problems. No one has been able to produce a case where someone injected the same amount of heroin and was then able to kill themselves with a gun. The bottom line is: three times a lethal dose-even for a hard core junkie.

To date at least 68 copycat suicides have been attributed to Kurt's death. Kurt's fans and his daughter deserve to know the truth. So Seattle PD, stop letting professional pride get in the way of finally doing a proper investigation. It's been 21 years and this IS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY!  Please hire an outside, non-biased agency to investigate and re-open the case-that's all Kurt's fans are asking for.",1434672000,59,4181,4.584224598930481

I have seen many people dismiss the murder theories based on bad information put out there by lazy journalists.

This film also details the completely incompetent and ham fisted way the SPD handled the crime scene, evidence, and ensuing case, with the support and testimony of former Seattle chief of police and other experts in the field. This case was a homicide, plain and simple and it's well past time that the SPD admitted that they screwed up.

This is the best documentary on the subject of the murder of Kurt Cobain to date, very well done. You might want to watch ""Kurt & Courtney"" too, and it would be worthwhile to do so, but watch it with a grain of salt. The filmmaker of that documentary evidently doesn't believe that the amount of heroin in Kurt's system was automatically fatal (it was).

""Soaked In Bleach"" is in many ways the movie version of the exceedingly well-documented Max Wallace and Ian Halperin book ""Love & Death,"" which is highly recommended. Stay away from ""Heavier Than Heaven"" by Charles Cross. Or read it with the full knowledge that it is Courtney Love's version of how she would like the story told.

Five out of five stars. If you care about what really happened to Kurt Cobain, Soaked in Bleach is a must. Kurt doesn't deserve to go down in history as a suicide. He was not remotely suicidal.

To enter a crime scene and declare a suicide just because the deceased has a shotgun lying on top of him is utterly infantile police work.
