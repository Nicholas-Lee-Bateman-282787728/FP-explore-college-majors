I love this video for educational purposes for little kids.  There are no deep revelations here, just simple here is each bird, here is a neat fact about it, here is its sound, and that's almost it.  It has a short segment on the story of Audubon and another short segment on a man who has been watching birds most of his life.  There are two other segments - one on making a bird feeder (too much work, when you can buy one for a couple of dollars, or make some other kinds much easier without using the drill, eye gear, etc.) and another on making suet.  Overall, I totally recommend for younger kids (2nd grade and younger).  Last observation -- this is a Christian family, so there are gentle references to our Creator.",1444003200,,842,4.291139240506329

8501338,5,B006NBQIHO,"I teach in a Christian school and my students have enjoyed this video professionally produced by a family.  The family's children do most of the presenting - flawlessly!  The photography is excellent and the content is informative for children and adults.  I really appreciated the ""quiz"" at the end for use in the classroom.  My 5 year old grandson also liked taking the quiz after watching it with me.  This family has also produced a video about butterflies that is of equal quality.  Personally, I love the inclusion of our Creator throughout the video.  Unfortunately, in a public school setting, that may not be allowed or appreciated.  Great for families, home-schoolers, and Christian school settings.",1348531200,9,709,5.104347826086957
