8706455,5,B00UGQDXPW,"Wonderful movie for children .  It teaches them that growing up, though scary, is a necessary part of life and that you can learn to change and survive this frightening process. It also teaches them to ""let go"" of childhood and with it, share what they experienced with the younger children they know and help them face growing up also. The young person I gave this movie to as a Christmas gift has watched it many times and gladly gave up his childish toys to another and entered a new life concept.  I am very proud of the way this movie showed him how to change his future successfully. .",1484352000,,591,4.363636363636363
