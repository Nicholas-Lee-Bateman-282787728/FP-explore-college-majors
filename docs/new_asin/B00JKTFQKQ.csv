8652027,3,B00JKTFQKQ,"The Colony:

It was alright.  They spun up a bunch of different themes and conflicts then didn't really have time to resolve them all.  Would have been a much better film if they had gone with the theme that they followed to the end.  There wasn't much closure at the end either, given some short dialog it would have been cleaner.

Stranded:

Ugh... this feels like a B film trying to be bigger than it should be.  The science was just wrong too...

The astronauts were more concerned about CO2 than they were about the vacuum of space.  If the station has holes punched in it, you're not going to gain CO2 (no more than breathing provides...).  The scientist astronaut wasn't concerned about procedure at all.  ""Hey look, I found this meteorite with spores on it! Lets bring it back into the habitat.""  All this and the movie really hadn't started yet.

At some point I just stopped watching and made lunch.  I just didn't care about the characters, or what they were doing.",1414627200,3,976,4.5344827586206895
