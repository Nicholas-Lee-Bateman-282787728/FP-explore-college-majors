8398265,3,B003JMFB3C,This story failed to acknowledge Gerry Murray the rivalry between Murray and Cavello. Murray was voted queen of the roller derby. Although not taken away Cavello glory but you have to give credit where due. Joan Weston skated with the NY chiefs along side Gerry Murray.,1453852800,,269,4.869565217391305

8398267,2,B003JMFB3C,"I have been a die-hard Roller Derby fan, oh, probably since the earth began cooling.  I cut my teeth on this sport, starting in about 1965.  Each Saturday morning I'd be tuned in to watch the Bombers do battle with the N. E. Braves, the Midwest Pioneers, the Red Devils, the New York Chiefs, and Southern Mustangs--just to name a few.  That is where I was introduced to the ""monster"" known as Ann Cavello.  Ann was punk BEFORE punk; she wore a different color of hair each week--from green to polka dots.  She was brash; she was dirty; she was mean...and I LOVED every second of it!

I then heard there was talk at one time about doing her ""life story.""  This, unfortunately, is what they came up with.  I got to meet Annie personally when she skated a game in my hometown.  She was, as they say, bigger than life.  To see such a lame attempt to capture what she was and how much she meant to this sport was an absolute shame.  You get bits and pieces of stories, and that's all you get.  There is very little game coverage, and you can believe when I tell you that the Roller Deby was all about the rivalry between Ann Calvello and Joanie (""The Golden Girl"") Weston.  Their battles sold this sport because they were legend.  Unfortunately, I believe Joanie had already passed when this was made, so there was already a huge hole to be filled.  There is nothing on this DVD that you can't catch in either the movie ""Derby"" or just on uTube.

Annie WAS roller derby and I believe she was the only athlete that skated the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, and into 2000!  The tribute the Roller Jam did for her was very sweet and very deserving.  Still, if you're looking to find an in-depth portrait about one of the greatest Roller Derby legends ever, you'll need to keep looking.",1314057600,7,1776,4.362804878048781
