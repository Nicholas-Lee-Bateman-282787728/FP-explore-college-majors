7882736,5,6305104891,"I saw both Wu Tang Clan & The Heroes (taiseng video version)
At that time the dvd era was fairly new & I have both on vhs , I had  2 high quality vhs recorders so I can  make a 2 hour preview of all the cool old school fight scenes form the movies & this was one of them.  At that time I bought all the wutang collection on vhs, it was fun watching them during summertime when I skipped college classes to go home & watch them & had late lunches with it while watching , then I took a nap when the shows over.  After the nap I would watch another or I save it for dinner time.

I like the beginning of this movie (Taiseng Version) & past fast forward to the part with the Shaolin Palm Fist to kill the evil white haired guy.

Not the best kung fu movie but for an old school kung fu flick its pretty good.

Whats the difference in the dvd names, both are 1:33:1 & 90 minutes long so whats missing or which one has better picture quality over the other ?",1387411200,,953,3.881443298969072
7882737,1,6305104891,"I don't ask for much from a kung fu film but this film gave me nothing. But worse than that is that I bought the film so as to add to my small collection of films featuring some of the girls of kung fu and I had heard that Shih Szu was the 'Queen of Asian action films'. So I purchased the film expecting to see the 'Queen of Asian action films' featured and showing her style over and over again. So where's Shih Szu? There were a couple of girls that had a few lines but no action scenes with girls in them. So where's the'Queen of Asian action films'? Some guy kept a bunch of guys in a prison or someplace and he kept fighting or torturing them and that was the film. But if you want to see the best of the girl kung fu stars at their best, this film isn't it.",1381449600,,764,3.9038461538461537
7882738,3,6305104891,"A wonderful HK classic with plenty of well choreographed fights, and even a meningful plot (well, by HK standards).  The story follows a former Shaolin student, turned Ching -- Marshall Kao, who is forced to eradicate the very temple that once harbored him, and thus to betray his own btothers, who are initilally incredulous of Kao's new allegiance.  Torn between his loyalty and his friends who have all but turned against him, Kao forges a plan to redeem himself and pays the ultimate price upon its completion.
  The reason for a 3 star rating is the horrendous image quality on this DVD.  I do not recall the VHS being this bad, it simply looks out of focus most of the time -- a real f%^*ing disgrace.  Definitely recommend the movie, but do bring your prescription glasses as not to be completely baffled by the impressionistic DVD transfer.",1076198400,4,848,4.73469387755102
7882739,1,6305104891,"I didn't get past 10 minutes before I had to turn this movie off! I have no idea if the movie itself is good or bad, but this transfer is absolutely horrid! It's so damn blurry you can't even make out the characters' faces! Don't even bother RENTING this abomination. Another dud stamped with wu tang's name.",1034899200,,308,4.421052631578948
7882740,1,6305104891,"I might be able to enjoy this film, if it weren't so choppily-edited and badly transferred.  The audio is equally horrible, occasionally blaring and then fading out altogether.  Bad, bad transfer - hopefully it will get re-released in a more watchable form.",974073600,3,257,5.095238095238095
7882741,4,6305104891,"I don't know what some of these people reviewing this were watching when they got these ideas of the movie?  but they were well from the truth. This movie is some what suspect due to the few noticable editing mix ups, but if  you really look at what's goin on in the movie you'll be very impressed. Ti  Lung is amazing in this film.  playing the role of the bad guy/good guy/  who know's for sure.  follow him as he helps bring down the shaolin temple  that he studied from, working for the ching dynasty.  Instead of killing  all the students left alive he holds them prisoners, and tortures them.  Unwilling and unknowing the prisoners are being tortured in such a way that  there Martial arts is vastly improved.  But when they finally find out what  the purpose of there arrest, it's too late for someone. Ti lung is supurb  with his shaolin palm fist, and his concealed palm, which looks smooth and  deadly as he shows them off during the climactic battle which seems to pull  the complex story together. Forget what these other reviewers are saying,  and take a look at wu tang clan, you'll thank me.",964915200,8,1106,4.477386934673367
