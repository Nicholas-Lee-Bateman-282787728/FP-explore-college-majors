188125,4,1571196927,"THIS IS A GOOD PRESENTATION OF THE TITANIC STORY. ITS

CHARECTORS ALL EXISTED AND THEIR PERSONAL ACCOUNTS WERE

USED AS GUIDELINES FOR THE PLOT ALTHOUGH DRAMATIZED FOR

THE THE STORY. THE CAST IS GOOD ALTHOUGH THEY DONT RESEMBLE

THE PEOPLE THEY ARE PLAYING AT ALL. DAVID JANSON DONT RESEMBLE

JOHN JACOB ASTOR, NOR DAVID WARNER LOOK LIKE LAURENCE BEESLY OR

CLORIS LEACHMAN AS MOLLY BROWN. ALL IN ALL THIS IS A GOOD FILM

AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT.",1097798400,2,448,4.666666666666667
188126,4,1571196927,"This movie conveys the feel of ocean travel more than any of the others, including A Night To Remember, which was about the most British feeling movie.
S.O.S. Titanic gives more spotlight to steerage than any of the others, and endless scenes that are absent of music, other than what would have been the tunes of the time, also makes this one effective.
But scenes are cut! Scenes removed are:
*The opening scene of the Carpathian rescue (several of these scenes are spliced onto the end)
*The delightful sauna scene -- ""I'll give you, 'Sheharrazade'!""
*Yes, the boot shine lads are deleted!
*Mrs. Harris' fall down the stairs and her standing ovation when she next enters with a cast on her arm (for the record, this did indeed happen, her fall and the cast. I don't know about the ovation).
*The steerage sing along of ""Isn't she grand, boys? Isn't she grand?""
*Beesley observes the snoozing librarian and quips ""there I sit thirty or forty years on.""
*When Beesley jumps to the lifeboat, Fred Barrett asks him why he has his night clothes still with him in his hand, and Beesley laughingly replied ""I don't know. I don't know.""
*The sinking was longer (I recorded it off onto an audiotape years ago and still have it)
*Mrs. Astor's weeping scene was longer. It's cut here.
Thankfully we do get to see young Mr. Long and his companion, I believe, Jack Thayer, who had both been spying on the ladies sauna, when they jump off the ship.
We also see our boot shine lads debating prayer. ""YOu a Catholic? Me neither. What difference does it make now?""
It seems like there was also a longer stretch of a steerage dance that was removed.
The movie is inaccurate in stating that Fireman Fred Barrett perished. It was Fred Barrett who was manning the lifeboat that Laurence Beesley leapt into.
If ever the complete version is released, I would be very interested in obtaining it. As it is, it had been so long since I had seen this movie, I didn't care.
The re-editing job was done wrong or the original movie was done wrong, as we see Helen Mirren observe Ian Holm as he enters the lifeboat, she is already aboard, then we get Mirren talking to architect Thomas Andrews.
It really does look like there has been a severe re-editing job. The scenes of the overturned lifeboats should have occurred after the ship sank, not just before. This is also when David Warner is trying to bring someone into their lifeboat.
For some reason, this is pieced together as taking place just before the sinking.",1085702400,25,2490,4.61036036036036
188127,4,1571196927,"Oh, come on. Not everything on tv is factual. This one should not be graded on historical value, but on the entertainment value. This movie piqued my interest about the Titanic. The ""unsinkable"" Molly Brown, John Jacob Astor and his young bride, Captain Smith, - all of these characters were first introduced to me in this movie. The music is forboding, the backdrops were beautiful, and the romance of the ship is captured in this movie. Also, they did show how the third class passengers were treated during that period of time. With the multiple characters and plots, it is easy to pick a favorite character. I would suggest this movie to anyone who loves the Titanic.",1061424000,,671,4.743589743589744
188128,4,1571196927,"My wife and I were probably among the very few who had little good to say about Cameron's mega-blockbuster.  But many large successes often are inspired by less lofty examples.  I was shocked at how much of what seemed to make Cameron's version was already present in this one (even a cast member).
Ok, the plot is one we all know; big ship sails, has argument with iceberg, sinks.  No one will be surprised by that.  Cameron tried to make his version as historically accurate as possible, right down to menus and china patterns.  This movie does not make that claim and might be better for it.
Instead of flashy special effects and painfully correct sets that seem contrary to creating a new survivor, this film concentrates on the lives of the passengers.  David Warner (a manservant in Cameron's version) is a teacher who takes a fancy to an American school teacher.  Oddly enough, tone of the most repeated themes is central to Cameron's version, the differentiation of class.
Let's see, we have the wonderful Irish party down below, the poor boy falling for the rich girl with the big hat (hats being one of the few things I liked about Cameron's version), she takes a liking to him, etc. etc.
There was one disturbing scene that brought home the tragedy far more powerfully than anything Cameron did.  While people are beginning to panic in the halls as water begins to rise, the camera focuses on a crying baby sitting in the water.  Now, as a parent I cannot believe any parent would lose their baby like this, it was amazingly powerful.
If you want historical accuracy ad-nauseam, check out the over-long Cameron epic.  If you want to be interested in the cast and get a feel for the class interactions at a time before they fell apart, then SOS Titanic is the movie to watch.",1059350400,9,1785,4.620253164556962
188129,4,1571196927,"Oh come on! It's not THAT bad! I first saw this movie years ago way before the Cameron film was even thought of. For it's time it wasn't all that bad. I agree that the storylines of the characters were kind of corny, especially between Lawrence Beesley and his second class female shipboard friend (Susan St. James). I almost felt embarassed for them. A few inacuracies, but still gets to the point. I used to like this one when I was a kid and was home from school with a cold. It still comes out when I'm sick. It's fun to watch and brings back childhood memories.",1049587200,3,566,4.299065420560748
188130,2,1571196927,"As someone who has all the known videos mentioned by a previous reviewer and most of the leading books, not to mention  biographies of Capt. Smith, 2nd Officer Lightoller and other assorted Titanic memorabilia, (I could go on);this positively is the worst film of the trajedy. The funnels were in Cunard's black/red (with black rings) colours, instead black top/buff; the superstructure of the bridge was rounded a la Queen Mary (where it was filmed), when it should have been squared off, the overall dimensions of the film set of the ship were tiny compared to the 886 foot reality. Most farcical was when ""Capt. Smith"" (Harry Andrews) is bellowing instructions through his megaphone to those getting into the boats - he only looks about 10ft from them!!
The portrayals of JJ Astor, J Bruce Ismay and Molly Brown were appalling, totally unconvincing, under-researched and a travesty of the reality. When will film producers realise that when you film historical events, there is an army of highly clued-up amateur historians ready to pounce on you if you make a factual error!!I say lazy reearch.
The only redeeming feature for me was to see David Warner playing Lawrence Beesley, the science master who had just resigned from Dulwich College and was taking his first trip abroad. One of my books is his ""The Loss of the SS Titanic - Its Story & Lessons"" (Mifflin 1912).Read this if you want a factual account from a second class male passenger's perspective. The bit where he tries to seduce an American school teacher sounds almost libellous, at the least, fictitous. Strangely David Warner is the only actor I can recall who has featured in two film productions of this event. The other of course being the dastardly man servant to Cal Hockley, in Cameron's fanciful production from 1997.
Yes, I've got this video in my T collection but merely to have a copy of every available depiction. I do not find all the answers in any one but a bit of truth in all of them - admittedly not much in this one. Yes, I know this was made for TV and therefore had a limited budget for such a large canvas. One scene I liked was the Irish emigrants coming out by tender at what was then Queenstown, (now Cobh - I've been there) but why no depiction of Eugene Daly playing ""Erin's Lament"" on his Irish pipes?
Film producers have a horrible temptation to dumb down leaving serious students with a feeling of frustration, but I suppose as usual it's all about putting bums on seats, students need to read all the leading works to ascertain the truth!!",1048118400,,2538,4.703370786516854
188131,3,1571196927,"""S.O.S Titanic"", originally an ABC TV-movie from 1979, is not a prefect telling of the Titanic story but ranks far better than any other Titanic drama save ""A Night To Remember"" (and it is light years better than Cameron's putrid work!).  The only problem is that this DVD gives us the edited version that was released theatrically in Europe and which runs more than 40 minutes shorter than what American TV audiences saw.  At a three hour running time on TV, ""S.O.S Titanic"" could afford to spotlight many of the intriuging characters and subplots associated with the Titanic, but with 40 minutes lost in this presentation we get a much more rushed look at things that seem very incomplete at times.  Why Image Entertainment didn't try to get the original TV cut for release is beyond me.
There are some good performances in the presentation that haven't been topped in other productions.  Ian Holm is particularly excellent as the often villainized J.Bruce Ismay, this time playing him more as a real three-dimensional figure.  David Warner (who was sadly wasted 17 years later in a thankless one-dimensional role in Cameron's movie) is also the very embodiment of Lawrence Beesley, giving for the first and only time in a Titanic drama, the voice to the neglected Second Class perspective.  Some Titanic buffs have objected to the not-quite romantic relationship he has with the fictional character played by Susan Saint James, but I had no problem with it because the purpose of her character was to give Beesley someone to talk to and express orally his observations about the Titanic that he would set down in his book after the sinking.  All of the things they talk about are in fact taken directly from Beesley's book.
Pick it up if you're interested in completing your Titanic collection, but keep hoping that a cable channel will replay the full original version some day and tape that!",1022198400,31,1896,4.869565217391305
188132,1,1571196927,"A movie produced with an evidently short budget, special effect are poorly designed and absolutely not realistic, but what a shame.. the movie is filled of historical inaccuracies.. one of many.. as Titanic strucks the berg the engine room is reported to being flooded.. engine room is at the very poop of the ship and didn't fill until the final plunge.. and not much attention is given to the 1500 people trapped on the doomed ship.. we can't see one raising the railings and screaming trying to save himself..",1018656000,2,512,4.764044943820225

7797245,2,1571196927,"WHILE SOME MAY SAY THAT THIS FILM IS FAR BETTER THAN JAMES CAMERON'S GRAND EPIC ""TITANIC"" OR THE 1958 FILM ""A NIGHT TO REMEMBER"" BASED ON THE BOOK BY HISTORIAN WALTER LORD, IT HAS TOO MANY FLAWS. YES IT IS AN OK FILM BUT NOTHING MORE. IF YOU ARE A TITANIC FAN AND KNOW YOUR SHIPS, THAN IT IS VERY EASY TO PICK UP ON A FEW DETAILS. AS A WRITER OF THE TITANIC MYSELF, I WILL POINT OUT A FEW.

  1. THE SHIP USED AS ""TITANIC"" IN THIS FILM IS THE FAMOUS ""QUEEN MARY"" NOW DOCKCED IN LOS ANGELAS AS A HOTEL. IT WAS ALSO USED FOR THE FAMOUS 1972 MOVIE ""THE POSIEDON ADVENTURE."" SINCE THE POSIEDON IS A FICTIONAL SHIP, I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE ""QUEEN MARY"" WOULD BE USED AS POSIEDON; THAT IS WHERE THE ORIGIN FOR THE NOVEL ""THE POSIEDON ADVENTURE"" WAS BORN.  A PASSENGER WROTE OF HIS TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE ABOARD THE QUEEN MARY WHEN DURING A VIOLENT STORM AT SEA THE SHIP LISTED COMPLETELY TO HER SIDE, INJURING QUITE A FEW PEOPLE. BUT THE QUEEN MARY WAS ABLE TO RIGHTEN HERSELF AND THAT IS WHAT GAVE THE IDEA OF WRITING A NOVEL OVER THAT EXPERIENCE, THUS THE ""POSIEDON"" WAS BORN!

 2. TITANIC AND THE QUEEN MARY LOOK NOTHING ALIKE! YES, THEY BOTH HAVE BLACK HULLS WITH WHITE SUPERSTRUCTURES, BUT THE QUEEN MARY FOR INSTANCE, HAD THREE RED AND BLACK FUNNELS WHILE THE TITANIC HAD FOUR YELLOW-ORANGE BLACK FUNNELS. IF YOU NOTICE, THEY DON'T ACTUALLY SHOW MUCH OF THE QUEEN MARY'S EXTERIORS IN THE ""SOS TITANIC,"" JUST THE BOW SECTION.

 3.  THE INTERIORS ALSO DIFFER BY A MILE. WHILE BOTH LINERS WERE ELEGANT, IT DOES NOT TAKE TOO MUCH FOR ONE TO NOTICE THE DIFFRENCE. THE DINING SALOON IS NOT AT ALL LIKE TITANIC'S, NOR THE GYM, NOR THE LUXURIOUS CABINS. THE GRAND STAIRCASE OF THE QUEEN MARY'S LOOKS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR. THE WALLS WERE PAINTED WHITE WHILE TITANIC'S STAIRCASE WAS PURE OAK WITH BROWN WALLS. A WROUGHT IRON GLASS DOME HUNG OVER THE STAIRCASE ALLOWING DAYLIGHT TO POUR THROUGH WHILE AT NIGHT A LARGE CRYSTAL CHANDELIER IN THE DOME'S CENTER LIT UP THE ENTIRE STAIRCASE. THE QUEEN MARY'S GRAND STAIRCASE DID NOT HAVE A GLASS DOME.

 4. IN ""SOS TITANIC"" CAPTAIN EDWARD SMITH GIVES THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE WHITE STAR LINE BRUCE ISMAY AN ICEBERG WARNING AND LETS HIM DECIDE ON WHAT EVASIVE ACTION TO TAKE.

 5. NO WITNESS SURVIVED TO TELL IF THE CAPTAIN HAD IN FACT SHOWN ISMAY THE TELEGRAM ALTHOUGH ISMAY DID SHOW A FIRST CLASS PASSENGER AN ICEBERG WARNING ON THE DAY THE TITANIC STRUCK THE BERG; HER NAME WAS EMILY RYERSON.

  6. THE NEWSREEL FOOTAGE AT THE BEGINING OF ""SOS TITANIC"" SHOWING THE SUPPOSED ""LAUNCHING"" OF THE TITANIC, IS ACTUALLY THE LAUNCHING OF THE ""NORMANDIE."" NO FOOTAGE OF THE ACTUAL LAUNCHING OF THE TITANIC SURVIVES TODAY EXCEPT FOR A FEW PHOTOGRAPHS.

  7. THE QUEEN MARY BELONGS TO THE CUNARD LIME, WHICH STILL EXISTS TODAY. THAT SAME COMPANY NOW OWNS THE ""QUEEN MARY 2.""

  8.  THE TITANIC WAS OWNED BY THE WHITE STAR LINE AND IF YOU LOOK UP THE WHITE STAR AND CUNARD SHIPS, THE DIFFRENCES WOULD BECOME MUCH MORE APPARENT.

  9. ""A NIGHT TO REMEMBER"" IS CURRENTLY THE MOST ACCURATE MOVIE OF THE TITANIC DISASTER TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM SURVIVOR'S TESTIMONIES.

  10. EVEN THOUGH THIS FILM WAS DONE IN 1979, THE 1958 MOVIE ""A NIGHT TO REMEMBER"" IS NOT ONLY MORE ACCURATE IN TERMS OF EVENTS, BUT ALSO IN THE MODEL THAT WAS USED AS TITANIC. IT LOOKED IDENTICAL.

  11. ""SOS TITANIC"" ACUTALLY USES SOME OF THE SAME EXACT SCENES TAKEN FROM ""A NIGHT TO REMEMBER."" THE SCENE WHERE THE TITANIC IS SINKING AND YOU SEE HER GO DOWN AT AN ANGLE DURING HER FINAL PLUNGE, THAT SAME IMAGE IS SEEN IN ""A NIGHT TO REMEMBER!"" THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOTH MOVIES IS THAT ONE IS IN BLACK AND WHITE WHILE THE OTHER IS IN COLOR!

  12. ""SOS TITANIC"" IS THE ONLY MOVIE WHICH USES BLUE ROCKETS. ALL OTHER FILMS, INCLUDING THE REAL TITANIC USED WHITE ROCKETS FOR DISTRESS. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN RED WHICH ACTUALLY REPRESENTED DISTRESS, BUT BEING AN UNSINKABLE SHIP, NO ONE THOUGHT IT NECCESSARY TO BRING SOME ABOARD.

  13. IT WAS NOT A 300-FOOT GASH WHICH SUNK THE TITANIC; BUT AS DISCOVERED IN 1996, IT WAS A SERIES OF SMALL HOLES AND SLITS, SOME OF WHICH ARE SUSPECTED TO BE THE SIZE OF A HUMAN FINGER! IN ALL, THERE WAS ONLY TWELVE SQUARE FEET OF DAMAGE! BUT DUE TO THIER POSITION, ABOUT 30 FEET BELOW THE WATER LINE, THE IN-RUSHING SEA WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE POWERFUL THAN WATER SHOOTING OUT OF A FIRE HOSE! AS ONE FIREMAN IN BOILER ROOM 6 DESCRIBED IT, ""THE WHOLE SIDE OF THE SHIP SEEMED TO SUDDENLY CAVE IN ON US.""

  14. ANOTHER FACTOR TO THE SHIP'S DEMISE, WAS OPENED PORTHOLES ALONG BOTH SIDES OF THE SHIP, THAT IS THE ROUND WINDOWS IN PASSENGER CABINS. NO TITANIC MOVIE MENTIONS THIS VERY IMPORTANT DETAIL. YES, THE ICEBERG STARTED THE FLOODING, BUT DUE TO OPENED PORTHOLES AND GANGWAY DOORS, THE FLOODING ACCELERATED RAPIDLY. IN FACT, DURING THAT FIRST HOUR OF THE SINKING, THE TITANIC ACTUALLY STOPPED; AND FOR THE LONGEST TIME REMAINED STEADY AND MOTIONLESS WITH HER HUGE ANCHORS JUST A FEW FEET ABOVE THE SEA. EITHER THE TITANIC COULD HAVE SURVIVED IF NOT FOR THESE TWO FACTORS, OR AT LEAST STAYED AFLOAT EVEN LONGER THAN SHE DID, WHICH WAS 2 HOURS AND 40 MINUTES!

  SO NOW YOU TELL ME, COULDN'T THEY HAVE BEEN JUST A LITTLE MORE ORIGINAL THAN USING A SHIP THAT WAS ALREADY USED ONLY 7 YEARS EARLIER TO FILM ""THE POSIEDON ADVENTURE."" THE FINAL PLUNGE SCENE IS TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM ""A NIGHT TO REMEMBER."" I HAVE SEEN BOTH MOVIES SO MANY TIMES, THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND. IF THEY COULD DO SUCH AN ACCURATE PORTRAYAL OF THE TITANIC AND HER SINKING IN 1958, WHY COULDN'T THEY DO IT IN 1979?
 BUT NONETHELESS, IF YOU ARE A BIG TITANIC FAN, THAN I RECOMEND THE FOLLOWING AND YOU BE THE JUDGE:

  TITANIC  (1953) WITH CLIFTON WEBB, BARBARA STANWYCK
  A NIGHT TO REMEMBER  (1958)  KENNETH MOORE, RONALD ALLEN
  S.O.S. TITANIC  (1979)  DAVID JANSEEN, CLORIS LEACHMAN
  RAISE THE TITANIC  (1980) JASON ROBARDS, RICHARD JORDAN
  THE TITANIC (MINISERIES) (1996) CATHERINE-ZETA JONES, GEORGE C. SCOTT
  TITANIC  (1997) LEONARDO DiCAPRIO, KATE WINSLET

  JAMES CAMERON'S ""TITANIC"" ALSO PORTRAYS FICTIONAL CHARACTERS, MORE SO THAN ""S.O.S. TITANIC."" BUT IN TERMS OF THE SHIP HERSELF, OR THE HISTORICAL PEOPLE PORTRAYED, SUCH AS THE CAPTAIN, OFFICERS, THE RICHEST FIRST CLASS PASSENGERS, CAMERON'S VERSION IS FAR SUPRIOR. HE CAST PEOPLE BASED ON THIER APPEARANCES. JUST FOR THOSE TWO REASONS ALONE, HIS FILM OVERSHADOWS THE OTHERS. BUT DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE MOVIE FOCUSES SO MUCH ON JACK AND ROSE, A LOT OF HISTORICAL EVENTS WERE LEFT OUT. IN THESE TERMS ""A NIGHT TO REMEMBER"" AND ""THE TITANIC MINISERIES"" OVERSHADOW CAMERON'S EPIC. BOTH MOVIES REVEAL FOR INSTANCE, THE FACT THAT SOME TEN MILES AWAY FROM THE SINKING TITANIC, A MUCH SMALLER VESSEL, THE ""CALIFORNIAN"" WAS STOPPED FOR THE NIGHT SURROUNDED BY ICE. THE OFFICERS SAW THE TOTAL OF EIGHT OR NINE WHITE ROCKETS BEING FIRED FROM A SHIP TEN MILES TO THE SOUTH. THEY WARNED THIER CAPTIAN WHO WAS ASLEEP IN HIS BUNK BUT DID NOTHING. ALTHOUGH NO ONE CAN SAY WITH 100% CERTAINITY IF THAT SHIP REALLY WAS THE CALIFORNIAN, ONE MAJOR DETAIL STANDS CLEAR: THE OFFICERS WITNESSED THE SAME AMOUNT OF ROCKETS BEING FIRED AS THE TITANIC HERSELF HAD. COINCIDENCE OR A SINISTER REALITY?
  BUT IF YOU DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT ANY HISTORICALL ACCURACY, THAN ""SOS TITANIC"" IS A GOOD FILM. AT LEAST THEY PORTRAY HISTORICAL PEOPLE SUCH AS THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD AT THAT TIME, JOHN JACOB ASTOR AND HIS NEW BRIDE; THE STRAUSS, FOUNDERS OF MACY'S DEPARTMENT STORE (WHO IN CAMERON'S FILM, ARE SEEN LYING SIDE BY SIDE IN THIER STATEROOM AS THE WAVES CONSUMED THEM;) THE FAMOUS MOLLY BROWN, WHO'S ACTRESS BY THE WAY, LOOKS FAR OLDER THAN THE REAL MOLLY LOOKED IN 1912. ENTERTAINING ENOUGH, I RECOMMEND THIS AND OTHER TITANIC FILMS TO ANY FAN, IT IS AN AWESOME ADDITION TO YOUR COLLECTION.
  PS I WAS NOT MEANING TO SOUND WHINNY OR OFFEND ANYONE WHO ARE A BIG FAN OF THIS MOVIE, SO DON'T GET UPSET!",1240272000,3,7850,4.612554112554113
7797246,3,1571196927,"S.O.S. Titanic was actually the first Titanic movie I saw as a child in the 80's on TBS. It wet my appetite and made me a Titanic buff for life. It was made in 1979, so the special effects and production have come a long way since then. The movie is far too quiet and calm to accurately portray what happened that April night in 1912. For a collector like me, this is a nice addition to have. But, for someone wanting a thrilling, modern-day version, get the famous James Cameron version or the 1997 George C.

No Titanic movie will ever be perfect but this one wasn't bad.  Cloris Leachman's portrayal of Molly Brown is a bit over the top - more of a caricature.  I particularly liked that some more attention was paid to the second class and steerage characters rather than just first class.  I agreed with one of the previous reviewers regarding the waltz that the two Irish characters (Martin Gallagher and the ""Irish Beauty"") danced to - I'd love to know the name of it, too - it's quite haunting!!
