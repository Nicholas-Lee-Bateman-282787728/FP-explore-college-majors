3885038,3,B002AL2TWO,"Each segment is very slow-paced and not very challenging. Even for an overweight, out-of-shape, beginner, I did all of the exercises without difficulty and never broke a sweat.

But since I bought the video, I added 2.5lb hand weights to the arms section and did extra reps while waiting for Mari to finish talking and start instructing. Otherwise, you get 5 minutes of pilates for every 10 minutes of video.

 The 10 Minute Solution videos are by far a better choice.",1275523200,9,468,4.753086419753086
3885039,5,B002AL2TWO,"I've never done an exercise video with Mari Winsor, so wasn't sure what to expect, but I love Pilates.  In the past I have worked out to all the 10 minute solution and Element Pilates DVDs.  My grandfather died of throat cancer and my aunt is a recovering breast cancer survivor. Some proceeds from this video are donated to Breast Cancer Research Foundation, so I thought I would give this DVD a try.  I really enjoyed the Pilates for Pink DVD.  I particularly like how you use opposing muscles from one set of moves to the other, so you are constantly switching between stretching and contracting different muscles groups.  The only thing that was different for me is that Mari Winsor doesn't do the workout with you.  Part of the time is spent with her talking about Pilates and/or pointing out or correcting the form of the other people in the DVD.  So occasionally there is some down time between moves.  That is the only thing I don't like about this DVD.  There are beginner modifications for the exercise for all sections, but I think the workout is primarily for a beginner.  Each section is ten minutes long.  You just need a mat.

The video is easy to program.  The four sections are Tone Arms and Shoulders, Sculpt Abs, Trim Hips, Thighs, and Butt, and Fast and Fun for Firmer Abs,.  If you only want to do one section, you can click the title on the main menu or ""Build your Perfect Workout and link the sections together.  You can do any number of sections (1-4) in any order to create many individualized programs.  You just click and highlight the section(s) you want to do.

Tone Arms and Shoulders
Shape, sculpt and strengthen your arms and shoulders to develop increased flexibility and amazing definition.  Many of the moves also work the abs.  For example, there are several plank moves.

Sculpt Abs
In this section you will do stretches, twists, and smooth breathing to engage and strengthen the core and back muscles.  Improving abs and back muscles can lead to better posture and trim, slim, flatter abs.  Some example moves are the one hundred, roll ups, and leg stretches.

Trim Hips, Thighs, and Butt
By using your own body to provide resistance, this workout deeply conditions your lower body, shapes your butt and strengthens your core. You will see body-slimming results in your butt, hips and thighs.  This section involves a lot of leg circles and kicks.

Fast and Fun for Firmer Abs
Blast away belly fat with this fun core workout that will help burn calories and leave you well on your way to firm, flatter, stronger abs!  Some example moves are roll ups and teasers.",1271030400,13,2601,4.649122807017544
3885040,4,B002AL2TWO,"The DVD is a great way to work on perfecting your pilates technique! It is pretty intense, but very easy to follow.",1265846400,6,115,4.2727272727272725
3885041,4,B002AL2TWO,"I love the 10 minute segments because some days that's all the time I want to spare.  If I have more time, I have the advantage of doing additional segments.  The ONLY thing I did not like about the DVD is that quite a few of the steps were already introduced in another DVD of Mari Winsor's that I have so it was repetetive and in some ways paying twice for it.  If she's going to create another DVD it shouldn't repeat what she's already taped for another/previous product.",1257984000,25,475,4.314606741573034
3885042,5,B002AL2TWO,"This is my favorite video, it has all of the best Mari Winsor moves.  It is challenging yet not too hard.  I use one or two sessions after doing a run, walk, or a stint on the elliptical machine.  Perfect.",1428624000,2,205,4.075
3885043,1,B002AL2TWO,Mari talks through the entire dvd and the sessions don't seem consistent. She will do a rep on one side but not on the other or not the same amount. Not impressed.,1415232000,,163,4.125
3885044,5,B002AL2TWO,You do see results with in a weeks time. Work out is within 15 minutes by section. Can do quick workout in the morning and see results in a weeks time. I recommend to everyone,1403740800,,175,4.0285714285714285
3885045,5,B002AL2TWO,"I love this workout video!  Mari gives great detailed instructions so you know you are doing the exercise properly.  I like the fact that the videos are in 10 minute increments and you can also choose what workout you want to do. This works well for me because while I do want to workout daily; sometimes I don't have a lot of time to commit to a 30+ minute workout, but I can definitely squeeze in 10 minutes or more if I have the time.  It is a great workout to do after you have done a hard core workout too.  I definitely recommend it to others.",1400889600,,549,4.102803738317757
3885046,5,B002AL2TWO,Really helps with toning those tough to tone areas (thighs and tummy)...I like this one because you can customize the workout! Thanks Mari!,1395705600,,139,5.086956521739131
3885047,5,B002AL2TWO,Excellent video. I lost 46 pounds in 4 months. Worth the money. It was difficult at first but stick with it and it really works.,1390608000,,128,4.16
3885048,5,B002AL2TWO,"I gained ten dress sizes (and ~30 pounds) due to illness and treatment.  With Mari Winsor's DVDs, I lost it all.  This is one of the DVDs I've been using for 4 years.  It's great because you have 4 routines to choose from--you never get bored or stuck in a routine/rut.",1390089600,,269,4.235294117647059
3885049,5,B002AL2TWO,"Though previous reviewers don't like the pace of this video, I feel it is PERFECT for beginners.  We need to have detailed explanations in order to perfect the breathing and positioning of one's body, so that the pilates movements are done correctly. The episodes on this video are short and I would imagine that after one goes through it several times, one would know what to do and could go ahead on one's own pace.  This is perfect for me.  The slower, detailed explanations, with variations for real beginners, offers choice with descriptions.  That is helpful.",1372464000,,565,4.854166666666667
3885050,5,B002AL2TWO,This is an awesome workout DVD! This is my second copy of this since I wore my other one out! Love this!!!,1370217600,,106,3.8636363636363638
3885051,3,B002AL2TWO,I don't like how you have to pick a couple of ten minute work outs to make a 30minute work out. It is kind of choppy.,1366156800,,117,3.5384615384615383
3885052,4,B002AL2TWO,"I thought that it was a full clas of pillates, but its a compilation of miny clases that are specific for certain areas.",1355011200,,120,4.260869565217392
3885053,3,B002AL2TWO,It's four 10 min workouts. It focuses on your core in each. I do it because it's good for me but I'd rather be lifting weights!!!,1342051200,,129,4.0
3885054,5,B002AL2TWO,"I would recommend this DVD to anyone wanting to tone up.  The best part is the you can hit all body parts in one session.  I love the challenge the band gives and look forward to trying to master this. (Note: If it pilates ever seems too easy then you are most likely doing the exercises incorrectly)  I have tried other instructors but I really connect with Mari. Bottom line is.... this is fun and effective and I think you should give it a try, I would definitely recommend it to my friends.",1327622400,,494,4.290322580645161
3885055,5,B002AL2TWO,"I love this DVD workout, the best by far. Most effective for a 10 minute workout, easy and enjoyable. I do it every night!",1325203200,,122,4.125
3885056,1,B002AL2TWO,"I like her workout regimines except on most of them, including this one, she talks too long explaining the exercise.  My legs are hanging in mid-air while she gives detailed direction.  The exercise is hard enough without having to ""pause"" in mid-air while she explains.  I have several Mari Winsor Pilates DVDs and she does this on most of them.  It usually only takes me one or two workouts to get the exercises on my own.  The slow commentary ruins the workout for me.",1317340800,5,471,4.559523809523809
3885057,5,B002AL2TWO,"love doing pilates and really enjoy getting different workout dvds for a great price....would recommend getting this dvd if you want a really good workout...it's low impact, but does work you muscles...can't wait to get a new one..",1306022400,,231,5.105263157894737
3885058,5,B002AL2TWO,"I absolutely love pilates! This DVD is great 30 mins and my workout for the day is done. The best part is when I am done I don't have that worn out, exhausted, sweaty feeling afterwards. This DVD has 4 customizable workouts so you can pick and choose which 10 min workout you want to do.",1304553600,,287,4.142857142857143
3885059,3,B002AL2TWO,"I bought this DVD mostly because of the featured arms workout. It's OK for me, but I have to say that -again- for advanced users it might not be that great. It's not a strong workout, but it could be an ideal one for those days that you just don't feel like working out. Mari has gotten way too talkative on her last DVD's, so if you don't like this just put on music and the workouts will go on really fast. (It would be better if she talked while doing the exercises) The option about you creating your workout it's really the biggest feature of this DVD, in my opinion of course.",1302566400,,582,4.15929203539823
3885060,5,B002AL2TWO,I love this video because Mari Windsor is encouraging without being annoying.  The exercises are just difficult enough to get results without making you feel tortured.  This encourages me to continue and use the video 3-4 times a week.,1299110400,,235,5.0
3885061,3,B002AL2TWO,"I thought the excercises were intermediate, but the transition in to each one was too slow. The instructor talks too much! There is plenty of instruction on how to modify - great for beginners. I am having a lot of trouble with the function of the DVD when I try to customize my workout. The DVD blacks out between segments and I haven't been able to get it to go from one segment to another without the remote. Maybe someone else's DVD works better than mine. I'll stick to Denise Austin Pilates.",1294358400,,497,4.413043478260869
8359644,5,B002AL2TWO,"I am a huge fan of Mari Winsor pilates DVDs. While this one is good and comes with the resistance band, I actually have others of hers I prefer over this one.",1515283200,,158,3.96875
8359645,5,B002AL2TWO,"Good gentle workout, very relaxing.",1491004800,,35,6.2
8359646,5,B002AL2TWO,"love Mari and pilates, this one I rotate with two other videos from her",1487462400,,71,4.142857142857143
8359647,4,B002AL2TWO,"I really felt my core after this workout!  The slow and controlled movements are very effective for long, lean and chiseled muscles. I really like Mari's knowledgeable and sweet demeanor. I enjoy her workouts immensely. I'm awfully sorry that she is sick with ALS. I wish her the best. She has given so much to others.
The reason for four and not five stars is because I find most of the arm workout to be pointless without weights. Although the planks were good. I think more planks should've been used for the upper body.
However for core and lower body, it is very good!",1475280000,3,573,4.509615384615385
8359648,5,B002AL2TWO,Great workout!!  I like that the workouts are in 10 minute segments so you can manage your time.,1463702400,,96,4.333333333333333
8359649,5,B002AL2TWO,"I love Mari Winsor pilates! It worked for me 6yrs ago (same dvd) and it's working again now!
You don't really think it's doing much but then you can definitely feel a difference in a day or so.",1441843200,,193,4.105263157894737
8359650,5,B002AL2TWO,Awesome video it can do a short or long workout.  Really enjoyed it,1440115200,,67,4.153846153846154
8359651,5,B002AL2TWO,Awesome,1436140800,,7,7.0
8359652,2,B002AL2TWO,"Not my favorite, that is for sure. I consider myself an advanced exerciser, and this is kind of boring, to be honest. Yes, you do feel the burn in your abs, but it's not enough to make me satisfied. Yes, the workouts are very short. If you like that, great. I got this a long time ago for some reason, I have not clue why. I just wanted to try it again recently.  If you are trying to lose stomach fat, this is not going to cut it. AT ALL. It may help tone, but you better get lots of cardio in if you want to even see your abs. I have done way better Pilates routines that did not make me want to fall asleep in the middle and move on. As soon as I was done, I put my Jillian Michaels video in.",1429315200,,695,3.793103448275862
