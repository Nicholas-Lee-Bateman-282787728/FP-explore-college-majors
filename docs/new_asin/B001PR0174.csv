8334345,2,B001PR0174,"this nothing but a copy of the nova pbs program that was produced for the sole purpose og ""proving the single bullett theory""  the program also serves an injustice to the dallas dr's by taking ther opinions out of context by editing making them look like bumbling idiots. not one word was said about nova in the product offer or the liner notes on the package. shame on all of you,keep up the good work on the on-going cover-up.
