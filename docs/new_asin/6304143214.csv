809712,2,6304143214,"This bomb possesses arguably the coolest title conceived by Troma.  Too bad the content doesn't live up to the premise.  One expects lowbrow entertainment from Troma, but there are few laughs in this plot about racial hatred. There are occasional memorable moments as biker Mama rides hell-bent for vengeance against teen nazis Adolf and Eva.  But overall, ""Surf Nazis Must Die!"" is a SStinker.

It's one of those movies that's so completely without any redeeming value that it actually  ends up being enjoyable.  If I had to describe it, I'd call it a cross  between ""Repo Man"" and ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""...  with nazis and surfing thrown in for good measure.  If you can enjoy  something lewd, crude, bizarre, and outrageously bad, you'll probably laugh  yourself silly and enjoy this movie.

The reason I'm giving this movie 5 stars is because one of my husbands friends begged and begged me to turn this horrible movie off. But after listening to him talk for hours on end on how horrible the government is every time he came over, I decided I would continue to watch it even though I myself didn't like it simply because it secretly gave me pleasure in torturing him.

809805,4,6304143214,"On a lonely night at my job I had the chance to Direct TV order a Free Movie known as SURF NAZIS MUST DIE.  The movie is about gangs of surfers, armed with guns, knives, boats and books called KNITTING MADE EASY.  Conflict erupts over the waves, the beach and the copies of KNITTING MADE EASY.  You'll be saying ""aloha"" to a kind of tropical beach boring bungalo boogie meets Repo Man.  The result is a strange, utterly existential art film about waves and conflict.  The actors look like roadies for Love and Rockets, the music is relentless synthesizer washes that blend into slow motion violence and depressing beach scenes.  Perfect gift for those considering a journey to a zombie infested island or wasted end of the road ""tropical"" bummer fests on the road of life.  As an added bonus at the end of the movie you are given a chance to order products with money to create that beach bummer look that will last a lifetime or more.",1351123200,,935,4.497041420118343
809806,2,6304143214,"This film is a case of the idea being better than the execution (also see, for example, Jesus Christ: Vampire Killer). The film seems to focus on meaningless interactions between characters that do nothing to move the plot along, and all of the action takes place in about the last 10 minutes. There are several places where you may think things will start to pick up, but it never does. Edited down to about 20 minutes, this could have made for a mildly amusing short film; as it is, it's just overwrought and boring.

Of course, if you're like me, you' re going to watch this movie no matter what you read about it--and you should! But, this is not a ""so bad it's good"" sort of movie it's more of a ""What the hell did I just watch?"" type of movie.",1327449600,,749,4.274647887323944
809807,1,6304143214,"I'm ashamed to admit that I saw this film on VHS a long, long time ago. Some movies are so bad they are funny, ala Rocky Horror Picture Show or Toxic Avenger. This is not. This is a different level of terrible. It's so bad you can't just enjoy it for its badness. I have expunged most of it from my mind, and hopefully after another 25 years or so I won't even remember that I ever saw it. I've seen plenty of bad films, but this is the standard, the benchmark, the absolute rock bottom of the barrel. I suppose if you do watch it, then you'll always be able to say ""at least it wasn't as bad as surf nazi's must die"" so maybe that's why it deserves the one star instead of zero.",1296172800,2,679,4.0
809808,5,6304143214,"I must say this is one of my all-time favorite films. It's beautifully filmed and choreographed, with interesting characters. It also features one of the best film scores of all time. However, it is probably not what people expect given the title and cover art. This is more of an artistic work in independent film territory, than the regular sorts of pulp films put out by Troma. It doesn't really fit in well with the rest of their catalogue. And while the Toxic Avenger is slightly amusing, I'm not much of a fan of Troma's other work, so perhaps that is saying something.

This is also not a film for the ADD generation. It has a leisurely pace and isn't non-stop explosions, which is why I imagine so many people here find it boring. They would probably find ""Conspiracy"" (another nazi related film, w/ Kenneth Branagh), boring as well, even though that is an excellent, excellent film.  If you can't be pulled in to the mood of this film and be compelled by the beauty in it, then I don't think you are going to enjoy this one. It would also help if you are a fan of the 80s time period.

By the way, I do like watching horrible movies for comedic value (a'la MST3K), so I can definitely appreciate that sensibility. But I don't put this film in that category.",1292112000,5,1266,4.448275862068965

809824,3,6304143214,"In the near future, a Californian beach has been taken over by a ruthless gang called ""The Surf Nazis"" whom are modern day neo-nazis  and their leader nicknamed Adolph who literally can surf and would hurt anyone who enters their territory or gets in their way. When an African-American fellow named Leroy gets murdered by them, his mother sets off to buy weapons as she plots to take revenge for her son's death.

Silly and entertaining Sci-fi action comedy romp from Troma which is not as bad as some people say! what can you expect from the studios? yes there is bad acting and cheesy special effects but there's some nice action sequences, nudity and violence abound, if you can suspend your disbelief then you'll enjoy this movie like any B-movie or Troma flicks.

This DVD has good picture and sound quality as the movie is the unrated director's cut with scenes cut out when it came out to theaters back in 1987 and has goodies like an introduction by Troma's founder Lloyd Kaufman, a interactive tour of the Troma studios building, the original Theatrical trailer and other Tromatic trailers, Troma Intelligence Test, interviews, deleted scenes, and more.

Also recommended: ""Battle Royale 1 & 2"", ""Terminator Trilogy"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Mad Max"", ""The Road Warrior"", ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"", ""The Warriors"", ""Escape from New York"", ""The Running Man"", ""Barefoot Gen"", ""Fist of the North Star (Anime)"", ""Troma's War"", ""Combat Shock"", ""Akira"", ""Natural Born Killer"", ""Rock & Rule"", ""They Live"", ""Leon The Professional"", ""Shaft ( 1971 and 2000)"", ""Cannibal!

809825,1,6304143214,"I garentee if this movie wasn't under the Troma team name, it wouldnt be known of at all. Only a die-hard Troma fan who cant bring themselves to say something negative in a reveiw about Troma would praise this movie.

This movie is neither smart nor intelegent in bringing the Natzi idea to beach gangs. Giving them a natzi symbol and calling the head cheese Adolf was about as far as cliche goes... it needed to go in another direction other then leave you wondering if a surfer who is obssessed with Natzi's and Hitler wrote this script to combine a fantasey of his or something?

THe movie IMO could have worked if it was a comedy... instead it's a badly acted stupid movie that takes itself too serisly at points. The whole thing should have been a full on comedy, not just bits and peices where if you blink you'll miss the 2 jokes in the entire film. And the mad momma needed a bigger role other then what she had. It focused too much on the wrong thing and it didn't look like they quite knew who the lead charactor should have been.

Surf Natzi's Must Be Boycotted From All Rental Stores, 'cause, hell, you don't wanna buy it!

Only the obsessed Troma fan will find 3 seconds of footage they like and focus on that as a praise then to look at the rest of the film and not see that 2 or 3 jokes based around the rest of the movie does not make it a comedy. It's art house trash.",1119744000,4,1385,4.215094339622642

809828,1,6304143214,"When I first heard about Surf Nazis Must Die, a few images flashed through my mind that made me very excited about seeing it.  I pictured WWII Nazis fighting Allied troops...ON SURFBOARDS!!  I didn't forsee much of a plotline, but that wouldn't matter.  I figured that there would be ample violence and enough unintended laughs to make this movie worth seeing/buying.  Unfortunately, Surf Nazis Must Die is very different from how I imagined it.  It is about post-apocalyptic California, where evil neo-Nazis rule the beaches.  Even then, there would still be potential for the film.  However, there is very little violence throughout the entire movie and there are almost no unintentional laughs, mainly because the director was actually trying to make a VERY serious movie.  As a result, it is boring and hard to sit through.  The only redeeming quality of this movie is the fact that we can watch as a lady in her mid to late 60s rides a motorcycle and kills a few people.  Even then, the action doesn't occur until the last 10 minutes of the movie.  All in all, I would recommend that you stay away from this one.  I'm sure that there are better movies by Troma out there, so you might want to try their most famous one, The Toxic Avenger.",1057968000,2,1243,4.651376146788991
809829,1,6304143214,"Awful movie produced by Troma Films (thats redundant!) that doesn't even qualify for ""so bad its good"" status.  The plot is set in the future where nazis who like to surf (Surf Nazis) rule the beaches and terrorize and sometimes kill anyone who gets in their way.  One day, when a man named Leeroy goes to the beach, he stops a nazi from mugging an old lady.  The surf nazis retaliate by killing Leeroy and then cooking & eating him over a camp fire.  I guess in the apocalyptic future...there's no McDonalds to go to.  Anyway...this time the nazis, led by a leader with a real original name...Adolf,  killed the wrong guy because Leeroy's bible toting mother,""Mama"" Washington, turns into a gun toting mother bent on bloodthirsty revenge against the entire legion of surf nazis (theres about 5 or 6).  This movie stinks...its boring, unfunny, and intercut with good surfing footage, but who cares? The best part is the climax where Mama kills off the nazis (you can pretend she kills them because they can't act and the movie needs to end!), but even the gore and violence is pathetic.  Also, the 80s synthesizer music makes a nauseating soundtrack, but it's appropriate. I laughed once, when Mama runs over the female nazi with her speed boat and knocks her head off.  Troma films has better work in their catalog...and thats saying something. Skip this one unless you are utterly desperate or happen to like films about Surfing and Nazis.  I think this and Point Break are the only two films that include both.",1053388800,3,1513,4.718631178707224

This movie is a balance of sex, violence and surfing along with a speedboat scene when Mama catches up with Adolf and his girlfriend who just knocked two surfers over the head to make a getaway with their surfboards.  ""Did the Surf Nazis do this to you? Mama asks,  Which way did they go?"" And she cuts his girlfriend's head right off with the outboard for you and me, then it bobbs along the waves in the beautiful briney sea.  Let that be a lesson not to steal Mama's motorcycle.  Who's Mama? Just a sweet little lady who resides at a nursing home where the nursing staff sedates their residents to keep them happy and serene.
