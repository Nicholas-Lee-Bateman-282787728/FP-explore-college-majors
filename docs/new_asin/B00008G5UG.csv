8607311,2,B00008G5UG,"There is nothing wrong with the footage, narration, or sequencing.  It would have been a super video if the disco-sounding background ""music"" hadn't been way, way TOO LOUD!  Even some kind of military music or better, NO MUSIC at all would have convinced me to collect the entire seris. This music issue is my only complaint; couldn hear or enyoy this documentary because of the loud music.  This is the only thing wrong with this video as far as I am concerned.  But, I might add, that the over-the-top-too-loud music has kept me from purchasing any other parts of the series.  Shame on the Allegro Corp for not having someone familiar with war documentaries preview it before they went to press.",1368403200,2,697,4.7272727272727275
