8508756,5,B00726IE0S,"I am still at a loss for words. Cambodia...poor, still living with the results of Pol Pot and the killing fields. A beautiful people, a stunning countryside...how did this happen? Why?  ""The Angry Skies"" answers some of these questions, if you have ever looked upon the killing fields and travelled to S-21, this Cambodian Journey still has the power to shock-the killers are hiding in plain sight.",1394064000,4,398,4.940298507462686
8508757,5,B00726IE0S,"Quite insightful and Kerr got to places that I have just seen reported on. Having worked there during the early 90s, I learned some new facts of very specific situations. Great for an overall view of the development of Cambodia since the UN came in, the aftermath and of course the war and Pol Pot era..",1388016000,4,303,4.428571428571429
8508758,3,B00726IE0S,"I needed a video in place of ""The Killing Fields"" to show my high school Modern Asia class (TKF is R-rated).  This video is an alright substitute.  You cannot show this video without adequate knowledge of what occurred in Cambodia (which my history class covers, but for a viewer looking for a historical movie on 1970s Cambodia this is not).  The beginning of the video is great because it goes to historical locations in Cambodia that they have turned into museums.  One example is a 3-story school that was used to hold and torture political prisoners.  The narrator is a doctor so he gives decent analysis of what is occurring in torture.  He walks around some mass graves and picks up a bone fragment that is just lying in the pathway (that was interesting).  The second half of the video focuses on the political mess that is modern day Cambodia.  Just because it has a new gov't doesn't mean the Khmer Rouge is not still around.  There have been no human rights tribunals against the Khmer Rouge (the main focus of the documentary) and the narrator has actual interviews with Khmer Rouge people who should and could be tried.  However, the interviews are shallow and lack any substance.  The whole time the narrator is in Cambodia the Gov't and the Khmer Rouge call to check up on him.  That makes for an interesting sub-plot as students get to see that Cambodia is still not fully open to have tourists visiting and sticking their noses around.  All-in-all the documentary gives an interesting take on how Cambodia is coping with a recent genocide that truly hurt their culture and society.",1363046400,6,1598,4.705035971223022
