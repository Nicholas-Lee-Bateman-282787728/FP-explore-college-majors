8594656,5,B00DN3U6ZK,"This movie is hysterical! If you don't like reading subtitles, I still recommend you try this movie. It is a romcom, but the story is fresh and the acting is amazing! I saw this in a theater at a museum event, and I have never heard an audience laugh so much or so often for a movie. 10/10",1474070400,2,289,4.0
