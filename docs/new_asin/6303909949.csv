This was the first, last, and only movie to feature the Enterprise D, which is THE ship that built ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", and is better looking than even the new  Enterprise E, no contest. Plus this movie had the move  u-n-b-e-l-i-e-v-a-b-l-y cool lighting effects which you'll probably never  see in a Trek film again.

If that doesn't get you, maybe Data's annoying laughter will. I especially like Picard's weird pseudo-Victorian family (children all the same age for some reason?), the whole crew in Napoleonic era naval uniforms, and Data saying a swear word.

730389,5,6303909949,"For what it is, this is an incredible film. I just watched it again last night and had forgotten what an amazing job it did of transitioning the original crew movie into the Next Generation crew. I'm sorry that the Next Gen crew only got to make three films together, but this is definitely a great starter for them. I thought it paid proper respect to Kirk for his years of service and allowed him to go out as a hero. He may not have piloted a dying ship into the heart of an enemy fleet to go out with a bang, but in the end this film showed where his heart always lay: his duty to helping others. The classic line ""Who am I to argue with the captain of the Enterprise?"" showed that even in paradise Kirk kept his sense of humor.

All of the actors did wonderfully with their onscreen moments, even though most of them had little more than brief cameos (Dr. Crusher may have had five lines in the whole thing). It was also an interesting dynamic to see Chekov, Kirk, and Scott representing the original crew, as I don't think we'd ever seen that combination before. Although it would have been much more fitting to see Spock as one of the team, it all fit into Kirk's prophecy from Star Trek V, where he stated that he always knew he die alone...even though he was actually just pulled into the nexus at the time.

If you are familiar with the series and the team dynamics, there's not a lot to be unhappy with in this film. I'm so thankful they were made this film as a tribute to the fans of both series. Maybe someday we will see some of these guys show up again in the new Star Trek universe one more time.",1501459200,,1613,4.2
730390,5,6303909949,"I love the fact that this really is the official hand-off of the old series to the new, even if it is after the actual fact. The story was very well written and weaves together two very different Star Treks, paying homage to one and instilling a blessing on the other. Be sure to watch this on your laptop so you can pull up the trivia easter eggs sprinkled throughout the movie. They will give you back story or perhaps a fact about the actor or the scene or location and can be interesting by themselves.

Until this movie, I never realized what an accomplished horseman Shatner is.  In the scene with him and Patrick Stewart, what people don't realize is Shatner is riding his own horse on his own property and did his own jumping over the ditch, something he did often at that time with that horse. Stewart does not ride his own horse in this film but the saddle he grabs is his own, also being an accomplished horseman in his own right. To watch the equestrian interplay between the two actors is lovely if you have a decent grasp of equitation. Shatner's horse is not out of control at any time when he's dancing around. The actor is giving the horse very subtle cues to make the movements that it makes. Stewart is not just sitting there either.  It takes an equal amount of horsemanship to keep a mount calm and immobile while another horse circles it that closely. To think they did this while reciting lines and doing scenes is amazing to me.",1501372800,2,1452,4.41044776119403

730533,4,6303909949,"A kid's review:

This movie is really something; a great plot line, characters from both Star Trek The Original Seriesand The Next Generation.

This movie is full of jokes. It has almost as many jokes in it as Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.

The only downside is it needs more of The Original Series. It only contains Captain James ""Jim"" Kirk (William Shatner), Lieutenant Commander Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott (James Doohan), and Ensign Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig). It could really do with the other four well-known cast, namely Lieutenant Commander Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy (DeForest Kelley), Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu (George Takei), Commander Spock (Leonard Nimoy), and Lieutenant Nyota Uhura (Nichelle Nichols).

Great movie, though.",1498089600,,731,5.442477876106195

Anything less than five stars is Blasphemy...",1493856000,,61,5.2
730536,4,6303909949,"Star Trek Generations is a good movie, but its not in my top four Trek movies, which include The Wrath of Khan, The Voyage Home, First Contact, and the 2009 reboot, Star Trek. Those four movies are all five star. I fell asleep watching the first Star Trek movie, but the two movies that I least like are Star Trek Insurrection and Star Trek Nemesis.

Youre probably thinking I don't like Star Trek, right? You decide. I own five of the six Star Trek series on DVD. The original 1966-1969 series is my favorite. Ive also seen the animated version of Star Trek, with voices by the original cast. I have a handful of Trek documentaries on DVD, Trekkies, Trekkies II, William Shatner Conquers the World, Trek Nation, and The Captains Chair, and Ive been to the Star Trek Las Vegas Convention, but I don't own a costume. Im a geek, but I haven't gone that far.

Books Ive read about Trek include Star Trek Memories. I split my time between reading and binge watching sci-fi and fantasy series.

I haven't seen any of the movies or TV series from the following book series, but I did read the first books, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, Twilight, Outlander, Fifty Shades of Grey, The Long Earth, Divergent, etc. I sample a lot of first books, but I don't read many complete series. (Who has that much time?) The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins, and The Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) series by George Martin are a couple of exceptions.

Ive read both of those series more than once. Both are five star. The first three books in The Song of Ice and Fire series are the best. The Game of Thrones TV series is also five star. The first two Hunger Games movies are five star, but then they got greedy and tried to make two movies out of the Mockingjay book when there was barely enough source material there for one movie. The first two books in The Hunger Games trilogy are better than third book, Mockingjay, and the first two movies, The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, are better than the two Mockingjay movies.

Starship Troopers (1959) (not like the movie) by Robert A. Heinlein is the book that got me started in sci-fi adventures, and has remained one of my top five favorite military science fiction adventure stories for decades. The Forever War (1974) by Joe Haldeman, Armor (1984) by John Steakley, Enders Game (1985) by Orson Scott Card and Old Mans War (2005) by John Scalzi, round out my top five military sci-fi adventure stories.

If you like any of the above you might also like Jack Campbells The Lost Fleet series, Taylor Andersons Destroyermen series, Andre Nortons Star Soldiers, Andy Weirs The Martian, or Frank Herberts Dune. Other sci-fi and fantasy authors I like include Douglas Adams, Isaac Asimov, Paolo Bacigalupi, Arthur C. Clarke, Earnest Cline, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Terry Goodkind, Hugh Howey, Robert Jordan, George Martin, Larry Niven, Patrick Rothfuss, Brandon Sanderson and J.R.R. Tolkien.",1490918400,,2949,4.705426356589148

730695,3,6303909949,"I was fourteen years old when I saw this in theaters and I was floored at the idea of seeing the TNG crew on the big screen.  I was certain it would be awesome and I was determined to like it. Even as I saw it, however, I clearly remember that there were things about it that rubbed me the wrong way.

Twenty-two years later these things still do. I re-watched it today and there is still a lot to love, but there's a lot that holds it back from being amazing. My biggest gripe then, and it's worse now, is the destruction of the Enterprise.  If I can go full nerd for a second, the Klingons manage to figure out what frequency the Enterprises shields are at, and as a result, blow through them. However, our heroes have encountered this trick before ... countless times, and yet for some reason this time they have no idea what to do (rotate your shield frequencies - duh). Further, the Enterprise out guns the Bird of Prey by about ten to one, and yet Riker only manages to fire once before they decide to out think the Klingons.  This classic Star Trek trope felt forced and unnecessary here, like the writers clearly wanted to blow the ship up but didn't take enough time to make it believable, which when you read interviews from the time, that IS what happened. For someone who grew up with this as his favorite starship, such laziness still burns me to this day.

Much of the movie has a similar problem. At times the dialogue and situations are home runs, but just as quickly it becomes stylized, stilted, and forced.

So what works? Like the best Star Trek, when done well you come away feeling like you understand yourself and neighbors better. The concept of time, as friend or foe, rings true to this day. Shatner and Stewart together are magic, and while some are bummed to see Picard play the part of humble sidekick, it actually makes sense and shows he truly is the great leader and captain fans always believed he is. When Kirk asks Picard to call him ""Jim""  instead of Captain you know it means Kirk sees the greatness and friendship in Picard too.  Im sure we all dreamed of a longer team up, but what is there is poignant and meaningful.

Finally, many objected to how Kirk dies but it never bothered me. Perhaps that's because most of us can't choose HOW we die, but we can choose who we are when we die. Kirk dies doing what he loved and what matters to him. He saves Picard, the Enterprise crew, and millions of lives. He dies a hero, and his final moments still make me tear up.

Those last parts, the theme of time and the epic pairing of Kirk and Picard, still hold up years later and keep me coming back to the film. It's still a worthy Trek through the stars and better and more memorable than most of todays standard movie filler. It'll be interesting to see what time does to this film after another twenty years.",1483833600,,2843,4.357277882797732

'Admiral James Kirk' and crew are now retired from active service.
A new crew are about to give the new 'Enterprise' a trial, 'Kirk' (William Shatner)
'Chekov' (Walter Koenig) and 'Scotty' (James Doohan) are invited to join the
maiden flight, a short trip around 'Jupiter' and back, however during the early stage
of the flight the crew intercept a distress call, which after deliberation they respond
to, being the closest vessel.
The ship has not yet even been armed, they encounter a 'Nexus' in which the stricken
vessel is trapped, before they can assist the vessel is torn apart within the 'Nexus'
very soon after 'The Enterprise' is in trouble 'Kirk' in an effort to save passengers
sacrifices his own life ?
Seven decades on the 'Enterprise' name continues on the new generation of 'Star-Ships'
'Jean Luc Picard' Captains the Ship, times have changed down the years, a 'Klingon'
is now a key crew member 'Worf' (Michael Dorn) among the leading crew members a
virtual life like robot 'Data' (Brent Spiner) Second in Command 'Riker' (Jonathan Frakes)
these just a hanfull of the Generations crew.
A rogue 'Klingon' vessel is under the spell of 'Doctor Soran' 'Enterprise' crew-member
has been taken captive 'Picard' offers himself as a hostage by way of exchange, the
stipulation is that 'Picard' wants to go face to face with 'Soran' (Malcom Mcdowell) on the
planet 'Mridian 3' where 'Soran' is close to completing an 80 year obsession to harness
the power of the 'Nexus' if he succeeds the Solar System will self destruct when it's Sun
implodes.
Can 'Picard' stop 'Soran' ? as the procedure completes, the future and past is trapped
within the phenomenon, 'Picard' finds himself at a home he'd never had, nearby he comes
across a man chopping wood,, it's 'James Kirk' who had been trapped within the 'Nexus'
doing the same thing over and over again since the 'Enterprise' encounter with the 'Nexus'
80 years past.
'Picard' asks 'Kirk' to help him stop 'Soran' realizing the 'Nexus' was both past and future,
so they are able to return to a time before the power had been captured.
Of course the 'Generations' series had been running on TV ....with this four movie-series
we encounter new enemies and new adventures..........'Star-Trek' alive and well.

Thoughts on 'William Shatner's' exit.
Was it necessary for 'Kirk' to die ?
I look at it this way, 'William Shatner' had played the lead role alongside 'Leonard Nimoy' for many
years both in the long running TV series and the Movie-series.
The old crew needed to be replaced by a younger crew to continue the popular series, I suppose
'Kirk' could have been given a role within 'Starfleet Command' stationed in one of the central
bases, however that really would have been a bit-part only featuring occasionally.
Having been a leading light for so long I doubt that 'William Shatner' would have been content with
such a role....so I guess, though I know many didn't approve, the character had to be killed off

731274,5,6303909949,"I have written this review so there are no spoilers to those that haven't ever seen or heard of this movie.  While there are many fans of Star Trek (both original & The Next Generation) that have blasted this movie for the death of one of the characters, I wasn't so quick to dismiss it.

I found the writing to be superb and was very surprised that many of the characters we have come to love from TNG undergo a definite maturing process.  So it's not just a 2 hr TV episode.  I also found that the writers were able to bring the old and the new together in a very pleasing way that doesn't seem to be aimed at irritating one set of fans or the other.  However, there is no getting around the fact that the movie was written in such a way as to leave no doubt that Star Trek as a franchise and a universe is moving on from the old.

I hesitate to recommend this movie to someone that isn't familiar with The Next Generation TV series as much of the movie assumes you are familiar with the characters and their personalities.  I also don't recommend this movie to someone that likes the original Star Trek series but hates Next Generation.",1456963200,7,1139,4.24537037037037

Yeah, Generations is a tad campy. There is no arguing that. But it's fun. It's a good way to transition the Star Trek movie franchise from Kirk's crew to Picard's crew. And the whole Nexus Ribbon thing was such a better way to do that than through more time travel (which was used up in Star Trek IV)

If nothing else it's one last look at James Tiberius Kirk. You get to see what a baddass he really is, even if the 23rd century wasn't privy to the truth of Kirk's fate.

And just seeing Picard and Kirk in the same scenes together....it's a bit of nerdy overload...in a very good way.

Overall it's not as good as Star Trek First Contact, but it's better than Star Trek Nemesis. If you've seen the entire Next Generation series, you can't stop at the movies.

731608,5,6303909949,"The Generations collide in ""Star Trek: Generations"", a marvelous link between the Captain of the original series, and Sir Patrick Stewart of TNG.

 Star Trek Generations starts during the time of Captain James T. Kirk (Shatner) where a newly built and commissioned Enterprise is set off on her first voyage across the stars.  But trouble immediately interferes with her maiden voyage, and Captain Kirk is soon required to take heroic action which cause him to disappear into the ages of Starfleet legend.

 Then the film brings us to the era of TNG, where an aggressive and very mysterious Dr. Sorin (played by classical villain actor Malcom McDowell) tries to pursaude Captain Jean Luc Picard of his need to return to his research space station.  Picard suspects something maybe strange about the Doctor's behavior, and also has problems dealing with the friendly and super intelligent android character we love Commander Data who has an emotionally uncontrollable reaction to his newly installed emotional chip he obtained from his sinister brother.

  We find their is a hidden plot, and Picard finds himself in battle with Sorin and other plotters for what he believes is a newly designed weapon (although Whoopi Goldberg wisely informs him of Sorin's real agenda).  Picard, who has been dealt a terrible emotional blow with the recent loss of what ever family he had left in his nephew, must still lead his crew to solve this intergalactic time and space mystery to save the lives of people on a far off planet.

 The heroes find themselves on a quest to a portal to a neither world where fantasies and happy dreams become a person's reality, leaving the real universe with work, hardships, and responsibilities behind him or her.

 Star Trek Generations blend the themes we the fans usually love about the franchise together well with the space age stunts and special effects fueled action, tied with the thought provoking larger then life ideas the series is known for.

  The best parts for me in the film is where Picard enters the neither world ""Nexus"" (also a shampoo brand), and finds himself in the magical happy dreamland trying to convince our main man from TOS ,Shatner, to leave this paradise he is living in despite being comfortable in it in order to fight and sacrifice like a true ""Star Trek"" hero confronting the evil villain.

 Shatner had stated that the last fight scene against Malcolm McDowell was actually very hard to shoot, because the extreme desert heat had exhausted all the actors and crew. Some how they were able to pull through on shooting that difficult scene and thus they had made ST history.

 Very much enjoyed this Star Trek & believe it is a good addition to the franchise.",1424044800,,2717,4.875816993464053

It plays less like a real movie than a TNG two-parter (which can be said of all the TNG movies). The story is slapdash and downright silly, it all looks cheap, and the science, which is always notoriously dopey in ST movies, is criminally, hilariously dumb here. The ridiculously small-scale and underwhelming climax comes when the bad guy aims what looks like a homemade bottle rocket at a star, and the heroes must stop him before he destroys a whole solar system.

731702,2,6303909949,"Before starting on the film, I have to clarify I did not participated in any of the Star Trek films and I'm aware that I can't change any of the plot inconsistencies of this movie as well as the fatal production and character errors made in Generations and the remaining films. I also add that I hate the TNG movies (yes, including First Contact) just because there are countless things WRONG with all of them and I also have a particular burning disgust for Nemesis.

The only reason I find this movie watchable is for one ironic fact, WARNING! SPOILER ALERT!

...

...

SPOILERS AHEAD for anyone born post-2000's I suppose...

...

...

that is, Kirk's death.

There is one line on Star Trek V: The Final Frontier where Kirk himself says: ""I've always known I'll die alone"". So it's kind of a pat on the back for fans of TOS that the producers (purposely or not) stuck with that. Kirk decided to do his last heroic, having all of the resources (again, purposely or not) for cheating death with the Nexus he went and did something risky like James Kirk does, so he is (probably the only one in this f**king movie) still in character.

See, the problem is not his death, is the send-off. Buried in stones on the top of a mountain? No ceremony? No fault feelings from Picard? What the f*ck...

Now, where to start with everything wrong about the movie? Data is an obvious comic relief for the film, Worf has absolutely no use in the movie, Riker is an absolute incompetent in this film while in the series we are supposed to believe he has a bright future as a captain. Picard crying and looking through a photo album while in an obvious busy day.

But whatever, lets talk about the Nexus. Why does Picard ""asks""(?) the Nexus to bring him back to when Soran is already doing his thing on the planet instead when he was face to face with him in the ship and having him arrested?! Why the heck or how is Mrs. Whoppi inside the Nexus?

This is why I said what I said in the beginning of the review. Don't reference the novels written after the movie was released or comic books , or try convincing with theories that you come up with. We are talking about a movie, it is supposed to explain these things otherwise it is called a PLOT HOLE. And damn huge plot holes this movie has.

Truth is, this film was rushed and the studios demanded many things to be on the film. Most of stuff included here was written very fast and turned into a convoluted pile of mess. Meaning the producers, and they have said it themselves, don't have a clue how the concept of the Nexus works on itself, they don't know.

I mean, we saw the planet, the Enterprise with all of the crew inside blew to pieces when the Nexus passed there and then Picard goes back 15 min earlier to stop that from happening? If time has no meaning in the Nexus then, is that another dimension? did the Nexus broke the original timeline? What exactly happened. Truth is, all of the conclusions ever suggested are possible because not even the producers of the movie can or care to answer that. The same goes to the fact that you can't just get inside the Nexus in a ship, yet that's how somehow Soran got inside the Nexus, inside a ship. Plot holes my friends, and this movie not only exceeds to have the most of plot holes in the saga combined but in movie history. Nothing makes sense.

Who is surprised, on a film where even the special effects have room to finger the audience, just compare the scene where the Klingon ship is destroyed, with the scene of The Undiscovered Country. They copied and pasted the exact same scene. How ridiculous is that? Does that need an explanation? No, just like the rest of the movie.

You can skip this or go ahead, buy it. Watch it as many times as you can and construct your own conclusions, because that's the only purpose of this film apparently.",1416960000,,3843,4.391549295774648

731709,3,6303909949,"In this first TNG movie, the crew of the Enterprise must face a victim of the Borg who threatens to destroy entire solar systems to reach paradise - with the help of an old friend.  Spoilers follow.

After the end of the TNG series, it was to be expected there would be a 'movie.'  I am not really sure if making a movie was the right move - TNG finished on a reasonable high.  This film is competent yet in some ways disappointing.

I think the biggest mistake of the film was to reintroduce Kirk as a pivotal character.  TNG was a good enough series to stand on its own feet and didn't need the appearance of people from the first series.  It would have been better for the TNG crew to stand on their own, as they did well enough in 'First Contact.'

The other mistake was the mis(use) of the Klingons as enemies.  It stretched credibility to the limit that a couple of Klingon rogues armed with an obsolete bird of prey end up destroying the Enterprise, a ship which survived the Borg, Romulans, Husnock and other much more dangerous enemies.  The scene involving the bird of prey blowing up was even more laughable, as it was clearly stock footage of the destruction of the rogue Klingon warbird from ST VI.  The writers could have done this in much better ways.

The final annoying element in the film was the introduction of the 'emotion chip' for Data.  The chip turns Data into the ST equivalent of Jar-Jar Binks, turning an otherwise good actor and character into an unneeded distraction and annoyance.

The film is redeemed by some good special effects (the destruction of the Enterprise sequence and the crash landing on the planet are done surprisingly well), some reasonable acting, and a fairly good plot.  The potential of the movie and the actors though is undermined by the attempt to bring too much to the table (Kirk, the Klingons, Tolian Soren, the Borg, and the TNG crew).  A much better job could have been done by using other enemies, such as the Romulans or Q.

Unfortunately a disappointing start to the TNG movie series.",1411430400,,2046,4.546448087431694

Shatner really looks squeezed into his costume, and the final fight on the planet was just ridiculous.

731821,4,6303909949,"Star Trek Generations is a somewhat uneven film, bringing together James Kirk from the original Star Trek franchise and Jean-Luc Picard from The Next Generation. Both are pitted against a mad alien scientist named Soran, who desperately wants to get back to the Nexus, a kind of fake heaven where all dreams and wishes get fulfilled. Soran is ready to kill millions of innocent civilians to reach his goal. The plot also features Klingon renegades Lursa and B'Ethor and the mysterious Guinan (starred by Whoopi Goldberg). And, of course, the annoying android Mr Data trying to become more human...

Probably not the best choice of entertainment if you don't like Star Trek, but quite good if you do. Personally, I'm fascinated by the Nexus. It strongly reminds me of Madame Blavatsky's description of Devachan in The Key to Theosophy. Perhaps the wise lady Guinan is supposed to be Blavatsky? Yes, yes, I'm speculating wildly... Still, the parallel is intriguing!

Due to this unexpected similarity with the West's very own underground religion, I give Generations four stars, although it really only deserves three, or perhaps just two if you're completely uninterested in Trekdom. After all, the film contains many references meaningful only to Star Trek fans. I mean, who outside devout viewers of the TNG series know about Lursa and B'Ethor?

As for myself, I feel a bit like Soran. I just can't get the Nexus out of my mind. I have an appointment with eternity, captain, and I don't want to be late.",1408665600,,1504,4.936758893280633

732032,2,6303909949,"Twenty years on, looking back at Star Trek: Generations is quite odd. It's placement in the history of the franchise was unique coming just after the end of the Original Series films while The Next Generation, which had recently come to the end of its TV run, was about to begin its own series of films. What would be better than to bridge the two sections of the film series then by featuring the two in a film together? With that as both starting point and promotional point, Star Trek: Generations was released to theaters. Yet the finished film has proven to be one of the lesser regarded Trek films. Why is that?

The film was written, directed and scored by the production team of The Next Generation TV series and that ultimately was its biggest problem. Generations, as a film, feels like little more than a two-part story from the TV series translated to the big screen. Outside of  the opening 15-20 minutes of the film, its structure and pacing is far better suited for TV. Watching the film, one can sense where the ad breaks would go and find one or two places where the first episode cliffhanger would go. The film also does, as the TV series would do, try to find moments for all the characters to contribute something to the plot, which leads to some odd moments as well (such as Crusher briefing Riker and Worf in sick bay of all places). There's also a tendency in the film to break up important scenes by suddenly shifting tracks and trying to do a character moment inside of it with the two biggest offenders coming in the film's first hour. The result is jarring to say the least and breaks up the flow of the film immeasurably. That isn't the only problem though.

Where the TV origins are most apparent though is how the film starts picking up elements of Next Generation continuity. Data's emotion chip as well as the appearance of the Duras sisters are the two prime examples, things which work if you're a fan of the TV series following those threads but for anyone else coming in (or indeed even for a casual fan of Trek such as myself) they can be a bit odd. The way that Data's emotion chip is handled as well, in that it's used for virtually nothing but cringe-worthy comedy moments the entire way through the film, doesn't help matters either. The lesson here is that what works in a weekly TV series doesn't necessarily work in a film, especially one aimed at casual fans and a larger audience.

Perhaps the worst side effect of that though is what it does to the opening 15-20 minutes of the film. Though those opening minutes are arguably the best of the film, ultimately they fill like a time filler to simply set up the end and bring the film up to length. It doesn't help that Scotty and Chekov, despite the performances of both James Doohan and Walter Koenig, are written so bland they could have been played by anybody (and indeed were originally intended to be Spock and McCoy, the latter explaining why Chekov rather randomly asks about the Enterprise B medical staff and then goes to sick bay). It sadly means that the best minutes of the film feel tacked onto it instead.

The film does have its pluses though. As well as the Trek films' usually strong special effects, the film
has some of the best cinematography in any film from the franchise thanks to the efforts of John A. Alonzo. The film also has some strong performances including Patrick Stewart's Picard and Malcom McDowell as the film's villain Soran, a character so single minded as to be apathetic rather than evil. It also features some of William Shatner's best moments as Captain Kirk, especially in the opening sequence on the Enterprise B where Kirk first deals with being a guest and then throws himself willingly into the action and his final scene is one of the film's few highlights.

Despite some of its better elements, overall Generations is one of the most disappointing Trek films. The film's structural issues, odd pacing, over-reliance on using threads from the Next Generation TV series make the film feel like a two-parter from the TV series with an added prologue to bring it up to movie length. Indeed, looking at the film now,  it isn't hard to imagine this film as the finale of the TV series with the actual finale (All Good Things...) as the first Next Generation film instead. Frankly, I think it would have been better that way.",1392076800,10,4361,4.576184379001281

Then Star Trek became more cerebral and matured a bit with Captain Picard, and this movie made a nice bridge from one era to the next, with Malcolm McDowell making a fine, tortured villain, with a bit more to him than the one-dimentional ""Kahn"" and ""Chang"" characters.

732132,3,6303909949,"As a child, I literally could sit for hours and watch episode after episode of `Star Trek', regardless of the `generation'.  I loved the original series and `Next Generation', and I saw all of the films.  I even went to school for show and tell dressed up as Spock (needless to say, I had no friends).  Into my teens, my love for sci-fi in general shifted, but my adoration of Star Trek in particular seemed to plummet.  I just found it all so...dumb.

I was team `Star Wars'.

In my adulthood, it is always fun to revisit certain aspects of one's youth, and in `Star Trek' I find a lovely nostalgia that bypasses the obvious corn and gives me a sense of satisfaction.  With `Generations', Star Trek was able to bring both of their highly celebrated and beloved worlds together and give the fans a platform for completely obsessing over their dual captains.  The storyline is rather ridiculous (when is it not?) but the special effects are really well done (that crash scene is pretty spectacular, even at today's standards) and the nostalgia of it all is really all that matters.  Any fan of the show(s) will be happy with this.  It isn't a great movie, but as a time capsule it does its job.",1383004800,,1193,4.506976744186047

732134,3,6303909949,"Some spoilers of the first several minutes.

I suppose there are some things that have to be lost in translation between a television series and the big screen, but this movie simply fails to capture the character and feel that made TNG a hit. For one, the character of Data feels absolutely brutalized - his persona is entirely transformed and feels almost alien. For seven years we see a character who desires nothing more than to be human, and he's granted that in a very unceremonious manner. Some characters are just completely ignored, appearing almost only as setpieces with some limited dialogue.

Of course, a movie is more plot-driven than a TV episode, so that's worth consideration too. The main villain lacks appeal. Star Trek is full of great villains - the Borg, completely incomprehensible, or twisted geniuses like Khan - but this one is rather straightforward. His motivation is simple and his intentions are made known fairly early on - there's not much ambiguity to be had. He could do with a better introduction, as well. The presence of the Duras sisters at least brings up a bit of variety in the selection of antagonists, but they were never really characterized beyond ""power-hungry"".

Shatner makes a reappearance, probably just to juice the original series for what it's worth, but he manages to integrate well enough into the plot, providing clever dialogue and interpersonal interaction. The character of Picard feels a little off-setting at first but eventually becomes familiar again. But ultimately, you get two or three well-rounded characters, one completely bizarre series favorite, a handful of flat villains, and the rest of the cast cheer from the sidelines. Combined with an OK plot, this makes for a film that isn't a complete flop, but you should keep your expectations reasonably low.",1382745600,,1826,5.039735099337748

This movie is not only boring, but it makes no sense at all. The idea have have Picard and Kirk meet was a good idea, but you need a story to make that happen, and it goes nowhere fast, the movie opens with Kirk, scotty, and Chekov. Being apart of the Maiden voyage of the newest starship, the Enterprise of course. And encounter the Nexus, which cripples the ship. Gives us a glimpse of the main villain, and takes Kirk. oops spoiler alert lol, flash foward to the future. And Data decides he wants to be more human, so he inserts an emotion chip in his head, yeah it's that bad. So we have that to deal with, plus Picard goes all emotional as well, because, well it's never really explained. Now while they focus on that storyline, we still have the scientist trying to get back to THE NEXUS. With the aide of two female klingons, And after Geordie is kidnapped by said scientist, and Data just stands there. Because for the first time he experiences fear, Yeah I know. which by the way they never resolve this storyline, so anyway, even though he mopped and pouted around the enterprise. Picard won't let Data relieve himself of duty, after going through that mess. We FINALLY!!!, come to the main plot. They find out where the scientist is going, why he's doing what he's  doing. Picard negotiates himself as a hostage to Soran, and beams down to a planet, ANNNNNNNd Picard just stands there, yes he kind of tries to break Soran's defences. But it's too late, because Soran launches his missile into the planet's sun. Which blows up the planet, and the enterprise, since after the battle with the klingons. The Enterprise was crippled. So they remove the dish from the main hull, and end up crashlanding on the same planet that Soran and Picard are on. But Picard wakes up in the Nexus, Yeeeeeaaah. Now one of Picard's crew is also in the nexus, but it's a shadow of her. And we're told that nothing is real in the nexus, and so whatever Picard is experiencing it isn't real. And soo picard is starting to enjoy what he's experiencing, until he looks at a christmas tree. And see's an ornament, whatever, so he remembers what he has to do, and he's told that Kirk is in the Nexus. So after a few words, Kirk agrees to go back in time with Picard to stop Soran, they do, and we get to the pivotal scene. Kirk's death,  This was the selling point of the movie. And it's atroucious, he helps Picard defeat Soran, and then just falls with a cat walk down a ravine. Says a few words, and dies.  Yep, one of the greatest Star Trek Characters death, is reduced to a few lines. And then, they're rescued, this movie is loooooong, has way too much going on it, and it's boring. The story doesn't flow, and I'm sorry, but watching the next generation T.v show, and their movies. picard is a weak captain, evrybody else is always doing what it takes to win, where as with Kirk. He's constantly thinking, doing what it takes to win. This movie is just what ""Star Trek :The motion Picture"" was, characters that add nothing to the story. Other than the main villain, and even then his motivation was paper thin. The focus was too much on having Picard and Kirk in the same picture, that they forgot to develope a story.

I knew that meant the tapes were too old since they were homemade an not pre-recorded. I was delighted to find a set of the first six movies and this one of Generations. This was a meeting of the generations in that Captain Kirk along with Scotty and Chekov were on board the new Enterprise with its new crew until, well, you will have to watch the movie.

I was not that familiar with this crew, not being a view of Next Generation, but it was interesting to meet them, including their captain. Enter a villain and a strange object called the Nexus, a ribbon moving through space with strange powers. Whoopi Goldberg's character likened it to being wrapped up in joy. I get caught up in what happens in this movie and is quite a different atmosphere from the previous Star Trek movies.

It was truly a major disapointment at the theater, back when it first came out, and back then I had all of the aqnticipation built up for it. The Acting by Patrick Stewart at times was OK and at others was just horrible. Way over the top for the seen with Troy over the deaths of his brother and nefew. It just lost sincerity and it lacked any emotional power. THat had the oppurtunuty to be a truly great scene. The film barely made the transition, and frankly, I don't even feel that type of trandition was needed. It was an oveboard  for - the - fans type show. A few scenes with Data were ok, however bad acting krept in there to. I guess I will still feel the need to warch it from time to time, and that to is sad indeed. The fan in me wants to love this film, buy the filmlover in me wants it to be wiped out of human history. The real shame is that there was an excelent oppurtunity to capitalize on a great story, and they totaly missed it. Its like a reviever in the endvone have a winning touchdown pass bounce off of his hands. Or maybe his Face..

732804,4,6303909949,"Star Trek: Generations, the seventh film in the series of films, is a fun, if sometimes flawed film that tried to bridge the gap between the original Star Trek series of the the 1960's and the subsequent films that came along between 1979 and 1991 and ""The Next Generation"" television series that was originally broadcast between 1987 and 1994. The film begins in the era of Captain Kirk as he and two other original series actors join him to witness the dedication and launching of the U.S.S. Enterprise ""B,"" the successor ship to his ""A"" model. After some unfortunate events the audience is whisked to a time 78 years in the future and the audience is introduced to the crew of the Enterprise ""D,"" the ""Next Generation"" crew. Needless to say, a link between the events that took place at the beginning of the film and those that take place 78 years later is established in order to provide audiences with something that many had been yearning to see for a while; a meeting and collaboration between Captain Kirk and Captain Picard, commander of the most current version of the Enterprise.

The storyline is engaging and the characters that had been on the small screen make the leap to the widescreen with little problem. The producers and writers of Star Trek: The Next Generation were, after 7 seasons of production, veterans at what they were doing and were able to produce this film immediately after the end of the final season wrapped up production and release it in theaters the following fall when audiences would normally have been watching the show on their television screens. There are plot holes to be found if you analyze the movie for any sufficient period of time and perhaps a few creative decisions that should have been reconsidered (reusing stock footage to save on FX costs comes to mind on a couple of occasions, or the method by which a key character is killed off), but overall the film entertains and allows the ""torch to be passed"" from one group of actors to another.",1367107200,2,1996,4.702857142857143

The movie is all about Picard and his revenge against the Borg and the writers have him a few good scenes to work with. Of course Kirk and him team up to do in the baddie which is a bit corny but it had its moments. It almost seems like they kill off Kirk and Picard gets to bury him to also bury the old franchise (TNG got 3 more movies after this).

The movie did have some interesting points, like seeing the crew from the original Star Trek (though I watched even less of that series) and there definitely was a lot of action. However, the plot, especially at the end, just didn't seem to make sense. There were too many moments where things happened that went contrary to what should have happened according to TNG universe, and at the end I just couldn't help wondering why they went back to when they did.

It melds the original with next gen, but also does an awesome job of seeing inside the characters. I think the most poignant concept is the idea of time changing things. This is personalized by Picard, but is also a reflection of how the original Trek and the Next Gen evolve. Is time the predator that stalks us, the fire in which we burn? Is it something that makes every moment special, even though it changes everything? As an older Trekkie I found this concept important both in the series and in my own life.

If you can't make up your mind which captain you like better, Kirk or Picard, here's your chance to see them together in an adventure involving time distortions enough to explain how they got the chance to meet.

Whoopie Goldberg plays Guinan in a way that helps explain how she ended up on the Enterprise in the Next Generation. She's the one who brings the intense philosophical or perhaps religious questions to the story. Scientist Tolian Soran (Malcolm McDowell) is determined to get back to the Nexus, which Guinan describes very much as Christians describe heaven. But Dr. Soran's plan to get back there is completely selfish: he has to blow up a sun and destroy an entire solar system, and he does not hesitate. This is clearly not heaven in the sense of a reward for being a good person. Yet the compulsion of Dr. Soran and the characters that experience the Nexus (I'll not spoil it by telling you who does and who does not) raise some interesting questions concerning the nature of the typical Christian concept of heaven.

Taken all in all, a good movie but not really a great one. Certainly if I had a boxed set of the more recent movies, I'd watch it over again. Some Daddy Warbucks want to buy me the set?????",1336694400,,1321,4.593220338983051
733124,4,6303909949,"In 1994, the series finale of Star Trek The Next Generation aired on TV. That was just the beginning. Paramount Pictures worked day and night to make the feature film Star Trek Generations(1994). People claim this film was a cynical attempt to make money. People also complain about the plot holes, pacing problems, Data's corny humor, and Dennis McCarthy's music score. I thought McCarthy's music score was quite good. Malcolm McDowell plays Dr. Soran, a mad scientist who is willing to kill millions of innocent people in order to live in the heavenly Nexxus. Captain Picard(Partick Stewart) needs help from Captain James T. Kirk(William Shatner) in order to save innocent people. The producers took advantage of the film's large budget. The USS Enterprise D crashes on Veridian III during an action scene and Veridian III is destroyed in realistic detail with state of the art special effects. The novelization of the film keeps many deleted scenes. Soran tortures Geordi LaForge(LeVar Burton) with a nanoprobe and Dr. Crusher is unable to remove Data's emotion chip. There's a photo with prosthetic make up over Brent Spiner's head. Whoopi Goldberg makes an uncredited cameo as Guinan and Alan Ruck plays the captain of the USS Enterprise B. James Doohan and Walter Koenig briefly appear as Scotty and Chekhov. This film borrowed costumes and props from Star Trek Deep Space Nine as it was being filmed.
 Star Trek The Next Generation episodes were recorded in stereo. When I saw Star Trek Generations in a movie theater in 1994, it was presented in DTS Digital Surround sound. Every sound effect rocked and shook the screening room! Dennis McCarthy, who wrote countless hours of music for TV shows, wrote a good, underrated music score for Star Trek Generations.
The climax of the film was reshot after a negative, preview rough cut of the film.
There was a deleted scene where Captain Kirk skydives with 23rd Century technology. This is referenced in the Star Trek reboot.
At one time, there was a Captain Kirk action figure with his skydiving attire! Director David Carson did a good job directing the film. He also directed a really good Carrie remake for television in 2002. It was a lot better than The Rage: Carrie 2(1999). Star Trek Generations delivers in showmanship and it is a good, ""weak"" Star Trek movie.",1328227200,2,2322,4.953846153846154
733125,3,6303909949,"In November 1994, ""Star Trek Generations"" premiered only six months after the hugely successful ""Next Generation"" franchise had concluded its seventh and final season on syndicated television.  The assignment for producer Rick Berman's screenwriting team was to maximize the new film's box office success by recruiting Trek's original cast for cameo appearances.  Yet, the bigger challenge proved to be cleverly incorporating them into a mystical storyline that would feature the two captains (Kirk and Picard) teaming up to save (what else) their beloved USS Enterprise from destruction.  Sadly, the unlikely trio of William Shatner, Walter Koenig, and the late James Doohan fails to muster the necessary presence that ""Generations"" needed to appeal to old-school Trek fans -- unlike 78-year old Leonard Nimoy who single-handedly accomplished this same task in 2009 with J.J. Abrams' wildly successful Star Trek reboot.

There are some similarities between 1994 and 2009, as both of these Trek films introduced new casts to the mainstream public and gambled on nostalgia by renting at least one original cast member to add that priceless aura of credibility.  Beyond its enormous budget, Abrams' ""Star Trek"" succeeded because it completely re-launched the franchise utilizing an original and mostly coherent script bursting with adrenaline and unpredictability.  Back in 1994, on a far more modest budget, producer Rick Berman opted to merge some elements of classic Trek into the ""Next Generation"" world resulting in this moderately entertaining (yet still disappointing) mish-mash.  Suffice to say: Berman clearly should have heeded Nimoy's prior-to-filming consultation about what doesn't work in this gimmicky, high-concept script, as Spock's absence is only one of several gaping holes in ""Generations.""

I'll cut straight to the point: Berman's team almost completely blew this film with an unbelievably contrived premise.  Let's say, hypothetically, Picard's Enterprise crew instead utilizes the Guardian of Forever (an established Trek time-traveling concept) to go back eighty years and ""save"" Kirk's Enterprise crew from time-traveling terrorist Dr. Soran's scheme before he permanently disrupts established history for his own gain.  As a kicker, the aging Kirk confirms his immortality as an intergalactic icon by sacrificing himself in the finale to save both Enterprises.  To me, that would have been a film worthy of thirty million dollars to produce.  At least, it sounds better than Berman's screenwriters conjuring up a mystical time ribbon called the 'Nexus' that is sadly lacking in consistency or any vague sense of real physics.  The 'Nexus' is just a superficial plot device as a means to a convenient end (Picard meets Kirk) and nothing more, as are the destruction of the Enterprise-D, and, most definitely, the uninspired death of Captain Kirk.  The annoying Data emotion chip sub-plot also plays even worse than it sounds making me grateful for fast-forward buttons.  It struck me that the screenwriting team simply came up with a wish list of ""ain't it cool"" ideas and just strung a story around them (much like Roger Moore's lesser 007 films were really a series of stunts disguised as watchable movies) without caring about little things, like real science and originality.  Case in point: per this script, Picard and Kirk somehow can wish their way out of this 'Nexus' and go anywhere, anytime in the universe (calling this an implausible idea is an understatement).  Further, as seen in the shockingly weak prologue, the ""Next Generation""'s pretentious style of technobabble is often awful on-screen (just watch Doohan's stilted recitation early on and you'll see what I mean).

Despite a mediocre, cliche-driven script and several too-obvious CGI effects, ""Generations"" is still worth seeing.  Guest star Malcolm McDowell, as expected, scores as the nefarious Dr. Soran, as does most of the supporting ensemble (Jonathan Frakes, Marina Sirtis, Michael Dorn, and Whoopi Goldberg) in minimal screen time.  LeVar Burton also does mostly well, but he sorely undersells the fateful coolant leak conveniently precipitating the Enterprise-D's destruction.  Brent Spiner's over-acting and far too generous screen time as an emoting Data reminded me of Jim Carrey's most blatantly obnoxious film roles.  Co-star Gates McFadden, in comparison, is left with virtually no role to play as Dr. Crusher.  As for Patrick Stewart, he exudes a classy screen presence but his detached Captain Picard isn't particularly entertaining to watch.  That leaves William Shatner: his efforts seem awfully lazy as compared to Treks 2 and 6, but his hammy, coasting performance somehow meshes well enough with Stewart's ultra-serious approach.

Lastly, to its credit, ""Generations"" tries to maintain the movie franchise's tradition of exploring serious thematic concepts.  This time, the central theme revolves around how to interpret the inevitability of time itself: is it is your friend or enemy?  It is a great question, and Picard's poignant closing remarks on this topic end the film on an upbeat note.  Yet, after seeing the movie, one can't help but also get the crass vibe of how ""Generations"" has so eagerly jettisoned quality storytelling to justify its ""two captains"" concept.  ""Generations"" is ultimately entertaining and watchable enough to surpass Treks 1, 5, 9, and 10 in the Trek franchise's eleven (and counting) films.  It offers some nice moments (i.e. the introduction of Demora Sulu) for fans of either incarnation of ""Star Trek,"" but the far-too contrived script too often relies on recycled concepts (i.e. destroying the Enterprise, killing off an iconic Trek character, etc.).

Rating: 7/10 (Suitable for ages 10 and up.  Included among the DVD special features is the deleted orbital skydiving scene with Chekov, Scotty, & Kirk, as well as the original Kirk death scene).",1321315200,,5902,5.4375

733127,3,6303909949,"Unfortunately, there are a lot of things that make Star Trek: Generations a less than satisfying entree into the TNG franchise. First, the enemies, Lursa and B'etor, just aren't big-screen material. Second, Data's emotion chip - which at first was funny - upon reflection nearly destroyed his character. It's no coincidence he conveniently turns it ""off"" in all of the subsequent TNG movies. Unlike the bright sets on the TNG TV show, all of the interior shots are depressingly dark. Also, the crew seems to mix and match between the DS9 and TNG uniforms with no apparent rhyme or reason, making audiences wonder what happened to the wardrobe designer.

However, the death blow is the plot. It's clear the writers simply wanted to bring Picard and Kirk together at nearly any cost. While this might be good fan service, the story suffers. The whole ""mad scientist seeking heaven"" plot seems small for the big screen. Malcolm McDowell plays Soran well, but he's still just a mad scientist whose quest for heaven only puts one small planet at risk (incidentally, we never even get to see that planet's inhabitants). Meanwhile, when Picard and Kirk leave the Nexus, it's not clear why they choose to return to the point just before Soran launches his missile, as opposed to going back further in time and stopping the man from ever developing the missile? (or heck, Kirk could even have gone back and saved himself on the Enterprise B).

It is of course fun to see Kirk and Picard work together, but after 15 years you realize that it's not really THAT fun. I'm glad the next 3 TNG movies were better, but even so they don't really represent the best of the TV series. Overall, 2.5 stars.",1312761600,4,1685,4.727891156462585
733254,2,6303909949,"Then we have this one. Suffice it to say, I was not happy. For example:

The Death of Captain Kirk: With Kirk out of the way, no more adventures with the original crew. Even if the other characters were assembled, Kirk's absence would be painfully obvious.

The Destruction of the Enterprise-D: This was the most visible symbol of Star Trek: The Next Generation, proof that Gene could catch lightning in a bottle twice. With its destruction, the biggest example of his influence also goes up in flames.

The Destruction of Data: And let's be honest here, with that cockamamie emotion chip, the Data we all knew is dead. Data was Gene's window on humanity, his way to view it from outside and comment on it. That window has now been shattered.

The Death of Rene Picard: This is a bit more subtle, but remember the last shot in the episode ""Family"", with Rene sitting under the tree looking up at the stars? Once upon a time, that little boy was Gene Roddenberry, dreaming of sailing the stars in some sort of spaceship like an interstellar Horatio Hornblower. Killing Rene (by fire, no less!) seems to be saying ""The dream is dead, and we're now using the corpse to stoke our own fire.""

Couple this with the numerous, and oftentimes blatant, violations in the established continuity throughout the film, which I'll get into later, and you have the distinct impression that the powers that be, which in this case are frequently identified as Rick Berman and Michael Piller, with Ron Moore and Brannon Braga being identified as co-conspirators (I don't know why Jeri Taylor is generally left off the hook; maybe she's given fans a better impression than the others) really don't give a flip about what the fans feel or what their opinions are. They just expect us to be good little Trekkies and accept whatever product they put out, regardless of quality, just because it has the Star Trek name on it. For instance,

1) The Continuity Breaches: Scotty's presence on the Enterprise-B (dialogue from ""Relics"", Act I, when Jimmy Doohan looks at Riker and says,""The Enterprise? I should'a known! I bet Jim Kirk pulled her out of mothballs himself and came lookin' for me!"" pretty clearly established that Scotty knew nothing about what happened to Kirk, or anything about the Enterprise-B; all of this was known to Berman, who hoped that ""no one would notice"" Shyeah! Right!),

The appearance of the Enterprise-B (remember that sculpture in the observation lounge? That showed the Enterprise-B as a straight Excelsior class vessel)

The appearance of Data's emotion chip (in the two episodes in which we saw it, ""Brothers"" and ""Descent pt II"", it was depicted as a small c-clip, and was not functional when Data, who was about to destroy it until talked out of it by Geordi, puts it away in what looks like a watch case. When we see it in Generations, it's grown to a two-inch square contraption suspended in what appears to be some sort of magnetic field, which is generally a bad idea for computer components. Plus, instead of installing it in Data's neck, as Dr. Soong originally intended to do, Geordi installs it in his head! By the way, shouldn't one of them have notified the captain before they undertook what amounts to reprogramming the ship's operations officer?)

The performance of the Enterprise when attacked by the Duras sisters (whatever happened to backup systems? the aft torpedo tubes? rotating the shield frequencies? ejecting the core?)

In my calmer moments, I've acknowledged that if you took away the Star Trek elements from Generations, then it was a pretty good movie. Unfortunately, we can't do that. It has all those Star Trek elements, and that includes thirty years of baggage to lug along behind, and several million volunteer sherpas more than happy to point out where you screwed up in Scene 23.

Combine these, and more (I only touched on the highlights) with the credibility gaps (whoever heard of commissioning a ship that only had half her systems installed? And about that bit about how you couldn't get into the Nexus with a ship. How did Soran first get in there? In a ship. How did Kirk get in there? In a ship. It didn't matter that the ship was blasted around them, they were in the Nexus, which came across as the ultimate desperation device; just throw it up on the screen, and the only explanation of why it does what it does is that it's a temporal anomaly (an explanation that has been sliced, diced, and turned into fifty-seven different types of pretzel by various posters on AOL and BBS's across the wonderful land of ours). Even spatial rifts have to follow rules, and the Nexus violated just about every one, with the exception that it was strange. It's impossible to be a self-respecting viewer and just accept some of this stuff.) and you have thirty years of pretty consistent continuity tied up into a very ugly knot, and a very touching series finale overshadowed by a very confusing, muddled, and sometimes insulting, film.",1305504000,4,4978,4.783469150174621

733258,3,6303909949,"Picard and Kirk together again for the first time?  Malcolm McDowell as the villain?  It sounds like a dream come true for Star Trek fans.  Sadly, Star Trek Generations fails to live up to expectations and - as far as I'm concerned - should never have been made.  That's not to say that it isn't a decent movie because it is (barely).  What I object to is the somewhat desperate rewrite of Star Trek history and the cinematic death of Captain James T. Kirk.  Kirk - and William Shatner - deserved much better than this.  I think even Spock would have to shake his head and say what a ridiculous way to bid a final goodbye to the original and eternal Star Trek icon.  The film has a number of other problems, as well, the sum of which adds up to this being the silliest film in franchise history.

We start out with Kirk, Scotty, and Chekhov joining the ceremonial voyage of a new U.S.S. Enterprise in 2293.  Before the ship can return to dock, it receives a distress signal and, albeit reluctantly, rushes to the scene.  The ship is ill-equipped to deal with any problem - many of its men and materiel have yet to arrive and it has the great misfortune of being commanded by some namby-pamby no-name who shouldn't have lasted a week at Starfleet Academy.  This joker probably needs ten minutes to decide which shoe to tie first in the morning.  It's up to Kirk to save the day, as always - but at great personal cost.  Now we jump ahead seventy-eight years, where Picard and his Enterprise arrive at a solar observatory that has been attacked by Romulans.  Among the survivors is Dr. Tolian Soren (Malcolm McDowell), a man with a dangerous agenda all his own - to return to the Neverland reality of the Nexus.  Surprisingly enough, McDowell generates no sense of menace or even great importance, even when he's in the process of decimating entire worlds.  Deanna Troi should have been able to take this guy out, but it turns out that only the dream team of Picard and Kirk has any chance of stopping him.

This story's subplots don't do the film any great favors, either - especially the one involving Data and his emotion chip.  Remember how Spock kept cursing during Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home?  Now that was funny.  In Star Trek Generations, we get Data with his emotion chip installed, which turns him in to an incredibly annoying character who behaves like an immature teenager, cowers in fear like a little girl, and pretty much destroys any attempt for the viewer to take this film seriously.  If you want character development - not that it's all that important in a movie based on a series that ran for seven years - you have to look solely to Picard, who must deal with tragedy and personal regret in the performance of his duties here.  And what's up with the Enterprise?  All I'm saying is that I would certainly like to run the company in charge of making new starships.  I liked the hot Klingon chicks, and there's a nice moment involving Data at the end, but on the whole I find this to be the most forgettable of the Star Trek movies.  As far as James T. Kirk is concerned, I just pretend like this movie never happened.",1292630400,3,3139,4.472759226713532
733259,1,6303909949,"I think that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ronald-D-Moore/dp/B0036EH3UC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ronald D. Moore</a>, despite his ability as a TV writer, effectively destroyed Star Trek's potential for iconic characters and interesting stories, by subverting the entire Star Trek universe to his personal ""vision"" regarding various topics that he personally finds profound. In Generations, he contributes a screenplay that consists entirely of two extremes. Half of the plot consists of dark, gloomy tear-jerking. In the first couple of scenes, Captain Kirk gets ""killed"" during a rescue mission, and Captain Picard finds out that all of his relatives died in a fire. Even worse calamities follow later on. I really don't think that the best way to explore characters is to suddenly pillage and destroy all of their back story that had been built up for years, solely so they can then recite Moore's fairly unoriginal views on mortality.

Some of this stuff is effective. But then, it's always effective, that's why there will always be an audience for cynical Hollywood melodramas. On one hand, Patrick Stewart is a great actor, so he can turn Picard's grief into a powerful scene. On the other hand, it still feels manipulative, because Moore actually has very little to say on the subject of mortality, so it's like he's just exploiting this ready-made material as fuel for his sympathy ploy.

But, well, the movie's entire premise is a ploy. The only reason why Kirk and Picard are appearing together is because the producers didn't have enough confidence in the ability of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Next-Generation/dp/B000RZIGVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Next Generation</a>&nbsp;cast to pull in box office money by themselves. The two captains have little to say to each other. Picard can respect Kirk's accomplishments, but he doesn't know him, they're not friends -- which is crucial, since Kirk's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/friendships/dp/B00006G8HX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">friendships</a>&nbsp;were the greatest theme of the original series. In their inevitable encounter, Picard comes off as hectoring and humourless. Shatner steals every scene he's in, to his credit. Honestly, his acting ability is under-rated. But I still wish that they would have just allowed Kirk to enjoy his retirement.

The other half of the movie consists of idiotic bottom-of-the-barrel jokes. One major theme of The Next Generation was Data's quest to understand humanity, which stemmed from his own inability to feel emotions. Moore's way of ""exploring"" Data is to immediately grant him the thing he wanted for seven years, and then show a grotesque, caricatured reaction. Here too, the character's back story is used as fodder for a cheap plot device. Data waddles around with a simpering smirk on his face, giggles like a schoolgirl and talks in horrible, horrible one-liners. There's a bit where he can't help Geordi because he suddenly finds himself afraid, but this is used as a plot device and quickly resolved in the very next scene, where Picard yells at him.

The movie goes back and forth between these two settings at the drop of a hat. First there's a climactic space battle, and Riker is wracking his brain trying to think of a plan, then Data smirks at him and utters a one-liner! Then people are running down the corridor to safety, and a little girl is forced to abandon her teddy bear, which is cruelly trampled by the mob, and then Data says a bad word! Oh man.

The villain, the mad Dr. Soran, is really bland. First, he gets almost no screen time or dialogue until the very end. His most memorable line is when he comments on a ""re-MAH-kable piece of equipment,"" and that's really saying something about the screenplay. But even at the movie's climax, Soran only says a couple lines to Picard and continues tinkering with his machines. He apparently tortures Geordi in order to find out some information, but then the camera cuts to him explaining that Geordi wouldn't talk. Yet, for some reason, he seems to have the information anyway, in fact it seems like he always had the information. It's not clear why he wanted Geordi in the first place; his eventual trick with the visor seems like something he made up on the fly, rather than a careful plan. Unfortunately,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McDowell-s/dp/B000UJ48T0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McDowell's</a>&nbsp;surly, unshaven old man can't really hold an audience the way&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Khan/dp/B0000683DH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Khan</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chang/dp/B0000UJL96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chang</a>&nbsp;could. Of course, Moore additionally sabotages the character with some inept writing -- Soran actually begins a sentence with ""now if you'll excuse me"" two times in the same scene.

The visuals are also bland. The movie is very dark. The lights are turned off on the formerly spacious, shiny Enterprise-D bridge, and the camera flies between closeups of sparks flying, so you can barely see what's going on. The action is awkward -- in this movie, it's especially noticeable that the bridge conveniently stops shaking every time someone has to say a line. And it's very weird how the characters alternate between Next Generation and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deep-Space-Nine/dp/B00062RCC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deep Space Nine</a>&nbsp;uniforms, for no apparent reason, at seemingly random times. Budget cuts?

The best thing I can say about Generations is that it's not quite as bad as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nemesis/dp/B00005JLRT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nemesis</a>.

733399,4,6303909949,"My best friend is a Star Trek fan, from the original series, but she had never seen the TNG movies. I told her that was Trekkie sacrilege, and I purchased this movie on Amazon for the digital Unbox rental and we watched it together on the comp. One of my favorite aspect of Star Trek has always been the humor of it. Even in the darkest and direst situations, there was always a little humor, some punchlines, a few 'inside jokes'. Capt. Picard was too morose for me in this movie--understandably so, of course, but still. I do like the interplay between the two captains of the Enterprise, the 'then' and 'now', and the realization they aren't all that different.

As a maniacal 'drug-addict' seeks his fix (the ""Nexus""), where Guinan tells Picard that the Nexus is a place you will never want to leave, that it will change you, like it did the maniac. When Picard actually does, later, end up in the Nexus, it isn't the perfect fantasy that it was foretold to be. This isn't because Picard is so much stronger than any ordinary man either, as I'm sure it's intended to be. I mean, think about it: the villain in this show is willing to kill literally billions of people and has already killed thousands, just to return to the Nexus--Guinan talks about how she never wants to go back again, for fear of never wanting to leave.... but then, Picard and Kirk BOTH leave very easily, and the entire crew ended up in the Nexus too - but they all leave with absolutely no side effects? I maybe be missing something, since I know there were timeline issues with Picard, but how much of that was in his timeline, how much wasn't real/didn't happen when he went 'back' to before the Nexus... I guess my point is, it wasn't well done so that the confusion/questions I have made it seem plausible enough to suspend my disbelief for the sake of entertainment.

Still, I really did enjoy the interplay between the two captains. I like Kirk being more relaxed, if you will. I still love the humor--but I can honestly say that I hated the way they 'killed' Kirk the first time, even though we realize later he's not dead--after all, for 80 some-odd years or so, history deemed him dead, and that was a really cruddy and unceremoniously way to die. Sure, he saved the whole crew, but it was a really poor way for the legend to 'fade' into obscurity. And then, when he's found in the Nexus and they bring him back again, they had a chance to redeem themselves, and they went and did it to him again! Darn it all!

""It was fun!"" at least...

I still say it was a great movie, and it fit with the Star Trek empire just fine, but I do think for the first TNG movie and the only one to really bring together the 'original' and the 'new', it could have done a bit better than this is. Still well worth watching though!",1267056000,3,2797,4.383429672447013
733400,3,6303909949,"Following the succes of the Star Trek film series, Paramount greenlit another television show in 1987.  The show, Star Trek The Next Generation, was hugely popular (from the third season on).  It aired on TV for seven full seasons, and is the highest-rated Star Trek show of the five that have been produced.  A feature film was inevitable.  And three years after ""Undiscovered Country"", we got it.  ""Star Trek Generations"" is loved by some, and is considered by some to be one of the worst, if not the worst Trek movie.  I personally think the movie is okay, but I can understand the point of view of those who hate it.  It was at least better than the feature film debut of TOS, but that's not saying much.  Generations suffers from several things.  First of all, it suffers from being an odd-numbered Trek movie.  But it also suffers from the fact that it is underplotted.  The plot seems very small, and not up to film standards.  That could be because, if I'm not mistaken, all of the writers had no experience in writing movies.  All of their previous work had been in television.  The movie moves far too slowly in some scenes.  There are also many scenes which are downright disrespectful to the characters.  Chiefly, the android Data.  So with that in mind, let's get to the actual review.

The first twenty minutes or so was excellent.  Kirk, along with Chekov and Scotty, are guests onboard the Enterprise-B for it's maiden voyage.  This scene was initially written to have McCoy and Spock along with Kirk, but neither of them was interested, both feeling that they had already said their goodbyes, and the franchise should have ended.  This is evident in several scenes, such as when Chekov gets two reporters to help him doctor the wounded refugees, or when Scotty figures out how to break them free of the cloud, something Spock normally would have done back in the old days.  Anyway, the Enterprise-B gets underway, but they encounter some El-Aurian refugees who are fleeing a Borg attack on their homeworld.  The refugee ships are trapped inside some kind of cloud, or ribbon.  They enter the cloud and beam over as many of the refugees as they can, among them Guinan, the El-Aurian from the Next Generation show, and Soron, the main antagonist of the movie.  At this point, the crew of the Enterprise-B are now stuck inside the cloud themselves.  The captain of the ship is young and inexperienced.  He asks Kirk for help, and Kirk and Scotty formulate a plan to send out a some kind of pulse beam to disrupt the hold the cloud has on them.  Kirk goes down to a lower level on the ship and turns on something that helps turn on the beam.  The ship is freed, but Kirk is swept out into space.  He is then presumed dead.

At this point, the movie fast-forwards about 80 years into the future to the crew of the Enterprise-D.  They are on the holodeck, doing some kind of promotion ceremony for Worf.  Worf has to jumb up off a plank to grab a hat, for some reason.  He falls off the ship (oh, did I mention they're on a 17th/18th century ship in the middle of the ocean?) and into the cold water.  Everyone laughs, and then Data throws Doctor Beverly Crusher into the water along with Worf.  He thinks everyone will think this is also funny, but somehow, it isn't.  Data then decides to install his emotion chip in his electronic brain so that he will understand human emotion and know what to do in situations like this.  This whole subplot has no business being in the movie at all.  It serves no purpose, other than to humiliate a great character, and to fill up screen time.  It is very disrespectful to the character.  Data behaves like an idiot in this movie, laughing like a nut and making stupid jokes.

Anyway, the Enterprise finds a space station that has been attacked by Romulans.  There is one survivor, the El-Aurian Soron.  He claims to be a doctor who was conducting research.  But when Data and his friend Geordi go over to the station to look around, he attacks them and takes them hostage.  Data is unable to act, since his emotion chip has him feeling fear for the first time.  Which makes you wonder why Data was sent to the station at all, if he is acting so weird.  And why didn't Geordi and Data have an armed escort with them?  Anyway, Soron is revealed to be working with the Duras sisters, the Klingon chicks from the TV show.  This won't really mean anything if you have never seen the show, but for fans of the show, it's kind of cool how they tie off this loose end from the show.  So Soron beams over to their ship with the unconscious Geordi, and the Klingon ship escapes.  It turns out Soron had fired a missle into the sun of the system they are in, the Amargosa system, and the Enterprise escapes the resulting explosion and shock wave just in time.

Picard and Data go to the starlab (or whatever it's called) to try to figure out what Soran is up to.  In the middle of this, Data stands up and says that he wants to be shut down.  He feels terrible that he let Geordi get captured, and says that he cannot control the emotions.  Picard, who has just learned that his brother and nephew died in a fire, is also struggling with keeping his emotions under control.  He refuses Data's request, saying that Data must gain control of his emotions, and that he needs Data's help to get through this crisis.  Now, this scene is the one scene where Data's emotions are actually taken seriously, but it is just out of place here.  You shouldn't just stop the movie to talk about Data's emotions.  Especially during an exposition like this.  Picard and Data learn that Soron just wants to get back into the Nexus, a dimension where all you feel is joy.  The ribbon from the beginning of the film is a doorway to the Nexus.  The explosion in the Amargosa system pushed the ribbon off-course and towards the Veridian system.  Soron plans to destroy the Veridian star as well, because the resulting shock wave will push the ribbon right into Veridian three, where he will be waiting to be picked up.  Enterprise heads to the Veridian system to try to stop Soron.  When they get there, they find the Duras sisters on their ship, but no Soron.  He is somewhere down on the planet.  Picard gets the Duras sisters to beam him down to Soron's location so Picard can try to talk some sense into him.  They also send Geordi back to the Enterprise.  They call this a prisoner exchange, for some reason.  Picard is alone with Soron on the planet, and his crew does not know his coordinates.  Picard had his phaser and his communicator taken by the Klingons, so he has no way to contact the Enterprise or defend himself.  Now let me illustrate what just happened here.  Picard, the captain of the most powerful ship in the Federation fleet, agrees to a prisoner exchange, instead of just saying ""Send over our engineer, and send us Soron's coordinates.  If you don't, we'll blow you up.

So after this massive plot discrepancy takes place, Picard tries to talk Soron out of his destructive plan.  He cannot get at Soron, because they are separated by a force field.  Back up in space, in space, the Klingons attack the Enterprise.  The Enterprise destroys the Klingon ship, but the Klingon attack has caused a warp core breach, and they have to evacuate everyone to the saucer section.  Moments after they separate from the main part of the ship, the warp core explodes, and the shockwave causes the saucer to crashland on the planet.  Meanwhile, Picard finds a way through Picard's forcefield and tries to stop Soron.  Soron, beats the crap out of him, however, and the missle launches as planned.  I had a problem with this scene.  Picard is portrayed as a wuss in this part of the film.  There are many episodes on the show where Picard gets in fistfights and wins.  He's not the wimp that this movie makes him out to be.  What I think they should have done in this scene is have Picard win the fight, but just not have enough time to fight Soron and stop the missle.  Anyway, the Veridian star is destroyed.  The ribbon changes course and heads for Veridian three, and both Picard and Soron are drawn into the Nexus.  Moments later, the Veridian system is completely obliterated.  Picard finds himself in the Nexus, and he now has a family of his own.  He realizes however, that it is not real, and he can't stay here.  He then meets Guinan, or a reflection of her or something that makes even less sense.  She tells him that if he wants to, he can go back to any time or place in his life.  Earlier, it had been established that if you are in the Nexus, you won't care about anything but stayng there.  Yet Picard breaks that spell in about three minutes.  I guess they were saying that Picard is so morally strong that even something like the Nexus has no control over him.

Now Picard has the option to go back in time and start over at any point in his life.  He could go back and live his entire life over if he wanted to, fix any mistakes he may have made.  He could warn his family about the fire they just died in.  He could go back to when he was standing in the bar talking to Soron, when there were a bunch of security guards standing around.  Instead, he decides to go back to when Soron was beating the crap out of him.  I know many people have pointed this out before, and the problem is, if Picard had done any of the things I just mentioned, the ending would have been very anti-climactic.  What the writers should have done is have Guinan tell Picard that he can leave the nexus, but he can only go back to five minutes before he entered the nexus.  This would have given a little more of a sense of urgency to the ending, and the end sequence would have played out about the same.  Anyway, Picard asks Guinan's ghost thing to come back with him and help him, but she says she can't, that the real her is already there.  Um, okay.  Guinan then introduces Picard to James Kirk, who, it turns out, has been in the Nexus this whole time.  But from Kirk's point of view, he's only been there a few minutes himself.  Something about ""time having no meaning"" there.  Picard finds Kirk at a cabin in the woods.  A cabin we've never seen or heard of before.  And this is what makes Kirk happy.  Many people have argued that Kirk's nexus would be on the bridge of the Enterprise.  But the thing is, in this scene, Kirk acts like he regrets having devoted his life to Starfleet.  When Picard asks him to come back and help him, saying that it is his duty as a former Starfleet officer, Kirk says the following:

""I was like you once.  So blinded by duty and obligation I couldn't see past my own uniform.  And what did it get me?  An empty house.""

Kirk now wishes he hadn't been in Starfleet?  Even though he spent most of the previous movies wanting to be a starship captain?  Where did that come from?  So then Kirk goes up to his bedroom to ask some girl (who we've never seen or heard of before, why didn't they just use Carol Marcus, or someone we care about) to marry him.  When they go into the bedroom, they realize that they are now at Kirk's uncle's farm in Idaho.  So Kirk and Picard go for a ride on horses.  Kirk then realizes that all of this is not real, and it is meaningless.  He wants to make a difference with the rest of his life, not spend it here.  So he agrees to come back with Picard.  The two of them confront Soron, and after a long fight/climbing scene, Soron and his rocket are destroyed in an explosion.  Kirk falls into a gorge and dies, but is happy that he got to make a difference one more time.  Picard decides not to bring Kirk's body with him back to the Enterprise.  He buries him, and just leaves him there.  I guess it would have been hard to explain Kirk's presence to his crew.  But still, Kirk deserved better than that.  Picard comes back to the Enterprise to find that it has been damaged beyond repair.  A few ships come to pick them up, Picard and Riker have a conversation about time, Data has another emotion thing with his cat, and the movie ends.

Based on the comments I've made about the movie, you probably think I hate it.  As I said before, I think it's okay.  But it wouldn't have taken much effort to make it a whole lot better.  For instance, they could have cut out that subplot with Data's emotions.  It was very annoying and disrespectful to the character, and it took up way too much screen time.  What they could have done is had Picard go into the nexus and meet Kirk about half-way through the movie, and given Kirk much more screen time.  They could have had Kirk on the Enterprise-D for the second half of the movie, and have Kirk and Picard butting heads.  It would have been entertaining to see Kirk and his ego having to take orders from Picard.  In the end, though, Kirk would have recognized that it is Picard's place to command his ship, and backed down to him.  He would relinquish command to Picard, or pass the torch, so to speak.  That's what they wanted to do here, right?  Make a movie about TOS passing the torch to TNG?  So why isn't that what we got?  Instead, we got a long mostly decent episode of the Next Generation show.  That's okay with me, I'm a big fan of the show.  But I wanted a good movie, not another good episode.",1264809600,4,13251,4.397198187062217

733402,5,6303909949,"I am a huge fan of Star Trek in any form.  Yes, some versions are better than others, but I still believe that any Star Trek is better than no Star Trek at all.  That all being said, I really like STAR TREK-GENERATIONS, the sixth Star Trek film.  While it is not the best incarnation of Star Trek, it certainly is not the worst.  In fact, it is a good, effective passing of the torch from one, er, generation to the next.

I have seen this movie a number of times:  the first at the theatre in 1994, and most recently on tv the other night.  After all these years, STAR TREK-GENERATIONS is still exciting and entertaining, with familiar, well-loved characters, terrific special effects that hold up today, a decent, emotional plot, and fantastic actors with amazing chemistry.  Additionally, the spectacular destruction of the Enterprise Mark D continues to be one of the best crash-landings on film.  I can remember cringing and gasping in the theatre the first time I saw it, and it still makes me flinch today.

STAR TREK-GENERATIONS successfully transitions the film franchise from The Original Series to The Next Generation.  This is a film that had to be made, and it is solidly done.  It has the right kind of ""Wagon Train to the Stars"" feel that Roddenberry initiated all those years ago - full of action, adventure, moral issues, and larger than life characters.  This meeting of our two strong, beloved, yet different captains of the Enterprise is memorable and poignant, and that alone makes this film worth seeing.  If you are a Star Trek fan, then STAR TREK-GENERATIONS is not to be missed.",1260662400,2,1603,4.698924731182796
733403,2,6303909949,"This movie is so bad it's difficult to know where to begin. But let's start with the energy ribbon known as the Nexus. Kirk and later, Picard, are caught up in the Nexus and face an eternal life of bliss, only to blow it to save the universe. Okay, not the universe, but a planet of billions. The problem is, once they're in the Nexus, how do they get out? This is never answered and it could be argued that their saving the solar system was only an exercise in the Nexus and not real itself; thus, everything that happened after this movie is still part of Picard's imagination in the Nexus. So, no, Kirk was never killed and Picard never saved the real solar system at all, only the one imagined within the Nexus.

One could further argue that Picard only thought he had met Kirk and enlisted his aid, because there's no evidence that one person in the Nexus can interact with another (even Whoopi Goldberg's character, Guinan, was only an imagined ""shadow""). So Picard only thought he met Kirk and only imagined that he saved the solar system and the crew of the Enterprise. Even the next movie, FIRST CONTACT, can be seen as a Nexus creation, the real crew having perished in GENERATIONS.

Unfortunately, this movie can't provide an out for the STAR TREK (2009) movie, which completely changes the entire timeline. But what the heck. That's what happens...or doesn't happen...in science fiction.",1259539200,4,1399,4.659919028340081

733405,2,6303909949,"So one of my main issues with this film is how the story is handled.  As much as I love Malcolm McDowell as an actor, his character here seems horribly out of place and curiously convenient.

By that, I mean he seems to be more of a villain than the ""innocent doctor family man guy"" he claims to be, until the Borg killed his whole family.  He seems too prepared for evil actions, and all just to get himself into the Nexus, where he can live forever in perfection and joy.

The entire plot of the film solely involves this, and the Enterprise crew trying to stop him because of something.  I forgot why.  I think it has to do with him re-directing the Nexus in a way that it could destroy a bunch of inhabited planets.

That sort of shows you how the plot was thought out and directed.  The only real focus is on the way people remember the film: ""The one where Kirk and Picard meet""

I loved the first few minutes of the film, which show the launch of the Enterprise-B with Kirk, Chekov, and Scott aboard, and a bunch of news reporters covering its launch.  Problems abound, they take in refugees from a pack of ships destroyed by the Nexus, one of which is Guinan(!) who is a ""The Next Generation"" mainstay, and the other is Dr. Somebody whose name I don't know but is Malcolm McDowell.

In order to save the ship, Kirk sacrifices himself in some way, then gets sucked out of the airlock and into the Nexus.

Almost 80 years later, the rest of the story begins with the TNG crew and such.  Their story is mostly boring and pointless.  Data gets an ""emotion chip"" which makes him an annoying douche.  Sometimes he's funny or cute, but it's mostly annoying.  Geordi has to put up with Data's stupid, and that's kind of it.

Out of nowhere, Picard receives news that his brother or cousin or someone has died, and thus the Picard line has no heirs, because Jean-Luc is the last one left, or something, and he has no children.  So he has a breakdown, causing some minor tensions and odd command decisions.

Notice how I say things like ""or something"" or ""or someone"" or ""kind of"".  This is in no way an implication that I'm an idiot who doesn't pay attention unless there's explosions; it's an implication that the movie either doesn't really care, doesn't really show or explain it much, or that it's so poorly shown or told that I just can't honestly remember any part of a certain point.

The core of the movie was really something that should have occurred in the pilot episode, as it involved a symbolic ""passing of the torch"" to the TNG crew... the year their 7 year show ends.

So Picard ends up in the Nexus as Doctor Strangelove's plan succeeds, and he finds himself in a scene of idyllic perfection, at an olde style house during Christmas, with a wife and family and children like he always wanted.  But he's smart enough to realize it's the Nexus's bullpies, and Guinan appears to be MISS EXPOSITION! and explain how the Nexus works, and how there is no concept of straight chronology in the Nexus.  So Picard realizes James T. Kirk is alive in the Nexus, and is warped to Kirk's own ""heaven"".

And Kirk is chopping wood.

I find that important to note because it would make sense if Kirk had been living there for the past 78 years and was just doing a daily chore, but he's not.  He says he had only just arrived a few hours ago, and found his way there.  And he's chopping wood.

From there, Kirk is treated as a befuddled old man, as he notices Picard wearing a STARFLEET EMBLEM on his odd uniform, looking strikingly different from the uniform Kirk is still wearing, and he makes no mention of this.  He doesn't seem to care, and he instantly believes Picard is part of Starfleet.

Now at this point, I was still having my mind blown by the Nexus's concept of keeping people basically trapped in a time vacuum where nearly a century passes like an hour, and Kirk is sitting on the bridge of the Enterprise-B by noon, then is greeted by a man commanding the Enterprise-D at sundown, and told 78 years had passed since noon.

Instead, Kirk ignores most of what Picard is saying, and keeps talking about the cabin he's in and how it's exactly how he remembers it, and how his girlfriend is inside a room expecting breakfast, and then goes out horseback riding.

ONLY THEN does Kirk seem to finally accept the truth, and start talking to Picard instead of talking AT him, and learn about how it is now 78 years in the future in the ""real world"".  So Picard magically has Guinan warp the laws of everything, and they SOMEHOW escape the Nexus just at the moment when Picard confronts Doctor Jeckyll on the planet where he brings down the Nexus to him, and this time he and Kirk fight with the Doctor and disable his magic magnetic laser.

And then, as they call it, they dropped a bridge on Kirk.

It's not too accurate, and I imagined it as them dropping like a SUSPENSION BRIDGE on Kirk or something.  But no---Kirk is clinging to a metal bridge when it comes off, and he stays clinging to a man-sized piece like a starfish in a cage falling downhill.

THE ONLY benefit to this movie beyond eye candy or petty plot devices that would be of more benefit for the TV show is Kirk FINALLY accepting someone else in command of the Enterprise.  From The Motion Picture, Kirk nastily stole command from Decker, then smuggly kept it on as Decker conveniently disappeared.  Kirk politely took command from Spock in Wrath of Khan.  Captain Alan Ruck guy even BEGS Kirk to take command of the Enterprise-B when they run into the dangerous Nexus.

But finally at the end, Kirk ""passes the torch"" to Picard, with the line ""Who am I to argue with the captain of the Enterprise?""

What else did the film offer?  A fun prologue, some pointless and stuffy TNG character interactions, meaningless Klingon intervention that made almost no sense from the context of the Klingons supposed to be at peace with the Federation, then having a hasty, incomplete explanation that the Klingon sisters are 'renegades' of some sort flying a Warbird that is 20 years outdated.  If anything else of some importance happened, I completely forgot it, because it was just that unimportant.",1256688000,2,6166,4.485663082437276
733406,5,6303909949,"I agree with many reviewers and will say that this film doesn't have the big screen film feel like others in the series, but is that a bad thing? I always liked the movies but they felt detached from the series. This does it's best to hold the feel of the The Next Generation. It has some plot holes that could easily be remedied without all the action, but what fun would that be? The villain is sufficient even if he is a little soft. I think Kirk alone could take him but let's not dwell on that. There is a lot of action in the film and some excellent CGI for it's time. The ending is what makes this film as iconic as it is. With Spoiler alert the death of Captain Kirk. Yeah he died in the beginning but that doesn't really count does it. I would have liked to see more of Kirk in the film, but it is a TNG film not a TOS one. I didn't like at first how Kirk sort of wanted to stay in the Nexus and turn his back on people in need. This is not the James Kirk I know, but he eventually takes on the challenge. Picard is also guilty of wanting to stay in the Nexus at first which is very out of character for him as well. Let me get back to Kirk's death. His death is heroic and meaningful, yet he did not die alone like predicted in ST: V. Picard was there but in fact none of his crew was so he was alone in that sense. The scene at the end really sums up the movie well and I am overall happy with the film. Great action sequences, good music, and the return of an iconic captain make this film a must watch for original trekkies and next generation trekkies.
The DVD itself is well put together with the two disc set. The alternate ending is worth buying the special edition along with the other excellent special features. The quality of the film itself could be better now under the scrutiny of high definition. If you have a Blu Ray player upgrade to the new set it has the same special features, but with a better video transfer.",1254441600,,1941,4.057291666666667

Shatner had written a book called ""The Return""--and despite how badly his baby ST 5 was and it was AWFUL...""The Return"" is a great story about how the Borg steal Kirks' body and reanimate him to get control of Star Fleet--it would have made a great film and a much more fitting end to Kirk/Shatner;",1254268800,,758,4.382978723404255

733527,4,6303909949,"Serving as a bridge between the original cast of Star Trek's films and TOS and TNG's crew, ""Star Trek: Generations"" is a fun ride that lacks the sentimental punch most fans would hope for.  It opens with a new crew aboard the Enterprise being greeted by some of the ship's more legendary crew members (Kirk, Chekov, and Scotty).  When the incomplete ship receives a distress signal, captain and crew attempt a rescue.  What results is the loss of Kirk.

Hurtle seventy-eight years into the future.  We find Picard and company celebrating the promotion of Worf.  During the event, Picard receives bad personal news but must fight through it in order to save another ship that's eerily in the same situation as the Enterprise found itself in over seventy years before.

The Enterprise sends an away team to investigate, and they uncover Dr. Soran (Malcolm McDowell).  While still investigating the vessel, Soran demands to return to the ship in order to finish an experiment that is extremely time sensitive.

Soon enough, the Enterprise finds itself attempting to stop the destruction of a planet as a madman tries to catch a ride on the Nexus, a place of pure joy and tranquility for any who are caught up in it.

Can Picard, Riker, and the rest of the Enterprise crew save the day?  Perhaps an old hero from the past can give them a hand?  All the answers lie within ""Star Trek:  Generations.""

Albeit a somewhat hokey plot, Soran's quest to find ecstasy in the Nexus plays out very well on the screen.  Subplots involving the personal loss of Picard and Data's humorous experiences with an emotion chip were also very entertaining.  Where the film really struggles, in my opinion, is the installation of the TOS crew into the story.  I personally feel that TOS crew got a perfect farewell in ""Star Trek:  The Undiscovered Country"" and wish that they had been left alone after that film.  Dragging out the ""old guys"" one more time made ""Generations"" feel sort of cheap.  It's almost as if writers Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga (with story help from Rick Berman) didn't feel that the TNG crew could man a film on their own and needed an ""icon"" in Kirk to help boost the film overall.

Despite its weaknesses, ""Generations"" is a decent entry in the Trek universe.  The DVD itself is very good, and includes a number of wonderful extras.  My personal favorites  are the ""Crashing the Enterprise"" segment and the brilliant look into the ""Enterprise Lineage"" that includes glimpses at the real Enterprise through the ages.

733529,4,6303909949,"This movie was made in an environment that stacked the deck against it. They finished the run of The Next Generation and put this movie out in the end of that very same year. Jumping right in to a rushed production is not a good start for a movie.

Additional constraints include (but aren't limited to):
* They had to make a ""passing the torch"" movie, bridging the two movie series
* They needed to destroy the Enterprise D since it was designed for the aspect ratio and picture quality of the television format, not the big screen.
* They had a director with no prior movie experience (though he had directed episodes of the show, so he was familiar with the cast and crew)
* Sections of the script leaked out onto the then brand spanking new internet, forcing several last minute rewrites, including the infamous death scene.

Add all of that together, and it's amazing that this movie works as well as it does. It pales in comparison to the Nicholas Meyer movies, but it does have its own charm. It largely plays out like a big-screen episode of the series, but compared to the original cast's first movie, it's Shakespeare.

And lo-&-behold, I was right. The main problem with Generations is that it's a gimmick movie, nothing more, nothing less. And the sad thing is, it never had to be made. Once ST VI was done they could have just done a TNG film, no problem. When you look at the storyline there really is no reason why Kirk (with Scotty & Chekov at the beginning) needed to be included. The movie would have been no better or worse with only Picard & crew in it.

Not that the storyline in general was that great. The plot could have been an episode on the TV just as easily as a film. There was nothing special about it. The film starts off with Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov as guests upon the newest edition of the Enterprise on its maiden voyage. Of course a distress call comes in that requires the Enterprise to rescue two freighters caught in a moving ribbon across space. As you would expect Kirk becomes the hero, but in doing so he is swept out into space.

80 years later Dr Soran (played greatly by Malcolm McDowell) plans to destroy an entire solar system so that he could enter ""the Nexus"", the aforementioned ribbon in space that upon entering you experience such joy and contentment that you never want to leave. Soran had a brief taste of it and is now desperate to go back. He enlists the aid of the Duras sisters, Klingons that had a reoccurring role in TNG. The story becomes somewhat predictable with Picard & crew trying to stop Soran and the sisters at all costs.

Now here is my second issue with this movie. The TV show TNG had by this time become dependent on the ""space-time continuum"" and ""alternate reality"" plotlines. It seemed like when the writers got stuck in a plotline they pull out one of these gimmicks and ""POOF"", the crew goes back in time to correct the problem. While it was original at first it got so old and over used that it became annoying. So here we are in the film, Soran wins, the solar system is destroyed which helps him enter the Nexus, dragging along Picard, and the Enterprise crashes on the planet and then blows up, probably killing all on board.

Picard of course can't stand joy and contentment so he searches and finds Kirk who, it turns out, was sucked into the Nexus when he was swept out into space 80 years ago. And together, they return to the planet minutes prior to Soran's victory and manage to defeat and kill Soran, saving millions of lives. Just curious, what happened to the Soran that entered the Nexus? Was he dragged back out again? That seems a little unfair. Or is this some alternate dimension with a different Soran? If that is the case, where is the different Picard? How come we don't run into him?

Am I looking at this too deeply? Oh, absolutely I am! But I hate it when writers and filmmakers use gimmicks in storylines without understanding how they affect the story. This was a movie that should never have been made. It was suppose to be a bridge between the two crews and instead it was a bridge to nowhere.

And if that wasn't annoying enough, when you view the ""deleted scenes"" on disc two, they can't just show us the scenes, they have to explain them. And it's not just a brief ""here-is-the-scene-and-here-is-why-we-changed-it""; each scene had a 10 minute intro to it. Guess what people, I don't care if test audiences hated it or if your grandmother had a vision. Just shut up and show me the scene. It should not take 50 minutes to view 5 deleted scenes! Thank Heaven for fast-forward!

Unless you are a huge Star Trek fan and want to round out your collection, pass on this. It was not conceived well, the plot is strictly TV fodder, and the whole concept of the two ""generations"" meeting was weak.

Picard must go into the Nexus where he must find the legendary and so called proclaimed dead Captain Kirk to help him stop Soren's madness before it's too late.

Nicely done and well directed installment of the popular sci-fi franchise! I love how they had a few members of the original ST crew and the Next Generation crew are together in this movie. Sure fans had mixed feelings over this installment but i loved it! Whoopie Goldberg does a great uncredited apperence as Next Generation bartender Guinan, the special effects were spectacular and the storyline is very good. Some fans didn't like how Data the lovable android gets an emotion chip that makes him a happy go-lucky joker but i think it's funny, the acting is good and so is the directing. This is a very underrated installment of the series that is worth watching, this is where the old generation meets the new generation with a memorable end to Kirk and a welcome arm to Captain Picard and his crew.

It might as well been a two part eps with a bigger budget. Granted I like the movie and bought it on amazon and if you like TNG you'll like this film.",1200009600,,400,3.49438202247191
733646,3,6303909949,"First, I would just like to say that I'm not a big fan of any other Star Trek series other than the original series. I've barely watched Star Trek: The Next Generation, and knowing that this was really a Next Generation film, I really wasn't expecting to warm up to the ""new"" cast too easily. The fact is, the things that I didn't like about this film really didn't involve much of the cast. Basically, this film wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good. Simply put, it just didn't do much for me. To be honest, the whole movie just felt like an extra long, normal episode. The story, for the most part, really didn't excite me much at all, especially the whole storyline with Data and his ""Emotion Chip"" which was not amusing at all. The beginning scenes with William Shatner were descent, but by the time he returns much later in the film, its kinda too late. I didn't think Shatner and Stewart had any on screen Chemistry. I didn't think they fit well together. In a nutshell, I really don't have much more to say about this film. Its just another forgettable movie. And though, I guess the appearance of Kirk (and Scotty and Chekov in the first scenes) was supposed to be the big thing in this film, it didn't meet my expectations. As always, these Star Trek films are worth buying just to have them all at the very least, and the special features, are as always, were having. Again, this film isn't that bad, and is worth watching, but just don't expect nothing real special with this one.",1192665600,,1489,4.437956204379562

Yes, this is the legendary Star Trek that at long last teams two of the series' most enduring elements - Scotty, and a size 74 uniform. Not to mention a performance by respected British actor Malcolm McDowell that can only be described as, well, dis-un-respect-ulating. And Klingon cleavage?

I'm a bit sad to say that my faith was unfounded. This was, unfortunately, the last worthwhile moment of onscreen time for the new generation of Enterprise crew. Okay so I admit First Contact was pretty good. Still, from this movie onward, things went downhill QUICKLY!

But as for this movie, it was a wonderful blend of old and new. A literal passing of the torch as it were. Too bad TNG crew eventually dropped the torch and sent the Star Trek franchise down in flames!!",1184025600,,709,4.404580152671755
733649,4,6303909949,"I'll admit, the makers of this movie took some bad missteps, such as reusing effects footage from another film and perhaps spending a bit too little time brainstorming the film's central space battle.  HOWEVER, with that said, this movie did not deserve alot of the bad press it got.  As a rabid fan of the Next Generation on TV, I can say that stylistically, thematically and aesthetically, this film has much in common with the TV show from which it originated, which I suspect, is where it ran into trouble.  Simply put, the style of the Next Gen TV show was dissimilar to that of the more recent original series films.  Unlike the later Trek film incarnations, Generations, like the TV show, wasn't all about action, explosions and phaser rifles.  It was about cool ideas.  From the destruction of the Enterprise D, to the disastrous introduction of Data's heretofore barely referenced emotion chip, Generations seems designed to make the audience uncomfortable by employing eerie plot twists and evocative lighting.  By doing so, it achieved something profound.  It made the audience appreciate just how exposed these characters who we love are to the cold, awesome forces operating within the universe, making the viewer want to cling to them all that much more.

As the character Q once said on the TV show, ""It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.""

Like the more recent Serenity, Generations took chances, and did so with respect for its source material.",1177891200,2,1547,4.915384615384616

It also hit science fiction at its best with the Nexus utopia, shown to be pleasant but not the best.  Malcolm McDowell was a good villain, though not at Alex DeLarge (A Clockwork Orange) proportions.

The strength of each of the Star Trek incarnations is a great ensemble.  There is some heirarchy, but you still have a team feeling.  This movie does not develop either the original or the Next Generation ensembles.  The focus is only on three characters:  Captain Kirk (William Shatner), Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart), and Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), who took the mentor role in this story.  There are only short appearances from the original cast, and only enough interaction of the Next Generation cast to show they're there.

I don't think anyone could be satisfied ever with how Kirk kicked the bucket.",1164758400,2,390,4.012820512820513
733791,5,6303909949,"I watched this movie in the year 2006. It has been many years since the series ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Trek TNG"" no longer make any new episodes. In fact, the author of the series, Gene Roddenberry, has died.

That is why it was so pleasant for me to see this film. It reminded me of my favorite characters - Jean Luc Picard, Lt. Commander Data, etc.

You get to see also some characters from the original Star Trek series, such as Captain Kirk, etc.

I liked this movie, because its events happen not only in space, but also at sea and in a mountain. The most amazing event is that Data installs an emotions chip in his positronic relays. The chips gives him a sense of humor. Data smiles, laughs and does funny things like never before. His emotions and sense of humor are very cool, although he has a hard time learning to live with them, at first.

There is also a scene in the ""nexus"" - a place where nothing is real, time has no meaning, so you can go into the future, or to the past and see dead people (such as Captain Kirk). It is a very gentle, heart-warming, nostalgic moment of the movie.

Overall, I strongly recommend this movie. Sci-fi action, explosions, special effects, humor - this movie has everything!",1161561600,2,1220,4.380530973451328
733792,2,6303909949,"This ""passing of the torch"" from the Kirk generation to the Picard generation simply falls flat as a movie experience.

It's full of plot contrivances and an insane amount of technobabble (which even the commentary admits), while holding very little dramatic punch. And (again, as the commentary admits) the scenes where Picard and Kirk are together are simply not what they should have been.

Although this is not the worst Star Trek film, it's still a pretty boring movie. There are plenty of examples in this film of the kind of material that gives Star Trek a bad name. I would give an anti-recommendation to non-Trek fans (lest they think Star Trek is always like this). In fact, I can't imagine anyone but the most hardcore Trekkies even enjoying this one, despite the one or two good scenes or lines in it.",1160438400,5,813,4.71830985915493
733793,5,6303909949,"THE PLOT: In the 23rd century Kirk is presumed dead but is actually thrust into the ""Nexus,"" a mysterious dimension of perpetual bliss where time has no meaning. In the 24th century Captain Picard also enters the Nexus. He meets and convinces Kirk that they must leave their unreal paradise and go back to the 24th century to prevent Soran, a man bent on returning to the Nexus at all costs, from destroying an entire solar system and millions of lives.

ANALYSIS: Before seeing this film I heard highly contrasting reports: Some claimed it was one of the best Star Trek films while others, like Trek-spert Mark Altman, lambasted it as an incredible soporific dud. I've also heard it referred to as ""merely passable."" Well, I've seen the film about four times now and my respect grows with each viewing. I can certainly see WHY some don't like it or don't 'get' it: ""Generations"" has some (apparent) plot holes and some things aren't spelled-out or explained very well (So what? Doesn't mystery intrinsically come with the territory of space adventure?); plus the story is just plain convuluted.

Regardless, I feel ""Generations"" is ambitious, high-concept sci-fi of the highest order; it leaves the viewer with many interestng questions to ponder long afterwards. Although the Nexus has beeen criticized as a mere gimmick to get Kirk and Picard together, I find the concept utterly fascinating: No matter how much we want it, an illusory paradise is just that -- an illusion. As far as I'm concerned, the concept of the Nexus and its implementation into the storyline is nothing short of brilliant.

Besides this, there are an incredible number of highlights: The usual Trek humor, Data's amusing experiences with the emotion chip, Malcolm McDowell's outstanding performance as the mad Soran, Soran's believable obsession and justifications, B'Etor & Lursa and their ""wild bunch"" Klingons, the startling obliteration of them and their vessel, the thrilling crash-landing of the Enterprise-D, the meeting of Kirk and Picard in the Nexus, the final showdown with Soran and Kirk's death (disregarding the lame ""Oh my""). Needless to say, ""Generations"" does far more than offer mere juvenile space battles.

BIGGEST PLOT HOLE (OR MAYBE NOT): Picard's purpose in leaving the Nexus is to stop Soran from annihilating the Enerprise-D crew and the entire Veridian solar system, including the 230 million people that live on Veridian IV. Since Picard can leave the Nexus and ""go anywhere any time,"" as Guinan pointed out earlier, why go to Veridian III about A MINUTE before Soran launches his rocket? Why not go back to when Soran was a guest on the Enterprise-D and apprehend him then and there? Writer Ronald D. Moore defended Picard's decision on the grounds that he didn't want to risk the dangerous and unexpected consequences that can occur when tampering with the timeline; hence, his journey back in time from the Nexus is only a matter of a minute or so. Hmmm, it's a good explanation and I accept it.

SECOND BIGGEST PLOT HOLE: If Soran's rocket-probe is powerful enough to effect a quantum implosion of the Veridian Star, would it not cause quite a bit more damage on Veridian III when it explodes? Surely both Picard (who merely hides behind a rock outcropping) and Kirk would have been utterly obliterated along with the entire immediate surroundings of the planet?

EXPLANATION: Some have criticized the fact that Guinan is simultaneously present in the real world and in the Nexus. How could this be? It's simple: It is repeatedly established that the reality experienced in the Nexus is not real; one experiences what they desire in the Nexus, not what is real. For instance, Picard has no children in the real world, but because he DESIRED to have them he was able to experience them in the Nexus. Hence, the 'Guinan' portrayed in the Nexus may walk, talk and act precisely like Guinan, but she's not real. She's only there because Picard desires her to be there for the purpose of explaining the nature of the Nexus. Capeesh?

COMMENTARY ON THE NEXUS: Although the Nexus should simply be taken at face value as a strange space phenomenon, one can also regard it as an analogy. At first glance one might get the impression that the Nexus is a type of heaven, but this can't be so since it is repeatedly emphasized in the film that the people and events experiened in the Nexus are NOT real. 'Heaven,' a term theologians and ministers traditionally use to refer to the eternal abode of the redeemed (technically referred to as ""the new heavens and new earth"" in the bible ~ 2 Peter 3:13), is -- by contrast -- always depicted as real in the bible, not an illusory paradise. If the Nexus is not analgous of heaven, what could it be a type of? The Nexus corresponds to any addiction a person ""tastes"" and embraces to escape reality (e.g. drugs, alcohol, computer games, TV, porn, fishing, shopping, golf, etc.) Some, like Soran, are unable to flee its clutches and waste their lives and talents OBSESSED by it. Others, like Picard and Kirk, are able to see the truth and escape; they therefore ""make a difference"" in real life.

BOTTOM LINE: This ""passing-of-the-torch"" installment requires an attention span and an appreciation for high-concept sci-fi; it will bore to tears those for whom Star Trek only means neato spacecrafts and superficial space dogfights (don't get me wrong, they each have their place in Star Trek). ""Generations"" has the courage to make bold changes -- killing off a major iconic character, and fairly prominent support characters as well, not to mention destroying the Enterprise-D.

""Generations"" is science-fiction for grown-ups and youth with advanced cerebral development. All others should stick with Star Wars and ""Zathura"" (giggle).",1159920000,13,5772,4.948400412796698

The 7th film in the series. Story takes place in Year 2293 and 2371.

In the previous film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-VI-The-Undiscovered-Country-Two-Disc-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0000UJL96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek VI - The Undiscovered Country (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;(1991), we came to the final voyage of our beloved Enterprise crew that we have known for 25 years.  We would never see Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Uhara, Chekov or Sulu together again.  However, Rick Berman, Ronald D. Moore, and Brannon Braga had one more idea!
  The new Star Trek tv series, Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987-94) became such a success, when it ended on television on May 21, 1994, it was time for the Next Generation cast to continue their voyages on the movie screen (November 18, 1994), much to the dismay of the fans of the original STAR TREK cast (1966-69).
  The idea begins with a bottle of Dom Pergnon champagne, vintage 2265 (the year Kirk began with the Enterprise) christens the new NCC-1701-B Enterprise.  Captain Kirk (William Shatner) visits the bridge and is soon hounded by reporters.  Also guests aboard the bridge are Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Scotty (James Doohan).  Captain Harriman (Alan Ruck) gives the honors to Kirk to ""take us out"".
  Soon, the Enterprise receives a distress call.  The Enterprise does not have a tractor beam installed yet.  Kirk tries to sit by and let the new young captain command, but when trouble becomes to great, the captain finally asks Kirk for suggestions.  Scotty was able to save 47 of 150 people aboard the Lakul.  Safely aboard is the leader Suran (Malcolm McDowell) and Guinan (Whoopie Goldberg).  Kirk decides to go down to Deck 15 to help the Enterprise make a blast.  They have no torpedoes yet.  The Enterprise is hit.  Deck 13, 14 and 15 have been destroyed.  Scotty and Chekov finds the deck rooms and Kirk gone.
  Now it is 78 years later.  The Enterprise crew contains Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart), Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Data (Brent Spiner), LaForge (Levar Burton), Worf (Michael Dorn), Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) and Troi (Marina Sirtis).  They are responding to the Amargosa Observatory.  They beam down for survivors.  Riker and Worf find Dr. Tolian Soran (wasn't he on the Enterprise where Kirk was ""killed""?).  They also find two dead Romulans.
  Guinan who was also saved by the Enterprise 78 years ago, is now a bartender aboard Picard's ship.  Guinan explains to Picard that when she was rescued aboard the Enterprise B, she was in an energy ribbon that destroyed the Lakul.  The energy ribbon is a doorway to the Nexus.  ""It is like being in joy"".  She was beamed out of it by the Enterprise B.  So was Suran who is now a very dangerous man and is holding LaForge hostage.

  ***Spoiler Alert*** (Do not read any further)

  Later in the film, when Picard, the Enterprise crew and Saran are swept up by the energy ribbon and enter Nexus.  It is like heaven.  Picard finds another person who has just arrived in the Nexus.  It is James T. Kirk alive chopping wood for his cabin house.

733796,4,6303909949,"With the release of six mostly successful movies in a single franchise, some would wonder whether it would be best to quit when ahead, rather than pushing your luck even further with any more films.  However, Paramount Pictures and the creators of the `Star Trek' franchise felt differently, and their opinion on the matter was, as long as there are people willing to go to their films or watch their TV shows, then keep cranking them out.  There is one obviously huge problem with this philsophy in regards to the entertainment medium and trying to meet the demand of the fans, that is keeping the quality of the product high and not sacrificing good storytelling for profit.  I would have to say that overall, Paramount and the creative teams for this franchise have managed to avoid this huge pitfall, except for on a couple of occasions with the movies (the first and fifth film), and most of the TV shows have been very solid, with only a few hiccups along the way.  The trick now for the movie franchise is where to go now that the original crew has gotten too old to continue on, and the previous movie served as a proper farewell for the cast.  There were two possible avenues the powers-that-be could have chosen for this franchise; one, bring in one of the crews from one of the spin-off TV series', or two, start from scratch with an all-new cast that has never been seen.  The choice was made, and after ""Star Trek:  The Next Generation"" went off the air in 1993 (I believe that was the year), the cast went right in to the making of the 7th installment in the `Star Trek' movie franchise, ""Star Trek:  Generations"".

""Star Trek:  Generations"" begins with a few of the retired officers of the Enterprise-A, Kirk (William Shatner), Scotty (James Doohan), and Chekov (Walter Koenig), all overseeing the initial first run of the newly christened Enterprise-B.  After a smooth start events take a drastic turn for the worse as the Enterprise-B encounters two ships under attack by a strange energy ribbon, known as the Nexus.  While attempting a perilous rescue effort, the ribbon strikes the Enterprise-B and Kirk is seemingly killed in the line of duty.  Jump forward 70 years, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and the crew of the Enterprise-D rescue a mysterious physicist named Soran (Malcolm McDowell), whom unbeknownst to them, is planning a deadly rendeavous with the Nexus, that could spell destruction for the Enterprise-D and millions of lives lost.  To stop this from happening Picard must turn to a man that history believes to be dead, Captain Kirk, who instead of dying when the Nexus struck the Enterprise-B, he was merely placed inside the Nexus which is essentially an alternate reality that gives people the ability to jump back into the `real' reality at any given place in time.  With his newly found ally, Picard and Kirk must travel back into reality and stop Soran before it's too late.

The decision to join members of the original cast with that of the `Next Generation' was a somewhat bold step to make, especially when many felt that any further movies in the franchise would need to completely distance themselves from the original 6 films in order to succeed on their own merits.  Though the move seemed bold, and perhaps not the smartest of ideas, Paramount proceeded with the picture and were greeted with very strong numbers at the box office.  I personally enjoyed the film, yes there were some moments that were somewhat slow, and could have been edited down, but they did serve a purpose in terms of showing the effect the Nexus has on different people.  Even with those minor gripes of mine, the movie still is very solid, and bridges the gap in a very neat way, allowing the torch to be passed from one generation to the next.

Many `Trekkies' hated the film, not so much because of it being slow or poorly written, but because they felt that Kirk received a very crappy death scene, one not befitting of such a well-respected Captain in Starfleet.  Basically these people really need to get a life, the death scene for Kirk was just fine, I mean it was a death scene for crying out loud, he died being heroic what else did you expect!  The other major gripe `Trekkies' had for the film was that they thought the time should have been better divided between the original crew and the `Next Generation' crew.  Hello, this was supposed to be a `Next Generation' movie, of course they are going to be given the priority when it comes to the amount of time on the screen.  You people should have just been happy there were even any original series cast members even in the movie.  Most of them opted out because they didn't want to return to the characters that made them famous, at least the three that did made an effort to pay their respects to the series that made them and to pass the torch to the new crew.  Oh well, some people just can never be happy.

Though, I don't consider myself to be a `Trekkie', I am a fan of the franchise, and I didn't have a problem with the two generations being placed in the same movie, and I strongly recommend this film for any `Star Trek' fan, whether they be just a standard fan or a hardcore `Trekkie', I think both could enjoy the film equally, just don't overanalyze things as stupid as death scenes.  Yes, this movie did have a few minor problems, but nothing that should cause disappointment in the film or the direction the franchise was heading.  Definitely give the movie a chance before judging it based on the reviews of people that really need to get out more.

The movie is basically about getting the two Captains together to fight off an El Aurian Scientist who wants to live forever in the Nexus. The film is a great fun watch. Some of the minor criticisms about the movie really come down to who likes which version best. Well, as someone who thinks that There can be only one, Kirk, for me, is the only Captain, however, I can appreciate what Picard has done, but still my opinion is in favour of Kirk.
The commentary by the two writers of this movie  is interesting, but not entirely fulfilling, still, it does live up to its entertaining task, which some informative commentaries never quite achieve.
THIS DVD:  Great menus of the various options. Nicely done as well. Great Sections abound. In  THE STAR TREK UNIVERSE, the tribute is excellent, and at points very touching. The creation of the Picard Family Album is at turns interesting, at turns funny to the point of silly, but all entertaining.
The Remaining features that cover Production, Visual Effects, Scene deconstruction, and also the Deleted  Scenes, are all both entertaining as well as informative. It was informative to see the scenes that prompted the major re-shoot, and revealing to see why it was made necessary.
I now have Three Versions of this Film, Two on VHS, now this one on DVD. It is intersting to see that the cover is the best and clearest on this DVD  2 disc, and the British one has some very rare  extras, and is a numbered release which I was very happy to get. Kirk is dead, long live the Captain of the Enterprise, Captain James T Kirk !!! Hopefully the rumours that the next film will have the young Kirk and Spock acted by other actors, but voiced by the originals. Certainly Shatner does some superb voice work... check out his Audio Books.

Please note: the SCE version DOES have the Theatrical  trailers, so don't think you will miss that... it says  so on the box, and its on the disc set I have.

What makes this collectors' edition worth the time is the self-deprecating commentary track by writers Ron Moore and Brannon Braga. It turns out they are well aware of the weak points of their script and are willing to discuss them quite candidly. They look at the movie with the benefit of hindsight and offer ideas that would have made it a much better outing.

It is too bad they didn't write the movie they now talk about wanting. It could have been spectacular. As it is, this package provides a so-so movie and a first-rate collection of extras.",1136592000,4,776,4.7407407407407405
733933,4,6303909949,"Some aspects of this Trek film are exceptional!

The beginning with Kirk, Scotty and Checkov is very well done. The humor is great, and the ""retirement blues"" that Kirk is feeling is depicted very well.

The special effects are INCREDIBLE! The Enterprise B's run in with the beautifully animated ""Nexus ribbon"" is breathtaking. The crash of the Enterprise D's saucer section is the best effect sequence ever done in a Trek film.

Again, the Next Generation humor is great, although Data does get silly as a ""symptom"" of losing control of his emotion chip. But who can keep a straight face at Data gagging on a foul tasting drink, then agreeing to have ""more?""

Or the hideous klingon faces of Ursa and B'tor as they look through Geordie's visor, and while looking at the stunning Dr. Crusher, they say....

""Earth women are so REPULSIVE!""

The emotions of this film run deep. Captain Picard loses his brother and nephew, and regrets not having children.  Captain Kirk regrets not having a normal life as well, as he sets up a ""romance"" that went unfulfilled in the Nexus realm.

Soran is a convincing villian, driven by his loss of his family.

Kirk's death is both touching and reverent.

The theme of MORTALITY and REGRET in this film is very well received.

Now come the film's weaknesses...

The plot holes regarding ""The Nexus."" It's never explained well how Guinan could be both on the Enterprise and in the Nexus. It's never explained well how Picard and Kirk could LEAVE the Nexus through an act of will.

And MOST illogically, why would Picard choose to go back to the planet, right before Soran launches his missile? IF Picard could return to ""ANY PLACE, ANY TIME,"" as Guinan said, then why not go back to when Soran was a guest on his ship... before he escaped to the Klingon Bird of Prey? All he would need to do then is take Soran into custody... without some battle on rocky cliffs!

Obviously, that would make a boring conclusion to leaving the Nexus... and to the story. But it's a TERRIBLE plot hole!

If the writers could had tied up these loose ends, I would had given this film 5 stars.

It's as if they ""bit off more than they could chew.""

733934,2,6303909949,"Star Trek: Generations was filmed during one of the busiest years in Trek history. The Next Generation wrapped up its TV run, DS9 finished its second season and Voyager got underway all in the same year. It's a shame that Generations failed to live up to its full potential.

The plot and acting were substandard. Picard's melodrama over losing his brother seems forced at best, and Data's laughing at every little thing almost makes me wish he was offed in this film instead of Nemesis.

That all said, there are some good things about the film. The special effects were well done. The sound was good. The tradition of recycling decade-old sets continued nicely.

There are also a couple of interesting acting choices here. Tim Russ, who later went on to play Tuvok on Voyager, makes an appearance on the Enterprise-B as an unnamed lieutenant. Likewise, Jenette Goldstein also appears as an anonymous officer. Interesting factoid: Gene Roddenberry was very impressed with the character of Vasquez from the film Aliens, so impressed that he decided to use that character as a template for the Enterprise-D security chief when he was writing the pilot for The Next Generation. As a fan of both Aliens and Star Trek, I found Goldstein's inclusion in the cast, whether intentional or not, as a nice homage to recognizing Roddenberry's influences.

The special features, such as deleted scenes, are worth giving a once over if only to see how much worse the film could have been. Kirk gets shot in the back? What?

In previous Trek DVDs, I've enjoyed the text commentary provided by Michael and Denise Okuda. In this film, though, their text commentary overlaps the film in an LCARS panel. The text itself was informative enough, but I found the graphic to be too intrusive because it obscured a small part of the film. Previous Trek DVDs have had the Okudas' text commentary run below the actual film in letterbox format, which I found to be less intrusive into the film.

All in all, if you're a Trekkie, you may want to pick this up, if for no other reason than it's an interesting chapter in the franchise's history.",1132790400,3,2116,4.7835616438356166
733935,4,6303909949,"There's a universal rule when it comes down to Star Trek films: the best ones usually are the even ones. Many consider II(Wrath of Kahn), IV(Voyage Home) and (VI)Undiscovered Country. Well Generations is not only an odd-numbered but it's the first one to feature the Generations cast and also includes members of the original cast. It's got bad moments sure but it's also got great ones.

The Enterprise-B is about to go on its maiden voyage with Captain Kirk, Chekov and Scotty in tow. Really quickly they receive a distress call: 2 ships are caught in a weird energy ribbon. They do rescue half of the survivors but a part of the ship is damaged, the same section Kirk was in.

Flash-forward 80 years later and the Generations cast receives word that an Observatory near a star has been under attack. Found amongst the wreckage is Dr. Soran, one of the survivors from the ribbon mission. It seems he's on a plan to get inside the ribbon, which acts as a sort of heaven-like place where you're always happy. In order to do that, he destroys a couple stars which end up going supernova(science word for explode) and destroy several populated planets in the process. Helping out Captain Picard is an old legend.

Like I said, the film does have its good points. The nexus certainly looks cool(that one shot where Soran raises his hands as the ribbon is right in front of him is one of my favorite shots ever) and the stellar cartography scene is so cool and interesting. Unfortunately it's all got its lameness. The subplot involving Data's emotions is pure forced comic relief while the enemy race in the film isn't much of a threat. Plus there's what I call the seatbelt issue: they always get hit by photon torpedoes and beams and such and go flying and not decide, hmm...seatbelts?

In the end it's a Star Trek film that doesn't take place of the best ones but it's certainly good regardless.",1131321600,,1895,4.630952380952381
733936,3,6303909949,"Well, when the story begins, the Enterprise-B is being launched with Starfleet heroes, Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov. For me, it would have made more sense to have Spock and McCoy, but once Leonard Nimoy dropped out because of problems with the script, DeForest Kelley decided they had a better exit in The Undiscovered Country, and said ""If Leonard's not doing it, then I'm not doing it."" Well, anyways, these scenes set us up for the rest of the movie, which really has nothing to do with the original series cast.

On the whole, Generations seems like a drawn-out, higher budget episode of The Next Generation. However, fans familiar to the series may be surprised to see some set changes, such as added consoles on the Enterprise-D bridge, or the bright orange lighting in Ten Forward. For villains, Malcolm McDowell brings out the character of Soran, and the Duras sisters from a few episodes of TNG appear.

Anyways, I am one of the people who feel a bit more possitive about the ending (On the DVD, they show the original - not that good). Star Trek: Generations will be most appealing to Trekkers, but it is not as good an exit for the original cast as Star Trek VI.",1127520000,,1169,4.615384615384615

Still, it was worth seeing once.  And only once.  I think the problem with the Next Generation movies is the villians.  You know the protagonists by heart, but the villians are always brand new, so you don't really care about them.  It leaves the movies unbalanced.

This movie has a villian you don't care about.  He's no reason to watch the movie.  In fact, the only reason to watch the movie is to catch up on a few plot points to get from one movie to the next.  Well, the Picard and Kirk thing is okay too I guess, but not really great.

733940,4,6303909949,"One of the things that I find mystifying and annoying is the degree to which DVD commentary tracks can completely fail to reflect reality.  Listen to the commentary track on a movie like Aliens vs. Predator (a truly awful film) and you would think that they were discussing a classic, like 2001.  What is on the screen is crud, but what you hear is self-delusion.

That is why the commentary track on this Star Trek movie is so refreshing.  The two writers, Ron Moore (now the executive producer on Battlestar Galactica) and Brannon Braga, talk about this movie and are surprisingly self-critical.  So much of the movie simply does not work, and they admit it.  And they blame themselves (although they probably resisted blaming others as well).

In particular, they are critical of several key aspects of the movie.  They think that the entire Nexus plotline did not work very well and had way too many internal contradictions (""You can't think about it too much,"" one of them says at one point, ""or it falls apart."").  They really disliked the sequence where Picard goes into the Nexus and experiences a Victorian Christmas scene that is so treacly and mawkish that you want to gag (at one point one of them says something like ""Whenever you have five little kids all showing 'yea!' at the same time you know you're in trouble."").  (An aside: I was surprised that nobody considered using Picard's ""family"" from the outstanding Next Generation episode ""The Inner Light"" for his Nexus sequence.  That would have added a powerful emotional depth to the story.)  And they thought that they made a mistake by not having Picard and Kirk clash with each other.  (According to Moore and Braga, both men got along extremely well on set, however.)

They also completely disliked the ending, where Captain Kirk dies.  This ending was re-filmed because the original had Kirk getting shot in the back and dying unceremoniously.  But the final version that they ended up with is similarly unsatisfying.  A friend of mine, who ended up working on Star Trek Enterprise, once said to me that he too thought it was lame: ""Kirk dies reaching for the remote,"" he said.  Moore and Braga said that they wanted an ending that was not cliched, that did not have what everybody expected, which was Kirk dying on the bridge of a starship.  But watching the movie again, they realized that that is EXACTLY what they should have done--they should have gone for the heroic ending of a hero.  Instead, we're all left unfulfilled.  If they had used ""The Inner Light"" for Picard's Nexus sequence, and had a more heroic death for Captain Kirk, this would have been a much better film.  Otherwise, it is largely forgettable.

One surprise for me was their casual way of destroying the Enterprise.  They resurrected this idea from a rejected TV episode after getting the idea out of a Trek technical manual.  They just thought that it would be ""neat.""  The fact that it served no real purpose in the story, and had no emotional resonance, is a major disappointment.  It proves that Moore and Braga lacked the reverence for the Trek universe that was needed.

Both men note--and they are exactly right--that William Shatner nearly stole every scene he shared with Patrick Stewart.  He demonstrated an enthusiasm for the role that really shone through.  It proves that for all the criticism of his abilities, Shatner can certainly act.

The overall technical quality of this 2-disk set is excellent.  The extras are also pretty good.  The deleted scenes are fascinating for the simple fact that they are all so bad.  Groan-inducingly bad.  I've already mentioned the original ending (brave Captain Kirk gets shot in the back).  But the original opening, with Kirk skydiving from orbit, was also badly fimed, edited, acted and written, and we are lucky it did not make it into the movie.

The tribute to Matt Jeffries, who designed the original series ship and sets, was nice, but is the kind of thing that belongs on a different DVD (such as the TV series collections). The graphic designers who worked on the later shows comment about Jeffries' work and some of them explain why it was so good--Jeffries strove for a bold, distinctive look using relatively simple lines.  As one person notes, Jeffries knew that the ship had to be recognizeable as it zoomed across the screen, so he gave it large, distinctive elements.

The short on filming the special effects was also interesting, although it left me wanting more.  One surprising revelation was that the cameras often damage the models during close passes, requiring constant touch-up.  Unfortunately, nobody mentioned that the visual designers felt that the TV series ship was the wrong shape for the more rectangular movie screen, and whether or not this influenced the writers' decision to destroy the ship.  (It does explain the fact that the later Enterprise is much longer than the TV series version--so it fills up more of the movie screen.)  I wished there had been more footage of the modified Enterprise 1701-B and the spacedock.

Star Trek Generations was not a good movie, but this is a pretty good DVD collection that can be enjoyed for what it is.",1115942400,12,5181,4.832009080590239
733941,3,6303909949,"I recently went back and watched Star Trek Generations on this special collector's edition. The film was a lot more entertaining that I had remembered but it is not without its flaws.

The movie was made to bring together the two captains and to kill off our beloved Captain Kirk. It opens with a fast paced and action packed sequence where Kirk is killed saving the newest Enterprise while on a short cruise. We are then introduced to the Next Generation through a fun but somewhat contrived holodeck scene. Picard receives disturbing news and makes him reflect on his life, Data experiments with an emotion chip and a madman is destroying stars for a selfish purpose.

When you add all of this together, we have a very entertaining and at times a visually stunning movie. The movie moves along at a brisk pace and we are never once bored. The special effects, especially the crash scene, are very good and the theme of time is very well done.

Despite being entertained, I found the movie to be very uneven. While I was amused at Data's trials of experiencing emotions, the subplot felt very out of place. The ""echo"" of Guinan seemed a little too convenient and when we get the two captains together, we just get a long fist fight. It made the entire ""two captains, one destiny"" concept feel a little empty.

The DVD transfer is very good. The colors were crisp and the picture quality was superior. The extras while plentiful were kind of bland. Most of the extras deal with the location of the planet where a 1/4 of the movie takes place and it just isn't very interesting. The crash segment was covered but it was much too limited to one part of the filming and not the entire sequence itself. And the deleted scenes are not interesting at all, mainly due to being VERY rough cuts.

I have actually increased my rating for Generations because it is entertaining and rates way above Star Trek V and the abysmal continuity killing Nemesis. It is a film that is more about time and how it stalks us and reminds us to seize the moment and on that level is succeeds.",1115596800,2,2066,4.528150134048257
733999,4,6303909949,"This may not be the best Star Trek film, but, having just watched it again after some-odd years, I found it to be mostly quite enjoyable. It's maligned reputation did make me keep an eye out for ""faults."" While I found things that were less than, shall I say, stellar, I was pleased with how much of it I actually liked.

The acting, in general, is effective to good. It is true that not very many of the actors actually get a chance to act, but the ones that do (Picard, Data, Kirk, Soren) are good at what they are asked to do.  Patrick Stewart is certainly up to the task. I did like Malcolm MacDowell's personality as the villian. He isn't a caricature of evil for evil's sake; rather, there is a psychology at work in him. If we never really get in depth with it, well, we can still see it on Soren's face.

I liked the use of the Klingons. It's nice and familiar to use the Duras sisters, and it also completes their stories. Their glee at the prospect of destroying the Enterprise is perfect considering the history. The space battle itself is highly effective, but I will have to say that one of the weaknesses was the arbitrary destruction of the saucer section of the Enterprise.

The plot with the Nexus, while certainly unlikely at parts, is at least an interesting idea. The threat created by Soren's explosives is a palpable one that warrants the attention of the Enterprise. Just as palpable is Picard's personal loss, which is effecive for those of us who remember the episode ""Family"" as one of the best.

I don't really care for Data's storyline. His appeal has always been his struggle to understand aspects of humanity, particularly emotions. The chip seems a shortcut, the script turns him into a punchline, and all of a sudden I see Brent Spiner the broadway singer singing ""Lifeforms"" instead of Data. His ""Oh, s--t!"", ""YESSSSSS!"" and ""I get it!"" one-liners are all regrettable. It's only slightly placating that Geordi seems as annoyed as I was.

Sometimes I hear that viewers wish that more of the primary cast were given something to do. I would say that, both on TV and on film, that no cast has ever been given complete consideration in a single plotline, at least very rarely. How much attention did Uhura, Sulu, Scotty, and Chekhov really get in the first 6 films? Overall, very little compared with the big three. Well, ST:TNG is truly the Patrick Stewart/Brint Spiner show. Anyone who hasn't figured that out hasn't been paying attention. I don't see anything wrong with this film being particularly Picard's story.

Actually, it's also Kirk's story, isn't it. I am not really an obsessed sort of Trekkie, but I love historical relevance. I think the original cast has stood the test of time and deserves a lot of respect. I love the opening montage. Plotwise, I don't miss Spock, McCoy, Uhura, and Sulu. It seems reasonable to me that the entire crew wouldn't necessarily be available for this little jaunt. Kirk, Chekhov, and Scotty are great together.

Shatner gets less credit than he deserves as an actor, but watch his restlessness on the bridge while things are going to hell, and then watch how relaxed yet alert Kirk is in when he takes command. Perfect. His scenes with Stewart are quite good, suffering only from some repetitive writing. And it is a distinction of their characters that the kinetic Kirk beats up Soren after the philosophical Picard is pugilised.

This movie may not be for the jaundiced. Heck, probably none of Star Trek is. It may not be the most powerful, cohesive, or logical ST movie produced. It certanly doesn't look the best. But, while it may not advance the ST universe in any significant way, it has much that is worthy for entertainment.",1111363200,2,3709,4.659021406727828
734000,3,6303909949,"This film is O.K.It marks William Shatners' last appearance as Capt. James Tiberious Kirk. While its kind of slow moving,there are some great one liners such as Data saying ""Oh,s___t!!""and the scene in Ten Foreward. Malcom McDowel is great as Dr. Soran. The special effects are first rate as usual. All in all,a decent entry in the Star Trek movie list.",1110499200,,353,4.80327868852459
734001,4,6303909949,"It is a truism universally accepted in the Star Trek Universe that the odd-numbered films are inferior to the even numbered films.  Wrath of Khan, Voyage Home, etc. are obviously superior to Search For Spock, Insurrection, et al.  And although, objectively, Generations is inferior to the films immediately before and after it (First Contact and Undiscovered Country), I can't help but feel an irrational affection for it.  Despite the scientific gaffs, despite the ending that just doesn't work, there is just something about the film that I like.

So, the problems with the film are easy to enumerate.  Most serious is the entire last act, where Picard and Kirk team up to defeat the villain.  There is no scene that doesn't work on its own, but the sum of the scenes is a bit silly and not heroic - not worthy of even one captain of the Enterprise, let alone two!  Close behind is the seriously silly physics of the star-destroying weapon.  At one point, we are led to believe that a planet is 8 light seconds (or less!) from it's primary, as opposed to the 8 light minutes distance that Earth is from the sun.

And yet, there are so many good parts that I'm willing to forgive the bad.  The entire opening act, with Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov aboard the Enterprise-B is fantastic.  Kirk's ""death"" on that ship is very dramatic and extremely effective.  Data's struggle with his emotion chip is surprisingly effective, especially when Picard resorts to bullying him like he would a green midshipman.  We get to see two of the greatest Next Generation villains - Lursa and Betor.  And the end-battle is the best ST space battle since Kirk led Khan into the Mutara Nebula (narrowly edging Spock and McCoy performing ""surgery"" on a torpedo in ST VI).

Like the other special edition DVD's in the Star Trek series, this one is packed full of fun and interesting tidbits.  The text commentary by the Okudas (writers of the ST encyclopedia) has a fancy new graphic that is both harder to read and more obtrusive - ARGH!  Why do they overdesign something just to make it worse?!  The audio commentary by the scriptwriters is quite interesting (my brother considers it the best of the Trek commentaries, but I still like Shatner and Nimoy together in ST IV).  There are lots of making-of featurettes.  Unfortunately, this late into the special editions, there is some repetition and it's not as interesting as previous commentaries.  However, it does contain the all-important (to Trekkies) original cuts of the Nexus scenes and the climax scenes, both of which are legendary (as having to be significantly re-filmed) in Trek lore.  That the new ending is far superior to the original ending is evident, and somewhat alarming considering how disappointing the final ending is!  All-in-all, a good DVD edition of a movie that is, to me, unfairly maligned.",1108252800,2,2847,4.824742268041237
734002,1,6303909949,"I'll keep this short and to the point.  This film does more to destroy the franchise that bolster it.

It destroys the uniqueness of Data by giving him emotions.  So now he ends up being like everyone else on the ship. OK, so he's an android, and he has yellow eyes.  But that wasn't what differentiated him.  One TNG icon bites the dust  (The fact that the ""emotion"" chip is destroyed in later episodes is a testament that the idea to give Data emotions was ill conceived.)

Then they destroy the ""D"".  I'm sorry, but in the real world, anyone who was a bridge officer on the flagship of the fleet when it met its fate would never, ever, ever be given a command position again.  And Piccard and Riker both would be facing investigation and court martial.  Especially if it was destroyed in the way that ""D"" met it's demise.  The reaction of Piccard when he finds that the ""D"" is a pile of scrap is insane.  He basically blows it off and says ""Ah, what the heck, they'll build more."" Gotta tell ya, if it were my bridge, my first officer would not leave the scrap pile in one piece.

The real killer here is that the destruction added absolutely nothing to the storyline, and was done simply becasue the writers and modelers wanted to go to something new in terms of a ship.  Personally, everything they've come up with since has been a real yawn.

OK, so two icons of TNG are destroyed.  I guess I could live with that if the story was any good.  But it wasn't.  True, Stewart is a tremendous actor and does a heroic job with the incredibly bad lines he's given, but its just not enough.

With so many opportunities for a really good story, this attempt is a dismal failure, and a huge disappointment.",1107129600,11,1702,4.3630573248407645

It does not appear to be repackaged but on the inside of the front flap their was no insert like all my of ST Collector's Editions in the past.  Has anyone else had this problem?

734004,2,6303909949,"At last, the once and future captains of the starship Enterprise meet.  The result?  So what?

This first screening of the ""The Next Generation"" crew of Trek highlights everything that made that show such a snorer - generic characters and plots, talky scenes, technobabble, philosophy stitched onto a threadbare plot.  ""Generations"" might have made an above-average episode of TNG, perhaps the penultimate episode, and a good lead-in for the finale, ""All good things"".

The Plot: ST:G begins in the waning days of Admiral Kirk's career.  Along with Chekhov and Scotty, Kirk is feted at the launch of the newest incarnation of the starship Enterprise when disaster strikes.  Responding to a distress call from two ships caught in a cosmic storm, the Enterprise-B is nearly trapped and destroyed as well.  One of the survivors is Dr. Soran (McDowell), a scientist with more than a coincidental connection to the mysterious storm.  In the ensuing firestorm that lashes his ship, Kirk disappears, and is believed dead.  Nearly a century later, the crew of the Enterprise-D crosses paths with the same Dr. Soran, hard at work on a weapon that causes stars to collapse.  Though this would give Soran immense power (a fact not lost on a crew of Klingons interested in acquiring the weapon), it's only a means for him to something bigger - control of the firestorm seen at the beginning of the movie.  Not simply a cosmic storm, it's the gateway to an alternate dimension whose inhabitants can experience their happiest dreams.  To steer the storm in a direction he seeks, Soran must detour it through a heavily populated star system, endangering the lives of millions.  A first attempt to defeat Soran ends in disaster - the Enterprise is destroyed, its crew annihilated, and the storm steered towards that imperiled system.  Only by leaping into the Nexus does Picard survive.  At first enraptured by the sybaritic existence within the Nexus, Picard remembers his duty and enlists the only other denizen of that elysian dimension who can help him back in our universe: Captain Kirk.

Average special effects (with some effects just recycled from other Trek movies) and an undistinguished script, ST:G never gets past being a TNG episode designed solely to write Kirk into a story.  The Nexus never gets past being a convenient device to return Kirk, and absorb Soran, and most of the story is just talk.  Why Soran needs to cause such havoc to reunite with the Nexus is never really explained, and the meaningless of time within the Nexus only robs the story of the critical ""countdown"" phase.  The Nexus itself was probably a nifty idea for sci-fantasy, but is totally ineffective for dramatic purposes - another example of TNG Trek that aspires to brilliance without ever being all that smart.  If you want a more effective TNG movie, I'd suggest ""First Contact"".",1105401600,3,2859,4.964285714285714

As for ""uniting"" the two ENTERPRISE crews, it of course failed because Spock and some others declined to take part. Moreover, the first crew gave its farewell in The Undiscovered Country and the Enterprise-D crew would fare just fine on its own in First Contact (with the sleeker if smaller Enterprise-E). Also, McCoy, Spock, and Scott (who for some reason did not sit out that token cameo role) already made appearances in one television series episode (Encounter at Farpoint I, Unification II, Relics).

This new release of Generations,like the original crew set,comes in two discs,loaded with extras and in its' glorious widescreen format.
Generations,in case you didn't know by now,is a transitional movie. That is the Trek ""torch"" gets passed from the original crew onto the ""Next Generation"" from the TV series of the same name.
As I'm NOT a big Next Gen fan my perspective comes from being a fan of the original series and its' crew and this movie didn't disappoint. The movie while a very good Trek movie in plot structure and acting shines best when (and my bias may be showing just a little here) the original crew is on the screen. The opening of the movie is as exciting as any movie gets with Kirks' death/disappearance. When next we meet Kirk he and Picard have joined forces to defeat a common foe and to me William Shatner totally steals the show away from Patrick Stewart in their scenes together. And I STILL have trouble ""keeping it together"" when Capt. Kirk dies.
But it is not only just Kirks' death that bothers me but what it signifies;the end of a long and wondrous journey with the original crew characters from TV to the movies and in reality going from a cancelled TV show and its'struggle and success on finally getting to movies..... and seven at that! A very poignant moment indeed.
So,if you're an original series fan like me and want the perfect companion piece to all of the original crew movies then this two disc special re-release is for you.",1103500800,4,1699,4.6105610561056105
734007,4,6303909949,"""Generations"" is the seventh Star Trek film, and hit the movie screens in 1994. It was the first in the series of movies to feature the crew of the Next Generation (led by Captain Picard) and the last to feature any of the crew from the original series (led by Captain Kirk). The previous film, ""The Undiscovered Country"", focused on the last mission undertaken by Kirk and his crew.

The film opens in 2293, at the launch of the Enterprise-B. Commanded by Captain John Harriman, the helm officer is Demora Sulu - the daughter of Kirk's former helmsman, Hikaru Sulu. Since the ship's maiden flight is scheduled to be little ore than a brief trip to Pluto and back, it hasn't yet been fully equipped and doesn't have a full crew. All the same, Starfleet has invited the press and three 'living legends' for the occasion : Captain James T. Kirk, Captain Montgomery Scott and Commander Pavel Chelov. The short trip, however, is interrupted by a distress call from two refugee transports fleeing the El-Aurian homeworld - recently assimilated by the Borg. There is no option but for the under-equipped Enterprise to respond. Some of the refugees are rescued - the rescue, however, is not without its price. Among the surviving refugees are Dr. Tolian Soran, a scientist, and Guinan (later, a friend of Jean-Luc Picard's and barkeep on the Enterprise-D). Guinan reveals the energy strip to be an entrance to a place called the Nexus, a separate continuum where reality is based on the individual's desires.

Seventy-eight years later, Jean-Luc Picard's Enterprise receives and responds to a distress call form the Amargosa Observatory. The Observatory was apparently attacked by the Romulans - who, ot would seem, were attempting to retrieve some stolen trilithium. Once again, Soran is amongst the survivors. It appears he has been working on a way to return to the Nexus since Harriman's Enterprise 'rescued' him from it. His plan to return there, however, would result in the deaths of milions, and would also put a deadly weapon into the hands of his allies, Lursa and B'Etor. The sisters of the treacherous Klingon, Duras, would certainly use it to destabilise the Klingon Empire and end the alliance with the Federation.

It has been said that, while the even-numbered Trek movies tend to be excellent, the odd-numbered ones tend to be poor. As the seventh movie, the rule states that ""Generations"" sits in the ""bad"" pile. Admittedly, it does have the occasional corny moment - but it does have a great deal going for it also. Kirk's itchiness on the Enterprise-B and the teasing his former colleagues give him is quite funny. It's always enjoyable seeing Klingons (in this case, Lursa and B'Etor) playing politics and / or starting a fight - providing some impressively explosive moments.",1099440000,6,2790,4.931914893617021
734008,3,6303909949,"Well, let me add my two cents...

The movie, as mentioned by so many others, is a contrived plot to link the two series.  But, I had heard that the studio did not meet Nemoy's demands for story changes and thus lost the chance to really make it a meaningful link with all the main TOS characters.  Nemoy might have even directed?  Now THAT would have been inspired.  Oh well.  Spock and Bones NOT in the story already dooms the plot.  Plus all those silly holes... all right it is Science Fiction.  But, why did Soren get pulled back from the Nexus when Kirk and Picard came back from the Nexus?  Why didn't Kirk and Picard just go back to when Soren was found on the observatory and arrest him then?  If Kirk was in the Nexus 80 years before Picard showed up, why is he only just cooking those eggs?  Also, when the Nexus ribbon had hit the planet, did the crew on the crashed Enterprise get sucked in too?  Why not show us this?  And, with all these folks crowding in the Nexus, why is it only Guinin who appears to Picard?  One other point, all through the Next Generation TV show, there is this brooding romantic spark between Picard and Dr. Crusher.  If that was so, why is Picard's Nexus family (and especially his Nexus wife) such old fuddy-duddy farts?  (""Oh paPAH, I just love the dolly!"")

OK, besides all this, we have some excellent acting by Brent Spiner and Patrick Stewart.  PS's scenes when he is struggling to deal with the death of his brother and nephew are wrenching and so understated.  He is a gem.  BS's comic manic emotion-chip stuff is priceless.  Unfortunately, William Shatner scenes are also understated.  After all these years, he decides to listen to all his critics and tones it down?  Wrong move, we expect him to be over the top.  The much-hated rusty bolts close-ups and the rather uninspired death of Kirk is a downer.  I am surprised Shatner didn't stamp his foot and say NO!

The extra features have this thrown-together, the-fans-will-buy-anything feel to them.  Do we really need to see that piece about the knives?  I am sure Paramount has extra stuff for TNG fans to drool over, but they are sadly lacking.  Besides, extras with no-trailers is a rip-off.  Did they even bother to mention Tuvok as a human on the bridge of the Enterprise-B?

But as a Trek fan, I too, like cattle, ran to buy this DVD and will problably buy all the rest as they come out.  But, hopefully Paramount will treat us with the proper respect and give us something really special for our money next time.",1097539200,5,2520,4.4823788546255505
734115,4,6303909949,"As a theatrical movie, ""Star Trek Generations"" fails - it feels more like a long TV episode - mostly due to the re-appearance of the Duras sisters.  This was, quite possibly, the worst aspect of this film.  They're fun characters, but their presence, let alone villainy, is hardly on the same level as General Chang (Star Trek VI).

The commentary and special features also point out tha some dr Sorin/Geordi torture scenes were cut.  This is a shame as this would have added much a needed sense of ""We hate your guts"" to Sorin, who is more or less a character we'd much rather give our pity to because of his plight!

Guinan is also awkwardly handled.  Remember, her and the El Aurians' had escaped the Borg.  Just how far were they travelling before the Federation found them, on their doorstop no less?  (I'm assuming an earlier (unseen) hailing had the El Aurians told Starfleet who they were, as it makes no sense for Starfleet to otherwise know what species this is.)  Anyway, Guinan says it's impossible to get back into the nexus and that she has to live with it and Sorin must be convinced of it.  But in the same scene she says that to Picard, she also says ""If you go in, you won't want to leave"" - so we now know Picard will be going on.

In short, the plot is a mess and the revised ending gives Shatner to deliver a nice speech at the end.  (Fortunately, we get to see the original ending, which is good as the original ending is far more dramatic, and ironic.)

And why aren't the trailers included?!  Couldn't Paramount have waited an extra week or two for the clearances to be approved?  Given the amount of 'deleted scenes' material, it seems goofy that a trailer couldn't be cleared.

And I recall a few differences between the home video/dvd/laserdisc releases over the theatrical release.  Mostly in the form of an extended crash sequence, and a better camera angle when the red- oops, yellow-shirt guy gets blown over Worf's console, who I then suspect made the shirt red.  (the angle was originally a consistent slow-mo with Troi being consistently visible on the lower right.  The home video ed sees a different angle of the guy being thrown back, which then turns to Troi bouncing back.)

This movie, while awkwardly written, has a few plusses that kicks my rating up a notch:

As the Enterprise D sets (barring the corridors which were taken from the Kirk-era films) were made for the small screen, the producers darkened the lighting.  The resulting look was AWESOME and (unintentionally?) added a lot of atmosphere to the film, as well as making it look distinctive and, well, COOL!  (Unfortunately, 'First Contact' sees the usual brightly lit sets once again - but that's the least of that flick's problems).

I love how it deals with mortality.  Indeed, as I said before, the original Kirk death sequence does not exactly detract from this movie (though I will admit, SOME of the changes for the final confrontation were welcomed.)  Seeing a personal side to Picard was a nice touch, and well acted by Patrick Stewart.

Of course, the crash sequence is still wonderful to watch.  While not the first sci-fi venue to show a ship crash as such (Blake's 7 had), Generations executed the effects considerably better.

The commentary.  This is a MUST-LISTEN-TO.  The producers say a lot about what they felt they did wrong.  While a bit too kissy-up to Shatner during his scenes, there wasn't much in the commentary I didn't like, and some of it was eye-opening (including a differnt idea for the season 6 finale...)

The extras.  There's a lot of extras on this release.  The crash sequence deconstructed, a doco on effects, a great tribute to Matt Jeffries, the original Kirk death scene, the film shot for the original opening credits idea...  All great stuff.

Now onto DVD quality:

Sound:  Dolby 5.1 and DTS sound ROCK THE HOUSE.  Especially DTS.  In terms of audio, this is a great release.

Menus:  I thought Trek VI had a great menu system, but Generations takes the cake.  Well designed and fun to navigate.

Video:  Uh-oh.  Now I had seen the extras first.  Some of the film was damaged and there was a lot of dirt and dust.  I thought 'well, these are extras so I won't whine'.  Then I watched the movie.  Atypical for these releases, there's a LOT of dust and other print flaws visible.  Worse, infinitely worse, is that Paramount must have used edge enhancement while 'restoring' the film.  In the Veridian 3 scenes with Sorin, the edge enhancement halo artifacting is very visible and very irritating.  Video here is a disappointment.  Indeed, if I could mix my laserdisc's cleaner/less-jagged video with the DVD's sound, I'd be all smiles.  Though, as far as DVDs go, I couldn't see too much in the way of compression artifacting.

It's worth getting for the extras and because the movie actually tries to be deeper, but don't expect the best video quality.",1097366400,16,4898,4.683098591549296

This is not the best of the Star Trek films.  I gave it four stars because despite this, the film is still quite charming and entertaining.  The two Star Trek series' are blended in really well, and it introduces depth in the Next Generation characters that wasn't there in the TV show.

The review is about the ""what's in the box""....

Days ago I got an email from Amazon saying they were sorry but could not deliver the DVD on the promised date, bla bla. 2 days later, I got another email saying they shipped it.

Yeah, I've got it and it has the same image quality as the previous release (1 disc). It is missing the foil with the chapter guide (you can use the one from the other edition).
Although the movie is 10 years old and was filmed on normal equipment, it does show some age on the image quality. Paramount should have cleaned it before the new release.

The menu is new, animated with the Enterprise B on the first disk. It has some extras on the second disk, like deleted scenes, alternative ending (Kirk's death) which I found interesting to watch. It has some features also on the special effects, like the crash sequence and filming the Enterprise - most of it was not CGI.

Besides the missing trailers - it is mentioned on the cover, but not available on either disks, one good suprise was to find that this version has also Dolby DTS track.

Overall, it is worthwhile, for the extras and DTS. And it costed much less than the first version.

Nevertheless, Paramount deserves a negative feedback for taking advantage of us for using such strategy: release barebones first and special editions later: this is pissing a lot of customers, specially the ones that bought the Original Series for much higher cost in many volumes.

Ever since I was a kid, Kirk has been a real hero - a larger then life character who, although flawed, could always rise above his situation and win.  This time, although he helps Picard win, he has given the ultimate sacrifice - his very life.

It is the way Kirk would - and had to - go.

As he pointed out to Picard, he had been 'saving the galaxy while you're grandfather was still in diapers'.  And save it yet again he does, tragically for the last time.

As for why I didn't care much for the film: it took continuity and basically chucked it out the window.  In this film, Scotty saw Kirk die at the Nexus, yet just 2 years earlier, in one of the episodes, Scotty was brought out of transporter hibernation after 78 years, completely unaware of Kirk's death.  Also the Klingon sisters should not have been able to so clearly seen through Geordi's VISOR; a first season episode established, that his VISOR showed him a full optic spectrum that looked like a jumble of colors to someone not used to looking through it.  I also didn't feel Data's motivation for finally wanting his emotion chip was strong enough--they made far too much of his pushing Dr. Crusher overboard; it *was* funny.

I also believe that they could have come up with a better storyline, one that could better involve both crews, one that would have kept if from my dubbing it ""The Captains and Data"", one that actors such as Leonard Nimoy and George Takei would have welcomed the chance to appear in, instead of turning it down as they did.

Perhaps if they had not been in such a rush to start the film as soon as production of the series wrapped, they might have come up with a better film.

Kirk (William Shatner) along with former crewmates Scotty (James Doohan) and Checkov (Walter Koenig) are along on the ride for the launch of the newly commissioned Enterprise-B. When two ships signal that they need help, the Enterprise-B, despite the fact that it hasn't been outfitted with the rudimentary defense mechanisms, is ordered to help the two troubled passenger ships. New Captain John Harriman (Alan Ruck) reluctantly zooms to their aid. With news cameras from every network on Earth covering the launch of the ship, Kirk feels compelled to step in and help the inexperienced crew save the lives on the ships in distress. Unfortunately, Kirk appears to be killed in the process.

About 80 years later the crew of the USS Enterprise is celebrating the promotion of Lt. Commander Worf on the holodeck, Captain Jean Luc-Picard receives some disturbing news during the celebration; his nephew, brother and sister-in-law have been killed in a fire. The celebration is cut short when the Enterprise is ordered to help a research station under fire from Romulans. As the ship arrives, they discover everyone on the research vessel dead except Dr. Tolian Soren (Malcolm McDowell). It turns out that he is the cause of the attack and he's develop a dangerous new weapon that can cause a sun to go nova within minutes. He plans on using it to somehow harness the power of something called the Nexus ribbon. It appears that people that enter this ribbon that travels through space can relive the past and visit with loved ones long dead. Picard must stop Soren or millions of innocent lives will be sacrificed in the process. Unfortunately, he fails and both he and Soren are sucked into the Nexus. While in there Picard meets a most unexpected ally Captain James T. Kirk who it appears is very much alive. Picard must convince Kirk to help him stop Soren as he's cut off from his ship and crew.

Although it was much maligned by the press when it was first released ""Generations"" has the stuff big screen space operas and good science fiction are made up; there's an ethical dilemma, an action packed script and some solid character development. What it doesn't have is the sense that it was designed for the big screen. Despite the bigger production values and epic scope of the initial action, the film feels like it could have been made during the series'seven year reign. There's also the lack of a larger than life villain. While McDowell is great in his role as the complex villain Soren, you get the feeling that Picard and Kirk could easily take him out. The ending haunted the film from the very beginning; the death scenes for Captain Kirk had to be reshot after the film was finished as it just didn't have the mythic quality the producers and fans wanted. The final ending doesn't either but it is more satisfying than the original ending (which is included on this special edition). ""Generations"" provides an entertaining two hour adventure and, while not the best Trek film from The Next Generation crew (""Star Trek: First Contact"" holds that honor), it's a satisfying adventure.

I've not seen this much edge enhancement in some time. While the transfer captures the vivid colors of the ocean at the beginning and the desolate beauty of the desert at the end, the over use of edge enhancement (in the form of a shimmering effect) cripples this disc. It's not really noticeable on a small screen but on big screen TVs, the use of a Proxima Projector or on a HDTV, it's noticeable to the point that it's distracting. On the plus side, this ""next generation"" edition of the film is a marked improvement over the bare bones edition Paramount issued five years ago. The film receives a nice anamorphic transfer with a much crisper picture and better detail than on the previous DVD. The bright colors and solid blacks are rendered very nicely. The analog blemishes are few and it's clear that this has been struck from a new print.

On the plus side as well we're offered a terrific 5.1 channel Dolby Digital track as well as a DTS version of the soundtrack. There are also Dolby Digital 2.0 tracks available for both the English and French soundtracks as well. The sonic detail and a great dynamic range highlight the soundtrack. The clear dialogue, effects and music are distinct and have tremendous presence regardless of which version of the soundtrack you select.

 With a second disc of extras, ""Generations"" is a marked improvement over the first edition. The first edition of the film didn't even have the theatrical trailer. Here we get ""The Star Trek Universe"", ""Production"", ""Visual effects"" and other featurettes focusing on the production of the movie. The production quality of the featurettes is more than a cut above the standard releases as well. We get interviews on set with cast and crew as well as behind-the-scenes footage of the production of the movie nicely edited with some neat graphics.

""Star Trek Universe is divided into the following segments; Production is divided into three sections; ""A Tribute to Matt Jeffries"" which is one of the best and most touching featurettes here. Jeffries was the original art director for the original series and continued on in various roles throughout the movies as well. ""The Enterprise Lineage"" discusses all the ships from the series ""Enterprise"" to the Enterprise-D launched in ""Star Trek: First Contact"". ""Captain Picard's Family Album"" and ""Creating 24th Century Weapons"" round out this particular section. Production focuses on the following areas; ""Uniting Two Legends"", ""Stellar Cartography: Creating the Illusion"" and ""Strange New Worlds: The Valley of Fire"". The first focuses on the brainstorming that went into uniting two different TV icons in the movie. The second featurette discusses the creation of the famous Stellar Cartography deck and is related to the challenges of creating believable optical effects for this sequence. The third and final featurette here focuses on the alien planet where the bulk of the second half of the film takes place. ""Visual Effects"" provides an inside look at the creation of the models and miniatures as well as the sequence where the Enterprise crashes into the surface of the alien planet.

Next we get ""Scene Deconstruction"" that allows us to glimpse the creation of the main title sequence. We see how the effect for the Nexus Ribbon is created and see how the illusion of the crash of the Enterprise was so convincingly portrayed. There's a number of deleted scenes included (most of them unfinished which is why they weren't integrated back into the film) including the ""Orbital Skydiving"" scene that was originally supposed to open the film. ""Walking the Plank"" provides a glimpse of a sequence that takes place during Worf's promotion ceremony that was trimmed for time reasons. The last two will be of particular interest to fans of the film and series. We see a more involved sequence depicting Christmas with The Picards. This involves Captain Picard's imaginary family and his experience in the Nexus and, for the grand finale, the alternate ending that only preview audiences saw. There's also the inclusion of deleted scenes, a photo gallery and a selection of production storyboards to compare to the finished film.

 Writers Ron Moore and Brannon Braga provide the commentary track for the film. Since both wrote a number of the best TV episodes of ""The Next Generation"" and this film along with ""First Contact"", they're able to provide a unique and fascinating glimpse into the compromises involved in making a Trek film. From Paramount's direction that the film has to be understandable by anyone not familiar to ""Star Trek"" to issues with the fans reaction to the film, both writers give us a candid account of the production. This, along with Michael and Denise Okuda's precise and informative text commentary give an excellent insider's perspective on the making of this film.

 Although ""Star Trek Generations"" couldn't possibly live up to the fan expectations for the film, it's still a solid outing in the franchise. If more risks had been taken with the screenplay and direction, perhaps this film could have been as good as ""Star Trek: First Contact"". Regardless, Paramount has put together a fine and comprehensive special edition here. My only complaint is the over use of edge enhancement that mars an otherwise fine transfer free of the analog blemishes that marred the ""Star Trek V-Collector's Edition"" from a couple of years ago.",1094515200,47,8852,4.949528936742934

734238,3,6303909949,"I remember seeing Star Trek VI in cinemas near Xmas-time in 1991 and being satisfied that the original crew signed-off on such a strong film before handing over the Enterprise to new generations. I ate up a lot TNG on television when I was a sick teenager with nothing else to do but lie in bed. A lot of people were disappointed with Generations when it was released in late '94/early '95 but I didn't get to see it until much later. Now, as an adult with a refined opinion, I can see how dissatisfying it is.

With Kirk and Co. moving on the Enterprise is now helmed by the nave Harriman, who lacks the confidence to trust his own decisions. When a mysterious energy ribbon causes havoc on the other side of the galaxy the Enterprise rushes in to save the day, but guest of honor Kirk dies (or apparently dies) when a huge section of the deck is torn off the ship, taking him with it.

Flash-forward 78 years and Picard is now at the helm of Enterprise-D and the ribbon, now called the Nexus, has come back. After beaming the survivors of a doomed solar observatory on-board Guinan recognizes one of them as Doctor Soran, who survived the previous Nexus disaster. Picard's suspicion of Soran is proven correct when he double-crosses the Federation, kidnaps Geordie, and hooks up with the Klingons. Meanwhile Data experiments with his emotions chip and feels guilt over not being able to save Geordie.

The plot makes Z-E-R-O sense when you think about it. The Nexus is apparently a type of heaven where your dreams can come true on a whim. A nice idea, but Soran's motivation is to get back into the Nexus as any cost. He plans on destroying a solar system to pull the Nexus close to him and be whisked away. Er...why does he not just fly into it in a ship? If Kirk is in the Nexus and is still alive then it will obviously work even if the ship gets destroyed. If this DIDN'T work for whatever reason then just beam into the Nexus. Duh!

For some reason Paramount didn't think a movie about the hugely successful Next Generation crew would stand on its own so they cooked-up this nonsense plot to shoehorn a Kirk/Picard team-up into the mix. But they barely feature together and Kirk's real death scene is the STUPIDEST death in movie history. What were they thinking? He falls a few feet from a rickety platform? Really??? THAT is the big send off for one of the most iconic characters in all of history?

Aside from this massive failing the film looks great with lots of dark lighting and shadows, and is a huge step-up from TV production values. Sadly, Jerry Goldsmith did not score this one, leaving the composing duties to TV composer Dennis McCarthy who does an adequate job, but the movie is painfully lacking the familiar Star Trek themes. The action and effects are still quite nice to this day, which is unusual for 1994 vintage CG.

Star Trek Generations is simply incapable of giving the audience what it wants. The arrogance of the studio and producers faulted this film down to the marrow, but there is still a lot in there which is entertaining, especially the ethereal atmosphere inside the Nexus. Just keep your expectations somewhere in the middle and you'll be okay.

The Blu-ray looks great in 2.35:1 1080p with Dolby TrueHD sound. A decent amount of extras are included.",1094256000,5,3294,4.563451776649746
734239,4,6303909949,"This was The Next Genarations first movie outing,and I thought it could of been alot better. I don't hate the movie,but I think they did not need to include Kirk?I think the people who did this movie should of done there home work better. The scene that always buged me was the begining. And if you watched the TNG episode Relics then you should know what i'm talking about. Scotty was on The Enterprise B when Kirk got sucked in the Nexus. Yet in the TNG episode Relics when Scotty gets rescued by the TNG crew. Riker tells Scotty that he was Commander of The Enterprise and Scottys replied was ""Kirk has come to rescue me?""Yet Kirk is supposed to be dead to Scotty. I also think it would of been nice to see Kirk aboard The Enterprise-D,I would of loved to have seen his reaction to Worf. A Klingon serving on The Enterprise! Leonard Nimoy was invited back to play Spock again and also to direct the film,I know Leonard read the script and he thought it was awful,he told Paramount he would do Genarations but he wanted a new screen play to be writen,Paramount said no,so Leonard walked away and refused to direct and star in Genarations,so Paramount wrote him out of the script. Well that's the story I heard. Well I never realy hated the movie,I did enjoy Data in the movie. The new DVD is going to feature for the first time for a Trek movie DTS sound. As well as some special features. This DVD will be alot better then the first version that hit DVD that did not have any special features not even a Theatical trailer.

734389,3,6303909949,"Although not the best of the STAR TREK films, GENERATIONS offers up the passing of the torch to the crew of THE NEXT GENERATION as they set into the new frontier of the ""widescreen"".  Kirk's participation in this adventure is limited to the intro and climax of the film, but along the way fans get to visit with the crew that followed the original and made their own mark in television history.  The Collector's Edition of this movie is filled with ""making of"" documentaries and behind-the-scenes looks of the film -- although filled with great cast interviews of the time, very little effort is put forth to make these particular special features...special.",1093910400,,658,4.866071428571429
734390,5,6303909949,"Generations is one of the really overlooked Trek films that some fans seem to love to hate; with the task of killing off the legendary Captain Kirk and launching the Next Generation cast's big screen series, it has to accomplish a lot in the space of two hours. (Not to mention Star Trek VI was definately a tough act to follow.) Of all the TNG movies, this one is the most like the series, recreating the chemistry between the actors and the relationships between the characters the best, in my opinion. Unlike the next three films, which focus almost exclusively on Picard and Data, Generations seems to remember that TNG was an ensemble show and gives memorable screen time to most of the main cast. That said, most of the character development still focuses on Picard and Data, and Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner add a lot to the meandering plot with their brilliant performances; they  both present commanding and moving presences in portraying the emotional turmoil of their respective characters. This aspect of the movie actually takes a lot of precedence over the gimmick of having Picard and Kirk meet; Shatner has suprisingly little screen time in the overall picture. The villain, Soran, seems a bit over the top at first, but becomes quite compelling as the story moves forward. He is still one of my favorite villains in all the Trek films. He is creepy, as one other reviewer commented, but for me, that didn't detract from the sympathetic side you see at the end during his confrontation with Picard. His analogy of time being like a ""predator"" was especially memorable to me. The score, by Dennis McCarthy is startlingly different from other Trek movies, but captures the mood and tone of the story perfectly. The slow, ephemeral opening is especially arresting. Finally, a lot of people complain about how Kirk's death is handled, saying that it was too simple or unheroic. Personally, I doubt anyone could ever really be satisfied with the death of Kirk. Given the nature of the scene and the story, it's hard to imagine how else it could be handled, without completely rewriting the end of the movie. In any case, Shatner and Stewart add a lot to Kirk's end, handling it simply, yet poignantly. This remains one of my personal favorites of all the Star Trek movies, holding true to TNG's flavor and tone much more than the next three films.",1093651200,2,2362,4.775061124694377

3)the trailers

Well 2 out of 3 ain't bad. The trailers which were not included on the original DVD release are listed on the packaging for this new ""Collector's Edition"" but to my dismay were no where to be found. Thats a bit of a disappointment, but after waiting 10 years we finally get to see Kirk's orbit dive and Kirk getting shot in the back - which by the way is the ending that should have remained in the final cut of the film.

Kirk is believed killed, and we head back to the 24th century.  A whole plot with the nexus isn't great, but we get some important lore; Data's Emotion Chip, the death of the Duras Sisters, and the destruction of the Enterprise NCC-1701D.

Since the TOS episode, Tomorrow is Yesterday, Star Trek was sometimes able to predict the future.  For those who don't know, they knew what weekday the moon landing would fall and they knew when an important assignation would take place.  This one predicted that Scotty, James Doohan, would get alzheimers.

734393,4,6303909949,"I saw this film numerous times in the theatre when it was released at Christmas time 1994 because it was that good. Unfortunately, that was the last time I bothered to see a ""Trek"" film more than once at the theatre. This movie has everything a great ""Trek"" film needs: action, humor, awesome visual effects, and most important, a heart. They really pulled off the two most notable captains of the starship Enterprise meeting with a clever plot device. There is only one slow spot, aboard Soran's space station, otherwise it's very well paced. The acting is better than was in ""VI"" due to the fact that the wooden Takei and Nichols have been replaced with the more convincing Burton, Dorn, and McFadden. The villan, Dr. Soran, is a great classic villan with an agenda we can relate to, played very well by Malcolm McDowell. The ending was heartwrenching yet hopeful. After ""Trek III"", this is William Shatner's finest hour as Kirk. All in all, this is definately one of the best ""Trek"" films. It will be so cool to see the original opening and ending on the new collector's edition that preview audiences didn't like and judge for ourselves.",1091577600,4,1141,4.71

Imagine a 007 fan having his/her wish coming true seeing Sean Connery and Roger Moore working together or something like that.  The special effects are of top quality, and the crashing of the Enterprise D is spectacular.

There are some disappointments.  Like Jonathan Frakes said, the Nexus thing is a loophole as big as the Earth.  In the novel, Spock attended Kirk's funeral and actually shed a tear or two; but Berman decided Nimoy's character wasn't necessary and cut him out.

This is the most special Star Trek film ever, and I could go on and on about all the little great things in this Berman concoction that often go unnoticed by the general audience.  But trekkers know better.",1091491200,2,957,4.9375

If your a TRUE Star Trek Fan, and want to enjoy this film even more, you MUST get the three books written by William Shatner. The first book is ""Ashes of Eden."" It takes place just before ""Generations"" and has Jim Kirk battling between his long Star Fleet Career and the lack of action in any retirement. In it Capt. Kirk find that he is still called to save worlds, even in his retirement. It fills the gap leading up to the first part of the film. It is true Captian Kirk in action. This book could have been made into a Star Trek movie by itself and can stand alone.
The second book, ""The Return"", takes place right after the death of Jim Kirk with Spock at his best friend's grave. As from the title, we all want Jim Kirk to live and he does ""Return.""
You can stop after this book too, if you want to have Jim Kirk dead. (Yes, he dies at the end) But, hold the phone, he will live again in the next book, ""Avenger"" to save the universe again.

734533,5,6303909949,"STAR TREK GENERATIONS (1994) took on a monumentally difficult task---namely, the passing of the legendary STAR TREK torch from the original cast to the ""Next Generation"" cast---and does it almost seamlessly. Despite what many self-professed ""Star Trek experts"" may say, there was no perfect way to accomplish this. Having recently viewed this film for approximately the 10th time, I am as impressed as ever at the job that director David Carson and screenwriter Rick Berman (who took over as head of the STAR TREK franchise after creator Gene Roddenberry died in 1991) did. I can honestly say that I couldn't have done as good a job at bridging the two generations---and neither could have any of these ""experts"" who choose to pick apart at it.
If you're reading this review and others, you undoubtedly know what this film's about, so I'm not going into a rundown of plot here. I will, however, put in my two-cents worth of opinion about this film: it is a well-paced, fully realized cinematic vision, with great special effects, a compelling main plot, a humorous subplot and some excellent acting on the part of Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner and Malcolm McDowell. Even William Shatner is pretty good here---his acting *has* improved with age and experience! As Dr. Tolian Soren, Malcolm McDowell creates a villain for whom we can actually care; although we don't agree with what he does, we can certainly relate to the reasons why he does what he does. However, this does not make it any less compelling for Capts. Kirk and Picard to stop him from carrying out his destructive methods, leading to the extremely suspenseful---and, ultimately, sad---scene which is as inevitable as it is fateful.
I really love STAR TREK GENERATIONS. It has a winning combination of intelligent storyline mixed in with action, suspense and---surprisingly---humor, and plays fair with the rules of the game and the legacy of the series. I really can't imagine any true STAR TREK fan not loving it. It may require some patience on first viewing, perhaps, but the rewards are great for sticking with it. Plus, it only gets better on repeated viewings. I can vouch for that!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1084492800,5,2172,4.96978021978022
734534,2,6303909949,"For years, Trekkies wanted to see Captains James Kirk and Jean-Luc Picard finally team up and unite the two major generations of the Starship Enterprise in what would, doubtless, be an adventure to remember.  As is so often the case, the realization of that dream leaves a lot to be desired, and the final result is all too forgettable.
What went wrong?  For one thing, Kirk's character is handled very poorly.  The adventurous, 23rd-century Odysseus has devolved into a whipped milksop who wants to leave galaxy-saving to Picard so he can go back to fixing eggs.  Moreover the film is choppy and slow.  There's not much action, despite a brief confrontation between the Enterprise and some rogue Klingons.  There's a lot of really silly ""humor"" courtesy of Data and some new emotions, which makes a mockery of the ordinarily poignant portrayal of the android's ongoing quest to become more human.  And Soran, despite behing essayed by an excellent actor in Malcom McDowell, is a terribly weak antagonist who fails to bring any genuine menace to the lackluster plot.  Worst of all, the infamous death scene (and if you've ever even heard of this movie before you know what I'm talking about) is a total embarrassment and a sorry way to send off one of the greatest sci-fi heroes in TV and cinema history.
I suppose there are a couple of plusses, though they are relatively weak ones.  The early scenes with a few of the original Trek crew members are effective, and Captain Picard's familial subplot is genuinely touching.  As one would expect of a big-budget Star Trek film, the production values are excellent all-around and everything looks terrific.  But there should have been a lot more to brag about, and there's just not.
This could have easily been a milestone in the Star Trek canon.  Instead, it's possibly the series' low point (though I admit it has some competition for that dubious honor from ""The Final Frontier"").  The story needed a stronger script, better characterization for Captain Kirk, a more powerful villain, and more action.  This is one film that might have actually benefitted from being half an hour longer. Trekkie loyalists and completists may still enjoy it, but it's not a movie I can recommend to the general fan.

734535,4,6303909949,"Six months following the airing of the final two-part series finale of the TV series ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" in May 1994, Paramount Pictures released the first feature-length ""Star Trek"" film that starred the ""The Next Generation"" cast.  The film was entitled ""Star Trek: Generations"", was the seventh ""Star Trek"" film to be released to date and featured three original ""Star Trek"" regulars, who had starred in the first six feature films, as well as the original ""Star Trek"" TV series that aired between 1966 and 1969.
Directed by David Carson (who directed several ""Star Trek"" TV series episodes for both the ""The Next Generation"" and ""Deep Space 9"" series), ""Star Trek: Generations"" attempted to bridge the approximate 85-year gap that spanned the time between when the original ""Star Trek"" and ""The Next Generation"" TV series were supposed to take place (respectively, about 300 and 400 years in the future).  The film begins with the christening of the Federation of Planets newest starship, the Enterprise-B, with the retired Capt. James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Cmdr. Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Capt. Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott (James Doohan) in attendance.  Under the command of the inept Capt. John Harriman (Alan Ruck), the Enterprise-B on its maiden voyage is forced to answer distress calls from two refugee ships caught in a bizarre spatial phenomenon.  Some of the refugees are rescued, including Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) and Dr. Tolian Soran (Malcolm McDowell); but Capt. Kirk vanishes and is presumed dead.  The story then moves forward to a promotion ceremony for Lt. Cmdr. Worf (Michael Dorn) aboard the Enterprise-D, during which, Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) receives some very troubling news, then the Enterprise-D receives a distress call from a scientific research station.  The Enterprise-D answers the distress call and finds Dr. Torian Soran among the survivors.  From that point on, some very unusual events begin to unfold as the preoccupied Capt. Picard is forced to set aside personal grief to deal with what could be an extremely perilous situation.  A subplot to the main story is the decision by the android Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner) to install an emotion chip with the assistance of Lt. Cmdr. Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton).  This subplot is woven back into the main story when the Klingon sisters Lursa (Barbara March) and B'Etor (Gwynyth Walsh) appear.
Though many ""Star Trek"" fans panned ""Star Trek: Generations"" after it was released to theaters in November, 1994, the film's story is engaging, effectively blends classic ""Star Trek"" humor with action and is, as far this reviewer is concerned, one of the better ""Star Trek"" films.  That said, the film also has some flaws, including William Shatner's less-than-inspiring acting; but the film's positives definitely out-weigh its negatives as the audience becomes engrossed within the imminent destruction of millions of lives, and the mystery of the ""nexus"".  Other memorable characters in the film include Cmdr. William T. Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden), Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis), Ensign Demora Sulu (Jacqueline Kim) and Lieutenant Tuvok (Tim Russ, who would also play this character in the TV series ""Star Trek: Voyager"").  Memorable scenes include the arrival on the bridge of the Enterprise-B, the rescue of the refugees, Worf's ceremony, Picard with Troi, Data testing emotions in ""10-Forward"", the exploding star, Lursa and B'Etor, the crash and the nexus.  Overall, I rate ""Star Trek: Generations"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  Not everyone who watches the film will enjoy it, but it is likely that those who enjoy it outnumber those that don't.",1082246400,,3710,5.2449324324324325
734536,3,6303909949,"First off, when you review a Star Trek movie, or for that matter make one, you have to carefully consider your audience, which unfortunately causes enough compromises and plot/astronomical improbababilties to rival ""stars in the sky or grains of sand on a beach.""  Generations has its galaxy full of rerouted couplinks and left their intended audiences bewildered to the point that they couldn't figure out who would like it.  In other words we have a very difficult compromise to deal with, making this tough to recommend to both casual fans and Trekkies.  Infact after several times viewing it, it's taken 10 years for me to ""get it"" enough to review it. The plot, and especially subplot concerning Lt. Com. Data's (Brett Spiner's) emotion chip has all too subtle jabs at the trek world; rather suprising given that the writers and director labored over the series for so long (or perhaps that's why both Data and the films villians are given their fair share to demean it throughout).  Not suprisingly, few trek fans embraced Spiner's spastic comedic turns as did the non-trek action movie fans.  That leaves the casual trek moviegoer imagining that Spiner is a frustrated fan invading the ship to twist things up and poke fun at everything from the psuedo technoillogical interstellar whatchamacallit orders like doing tricorder readings to scanning for lifeforms.  The casual fan like myself has been thouroughly engaged by Spiner's antics enough to finally conclude that it was refreshing to see his cut-ups burst out in such an alarming fashion.  It's also fun to see the Klingon sisters rip on Laforge's(Levar Burton) role as chief engineer as though they too questioned the TNG series' flaws.
At first viewing, the cinematography and over the top score added an extra intensity that even the TV series finale didn't match and it still holds up today.  The action sequences too are top notch even if some were recycled from the series.  Most of us loved the crash sequence and gag at the fact that the evacuation sequence was silly (was the entire crew comprised of children and housed near a nuclear type reactor core?)
All technological effects and cosmic swashbuckling aside, the trek fans were looking for the kind of character interaction that blossomed since the 60s and anticipated a triumphant over- the-top egomanical return of the Kirk (William Shatner) character.  He's here and handles his role as you'd expect even if his ultimate fate is deliriously underplayed.  The most satisfying moments view after view is the unceasing menace that Malcolm McDowell brings to his what-would've-been stock ""tortured obsessed villian"" character Soren. In a mere shift of an eyebrow he is gloriously disturbing and simulaneously easy to empathize with, trademark casual sadism and all.  Many trekkies have warmed up to his performance too; often quoting McDowell's best lines as they would with Ricardo Montalban's Khan in Star Trek II, Alan Rickman's villains in Robin Hood and Die Hard, and of course, McDowell's many classic villains that made him legend.
The rest of the cast have adequate performances and react consistently with Data's new found emotions as you'd expect and with the many ""gasious anomoly"" gobbledygook that occurs in the trek universe, including the entire cast going through the what-if-time-continuum anarchy that the intially confusing Nexus plot brings about.  You will find this film quite engaging in the end even if it takes a generation to figure out the convoluted as the Original Motion Picture plot nexus thing. Thank the actors for making the best of their script. Hopefully the often ballyhooed deleted scenes featuring the Soren-Laforge interrigation and the extra Shatner bits will show up. Otherwise it's a highly satisfying rental even if it took me 10 years to finally recomend it.",1082160000,2,3830,5.118589743589744

734538,2,6303909949,"""Star Trek: Generations"" is one of my least favorite entries in the series.  There are some great ideas here, but unfortunately there's not a whole lot to get excited about.
Patrick Stewart is a terrific actor, and this is mainly his film, so it's not all bad.  He has a way of making even the dumbest lines of dialogue seem moving and important, and the scene where he deals with the death of his nephew is generally well done.  He also interacts pretty well with William Shatner's Kirk, making their scenes together interesting; indeed, ""Generations"" only really does come to life when those two are together on the screen.  Unfortunately, despite what the marketing would make you think, they're only together the final half hour of the film.
""Generations"" does a lot more things wrong than right.  For starters, it was directed by relative unknown David Carson (lesson to studio execs- a major film that has a rabid fanbase should not be a training ground for a new director), who is obviously in way over his head here.  Any sense of pacing is thrown out of the window, making the few action scenes that are in ""Generations"" borderline lame.  ""The Next Generation"" regulars are pretty much going through the motions- only Brent Spiner has a large role as Data, and unfortunately the filmakers decided to make him an idiot in this movie as he experiments with his new ""emotion chip"".  The film's ending- which features the death of a major character- falls surprisingly flat, especially when compared to the ending of ""Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan"".
The villains are among the worst ever in the franchise.  Malcolm McDowell tries to make Soran a complex and conflicted character and does an adequate job, but unfortunately is no one to hiss at.  He's more misguided than evil, and I can't recall him ever directly killing anyone.  On the other hand, the Klingons that are assisting him are laughably one-dimensional.  Only the female Klingon captains have any dialogue, and they're incredibly stupid- their henchmen just beat people up and grunt like animals.  After the more complex view of the Klingons that ""The Undiscovered Country"" gave, this is an unwelcome step backward.
And so, ""Generations""' pacing problems, inadequate direction, and lackluster ending causes me to rank it among the worst of the ""Star Trek"" films, just a knotch above ""The Final Frontier"".  It's still worth a view if you're a hardcore Trek fan (as I consider myself), but more casual ones might want to avoid this one.  Also, I want to say a special jeer to Paramount for releasing the ""Star Trek"" films with so few extras, and then making us Trek fans buy them over again for the ""Special Editions"".  Don't buy this film yet if you must- wait for the Special Edition!",1076284800,22,2751,4.808917197452229
734539,5,6303909949,"Star Trek: Generations is the first TNG film and a great start to the franchise.  Generations is filled with action, adventure, peril and some spectacular special effects.

734541,4,6303909949,"Star Trek Generations, the seventh of 10 feature films based on the two series created by Gene Roddenberry, is the final passing of the torch from the Original Series to the Next Generation crew as Capt. Jean-Luc Picard and his crew takes the Enterprise-D on its continuining trek across the stars.
It is also William Shatner's final appearance as Capt. James Tiberius Kirk and, as Spock would say, a logical exit in what amounts to a guest role in an ambitious Star Trek: The Next Generation episode, albeit one made for the movies.  It is an appearance fans had hoped for, since the rest of the ""Enterprise Four"" (Dr. McCoy, Scotty, Spock) had already made either cameos or appeared in major episodes (""Unification Parts I and II"" and ""Relics"") set in the 24th Century.
Writers Brannon Braga, Ronald D. Moore (who is also involved in the Sci-Fi Channel's ""reimagined"" Battlestar Galactica miniseries) and Rick Berman came up with a creative way to bring Kirk and Picard together without using time travel or technological ""cheats"" like a transporter feedback loop (which is how Scotty had managed to enter the 24th Century).  They would start the film in the 23rd Century, with Kirk doing something typically Kirk-heroic, then go forward in time to Picard's time and have the two captains join forces to face a common foe.
It's 2295. The Enterprise-A has been decommissioned, her crew disbanded and her senior officers retired or reassigned.  Above Earth, the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-B is being launched, and Kirk, Scotty (James Doohan) and Chekov (Walter Koenig) are guests of honor at her commissioning ceremony.  But the brief PR-friendly cruise to ""Pluto and back"" is cut short by a distress signal from two El-Aurian refugee vessels caught in a strange energy ribbon.  Under the command of Capt. John Harriman (Alan Ruck), the woefully undermanned and underequipped Enterprise-B mounts a risky rescue mission, beaming a handful of El-Aurians aboard, including Dr. Tolian Soran (Malcolm McDowell) and future Enterprise-D bartender Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg).
But before the Enterprise-B can escape the effects of the energy ribbon, a tendril strikes the starship and causes damage. Kirk and Scotty find a way to get the starship out of harm's way...and the former captain of the original Enterprise heads down to the Engineering section to implement their plan. It works, but not before the energy ribbon's lightning-like rays lash out at the Enterprise and open a gash in the great ship's hull...right where James T. Kirk is standing...and the legendary captain vanishes and is presumed dead.
Fast forward 78 years into the 24th Century: The Galaxy-class Starship Enterprise-D is on the seventh year of its exploration-defense-diplomatic mission under the command of Capt. Picard (Patrick Stewart).  It's a time of celebration as the crew celebrates Worf's (Michael Dorn) promotion to lieutenant commander, and everyone is enjoying the ceremony in the holodeck. After a light moment highlighting first officer William Riker's (Jonathan Frakes) penchant for practical jokes and Lt. Cmdr. Data's (Brent Spiner) inability to understand humor, the mood darkens when Picard receives a message from Earth that leaves him stunned with grief.
To make matters worse, an unknown force has brutally attacked the Amargosa Observatory, leaving only one survivor, Dr. Tolian Soran....the same man rescued from the energy ribbon nearly 80 years before by the Enterprise-B.  Picard assigns his senior officers to investigate. After all, who would attack a scientific outpost...and why?
Soon Picard is forced to put his feelings of grief and guilt aside to confront the mystery at the Amargosa station and to find out why an obsessed genius seeks to destroy an entire star system and cause the strange energy ribbon -- known as the Nexus -- to change course.  And in order to stop his unexpected new antagonist, Picard must enlist the aid of another legendary  captain of the Starship Enterprise.....
Director David Carson, making his debut as a feature film director here, keeps things moving at a fast, steady pace, making Star Trek Generations an above-average entry in the movie series.  Although Star Trek: First Contact is by far more exciting and interesting, Generations still has a good premise, stunning special effects and serves as a launching point for three more Star Trek films starring the Next Generation cast.",1070755200,,4415,5.205633802816902
734644,4,6303909949,"As this movie approches it's 10th anniversary...I find myself becoming more and more fond of it. I really, really enjoyed it!!
I am a fan of both the original ""Star Trek"" series and ""The Next Generation"", and I think this film combines the two beautifully.
Patrick Stewart (Captain Jean-Luc Picard) and William Shatner (Captain James T. Kirk) deliver fine performances both individually and during their brief time on screen together, and Malcolm McDowell (Dr. Soran) is a very credible and interesting villian.
The rest of the cast (both from the Original Series and the Next Generation) are all in fine form. If you haven't seen this movie because of less than enthusiastic reviews from critics and Star Trek fans I suggest that you watch it and judge for yourself. It's not the best of the Star Trek movies...but it is far from being the worst!
My only complaint is that this DVD has absolutely nothing in the way of Bonus Features or materials. It doesn't even have the film's theatrical trailer (which even the most basic DVD's usually contain).
Hopefully Paramount will release a ""Special Edition"" DVD of this movie (like they've doing so far with Star Trek I thru VI) and give the fans what they deserve with a great Star Trek movie and DVD.
If you're a fan of Star Trek...you'll want to see this one and if you're a die-hard fan...you'll want to pick up this DVD...even though it lacks in bonuses.",1070150400,5,1405,4.738775510204082
734645,5,6303909949,"I feel that science fiction is very hard to write and you have to make it as simple as you can. And since Star Trek has become so elaborate by a construction made from a period of almost 40 years, it is still difficult to write a story that would match a trekkie's expectations.
To me Star Trek Generations is an awesome movie. It is a magnification of the TNG series just as I wanted to see it with great camera movements on the bridge, stunning visual effects in space and a theme that will make you wonder.
Generations catches the true spirit of to the whole cast as well as the Star trek tradition of seeking the nature of human existence.
The death of Kirk had to be in this film. We knew what Spock, Bones and Scotty were doing in the 24th century. And Picard's send off of the most legendary ship captain fo all time made a great closure the the original cast.

The later films tried so hard to directly impress that I keep coming back to this film for the emotion I look for from the NG cast.  There are so many internal challenges of the characters that more directly relate to our own challenges as people, I consider this film to be of greater value.
If you want to solidify Star Trek canon, watch First Contact.  If you want a decent good time, watch Insurrection.  If you want to see the latest fads in Hollywood, watch Nemesis.  If you want to see the NG cast at their best, and a story that lets them express their values as people, watch Generations.",1059350400,2,912,4.6397515527950315
734647,4,6303909949,"(CAUTION: SPOILERS AHEAD)
A truly spectacular addition to the Star Trek legacy, Star Trek: Generations had everything that a Trekkie could ever ask for- heart-pounding action with first-Enterprise Captain Kirk at his finest, keen insight on what drives fourth-Enterprise Captain Picard to be such a dedicated and determined leader, further development of Data's character (easily the most interesting Star Trek character of all time) as he feels emotion for the very first time, dazzling special effects as two, count 'em, two Enterprises have more holes punched into them than swiss cheese placed next to a mouse hole, and, of course, classic Star Trek humor (most of which is focused on Data- coincidence?  I think not).
Whereas the previous Star Trek film focused heavily on characters, ideals, politics, and Shakespeare, Star Trek: Generations, what with the introduction of a new crew to the silver screen, was a chance to get back to the roots of Star Trek- interstellar exploration, special effects, character development on a massive scale, and tongue-in-cheek humor.  With an original plot, unlike anything displayed in the Next Generation series from which these characters hail, depicting a crazed man's quest for eternal happiness by way of interdimensional ribbon of energy, the film was engaging to fans, while still understandable by non-Trekkies.
In terms of characters, each cast member easily held their own.  The classic Trek characters depicted in the opening scenes (Kirk, Chekov, and Scotty), reprising their roles from years past, made quick work of stealing each second of air time in which they were shown.  In the latter half of the movie, the new crew members from TNG displayed their mastery of their roles, acquired from seven years on television.  What's more, the film makes a point to give each character enough screen time to make their presence in the film worthwhile, and while the film obviously centers on Captains' Kirk and Picard, the rest of the crew(s) make themselves known as well (especially Data).  Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) was a delight as always as the mystical El-Aurian, and this film even serves to shine some light on Guinan's elusive past.  Then there were the villains- Malcolm McDowell, as the mad scientist Dr. Soran, presents a character determined to get into ""paradise,"" so to speak, so as he can see his lost family again.  His intentions are understandable, but McDowell's performance is just crazed and cool enough to let the viewer hate his guts.  Klingon mercenaries Lursa and B'Etor also make a short, dramatic (and final) appearance.

All in all, I only had two major complaints, which kept me from giving the film my highest rating.  First, because the film had two extremely-prominent characters (Kirk and Picard) to deal with, the other characters, although felt and acknowledged, were all but unnecessary to the primary plot of the film.  Finally, Kirk's death was under-emphasized.  This was a man who had confronted nearly every evil force in the galaxy, and, in his valiant, headstrong fashion, emerged victorious.  Then, through some bad luck, he was killed when a bridge collapsed under him!  The man who nearly single-handedly defeated Khan, dozens of Klingons, and dozens of other strange alien creatures, was killed by a bridge!
Despite these weaknesses, this film was a worthy addition to the Star Trek film library, and I highly recommend adding it to your home video library today.",1058054400,,3461,5.166368515205725

734649,3,6303909949,"The first movie of the ""Next Generation"" crew was made at the same time Deep Space Nine was in its third season and Voyager was in its first. Because the attention spans of the producers and writers often shifted between the 3, Generations doesn't quite live up to its full potential.
The first 15 minutes of the film, which deals with Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov aboard the new Enterprise-B, the undeniably the BEST part of the entire movie. Featuring great special effects and powered by an exciting score, this is the movie (and classic Trek) at its best.
After the exciting prologue, we are taken 78 years in to the future to the crew of the Enterprise-D. The rest of the film slows down. A lot. Instead of establishing rising action, we see the crew messing around in the Holodeck (that scene was pointless) and Data laugh his as* off for 10 minutes. Then there is a very small phaser fight and Geordi is captured.
This is where the film gets interesting. The descripition of the ""Nexus"" is great, as is the clever build-up to a fairly exciting space battle. (Which is then followed by a spectacular scene where the Enterprise-D crash lands on a forest planet.) And of course, don't forget Kirk, who comes in at the very end to help Picard stop the evil Dr. Soran (Malcolm McDowell) from destroying a star.
Seeing Picard and Kirk on the screen fight together is great, and the chemistry between the two is marvelous. All of the acting by everyone involved in the film is great, especially Patrick Stewart.
And now to the problems.........
In a sentence: It feels too much like the TV show. It has the same ship, the same costumes, and even some of the same special effects from the show. Of course, this would all be solved in the next movie, but it would've been great to make some new special effects and costumes. The music, which is really great during the first 15 minutes, sounds like the TV show's monotonous music for the remainder of the film. But like I mentioned eariler, 2 shows were going on during the time when this movie was made.
Besides those pitfalls, (and how the film makes fun of Data for 15 minutes) this film is a good one and a worthy start to the TNG movies. Just don't expect anything the later movies would bring to the franchise.

Funny thing, if Shatner had imposed on the ST family like Stewart, would he still be disliked?  I am a hugh Shatner fan.  I hated it when they killed Kirk off.  That is not a spoiler, because we knew it was coming before we saw the movie.  But then Shatner wrote the ST book The Return and several sequels to the Return, so Kirk is still alive in the ST universe.  ST TNG was the best of the 4 ST TV series, even better the original.  I say 4 series, because the jury is out on the 5th series, Enterprise (but things are looking good so far).  Actually Shatner gets killed twice in this movie.  But ""The Stream"" a traveling ? grads Kirk and keeps him alive.

734717,3,6303909949,"With the original cast retired and the banner to be passed onto the Next Generation cast, producer Rick Berman would take the reigns and hire television director David Carson and musical composer Dennis McCarthy to do the film.  In a plotline written by Brannon Braga and Ronald Moore, the story involves three of the original castmates (Kirk, Chekov, Scotty), although only Kirk is greatly involved to any extent.  Would this be the great debut for the next generation?
In many ways, no.
While the story is very Trekkish in tone, the problem lies with a few things.  One, the climax of the story is not well written.  I expected Kirk and Picard to go on about their careers in the way Picard and Scotty did in the ""Relics"" episode.  Sadly, it's more like ""there's an evil man"" (blah blah) followed by ""sounds like fun,"" then they go off and try to save humanity.  Plus, after years of killing Klingons and whatever else lied out there in the universe, Kirk is killed on a metal platform that falls off a cliff.  Where's the character development in this?  It's like the writers killed him off without an emotional impact.  Same goes with the Enterprise-D; killed by a mere klingon bird of prey (and the exact same special effects from VI)!  Where's the glorious exit for these two milestones in history?!
On top of that, Dennis McCarthy's score fails to capture the film and make it stand out.  I don't really want to compare him to other composers, but while his score isn't terrible, he didn't take ANY chances with it at all (kinda like Goldsmith's score for Nemesis... odd).  It's basically a TV score.  No Klingon motifs, no special fanfare for Kirk (when he dies, it's just the same Trek theme done in dull sounding strongs), and especially no fanfare for the destruction of the Enterprise-D.  The original Enterprise at least got a brief piece of music for its destruction in III.
And did anyone else notice the weird lighting within the Enterprise?
On the plus side, Data actually gets emotions and this is pulled off quite well.  He comes off quite funny and the subplot involving his emotion chip is extroadinary.  We also get a good bad guy (not really a ""bad"" guy, which is interesting) played by Malcolm McDowall and even Guinan gets a good part here.  All in all, a decent story.
Is this recommended for Trek fans?  I'm mixed on that.  Not a terrible film, so it would please you if you didn't poke at it too much.  But as an opener for the TNG cast and the death of the legendary Captain Kirk, it falls extremely short.  While the film plays off as a tv sentimentality like Star Trek II, it also comes off as CONSTRUCTED like an episode.  This one could've been much better.

734718,4,6303909949,"Star Trek: Generations is a fairly solid entry in this long-running; it works both as an intriguing sci-fi/drama with original ideas and as an exciting adventure packed with energetic action sequences. Given that the previous movie, The Undiscovered Country, was the final outing for the original crew one of this film's primary purposes is to ""pass the torch"" to the crew of The Next Generation (which I very slightly prefer over the original crew, though no one can match the trio of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy) and for their first adventure, it's mostly a success.
Generations begins with the maiden voyage of the Enterprise-B, with a retired Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) set to look over the proceedings. But the simple run turns into a rescue mission when two ships are caught in an energy ribbon. Kirk saves the day, but presumably at the cost of his life, as the deck he was on is left in utter ruins by the ribbon.
Skip 78 years later, where the crew of the Enterprise-D, led by Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), rescues a scientist from a destroyed space station. The scientist, named Soran (Malcolm Mcdowell), was in the middle of an experiment, and seems determined to complete it. Going renegade, he kidnaps Geordi and boards a Klingon vessel. Slowly, his plans are uncovered and it's discovered what he has in mind will lead to the deaths of hundreds of millions.
Trek fans are obviously familiar with the ""odd number curse"", the belief that the odd-numbered entries are weaker compared to the even-numbered installments. There's some truth to that, but Generations is still a pretty good movie, and as far as I'm concerned, superior to the Next Generation's most recent film, Nemesis, and it's sure as hell far better than the gag-inducing Insurrection. It doesn't rank with First Contact in terms of either plot ingenuity or sheer visceral excitement, but it sometimes comes very close.
As far as flaws go, Generations most apparent problem is that, if you've never seen an episode of the TV series, it's hard to familiarize yourself with this new crew. Thus, a lot of the in-jokes and jargon will be completely incomprehensible, and Data's bizarre behavior thanks to his Data chip will probably baffle most viewers. Even I, as a Trek fan, didn't find his newfound emotions all that compelling, in spite of Brent Spiner's best efforts, who delivers an always excellent performance as the likeable android.
The movie does take a while to get going (about a good half-hour), but once it does, it's a mostly gripping adventure, and there's quite a bit of genuinely thrilling action midway, featuring a space battle between the Enterprise and the Klingon bird-of-prey, finally culminating to an absolutely spectacular crash sequence that's easily one of the most exciting scenes of any of the Star Trek films, period.
It's the scenes directly after that, when Picard first enters the Nexus, that tend to drag a bit.  Thankfully, it picks up once Picard meets Kirk. How they meet I won't give away, though it'll be fairly obvious as the film moves along. What they have to say to one another is wryly amusing, especially when Kirk states he feels ""the galaxy owes him one"" for all the heroic deeds he's accomplished, and even rather touching when we see Kirk discuss his past regrets.  For some reason, I used to think this segment was boring, but seeing it again, I've come to the conclusion it's the movie's highlight.
The last ten or so minutes are rather hectic, climaxing with a highly energetic action scene, and finally finishing things with a poignant end for a beloved character. This death scene probably isn't quite as touching as it could have been, but it's effective and emotional enough, given how connected we've been to this guy over the many, many years.
Effects-wise, Generations is first-rate. Sure, the sets aren't really much different than what we saw on the TV series but the space battles are visually captivating and the energy ribbon, entitled the Nexus, is a beautiful sight worth beholding. Dennis McCarthy's score probably goes a little overkill near the end, but it nicely backs up each scene appropriately. Generations is, in the end, an adventure worth watching on its own, but the fact it represents the end of one generation's journey and the beginning of another makes it a must see of sorts.

The movie that ""Passed the Torch"" from the original cast of the Enterprise, to the Next Generation is pivotal to the Star Trek Films. Like Star Trek III, it is almost necessary to see this movie to know why the next movie started the way it did.
The movie has some pretty interesting twists and turns.  The nitpickers had a field day with this one, as in contradicted a couple of key episodes over the progression of the Next Generation series.
Malcolm McDowell, Alex in ""A Clockwork Orange,"" played the villain ""Dr. Soren.""  He was spectacular.  He had great dialogue and is an amazing actor.  He was defiantly a formidable enemy for both Captain Kirk and Picard to face off against . . . and what a price to pay for victory. . .
Overall, this is a pretty good movie.  It is a must for Star Trek fans, and is worth having to complete your set. The effects are great, as they always are, minus the two recycled Klingon Bird of Prey shots (this is a common practice in Star Trek).

With Malcolm McDowell as the lead villain, I expected much more. But instead he is depicted as a crazed scientist with an addiction to return to a portal which only reaches availability on rare occassions.
Speaking of that portal, what a joke. The whole movie is set up around it but it really isn't even something that looks to belong in the film. And trying to merge former Star Trek cast members with current ones sounds good on paper, but I believe Shatner's ego tried to steal the show on this one .... and it didn't look good.
Perhaps the most unforgiving detail here is the explosion of the Klingon ship, it's the EXACT SAME SCENE from the previous Star Trek movie! No new special effects, let's just borrow from the last film?

Woopie Goldberg has some great scenes as a wise and ancient being who must help Picard overcome his own demons.

734723,5,6303909949,"Star Trek: Generations is one of those films you have to watch more than once to really appreciate its impact. I remember seeing this in the theaters, and now on video it's even just as good. There are some things I wish could not have occured: the end of the Enterprise-D, and the passing of the character of Kirk. However, this is only a matter of passing the torch from one captain to the next.
This space adventure involves the crew of the future Enterprise stopping a mad scientist, Dr. Soran, from using a weapon of unknown power to control a space phenomenon known as the Nexus. Picard goes into the Nexus and inevitably finds Captain James T. Kirk, and together the two attempt to stop Soran's plans.
I think it was great to see Kirk and Picard finally meet, and the fight sequence taking place between Soran and Kirk & Picard is a nice touch. Data's laughter also provided some amusement. As I mentioned before, it was unfortunate that the Enterprise-D was a goner in this one, but the new Enterprise that followed in the next sequels (including the upcoming thrill ""Star Trek: Nemesis"") was pretty neat.
Overall, there is a bit of action, and a bit of heart in this warm adventure that many of the Trek fans will undoubtedly love. I know I certainly did. It was also an honorable but sad farewell to one of Star Trek's most beloved characters...Captain Kirk.",1033862400,2,1368,4.587755102040816

734725,3,6303909949,"As much as this movie tries to reach out to an audience beyond Trekkies, it is sad that it is a lost cause. Only Trekkies could appreciate the end of Captain Kirk's legacy, the fate of the Enterprise-D, or Data's new experience with emotions. But that's not to say it's a bad movie. The story is pretty good science-fiction and not-bad Star Trek. A mad scientist, Dr. Soran, is obsessed with getting inside an alternate reality known as the Nexus, and he will stop at nothing in trying to get there. He even devises a (very unbelievable) way of destroying stars to change the course of the rift. The crew of the Enterprise-D chases after Soran in an attempt to stop him from destroying another star. They fail, and Picard is swept into the Nexus. But he enlists the help of Captain Kirk, who got caught in the Nexus 80 years earlier. The meeting of Kirk and Picard is a great moment in Trek history and the two work together to stop Soran. A few scenes with Data discovering emotions are humorous. There is a very good scene between Geordi and Soran. Worf is placed in the far background, though he is promoted at the beginning of the film. Dr. Crusher and Troi are simply there to look nice, which they do well, and Riker is there to bark orders. A film with a cast this big is bound to run into problems in establishing its characters, and this movie has tons of them. But some of the action is exciting and it is great seeing the two best captains on ""Star Trek"" finally meeting and working together. Malcolm McDowell is over-the-top evil as Soran, but he's a very forgettable character.

It aches and lacks some of the ability to laugh at itself that set apart the best of its predecessors (namely ""Search for Spock"" and ""Voyage Home"".

734806,5,6303909949,"Star Trek Generations is simply a great transition movie, handing the torch from Captain Kirk and crew to Captain Picard and crew.  While not living up completely to what we the fans wanted, that doesn't really matter.  That is the case in most of the movies.  Especially the odd numbered ones for some strange cosmic reason.  We all knew the Galaxy Class Enterprise 1701-D had to go.  It was simply not made for the silver screen.  I was personally hoping that more of the original series crew could've made it for the opening sequence.  The scenes between Kirk and Picard were very well done.  If I remember correctly, this was also the first time that we'd heard Captain Sulu's first name.  Patrick Stewart once again showed the depth of his acting abilities with the death of his character's brother and nephew.  It's a little disturbing to see Captain Picard basically recieve a beating from Soren.  After watching Kirk fight many a people and win over the years.  Malcolm McDowell, Soren played a very good, tortured villain.  And yes, Captain Kirk said in Star Trek V The Final Frontier that he always knew he'd die alone.  And that was the case, he was alone in the sense the Spock and McCoy weren't there.  The way Kirk died did seem a little melodramatic for the character.  Overall though, a very good transition movie.  I would suggest that if you'd like a few more of the details, I believe you can still get a copy of the book.

Not too mention the storyline has pathetically cheesy, and everything was exactly like the tv show. The Enterprise D did need to be gotten rid of, due to it didn't translate well onto the big screen. But the way they destroyed her was sad.
They also screwed around too much with data's emotion chip. The idea of data using his tricorder as a puppet is outragous.

734809,3,6303909949,"When I was fifteen, I was so excited to see my favorite Star Trek crew get their own shot at the big screen.  I was disappointed to hear that the baton was not completely passed, and that this film would feature the not-so-eternally-young William Shatner as Captain Kirk.  I watched the movie anyway with much anticipation and excitement.  Back then, I thought it was the best movie I had ever seen.  Now that I'm 22 (more grown up) and I've had a chance to view a more superior film in ""First Contact,"" I must retract my initial reaction and say that ""Generations"" is only okay.
I don't know if anyone else has pointed it out, but this movie has many depressing moments.  The Enterprise B has its problems, Picard faces tragedy, Data gets choked up in his worry about Geordi, the Enterprise D crashes and eventually is blown to bits, and Captain Kirk (as much as I disliked his place in this movie) meets his fate.  There seemed to be no bright side to this movie, no resolution of good truly conquering evil in the end.  The crew of the Enterprise D were left with a mess of wreckage in the end.  Where is the hope in that?
As far as humor goes, it was misplaced all the way through.  Data's first turns with an emotion chip should have been eye-opening, but here they are ridiculous and obnoxious.  Mr. Tricorder?  Oh dear.  Data's character has delivered better funny moments in the television series when his confusion got the better of him.  I think the strongest laugh, and the most brilliant one, comes when Data says a dirty word to become the first TNG character to truly swear.  Nice little touch for shock value anyway.
Patrick Stewart and friends always do well in the acting department and Malcolm McDowell as Soren is a welcome villainous addition to this story.  So I think the trouble lies in the script and the continued push for old Trek cast members.  It was time (pardon the cliche) for a new generation to take over, and it still wasn't fully their turn (not fair).  Giving TNG their own movie would pay off next with ""First Contact,"" an obviously superior journey.
As always, Trek delivers great special effects, but they cannot carry ""Generations.""  It needed more emotional variety, a more clever story (time travel is tired), and an exclusive showcase of TNG characters.",1027728000,3,2296,4.613300492610837
734810,3,6303909949,"Seems like there are two camps as far as ""Star Trek: Generations"" is concerned: you either groove on it or dis it. Well, I'm in with the last lot--here is a movie with a lot of potential that just didn't get fulfilled.
Some seem unhappy with Picard's distress in the early part of the movie when he learns about his brother and nephew's deaths, calling him ""wimpy"". Now, that didn't bother me at all; I thought it was very good acting on Patrick Stewart's part, and since I thought his brother was a crotchety bore the last time I saw him, I wasn't personally grieved myself. NO, that's not where the problems lay.
Problem 1: Data and his memory chip experiment. Why does having emotions have to make him silly? Irritating to watch such jerk behavior. Very un-funny.
Problem 2: The set where Stewart (and later Shatner) battle it out with Malcolm MacDowell is hideous. It was a return to that most odious of Original Cast Trek places, the Rocks Outside the Studio. That's one reason why I hate ""Arena"" and ""Friday's Child"", because of those darn dusty dry-looking rocks that the cast had to scamper across, making an hour-long episode seem interminable. If you want to alienate women viewers in the audience, just place the action on those rocks again. Then, the apparatus the villain has set up seems like a cross between an Erector Set and a sub-grade Fire Escape. It was a very unfitting location for the much-heralded Death of Kirk. Really, when you compare this scene to Death of Spock in ""Star Trek: Wrath of Khan"", it comes up empty. Then, Spock died nobly in some sort of nuclear reactor room after fixing the core or something by hand(although I didn't like the potholders he was wearing)--years ago, I really did cry in the theatre! Since Shatner's egoism is well documented, I'm surprised he went with what happens here. Macho heroics lead to falling down fire escape. Hardly the end of a character of mythic proportions. I think it is also written all over Patrick Stewart's face that he had disdain for Shatner's ego, regardless of whatever he might have said in any interviews at the time. This Kirk was acting in a very self-indulgent way, which would have disgusted the duty-bound Picard, and I think did offend Stewart.
Problem 3: The Nexus Fantasies of Picard and Kirk. Neither of these fantasies were as good as they should have been. Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) explains that being inside the Nexus is like being inside Joy. Why does Picard fantasize about living in a setting suspiciously like ""A Christmas Carol""? And why would such an adventurous individual like Kirk fantasize about cooking eggs? I mean, maybe Picard's has some romance to it, but cooking eggs is joy?! This is how he wants to spend eternity? Not any Kirk I ever saw, in the series or in the movies. Doesn't he usually stop at nothing just to sit on the bridge of the Enterprise?--hint to the screenwriters!
No, ""Generations"" didn't generate what it ought to have for me, or anybody I know.",1025740800,2,2978,4.695984703632887

Kirk, Scotty (James Doohan) and Chekov (Walter Koenig). They each intertwine the history of the Eneterprise B to the new Enterprise D. This is the first film with the Next Generation cast after the series went off the air.

I forcefully tried to accept this movie, on the grounds that I get to see the Enterprise-B, Kirk and Picard working together, and Malcolm McDowell  doing his best as a semi-good enemy.  The more I try, the more it doesn't work.

2. The movie is incredibly dark, and almost all of the scenes are dreary and almost lifeless, nothing like TNG

The premise is pretty lame as well. I never was akin to the idea of a Kirk/Picard team up because they are two very different characters, whith two very different styles, and I grew up in the Picard era (I think I was 7 when the show premiered.) I have a deep love of Star Trek TNG, and DS9 and to be honest I detest the Original for its bad acting and cheesy sound effects. I understand that the show is older than dirt, but still... The Trek movies were pretty good though.. Shatner's bad acting was still present, but he actually did pretty good in this film. What was the most enjoyable part of this movie was Data, as he installs the emotion chip and begins to experiment with humor. Even though a lot of the silliness wouldn't fly in real life it works for this movie because... it doesn't fly in Trek either. The reactions of Data's peers are just as humorous as Data himself.

There's so much potential here, and they blew it. Imagine Kirk putting Picard in his place on the Enterprise bridge: ""Prime Directive-Smime Directive, let's go..."" Instead, this clumsy film seems to go out of its way to devise a plausable (at least Star Trek-plausable) reason for the two generations to collide.

The disc is THX ertified, and the colors are brighter than those on the Generations Laser Disc. Where the film falls short in the visual department, it more than redeems itself in the sound department.

2. What does smashing the Enterprise-D add to the movie?

Kirk (William Shatner the man) teamed with the very strict and strong Captain Jean-Luc Picard(Patrick Stewart, a marvelous Shakespearian actor). When the diabolical Dr. Soran (Malcom McDowell from ""The Clockwork Orange"") plans a scheme that will bring closer to an energy ribbon known as the Nexus that will include the destruction of the Enterprise, and millions of lives, Picard's only hope is to join forces with Kirk to save the day. A very appealing movie that was a huge milestone for ""The Next Generation"" cast, and Brent Spiner (the android Data) who steals the movie as his character is given an emotion chip to allow him to be more human! I'm very sure Gene Roddenberry(the creator of Star Trek) would have been very emotional to see both his greatest creations grace the screen so well. I know I was.",1008201600,4,953,4.644970414201183

""Windows 95"" was merely an ugly rumor, ""Hammer"" still had a career, and Paramount studios, in a blatant attempt to add another cash car to the Star Trek money train, unleashed the movie: ""Star Trek: Generations"". A film bereft of any original ideas at all, it suffered from the same problem so many ""Next Generation"" episodes had; that is, the ending was pre-determined (Kirk must die in order to neuter the original cast out of any more motion pictures), so all events leading up to the ending seem especially forced and uninspired. We watched both Data and Picard break down and cry. Troi steered the Enterprise-D into the side of a planet. Kirk died in the worst death scene of all time.

Patrick Stewart's performance in this film also seems more powerful and enjoyable than in the series.  Another excellent part of this film is the villain.  Malcolm McDowall is wonderful as Dr. Soran.  He's one of the best villians in the Star Trek film series, and certainly better than any seen in the Next Generation television series.  William Shatner's final return as Captain Kirk is also wonderful to see.  As for the flaws, the main one has to be the film's humor.  To summarize in one word: it's bad.  Very bad!

The less-than-entertaining slapstick and over-emphasized emotions did more to detract from the plot and aggravate frequent TNG viewers than any positive effect that they may have created.

I loved the ship during the run of the TNG series, and was sad to see it destroyed. But we all have to admit the battle scene between the Klingon Battle Cruiser and the Enterprise was awesome. And of course the second one is the death of Captain Kirk and the passing of the torch onto the new ""generation"" of the Enterprise crew. I feel that Kirk had to die, because he had cheated death for so long, and it was only fitting that the last time you will see captain Kirk onsceen is him dying a hero's death. it was very noble and very fitting. and if you are familar with the novels, Kirk is actually brought back to life with Borg technology, so if you are a fan of Kirk it might be worth checking out.

734975,3,6303909949,"""Star Trek Generations"" is the passing of the torch film that Trek fans had been salivating for since The Next Generation series began.  It is a well produced and entertaining film but it is not a great ""Star Trek"" film.  It begins in the 23rd century as Kirk, Scotty and Chekov are giving an inspection of a new Enterprise vessel with a young and inexperienced crew.  An emergency arises as the ship is caught in an energy ribbon and the old crew jump to action.
After rescuing several refugees from a Borg attack, the crew of the Enterprise discovers that Kirk has been caught in a temporal anomaly and is presumed dead.  Still there?  Good.  The story then jumps 70 years to the ""Next Generation"" era of the 24th century where Picard, Data, and the Enterprise crew are giving the Klingon Worf a bizarre promotion.
The rest of the story involves an obsessed scientist who was one of the alien refugees rescued by the Enterprise B in the 23rd century.  He is bent on ""steering"" the energy ribbon toward a desolate planet in the far reaches of space by imploding several stars and changing the gravitational flow of space.  This results in the destruction of planets and anyone who may live on them.  Picard discovers that the scientist is trying to reach a temporal ""Nexus"" which resides in the energy ribbon.  The Nexus is blissful place where your most wonderful dreams come true.
While the Enterprise trys to stop the scientist, Picard himself is thrown into the Nexus and finds James T. Kirk alive and well and chopping wood.  What results is an interesting display of character between Picard and Kirk as Picard trys to convice Kirk to leave this temporal Nexus and join him in stopping an evil scientist and saving millions of lives.
Kirk and Picard have suprising chemistry and it would have been a better film if Kirk had been present more than just the book-ends of the film.  But what is unforgivable is what happens to Kirk in his adventure with Picard.  Everyone knows by know that Kirk dies at the end of the film.  I don't have a problem with that, what I do have a problem with is the way he perished.  In Star Trek II, Spock makes a decision to sacrifice himself for the good of the crew.  In ""Generations"" Kirk, the most heroic Star Trek character of them all, dies as the result of an accident.  Not at the hands of the evil scientist or a noble effort on Kirk's part, but a big stupid clumsy mistake.  Kirk's character should have been treated with more respect by the Next Gerneration writing staff than this.  His death was there only for the purpose of letting the Next Gen crew have it's own spotlight in the upcoming sequels, I guess I can't really argue there.
""Generations"" is the most confusing Trek entry, but not the worst classic Trek or Next Gen outing.  Like ""The Motion Picture"" years before it serves as an adequate first film for a great TV series.",971481600,4,2884,4.5523255813953485

He always comes up withe pretty funny one liners (after opening a magnetically-sealed door with his axial-servo, he says ""You could say, I have a magnetic personality.""). The down-side of this film is several things:
1) The Enterprise NCC-1701-D is destroyed. That was by far the second greatest ship to bear that name (NCC-1701-A was the best). Still, they brought an even better Enterprise for STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT. 2) Picard's brother and nephew are killed in a fire. It shows that Picard, who we've seen as a person who wouldn't show almost any emotion, has a soft spot. It really shows how great Stewart is as an actor. 3) Captain Kirk, the best character in all of the STAR TREK films, dies. This was the part of the film I hated the most.

It's about a mad scientist called Dr.  Tolian Soren (Malcolm McDowel who does a brilliant performance) who wants  to return to a place called the Nexus. It is place were dreams become  realities, those who go there never want to leave. In order to do that he  must make the gatway to the Nexus (An energy ribbon)come to him by  destroying stars. Because any other way results in catastrophe.
The movie  starts when Kirk is swept away in the Nexus on a rescue mission with the  Enterprise-B. Later Picard and company find out about Soran's plans but  fail. The Enterprise-D is destroyed and Soran and Picard are swept into the  Nexus. Picard finds Kirk to help him and they go back in time for a final  showdown against Soran. Who wins? You'll have to find out when you watch  the movie. Data also uses his emotion chip for the first time.

But what I want to know is why did Paramount decide not to include the trailer's of this film onto the DVD? I know Trek fans have been rather  disappointed in the slim pickens of Special Features for all Star Trek  films as well as the original TV series, but what I don't get is that all  the other films come with a trailer(s) and 'Generations does not.  Why?  'First Contact was the first Star Trek DVD released and it has both the  teaser and theatrical trailer included.  Paramount should be giving us what  we want and that is audio commentarries with cast and crew and maybe a  special one with the directors, deleted scenes either restored or put  aside, isolated score's, Trek games you could play with your remote  control, DVD-ROM features, cast and crew bios, production notes, and  finally, a making of or documentary feature.

This movie has its good moments. Brent Spiner shines in the film, and Patrick Stewart somehow makes even the hokey parts seem passable. But it's when  these two are offscreen that we miss them most, for the movie's concept is  so terrible that any distraction from it is a blessing.
Like Trek V and  Insurrection, Generations plays like an episode. Actually it plays a lot  like the lame 7th-season episodes that just preceded it. A madman intent on  returning to his own personal paradise decides to kill millions of  people--not much of a movie plot, all things considered.
Taking the  movie's worst moments one by one, the failure of the writers is astounding.  When under attack by a significantly smaller vessel that can penetrate  their shields, the Enterprise bridge crew don't remodulate the shields  (practically the first resort of every episode from the 4th season on), nor  fire back, nor make significant evasive maneuvers; they just sit there and  get hit again and again while scratching their heads. An engineer who has  saved the ship hundreds of times can't manage to do it even after the  crisis has been over for five minutes.

Although the film suffers a bit in inspiration, mainly due to the fact that this was made more as a vehical to get the captains together than for any other reason, it is still deep and action-packed.
There are some truly magical moments in Generations.  Most of these scenes are played by Shatner, who cleanly and deftly steals the show. Scenes on the bridge with Chekov (""No, you were younger) and the way Kirk reacts to the captain's chair; knowing that his time has past but longing to stay there.  These are priceless Trek moments and great Kirk-defining scenes.  Shatner and Stewart fighting together was cool, but the simple discussion they have about life while on horseback is the defining moment of the film.
Add to this awesome special effects, Malcom MacDowell in the typical obsessive madman role, some great philosophy about how every moment in our lives is precious, and a crash landed Enterprise and you are in great shape!  There'a a great balance of humor, adventure, and science-fiction.  It plays out like an epic tale that only Star Trek could tell.

735072,3,6303909949,"This is the seventh entry in the ""Star Trek"" series and probably the last featuring members of the original cast. It draws on what has gone before, and also heads off into the future, as the torch is passed from captain to  captain, from one generation to another.
The story begins with the maiden  voyage of the Starship Enterprise B. Captain James T. Kirk (William  Shatner) is aboard as a visiting dignitary, while an inexperienced Captain  takes command. Their brief media tour is interrupted, though, when the ship  receives an emergency distress call. They respond to the location of a huge  ribbon of electromagnetic energy-a rift in the space-time continuum-and  rescue the survivors from their doomed ship. Among them are the crazed Dr.  Soran (Malcolm McDowell) and the mysterious Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg).
The  action resumes seventy-five years later where the Enterprise D, under the  command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), is also responding to  a distress call, this time on a research station. The Enterprise's crew  rescues the few aboard who are left alive. Not coincidentally, one of the  survivors is again Dr. Soran.
As Guinan explains to Capt. Picard, Soran  is a resident of the Nexus-that mysterious floating ribbon of energy.  Within the Nexus is contained the essence of pure joy and contentment, a  veritable nirvana where space and time are one. Soran will do anything to  get back there, even if it means killing millions of innocent people.
The  bulk of the plot deals with the crew's attempts to stop Dr. Soran.  Contained within that framework, though, are a few quieter, more personal  stories that really make this film worth watching. One involves Picard and  a crisis in his family. Another concerns Data (Brent Spiner) and his  attempt to become more human. Best of all, though, is the segment featuring  Kirk, his feelings about his life, and his desire to pass on the mantle of  Captain to Picard.
Although the acting and technical aspects in  ""Generations"" are both top notch, the writing and directing both leave  something to be desired. The filmmakers responsible for the movie are  veterans of the television show and it shows, sometimes painfully.
This  is a movie that will appeal most to ""Star Trek"" fans. Those unfamiliar with  the series may still enjoy it, but they might have a little trouble at  times understanding some of what is going on.

  To understand Star  Trek you have to understand who this man is and how much he would risk for  his crew and this not just a movie it's  a tribute to him and everything he  has done up to the emtional but worthy climax of Gerations while foucusing  around the Next Genration crew and how the Captain must work together to  stop the nexus when the rewiers trashed on this movie they never stopped to  realize that this film is Kirks and that with out Kirk and his crew there  would be no Star Trek ther would be no franchise but that to all things  that begin there must be an end and in this movie the message that Kirk  sent will live on now and forever it may not a masterpeice but is sure is  enough to show what this man lived for and in this alone is worth buying  this DVD to being with The Motion Picture and to say a farwell in  Generations its a fun film as well being emotional.",958780800,,1603,3.9158878504672896
735074,3,6303909949,"The basic problem I had with this film was the almost total lack of an emotional core.  Take, for example, the most important moment in the film, the death of Captain Kirk.  I was totally unmoved.  When Spock died in The  Wrath Of Khan, the audience was affected because they saw it through Kirk's  eyes.  Kirk's line, ""Of all the souls I have encountered in my  travels, his was the most human"" still gets me every time.  But Picard  has just met Kirk and really knows about him only through history,  therefore the scene has no emotional resonance.  Basically, the problem  boils down to the plot, or lack thereof.  The ""nexus"" storyline  is merely a gimmick to get the Kirk into the Next Generation timeframe, and  the circumstances are NOT entertaining enough to get this viewer to suspend  his disbelief.  Also, the death of Picard's brother and nephew was an  uneeded plot contrivance which casts a pall over the entire film.
On  the positive side, this film is visually spectacular.  The special effects  are awesome, especially the destruction of the Enterprise-D.  Also, the  lighting in this film is truly breathtaking.  Abandoning Next Generation's  more flat approach to lighting, the Enterprise-D is bathed in butterscotch  hues during the first third of the film as she orbits the Amargosa star.  Although many Trek fans have faulted Dennis McCarthy's score, I thought is  served the film well.  The acting is uniformly fine throughout, including  the much maligned William Shatner who seems more relaxed than usual.
Paramount's DVD transfer is excellent, with no color bleeding despite  the vivid hues.  The sound will rock your home to it's foundations,  particularly during the Enterprise-B sequence and the destruction of the  Enterprise-D.",958262400,4,1758,5.052631578947368
735195,3,6303909949,"The trouble with Star Trek films is that the franchise has some of the hardest-to-please customers in the world. Even if a Star Trek film is very good, some fans cannot EVER be satisfied. If I used one word to describe 'Generations' it would be 'courage'. Courage from the producers to make  bold changes to the Star Trek universe by killing off a major, iconic  character and major supporting characters, and destroying the starship  Enterprise.

There is a sub-text of honor and sacrifice within the story and  the strong message that time and change need not be an enemy to fear, but a  journey to embrace. Phew! That's the metaphysical aspect done. What's the  movie like? You know, 'Generations' has an epic, sweeping feel to it that a  lot of the other Star Trek films lack. Oh sure, there is the creaky 'space  anomaly/time travel' chestnut again that contrives to unite Kirk and  Picard, but once you get over that there is the elegiac quality of their  joint odyssey and quest to 'save the galaxy' ... AGAIN!

And the film makes  the powerful point that no matter how much we want it, an illusory paradise is just that: An illusion. And that perhaps paradise can only be earned  after a well-lived life. So here we come to Bill Shatner's Captain Kirk: a  character who thrives on making a difference whether its saving one planet  or millions. And that when someone has discovered new worlds and new  civilisations, then the only country left to discover is the Undiscovered  Country of death. Some have accused Generations of being an overblown TV  episode. I'll allow that only if you consider that THAT criticism has been  levelled at nearly ALL the Star Trek films. So BULLDUST I say to that accusation!

I say to you that NO other Trek film is as well-photographed,  has as many locations, makes so many changes to it's own folklore and asks  for your loyalty like this one. Generations looks like a much bigger budget film than it is, do you hear? A MOTION PICTURE in every sense of the word and if you keep seeing 'TV' then you're stuck someplace you shouldn't be.  But in momentary defense of that opinion, with the exception of 'The Wrath  Of Khan' and 'The Voyage Home' I've yet to see a Trek movie as good as the  best 'Next Generation' or 'Deep Space Nine' episodes. Paramount should be  making movies as good as 'The Best Of Both Worlds' or The Dominion War story arc.

'Generations' succeeds on it's own terms with fine performances  from Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner, Malcolm McDowell and William Shatner. I  would say, though, that Kirk's death scene was a bit underwhelming, unlike  Spock's which was near-operatic. Another criticism is that Kirk's last  chance for an epic fist-fight was blown with a far too-brief clash between  Kirk and Soran. Best bits of the film: Lovely cinematography, special  effects, music score and Jonathan Frakes as Riker having the good sense to  look frightened stiff during the crash of the Enterprise!",955152000,8,2962,4.741176470588235
735196,2,6303909949,"This film was a dissappointment from the start.  When The Motion Picture debuted in 1979 viewers were treated to an epic adventure 10 years after the original series.  Generations however seemed ""rushed"" to be  filmed barely a few months after the end of the next generation.  The  direction and the score were absolutely boring.  It seemed too much like  and extremely elongated television episode.  The first 6 films focused on  the crews relationships as well as the conflict.  Not to mention the  direction and the score kept everyone on the edge of their seats.  This  film did not even come close to being cinematic.  The opening scenes for  Picard's crew aboard the ship confuses many who have never seen the show.  In the Motion Picture at least we got an insight into what everyone was  doing before we saw the entire crew united.  In Generations however, we go  from seeing the Enterprise B damaged to an unexciting view of Picard and  his crew on a boat.  Kirks death scene wasn't dramatic enough.  I felt that  someone who had been at the helm of the Enterprise for so many years could  have died a better death than having a bridge collapse and the being buried  on a desolate planet under some old rocks.  The scenes with the Klingons  did not at all seem theatrical the way the previous films did.  The  direction of the ships on camera were boring and again seemed to be fit for  television and not the big screen.

The result is a convuluted extended TV episode,a very  irksome Data,an impressive yet unnessesary destruction of Enterprise D ,and  a very shoddy death of our beloved Capt Kirk. At first I liked it ,but  thought it could've been better(Hey it's a start).As time went on it hasn't  worn well,feeling more & more like it was made to manipulate fan  expectation.

It was a clever and almost devious way to have Kirk and Piccard in the same movie.  The space battle was far better than in ST VI.  All in all, the movie  advanced the characters of The Next Generation for the future movies, but  also managed to tell a good story.

735203,3,6303909949,"The film could have (and should have) been better.  Especially since it was written by Ron Moore and Brannon Bragga who wrote the far-superior follow-up ""First Contact"" 2 years later.
The films good  points: excellent special effects, fine acting, and an engaging musical  score (especially for Dennis McCarthy, a television composer).  I  especially enjoyed seeing the Enterprise crashing into the planet's  surface-something I have always wanted to see in a ""Star Trek""  film (I was also pleased to see that cruise ship trashed).  I also enjoyed  Picard's speech at the end concering our own mortality.
The negative  points: as was the case with ""The Next Generation"" TV show (and  now with ""Voyager"" and ""Insurrection"") this film  utilized a great deal of techno-babble.  The subplot involving Data's  emotion chip was pointless but I was strongly  amused with his profane  reaction to the Enterprise being in danger.
Regarding Kirk, I can't  help but feel as if the film would have been more dramatic if Kirk's  idealized life in the Nexus had involved a life with his son David whom he  never really knew until shortly before his untimely death in  ""ST3"".  Imagine Picard trying to pull Kirk away from that.
I  was also disappointed with the fact that Kirk didn't interact with other  ""Next Generation"" members other than Picard. Finally Kirk's death  (no surprise-everyone knew about it long before the scene was even filmed)  just wasn't dramatic enough. Despite all of the films flaws, the film was  enjoyable-heck, it was still better than ""Final Frontier"" and  ""Motion Picture"".",939340800,,1588,5.1015625
735294,4,6303909949,"I thought this movie was too much for an audience who doesn't know a lot about the characters and their background. Like, most people wouldn't know who Picards brother is, or how close a friendship Picard and Guinan had.  The real messed-up part was that in ST:5, Kirk says ""I've always known  I'll die alone"" but they couldn't even live up to that in the movie,  he died next to Picard. Altogether it was a great movie with Lore's emotion  chip in Data and what goes on when he has it.",935280000,,486,4.3076923076923075
735295,1,6303909949,"Do you really mean to tell me Captain Kirk would be stuck in a wave for eighty years and not realize this fact until Picard came along and told him?  If part of Guinan is in the wave (indeed, it's she who instructs  Picard) wouldn't she have alerted Kirk to this fact as well?  How come  Captain Picard didn't tell anyone what happened between him and Kirk,  leaving him buried under some rocks?  Wouldn't a legend like Kirk deserve  an official funeral?  Of course there's a real question as to whether Kirk  is really dead since part of him is in the wave.  Ultimately the entire  premise of this film makes no sense.  Mr. Scott is alive and well and  living in the time of the Next Generation cast due to having been caught in  a damaged transporter.  The first words out of his mouth when Geordi  rescued him were, ""I thought Jim Kirk had come to find me.""  How  is this possible when Scotty is right there on the Enterprise when Kirk  gets pulled into the wave?  It's possible because the current producers of  Star Trek don't respect the tradition and storylines of their own  franchise.  This film is a travesty that I don't give any validity to.  One  can only hope that said producers correct their mistake and return Kirk to  life in his own time.",929145600,10,1257,4.4035087719298245

The 7th Star Trek Motion Picture was the best opportunity to make all that happen, but they ( directors and  producers ) spoiled it. The two captains met in a very silly situation,  without sufficient acction to keep the attention of the audience,the great  Cap. Kirk's death falling down the stairs was an insult to the character;  when you see the example of Cap. Sheridan's death on the last episode of  Babylon5 you will see what should have been done with Kirk. The only good  scene of this movie is the sequence of the destruction of the Entrepise D.

735297,4,6303909949,"""Generations"" is a great movie with a solid story and lots of action. Though flawed, it is a great adventure for Trek fans, at the very least. The opening scenes with Kirk, Scott and Chekov are tense, with the  audience rooting for Kirk to take command of the Enterprise (version 'B')  one last time. One almost wishes that the original crew (Spock, McCoy,  etc.) could have made an appearance and stuck around for most of the film.  But, alas, this was really a ""Next Generation"" film, their first,  and they took over for most of the remainder of the picture. The ""Next  Generation"" crew, with a bit less chemistry and more blandness than  the original (""classic"") bunch, still managed to provide the  audience with a crackerjack adventure. The scenes with Kirk and Picard were  awkward and made this viewer quite uncomfortable. Shatner's acting in these  scenes didn't quite ring true, and somewhat marred the historic meeting  between the two famous Captains of the U.S.S. Enterprise. On the other  hand, Kirk's death scene was touching, bringing to an end a career which  began with ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"", the Classic Trek pilot  that introduced Captain Kirk. ""It was fun"". PS- The music was  sensational, as well.",928022400,,1228,4.8647342995169085
735408,4,6303909949,"In contrast to most other people who have seen this film - I love it! Generations is a particulary dark and depressing film dealing with themes of death and being taken away from loved ones.
Let's start with what's  bad about it. William Shatner certainly lost it in this film, especially at  the end - his final words are a joke. Most of the characters don't get a  look in - only really Picard and Data.
The good parts of this film come  from Malcolm McDowell for playing an excellent Trek villan - miles better  than the bad guys in Insurrection. Some of the action/special effects  sequences are superb, particulary the crash sequence - turn up the  volume!
Thematically, it brings up some interesting questions about the  Nexus (being inside Joy) but they are not properly explored.
As for the  DVD itself. There aren't any extras to speak of (although there are rumours  of a restored version with extra footage. e.g. Geordi being tortured by  Soran and Kirk et all on a planet at the start) The picture quality is  excellent - surpassing the laserdisc. It's a very colourful film, not like  First Contact and the disc handles it well. The only motion artefacts  you'll notice are on Brent Spiner's (Data) wrinkles when we see the emotion  chip for the first time. Definition, for example, the mountain range on  Veridian 3 is terrific. The Dolby Surround soundtrack is also top notch  (although I don't know about Dolby Digital)
Although most people prefer  First Contact, this film is a lot deeper and relies less on cheap thrills.  A very good disc.",923788800,,1558,4.703703703703703
