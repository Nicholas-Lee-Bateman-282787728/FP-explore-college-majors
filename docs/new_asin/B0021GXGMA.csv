3831936,5,B0021GXGMA,"Saw this movie trailer on YouTube and it immediately captured my interest!! It took forever to come to stores to buy and I had to really look all over town to find it. Sauna is trully a sinister and gothic movie. Everything is so dark and gloomy as well as the character brothers Eerik and Knut. Even though Eerik looks harmless with his glasses and quiet demeanor, he is unpredictable and dangerous. The other parts that scared me a little were of the woman spirit that would haunt Knut in different parts of the movie. For anyone who enjoys foreign films and doesn't mind the subtitles, I would recommend this film. A.J Annila is like M. Night Shyamalan in the sense of how his films are a little intriguing but interesting and different.",1262822400,7,740,4.571428571428571
3831937,5,B0021GXGMA,"Every once in a while I manage to find a dvd that is absolutely worth viewing-this is one among them. I have watched this dvd six times already, and each time the sense of the horror becomes more and more pronounced. The dvd is in the same meld as Bergman's Hour of the Wolf, or The Serpent's Egg, or The Seventh Seal, (the lead actor, Ville Virtanen, has resemblence to Max Von Sydow.) yet laying out the psychological horror far more explicitly and unrelentingly, finally at the end spilling it forth without restraint in the emotionally raw screams and yells that are totally nightmarish (one thinks of the final revelation in Heart of Darkness, when Kurtz utters his final words, "" The horror. The horror!""). This dvd is a the telling of a story with the elements of horrific nightmares - it certainly does clinch the viewer, and by the end, you are left starring at the screen with these screams sinking into your mind. Excellent!!!

I won't spoil it for you; but, the period allegory is a condemnation of modern  political government which requires giving up one's soul to the State. This story is pretty deep with a clear existential thread running throughout, posing questions which every individual will someday have to answer. It is a story of the social, individual and spiritual consequences of war, the fragmentation of identity, of memory for the sake of survival, and more deeply, the soul, leaving the individual a moral invalid - inhuman. There is no salvation from having to face one's own inhumanity to others, eventually one must face the moments of his lack of compassion and concern for the welfare of others! Very fatalistic - just buy it, rent it, and enjoy this experience of a nightmare the message of which is as relevant today as for any historical period.",1249344000,14,1784,4.751612903225807
3831938,1,B0021GXGMA,"I also saw it on demand (they gave a free view)mainly because my wife is from Finland and being in our sixties we had nothing better to do.
We both found this film as incomprhensible as the Finnish language, and she is fluent in finnish.",1243296000,,237,4.288888888888889
3831939,4,B0021GXGMA,"Remarkable in its abilty to immerse one in a cloying atmosphere of foreboding and dread. Most of the film's eeriest vibes are masterfully crafted through dialogue, as opposed to hollow jump scares and viscera.  To simplify: Tarkovsky(Stalker, in particular) via J-Horror tropes. By raising more questions than it answers, it ultimately lingers with the viewer; a feat achieved, no doubt, by the director's design. Production values, photography and performances are all of high caliber. Certainly not a film for the ADD multiplex crowd, though...",1238889600,6,546,5.5
3831940,5,B0021GXGMA,"I wish more horror movies in the US were like this one.  It was a chilling, terrifying, and lingering experience.  A translation into Region 1 format is a must.  We watched it on ""OnDemand"" and were hoping to buy it here.  Bravo!",1238284800,2,229,4.380952380952381
3831941,5,B0021GXGMA,"This movie is magnificent. If you consider yourself a student of film on any level, this one should be in your library. There is no other like it.",1411948800,,146,4.25
3831942,5,B0021GXGMA,"Sauna is the most atmospheric horror film I have ever seen. Its actors are outstanding, and the cinematography and set design are perfect. I cant recommend this movie enough. This is not your typical horror movie. It is intelligent, and it expects much from the viewer. The first time I watched it, I was very unsure how I felt, but the ending stuck with me for me days. The movies dark atmosphere and enigmatic tone brought me back for a second viewing, and all my uncertainties were put to rest. Sauna is an extremely taut film; so much character depth is presented in brief scenes. If you pay attention, you will appreciate every aspect of Sauna. It explores the psychological and spiritual hell of war and remembrance.

Sauna is definitely one of my favorite horror films. It artfully deals with themes of morality, war, history, salvation, and damnation. It is frightening because of its dark, oppressive atmosphere, not because of gimmicky jump-out gotcha momentswhich seems to be all most horror films are anymore. In Sauna, the horrors these men encounter are monsters of their own making.",1400544000,5,1097,4.897849462365591
3831943,5,B0021GXGMA,"Its hard to find a movie that leaves an impression on me but I have found one. I reccomend not watching the trailer as it does ruin the movie (trailer fail) but I can guarantee that all the time it invests in building up that tension is definitely worth it. It does what horror movies won't anymore- and that is build an atmosphere. I would call this more of a psychological thriller than a horror film, but even so, this movie will stay with you.",1329696000,,447,4.270588235294118
3831944,2,B0021GXGMA,"The movie could have been so much better with a little more information.  A group discovers a town in the middle of a swamp near a sauna.  The town has no children, except one.  The head of the town states the town has 70+ people; yet only a handfull is shown.  When the group tries to question the people about the town they don't remember much.  I suppose the ""mystery"" or ""unknown"" factor is suppose to be eerie or something to that effect.  Also, the film doesn't show or explain what happened to the guy who dug his eyes out and ate his tongue.  It never tells us what happens.  It doesn't show it either (not alot of gore to be seen).  And no, I don't watch a movie for gore but if I am not going to get any information about the story I might as well be shown something to look at.  Erik calls people who worship certain religions ""traitors""; yet, his beef against religion is not explained.  Knut locks a girl in the celler to protect her yet he fancies her (according to Erik).  So just who was Knut protecting her from?  Ericks physical brutality or his lust for her.

The who movie is about Erik atoning for the 75 people he has killed.  His brother seems to be possessed or gone a little batty..whichever way...the ending could have been a bit more cohesive.  And I guess to make this a ""horror"" type movie they threw in some white ghosts with black features (much like the ones seen numberous movies before this one) who move in jerky motions.

The setting was nice and desolate.  The colors were muted and subdued.  The acting was well done.  I could have done without the shot of Erik's willie in the bathroom.  However, the story needed more work and by work details need to be given.",1327276800,2,1700,4.333333333333333
3831945,4,B0021GXGMA,"I really enjoyed this one. It's one of those films that you need to watch more than once. The first time I saw it, I felt lost at the end. When I watched it again, I noticed so many small details that I missed the first time around. The acting, atmosphere and score worked together to create a wonderfully creepy, thought-provoking film.",1326758400,5,337,4.451612903225806
3831946,3,B0021GXGMA,"This is by no means a bad movie, but at the end of the day it doesn't quite hang together.

Here's the scoop. It's the close of the 16th century. The Russian's, Fins and Swedes have just finished a 25 year war with each other. A small surveying party embarks on a mission to map out whose territory is whose. They stumble across a small hamlet in the middle of a swamp and things aren't quite as they seem. Something is wrong and the party begins to unravel.

This movie benefits from a few things. First is the time and place. I never knew there WAS a 25 year war involving these three countries, and I doubt anyone who is not a scholar of this chunk of history has any idea what life was like in this time and place, so the viewer is thrust into a mysterious world right from the get-go. Then the landscape changes. These guys are in the middle of nowhere and Knut's (one of the surveying team) compass starts acting up. The viewer gets the sense of being lost in an otherworldly place not unlike ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""The Objective."" It IS unsettling. Then there are a few things that happen (which I won't spoil) that turn the creepy dial up to eleven.

The town they come upon is weird in that it's in the middle of nowhere and it's particularly well kept as are its inhabitants. Where are the kids? There aren't any save for one young teen who might be a boy or a girl (depending on who you talk to).

Where it fails is in not getting to know the characters and their histories well enough. We know the surveyors are Swedes, but what of the others in the troop? Russians? Fins? Both? Why does Erik seem to be the big dude and and why is he so hostile toward everyone? Why the extreme hatred of religion and those who believe? Why does he leave the girl to die in the root cellar? Maybe I missed something but I doubt it. I have to point the finger at the writer and director.

This is a decent watch for a lot of reasons but in the end it needed more.",1312243200,,1966,4.176781002638522
3831947,3,B0021GXGMA,I got this to see more of the country and films of Finland- where my husband is from.  He doesn't really care for the movie.  I thought it was OK.  It's a bit drawn out and slow until the end.  Nice scenery though.  You really get a sense of how people used to live in remote areas there.,1296259200,,288,3.896551724137931
3831948,4,B0021GXGMA,"Strikingly beautiful Finnish art house 'horror' film about guilt,
religion, sin and punishment, set in the 16th century, at the end of
the Russian/Swedish war.

It's full of atmosphere, symbolism, and unanswered questions. Two
Swedish brothers/soldiers -- one intellectual, the other violent and
borderline mad -- come to a strange town where they are confronted with
eerie reminders of their sins, and of those they have killed in war.

Slow paced, but not boring. However, the underlying ideas do get
stretched a bit thin over time, and the occasional turn to horror
clichs was a little disappointing given the generally high level of
intelligence and originality.

Mention also must be made of the arresting performance by Ville
Virtanen as the violent Eerik, recalling Max Von Sydow in his prime.

Interesting enough that I would give it another look now that I
understand what its getting at, and gorgeous enough that I'll still
enjoy it, even if I'm once again left with mixed feelings about some of the
content.",1294876800,2,1018,5.041666666666667
3831949,5,B0021GXGMA,"This is a great movie! Now that that is out of the way allow me to explain why you should see this movie. In my opinion it further highlights the weak points of American horror films. I love the creepy atmospheric tension that builds up from the first violent scene to the calm before the finale. I love horror films that are more than just formulaic slasher films (if that's what you're into, no problem). Sure there are plenty of scary scenes, but I think this is a much more cerebal horror film than the usual mainstream fair. And I love the bleak cinematography of the film! I really liked the characters of the two brothers, and I appreciate how they are more than two dimensional. Yes, they are not entirely ""good"", but they are not entirely evil either. Can the unforgivable be forgiven? Watch, enjoy, and decide for yourself.",1280016000,,833,4.56
3831950,4,B0021GXGMA,"I just finished watching this movie. And I must say that it is a very good horror movie. Now for many horror fans this might not be what they expect, there is no cheap scares, I did not jump once. There is hardly any gore and the plot moves very slowly. Now this is both a good thing and a bad thing. In a way the plot of the movie would not work if it moved faster, but there is a thin line between artistic buildup and boredom and at times this movie crosses that line. But overall the peacing is great. Visually this film is a feast for the eyes. It is set in a very gritty, war torn land and it has this great, dark dreary atmosphere.

The characters in this movies is wonderful. Without spoiling to much I will say that the plot is about two Swedish brothers who after a long and bloody war between Sweden and Russia is over is set together with a Russian party to draw up new borders for the two nations. Both brothers are troubled by what they have seen and done in the war. Eerik the older brother had killed 73 pepole and Knut the younger brother have locked a young girl in a cellar and left her there. The brothers begin to see ghostly apparitions of the pepole they have hurt. The film is about sin and forgiveness, but not really in the classic Christian sense. The story is gripping, unfortunately I feel that the ending was to abrupt and leaves to many questions unanswered. I do not feel like I have watched a complete story, and that cost the movie the fifth star. The ending was weak compared to the rest of the film which is excellent.

I should also mention that while this is not a creature feature, and it is not heavy on special effects. The film do have the most creepy monsters I have seen on film since Silent Hill. It is really rare for the designers of a film to really manage to make something creepy, but the faceless sauna demons (Or whatever they are, this is never explained.) are really excellent. Many movies have gross,impressive, cool, creative, shocking monsters but few manages to make some which are really creepy. For those few scenes alone which features the faceless sauna demons you should get this movies. Those monsters alone is worth the price of the film for any horror fan.

If you are in the mood for a different, moody and rather artistic horror movie which takes it's time getting there but who have beautiful visuals and great characters along the way, then I can definitely recommend this film. It's ending is flawed but it is still a top notch film.",1274659200,,2504,4.357601713062098

8348983,1,B0021GXGMA,"Again, no English dub, no watch.

I'm not 100% opposed to watching movies subtitled.  I can't tell you how many countless Anime I watched subbed back in the day due to the limitations and format constraints of the time (VHS was only able to offer one audio track).  But once DVD's were introduced (then Blu-ray, streaming, et al), I find no excuse not to offer/create multiple language tracks in any territory studios provide movies in.  I do not want to divert my eyes from the cinematography to read lines of dialog.  And for those who don't mind this, and are so good at it that it doesn't take away from their movie watching experience, great for you.  You can consider yourself better than me.  I'll stick to my dubs, thank you.  And for those who feel I'm missing out on some great films due to a limited viewpoint, take comfort.  There are more movies out there than one can watch in a lifetime, other great movies, in English, or dubbed in English, and I'll spend my time watching those instead.  I'm entitled to my own opinion and preferences, and I'll continue to support film studios who demonstrate care for my enjoyment, providing English dubs.

Amazon needs to do a better job of labeling movies that only offer English subtitles with no dub.  They do so on some, but not on others; why?  One only has to read other similar reviews on countless movies on their site to see that this frustrates many of their customers, not just me.

As for the movie, if they make an English dub, or offer one in the future, I'll watch it and adjust my rating.  Until then, the one star is for Amazon's lack of clear labeling.",1494720000,,1623,4.491467576791809
