6429623,5,B00KHW4XDQ,"Everybody loves a good love story -- happy ones, sad ones, long ones, short ones, real ones and fictional ones.

And for some reasons, love stories are always more potent in the past. So we get ""Romance Classics,"" which packages together three miniseries -- one adaptation of a classic Jane Austen novel, and two historical tales of royal romance with very different outcomes. These are rich, detailed dramas, with lots of elegant period clothing and expansive palaces.

""Pride and Prejudice"": The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley (Crispin Bonham-Carter) moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to eldest daughter Jane (Susannah Harker). But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie (Jennifer Ehle) immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth), who scorns the rural village. A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships arrive, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham (Adrian Lukis), who claims to have been wronged by Darcy.

Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her. And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia (Julia Sawalha) elopes with Wickham! The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie.

""Victoria and Albert"" takes us to the sheltered girlhood of Victoria (Victoria Hamilton), who became queen as a teenager when her uncle (Peter Ustinov) dies. At first she's overly influenced by the people around her, including her domineering mother. But soon she establishes herself as a force to be reckoned with by relying on the Prime Minister's advice, and making it clear to all that SHE is the one in charge.

She also reluctantly agrees to meet her cousin Albert (Jonathan Firth), the prince of a Saxon duchy, who is considered a good potential husband for her. They end up having that rarest of romances -- true love in a politically convenient alliance -- and the prince consort quickly finds his footing in the political circles, becoming a king in every way but title.

One of her descendants had less luck in ""Edward and Mrs. Simpson."" Handsome, charismatic crown prince Edward (Edward Fox) enjoys a life of world travel, glamorous surroundings and affairs with married aristocratic women. But then at a house party, he's introduced to Mrs. Wallis Simpson (Cynthia Harris), a twice-divorced married American woman -- and though she isn't pretty, she instantly captivates him.

The two of them begin a spirited affair, enjoying the privilege that comes with being the Prince of Wales and his mistress (although Mr. Simpson isn't too happy), and Edward soon makes Wallis the center of his little world. But unfortunately the king is dying, which soon throws Edward into the world of responsibility and politics... when all he wants is Wallis. And he'll abandon everything in order to be with her.

""Romance Classics"" has all sorts of romantic love in this -- love that ruins (""Edward and Mrs. Simpson""), love that transforms (""Pride and Prejudice""), and the rare instant soulmate connection that cannot be replaced (""Victoria and Albert""). Each miniseries is pretty well done, although ""Edward and Mrs. Simpson requires a little patience -- it's a butt-numbing seven episodes long.

And each story serves as a pretty good miniseries even without the romantic focus. We've got family scandal, national scandal, political clashes, and young women finding their independent way in a male-dominated world. Not a lot of action or adventure, but there are intricate storylines and well-crafted characters (some of whom were actual historical people).

And most of those characters are people you like -- Colin Firth and Ehle are dazzlingly perfect as Lizzie and Darcy, a pair of fiery sharp-tongued people who must overcome their personal flaws before they can find love. Hamilton does an excellent job as a confused teen girl who rapidly grows into a strong, competent ruler, and she has good chemistry with Jonathan Firth (yes, Colin's brother). And while Harris and Fox are not playing particularly likable people (one of them is an irresponsible playboy who makes adultery a habit), they manage to imbue them with charm and humanity.

""Romance Classics"" brings together three excellent miniseries that any romantically-minded person should see. It has love in fiction, and love in fact -- a rich historical trio.",1401321600,8,4672,5.158520475561427

This 5-DVD set includes three BBC productions, the best of which is their superlative 1995 production of Jane Austin's ""Pride And Prejudice,"" featuring Colin Firth as Darcy. This is probably the best adaptation of this story, a gorgeous movie that is remarkably true to the original novel. This ""Pride And Prejudice"" is worth the price of admission alone, though this package includes two more historical stories, though these are based on actual history, with two romances based around the lives of the British royal family. ""Victoria And Albert"" (2001) is a quirky, multi-textured mini-series about the relationship between Queen Victoria and her seemingly stiff, prim Germanic husband, a thoughtful and ultimately compelling drama. Less successful is the 1978 production of ""Edward And Mrs. Simpson,"" which is about the dramatic abdication of King Edward VIII, who abandoned the crown in order to marry the woman he loved. It's an amazing story, but the production values are very antiquated - old BBC sound stages with flat acoustics, old-fashioned cinematography, stiff acting - and the lead actor Edward Fox is rather unlikeable as an onscreen presence. (I found it hard to get into as may many modern viewers, though devotees of vintage BBC productions may be more forgiving)  All in all, this is a great collection -- the Jane Austin adaptation is a real gem, the others are icing on the cake.
