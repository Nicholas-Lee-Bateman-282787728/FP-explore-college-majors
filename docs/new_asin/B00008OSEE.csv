7986094,5,B00008OSEE,Another stellar performance by Kasarova. The instrumental playing is also first class. This is one of my favorite operas and I love this performance.,1433808000,,149,5.25
7986095,5,B00008OSEE,"This DVD opera presentation of ""Il Ritorno d'Ulise in patria"" is excellent. All the actors sing beautifully especially Henschel, Kasarova, Kaufmann and the actress that plays Melanto. This actress is very pretty as well. The sets are really well done. Nicholas Harnoncourt's conducting is magnificent. I have watched over and over.",1336867200,3,331,5.509803921568627
7986096,3,B00008OSEE,"This came so close to being satisfactory! Harnoncourt was brilliant as usual, and all the singers were of highest calibre. The camera-work was not too distracting, and the sets/costumes were inoffensive. But still -- for me, to be worth owning, an Opera DVD has to be something you would want to watch over and over. For the price, it really needs to be.

Harnoncourt was sparkling, as ever, and the music had no lack of energy. Though this was in itself kind of a problem, since there was nowhere to go for scenes like the final one where it really needs to sound a bit more ebullient than the preceding scenes. Harnoncourt surely has better sense -- my guess is that he accommodated the director, as he must have when he decided to cut Ericlea's  women-can't-keep-their-mouths-shut aria (because it's politically incorrect?) even though this made her final aria inexplicable.

It was the staging that really cut into the production's appeal. Done in modern drab, the gods were dressed like street people, and Ulysses, played by a not very heroic looking guy (not his fault, but close-ups hammered home the point) had to wear a comfy sweater that made him look like a yuppie dad in Wholefoods.

There are a lot of DVD versions of this work: no reason to go for this one. And plenty of outstanding CDs (including a 1993 one by Harnancourt, ) as well as the 2007 Harnancourt/Ponnelle DVD version (you can see scenes on youtube) done in beautiful historical costumes.

Still, on the positive side, the sound was spectacular, and there were all subtitles in italian (necessary! a well as the usual languages.
Thus, I would rate this one as merely OK.",1296259200,6,1647,4.744755244755245
7986097,5,B00008OSEE,"This can be called 'Renaissance' opera verging on baroque.  The vocal style is different from the later baroque-classical-belcanto-romantic styles. The entire cast encompasses many singers, and the work could really be described as a study in the renaissance operatic vocal style.
And good old Harnoncourt is 'the' expert in this work, so I learnt from another DVD of this composition conducted by him some 30 odd years ago.
There also used to be an old CD recording of this work by the much younger Harnoncourt, which appears to be out of print by now.
In the simple staging and 'no nonsense' approach by the director, the audience can safely concentrate on the wonderful music.
The musical side of this production is nothing less than superb.
There is almost not one single weaklink in the entire big cast. Perhaps's Isabel Rey's goddess of love does compare a bit disfavourably with the rest, but her part is not significant enough to upset the generally high musical and vocal standard one jot.
Henschel in the title role is the sheer ideal Ulisse, while Kasarova as Penelope is moving and visually convincing.
The three puppeteers (bass, tenor and counter-tenor) are so outstanding in the entire Second Act that you would keep checking back on the booklet for their names, and the gods and goddesses all sang like gods.
Particularly noteworthy is Harnoncourt's conducting.  Each dramatic moment, each vocal nuance, each pause and stop, he does them for special reasons and effects in order that full justice could be done to Monteverdi's score. There is a keen sense of feeling that this conductor really loves this work.
Bravo, maestro Harnoncourt!",1228003200,5,1654,5.010909090909091
7986098,5,B00008OSEE,"Updated Jan 12, 2010.  Impressionist staging that really works.  Every singer is excellent.  Sound in LPCM mode puts this DVD in my best sounding list of recordings.  Highly recommended to anyone who wants to explore early opera.  After extensive listening I am impressed by how flexible Kasarova's voice is.  As Octavian or Sesto she sings very dramatically with a powerful sound.  Here she is singing over a very soft early instrument orchestra, thus she is able to sing with a wider range of vocal colors.  Due to the high sound levels of modern orchestras singers are pushed hard to be heard.  In my opinion, modern orchestras are perceived to be at least four times as loud as early orchestras. this translates to a 20 dB increase in sound presure level, or more importantly, one hundred times the sound energy level of an early orchestra.  It is no wonder that singers in the past had a greater range of expression.  The singers on this DVD prove that highly expressive singing is still possible when singers don't have to blast their way through a large orchestra.

Henschel is a wonderful Ulisse and Hartelius as Melanto is perfect, showing a wide range of vocal expression and great acting.

For several years I have been pondering why as recording technology improves, sound seems to get courser.  I feel that excessive loudness is the reason.  When I took violin lessons as a child, only one string was steel.  Now I am seeing stringed instruments with only steel strings.  Air is not linear at high sound levels, especially in a singer's throat.  The harmonic distortion that results in a singers throat is so similar to that created by amplifiers and speakers that are working too hard, that it is hard to tell what is at fault.  Recently I have heard distortion in live unamplified choral concerts, while I was wreaking my voice trying to keep up.",1158883200,13,1861,4.759375
7986099,4,B00008OSEE,"This is a good solid production of the story of Ulysses return home as stated in the last half of the Odyssey.  The orchestra is more or less in the period style as directed by Nicholas Harnoncourt at the Zurich Opera house.  Staging is good and the singing is particularly accurate.  The cast, led by Vesselina Kasarova (sp?) is uniformly good though with a bit more vibrato than I would like.  Some of the intonation is extremely well done and so subtle that it makes you think about Monteverdi's harmonic intentions.  While this is not to me an exciting or new story, the plot is easy to follow in spite of the occasional divine interventions and the acting stylized but appropriate.  If you have seen the English video of this opera, you will be amazed at how good this production is.  I highly recommend this production and only give less than maximum stars because the story and renaissance musical and operatic style will not be to everyone's taste.  There is no doubt that this is a first rate production.",1066608000,15,1013,4.620111731843576
