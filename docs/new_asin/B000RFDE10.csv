2865707,4,B000RFDE10,"This film was done by an independent film maker and it does at times show that they had a budget to stick to. But some of the scenes you wouldn't know it as they are simply gorgeous! I will not spoil it but picture is an Indiana Jones crossed with an Earnest Goes Green type film and you have it. The real Star is ""Fred"" the dachshund. He is a natural and fits in the plot and film nicely. If nature, saving the environment, money grubbing politics and the like are your type of a family movie (and yes this is a lets ALL sit home, grab the popcorn and it is safe viewing for all) do so. You will laugh, some is a little over a child's level but they will easily identify with the characters and again FRED, he steals the show!",1240358400,3,727,4.055555555555555

The basics are Cartor Lord character Evenrude Jones, stumbles upon a map for lost treasure. The problem, greedy land developers want to destroy some beautiful Florida wetlands for a golf course and profit. Evinrude and ""Fred"" go on a trek to stop this and though at times this may remind you of an ""Earnest goes on an adventure"" movie, it is well done and if you love Dachshunds, whether you are 5 or 85, you will love this family film!",1217635200,,733,5.612612612612613
2865709,1,B000RFDE10,"Unless you are wanting to punish someone, Do NOT purchase this movie! I only bought it because I am a dachshund fan, with two of my own, but I would have been better off using my money for dog treats than on this low budget movie! I had to force myself to watch it though completely, just hoping it would get better...but it never did! It is filled with bad acting, out of date costumes, and a very cheesy story line. The ONLY good thing about this movie were the shots of Fred the dachshund. I would have enjoyed just watching pictures of the dachshund minus everything else that was in this terribly produced movie! Sorry, but if you are looking to purchase this movie for the same reason I did, don't waste your money!",1201564800,2,721,4.348148148148148
8200349,4,B000RFDE10,"This is a charming, whimsical movie that is normally not my cup of tea, but since I loved another movie by the director (and here the main actor), Carter Lord, I watched this and was not disappointed.  Part of this is apparently shot on video, but the underwater photography is breathtaking.  On route to searching out long lost Spanish treasure, the man and his dog find themselves involved in a crusade to save the area's natural beauty from greedy and duplicitous investors.  As with The Enchanted (Quite a different, scary movie, but excellent) one sees the real Florida -- diverse wildlife, cowboys (yes, cowboys!), and a concern for the environment that a lot of folks have -- if only some young people could be reached by movies like this people would stop dumping trash everywhere they go.

Some things didn't work for me -- the strange ""Korean"" refugee who was not Korean or even oriental was a bit galling -- and at first the spirits of the forest were a bit much, but for a movie I was sure I wouldn't like it had me glued to my seat, simply because it may be done on the cheap somewhat, but the acting really was good and the whole spirit of the movie makes you feel good.
I don't understand the negative reviews at all -- seems there a lot of dachsund lovers that only want to watch the cute antics of dogs in all the movies they watch?  Whatever.  This is a most enjoyable film.",1407283200,,1392,4.43921568627451
8200350,5,B000RFDE10,"Good movie. Reminded me of the ""Earnest goes to..."" movies It was funny and a low budget movie... Hokey, but I like hokey movies anyway... Enjoy",1351555200,,144,4.576923076923077

They need his help to protect their magical river from various villains intent on its destruction. A reluctant but true hero,accompanied by his loyal companion,Fred,Evinrude has many misadventures before he ends his quest.

8200352,2,B000RFDE10,"Lithium Springs is a low(est)-budget film about a guy and his dog looking for the Fountain of Youth. I purchased this movie for my mini Dachshund, Buddy Ray. He loves movies with Dachshunds in it and I have watched The Ugliest Dachshund about 50 times and needed a change. Buddy Ray gives this movie Two-Paws-UP but all the people in the room groaned the entire 93 minutes. At least I can play it for Buddy Ray when I need to get work done around the house.",1299456000,,457,4.325581395348837
8200353,3,B000RFDE10,"Slightly cute, almost comedic at first with the horribly bad acting and shoddy camera work.  Mostly bought this movie because it had a dachshund in it, but after a while the bad acting just gets annoying.",1264204800,,204,4.666666666666667
8200354,4,B000RFDE10,"The expressions and ""puns"" are hilarious.  A great way to see the inside of Florida - understand how the natives think and live - appreciate the beauty of its springs, and laugh the entire time.",1260144000,,194,4.542857142857143
8200355,5,B000RFDE10,"My pre-schooler used to be a chain-viewer of Tintin, but since Lithium Springs came out, he has watched the entire movie 5 times every day, clutching in his size-1 hands the picture of Fred the Dachshund in full diving gear on the cover of the DVD. My husband is struck by the soaring Shakespeareanism of the story, which combines the best of a Midsummer Night's Dream (woodland creatures) and the Merchant of Venice (venality) with the literary mechanisms of soliloquies, comic interludes, intertwining plots and subplots, and fun choice of wording. As for me, who just finished writing a Ph. D. dissertation on economics and law of the environment, I feel sorry that my thesis has none of the wit, acting skill, directing, great choice of music, lovely photography of the marshland, or memorable cast of characters. The movie is definitely a must-see in the family category!

Film maker Carter Lord and Nobel Laureate Al Gore (An Inconvenient Truth) choose opposite voices to convey the same message. Indeed, Lord's poetic Lithium Springs could easily have been named A Convenient Myth. It whisks the viewer to a world before destruction occurs, where fear is replaced by humor, crumbling ice-caps with pristine wetlands, statistics with music, and academic documentary with allegorical drama. It effortlessly conveys the message of environmental stewardship to all ages.  My two-year-old, who has seen Lithium Springs no less than 20 times, particularly enjoys the whispered asides at point-blank range by the mugging film maker in his role as a penniless small-boat pilot in search of Ponce De Leon's Fountain of Youth; and the fearless dog Fred, who single-pawedly warns his master of the approach of the Bad Guys, disarms a pushy policy officer, and dons diving gear to search for under-water treasure. I like the universality of the music, which ranges from classical piano to folk guitar to bongos to a disembodied spirit choir; and the stunning cinematography of both the wetlands and the underwater world below the surface. The characters include lovely wood-nymphs, a River god, two cowboys on horseback, three villains on  Harley-Davidsons, a sheisty lawyer, a heartless heiress, a lonely Latin American lady who inexplicably began life as a Korean orphan, and lots of children. It doesn't matter whether Lithium Springs is actually the fabled Fountain of Youth or not; it does have the power to rejuvenate all of these characters, purify their motives, and ultimately save itself. If only the same were true of our entire planet!

8200356,5,B000RFDE10,"I could as easily have titled this review 'Beware of Those Who Would Pave Paradise...'; the message of 'Lithium Springs' combines Carter Lord's slam-dunk onscreen persona and a satisfyingly subtle environmental message, entangled in a whimsical, colorful package that does not disappoint.  It has many charms, not least of which is the evocative visual aspect, and that is complemented by intriguing music provided by, among others, Willie Lomax. As Evinrude makes his way through the backwaters & byways of Florida in search of Ponce de Leon's treasure, he lapses into some minor moral turpitude (nothing heinous here - just the need for environmental responsibility versus the need for greed), but in the end, his conscience is tugged, jerked, mauled, by the ever-present wee figure of Fred the Dachshund. There are some magnificent shots of wildlife, there is underwater footage that takes one's breath away (and not just because it's underwater), and we are constantly reminded that we must be stewards if the planet is to stand the test of time. I must say that I am mystified by the one-star review posted here.  This benign and entertaining little film deserves none of the vitriole leveled at it. I say to the potential viewer, do not be put off by this.  'Lithium Springs' is funny, goofy, a treat. The DVD contains, as a bonus feature, an optional voice-over commentary by Lord and his wife Teza; I watched the whole movie without it, then immediately went back and watched it again, this time listening to the sometimes hilarious descriptions of What Really Happened.... As you can tell from the number of stars blazing at the top of this review, 'Lithium Springs' works for me.",1249344000,4,1689,4.9822695035460995
8200357,5,B000RFDE10,"For a native Floridian of many generations who is appalled at what is happening to Florida, this film makes its point very well.  Lord shot the film entirely in Florida, using mostly local non-professionals in his cast.  Hurrah for those risk takers and their natural Florida accents!  (Hate those fakes who don't know how to punctuate or when to say ""y'all"".)  Arcadia cowboys are--well--Arcadia cowboys!  It helps to be one to play one.  The guy who plays the sleaze-bag lawyer is actually a lawyer who helped finance the project.  I admired his sportsmanship.  I recognized many of the locations, some of which may have been paved over since the film was made.  The unmistakable authenticity in people and places was one of the film's greatest assets.

Lithium Springs takes on environmental issues and presents them in a comic/fantasy vehicle.  Don't miss it.",1245456000,,863,5.007042253521127
