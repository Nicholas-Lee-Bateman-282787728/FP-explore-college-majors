8486873,3,B005UJX7GA,Compared to the earlier DVD's of this series I found this one lacking in comparison. Beautiful men as usual but did not care for the format. I purchased it because the model on the front was so alluring...........and he did not disappoint.,1376006400,,239,4.714285714285714
8486874,1,B005UJX7GA,NO ORIGINALITY ON THIS PRODUCTION...ITS A COPYCAT FROM OTHER VIDEO..I LOVE THE 2003 TO 2008 VIDEO..THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY.,1333324800,4,124,4.9523809523809526
8486875,2,B005UJX7GA,"This series used to be fun; spontaneous, bright, energetic, yet still superbly photographed.
Now, it's become a victim of its own hype; everything's portentous, and grim, and hardly anybody is seen to crack a smile, gods forbid. They're all taking it so effing seriously, because, y'know, it's Art.
The industrial/factory setting, while giving the boys plenty of big tools to play with (fnar fnar), leads to even more repetitive stock poses than usual, and the gloomy setting, plus the unaccountable trait of smearing the gentlemen with oil or grease, just make the whole thing look gloomy and... well, dirty. And not a good, fun kind of dirty. Just shabby and grubby.
I didn't finish; I fast-forwarded through the second half, to see all the same poses flickering across the screen again and again.
It's as if all the vitality has been drained from the series, and it's crumbling under its own pretentions.
Either the franchise needs a serious revamp, or else, maybe, it's time they pulled their pants up and closed down the series.",1329436800,4,1033,4.942528735632184
8486876,5,B005UJX7GA,"This is the BEST of this series. It is beautifully photographed with rich inky coloration. The settings suggest early 20th century camera work, sensitive and poetic. The music supports the moody visuals and you could freeze the film in a thousand different spots and have a stunning image. The DVD achieves a dance like quality. Terrific taste, style and invention combine again and again in this lovely meditation on masculine beauty. KUDOS!",1327881600,3,442,5.152777777777778
8486877,3,B005UJX7GA,stade dvds have been great in past years but this one not as good. too dark and the guys have grease or mud put on them that don't show their bodies as good and the lighting is dark. i think the blk & wht ones were the best ones but again am not very happy with this one.,1326326400,9,271,3.689655172413793
8486878,3,B005UJX7GA,"I have been collecting all the DVDs of  the ""Making the Calendars"" and I believe the point  is  to show  how  the photo shoots are done but I  still do not understand  what  is  all the covering  penises is  all about. The penises of the players are still part of their  bodies . I just  think they have  been  castrated with  all the covering and  genital blank spots. It's silly and in the art of photography is  mutilating. It's not pornography or cheap porn if you show all.",1326240000,7,478,4.238636363636363
8486879,4,B005UJX7GA,"The times of seconds of frontal nudity of DIEVX DU STADE DVDs have gone. Let's now call this genre of video ""just-powder-my-cheecks"" or ""balls-covered-by-ball"" videos. Anyhow, I think, good ideas seem to have gone out of the heads of the production team. It all started in 2004 so hopefully fresh and daring; now they seem to be afraid of getting excommunicated. Beautiful photography with bun's galore as usual, but the atmosphere lacks of electricity.",1323043200,15,453,5.135135135135135
