4834065,3,B005M2A4DY,"I admit I was disapointed It's ok but I have  several of these befor & I bought them in the last 3 years.
Daves getting married is a very cute episode  but was on their thanksgiving DVD.  now I have it twice.
Every chipmunk tells a story and Maids in Japan are both in the Alviiin DVD  since I lost that DVD  I was glad to have them back but  would have appriciated something new more  I think Romancing Miss Stone was  in the  Alviiiin DVD too.

shrinking dave & Mothers day were 1s I'd never seen & very good  but still 2 out of 6?
What about that great 1 when alvin looses his trademark hat & can't go onstage without it?  It's kinda nice to see his vulnerable and insecure side.",1327708800,,682,4.045112781954887
4834066,2,B005M2A4DY,"No original title cards are on the episodes... ""Maids in Japan"" was edited when Alvin Simon and Theodore tried to escape the cab when Dave takes them back to the hotel. That scene is not in this DVD edition. The editing and changes need to stop! The fans should have the right to see the shows in their original Presantation...  From what I have seen in terms of the latest releases, it seems that Peramount and Bagdasarian Productions are going around in circles... I think a disclamer should be put on the package letting customers know if the show has been altered in any way...",1326931200,10,581,4.533333333333333

I constantly laughed during the episodes.  If you like the old school ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" and their ability to provide humor, you should definitely purchase this DVD set.  I could tell on the episodes that the boys really did not want Dave to get married.  I don't want to spoil it for future viewers.  Really loved the item!",1329350400,,502,4.712643678160919
