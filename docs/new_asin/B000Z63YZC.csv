Anna Karina, Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean-Claude Brialy in an American style musical comedy associated with the Nouvelle Vague; on top, it is notable for being the first film Jean-Luc Godard shot in color and Cinemascope. Decorated at the 11th Berlin International Film Festival with a Silver Bear for Best Actress (Godards wife Karina, for whom he made the film) and the Extraordinary Jury Prize. A simple triangle between a young couple and a lover with the woman, an exotic dancer, wanting a baby the husband refuses, but gives in when friend and wife become serious.

Rather silly and childish, though like 1964 Jacques Demys upmarket (fashion from Dior, not Prixuni) Les Parapluies de Cherbourg, obviously with some public in France and elsewhere near-hysterical. The occasional comparison by critics with the two very early Godard ten minute Tous les garcons sappellent Patrick (1957 - ""Charlotte and Vronique,"" or: ""All Boys Are Called Patrick"") and the even more brilliant Charlotte et son Jules (1958 - Charlotte and Her Boyfriend, with a young Belmondo at his best) are an insult and most likely show that these two early films, now easily available on other Godard discs, have never been seen So any praise for Une femme ..  is most likely a sign of ignorance, or stupidity, or both

8234767,3,B000Z63YZC,"Same as the version on another popular online streaming video service, this version squishes the 2.35:1 original aspect ratio into some sort of letterboxing on the top and bottom AND sides. It's a great movie and I still recommend it, but everyone looks squished and it bothered me the entire time I was watching.

5/5 stars for film
