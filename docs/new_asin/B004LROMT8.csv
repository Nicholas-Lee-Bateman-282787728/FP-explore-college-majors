4401858,5,B004LROMT8,"My 6 1/2 year old son has gotten me helplessly addicted to the Clone Wars. We breathlessly anticipated the premier of Season 3, and boy, were we not disappointed! The episodes where (possible SPOILER?!) Darth Sidious orders Ventress to be assassinated were an awesome little interlude in the series. You actually find yourself rooting for Ventress in her quest to stay alive and exact revenge on Dooku for the betrayal. 'Padawan Lost' and the following episode, 'Wookiee Hunt', were an incredible way to end the season. The appearance of Chewbacca was so awesome, and a nice nod to us old school fans.

What I like about the series is that, even though there is some violence depicted, it is not gratuitous. I feel that this show somewhat realistically shows what happens in a war. My son is taught lessons on the importance of honor, peace, and doing the right thing. Of course I, as his parent, strive to teach him these things myself, but it doesn't hurt to have Captain Rex, Commander Cody, Obi-Wan, and yes, even Anakin (pre-Darth Vader, of course) backing me up! I also really appreciate the emphasis put on 'girls can kick butt, too'. In the vein of Princess Leia, Ahsoka and Padme' are cool chicks who don't just sit around, waiting to be rescued. All in all, this series is amazing, and I highly recommend it. Being able to bond with my son over something we both really enjoy is always a great thing. Can't wait for season 4 to start already!",1305676800,67,1452,4.6498054474708175

Particularly, the ones with a cameo by Chewbacca and the origin of the walking WMD Savage Opress. You need this set to complete the series, anyway.",1420934400,,487,4.951219512195122

You start with 2 excellent episodes about the clone troops, then have about 8 that are boring and pointless, and finish up with 12 decent ones.

The characters get a digital makeover, making the animation more realistic, and some of the character designs make a departure from the original Genndy Tartakovsky-esque designs to a more Episode III-ish look. The Attack on Kamino, the ""Mortis"" arc where our three heroes attain a faint glimpse of the future(somewhat similar to the 2D Star Wars Clone  cartoon), and the return of old classics like Chewbacca and a younger Grand-Moff Tarkin are the highlight of the season and will please both young and old fans of the series.",1363046400,,681,4.82051282051282

This season does have a few relatively useless episodes, but some of the major story arcs are incredibly good. The Mortis arc and the Dathomir/Savage Opress storylines are the standouts, to be sure. This is the first time you start to feel the we're getting closer to Episode 3, that things are changing and lives are in jeopardy. It's strong stuff, and continues to get stronger in Season 4.

-For the Clone Wars season 3 - I'd rate it a 4-5 stars
-For the actual packaging? 2 stars is almost too much.

I purchased this thinking that I would get the same great package that I got with the 1st 2 season.

Sadly, I was sorely disappointed today when it arrived...and was in a normal Bluray jewel case.

Lucasfilm this is quite possibly the biggest disappointment I've had with any of you products in my lifetime. Whoever at your company that decided to sell this without the same package deal that the 1st 2 seasons had should be demoted or let go. I'd go as far as to say that not having the deluxe packaging option the 1st 2 had is inexcusable.

As far as the season goes, EXCELLENT and it only gets better.

Please, LucasFilm (and now Disney) - PLEASE bring back the better packages like Seasons 1 and 2!!! :(",1356652800,3,897,4.347305389221557

4402260,1,B004LROMT8,"Star Wars The Clone Wars, The Complete Season Three SHOULD HAVE THREE BLURAY DISCS.  (22 episodes)

I received one normal BluRay box.  Translucent blue plastic with a center snap for ONE disc.
The label looks just like the picture on the web site (blue with Anakin, and ""Star Wars The Clone Wars, The Complete Season Three"" on it.
The single disc in the box looks like the picture on the label.  What I didn't notice was the ""Disc 3"" in smaller letters on the disc.  My oversight, doh!
I just popped the disc in my player and watched the episodes.  I just thought there were fewer episodes in season 3. (There are not, there should be 22)

Looking at the Season 4 details, I noticed it said 3 discs.  That spurred me to look at Season 3's details which says, you guessed it, THREE discs.
I immediately contacted Amazon, but they would only give me a $15 credit since it had been 10 months.  I appreciate the credit so long after my purchase, but I still feel like I got screwed.  I had to fork over another $17.38 (+ the credit) to re-order Season 3.  You can bet I'll check for three discs this time.

I have NO IDEA what the heck is up with what I received.  It's a single disc box, so disc 1 & 2 wouldn't fit, so it's not like they fell out or someone at the factory stole them.  I'm interested to see what the box is supposed to look like.",1352332800,,1343,4.1953125

4402262,1,B004LROMT8,"Ever heard of jumping the shark? This season, Clone Wars jumped a shark and a few aliens, too. The storytelling is all wonky. Not appropriate for children under age 12 or 13. It's probably more for adults, reliving their childhood fascination with Star Wars, as most teens I know wouldn't be caught dead watching Clone Wars, period. Unfortunately, the Clone Wars brand was targeted at boys ages 5-8 early on, and no matter the content, in many folks' minds, it will stay there. But there was no need to go all bizarro on the storytelling. It seems to me like the writers were bored, and kinda lost their way, and were swayed by the animators who said, ""Oh, it would be cool to animate this (insert image)..."" although it really had nothing to do with the story of the downfall of the Empire. In any case, reviews of Season 4 say the story lines continue down this dark, disturbing (not-very-well-told) path, so we'll skip buying it.

  There have been several SW fans who haven't really enjoyed the first half of this particular season.  They complained that a number of the episodes were too political.  I felt that way when they aired, but once I watched them in chronological order, I had a vast difference of opinion.  For one thing, the 3 or so political episodes focus on what Palpatine is doing behind the scenes.  That's always a joy to watch.  It's also a joy to listen to in my case since I think the late great Ian Aberkromby gave us a magnificent Palpatine.  So give these another shot, folks.

  What can I say about this series?  I'm guessing you probably already own the first 2 seasons if you're reading this.  You've undoubtedly seen this as well.  So I should probably tell you a few of my favorite episodes and let you buy this already.

  The first 2 that come to mind were the book-ends to a season 1 episode called Rookies.  I absolutely loved Clone Cadets and ARC Troopers. A very memorable clone named 99 stole the show, in my opinion.  He was certainly an example of an ordinary guy doing extraordinary things.

  Another favorite was Supply Lines.  That one contained some fantastic battle scenes, but then again most Clone Wars episodes do.  I also loved the Nightsisters Trilogy as well as the Chewbacca Duology/season finale.  the 3 or so episodes spotlighting bounty hunters Aura Sing and Cad Bane were also among my favorites. They include Assassin, Evil Plans, and Hunt for Zero.  Bane is so very ruthless and unpredictable, so you never know what he's going to do next. And the writers don't give Aura enough screen time, so it was great seeing her in Assassin. Here's hoping we see her in season 5 this Fall.

  The 3rd season was a great ride and can't wait for season 4 to be released on Oct 23rd this year.  I only wish the writers and cast would opt to do a few episode commentaries on these sets.  I bet the voice actors have allot to say.  It would be interesting to listen to people like Clancy Brown, Ashley Eckstein, and James Arnold Taylor tell us their reactions concerning key moments in certain episodes.  But it really isn't a big deal.  The DVD bonus features kept me entertained and the episodes were unforgettable.",1343001600,3,2491,4.5542986425339365

4402272,1,B004LROMT8,"It is sad to see a decline of quality in Star Wars these days. While some might not agree with me, I have been noticing the sudden fall of what this show is for and what purpose does it hold. Without going into too much detail, I remember the original Clone Wars multimedia project back in 2003-2007, and it certainly did not fail to show what the Clone Wars was all about. Fast forward to 2008 and a new Clone Wars project arrived, but really, what did Lucasfilm forget to show during the war? Season three of The Clone Wars feels more like an inconsequential, fluffy, ""what if,"" or even a ""behind the scenes"" look of the Clone Wars. In other words, do I even care for what Padme does when trouble arises in the senate or when Cad Bane sets off to find C-3PO while R2 playfully goes through a droid wash/spa? I do not, actually. And do I even care to see Ahsoka shake hands with Chewbacca? Come to think of it Lucasfilm, what was the point of that? While this season may have shown a much needed space battle above Sullust, anything else seemed rather lost, as I mentioned and described above.

4402298,3,B004LROMT8,"I'm not going to mince words: I was pretty disappointed with this season compared to the first two. It had some pretty clunky writing and some really bad episode ideas. (One involved Threepio and Artoo and their mission to buy a piece of fruit for a senatorial banquet.) In addition, the package is pretty bare-bones. This time there is no concept art booklet, there are five medium-length featurettes instead of a small one for every episode, and the season is contained in a standard clamshell case instead of the beautiful books you got with previous seasons.

All my gripes aside, these episodes still have a distinct Star Wars feel and there is something to be gained by wathing each episode. This definitely isn't one of Lucasfilm's high points but it is worth buying if you want a fun experience in the galaxy far, far away.",1332633600,2,831,4.731034482758621
4402299,1,B004LROMT8,"This review applies to the Blu-Ray product titled: Star Wars: The Clone Wars - The Complete Season Three [Blu-ray].

The product description states that it contains all 22 episodes in 3 discs. Even the label on the case indicates the same thing.
However, when you open the case, it only contains Disc # 3 (only last 8 episodes).
Discs #1 and #2 are not included. There isn't even any space in the case for two more discs.

Good thing Amazon has an easy Return policy.
The first time I ordered it and notified Amazon that it came with just one disc, they immediately replaced it via one-day shipping.
Unfortunately, the replacement item Amazon sent me had the same problem.
I was able to return the second order as well with no issues.

It looks like the product came out of the factory incomplete to begin with. The case was built for just 1 disc.

4402300,5,B004LROMT8,"Three trends made Season 3 an innovation in The Clone Wars series. First, it got more political. I know some fans thought some of the episodes had a liberal bias, but I think that was more a reflection of Padme's naivet. Rather, the political episodes were a great way to give Padme some character development and show her relationship with Bail Organa. had several epic trilogies which allowed the show to tell longer, more intense stories. The Savage Opress arc was a fan favorite and focus almost exclusively on Asajj Ventress and Savage Opress. The Mortis trilogy was another brilliant episode that delved into mythic archetypes. These were some of the best episodes of the season. Finally, Season 3 had more familiar faces from the Original Trilogy, particularly Tarkin and Chewbacca. I thought overall these characters weren't overused and it was nice to see the budding relationship between Anakin and Tarkin. Overall, I liked the risks Season 3 took. The only real duds were the Mandalorian episodes.",1331164800,,1008,5.041916167664671

4402303,4,B004LROMT8,"I own the digibook versions of the first two seasons of this show, and it makes me very disappointed that Lucasfilm has decided to release Season 3 only as a regular-case Blu-ray. Since they are not going to release this season with a digibook, I just sucked it up and bought it anyway. The reason I took off only one star for this and not two is because it's a perfectly fine set compared to any other show out there, and it does come with a nice enough slip cover, but it's hard not to be disappointed after being spoiled by the previous two digibook cases, so it still loses one star.

 Once I got over the fact that the case is about 20% less cool than the other season sets that I own, it's overall a very good release. The episodes in this season are a little confusing since they are in broadcast order instead of chronological order, and some of these episodes actually take place during Season 2! Even though the fanboys haven't yet figured out the correct viewing order for this season, the story arcs here are at least good, and there are some great cameos this season that the fans will love. Some famed characters from the movies make their animation debut, and even the titular heroes from the video game ""Republic Commando"" get an appearance.

4402310,5,B004LROMT8,"I have Season 1, 2, & 3 of the Clone Wars series and I have to say I think this was the best season to date. The writing and character development was very good. It ""fixed"" my perceived error of off Darth Maul too quickly in Episode One. It also answered questioned from Ziro jailbreak that I thought ended rather abruptly earlier in the show. The writers also developed a few more of the Clone Troopers that we see somewhat regularly on the show. We got to see a young Chewbacca. This season really fleshed out the universe and added some depth to it.
It also seemed that the Force played a more central role in the Jedi and Sith characters. However, the central role of the Force and the Prophecy of the Chosen One lead to my least favorite episodes of the Mortis Trilogy. I know many will disagree but I did not feel like they really moved the story along.
So if you enjoyed the first two seasons this one is a must purchase. If you are a fan of Star Wars, this season is the story driven prequel to the original trilogy that you have been desiring.",1326240000,,1052,4.265

4402312,5,B004LROMT8,"The animated TV show Star Wars The Clone Wars that has been running on Cartoon Network for four seasons has quietly been accomplishing what the three prequel films failed to do.
After watching these episodes, I am actually left wondering if in fact those three films might have benefited from full animation, rather than the live action, stuffed-to-the-gills-with-computer-effects that struggled to seem real to the viewer. Several of the newer films failed to form a connection to the original three films. Sometimes animation lets the fantasy of a story seem more real than live action.
Lucas obviously has a huge vision for the breadth and scope that is the Star Wars universe. Here in these short episodes, his vision--along with the help of many talented writers, artists, and visionaries--is allowed to play itself out. Every indulgence is satisfied as episode after episode delve into action, history, characters, humor, romance, betrayal, and the slow unfolding of Anakin into his eventual turn toward the dark side in Episode III.
I have been more than a little surprised by the depth, gravity, and drama in what is essentially a kids' cartoon. The stories include genuine death scenes in which characters and soldiers are cut down and lost week after week. Gone are the days of G.I. Joe where every exploding ship ridiculously reveals a parachute where even the bad guys make it to safety. Droids, aliens, clones, and humans all lose their lives in what, when all is said and done, might turn out to be the finest Star Wars series ever produced. Characters' backstories are told in a way that a two-hour film would never allow. The funny thing is that it has been going on for years now and has become lost in the pop culture, over-saturated fizz of dozens of other shows that obscure this gem from getting the praise it deserves.
For me, this show stands alongside some of the greatest sci-fi TV shows of all time.  I'll be happy to own all the complete seasons when this show runs its course and tells the complete bridge between Episodes II and III. By then, Lucas will have his next opus ready for consumption; the live action TV show that will bridge the long, dark period between Episode III and Episode IV. I can only hope that the live-action show manages to pull off what this show, so far, has been doing.
I would also like to mention that the animation, art, background paintings, music, and voice acting, is all second to none. I've been continually pausing and admiring still shots from episodes to marvel at the beauty of this show as it plays itself out. When this show is done, Star Wars fans will have a 100-episode magnum opus to watch over and over. I hope a collectors' edition will eventually be released, as well as a comprehensive soundtrack. The subtlety contained in the music, especially for fans who know the original music well, is fantastic. Each season deserves a multi-disc release. Lucas may have botched the original trilogy in the three films that got consecutively better as they went on, but this series firmly establishes his legacy as the one and only father of Star Wars. It also shows that since he was smart enough to loosen the reigns on his baby and let talent take the helm, he can guide the series to the greatness is deserves. Now get back to your TV.",1325548800,,3307,4.741319444444445

I was excited to try out, The Clone Wars Series after seeing the animated movie with him. The past 2 seasons have been great but this one leaves me a little leery of getting anymore of the seasons. Unlike some other reviewers I don't have a huge problem with the packaging of the DVD set since I am not ""collecting"" them; in fact the new packaging seems to do a better job of keeping the DVD's in place and it takes up less space in our DVD cabinet. The problem I have is with the shift away from what we have come to know as ""typical"" from the creators of Star Wars. Season 3 definately has a different ""feel"" than the other seasons which was fine and not concerning in itself. However, disc 3 dives heavily into witch-craft. I try to watch the videos ahead of my son seeing them in case there are things that would be scary for a 5 yr old so we can fast forward through them. I don't believe I'm hyper sensitive or ultra conservative, nor do I get freaked out or bothered by magic or spells etc...  That being said I don't like the emphasis placed on the ""Coven's"" chanting and sorcery. I just don't see how it really added to the story line or any real character development. If anything it left me thinking they ran out of ideas and resorted to peppering ( I use that term graciously) in ""filler"" for lack of interesting storyline. It really seems like this season is taking us away from the Star Wars I grew up loving and wanted my son to enjoy. Needless to say my son won't be watching disc 3.

It's a foregone conclusion, yes, but it's told very well - and tension is kept up by wondering if Asoka will end up joining him with the Dark Side... There's also a few great episodes dealing with side characters this season, some of which are genuinely touching.

Personally, I feel like this is the best format for enjoying Star Wars stories. Call me a heretic if you like, but the movies always seemed too long and drawn out; I liked the original trilogy (we aren't speaking about that OTHER trilogy. Ever.) but by the end I'm always resisting the urge to check my watch. With the Clone wars, we get to explore diverse characters and aspects of the Star Wars universe in neat, not-necessarily-consecutive narrative chunks. I think it works really well, and offers us a good look at Star Wars the way we all imagined it: sweeping, varied, epic, and interconnected.

I understand Lucas caught alot of flack about Darth Maul dying but trying to make up for it by bringing in his brother, please cut it out. I know many mistakes were made in the prequels but Clone Wars has made up for it. Season three tries to make up for the prequels too much, but who cares about those movies anymore. Just keep making great stories like the last two in season 3, hands-down the best of the season. If you're a fan that wants to have the complete season for continuity's sake, go for it.

The second half of season 3 adds great depth Anakin Skywalker's character, and shows how powerful he is. Season 3 also shows Ahsoka's accumulating knowledge of the force and her advancement in becoming a Jedi knight.

Let's talk packaging.  No sketchbook?  Really?  With all the cool characters, planets, droids and ships in the season, there should have been a crap-ton of artwork.  But no, blah packaging.
  Now to the season.  This series gets better by the season.  Yes, it gets a little dark in the back half of the season, but it's good stuff.  We flesh out the Ventress character as well as, to an extent, Darth Maul.  I waded through the one star reviews to get a feel for why people gave such a low rating.  All but one was about the lack of goodies.  One rather intrigued me.  While I respect everyones opinion, and their right to said opinion, I don't agree with it.  I felt it was the right time to tell the NightSisters story.  You need a little variety outside of the politics story and battle story.  More went on than strictly ""Clone"" and ""War"" and ""Political intrigue"" stories.  I also liked the series about Anakin being the Chosen One.  The season as a whole was very strong; I just thought the second half was stronger than the previous two seasons back 11 episodes.  They do get perhaps slightly less kid friendly than the other episodes, but at its heart this is a kids series so they aren't going to be too intense.  I think where maybe the reviewer had a problem is that it isn't ""typical"" Star Wars.  But, I digress.
  I can't say too much that is bad about this season.  I liked it more than the previous two, which is saying something as I loved the first two seasons.

Three of the disks of this set (1,2,and 4) are along the same genre/caliber of the first two seasons and appropriate for children.  Disk 3 is horrific--figuratively and literally.  It should be rated R.  It is NOTHING BUT sadistic abuse, torture, suicide, homicide, fratricide, mental illness and sorcery--none of which move the story along.  It also plagued with misogynistic overtones...What happened to the writers during those weeks we will never know...I am so glad we do not follow this show on TV.

4402422,3,B004LROMT8,"So, I am a huge Star Wars fan, and have really been enjoying the Clone Wars.  The first two seasons got progressively better.  However, Season 3 REALLY hits a snag.  The first half of this season is very weak, and contains episodes that you may watch just once and forget about (I like to call them ""fluff"" episodes).  On the other hand, the second half of Season 3 covers some really amazing stuff, and almost feels like an entirely different show.  It's just sad that we get such an inconsistent season.  Speaking of inconsistencies, I am just going to touch on the packaging subject lightly, since it seems to be the biggest gripe from customers.  It really is a pain in the butt to have the first two seasons in beautiful digibook packaging with neat concept art booklets (I love looking at that stuff!  With this release we just get a regular blu-ray case, with a slip...that's it.  Other than a rundown of the episodes, I think the slip just had a picture of Ahsoka and Chewie, and that was about it.

-Rating: 3 Stars.  It's funny that, what I feel is the weakest season, for the most part, has the weakest release.  If the first half of the season was better and the packaging was digibook like the others, this would be a 5 out of 5, for sure.",1320364800,2,1252,4.395652173913043

4402455,4,B004LROMT8,"The Clone Wars is a wonderful series. Okay, now that I've said that I'll just jump right into my review of the third season.

Of the three seasons that have been aired and are now currently available for purchase, this is the weakest but at the same time the strongest. Now, how can this be?  Well let me start by saying the series takes off on a very strong note.  We are reintroduced to the clone rookies from season 1 and given an interesting look at the training future clone troopers go through.  This episode called Clone Cadets is a great opener as it takes us back to the beginning of the war.  It adds more depth to the clone trooper as an individual.  In this episode we see the young cadets struggling to prove themselves to the ARC Commanders and their own instructors.  We are also introduced to Jedi Master Shaak Ti which is cool.  The second episode returns to the present and dishes up a Sep attack on Kamino! The third episode is good and the ones up to 12 are good but they are the reason I do not give this season 5 stars.  I felt that these episodes while interesting detracted from the action that drives the Clone Wars as a series.  Ep 4-12 are largely concerned with Senate matters and while intersparsed with some excitement are not what I expected.  The first and second seasons were consistent with keeping the show about the clones in the field and the Jedi leading them.  However a sizable chunk of the season turns our attention towards the political war fought in the senate. I understand that the battleground of politics and the one dominated by clones are related but the politics should not command the stage.  This series is meant to chronicle the struggle of the Grand Army of the Republic and the Jedi who reluctantly lead it.  I want to jump into the minds of the clones on the front lines.  On the subject of politics I find Padme to be naive and her views on how to end the war rather foolish.  One of my biggest gripes about this season is having to listen to her more often. Now I understand that this series is also aimed at children but when you look at the darker turns the series keeps taking you can see that it is looking to broaden its appeal.  This becomes quite apparent in episodes 12-22.  These episodes are the nuts and bolts of the Clone Wars and will please every viewer. Get ready for some familiar faces and some big surprises.
So in conclusion let me say the third season is worth buying and worth watching over and over again.  It has its down point but recovers and makes up for lost action. So in the words of 3P0, ""Here we go again.""",1320019200,,2596,4.35966735966736

Now they've deprived us all of that. As far as the story, I've been enjoying it. I'll be deducting no points there. I don't mind breaking from the action for political side of the war. Wars are mired in politics. So it's only believable that they depict that aspect of the Clone War. I *REALLY* dig the introduction of Savage Opress. But back to that packaging...SHAME on you Lucas. SHAME. I also agree, the packaging is a false advertising. Amazon and/or Lucas should be upfront with the real details.

4402485,1,B004LROMT8,"This Is my first Amazon review.  I usually am cynical enough to believe that these are only useful to a very few consumers, but this release has actually angered me.  I should probably put out there, that I'm a big fan of this show (in fact I purchase all the episodes on iTunes as they air), but this packaging choice really stings.  I am, as I'm sure most who are reading this are, a Star Wars fan and collector.  Being a collector isn't just about owning the material, but adding to our collection.  The first two seasons on Blu-ray were just simply beautiful, with the hardcover, slightly larger case, and amazing book with drawings and posters on the inside.  Unfortunately, Lucasfilm has made it painfully clear that they believe its fans are idiots that will throw money at anything that they release regardless of what it is, but I do expect more from Warner Bros.  Up until recently Warner Bros. was second only to The Criterion Collection when it came to transfer quality, supplements, and packaging.  They understood that there was a market for higher end supplements and packaging in collectors, and provided us with those products.  This release is sup-par at best.  If you want to release a more economically friendly version, thats one thing, but at least release a version that matches the quality and aesthetics as its previous editions and charge more for it.  As I stated earlier I am a die hard Star Wars Fan (and Clone Wars Fan), and I do believe the show is one of the most visually arresting shows out there, I just believe they should put it in packaging that reflects that (as they did for the first two seasons).",1318982400,27,1638,4.633217993079585
4402486,2,B004LROMT8,"I'm only going to speak here about how annoyed I am by the cheap, inconsistent packaging of Season Three. I have no doubts about Lucas's reasons, but let me list them here, for clarity.

1. They know we're going to buy it.
Honestly - who, having bought Seasons One and Two, is not going to buy Season Three? No one, that's who. If they'd recorded these on consumer-recordable blu-rays and shipped 'em in a brown paper bag, we'd still buy them. They know that.

2. This release will not lure in any new buyers.
 On the flipside of point #1, no person who *didn't* buy Seasons One and Two is suddenly going to buy this one, so Lucas & co know they don't need to spend any more money to 'impress' new customers. Those people aren't buying the show, and no amount of fancy packaging is going to change their minds.

3. They're going to double-dip us later.
 I don't know about you, but I was really keen on seeing every season of this show lined up on my shelf in beautiful, foil digibooks. Now, I will be continuously annoyed when I see Season Three (and presumably Four, etc.) sitting there. Lucas knows this, and is counting on it. When the show finally wraps up its final season, expect a big 'Complete Series' box, with all the seasons looking lovely together, to the extent that looking at the mismatched seasons we already have will drive you nuts, and make you crave the 'Complete Series' box more and more.

My son and I love the show itself; no complaints, really. But the packaging of this set just screams of penny-pinching, and makes me feel like I've been treated poorly.",1318896000,117,1581,4.472222222222222

4402489,2,B004LROMT8,"I pre-ordered this season as soon as possible as my sons and I love watching the cartoons together. Received it today, on the day of release, yay! Season 3 is fantastic; I have no complaints about the episodes. My disappointment stems from the case. As noted by another reviewer, this is not the book format as the first 2 seasons of blu-rays are. So besides the fact that the products now do not match (which I'm sorry is very important to me), I've paid the high cost for nothing extra, no notes or drawings, the things that made the other blu-rays special.",1318896000,5,559,4.490196078431373
4402490,2,B004LROMT8,"I am reviewing the blu-ray version of season 3. Season 3 does NOT come in a hardcover case format; this is simply a regular blu-ray case that holds 3 discs. The booklet is a simple fold-out and not the high-quality booklets that were present in season 1 or season 2.

There is NOT very much artwork in the booklet for season 3; mostly just real small thumbnails of screenshots; there is no pre-production artwork. There is a cool old-movie poster homage on the front of the booklet featuring Savage Opress; it's a very cool image but it's printed on the cheap paper of the cheap fold out booklet.

Because of this disgustingly cheap and careless cost cutting, Season 3 will NOT look good on the shelf next to Seasons 1 & 2. Lucasfilm and Warner Brothers have seriously lost some major quality control.

As most of you know, the first half of the season 3 is forgettable with several episodes out of continuity and mostly weak or silly plots such as poisoned juice for grade schoolers and lots of boring VERY NON-STAR WARS episodes focusing on politics. The politics in the cartoon are so vanilla; six-year-olds to sixty-olds will be bored to death.

The second half of Season 3, starting with ""Nightsisters"" is pretty good! The Citadel trilogy with Tarkin has some very poor editing transitions and some poor voice acting. The Citadel arc should have been 2 episodes instead of 3 and then they could have kept that classic Star Wars pacing. The Mortis trilogy is awesome and so is the Chewbacca duology!

The Special Features here are very weak! The featurette's are mostly cool, but the Mortis featurette is basically a featurette explaining why there isn't a featurette for the Mortis arc.

There are no episode commentaries! This is a bad thing! So much work goes into making these episodes and we only get some featurettes?

I'm only giving this set 2 Stars out of 5. The packing is very bland, lacks creativity and doesn't look good on the shelf next to Season 1 & 2 (that deducts 1 star). The lack of special features brings this down another star; there should be more featurettes and at least half the episodes should have a commentary track. The third star is lost due to the poor writing, poor plots, and poor continuity of the first half of the season.

I got this set for around $39.99; considering the lack of content, and that only half the season is good, and the cheap-skate packaging, I suggest that no one pays over $20.00 for this set. Well, maybe $25.00. Yes, I think there's $25 worth of Star Wars here.

One more note on the packaging. The standard blu-ray case comes in a cardboard slipcover. It was so cheap they had to cover it with more cheapness.

Seriously, do not pay more than $25.00 for this! Dave Filoni has let us down! I'll give Season 4 a chance, but they need to seriously step it up for next year's blu-ray! And Dave, FANS LIKE PRE-PRODUCTION ART in booklet form.

Lucasfilm and Warner Brothers, please release Season 4 BEFORE Season 5 begins airing. Most of the fans would like to review the previous season BEFORE the new season starts. I am tempted to deduct another star for the set being released weeks after the new season began to air. Marketing totally botched this whole set!

2 out of 5 stars, but it's a pretty good 2 stars, I guess.

Why wasn't Savage Opress on the cover?",1318291200,18,3321,4.580101180438448
4402491,4,B004LROMT8,"Unfortunately the first 8-10 episodes of this season are pretty boring. However, the last half REALLY picks up pace and even contains on of the best story arcs of all seasons so far with The ""Witches of Mist"" trilogy. The finale introduces Chewbacca into the mix in a double-length episode. I only wish it came earlier. All-in-all a good season that could have been GREAT if the first half focused more on the Jedi, Clones and villains and less on politics, 3rd-tier characters and stuff nobody cares about.

This Blu-Ray contains the same top-notch quality (top scores for 1080p video and 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio) as seasons 1 & 2, however the packaging has changed for the worse. (I deduct 1 star for packaging, 1 for a boring first half, but add one back for an EXCELLENT last half.)

4402493,5,B004LROMT8,"I won't lie, I am a serious Star Wars fan. I didn't see the orginal movies in the theaters (I did see the Remade ones that came out just before the prequel) We didn't have a lot of money, and when I could afford to go, it was hard to get anyone to take me anywhere. Long story short, I was a frustrated 7 year old. Well almost 7. I did however read the comic book tie-in to see what all the fuss was about. My brothers had all of the trading cards and I thought those were pretty cool. But, after reading the comics I was fascinated by the story. Eventually I got the book out of the library and read it, and I was hooked. Star Wars really does inspire the imagination. The classic themes of good vs. evil, the awesome jedi knights, even the older Obi Wan seemed cool and mysterious. It made you respect your elders even more, especially if they were wielding a light saber. That being said, there isn't anything negative I can say about Star Wars. Sure the tinkering Lucas does can be a bit frustrating, but I do love the improved special effects and some of the elements that tie the prequels into the originals. I didn't mind that Han shot first though. He was a bit of a rogue and a smartass, and I consider myself a professional smartass so I could relate. So when this series started I eagerly watched week after week as the story unfolded. The addition of Ahsoka was unexpected, but a great addition to the Star Wars Canon. Though, knowing what we know about the movies, we know Ahsoka isn't around, so there is a bit of sadness there. We know that Anakin's downfall was because he couldn't stand to lose the ones he loved. And, Ahsoka is part of his new family. Long before he betrays his friends and succumbs to the dark side, we get to see the man before the myth. A lot of people hated episode I because Anakin was so young, but the idea behind Lucas story is that you get to see the evolution of the character, or the de-evolution. You get to see how someone who is basically good can become something else. Sometimes desire turns to shame. Sometimes you're so blinded by doing the right thing that you do the wrong thing. You worry about the worst happening that you end up causing it to happen in a self-fulfilling prophecy. We all know Darth Sidious was pulling the strings, but we get to see how that affects Anakin who would become the most feared person in the galaxy. I do not own Season 3 YET, I own the first two on blu ray and am working on getting money for the third. However this was a great season, and as each season progresses the storyline tends to be a bit darker and a bit more violent, but as another reviewer stated it's not overdone. However it does show the real consequences of war and the realities that come with it. This is a story that probably should be supervised by a parent, so that they can explain these changes. That isn't to say that it's not for children, but it will challenge them a bit. Most children are intelligent enough to know this is just a tv show, but will also love how the show doesn't talk down to them. The lessons that the characters learn can be translated into real life, things like loyalty,friendship, sacrifice and knowing when to ask for help and knowing that everyone has limitations. This can easily be applied to the lives of non-jedis watching the show. The storylines are intelligent and fun to watch, and the special effects/animation are ahead of its time. sometimes you forget you are even watching animation, which is a sign that you are watching a quality show. When you care about the characters the same way that you would live actors playing the characters, that's the sign that you are watching great animation. I am glad this show is still on. I hope it is on for a while longer. But, with animation four years is a long time. Aside from the simpsons, animated shows usually do not last that long, but hopefully Lucas and his team have enough patience/time and money (though I'm sure he has enough money) to keep it going awhile longer. I get the feeling they do not want to end it too fast. They want the story to progress and the characters realised. That makes for good storytelling, and makes the end tragedy both anticipated and forboding. We all know what's going to happen in the end, but it's fun to see how they get there. I can not recommend this series enough. If you love star wars, this has the spirit of the movies in spades. So sit back and enjoy. It's something the whole family can watch together.",1316390400,,4500,4.371121718377088
4402494,5,B004LROMT8,"I really liked the 3rd Season of Star Wars the clone wars I think the story telling really got to be very, very good. I like the new outfits for Anakin, Ahsoka, and Obi-wan Kenobi. Of course the season finale with Chewbacca was only the icing on the cake for the end of the season. The episodes with Mortis or whatever planet they did with The Father, The Son, and the Daughter. It really showed off the really impressive ideas that floats around in George Lucas's head and that his crew did a very good job in making it look really good although the scenes in Mortis had me thinking I was watching a scene or 2 from the movie avatar with the floating rocks and other impressive stuff. I loved this Season of Star Wars The Clone Wars and I can't wait until the new episodes of the new season starts showing up it should be another great season.

It has continued to improve each season.  The making of materials that appeared in previous seasons illustrated the tremendous effort required to produce high quality episodes quickly and on-budget.

My favorite episode in season 3 was the red-on-red light saber fight between Dooku and Ventress.  This is stuff that some SW books describe, but we've never been able to see.  It is really well-done.",1315440000,3,586,5.0625
4402536,4,B004LROMT8,"The show has improved greatly since it started; the animation's been tweaked tremendously (particularly the fight scenes).  It's also a clever gateway for the younger generation to access the Star Wars universe. Those of us who'd like more in-depth exploration of the issues surrounding the Clone Wars, won't find that here.  The show is essentially a series of mission logs focused largely on one man... Anakin Skywalker.  One would think that after six movies and three seasons of this, we'd find out a little more about Palpatine, Yoda, Dooku or even Asoka Tano.
  I was even hoping that questions raised in the last two movies, would've been answered by now... like:  Who was Master Siphodius, How did he finance the creation of a Clone Army without anyone knowing, Why is secession from the Republic, grounds for military action, Why are the Jedi so willing to violate all of their mandates against slavery and warfare, to help Palpatine strong-arm worlds that want out...?
  It's a good show that could be great, if G. Lucas and the writers weren't so stuck on this one character.  There seems to be a real reluctance to expand the story, even to encompass the other main protagonists in any meaningful way... It's hard to understand",1314662400,12,1239,4.889952153110048

4402539,5,B004LROMT8,"I couldn't believe what I was seeing when I DVR'd and then watched the entire season 3. Combine the technology and characters found in the Star Wars movies with the backstories and immersion of the Essential Guide books, and you've got the Clone Wars TV episodes. Yes, they are CGI cartoons, but they're extremely well done - the Star Wars technology, the intricate stories never found in the movies, the soundtracks and the music. This is the Star Wars galaxy I was looking for in the prequels. Dozens of different planets, creatures and droids - all meticulously detailed and rendered. Aliens of all types. Action, with a minimum of Star Wars politics, and no awkward love stories. And these stories are dark and funny, perfect guilty pleasures for the Star Wars fan. Well done George Lucas - you can be proud of this new chapter in the Star Wars saga.",1309996800,38,854,4.7

4402542,5,B004LROMT8,"It was nice to see Padm`e so much in season 3 but all the politcal stuff at the beginning of the season got boring and was related to closely to what's actually going on in our own Republic allthough I still adore Satine. All I can say is there had damn well be more Anakin/Padm`e moments in season four and season five I mean come on it's getting close to the conception of Luke and Leia isn't it? I love the Anakin/Padm`e romance I loved the domestic sweet moments between them at the beginning of Evil Plans.

The Nightsisters triology eh it was half and half, allthough I am very interested also to see what there going to do with Darth Maul and Savage Opress and I have to admit I really felt sympathy for Ventress when they showed her past and her betrayal by Dooku.

I have to say though my favorite part of season 3 and the whole series so far is defenently, defenently defenenty the Mortis Trilogy, it was really cool and very creative and well written and it was great to see the voice actors from the Force Unleashed in the Mortis triology, and getting a deeper insight of the mysteries Force and Anakin's destiny as the chosen one, and in a way I think that the Mortis triology connected the destiny of the Skywalker's and connected the PT and OT really well, and it was also wonderful to see Chewie, hopefully will get to see a young Han to since we have already seen Greedo, Tarkin and Chewie and I have to say my favorite episode of the Mortis Triology was Overlords basically because I love Shmi and Qui-Gon and it was soo cool to see Liam Neeson and Pernilla Augusta reprise there roles as Qui-Gon Jinn and Shmi Skywalker I had a feeling that Pernilla Augusta would reprise her role but frankly I was a little surprised that Liam Neeson agreed to reprise his role (plus I've always been a Qui-Gon/Shmi shipper.)

Altar of Mortis was pretty neat, and in Ghost of Mortis we got a forshadow of Anakin's fall at first I was a little nervious to see them have Anakin see his fate but still end up falling so I was actually glad when the Father erased his memories, but I guess it makes sense because then Anakin probablly wouldn'tve fallen if he already knew his fate, and, but it really got to me when Anakin said to the father ""I am the cause of so much pain."" Great reading Matt Lanter and also the agonized look on his face when the son shows Anakin strangleing his beloved Padm`e with the Force and everything else that he sees!

Hmmm I'm kinda of starting to wish that Matt Lanter would've had played Anakin in the movies, he does such a good job at it and he puts a lot of emotion and effort into Anakin's character and Cat Taber does a really great job at doing Padm`e's voice, she defentnly puts a lot more emotion and passion into it then Natalie did, allthough, Natalie did really well in Episode III especially with the Mustafar scene and when Obi-Wan reveals to Padm`e about Anakin falling to the darkside, allthough Hayden Christansen did really well in Episode III and so did Ewan McGreggor and Natalie Portman. Most people already know what happends to Anakin, and I love how much Ahsoka has grown and matured since season 1, and I loved her new outfit as well as Anakin and Obi-Wans they defenently look a lot closer to there Episode III characters, but Dave Filoni said that it was purley intentional and well it was really cool to see sparkage between Ahsoka and Lux in Heroes on Both Sides and well you can tell that Ashley Eckstein is having a blast doing the voice of Ahsoka and I think the biggest question for me and other Star War's fans whats going to be the fate of Ahsoka and Rex? Since they aren't in episode III.

8434625,5,B004LROMT8,"Before deciding to watch through this entire show, I was informed that it gets better as it goes along, so even if I didn't like the first season or two of the show, I should still stick with it to see where it goes. While I did enjoy the first season, it clearly had its flaws (mainly because it focused too much on being a childrens show), but the second season amped up the quality enough for me to be very entertained. Season three starts out well enough, although it didn't have this huge jump in quality that I was originally expecting, so while I was still enjoying it, I would be lying if I said I wasn't just a little disappointed at first. However, the second half of this season (literally, episode 12 of 22) is where the series goes from a good animated show to a great animated show, and I loved it. Season three as a whole is a solid season of Star Wars television, but the second half is what I have been waiting for with this series.

 Much like my season two review, Im going to review the season by looking at the episodes in order, but not every episode (just the ones that I had some interesting thoughts on). First up is the opening episode, Clone Cadets, which focuses on a group of clones in training who just cant seem to work together to pass and become real clone troopers. This was an OK episode, but I didn't love it and was disappointed that the first episode of the season didn't have a powerful start. It was just too predictable for my tastes, as you know that they will pass by the end (sorry for the small spoiler). A couple episodes later is Supply Lines, which I thought was a pretty good episode, as it features political moments (done well), some decent action, and even some memorable deaths. It deals with the Republic trying to defend a planet from the Separatists, while Senator Bail Organa and Jar Jar (whos not all that annoying) try to negotiate with a neutral planet for help. I think that this episode encapsulates very well what this series is trying to do, as it features a little bit of everything and does most of it very well. It was pretty good.

 The following episode is another alright episode (Sphere of Influence), but I admire that one of the central characters of the show is modeled after Star Wars creator George Lucas, so that made the episode a little better. Another couple episodes later is The Academy, which I didn't like because its premise is about a group of children trying to save the day and it was just plain annoying. Having children characters save the day can be done very well (see Avatar: The Last Airbender), but it is not an easy task and I think that they flopped with this one. Another episode later is once again, just OK, but the end features the bounty Hunter Aurra Sing. Im going to spoil a little bit of the episode here, but something that really grinds my gears about this series is how inconsistent force powers are. The ending has Aurra Sing aiming to shoot Ahsoka, who blocks her fire with her lightsaber; Ahsoka then gets shot and Padme has to shoot Aurra to save the day. Why didn't Ahsoka just use the Force to pull Aurras guns away? I know that this might seem nitpicky for a ten-second segment in a 22-minute episode, but scenes like this happen too many times throughout the series and it can sometimes ruin the tension because you never know if Jedi are going to have their powers nerfed or not. But I digress, moving on.

 The next episode, Evil Plans, is very enjoyable because it features the wonderful pair of C-3PO (human-cyborg relations) and R2-D2, along with one of the best characters introduced in the show, Cad Bane. It was a good episode, but one of the biggest weaknesses of this first season was the lack of chronology between all these episodes. If they want to have 11 episodes about different stories, thats fine, but some of these episodes take place before season one episodes and others take place after. One such example is the opening, Clone Cadets, which takes place before the episode Rookies in season one, but then the following episode, Arc Troopers, takes place after Rookies. It creates a weird flow when watching the episodes in this order. While I am aware of their being a chronological order to this show, I usually prefer watching these shows in broadcast or production order, to view it as the original audiences viewed it. Maybe this show is one of the instances where chronological order is best, but seeing as how thats not the way Im doing it, I cant comment on its effectiveness.

 To close off my thoughts for the first half of the season, I want to say that I still enjoyed it, I was just a little disappointed. The last couple episodes (10 and 11, I believe) feature Padme as one of the protagonists, which doesnt work well. Padme isn't a bad character when paired with other, more interesting characters (shes a good foil for Anakin, for example), but she is very weak when she is the focus. Also, these episodes have way too much political focus. I know that I praised this for an earlier episode, but it has to be done right and/or with a balance of other elements; I don't think that these last couple Padme episodes did that. However, things change for the better when we get to episode 12, Nightsisters.

 First things first, I love the new design of the characters in this season. Nightsisters isn't the first episode to feature them, but either way, the new designs of the main characters of Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Ahsoka are all great, with the former two receiving outfits much closer to their Revenge of the Sith versions (more robes, less armor). The opening of this particular episode reminds me of the opening to that same film, as Obi-Wan and Anakin are flying through space and blasting enemy ships down (this is good because Siths opening is one of the best Star Wars sequences, in my opinion). After landing their ships, they get into a duel with Asajj Ventress that is very well done  the animation really improves with this season and I think that this is the first episode to really showcase that. I don't want to spoil exactly what happens, but the plot itself is also done well and there is a great montage sequence in the episode that gives a lot of backstory to Ventress in a very brief amount of time. Ive never cared too much for her character, but that sequence was done wonderfully and this was the best episode of the season when I first watched it. Even better, the story arc continues in two more episodes.

 The next episode features Savages origins (a powerful man of the same species as Darth Maul) and it is interesting. I cant say that I love it or hate it  I just find it interesting with the direction they took and I was/am fascinated to see where this character goes. Also, Clancy Brown voices Savage and that is always a win. The episode ends with Savage brutally (well, for childrens show) defeating clone troopers and killing two Jedi  I thought that they did a great job showing the ruthless nature of this character, while also providing some great action. The final episode of this trilogy features some great fight sequences, including a mix of both 2v1 and 1v1v1 fights that are stunning. I don't want to specify who is fighting whom, but the 1v1v1 fight features only villains and it is stunning to watch. Overall, this batch of episodes of was superb and if the series can continue this quality, or at least have some episodes of this same quality every now and then, then Ill be a happy viewer. Luckily, the quality gets even better with the next episode, Overlords.

 Overlords is currently my favorite episode of the series. It does everything right in its approach: the episode has a beautiful art direction (with a scenery that continues to change throughout the episode), it oozes with atmosphere due to the wonderful style and dark plot that is portrayed, and has some great character interaction (featuring a brief pairing of Obi-Wan and Ahsoka and appearances from Qui-Gon and Anakins mother). The episode explains very little, but that is what makes it so wonderful; neither the characters nor the audience knows exactly what is going on and it fits so perfectly with the story. The entire episode features great music and cinematography (both in lighting and camera placement), but the ending is where everything comes together perfectly. It features a rotating camera that shows both light and dark on Anakins face (showing his dual-nature), powerful choir music, and glimpses of Anakins true power as the Chosen One. Its easily my favorite scene in the series thus far and it is just a superb episode  theres even Sam Witwer (the Apprentice from The Force Unleashed) voicing the Son character, and hes fantastic. I already loved the last arc, but this episode is the high point of the series and I loved every minute of the opening episode. Nothing short of phenomenal!

 Like the last arc, this one is also three episodes and although neither of the follow-up episodes are quite as good as the first one, they are still excellent episodes. The second episode features an evil version of Ahsoka who is not only written well, but acted flawlessly. Ive never given much thought to Ashley Ecksteins portrayal, but she does a fantastic job of portraying Ahsokas darker side  major props. Once again, the series also features more lightsaber action (still done well, I might add), but my only gripe with this episode and the next is that Anakin has trouble stopping the enemy, even though he does it relatively easily in the first episode. There might be a logical reason why, but if there is, it isn't explained too well. However, thats just a nitpick, because the episodes are so well done anyways. The final episode of the trilogy features a wonderful scene where Anakin sees pieces of his future and the things he does, also done phenomenally. The episode that I was the most excited for out of this whole series was this one because of that specific scene and I cant say that I was disappointed with the end result. Kevin Kiner also does some great work with the music, as he has for the whole series and especially this story arc. I know that I sound redundant, but once again, this arc was fantastic and is currently my favorite of the series. Brilliant!

 The penultimate arc in this season (also three episodes) features another great story, as it deals with a prison infiltration/rescue mission, but when you combine this with the fun Star Wars characters and world, it makes for a great trio of episodes. The episodes introduce Tarkin to the Clone Wars universe, played excellently by Stephen Stanton, and I love the way that they portray Anakins relationship with him  its done very well and made me appreciate their scenes together in A New Hope much more. The prison warden, who acts as the primary antagonist, is played by James Arnold Taylor (who is also Obi-Wan) doing a funny Christopher Walken impression, so that was enjoyable. The episodes also feature some action-packed Jedi fights, with a total of four of them battling droids and enemy forces. Finally, the episodes feature the death of a character and the scene is done really well, with some more excellent music. Is this arc as good as the last two? It doesnt matter, because it is still wonderful.

 The last two episodes deal with Ahsoka being separated form Anakin and having to survive on an island while being hunted for sport. I love the idea of Ahsoka having to survive without Anakin or any Jedi Masters to guide her, especially since she has matured a lot as a character since her introduction. The episode features some of the best music and action sequences in the show, as the music has this wonderful jungle vibe and the action features multiple Jedi climbing and jumping through the jungle trees  its great to look at and Ahsokas fighting style suits this environment really well (I love that she has her own unique way of fighting, with lots of acrobatics involved). Finally, the episode also features Chewbacca in the season finale and hes cool  nothing special happens, but he is a fun addition to the story. It was a great way to end the season.

 This season is, for me, the best season of the show so far. I may have seemed very critical with the first half, but that is only because I wanted this big jump in quality to happen. I would say that it is just as good as season two, but the second half of this season is amazing, so I think that it is better than the previous season when you consider it all together. I loved almost every aspect of it, especially Overlords  such a wonderful episode. I don't know when Ill finally get around to watching the fourth season, but I am ready to see what this show still has to offer; so far, its been a fun ride.",1514592000,,12755,4.590949033391916
