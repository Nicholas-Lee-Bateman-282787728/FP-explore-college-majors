8339297,5,B001S0BMQM,"I only use the DVD's for my Bible groups as the binder makes it too academic, time consuming and boring for most people.  I have had great success showing the DVD and then using questions (a lot from Jeff's talk) on how this applies to my life!  The Bible is and instruction manual, not an academic exercise.",1398556800,,308,4.385964912280702
8339298,5,B001S0BMQM,"I can't find the words to describe the debth of information in this series...
It is written buy  Jeff Cavins, brilliant author and theologian, twelve years as a Protestant pastor, returned to the Catholic faith.
His teaching like threads of a tapestry, scripture being shown to the viewer like never seen or heard in such
unadulterated way. Connecting Old and New testament. For any religion or denomination, who want to know just what
the connection is between the Old and New covenant from the deposit of faith, (over 2,000 years)",1397088000,,532,4.911111111111111
8339299,5,B001S0BMQM,"You promised to send the great adventures matthew  dvd, I did not receive the dvd set, instead I received the workbook, I was very disappointed, I had made arrangements to have a bible study in my home. I am familiar with the great adventures of matthew, my dissatisfaction was with who ever was to ship the product. I am reluctant to order again. I have had good results in the past from Amazon & I did get my refund but it required a telephone call.",1396396800,,451,4.305882352941176

8339301,5,B001S0BMQM,"We are going through the Gospel of Matthew on cd, we are into the 20th week and I enjoy
it more and more. Jeff is very good, makes the Bible understandable and brings it to life.
I look forward to each new week.",1361750400,2,211,3.9302325581395348
8339302,3,B001S0BMQM,"We used this series for a 24-week study of the Gospel of Matthew in our parish.  Cavins is a man of great faith and he's generally orthodox and reliable, though at times he presents as settled doctrine something that isn't.  The quality of each session is inconsistent, though that is to be expected since he seems to have filmed the series over 24 weeks.  Some sessions are dynamic and on-target, others are dull and bogged down in details, and at times he passes over whole sections of a chapter without much (or any) comment.  We found that our Bible study participants mostly enjoyed the series, though they are interested in hearing from someone else after 24 weeks of Cavins.",1314144000,,681,4.697478991596639
