8696289,5,B00RYBNSFW,"Mr. Peter P. Fuchs you were asked to review the DVD...not to give us your BIAS less than theological opinions. Fr. Charles P. Connor S.T.L., Ph. D. does an excellent job of summarizing the Catechism of the Catholic Church...if people want to sincerely learn about and understand why the Catholic Church teaches and believes what she teaches on faith and morals this is a ""sure norm"" (St. Pope John Paul II).

Strongly recommend this DVD.",1442102400,6,437,4.826666666666667
8696290,1,B00RYBNSFW,"They have not learned anything, truly.. Even after  the Abuse Scandal: Lying Is Still A-OK For Them! This theologian Charles Connor very helpfully  allows the general viewer to peer into the current thinking of the Catholic Church on lying and cover-ups. To understand the radically of the view he espouses lets just state the obvious. The world is full of lies, as everyone knows, and they are part of the grease of social life for everyone except maybe the insane. But there are lies, and then  there are serious lies. People and organizations have a right to privacy, but not a right to keep doing the same foolishness and covering up. this does not pass any smell test for the "":common good"". But to listen to Connor's disquisition of the 8th Commandment you would come away with the distinct impression that ANYTHING that the Catholic Church happens to think of as against some notion of social order they favor, or something tending to ""scandal"", is completely included in the morally justified need for frank lying. I was amazed , and appalled, that Connor in this series gives the absolute widest and most expansive  view of what can justify lying. In fact, there was a support by him of the idea that ANYTHING that there is NO RIGHT to information, even for lawful governmental authorities, to ""information"" if the Catholic Church somehow feels that it goes against ""truth"". -----Naturally, and very predictably he dragged out the Nazi example again. Of course you have right to lie to vicious Nazis trying to find a Jewish family. But as a descendent of Holocaust survivors myself, I frankly find it insulting at this point that they are using that example to justify their continued erasure of any sane boundary lying to authorities. For there was zero in Connor's wide description that would preclude a Catholic hierarch today from continuing to stymie lawful authorities on grave matters like the abuse of children with lies. For all they need to internally assess is some feeling that the authorities are vexing the Catholic  Church position in the ""social order"" (Connor's own assertion!!!) in order to continue lying. The sane alternative to this is first simply to admit that this organization has a long interest in secretive information. Then to recognize that it cannot be absolute, even when they have a moral justification available  by theology. That means further that there has to be some mechanism to add at least a dose of doubt both about the theology, and the assessment. If not it is just a closed system  which could EASILY produce another abuse scandal in no time, despite their assertions of the Catholic Church being ""the safest place for children."" In the real world, there nothing wrong with people or organizations having some secrets. The problem comes in when there is not real ethos  that allows for error-coorrection, or when dogma blinkers that possibility. This is precisely the dangerous conundrum the Catholic Church has gotten itself into on these issues of lying. That they are still there after the horrible revelations of the last decade or so is really a terrible indictment of the superficiality of many of their governing ideas, if not the religious ones.",1436659200,,3207,4.925925925925926
