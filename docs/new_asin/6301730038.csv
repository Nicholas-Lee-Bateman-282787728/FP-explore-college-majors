365424,4,6301730038,"It is interesting to consider that just a century (give or take a decade) before people in airplanes and spaceships were looking down on East Africa, the source of the Nile was as unknown as it had been in Caesar's lifetime. The discovery of the source of the Nile was one of the last prizes for European explorers during the 19th century, and that is the starting point for this film, which chronicles the expeditions of Richard Burton and John Speke, their friendship and eventual falling-out over the debate as to whether the source had been discovered.
I very much enjoyed ""Mountains of the Moon"", and could have happily watched a longer version, but I also have to admit that this movie doesn't succeed as much as I hoped it would. It is a well made movie, beautifully filmed on location in Africa. The script is intelligent and seems (to me) to be historically accurate to the extent that is possible in a two-hour film. The acting and music are fine. But somehow all of the ingredients don't come together into a fully successful film. I had the idea that I enjoyed the film because I already knew a lot about the subject, but someone without that knowledge might have a more difficult time with it. Overall this is a very good effort, and much credit has to be given for making a film about an African historical subject. Recommended, but especially for anyone who has already read a book or two about Burton, Speke, and East Africa.",1010966400,4,1441,4.589147286821706
365425,5,6301730038,"Well, I guess I know why great historical epics aren't made much anymore.  Because Bob Rafelson made a hell of a good one here, with Mountains of the Moon, and it bombed at the box office.  Too bad, because this rates right up there with the best of them, Lawrence of Arabia & The Man Who Would Be King, etc.
The story of Burton & Speke and the search for the source of the Nile, it is grand adventure done modern-style, showing just how dangerous and crazy this kind of effort really was.  In their first try, both men were nearly killed with Speke captured and both arms and thighs neatly punctured by spear (in anticipation of even worse to come) and Burton getting a spear shoved through one side of his cheek & out the other.  They barely managed to make their escape & return to England.
Yet they both returned to Africa to take up the quest again, and an arduous and ghastly journey it was as well, with danger and death and disease plaguing their every step.
This is wonderful stuff...two crazy white Englishmen roaming around uncharted Africa all in the name of charting a river to its source, all in the name of fame, discovery & adventure.  Then they return and have a falling-out and a public controversy.
Real people, this is Sir Richard Burton, translator of the Arabian Nights and various erotic literature, brilliant, unorthodox and unconventional, he is wonderfully played with vitality and humor and charisma by Patrick Bergin.  John Hanning Speke is a disciplined and courageous explorer & friend, but troubled and conflicted sexually & emotionally. He too, is wonderfully played by Ilain Glen.
All the supporting cast is fine, and the photography and location filming is fabulous.  The complications of the relationships, Burton and his wife, Burton & Speke, Speke & his probable lover, the publisher's son, etc. are detailed and interesting.  And the trek itself is a ripping good one!
So, what else do you want in an epic adventure?  Works for me.",1007596800,7,1969,4.733918128654971
365426,5,6301730038,"This is one of those truly excellent films that you remember and want to see again and again.  And each time you see it, you see more deeply rather than more limitations.
It is the semi-fictionalised story of Richard Burton's attempt to find the souces of the Nile in the 19C, across huge stretches of uncharted Africa. While he appears larger than life, Burton really was an awe-inspiring character - a true pioneer who appears so modern for his time, respecting non-European cultures and learning their languages.  It was he who first translated the 1001 and one Nights; if not for him, we might not have known the story of Alladin and hundreds of others.
The characters are subtle and multi-faceted in this film.  And the adventure was very real.  You encounter hostle tribes with unique cultures, religions, and architecture, whose politics were deadly dangerous.  (Burton split his palette when a spear entered his cheek during a night raid.)  You see the machinations of scientist-explorers of the Victorian era, including a hilarious scene where Livingston and Burton compare scars.  And then there is Burton's relationship with his partner Speake, who may have also been his lover.  It is so fascinating that you wil want to learn more in the several fine biographies of Burton that exist.

Ten years later, and I still haven't had  a meaningful, or even a passing discussion with anyone who has seen this  movie.  Fans are few and far between, but they ARE in the know.

365544,5,6301730038,"Burton was a fascinating man check out  Thomas Wright's bio, The Life of Sir Richard Burton. Indiana Jones has absolutely nothing on the real-life adventures of Burton and Bergin does a brilliant job with this role. In fact, I would say that this is Bergin's best performance. His issues with Speake, with the aristocracy, and various difficulties make this fellow all the more interesting. I, and a good million others like me will always retain a fair bit of anger towards his wife, who ultimately betrayed him with his voluminous final work.
Google the tomb of Burton and you'll see the inspiration for the monument in the Lara Croft movie. And to think it  was possible to actually see into that interestingly decorated shrine (at least when the glass was still clear).
Again, Bergen does an excellent job and the story is fairly well told. Check out Wright's book on Gutenberg. If you are interested in Burton's Arabian Nights, various versions are available on Amazon and the 17 volume edition is available via the Internet (well used over several generations, but available).",1438819200,,1082,4.93956043956044

It never received the acclaim that it should have, in all probability because it dealt with a true historical event rather than something more glitzy and action-filled.

Gorgeous locations, sincere depictions of African peoples and the mentality of Victorian Brits, crisp dialogue and wonderful exposes of human relations prevail in this  brilliantly directed and acted film.

Troubled John Hanning Speke, on leave from service in India, joins iconoclastic adventurer, spy, linguist, author, proto-ethnologist and all around MAN, Richard Burton, on an journey to discover the source of the Nile. Along the way they meet both hostile and friendly Africans, become friends, suffer great privations [ it is said Burton's syphilis was cured by his terribly high fevers], encounter a high culture and eventually become estranged over their argument as to the actual source of the Nile.

Patrick Bergin is warm, intelligent and compassionate as the unconventional Burton, super versatile Iain Glenn is terrific as the troubled and dyslexic Speke [though in reality rumors of homosexuality followed Burton after his inquires into male brothels in India and not Speke, who hooked up with an Ugandan royal wife]. Delroy Lindo is luminous as an escaped slave/medicine man and Fiona Shaw inhabits her role as Isobel Burton as if she was born to it.  Highly, highly recommended.

Speke was portrayed by Iain Glen, while the role of Burtons wife went to Fiona Shaw. In a great scene, they are captured and held hostage by an African chieftain, who is played as a spoilt, barbaric and cruel tyrant.

Without an awareness of this, no sense can be made of the events that transpire in ""Mountains of the Moon"". The book, like the film equally authored by William Harrison, suggests situations later distorted by biographers, simply for lack of an understanding of the sensibilities and subtleties involved.  Not only are reading and writing skills affected.  Dyslexics having been mocked and rebuked throughout their childhood find themselves affected as well by an assault on their self-esteem, and they become overly sensitive as adults, easily slighted but poorly equipped to fight back or ascertain the causes of a real or imagined rebuff.  Disregarding snide inferences of homosexuality in their respective biographies, Burton and Speke, relying principally on each other, had survived the impossible.  Male friendships go far beyond the sexual. Deep bonds had been formed from their experiences in Africa.  Yet these were distorted when Speke, using his intuition (a fine quality, accentuated in the dyslexic), finds a lake which he fails to properly explore, and feels himself diminished when Burton, having been victimized, drugged and appalled by his treatment and its consequences in the native camp, squelches Speke's enthusiasm over his discovery.  When the nearly illiterate Speke returns to England, ahead of Burton, the time is used by unscrupulous relatives and a manipulation of the press, aiming to benefit by a rift between the travelers.  Had dyslexia not played its role Burton and Speke would have returned to Africa together, with proper exploration and scientific analysis, to prove Lake Victoria the principal source of the Nile and head of a system of lesser lakes. Speke, however, was told he had been slighted by the man he idolized, and he responded as dyslexics do.  Why do we feel contempt for his gullibility?  Why did he react so radically when he thought, in effect, ""Dick doesn't love me anymore.""  Burton was also bereft, so much that he failed to investigate and was unable to clarify directly with the man who had been like a brother, a son, an intimate cohort.  The misunderstanding destroyed the life of both these men.  Speke, in despair, killed himself, and Burton was condemned to a life of mediocrity, as a second-rate diplomat, allowed only superficial use of his exceptional linguistic skills, as a translator.  The geographical triumph of the century was reduced to the proportions of a Greek tragedy.  The book, however, is compelling and the film is superb, the Zanzibar sequences shot on the beguiling island of Lamu on the Indian Ocean coast.",1382918400,,2883,5.1965442764578835
365673,5,6301730038,I originally borrowed this movie from a friend and loved it. It is a pretty accurate account of Sir Richard Burton's expeditions into Africa looking for where the Nile river originates from. It is hard to believe anyone would could live through such horrific conditions and keep coming back for more. Very beautiful scenes and a interesting look at the English Geographical Societies and their competitions with the Americans and others hoping to be the first one to discover where the Nile begins.,1382400000,,498,5.0120481927710845
365674,4,6301730038,"The only reason I'm rating this at four stars is because the film is so good.  The transfer is subpar at best.  It is indeed widescreen, but within a 4x3 format.  What this means is that the picture you see on a 16x9 tv is only about half of what should be there, IF the studio had done the transfer correctly, which they didn't.  This can be solved by using the zoom function available on many tv sets, but only at the cost of distorting the picture and magnifying grain.  This is a crying shame, because as other reviewers have noted, ""Mountains of the Moon"" is a criminally ignored film.  Personally, I'd wait for a better transfer to come on the market.  But if you must watch the film,  I recommend buying the 2002 Artisan Entertainment dvd release, as it has slightly better picture quality.  However, it also has the trouble with 4x3 format that I mentioned earlier.  The 2002 version lacks the ""making of"" special feature, but that's no loss, because it's as dull as dishwater.  I've seen dvds of movies that were 30 years older than this one, yet looked far better.  Shame on these studios!  Other people have already expounded on the plot, acting, etc., so I won't bother.  Bottom line: can I recommend buying it?  That's a tough call.  If you can rent/borrow it first, or buy it at a dirt cheap price, I'd say yes.

365678,5,6301730038,"I haven't actually bought this from Amazon, but felt like reviewing it as its one of my favourite films. The film stars Patrick Bergin and Iain Glen, who are Richard Francis Burton and John Hanning Speke respectively, and its set in the mid-19th century when Africa was still largely unexplored and called 'the dark continent'. Most British people I suspect, until this movie came out, had not heard of Burton or Speke, and are probably also a little ignorant of the mid-Victorian period to be honest.

The film is about high adventure in Africa, oneupmanship at every turn, the clash between ideas and different cultures, and ultimately a friendship that turns sour, amongst other things. Burton was a brilliant intellectual and linguist who knew lots of different languages fluently and was also a sexual adventurer and a bit of a lad to be frank; a man in some ways out of his time. Speke was essentially an upper-class gentleman with more establishment connections than Burton, and its hinted in the film that he is gay and finds Burton attractive. Anyway, that aside, the film is brilliantly shot and produced, and although an exciting romp through Africa to get to the source of the Nile, there are enough sub-plots and sidelines and little stories to keep you interested. And the music? The music is masterful and powerful and draws you into the film; I think if a good film has good music, the film can become great. Just look at the Godfather.

The film often was dark and I couldn't make out things in it, I guess to convey the darkness idea.  I on the other hand lived 100 miles from the Mountains of the Moon and 150 from the source of the Nile, lake Victoria.  There was so much light one had to wear sunglasses.  There was so much green in the grasslands and forests most of the year, except during their ""winter"" or dry season.  So I had a hard time recognizing the East Africa I knew with what was shown in the film.  The people for the most part were very welcoming and friendly, but of course by that time they had been under British rule for some time.

Speke and Burton were portrayed well by the actors, who I am not holding accountable for my lukewarm rating.  Both fulfilled the expectations I had developed after having read about Speke and Burton, both very remarkable men.

Burton seemed to have a broader purpose for searching for the Nile source, to learn about everything he could along the way.  Speke had a single mindedness that is admirable, but to what end, one must ask.  The search for the Holy Grail has never succeeded.  The search for the source of the Nile finally did, but at what cost, and for what purpose other than to satisfy an intellectual itch?  And Ethiopians may still argue that their Blue Nile produces much more water for the river than the White Nile that comes from Uganda and that loses much of its water in the spongy swamps of the Sudan.

The quest had long term adverse affects on African development on a continent that has struggled with civil war, genocide, famine, drought, and terrorism over the past 50 some years.  Once the Europeans became involved in Africa, tribal boundaries were disrupted; some countries were formed, like Uganda, out of many completely different ethnic groups where 26 different languages are spoken.  When a leader emerged who wanted the best for his nation, like Patrice Lumumba of the Congo, his assassination was arranged by western powers because they could better .access Congo's rich mineral resources with corrupt leadership.  Lumumba's assassination is documented in a congressional inquiry led by Senator Frank Church in the 1970's.  This inquiry led Congress to enact a law that prevented the U.S. from being involved in any more assassinations of foreign leaders.

The film could not be expected to portray the consequences of European discovery, but it could have suggested at the end that consequences would occur and they would not necessarily be favorable to Africa.

Mountains of the Moon

It's criminal that Bob Rafelson's ""Mountains of the Moon"" didn't receive more promotion and distribution when it was released.
Both Patrick Bergin (as Burton)  and Iain Glen (as Speke) deserved awards for their performances. Burton's peripatetic curiosity took him to India, the Middle East (where he was one of the first Europeans to enter Mecca) and East Africa.  Along the way he had his jaw shattered by a native spear, his African bearers were slaughtered, and Speke was nearly killed.
 He also met his future wife Isabel (Fiona Shaw).

The story by William Harrison and Rafelson closely follows the two English explorers' quest for the source of the Nile. The lush cinematography wonderfully captures the beauty of both Africa and Victorian England.

This period piece captures the Victorian obsession with exploration and discovery for both academic and commercial purposes. The friendship--love, if you will -- between Burton and Speke is shattered when Speke returns to England and claims exclusive credit for the discovery of the source of the Nile. Burton sees that Speke is being used by the Royal Geographical Society to promote the Empire's interests in Africa. He recognizes that there is a thin line between exploration and exploitation, and that Britain's interests are in Empire, not discovery.  There is a great scene where Burton is being held captive while Speke goes ahead to search for the lake. The natives drug Burton, and when he sees them dancing around him apparently preparing to feast on him, he laughs ""The Bloody Royal Geographic Society!""

""Mountains of the Moon"" follows in the tradition of epics like ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" telling the story of larger than life characters in hostile environments. Burton was a true renaissance man: geographer, ethnographer, sexologist, linguist, journalist.  His extensive journals provide much of the background narrative of the film.

 I can't understand why Patrick Bergin hasn't had a bigger film career - I can see him as a younger Harrison Ford .",1309046400,4,2203,5.526785714285714

I even bought some books after seeing the moving to learn even more about Speke and Sir Burton.  I wish there were more movies like this one.",1308182400,2,497,4.8352941176470585
365719,5,6301730038,"MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON is a twenty-year-old film that is beginning to find an audience via DVD release and word of mouth.  Until now it has been a well-kept secret, having disappeared after a too brief run at the box office in competition with such blockbusters as The Godfather Part III, Dances with Wolves, The Hunt for red October, Ghost, GoodFellas, Ghost, Pretty Woman and a host of others in that prime year.  But as a cinematic achievement it was not like the O'Neill 'Misbegotten', just Forgotten.  Perhaps now time has erased the problem of initial anonymity and we are impressed with this epic story based on the novel by William Harrison that explores the life and psyche of Sir Richard Burton, who with Dr David Livingstone (Bernard Hill),  was one of the greatest British explorers of the 19th century.

The time is 1864 and Sir Richard Burton (Patrick Bergin, in a multifaceted magnificent performance that was Oscar worthy) gathers financial backing to set out on an expedition to search for the source of the Nile River somewhere in East Africa.  He is joined by the somewhat cocky but brilliant John Hanning Speke (Iain Glen): Burton seeks to understand the many cultural aspects of the tribes he will encounter while Speke brings guns and dreams on conquering the heathen natives that may block their discovery. They set off to East Africa and being their trek on foot across the impossibly difficult terrain, encountering every hardship imaginable including hostile tribes who are part of the current slavery business.  Burton brings along one Sidi Bombay (Paul Onsongo) who speaks all the languages of the various tribes and knows the terrain.  Burton and Speke grow in their friendship and admiration for each other, saving each other's lives during attacks, and caring for each other's subsequent wounds.  At one point Burton encounters a runaway slave Mabruki (Delroy Lindo) and honors his ancestry and knowledge of Africa: when Mabruki is later captured by a tribe and is yoke of slavery is restored, Burton is enraged and rather than seeing his friend suffer he performs the euthanasia  that Mabruki requests.  Burton comes down with bilateral lower extremity cellulitis and requires incision and drainage and Speke stays by his side during recovery: at this point in time it is suggested that Burton and Speke had a loving physical relationship, a theme that history books reinforce.  Eventually Burton sends Speke to proceed on the quest to find the source of the Nile, Speke discovers Lake Victoria and though Burton is uncertain as to the end of the expedition (believing that their are several lakes that feed the Nile) they return to England victorious.

Once in England Burton marries a rather feisty feminist Isabel Arundell (Fiona Shaw) and together they face the fact that the Royal Academy is touting Speke as the discoverer of the Nile Source.  Through a series of lies and ill-advised plans Speke is lauded and Burton is to debate Speke before the Royal Academy.  But Speke's love for Burton as well as his knowledge that the discovery is not his alone drives Speke to suicide.  And the subsequent order of events is shared with the audience in written form as the film ends.

There are so many superlative actors in this huge film that space does not allow mention of them all. The various tribes in Africa are resplendent in their costumes and customs and cinematographer Roger Deakins captures every aspect of the locations in both Africa and in England beautifully.  The musical score by Michael Small is equally fine and Bob Rafelson's direction is tight and focused and yet lets us appreciate the vastness of the African countryside as well as the intimate moments between the actors.  This is a magnificent epic film and while it may not be absolutely true to history it does give us a sense of that British obsession with conquering the unknown.  Highly recommended.

The nineteenth-century English explorer, writer and linguist Sir Richard Francis Burton was one of the most interestingly remarkable people ever to live; his wife Isabel was certainly ahead of her time, as well, and so it is fitting that these extraordinary individuals receive the star treatment they did in a film of this quality. I was pleased start to finish by the often gritty and just as often stunningly beautiful Mountains of the Moon as it changed setting from (darkest!) Africa to (oft-darker still) Victorian Britain and told of Burton's expedition to discover the source of earth's greatest river, the Nile. The story of the Burtons as a couple is at once a meeting of comparable minds, of great adventure, and of love.

As both men lived extraordinary lives, a film can only touch on the ""highpoints"" and turn the story into something akin to a Hollywood tested ""entertainment piece"", however, this particular historical narrative requires no embellishments, because their lives and experiences have become the stuff of legend.

One of the numerous reasons Mountains of the Moon is such a great film is its historical accuracy, beginning with Burton and Speke's first meeting and the subsequent tragedy on expedition in the African territory now known as Somalia. On a mere Survey expedition, late at night their camp was attacked, ending with a spear through Burton's cheek and jaw and Speke being taken prisoner, tortured and his legs broken. Because the natives ran scared over a superstition, (not conveyed in the film) the two managed to escape. Because Captain Burton headed this particular expedition, its failure would haunt his career for many years.

The director and producer(s) aimed for the epic grandeur of a David Lean film such as Laurance of Arabia or Doctor Zhivago and, when one listens to the beautiful sound track and the breathtaking cinematography of the African landscape will see that they achieved their outcome, as the film's quality is absolutely superb.

Having grown into a Burton admirer and completes, studying and gathering everything known about this unusual and fringe genius, Mountains of the Moon is a worthy addition because of its quality production and its genuine attempt at historical accuracy on the lives of these (R) romantic individuals, the last truly earthbound explorers (Aside from the Australian and European Explores of Antarctica) who have been forgotten in the chaos of triviality in the 21st century.

Speke doesn't have a great deal of proof that the lake is the source; indeed, Burton doesn't believe it. He and Burton are to debate their opposing points of view before the Royal Geographical Society when Speke dies in a hunting accident. It took another 12 years to prove Speke's assertion.

The real-life Richard Burton squeezed into one lifetime more adventure and scholarship than a half-dozen men could ever hope to collectively attain, and the movie captures that feeling perfectly. Emphasis is on the violence and difficulty of the expedition and little on the ensuing controversy, so the movie skews toward being an adventure story only. One wishes for more in-depth character development, but the movie is an excellent one all the same. [Burton was an incredibly fascinating person and I recommend people reading any of the many recent biographies on the man.]",1135382400,5,1219,4.946341463414634

365798,5,6301730038,"This is one of those films that you don't want to end, is over much too soon, but which leaves you feeling it had to be longer than its actual running time, it is so full of drama and covers so much ground. It is a rich and rewarding piece of storytelling with a great sense of the Victorian age when the location of the source of the Nile was considered the greatest of all unknowns. To the best of my knowledge the film is also historically accurate.

Now if only we could expect the release of the equally superb 1972 docu-drama series ""The Search For The Nile"" it would make the perfect companion to this great film.",1085011200,9,620,4.254237288135593

It is a letterbox edition that thinks it is full screen.  I had difficulty getting a wide image on a 16x9 screen (black bars on top bottom and sides), but on a regular TV got a letterbox image.  Black saturation is not great on the image.  I think it was probably transfered to DVD from a letterbox videotape.  It would be nice if Artisan re-did this movie as a widescreen anamorphic DVD from the original 35mm print.

365830,5,6301730038,"This wonderfully intelligent, beautifully acted, photographed and directed film of an exciting and true chapter in history bombed at the box office for no discernible reason other than it didn't have big stars and probably wasn't hyped enough.
Made by one of America's best directors, Bob Rafelson, this story of Burton and Speke's quest for the source of the Nile is one of the last best of the great historical epics made pre-CGI and shot on location and ranks right up there with Lawrence, Zulu, etc.
The film makes plain just what a dangerous and crazy enterprise this kind of effort was with both men nearly killed on the first outing. Speke is captured and speared in arms and thighs and Burton has a spear shoved through one side of his face and out the other.  They barely manage an escape and return to England.  And yet, they go back and try again!
The second attempt is an arduous and ghastly journey as well,  with danger, death and disease plaguing every step.  The character of the two men is revealed in these travails, and the film is an exploration of the bonds of friendship and loyalty and the strains that can bind or tear them apart.
This is wonderful stuff with two daring and mad white Englishman traipsing around uncharted Africa in search of a river's source for the adventure, discovery, thrill and fame of it all.  They endure unimaginable hardship only to have a falling-out on their return to England.
Sir Richard Burton , translator of the Arabian Nights and various erotic literature, swordsman, rake, linguist was a brilliant, unorthodox and unconventional man.  He is wonderfully played by Patrick Bergin, with vitality, humor and charisma to spare.  John Hanning Speke is shown as a disciplined and courageous explorer & friend, but troubled and conflicted sexually and emotionally.  LLain Glen is wonderful as the tightly wrapped Speke, severely suppressing his (probable) homosexuality.
The supporting cast is fine, and the photography and location filming exceptional.  The complications of the relationships:  Burton and his wife, Burton and Speke, Speke & his probable lover, are limned with taste and intelligence.
Nineteenth century Africa would be a forbidding and hazardous place for native and non-native alike.  It would take exceptional men to leave behind all they knew and venture into a completely unknown and uncharted vast continent, without communications and without a supply line and completely on your own.  Lunacy if you think about it.  Well, whether historically accurate in every detail or not, this film captures the essence of this mad quest and the extraordinary men who made it!  Well worth your while.",1076716800,49,2665,5.027272727272727
365831,5,6301730038,"I first saw this movie in 1991 and instantly fell in love, wishing I could go out and dicover something as monumental as the source for the Nile River. The acting in this movie is stupendous, Patrick Bergin as ""Richard Burton"", Iain Glen as ""John Speke"", and Fiona Shaw as Burton's wife,(I forgot here name in the movie), they all deserve Oscars for their performances. This movie was highly overlooked by hollywood and that is a huge mistake by them, this movie could and should have won best picture honors. The scenery is breathtaking the way it is filmed and the history is potrayed in a fairly accurate light. This movie should be on everybody's top ten list.",1062633600,9,664,4.635593220338983
365832,1,6301730038,"Though I give it credit for fine acting and cinematography, this film is yet another example of a long list of films that disturbingly sanitize history.  Anyone who has done any critical research on this subject will quickly discover that Burton and Speke hated each other well before the expedition ever began.  What is more, Speke never married nor had children and there is evidence to suggest that he was probably homosexual.  In addition, the interpersonal relationships between the characters in the film are grossly skewed to support the filmmaker's desire to produce a film that is not rooted in historical accuracy.  Finally, Speke's death is portrayed as a suicide and any evidence that exists as to Burton having possibly murdered him is practically non-existent in the film.  Again, a sad film in my opinion for butchering history into some type of myopic re-presentation.  Booooo!",1058313600,7,893,5.124137931034483
365833,5,6301730038,"Is what  Sir Richard  Francis Burton (Patric Begin) tells his wife Isabell (Fiona Shaw ) after she rushes in to their London home exclaiming:  "" Newspapers! Mr. Speke again! ""
At which point one of the most intelligent and best written love scenes ensues---in one of the most intelligent and best written films of all time---as Isabell demands that the hitherto heroic Burton--who has given in to drink and despair, publically confront his former friend, John Speke (Ian Glen) who is damning him in the press, and  fight to vindicate his good name.
Irony of Ironies!  In the Victorian age, Burton, for all his dashing bravery was considered less 'respectable' than Speke. Burton had been the first European to enter Mecca, disguised as an Arab (he was fluent in 23 languages), a swordsman who published manuals on the use of the saber in combat, and translated The Kama Sutra and The Arabian Nights into English. He had a reputation for wildness in an age of conformity.
Speke, of the other hand, was a British officer, a member of a prominent family, and a discreet homosexual.
The irony continues. This is perhaps the best foreign film that ever bombed at the American box office. Why?
1. The heterosexual ends happily, the homosexual does not. Furthermore another homosexual, Larry (Richard Grant) plays the part of 'Iago' lying and separating the two friends into bitter rivals. Worse still, unlike, say, ""Kiss of the Spider Woman "" Speke,  does not get his sexual fantasies fulfilled. That part of his love for Burton goes unrequited.
2. Africans in the 19th century are not represented as 'Noble Savages ' living in egalitarian harmony with each other. Rousseau would have been disappointed.
3. Outside the aforementioned outburst ""How dare a white man.say he discovered Africa! Africans discovered Africa! "" There is no apology for British colonialism.  In fact, it's rather unimportant to the main focus of the film.
4. There were no STARS, that brought in an audience, only great actors.
 ( One shudders at the thought of a Hollywood remake with Tom Hanks and Tim Burton in the leads and Whoopi Goldberg delivering an impassioned speech at The Royal Geographical Society. )
This film is a glorious, true life, adventure story about the discovery of the source of the Nile.  Yes, it is an ""epic"" , wonderfully photographed. David Lean would have loved it.
 Especially since the plot is driven by the characters, not the outside world, exotic as the surroundings may be.  There is a tone of melancholia, a bittersweetness that prevails throughout. It is  a tragedy about the friendship of Speke and Burton. The first gay as a breeze, the second a raving heterosexual but both,  (without any excuses to audiences trained to expect that only 'ordinary folks' are believable ) presented for what they were:  Heroes.
Indeed if the word 'hero' did not apply to Speke and Burton, it would have no meaning. I lost track of how many time they saved each other's lives.  A brilliant, subtle and touching film.",1052179200,52,3007,4.891732283464567

365835,5,6301730038,"Mountains of the Moon is possibly the most criminally overlooked movie of all time. For all the horrid yet prize-winning films about morose Europeans falling in love with colonial Africa, this absolute diamond about the search for the source of the Nile has gone inexplicably unappreciated.
The Cinematography of this film is breathtaking (being one of the handful of people who saw it in the theaters, I should know). The filmmakers have not only captured the wonders of the African landscape, their job of depicting Victorian England is something even the folks at Merchant/Ivory must envy.
Beauty aside, Patrick Bergin and Fiona Shaw turn in two of the greatest acting performances of the Twentieth Century. I first fell in love with Shaw in this movie...not even playing Petunia Dursley has strained my affection.
Mountains of the Moon is, at its core, a meditation on the meaning of friendship. Where does friendship end and love begin? Betrayal in one (even if only a suspected betrayal) can be just as fatal as in the other.
With one final nod to Delroy Lindo in a smaller, but crucial, role before I go, I give Mountains of the Moon my absolute highest recommendation. This is one of the best movies ever. Get it today.",1029974400,126,1227,4.847619047619047

365837,4,6301730038,"I came to this film knowing almost nothing about Burton, Speke, or the search for the Nile; in fact I only picked it up because I heard Roger Rees was in it (he's great as always, by the way, but he only has a two-minute part at the end).  However, I came away entranced and fascinated by the subject, and more especially, by the characters.  Although the film is a little slow moving for ignorant types like myself, it merely requires patience for the first 20 minutes or so, before the powerful storytelling and acting overcomes any pacing problems.  Patrick Bergin creates a truly memorable character, and Fiona Shaw is wonderfully...Victorian, only not.  A character of true intelligence and humour, yet undeniably a product of her time.  My favourite though, is Iain Glen as John Hanning Speke, who did the whole tortured/ambitious/second-fiddle-and-hating-it/sexually frustrated part very convincingly.  His relationship with Burton is intense enough to unify the film as it sprawls accross two completely different continents (how civilized Africa seems next to London) and keep us caring right up to the final frames (and the belated but welcome appearance of R. Rees)!",1013299200,13,1177,5.136125654450262
365838,4,6301730038,"Sir Richard Burton was the most interesting traveler/explorer of the Victorian era. You might not come away from this film with that impression. The film focuses on just one event in Burtons event filled life and that is the films one flaw, though its a pretty big flaw its not fatal. The African part of the film is very exciting. Burton and Speke mount an expeditionary force and with a large amount of exploring goods and native carriers get raided on the beach one night(excellent battle scene)before they even begin. After regrouping they again set out to find one of the nineteenth centuries geographical prizes, the source of the Nile(mountians of the moon). Who saw it first and who could best map exactly where it was takes up the second half of the movie. That aftermath section which shows the debate of the former friends become enemies as it played out in the geographical society journals of the day is not the most riveting cinema mainly because Speke is just not that interesting a figure and so no real contest for Burton and since there is never any doubt who will win as a drama it has no teeth(what were you thinking Rafelson?).  The real drama in the Burton story is the one between his very groundbreaking and often illicit work(he translated and introduced the Kama Sutra to Victorian England) and ultra conservative Victorian England. Still any film about Burton is worthwhile. A better movie would have been exclusively about Burton and his very unusual character. He was at least as unusual as Lawrence of Arabia and perhaps even more complex. He combined great learning(languages, religions, weapons, erotica...)with a great amount of first hand experience in a number of rarely trodden lands. He was the first non Muslim visitor to the holy city of Mecca(he arrived in Arab disguise).
Bergin plays Burton as if he were just slightly unconventional which is fine for a Hollywood film but the truth is this guy was a real cultural chameleon. Perhaps one day another director will try his hand at this material. Until then this is not a great but a good introduction which may lead you to want to know more. I liked the scenes which show the interior of Burtons house especially as he was a collector of tribal artifacts, knives, spears, texts. And his wife is played by a lovely actress who plays Isabel Burton as if she were just a very liberal minded Victorian. In actuality Isabel burned many of Richards manuscripts after his death forever earning her the wrath of the Orientalist community.  You won't get accuracy or depth of vision here but you will get an eyefull of Africa which is beautifully  filmed, those grand vistas and some grand moments make the trip worth your while.",1011312000,2,2711,4.776119402985074
