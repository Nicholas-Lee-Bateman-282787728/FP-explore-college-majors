8552234,4,B00AIQARYA,"Love that this blu-ray has the original version movie & the remake. Two films on one disc for a bargain! A favorite film from my youth. Would've given it 5 stars if it included the digital downloaded version, but I don't know if older films are available as downloads. I've been ""spoiled"" by new released movies that tend to do that now! The download is convenient for on -the-go mobile phone viewing.",1462060800,,401,4.583333333333333

8552236,5,B00AIQARYA,"Look, the quality is better than expected, and I dare say it's better than I remembered when I saw it at the drive-in well over 30 yrs ago
It's a Harryhausen. You won't be disappointed.",1434153600,,185,4.314285714285714

8552239,5,B00AIQARYA,Ok so the movie is pretty lame but it made my girlfriend happy seeing it is one of her favorites. Came in quickly and in perfert condition,1408492800,,138,4.148148148148148
8552240,4,B00AIQARYA,"I don't know what all the fuss is about. This movie appeared great. It was surprisingly crisp and clear. My children (girls age 11) loved it even as much as I did. I honestly think it's even better in a lot of ways then the new version because there's more of a story line and the kids can follow the pace of the story and action easier then the modern big production versions. The only comment they made was about the appearance of Pegasus in some of the scenes appearing fake. But that's to be expected with this animation and age of technology. However, the kids still thought it was an awesome movie and I still think there's a lot to be appreciated with the creativity of the films animation.  The night scenes are somewhat uncomfortably dark but you can see fine enough what's going on, certainly not a reason to not purchase the DVD. It was great having both versions on one disk and it was also nice to watch them and talk with my children afterwards and compare and contrast the two versions. Excellent buy! By the way, witches in the old version, way better. The new are like aliens.",1405728000,2,1093,4.410891089108911
8552241,5,B00AIQARYA,I enjoyed having both versions of this movie classic in one recording disk.  The sound and the recordings are great.,1398902400,2,116,4.8
8552242,4,B00AIQARYA,"We loaned our 2010 copy of this movie to our grandkids, never to be seen again.  We were quite pleased to find it here in BluRay as well as the 1981 copy included.  (We still had our VHS copy of the old version, but no longer have a VHS player.)  We are thrilled to have our set complete again!",1398297600,2,294,3.9491525423728815
8552243,5,B00AIQARYA,"I like both version of this movie. So to get this for a good price was great. Video and sound is great on both. The new movie has better visual effects,but I like the charm and story telling better of the older version",1398124800,2,218,4.093023255813954
