A genuine classic.  Always thought it so much better than ""Gunsmoke"" or ""Bonanza.""",1395619200,2,206,5.516129032258065

5624213,5,B00498NBE6,"Update: I just received Season 2 of The Big Valley and Timeless did a great job on Season 2 and I very happy overall. Would I have liked some extras such as interviews with the original surviving cast yes of course, but at this point I am having with a good picture and decent sound, and a great price. I really hope they release the rest of seasons of this great show, and then I will be super happy. Bob

I agree, I hope they release the entire series on DVD, and don't do the same thing Fox did and stop in the middle of season 2. I really hope they are able to get a hold of the master negatives to create a great print of a fantastic show which deserves to be released. I really wish they would follow the same example set by Bonanza and release not only a great looking DVD's but also fantastic extra's, but I am dreaming. At this point I just want the entire series released so I can enjoy it with my family.

Thanks Shout/Timeless for releasing this great show and please do a good job for all of the Big Valley fans out there.",1394928000,3,1035,4.093596059113301
5624214,3,B00498NBE6,"The product picture shows five single sided discs. Can someone that has purchased this set tell me if the discs are single sided as pictured please?
Was the first season double sided? I'm just guessing at the rating this should get.",1392249600,2,232,4.682926829268292
5624215,5,B00498NBE6,As far as I'm concerned The Big Valley is the best western show ever made. The cast was easily the best ensemble ever. Richard Long. Peter Breck and my favorite guy Lee Majors were fantastic. Add movie legend Barbara Stanwyck and future star Linda Evans and you can't go wrong. This show is still extremely popular today drawing in even very young viewers who can't seem to find anything worthwhile on TV today. I can't wait to receive this DVD and hope season 3 and 4 will also be released,1390953600,19,490,4.455555555555556
5624216,4,B00498NBE6,"The ""stalled"" released mentioned by Freethinker above, means more than one thing.  I started collecting this series and was immensely disappointed when they stopped releasing the show several years ago in the middle of season two, with no complete season two set ever offered.  Now that they've resumed, I see no volume 2 for season two, and I certainly nave no intentions of paying for half a season all over again.  Although I welcome the continuation of the DVD releases and have always hated split-season volumes, it would be downright dirty to forget about the customers that were purchasing the earlier sets, and not continuing where they previously left off.  The real hope, however, should be that this time they will at least complete the series.",1390867200,5,755,4.968253968253968
5624217,4,B00498NBE6,"Nice job from TMG rescuing another 'stalled' show that looked as if it would never be released. Season Two not as good as the first but still a solid oater with some standout episodes.  Hope the cover art is the pic with the five principals on the steps; the other shot has youngest son Eugene who appeared in a few episodes during the first season only (actor Charles Bryles was drafted & sent to Vietnam).  This could be a bit confusing to newcomers who would be wondering who ""that other guy"" is on the cover.  Also, hope TMG has obtained decent masters; the first season release had soft video (like good VHS), but that may have been due to cramming 30 episodes on double-sided discs.  Remember, this review is for the show, not the DVD set since it hasn't been released yet...still, TMG usually does a nice job with video/audio.",1390780800,3,833,4.533333333333333
5624218,5,B00498NBE6,"Few western television shows have ever found a place in the hearts of millions of viewers than ""The Big Valley"".With an exceptional cast headed by Barbra Stanwyck (an Emmy winner in the show's first season as Best Actress in a Drama Series) and including new faces Lee Majors and Linda Evans, ""The Big Valley"" is known for its crisp production values, sharp writing and as being the first prime time show to have a female lead act as a strong and domineering force to be reckoned with.

 Now, finally Season 2 of ""The Big Valley"" comes to DVD in its entirety with all 30 episodes uncut and cleaned from their original prints.

 Though the show was never a ratings winner in its original ABC run (the show never cracked the Top 30 shows), it would grow on to become one of the biggest westerns to enter worldwide syndication and to make Lee Majors and Linda Evans stars.",1390435200,22,869,4.515923566878981
5624219,5,B00498NBE6,"A real Gem with a great cast, it lasted Four years and the Barkleys are one of the finest tv show westerns ever filmed. In beautiful color with gorgeous sets. Barbara Stanwick as the widow and head of the Barkley can. She was  a fine actress and filmed many dramatically sound episodes. Lee Majors as the ever handsome Heath Barkley and bastard son who fought to receive his birthright. LInda Evans was just gorgeous as the only Barkley Daughter Audra  who was overprotected by her other three  brothers. Richard Long as Jarrod the family lawyer, hot head brother with charm Nick Barkley excellently portrayed by Peter Breck. And Eugene Barkley the youngest brother who went too college played by Charles Briles seen early in season one was dropped from the show and never mentioned again after season two. So many wonderful guest stars like William Shatner, Richard Anderson, Nemiah Persoff,Robert Walker and Carol Lynley too name a few. Now I just wonder if this is the complete season two or Season Two volume two since Season two Volume 1 with the first 15 episodes of the season was released some time ago. I never thought they would finally release the rest of the episodes since in in syndication they are heavily edited. I can't wait till season 3 and four are out and I have the entire series",1389744000,50,1301,4.697368421052632

5624264,4,B00498NBE6,"The first Western ever to feature the word ""bastard"" spoken aloud continues, in its second season, to address subjects of import, most notably prejudice (against Basques in one episode and gypsies in another) and political chicanery. Along with the dynamics of the closely-knit Barkley family itself--matriarch Victoria (Barbara Stanwyck), a no-nonsense and very modern lady who doesn't balk at addressing problems directly even if it means a lone foray into a burning desert; eldest son Jarrod (Richard Long), an attorney unafraid to use his fists, or a gun, if he has to; tough Nick (Peter Breck) and half-sib Heath (Lee Majors); and buxom, husky-voiced daughter Audra (Linda Evans)--there are numerous notable guests, including James Gregory as a hard-drinking desert guide, Colleen Dewhurst excellently portraying an outlaw mother who butts heads with Victoria, Buddy Hackett (with an improbable Irish brogue) as a con artist who claims that he and not Tom Barkley fathered Heath, Nehemiah Persoff as a Mexican patriot general forced into flight by the Diaz regime, Dan OHerlihy as an old beau of Victorias now turned hired gun, and James Whitmore, Sr., who portrayed Handy Random in the first season, as a gubernatorial candidate as slimy as anything you might see in more recent elections.  The Barkley brothers make common cause with a Greek orchardist determined to avoid the arbitrarily high shipping prices imposed for his peaches by the local railroad freight agent; the family becomes involved with a 16-year-old boy (played by a very young Richard Dreyfus, but that nose is unmistakable!) who seems resolved to take on full responsibility for his younger brother and sister after the mysterious disappearance of their widowed mother; Victoria discovers just how far an old family friend is willing to go to protect his only son after she sees the young man commit murder; and Nick learns a shocking truth about his commanding officer from the Civil War.  Heath has developed as a character; hes settled into the family and realizes that they love him and he loves themthat hes home.  Most of the episodes are serious, and one (in which Jarrod, away from home, is injured and rendered amnesiac) is somewhat trite, but at least one is a comic hoot, with Victoria and Audra taken hostage by an inept trio of hillbillies (led by Warren Oates and Christopher Cary) resolved to break into a rail-depot safe come hell or high water.",1435017600,,2438,5.09

Watching it now, i think that it inspired the adult soap operas that were popular in the early eighties. In many ways,THE BIG VALLEY ressembles DALLAS,DYNASTY or FALCON CREST.The scripts are pushy and often verges on camp. I know that some will disagree but it's my opinion. The cast however makes the most of the stories and LINDA EVANS looks like CATHERINE DENEUVE which is of course easy on the eyes.

5624308,5,B00498NBE6,"This was my favorite Western TV show going up.  I never saw the show in prime time, but watched it every day after school when it was in syndication.  I loved watching the show.  Nick Barkley was my favorite character from the show, always loved that big black hat and vest he wore in the show.  It just upsets me so, to know that most of the cast has died off, starting with Richard Long, then Barbara Stanwyck and most recently Peter Breck.  As was with another favorite show, Hawaii Five-O, all of the original cast members that I knew and loved as a kid are dying off and wish they were around now.  It was shocking to watch Season 2 now and see young actors who were just starting out like a 16 year old Richard Dreyfuss and a very young Eve Plumb prior to the Brady Bunch!  I can't wait to view Seasons 3 & 4.",1412899200,,815,4.120253164556962

5624316,5,B00498NBE6,"I have greatly enjoyed this DVD set! This set is the restored color and sound. Some episodes do have some grain, so if you have a large screen TV, it might remind you of watching TV of old BUT it is well worth it! I will definately be purchasing the remaining 2 years! The only thing that bugs me about this edition is that when Fox restored the episodes for viewing on TV (I saw them restored on the Westerns Channel), they changed the all the opening credits to the original early 1965 opening credits with the oval pictures of the stars over a background of the house. On the original show, the opening credits were changed after a few episodes in the first season 1965-66 to the same photos of the characters without the house behind; then in 1966-67, the second season, the intro started with a rushing river and different images of the actors.  These episodes are the ones Fox restored for the Westerns Channel, in my opinion, because they all have the same opening credits from the original 1965 pilot episode. I personally miss the original credits, but I also remember the poor quality of the shows without the restored color and sound that I watched, so I really can't complain!",1410048000,,1188,4.5514018691588785

It is better than DVD's that I got from CHINA; they were crap.  They were copied off of a channel that was showing Hallmark and Bonanza; they would break up and you couldn't correct them.  The bottom line is they were not worth what I had to pay for them.

5624345,5,B00498NBE6,"After literally YEARS of waiting for the cheapskates at FOX, we finally got the entire season 2 from Shout Factory/Timeless Media.  This has all the season 2 episodes (the fox season 2 release only had the first half of season 2).  That's also why this one has the lower price tag then the soon to be released season 3.

Big Valley is a great show. This season has some great episodes with the family, as usual, fighting for their high moral standards.  Even though it's 50 years old and can be hokey and indirectly sexist and racist in a way that things from the sixties are, the underlying messages of supporting your family and always trying to do the right thing still ring true.

The DVD set is okay.  Each DVD has the title of the episodes on the DVD, but there are no descriptions anywhere.  I had to find an episode guide online to know what each episode was.  (In other words, for the next season, an episode summary would be nice to be included.)

5624351,5,B00498NBE6,"This sums up my understanding of what is at the heart of these excellent stories of the Barclay Family.  I thought the First Season was outstanding in its portrayal of The Barclay Family on a ranch carved out from scratch in  Post Civil War Central Valley, California.  Families are never perfect but this family always managed to come together and resolve its differences with one another, while fighting for, and defending what is morally right in the rough and tumble world of the Old West.  Each of the main characters that made up the Barclay, instinctively was willing to take great risks to do so, no matter what adversaries they faced.  Each personality is unique, each has their own strengths and yes, even weaknesses, but always as individuals and as a family, overcame the weaknesses with the strengths and values with which they were raised.  All were great tributes to the Matriarch, Victoria Barclay,  who raised her four children with the same morals and values that guided her own actions.  The love and loyalty in the Barclay family, three sons and one daughter, is one of the most outstanding qualities of each episode.  The second season surpasses the first, if that is possible.  The stories are never predictable. Sometimes they surprised me with where they were going and their outcome.  Some are truly outstanding writing.  For example, ""Court Martial"", the story of a retired Civil War General who comes to the Barclay Ranch to buy horses for the Calvary.  He is not who he claims to be, and those who track him down to hold him accountable for Civil War crimes, finally get the truth out of him.  Only Gerard knew the purpose of their mission, but the family was subjected to being hostages until the mission was completed and justice served.  I was completely surprised and stunned by the outcome.  All  the stories have a moral base.  The code of the Old West, rough as it was, is always upheld. Right always wins over wrongs, and wrongs even in those who commit them, are often lessons for their perpetrators to learn from them, the hard way, and change their lives. Justice always is served one way or another.  Though wealth had been built up over the years of hard work, each family member continues to pull their own weight and tend to their responsibilities of which there are many not only on the ranch, but in the diversified industries they have built over the years..  Barbara Stanwick is outstanding as Victoria Barclay, and each actor equally outstanding  portraying Gerard, Nick, Heath and Audra, the youngest, and the only daughter.  They are the kind of neighbors I would dearly love to have and indeed, feel very much as if they were.  I've felt as if I knew them and am part of them and their lives almost from the beginning, and now, after nearing the end of the second season, most definitely do.  The Big Valley is similar in many ways to my other Old West series, Bonanza.  The Cartwrights and the Barclays would get along very well.",1400284800,2,2981,4.7084942084942085

The quality looks as if it was transferred from a VHS tape, but is good none the less. The reason for this is that it was manufactured by a different company other than Fox Pictures, it was put out by ""Timeless"" who's heart may be in the right place, but they are the same people who brought us the Dollar Tree specials for a buck. Still, I'm grateful that someone is producing it. I am glad to see that Season 3 is on it's way hopefully fallowed by the last season.

5624361,5,B00498NBE6,"The quality of these discs is excellent.  I hope that subsequent sets will also be at this reasonable price,

unless they contain special features, particularly the Barbara Stanwyck documentary ""Portrait"" that was

filmed on the ""Big Valley"" set.

""The Big Valley""s second season is even better than the first.  The actors had settled nicely into their roles,

and Stanwyck had jettisoned the wig which she hated because it had limited the stunt work that she so enjoyed.

In fact, the comic episode ""The Great Safe Robbery"" (co-starring the marvelous Warren Oates) contains the most

intricate stunt she ever accomplished.  In it, she makes a flying leap to successfully catch, in mid-air, a box of

blasting caps, (one wonders how many takes it took to do that).

Warren Oates is just one of the outstanding guest stars, who don't merely appear, but who shine brilliantly.

Most memorable is the great Colleen Dewhurst (""A Day of Terror"").  Other standouts include Lee Grant,

Diane Ladd, Richard Dreyfuss, Karen Black, Ellen Burstyn (then Ellen McRae), Pernell Roberts, Robert Goulet,

James Whitmore, Buddy Hackett,  Cloris Leachman,  Bradford Dillman, Joseph Campanella, and Dennis Hopper.

Also memorable: James Gregory making his first appearance opposite Stanwyck as tracker Simon Carter

in :""Target"", one of the series' best episodes.  In the third season, Carter returned in ""Ambush"", another great battle

of wills with Victoria Barkley.

With the exception of Linda Evans (who would later reach her full potential in ""Dynasty""), Stanwyck's co-stars,

Richard Long. Peter Breck and Lee Majors, would never give better performances than they did in this series.

So it is especially welcome that their fine work on ""The Big Valley"" will at last be seen in its entirety, since it appears

that all four seasons will soon be available.",1398643200,2,1844,5.21160409556314

5624364,4,B00498NBE6,"I too have been waiting a long time for this series to be completely released, but am I the only one to notice that the opening credits are wrong?  Each season originally had it's own unique opening credits, but recently in syndication on TV, I have noticed that Season 2 was using the same opening as Season 1, and Season 4 is shown with Season 3's opening. I had hoped this was not going to be the case on the dvd release, but was disappointed upon receiving it.  I contacted Shout, and was told that the opening was pulled directly from the Masters provided, and an attempt was made to locate the proper opening, with no luck.  How is this possible? Each episode begins with a scene, followed by the opening credits embedded within, so how or why would it change?  Makes me wonder if these are syndicated versions and not the full episode.  I mentioned to Shout that Season 4 will have the same issue, and hope they can locate the proper opening, which is my favorite.  The season 2 opening credits can be viewed on YouTube, but season 4 is harder to find. The versions I taped from the family channel years ago are correct, but the ones currently showing on INSP are incorrect. I just wish all these shows can be released in tact as I remember.  I hope and welcome others to also reach out to Shout about this issue, so that it gets corrected.",1398211200,5,1347,4.385542168674699

Picture quality and audio are both well mastered...it is also exciting to see that Season Three is slated for release on July 8th...I am confident that Season Four will be forth coming as well.  We Big Valley fans owe much appreciation to this company for not letting us down.
Addendum:  I feel compelled to respond to the one-star review given by ""frisco kid""...the comments about the quality of this release are just ridiculous and completely unfounded.  I am playing the DVD's on a Sony 50-inch television and they look GREAT.  If you love the Big Valley like I do,  just ignore those mis-guided comments and BUY SEASON TWO...and Season THREE and FOUR when this fine company releases them!! (I also have the Season Two Volume One released by 20th Century Fox in January 2007, and this Complete Season Two release looks every bit as good!)...Perhaps ""frisco kid"" is just too particular, but it is that kind of negative criticism that caused 20th Century Fox to pull the plug in 2007, and I really do not want to see that happen again, especially when Season Three and Season Four are on the horizon...",1397347200,55,1320,4.71304347826087

Black Saddle starred a pre-Big Valley Peter Breck and a pre-Gilligan's Island Russell Johnson, as a lawyer and marshal who fought crime together. Burke's Law featured Bat Masterson star Gene Barry as a millionaire Los Angeles police detective/spy, and ran for a total of 5 seasons: 3 on abc in the mid '60's, and 2 on CBS in the mid '90's (DVD production stalled after season one was released on DVD in two volumes). The Rogues, was about an international family of royalty who were also grifters, and starred David Niven, Gig Young, and Charles Boyer. MeTV presently shows edited versions of some of these series, but it would be great to have full releases of all on DVD.",1396915200,3,1014,4.576923076923077
