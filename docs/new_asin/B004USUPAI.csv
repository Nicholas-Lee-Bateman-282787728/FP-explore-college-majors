4470685,4,B004USUPAI,"""Your more likely to die from a bee sting then get killed be a shark.""  After the boat that they are on gets damaged and is unable to move, five friends must decide to wait it out on the boat or swim to an island.  When the decision is made they soon begin to regret thier choice.  First of all I will say that I did enjoy the movie.  I have not yet seen the movie ""Open Water"", but after watching this I feel like I have.  This movie is repetitve but keeps you watching.  People swim, they see a shark...over and over.  Like ""Open Water"" this is a true story, which helps in the enjoyment of this. There really isn't much more to say about this movie, not too much to it, but it is entertaining.  Overall, I liked it, but if you have seen ""Open Water"" this may be too much of the same thing to fully enjoy it. I give it a B.

Would I watch again? - I don't think I will.

*Also try - Frozen & Open Water",1310947200,2,904,3.890710382513661
4470686,5,B004USUPAI,"""The Reef"" is only loosely based on the overturning of a fishing trawler in rough seas off the North Queensland coast in 1983. The three survivors were attacked by one or more Tiger sharks, and only the captain was able to swim to a reef where he was rescued by searchers.

""The Reef"" tells the story of four friends who are forced to abandon their overturned small yacht off the coast of North Queensland when the boat's keel is torn off by impact with rock or coral. There is little time for character development in the short time that elapses before tragedy strikes the travellers.

Fearing that the boat will be carried further out to sea by the current or sink, the four decide to swim to Turtle Island which is believed to be about ten miles away. On their long swim they are constantly stalked by one of the most fearsome predators in the sea - a Great White shark. The impact of the story is greatly enhanced by the refusal of the film makers to fall back on unrealistic CGI sharks. As they are repeatedly attacked by the Great White, the actors appear to be actually in the sea with a real shark. The cinematography, both above and below water, deserves the highest marks. Without giving the story away, it can be said that the film has some truly frightening moments, and the sense of unrelenting menace creates almost unbearable tension and raises this film well above ""Open Water"" on a scare factor rating.

The product of 15 million years of evolution, the Great White is probably the most intelligent shark in the sea, and noted for its ability to lift its head out of the water to appraise its prey or those who are hunting it, as was seen in ""Jaws"". Attack images of the outthrust jaws of Great White sharks are truly nightmarish and the film makers have not erred in placing this monster close to Turtle Island which is located at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef. The Great White has been known to range much further north along the Great Barrier Reef.",1310428800,65,1981,4.497222222222222
4470687,5,B004USUPAI,THIS IS THE BEST SHARK MOVIE SINCE JAWS THE WAY THE DIRECTOR USES FOOTAGE OF THE GREAT WHITE SHARK IS FANTASTIC VERY REALISTIC NOT LIKE ALOT OF THE CGI THAT IS USED IN MOVIES THESE DAYS  THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR ANYONE INTO THESE KIND OF MOVIES YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED ALSO DONT COMPARE THIS TO OPEN WATER AS THIS IS WAY BETTER AND IS ALOT MORE EXCITING .....

4470689,1,B004USUPAI,Absolutely worst movie Ive ever seen in my life. Id give it 0 stars if possible. The acting was horrible. The plot was predictable and atrocious. The female characters were so obnoxiously damsel in distress it was sickening. I will never get that 1hour 27 minutes back of my life. Id rather get that time back then a refund. The most annoying female character is the only one to survive in the end...really? She shouldve pulled him up out of the water. She didn't try hard enough.,1524787200,,480,4.528735632183908

Other 4 ppl decide to swim to an island. They swim very slowly. One guy attacked. While he bleeds out and dies, women cry for quite awhile. Remaining man keeps just using his goggles to try to. See the shark. I think they should have been moving their butts!  And it continues in this thread. When they finally see land, STILL swimming slowly and complaining about how sore they are. If you saw land, wouldn't you swim as fast as you could to get to it?!!!!! Adrenaline would make you. You wouldn't even feel your soreness. Plus, they make the shark ""stalk""them. Not reality. I liked 47 Meters Down a lot better. This movie really was bad and BORING.",1521158400,,801,4.412162162162162

4470714,5,B004USUPAI,"I've watched this movie about 5 times. This is a good film, seriously. There are no 2 headed sharks, no sharknados, no surfer girls out swimming a great white shark. None of that ridiculousness. This is basic, this is real (as in how it would really be), this is being on the open ocean, helpless, with nothing but black water around you as far as you can see and whatever lives in it. It is also based on true events. How much better could it be.

You can't compare this movie to Jaws as most people always seem to do with any shark movie. Jaws is a classic. Jaws is more about people and the story, and the shark being a vessel to tell that story. That being said, Jaws spawned my fear of the water as it did with a lot of people. This movie helps enforce that fear. If you are looking for blood and guts and drama between teenagers and silly dialogue, keep looking, this movie is not for you. If you have a phobia of the ocean and it's inhabitants, then welcome home, and enjoy.",1509753600,,981,4.190476190476191

4470718,4,B004USUPAI,"I like the subtlety. There are no real villains here. No incredibly stupid people, or motives, or truly stupid decisions. Just a few normal people stuck in a terrible, very possible, no-win situation, facing something dangerous that they can't control. The shark isn't a movie monster. It doesn't do weird things that a normal shark wouldn't do. No CG monster or unrealistic effects. Just plain, simple, and realistic. I think some scenes stretch out to give you a different kind of scary, both what it would be like to truly be stranded in the ocean for a long period of time with little hope of survival, and all the while not knowing for sure if there's a shark with you or not. That's what makes it tense and scary to me. It's the potential for situations like this that make me wary of going into the ocean.",1509321600,3,812,4.530612244897959

4470737,5,B004USUPAI,"""Jaws"" will always be the king of the shark movies but ""The Reef"" is in my opinion a lot scarier than ""Jaws"". Maybe it's the fact that the majority of the film has the characters swimming in open waters away from any land or boat being terrorized by a Great White Shark. The shark is not some CGI cartoon or anamatronic puppet either...it's real. This is one brilliant Australian film that is severely overlooked...and that's pretty sad because this is a million times better than the over hyped ""Open Water"" movie.",1500854400,,515,4.670329670329671

The Reef is the closest any shark film has come - maybe because it drew from actual events, or maybe because the director is an Aussie star with several great creature-features to his name (you should see Black Water if you like crocodile movies). Either way, it works.",1499904000,5,483,4.551724137931035
4470741,5,B004USUPAI,This is one of my favorite shark movies. The best part is they use real sharks. No fake robot or computer animated sharks here. Just real Great Whites! It's terrifying to think about being stranded in the open ocean.,1499817600,4,216,4.564102564102564

I'm not really a shark movie kind of girl (more of a paranormal horror person myself), but I watched this at my boyfriend's place to kill time once and it had me on the edge on my seat. It was seriously gripping. This is a solid shark movie/ survival film and they really made the most of their limited budget. Love the use of real sharks rather than opting for bad CGI that completely takes the credibility out of the story. I wan't to go back and watch it again, but I'm debating whether or not now would be the right time since I'm going to the beach at the end of the month...",1498953600,,639,4.161290322580645
4470743,4,B004USUPAI,"A very well done, suspenseful film. Good acting, and a very realistic story. The shark scenes are real (for the most part), and the sense of being alone and absolutely helpless on a vast ocean is well developed. The terror of encountering huge sharks who impassively view you as a meal revives a primal fear in humans, and this movie very successfully captures that fear.",1498608000,,371,4.723076923076923

4470746,4,B004USUPAI,"Surprisingly good. I actually enjoyed this more then the Shallows. I was worried for a bit that this would be a cheap completely unrealistic killer shark film. The story actually seems believable and has some pretty suspenseful moments. My other concern was this might be similar to Open Water, Fortunately the only similarity is that both films are shot in the open ocean. The camera is not ridiculously shaky and it wasn't filmed in 4-5ft seas so you don't need Dramamine to watch it. My favorite part is the main character. Yea they actually managed to use a real life Great White for a fair amount of the film, obviously not all the bits but you do have to look closely to see when real becomes CGI.

Then to be surrounded in the water with a creature that is acting purely on a predatory instinct. Something below the water that you can't see and you know can swim faster than you. There is no way to protect yourself, and you watch your friends and family die around you. Dying by being eaten alive is one of the scariest things imaginable.",1472428800,,491,4.290322580645161

4470814,4,B004USUPAI,"This is a good movie. I do have to wonder about wealthy people with a yacht sailing on the ocean. Why did they not have cell phones and a working two-way radio on board? After your motor failed, a reasonable modern sailor would have called in a distress, given their position, and what they were going to do next.
At any rate, a good true story. I would have figured out some kind of weapon to use against the shark. Why not a rock on the bottom of the shallow water when they were swimming in it? Something, anything to fight of the attacker.
Obviously, the woman survived to tell the story. How is she doing now? Is there a book?

4470824,4,B004USUPAI,Had to give this a 4 star for the suspense and edge of your seat value.  The water is beautiful and so is the boat.  Acting is good and for the most part believable.  The women did way too much screaming and thrashing about.  Not a good idea if a shark is close by.  This is not jaws movie.

4470829,5,B004USUPAI,"I've seen this movie a number of times and I love it. I find Hollywood movies can be cliche'd with the whole group arguments at times of travesty and then they tend to mumble or shout for the rest of the movie. World cinema is like a breath of fresh air and this Australian movie is no exception. The story moves along at a steady pace with plenty of fantastic sea and landscape shots. The actors are legible and believable and their characters get on with the job of survival instead of arguing and shouting. It's supposed to be based on true events but it's completely different from the actual tragic events that occurred. Having said that, it makes the film more acceptable to the wider audience and as said on the intro - I love it, so I bought it.",1465257600,2,753,4.347517730496454

4470865,5,B004USUPAI,"Something that is missing in a lot of reviews is the fact that this movie is based on actual, and terrifying true story of Ray Boundy, lone survivor of the New Venture fishing boat sinking near Townsville in Australia back in 1983. As they were swimming towards shore the 3 survivors were stalked by a vicious Tiger Shark, and two of them, Linda Ann Horton and Dennis Murphy were eaten by the beast. Reading the true-life story is gripping and beyond scary. And although a lot of people say ""it's like Open Water"", they could not be more mistaken. Yes, both movies are about people abandoned at sea, fighting hungry animals and the elements, but  at the same time they are very different. One, Open Water, is about 2 scuba divers that (Because of a terrible mistake) are left alone to fight sharks in the middle of the ocean while waiting for the rescue team to arrive, and the other one, The Reef, is about 5 people whose boat capsizes in the Australian reef barrier and 4 of them decide to swim back to land while hunted by a monstrous shark. A terrifying scenario for sure. So, having said that, grab some popcorn, sit back and sink your teeth into this one. Pun intended.",1438905600,5,1175,4.490654205607477

4470891,5,B004USUPAI,"Loved this movie! Normally, when I watch shark attack movies, they are usually full of teenagers who are picked off by the sharks as punishment for the teenagers committing some type of anti-establishment behaviour - underage drinking, sex, drug use etc. This movie was quite different. The 4 main characters who are forced to swim 12 miles in shark infested waters to reach land are all good people. They are terrified of sharks and once they realize they are being stalked by a shark, their fear is tangible. What follows is a suspenseful movie that keeps the viewer tensed up wondering who will be attacked first or next...What blows me away is how when one of their own is attacked, they swim through circles of blood, not knowing where the shark is, in a futile attempt to save the swimmer. That is human nature at its finest and why I wanted all of them to survive.",1419552000,2,871,4.589743589743589

4470897,4,B004USUPAI,"Okay, so the DVD cover with that ominous dark triangular fin tells you this is a ""SHARK"" movie, ...and straight away you know that the survival rate is not going to be high.
It's no spoiler to say that people are going to get eaten, and it's really just a matter of placing your bets on who goes first and then next etc. etc. until we get to a final survivor/s....if any at all!

This Australian movie cashes in on the popular munchy-munchy watery genre, and surprisingly manages to build up suspense rather than horror, ...although being chomped to bits while WAY out of your comfort zone is certainly horrible enough.

It starts off with the quite common exposition,just the usual stuff....four friends hire a yacht from a grizzly Captain etc. There's suggestions of some prior romantic involvements that may have ended acrimoniously, and then we get the tourist bits with romantic interludes on a deserted island. This takes about twenty minutes and is pretty inconsequential and predictable stuff, and you'll be wondering just when the finny feller with the chainsaw teeth is going to show up.

There's some motor problems with the yacht, and during the trip back from the island the rubber dinghy is conveniently very seriously damaged on some sharp coral, thereby removing any escape method should something happen to the yacht.
(Note the bad continuity problem, as although we do see it semi-deflated at first, only moments later you can see the same dinghy floating quite undamaged while being towed behind the yacht as they move off under sail.)
Suddenly, ....you always knew there'd be a ""suddenly"".....they manage to run the yacht over a shallow coral reef and the keel is ripped completely off. The boat immediately turns turtle but remains afloat upside down.

The four friends all manage to escape after a few tense moments as does the owner/captain.
They are left sitting on the upturned hull with almost no survival gear at all, and an old EPERB that apparently last saw service on board the S.S. Ark!

The alpha-male leader of the group tells everyone that the swift current is carrying the wrecked boat further out to the open ocean, and it may even sink. He suggests they must leave the comparative safety of the hull and swim(!)the twelve or so MILES back to the island.
Now if that current is so strong that it's carrying the large boat away, how the hell they are ever going to manage to make headway against that same flow is never explained. They are mostly poor swimmers too!
Just how they are even going to navigate to a tiny invisible spot in a VERY big sea is also problematical, ....specially at night?

In any case the Captain flatly refuses to enter the water at all. He knows exactly what lurks down there due to his prior fishing experiences!
He's sticking with the hull and pinning his hopes on that ancient EPERB he bought cheap second hand from Mr Noah's garage sale on Ararat.

After some dithering when one of the friends also refuses to swim for it, the other three set off, but they only get a few metres when the girl who would not go at first, undergoes a sudden sea-change of heart and also joins them IN THE WATER!
Cue deep ominous music.........and we all know just what THAT means!

Now people who know anything about Australia's famous Carcharodon carcharias will also know that they are NOT all that fond of the warmer water found on The Great Barrier Reef, preferring to remain further down south where the currents are much colder...even if the scenery much bleaker.
However, tropical reefs are far more enjoyable places for film crews to luxuriate under the palm trees, rather than some freezing cold slippery rocks covered in fur seals, so they obviously decided to make the movie up north.
This necessitates a bit of non-scientific dialogue explaining just how ""Jaws"" is also enjoying a summer holiday and has taken up residence much further up the coast than they have ever been reported.
Why not use a Tiger Shark? Perhaps it just doesn't have the same resonance as a Great White?

Anyway, off they swim...well more of a VERY SLOW dog-paddle really, ...with many long stops where they seem to make no progress at all.
Remember that strong current that was mentioned? Why are they are not all washed way out into the Pacific now?

From here on in it's your usual shark paint-by-number format folks....NOT that it hasn't been that already!
There's the mistaken sightings, the fearful false alarms, then the REALLY big teeth DO show up and the panic-party is fully ON!
Who will survive?
Will any of them ever reach safety?

Thankfully there are NO clunky mechanical sharks as in the original ""Jaws"" where ""Bruce"" was more laughable than shark-like.
Nor are there any overly slick CGI sharks either as in the execrable ""Bait"".
What you do see here is a genuine female white pointer filmed doing exactly what she does best. Eye-off and size up potential LUNCH!
It's when she makes her choices from the tempting (and helpless) menu on offer that the fear-factor swings into over-drive!

The shark footage is very cleverly interwoven to make it appear that the four (and rapidly dwindling) swimmers are indeed in the same water as that Mrs Big-Bitey-Thing.
This is extremely well done!

Although you do get to see suggestions of some horrific maulings, this movie goes more for the suspense created by the vulnerability and the constant expectations of further massive attacks from below.
When seen from a shark-eyed view, people DO look incredibly vulnerable waiving their spindly white legs wildly about in the clear water, above those dark ominous abysses that could hide anything.
You will feel this tension too I assure you, and despite there being one particular girl you just want to slap, the characters are likeable enough to elicit our sympathy and we do care about their fate.
Unlike those in ""Bait"" where I honestly wanted them ALL to die! (And quickly! I was definitely cheering for the sharks in that movie!)

This is obviously shot on a fairly low budget, and the movie has little for the actors to do other than sustain full-on expressions of terror for most of the running time. Strangely enough their skin never seems to go all wrinkly as would be expected after such long immersion.

If shark movies are your thing, this is actually better than most of the risible trash that has been produced in this genre...(""Sharknado???), and there's very little story at all, so the most part of the movie is the long swim with the ever lurking Madame Monster,....and believe me, she's MOST determined to lunch today!

DEFINITELY not for viewing if you are about to embark on a snorkelling holiday, or if you are a bit faint of heart, but surprisingly enjoyable none the less.
Just expect it to be simple.
But then you can't get any more OTT than the constant fear of an appalling death coming at you at any moment with no means of protection at all.

It all ends with one of those quick text on black screen tellings of what happened in the end, but by then you too will have probably cancelled your next boating trip.",1409529600,3,7075,4.7436940602115545

4470902,4,B004USUPAI,"I was hesitant to watch The Reef after having been disappointed by Open Water, but I was pleasantly surprised instead.  The Reef is  not a bad movie to watch.  It is an excellent exercise in pure, primal fear and a desperate fight for survival, as a group of five carefree friends set out on the ocean for a sailing adventure, only to have their boat capsize.  Their only real option is to swim through shark-infested waters to the nearest land mass for safety.  It quickly becomes a question of who will it out alive when they are stalked and repeatedly attacked by Great White sharks.  What blew me away about this film was that real great whites were used, and not phony CGI sharks.  Seeing real teeth coming at you in the water is far more terrifying than technology.  The whole film is a good watch and excellent reminder that while the ocean can be a beautiful place, it can also be your absolute worst nightmare.",1400112000,9,919,4.493975903614458

4470905,3,B004USUPAI,"The Reef, like ""Open Water"" before it, is about a group of divers (shipwrecked swimmers in this instance) who get picked off one-by-one by a man eating Great White. This Great White is especially hungry as he is hunting for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and probably a midnight snack.

This movie is loosely based on true events. In 1983, Ray Boundy was the sole survivor of a shipwreck off the coast of Queensland after his other 2 crew mates were eaten alive by a Tiger Shark. Apply the same setting (Queensland), add 2 more crew members, switch out the Tiger Shark for a Great White, and you have The Reef. The director filmed a similar Crocodile attack movie prior to this shark tale, so he likes the killer animal motif.

Is The Reef like Jaws? No way. Deep Blue Sea? Nope. This is a straight-up low-budget cult flick. The actors are decent, not remarkable. The scenes that include the shark up close are done pretty well. The story is minimal. It's better than Open Water, but don't expect much more.

I fast forwarded it a bit though because it was so mindlessly dull and I wanted something to happen. Finally a boat tipped over. Some people decided to swim. They find a turtle shell. Then some get eaten by a shark. That's the whole movie. Just scenes of water under, on top, the moon, people swimming. It was like watching a documentary. The ending was horrible. It wasn't a real ending. They just stopped the movie and did text on the screen to tell you show it ends.

I started laughing hysterically after this  movie was over because it just numbed my mind so much. It was ALMOST suspenseful at parts, but the suspense ending up just being frustration. It took forever for them to swim to land after they saw it. He swam faster to the floaty thing than he swam to the land. It felt like days passed and it wasn't that far away.

This movie is good if you want to watch a documentary about people floating in the water. But if you want a scary shark movie this is not it. I rented it because of the reviews. NO IDEA why it has good reviews. If you are scared or excited by this then it does not take much to scare or excite you. I should also mention a good portion of the movie is filled with close ups of a guys face as he looks under water for a shark. Just over and over. Close up of his face to look for the shark. Then he doesn't really do anything about it. Just looks at it. And either says ""I don't see it"" or ""I see it"" like that really helps.",1375574400,,1617,4.06269592476489

4470923,4,B004USUPAI,"A snorkeling trip through the Great Barrier Reef turns deadly for a small group of friends when their boat strikes bottom and capsizes in the shark infested waters. BLACK WATER director Andrew Traucki returns with another survival horror film entitled THE REEF, which is Australia's answer to OPEN WATER. Although it is very similar in structure, THE REEF fails to generate the same impact that OPEN WATER had on audiences in 2003 despite the inclusion of a menacing Great White that threatens the divers. Its greatest downfall is that Traucki's characters do nothing to draw the audience in to their perilous plight, and the larger cast sets the film up to be a body count picture (which Traucki does deliver). Like in BLACK WATER, however, THE REEF provides many more shocks and surprises that will have viewers jumping out of their seats! Traucki uses the same expert composites to place the shark right next to his actors for a number of jarring attacks. The use of real footage taken from right alongside all of the action gives the film a heightened sense of authenticity as well. With stronger central characters, THE REEF could have been a much more powerful film, but it is still sure to appeal to fans that were disappointed in OPEN WATER's overall inaction.

4470928,4,B004USUPAI,"Okay, I feel like a heel for criticizing the sort of movie I've been waiting for for years. A normal-sized, real great white shark! Just as the many smaller REAL sharks in the film OPEN WATER were JUST AS SCARY if not more so and far more believable than some gargantuan special effect, this movie shows that any normal unarmed human being is going to be terrified and vulnerable floundering in the water with an approximately 10 foot long apex predator. I can't help but compare this to the team's previous film, BLACK WATER. The difference for me is, in BLACK WATER, I felt I was given enough time at the start to get to know and care about the characters AND it was difficult to predict who would be left alive, if any of them. In THE REEF, I felt the backstory for the two ""main"" protagonists was WAY too cliche'ed, as was their character development throughout the ordeal. Also, I almost hate to say it but the tension just went on and on and on and got to be too much. Sure, this was believable, but, the repeated shots of the actors gaping around looking shell-shocked started to become unintentionally comical after a while. Finally, I'm still undecided about the nature of the attacks. POSSIBLE SPOILERS HERE- I felt the whole being yanked under, coming up once and then being yanked under for good just didn't quite make sense, given that this was not a huge shark which could swallow someone in two bites. The movie is so realistic and yet the attacks don't seem to jive with all the research I've read about how great whites DO hunt. I guess it was a budgetary concern but not one person was assaulted with the shark speeding straight up from below. But, as I said, I'm still on the fence about this. And the end, while also realistic and not at all the usual cliche'ed final confrontation (which one could argue wasn't the case with BLACK WATER) the realism made the viewing experience rather anti-climactic and ""is that it?"" for me. OPEN WATER had a similar effect, but, that was so clearly a TRAGEDY and I could empathize with the character's final choice. Overall, though, this is such an admirable film, and it's so nice to see real-looking people and not wise-cracking waxed-chested young male models as the leads. And this film contains one of the most joltingly realistic-looking scenes of a shark suddenly surfacing RIGHT NEXT TO REAL PEOPLE. AHHHHH! This alone brought me back to the so-thrilled-to-be-terrified feeling of seeing the original JAWS in a crowded theater when it was first released. Very cool.",1343260800,,2529,4.659955257270694

It's the based-on-a-true-story movie of a group of people who encounter boat trouble while out in the middle of nowhere.  The nearest island is 12 miles away and they have to decide whether to attempt to swim to the island or remain on the boat and hope help arrives.  The ones who decide to ""swim for it"" encounter (of course) sharks.  What makes this film better than most shark movies is there are no fake sharks but footage of real sharks incorporated into the movie.  The storyline is a good one and the actors, while primarily unknown, are believable in their roles.

Everything taking place before this was your typical build-up of friends partying and going on a boat ride only to find that something happens and they're left stranded in the water.  We've seen this type of storytelling in every kind of shark movie ever.  Wanna know why?

Because that's really the only thing you CAN create when it comes to shark attacks.  Oh, and what are the odds the shark would suddenly become exceptionally vicious right when the remaining survivors spot a resting area?  Come on!  It took forever for the survivors to reach safe ground- it was always *just* a few hundred yards away!

Well the Reef does do a few things right.  First of all the acting is pretty good, especially by the female actress who plays lead role.  Her screaming and yelling during a shark attack actually struck me as believable.  You can sense a distinct type of screaming that really DOES sound like someone's life is in serious danger.  I sensed an authentic scream with her skills.  Excellent job there.  Another thing the Reef does correctly is occasionally show the survivors swimming for their lives in an attempt to escape the shark and the camera view does a magnificent job showing the people swimming from a sharks point of view and just how vulnerable we really are in that situation.  Gee no wonder the shark always wins- we're too slow!

Overall, well if you're in the mood for another shark attack suspense, this movie probably falls a little short thanks to taking nearly an hour for the first attack to happen- the rest of the time is taken up with a VERY slow-moving atmosphere that fails to leave an impression on me due to being predictable, and the other reason I'm taking away one star is because all shark movies are basically the same since there's not much you can really do with this popular, worn out formula.

I watched it on my first plane trip to Australia, and it perfectly ruined me for any future small boat rides.

The Reef is a huge cut (or shall I say bite) above the rest.  this film does have a major sense of dejavu for anyone who has seen the creepfest known as Open Water, however, this film is also directed and acted with great skill that any comparisons are instantly forgivable.  There is an overwhelming sense of dread in this film within the first 20 minutes.  The terror these people feel is palpable and will leave even the most jaded viewer deeply unnerved.  There are a few bad reviews on here describing a boring bloodless movie.  Dont listen to them!  If you want a stupid unrealistic gorefest of a shark movie than watch one of the countless direct to dvd movies that over crowd the shelves at Walmart.  The Reef is a tense scary thriller that delivers in generating more than a few chills.  One beef I had with the movie was the ""based on a true story"" tag.  This ploy is so overdone and ridiculous and makes one think that the filmaker didn't have enough confidence in his film to stand on its own merits without having to fabricate a ""true story"" gimmick.

This movie is really boring.  A group of friends go out on a boat.  The boat ends up capsizing.  The capsizing event should have been a surprise, tense or some form of shock; however, it happened so quickly the viewer didn't even experience any sensation of the groups' distress.  The group then decides to swim for land/help.  However, one member stays behind on the capsized boat.  The group of four that decides to swim gets picked off one by one.  They get bit by sharks and the viewer sees a bit of red/dark water and that's about it.  All in all not an effective horror movie.  A horror movie should instill some since of dread or err horror...not bordom.  I know there isn't alot of defense a human can do in the water against a shark but it would have been nice to at least see one of the swimmers attempt an eye gouge or something...some survival senses kicking in would be nice.

4470940,5,B004USUPAI,"Yes, The Reef is similar to Open Water but ramps up the scare factor by giving us the mother of all sharks, the Great White. The way in which the movie puts you amongst the actors is really well done. You feel like you are there with them. When the camera dips under the surface of the water with the bobbing motion of the waves you get little glimpses of what lies beneath. The tension is unbearable at times and I felt sick with fear. It's the anticipation of the oncoming attack that had me wriggling in my seat. Believe me, when the first attack comes you will bang your head off the ceiling in fright.

I admit that this is my worst fear. Being stalked by a predator in their own territory. Especially in the ocean by a Great White. You get moments of respite to catch your breath and lower your stress levels. That just adds to the tension as these guys have to push on to reach dry land. Will they get to dry land and survive? Watch it and see if you dare.

4470941,4,B004USUPAI,"It appears this story was taken from an actual event. There's no way for the viewer to tell how much the story was tweeked for filming purposes but the producers/ director conveyed this in a very unsensational, unexploitative. manner.

Here's the scoop. Set in Australia, five friends (three guys and two women) set out on a cruise. About ten miles from shore their boat hits a reef and capsizes. There is little hope of rescue so they need to swim the ten miles back without getting eaten by sharks.

I liked this. The shark thing has been done any number of times in film and I'm a bit surprised they keep rebooting it, but here you can see why. Everything in this movie happens in a very believable manner. The viewer is introduced to the characters just well enough in the beginning to sort them out. You don't get types. Just real people. When the boat hits the reef one of the two veterans in the group lays out their options logically. Nothing is trumped up. Just 'it is what it is' and this is our best course of action. Four go. One opts to stay. They hit the water and head back to shore. Then the sharks happen. These are not over-the-top Jaws style attacks. They're very quick and, though unspectacular, still carry a gravity in the way the players react. The final kill might have been a bit much but they could have played it a lot heavier and, thankfully, they didn't.

It's shot and cut well. The actors all do a stand-up job. At 88 minutes, it doesn't ware out its welcome. This is just a good, solid effort by all involved.",1323648000,,1541,4.4

So, The Reef here is my last disappointment. Infantile dialogues and shots of the deep blue sea characterize it. It seems that the director used here real sharks but they are not scary at all. However, I understand the actors who refused to swim in the company of a great white shark. Instant crap.",1322611200,,454,4.548780487804878
4470943,4,B004USUPAI,"As others have written, this film is based upon a real incident. Of course the filmmakers changed much in order to highten the drama. The incident was something that took place in 1983 when a trawler went down and the captain, one mate on board, and a female cook were terrorized for hours on end by a tiger shark. The cook and the other guy were both killed. The captain survived, but was himself mauled before rescue.
  The Reef gives us 5 people who's small yaught strikes something and capsizes along the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. This area is beautiful but quite dangerous, as the luckless maritime adventurers soon discover when 4 of them decide to swim the 10-12 miles toward a small island they had seen earlier. The fifth guy stays behind atop the boat, which could sink at any time, refusing to get in the water.
  Before long the swimmers discover that they are being followed by what turns out to be a large Great White Shark. The way the filmmakers handle the behavior of the shark is quite realistic, which I've not seen before in any shark attack movie. At first it is merely attracted by the splashing, then curious, not getting too close (whenever the swimmer with the diving mask looks underwater at it, the thing turns and swims off quickly). After while it goes into full-on attack mode, and things get really tense, really frightening. I must give high points to this for using a real shark. There are no lame cartoonish CGI or animatronics, they did not try and make the fish look like it was 30 frickin' feet long. Also the blood and gore was kept to a minimum, focusing instead on the tension and the terror of the situation. I have no problem with blood and gore, but it was not necessary here and works fine without. Even though it must have been tempting to show a bitten-off limb or two.
  I highly recommend The Reef for it's realism, artistic restraint and subtlety, and for tension and suspense. It's like Open Water only MUCH better, as the people in The Reef are not annoying and do not argue and bitch at each other the whole time. In Open Water I was going ""hurry up and die, already, you jerks"".
  If the thought of being stranded in deep water is scary to you, you will be scared by this. It's well done. The best shark movie that I've seen since Jaws!! Most ""shark horror"" films are terrible.",1322524800,5,2337,4.482352941176471

Those who liked ""Open Water"" should like it; similar type of plot but ""The Reef"" is even better.

The main plot is four shipwrecked survivors must basically swim/float their through 10 miles of great white shark infested waters in Australia. Unlike ""Open Water,"" the viewer sees actual sharks above and below the surface - but the sharks don't come across as either large fake contraptions, or obvious CGI (perhaps as others allude to because they're neither).  The movie also quite nicely adds subtle bits of tension leading up to the main meat of the plot.  Besides ""Open Water"" in a way one could consider this the ""Blair Witch"" of shark movies...but without the ""herky-jerk"" camera-work.

4470947,5,B004USUPAI,"Personally, I never plan to be in a situation where I have to choose between swimming through shark-infested waters to possible safety and staying atop a capsized sinking boat with very little chance of being rescued.  Unfortunately, that's exactly the situation the characters of The Reef find themselves in when their boat strikes a reef and capsizes in the waters of Australia's Great Barrier Reef.  Those beautiful blue Pacific waters aren't so inviting when you're suddenly forced to ponder the dangers that lie beneath.  It's true that The Reef follows the standard formula in a genre that is already bursting with shark attack movies in recent years, but this one is well worth watching because it is based on a true story (albeit loosely, with a number of significant changes) and, more importantly, it hits all the right buttons of fear, suspense, and realism.

The trip was supposed to be a holiday for Luke (Damian Walshe-Howling), his friend Matt (Gyton Grantley), Matt's girlfriend Suzie (Adrienne Pickering), and Matt's sister (and Luke's former girlfriend) Kate (Zoe Naylor) - and so it was until their yacht hit a reef and capsized.  With the keel pretty much laid open, Luke lays out the group's options.  Option 1 is to stay on the slowly sinking boat and hope they are rescued before it goes down - but there is very little traffic in that area, the boat's old distress beacon can only be picked up by a plane flying overhead,  and the current is pushing them out toward the ocean.  Option 2 is to swim for it to Turtle Island twelve miles away.  Luke's sole crewman is adamant about staying with the boat because he knows they are in shark-infested waters, but Luke thinks their only realistic chance is to swim for it.  Personally, I would be staying there with Warren - no doubt about it.  No one even mentions the fact that, sharks or no sharks, any miscalculation on Luke's part would mean the swimmers would never find land of any type.

We never get on intimate terms with these characters, but they're all likable enough for you to care what happens to them.  Being a great lover of sharks, I sometimes find myself pulling for the shark over annoying or patently unlikable characters, but that was not the case in The Reef.  This is one serious example of nature's perfect killing machine, to boot.  This shark looks like he's been in more than a few scrapes in his time - he's big, he's bad, and he's totally unstoppable.  It's no wonder the characters panic every time he puts in an appearance - and realistic panic it is.  They do exactly what they shouldn't do, splashing around all over the place as they cling to one another in fear.  The actresses do a particularly good job of demonstrating shock - particularly Zoe Naylor, whose over-the-top facial expressions would be laughable in any other situation.  As far as I'm concerned, though, there's no such thing as overacting when it comes to displaying the fear of being eaten alive by a magnificent shark.

One of the great things about this Australian movie is that it was actually shot out on the water (in Harvey Bay), and the shark footage is real (shot specifically for this movie).  For an entire month, the actors spent up to ten hours a day, six days a week in the water (presumably, inside a large, protective tank) dealing with weather changes and some serious skin wrinkling.  At one point, Damian Walshe-Howling had to be rushed to a hospital after being stung by a poisonous fish.  The point is -- these aren't a bunch of dopes in a studio pool relying on CGI sharks.  They're as close to actually swimming with the sharks as anyone but a complete lunatic could be.

4470949,2,B004USUPAI,"""Based on the true events,"" a 2010 Australian film ""The Reef"" follows the story of a group of five friends on vacation, whose yacht capsizes while sailing on the coral reef. In the middle of the ocean, with no land in sight, they have to make a tough decision: to stay or to swim. And for those who chose the latter there is another question: Is it safe?

Filmed on location (and apparently with no computer graphics), ""The Reef"" benefits from its authentic scenery, but needs much better storytelling. I can accept cardboard characters and their boring romance as long as the film delivers the goods, which arrive too slowly. Much of the film's running time is spent on waiting for something to happen, and the wait is too long.

You get some nice suspense during the shark attack scenes, which, however, start to look repetitious after a while, with characters doing the same things over and over again. This is to some extent understandable as what the completely defenseless humans in the shark-infested waters can do in reality is very limited, but at the same time diminishes the film's entertainment value considerably.

""The Reef"" is written and directed by Andrew Traucki, who has directed (with David Nerlich) ""Black Water"" in 2007, a suspense movie with a similar storyline.

This is no Jaws.
I blinked and must have missed how the sailboat capsized.  One minute it was sailing along, the next minute, everyone was under (in) the upside down boat.  The continuity was mishandled; there were time issues throughout this movie.  It wasn't only the water that was choppy.  The setup was a few brief vignettes that did nothing in the way of introducing the victims (I meant cast of characters).  If it wasn't for their frenzied shouting of ""Matty"" and ""Suzie"" at two key moments, I would never have known the names of at least 2 of the 5 characters involved.  A minimal amount of acting skills was required.  Basically, this was about a shark rarely seen.  The level of suspense was rudimentary at best.  It isn't difficult to play upon an inherent fear...what could be in the water below us!?  This movie was adequate.

On the nonsensical side of things: apparently there were no lifejackets to be had.  They didn't bother patching the raft they ruined earlier.  No spear guns either, not so much as a butter knife for protection, no flares, the EPIRB was ancient and needed planes directly overhead to receive a signal.  They did everything possible to doom their rescue....including dressing like seals and thrashing about in the water as they swam.

Three people meet their friend Luke somewhere in Australia.  He and his work buddy takes them out on a yacht.  They go snorkeling for the day at this small secluded island.  Afterwards, when the tide is low, they hurry to the yacht and set sail.  A little while later the yacht capsizes and ends up w/ a hole in it.  Luke suggests to the group that they take a chance and swim back to that tiny island rather than take a chance and drift out further on the capsized yacht.  Everyone except Luke's working buddy agrees to swim back to the island; being a fisherman, he knows the waters have sharks in them.  Luke salvages a floatation board, breaks it, and divided the pieces to aid in swimming.  Luke guesses the island is 12 miles away and they should make it there in three hours.  Once they head out, drowning is the least of their worries.

Of course, the hook of this movie is the suspense in which there is plenty of.  The gore and/or blood factor was not overused.  What really made this movie, in my opinion, is that it focused on the terror being felt by the group of people in the water.  It concentrated on the people's hysteria being terrorized by the shark -especially when not in view.  There is not really a surprise twist which is actually refreshing.

4470966,4,B004USUPAI,"Judge Patrick Naugle, DVD Verdict-- To look at the cover of The Reef you would assume one of two things. The first would be that this is a chintzy, fourth rate B-movie from a studio cashing in on every other killer shark movie made in the past decade, especially the upcoming big budget thriller Shark Night 3D (which, by the way, looks flippin' awesome...but I digress). The second would be that this is one of those Roger Corman produced Syfy station clunkers about various slimy, horrible monsters/reptiles/mutations/hybrids that battle each other under a San Francisco bridge. The good news is you'd be wrong on both counts: The Reef is a small but tightly tuned thriller that gets the job done when it comes to killer sharks and fleshy bodies floating around in the water.

The Reef is one of those movies that is scary not because it's well constructed (although it's put together well) and not because it uses music to maximum effect (although that's not bad, either). No, The Reef is scary because it drops you into a situation that, even in the hands of Ed Wood or Uwe Boll, would make you crap your pants on a Sunday in the middle of a rainstorm. It's pretty hard to screw up throwing sane, competent adults into the middle of the ocean with mindless eating machines.

The Reef is presented in 2.35:1 widescreen in 1080p resolution. This is a very good looking image that has sharp colors and a very crisp picture. Much of the film takes place outdoors on the open sea and the bright blues of both the open ocean and the clear skies make for a vibrant, often brightly lit picture. No noticeable defects can be seen during the film's runtime. Overall Image Entertainment has done a very fine job with this transfer.

The soundtrack is presented in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and, while adequate to the film, doesn't leave a lot to be desired in the way of giving your sound system a hearty workout. There are some sporadic moments when the rear and front speakers kick in to give the viewer a nice surround sound feel--mainly during the shark attacks--but this is a mostly front heavy sound mix filled with moments of ambient sound (and some scary music). Also included on this disc are English SDH and Spanish subtitles.

There is little in the way of extra features on The Reef. All viewers get is a fairly short making-of featurette titled ""Shooting with Sharks"" which has some talking head interviews with the cast and the crew, behind-the-scenes footage and other EPK materials you'd find on typical promo pieces.

4470967,5,B004USUPAI,"It's hard to compare this movie to others. It was loosely based on a true story with some obvious liberties for plot.  It fell beneath the radar as it was an Austrailian made film.  Just in its release there were places banning the movie due to the expected effect that it would have on Austrailian tourism. Perhaps this is because it is a very realisticly made movie taking place in an area of Austrailia which is reknown for seals as well as the Apex predators that feed on them. The reefs are a beauty unlike any other but harbor many dangers. There is much realism in the production value here. By this I mean that they used only real sharks in the filming of the movie. No CGI effects to ""muddy the water"" here. The actors were in the water at times with a true Great White shark.
I think that these facts add to the tension. And tension is what this movie gives you over and over.

I will not spoil the fun but the basic plot takes 4 aussies out on a chartered boat together in search of a deserted island. They find it without any problem but within about 20 minutes of the film the subject matter takes a turn. The boat they are on hits a Reef in the middle of the night turning a nice trip into a fight for survival. Being in a remote area with no planes flying over is a recipe for disaster.  Some 12 miles away from the island they just visited (perhaps the size of a gymnasium) they find themselves in the water with no supplies (all washed into the ocean).  They climb on top of the far too damaged bottom of the boat and plan their next step.  The captain of the boat (a commercial fisherman and sea salt) makes the most prophetic and educated statement of the movie which is chilling to those with a fear of the ocean and it's elements,  ""I've fished these waters for years and I know what is in these waters. You will never get me into this water. I will stay on the boat no matter what!""

Herein lies the tension of the film.  Forced with either staying on the boat until they are found (and possibly moving deeper into sea and more into trouble on the current that is pulling them to ?) OR making a life or death swim 12 miles through shark infested water to get back to the island they were forced to leave after a very brief visit.  I will not go into the whos and what's but some stay and some leave and what happens from here is over 1 hour of a life or death struggle with the fears that many of us dream about while safely out of said water.

The biggest reason to watch this movie is because of the way it plays with you psychologically.  Early in the film one of the main characters has just gotten into the water for the first time and after several minutes of magnificent underwater life it all of a sudden gets extremely calm all around her. Like the sound has been completely taken away.  She looks around her, to the right, the left, behind her... And then she sees a shark swimming deep below the surface in the craggy reef.  She doesn't know what to do. Swim away? Sit still?  This is the mood that the directors are going for and it is achieved. A haunting sense of the unknown, of being in a situation you can't possible control.  This movie is well acted, well paced and enjoyable if you like a good scare or the uncomfortable feeling like that scare is slowly circling you and sizing you up..  At that point it is just too late...

On the negatives a certain reef scene near the end is just a little too scripted to fit and I will give no more away.  Other than that particular scene near the end of the film it felt genuine and scary!

In short, I highly reccomend this film.  It is not likely at your local rental store as it was not domestically touted but it is a truly well made and tense shark attack movie based on a true story.  Enjoy!",1311120000,37,3780,4.199170124481328
