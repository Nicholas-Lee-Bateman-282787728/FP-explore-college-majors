8536214,5,B0095R3T4I,I loved this movie! I still recommend it to friends and family. My mother enjoyed it as well,1523404800,,92,4.166666666666667
8536215,5,B0095R3T4I,"This is one of the most beautiful, touching films I've ever seen.  I rented it many years ago and loved it so much that I immediately bought it.  At the time I didn't understand Indian culture as much as I do now, and since learning more about the subject the film holds an even greater appeal to me in its honesty, realism, and poignancy.  I definitely recommend this movie.",1493510400,,375,4.405797101449275
8536216,1,B0095R3T4I,"I purchased this film, it came and was quite obviously a street version from India, still had an Indian pricetag in rupees on it. It did not play on my U.S. player, even though it was marked NTSC.  So I had to return it.",1473120000,,220,4.0
8536217,3,B0095R3T4I,"The movie is well made, but this rating is not a criticism of its artistic merit or its intent to raise awareness: it's more about the fact that this particular subject is not within the range of my very personal interests. If this subject is of interest to you, then see it, by all means. On a seemingly contradictory note, I liked how the two starring actresses played their roles very much. The choice is yours.",1456876800,,414,4.4605263157894735
8536218,3,B0095R3T4I,"The ladies are beautiful, and the expressed desire to live is very positive, but overall it has too little romance and is too much the result of fatal circumstances.",1434240000,,165,4.724137931034483
