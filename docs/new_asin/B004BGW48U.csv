8421962,5,B004BGW48U,"My particular ""favorite"" within this Holiday & Christmas TV Classics' DVD is the BRADY BUNCH's Christmas Episode,  which happens to be the Brady's very FIRST Christmas, TOGETHER!  (Florence Henderson is a real cutie, then & today!!!)

*CLASSIC Brady Bunch WONDERFUL, one of those episodes, which made us LOVE the Brady's, in the First Place!

I myself, was Cindy's age, when the Brady Bunch, first aired!  It's TRUE we ALL believed in the Brady's and in the MESSAGE that they so wonderfully displayed, for all of America, to f.e.e.l. and cherish!

The Andy Griffith Christmas Episode brings back lot's of fun, warm memories..,  makes me ""almost"" want to spend the holidays in Mayberry's JAIL, too!  (ho ho ho)",1353456000,6,709,5.0
