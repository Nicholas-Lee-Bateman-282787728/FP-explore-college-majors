1828497,5,B000087F5P,This is a fresh look at incarceration by someone who knows. I found the characters to be colorful and intriguing. The narration and recurring situations kept me enthralled and wondering what would happen next. The use of music was strong and appropriate. I loved it!,1047945600,2,266,4.933333333333334

7979623,2,B000087F5P,"Down Time came recommended by a friend when I mentioned I've seen the Australian indie ""Chopper"" (one of the early works of Eric Bana and none too fascinating either.)

 Filmed in unmistakably low-fi B&W tint, with a macho heavy-metal thrash soundtrack, the look and sound were clearly going for gritty. But along with the downbeat storyline, they just make sure that this attempted low-budget film is just that -- cheap.

 Cliches abound: violence, drug abuse, sheer boredom of an inmate's life. The shock or fear quotient is largely derived from disgusting moments from uninspired characters play-acting stuff like a high school drama.

 If you want raw, there's ""Romper Stomper"" with Russel Crowe. But this farce is a strictly skippable amateur effort that looks more like outtakes from a B film on some local channel.",1090540800,6,821,5.08955223880597
7979624,4,B000087F5P,"I am a big fan of low budget independent filmmaking and Sean Wilson (11) Down Time is a maverick achievement. Shot on a shoe string budget (check the stats), this is no Hollywood action film, but what you get is from the gut film making. Gritty performances by WilliamVan Nolan and Sam McBride make this a stand out film in the low budget arena. Some of the card playing scenes reminded me of the film Clerks (1994) with lots of off the wall snappy dialogue. You could also compare it to some the jail scenes in Jim Jarmusch's Down by law (1986) both films have lots of long still shots that just kind of hand there and make you feel the oppressive boredom of prison life.
Sure there are some technical problems with this film and some of the side characters acting is weak but you have to be able to over look that. Down Time is what independent filmmaking is all about.",1075507200,,871,4.3496932515337425
7979625,5,B000087F5P,"You have to like low-budget independent films to get into this film but it is a good one! The best description that I can come up with for Down Time is that it is like the film ""Clerks"" in prison. The film moves along in a docu-drama style driven by a surprisingly good ""grungy"" soundtrack. I really enjoyed this film but remember this is not ""The Rock"".

7979626,1,B000087F5P,"This was a complete waste of time.  Does not accurately portray prison life.  How the lead so-called ""actor"" went through the entire movie, unscathed, is just totally ridiculous. The ""actors"" in the beginning, the shoot-out, their reaction time was totally off mark, and if you watch the guy on the left, he is laughing as he is dropping.  I can not believe that these guys actually got a chance to be in a film. I can't believe I actually watched this.  This does not deserve 1 star.  It just goes to show, that anyone can be an actor.  I wish I could get a paycheck by making a fool of myself.  JUST PLAIN HORRIBLE, I don't know what the rest of these guys were watching.",1073260800,2,673,4.336
7979627,5,B000087F5P,"The payoff from a great prison film - and this definitely is one - is the sense of incarceration that envelopes the viewer.  You are there, immersed in the noise, the danger, the tedium of the joint itself.  In Down Time the directing, editing, and cinematography shove the prison experience down your throat in spades.  The payoff is a sly narrative twist at the end which both ties the threads of the story together and gives an additional ironic kick to the viewer's identification with the film.  Can't give it away here, but buy it and see for yourself!  You won't forget the experience.  Great sound track too!",1048204800,2,616,4.657407407407407
