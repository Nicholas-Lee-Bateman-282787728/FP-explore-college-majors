2354791,1,B000A3457Q,"I thought that this was another Stargate SG-1 movie. Boy was I wrong! IMO the people who made this video and who subscribe to this bizzare theory have named the DVD in a way as to incourage Stargate SG-1 fans to purchase it and thus increase sales. SG-1 fans: STAY AWAY, this is not for you.",1168300800,79,291,4.214285714285714
2354792,5,B000A3457Q,"If you are looking for the Stargate series and movies, look elsewhere. I do like them too,but this a science show, not science-fiction. Very interesting topics and if you like science and history, this is for you. If you just like Jack going against some snake heads, stay away!",1166400000,20,278,4.6938775510204085
2354793,1,B000A3457Q,"I started to watch this DVD and turned it off, it is basically a videoed presentation taken at a convention. It has nothing to do with Stargate the movie or TV series which was very disappointing. It appears to be a technical explanation of blackholes, ancient earth legends and the like.  While the subject matter is interesting I found the presentation to be very long, drawn out and boring.  The title is very misleading and I will repeat it so that's it's very clear this has NOTHING to do with the Stargate series.

To wrap it up I thought this was a waste of my time and money.  If however, you are really into watching recorded presentations of this nature it could be your thing.",1162512000,148,687,4.472
2354794,1,B000A3457Q,"I suppose I could have given it a higher rating for being so 'out there' but I get the impression that this guy is purely out to capitalise on the popular television series, Stargate, when this has absolutely nothing to do with the show or movie of the same name. Potential buyers should be aware of this. The same author has done  this before in relation to Atlantis, immediately after the spin-off series was released.

This 'presentation' is a variation on the astronauts built the pyramids and the gods are really ETs theme, and a poorly presented one at that. One of the television Stargate novels did the Mayan thing and did it well, but the author made no attempt to covert me into a believer.  If you want to believe in this sort of thing, fine, but I'd suggest buying von Daniken (Chariots of the Gods, for example) or Sitchin's work, or joining the Scientology group, and give this one a wide miss.",1154304000,225,908,4.524390243902439
2354795,5,B000A3457Q,"Overall, I have no problems with this presentation.  It is not a flashy cheesy production full of eye candy, so I won't compare it to that genre.  It is a man behind a podium showing slides and suggesting some well researched and very exciting theories.  Not much about the Mayan calendar itself, but a wealth of inerpretations of ancient art. If you like the feeling of your mind opening up and the cobwebs being blown out, you'll like this. At times it seems he may be stretching a bit, but his theories seem more sound than the usual stale university dribble that so many have become content with. Anyone interested in the Mayan prophecies, ancient cultures, art, enlightenment, religion, crop circles, this is great stuff and fodder for endless conversation and reflection.  If you're looking for some dramatized unsolved mystery cheese, look elsewhere.  Five Stars, final answer.",1148342400,26,884,4.98639455782313
8073615,4,B000A3457Q,"Stargate 2012
is not bad but it mised the Cast of Stargate SG.1
It is more a Ailien View of or planet.
It give you an inside look of the real job of Daniel Jackson",1358294400,,163,3.6857142857142855
8073616,4,B000A3457Q,it is interesting but you could have your own feeling its also a kind of manipulating the people the look at this fiml,1353110400,,118,4.173913043478261
8073617,1,B000A3457Q,"The title sounded interesting but the product was boring.  This man took everything he could put his hands on to talk quite unauthoratatively.  I recommend you DO NOT buy this.  But, it is your money you waste if you want to throw it away!",1290470400,6,239,4.386363636363637
8073618,1,B000A3457Q,"I guess I should have looked at the reviews of this DVD before I bought it.
It has nothing to do with Stargate, Stargate SG-1 or Stargate Atlantis.  Its a 2 dvd lecture on metaphysics.  Yawn.",1250467200,12,191,4.277777777777778
8073619,3,B000A3457Q,"Interesting concepts and analysis.  Long dissertation, with much information covered.  Must have patience & an open mind.  Concepts stem from Mayan calender and related topics.  Looking for answers?  This will reveal some very unique beliefs.  Again, come with an open mind.",1246924800,5,274,5.560975609756097
8073620,5,B000A3457Q,"This is not an entertaining movie - this is an extremely informative documentary workshop for those of you who are interested in theories on so-called ""doomsday"" 2012 - what is to expect and what may or may not happen to us and to our planet. William Henry, an investigative mythologist and author of a number of bestselling books, has done a profound historical and scientific research, the outcome of which he is sharing in this workshop in a form of theories and ideas. He analyzes a number of worldwide predictions, symbols, and latest scientific discoveries to drive a conclusion that there is a beam of some ""atomic particles"" is about to arrive from the center of Milky Way into our solar system, which perhaps could be some debrie from a galaxi breaking apart. One must have at least some basic knowledge in ancient mythology, religious philosophy, and NASA discoveries prior to watching this workshop, since the information can be quite overwhelming if there is no prior knowledge in this arena.",1226620800,12,1004,4.911764705882353
8073621,2,B000A3457Q,"This is really weak. Take 'Chariots of the gods' meet the History Channel mythology division, toss in the name STARGATE and you have this weak, watered down presentation.",1201392000,9,170,5.107142857142857
8073622,1,B000A3457Q,"If I want to sit through a boring presentation where every noteworthy concept is repeated 9 times I'd go back to school where I can at least have fun with my fellow students.

Don't buy the terribly bad filmed presentation buy the book instead. I mean his theories are as crazy as they are interesting to know about but far better to absorb in written form.",1181433600,14,357,4.409090909090909
8073623,3,B000A3457Q,"Don't bother buying this when you can get it from your public library. This has nothing to do with the popular scifi series. And before all the so called academics (used loosely)lose there wits, I watched it knowing exactly what it concerned. My opinion is if it interests you watch it but I don't believe you should buy it.",1179792000,12,324,4.508474576271187
8073624,5,B000A3457Q,"To those reviewers who were looking for the SG-1 TV series (that I also enjoy), perhaps reading more than a title is in order!  Come on!

Mr. Henry is obviously a scholar who has done a tremendous amount of deep research and thoughtful analysis on a fascinating topic.  The DVD set is merely an introduction to a vast topic (a taped lecture).  However, it is a compelling and vastly informative introduction!  If you have any interest in Egyptology, mythology, Bible history, or the future of our species, this is more than worthwhile.",1173830400,19,535,4.771739130434782
