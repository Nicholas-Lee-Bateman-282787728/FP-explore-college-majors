8331824,5,B001P1Z7S8,I really enjoyed this video. I love the Iditarod and always watch the race. This is one of my favorite videos of the Iditarod. I enjoy all the Mushers and their dogs. This is so interesting because the viewer gets to see how the Mushers take care of their teams on the trail and all of the hard times they have in this 1100 mile race in the Alaskan wilderness.,1363737600,,360,4.1571428571428575
