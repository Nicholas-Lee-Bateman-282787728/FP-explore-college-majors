8354374,4,B0027API8K,"McDull is a wonderful animation from Hong Kong that won some film festivals back in 2004. McDull is the most average character ever however through his dreams he's able to appreciate life and create new chapters in it. There's a lot of humorous pokes from the animators on their own culture allowing one to better understand that at the end of the day all the parents want is the best for their children and to have a strong work ethic. I'd highly recommend the second one as well, ""Prince De La Bun"" which goes about knowing one's limitations in life to go to their full potential and once more lots of humorous jabs at their own culture. The films are beautifully animated, simple, and to the point for adults and kids to love.",1281571200,,729,4.488721804511278
