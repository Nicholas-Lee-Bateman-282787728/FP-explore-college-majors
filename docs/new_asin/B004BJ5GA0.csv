4319076,5,B004BJ5GA0,"Yes, it is only one episode. Yes, this seems kind of expensive for a single 22 minute video...
But it is worth it. For one thing, you get 75 minutes of really interesting extra features about the making of the episode, including an in-depth discussion of the weapons and gear they chose for the bunnies and the functionality of each item. Unfortunately, the extra features are in Japanese (with english subtitles), but whatchagonnado. I still found them fascinating.
If I understand correctly, they are using funding from this DVD and Blu-ray sale to finance production of more episodes. I want more episodes, so I want you to buy these discs. Buy a bunch of them and give them as gifts.",1297728000,20,687,4.733333333333333
4319077,5,B004BJ5GA0,"this is frickin' impressive.  I saw the YouTube version and it was unreal.  I will never look at bunnies the same way again.  The attention to detail (watched it in HD) was superb.

Kind of pricey at twenty bucks an episode it will be difficult to resist ordering them up anyway.",1297641600,5,279,4.411764705882353
4319078,5,B004BJ5GA0,"It's FINALLY here--the original solicitation said it would be out before the end of 2010, but it was worth the wait. If you're not sure about it, and these reviews aren't enough, check out the edited You-Tube version up for only a limited-time. If you like what you see, go for it. The uncut definitely adds to the experience, and the extras are great. It's pricey, I know...$30 for 22 minutes is alot (ore $20 for the DVD), but this is being put out by the production company as a way to get revenue to fund the other 12 episodes of the series. The original manga was great (released by ADV Manga, now out of print), and the continuation of their combat is fantastic. I just can't figure out how these guys are supposed to still be in active duty...I mean, the original series was Vietnam...",1297296000,6,792,4.431506849315069
4319079,4,B004BJ5GA0,I just finished watching this episode and it was excellent. Definately 2 thumbs up. Action packed with good voice acting and superb cgi and a good story. Im looking forward to episode 2 and would love to see a 60-90 minute movie of this show.,1297209600,5,242,4.4
4319080,4,B004BJ5GA0,"I want to know how many episodes are actually on the disc. from reading the cover it looks like only one, and if that's so i'm not paying $30 for that. Although the episode on youtube rocked.",1297123200,,191,4.1891891891891895
4319081,5,B004BJ5GA0,"After watching the preview I had to buy this DVD! This is amazing work, well thought-out and animated.

Honestly 5 stars is not enough.",1296950400,11,135,4.625
4319082,5,B004BJ5GA0,"Holy cow, i just saw the episode on You Tube and WOW!  I can't wait to get the DVD!

I was actually impressed, between the chamber checks, suppressors, and kit, these guys spent their time doing research. The fuzzy bunnies rock!",1296950400,6,228,4.536585365853658
4319083,5,B004BJ5GA0,It's short but extremely hilarious I don't know what it is about rabbits killing terrorist camels but I cant stop laughing every time I watch it. The animation is awesome and the characters actually use proper weapons technique the creators definitely did their research. This movie is based off of a Japanese manga series but its a short film barely breaking 30 minutes. Definitely a buy,1383350400,,388,4.893939393939394
4319084,5,B004BJ5GA0,"Short anime but very well put together and very funny. A lot of attention to proper tactics, terminology, as well as realistic weapons.",1378944000,,135,4.913043478260869
4319085,5,B004BJ5GA0,"they love this show!! wish there were more episodes, hubby and son love how realistic this cartoon was made, the way they move, the details on the guns, etc.. perfect!",1373328000,,167,4.6
4319086,5,B004BJ5GA0,"Half my family lives in Japan and I have relatives in who work in the Anime industry one ( Niece) is even a small time voice actress. But anyway CS1 was or is in production as well and was supposed to be released early this year, its been delayed since 2010. But I have now heard that it has been delayed now because of either financial or production troubles. I have a cousin who knows the production company for this series. So lets hope they get it sorted out as if you have read the comics ""Apocalypse Meow"" Thankfully Im 3rd JA with my entire extended family now hitting 7 gens of Japaneses Americans, No Lee is NOT my real name on Amazon as it's set on private. Anyway I can speak fluently no accent and read or write in Japanese my whole family can wife and kids. ;) So no subs or dubs for moi (hate both) But there are so much great characters representing other countries etc in this series.

From example:

  American - Rabbit
  Vietnamese - Cat
  French - Pig
  Chinese - Panda
  Japanese - chimpanzee and Gorilla
  Russian - Bear
  Korean - Dog
  British - Rat
  Australian - Kangaroo

Yes this preview episode my be short but cool. It has tons of extra's too bad tho that the weapons and tactics adviser was using Airsoft guns in the studio demos. But he does shoot real AR's on a range etc. I'm a 40+yr shooter/collector and current Fed LEO. So I know a bit about firearms. ;)

But I been an Anime fan since I was a kid NOT an Otaku tho hehe now those dudes are obsessed. Another cool series is Girls Und Panzer, my 2 teen daughter's and I are the big Anime lovers in the household those 2 hate dubs and subs more than I do. My son? Hates all cartoons he loves real guns and competes in 3 gun. Anyways pardon the rant. Again hope they get their series produced and released. Now I know I'm just some dude on the internet and you should take my or anyone's word with a grain of salt. But I really am telling you the truth of what I know. Believe or not.. I don't care. I'm just saying its a great buy, whats up with IDA and hoping for rest and all the best for Okabe Junya,Sasahara Kazuya and the rest of the IDA crew.",1371945600,,2131,4.146341463414634
4319087,1,B004BJ5GA0,"Extremely short, bad plot, looks like a couple of college kids put it together in  their dorm room. Not worth the $20.00 price tag!",1370563200,,131,4.458333333333333
4319088,5,B004BJ5GA0,I enjoyed would the first episode it was a little short but I liked it can't wait to see episode 2,1369699200,,98,3.7142857142857144
4319089,5,B004BJ5GA0,"If you love action, accuracy of weapons, small little details and anthropomorphized bunnies with foul mouths and the ability to kick unlimited amounts of butt, you'll llove this. The detail given to the tactics, weapons and military protocol is amazing.",1367193600,,253,5.35
4319090,5,B004BJ5GA0,"I really wish it was longer than 15 minutes, but I love how technically correct it is, buy it and be happy",1367020800,,106,3.8636363636363638
4319091,5,B004BJ5GA0,This video will make you laugh and laugh. I was so amused with it I watched it over and over again.,1366502400,,99,3.761904761904762
4319092,3,B004BJ5GA0,"First, let's get the nasty stuff out of the way.  HORRIBLE voice acting by Will Prescott who voices the main character Packy.  Listening to him read his lines like a high school play was just embarrassing.  Every line he read just yanked me out of the movie and destroyed all the realism.  It sounded like a dub over that you would find on You Tube.  No voice inflection, near monotone, limited emotion... how did he even get the lead role with such bad voice acting??

Now the good stuff!  Very well done plot and story line.  The animation was smooth, believable, and very realistic.  They must have hired some real professionals on this one!  Only possible thing that could have made it better would have been higher texture resolutions for somethings, but that's it.  You know it's good when you are left wanting more!

Over all, you want this movie!",1365379200,,854,4.62
4319093,5,B004BJ5GA0,"I saw the trailer for this a little while back but never new it was available. I bought the English, Blu-ray version. If you are a fan of computer generated animation, heavy artillery and action, this is for you. Don't let the animals fool you. These aren't your run of the mill cute, fuzzy bunnies. They are military grade rodents with big guns and they're here to kick ass and much carrots...... and they're all out of carrots!

The motion capture is the best I've ever seen. As real as it gets. They had actual military tacticians wired for the action. The detail in the weaponry, scenery, and textures of the characters is flawless.  A MUST see for any fan of animation in general.",1364169600,,685,4.516129032258065
4319094,3,B004BJ5GA0,"It was cool seeing some cartoon rabits executing military grade tactics, using up to date gear/weapon systems to killing ""camels"", but it wasn't anything I'm going to watch over and over again. That being said, it was a job well done and hilarious.",1363651200,,248,4.790697674418604

4319096,5,B004BJ5GA0,"I was lucky enough to find this item at a reasonable cost. It's a really entertaining short film, but getting more difficult to find. I don't want to blow any details, so you'll have to,get one for yourself. This supplier has a great price and ships,quickly too!",1362614400,,262,4.595744680851064
4319097,5,B004BJ5GA0,"This really couldn't be better.
The military aspect is well thought out and obviously well informed.
The rabbit aspect is hysterical, and not as distracting as you would think.

Glad I bought this.",1362528000,,197,4.96969696969697
4319098,1,B004BJ5GA0,It's my mistake but I bought this thing for $26 for just one episode. Definitely not worth it since it was online for free,1362355200,,122,4.125

4319102,4,B004BJ5GA0,The animated video was cute and interesting to watch.  My wife even found the time to sit down and watch it with me.  Just wish it was a bit longer.,1359072000,,148,3.9
4319103,5,B004BJ5GA0,It's a shame it's only one episode.  But there's nothing else out there like this. I hope they make more episodes.,1358812800,,114,4.428571428571429
4319104,4,B004BJ5GA0,Very entertaining 20 minutes.  Excellent cg weapons and the tactics and such were very good.  I wish there were 3 or 4 episodes for the price.  I would purchase future episodes if there is more than 1 for the price.,1358035200,,215,4.325
4319105,1,B004BJ5GA0,"22 minute episode for $29.99 so not worth it. The show is funny but until they offer the ""season"" I'm not ordering anyother episodes.",1357603200,2,133,4.583333333333333
4319106,4,B004BJ5GA0,"Just picked this up recently because it looked hilarious. However, it's a very serious (yet simple) story about 2 mercenaries throwing themselves into the fray to rescue POW's. Rambo with rabbits basically, set in modern terms (Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, take your pick). The technical aspects of the animation are spot on, and the detail on the gear is modern and well thought out. You'd think they spent some time with Seal Team 1 before they created the action sequences, it is that well done, especially the exfiltration at the very end.

Is it worth $30? That's for you to decide. The CGI texture work is worth the visual upgrade I imagine, but the DVD is cheaper and gets the point across, albeit in 480p. In a perfect world, something this short (which is rumored to carry this price to help fund future episodes) would come with a voucher for a discount on the next episode.",1346457600,,884,4.703225806451613

4319115,4,B004BJ5GA0,The Episode is excellent to watch but the DVD is not worth the price. Some good info about the 'making of' was a helpful bonus but if there were multiple Episodes it would have been 5 star.,1300838400,2,189,4.135135135135135

4319118,4,B004BJ5GA0,"Beautiful film making overall, the 3D, camera work are beautiful, I enjoyed the action itself and it's military research into the film.
Short and sweet, it would leave the viewer wanting more.
My only critique would be:
The bonus can be done better with more professional sound on average and a stronger presentation for documentary film making...
since they advertised on the ""bonus"" as incentive to buy,
I believe more work needs to be put into making the bonus documentary itself.
Though that's quite a lot to ask for a smaller studio,
I support the marketing plan and hope to see more of this series.
(such as the feature length movie) after this release.",1299628800,3,659,4.7894736842105265

4319120,4,B004BJ5GA0,"Ok, it would be totally worth $9.99 or something, but $30 for 21 mins?

I was totally expecting several episodes and was disappointed to be done with the entire film before the popcorn was even ready to eat.  Yes, I should have realized it was short and blah blah blah. I was drunk when I ordered it (like most of my Amazon shopping).

Was it awesome? Yes! Detail is amazing.  Story is cookie-cutter war movie stuff, but who cares about plot.  Explosions, camel guts and bullet-time! Just as I got going it was over.  I had seen the entire episode on YouTube so I'd already seen it, nothing new or longer.  :/

I'll chalk this up to ""pay attention when you order"" and ""at least I am supporting the creators and now they have money to make more episodes which I'll probably break down and buy then bitch and moan about the price-per-min in a review""

4319121,5,B004BJ5GA0,"This is absolutely surreal, and a fun piece of art. I say art because how often are you able to see beautifully animated bunnies re-enacting modern day warfare in a way that looks true to life and is also choreographed better than a Hollywood action movie. Apparently this is based on a Japanese manga called Apocalypse Meow, which is genius in it's own right.
