8200376,5,6303364977,"Before we had The Internet & Amazon: we bought this on VHS  when it was first issued around 1995 and we just finished watching it again just a few minutes ago. It is not available on DVD: however it is still available on VHS ""used"" & ""new"". For the time period: which was The 1990's: this is excellant!

  It begins with Coach Adolph Rupp's beginning in the early 1930's and it takes you through U of K's first five NCAA Championship's: with the fifth being in 1978, their Rupp's Runt's period ending in 1966 with their loss to {then} Texas Western in the 1966 NCAA Championship Game and a portion of Coach Rick Pitino's Tenure & ""The Unforgettable's""  Heartbreaking NCAA Regional Final loss to Duke in 1992. At times: it gets you so emotional that my wife had to get up and leave the room before Duke's Christian Laettner hit that game winning shot! She didn't want to see that shot again!  :-)

  The biggest gripe I have with this is it should be updated to include their 1996, 1998 & 2012 NCAA Championships {not to mention them being 1997 NCAA Runner-up's}! Other than that: this is a fantastic trip down Memory Lane and Cawood Ledford's voice haves you wanting more! Even though it was issued twenty two years ago: you U of K Wildcat Fans will love it!

  There are brief interviews with Coach Adolph Rupp, Coach Rupp's son, Coach Joe B. Hall, Coach Rick Pitino, Former Cat players: Cliff Hagan, Jamal Mashburn, Dan Issel, Jack Givans, Mike Phillips, Rick Robey, Kyle Macy, Rupp's Runt's: Tommy Kron, Pat Riley & Louie Dampier, Unforgettable's: Ritchie Farmer & Sean Wood's plus many others!........There are 40 minutes of Film Archives on this VHS and our VHS Tape still plays Great and: As I said: This Film is  Excellent!",1491091200,,1730,4.61437908496732
