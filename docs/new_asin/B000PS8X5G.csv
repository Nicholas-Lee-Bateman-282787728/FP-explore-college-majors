Historically located at the end of the New German Cinema Movement of Herzog, Fassbinder, Wenders... this film definitely deserves wider recognition. It is the story of the final days of a woman author in West Germany whose novels had been very popular and supportive of East German Communism, when communism was still in vogue among a certain segment of West German leftest intelligentsia.

However, with the triumphant reunification of Germany in 1989, the market for her novels evaporated. Moreover, she is mostly ignored, and even scorned, by her former publisher, fans, and friends. Add to this a major problem with alcohol and drugs, and you have the recipe for total self destruction.

The film consists mainly of her torturous journey to find some comfort and affirmation. Unfortunately, she experiences one disappointment after another (e.g., from lover's, friends, family, strangers, a male prostitute, the medical establishment). Her inability to accept a united, more politically moderate, Germany and the fact she is getting older (She wears a semi-ridiculous wig to make her look younger) contribute greatly to her tragic fall. Men, ex-lovers, a male prostitute, a stranger in a bar, her son, are particularly cold and uncaring. The end comes in a detox center, with an unfriendly medical staff, which literally pushes her over the edge.

Unusually there is no trace of Nazism in this somewhat political post world war II German film. Although the Germans at the time of this film are not portrayed as being as sadistic as the Nazis, they are,for the most part, very cold and lacking in compassion; and,in a micro example, the reveling Germans foster the woman's disenfranchisement which is similar to that experienced by German Jewry under the Nazi's without the genocide. However, there are a few positive exceptions, like a fellow writer who visits her in a detox center,a secretary from her former publisher, and, to a lesser extent her elderly father, who had already experienced the self-destruction of another daughter.

The black and white cinematography blends nicely with the depressive nature of this film, and shows the new Germany in a very unflattering light. Moreover, the black and white cinematography, similar to that experienced in film noir, a genre which evolved out of German Expressionism, seems to epitomize the all or nothing attitudes of the characters, and, by inference, the newly unified country.

This film is quite disturbing, and definitely not for everyone, but it is a story that needed to be told about a personal fall and the hypocrisy that lies under the surface of many great historical events, like the many damaged anti heroes of post world war II American film noirs (e. g; ""Sunset Boulevard,"" ""The Big Heat"", many Bogart films). Also, for those who enjoy this film, ""No Place to Go"" weaves art and social criticism as often occurs in great works of such European directors as Goddard, Haneke, Bergman, Antonioni, Bela Tarr... Finally,it seems the film presents the central character's demise as a metaphor for the demise of East Germany.",1250380800,,3155,5.1065891472868215
