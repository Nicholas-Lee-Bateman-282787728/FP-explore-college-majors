3589053,5,B001FT4LTQ,"My 3 year old son absolutely loves all of The Land Before Time films, so naturally when I found out they had a TV series for a short time I was intrigued. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed (and neither is he). He loves each episode and it is made even better by the fact that Chomper is in each of them. They also introduced another new dinosaur called Ruby who is logical, yet funny.

I recommend this to anyone who has a youngster who enjoys any of the previous films.",1335225600,,475,4.21978021978022

3589056,5,B001FT4LTQ,"My grandson LOVES The Land Before Time.  The original one was best, and I'm not crazy about the songs, but they are cute and some have a good message.  I purchased two c.d.'s, and one of them, ""Chomper"" is the wrong color.  He is blue and should be purple, or the other way around.  My grandson almost drove me crazy fussing about him being the wrong color.  He would ask me to ""take that one out and put the other one in.""  It was very important to him that the characters remained the same color.  Amazing what a 3 year old will notice.",1308700800,4,538,4.165048543689321
3589057,5,B001FT4LTQ,My 4 year old daughter can't get enough of these 4 episodes and my 6 year old son hasn't gotten bored with them either.  We are happy it's a frequent flyer in our DVD player b/c the programs are wholesome and fun.,1303257600,,213,4.071428571428571
3589058,5,B001FT4LTQ,"The Land Before Time Friends Forever DVD is perfect because it is 4 short episodes based on the popular movie that goes way back to my oldest child.  It's a family favorite.  The dinosaurs are friendly and the episodes teach children important lessons about friends and caring.  I like that they are short so we can even say ""Ok, after this one we take a bath"" instead of fighting because it's a long movie and the children don't want to leave the movie half way through it.  It's also great for short car rides because it keeps them entertained and I don't worry about the expense of this DVD because it is so reasonable - especially for all the enjoyment that the kids get out of it.  The animation is very colorful and the kids don't get scared when veiwing it.",1300579200,,764,4.390070921985815
3589059,5,B001FT4LTQ,"Our 2 year old is absolutely crazy for this DVD.  It usually takes him a few viewings to get into a DVD, but he was enthralled with this show right away.  He loves dinosaurs and the songs make him bob his head.

The songs on the show are catchy and the stories are simple and age appropriate--if he's not bobbing his head to the music, he's grinning at the screen.  Something about this show makes him so happy.  Sometimes I wonder if it's chock full of subliminal messages because it's just that engaging for him.

As a point of reference, he also loves ""Go Diego Go"" and ""Dinosaur Train"" (PBS) as well as ""Shrek"" (all three) but this is, hands down, his favorite.  He asks to watch it every day.  Seriously.  Every.  Day.  It's a mixed blessing at this point, but I'm happy when he's happy.  We only get to watch one show a day when he's been good, so it's a testament to how much he likes it that he usually chooses this one.",1292112000,,928,4.24
