2257115,5,B00082ZSAM,"What a crazy opera!  The plot is convoluted and almost meaningless. The updating from early Lombardy to 1950's Italy with Kings and Dukes transformed into mafioso produces some odd moments as when a letter from the Huns is mentioned and when one character is sent to the dungeon, but then this is Handel and you're not getting this for the plot.  What you have is what matters - music that is well played, well sung and well acted in superb sound. And the action on stage held my attention.",1116201600,15,490,4.49438202247191
8055479,5,B00082ZSAM,"There are intense emotions here, communicated directly and without embellishments. The stage has the feel of a damp November night, the costumes are dark, the lighting harsh, and the choreography unadorned.  No effort is made to beautify the scene with pretty colors, elegance, or glamour. The bells and whistles of a top-notch opera house are used not to produce a pleasing visual extravaganza but to frame the human drama that is at the heart of Rodelinda. The music has to carry the punch and it delivers. The more I watch, the more it persuades.

Dorothea Roschmann is a force of nature in the title role; her take-no-prisoners Rodelinda alone makes the DVD worth getting. The strength of the overall dramatic conception was brought home to me by Umberto Chiummo as Garibaldo. In the Glyndebourne production, which is highly polished, he is a competent sidekick. Here he is an essential presence, and this is because the stage direction nails the character. Granted, Brian Large's close-up camerawork can be jarring as it does not always mesh with the stage. If emotional force is what you want from opera though, and if you do not need a sugary ending, go for this version.",1349222400,2,1178,4.885
8055480,5,B00082ZSAM,"This production updates the story to the 1930s. Rather than medieval chiefdoms, the kings (and queens) here are mafiosa types. The concept works, particularly the ending, where the use of the silent character of Rodelinda and Bertarido's son indicates the ultimate futility of all the grabs for power that happen in the course of the opera. Sets and costumes are mostly very dark; at times all one sees on stage are the singers' faces.

The singing ranges from good to wonderful. The clear star here is Dorothea Roschmann as Rodelinda - the emotional intensity that she brings to this part is phenomenal. She's riveting. And, of course, she sounds lovely. Her voice is a little darker and heavier than is typically used for a part like this, but it works. This Rodelinda is not a person to be messed with.

Michael Chance (Bertarido) is no Andreas Scholl, but he sounds good enough, and throws himself into the character very convincingly. The ""Io t'abbraccio"" duet at the end of act II is very affecting - this is great singing and acting.

Felicity Palmer's Eduige is great - an aging floozy with a little bit of a drinking problem who, nevertheless, comes through for her brother and sister-in-law in the end. Her voice shows some wear, but both pitch and ornamentation are infallibly accurate.

Paul Nilon's voice is not one I like (the sound is rather thin, and the vibrato quite fast) but the portrayal of Grimoaldo as the would-be player who ultimately discovers that the life of a kingpin is not for him is right on.

On the whole this is one of those non-traditional stagings that works startlingly well; the singing and acting are both high quality -- definitely worth it.",1318896000,3,1682,4.766323024054983
8055481,3,B00082ZSAM,"How do I know that the performance is staged in Germany?  The answer is simple - in the first 10 minutes of the opera we already see the gun!  And this time it is a machine gun - well, it's Munich.

This opera was a great success when premiered in 1725;  it is useful to remember that the following was the starry cast:

Rodelinda - Cuzzoni (soprano)
Bertarido - Senesino (alto)
Grimoaldo - Francesco Borosini (tenor)

There are two main impressions of this performance - the first is the quality of female singers, which is very good - Rodelinda (Dorothea Roschmann) is absolutely ravishing and Eguide (Felicity Palmer)  is excellent, too.  Rodelinda delivers great sound and performance in ""Spietati, io vi giurai"", and she is simply mesmerizing in ""Ritorna, o cara e dolce mio Tesoro"".  In this last one, I could also hear ""Deh vieni alla finestra"" from Don Giovanni, perhaps Mozart was influenced by this melody.  Roschmann's performance is formidable, and perhaps she could compare to Cuzzoni, if we only knew for true how the legendary prima donna sang almost 300 years ago.

However, when it comes to male roles, especially of Bertarido and Unulfo, both countertenors, there could be no doubt that we would never hear of Senesino if he sang as poorly as Michael Chance.  Mr. Chance was acceptable in ""Dove sei, amato bene?"", although if one listens to some other recordings, in particular by Andreas Scholl of the same piece, one can clearly hear the inferiority of Mr. Chance's performance.  What's worse is that he completely ruined  ""Vivi, tiranno"" - clearly he struggled with this showpiece aria, composed exclusively for Senesino to demonstrate his vocal agility and virtuosity; sadly, there is no sprezzatura in Mr. Chance performance; apparently he would never attain the laurels of Senesino.

Unulfo (Christopher Robson) was equally disappointing. His  voice was just as unnatural and straining as that of aforementioned Bertarido (Michael Chance); Unulfo's arias  ""Sono I colpi della sorte"" and his main one ""Un zeffiro spiro"" were sung with visible and considerable effort.

I think the director wanted to use males for both Bertarido and Unulfo roles;  but in an opera the quality of singing should have the primary importance, and some great female mezzo or alto would do so much better with their natural flowing voices;  it was not very enjoyable to hear these male voices on the verge of cracking; the resulting sound was poor.

One can compare this performance with the sound of Rodelinda CD with Marijana Mijanovic as Bertarido and Marie-Nicole Lemieux as Unulfo, a recording under a baton of Alan Curtis;  these female singers deliver very powerful natural sound;  but on that CD their voices are somewhat low to my taste.  Again, so far I found Andreas Scholl as a perfect Bertarido; I have a recoding of the same role with Drew Minter, but although he is better than Michael Chance, he still yields to the refinement of Andreas Scholl in this role.

As for Grimoaldo (Paul Nilon, tenor) and Garibaldo (Umberto Chiummo, baritone), both were very good.

The production itself was quite stylish; I appreciated the restrain and absence of fashionable vulgarity that often permeats many modern performances.  I was surprised to learn form the booklet that the staging was supposed to be of Mafia set;  to me, these people looked perfectly German, in both their appearance and body language, and the ladies were typical Fraus, not Signore.  I actually thought that they tried to depict Berlin in 1930s; Palermo was not there in any spirit.  In terms of DVD quality, it is excellent, widescreen and with ample volume.

Despite my critique, I recommend this performance, it is still above average, and deserves to be seen/listened to.  It is great to know that Handel Renaissance has been a success, partially due to the efforts  of General Director of the Bavarian State Opera (Bayerische Staastsoper)Sir Peter Jonas, who was responsible for bringing this Rodelinda to life in 2003.",1274400000,3,4002,4.996978851963746
8055482,2,B00082ZSAM,"Disappointing, unfortunately.  I don't know who decided to stage this between mafiosi, but it's hard to care about which gangster ends up prevailing in a situation like that.  The staging had some potential, but was just too self-conscious -- and there shouldn't even BE cinematography, pickup shots(!!!), or cross-cut camera angles in an opera.  The camera was FAR too intrusive; three-camera sitcom with occasional medium shots is fine for most staged operas, including this one.  Whoever decided to use the camera in an artsy way should have been vetoed with extreme prejudice.  The performers suffered greatly from the closeups.  Closeups are completely inappropriate when the people on stage are acting to reach the cheap seats; they also cut off all large-area staging until everyone looks like they are staring into nothing while singing.  Many times, I couldn't even tell where the performers were standing relative to one another.

Costuming in this era could have been better; I've seen other plays moved to this time period and done well, including a very good ""Othello"" by the San Diego Women's Rep company.  Here, though ... Michael Chance is not by any means a bad-looking man, and while they were going for a more ""realistic"" look, they should still have costumed him as an unfairly put-upon hero and not a wood-alcohol soaked bum.  There was just no reason for that.

The ONLY good thing about this, thank God, is the singing.  Chance's falsetto isn't at the Scholl or Daniels level, but his da capos are wonderfully inventive and daring.  The other voices were all excellent, especially Paul Nilon, who is just the sort of ringing clear tenor I'd love to hear in a high Rossini role or as Mario Cavaradossi.  GORGEOUS voice.

If only the absurdly artsy staging didn't swamp them all ...  Buy this to listen to it.  It's worth ripping the audio and playing that alone.",1240876800,,1884,4.93015873015873
8055483,4,B00082ZSAM,"In my mind, I went back and forth on the number of stars I would deduct from my ranking.

Firstly, the singing and acting is for the most part excellent. The only partial exception is  Christopher Robson in the role of Unulfo: I agree with another reviewer that he has problematic singing coupled with excellent characterization. I went for this production because I had seen Roschmann in another production; she does not disappoint here.

I did not mind the story being updated to a gang war in the early part of the 1900s: after all, much ancient politics was little better than struggles for power over ""means of production"" to wealth via extortion and con games.

So while only 4 stars? In the middle of the third act, I realized I was bored. I was waiting for Handel (or at least his librettist) to wrap up the story. Perhaps a better staging would have kept the interest alive. The sets were parsimonious, which is not always bad, but in this staging results a measure of tedium.

Perhaps this is one of those operas that is best heard, and not seen.",1232323200,5,1056,4.536842105263158
8055484,5,B00082ZSAM,"I love this opera, and recordings of it are in short supply, so I actually bought this DVD (and the Glyndebourne one as well) just to hear some different renditions of this wonderful music.  Both DVDs are good, but Roschmann's singing is a revelation!  Anna Caterina Antonacci, on Glyndebourne's DVD, is a bit stretched by the tessitura of the part, but Roschmann has the coloratura, volume, and luminous shimmering tone that sets her apart from any other voice I have heard in the role.  Her acting is also less stilted, although I think that has more to do with the productions they are in (the Glyndebourne is set in a sort of 1920's silent film Hollywood milieu).  The Glyndebourne production is better overall, and better cast overall (Scholl is much better than Chance is here), but this one is still essential.  The production here (Dir. David Alden) is really not THAT bad, and he doesn't betray the basic plot or emotions that the libretto calls for, but it is just a little silly sometimes (Garibaldo forces Bertarido into the trunk of a car after the duet ""Io t'abraccio"").  This silliness never touches Roschmann, however, who Alden respects and gives dignified stage direction.  Anyway, even if the production were awful, it would still merit five stars for Roschmann's Rodelinda recorded in CD quality sound.

Felicity Palmer's singing of Eduige's arias is exciting, and she acts the part well, especially given some of the silly stage business (she seems to have a sort of violent relationship with Garibaldo).  Chance's voice sounds very weak and quiet to me, especially in comparison to Palmer and Roschmann, but he acts very well and sings with style.  Alden has him play the part as some kind of middle aged mafia don who is ""on the run"" for the moment, and he carries out some difficult stage business well (""con rauco marmorio"" in Act two becomes a drunken lament as he slowly dances with a bottle in one hand--he is drowning his sorrows over Rodelinda's supposed infidelity...anyway, it's a difficult little piece of business that he pulls off well).  Chiummo's Garibaldo is excellent on both the Glyndebourne DVD and this one.  He is an enthusiastic performer who seems to love this role.

Again, any fan of this opera should get this DVD if only for the audio track. It is worth 5 stars for the musical side alone.",1197590400,2,2338,4.800498753117207
8055485,3,B00082ZSAM,"The music of Rodelinda is glorious.  The singers are great, I particularly liked the dramatic, almost... verista!!! :) , performance of Dorothea Roschmann and the delicate voice of Michael Chance.  The interpretative (from the musical standpoint) aspects of this Rodelinda are great too. Yes Mr (or Mrs.)Didden (from Pennsilvania) it is Eurotrash at its best, I agree.  But do not forget that it is a David Alden's production after all.  However, it is not the worse attempt of this british stage director to ruin a Handel's opera.  If you did not like this Rodelinda keep away from his other stagings of Ariodante (ENO) and Rinaldo (Munich?) otherwise you will be horrified!.  I also hate his stage productions and I think the guy (David Alden) should be in jail or sued by Handel's heirs, but this Rodelinda is OK among his other disgraces.  A bit too dark to my taste though.  Anyway, after watching so many Eurotrash productions of Handel's operas (it seems that this is the most common way of staging them in Europe these days) I have developed a sort of inmune system (or thick skin) that allows me to enjoy the music and the musicians and forget everything else.
By the way, about the comparisson Mrs. Didden makes between Glyndebourne and Munich's Bertarido's interpreters I cannot disagree more.  I think Michael Chance is far more superior to Andreas Scholl in this role. The rendering of his fantastic second act aria ""Con rauco mormorio"" is unbeatable. He really acts the delicate dialog between the voice and the orchestra whereas Andreas Scholl does not seem to feel what he is singing.  By the way do not get me wrong, I am a big fan of Andreas Scholl but think I should be fair here.",1186531200,4,1699,4.7482993197278915
8055486,5,B00082ZSAM,"I agree for the most part with the reviewer from Carlisle, PA. Having had a chance also to view and listen to the Glyndebourne DVD published by Kultur, I definitely prefer the Munich opera performance. Why? There are 2 main reasons: First and perhaps most importantly, the sound of the music on this DVD is very warm and much more brilliant than that of the Glyndebourne DVD. This may be due to different recording techniques and therefore be unrelated to the quality of the musicians. In fact, the singers in the Glyndebourne performances (especially Anna Antonacci and Andreas Scholl as Queen and rightful King) appear at least as good artistically as their Munich counterparts (Dorothea Roschmann and Michael Chance).  Listening to the Munich performance, you feel as though you are in a theater auditorium. I don't have this feeling at all when playing the other DVD. Of course, one needs a high quality stereo system to appreciate the differences.  Second, I like the more dramatic and passionate singing and playing of the Munich rendition. Rodelinda is a highly dramatic Italian opera (""dramma per musica""), and the great difference in this respect between the two performances becomes apparent as early as in Rodelinda's first aria at the beginning of Act 1. Perhaps Verdi himself would have approved of this performance!

I disagree with the above reviewer on some minor points. With the aid of subtitles (provided in English, German, Italian, and Japanese), the plot does make sense, and in fact is quite interesting. Christopher Robson sings and plays his somewhat tricky dramatic role very well. What I do not like in the Munich performance is the staging but viewed against the overall quality of the DVD, this is not a major flaw.",1137715200,20,1744,4.986254295532646
8055487,5,B00082ZSAM,"AN EXCITING PRODUCTION WITH HIGH QUALITY DRAMA AND OUTSTANDING SINGERS!

'Rodelinda' was first performed in the Haymarket Theater on February 13, 1725 (ten days before Handel's 40th birthday).  The success was supposed to have been ecstatic, and his fame increased,  He stood at the height of his art as an opera composer.

David Alden has staged Handel's hymn to women's love in time of battle in a modern setting.  He stages it somewhere in Italy in the 50's and turns it into a story of an occurrence in the Mafia. To my mind the story is not as important as the production itself.

When viewing this production we see big spaces (somewhat gloomy), long vistas, endless walls of imprisoning brick, that reduces the human characters fo small figures, fighting the powers of oppression and tyranny that threatens to overwhelm them at any moment. Huge statues of 'the boss' dominate the square and the population cowering unseen behind endless dark tenement windows.  We are looking at a 1950's urban streetscape with the characters dressed in dark Mafioso type suits, and calf-length dreary dresses.

  There are 7 characters one of whom is a young boy who really is only a ""prop""; the son of the male lead Michael Chance, who plays Bertarido, and does it gloriously with his wonderful countertenor voice and his great dramatic sense. He plays the role of the tragic exile returning to his country incognito to regain what has been taken away from him: namely his wife and son and country.

Dorthea Roschmann in the role of the captive wife who has been taken over by the enemy, sings her songs with heavy drama, sometimes TOO heavy for Handel's style.  She is at her best in the arias that display contempt and anger.

Paul Nilon,tenor, as Grimoaldo, shows that he is really a great ""Handelian"" performer  he sings with power, elegance and restraint.

I was particularly impressed with Felicity Palmer's role as Bertarido's sister who featured in his exile from his position of power. She has been much maligned by some reviewers of this opera, but I simply can't agree with their opinions.

The only weak voice in the opera was Christopher Robson (also a countertenor)in the role of Unulfo. Dramatically he projected his character well, but his singing is really ""poor"". However, he had a good sense of the characterizaion that really 'saved the day' for him.

Umberto Chiummo(bass) as Garibaldo, was a bit rough vocally, but 'pulled it off' dramatically and made the perfect 'bad guy'.

""For the worst possible happening in a Mafia milieu, there is , by the way, a word from the music vocabulary: that is, when someone 'sings'.  Well, under Ivor Bolton the Mafioso have sung.  And, to be sure, as beautifully as never before"".",1137196800,11,2730,4.855291576673866
8055488,3,B00082ZSAM,"I watched my copy of this production after I had seen a pirated copy of the Glyndebourne production and listened to the new cd set conducted by Alan Curtis.  I also have the older LP set on Westminster, very admirably sung, and the cd set of the older still production with Sutherland etc. which I am going to listen to, soon.  If this dvd were the only game in town, then I would advise the prospective viewer to go for it.  However, with the announced dvd version from Glyndebourne, one  would be advised to wait and watch a much better staging, with in most cases superior singing.  Like the Munich production, the British  is set in twentieth century, but the era seems closer to the twenties than the Munich's thirty's fascist Italy, which conceit is a bit strained anyway. Too bad we do not, and probably will not, have the new Met production with Fleming and Daniels; THAT would probably put these out of contention, but the British production is highly satisfactory in staging and singing, and above all, acting. The title role is well sung by both ladies, a bit more tremulously by Roschmann, but she sings expressively and with great beauty. With her stage sister, Eduige, the honors must go to Louise Winter, who chews up the scenery, but with much inuendo and dynamics. Felicity Palmer for Munich is fine but seems old and blowsy, the tone a bit frayed and doesn't seem to be as believable a seductress.  The villan, Garibaldo, is sung in BOTH productions by Umberto Chiumo, who does well in both houses, looking and acting the part to a ""t"", but Munich's director has him acting the Nazi thug more strenuously, seeming to be overdone to make a point.  The userper, Grimoaldo, is better taken by Kurt Streit, who sings very well and looks more commanding in the part, but Munich's Paul Nilon sings well and acts well, but Streit is a little more believable.  Both boy roles are fine, as it is not a sung role anyway, but the younger boy for the Brits is more creditably vulnerable.  I have left the two counter-tenor roles for last, because it here the the British production is noticeably superior: interestingly, the British have a German countertenor, and the Germans have a British one.  Andras Scholl is wonderful in tonal beauty and acting, while Michael Chance is, like Palmer, a bit over the hill.  His voice is weaker and not as varied in expression. The other countertenors are not contested; Christopher Robson for Munich is weak and hooty, sounding like a bad ""Dame Edna"" or Monty Python drag, while the British singer is better and not played as caricature.

  Of the two stagings, if you like your up-datings eurotrashy, like many other productions coming out of Germany and sometimes England, than this is for you.  I found it repugnant, hard to understand what they are driving at, stupid.  If other viewers found it hard to understand what is going on in the Munich version, I can sympathize.  The dramaturgy is more understandable and believable at Glyndebourne.  Of COURSE opera plots are silly and implausible, but the British make a much greater case for character motivation and interaction.  When the Munich production has the king saying he can't find the proffered sword for his escape because of the darkness, and is doing so in full stage light, common sense takes a backroad, as it does at many other points in this staging. If you haven't bought a version of this yet wait for the Glyndebourne, due at summer's end.  If you bought the Munich and are unsatisfied, as you SHOULD be, treat yourself to a MUCH finer representation of Handel's wonderful masterpiece.  Not incidentally, the music is glorious and deserves our patient attention.

  As a postscript, both orchestras and conductors are fine; Mr. Bolton has a larger, more traditional size orchestra, while Mr. Christie does, as always, a superb job with his period group, Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.  Enlightenment indeed!",1122508800,22,3932,4.7881481481481485
