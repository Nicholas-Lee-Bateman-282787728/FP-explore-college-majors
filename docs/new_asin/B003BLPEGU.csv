4106986,3,B003BLPEGU,"Great quality dvd. The Cover art is disappointing because it is from the wrong season. There are no extras really. But I am glad
that it is out on dvd.",1400457600,,151,4.066666666666666
4106987,4,B003BLPEGU,"Does anyone know where I can buy this?  I know they have all 4 seasons on HULU...but I'd love to have the entire series on DVD.

Seriously, it seems you can buy almost anything else on DVD....why not this?",1295222400,3,205,4.230769230769231
4106988,5,B003BLPEGU,I worked on crew for this show and have been waiting over 10 years for this series to come out on DVD.  It was released briefly then was pulled.  Please MGM and Amazon get this straightened out so we can order.  This is almost 1 year I've been waiting now and would appreciate you releasing this DVD on Demand product.,1292544000,11,318,4.266666666666667
4106989,1,B003BLPEGU,"It's bad enough that these are only being manufactured on demand, but geez--it would be nice if MGM's current employees could have watched an episode and realized that the cast picture on the minimally illustrated cover was from the second season!  Neither Brian Wimmer or Colleen Flynn are pictured--the photo they used is of second-season stars Elizabeth Morehead, Whip Hubley, and Jessica Alba--who seems to be the only person they were focused on when they were flipping through studio press kits for the series.  (Since Hubley is the only one of the five who stuck around for the third and fourth seasons, I guess those were easy to eliminate from contention.)",1286409600,11,665,4.981981981981982
4106990,5,B003BLPEGU,"I was happy to locate this hard-to-find title on DVD, and happier still when it arrived quickly. Quality met expectations. I had been searching for this title off-and-on for quite awhile with no success, so this was a terrific find for us. This series is a KEEPER in our video library. The MOD process is a great way to make many more titles available that otherwise wouldn't be. Thumbs up to Amazon and MOD!",1279497600,10,408,4.527027027027027

8393759,4,B003BLPEGU,"I have the whole series from season one to four so I'll review them all here. Not many will agree with me, but I like this remake of Flipper better than the original. In this show, Flipper is a friend and he lives in the wild. In the 60s version he was Sandy and Bud's pet. Dolphins aren't pets! So that's one thing, and I like the people characters better too. Flipper has more human friends than just two boys. The only thing I didn't like though, that's why it has four stars, some episodes didn't have much Flipper in it. They were too much about the people and Flipper wasn't involved much. But I still enjoyed the show, I am a huge dolphin fan.",1478044800,,650,4.208
8393760,5,B003BLPEGU,"Childhood nostalgia-This show was the seed to my dreams!  I am so thankful that I can treasure this show at home whenever I want.  I remember when they canceled this show and I had one recorded episode on a VHS. I told my mom I would cry if it was ever recorded over.  I named all of my dolls and Barbies after the characters.  Many years later the shows popped up on Hulu, and now in my DVD player.  I know I sound crazy, but this brings me joy.  Because of Flipper, I get to live this life everyday.  I have done shark research, swam with whale sharks, worked with jellies, educate the public daily on all marine species.  Everyday is a 'New Adventure'!",1468886400,,655,4.225806451612903
8393761,2,B003BLPEGU,"This is a ridiculous price for this season.  If you dropped the price in half or more, I'd consider buying it.  Even the latest seasons of current tv shows don't sell for this price.  Plus, all the other seasons of Flipper The New Adventures sell for a decent price.  Why is this so high?",1443484800,,288,4.277777777777778

8393764,1,B003BLPEGU,I'm confused about something so maybe you can explain it to me. You offer season 2 for 11$ and charge almost 57$ dollars for season 1. Does this make sense to anybody out there? Season 1 should be at a cost of 15$ at the most not 57$.,1423526400,5,234,3.8958333333333335
8393765,2,B003BLPEGU,Is it me or does there seem to be some episodes missing from season one?,1422748800,,72,3.8666666666666667
