7908076,3,B00000F9TM,"This film is loosely based on the life of a peruvian criminal and his experiences at an island prison called ""El Fronton"" -a sort of Peruvian ""Alcatraz""-. It also portraits the infamous 1986 Terroist Riot (although the real ""Gringa"" was not there at the time). Being a low budget film don't expect fancy or sophisticated explosions and special effects. If you are into ""B"" Movies with a South American touch, then this is your thing.",997488000,3,433,4.786666666666667
