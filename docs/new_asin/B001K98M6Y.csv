Jimmy a 17yr olg high school student was shrunk down to a kid and took the name conan after the auther of the sherlock holmes series.. conan (jimmy) is a brilliant detective and figures out every crime and murder he runs into... if anyone knows I was just wondering, i already own case closed season 4 but it is a different cover than this one. is it the same epsiodes???
case closed is a must buy!!! amazon plzzzz keep them coming soon  season 6 soon??",1266019200,,545,4.3431372549019605
3663959,5,B001K98M6Y,I like this series. Love how Conan (aka Jimmy)solves the cases and tells how it was done.,1251849600,,89,4.294117647058823
3663960,5,B001K98M6Y,"I enjoy this item because I like the cartoons.  I used to watch this on regular TV but when it was discontinued, I started purchasing these episodes.  They are very good and as long as they available on sale, I will be purchasing them.  I recently placed an order for the Sason Five episodes.  I am looking forward to them.",1237593600,,323,4.333333333333333
3663961,5,B001K98M6Y,"Our whole family loves the Case Closed series. This was a great set because there were many episodes that we did not get to see before. Each time, the first time through, it's always exciting to try and guess the outcome. Some of these had me stumped and my sons too. This was a birthday present for my younger son Brad; Good Pick! We're ready for Season 5!",1235347200,,357,4.264705882352941
3663962,4,B001K98M6Y,"I just got the set two days ago and each episode was great.  Conan was shown as the tone deaf person he really is and the cases were as good as their manga counterparts, but I was disappointed by the misleading label.  In the past, FUNimation has always listed episode that were one-hour long as separate episodes and played it all the way through with no breaks, when you viewed the episode (Moonlight Sonata Murder Case, Mist Goblin, and Phantom Thief 1412, as examples of what they did in earlier releases).  However, with this set they took a two-hour long episode and literally separated it into four episodes.  It obvious that it was supposed to be 2-hours because they show scenes from the entire episode each of the four times the opening came up.  Now, this does not mean that I will not continue supporting the U.S. release of the show, but I feel cheated that they did this, when the box says ""unedited/uncut"".  I'll continue supporting the U.S. release and recommending it to others, hoping that FUNimation does not do this again in the future.",1235174400,9,1056,4.650537634408602
3663963,5,B001K98M6Y,Season 4 includes episodes that never aired in the USA. I am looking forward to the March release of season 5. This is just a great traditional amine that has mystery's for all ages. This series is 500+ episodes strong and still going in japan and i hope they will continue to release them on DVD in the USA.,1235001600,3,308,4.237288135593221

3663965,5,B001K98M6Y,Love all Case Closed episodes. Just wish they were all in English so I can see them all. The subtitles to me take away from watching the episode itself and I don't want to miss anything.,1353369600,,186,4.194444444444445

3663967,5,B001K98M6Y,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas; she's a huge Case Closed fan.

She loved it, so I loved it. She says, ""It was tremendous. The mysteries gave me a shiver of scares and excitement."":-)",1331424000,,195,4.416666666666667
3663968,5,B001K98M6Y,"This season is no exception to the level of quality this fantastic series has built a reputation around.  Unfortunately, the English dub of Case Closed may very well be over with as Funimation is ceasing production. Spread the word of Case Closed! Buy the DVDs (possibly even as a gift), buy the manga, tell friends about it, and most importantly, stop uploading the episodes to YouTube (provided you are one who does so, if not, still refrain).  Regardless, this show deserves your attention and time -- the originality of episodes, blend of action and humor, and (surprisingly) strong soundtrack.  If there is one thing you can take away from this review, it's this:

SAVE CASE CLOSED!",1325203200,2,687,4.896551724137931
3663969,4,B001K98M6Y,Case Closed is one of my favorite tv shows. I love how it takes me on a journey to discover Whodunit! This season does not disappoint. Be sure to add it to your collection of Conan Edagawa's adventures!,1316390400,,202,4.342105263157895
3663970,5,B001K98M6Y,"I was originally upset because I did not want the Veridian set. I had the box sets for every other season and I wanted the cover art for the original set. The only set available right now is the Veridian. Despite the cover art  and case the set is the same. It was a very enjoyable series and was shipped right away. It is very nice. I would recommend it for anyone who likes mystery or anime. Conan reminds me of a little Sherlock Holmes and his adventures with Rachel and his friends are very fun, exciting, and leave you at the edge of your seat.",1302134400,,549,4.179245283018868
3663971,5,B001K98M6Y,"Love, love, LOVE this set!

The quality is nice & I love the series to death.

3663972,5,B001K98M6Y,"I just received this today, and I was so excited to start watching it. I took me about 11 hours to watch all of it, and let me say that it was totally worth every second. But one thing that bothered me is that this season didn't seem to have the same exciting moments the first 3 seasons had. Don't get me wrong, the season is great, its just lacking the same zing that kept you on the edge of your seat. I found myself getting on the computer a few times, and just listening to show rather than watch it, but I was still able to follow what was happening.

I now have to get the 5th season so I can spend another day dedicated to Case Closed. If your a fan of the show, then you should definately buy this season.",1278374400,4,714,3.993006993006993

8314501,4,B001K98M6Y,"My biggest issue with the subbed version of this series by funimation is that the title song is a few seconds off from the original. It's fine in the dubbed version, which is really weird. Also I really hate the dub. It sounds phoned in with no real emotion to it. However, I really love this series. It's fun and engaging, and the story stays interesting.",1370908800,,356,4.409090909090909

8314503,5,B001K98M6Y,"This is a excellent anime series for those who like mystery and detective series.  With the main character (Conan) being an up and coming great detective, yet forced to live in a young boy's body after he was forced to take some terrible new and experimental pill, the series becomes quite intriguing as the boy must now gather the clues and solve the crime in different ways since no one would likely believe a little kid.  Each episode is just so fun to watch as Conan somehow manages to gather all the clues, solve the crime, and bring the criminals to justice using several different methods.  It is also aways fun to try and figure out who committed the crime before Conan does.  Season 4 is just as great as the previous with many new and intriguing cases to solve.  It is not too violent, and it still has all of the wonderful pieces to a great mystery/detective series.",1363046400,,877,4.490566037735849
