Sellers/Buyers beware of Amazon. If I wanted to use the wording of some liberal groups, Amazon is a terrorist organization. Clearly this is not true based on how it does business practices, but Amazon holds to the same liberal views of groups who say that about Christians (falsely, I might add) just by believing what the Bible actually says! Just read the list of ""hate groups"" from the Southern Poverty Law Center and see that liberals believe anyone who believes what the Bible says is a ""hate group.""",1503792000,,896,4.824675324675325
8675299,5,B00MY2SAXG,"Cuts through the pseudoacademic nonsense.  Previous reviewer is correct.  PG-13 for a guy at a podium talking about ancient papyrus?  How ridiculous.  This may be the antidote for the contemporary confusion created as .nonbelievers who've never spent any serious time studying scripture ""discover"" the Gnostic texts, who cause young people to question the Canon.  (Asking questions is always a good thing if they're asked with a desire to learn the truth, but not if the purpose of questions is simply to muddy the waters.  If you ask ""why 66,"" then make some effort to discover the answer.).",1449360000,2,592,5.051546391752577
8675300,5,B00MY2SAXG,"I've watched this DVD several times before and it's very informative about how the Bible came to be.  There is no foul language, no violence, and nothing whatsoever sexual, so can you tell me why this DVD is PG-13?  Is that where we've come to in America that a DVD on the Christian Bible is something we need to warn our children about.  No more Amazon for me.",1424822400,2,361,4.279411764705882
