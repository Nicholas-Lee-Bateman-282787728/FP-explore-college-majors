2640726,5,B000HT3P7Y,"My daughter is three and loves all the Strawberry Shortcake DVDs.  I usually rent them from Netflix, but this one was one of her favorites so I ended up buying it.  If you have a little girl that loves to cook, this is super-cute!  The pink case even smells like strawberries- delish!",1176768000,3,284,4.423076923076923
2640727,5,B000HT3P7Y,"""Strawberry Shortcake: Cooking Up Fun"" is a berry wonderful delight for fans of Strawberry Shortcake and/or her sister Apple Dumplin'. You get two stories from the show --- ""Baby Takes the Cake"" and ""Piece of Cake.""

In ""Baby Takes the Cake,"" Apple Dumplin' is excited about the idea of helping Strawberry and her friends with cooking, but they all seem to think she's too little. When they finally give him something to do, she's put down for a nap, much to her consternation. She does fall asleep though and has a dream in which she imagines she's their age --- and they're all babies! This episode has two fun songs, both performed by Apple Dumplin', and some great cooking lessons and fun humor.

The second story finds Strawberry and her friends deciding to create their very own cooking show, to be broadcast throughout Strawberry Land. Everybody has their own ideas for the show, but they learn that sometimes not everyone can be the star, at least not all at once.

This is another winning installment in the ""Strawberry Shortcake"" series. The characters and songs are generally cheery and fun, the animation is pleasing for the eyes and the lessons are useful and generally age-appropriate. The DVD comes with a bonus music video --- ""The Cooking Show,"" as well as a free cookbook and sticker set.",1169078400,13,1306,4.795555555555556
2640728,5,B000HT3P7Y,"This was a very cute movie both my neice (3 1/2yr) and I really enjoye this movie. It has some catchy little songs that you will find yourself singing throught the day...even if you don't want to. This video shares fun recipes that your daughter will want to make with you more than likely because it's Strawberry's  and the insert has 2 printed out recipes. This movie isn't all about cooking. It has a story where Apple Dumplin has a dream that she is Strawberry's age and Strawberry and all of her friend become the babies and she has to ""take care"" of them. My neice really enjoyed that story and she was really excited that all of Strawberry's friends were back for this movie since they were no where to be found in the Berry Fairy Tales! Your little one will be pleased with this movie.",1164153600,14,793,4.394557823129252
2640749,5,B000HT3P7Y,"My 2.5 year old daughter begs to watch this every day.  Not only is the story entertaining, but educational and inspiring to fledgling cooks!",1368057600,,141,4.875
2640750,4,B000HT3P7Y,"My daughter loves this DVD.  Includes baking recipes.  Would be fun to give as a gift with cookie cutters, spatula, sprinkles, etc. Great for ages 3-7.",1342396800,,151,4.769230769230769
2640751,2,B000HT3P7Y,"My daughter chose this one not only for the cooking storyline but also for the stickers as written on the front cover of the DVD only to find they were not included. Aside from that she likes it.

I however find it insipid and the songs grating. The story was terrible and the attitude that babies are a pain and big girls are great disgusting. On top of that, the food that was cooked is not even slightly healthy. I know they are all named after desserts so it should have been a tip off, but I would have thought that surely healthy eating would be a part of the message. I won't be buying my daughter another Strawberry Shortcake DVD.",1234137600,3,638,4.2727272727272725
2640752,3,B000HT3P7Y,"My two year old loves ""Strawberry Cupcake"" as she calls her.  This dvd didn't hold her interest near as much as some of the others in this series.  I reccomend ""Meet Strawberry Shortcake"" and the one about find Spring.  Those two are watched frequently at our house, and she can't get enough of the songs on those.",1225843200,3,314,4.473684210526316
2640753,5,B000HT3P7Y,"My two-year old daughter really identifies with Apple Dumplin' in this one.  Since she's the youngest of 4 kids and is often left out of the older kids' activities, she loves Apple Dumplin's songs ""I'm Not Too Little"" and ""Big Like Me"" and we often watch just the first part of the DVD for those two songs.  I agree with all the other reviews, too.  It's a great video.",1218844800,5,369,4.318840579710145

2640756,5,B000HT3P7Y,"I bought this for my daughter, who was 3 years old at the time.  She LOVES it!  She's now 4, and still watches it all the time.  She never tires of this one, or the few others that we have.  The songs are cute, and the stories are great.

I love that this particular DVD comes with a mini cookbook, as I like to have my daughter cook with me.  The only thing that my daughter and I have made out of it was the pumpkin pie, and it was absolutely THE BEST pumpkin pie I've ever had.",1193961600,4,480,3.8469387755102042

2640758,5,B000HT3P7Y,"I bought this item for my daughter's 4th birthday since she is starting to be interested in Strawberry Shortcake and she loves it!

It is cute and entertaining and teaches them values and how to cook.

She may be too young to actually cook right now but she is learning basic instructions for her future.

If your child likes Strawberry Shortcake, then this is a great dvd for them to watch.",1179187200,,391,4.47887323943662
