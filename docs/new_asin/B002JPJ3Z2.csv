8371573,2,B002JPJ3Z2,I bought this DVD because every year my 8th grade English/Literature students read The Circuit and Breaking Through by Francisco Jimenez and I was looking for a documentary that showed what life was like for a laborer. There are no videos available that depict what life is like traveling the circuit looking for crops to pick. This was the closest I found to the subject. It depicts Jamaican workers in the east coast and there is a short piece showing what it is like for a Mexican Immigrant out of work and down on his luck. Not exactly what I was looking for but I used the short pieces in between my lecture and the end interview with the director was interesting. I am not sure if my students got anything out of it. Not terribly memorable. I think the title is a bit misleading...Si Se Puede implies more of a Latino influence in the videos and there wasn't much of that.,1276387200,5,878,4.425925925925926
