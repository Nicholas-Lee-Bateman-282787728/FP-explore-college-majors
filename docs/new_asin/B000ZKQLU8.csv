3042582,4,B000ZKQLU8,Quite unsettling for a budget film.  Makes an effective transition from odd to seriously creepy.  The couple's macro-dysfunction is believable and drives the suspense:  grief can fragment beyond repair.  Economy of blood and violence works for this tale; the film leaves you thinking.

3042583,3,B000ZKQLU8,"Although there's more than a little bit of ""Misery"" in this movie, it offers some novel observations and characters.

The protagonist is a sensitive young man who likes to watch people - at work, through their windows, even as he gains access and hides inside their very homes. However, you might soon begin to suspect that this young man is not a typical peeping Tom. That phrase carries connotations of sexual predation, whereas this young man is motivated more by an intense authorial interest in observing the details of other people's lives. Rather than having fictional TV sit-com characters projected into his home, he has chosen to go out and project himself into the homes of real-life people. This is in and of itself an almost refreshing trait. It's something we rarely see in movies - someone who's not comically self-absorbed, but who's actually interested in OTHER people.

Then this movie turns the tables in others ways. We begin to fear that the young man, who might ordinarily be considered a dangerous stalker, is actually the one in danger here. He enters and is caught in the home of one couple grieving over the loss of their son. At first, it appears this couple will make just a brief, benign connection with the young man who looks so uncannily like their lost son. But then things begin to turn dark. And the descent into madness starts. The principal actors are well cast for the parts they play in this derangement.

The Director's commentary is a little flat, and unless you have a lot of extra time, you can probably skip it. The movie stands chillingly on its own.",1215302400,10,1595,4.73021582733813

8235841,5,B000ZKQLU8,"Excellent creative take on loss and grief--from both sides of the tragedy--a son losing his parents and parents losing their son. Leave it to the foil to save the day: The classic ditsy cute girl dripping with colorful scarves and jewelry, who's got a disorder of her own, to follow the young man's trail and rescue him from the brink of death. At the same time the sensible rational husband finally takes command of his wife and pulls her back from hopeless insanity. Bravo!",1526860800,,475,4.666666666666667
8235842,3,B000ZKQLU8,"Well made with good acting, some great acting.
Some spoilers: There is a guilt-ridden, depressed, young man who watches other peoples' lives. He wants to be part of a family. Well, he meets a couple in mourning who would want their son back. And, he looks just like their son. Great! What could possibly go wrong?
(I don't like it when characters talk to themselves out loud using complete sentences for an extended time. The wife did that while getting a slice of birthday cake so Timmy would remember them. She explained it a little to her husband later, so maybe she could've spoken less to herself while she was doing it?)
I would love to watch a new ending that shows Alex going back to the house.",1526083200,,702,4.4921875
8235843,5,B000ZKQLU8,"First off, this review concerns the DVD release of Inside, not the film itself. This is one of those films you will either really like or really wish you hadn't watched. I enjoyed it, but you may well find it repellent. Before buying this one, I do recommend that you read a variety of positive and negative reviews to give yourself some perspective on how this one goes, possibly even including spoiler reviews. On to the DVD and relevant issues....

I gave this five stars because the film and the original DVD release of the film are, in my opinion, high quality. Of course, I enjoyed the film, but the stars are for the DVD picture quality, within the limitations of a budget DVD, distributed by a budget vendor, Echo Bridge. The picture quality is NOT up to the standard of what most would consider to be the best DVD has to offer, Sony, but it is quite decent and is certainly far above the quality of a multi-film single DVD release. The sound was perfectly adequate and, given that the film is not available on Blu-ray, this is the best option.

Now, a warning. This release is a PRESSED DISC release, an official, multi-printed, typical DVD release. There are DVD-R copies floating around and some sellers are sending them out as ""new"" or ""like new"" copies. Be sure to check your disc and, if it is a DVD-R, exchange it quickly. This disc was never released as an MOD or manufactured on demand disc and should not be a DVD-R.

Good luck with your purchase and, if you buy this one, I hope you enjoy it.",1524873600,2,1511,4.447653429602888
8235844,2,B000ZKQLU8,"For those of you missed ""Misery"" we have a watered down version. Alex (Nicholas D'Agosto) is a voyeur and not a very good one. He gets caught by a couple while in their house. They believe Alex is their dead son Timmy who has come back to them as he is held prisoner after his accident.

Started out good with Alex approaching Crispin Glover type of creeper. Leighton Meester added a perky klepto character that was for the most part wasted. This is a film that is available on multi-packs which may be the best way to buy this one.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",1519344000,2,566,4.330188679245283
8235845,2,B000ZKQLU8,"It started out okay, but then it wouldn't end. I wanted to scream at the screen, ""Why won't you end?"" It's just too long. Editing could have tightened it up a bit.",1502496000,,163,4.125
8235846,3,B000ZKQLU8,This was pretty creepy... The ending was just okay though...,1461110400,2,60,5.1
8235847,5,B000ZKQLU8,I loved this!!! This movie was put together very well and the acting was great! I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes suspenseful thrillers.,1389139200,,158,4.888888888888889
8235848,2,B000ZKQLU8,"I give this movie 2 stars out of 5 because it was an absurd concept to start with, and the acting was terrible. No suspense, no interest in the characters, just stupid. Don't waste your time on this one.",1381881600,,203,4.230769230769231
8235849,4,B000ZKQLU8,"But it borrows heavily from other films, and without shame!

As already said in other reviews, about 60% of this film will remind you of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Misery/dp/0792846443/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Misery</a>,and that is due to the stalker/ captive theme, and the hurt legs.

Another 30% of the film reminded me of the grieving theme presented far better in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lake-Mungo/dp/B00344EAM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lake Mungo</a>. In lake Mungo, the entering other people's homes and watching them is also present.

The final 10% is this film's own. It's low budget, but with the solid acting, you don't notice. The only downfall was Leighton Meesler, who spoke so fast in some parts she was difficult to understand. Plus, there was alot of the f bomb being dropped from her mouth.

But it's definitely worth a creepy sitting!",1319414400,5,958,6.403100775193798
8235850,2,B000ZKQLU8,"Inside (Jeff Mahler, 2006)

This was one of those cases of marketing gone horribly, horribly wrong. I originally heard this was a psychological horror film. Well, I guess you can call it that, if you turn your head and squint, but what it really is is a Lifetime Original Movie; there's not even anything to distinguish it from your basic made-for-TV flick. (For all I know, it is a Lifetime Original Movie.)

Alex (Heroes' Nicholas D'Agosto) is a bored library aide who gets his kicks by breaking into the houses of library patrons and spying on their lives with his friend Josie (Gossip Girl's Leighton Meester). One day, he breaks into the house of Alice and Mark Smith (respectively, An American Town's Cheryl White and The Coverup's Kevin Kilner), but when they discover him, their reaction is not at all what he expects; they exclaim that he's the spitting image of their dead child, and treat him like a member of the family. All well and good until they start insisting that he stay...

It might not have been so bad had it not been as painfully predictable as it is; I've been wondering on and off if Mahler, who also wrote the screenplay, had watched the Korean film Acacia a few times just before writing this. (One of the big plot twists seems to be  either an homage or a ripoff, depending on your point of view.) The acting is competent, at least, and the film is miles better than the 2007 French film of the same name (entirely unrelated save the title), but every time it gets a chance to dissolve into sappy silliness, it seizes the opportunity, and that gets annoying after, say, ten minutes. **",1263600000,6,1614,4.57439446366782
