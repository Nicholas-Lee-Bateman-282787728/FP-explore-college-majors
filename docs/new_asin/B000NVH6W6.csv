8181687,5,B000NVH6W6,"I have loved this movie for years and especially show it to children, including my own granddaughter. There are so many values it explores, like what makes a family, how love can conquer fear, and how trust is never to be given lightly. The two orphans consider that it is the world against them, until a lonely widow who feels she still has value enters their lives. While visiting a museum wit his sister, the boy J J imagines himself as a knight, who pledges to protect his sister at all costs. Little does he knew he will have a chance to prove himself in a different, but perilous situation.
 This movie may be dated. There is a very young Brooke Shields as a minor character. But the sentiments are honest and Ruth Gordon is great as Mrs Miller who offers the children new hope.",1391299200,,784,4.406896551724138
8181688,5,B000NVH6W6,The condition of the VHS tape was as described and the movie is just as wonderful as I remembered.  It was fun sharing it with another generation.,1385251200,,146,4.407407407407407
8181689,5,B000NVH6W6,"While the movie is dated and somewhat naive, it is still an endearing story of how Central Park was able to bring together a homeless brother and sister, with a lonely but loving elderly woman, longing for ""family"" to be in her life again.

There are beautiful scenes filmed all over the Park, and for native New Yorkers (ex or current), and for those who have simply visited the city and Park at some time, the movie is a reminder of how special and unique Central Park is.",1332115200,,474,4.386363636363637
8181690,4,B000NVH6W6,"Let's get this movie on DVD. I remember this one as a kid my self. As one who was fascinated with Tree Houses and Scooters, this was an inspiration to me. I'd love for my children to see this one.",1282867200,2,196,3.925
8181691,3,B000NVH6W6,"I loved the book, and remember being excited to rush home and watch this ABC Afterschool Special.  Although the story was tampered with (adding a younger sister), it followed the story fairly faithfully: JJ is a 'tween in the NYC foster care system, with a foster mother who cares more about the check she receives than the children in her care.  He decides to escape, and finds a treehouse in ruins in the middle of Central Park (a relic of the Depression-era ""Hooverville"" of the homeless) as his ""castle"".

TJ Hargrave is charming and convincing as JJ; Ruth Gordon is a park regular he befriends. There's a fringe drug dealer who tries to pull JJ into his crew; adds peril to the plot, and a good chase scene.  Overall, a sweet film that touches on the struggle for survival, the search for love & acceptance, and the ways we create the family ties we are not born with.

It's been years since I've seen this film running on cable, but every time  I see the title I check to see if it's this version, and not the deplorable 2000 Kathleen Turner/Danny Aiello film that uses only an iota  the original story.  A sad note: the young star of the film, Timothy John ""TJ""  Hargrave, was killed on September 11, 2001 at age 38; he was a vice president at Cantor Fitzgerald in the World Trade Center.",1184544000,8,1295,4.453389830508475
