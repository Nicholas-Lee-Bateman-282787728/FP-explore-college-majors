8312151,4,B001J83950,"In this romantic-comedy/fantasy, AP (Salman Khan) is in a rut of bad luck, and he loudly blames God.  God decides to let AP be God for 10 days, but it doesn't turn out as AP expected.

God Tussi Great Ho is a delightful movie, full of humor and charm, with an inspiring message as the final result.  The musical numbers were not impressive, but the script was cute, and Khan's performance spot-on as usual.  Don't let the negative reviews influence you; this one is worth watching.",1490140800,,481,4.558139534883721

It just seemed that some of the scenes could have been cut, since they seemed either too long or just unnecessary.",1356998400,,288,4.160714285714286
8312154,2,B001J83950,"This movie is such a waste of time! While there were some funny moments in the movie
with Salman and Sohail Khan, it wasn't enough to salvage this mega flop. All the songs were terrible and sooooo...cheesy! Normally I love any movies with Salman Khan but this one is a real disappointment.",1313366400,,289,4.576923076923077
8312155,3,B001J83950,"Salmon Khan plays an aspiring TV anchor whose luck never seems to go right. His response to this is to yell at God incessantly for giving him a bad deal. Finally God (Amitabh Bachchan) gives him His powers for 10 days to see if he can do better running the world.
This is inspired by Jim Carrey's 'Bruce Almighty'.
I'm not sure why I found it a bit unengaging but I did sit there without much of an emotional response throughout. It lacked sparkle for me.
They kept the comedy nicely restrained and didn't veer off into slapstick. The musical numbers were active and colourful (although many of the Indian reviewers though it was looked old in its numbers and staging).
I recall one song bordered on catchy but faded from memory with the others after it finished.
Salmon Khan threw himself into it. Amitabh was good (who else in India could play God!) Priyanka was fine and had the beautiful wardrobe.
Now the overall message had its heart in the right place but could have gone a lot deeper into the possibilities in its attempt at a social message. I give it marks for an effort in that direction though.
It was a movie with potential. I wondered how it would have been with more attention paid to the script (perhaps with a writer like the US one that produced 'Ground Hog Day' who can explore deeper and broader possibilities), and with another actor such as SRK who can milk more of an emotional and sympathetic response. However they didn't and, in the end, it is what it is: light fare with an attempt at a thoughtful message.
It is harmless family entertainment(unless you are resolutely atheistic or alternatively, believe that portraying God in movies is religious sacrilege - though in the latter case you may keep an open mind to see the message they push that is essentialist spiritual and humanitarian).
It's OK for anyone exploring light Bollywood fare but not one I'll bother re-watching I think.",1230336000,,1912,4.64306784660767
