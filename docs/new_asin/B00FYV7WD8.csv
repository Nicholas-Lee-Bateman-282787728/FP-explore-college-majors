6040190,5,B00FYV7WD8,"Along with Jon Krakaur's book, INTO THIN AIR, never have I seen a group of people that suffers from such hubris as mountain climbers or wanna-be's. There always seems to be at least a couple of people who have no business climbing.",1392768000,,231,4.523809523809524
6040191,4,B00FYV7WD8,This is a good movie that keeps you connected. I don't think this movie/documentary is for everyone. But if you're into the affects of the death zone and real life drama then you will probably like this. If your looking for Tom Cruise type action this is probably not for you.,1392681600,,276,4.431372549019608
6040192,3,B00FYV7WD8,"In addition to the confusion created by the non-linear and non-related storylines, I had real issues with the camerawork. The scenery was spectacular. I think it was, anyway. It's hard to say because the camera panned far too fast and the scenes jumped too quickly. I wish the scenic shots could have lingered a little longer so we could get an appreciation of the grandeur and beauty. The movie went to lengths to give us the names that went with the faces, and numerous overlong interviews, particularly with the widows and families. But when there was an opportunity to help us feel the pull of the mountain by focusing on the scenery and the action, the visuals went by too fast and were too choppy. Most of the movie was visually wasted. I wish the camera operators had slown down just a little so we could have been as drawn to the mountain as the climbers were and perhaps understood a little better what drove them. I also came away from the experience not really sure what exactly happened, and although I understand there are a lot of unanswered questions, it seems the answers that ARE known were deliberately withheld. I imagine the filmmakers tried to be deferential to the families in order to obtain their cooperation. I wish things had been  made more clear though.",1392508800,3,1281,4.668141592920354

6040195,1,B00FYV7WD8,"I am a high altitude mountain climber. These matters are studied by us in the coldest most unemotional way, as indeed they must be, if any instructive lessons are to be drawn from such incidents. This is quite obviously not the motive of this film's makers. Consequently, few if any questions are answered and little to no sense is made of this tragedy.

This movie goes out of its way to be sensitive to the living, and to leave unexplored the most unprofessional and even insane decision making of many who took part in this disaster in the making. It seems far more about allowing bereaved widows mourn their loved ones than an attempt to answer the only really important question, Why? To do this, it ignores an enormous amount of crucial detail, much of which is included even in the Wikipedia article. By the way, you will learn more from Wiki than you will from this film.

Even when examples of clearly bad decision making are exposed, the uninformed viewer will not realize it for the film's makers make no sort of clear declarative statement expressing just how inexplicable said decision was. The makers absolutely refuse to take any kind of a stand. No doubt this would have been controversial, or, it may have hurt people's feelings, and we certainly can't have any of that. There is no attempt to deal honestly and frankly with what happened.

The order of the film, I guess you would say the editing, is a confusing jumble of scenes with little order or sense. It jumps all over the place. Strictly from an entertainment perspective, it is bad movie-documentary making and I, a complete sucker for mountain movies, had a very hard time watching it through to the end. Not even its occasional beautiful cinematography can save this utterly disappointing mess of a film. I was left wondering what the point of this film was, for it serves no apparent purpose. Why did they bother?

To have some sense of how truly unprofessional some of these supposedly experienced mountaineers behaved, one should read a quote of the greatest mountaineer who has ever lived, Reinhold Messner, who put it simply and succinctly, ""Just pure stupidity.""

(Yes, this quote is flashed across the screen like a bolt of lightning at the beginning of the film, but it is neither explained nor is Messner given proper attribution, a most unpardonable omission, even for a college freshman.)",1391212800,46,2378,4.790243902439024
6040196,3,B00FYV7WD8,"A fascinating documentary of the tragedy of 2008 expedition on K2.  This movie was engaging in content though poorly organized in terms of presentation.

I love a good mountain climbing and survival movie.  Touching the Void is my favorite documentary in the harrowing high altitude category.  The Summit, which was apparently produced by the same company, attempts to use a similar approach to telling their story.  They interview survivors, use found footage, and film on location and elsewhere a recreation of events.  While the story itself is fascinating, the cinematography and found footage excellent,  the overall organization and presentation is choppy and often frustrating.  The 2008 story is interspliced with the account of Walter Bonatti from a 1954 Italian expedition on K2.  Just as one story starts to get interesting the filmmakers cut back to the other.  Often in films this has the effect of building suspense and intrigue but here it manages to destroy the momentum of both stories and over time achieve a slightly maddening effect.  Furthermore the 2008 story bounces around in time a lot with the same footage getting shown on several occasions.  It again draws more attention to the production choices and away from the story itself.  A more linear approach to the story telling would have been better.

The movie also lacks the intimacy and depth that Touching the Void was able to achieve.  Perhaps because so many people are involved, perhaps because its a different director.  I don't know.  However, there are a couple real gems of people to be found in this movie.  Pemba, the Nepalese climber, who, for his heroism, was later named Adventurer of the Year by National Geographic is one of them.

Overall, the movie kept me interested.  I was never bored.  I do recommend viewing it if you are interested in such subject matter and are willing to overlook some of its production flaws.",1390262400,25,1914,4.993670886075949

I love climbing films and this one just falls short. Like others said, the editing is awful. Unless you already knew the story it would be impossible to follow. Why Bonatti is in there is a mystery. They keep cutting back to him whining about the first ascent and it just offers nothing to the movie.

6040213,4,B00FYV7WD8,"The Summit Image Now Films and BBC 2014 Not Rated

High altitude.  Enormously driven egos.  Disaster.  The basics of this story are so similar to Jon Krakauers book Into Thin Air that I started mixing up the two stories in my mind.

This is about a disastrous climbing season on K-2, the worlds second-highest peak but by far the most deadly one to climb.  In August 2008 18 climbers managed to summit, but within 48 hours 11 of those 18 were dead.  The basic reason was simple and outside human control: an avalanche.  There was a secondary, man-made problem: a long delay for climbers at a bottleneck, not far from the summit.  This was caused by too many climbers, of differing levels of endurance and speed, all trying to squeeze through the same narrow spot.  In the 1996 Everest climbing season documented by Krakauer, a bottleneck near the summit of Everest was a major problem, and the other problem was not an act of God like an avalanche, but impossible egos leading to fatal results.

This film is well-done.  It combines actual interviews with survivors and family members of the deceased with excellent re-enactment of the climbing conditions (not in as extreme a locale, of course).  It did not have quite the emotional impact of Into Thin Air which had me madly scribbling notes in the margins.  But if you want an introduction into the extreme world of high altitude climbing, this is quite good.  Maybe not quite as good as K-2, but good.  I give it a B+.",1445644800,5,1472,4.625482625482626

6040217,1,B00FYV7WD8,"If you thought that a docudrama about 11 deaths on K2 could not be boring, you were wrong.  As I write I have the DVD in front of me - it says ""breath-taking and hair-raising - a literal cliffhanger"" by the critic at The Examiner.  He was lying - it is none of those things.

And also on the cover the Huffington Post says - ""I definitely recommend The Summit - Provided Your Nerves Can Stand it"".  I'm sorry, but there is not one exciting moment in the whole film.  In fact - the DVD cover is more potentially exciting than the film - if you rev it up with a bit of imagination.  What could have been exciting was not because the shots were not long enough.

It is disjointed, hard to follow, meaningful scenes are cut before you can get into them, most scenes are too short, and it is simply the worst mountaineering film I have ever seen.  It is almost impossible to follow what is going on, or to understand what is going on, as the climbers appear to do very stupid things  - such as not getting up in the morning, setting off too late, moving a body for no good reason that I can think of - and the film offers no explanation for these decisions.

But it is the rapidity of the different shots that causes any drama that might have been there to be lost.  Consequently we have a boring film depicting a very dramatic and traumatic event.  I could hardly believe that the editing could be so  terrible.

The shots of the mountain are great, and............sorry - there is no and, except that the shots of the mountain were also too brief to allow the splendour to be absorbed.",1435104000,3,1582,4.26510067114094

6040233,3,B00FYV7WD8,"Having read the outstanding book ""Buried in the Sky"" last year and after following a K2 expedition online this past summer, I finally made the effort to watch this film. I'd seen ads for it before and it looked mesmerizing and incredible: the events of August 1-2, 2008 are cinematic in their own right without any need for further dramatization.

As I watched the film, I was completely engrossed in the visuals, and wished some movie theaters in my part of the country had screened it. The actual documentary footage from the mountain flowed seemlessly into the re-enacted bits, and none of the film was shot on blue screen nor did it rely on digital FX. Every time the camera opened up to a wide shot of K2, or panned over some of the climbers to give a view of the Karakoram below, I was captivated.

But the good parts of the film essentially end here. I waited and waited, and with the last twenty minutes of the film remaining, I realized that the film really wasn't going anywhere, and was ""playing it safe"" to the point of being obstructionist and uninformative. The filmmakers even seem to have forgotten what the preview had attempted to illustrate: this would be a film about a tragedy cloaked in mystery and unanswered questions.

As other reviewers have noted, the questions go unanswered, but I'll take it a step further and posit that I don't think the film even ASKED any questions. Were it not for my own background reading on the subject, I would have come away from the film completely confused about what happened up there and why.

Of the numerous omissions from the film, one that really sticks out in my mind is the absence of Chiring Sherpa's free-climb down the bottleneck with his companion Pasang clinging to him and helping kick in steps. For a film which seemingly looked to find heroics in a place where people don't even have the energy to stay awake, this act of strength and courage is mindboggling, yet it was never mentioned. Nor is the fact that Wilco Van Rooijen essentially free-climbed a new route down the mountain. Given that his interviews in this film took up a substantial amount of airtime, the omission or lack of clarity with that facet of his getting off the mountain is startling.

Beyond completely omitting information such as the above, though, the film also seems to gloss over or inadequately explain both actual events on the mountain as well as the motivations of the characters we are following. Van Rooijen's refusal to take a man into his tent during the storm was spoken directly into the camera by the man himself, but the film-makers immediately move on and never explore his motivations for doing so. Likewise, the loss of Baig to illness just prior to the summit attempt (and what essentially set in the motion the cluster that day became) is glossed over, as is the fact that the inexperienced HAPs began setting the rope too early and hence ran out in the bottleneck. These facts are all sort of stated in the film by people being interviewed, but the gravity of them is completely missed because the interviews were also full of other miscellaneous information which was given the same weight. A person unfamiliar with this disaster would have no idea what the problems were.

Likewise, a few other critical things which either went unmentioned or were just barely introduced and never developed:

-Why its necessary to start so early, and the conflict that comes about when a person must choose to either continue ascending or turn around when they know they won't finish in time before nightfall. The film interviewed people who made the ""correct"" decision according to the logic of Ed Viesturs, as well as people who didn't, but never elaborated on the struggle people have with this seemingly easy decision. Having myself made the decision to abandon a summit attempt of my own only a few hundred feet from the top of a much easier peak, I can vouch for the self-control required to ""give-up"" after putting in days of effort just to get that close to the goal. The film never delved into this.

-Why is the bottleneck called that? Most people watching a film about K2 already know this, but a simple sentence could have closed the gap between the knowledgeable and the not.

-The effect of the delay on the people using oxygen. This was hinted at when Van de Gevel passed around D'Aubarede shortly before he falls, but the filmmakers never come out and tell us: ""He took too long, ran out of bottled O2, and then ran out of strength.""

-The inability of the climbers to either climb or downclimb the Bottleneck without fixed ropes.

-The changes the bottleneck had after the first serac fall. I've read from numerous first hand accounts that after the terrain there was essentially subjected to a nuclear attack, it looked completely unfamiliar and was in fact more steep than before, with large gouges and craters in it, as well as icy debris sitting everywhere. From the point of view of this film, I never saw that visually nor was it mentioned.

-The life or death decision one must make to either descend without ropes during the night, risking falling or cliffing out, vs bivying in the death zone and waiting until dawn to move. The feeling of being trapped up there is never communicated in this film, nor is it laid that that essentially both of these choices are nightmarish but that you must pick one.

-The mystery of where Ger went and why. I was a little surprised that even with all the time given to this character (he was the central protagonist if there was one in this film), it still was unclear to someone as well-read as I am about this tragedy what the filmmakers were trying to explore he did or didn't do. Did he return up the mountain as a result of incoherence from his long night in the death zone? Was it to work on the anchor up to help free the trapped Koreans? These questions aren't even really asked, just sort of hinted at or skirted around. I completely understand that we'll never know an answer or the motivations of many of the decisions, but for God's sake, at least come out and ask the damn question, and tell us what exactly the ""mystery"" is that you're exploring in this film.

-How did some of the climbers get down? In particular, with Nessa and Skog, I go from seeing them clinging to the bottleneck and watching the death of Rolf to suddenly they're back at C4 safely. That was no easy feat for them, especially the emotional Nessa, but we never really see how they got down there, which begs the question: if they could do it, why couldn't the climbers above them? The answers are obvious to anyone familiar with high-altitude mountaineering, but for a general audience that this film seems to be built for, the question isn't even presented. How did these folks get down the hellish nightmare of the Bottleneck?

-How did the avalanche not bury or kill everybody caught in it? Again, anyone with firsthand mountaineering experience knows how this works, and anyone well-read on this story known the geography of the mountain, but I confess that seeing a man survive an avalanche and then not explaining how he did that almost seems to mitigate the danger of the avalanche and serac fall. Oh, an avalanche? He just ducked, clung to the snow, and he was fine. They must not be that deadly.

-Why do we climb all the way to C4, then reset to three months before the climb? I get the point of starting a film off with a bang, but this really destroyed all the pacing the first fifteen minutes of the film had set in motion.

With the omissions and hints at so much crucial information left out, seemingly for the purpose of not alienating anyone they interviewed for this film nor for wanting to cast a critical glance on the deceased, the filmmakers then haul in Walter Bonatti, and they try to weave his expedition to K2 into the events of 2008 and allow him to basically air his grievances about the Italian government's response to the first summit of K2. The jumping back and forth is ultimately pointless; I suppose the filmmakers were trying to make a connection between the two expeditions or build some kind of thematic element around the idea that the dead can't speak and that the living must endure an unpleasant aftermath of public scrutiny, but after tip-toeing around everything related to the central premise of their story, I was pretty disgusted with them throwing in Bonatti and letting him air his dirty laundry out. It made no sense to the story, wasn't even fleshed out to the point where an unfamiliar audience could understand what the hell he was talking about, and it continuously bogged the actual story this documentary was trying to tell down in political pointlessness. His story merits its own film and scrutiny: this was not the place for it.

All of this said, I still sadly enjoyed parts of this movie simply because the visuals were exquisite. The falling serac knocking Rolf down vividly showed the hazards that one simply can't avoid on a mountain like K2, and the falls of the two climbers on August 1st showed how quickly one goes from simply losing their balance to being on an out of control glissade. In short, if you're interested in K2 or in high altitude mountaineering, you're going to watch this movie simply because there isn't enough other material out there about this peak or this tragedy. The footage is outstanding and worth a watch if only for that. But don't expect a captivating story.",1409443200,32,9459,4.653892215568862

Which isn't to say that the Summit is boring or that there aren't plenty of captivating, memorable scenes that will leave you contemplating afterwards.  Visually, the cinematography is fantastic and the night climbing showcased the otherworldly, darker side of alpine climbing.  But where this docu-film suffers I think is from lack of direction and within the editing room.  The direction of the film doesn't always seem clear and after a while you begin to sense that the movie is simply meandering around and that the original story has been lost somehow.  I came away having no idea why it all went wrong, who was to blame or what the hell was happening on the mountain at any given time.  Just felt like a hodgepodge of different accounts blended together with confusion being the overriding, rampant theme (and the strangest part of all is I'm not even sure the climbers knew what happened on K2)  But again, this is a story that leaves the viewer with few answers and much to be desired.  Also, the back an forth cuts to an interview with the first man to summit K2 feels like another movie in itself and disconnected from the main one.

6040238,3,B00FYV7WD8,"For those that have read or followed the accounts of this particular K2 summit year, this documentary will be of interest.  The information is presented in a somewhat scattered, shotgun way that if you didn't have prior knowledge of the events, or the players, it might be perceived as sketchy. It's also true that this isn't as complete as it could be. There's some footage from base camp and camp 4, shown in a documentary done by the discovery/science channels that didn't make it here.

The film, in addition to being sketchy is a bit schizophrenic - it doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be an account or a eulogy, and the inclusion of the older story, while it might have been worthy of a documentary of its own, didn't seem to belong in this flim.

I think most viewers watching this type of story want to know why, with the best of plans, this happened.  And I don't think the film made a valid attempt at a coherent explanation, probably because to do so would have ruffled too many feathers both in Pakistan and the small climbing world, and they might not get ingress to make more documentaries.

The obvious issue here was crowd control.  The climbers don't have control over how many permits are sold for a given mountain. And it's understandable that highly motivated climbers, who have paid tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars for permits and expeditions, who have sponsors to satisfy in that regard, and who've waited months in base camp for the right conditions, are all going to lunge for the summit when the conditions present themselves. Nepal at one point severely restricted permits to avoid this, but after the local community, whose livelihood depends on  these permits, protested they couldn't earn a living, the permit situation loosened again.  Unless there is a traffic cop at Base Camp, restricting how many can be in higher camps at a given time, I don't think it's likely that impassioned climbers, frustrated after months of waiting, aren't going to keep creating these scenes.  After all, even after the experiences of the fateful 1996 commercial expeditions to Everest, we still see hundreds of marginally competent climbers, jumaring up fixed lines to that summit, too many people over loading one ice screw, where an avalanche or a accident might affect many dozens. There's too much money in this, for these countries or the climbing community to put any serious restrictions on this.

The second obvious issue was climbers need to remember warm days can be as dangerous as blizzards, once that water freezes. The summit day was unreal in its perfection -- almost too hot.  But when night fell, and all that melted water refroze in the seracs, they calved and set off multiple avalances, all night long.  It wasn't just one avalanche that took out the fixed ropes. There were others that took out Ger, after he freed the Koreans.

It's also true there were climbers of varying abilities. Some climbers were well prepared technically and materially. Others only had the chance to get up the mountain with the skilled help of others, or came without full expeditions, relying on other teams to set ropes and provide support.

I don't think enough emphasis was placed on the lead climbing siddhar, who was the only one who could translate among certain key individuals. When he became ill, the cooperation between lead climbers meant to fix ropes, never strong to begin with, fell apart for lack of communication.

It's unfortunate the Koreans didn't participate in the documentary, because a lot of fingers have been pointed that way. They supposedly volunteered to keep the inventory, to ensure the equipment agreed among the groups was carried up.  Allegedly that was not done, so necessary equipment was absent at camp 4. Their HAPS allegedly didn't fully cooperate in the agreed upon rope setting duties, or get out of their tents. Both resulted in fatal delays on summit day.  There's been allegation of incompetence in the climbers, and in the porters they hired  -- some hints that Sherpas wouldn't work with them, because of prior problems with this group.  But because they didn't participate,  we don't have their side and when a disaster occurs there's always many sides.

During the avalanche  that cut the fixed ropes, some climbers were swept away, some were tangled in the remains of the fixed ropes, hanging helplessly, some were stranded above, unsure what happened to the ropes leading down.  That meant climbing down without benefit of fixed ropes, through terrain not just now changed and unfamiliar, but also through a recent avalanche zone.  Exhausted by their summit bid, confused by the altered terrain, and wary of going down the wrong way, some were reluctant to do this in the night, preferring to wait for daylight  when the situation became clearer.  Others were more comfortable going down by ice ax and crampons, rather than waiting through the freezing night. That's a personal choice, based upon a climbers own decision as to the risks and merits of either.

It's also true that when some encountered climbers in misfortune, some for various reasons went on, and others helped.  The documentary presented both sides of this, reasonably fairly.  As was adequately shown when other climbers risked their lives trying to get a climber's body to camp 4, helping others can involve fatal risks.  When more technically accomplished climbers who've prepared and provisioned properly are asked to risk not just their summit bid, but their lives for other climbers who are ill prepared or equipped, climbers who can only summit and get down with perfect conditions, and then the conditions turn imperfect and everyone's life is even more at risk, it's hard not to understand the frustration and even fury the first climbers feel when the situation they dreaded came to pass. Particularly when they warned the others before both that they were improperly prepared and that if they went anyway and got in trouble they would not help them. That's a personal decision on both sides.  As far as Ger's situation, I think there's enough evidence to show that he had been well trained in the type of rescue the Koreans needed, that he went back up the mountain to get the right angles from the dangling lines they were tangled in to free them, and that he did succeed in doing so, based on reported sightings,  before another avalanche came. That certainly makes him a hero (and there were other heroes that day).  But oddly enough, I don't think this documentary, for all it gave voice to his relatives, actually gave all the details relevant to Ger's experience, and how it related to his actions on that day in going back up the mountain.

I think this documentary is perhaps more useful in giving the relatives voice, than in being a real documentary of that ill fated expedition year on K2.  But I still found it worth watching, for the additional perspective it gave.",1399852800,3,6935,4.868197278911564
6040239,2,B00FYV7WD8,"Ah yes. The dreaded two-star rating (nobody reads these). To save time, the best word to describe this movie is confused. This movie could have certainly been great, but it was anything but. I would put this movie just below the awful 'Into Thin Air' movie attempt and just above 'Cliffhanger.' It's certainly not the worst climbing movie, but it's absolutely within sight of it.

These days the real climber mountain is K2 of the Karakoram Range. Since Everest has become so tourist-y, the big names of big mountain climbing take on K2 knowing full-well that it's a calculated risk. This mountain claims roughly one life for every four summits.  Storms blow in without warning to trap climbers high up. Remarkably, it has never been topped out in the winter. It's alluring, it's dangerous, it's nearly controlled chaos, and it's beautiful when it all works out. As Simon Yates said (paraphrasing) that there's a level of safety in our lives that require us to inject an element of danger. In other words, those who bubble-wrap their kids, or wear helmets for everything wouldn't understand why they tempt fate with the world's highest peaks. It's the very reason the expeditions in 'Summit' were on K2 in 2008. Why do they climb these mountains? As George Mallory quipped, ""Because it's there.""

The movie has two aspects going for it: the scenery and no CGI. The shots of the Baltoro Glacier inching through the Range is spectacular. The shot of the nearly-unbelievable cornice near the summit was remarkable. The real footage was what saved this movie. The fact that the acted portions did not resort to filming in a studio showed a commitment to the story. What it does demonstrate is how many people are put at risk when one person is attempted to be rescued at altitude. Instead of potentially one casualty, the combined expeditions had eleven. But it was all confusing.

Glancing at the cover, this movie earned ""Winner: Best Editing, Sundance Film Festival,"" a moniker that had to be read twice. The editing is the worst part of this movie. We begin with a story about a climber falling, only to later see the same footage an hour or so later for some reason. We are unsure as to where the real footage starts and the rehashed footage stops. Just when it couldn't be any more confusing, the movie adds the storyline of the first climber to ascend K2. Not only does this detract from the story, it does absolutely no justice for Walter Bonatti, it actually seems insulting what with the small amount of time he's allotted. It should've been cut out of the movie or doubled in length. The eleven climbers who tragically died are glossed-over as they succumb to the raw power of the mountain. It felt insulting to them as well.

This movie tried quite hard to follow the 'Touching the Void' blueprint. This was a bad idea. It was apparent at the start of the movie when there was a quote that was reminiscent of Simon Yates' at the beginning of 'Touching the Void.' The interviews felt scripted as well as the emotions. The extreme closeups in the interviews made me want to push my couch farther back as it felt the person was hovering in front of me. Further, there was an extreme lack of connection with those in the interviews. The argument of combining the expeditions was a tragic mistake is lost in the buzzing, unstructured format. (These experienced climbers should have told the other expeditions they were on their own to decide on a summit bid.)

If one were to take a trip the movie's official website, it shows all the awards that were stuck to this film. Perhaps I'm missing something. Perhaps movies that go out-of-order, with seemingly forced emotions, with randomly injected storylines are the new thing in independent movies. I suppose this movie is worth a glance for the scenery and all the cool gear. If you miss it, it's completely ok, believe me.",1397001600,5,3875,4.733333333333333

6040241,4,B00FYV7WD8,"The movie itself was very well done - a combination of actual footage and re-enactment.  Editing the two formats together was extremely professional, and the movie pulled me in just the same as if it were a good work of fiction.  The film basically details the actions of several teams of climbers who attempted to summit K-2, but who for reasons that remain a mystery, were beset by problems from the start, which ended up resulting in the death of 11 climbers over a 48 hour period of time.

I had two problems with the movie - one just a technical issue that had to do with streaming.  When the movie first started streaming, it kept freezing and ""re-connecting.""  I don't know if this was a problem w/ the site or with my computer, and my rating of the movie does NOT reflect this problem. Finally, after about 10 minutes, it settled down and streamed normally without any further issues.

The other problem I had with the film is that I couldn't help noticing that the REAL ""heroes"" of the movie were those we never really saw - the sherpas and porters who basically carry the supplies for the climbing teams and go up AHEAD of the climbers to lay the ropes.  I wasn't clear on just how many of these unsung heroes died - but it was a philosophical issue with me to consider that these people do this dangerous job so that more wealthy clients may then have the privilege of climbing the world's most dangerous mountain.  I've been a bit of an adverturer all of my life - but not the sort who would risk anyone's life but my own.  I understand that this is their JOB and they do it willingly... I'm just saying that the film really made me think about the philosophical and even spiritual implications of risking so many lives just for the thrill of reaching the summit.  I'm not judging anybody - just curious about the mindset of both the climbers and sherpas alike.  What makes them tick?  THE SUMMIT gives us a good look at the most prominent of the climbers, but I would have liked to see more about the sherpas who make it all possible.

Overall, THE SUMMIT is well worth your time - a fascinating look at what is perhaps the world's most dangerous sport.",1395964800,,2166,4.425692695214106
6040242,4,B00FYV7WD8,"I would recommend this movie but don't expect breathtaking climbing shots or technical sequences of the climbers like Into The Void or even K2.  They do have some great shots of K2 but the film is telling a story.  Some of the non-English accents can be hard to understand at times but you get most of what they are saying.  Also it is a better movie if you have read about this tragedy beforehand.  I found it strange the film did not name names when it came to the inexperienced climbers that caused this tragedy.  For those comments or views who find it difficult to follow because of flash backs to 1954 climb, that is so common in movies that I surprised you complained or commented.  I found the background on climbing K2 in 1954 very interesting and a direct parallel to what happened in 2006.  Human nature does not change much.  Many people will try to lay blame on survivors.  The ones who lost people want answers and not everone can recall exactly what happened in the death zone.  There are many stories.",1394236800,,1017,4.478260869565218
6040243,3,B00FYV7WD8,"The Summit is a frustrating film because there is dynamic content on display throughout, but the enterprise is unfocused and flawed, undermining noble intentions and leaving an enormous amount of potential unrealized.  It is a documentary concerning a troubled and, in the end, deadly expedition to climb K2, the world's second highest mountain, in the summer of 2008.  Through interviews, photographs, and cinematic reenactments, several of the climbers are profiled (they are in turn a bitchy, charming, guarded, and soulful unit) and the lethal downfall of their adventure is depicted and debated.  There are several scenes of awe-inspiring excitement and fear, capturing how insignificant human existence becomes in the outsize and unforgiving context of the mountain.  In one such scene, an out-of-the-blue piece of falling ice emerges from the silence and the night to end a life of an unsuspecting Norwegian climber.  He is there one second and gone forever the next.  Ah, if only the film containing these memorable and piercing incidents were not plagued by so many structural and thematic defects.

The nonfiction storyline is presented, for reasons I cannot understand, out of chronological order.  The summit is reached around 30 minutes in, then the music turns menacing as the dangerous descent begins.  Then, however, the film cuts to several months earlier to show the early steps of the expedition.  It is disorienting and grating, and I believe simply tracing point A to point B to point C in a straight line would have maximized the majesty and the suspense.  Also unusual is the completely arbitrary inclusion of another story involving the first major bid to climb the mountain by Italians in the 1950s.  These self-contained moments are not uninteresting, but they deserve their own film and are not served well when shoehorned into this one.  They only function as a distraction.

The Summit also contends with what I regard as a type of internal conflict.  Is it simply an adventure and survival story?  Is it exploring the mystery of why climbers endanger themselves in the (perhaps vainglorious) pursuit of their lifestyle and sport?  Is it a political expose intended to place blame and locate a protagonist and an antagonist within the expedition?  One after the other, it tries its hand at each and is at its worst when the third question rises to the fore:  South Koreans who declined to be interviewed are, in an uncomfortable way, cast as sinister and in over their head, whereas an Irishman who lost his life, and whose still-upset family members [i]are[/i] interviewed, is positioned as mythic and noble.  An Irish co-production, the film's strong-arm, cue-the-trumpets tactics to glorify him are unpersuasive, and it honestly left me convinced there is much more to the story of his final day of life.

Comparisons to the masterful Touching the Void, the story of a two-man climb gone very wrong in Peru, are hard to avoid.  Minor by comparison, The Summit is nowhere near as adept in any conceivable area.  The human drama is more involving and moving in Touching the Void, which is also simply more exciting as a piece of brutal high-altitude entertainment and without a doubt crafted with more care and intelligence as a documentary incorporating reenactments.",1394150400,4,3298,5.111940298507463

6040245,1,B00FYV7WD8,"I got the impression this was more about deflecting blame, and not determining simply what happened. it was shown out of sequence, and left nothing resolved other than 11 dead on a mountain that is admittedly like russian roullette. I understand the desire to climb. To reach heights. To challenge the body. The Mind. But only if you are prepared. Over crowding on mountains seems to be the reason all these tragedies occur. That and inexperienced climbers. So what if you want to climb K2, or Mt Everest. If you cant you cant. If you die trying you knew the risk, and under prepared expeditions should not be rescued at the sacrifice of others ambitions. Everyone who goes up there is playing the odds. You work as a team. If you can organize help, by all means. This is a terribly sad story, and My heart goes out to the families and the wonderful people who were perusing dreams. Its no ones fault Its K2. The risks are eminent. If you don't accept death before you go, you don't belong. Thats why I wouldn't step foot on that mountain. It doesn't mean I don't have the highest regard for those that do. I was really looking forward to this release, and it was simply not good. Its the same story over and over. Too many people, they get in trouble, and they cant themselves get out of it without sherpas. It will happen time and again, as the money is too important to nepal and tibet (pakistan) in this case. Those mountains should be held in regard, and only for the utmost professional climbers. I am saddened by this loss of life and feel terrible for those that lost love ones and survived, but everyone knew the risks, well one team didn't even bring ropes so what does that tell you... It could have been told much better, less sentimental, and more raw. this was tragedy. It is very sad this film didn't do the justice it should have.",1393718400,6,1846,4.448377581120944
