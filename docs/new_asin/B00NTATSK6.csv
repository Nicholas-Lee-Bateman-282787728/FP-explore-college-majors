8680104,2,B00NTATSK6,"I expected so much more from this DVD based on the reviews and the price. It doesn't have much content. The song is the same repetitive mantra with different words each day. The characters are little help guiding children through the tapping steps as they are poor quality cartoons that don't always make the tapping motions. The tapping method with colors is briefly shown at the beginning of the DVD but not to a degree that a child would get it right away. The song lyrics change color to indicate where to tap but the tap location isn't shown again, children are supposed to recall from the brief, once through, intro.  Overall very disappointing. Don't waste your time. You're better off singing your kids ""You are my Sunshine"" and giving them extra hugs than spending the money on this to encourage them.",1520294400,,810,4.704225352112676
