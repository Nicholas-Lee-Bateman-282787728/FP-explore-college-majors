7035827,1,B00UCADTZ6,Elysium which is first film I watched has seemed like it skips as it has flashes of something during play. Unacceptable as I had just opened the DVD moved it to the DVD player and played it. Chappie worked fine. Big disappointment as Elysium is such a great flick.,1503792000,,264,4.408163265306122

7035829,5,B00UCADTZ6,"If you like these films this is GREAT! If you're not into Blomkampt's style, then this would be, ""Meh."". I really enjoy his work so this was fantastic for me.",1500336000,,158,4.3

7035831,5,B00UCADTZ6,"Excellent combination of movies.  I only got it for Chappie and District 9 and didn't know much about Elysium.  The movie wasn't great but it wasn't bad either.  Elysium is decent and what I call a popcorn movie (rental)

I like the collectors box.",1496102400,,248,4.568181818181818
7035832,5,B00UCADTZ6,Chappie is one of my fave movies of all time,1495152000,,44,3.5
7035833,5,B00UCADTZ6,"These are probably ""fringe, cult "" movies. I  like them all. Elysium best, then Chappie, then District 9. I have to admit that I had to watch Disrict 9 a second time to really ""get it. I watch films I like over and over ad nauseam, I  don't watch TV.",1495152000,,250,3.98

7035854,4,B00UCADTZ6,"Definitely a great product. The three movies are great, and look great in high definition. The book and its contents will not disappoint any fan of these films. My only problem, District 9 does not come with subtitles in Spanish, while Elysium and Chappie if subtitling has said. Otherwise I am very happy with this purchase that looks great in my collection.",1475193600,,359,4.806451612903226

7035858,5,B00UCADTZ6,"Simply put, this collection is a steal for 3 incredible, thought-provoking films. Elysium, starring Matt Damon, showcases a future where the class system is taken to the highest extreme possible - where the rich live on practically another world than the rest. District 9 takes you to a future where humans live among aliens, but the two groups are segregated - but one man begins to cross from one race to the other. Chappie is not as good as the other two, but is still a unique take on the idea of AI.

Enough about the movies, let's talk about the product. It's pretty much a standard Digibook release, with a booklet featuring scenes from all three films, along with background on characters and plots. The discs are the standard art from the original releases, which is perfectly fine. You also get a code for a digital copy of all three movies. Note that this code only redeems via UV, not iTunes, and requires a free (albeit annoying) Sony Pictures account. I would highly recommend this for any sci-fi fan who hasn't seen these movies - if you've seen them, it may be worth looking into just to own the digital copies.",1473811200,,1127,4.579207920792079
7035859,2,B00UCADTZ6,"This is not about the movies themselves (which in fact I like); it's about the package. It arreived sealed, as expected, but when I opened it all contents inside (discs and flyers) were loose, AND THE CHAPPIE DISC WAS MISSING!! I live outside of USA so it's way more expensive to begin a return process (item cost ~13 bucks, returning it from another country costs ~40), then I can do nothing about it. Very dissapointing",1472947200,3,421,4.626666666666667
7035860,5,B00UCADTZ6,Superior to other products.  All others are inferior and not up to scratch. I mean seriously.,1472774400,,93,4.8125
7035861,5,B00UCADTZ6,3 of my favorite movies in a set very happy about it.,1471996800,,53,3.5
7035862,5,B00UCADTZ6,"Chappie is the best of the 3, then district 9 then elysium. Without giving spoilers

Chappie is good (7/5) because he really is a believable AI being, well executed, and really more human than anyone else in the movie, so much more so you want him to succeed the entire time.

District 9 is good (4.5/5) for portrayal of the disenfranchised as aliens that look like cockroaches. And what happens when they ban together.

Elysium (3/5) I would say is the worst of the 3. Feels like a 5 hour movie cut into a 2 hour slot. There is always Chappie!",1470528000,,544,4.366336633663367

7035864,5,B00UCADTZ6,"Awesome collector's set of Neill Blomkamp's 3 movies. Only complaint is I wish the book came separate and the way the discs are packaged is a bit weird but that's only me personally. As for the ""book"" that comes with it. It's just a couple pages from the art/behind the scenes books of the respective movies.",1469836800,,308,4.517857142857143

7035868,4,B00UCADTZ6,"A different sort of box set. No sleeve. Comes with an art book built in with one disc ahead and 2 discs after it. The photo shows it separate from the box, but it seems to be a part of the box.

Bluray quality was true.

Films are fun. I won't speak up on them though, just the physical product.",1468800000,,295,3.9
7035869,5,B00UCADTZ6,"If you like any of Neill blomkamp's movies, this is an absolute must have! This set of his first three films, Elysium, Chappie, and District 9, is the best edition of each of these films. The remaster in 4k of Elysium and Chappie looks incredible on a set capable of displaying in this resolution.  Other reviewers have already noted that the description does not state that ultraviolet movies are provided as well which is a great addition. If you haven't seen any of these movies, the current price of $13.50 gives a low barrier of entry into this visionary director's masterpieces!",1467417600,2,584,4.782178217821782

Two of the films are polluted by Cinavia copy protection which renders the audio damaged and unplayable on my high end equipment (I can actually hear the watermark).

7035894,5,B00UCADTZ6,I was completely surprised by the quality of this little pack. I was expecting some flimsy plastic like most blurays coming out recently but it's not. It seems to be made out of some pretty sturdy cardboard or something like a nice hardcover book. The discs are mounted to some plastic plates inside which are glued to the case itself. The case is engraved with the lettering of the movie titles and Blomkamp3 at the top. The book is a bit rigid to open but that might just be me being too careful with it. I recommend this product in a heartbeat.,1444435200,,547,4.372549019607843

7035926,5,B00UCADTZ6,"This collection contains three of the movies that won me over for new heights of cinema in recent years.
When I saw ""Elysium"", my jaw hit the floor. ""CHAPPiE"" brought back my old love for Johnny 5. ""District 9"" was such a fresh idea to the humans and aliens concept.
Neill Blomkamp is truly on the rise to be one of the most talented, and this collection proves it, pound for pound. Every scene is worthy of praise and each actor in these films are running on all cylinders!
Obviously, this was made for the release of ""CHAPPiE"", so that movie is in the front of the book, instead of ""D9"". The book contains in depth articles and information on each movie to fill you with more love for these movies.
Some people commented on the ""themes"" it seems these film possess; all I will say is that it could be easily filed into a ""Spiritual Trilogy"" (meaning, not direct sequels, but a different telling of the message) of, ""What would you do with limited time?"" So don't let that dissuade you.
An amazing collection to have, indeed.",1440979200,5,1026,4.462765957446808

7035938,5,B00UCADTZ6,"Neill Blomkamp took the sci-fi world by storm with his relatively low budget megahit District 9, and has since gone to make two more successful feature films. Neill's movies have a distinctive world-building style to them that has become his signature along with storytelling that often delves into social/political statements. What you have here is the collection of all of his movies to date along with the special features from each. Additionally you get special features that were originally exclusive to special releases of their respective movies, and you also get a  64 page ""digi-book"" (it's a booklet printed in the blu-ray case). Personally I'm a big fan of all the films so far. Here's a breakdown of each film along with what I feel are the shortcomings:

District 9

This film is about a mild mannered government worker overseeing the relocation of a race of aliens from one poverty stricken shanty town to another. Along the way he gets involved way too deeply in the affairs of the aliens and must now help them in any way he can. This movie's biggest draw was the amazing special effects and attention to detail. The film's budget was $30 million, but it looks like a film with three times that budget (and more). The story is lean and simple. The action is gruesome with exploding bodies and sci-fi weapons wreaking havoc, which gives the sci-fi action fans something to love. There isn't much to hate on this film other than the fact the plotline isn't very complex, however that made the film lean and visceral. Of all of Blomkamp's films District 9 is touted as the absolute best of the bunch by fans and critics everywhere.

Elysium

Here you have a down out laborer/ex-con who becomes fatally ill after an industrial accident. His only hope of survival is access to medical care only found with the super-wealthy residence of the Elysium space station. On the way he finds more to fight for than himself. This movie mimics much of the disparity found in District 9, only instead of the subjugation of race it's of social and financial class. The movie hit all the marks when it came to the perfection of building a sci-fi world, and it had a good amount of action and story development. I felt what the movie really missed was a hero. Our main character never really got the chance to play that hero role like we found in District 9. I think this is what makes the movie fall flat for a lot of people. For me it was still a great movie, but yeah. I would have liked to see Matt Damon kick more butt than he did.

Chappie

It's a story about a robot created with self awareness that learns from life the hard way, but never stops reaching for the ideals his creator intended. Social commentary takes a back seat on this film, but in its stead comes an observation of South African thug life. The real treat is how Chappie develops and grows, which is really what the film is about. Like District 9 it's a simple story, but there are a number of complexities that move their way through the plot. The robots are unbelievably realistic in this movie, but have a lot of design nods to the robots from Elysium. Lots of people got turned off by the focus of the characters portrayed by hip hop act Die Antwoord, but I liked the interplay. Chappie didn't make the same mistake previously, and this time you do get the right amount of hero action. The villain in the film felt a bit off though, and too stereotypical in his actions. All in all I still love this film.

The video for all three discs is a full 1080p AVC at 24bits with English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 in English and French (Elysium additionally has Spanish in Dolby Digital 5.1 and Chappie has everything mentioned plus Thai in Dolby Digital 5.1). Video and audio look and sound amazing so there shouldn't be any worries on compression. The individual discs should have all the original extra features found in the separate releases along with a few extras:

District 9 - 17 minutes of Comic-Con 2009 footage. This footage shows part of the viral marketing campaign they did for the film. I believe this was only previously released on a bonus DVD for a limited time.

Elysium - I believe you get about 30 minutes of features that were found on the Best Buy Exclusive release for the film. Plus there is another 15 minutes of additional extra that have never been seen previously.

The discs for District 9 and Elysium are completely reauthored to be able to include the new content. So these aren't just repackaged from the individual releases. These are Blu-Rays made specific for this edition. The attached booklet is a lot like a mini version of the art books that have been published with conceptual drawings and design work as well as some production notes. District 9 seems go get a bit less in page content than Elysium and Chappie, but that is not to say you don't get good coverage. All of the movies have a respectable level of attention in this booklet.

A word of warning for those of you getting this release in stores. I have seen store releases that use this protective case many call ""spider wraps"" that have the serious potential to damage or dent the packaging edges and corners. Target and Wal-Mart are the main culprits, and the spider wraps are always bad news for digi-pack and Blu-Rays with slip covers. Just be aware. This shouldn't be a problem with online purchases. Neill  Blomkamp has made a big name for himself in science fiction, and considering his future projects involve big name franchises it seems he's not going to leave us anytime soon. If you are a fan of these movies this is a great way to get them... if the price is right. If the price is right and even if you have one of the previous movies this should be worth your while. I ordered mine at $20 even though I already his first two movies. The extras and the price were a no brainer.",1438646400,24,5859,4.552706552706553
7035939,3,B00UCADTZ6,"Obvioulsy, it's District 9. In fact, I believe I paid that price ($19.99) for District 9 back then and it was still worth it. Elysium wasn't a great sophomore title, but it's entirely not as stupid and very watchable compared to the next attempt for Blomkamp to wow audiences after D9. Here is my suggestion:
Buy District 9, buy Elysium at a bargain price, and forget about ChappiE. To replace Chappie, buy the original Robocop and Netflx Short Circuit instead. You'll not only save money, but also brain cells.",1438646400,2,511,4.752808988764045
7035940,1,B00UCADTZ6,"This movie was so bad that I wanted to claw my eyes out! It was beyond frustrating and the whole plot was just plain stupid. The characters looked so ridiculous, the robot would win best dressed. A complete waste of my time and money.",1438646400,2,234,4.340909090909091

7035950,4,B00UCADTZ6,"This was a perfect ""get"" for me because I'd wanted to see all of these movies when they were released in theaters, but never got around to it.  Thus, the entire collection was unchartered territory for me.  I opted to watch the movies in reverse order of release (""Chappie"" then ""Elysium"" then ""District 9"") because the review consensus is that Blomkamp's movies get slightly worse each time.  Having now seen ""Chappie"" and ""Elysium,"" I wouldn't necessarily agree (I'd put those two at about even).

Production values are great in the two movies I've seen so far, with impressive and, perhaps, unparalleled robot effects.  The ""Chappie"" storyline is ambitious, but seems to take on too much in its allotted time frame.  Despite this, it does it well.  The ""Elysium"" plot is a little more balanced, but there is a cyberpunk element that the audience has to accept in order to make the film somewhat believable.  (Example: the cyber ""gang"" in Los Angeles oddly has access to shuttles that can be sent into space . . . not to mention a full understanding of technologies on the Elysium ""space station.""

My biggest gripe about these movies is the abundant and generally unnecessary use of the ""F"" word.  Seems like Blomkamp is cutting off a whole crowd of viewers by garnering ""R"" ratings for these movies.  Just sayin'!",1436140800,4,1317,4.808888888888889
7035951,5,B00UCADTZ6,"Saw it in theaters, had to get it on blu-ray. If you like Blomkamp this 3 in 1 is absolutely worth it. Nice factoid/art book about the three movies is included within the case.",1435104000,8,176,4.205882352941177
