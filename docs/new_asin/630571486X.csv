1062895,5,630571486X,"What I love about this is the Quality that Blu ray gives us, this Movie on a regular dvd is so much darker looking. With this blu ray it really pops and is so much more defined. You see far better and its so crisp. The sound is also far better as this is what blu ray gives us. I liked the story very much as it is different from so many of the Hollywood story lines. I also Loved the fact that you see Reese younger as she was coming up and in a different type of character that shows you just how great of an actress she truly is and why she became such a big star. I just love Reese's work  and she was very good in this as well. The  performances are there, the whole cast does a great job, the writing is fine, the plot is solid and the story moves along. Reese Witherspoon, Alessandro Nivola, Josh Brolin,Rocky Carroll,Terrence Howard,Rebecca Klingler, Mike Hagerty all faces and actors and actresses you will know and all when they were a little younger and very little known. I Highly recommend this to all and with Blu ray you will see it in a very clear way  Plus you will see a young NCIS director Vance ( Rocky Carroll) who does a nice job. There are NO EXTRAS in this DVD it's just the movie with chapter search",1370131200,,1224,4.112970711297071
1062896,2,630571486X,"The only reason to watch this film is young Reese Witherspoon, who was 22 years old when the film was produced during 1998 by Dogstar Films. It bombed in the USA when it was released during September 1999 and I mean bombed, generating only $25,000 in box-office revenue. Reese does not list it in her biography nor does imdb.

It is difficult to believe that Ted Griffin wrote the original screenplay, since he next wrote Ocean's Eleven. I cannot comprehend why Dogstar Films purchased the screenplay. The story is contrived and ridiculous. Alessandro Nivola plays a college student who returns home to care for his dying father, a history professor at the local community college. The story opens with him working at the local recycling center in ""Tropico, a dead-end town in California, which in reality was Bakersfield.

Rushing to attend his father's cemetery ceremony, he seriously injures a neighbor's cat. He takes it to the local vet where he meets Lissa (played by Reese), the vet's receptionist. After departing the vet's office he finds his car has a flat tire. Instantly, Reese drives him to cemetery and a few hours later they have wild sex. Things go downhill from there.

Bryce (Josh Brolin), Alessandro's alleged best friend from college happens to arrive in town for a teaching job at the local community college. Meanwhile, Alessandro learns that he will not inherit several hundred thousand dollars because his father lied to the insurance company about his health, plus owes the IRS $200,000 in back taxes. At this point the screenplay becomes ridiculous.

One of the losers working at the recycling center conveniently offers Alessandro an opportunity to make a quick $10,000 simply for driving the getaway car after the loser robs a local drug-dealer. Somehow, the drug-dealer learns Alessandro drove the getaway car and demands restitution or face death. Unfortunately, Alessandro doesn't know the robbery was staged to extort his inheritance money because his co-workers think he is inheriting several hundred thousand dollars.

This leads to Alessandro asking Reese to have sex with Bryce so she can steal a rare Abraham Lincoln document that is in the house which Bryce is house-sitting. Alessandro plans to sell it to a local thrift-store owner for $60,000 in cash, who in turn is going to flip it for $100,000. Somehow, the local junk-store owner is plugged into rare document collectors looking for stolen items. Are you laughing?

Then, Alessandro fakes killing Reese but while transporting her body to the recycling center, his car is stolen with her in the trunk. She is held for ransom by the fake drug dealer. Are you following this nonsense? I could continue but the lunacy escalates. It is easy to understand why Reese does not list this in her biography.

Dogstar Films made two other films during 1998 which were released during 1999: Pushing Tin; and, 200 Cigarettes. This was the biggest bomb of the three. It was shot in Bakersfield, Los Angeles and Taft, California plus the Santa Clarita Studios in Santa Clarita, CA, a short drive north of Los Angeles.

Take my advice and make other plans than watching this disaster unless you are a Reese Witherspoon fan. Some reviewers compare this film to those by Quentin Tarantino. Don't be misled.",1330646400,,3282,4.998168498168498

1062898,3,630571486X,"Typical thrillers take a few turns and then lead viewers on an obviously manicured path of eventuality.  Where Best Laid Plans emerges is the same misdirections are used, but enough others are included to satisfy.  Call it quality and quantity.

Lissa (Reese Witherspoon) is an emotional dynamo in this film.  A precocious teen with eyes set on older men, she's independent and available.  Just what Nick (Alessandro Nivola) is looking for in his time of need.  The two bond almost immediately in a statutory, but not creepy, manner.  Soon, however, Nick runs into some trouble and the pair hatch a get rich quick scheme - after Nick was already involved in a drug heist - that doesn't involve selling products to unsuspecting old people.  To compliment the lead pair's efforts, Josh Brolin turns in a neurotic performance and Terrance Howard shows an early flash of talent.  Plans don't always work out as they are designed.  Lissa and Nick's relationship may suffer as a result.

Equally impressive is the style of this movie.  The cinematography is quite artistic, with several angles that propel the film's inertia.  Lighting covers all colors of the rainbow.  Maybe a little 70s disco.  A bit adult film set.  There's definitely flair.  At the very least the film's visual theme is very apparent.

Good, not great.  Semi-predictable at times.  A little overbearing in terms of the dramatic portions, but there are many worse choices.  Watch it for something a bit new, and to see Reese Witherspoon before her chin bone doubled in size.",1302998400,,1540,4.9375
1062899,4,630571486X,"This is a very early move for Witherspoon and Josh Brolin.  The film may not have the best script but the plot and charcters progress enough to make it interesting.  I don't think is a movie to see over and over unless you are a rabid fan of the stars.  The acting is good and actors sell the story, even it does strech the imagination.  In general it is about greed and what people will do to get easy money.",1224288000,,409,4.075
1062900,4,630571486X,"Screenwriter Ted Griffin ('Ocean's Eleven', 'Matchstick Men', 'Rumor Has It', etc) has provided a story for this little film that is successful on many levels: it is a suspenseful mystery, an intelligent look at the Now Generation's unstable approach to life as hopefully handed to them on their parents' goodwill, a mind twister full of surprises, and most of all a metaphor for where we now stand as a consumer world contained in disposable vials.  Working with director Mike Barker's keen sense of timing and comic relief, a fine young cast of notable actors drives this story of desperate turns of fate to an unsuspected ending. The trip is worth your attention.

The nowhere/somewhere town setting is Tropico, a dusty boring little place whose reason for existing is a massive recycling plant for discarded containers - just the right setting for a story about little town people who have discarded their dreams.  Nick (Alessandro Nivola) works in the recycling plant, basing his hopes for something better on the death of his father and the Will through which he plans to gain a comfortable inheritance.  But the Life Insurance policy is negated after an autopsy report reveals a 'preexisting condition' and the remaining assets of his father are owed to the IRS.  Nick is broke and in his low state of esteem agrees to be a driver for a drug heist to make enough money to leave boring Tropico. The heist is a bust and Nick is threatened by the owner of the drug stash that he must come up with a large sum of money or else.  Nick turns to his girlfriend Lissa (Reese Witherspoon) who also wants to leave Tropico and reluctantly agrees to a complex scam against Nick's old college chum Bryce (Josh Brolin).  When that scam falls apart there are even more surprises that keep the story bubbling until the unsuspected conclusion.

Nivola is outstanding in this tricky role and Witherspoon and Brolin are convincing.  Of note there is a very brief role for newcomer Terrence Howard - the film was made in 1999 before some of these actors gained notoriety in the Oscars.  Though not entirely without flaws, this fascinating study of recyclable people enmeshed in their own wayward schemes is an entertaining and stimulating tour de force for all involved. It is well worth a second look! Grady Harp, September 07",1189123200,,2314,4.820707070707071

1062902,4,630571486X,"I must say that 'Best Laid Plans' is in a league of it's own.  I have never seen a movie that took me for the turns this film did, and anyone who says that they guessed the ending is just lying to make their hatred for this movie resonate.  This film may not be perfect, and there are some boring scenes as they try to hard to explain the state Nick is in, but the overall plot of this film is one I've never seen done before.  From the opening scene in the bar when Reese enters till you find her chained up in the basement and she tells Nick ""we're screwed"" you start to realize that what you think you know, you don't...and thats the case throughout this entire movie.  From the start to the finish you have no clue who's involved in what.  When Nick (Nivola) makes the bad choice of stealing some dope with friends and his friends are caught he ends up at the bad end of the gun.  He has just a few days to get $15,000 or he's going to be worse than dead...Then his friend Brice (Brolin) moves back and Nick and Lissa (Witherspoon) come up with a plan, only it backfires, and then they find a way out of it, but that plan backfires and before you know it their back where they started, litterally.  THis movie, for all it's twists and turns and ORIGINALITY, while not being perfect still is a recomended film for anyone who wants to see something fresh and different than the normal popcorn munching drama.  4 1/2 stars.",1142899200,,1424,4.228782287822878
1062903,3,630571486X,"This mostly forgotten thriller starring Reese Witherspoon (Lissa) and Alessandro Nivola (Nick) suffers from a mightily contrived plot and a ""Huh?--What happened?"" ending.  Nick is a guy who works at the local recycling plant (that's a new workplace for celluloid protagonists) who is about to inherit some big bucks from his father who has just kicked the bucket.

Meanwhile some of his coworkers are scheming up a plot to...well, no spoilers here.  Let's just say that the viewer does not find out about this plot until the end, and then it seems a little...well, lame.

Along comes Lissa looking mighty fine and they fall in love, although I must say the chemistry certainly didn't spark up the screen.  Now comes complication number one: the old man blew almost all his money and what he didn't blow the IRS is grabbing.  Because of this Nick gets tempted into driving a get-away car for a drug rip off...  Things go awry and Nick ends up in deep doo-doo, and in desperation gets Lissa to help him rip off an old school chum...which...  Well, what these people do in desperation is a little on the unbelievable side.

I'm sorry that's all vague, but at least it's enough information to let you know if you actually saw this movie or not.  Now, if you like probability-challenged, convoluted plots with loose ends and a lot of unlikely twists and turns, you might find this movie interesting.  And if you like Reese, and you should, you might also find a reason for sticking around until the end.  I know I did.  She does a good job and looks good doing it.

Bottom line: although the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry, it can also be said that the most meticulously contrived plots sometimes turn out about as convincing as pseudoscience.  Incidentally the title is a paraphrase of the 18th century Scottish poet Robert Burns's line: ""The best-laid schemes o' mice an' men/Gang aft a-gley.""",1135641600,,1905,4.695783132530121

1062994,4,630571486X,"At first glance this would appear to be a VERY serious movie.  The opening 1/2 hour or so reminded me of the movie BODY SHOTS, which is a rather disturbing film.  What is most intriguing about this story is that it is a complete farce and the movie seems to change colors like some sort of a chameleon.  What you end up with is something totally different than what you think you're getting in the beginning.

Reese Witherspoon stars once again as a sort-of young girl lost type persona.  She seems to be somewhat typecast for this type of role as in many ways her character is not so different from the ones she portrayed in TWILIGHT and FREEWAY.  While the present film is not quite as off-the-wall as FREEWAY, it is still pretty far out in left-field.

If you're a fan of Reese Witherspoon or films that are on the fringes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, this one might be for you.  While there are many obvious clues during the film as to what's going on, I did not take them seriously enough to figure this plotline out before the final revelation.

1062995,3,630571486X,"Despite an intriguing set-up and attractive cast, this tepid wannabe film noir blows its potential with uneven pacing, idiotic plot twists, and a weak third act. The abrupt, out-of-left-field ending, replete with a half-hearted attempt at a dramatic payoff, only adds insult to injury. The supposedly black comedy that other reviewers mention seemed to have eluded me entirely. The rip-off wave between friends is set up nicely,  but the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the self-consciously stylish cinematography didn't help in getting into them, just leaving a hollowly stylish exterior. A drab and ultimately forgettable film, not a bad way to kill an afternoon perhaps but surely not a keeper.",1080777600,,708,5.378378378378378

This in turn leads to some fishy business that snowballs and the story takes some interesting turns that build up a dynamic plot.

This movie started off kind of slow, which may irk some of the viewers who want to get into it. However, this movie had one of the best and unpredictable endings in a thriller I've ever seen. This alone made the movie worth it.
I thought the young actors, notably Reese Witherspoon, were admirable in their roles. There was not really any bad acting in this movie. The script was well founded, and I thought that this was an original and creative idea.
Many of the twists of the movie are explained through characters actions rather than overt telling of plot sequences. This is a movie that starts a bit of a ways in, then retraces its steps, and then continues on through the movie.

1063002,3,630571486X,"Screenwriter Ted Griffin takes a page out of the David Mamet book with this story of the things we do for love and money, and how desperation has a way of leading even the most forthright among us into regions beyond the known.  And the fact that there is no such animal as a sure thing is pointedly expressed in ""Best Laid Plans,"" a drama/thriller directed by Mike Barker, and starring Reese Witherspoon and Alessandro Nivola.
 The film begins with a meeting in a bar between Nick (Nivola) and Bryce (Josh Brolin), old college chums who have not seen one another since graduation.  Over a few rounds of drinks, they get reacquainted; Bryce is back in town to teach, while Nick has secured employment at the local recycling establishment.  They do the good-to-see-you-again thing, and Nick leaves.  But at about two o'clock in the morning, he gets a call from Bryce, who begs him to come over to his house (actually one he's watching for some friends who are out of town).  Nick doesn't want to go, but Bryce sounds desperate and he can't refuse.  What he finds when he gets there is something totally out of left field.  Suffice to say, it involves a young woman named Lissa (Witherspoon), whom Bryce picked up in the bar just as Nick was leaving.  It's not a pretty situation, and Bryce doesn't know what to do; so it falls to Nick to figure it out.  And now, having crossed that proverbial line in the sand, Nick's involved, too.  Or so it seems.  But then again, maybe there's more to this than meets the eye.  There's just something about this whole set-up that instinctively tells you that what appears to be, ain't necessarily so.  The question is, what is it-- and who is doing what to whom exactly?
 Barker has fashioned a fairly involving film from a story that initially seems somewhat convoluted, but which evolves, and later can actually be regarded as having a plot that is quite intricate and credible, making the comparison to Mamet entirely valid.  The difference between this film and one of Mamet's, however, lies in the fact that Barker simply doesn't have that Mamet touch when it comes to presenting the material.  He does a decent job, but lacks the finesse, the eye for detail and the grasp of what it takes to achieve that necessary sense of mystery that could have taken it to a much higher level.  It lacks that sense of fear and menace, and the urgency it needed to be really effective.  Barker does manage to give you enough to sustain interest, but his pace is wanting; there are moments when the pulse of his film simply flatlines.
 Nivola is clearly the star of the show, and his performance is passable, but he lacks that extra something, that quality, that would have made his character anything special or memorable.  Nick is believable, but too common; there's simply nothing distinctive enough about him to make you care much what happens to him one way or the other.  On one hand, it's good acting-- the character is real-- but he's a guy who leaves you fairly nonplused; he needs a hangnail, as it were, a flaw that would have at least made him interesting.
 Witherspoon gives a good performance, but this character is certainly not a stretch for her, by any means.  Lissa, like Nick, is rather nondescript, and Witherspoon does little to spark much interest in her.  In her defense, however, Barker really doesn't afford her the time nor the opportunity to do much exploring by way of characterization.  But she is watchable, and fans of hers, especially, will no doubt find her work here satisfying.
 As Bryce, Josh Brolin is disappointing, giving a one-note performance that is flat and forced.  Granted, his character is supposed to be something of a nerd, but he puts nothing into it; a bit of nuance would have done wonders for his portrayal, and it's the kind of character that is ripe with opportunity, like a blank canvas just waiting to be shaded and textured.  But Brolin dropped the ball, and Bryce ends up being completely forgettable.
 The supporting cast includes Gene Wolande (Lawyer), Jonathan McMurtry (Vet), Rocky Carroll (Bad Dude), Jamie Marsh (Barry), Michael McCleery (Recycling Owner), Michael G. Hagerty (Charlie), Terrence Dashon Howard (Jimmy) and Sean Nepita (Freddie).  A very average movie, but with enough twists and turns to keep it interesting, ""Best Laid Plans"" nevertheless comes off as inexplicably lackluster, given the storyline.  This one had the potential of being a real edge-of-your-seater, but instead fails to stir the blood much at all.  Performances aside, the story alone makes it worth a look; just don't expect too much.  It takes some effort to get into it initially, and by the end you'll be reflecting on what a great movie this ""almost"" was.",1014076800,,4733,4.752753977968176

The movie simply takes too long to get to the point.  The story is not fast paced enough to keep your attention.

I've seen Reese Witherspoon in enough movies to know she's a great actress, and it sounded interesting enough from reading the jacket. BUT, I have to say that, overall, although the film was visually stunning more often than not (very stylized sets, nice color combinations, costume colors, interesting shots, etc, etc), and the two main characters Nick (Alessandro Nivola) and Lissa (Reese Witherspoon) were likable, the film isn't much to write home about. My main complaint is that there wasn't enough plot to go around, and that when the chips finally fall, you're wondering why there weren't more of them! I also wonder why the  writer (or director/editor), who ended up with a decent budget, nice sets, great actors, etc, didn't do more to flesh it out, or add a couple more twists/characters/background info. I think this quite easily could have been made into a great film. However, as it stands, its a stylish jaunt into film-making which, although not precisely shallow, per se, leaves a lot to be desired. Interestingly, after watching the deleted scenes and learning a bit more about the script and the changes that were made to the story/scenes, the film seemed richer and more complex, (better!) than I'd first thought. I think the DVD's deleted scenes really would have added enough to make this luke-warm film, not great, but maybe ""good enough."" The best thematic elements which explain the ""why's"" and ""why-nots"" of this film, inexplicably seemed to end up on the cutting room floor.

This is movie is sooo desperate to be a post modern crime thriller that it looks and feels so  relentlessly superficial. Most scenes are decked out in unpleasant pastel  colors and interiors are always lit with warm lights. Not very realistic.  Something else that is quite unreal is the scene in which Nivola and  Witherspoon discuss their forthcoming crime...on a roof in front of a neon  sign on a sofa. Yeah...like people keep sofas on roofs in front of neon  signs. This was obviously an attempt by the director to add a little  sparkle to an otherwise BORING scene. Which is also the reason he throws in  some cliched camera angles. It's a ""film noir"" you see...so  diagonal shots on an ordinary scene are standard. Composer Craig Armstrong  was obviously hired at the last minute when the director heard the score  for Romeo and Juliet to provide an irrating and superficial (that word  again) soundtrack. It sounds like it belongs in a totally different movie.
One last gripe...the ""twist"" was obvious to me. I guess it at  the very start and the whole thing was SOOO predictable. It had the  predictablity curve of paint drying and the interest curve of cleaning a  300-year-old stove with a 3-haired tooth brush and some spit. I also felt  no chemistry between the 2 leads whatsoever.
In case your wondering my  girlfriend lists this as number 2 in her top 3 movies. Number 1 is Devils  Advocate and 3 is Moonwalker...ugh!",956448000,,1553,4.710037174721189
1063128,4,630571486X,"I really enjoyed this film noir story about hopeless people taking desperate measures to try to wriggle out of the trouble wrought by their bad luck and foolish acts.  Ted Griffin's screenplay is first rate with  numerous unexpected plot twists and ironies.  I defy anyone to outguess all  the curves he throws.  What is noticeable about the plot is that it was  very realistic.  The schemes were hair brained, but it was believable that  the numbskull characters portrayed would cook up these kinds of  cons.
Mike Barker's direction was very good.  He was visually daring and  unconventional with liberal use of tight shots and extreme close-ups that  were mostly effective.  He was a little too enamored with these techniques  though, and used them to excess.  Such shots are good to emphasize certain  emotions or to add impact, but Barker has the viewer in the actors' faces  more often than your average teenage lovers.  After a while the whole film  has the feeling of watching characters with giant heads.  Yet, this is a  minor criticism for what was mostly a very good directorial effort.
The  weakest aspect of the film was the acting which was mediocre though not  terrible.  Alessandro Nivola gave a lifeless performance as the hapless  Nick desperately scheming for a way out of his small town.  He came across  too wimpy and flaccid for the daring character who was planning this  elaborate rip off.
Reese Witherspoon was mostly window dressing in this  film.  Though she did a reasonable job with her character, the part did not  have much meat to it as she was relegated to the role of sycophantic girl  friend, a victim of her own weakness and bad judgment.
Josh Brolin was  the weak link.  His interpretation of his character's emotion is mostly  measured by how loud he yells at the camera.  Since his character was in  hot water through most of the film, he was mostly screaming his lines at  the top of his lungs.  His portrayal was like surgery performed with a  chain saw.
The best performance of the film goes to Rocky Carroll as the  intimidating drug dealer who threatens to kill Nick for swiping his money.  Carroll stole every scene he was in with high energy  performances.
Overall, I gave this film a 7/10.  The acting was not  compelling but it was not so dreadful that it detracted from a terrific  story and a well crafted film by Barker.",955843200,,2371,4.714987714987715
1063129,3,630571486X,"Just as American Beauty was overwhelmingly red, The End of The Affair overwhelmingly green, the photography of Best Laid Plans makes it an overwhelmmingly brown looking movie, which greatly helps creat a mood of  the brooding thriller that it aspires to be.
  The film has the  ingredients of a film noir. The lovers, the fall guy, the dead-end town,  the mess the hero gets himself into. Thankfully the film has a heart in its  centre in the form of the wonderful actor Allesandro Nevola. You may  remember him as Castor Troy's brother in Face Off, you can also see him  sporting two different(and perfect) English accents in I Want You (terrible  film) and Mansfield Park(average film), but he's a an actor to watch. His  character Nick is a deeply intelligent, quiet and observant young man with  financial troubles. He is a person we can root for even when his actions  start to become criminal, and in that way he similar to the main character  of A SIMPLE PLAN Hank, i.e. good people doing bad things.
  Unfortunatley  the movie is not as serious as Nivola and has two major flaws. The first  which is near fatal is the structure, the completely unnessecary time shift  gimmeckery makes it seem like a rip-off of the much better Pulp Fiction and  Usual Suspects, it has absolutley no reason for existing. The second flaw  is Josh Brolin as Brice, he seems like a brute. I know his character is  meant to be one, but wouldn't it have been more intresting to have a real  human being as the fall guy rather then this loud annoying oaf of a guy.
  We then come to the ending of the film which is ludicrous,  lightweight and an illfit to the more hard edged stuff that has gone  before. In truth the film as a whole never lives up Allesandro's terrific  performance, the moody photography, or that intense musical score. Rent  this movie for an entertaining evening alone, but sadly its not worth a  purchase.",955756800,,1911,4.604166666666667
1063130,4,630571486X,"This film was much better than I expected. I was expecting some mediocre teen movie but this is stunning. A great simple story: a couple try to rip someone off to pay back a debt. What could be simpler? How about when  everything goes wrong? Do not want to give anything away but this story had  a great and unexpected twist. The build up is very convincing and even when  you think the story is going down one alley, it doesn't.
Reese  Witherspoon and Alessandro Nivola are wonderful as the lovers trying to get  out of Tropico: a dead end town and Josh Brolin does a convincing job as a  hysterical up and coming yuppie who thinks he has committed the ultimate  crime.
There are plenty of magic elements: the economics-major thug  professing Adam Smith as a justification for violence, Nivola's way of  avoiding a TV advert giving the game away and the cause of the brushfire  are just three.
Watch this and enjoy the treat and if you see it on DVD  see if you agree that the alternate ending is much better: positive but not  as upbeat.",954201600,,1039,4.439153439153439

7893396,3,630571486X,"A solid eighties-feel film, which ensures the plot device in amongst the intertwining sub-plots, is tied up neatly, only then to be unraveled,  thus delivering closure. And whilst the film doesn't necessarily give the characters gravity in any generous amount,  one is still left thinking over their situation, afterwards, for better or worse. The main cast of three are well chosen and there are other notable actors in there too. The film is geared towards surprises but it doesn't disappoint - on the whole it is a far-fetched story but if one looks beyond realism then the film as a complete package is quite effective. A remake of this film would be an interesting prospect by someone such as Tarantino. If you want a reasonably light yet entertaining film to watch maybe before sitting to something a little more heavyweight then this is the film to start you off in an evening of film binge-watching.",1477612800,,907,4.84516129032258

7893401,3,630571486X,"Best Laid Plans has a wonderful idea that's executed awkwardly.  It's about a man (Josh Brolin) who panics and kidnaps/chains a girl (Reese Witherspoon's character) in his basement after she claims rape.  He doesn't want to go to jail and have his teaching education thrown away after Reese runs to the cops, so Jason invites his friend over (Alessandro Nivola) so they can try and figure out what to do about the girl.  At first the storyline was incredibly interesting, and it starts right away so don't miss the first 3 minutes of the movie.  So how can it go wrong?  By temporarily abandoning it 10 minutes later and going back 4 months earlier in time to show how the characters got to this point.

For the next 45 minutes, the story takes a MAJOR turn and focuses on Alessandro and Reese being part of a sophisticated drug heist.  This is not only disappointing because it steps away from the main story so it makes the description for the film somewhat misleading, but it's also told in a very banal, pretentious and uninteresting way that doesn't make the characters or story entertaining in the slightest.  It's also a bit confusing because it suddenly introduces a new set of characters.  Some of this stuff even leans towards teenage drama.  Bad idea to show a lot of Reese Witherspoon and her emotional state.  However after the nearly unwatchable 45-minute mark the story returns to the original part with Reese chained to the basement and Alessandro coming up with a plan to remove the girl in a way that convinces Josh that she's dead.

However Josh is a very clueless person.  It's a bit weird seeing Josh Brolin play such a character.  He's usually mature, smarter and focused, but here he portrays a bundle of nerves.  It's awkward.  He's so nervous about what to do with the girl he almost unintentionally ruins Alessandro's plan to help Reese escape.  This part of the writing is VERY good.  More characters are introduced after the two load Reese's body in the trunk, and all the characters all linked together in a way that makes the story and conclusion more clever.  It's just the 45 minutes in the middle that involves the drug heist that totally stinks.  If that entire piece of the story had been removed, and had the story continued in a direction that didn't step away from the main plot, Best Laid Plans could've been amazing.  As it is, it's flawed.  It's true that there's moments of cleverness in the plot twists (especially the final 10 minutes) but it could've been told better.",1443657600,,2513,4.676537585421412

Rated R, but with a made for cable TV vibe, this is a decent, but probably not particularly memorable thriller.
