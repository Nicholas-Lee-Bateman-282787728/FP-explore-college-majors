7968184,2,B00006G8GG,Terrible. Dated and not very interesting. I couldn't watch it. I couldn't show it to students. I might use it for detention.,1412726400,,124,4.681818181818182
7968185,4,B00006G8GG,"The DVD covers a wide range of subjects with animation and video footage taken at places of interest.  It makes places more interesting to visit after viewing the DVD.

The program material seems not to be aimed at the college or university student of geology and does not contain in depth information about earth processes, minerals, plate tectonics etc. It is recommended for a person who is interested in geology but does not want to get in to much detail. It is informative, interesting and relaxing to watch.

The presentation is a bit dry and although to the point may be experienced as boring by a school class.
I was pleasantly surprised by the choice of background music. It is lovely to listen to without unduly drawing the attention of the viewer.",1346371200,,758,4.7272727272727275
7968186,1,B00006G8GG,"You would expect so much better from the scientists of the USGS. Pretty much a waste of tax payer money to produce such a video. It has very little ""meat"" (educational information) and it is so, so boring to put even a teacher to sleep. I have taught junior high to junior college earth science and I am not sure where you could use this video. In the future I would recommend that the USGS stick to science or at least not allow others to use their name to sell products.",1273276800,,472,4.197802197802198
7968187,3,B00006G8GG,"I bought this video to show to my 8th grade science class. It is very informative and covers a vast array of topics that relate to our curriculum, but the delivery is very dry. The narrator speaks almost in monotone. It is full of great information that will benefit the students if they could stay focused. I was told by many students ""Miss, this is soooo boring!"".",1236297600,8,366,4.477611940298507
7968188,4,B00006G8GG,"After having visited so many national parks in the US, I start to get interested in the making and shaping of these fantastic landscapes, which is the reason I bought this DVD.

The best thing when I watch this DVD is that I've been to most of the places shown in this film, including Mt Rainier, Mt St Helens, Yosemite, Grand Teton, Yellowstone, Bryce Canyon, Arches, Olympic, Grand Canyon....... When it explains the geological terms or activities such as subduction, mantle, crust, plate tectonics, earthquakes, volcanoes and glaciers, I can comprehend them in an enjoyable way. Everything is vivid to me.

In my opinion, geology is best studied when you have some field experience. If you are a national park lover just like me, you will enjoy the knowledge this film brings to you.",1200960000,22,786,4.858208955223881
