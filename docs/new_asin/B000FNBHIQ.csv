8124779,4,B000FNBHIQ,"Alfred Hitchcock: Jamaica Inn, Sabotage, The 39 Steps, Easy Virtue

These four movies are from pre WW II era; only two are ""talkies"".
These two make this package worthwhile.

1) Jamaica Inn When her parents die, Mary is sent to Cornwall, England to live with her Aunt Patience and Uncle Joss. Uncle Joss is the owner and proprietor of the Jamaica Inn, a seemingly normal business. However, Mary soon discovers that all is not what it seems: her uncle is a leader of a gang of pirates who lure ships to their doom on a rocky coast. When Mary discovers the truth, though, she begins to fear for her life. This early classic from the master of suspense is adapted froma novel by Daphne Du Maurier and features screen legend Charles Laughton.

2) Sabotage Mr. Verloc leads an unassuming life as the manager of a small cinema. At least, that's what his wife and brother in law think. What they don't know is that Mr. Verloc is actually part of a gang of saboteurs. When Scotland Yard assigns a detective to work next door to the cinema, Mr. Verloc's life takes a dramatic turn in this tense, edge of your seat thriller. Adapted from a novel by Conrad.

3) The 39 Steps In the London music hall, Canadian tourists Richard Hannay is enjoying a production of Mr. Memory. Just before it ends, however, there is a disturbance in the hall and Richard's life becomes intertwined with that of Annabella Smith, a woman on the run from a spy ring. He agrees to protect her, but later that night, she is murdered. Fearing he will be accused of the crime, Richard goes on the run to bring down the spy ring and prove his innocence. Like ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", this is the film that made Hitchcock a household name.

4) Easy Virtue Larita Filton has just had her life turned upside down, a scandalous divorce case and subsequent suicide have left her with scorn of the community. She escapes to France where she meets John Whittaker and they fall in love. When John's family finds out her secret, though, Larita may be in for more than she'd ever bargained for.",1427328000,,2049,4.497311827956989
8124780,3,B000FNBHIQ,"First of all ... this disk couldn't possibly be new.  I opened it and it was very scratched up (it was sealed).

Second, we watched only Jamaica Inn and it was missing a few parts; we still could understand the story, but there were very obvious parts spliced out of the original film.  The quality was like any very old film ... it took me some time to adjust to the rugged black and white and the sound (we had to turn it up loud to understand it).

Their were 2 films on each side of the disk (different than another reviewer).

I am going to debate on sending this back.  It was only $3.50, but I would really like a version that has the entire Jamaica Inn on it.  I bought this CD mainly for that movie.",1364428800,2,708,4.086956521739131
8124781,1,B000FNBHIQ,Don't waste your money. Lousy prints with 4 films on one single sided disc. Avoid! Got it for 2.50 and that was too much.,1355443200,2,121,4.083333333333333
8124782,5,B000FNBHIQ,"""Jamaica Inn"" - The talent combined in this 1939 film is immense. Based on a novel by Daphne Du Maurier, Alfred Hitchcock - in the last of the early British films before he started making films in the U.S. - skillfully directs an extraordinary cast, all turning in strong performances that bring the characters depth and the story to life. Maureen O'Hara is amazing in her first feature role, showing us way back then what made her the great star she has been all these years. It also stars other great British actors Leslie Banks, Emlyn Williams and Robert Newton. But it is the legendary Charles Laughton who you can't take your eyes off of in this thriller. The depth with which he portrays his multi-faceted character is simply awesome.

The story is set off a rugged coastline. A group of dangerous cut-throats are misguiding innocent vessels, causing them to crash into the rocky terrain,so they can loot all the cargo. When young and beautiful Mary(O'Hara)is on to them, she risks life and limb to try and stop them. She turns to the only one she can trust...Sir Humphrey Pengallan(Laughton)for help. But yikes!... has she even endangered herself further with this move? He may be the most deranged of all!

Where's Hitch?....Although he made an appearance in the one before this one(""The Lady Vanishes""/1938) and the one after(""Rebecca""/1940), he seems to have eluded us in this one!

""Easy Virtue"" - This was a silent made in 1927.
Don't look for suspense or horror in this one. It's a great drama though, and you'll still recognize Hitchcock's signature in it.
Larita is an innocent woman whose name and reputation is dragged through the mud after a nasty divorce. The publicity of it all makes her infamous. She tries to start her life anew, marries and must deal with some very nasty mother-in-law problems while trying to live down her notoriety. It is based on a play by Noel Coward and the score is newly recorded. Isabel Jeans plays the misunderstood woman in question.
Where's Hitch: You got me!. I can't say that I saw him in this one, although I did spy a portly man in a suit walking off a tennis court(very strange) but Only from the back soooo....

Sylvia Sydney, who graced the screen for more than 70 years stars in ""Sabotage"". Younger viewers may remember Miss Sydney as ""Juno"" in Beetlejuice"" or ""Grandma"" in ""Mars Attacks"". If you have never seen any of her earlier works(this one from 1936), you are in for a real treat. In this terrific thriller she is Mrs. Verloc, a lovely woman who is slowly becoming suspicious of her husband's(Oscar Homolka) strange activities. And with good reason, he is involved in a deadly conspiracy.

It is the eve of WWII, and people in Britain are becoming aware of Nazi activity. Various occurrences of Sabotage seem to be popping up around the cities. Small at first, a black out is the first sign, but when a bomb explodes and kills everyone on a bus, the evidence points to Mr. Verloc. Scotland Yard detective Ted Spencer(John Loder), is on the case and must catch the culprit before he kills again. And of course, along the way falls for the beautiful Mrs. Verloc. Hitch does a great job(as always) at keeping us involved with the characters, the story, and keeping the suspense going. You'll recognize his signature traits all through the film. ""Sabotage"" is based on a novel by Joseph Conrad who also wrote ""Heart of Darkness"".

Next is one of his masterpieces! From 1935 - ""The Thirty Nine Steps"" has Hitch's trademark style all through it. An innocent man gets involved with spies and counter spies. He is at the music hall, watching a ""Memory Act""(which is quite a scene in itself), there's a gun shot, panic erupts and everyone runs out. A mysterious woman attaches herself to him and comes home with him. She reveals she is spy and others are after her. She mentions the mysterious ""Thirty Nine Steps"", and the next morning he finds her dead. He goes on the run for fear he will be implicated in the murder and in order to prove his innocence he must uncover this spy ring on his own. His path is fraught with danger, suspense and of course a beautiful woman. It stars Robert Donat, Madeline Carroll - you know how Hitch loved those beautiful cool blondes!, and Lucie Mannheim(as Annabela the spy). Also look for his trademark staircase scene.
Looking for Hitch: Less than 10 minutes in, you'll spy him. What a litter bug!

I have these films on various DVDs from various studios. Although not always pristine, I have found the the BCI/Eclipse label is a good buy for the money, especially for those who are not too fussy about these very old and vintage films. Surf around for various editions and deals.

If you love these oldies, you may enjoy his first ""talkie"": Blackmail

Get the popcorn ready for a thrilling time with Hitch, and
Happy Trails.....Laurie",1345507200,,4831,4.700945626477542
8124783,4,B000FNBHIQ,"The DIGIVIEW Hitchcock DVD 4-fer contains vintage movies of varying technical quality. A single flip disc stored in a slimline case comes with no literature or extras beyond synopses on the back cover.

JAMAICA INN is the best dub here. A clean, sharp image and incredibly clear, almost hifi sound make this one a pleasure to watch.

SABOTAGE has softer, slightly-dark video that's still fairly clean and an audio track of lower fidelity. Still watchable, though.

Audio on THE 39 STEPS is badly over-modulated. Recorded at way-too high levels, reducing volume only dulls the din and a roaring hiss; it doesn't remove much distortion. Visually, this one's similar to SABOTAGE: clean, slightly soft.

EASY VIRTUE is obviously a multi-generation copy. There's no true black here, only shades of gray. The picture's slighly cropped and there's a constantly jittering frame. Most startling is a lack of added music, just deafening silence.

A superior copy of JAMAICA INN makes this low-priced item a bargain, and thus recommended. Consider the other three titles a gift.",1255305600,6,1067,5.180232558139535
8124784,4,B000FNBHIQ,"This DVD includes four good, but lesser known films directed by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. The four films are:

JAMAICA INN--based upon a story by Daphne Du Maurier and starring Charles Laughton, it tells the story about a young orphaned Irish woman trying to connect with her last remaining family member, but finds herself at the heart of a organized crime syndicate instead.

SABOTAGE--based upon a story by Joseph Conrad, SABOTAGE is a spy film about a foreign agent seeking to bring terror to the heart of London.

THE 39 STEPS--a spy thriller about a Canadian tourist that gets swept into espionage after attending a performance of a show with a man who seems to have an uncanny memory for facts.

EASY VIRTUE--a silent film based upon a play by Noel Coward about a young woman who is publicly disgraced and divorced by her husband after he accuses her of adultery with a young artist. Their relationship was innocent friendship, but the artist commits suicide. The divorce trial leaves the Mrs. Filton a marked woman and forces her to seek a new life for herself in France.

Though the films are on this DVD collection are lesser known, they are a good sampling illustrating how great a talent Hitchcock was. My only complaint about the collection is that some of the films are apparently taken from slightly damaged negatives which affects the audio and in a few places the visual quality of the productions (especially the visuals in EASY VIRTUE). Still, this is a great collection and if a person has never seen these films you can't beat the price.

Recommended for people interested in seeing some of Hitchcock's earlier work, but if you're a serious film student you'll probably want to check out single edition DVDs of these films that are better quality.",1191110400,,1784,4.813725490196078
