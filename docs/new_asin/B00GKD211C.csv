8624046,4,B00GKD211C,"Bruce Robinson (James McAvoy) is working for a promotion. The film starts with some first person narration as we see Bruce as the idea man for the job. However we soon discover that Bruce is out of control and works to destroy his fellow detectives in order to ensure he gets the promotion. As Bruce spirals down in his psychotic world, the film becomes darker. This dark comedy had scenes which gave me flashbacks to ""Clockwork Orange"" although the films really have nothing in common. And oh yes, they are looking for the killers of a Japanese male student.

This quirky film features ample helping of sex and nudity.",1392854400,,619,4.678899082568807
