1976441,5,B00018HUI6,I've seen some episodes on PBS and thought I might like the entire series .... and I did. Big Richard Briers fan aand he's at his best.,1368835200,,135,4.037037037037037
1976442,4,B00018HUI6,"After my favourite comedy, The Good Life, this one took a bit of getting used to. But after just 3 episodes I was laughing out loud. Richard Briers and the stoic Penelope Wilton give us the believable performance of a suburban couple with a life that would bore most of us to death.
The dashing Peter Egan plays the charmer next door who gets his jollies by mocking Richard Briers' character, albeit in a good humoured way.
There's a lot to like about this series and the 6 disc set makes it good value.",1351900800,4,503,4.361702127659575
1976443,5,B00018HUI6,"This series reunited Richard Briers with the writing team responsible for ""The Good Life"" (""Good Neighbors"" in the U. S.), John Esmonde and Bob Larbey.  Add in Harold Snoad (responsible for some of the best of ""Are You Being Served"") as director of some episodes and it's hard to go wrong.

Like ""The Good Life"", this is an ensemble comedy deriving it's humour from the relationships between the main characters.  This time it's Richard Briers as Martin who plays the odd man out as he compulsively arranges charity drives, neighbourhood watches, and lives.

The arrival of new neighbour Paul, played by Peter Egan, who can't help being better at just about everything brings out Martin's innate insecurities and results in hilarious consequences. Penelope Wilton is wonderful as Martin's wife who constantly struggles to bring Martin's good qualities to the fore.

All four series and both Christmas specials are featured in this complete collection on six disks.  Special features include commentary by the the three stars on six of the episodes as well as interviews with Richard Briers and Richard Egan.

What a shame this has not been released in the U. S.  Don't miss this if you have a region-free DVD player, but be warned that it won't play on a standard U. S. machine.

8007812,4,B00018HUI6,"The DVDs are great.  They arrived on time and were packaged well.  They are for region 2, which I know does not play on a regular DVD player.  But I have a DVD player which says it plays region 2, however, these won't play on it.  I have to play them on my computer.  It's fine, but I wish there had been something about that in the information before I bought them.",1483747200,,366,4.027777777777778

8007814,3,B00018HUI6,"A bit disappointed; Briers doesn't sparkle here as usual.  Perhaps it's the writing?  Everyone in the cast is great, though.",1442534400,,124,5.15
8007815,5,B00018HUI6,"This is an absolutely first-rate comedy series.  If you like Fawlty Towers and The Norman Conquests, this is your cup of English tea.  The writing is brilliant (Bob Larbey and an associate), the acting couldn't be better, and virtually every program is a memorable gem.  Bravo!",1436486400,,277,4.978260869565218
