8411769,5,B00402FGPI,I love the old musicals.  It is a fun way to spend an evening.,1521504000,,62,3.4285714285714284
8411770,4,B00402FGPI,"Bought this to get ""Absolute Beginners"", a movie otherwise hard to find. Reminiscent of ""Streets of Fire"" with its stylized dancing and street fighting. Set in the beginning of the Mod era in London. Racist overtones. This has the look of a ""cult"" film. ""Without You I'm Nothing"", some ""comedienne"" talking dirty and prancing about naked. Haven't watched the other two movies, probably never will.",1486771200,,397,5.123076923076923

8411772,5,B00402FGPI,"A great collection at a bargain price. I bought this as a gift, primarily for Absolute Beginners (a fun romp with a super cast and music) when I found AB is currently OOP and available only at premium prices...........when received, we were delighted to find the Robert England version of The Phantom of the Opera also in the set! Wow.......DOUBLE PLAY!  As with most MGM titles in the bargain series, this is understandably ""no frills"", but audio and video content are top shelf. Fine set at a nice price, just the ticket to MMMBOP away any summer time blues!",1466812800,,560,4.656565656565657

8411774,3,B00402FGPI,"This is an interesting collection of 4 almost-musical failures released by MGM in the late '80s -'90s. MGM was decades ago the great home for musicals; there's no touch of the old magic in these experiments.

THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is the least interesting of the four, though it often looks lush: while pretty and a tolerable singer, the lead actress (she reminds me of Phoebe Cates) lacks charm and character.  Robert Englund, better known as Freddy from the NIghtmare on Elm Street films makes an adequate hammy villain. This movie has nothing to do with the long running Broadway musical. I remember only one original song with one verse which is repeated over and over and over again. On the other hand, this may be my favorite Menahem Golan-produced film, ever.

ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS is a more ambitious failure, probably much more costly, too.  I'd heard the title mentioned for years but never had a chance to see it. It's supposed to be about the teenagers and music of a few blocks in London in 1958, and it ends up in race riots, but the story is all a muddle and for me at least the songs did not stick with me.  David Bowie and Ray Davies are among the rock names doing ineffective acting bits -- Bowie sings 2 or 3 songs, too.  The film is shot with a neon-bright palette, the sets are imaginative, and there's real effort put into some of the  dance choreography, but it's the inept director who really earns the label of ""Absolute Beginner.""

WITHOUT YOU I'M NOTHING is a sort of Sandra Bernhard concert film, but I'm not sure Sandra Bernhard actually has a Vegas act.  A great part of the film is deliberately showing the audience reacting badly or indifferently to her inappropriate performance bits. Black patrons are clearly offended by this white jewish girls takes on Dianna Ross and Carribean Big Mamas.  Bernhard is not traditionally pretty or an exceptional singer --- if there's too much of anything here it's her singing schlocky version  of popular tunes. She challenges club patrons, and teases the home audience to think more deeply than real concert films, too. It's hard to really like her but she's never boring.

THE SADDEST MUSIC IN THE WORLD is an unique film made with great imagination on a obviously skimpy budget by director Guy Maddin -- a very strange and comic fable, a musical with an Eraserhead mentality.  The acting is often on an Ed Wood level, but Saddest Music is a visually sophisticated and fetching film.  Isabella Rosellini looks a lot like her mother (Ingrid Bergman) here, and some fevered night I will dream of her beer-filled glass legs.

If you wanted to watch only one of these movies and feel you've gotten your money's worth, this is the one!",1417305600,3,2704,4.675105485232067
