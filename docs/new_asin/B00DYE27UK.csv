5878977,5,B00DYE27UK,"Never in all my life has music impacted me so strongly!  From the first song to the last,  ""Revealing Jesus""  has me hooked! Each song does exactly what the album title states - each song proclaims truths about Jesus Christ. ""In Jesus' Name"" (song #4) is so powerful and stays on repeat for at least 3 times through.  If you're dealing with sickness or depression or death,  blast this song in your car and in your house. Sing it and declare it until you believe it!  There is power in the name of Jesus! You absolutely will not regret purchasing this album and dvd.",1427673600,,566,4.394230769230769

5878984,5,B00DYE27UK,"Love this CD and DVD!  Truly a work of love for the Lord!  Be blessed and brought into His presence with this beautiful music!  Darlene Zschech, Israel Houghton, Michael W. Smith and Kari Jobe all on one CD and DVD in live worship---not to be missed.  The other gifted and talented musicians all have parts as well and are excellent.  Powerful songs....absolutely love them all!  If I had to pick my favorites, In Jesus' Name and Victor's Crown are stunners.  When you see and hear In Jesus' Name, and I recently learned that Darlene is undergoing treatment for breast cancer,  you are just blown away.  Yours Forever is beautiful as is Your Presence is Heaven.  Also love God is Here, Best for Me, All that We Are, I could list them all! I play this all day whenever I can.  So in awe of the Lord with these songs! Thank you, Darlene, Israel and Kari for revealing Jesus to us!",1403827200,2,878,4.425
