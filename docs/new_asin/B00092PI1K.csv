As of the time i purchased this, There was ONE copy available, and not even ebay had anything remotely close to a TINTIN boxed set. So if they ever pop up again, freaking BUY THEM.

NOTE: After four years of owning the boxed set, i discovered that the French dvd art on each disc is REVERSIBLE IN ENGLISH. The under-side of the paper insert on each case is the english cover art. You are welcome for discovering that.",1299369600,,518,4.232323232323233
8056759,4,B00092PI1K,"All the Tintin DVDs (all together 21 adventures) are avaiable in www.amazon.co.uk site in ENGLISH, with reasonable price. These are brand new and original DVDs. I received my order in 7 days by airmail. Why will you pay so much money to buy ""USED"" DVDs??

The UK DVDs are of Region-2 - but most of the recent DVD players, specially the cheaper one, can now play DVDs of any region - with no problem!!",1126396800,3,400,4.405405405405405
8056760,4,B00092PI1K,"Tintin is by far the most amazing cartoon character created in the past 100 years. Not only for the characters but also for the degree of accuracy by which Herge depicted the 20th century in his books. This also applies to the cartoon series, which first aired in the early 90's.

This series, re-made after a series of disasterous 60's cartoons which totally ruined the spirit and the storyline of the books ( with the exception of ""The lake of Sharks"")does extremely well in capturing not only Herge's  ""clear line"" art style,but also follows the books very strictly. When I watched the epsiodes in English, I was happy to find that all the voices were well chosen. This applies especially to Captain Haddock, whose voice is perfect, and doesn't sound like a 17th Century drunken pirate as he did in the older trashier 60's cartoons.

The only reason I dropped a star ( although this series deserves 6 out of 5 stars) is the fact that it doesn't include all the episodes ( the amazon.co.uk site does have the entire collection). But overall it is a must see for all Tintin and Cartoon lovers.",1123286400,3,1094,4.628865979381444
8056761,5,B00092PI1K,"This is a much-awaited boxed set of the Adventures of Tintin that originally showed (in the USA) on HBO during the 1990s.  This set contains ten adventures on five DVDs.  All are high-quality.  A second set, containing 10 additional adventures, is scheduled to be released this fall.

Please note that this set is available directly from Amazon. Ca (Amazon of Canada) at the usual excellent Amazon price.  There's no need to pay a surcharge to a re-seller.  I ordered it through Amazon.ca and had it, at my home in the US, within a week.",1120348800,,537,4.659574468085107
