7022600,3,B00TULHP26,Received this today. Discs won't play on Bluray or DVD players. Not a happy camper!!!!!,1428537600,14,87,4.866666666666666
7022601,2,B00TULHP26,I just received The Crazy Ones Season 1 DVD today and none of the discs play on my Blu-ray player or DVD player. The message that pops up read discs can not play. I have bought many manufactured on demand DVDs from Amazon and this is the first time I have encountered discs not playing at all. Anyone who receives unplayable discs for this title should contact Amazon right away.,1428364800,28,379,4.428571428571429
7022602,5,B00TULHP26,Can't wait for this! I love Sarah Michelle Gellar!,1427932800,,50,4.666666666666667
7022603,5,B00TULHP26,"I miss this show. One of my favorite comedies that was on last year.
Sarah Michelle, James wolk, Hamish linkater, Amanda Sutton and the wonderfully talent Robin Williams who  was a delight to watch with the rest of the cast.
Totally getting this when it comes out.",1425168000,4,264,4.617021276595745
7022604,5,B00TULHP26,"I'm very pleased to say my 4th DVD set received yesterday all plays!  I got it mega quick - 3 days which is faster than some UK orders I do.  I'm really happy how Amazon treated me during the unfortunate circumstances of the discs not working.  I was fully refunded each time and treated very well.  I've started on disc 2 and continue to enjoy this rather quirky, fun show.  Of course the real draw for me is Robin Williams.  Its great to watch him in something I haven't seen before, as I've now got through all his films.  I think Pam Dawber who played Mindy is in a later episode but haven't reached it yet.  I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of the episodes.  I saw disc 1 a few weeks earlier when I was one of those people that had that one working when the others weren't.  I'm glad to have this series; it will keep me going while we have a long wait for the next Robin Williams release - Boulevard which I'm hoping/forecasting will come out by Christmas.",1424995200,3,968,4.240437158469946
7022605,5,B00TULHP26,"I can't wait to have this treasure in my hands!
My beloved Robin, I wish you could know how much you are loved and missed by millions.
You touched so many souls and brought so much laughter and joy to this sometimes real ugly
world, I miss you like crazy, you are forever in our hearts til we meet again.
I am happy, that we will have this funny show on DVD real soon.",1424822400,16,368,3.9864864864864864
7022606,5,B00TULHP26,"What a funny, light hearted show that was canceled before it was ever given a real chance, but that's television for you. The big reason people like me don't invest time into tv shows anymore is because we literally fall in love with these characters only to have you kill them off for not bringing the audiences needed to demand obscene amounts of ad dollars. I have no desire to be a part of that sick game anymore. I stick to Netflixing my old favorites, and no longer even have basic cable, that is how much I despise that game. Thanks for killing cable!",1424736000,9,558,4.375
7022607,3,B00TULHP26,"Not a perfect show, although it's got Robin Williams in it so what's not to love?  That's based on the first 8 episodes.  I can't say anything about the rest of the series because the copy I got wouldn't play.  This product is a DVD-R, not a real DVD and as such you may well encounter problems.  I bought this through Warehouse Deals, Inc. and they only give you 30 days to return the product.  Unfortunately, I was busy when this arrived and didn't get a chance to start watching until after the 30 day window.  That's when I discovered that 2 of the 3 discs would not play in any of my DVD or BluRay players.  I couldn't even manage to read them on my computer's disk drive.  So I'm stuck with 2 coasters along with one sort-of-playable disk (disk 1 has a dead spot in the middle but otherwise plays).  If you take a chance, check the playability of your copy immediately.  Looks like I'm out the cost of the disc.  So much for Amazon Prime's customer satisfaction!",1455840000,2,968,4.322222222222222
7022608,5,B00TULHP26,"A wonderful show and the last we'll see of the incomparable Robin Williams.  The entire ensemble cast is great, which is saying something considering they have to hold their own on screen with Williams.  It's a shame it was cancelled (prior to Williams' death) as I can only imagine it would have gotten better as it really found its stride in future seasons.",1455408000,,359,4.682539682539683
7022609,4,B00TULHP26,"The DVD set is bare-bones -- three discs for the first (and only) season -- but the cast is outstanding and the show fun to rewatch. Yes, there are times when the manic approach of Robin Williams takes over the screen, but it's refreshing to see Sarah Michelle Geller play ""straight man"" to him as her father.

Others have mentioned problems with the format, but mine played (in a Sony Blu-ray player) just fine.",1454716800,2,412,4.5675675675675675
7022610,5,B00TULHP26,"I ordered this product from Amazon on December 20th, 2015.  I received standard pressed DVDs (disks made in Mexico), not DVD-R as mentioned in the product description.  The images were crisp and clear.  I loved watching the show again.",1451865600,4,235,4.9743589743589745
7022611,5,B00TULHP26,"I just wanted to write a review for the season I received. Amazon must have fixed the issue so many others have had. Firstly, my set said ""discs made in Mexico"" which is what I see on a lot of season sets that are actually made legitimately, and the discs are NOT DVD+R discs in my set, they are actual discs with the clear back, instead of the blue color. So feel free to order now.",1451347200,5,383,4.052631578947368
7022612,5,B00TULHP26,This is a review of the show it's self. I loved this show. It was funny and charming and the characters and actors were all great. They had some remarkable chemistry going on and I wish it could have gone on for more seasons. If you like a good half hour comedy show with silly antics and absurd jokes I'd recommend trying this one.,1450828800,,332,4.203125
7022613,3,B00TULHP26,"Like so many others, I had to tune in to watch The Crazy Ones.  And yes, I was watching just as much for Sarah Michelle Geller and I was for Robin Williams.  The first few episodes of this sitcom were fantastic, but then it slowly began to head downhill.  While I stuck around until the end, many didnt, leading to its cancelation.  I would have kept watching if it were still on the air, but I wasn't sorry to see it go.

The comedy comes to us from Chicago as we visit the advertising agency of Roberts and Lewis.  The firm is run day to day by Simon Roberts (Robin Williams), a genius of an advertiser who has been involved in many famous campaigns in his day.  Coming with his genius is a heavy dose of wacky.  Hell explore every idea, usually trying the craziest ones himself.  Balancing him out is his daughter Sydney (Sarah Michelle Geller), who is straight laced and determined and serious.  And she is determined to make a name for herself so she can come out of her fathers shadow.  Also in the agency are Zach (James Wolk), Simons smart protg, Andrew (Hamish Linklater), the neurotic art director, and Lauren (Amanda Setton), the much smarter than she appears assistant.

Over the course of the season, Sydneys campaign for a local coffee shop goes horribly wrong, procrastination is the name of the game when they have to come up with an ad for a breakfast burrito, a conflict might lead Simon to have to give up his first client, the company softball game features too huge stakes, and Zach has to figure out a way to deliver on a huge overpromise.

Now Im not a fan of single camera comedies.  Call me what you will, but I much prefer the multi-camera sitcom when I sit down to watch a comedy.  Still, this sitcom started out with some great laughs in the early episodes.  They let Robin Williams have free reign at times, and the rest of the cast improved off of him.  Some of the results were pretty funny.

However, as the season wore on, that began to lose its charm.  Maybe it was just that the actors were trying too hard to come up with new material.  Or maybe the writing around the improv wasn't as good.  Either way, it wasn't nearly as funny as the first few episodes.  Id call it more amusing at times.

Not helping is that, as the series progressed, the character development fell flat.  What could have turned into interesting people instead turned into the predictable types.  When they did go for character development, it was always perfectly predictable, meaning we often saw the ending of an episode coming from the first commercial break.  A few of those moments were touching, but for the most part, they weren't as creative as they wanted to be.

Im not blaming the actors for this.  Robin Williams can certainly get over the top, but for the most part he was good as Simon.  Sarah Michelle Gellar had the unenviable roll of being the straight woman to all the antics going around.  She got her share of laughs at times, but she was always great whether delivering the setup for the punchline.  The rest of the cast was wonderful as well and easily kept pace with Robins antics.  On the guest star side, look for several appearances as Brad Garrett as the mostly unseen partner Lewis, and Pam Dawber, Mindy of Mork and Mindy fame, also appears in one episode.

The show has been released as a MOD demand release by Amazon.  They seem to be having issues getting the three discs in this set to work, so if you buy the set, be sure you try it right away to see if it works.

I know the show had fans who were disappointed when it was canceled.  However, if youve missed The Crazy Ones, you might not want to rush out to buy the set.  There are some great moments, but the series didn't live up to its full potential.",1447113600,,3750,4.41399416909621
7022614,5,B00TULHP26,I loved this show when it was on t.v.  Love it even better now.,1445904000,,63,3.5
7022615,5,B00TULHP26,EVERYTHING WAS GREAT - ENJOYED THIS COMEDY,1444521600,,42,5.142857142857143
7022616,3,B00TULHP26,"Funny show,not great but not bad
Robin Williams could make the phone book funny
and SMG is as easy on the eyes as she ever was

as for the dvd....i don't want to bash Amazon's CD-R business,because they make available shows that no one else does,on a home format.
(d love for them to pick up The Simpsons dvd's now that FOX (sux) have dropped releasing seasons to dvd)
theres just something about having it 'in your hands thats better to me than going all digital

DISC 1 played right away. Discs 2 & 3 wouldnt. But,ive had other CD-R's that wouldnt play,and after a dozen times of ejecting and loading-they worked. its a pain but,dont give up right away. And trying different players might work,or just be wasting time",1444435200,3,719,4.523076923076923
7022617,1,B00TULHP26,"I tried to play this DVD-R on tree different DVD players. On was a Blue Ray, one was a international DVD player, and one was a standard DVD player. None worked",1442793600,,159,4.161290322580645
7022618,5,B00TULHP26,"When TV was on it's reality show kick--this was such a refreshing break. Williams and Gellar played a father and daughter who ran an offbeat Chicago advertising agency.

Of course  Robin Williams can deliver comedy--basic common sense, right. He plays Simon Roberts a divorced ad executive who is good at selling anything even when he takes way too many risks.

I had not been sure about Gellar. But she really pleasantly surprised me throughout the entire series. She plays daughter Sydney Roberts, the strait-laced ad executive. Despite only being in her 30's she acts much older than she really is. Apparently she looks out for her father and his less than profitable business decisions. She is keeping the company afloat.

A stand out episode was Sydney, Australia, where the agency has to come up with a slogan for a demanding client. Meanwhile Sydney (Gellar) has to deal with an annoying ex-co-worker who is obsessed with her and does not know how to take no for an answer. The song is STILL stuck in my head.

""The Intern"" is a good laugh at what an internship is like both from the perspective of a company--and the intern. Anybody who has actually done (at least) one understands it is not glamorous. You are strictly bottom rung

Williams was paired up again with his Mork and Mindy co-star Pam Dawber in ""Love Sucks"". Dawber played his potential romantic interest in a pairing which was widely watched by fans. They still had good on screen chemistry.

I was disappointed that this series got taken off of the air. Yes there are many more networks now and the ratings are much more competitive. But this show had solid writing and a good cast. It was years since I actually laughed at a sitcom.",1441843200,,1706,4.704697986577181
7022619,5,B00TULHP26,"The show is BRILLIANT and I am really enjoying it. HOWEVER, the DVD doesn't play all the episodes. I can't return it because its taken me over a month to start watching it and judging by the other reviews there is no point in buying another one as this is an ongoing problem. I will buy it again when the issue is resolved as it is worth it.",1440892800,,341,4.029411764705882
7022620,5,B00TULHP26,i loved this show. it should never have been taken off. its a really funny show.,1438819200,,80,4.0625
7022621,5,B00TULHP26,"I purchased this item a few weeks/months ago and I had the same troubles as many others here: The discs weren't working.
But I'm happy to confirm that after the 2nd purchase all discs are working and they are region-free (I live in germany).

I really like this show. It has a great cast. Especially Sarah Michelle Gellar is super funny in this comedy.

I really appreciate that amazon gives people the chance to get this short-lived series on DVD. Thanks!",1438214400,3,456,4.617283950617284
7022622,5,B00TULHP26,I don't know why people said that the DVDs for the crazy ones don't work in there review they do DVDs are region lock by country so that's probably why the crazy ones is a awesome season box set,1437523200,,194,4.0
7022623,3,B00TULHP26,"This show had lots of promise But, it didn't know what it was

Robin Williams was a blessing and a curse cast as the main character (He's performance was manic to say the least It was never Balanced which is a Shame watch him in Awakenings he's Amazing!
Sarah Michelle Gellar was one of the strongest people on here she was likable and funny (Not over the top silly)
James Wolk was ok but, his strange relationship with Williams made him less likable....
Hamish Linklater was very good his chemistry with Gellar seemed very real
Amanda Setton was very good  too
Brad Garrett was thrown into a handful of episodes due to maybe low ratting? they should've kept him Cause he was a strong side Character to have plus  Williams and Brad seem to rift off each other better then any of the much younger cast members
The cast over all was good Not great due to the hit and miss stories
13 episode in i just stopped DVR it cause the show seemed to be in the ""Mud""
the Idea and Concept was very interesting
David E. Kelley Created it but, something was off
I'm sure CBS probably had a prob. with the Original Concept and Standards & Practices got involved
The Original Idea was Williams was a full blown Mentally Ill Businessman working in the cut throat-world of  advertising (He returns from a Asylum  his daughter is the new head of his advertising firm
Something like this done 10x Better was the film Crazy People from 1990 it least that was more honest and real
This seemed like David E. Kelly watched Crazy People and thought i can do that as a Network Sitcom I'll get a massive star it'll be HUGE
not so much The Crazy Ones only lasted One Season then came the Tragic Blow to almost every generation with the death of
Robin Williams
It's very Ironic and Odd this was Williams last chance at a prime time tv return
It's really hard to rate this show Cause you can't help but, wonder was it really Doomed from the start or what!
If it did get a second season who's to say what would've happened",1437350400,,1990,4.367567567567567
7022624,1,B00TULHP26,"As funny as the late Robin Williams was, this for me was not his best work. There's way too much dialogue, too much talking, a lot of confusing plots. Be careful when ordering, some of the discs may not work.",1434931200,2,208,4.225
7022625,5,B00TULHP26,"I'm rating this show five stars mainly because it was such an amazing show. This show deserved more than it ever got. It had such great wit and comedy.

I have had issues with receiving a copy of this DVD that actually worked. But, finally I received a copy that works perfectly. And since, I've re-watched every episode multiple times.

7022653,1,B00TULHP26,"Nothing against this show because I love the show and everything. But, I am very disappointed. I received the the season set and went to watch it and the discs DO NOT work. I thought it was just the DVD player maybe and tried every DVD player in the house. It didn't work on any of them. I'm not sure if it is an manufacturing error or what it is, but I want it fixed. I didn't waste almost $30 on DVD set that doesn't even work. Very disappointed and pissed off. Amazon need to get it together and fix this issue.",1428710400,21,514,4.049019607843137
7022654,1,B00TULHP26,"The DVDs will not play. This is the second MOD title I bought recently that will not play. ""Back In The Game"" had the same issue. I ended up getting reimbursed but doesn't seem like the title will be fixed.",1428710400,3,206,4.175
7022655,2,B00TULHP26,"Not ordering as 25% of the reviews of persons already having this set can't play the discs and the others do not seem to have their copies yet. Loved the show, would love to get it but do not need this DVD-R hassle.  Had it before.  That was enough.....",1428710400,17,253,4.142857142857143

Love you Robin!",1531958400,,220,4.525
8703141,5,B00TULHP26,I have watched this series many times. It's fluff for those times I don't want to think about anything serious. The case is good in their roles. It's a shame about Robbin Williams.,1523232000,,180,4.484848484848484
8703142,3,B00TULHP26,This show killed Robin Williams. He could not remain relevant in this context. It was just too mediocre. A typical sitcom. Not well written or cast. SMG is just not the least bit funny. Not even a good straight man. I had to go watch The Fisher King to wash it out of my brain. Nanu nanu Robin.,1505692800,,294,4.086206896551724

8703144,1,B00TULHP26,"I have tried to watch this DVD in my laptop computer and in every DVD player I have access to, but in the laptop it only appears as a re-writable disc and will not recognize that it is a playable DVD, or in a DVD player or TV it simply tells me that the disc is not compatible with the player or cannot be recognized. All three discs act this way. I bought this season over 2 years ago and for some reason just never decided to put it in and re-watch it. Now I feel silly asking for any sort of refund or exchange, even though I would REALLY like one! Aren't these discs tested or something before they are mailed out??",1494201600,,619,4.040650406504065

8703148,4,B00TULHP26,"This was one of the under appreciated and under watched comedy series of 2014.  Robin Willams is the lunatic head of a ad agency.  Sarah Michelle Gellar is his workaholic daughter.  James Wolk and Hamish Linklatter are the concept team (words and pictures).  Brad Garrett joins the fun about a third of the way in as Williams business partner.  Each character has their own quirk/flaw and as a group they compliment each other.

At the end of each of the 22 episodes, there are outtakes where Robin and company show off their insanity.  (My favorite is when Robin asks Sarah how she learned to slide over the hood of the car and she replies ""Sunnydale"" -- referring to her years as Buffy).

If you do not laugh at least once an episode, you have no funny bone.",1467849600,2,760,4.4963503649635035
8703149,1,B00TULHP26,I never got to watch this. By the time I found time to watch it found out it wouldn't work at all. It was to late to get my money back so can't give a fair review of the show. really do hate that!,1462406400,,196,3.477272727272727
