3154105,2,B00168OIP8,"I am a great fan of Risky Business, but this edition is pretty disappointing.  The picture quality and sound are fine, but you'd think with the advent of Blu-Ray and all of its storage capacity, that they could have actually spliced the director's cut last scene onto the movie!  Instead, you have to watch the scene on its own, so it's impossible to tell how it really flows with the film.

Also, I'd love to watch the commentary, but I refuse to watch it picture-in-picture, which is really distracting.  Once again, where is the option to turn off the picture-in-picture?

I'd love to buy Blu-Ray, bit it seems that you really need to wait and buy discs that take full advantage of the medium...otherwise it's a waste.",1239840000,6,721,4.645669291338582

Its an excellent coming of age story with thoroughly winning performances by everyone involved especially Tom Cruise and the knock out Rebecca De Mornay who is even hotter now if you can believe that. It also has a stellar 80s score by the great Tangerine Dream. I would love a darker follow up to this film showing where Cruise's character is at with being a ""pimp"" and De Mornay's character.

The original script was even darker, with more thought provoking satire, and less flat out comedy.  And indeed, the original ending included as an extra on the blu-ray subtly casts a whole different, more complex and interesting light on the film.

3154253,5,B00168OIP8,"""Risky Business"" represents the 80's teen genre with style, as a a teenager has the house to himself when his parents leave for vacation. His friends tell him that he owes himself a good time, so he ends up having a one-night-stand with a hooker who inevitably steals a very expensive crystal egg off his families mantlepiece. His life just get's worse from here on out, by having his father's car slide into the lake and almost blowing his entire college interview. I must say that this film knows when to be subtle and good hearted and it knows when it is the right time to make you laugh. Tom Cruise is very cool in one of his very first theatrical roles, and the classic underwear scene will never tire. The acting is fun, the outfits fit the film perfectly, the plot line brings out the true events of the 80's, and by the end of the movie, I was either feeling happy when he was or sad when he was.

3154279,5,B00168OIP8,"While no Academy Award Winner, I'd forgotten what a great movie this is!

This was THE movie of 1983, for anyone remotely near their teenage years at the time. Has it really been nearly 30 years? It's easy to bury this in a sea of teenage coming-of-age comedies that were the rage at that time, but this one's a stand-out!

The movie that made Tom Cruise's career (well before he became a wack-a-doo tabloid-fodder Scientologist talk-show freak, LOL!). This movie was basically a ""first"" for several up-coming '80's actors like Bronson Pinchot (""Beverly Hills Cop""), Curtis Armstrong (""Revenge of the Nerds"", ""Moonlighting""), Joe Pantoliano (""The Soprano's""), in addition to the lovely Rebecca DeMornay (""Hand That Rocks the Cradle"") and, of course, Cruise. The ""Stars"" (actually not yet quite stars), DeMornay and Cruise, deliver honest performances: you actually believe they are who they're portraying! DeMornay in particular is a standout as a gorgeous, young street-wise yet vulnerable ""lady of the night"".

Amazing vid and audio quality for a shoe-string budget '80's flick. I've never seen this movie look this good! The moody Tangerine Dream synth soundtrack melds well interspersed with some good 'ole Rock 'n Roll. While the cars, clothes, hairstyles and ""props"" may be dated, the movie has aged remarkably well. While there is a certain sense of nostalgia to the piece...for those of us who lived throught the period and were of the same age as the featured actors...you tend to forget that its 1983 and just enjoy the movie.

Lots of great movie quotes and memorable scenes abound amongst the outrageous storyline, and they throw in a bunch of extras features, like a ""making of"" documenatry, alternate ending, trailer, etc...all mostly in HD (except the Cruise/DeMornay Screen test, which was videotaped at the producer's house). There's also the obligatory comment track by Cruise, the producer, etc.

While clearly a reflection of the Reaganomics capitalistic mindset pervasive in the early '80's, this is a movie that, IMHO, will resonate with many generations, not just those Baby and post-Baby Boomers who saw this first run! This ""adolescent"" comedy is quite a bit darker and much more substantive than the typical ilk that abounded at that time.

Otherwise, the movie looks great on BD; clearly much money was saved on the production budget by not buying any bras for Rebecca DeMornay.",1255478400,24,236,4.7560975609756095

8261591,5,B00168OIP8,"Tom Cruise charges forth in this wild and fun coming of age comedy!

Paul Brickman wrote and directed this very raunchy romance film with witty dialogue and lots of laughs. The direction is pretty cool as shot after shot impresses you with clever angles, panning shots, editing sequences, and creative use of lighting and surroundings. Risky Business is naughty, but not crude. It has a class and style that is totally its own. I think it is still worth a watch.

Tom Cruise is excellent as the lead Joel. He is funny and relatable throughout. It is a humorous situation how he becomes an accidental pimp, but you are always intrigued by his reactions. Cruise gives his breakout performance in Risky Business and his acclaim is well deserved. He pulls off a much more mature role for his age.

Rebecca de Mornay is gorgeous and seductive in Risky Business. She plays Lana with a playful teasing quality, while also portraying a sincere side. You really wonder who this girl is and hope she is for real. She is acting at a more mature level than girls her age as she steals the show in Risky Business in many scenes. You cannot take your eyes off her.

Risky Business features an iconic soundtrack of 1980's classic rock music, but the real treat is Tangerine Dream's electronic score. I found myself humming along to Risky Business' theme. It absolutely captures the tense and uncertain tone of the movie. You never know what is going to happen next.

I recommend Risky Business for any teenage guy and older. It is a coming of age narrative with lessons as well as laughs. Beautifully filmed to look at, but even more fun as you join Cruise's Joel on a joyous journey.",1526688000,,1669,4.625
