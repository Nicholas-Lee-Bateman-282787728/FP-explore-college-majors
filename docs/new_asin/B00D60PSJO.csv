8589795,2,B00D60PSJO,"Some good information, but told from a very one-sided perspective.  It is a propaganda film for one side of an argument.  It never acknowledges or address legitimate concerns of fishermen, and the potential for them to be correct.

Some of their arguments are more fear driven rather than fact driven.  Opinion wrapped in predatory fear.

I do agree that we need time to study the impact, and the life cycle of the toothfish.",1504224000,,425,4.767123287671233

8589801,5,B00D60PSJO,"A beautifully shot and informative documentary about one of Earth's last pristine Marine environments- the Ross Sea, off the coast of Antarctica. There is stunning photography above and below water, and a great deal of information about the threats to the Ross Sea as a result of commercial fishing activity for what is essentially a luxury food item, the Antarctic Toothfish, which is wrongly marketed as Chilean Seabass.

We really need to spread the word in order to get policy makers to approve the implementation of a marine protected area and protect this amazing place for future generations. So if you liked it, give it a great rating, write a review, and share it as much as possible! Let's try to make a difference! Oh- and avoid Chilean Seabass like the plague!",1378166400,6,772,4.848484848484849
