1343215,5,B00004RFID,"A fun and disturbing look at Andy Kaufman's obsession with wrestling making wrestling fans  hate him,love him,then hate him even worse.
There's also great clips of his early comedy sketches,which are not easy  to find. I'd love to see more wrestling footage than is shown here. There's  still plenty though,I crack up every time I watch this show.

1343236,5,B00004RFID,"Before ""showtime"" and storylines really became the main draw of professional wrestling, Andy Kaufman, writer, comedian and actor(no determination which skill was really him), decided to venture in to pro wrestling. Most that knew him had a hard time deciding when he was trying to be funny and when realistic. His venture into wrestling was real in that he conceived a brilliant storyline in which most if not all his collegues believed he was really doing it. He and Jerry Lawler had a ""feud"" beginning when Andy, apparently a ""wrestler"" in an intergender(?) league since he couldn't wrestle real men decided to wrestle and attempt to injur and humiliate women by putting them in their ""proper roles"" as kitchen servants ranked closely to dogs as he put it. After Jerry Lawler, pro wrestler and champ witnesses this decides to train a woman that actually takes Andy to the limit nearly beating him. Interfering as Andy put it, Jerry would be the target of revenge after claiming he was pushed and suffered ""injury"". This Documentary attempts to tell the story through footage of dialogue from women he wrestled, fellow actors who were close to him, Jerry Lawler, various people of Tennesse, and himself wrestling and giving his ""shoot"". At the time, local folks really thought this was for real especially the stint on NBC during late night with letterman in which Andy and Jerry get into a huge verbal and physical brawl. All of this reaches its peak a year later in a final episode that is truly a modern day Pay Per View ending. This documentary is unique in that many elements were new and fresh for wrestling fans including long running storylines, ""shoots"" with unsuspecting people and fellow actors and filmed in a very reporter like fashion. Also for Andy Kaufman fans a rare glimpse into his ""comic(?)"" genious as he bewilders and frustrates people from hollywood all the way down to the people of Teneesse. Great wrestling/documentary story.",1266105600,6,1952,4.918181818181818
1343237,4,B00004RFID,"I agree with Steve Puchalski (author of SLIMETIME) when he calls Kaufman ""The King of S***heel Schtick"". In many ways Andy can be compared to Lenny Bruce for taking things a step further. A kind of 80's Antonin Artaud of comedy.

I didn't follow this stage of Andy's career closely when it was going on but was extremely surprised in hindsight at how far ahead of the rest of the world Kaufman really was. This excellent two-fer compliments one another and actually leaves the viewer wanting more.

""I'm From Hollywood"" covers Andy's whole wrestling career in pseudo documentary style but when the credits role and you see names like ""Jethro Bodine"" listed you realize how far this schtick goes. Close friend Robin Williams provides excellent underplayed interview bites along the way along with Taxi cast members and other associates. In retrospect, it was a perfect choice for Kaufman to get mixed up in the head scratching arena of wrestling.

The real treat is ""My Breakfast With Blassie"" which parodies ""My Dinner With Andre"" and actually comes away more entertaining. Kaufman's beakfast partner is self-proclaimed ""King of Men"", wrestler Fred Blassie. This is somewhat of a must-see and loses something in translation but, like early John Waters, there is something here to offend most everybody whether its Blassie's continual rubbing of the pregnant tummy of the waitress (who he nicknames Buddha) for good luck or the patron who vomits next to Andy's seat towards the end of the meal.

Fans of ""This Is Spinal Tap"", ""The Rutles"", Morrissey's Warhol films other dry witted jokes that never let down their guard will love this stuff.

Watch them back to back with ""I'm From Hollywood"" being first for maximum entertainment value.",1250726400,,1736,5.013888888888889
1343238,5,B00004RFID,"Being a big-time wrestling fan from the old-days, I really dugged the classic wrestling footage from the Mid-South Coliseum featuring Jerry ""The King"" Lawler's old wrestling territory in Memphis. Andy Kaufman was simply superb protraying a wrestling heel(bad guy). He knew how to piss the fans off. ""I'm from Hollywood"" is a nice little time capsule of pro wrestling and the antics of Andy Kaufman from the early 80's.

Far as the second feature, I totally enjoyed the interaction between Kaufman and ""Classy"" Freddie Blassie. Their non-sensical ramblings were very amusing and had a natural flow to it between the comedian and wrestling manager. I liked the choice of location at a now-defunct restaurant in Los Angeles. It was also nice seeing scenes of the LA streets in the early 80's.

Also included is the LA premiere of ""My Breakfast With Blassie"" with an altered looking Andy Kaufman. Overall a very entertaining package for fans of classic-wrestling and Andy Kaufman.",1223078400,2,976,5.09375
1343239,3,B00004RFID,"The wrestling between jerry lawler and andy kaufman was all staged or 'worked' as they say in the business, but it is fun to see again. the interviews with other celebrities make it seem real and of course jerry lawler is used to this type of acting. kaufman took to the theater of it as he did with everything with a real enthusiasm. there is one part of this dvd that was not part of the wrestling events. when kaufman speaks to the camera looking shaken and talks about being hurt by 'all of this'. that was actually after he was thrown off of the tv show Fridays for not cooperating. if you liked kaufman or pro wrestling this is worth a look",1200528000,2,646,4.260162601626016
1343240,5,B00004RFID,"As another reviewer points out, I never buy DVD's unless they're a keeper. This one is. Andy Kaufman participated in arguably the best show business hoax/performance art piece of all time. All hype? Yes sir. Stupid? No way. Looking back, Andy was the last guy that could get away with this stuff in the ring. Now it is show business. BACK THEN, THESE PEOPLE AT THE MID-SOUTH COLISEUM THOUGHT KAUFMAN AND WRESTLING WERE REAL. The end of an era indeed. The only bummer is that the whole Kaufman story couldn't be put out in it's entirerty for people crazy as me to buy it. ""Breakfast with Blassie"" is also amazing, in that Kaufman gets Classy into his world without the self proclaimed ""king of men"" knowing what's up. Another gem from the best comedic mind around, living, passed-on or not. Pure genious and hilarious. If you like your comedy spoon-fed, don't bother...",1170460800,2,868,4.717105263157895
1343241,5,B00004RFID,"If you are a fan of Andy Kaufman, the TV Show ""Taxi"", today's Wrestling Shows, the movie ""Man on the Moon"", or even Live Television ""Spoofs"", there is no ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT that you will fully and completely enjoy, and be entertainained by this DVD.  I have to say that, I fully believe that Wrestling WOULD NOT EXIST on Television today (even cable), had it not been for Andy Kaufman and Jerry Lawler working together - and the beauty of all of it, is that in typical Andy Kaufman fashion, it all seemed so real and believable, at the time, that NOBODY knew the difference!!

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!! -  And just an FYI, I have a personal rule, that I DO NOT buy DVD's unless they are REALLY, REALLY GOOD, that buying them is justified - and this one DEFINITELY IS!!  R.I.P. Andy - We really miss you!",1158537600,2,804,4.375838926174497
1343242,3,B00004RFID,"Interesting, but more as a portrait of a performance artist than a comedy. Best for the kaufman completists.",1119830400,2,108,5.055555555555555
1343243,5,B00004RFID,"this is a hilarious dvd, the movies are a hoot...you have to enjoy the Taxi days of Andy Kaufmans humor and the rest of his dilusional behavior to understand his great command of comedy, this is a great addition to my movie collection.",1116892800,4,235,4.488372093023256
1343244,5,B00004RFID,"Although ""I'm from Hollywood"" gets top billing, this DVD is actually made up of two movies: ""I'm from Hollywood,"" which chronicles Kaufman's pro-wrestling career (a career which saw him defeat numerous women and ended when, for the for the first time, he fought someone of his own gender); and ""My Breakfast with Blassie,"" a hilarious spoof of the movie ""My Dinner with Andre.""

  ""I'm from Hollywood"" is a collage of scenes of Andy Kaufman's involvement in pro-wrestling, taken from television.  Kaufman plays a ""bad guy"" wrestler who taunts the viewing audience about how he is a famous Hollywood star who can beat up any woman who dares challenge him in the ring.  He goes to redneck country and insults the viewers, telling them that he is going to teach them about new things, like soap. After he finally meets a male (Jerry Lawlor) in the ring, he ends up in traction.

  ""My Breakfast with Blassie"" is a parody of ""My Dinner with Andre,"" a film that consisted almost entirely of two people having an intellectually stimulating conversation during dinner at an upscale restaurant on Manhattan's Upper West Side.  So here, Kaufman made a film about former wrestler/wrestling manager Freddie Blassie and himself having an anti-intellectual conversation during breakfast at a downscale Los Angeles pancake house. We see Kaufman and Blassie conversing about how they don't like shaking peoples' hands because ""you never know where their hands could've been - They could have just wiped themselves and their finger could have gone through the toilet paper."" In another scene, Blassie rubs the pregnant Thai waitress' belly for good luck, and then, after she walks away, comments, ""That's another one we'll be feeding on welfare.""

These two films are highly recommended.  They're a real gas!",1111795200,6,1792,5.081911262798635
1343245,5,B00004RFID,"Andy Kaufmann was known as the comedian's comedian, and for good reason.  He found humor in the strangest places, and many stand up comedians claim that he showed them a kind of comedy that they didn't know was possible.

Andy pushes the boundries of what is acceptable, in the name of humor, maybe more strongly here than anywhere ever seen.  This is anti-Seinfeld stuff.  Seinfeld describes commonplace things in an uncommon way to make familiar situations seem strange and funny, giving you a chuckle - standard standup.  In this film, Andy taunts an audience of thousands in a Tennessee ampitheater, after telling them that they are stupid, and unclean.  He plays a character - an arrogant ""hollywood"" guy, who has some need to prove his physical superiority by beating up women.  In doing this, he makes himself into a kind of ridiculous villian, and the audience swells with hatred for him.  Example of his extravances: he struts around the ring wearing a GIANT crown and velvet cape, claiming to be the ""King of Tennessee"".  Right before getting pummled by the ""hero"", Jerry Lawler.  Andy, wearing long underwear under his boxer shorts, spends most of the match trying to escape Jerry by running and hiding (in the ring).

This character would be easily dismissed if the insults were not so real, and painful, and I think this is what makes the comedy so biting... it comes very close to pain.  The very satisfying thing about Andy is that, though you might have to wait a long time for the punchline, it always comes, and it is all the laugh is all the stronger for having to wait so long!

This is the kind of DVD that you have to get to hand off to friends.",1107043200,16,1667,4.629251700680272
1343266,4,B00004RFID,"A lot of Kaufman fans may not realize this, but Andy was a died-in-the-wool wrestling fan.  Before Taxi brought him fame he would spend time at matches and hanging out with wrestlers (Roddy Piper relays an interesting story in in autobiography).  But most of all, as a performance artist, Andy UNDERSTOOD wresting.  He understood how to work an audience.  Using the techniques he'd been honing in his stage shows, he finally got to be a bad guy wrestler in the feud documented on this mockumentary.  In one interview shown on this film, Andy cleverly insults the entire southern U.S. population with comments specifically directed to Lawler.  Why would he do this you may ask?  Simple- To get all of Memphis to come down to the arena, BUY A TICKET, and see Andy get whats coming to him.

The interviews on this mockumentary are wonderful to watch.  One has to wonder if his taxi co-stars were in on the gag, but Robin Williams does this wonderful interview segment where he talks about Andy's wrestling habits as a close friend would show concerns about ones substance abuse habit - pretty funny to watch.

This film is pretty entertaining. Even if you aren't a wrestling fan,its a good way to get introduced to Andy's antics.  The film also has some clips of andy's other classic performance bits.

Wrestlers and promoters, If you wanna ""put rear ends in seats"", then study Andy and Jerry's work in this film.  Its a shame Andy didn't live through the wrestling boom that happened shortly after his death.  I can only imagine what he might have been able to cook up in the WWF.",1104624000,5,1578,4.670289855072464

1343268,5,B00004RFID,"I owned this particular title on VHS and I was so excited to see it make it's way to DVD.
I can't think of a better film to show this period in Kaufman's career.  The focus of this particular title is his many exploits into the world of Professional Wrestling.  It shows you not only the in-ring/on-stage antics, but a lot of the back stage talk as well as comments from those who knew him best.
If you are either an Andy Kaufman fan, or anyone who is interested in the Golden Age of Wrestling... check out this title before it goes out of print again.",1052611200,,552,4.19811320754717

1343270,5,B00004RFID,"This video is simply one of the funniest things I've ever seen.  Andy Kaufman was a truly original comedian (though he hated being labeled a comedian).  I wish we had more like him today, instead of all the talentless comics with their packaged, scripted routines that anyone who can memorize a script or read a cue card can pull off (can you say Jay Leno?).
By the way, I simply don't understand how any person of reasonable intelligence could watch this video and believe that the feud between Kaufman and Jerry Lawler was ""real.""  While it is true that the two cooked up some pretty realistic-looking happenings in the course of the saga (e.g., Andy lying in a hospital bed after Lawler's administering a piledriver, and Lawler's giving Andy a very real slap on the infamous Letterman episode), it is obvious that the whole thing was just a very carefully planned gag.  The events that occurred after the Letterman episode show that there was no true animosity between Kaufman and Lawler.  The ""feud"" lasted for quite a long time after the Letterman episode.  Andy had several other wrestling matches with Lawler, in which his antics got progressively sillier, and he made a guest appearance on ""The Jerry Lawler Show"" in which he made silly threats to sue Lawler for defamation.  Most conclusively, Jerry Lawler appears as himself in the biographical movie of Kaufman's life, ""Man on the Moon.""  The movie reveals that the whole thing was a joke.
It's a shame that so many people just did not appreciate Andy's humor.  But, I don't think Andy minded a bit.",1023148800,5,1560,4.769516728624535
1343271,4,B00004RFID,"While we gaze in glory upon the USA Network and even UPN as today's pro wrestling heroes parade around in their oiled-down, eyebrow raising glory,  it's hard to believe that nearly two decades ago one of the biggest flaps  in the sport was an introverted Jewish boy from Great Neck, Long Island.  What's harder to believe is that, once again, we were the joke.
While  Andy's put-ons and antics were well known from the beginning of his career,  even the seasoned comedy pros and those closest to him thought Andy had  pretty much lost it by the time he climbed into the ring with Jerry Lawler.  When you watch this DVD, you will be amazed as even Robin Williams  proffers that perhaps Andy had finally slipped that thin, vague line he  seemed to tread.
This is a well produced DVD.  The songs, cheesy as they  may be, can be almost catchy at times.  The interviews are first class, and  the production, while obviously low-budget, is surprisingly well done.  On  the bonus side, you also get ""My Breakfast With Blassie,"" which  you really must see to believe.
This DVD is only for those who hold Andy  in a special place in their hearts, not those whith only scant familiarity.  If you're new to Andy, buy ""Man on the Moon"" and couple it with  Bob Zmuda's book.  If Andy has already found a niche in your heart, by all  means, order this today.",965606400,10,1344,4.4937759336099585
1343272,4,B00004RFID,"Andy Kaufman is someone you either love or hate.  His brief career was sadly cut short by cancer, but he's best remembered for his outrageous wrestling persona.  To this day people don't know how much was a comedy  routine.  Judge for yourself in this video showing Kaufman's mania for  wrestling women.

7921092,2,B00004RFID,"""I'm From Hollywood"" is just about as thorough a synopsis of Kaufman's wrestling career as a 60-minute mockumentary could ever hope to be. It begins on a huge high note, covering Andy's early career via a series of tongue in cheek interviews with big name co-stars and friends, stretching the truth with an anchor in reality a'l Spinal Tap. It's when the subject turns to his exploits in the Memphis wrestling scene, though, that the picture pulls a complete 180. Those celebrity chats quickly disappear, replaced with direct archival footage of the actual matches and promo segments that eventually built to Kaufman's long-term feud with a very young Jerry Lawler. It's great on a sheerly historical sense, but considering this rivalry lasted for well over a year (in regular once-a-week installments) there's a lot of redundancy in the material that could've been cut out. I would've rather seen a continuation of those interviews spliced in with the raw footage to keep the commentary fresh and the pace quick, because this catches a terrible case of the drags around the halfway point that it never quite manages to shake. It's a major disappointment that the producers couldn't secure the rights to Kaufman and Lawler's infamous fight on Letterman, too, which was the real hook of that storyline.",1301875200,,1301,5.027777777777778

7921094,5,B00004RFID,"I love this DVD.One could make an arguement based on his ability to draw heat that Andy Kaufman was one of the greatest professional wrestlers of the modern era. Because in the modern era of pro wrestling it's more important to draw heat then it is to be a technically sound wrestler. Kurt Angle became a star in the pro ranks not because he was a two-time NCAA champion or an Olympic gold medallist,but because he could make the fans hate him. Kaufman was able to do this with the best of them. This DVD is a mockumentary of the actor/comedian/performance artist's entry into the world of pro wrestling,his matches against women and his legendary feud with Jerry ""the King"" Lawler. This special edition released by Johnny Legend and his sister Lynne(Kaufman's girl friend)features an audio commentary by Lynne and Kaufman's partner in insanity Bob Zmuda. It also features two matches in which Kaufman boxes Lawler and written challenges from women who wanted to take on Kaufman in the squared circle.
