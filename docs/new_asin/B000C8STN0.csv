8096432,5,B000C8STN0,"I know this is supposed to be a comedy...and it is very funny... but it also contains such pathos. I was genuinely touched by the sadness of the plight of the gay man so much in love with his straight best friend. One can't help sympathizing with hopeless love!...And OLIVIER SITRUK as Dan would turn on a statue!! That man is so beautiful it's unreal!! You just want to take a bite out of him because he's so gorgeous!!! Oh, yeah, and he can act too!! No wonder Laurent fell in love with him!!! I really love this unusual movie...and I'm straight!!",1269043200,,549,4.392156862745098
8096433,3,B000C8STN0,"This is a reasonably amusing flick about a gay man in love with his hetero roommate and contemptuous of said roommate's female love interest.  Various misunderstandings and clashes ensue.  A wedding finally happens. There is really not much more to it than that.

Okay for brief entertainment.",1260835200,,293,5.191489361702128
8096434,1,B000C8STN0,"Until the last 11 minutes I was delighted with this film.  While it is certainly no masterpiece, the characters were delightful and charming, the writing and production quite good, etc.  I was basking in my enjoyment and looking forward with joyful anticipation to a DVD to add to my list of top favorites.

Then came the awful last 11 minutes.  Why awful?  The writers suddenly do a complete and implausible U-turn, and after 77 minutes of delightful buildup to a certain and specific conclusion, they abruptly shift everything, ignoring all the buildup and foreshadowing which has been carefully laid throughout the film (some of it quite strong), and switch the couples around with very little (and in one case NO) character motivation.

One character which has been merely an associate of one of the main characters suddenly (and for no apparent reason) proposes marriage, throwing the whole careful buildup of the film right out the window.

Another major earlier plot twist (the stag night ""tied to the bed"" Lea scene) is left completely unresolved (I suspect that in the original script, the main character's finding out about the truth of this scene was the device which would have led to his making the proper choice, and giving us the clearly satisfying ending to the film).

This is the most disappointed I've been with a film in a long time, and the disappointment is made all the more bitter because the first 77 minutes of the film is so charming and delightful.  The last 11 minutes throw it all away, and leaves the viewer with a tasteless and unsatisfying experience.

I'd suggest only buying this one if you are capable of switching it off as the first wedding begins (approx. 77 minutes in), and writing or mentally composing your own ending.  To watch the one presented in the film is to taint the whole experience.

I would be willing to bet that there is a ""story"" behind this absurd and sudden turnabout in the script, such as a new producer or writer suddenly brought into the production team who insisted upon a more ""mainstream ending"".  It certainly makes no sense in the film.

I am glad to note that one reviewer below has ammended his review to add a similar cautionary note to mine.

While viewing the first 77 minutes of the film I sat there increasingly enthralled and knowing increasingly for certain that this would become a treasured part of my collection.  Now, after viewing the ending, I don't even wish to view the film again until I can write my own ending and put it in the DVD case with a cautionary note to stop the DVD at 77 minutes in and read my written ending instead.

So, I have to rate it as follows:

4 1/2 Stars -- (the first 77 minutes)

0 Stars  -- (the last 11 minutes)

Thus averaging the two together one arrives at 2 stars, which I honestly feel I must round down to 1 due to the disappointment factor.

BOTTOM LINE:  what should have been a completely delightful and charming film ends up being a very unsatisfying viewing experience.

If you want to view a French film with similar themes and which is very well done, buy JUST A QUESTION OF LOVE, which is available from our friends here at Amazon.",1176076800,2,3159,4.620071684587813
8096435,2,B000C8STN0,"This is a one-joke/one-issue movie that isn't clever, nor does it cover any new ground, and the central charater is a whining irritating self-centered dullard who can't accept that someone he loves might not love him back. (It sure wasn't hard for me to imagine.)

The supporting characters are dull and lifeless, and one of them proposes to the central character.  I had difficulty caring.  I kept looking at the time to see whether it was almost finished.

I must say that if you're interested in this movie, please do yourself a favor and see ""All Over The Guy.""  It's in ENGLISH, it's cute, funny, intelligent, manages to avoid scenes of public urination, and it's much more enjoyable and affecting that this clunker. ""Just One Time"" is also noteworthy, supporting the same basic story line as this movie, and is also far superior in every way.

I wouldn't say completely avoid this as a rental, but it's certainly not a ""keeper"" (or even close) for me.",1165708800,,957,4.734939759036145
8096436,5,B000C8STN0,"Stephane Clavier is a fine director who makes his major film debut with this French romantic comedy that embraces the sparks flying around today about gay relationships and gay marriages and in doing so finds a romantic comedy that has serious overtones but remains entertaining to the end.

Dan (Olivier Sitruk), a lovable lothario in the Don Juan tradition who runs a sex talk show,  rooms with physical therapist Laurent (Arnaud Giovaninetti), a gay activist who with his friends is fighting for gay marriage rights in France. Laurent is secretly  in love with Dan, and  when Dan finally meets the girl of his dreams Camille (Julie Gayet), Laurent's hopes of a relationship beyond best friends with Dan are threatened.  Laurent tries every trick to derail Dan's relationship and when Dan plans marriage and moves out, Laurent takes on lesbian roommate Sam (Anne Azoulay) who is supportive in more ways than one!  Dan asks Laurent to be his best man but Camille knows of Laurent's passion for Dan and encourages Dan to try a gay episode (Camille has tried that in the past) just to reassure himself that he is making the right choice: the results are less than noteworthy!  The twists and turns make the story funny and touching and the ending includes two weddings instead of one, but revealing the significance  of the title of the film would deprive the audience of the punchline!

The production values are superb with deft camera work, excellent editing techniques, and keen pacing. The story does waver into stereotypes but not as unsuccessfully as most bi/gay/straight films do.  In the end the fact that the film works so well is due to the excellent acting of the main cast and a superb supporting cast (Dan's 'Madame' mother, Camille's wealthy but weird parents, Laurent's campy friends).  The result is a bit of light French comedy with some examination of political issues that are poignant.  It is a bit of French pastry!  Grady Harp, April 06",1145664000,2,1958,4.879154078549849
8096437,5,B000C8STN0,"One gay roommate adores his best friend but the problem is that roomate is straight. Not only that, but the roommate is falling in love with a girl. Complications... A frothy, light comedy that is fun to watch. My favorite scene occurs where the best friend lends his bride's wedding dress so that his roommate can use it as a prop in a gay parade. When the bride sees ""her dress"" being ripped up on television...well...",1141603200,7,420,4.5394736842105265
8096438,3,B000C8STN0,"{Please note, about five months after my initial review, I have rewatched this film, and while I really don't feel the need to add or subtract stars awarded, I would like to throw in an additional observation. It can be identified by it's inclusion in the following parenthetical symbols: (((***))) below.}

Admittedly the acting in this romantic comedy (well, maybe also just a little bit 'serio-comedy') is quite high level.......the two male leads do seem to throw their hearts into it (same goes for the two female characters, for that matter). But what bothers most, in this reviewer's opinion, is that, while the production is cute and fun for the most part, it nevertheless seems to be afflicted by a too serious case of 'will he-- / won't he--itis'. When seemingly for the 1000th time we're brought to the brink of: will our 'Hetero Hero' finally realize he is, in fact, in love with our 'Gay Guy' and will our 'Gay Guy' finally be able to tell our 'Hetero Hero' of his love for him, things begin to pass the stage of ho-hum on this particular plot point (while our 'HH' is a real doll, he's got to be the dumbest guy on the planet....not to pick up on the feelings flying at him).

But speaking of the word, point, there do have to be some given for 'Hetero Hero' finally being able to reach the (dare I use the word again) point of giving 'Gay Guy' that long anticipated lip lock.........even if it is only one of those 'grab quick and push your lips through his face' kind of things. Aw, shoot!

(((***And, perhaps some significant ""no-no points"" would have to go to the director and scriptwriter for giving us a major turn at movie's end, for which absolutely no foundation was laid. When a declaration of love is made and proposal of marriage proffered, one might expect to have seen at a prior point in the proceedings even some slight interest between the 'proposer' and the 'proposee'. But, alas, no.)))

Finally, points given include coverage for high production values, which help to make this video a fun (but not very great) addition to my collection.

PS: Whatever else you may decide to do regarding viewing/purchasing this video, make sure that you let nothing stand between your purchase and viewing of the 'Picture This' video company's truly great release: ""Just A Question Of Love"" (""Juste Une Question D'Amour""). Failure to do so will be a lot more serious, even, than shooting yourself in the foot. (Happy viewing)",1140393600,,2443,4.6985981308411215
