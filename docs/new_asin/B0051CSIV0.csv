8452542,1,B0051CSIV0,"I was thoroughly disappointed with this DVD. It is nothing more than a basic pose guide.
She spends the majority of the time talking and doing a few basic pose demonstrations.
You'll be doing a lot of standing around and waiting for her to actually do something.
If you are looking for a flowing challenging routine, please don't make the mistake
I did and purchase this video.

Instead, I highly recommend anything by Jenni Rawlings! She is excellent!",1381795200,2,452,4.794871794871795
8452543,4,B0051CSIV0,"I have been doing yoga for over a decade and more seriously for the last couple of years. I am intermediate - my skill level. I want to get into more advanced ""flow"" and ""power"" yoga. I have several DVDs already. Shiva's SHAKTI DVD is amazing. David Swenson's Ashtanga series is very challenging (although not as aesthetically pleasing as Shiva's programs). I have Rodney Yee and a few others. I purchased this because of the word ""flow,"" so I slightly bummed that the workout only flows for about 20 minutes. Then there are challenging moves but with breaks for talking and explaining and demonstrating. The workout was challenging  - I liked the moves and I feel good now - I guess that's very important to note. But I was expecting the workout to flow from beginning to end. Half of the music was gorgeous and the other half was okay. This DVD is good for practicing moves, and seemed to go by fast. It's very clean looking - very white - if that's what you're into. I'd say the DVD is perfect for someone who is between beginner and intermediate and wants to master some of those moves so they can feel secure doing a full on intermediate to advanced yoga class or DVD. The DVD actually grows on you. I like it a little more every time I do it. It felt like a 3-star DVD at first and now that I've done it a few times, it's up to a 4 star review easily. I just had to get used to it because it's different than many other yoga DVDs.",1328918400,6,1436,4.279411764705882
