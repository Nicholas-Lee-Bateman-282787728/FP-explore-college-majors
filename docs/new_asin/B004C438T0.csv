8422761,2,B004C438T0,I was interested in the premise of the movie. I was not able to finish watching this movie. I think it's more of a guy movie than I expected and just not for me.,1461196800,,161,3.764705882352941
8422762,2,B004C438T0,"Low production quality, poor acting, and a terrible script kept me from getting more than 2/3 of the way through this film.  I rarely stop watching a movie once I've started, but I found myself considering all the more productive things I could be doing and have very little reason to believe that the last 1/3 can make up for the rest of it.  I do enjoy independent films, but this just seems like a B movie all around to me.  At points it was funny, but the best jokes suffered from poor delivery, both from the actors and the director.  Many of the lines and scenes seemed to drag, with footage that probably should have just been cut.  I'd be willing to bet this whole story could have been presented in half the time with no loss of story.

The concept is great.  I'd love to see a higher budget production with some TLC on the script.  I just don't think this was executed well at all.",1326758400,,891,4.261904761904762
8422763,3,B004C438T0,"We enjoyed the plot.  The acting was predictable at times.  The screenplay was a bit sappy.  But it was a light, fun, comedy.",1326499200,,125,4.3478260869565215
8422764,5,B004C438T0,"This film is definitely worth watching.  It successfully blends interesting characters, great performances and a quirky story line to give it a very unique feel that is not to be missed.  The great musical score was also a pleasant surprise.",1291593600,,241,5.0
8422765,4,B004C438T0,"I had the opportunity of seeing this movie first time when it premiered on the big screen in NYC August 2010 - it's a cool movie!!

Bringing cross-cultural comedy together in one picture is always challenging, and this movie does it, in spades.  From the whacky story-line to the performances.

Considering the oceans of independent movies out there, you should take the plunge on this one.  Go on, I dare you!

Oh, and if anyone wants to see Alex in just his underwear, here's where you see it.  Europeans are not cheap you know...",1290988800,,532,4.6063829787234045
8422766,5,B004C438T0,"Movin' In is a great comedy flick which allows you to relax and laugh. It's about a young person who leaves Switzerland and makes a bunch of funny experiences in LA, including hiding out at an old folks home because he witnessed a crime. And, it's true, the film actually does remind me a little bit of ""Some Like It Hot"", but the modern indie version with less star power, of course. A thumbs up from me!",1290297600,,405,4.2727272727272725
8422767,5,B004C438T0,"This truly is a unique Indie Comedy with an unexpected fresh sense of humor and approach to it! The cast is doing an amazing job of pulling you into the story and making you forget you're still at home watching a movie.
I'm honestly not a big fan of most comedies, but this one is a welcome exception to the rule!",1289952000,3,313,4.147540983606557
8422768,5,B004C438T0,I liked it a lot because it is a funny and quirky indie comedy with a romantic touch...perfect for a date or an evening in front of the TV.,1289865600,3,139,3.8275862068965516
