5931888,4,B00EOVF1EQ,"A good thorough bio-pic on John Fahey.  Curiously, it leaves out his final weeks in a monastic shelter, recovering from alcoholism.",1391904000,2,131,5.238095238095238
5931889,5,B00EOVF1EQ,"I came across John Fahey in the psychedelic sixties and was immediately seized by his echoing, sonorous solo ""ventures into the void"". Rose Records in Chicago stocked a number of LPs on the Takoma label; I recall Fahey and Robbie Basho, don't know if there were others. (Must research.) As this excellent film says, he didn't sound like anybody else. I saw him twice live in small venues in the late eighties, but while it was good he may have moved past his peak and didn't evoke the emotion and joy I experienced in his records, though I did observe his wry humor and jovial nature; well, jovial some of the time. So it's good to see footage of the younger man from the early albums, as well as his prime.

Had no idea that Pete Townshend - greatly admired here - was a fan. But it certainly makes sense in hindsight. I love the film's descriptions of his years out in the beauty of the Pacific Northwest, and the latter's influence on Fahey's thoughts and musical inclinations. Fahey seemed to me to be one of the leaders or precursors of the Woodstock generation; a lover of nature, of peace, of other cultures, of civil rights, and the variety of people on the film who knew him and offer their interpretations do a great job of conveying his individuality and his remarkably original music. Though Im sure Fahey would have been the first to acknowledge his personal musical influences, which ranged from Delta blues to Charles Ives..

I like the stories about knocking on doors in the South to buy old phonograph records for a quarter apiece, his attempt to send a postcard to Booker White and the resulting friendship, his love of trains, his quirky, acerbic humor, his melancholy. He treated the guitar as an orchestra; great observation.

This film is a thoughtful and appreciative look at a relatively unknown talent. Its good to learn that he was, in fact, greatly appreciated where it counts.",1391299200,3,1904,4.660714285714286
5931890,5,B00EOVF1EQ,If you're part of the Fahey cult you'll have some fun with this film. But it's not really a definitive biographical movie of the great man. It seems the film maker is attempting to explain Fahey to the neophytes. And I think it's a great success on that level. Also it contains some great extras too: musical performances by some of the people who appear in the film and Fahey himself. All in all it's a great overveiw of his musical life and some of the philosophy that went on behind it.,1389312000,5,489,4.326086956521739
5931891,5,B00EOVF1EQ,Mr. Fahey was a truly unique musical genius. I would put him in the same class as Django Reinhardt as far as one-of-a-kind musicians go!,1386806400,5,136,4.48
5931892,5,B00EOVF1EQ,"This terrific 57-minute film, written and directed by James Cullingham, and produced as a joint production by Canadian television and Oregon Public Broadcasting, tells the story of the guy who must be considered the father of American primitive music and the precursor of acoustic albums by Leo Kotke, Stefan Grossman and (on piano) George Winston.  When Fahey wanted to record his first album in 1959, he couldn't find a label. It was blues/country collector Joe Bussard who took the chance and recorded Fahey for his Fonotone label (sides available on a superb multi-disc set from Dust-to-Digital Records) and Fahey soon created his own label (Takoma) and issued the iconic The Voice of the Turtle Lp. He discovered (well, re-discovered) blues legends Booker White and Skip James and in the last years of his life (he died in 20002 at age 61) joined Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth and went electric. He also became and avant-garde artist!
Using wonderful interview footage of Fahey interviews, from Laura Webers Guitar Guitar TV show in the 1960s to interviews he gave in the 80s, and comments from a wide range of people he interacted with (Barry Hansen, who was his classmate in the Masters program in folk music at UCLA,  fellow acoustic guitarist Stefan Grossman and even the Whos Pete Towshend) Cullingham presents a full picture of this troubled artist in less than an hour.  If you only know Fahey from his iconic records, I encourage you to check out this DVD
The DVD comes with a LOT of bonuses, making this package even more of a must own. For starters there are the extra interviews. We hear from Chris Funk (the Decemberists) (6 minutes), Dean Blackwood (co-founder of Revenant Records) (14 minutes) and Pete Townshend (The Who, as if you didn't know) whose interview runs 31 minutes! Next comes about 45 minutes of performances by Funk, George Winston (on piano and harmonica) Stefan Grossman, Fahey himself and four others. The bonuses finish with a four part interview with Fahey from 1999 (12 minutes).
The package even go so far as to include a Fahey Discography (just album title and year, though) and a two-item Bibliography.
This is a must for Fahey fan and anyone interested in acoustic guitar music.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5931903,4,B00EOVF1EQ,I've been a fan of John Fahey since the 70's. Brilliant musician but not for everybody. Same goes with this documentary. If you're not a big fan you may not get all the way through an album of his and here too for this well done film. If you don't know a thing about him at least this is a well done accurate biography about an unusual artist. If you find the subject fascinating then you'll stay till the end because it holds up.,1483488000,2,430,4.130952380952381
5931904,3,B00EOVF1EQ,"An interesting look at an obscure genius.  Could have gone much deeper and not including Leo Kottke into the mix was strange.  For anyone not familiar with John Fahey, this is a good starting point.",1481241600,,198,4.628571428571429

5931907,5,B00EOVF1EQ,"This is a great documentary of a very, very interesting person and musician.  Even though it is somewhat linear in events, it gets at what made John Fahey tick as well as could be expected.  He was a true 'iconoclast' all the way to the end in almost every facet of his life.  Unfortunately, he was another casualty to the damage done to him as a child.",1475452800,,353,4.2388059701492535
5931908,4,B00EOVF1EQ,"The James Gang had a number on their first disc entitled, 'It's Strange."" The Doors sang ""People are Strange"". They were just guessing. John Fahey heard the voice of the turtle and searched for not a vision but Blind Joe Death himself. Adrian Belew and Phil Manzanera flirted with Primitive Guitars, but Fahey was a primitive guitarist exploring the universe of music, while utilizing whatever instrument he found within his reach at whatever moment.

This video is enlightening and confounding. Fahey was everything and did everything before anybody else, but only in limited editions and quantities guaranteed not to recoup even minor expenses. I felt disequilibrium upon viewing this document; I wanted More from this video about an artist who majored in Less.

His ""Christmas"" albums are some of my favorites, and arguably the best holiday recordings ever. His breadth of styles and influences is encyclopedic. Religious and sacred music is as accessible as folk when Fahey renders them. Plantation reels become as arcane as jazz fusion, yet lose none of their compelling qualities.

Genius? Idiot savant? Master musician? Channel to another dimension? Check out this video, because like Sun Ra the Milky Way Express has been loaded and left this Station. And their tickets are One Way only.",1475020800,5,1295,5.186602870813397
5931909,1,B00EOVF1EQ,"I never quite got what was do special about Fahey, and this didn't help....the people interviewed seem like they were taken in by some mystical poet who turned out to be a Steve Allen hoax. I saw Fahey once, but he was too drunk to play...he unbuttoned his pants, bummed a smoke from the front row, and tried to play something, but couldn't remember what song he'd tried to start.... People in the doc keep on about how harmonically adventurous he was...all influenced by Bartok and Stravinsky...but the sparse(way too sparse) clips of him are mostly simple slide melodies over a single drone chord...or just some simple chord changes. Maybe if there were more and better examples of his music interspersed with the praises from misfits and exes, there could have a revelation, but I couldn't even make it to the end...",1474243200,,819,4.774647887323944

5931917,4,B00EOVF1EQ,Very entertaining.  I have several of his records dating back to 1970 when I discovered his music in high school.  The film had several opportunities to delve deeper into his life but perhaps it was a lack of funding that kept the film makers from further explorations.,1457395200,,269,4.702127659574468
5931918,5,B00EOVF1EQ,"What a fascinating man John Fahey was! I have several of his records, including the Christmas albums, ""Of Rivers and Religion,"" ""Death Chants, Breakdowns, and Military Waltzes,"" and the box set ""Your Past Comes Back To Haunt You."" The insight on this movie from other musicians, friends, people in the record industry, and even a former wife of John Fahey add so much color to the painting which is John Fahey. This film, like Mr. Fahey, is an American treasure.",1453939200,,462,4.7875
5931919,5,B00EOVF1EQ,"John Fahey has been one of my favorite acoustic guitar players since I saw him in Harvard Square around 1970. I saw him several times since then before he died. He was a genius, pure an simple. He was an interesting, if troubled, character but my relationship with him is through his music. Nonetheless, this is a fascinating little film.",1449014400,2,338,4.65
5931920,4,B00EOVF1EQ,"Interesting , well made film. I would like to have seen more performance footage  and more on those who influenced Fahey but all in all an enjoyable piece on a ground breaking musician",1438819200,,184,4.575757575757576
5931921,5,B00EOVF1EQ,"I've loved this artist's approach to the guitar since I started playing. Very influential to my own, as I never had the chops to play like the ""guitar gods"". I could do, to an extent, what he did and it filled me with joy. Hey! This is not my calling in life, yet he made my life better. Enough about me...the doc was well done and I enjoyed the extended interviews. Well done! Glad I found it!",1426464000,,394,4.12987012987013

5931923,5,B00EOVF1EQ,"I didn't know a lot about Fahey before watching this, but I found this chronicle of his life utterly poignant and fascinating, and it gave me a much deeper appreciation for his haunting and original compositions. I was especially impressed with the special features ~ the interviews were quite extensive and the one with Pete Townshend was unexpected and quite brilliant. There are also a lot of amazing musical performances in the special features by other artists who were influenced by Fahey. Well worth owning and would make a great gift for any fan of blues or roots music.",1413504000,3,578,4.848484848484849

5931926,2,B00EOVF1EQ,"Fahey lived a long time and went through many phases.  This doc obsesses on his last years, perhaps because of the documentarian's connections age-wise, and partly because it would have been easier to make.  Very little new here, but its focus makes it an unbalanced, depressing watch for the most part.",1400889600,5,303,4.921568627450981
5931927,4,B00EOVF1EQ,"I was friends with John Fahey the last 3 years of his life, as his personal photographer. The film was a snapshot of him, but could have had a little more input from some of his other good friends and fellow musicians, like John Doan and Country Joe McDonald.. If you didn't know anything about John, it would be a great introduction.",1400198400,3,334,4.403225806451613
5931928,4,B00EOVF1EQ,"After reading some of the negative reviews, I wasn't sure I was even going to like this. The finished product is actually very good. Yes, I get tired of Townsend ""the expert"" but he seems to respect Fahey quite a bit. This is NOT a performance film but there's plenty of those available. Okay ,one question , where's Kottke ? Rumor has it they hated each others guts which I kind of enjoy.
Addendum; I just read where Leo Kottke gave an eloquent eulogy at Fahey's funeral which should also lay to rest any rumors regarding their squabble.",1400025600,3,538,4.5
5931929,2,B00EOVF1EQ,"Thank you, 'ana banana', for saying it first. Fahey's contributions to western culture have become so meaningful and important to me over the last 15 years that I didn't want to say anything bad about this film. Watching brought feelings similar to the patient indulgence I feign during an inept mourner's tribute at a funeral: The interlocutor's relationship to the deceased was different from mine, and he meant well in his galumphing insensitive way. Smile and nod through the good moments, and curb the wincing through the rest in respect for the dead.

It was fun to get a glimpse of Joe Bussard. A few of the performers in the Bonus Features did some interesting things. But by and large the hipster douche bags clearly did not get it, and the decision by the director to include their blas generalizations indicates that either he also does not get it, or assumes that his target audience does not. Dopey babbling about how awesome and influential someone is, and the illuminating observation that he ""really changed everything"" are appropriate for film biographies of many pop stars. John Fahey is not one of them (antecedent of your choice, there.) Where was Thurston Moore? I have no idea what his comments or the quality thereof might have been, but is absence is interesting.

I am far from a Pete Townshend hater. I like Pete. But I am tremendously fatigued by hearing the same five sentences that he shuffles around when providing commentary about any performer, cultural era, or musical subject. He manages to drag ""X's rhythm-and-blues roots"" into any topic, this commentary on Fahey being the most preposterous I've heard. I wonder why our director edited out the inevitable bit about ""Naked Lunch."" Pete's stock commentary in countless interviews possibly can be explained by the fact that Townshend has been an extremely busy man for many decades. While not laudable, it is understandable that he would settle on a group of statements that reflect well both on himself and on whomever the subject may be as progressive, fun, and intelligent artists, while not disclosing whether he actually knows anything about the subject. The hipster douche bags deserve no such slack, and I think they actually have a lot of time on their hands. Time which they misused trying to learn to play John Fahey's songs like John Fahey, a bad idea that provides further evidence that they do not get it.

The inclusion of the footage with Laura Weber (the original 'Peggy Hill' before Sarah Palin stole that character) gives us a little insight into the real man. Surely there are people living who could have illuminated the obtuse magic, the silent confoundary, the musical Godzilla born of post-Harry Smith mutating fallout.",1399248000,16,2726,4.9475982532751095
5931930,1,B00EOVF1EQ,"OK, look. . .although not as s***ty as Calt's Patton book, this movie is self-indulgent, erratic, and tedious.
Being one of Fahey's most ardent fans I was quite excited about its release and pre-ordered a copy.
Alas, beauty is sovereign and not in the beholder's eye. . .sure seems like most folks don't really know what beauty is nor can they tell the difference between average and GREAT.
Seems like Cullingham discovered Fahey rather recently and one imagines he was so awed that he sought more Fahey info and finding no movie he's all like,""well, consider it made!"".
Oh, what this movie could've been!
Far too much focus on the last years and far too many interviews with hipster douche bags who don't know or 'get' Fahey either.
At least now we have Mr. Guerrieri's tremendous book.
Looking forward to Mr. Lowenthal's book.
I suppose now I'm gonna have to make a great Fahey film. . .worth its salt.

5931932,3,B00EOVF1EQ,"This review comes from the perspective of a long time Fahey fan.  It pretty much does tell the story of the late John Fahey, the preeminent genius composer for acoustic guitar of the second half of the 20th Century, and presents and captures the vibe beautifully.

Artistically, this is a true labor of love.  The art, sequencing and care are second to none.  The visuals accurately get the importance and impact of slow moving water, trains, the Sligo River and various Takoma scenes upon John Fahey's psyche and muse.  Turtles and animated line drawings of Fahey fading in and out of railroad tracks and Maryland wilderness sets the ambiance from the start and core fans will recognize and appreciate the sources.  All of these scenes are set to the most appropriate contextual music imaginable... Fahey himself!  This truly captures Fahey's vibe from those formative years and we grow to understand and feel how he could so easily make time stand still or radically shift tempos, all while drifting in and out of total dissonance... right under our noses, yet completely unnoticed by the casual listener.  Who but Fahey could stand the Mississippi river still in its bed while the volk notice only the humidity?  Kudos to the artistic direction... it all just flows and feels so right.

It is hard to say whether this appeals to a Fahey aficionado or a casual fan.  Take simple things... such as the omnipresent turtles.  There is really not enough background for a casual fan who is bound to wonder at all of this turtle imagery.  For the deep Fahey fan, why not expound a little on the stories about Kottke and Fahey's work with these turtles.  Likewise, dropping the ""Koonaklastier"" and the ""big K"" is only going to mystify a casual fan while a deep Fahey fan might like to hear a bit more, or perhaps even hear the term in context from a reading (with visual) from a relatively obscure out of print Fahey publication such as ""The Best of John Fahey"" book with its quirky and wonderfully rambling visual layout.  Likewise with Blind Willie Johnson's ""Praise God I'm Satisfied""... the imagery is great and the story is quickly told, but told out of order.  Hence the primary point of it... its immediate physically sickening impact upon Fahey and his subsequent conversion is glossed over, if not lost completely.

There are some really nice touches that only a Fahey aficionado could possibly appreciate, such as the music selection for the Skip James segment.  It includes the motif which Fahey so proudly lifted for part of the powerful intro to ""Stomping Tonight on the Pennsylvania/Alabama Border"", i.e. ""The opening chords are from the last movement of Vaughan Williams' Sixth Symphony. It goes from there to a Skip James motif. Following that it moves to a Gregorian chant, Dies Irae. It's the most scary one in the Episcopal hymn books - it's all about the day of judgement. Then it returns to the Vaughan Williams chords, followed by a blues run of undetermined origin, then back to Skip James and so forth.""  Here again, the artistic treatment of these scenes simply cannot be praised enough.

As good as the creative direction is, the editorial choices on this effort are baffling at best.  Any knowledgeable Fahey fan will be mystified by the inexplicably overwhelming presence of Pete Townshend throughout this documentary, while a casual fan might wrongly assume that he knows quite a bit about Fahey.  In reality, Townshend cites 4 incorrect genres including ""R&B"" for Fahey, appears to be near completely unaware of his work and reveals that he has only heard one Fahey LP, ""Vol 4 Transfiguration of Blind Joe Death"".  Indeed, their only connection appears to be an unfathomable letter which Fahey once sent to Townshend regarding a Who rock operas.  Actually, that's typically inscrutable Fahey, really kind of cool and it does make for 2 or 3 interesting minutes.  But that snippet is the beginning and the end of what should have been included from this interview.  Instead, Townshend consumes perhaps 40% or more of the total video time including the extras.  I've revised my review upon realizing that I made a similar mistake in letting Townshend consume a similar share of it.  Suffice to say, the most bloviating rock star of my g g generation knows nothing about Fahey and admits as much if you pay attention.  Indeed, Justin Bieber's thoughts on Fahey could be no less and no more meaningless.

So, despite the artistic quality of the DVD I have to give this a 3.  Little room was left over for other interviews and outside of his wife Melody and a few others we generally have an over concentration of folks who came to know Fahey in his last decade.  To get an idea of what is missing, you really need to read Steve Lowenthal's ""Dance of Death: The Life of John Fahey, American Guitarist"".  There are dozens of fascinating individuals who are knowledgeable, accessible and willing to offer insights into Fahey from every point in his career.  It is certainly hard work to track them down, but the editors could easily have shortened it or punted to their great creative team by allowing them to work their magic on some more imagery.

The startlingly obvious omission which immediately springs to mind is the vista for the mesmerizing ""View East from the B & O Viaduct and the Riggs Road intersection"" off of ""The  Yellow Princess"".  I have wanted to see this view for decades.  Fahey wrote it down to remember it and reads it carefully in the Great Santa Barbara Oil Slick concert to make sure that people know where it is.  While it can't be any Grand Canyon, people have been known to hunt down this view which inspired such a powerfully evocative composition for over 40 years.  I shudder to think that this may have lost out to pointless pontificating in ill chosen interviews.

On a personal note, I appreciated the chance to discover George Winston's music on this DVD.  I was a huge Michael Hedges fan but quite underwhelmed with everything else that I heard in the Windham Hill catalog.  William Ackerman, the Windham Hill founder was a Fahey fan and as a result both Fahey and Kottke came to be mistakenly lumped in with these directionless and metronomic open tuned New Age noodling guitar styles.  Life is not fair, and while Kottke shrugged it off in an interview and appreciated the greater sales levels that this 80's fad generated, I personally sympathized with Fahey and his vocal resentment and complete rejection of any association with these styles which were diametrically opposed to everything which he had ever composed.  Unfortunately I gave up on Windham Hill before I made it to Mr. Winston.  I am going to rectify that mistake now.",1392076800,25,6691,4.799301919720768
8607641,5,B00EOVF1EQ,"This is a fascinating, beautifully photographed documentary of the life of the ""primitive"" (i.e. self-taught) solo guitarist John Fahey, revealed as an eccentric, creative, alcoholic man.  I only owned one of his albums, and it seemed to be a misprint, like a rare coin that was faultily minted, in that one side of the LP was obviously Fahey playing straightforward folk music on a solo acoustic guitar with no vocals, whereas the other side of the LP consisted of songs by a soft rock, electric band with vocals.  I should have saved it for its value as a rarity.  I saw him perform live at a small nightclub in Pasadena, CA during the mid-'80s.  When he was playing guitar, the music seemed like quite ordinary folk music, not impressive at all.  All the time before and between sets he was drinking from a beer bottle or bottles.  Hearing that most of his playing on this film is much better than what I heard on my LP and at the nightclub, I'm determined to listen to a wider range of his music.",1516492800,,1000,4.497237569060774

 I won't make this long as a lot of reviews are pretty lengthy here.
  Basically if you discovered Fahey a few months ago this might be decent. If you have a lot of his work already and have read up, not so much. Broad generalizations are made as you would say about many of the greats. Very little live raw footage and a bunch of others going on about Fahey. Yes Pete Townsend is famous and influential himself but I have little interest in watching him talk for that long.
  Also it has boring animation sequences and filler.
