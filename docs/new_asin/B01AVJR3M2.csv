7613650,5,B01AVJR3M2,"Started watching on Netflix and fell in love with the series. In an odd way, a bit like Big Bang with Doc Martin being a bit like Sheldon. While sometimes one wants to yell at him, there are so many times he drops everything to attend to ""emergencies"". Will he ever ""mellow out""?",1505347200,,279,4.283018867924528

A true delight in every sense of the word.  My husband and I can't wait to see the next episode, it's that good.  It arrived in a timely manner, and was packed well.  If you're looking for something that will make you smile, Doc Martin is the show to watch.  A surprise around every corner.",1502668800,,442,4.407407407407407

7613680,5,B01AVJR3M2,"'Doc Martin' is one of those shows, I have found that gets better as it ages. However, the first seven series were very entertaining. There was something a little bit strange about the main character, Doc Martin, played by Martin Clunes, but, since he was a surgeon, that made some sense.

Dr. Martin Ellingham, a  London surgeon developed a horrible reaction to the sight of blood. He also does not have a good bedside manner, and he looks for another job. A GP is needed in a small village in a Cornish fishing village. He had spent summers there and, indeed, loved the area.

Martin was written and created by Dominic Minghella.  Martin became the charmless, and insensitive physician, who is a brilliant diagnostician. He is so impossible I felt myself rooting for him. He is an off beat but good man. Once he is in the village, he sets up an office, people come by just to see him, and then they all develop unusual conditions, that he can almost always solve. In the process he falls in love with the schoolteacher Louisa, played by Carolyn Catz. She discovers she is attracted to him, but she doesn't really like him.

Every week a new medical condition is discovered, often including a interesting storyline.  Doc Martin gains weight and loves the town. The town is an intricate turn of hillside streets and scenic overlooks. The town characters are the receptionists Lucy Punch and Katherine Parkinson; Ian McNeice, as a plumber ; Joe Absolom as McNeice's  son; Stewart Wright and John Marquez as police constables,  and Stephanie Cole as Martin's stubborn Aunt Joan.  I began to think quite often that Doc Martin has Aspergers. He has all the characteristics. But, it makes no difference, really. This is a character who has soul, a romantic comedy we can all relate to.
