Moves are rushed, mostly not linked and without any strategic consideration. But the primary problem is that they aren't explained in detail and most of them are actually performed incorrectly.

The reason why I don't give this instructional just one star is because not all techniques are bad, although all of them lack important details. In my opinion the performer himself have not mastered the moves, and he shows.

On the site (google kibun) you will find a few clips, keep in mind that they are not the worse and judge yourself.",1199059200,,679,4.512195121951219
8098932,5,B000CFX4EM,"This was the first DVD I got when I wanted to begin to learn Jiu-Jitsu. So far it has way more content then other DVD's I have. The instructors go over tons and tons of moves and if you don't understand them you can just hit the rewind button. The DVD covers takedowns, chokes, basic positions, sweeps, and even some wrestling moves.",1175817600,,333,4.387096774193548
