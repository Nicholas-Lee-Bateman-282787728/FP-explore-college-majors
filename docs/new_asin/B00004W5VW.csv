7925033,4,B00004W5VW,"I am a big fan of this absurd tv show.  This dvd is NOT the tv show.  It is made up of clips from before the tv show, when he was still doing cable access.  I think the dvd is quite funny and at many points I was laughing out loud.  Of course, we are all hoping for the actual show to be released on dvd...but this will keep fans busy until that happens.",1026259200,4,354,3.7432432432432434
7925034,3,B00004W5VW,"The First half of this DVD is no good at all, well except for a few isolated scenes, but the Canterbury Tales are not funny at all, and oxymen girls isn't funny either.  The second half of this DVD is one of the funniest things i have ever seen though.  It's worth the price because of the second half.  Thats about all i have to say.",1003276800,5,334,4.03030303030303
7925035,5,B00004W5VW,"This DVD contains what the producers consider to be the best (worst) moments of the Tom Green Show as originally broadcast on the Rogers' Ottawa Cable Access channel and The Comedy Network in 1997.  Some of the segments  available on this DVD include what happens when you try to hang your own  creation on the walls of the National Gallery of Canada, flaming feet in  the streets of Ottawa, bum-bum guitar serenades, asking questions from  angry drunks, playing with the P.A. system in department stores, and other  very disgusting, repulsive and very, very funny items of interest.
This  stuff is so totally off the wall that I haven't laughed this hard since I  saw the South Park movie.  Although many of these skits are completely  tasteless, they are still a joy to watch.  Once I get some kind of cable  service, it will be interesting to see how good his current MTV version is  in comparison with the material on this DVD.  In the meantime, I have  thoroughly enjoyed this disc which offered much more reasonably priced  entertainment than a lot of other DVDs currently on the market.
Also  included is Tom Green as a guest of Open Mike with Mike Bullard, the Dini  Petty show and Camilla Scott.  The Mike Bullard appearances are so absurd  that they belongs more with the Tom Green Show than with Open Mike.  And  again, these are mainly original broadcast tapes, not multi-generation  copies.
It's surprising his .... wasn't hauled in jail especially after  what he did to his parents' car and house!  And a good thing too.  In six  short years, Tom Green has gone from an Ottawa cable access show to a hit  TV show on MTV.  Even some the hosts of the shows where he was a guest have  been in the business for a lot longer than he has.  And they haven't  reached anywhere near Tom Green's huge cult status.
This DVD is a great  value for Tom Green fans everywhere.",967334400,42,1875,4.56797583081571
