8674159,3,B00MR9HNDE,"I think this could have been a great movie, but as it was I had to just say it was ok.

My first complaint was with the review listed on the jacket of the DVD. It in no way conveys what the movie is about, except for the fact that the movie is based in small town Oklahoma. And I have to admit I was somewhat confused at the end and the flashbacks used throughout the film weren't necessarily helpful. I would much rather have my ""light bulb"" moment during a film than way after finishing it. And to tell you the truth I'm not sure that ""light bulb"" moment made anything clearer.

All this being said, the film did make me think and I love that in any movie. It did have some brilliant symbolism. And the fact that I am writing a review and still thinking about this movie, even still trying to figure it out, means it left an impression. I guess that's why I believe with a few changes it could have been a great movie!",1433116800,2,920,4.105555555555555

I won't spoil the movie, but it had me on the edge of my seat!!",1422144000,,210,3.883720930232558
8674162,2,B00MR9HNDE,I just really did not like this movie. I guess sometimes low budget does equal bad. I was confused and just didn't care to become un-confused.,1421625600,,142,4.5
