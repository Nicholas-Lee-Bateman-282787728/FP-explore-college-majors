863073,4,6304393121,"SECRETS AND LIES is a 1996 film by Mike Leigh that, appropriately enough, is concerned with the things that members of a family conceal from each other.

Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), a black woman in London who has made a successful career as an optician, knew from a young age that she was adopted, but only after her adopted mother's death does she decide to look up her birth mother. Hortense is shocked to find that it is Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn), not just white but living in near-poverty and wallowing in regret. Cynthia has a tumultuous relationship with her acknowledged daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook), who she fears to be repeating her own youthful mistakes. Cynthia also finds its hard to relate to her brother Maurice (Timothy Spall) and his cold wife Monica (Phyllis Logan), who have done well from a photo shop business. Hortense's entry into this family ultimately shatters their miserable status quo, but not without some heartbreak on the way.

At this point in his career, Mike Leigh had perfected a filmmaking technique by which he had his actors live out their roles in everyday situations in the street for weeks before he started shooting. Consequently, by the time these actors were captured on film, they are totally convincing as their characters, and the characters are fleshed out through the little details that Leigh allowed to bring to them in improvising. The viewer feels that he knows these people deeply. Leigh also has a way of mixing pathos and humour. He not only will insert a comedic shot after a poignant one, but he'll then present ambiguous images where the viewer is unsure whether he should laugh or cry.

While the acting and that dash of humour is quite powerful, there are elements that hold me back from universally praising this film. I've never been impressed by Leigh's use of music, which feels cheap, and only one shot (a deftly timed outdoor barbecue) was truly impressive in its mis-en-scne. And I find Leigh's previous film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Naked/dp/B004WPYO4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Naked</a>&nbsp;a slightly more successful application of his art. Still, the acting in SECRETS AND LIES is really something, and I would generally recommend this film.",1443657600,,2279,5.2727272727272725
863074,5,6304393121,"Love this movie. I have watched it over and over, so many times. It is so realistic. I feel as if I know the characters, not that my life is similar, but you see these sort of people every day, in real life.  I just hope they can get themselves together.....",1438560000,2,258,4.0588235294117645
863075,5,6304393121,"This Mike Leigh movie set in London tells the story of a middle aged women (Cynthia) who lives a twisted life with her 21 years old daughter in a single parent household. They do low level jobs and neither of them are satisfied with life. She has a brother whom she does not see often who is married with no kids and his wife does not get on well with her either. Things get into a different dimension when a young lady comes in their life after finding out Cynthia being her biological mother. Then all secrets and lies got revealed and their lives change forever.

The screwed relationships between the character might first seem distant to many but upon close evaluation, I believe everyone can find a bit of resemblance with their family relations. The realistic depiction of the relations as well as the outstanding acting of the entire cast offer a perfect cinema feast. Brenda Blethlyn's performance as the main character in the movie is especially remarkable and she probably showed the best performance of her entire career.

If you like hardcore drama with no visual effects or action, this movie is for you.",1429920000,,1118,4.698979591836735

863078,3,6304393121,"This movie is supposed to be original because it was unscripted, all I can say is that it shows, the main problem is that Cynthia as played by Brenda Blethyn is just one sodden blubbering mess, her default setting seems to be a sniffling sobbing wreck, with harridan shrieking for variety, it's just too hard to find any kind of sympathy for her, the most I could summon was an irritated desire that someone could shove some prozac down her throat, that or some allergy pills for the constant sniffling. She was so annoying she detracted from the excellent performance of actors like Marianne Jean-Baptiste who played Hortense, restrained , clear cut, she could portray a wealth of emotions with just a glance, Claire Rushbrook was pretty good as Cynthia, with hard edged prickly aggression. It was a movie with a potential to be great, it was just marred by Brenda's OTT (over the top) Cynthia, a good director would have reined her in, or at least given her a hanky and told her to blow her nose",1419379200,,997,4.606741573033708

863185,5,6304393121,"Mike Leigh has a way with spinning stories about disgruntled families in a way that feels so effortless and light despite the monumental weight that is often associated to them.  Secrets & Lies is one of his most beloved films (and one of his most critically acclaimed) and it is also one of the hardest to come across.  Seriously people, whats with the lack of available DVDs?

Emotionally driven yet astutely reserved, Secrets & Lies drifts along at a pace that keeps us intently glued to the screen without unveiling too much, too soon.  This story of a black woman who traces her birth mother down to a white woman living a lie and frantically so, is one of real depth and character.  What makes the film work so well is the tremendous cast, from Oscar nominees Brenda Blethyn and Marianne Jean-Baptiste to the real lingering presence, Timothy Spall and his scene partner, Phyllis Logan.  Spall is a marvelous example of bottled up emotions, displaying just enough to keep us constantly tuned into his next move.  Blethyn is frantic and chaotic, effectively so, and there really is nothing more heartwarming than the smile across Jean-Baptistes face as she takes in the reality of her new family.

Secrets & Lies has some dark elements, but Leigh directs this in such a way that it all feels so organically pure.  Even when the foreknowledge that something unspeakable has taken place or will take place or will be unveiled, there is something bittersweet (the emphasis on sweet) about the whole thing, which makes it feel honest and heartfelt.

This is considered Leighs finest film, for a reason.",1398211200,,1602,4.813868613138686

Reviews describe this movie as ""hysterically funny and profoundly sad"".  While there were flashes of humor in the movie, I would agree with the ""profoundly sad"" characterization and there was plenty of gloom to go around here.

863405,5,6304393121,"Over-the-top emotionally, boldly going where few films ever dare to go, Mike Leigh's ""Secrets and Lies"" never fails, even after many repeated viewings, to impress with its naked, in-your-face emotionalism. Just when you think that Leigh's characters can go no further, cannot possibly peel away another layer to reveal a truth about themselves...a character or characters does just that.
Roxanne's (Claire Rushbrook) birthday ""party"" at her brother Maurice's (a terrific performance by Timothy Spall) house is one of the greatest scenes ever committed to film: all the secrets and lies of this family are revealed, reviled and laid out for all to accept or not. Think ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" times 10 as the old saying the truth shall set you free is applied generously as the wine flows in this scene. All of the characters attain a kind of redemption through speaking the truth: simple in concept but so very difficult in practice.
Brenda Blethyn's Cynthia is a big basket of exposed nerve endings all of which are , at the drop of a hat, ready to explode...and explode they do by way of a performance that on the one hand grates on your nerves while on the other simply tugs at your heart. You will hate Cynthia at times but ultimately she cannot, as Willy Loman by way of Arthur Miller says...be ignored.
""Secrets and Lies"" is one of the greatest films ever made. It makes its play not only for your mind and succeeds but it also makes a play for your heart and soul...and succeeds in a way that only the greatest films do: with a simple re-telling of those things we all recognize as the truths of life.",1185667200,2,1617,4.697183098591549

In terms of acting ability EVERYONE in this film, even the cute dog who poses for the camera, gives the performance of their lives and should've received awards. Few films leave me trembling with emotion but also loving all the characters. Timothy Spall's performance is just TOTALLY beyond explanation. I just loved his line ""That's life isn't it? Somebody always has to draw the short straw"" when he was speaking to the young lady with a facial scar. The power behind that line really got me thinking.

 In the end basically we ALL draw the short straw although we might get there by different means.

Brenda Blethyn must've been an emotional wreck after this film similar to the character she plays. How she kept up constant weeping baffles me.

 Marianne Jean -Baptiste is just beautiful. What a stunning, multi-talented actress.

 Claire Rushbrook's character reminds me of so many characters i knew back in London. Good , honest hearted people, slightly near the edge but then we ALL are near the edge in truth.

 A more candid look at life could not be put on film but then this is what Mike Leigh excels in.

 Leigh's criticised sometimes for making his scenes dismal (although it's sunny throughout this one) and his characters wretched, beyond salvation and to be pitied but far from it. After all what he unearths is the truth that exists in families, the skeletons in the closets.

 If this film had been done in Hollywood it would never have the same impact.

 It's a petty argument indeed but some folk have suggested that Marianne Jean-Baptistes character is too dark skinned for her considered being of mixed parentage. I can tell them otherwise. It CAN occur on rare occasions and i have firsthand proof of this.  Genetics is something we still don't have full control over, thankfully.

My reunion has been eerily similar to the characters' in this film-

an Aunt, who thought my sister had a right to know about me, who loved her nieces and resented their mother for squandering her oppurtunity at motherhood, when she couldn't have the children she so desperately wanted, and who finally faced the truth of that resentment, and the reality of her situation.

A birthmother, who though she can't quite get it together, for the love of her children, tries to reach within herself to find the strength to face her past, to turn to the truth instead of secrets.

The quiet person in the background that holds everyone together, when they are trying their best to tear themselves apart -that would be the photographer in the film- who, although seemingly disinterested with his job a times, it's quite clear it's his only escape from the dysfunction of his family, and the only light in his existence.

The adoptee- who, though she wants to know her roots so badly, is ill prepared for these wounds that have run so deep, for so long. She doesn't want to displace anyone in the process of the reunion, but fights her own internal needs constantly, so she can get some peace and closure, and not just have the door slammed in her face. Although she has done well for herself, you can see in Hortense' eyes, that piece of herself is missing, that part of herself that isn't like anyone else she's known in her life. That is the burden you can see visibly lifted of Hortense' shoulders in the final scenes, and you can even see those little pieces finding their way back into everyone's hearts.

Some of the looks, and emotions you can see Hortense going through, are ones I just felt a month ago, or even last week. Unless you have walked in her shoes, you couldn't know what some of the looks she gives Monica mean. For me, though, those looks were some of the most poignant moments in the film. This film definetely has all the elements of a great film, but more importantly to me, is how accurate this film can be when looking at the reality of reunions, what they are about, what they feel like. The fact is, reunions bring out all the skeletons in the closet, they reveal the truth, in the end, there are no more secrets and lies, (perhaps that's why people have fought here in the state's to keep the records sealed).

It's just too bad the state's don't allow adoptees or birthparents the right to heal, like Britain does in this film (with their open records). They add to the pain with their antiquated take on adoption. If you are so moved by this film, I encourage you to look into supporting an open records cause.",1166572800,3,2865,4.508670520231214

Each time she thought she'd found it, she was left holding the baby. She's looked after her father until his death, and remained in the dilapidated rented home, working at a factory.

 Cynthia's brother Maurice [Timothy Spall] is a successful photographer whose wife has little time for Cynthia. These two women are both jealous of what the other has.

863495,5,6304393121,"Dysfunction is better than no function at all in Mike Leigh's ""Secrets and Lies"". Finally available on DVD to coincide with the Oscar nomination actress Imelda Staunton received for ""Vera"" (another film directed by Leigh), ""Secrets and Lies"" tells the story of a successful and well-to-do black woman Hortense Cumberbatch ( Oscar nominated Marianne Jean-Baptiste of ""Without a Trace"") who tracks down her birth mother. It seems her mother was a lower-class white woman named Monica Purley (Brenda Blethyn, Golden Globe winner and multiple Oscar nominee). Monica denies that she's Hortense's mother but gradually comes to accept and embrace her daughter despite their differences. A bittersweet comedy full of commanding performances, ""Secrets and Lies"" was a surprising box office success (hence its recognition by the Academy and the multiple nominations it deservedly earned). With rewarding performances all around and Leigh's naturalistic style, ""Secrets and Lies"" was a winner whether or not it pulled down any gold at Oscar time. Not bad for a guy who used to play in a band with Bryan Ferry of Roxy Music fame.

Many of Leigh's films feature uncompromising performances and partially improvised scripts. This collaborative method makes Leigh's films both unique and memorable even when they aren't very good. Luckily, ""Secrets and Lies"" is very, very good.

Sadly, this is a pretty bare bones affair. We get the original theatrical trailer and the theatrical trailers for ""Author! Author!"", ""Blood & Wine"" and ""Class Action"". It's a pity as 10 years on, it might have been interesting to catch up with the actors and the impact that their Oscar nominations had on their respective careers. There's also no commentary track but the drama speakes pretty well for itself.

A terrific, bittersweet comedy ""Secrets and Lies"" details the ordinary secrets we keep to ourselves and hide from each other. Leigh's marvelous direction and the ensemble cast's terrific performances elevate this from a simple movie-of-the-week on something like the Lifetime channel. Leigh's inspired approach to improvising much of the movie's dialogue with his cast (based on his character sketches and background story) creates a drama that is much closer to neo-realism in approach than just about any other film made within the last two decades. Although Leigh's made a number of stunning films, ""Secrets and Lies"" certainly deserves its reputation as one of his finest glimpses behind the curtain of subterfuge that's a part of the ordinary people in this terrific story.",1110153600,20,2555,5.303703703703704

863498,5,6304393121,"The film begins with the funeral of Hortense Cumberbatch's (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) stepmother. Hortense, a black successful optometrist, is highly curious about the identity of her birthmother as she has been aware since childhood that she was adopted. Through an adoption agency she receives the papers that prove the identity of her birth mother, which initially seems to be erroneous, as she appears to be white. Hortense then decides to take the big step to contact her birth mother whom she has never known for over thirty years.

The mother, Cynthia Rose Purley, (Brenda Blethyn) a chain smoking co-dependent anxiety ridden factory worker lives in the same council house, which her parents lived in as she nursed them to their death bed. Cynthia shares the house with her daughter, Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook), who works as a street cleaner. The relationship between Roxanne and Cynthia is strained as Cynthia is clinging onto Roxanne through questions and continuous hassle. Roxanne is also spoiled by Cynthia's younger and successful brother Maurice (Timothy Spall) and his wife, which seems to add strain between Cynthia and Roxanne.

Secrets & Lies is a wonderful film that projects a family's lack of communication and difficulty in understanding one another. Mike Leigh touches the very essence of humanity as the family avoids the difficult issues through white lies and tiny secrets. The family creates several little fabrications that have been complied over several decades and when Hortense appears she functions as catalyst for the truth. It should be mentioned that the secret of Hortense is only a minor part of the all the secrets.

The intimate direction of Mike Leigh creates an authentic family atmosphere that is brought to the audience as if it was the audience's own family. This generates a genuine feeling within the audience as the story unfolds. The cast performs brilliantly as they enhance the cinematic quality of the story. Brenda Blethyn performs as Cynthia with real conviction, and she received the reward for best actress for this part in Cannes in 1996. Ultimately, Secrets & Lies offers a truly brilliant cinematic event that touches the soul as the characters exorcise the family demons.",1095724800,7,2229,5.203342618384401

A small film about a family and the small day to day trials and tribulations they go through. It's very realistic and deals with the the most average everyday things. What makes this film so amazing is how it is able to present this window into the lives of this group of people with such wit and insight, sadness and honesty; ultimately resulting in a film which is tender and uplifting and hopeful.
Tha acting is simply awesome. No other words to put it. Everyone from Brenda Blethyn to Timothy Spall to Marianna Jean Baptiste, to Claire Rushbrook, all take turns stealing scenes in performances that are so natural and on point that at times, it doesn't even feel like they're acting. This is true acting that cuts straight to the heart. The script is wonderful in that it provides so many little details that one wouldn't think to include in a movie. Just the smallest things which somehow bring the characters to life.

The scenes are very well crafted, with close attention to detail and strong, credible dialogue. The performances are all terrific and natural, and the story flows well although the pace is a bit slow at times. It`s certainly one of the most interesting movies about family ties and the need of belonging somewhere, also focusing the differences and personality flaws that keep people away from each other.

863633,5,6304393121,"To say that this film is drama is one thing. To say it is British drama is something entirely different. There is something about Mike Leigh's work that captures British life so well that it's almost too close-to-home to find comfortable. But, then again, and at the same time, it can be hilariously funny, gripping and wholly entertaining. The lifestyles of the characters, intertwined or not, are so believable that you can get totally drawn-in to the story's simple, but desperately effective plot. Every funny moment in this film stems from what is basically day-to-day living that anyone would normally over-look as humour, but when it's laid out in front of you in it's most base form, becomes hilarious in the extreme. I have a feeling that more Britsih people rather than American will fully appreciate the humourous implications of much of this film, but I could be pleasently proven wrong. The drama in this film is the flip-side of the coin, but it is just as potent and realistic as the humour. The inter-relationship between the mother and her long-lost daughter (who just decides to introduce herself out of the blue), is tender and, at first, very tense. This tension is also aparent between the mother and her younger, but clearly much more successful, brother, and also his neurotic wife. Perhaps the tension is here because that is the kind of tension you can find in so many 'broken' British households. Or perhaps Mike Leigh has just tapped into what is an untold, if not blatantly obvious truth about any household and any family.
The acting in this film is spot-on, with Brenda Blethyn and Leigh regular Timothy Spall putting on yet more great performances scene after scene. Being British, maybe this isn't so difficult for them; to portray Brit life in it's most basic state? Who knows. Another fine performance in the film is Ron Cook in a small cameo as the alcoholic ex-owner of Tim Spall's photography studio. Cook's charatcer provides a small, well-earned break from the film's deep main story, but also adds a slight melancholy as the characters that witness the arrival of him find themselves looking back on their own lives or successes in different ways. All of this seems to tie in well with the grand finale of the film, where the emotion, family tension, secrets and lies all reach their devastating peak. Watch, and adore.",1000857600,3,2359,4.856079404466501
863634,5,6304393121,"Apart from listening to the supremely annoying voice of Brenda Blethyn this film is perfect. It is not overdrawn, overlong, or too far out of the realm of reality. The story is unusual, the script is well written, the cast is very down to earth seeming (which is something special about British films. Real people seem to populate the cast rather than out of this world beauties). Blethyn is excellent in her role as a beleaguered single mother, rather ditzy,...and not overly bright. She struggles to make ends meet and to take care of her daughter, who is also not the most pleasant person to get along with. A second storyline focuses on Blethyn's character's brother, Maurice, who is a photographer. He is heartbroken because he and his wife have done everything in the world to try to have children but cannot. They are the only other two people in the world, besides Blethyn, who know that Blethyn once gave birth to a child (when she was barely a teen herself) which she gave up for adoption. One day a woman named Hortense phones Blethyn and tells her that she is the daughter Blethyn once gave up for adoption. Blethyn is horrified, and this starts her emotional roller coaster and her awakening a whole host of new feelings about this daughter. They start up a relationship, but only after Blethyn is reluctantly forced to conquer the fact that this abandoned daughter is black. At first she is incredulous and refuses to believe it and says she never had sex with a black man, but she has a breakdown when she realises she did. It is not clearly spelled out for us (which is another fabulous aspect of foreign films which leave much to the viewer's conjecture) but it is alluded to that Blethyn may have been raped by Hortense's father. Blethyn hides the relationship with Hortense from the daughter she has reared and also from her brother and his wife, until she invites Hortense to a birthday party for her younger daughter and introduces her as a friend from work. Eventually Blethyn breaks down and cries (as she often does throughout the movie, which lends emotional credibility but is incredibly hard on the ears) and confesses that Hortense is her daughter. This creates a huge amount of turmoil but all turns out all right in the end. A beautifully written film and worth viewing.",992131200,3,2300,4.695544554455446

863636,5,6304393121,"I find it impossible to recommend this movie strongly enough.  I recently saw it for the first time, and oddly enough knew next to nothing about it.  A year or so ago I saw TOPSY-TURVY with some friends, and they were raving about Mike Leigh as a filmmaker.  So, when looking through my local video store for something new and intersting to view, two names jumped out at me from the box:  Mike Leigh and Brenda Blethyn, whose performance in LITTLE VOICE had impressed me greatly.
I absolutely loved TOPSY-TURVY, but I am not sure but that SECRETS AND LIES is the stronger film.  Less flashy, and I can easily imagine someone who does not enjoy dealing exclusively with interpersonal dynamics not particularly enjoying this.  But for anyone who can appreciate an intense family drama, this film will be tough to top.
But the thing that most impressed me about SECRETS AND LIES is the acting.  Brenda Blethyn was even better here than she was in LITTLE VOICE.  In fact, I honestly do not know of any performance by an actor or actress anywhere that I can say is demonstrably better.  I just sat in front of my VCR agog at her performance.  I later read that she won the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival, the British Academy Awards, and the Golden Globe Awards.  The only award she failed to win was the Oscar, for which she was nominated, but which went instead to Frances MacDormand in FARGO.  I loved FARGO and thought MacDormand did a great job, but if you watch these two performances side by side, you gain additional proof that the voters for the Oscars either do not watch all the films or see this as a sort of popularity contest.  Frances MacDormand's performance was cute and her accent was convincing, but Brenda Blethyn's performance was the emotional equivalent of a fist to the guts.  Brenda Blethyn should have swept all the acting awards that year with ease.  I honestly do not remember a performance anywhere in which so much genuine, intense, and overwhelming emotion is projected.  If you have not seen this movie, you owe it to yourself just to see Brenda Blethyn inconceivably great performance.
I was also pleased to see Timothy Spall again, who did such an excellent job of playing so sympathetically Richard Temple (the actor who created the title role in THE MIKAIDO) in TOPSY-TURVY.  I have not seen him in every many roles, but after seeing him perform so well in these two very, very different roles, I very much want to see him again.",988934400,6,2475,4.627002288329519

863638,5,6304393121,"A mild-mannered, intelligent young black woman (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) tracks down her birth mother, Cynthia Purley (Brenda Blethyn), who just happens to be white. That's only the central plot thread in Mike Leigh's very poignant, very funny, very smart family drama, which received well-deserved Oscar nominations for best picture, best director, best actress, best supporting actress, and best original screenplay. A keenly observed piece set in middle-class and upper middle-class England, ""Secrets & Lies"" offers such an abundance of riches it's hard to know where to begin.
The plot is fairly simple, though the emotions beneath it aren't. Cynthia is initially afraid to meet the child she gave up years ago, but eventually opens up and discovers that her long-lost daughter, Hortense, is not only a sweet and refined young lady, but the possible source of the love and affection she wants so badly. She receives none of that sort of attention from her other daughter, Roxanne, a bitter, sharp-tongued council worker who, like her secret half-sister, was conceived out of wedlock. Adding to the tension is Cynthia's relationship with her brother, Maurice, and his socially ambitious wife, Monica. The latter is pained by her inability to have a child, and particularly despises Cynthia, who is able to bear children but, in Monica's mind, unable to provide them with the family environment and opportunities that she can. All of these threads converge at an afternoon birthday party, during which all the pent-up secrets and lies explode like a sequence of fireworks. Emotions are laid bare, the past is revealed, and finally, the film hints, the healing process can begin.
A synopsis really doesn't do full justice to the sheer impact of this film. In fact, it's almost insulting--and irrelevant--to discuss plot at all. ""Secrets & Lies"" isn't about plot in the conventional sense; it's about people. Each character is a complex, fully realized human being, brought to life by superior acting. Brenda Blethyn in particular does a spectacular job, and her Cynthia emerges as one of the most hilarious, endearing, and noble human portraits I've ever seen captured on film. Marianne Jean-Baptiste has a less showy role, but she occupies it with equally genuine warmth and humility. The other performances are consistently excellent, with Timothy Spall (Maurice) and Phyllis Long (Monica), who play tortured but thoroughly sympathetic characters, among the standouts.
The actors are complimented by Leigh's superb direction. Each shot has clearly been carefully thought-out, but the camera is so unobtrusive, so casually observing, that it lends ""Secrets & Lies"" an almost documentary-like feel. And yet, Leigh's compassion for all his characters leaks through every frame. One of the best scenes in the film takes place in a teashop, with Cynthia and Hortense sharing a first meeting that moves from initial awkwardness to humor and hilarity, to intense sadness and finally to catharsis and relief. The scene is an unbroken, unedited single shot lasting for nearly eight minutes, and Blethyn and Jean-Baptiste sustain the dramatic tension for that long without missing a beat. It is a seamless culmination of acting, writing, and cinematography, and represents (I think) one of the most remarkable and honest shots ever committed to celluloid.
Therein lies the secret to the success of ""Secrets & Lies""--every moment in the film feels real. That quality is aided by the fact that, as is the case in all of Leigh's other films, the screenplay is a collaboration between both writer/director and actors. The dialogue never sounds scripted or contrived because most of it has been improvised by the actors themselves; thus, it's no wonder that the characters all but leap off the screen, and that spending time with them is such an engaging and rewarding experience.
Some have criticized the film's overly ""happy"" ending, claiming that it feels a bit too pat to be real. I disagree. The conclusion, though admittedly more optimistic a resolution than most conflicted families can expect, remains utterly true to the characters' personalities and backgrounds. Actually, Leigh trumps the notion that all films attempting to illuminate the human condition must be overly bleak and pessimistic.
""Secrets & Lies"" is not a fast-paced film, and at 152 minutes, it's quite long. It could have gone on for hours and hours as far as I was concerned. Mike Leigh has confirmed my long-held notion that American cinema could definitely learn a thing or two from the sure-and-steady British. Without a doubt, one of the best films, if not the best, of 1996.",965088000,31,4644,5.218206157965194
863639,5,6304393121,"The Brits really have a way of telling stories with blunt humor and realistic situations. This is for sure the case with Mike Leigh's film  'Secrets And Lies'. This is a story about none other than secrets and lies,  and the consequences they bring. Cynthia Rose Purly is a single mother  living in London with her twentyish year old daughter Roxanne. Their  relationship begins to crumble due to a lack of communication and built up  agression from past events. Cynthia's secret is her first born daughter,  Hortense, who was given up for adoption shortly after birth. Emotions rise  when Hortense successfully finds Cynthia, leading to a climactic revealing  and resolving of every characters secrets and lies. Brenda Blethyn is  amazing as Cynthia Purly.

863640,5,6304393121,"Imagine Buffy and Jodie as foul-mouthed, spiteful white trash and you get the picture of this family affair from hell.
If you want someone to blame, see Mike Leigh. The British writer and director has been making  ugly, challenging, and consistently winning dramas for twenty-five years,  and it's about time he gained some popular attention. Here it's Hortense  (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) who gets Leigh's star treatment. She's a black  optometrist in search of her biological mommy who, it turns out, is a  comical cockney white woman named Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn).
With more  courage than I have, Hortense shares coffee with the poor, disheveled  woman. This scene is a gem of slow-burning recognition and pain, as Cynthia  realizes that the successful black woman before her is indeed her child.  The two then meet again and develop a fast friendship.
Meanwhile Cyn's  chubby brother--a gentle soul named Maurice (Timothy Spall)--is busy  keeping his photography studio solvent. Too bad he can't do the same for  his family (Do these people belong on Jerry Springer, or what?).
Leigh  makes the ordinary transcendent. The picture-perfect moments Maurice  captures on film is the metaphor Leigh splendidly uses to make us aware of  the life lived between the camera clicks--life that often forces us to hide  the Secrets and Lies buried within our own hearts.",957657600,6,1361,5.202764976958525

7870171,5,6304393121,"Mike Leighs stunning Cannes Palme dOr winning 1996 drama Secrets & Lies represents this director at the very peak of his form. Featuring universally sensational acting across the board from a stunning cast of Leigh regulars, each character is beautifully and warmly observed in a way which demonstrates the famous Leigh method working at its most incisive. Everyone inhabits the screen so naturally that for long periods of time we forget we are watching a film. Leighs stated intention was initially two-pronged, to flag up the whole subject of adoption and the right of people to be able to find out who their biological parents are (this will be revelatory for north American viewers as birth records are sealed by law in those countries), and to flag up the new generation of young black people who are moving away from the old ghetto stereotypes towards integration within the wider fabric of society. He succeeds gloriously on both counts, but what takes this film even further than that is Leighs depiction of what Rainer Werner Fassbinder called the fascism of everyday life wherein secrets and lies held and told by all causes untold damage especially to those nearest and dearest in the form of emotional repression. This film doesnt only speak to adoptees and black people, it speaks to all of us and in the most extraordinarily moving way. The rest of my review contains spoilers. If you haven't seen don't read.

The two undoubted heroes of the piece are both in the same business as Leigh  they make a living by enabling others to see. Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) is a young black optometrist who having lost her adoptive parents feels emotionally compelled to seek out her biological parents. Her courage to stand up and face the facts makes her an admirable figure of honor and integrity. This is saluted late on by the films other figure who enables people to see, the successful photographer Maurice (Timothy Spall) who wants to live without secrets and lies, but cant out of obligation to his wife Monica (Phyllis Logan) and his sister Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn). Monica won't let him tell anyone that shes sterile and Cynthia won't let him tell anyone that her daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook) has a half-sister somewhere who was given up for adoption as a baby. Everyone assumes Cynthia has told Roxanne, but as we eventually find out, she hasnt. The film is structured over a couple of months leading up to Roxannes 21st birthday party which Maurice and Monica throw at their plush new home. Cynthia decides to bring along her long lost daughter (Hortense of course) and we are given the kind of classic supremely awkward social situation in which Leigh excels. There are many such scenes in his uvre, but this one is quite simply one of the greatest sequences British cinema has to offer, ranging across an enormous emotional range from hilarity as prissy hausfrau Monica shows off her residence to the mocking Cynthia to Bergmanian trauma as the secrets are revealed. In a nutshell though, Hortenses search combined with Maurices determination to unite the three people he loves the most (Monica, Cynthia and Roxanne) forces everyone to see, so enabling this hitherto-dysfunctional family group to sort itself out. As things turn out Roxanne couldn't have hoped for a better birthday present, but we are also left under no illusion that searching out ones biological parents necessarily leads to a happy outcome. Hortense here gets lucky making for Leighs most positive film.

The film is finally a celebration, but its not reached without heart-ache and the fascism of everyday life is most obviously felt in the two relationships that dominate the film  Maurice/Monica and Cynthia/Roxanne. Here we have Leighs perennial concern with class issues. Maurice has done well in his business and his new home announces his arrival into middle class affluence. Cynthia however still works down the local factory and has never left her working class environment. Maurice may be richer than his sister, but it doesnt make him any happier as is shown by Monica nagging him persistently throughout the first two thirds of the film. We do sympathize with her once we learn about her infertility, but poor Maurice is repressed in a series of classic home scenes which no doubt ring true for a great many people enjoying (enduring?) middle class marriage. Their home is a mausoleum to bourgeois respectability and Douglas Sirk, let alone Fassbinder would have relished the latticed windows which imprison those living there. On the other end of the social scale poor Cynthias wretched existence is defined by a series of alternately tragic and hilarious home scenes between her and her disgruntled road-sweeper daughter Roxanne. The loud garden discussion about contraception is a classic as is the scene that immediately follows it as Roxanne is driven out by an obsessive mother who is only trying to talk to her. The mother is all lonely middle age anxiety (Blethyn is just breathtaking in the role) while the daughter is all pent up teenage frustration with her lot. They repress each other to the extent that something has to give. Hortense entering Cynthias life (a stunning 7 minute single static take in a restaurant) is the catalyst for her revival as a woman and watching the two essay a relationship (and its effect on Roxanne who doesnt know whats going on) is one of this films many joys. The film finds a narrative balance between Monica and Cynthia who are both unhappy because each has what the other desperately wants. Cynthia has fertility in spades while Monica has a stable home with a man who loves her. The moment in the party where Monica cries, Youre so lucky, Cynthia is heart-rending for us knowing that Cynthia is the last person in the world at that moment who feels lucky.

As said, the performances are uniformly excellent across the board, but two actors stand out above the rest and they are of course Spall and Blethyn. Spall convinces as the loving and lovable family man who would love to have kids, but cant. His professional background is expertly depicted in a series of photo sittings in his studio where a variety of familiar Leigh faces (Peter Wight, Ruth Sheen, Alison Steadman, Gary McDonald, Liz Smith, etc) pop in to say hello and theres a telling visit by his photo shops former owner (Ron Cook) who has fallen on hard times which tells us the distance Maurice has travelled and the respect that is his due. At the party he gives an amazing speech which is the films emotional core without a doubt, Spall totally convincing as Maurice talks about secrets and lieswere all in painwhy cant we just share our pain? The scene cracks me up every time I see it. Blethyns Cynthia is a creation on the same level of excellence as we witness her despair gradually transforming into joy as the film plays out. Her on the phone tentatively trying to talk to Hortense and then the delicacy nuance of their meetings is beautifully balanced with hilarious moments (Im ravishing! she says diving into her pasta). Encapsulating the whole piece perhaps is the sequence where Maurice pops by Cynthias house unannounced. As they ponder their dads leaky old room which hasn't been changed since he died years before Cynthia breaks down. Her Give us a cuddle is followed by an embrace between siblings which focuses on Maurices face and the awkwardness he feels. The psychology between the two performances is profoundly touching here especially when we see Maurice wanting to tell Cynthia why he doesnt have kids, but having to hide his secret and effectively lie instead. In that scene we have the essence of the whole film  people who simply want to be loved but who are all tied up by secrets and lies.

This film is commonly seen as Leighs greatest achievement and after writing up both Mr. Turner and Another Year in similar 5-star glowing terms, now is perhaps the time for me to question how great Mike Leigh really is. Watching these films I have no question that he is totally successful in achieving what he sets out to do. But is a perfect replication of reality on screen on its own enough to make a great film? A few years ago Sight & Sound said that the best filmmakers in the world since the end of the 70s have been Martin Scorsese, Francis Coppola, Pedro Almod&oacute;var, Krzysztof Kielowski, Abbas Kiarostami and Michael Haneke. I would exclude Coppola from this group as only one film in the time period (Apocalypse Now) qualifies him for inclusion and everything he has made since has been inferior, but one thing that the other five names here possess in spades is a very strong cinematic personality with a visual sensitivity which constantly probes behind the images we are given. There is usually a strong sense of a life beyond the frame with their best work really getting at the essence of the human condition in a very tactile way which encourages us almost to reach out and touch the screen. Great as Leigh is, for all his wonderful qualities I don't think his films are on the same level of visual artistry. He started making films for TV and right up until Another Year the visuals are flat in the traditional manner of TV drama. Id say you can take all the films from the afore-mentioned directors out of the cinema and show them on TV and you notice a huge reduction in the total effect. Leighs films on the other hand suit the TV screen and seem to lose nothing in the reduction process. Is cinema really great if we don't have to go to the cinema to really appreciate it?

Further to the visuals there is a question of dialogue and the replication of everyday mundane situations. Theres no questioning the extraordinary research and the dedication of his cast to really become their characters, but again is the replication enough to really involve us? Ozu Yasujir is sometimes compared with Leigh in that he specialized in home dramas with characters talking about mundane matters and everyday concerns, but a comparison between the two doesnt flatter Leigh at all. Ozu takes us deeply behind his characters with a simplicity which is actually very deceptive. The way that he teases out the complex emotions behind the old couple as they are pushed from pillar to post by their selfish offspring in Tokyo Monogatari for example is cinema at its spiritually most profound. Leigh approaches human drama with extraordinary dedication as well but we see and sense only exactly what we see on screen before us. He is aided by extraordinary acting which convinces us that what we are watching is great, but I don't find myself delving behind what we see quite as compellingly as with the five directors I list above, let alone the greatest figures of the past of which Ozu is obviously one. Once we start to examine the full riches of what cinema has given us in the past Leighs achievements pale somewhat. For me a great director has to access the human condition in way that is different from what has been done before, Leighs films play as if the great modernist experiment of the French New Wave and the following New German Cinema never happened with an insistence on the retention of mimesis and a style which hasn't changed much since he worked for the BBC in the 70s/80s.

I don't want to be too harsh because Leigh is certainly one of the best directors working right now, and there are signs that he is pushing the envelope and trying to essay new things. His turn to the period film strikes me as a wonderful idea and Mr. Turner was a film I watched on DVD regretting I didn't catch it on the big screen. I want to see Topsy Turvy quite urgently and I eagerly await Peterloo which should be coming out next year. I think its criminal such a quality artist has to go so long between films because of financial issues. Hes only made 14 films in all in almost 50 years. Fassbinder reverses the ratio, making almost 50 films in 14 years! OK Fassbinder is an extreme example, but his career shows what is possible to achieve when state sponsorship is readily available. Leigh has had to suffer the inconvenience of making films in a country which doesnt value him as much as it should. Its amazing that he has achieved as much as he has even if we shouldnt get too carried away with our praise.",1511136000,,12275,4.761860028182245
