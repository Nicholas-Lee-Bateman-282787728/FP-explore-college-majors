8704659,4,B00U85TQ0M,"This extremely rare movie from 1978 is the only movie with legendary comedian and MC Wildman Steve in the lead role. Shot in Miami, Steve plays a wino who was chosen at random by 2 criminals to take a serum that makes him semi bionic to help them pull off a robbery. But unbeknownst to Steve, anyone that takes this serum dies 6 days later, which was perfect cuz there's no witnesses.

This movie is quite slow paced, but it does pick up a bit in the end. There seems to be much acting going on, making it seems like most of this was improvised, which is what makes this movie so silly.

Now, the American Genre Film Archive through Vinegar Syndrome used a 35mm theatrical print for this bare bones DVD only release, filled with skips, film dirt, and pops through out the entire movie! The skips in this print xaused this version to be, at least, 3 minutes shorter than the original length of the movie. But they scanned and restored it in 2k anyway, and you can clearly see the work they did, and how the film would actually look if it didn't have all these flaws. It's also been restored back to it's correct aspect ratio. Those who were lucky enough to have the VHS that Xenon released in the 80s have the ""complete"" and cleaner version of the film, but the original title of this film, ""The Six Thousand Dollar N****r"", named after Steve's comedy album from '77, was replaced with Super Soul Brother. This release has restored the original title in the film, and the closing credits are at the end. For thise completests, this should be in your collection.",1531008000,,1560,4.451048951048951
