It was the only time in Disneyland history to have 3 attractions have the same dedication day. It was a bonus to have the original disney designer with us on the special occasion a well .  It was nice to be able to give others a chance to re-purchase the event poster. The designer made this poster to have rough edge look and a wow factor.
