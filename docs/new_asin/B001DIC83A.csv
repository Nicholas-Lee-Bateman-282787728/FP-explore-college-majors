8293459,4,B001DIC83A,"Foremost, this video is a lot of fun. It is especially useful for those who are just beginning to take a serious interest in nearly all aspects of coffee.

I found, though, that each of the subject areas covered weren't done so in sufficient depth to satisfy the needs of one's interests beyond the basics. While it is true that much of what a coffee lover knows comes from much trial and error, I would have liked to see more in the way of insight and experience from the various experts that are featured. A good example would be that in the presentation on grinding, the presenter actually shows the results of his grinding in his hand, and discusses how he arrived at it.

There could have been more time spent on terminology too. In the presentation on cupping, some mention is made of how to describe the taste differences between coffees, but only with the suggestion that the viewer should experience as many different coffees as he can. I would suggest that if one has an opportunity to attend coffee tastings, this would be very helpful in building a coffee vocabulary. I, for example, sampled a coffee for the first time that put me in the mind of smoked ham, but I wouldn't think that many coffee lovers would get the connection.",1288310400,,1241,4.560538116591928

8293461,5,B001DIC83A,"Living in New York, I go to Orens Daily Roast everyday for my cup of coffee. So it was very interesting to see Oren doing a demo of the chemex. All the demonstrations were done by people who obviously love what they are doing and their enthusiasm transcends the screen. Great buy for anyone who loves coffee.",1222128000,,308,4.421052631578948

This video showed me quite a few subtle details I did not know about each of the brewing methods I use. The information is detailed, informative for both the seasoned coffee geek and the people who are just discovering that there is much better coffee than the big box coffee shops sell.
