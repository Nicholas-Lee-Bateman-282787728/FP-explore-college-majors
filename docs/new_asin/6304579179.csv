From 1997 some of the info is dated as things continue to grow and change BUT it does well capturing the excitemnt & glitz of Vegas.  It also brings in some of the local flavor that only locals know about as there is much more to Las Vegas than Casinos.  As a city Las Vegas is unlike any other in the world, even though gambling (gaming) has opened up in so many places, Las Vegas remains the quintesential vacation destination for those seeking Action. This show is a fun romp thru the city of lights- Las Vegas!",1219190400,,640,4.361344537815126
