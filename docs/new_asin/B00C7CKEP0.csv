I even went as far as to learn the Korean language which I use often. The shipping was quick I hardly had to wait, even though this is a DVDR the packaging and picture quality and sound where top quality. As for the film, it is a dark surreal fantasy film using both Korean and the Japanese language between the two main characters. I recommend this film for any Kim Ki Duk fans, or anyone willing to watch something different than the typical Hollywood over budget blow everything up or silly romantic comedy.",1375401600,13,685,4.196969696969697
