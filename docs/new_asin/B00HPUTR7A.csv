8634108,3,B00HPUTR7A,Cardio more than strength. So if you are looking for weights or other resistance equipment this is not that. Lots of jumping which I didn't mind. So if you can jump higher or squat lower then this can be an intermediate? Workout. Otherwise you can modify for lower impact.,1470614400,,272,4.571428571428571

8634110,4,B00HPUTR7A,"I love this workout routine it makes me feel great!
Its not the most challenging, but it still gets my heart rate up and makes me sweat.
Ive been doing Jillian Michaels ripped in 30 and I use Unleash on my rest days as a active recovery workout and it always puts a smile on my face when I complete the routine. Bipasha is nice to look at and its easy to follow.",1427846400,,362,3.9726027397260273

8634113,1,B00HPUTR7A,YUCK!  This is nothing but a marketing advertisement for Basu.  The workout does not make you sweat and is very short.  The rest of the dvd is hyping her career.,1407283200,,161,4.3
8634114,4,B00HPUTR7A,"Although I like eveyrthing Bipasha Basu has done with exercise videos, and the production quality is EXCELLENT, I have a couple of criticisms about this workout.

1.  I would think that for a workout billing itself as strength building, time to get strong, that there would be some resistance work.  Although a barbell on a rack was part of the set decor, no weights, and no resistance bands were ever used.

2.  The bodyweight exercises were not enough to be strength building in my opinion.  They were interspersed with a LOT of jumping (plyometrics).  Although the jumping can be modified out for those with joint issues, it is difficult.  The bodyweight exercises were only a few lunges and squats, nothing more demanding than that.  Strength building bodyweight exercises can offer so much more than the teasers in this video.

3.  There is no technique section to teach proper form even though both Bipasha Basu and the trainer emphasize that technique is very important.

4.  The trainer claims that this workout is good for people with osteopenia and osteoporosis to strengthen their bones.  If somebody with those ailments tried to do all this jumping they could shatter a bone and be out of commission for months.  Recommending jumping exercises for people who already have those conditions is bad advice.  I cannot imagine why a trainer would say that.  Jumping, if you are not overweight, can help increase bone density.  If you have the above mentioned conditions, and/or happen to be overweight, jumping is too hard on the joints.",1396656000,4,1544,4.941634241245136
