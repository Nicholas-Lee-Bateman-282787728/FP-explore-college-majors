However, when I played the trailer the voice was so fighting that no one wanted to watch it. In add it we had to sleep with nights. It was as if we were inviting satan into our minds. My granddaughter is still frighten to this day. Now she will not sleep alone.",1522454400,,322,4.111111111111111
8524873,5,B0083WZ692,"""Homecoming"" is the first movie written and produced by Christian Walk Alive, Inc. (CWA), an organization committed to creating Christian media. In every sense, CWA is a grassroots effort to provide insightful entertainment - and this movie speaks directly to that mission. To that end, it's to be expected that a freshman movie production will have some visual 'kinks' and areas of future improvement. The focus of this review, therefore, is the plot and scripting of the film.

Without revealing too much of the plot, ""Homecoming"" is the story of Jason, a young man who is forced to come to terms with his past. His inner conflict manifests in positive and also destructive ways. Jason comes to a tipping point where he must rely on God and the support of his friends and family to turn his life around. The dynamics of his relationships and the ultimate question of faith - especially in difficult situations - was well written. Dramatic elements are well tempered in terms of the plot flow and flashbacks. I really liked the storyline and scripting overall. It's honest with light comedic moments and thought-provoking conversations. CWA did an excellent job with presenting this story.

So, if you're looking for a flashy, Hollywood-style drama, this movie (and most indie films) are probably not for you. If, however, you're looking for a movie that takes a serious look at life after tragedy in an honest way, ""Homecoming"" is a solid bet.",1385078400,,1445,4.94238683127572
8524874,2,B0083WZ692,"This is an Indie ""Christian"" film.  It has a good Christian message.  Because of its low budget, some scenes are ""light.""  However, it is for a specific audience who will be much more ""forgiving"" than the norm.  I appear in the ""computer geek's meeting"" scene.",1351900800,,260,4.711111111111111

Homecoming effectively conveys the importance of letting go of past mistakes and, with the Lord's help, moving forward.  This movie definitely has a message for everyone.",1339113600,3,265,5.285714285714286
