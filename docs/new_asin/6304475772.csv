901587,5,6304475772,"I bought this to show my students while we were studying Africa.  It's just the right length to show in one class period.  Even though the narration (Dudley Moore) is a little goofy at times, my 6th grade students still loved it.",1276732800,,229,4.428571428571429
901588,5,6304475772,"I purchased this for my two nephews who are constantly on the go from the minute they wake up to the minute they go to bed.  They really like this dvd.  It is educational, entertaining and quite relaxing actually as it gives the mother a bit of a breather while the kids actually learn something valuable.  I highly advise getting the rest of this series.",1274486400,2,355,4.430769230769231
901589,5,6304475772,I was very happy to be able to get this video on CD. The one we purchased years ago was on vhs and we wore it out. I bought it for my son and we passed it on to my daughter years later. We all enjoy singing the songs and watching the animals in their natural habitat. It is very easy and informative for little ones to understand and learn some animal trivia. I recommend it for everyone but especially preschoolers,1271894400,2,415,4.135802469135802
901590,5,6304475772,"When my daughter was growing up, she had the entire series on VHS and it was like her security blanket, or a good friend to fall asleep with almost every night.  Attributes:  music, catchy..you definately start singing along.. and the video content was excellent, but THE BEST thing about really wild animals is dudley moores friendly and entertaining narration... must have.. must own...",1251504000,,388,5.142857142857143
901591,5,6304475772,"We originally got this DVD as part of a set for our 3 year old son.  He absolutely loved all four of the DVDs in the original set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/National-Geographic-s-Really-Wild-Animals-Gift-Set/dp/B0009K7R20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">National Geographic's Really Wild Animals Gift Set</a>, but this one particular DVD got cracked somehow after we'd had it about 6 months.  I thought, oh well, he has about 50 DVDs, he won't miss one.  About a month passed, and I was sure he'd forgotten it.  No so luck.  He suddenly started asking almost every day for his ""safari with Spin.""  We tried slipping in various other adventures with Spin, but he kept insisting he wanted the safari. So I bought it again, and peace has been restored in our household.

This particular DVD is one that our animal crazy son has loved for more than a year now.  It had enough cute music and beautiful animal shots to interest him when we was two, and now that he is closer to four he is still enjoying it.  There are a lot of interesting animal facts in it, which he is eagerly soaking up.  (This is probably his favorite in the series, although he also loves Deep Sea Dive.)  As mentioned, he requests it often, and it is educational enough that I don't mind letting him watch.",1226880000,11,1317,5.023041474654378
901592,5,6304475772,"I used to teach elementary school, and I used the Really Wild Animal videos in my classroom. My students loved them! I purchased this video for my grandson who is an animal lover. He thinks it is great. The movie gives great information for science and geography while presenting the material in a fun way. My grandson has already requested more movies.",1202428800,8,353,4.709677419354839
901593,5,6304475772,"My 3-yr old son loves this DVD for its catchy songs and lively footage.  He watched it every day for the first couple of weeks, and still requests it regularly a year later, so the whole family has got most of the songs memorized.  I like that the DVD shows some footage from the wet season in Africa, not just the dusty dry season that you usually see.  And they talk about predators and prey in a kid-friendly way, exciting but not scary.  We also like the ""Hanging with the Primates"" show that comes as a special feature, and the interactive quiz and animal sounds features.  It's a very polished, engaging DVD that our whole family enjoys.",1159401600,16,643,4.461538461538462
901594,3,6304475772,"My 2-year-old animal junkie son got bored about 20 minutes into this and started asking for ""Elmo's World."" Some of the footage is pretty old, and it doesn't have the same polish as the Baby Einstein dvds he's used to.",1151971200,3,218,4.475
901931,4,6304475772,"This isn't the kids' favorite video, but it is very informative, and they will watch it multiple times (as long as you throw it into the rotation with other videos).

It has some great cinematography.

The sounds can be a little irritating to us adults, but it isn't the most annoying video by a long shot.",1362614400,,306,4.446428571428571
901932,5,6304475772,"My 3 year old dinosaur fanatic has watched this about 100x and loves it the same again and again. The rap dino music makes him sing and dance! Yes, the animation is from the early 90's, but the videos where made in the mid 90's! I was not expecting Spielberg Titanic like graphics! If your child is a true dinosaur fan, then he/she will love this very cute and very animated and very factually correct documentary about dinosaurs....ROAR!!!!!!!",1340582400,3,444,4.705128205128205
901933,1,6304475772,"i wanted a good educational video to show my kindergartners. This looked like a good one, but the quality is horrible. It looks like something made in the early 80s. There goes 2 bucks.",1334707200,,185,4.470588235294118
901934,4,6304475772,"I show this every year to 4th grade English language learners and they dig it.  They think it's pretty funny and love the songs, so it's not just for little ones.  Sure, there's more sophisticated stuff out there, but my experience teaching K-6 is that the kids don't care about that as much as adults do...they just want to be entertained, and they are by this series.",1332806400,3,369,4.492537313432836
901935,3,6304475772,I would rate it a 3 1/2 as far as keeeping your attention. I watched it to prescreen for a toddlers. No killing of other animals which is good for little ones so they will see it later. I also wish a newer Safari video was available. But overall good for little ones to see.,1331251200,,274,4.0
901936,5,6304475772,"It's older, but still fun, which I think is the important part for younger children (2 - 6?).  Most nature shows I see today are oriented for an older audience or they're too ""fluffy"".  It's refreshing to see some quality from 20 years ago.",1318896000,,240,4.431818181818182
901937,5,6304475772,"HIGHLY recommend. My 2 year old loves this movie. I don't mind it either, has some catchy music, and I even learned a few new things : )  Looking forward to buying more : )",1315872000,,172,3.914285714285714
901938,2,6304475772,The animation is very old compared to what's available today. I was hoping the execution would be a little more savvy but I think there are better animal kingdom videos out there.,1314576000,,179,4.625
901939,2,6304475772,"My 4 year old just got this as a birthday gift.  And the narrator ""Spin"" is incredibly annoying.  My son doesn't like it at all, and neither do I for that matter.  I was hoping it would be only music with a few facts about the animals but the narrator talks the WHOLE time.  I have 3 DVD's the Swinging Safari, Totally Tropical Rainforest and Deep Sea Dive. I would not purchase these ever again.  Not sure what else is out there that is better for a 4 year old attention span, but this is not it.",1298851200,2,497,4.082474226804123
901940,5,6304475772,"This video is excellent for people young and old alike, who enjoy jokes, excerpts of classic movies, animals and excellent original music. High quality funny jokes by Dudley Moore make it a classic to be enjoyed, treasured and passed on to the next generation. I bought this for my two year old son in 1996 and now my four year old daughter in 2010.  A classic and a treasure. A must have!",1294099200,,389,4.402777777777778

7874757,5,6304475772,My Granddaughter and I  loves this series!  When my daughter was in Australia on an exchange program we learned all about the animals of Australia and others from around the world. I don't usually write reviews but this is an exceptional series. We both learned from it!,1463961600,,270,4.723404255319149

7874761,3,6304475772,"We have a couple in this series and they are OK.  They look dated at this point, but I guess the kids don't really notice or care.  They are a bit shorter than expected and don't really teach much.",1399766400,,197,4.0256410256410255

7874765,5,6304475772,"This is our favorite series of animal series, our family loves to watch all the animal shows.  However, I'm tired of watching series that just sound scary to the children.  Spin (Duddle Moore) shows the animals according to the continents, explains awesome facts about them, my husband and I end up seating to watch as well!  This has been a favorite, I owe the series on I-tunes and on amazon (amazon has more chapters).  If you have little kids, there is also ""Mama Mirabelle"" from National geographic - another loved one! Highly recommend REALLY WILD ANIMALS!  Best one by far!",1370649600,4,580,4.76
