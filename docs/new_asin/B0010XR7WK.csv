However, I don't think I would share it with anyone who is considering homeschooling.  There are alot of testimonies about God's faithfulness and suffiency through family trials, which encourages those already homeschooling to press on.  The moms look a little tired.  These interviews could scare some potential homeschoolers.  If I were to share a practical dvd with a new homeschooler, it would be Homeschool Start:  The Basics and Beyond, which explains how to do homeschool (and shows you how it is doable).  This would be good to share with a friend who already homeschools, and is going through a difficulty, or in need of encouragement to press on.  Add it to your collection, and be sure to watch it to the end to catch that inspiring prayer!",1325980800,,923,4.896774193548387
8239261,2,B0010XR7WK,"I am interested in homeschooling, and thought this film would give me a good insight into what its about. Its a good film if your into a sermon about why a few christian families home instruct their kids. However, it didn't give me a real clear idea of what families actually DO instruct. What materials they like or don't, how they organize it all. Frankly, I felt it was more a testimonial, but it did have some good points to it.",1233878400,4,432,4.345679012345679
8239262,5,B0010XR7WK,"As a home educator, author and homeschool consultant, I have seen numerous documentaries on home education.  Quite honestly, they are usually pretty lame.  They are both boring and poorly taped.  I am very impressed with this new documentary on home education and I would recommend it as a resource for anyone interested in homeschooling.",1202860800,2,338,5.222222222222222
8239263,5,B0010XR7WK,"As the founder of EyeLight Media, I have personally been looking forward to this day. For the past 21 years, I have been courting the vision of producing God honoring films and videos. This DVD marks our first tangible step at making that dream become a reality. I would be honored if you would consider purchasing this DVD for your home.

While there are a myriad of home education products out there, the majority of them target families that are already home educating. This film targets two groups of people:

* Families that have thought about homeschooling their children but have some reservations or concerns about it will find many of those concerns addressed on this DVD
* Families that have been homeschooling for a short time, have become discouraged and are considering putting their children back in school will be given fresh ideas that will motivate them to continue.

This DVD will become a useful tool in explaining, to friends and relatives, the reasons why you have decided to educate your children at home.

================================

""Consisting of a well-organized collage of interviews, Home Education: A Compelling Documentary allows viewers (especially those outside of the homeschool movement) to take in the family-oriented world of Christian home education. This professionally assembled DVD communicates the powerful message that Christian home education is perhaps the most powerful and effective way in which to bring the Lord into our children's lives as well as reintroducing him to our culture. Home Education: A Compelling Documentary has earned my strongest recommendation, and would be an important tool in any homeschool advocate's library."" - James Boyes, Host - Christian Education Awareness Network (CEANet)",1196899200,5,1756,5.3478260869565215
