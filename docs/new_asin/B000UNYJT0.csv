2923277,5,B000UNYJT0,"I try not to miss any episodes of this show.  I love the various challenges each week and enjoy watching how the designers interpret their tasks.  I own all three sets of the series and highly recommend them - they are even fun to watch more than once!  You can see how each season this show gets better and better.  Season 4 is the best by far - more accomplished designers, more feedback from Tim Gunn, and constructive judging.  The judges may make some negative comments but I feel that they do not insult the contestants.  I like  the twists included in the show such as Season 3 allowing 4 contestants to go to Fashion Week and in Season 4 - a runoff between Romi and Chris to become the final member of the team to go to Fashion Week.  The challenges are becoming more interesting too - not so much with recycled garbage as in some earlier seasons.  This show is one of the best on TV - I'm addicted.  I encourage you to try it too!  You will love the boxed sets - no commercials.  I would like to see some bonus material included in the sets such as background on the designers, out-takes, and more comments on each  design.  Buy these DVDs - you won't be disappointed.",1205971200,,1177,4.290909090909091
2923278,3,B000UNYJT0,"I'm glad I rented this third season before buying it.  It is not nearly as good as the first two seasons, mainly because the guy, Jeffery, who keeps winning is such a jerk.  He seems to get rewarded every time he slams someone else.  Even the foul-mouthed, conniving Wendy Pepper from the 1st season is not as offensive as this guy.  I have to say Santino's bluster in the 2nd season was still not as mean-spirited as this season was.  Although I own the first two seasons, I won't buy this one.  I've heard the 4th season is better though.  So I'm waiting to see it on dvd.  Even though my kids like the show very much, if the language isn't cleaned up, I won't buy it or let them watch it.  (You won't hear Heidi Klum, Michael Kors, Nina Garcia or Tim Gunn using trashy language.)",1205712000,5,782,4.26530612244898
2923279,3,B000UNYJT0,"The only negative I can say about the DVD/show is that I really dislike the language, it is poorly censored and there is just an over use of the F word.  Boo on those who in my mind ruined a good show.  Just my humble opinion.  Those who think that I am a prude might think it is my problem but I'm sorry you can clean up your language when you know a camera is on you, how you talk around your friends is your business but you are coming into my home.  To talk like that narrows the amount of people that can play this around their children (at least I hope so or maybe I am the only one in the universe who thinks this)",1205539200,10,621,3.8661417322834644
2923280,2,B000UNYJT0,"I really enjoyed Season 1 and season 2 of PR and even bought them (not having cable), but I found this season very bland and uninspiring.  I didn't find any of the designers particularly likable (and found one even creepy!)  By the time I had watched 4 episodes a friend called me and I could only think of the name of one of the designers so, to me, that shows how forgettable this season was.  I did like the work of one designer, but thought the winner was a bad choice.",1203465600,7,473,4.175824175824176

2923283,4,B000UNYJT0,"Have collected all 3 seasons up to now and i like to watch this show. It learnt me the fact that in the fashion industry, designers are more brain (ideas)- driven and models are more physics (look)-driven. In order to become SOMEBODY in this business, you will just have to pair together! It is more collective output in order to brand yourself at the end.

One of the comparisons i have been always thinking is Tyra Banks is all over America's Next Top Model, the whole program. It might not be the initial intention to set up her as the centre of the whole show (if so, then the show failed already), but the truth is she has that power/image to be the centre of the show, more than any models or judges over there.

If you look at Project Runway, Hedi Klum is also the Host and one of the Judges, but you feel the show is really about those designers and their designs. That might be the factor which put Project Runway a bit ahead of ANTM.",1200700800,,943,4.262569832402234
2923284,5,B000UNYJT0,"I have to admit that when I first saw this show a few months ago, I thought it was going to be another American Idol-like show...only with designers, not singers.  I am SO glad that I was wrong!  I must say that Project Runway is a standout show from other reality shows.  The drama is there, but it's not over-done.  Heidi Klum and Tim Gunn really make the show worth watching.  I am now addicted to it and own the first two seasons (I'm waiting for the third one to arrive).  I didn't think I was into fashion, but it is the designing that really got me addicted.  I never knew just how much work goes into each piece of clothing!!

Its so inspirational, deadlines, pressure and beautiful designs are what this season is full of. I enjoyed the differences between the finalists, its so creative and the winner's designs are amazing to me. I love the characters, Laura is so elegant I have never seen a mother of 5 take such good care of themselves and dress up all the time looking like she's going to a party not the mother of 5 boys. Uli is so cute, so happy, Jeffery is so rock and roll and extremely talented. I hope to one day meet these people. Buy this season you will not be disappointed.

2923327,5,B000UNYJT0,"I don't sew, but I adore this show!

Each season begins with approximately 12-16 up-and-coming fashion designers selected to compete for the opportunity to design a show for Fashion Week in Bryant Park of New York City.  Each episode introduces a new challenge for the designers in which they have minimal time to sketch and purchase materials for the challenge, always accomplished under significant time restraints.  The challenges themselves are often very interesting, such as the challenge to create clothing from non-traditional materials (e.g. items from a pet store, flowers, or items reconstructed from their own pajamas).

In addition to the challenges, the designers themselves bring a lot of color and character to the show.  The mentor, Tim Gunn, is terrific at encouraging the designers to to do their best with his trademark ""Make It Work, Designers!""  And if that isn't enough, the judges (Michael Kors and Nina Garcia) offer thoughful critiques.  And then there is the third judge and show host, Heidi Klum, who offers valuable input and something pretty to look at.

But at the core of it all is the fashion.  It is really interesting to watch the clothes come to life in each challenge, culminating in a runway show.

If you like fashion, you'll love Project Runway!",1341705600,,1285,5.04739336492891
2923328,5,B000UNYJT0,"I love watching Project Runway - and this third season is fun to watch.  I have watched Project Runway since the second season and pick up the DVD's when I can.  I keep watching them over and over and over - I love Project Runway.

2923329,3,B000UNYJT0,Boring!,1302220800,,7,7.0
2923330,5,B000UNYJT0,"What I most enjoyed about Season 3 was the project to make a matching dog outfit to go with a ladies garment. I'm not a dog owner, but was very curious to see the outfits the contestants would sew up for these little dogs. Some of the outfits were cute, the dogs were all small-sized. Aside from that project, there were a number of other interesting projects, one of the most interesting was making outfits inspired by fashion icons (Cher, Katherine Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, etc.) There were some really beautiful outfits and some dreadful ones too. Also, for one of the competitions all of the contestants were flown to Paris, and it was interesting to see the scenes filmed there.

One thing that I did not like about this season was the conflict between some of the contestants. I know that since this is a ""reality show"" that conflict and arguing is part of the formula, but I watch the show just to see the sewing and finished outfits, and I fast-forwarded through the arguements. Some people enjoy watching that kind of thing, but I could do without the conflicts, and I thought a lot of the personal conflicts should have been edited out so that we could see more of the sewing techniques the contestants were using. In this season, one of the contestants was disqualified when he was found violating rules, and a finalist was unjustly accused of violating rules but his name was cleared and he stayed in the competition. Those two parts were very relevant to the competition, but the personal conflicts and arguements were extraneous.

Overall, I gave the show five stars because the filming was lovely and very entertaining, the show was very polished, the designers/contestants talking about their sewing was interesting, the runway shows were fun, there were some nice clothes (and some terrible ones too!). Tim Gunn is the mentor to the contestants, and he's got an utterly charming manner---very distinguished-looking and offers good opinions about works in progress.

Finally, I thought that Season 4 was outstanding----and Season 3 was very good. With Season 4, in every episode I understood why a garment was judged and labelled as ""out"", and I could see why the ultimate prize-winner was selected over the other designers, and I saw more sewing details (which is my primary interest in the show). With Season 3, there were times that I couldn't see why a garment was selected as superior to the others, and I didn't understand the judges reasoning as to the ultimate prize winner. There were some beautiful clothes in this series, and I was gratified to see that one of the garments I liked the best won a competition near the end of the series. This show is so entertaining. If you like the ""reality show"" approach to fashion, you'll like Season 3. If you're more interested in sewing techniques, see Season 4. (I also wrote a review of Season 4).",1294963200,3,2866,4.774193548387097
2923331,5,B000UNYJT0,"With only a few days until my mother-in-law's birthday, we finally thought of the perfect gift: another season of Project Runway!  But no where in town had the seasons we wanted (and I didn't want to pay full-price, anyway), so we turned to Amazon.  The only downside was that we knew there was no way it would arrive in time (in 4 days, I think).  But, wait:  It did!  Great price, great season of Project Runway and delivered to our home in amazing time!",1278633600,,456,4.380952380952381
2923332,5,B000UNYJT0,"Project Runway is an incredible show that attempts to find the next big fashion designer. Contestants have a design challenge each week, ranging from making clothing out of cast-off mail packaging to designing outfit for each others mothers to creating a look for a beauty queen. The worst designer is kicked off each week until there are three finalists who create collections to show in New York's Fashion Week.

This season has a talented cast, each with their own very distinct styles and entertaining personalities. For example, there is Jeffrey, the tattooed, rock-and-roll oriented designer who has a rough past. Michael Knight has an affinity for designing for the female body. Laura is a classy, sophisticated mother of six. Kayne is a pageant designer who loves sparkle. Vincent is a designer who flourished in the 80s and is making a comeback to the field he loves.

The personalities make the show, but the challenges are entertaining, the work the designers do is beautiful, and the judges always have something sharp to say. For anyone who loves the fashion world, and even for those who don't, this is a highly entertaining show, and a reality show in the true sense. There are no scripts and the prizes have a real impact on the winner's life.",1273449600,2,1259,4.878504672897196
2923333,3,B000UNYJT0,"The Contestants: Although the technical skills of the contestants seemed generally higher than the previous two seasons, I found that as designers, they seemed less inspired.
A lot of disgreeable or bland contestants.

The First Challenge: The first challenge, to make an outfit out of found material in the hotel room was wasteful, ugly, and disgusting.

The Production: I didn't like the revised series format...a significant amount of air time is spent recapping previous episodes as well as introducing the next episode.  Clearly Heidi Klum and Tim Gunn are developing their roles..to the point they are self aware of themselves as caricatures.

The DVD: This DVD set for the first time has some bonuses including some outtakes and short docs of how some of the winners are doing.",1267920000,,784,5.1015625
2923334,5,B000UNYJT0,"We can't get enough of watching this show, no matter how many seasons we have rented and watched all at once. It is mind-boggling how anybody, semi-professional or otherwise, can design and produce these outfits within the time and monetary limits they are given. These people are phenomenally talented, every one of them! Some of the choices and comments by the judges seem forced -- they almost always completely agree with each other, and that seems suspicious. But the credits do tell us that the ""producers and Bravo TV have input"" into the decision-making process, so that explains a lot.

  Suggestion: Wish they could just rate each piece from each contestant every week -- assign a point-score to each one, and then choose the winner at the end of the whole season by the number of points he or she has.

  Criticism: Heidi doesn't have to be so dramatically cruel at the end. You wouldn't be surprised if the loser ran back into the workroom and hung him/herself from the tallest dressmaker stand.",1267056000,,1007,4.791907514450867

Uli's smooth flowing prints
Laura's sophisticated and finely made dresses
Stacey's cool professional composure
Malan's laugh
The dog, rip your apartment, make gown for Miss USA to wear for Miss
Universe.  These challenges are so fun to watch
Kayne's sense of humor and he talks like a powerful machine gun
Robert's funny punch lines like, ""I believe in recycling even with
 boyfriends.""
Robert and Kayne's screeching
Contestants constantly fighting verbally with each other as early as the second episode.  Some were even back-stabbing one another even during the initial presentation.
No over-acting crying dramas just to attract attention and sympathy like Andre from PR2 and that very annoying and horrible designer Ricky of PR4.
Amanda, the model who wouldn't shut her big mouth
Marilinda and Amanda - the fainting mannequins
And last but not the least . . . BRADLEY BAUMKIRCHNER!  His dance moves, his humor, his punchlines, ""I'm a squid with no ocean. I'm a fish out of water. When is the pants gonna be done? (4X repeatedly), Laugh now Bradley!  You'll be thrown into the pit! I am so happy I almost cried! I made a toy and they kicked me out . . .POP!""  Plus the sounds he makes (chicken, being electrocuted) and his different expressions (strangling himself) . . . a stand-up comedian with a great heart!  Plus he's a talented but humble designer who wore a fantastic dress, getting a high score in just one hour!!!  Go, Bradley, go!  Audition for the next seasons!  You have a lot of support from your fans!

Thanks to this season's designers, I actually enjoyed this season more than season 2. Some of the creative challenges include: creating an outfit made out of items found in the designer's living space; designing a gown for Miss USA in the Miss Universe Pageant; making matching outfits for a dog and its owner and creating a background story for the owner (actual dogs modeled the outfits on the runway!);  and one of my faves, using materials from a recycling plant in Jersey!

Yes, there is some drama on this season (two designers accused of ""foul play"", one designer being rude to another's mother), but as before, the drama does not overtake the creativity that is this show's hallmark. Another wonderful thing about this show is how there is also a nice age range of the contestants (one of my faves is a 40-something mom of 5 children with another on the way during the show!).

Extras on the DVD include:
1. ""WEAR Are They Now?"" featurette: curiously, this time they eliminated one of the Project Runway Season 3 winners, with no explanation of why there is no update for the missing designer (I will not reveal the names so as not to spoil the series for anyone).
2. ""WEAR Was He Then?: Tim Gunn, Making It Work"" featurette: a nice mini documentary on Gunn (can you believe this very formal guy was inspired by pop-up books as a kid?!?). Gunn definitely seems more human after watching this.
3. Tim Gunn's Season 3 Blog: contains Gunn's commentary on the individual designers/episodes
4. Designer Bios
5. Outtakes presented by L'Oreal Paris",1219363200,8,2060,5.703583061889251
2923342,5,B000UNYJT0,"In my opinion, this is the best season of Project Runway so far.  This season has the most drama, from the problems Kieth had early on, to Jeffrey in the Mom challenge, to the trip to Paris.  All of the characters are very fun and there is a nice range of styles and fashion.  The challenges were really good this season as well - the dog challenge, the mom challenge, the couture challeng - there was such a great assortment of cool looks we saw during this season.  Season 5 starts soon, but out of the first 4 this one is by far the best in my opinion.",1215993600,3,555,4.111111111111111
2923343,3,B000UNYJT0,"The third season is the weakest among the first 3 seasons.  The challenges are all very interesting and demanding as before.  Heidi, Tim and all the judges are great.  But, a great but, the contestants are far from satisfactory.  One could not see as many great pieces as created by the contestants of the previous seasons, especially the first season.  One does not have particular liking for the contestants of the third season.",1212192000,3,430,4.835616438356165
2923344,5,B000UNYJT0,"The creativity and drama once again prove to be awesome.  Jeffrey is such a jerk, Angela is so two faced and Laura Bennett is the ultimate chic NYC woman. Michael is the baby faced sweet heart and Uli the Uber beachwear queen.",1209254400,,226,4.380952380952381
2923345,5,B000UNYJT0,"Okay, I love Project Runway.  Who doesn't??  Even Oprah is a fan (did you hear she sat in on the audition judging panel for Season 5?)

Although Season 3 was not my absolute favorite (Come on, create fashion from recycling materials? Ew[...] the silk?) I had to have it- if only to re-watch the episodes with the Moms.  Funny how meeting the moms of Michael Kors and Jeffrey Sabella really gives you a different perspective on the guys.  To balance the trip to the Waste Management Plant, we did get to go along on the trip to Paris... Tres magnifique. And don't forget the Dogs, and creating a pageant gown for Miss USA... (was there anyone who thought Kayne WOULDN'T win?  I doubt it...)

Like the first two, Season 3 has sew much to love (sorry).",1207872000,,749,4.463235294117647
8214056,4,B000UNYJT0,"Great show, I love project runway. The first disk WOULD NOT play the third episode, and sometimes the episodes won't play in order, that can be anoying, but other than that, it's great.",1522368000,,185,4.636363636363637
8214057,1,B000UNYJT0,"I purchased an extended episode version and wished I hadn't.  One of the designers was so hate-filled and caustic that just watching season three caused me to walk away feeling bad.  I usually feel inspired.  It was good that the version that aired on television was edited down.  Jeffery's hate issues were a liability to this season.  While I have seen the televised version, I cannot finish watching the DVD version.",1522281600,,419,4.845070422535211
