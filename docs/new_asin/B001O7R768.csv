3729183,5,B001O7R768,"These 8 episodes of ""Every Picture Tells a Story"" peer deeply into masterpiece art works in a fresh way. Superior to anything I (and my wife) have seen. My M.S. & B.S. art degrees and over 2 decades of art teaching helps me grant this new Athena DVD set 5 colorful stars. This DVD set also rates ""2 paint brushes UP-WAY UP.""

THE PRESENTER, Waldemar Januszczak, U.K., is an art critic who never learned to be sophisticatedly boring, dull, & lifeless.  He will even make you laugh by finding a lighter side to masterpieces of art. He provides his opinion alongside the findings of other authorities, so you can decide for yourself. He does this in a manner somewhat similar to a European travelogue. Enjoyable. Scenic.

Individual episodes are less than 25 minutes, a perfect length for classroom use at universities and High Schools. 1 or 2 episodes touch on language and/or sexual topics that might want to be previewed and opted upon by ""conservative"" schools.  Probably just a PG rating if it were to be rated, however.

INTERDISCIPLINARY TEACHING: Each painting episode touches not only on the art itself, but on history, geography, and literature related to the piece. This is true educational integration, highly sought by state-of-the-art school curriculum.

WHAT DOES IT INCLUDE?
""Mr and Mrs Andrews"", Gainsborough, England. A mystery of the unfinished masterpiece.
""The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp"", Rembrandt, Dutch. The artist's haunting of death. Painting is compared to TVs ""E.R.""
""The Tempest"", Giorgione, Venice.  Giorgione means 'Big George'. This is a mysterious painter of even more mysterious art. Is Homer's ""Odyssey"" a clue?
""The Birth of Venus"", Botticelli, Florence.  Venus' voluptuous vulnerability vexing the virile. Not birth, so where does this painting's meaning spring from?
""Boy Bitten by a Lizard"", Caravaggio, Rome.  Finding the why from a lizard bite which was painted by a Roman artist and murderer.
""Mona Lisa"", Leonardo da Vinci, Paris. Don't bother with ""The Di Vinci Code"" book.  Episode is about solving the real Leonardo mystery.
""Le dejeuner sur l'herbe"", Manet, France.  The naughty, naked, picnic lady leaves behind illegal, immoral, impressionism--immortally.
""The Arnlfini Marriage"", Jan van Eyck, Bruges, Belgium.  A 15th century mystery in oil on an oak panel.

WHAT IS BONUS/extra?
For each episode: ""The Rest of the Story""
For each episode: ""Artist Biographies""
For each episode: SDH subtitles
A viewer's guide booklet with:
  Featured painting reproduction
  Questions to consider (individually or in a classroom)

3729186,4,B001O7R768,"Worth the price - Just for the analysis of "" The Arnolfini Wedding,"" by Van Eyck.  Love is one of the most elusive concepts...and its depiction is actually quite rare in art...The narrator explains why this picture is one of the great love stories of all time.  Romance, seduction, eroticism, the kiss, beauty, virility, touch, excitement, desire...those we have seen again and again from ancient times to today.  But this oil painting tells a different story...and the clear explanation by this educated critic is convincing ...to me.  [I won't spoil the experience by revealing the secrets]

Other DVD's created by Waldemar Januszczak that are particularly worthwhile are his analysis of The Dark Ages, Picasso, and my favorite...on Gauguin.",1406937600,4,743,5.262711864406779
3729187,2,B001O7R768,"The art here is fantastic but this series is hard to watch and listen to.  The narrator has an abrasive, almost condescending tone, and he does little more than spin gossip and speculate on the meaning of famous paintings.  The resolution on the images is not bad but the camera work is very bad. For example, the motion, as the camera rocks, while Januszczak  walks down an alley in Rome for the Caravaggio episode, is nothing short of nauseating.  In other places the shots of the paintings are not steady or the images are shot from the next gallery (literally) or the lighting is poor.  So, while the catalog of images shown is very good, the presentation gets in the way of the art.",1401667200,,687,4.508064516129032

3729189,1,B001O7R768,"...of time and money.  I only made it through 2 episodes.

I'm no artist, but I enjoy learning about subjects about which I know nothing.  This series is enough to put me off art commentary for the rest of my life.

The ""host"" is annoying, melodramatic, and condescending.  Many of the conclusions he draws seem to come from minimal evidence or support.

There must be something better out there.",1390003200,6,396,4.666666666666667

3729192,3,B001O7R768,"This series was a disappointment, so I'm writing a review to provide some balance in contrast with glowing reviews from other viewers. Waldemar Januszczak is not an eloquent speaker; he has a coarse manner of over-emphasizing every second word he says, and this is very grating after a few minutes. Furthermore, I found his manner of providing explanations and theorizing quite arrogant (he often says things like, ""art historians have been pondering this for centuries, but I KNOW what it means""). That said, I did learn interesting tidbits of information about the origins of the works in question and the artists' lives, so the series is not entirely without merit.

Production values are rather low -- there is jittery camera-work throughout. During one scene in particular, featuring Titian's Concert Champtre, the camera actually bobs up and down!

In lieu of this series, I would heartily recommend Civilisation (Kenneth Clark), The Shock of the New (Robert Hughes), Power of Art (Simon Schama), and The Private Life of a Masterpiece. All of these documentary series on art history are brilliant and blow Every Picture Tells a Story out of the water.",1386979200,16,1157,5.116402116402116

3729197,5,B001O7R768,"Fantastic and engrossing. Presented by the witty Waldemar Januszczak, these eight art history lessons are a joy to watch. Januszczak not only gives insightful interpretations of the often forgotten iconography found in these masterpieces but sets them in the artistic, social and political milieu of their day.

Thus we discover exactly why the couple in Thomas Gainsborough's Mr. and Mrs. Andrews are seated to the far right overlooking their land, and why that tail feather is poking out of the unfinished space in Mrs Andrews lap; that public dissection was the entertainment of the day in Rembrandt's Holland, and that the Mona Lisa was considered just another painting until it was stolen from Louvre and garnered massive publicity.

I was particularly entranced by the episode on Caravaggio's Boy Bitten by a Lizard, and the wonderful analysis of Manet's Luncheon on the Grass, so subversive in its day( in addition to the discussion about Manet model, Victorine Meurent), as well as the reconstruction of what was being represented in Giorgione's The Tempest and who the seated woman could possibly be.

Highly recommended.",1379030400,,1130,5.232044198895028

3729206,5,B001O7R768,"Waldemar Januszczak goes far beyond the typical art critic's analysis of paintings and brings both them and the artists to life in a way that you will remember. I have seen many art history DVDs and they are too often dry and dull. Too often, the art historian or critic will point out the obvious features of a painting (pyramidal composition, light/shadow, formation of geometric shapes within, etc,) with minimal references to meanings and ignore the real story of the painting. This series shows the depth of understaning that Januszczak brings to the field and is able to impart to the viewer. I didn't find his presentation at all egotistical, but if so, he deserves to feel that way because he backs it up.",1346198400,4,713,4.758064516129032

3729208,5,B001O7R768,"""Every Picture Tells a Story"" is very good, extremely interesting.  However,some of the material was a little on the racy side.  For example, the episode on Caravaggio goes into the history of flipping people off with your middle finger-something you may not want public school students (whom I teach and was showing this to)going home telling mama, ""guess what I learned today...!""  Just preview the episodes first, then decide for yourself.  I teach high school art, so these were helpful, just maybe not appropriate for younger students.  I was showing these to ninth graders, whose maturity level was not up for this.  I would show them to my older, more advanced students.",1301788800,2,677,5.0
3729209,5,B001O7R768,"This collection of famous paintings is a series of fascinating lessons by Waldemar Januszczak who has a marvelous sense of humor.  Without being pompous, he discusses each painting as well as the painter's life, and shows us things we may never have otherwise seen on our own.  I love art dvds and have purchased many, just for pleasure, and this is one of my favorites.  I wish there were more in the series as 8 is only a glimpse into the whole art world.  The dvd quality is very clear, audio and video.  Highly recommended if you enjoy art in small doses.",1283731200,17,559,4.4411764705882355
3729210,1,B001O7R768,"This so called critic has produced something very short of a work of art.
The moment you hear the background music you can tell there is something very very wrong with this DVD.  The cacophony of ear assailing vibrations are a perfect background for the lame and very drawn out explanation of silliness surrounding the critics thoughts on what the basis of the creative essence of the few pieces he has chosen.

This idiot is not Sister Wendy......not by a long shot.

3729211,5,B001O7R768,"Steve Kossack's  ""Every Picture Tells A Story"" is an excellent photography workshop DVD that will help your photography move to the next level. Steve is very enthusiastic about his subject and his approach is to help you analyze your surroundings in regard to light and composition--to tell a story! He suggests making many shots, with and without image enhancers and to vary the shots which will increases the possibility you will get the shot you want.

He is full of many, many tid-bits that will enable you to critique your own approach.  An important concept he emphasizes is the idea that when you plan and go on a shoot, the conditions you wind up with may not be what wanted..., so you must adjust to the conditions you are presented with. He is filled with many ideas and shares them with the viewer. He analyzes every shot he makes and takes you through his thought process in arriving at the point to make the shot. Changing the angle, including debris and other vegetation helps you to tell the story.

I own works by Zuckerman, Sweet, Reichmann, Cooper, Smith, Barker and many others. Each photographer approaches the subject different but is filled with knowledge as a result of their many years of experience to share with the viewer. I enjoyed Kossack's workshop DVD and have watched it many times. You will come away with many new ideas to include in your next photo shoot. Well worth the money!!!",1272067200,3,1414,4.712550607287449
3729212,1,B001O7R768,"I just finished watching this video and was not going to be able to sleep tonight unless I wrote this review, hopefully to save someone else from what I just went through.  I spent the entire time waiting for something to happen, waiting for useful information, waiting for Mr. Kossack to make a valid well thought out and informative statement.  It never happened.

Okay, the guy's I little strange, we all agree on that.  I can get past that, it's just that this video shared absolutely no real solid information.  While watching I couldn't help but think that his statements were thought up totally on the fly, which in itself is not a completely bad thing, but it caused him to repeat himself over and over and over again.

Additionally, I love the Southwest and bought the video partially in hopes of getting some tips on some of shooting locations there.  Never happened. He mentioned where he was, you see him shoot there, but zero mention of the area itself, its surroundings, best time of year, etc.

Let me save you the $$ and give you the whole video in a nutshell.  First use no filter.  Now use a split ND grad.  Now use a polarizer.  Bracket.  Move your camera to the next location.  Use no filter.  Use a split ND grad.  Use a polarizer. Bracket.  Move your camera to the next location.  Repeat this process for 2+ hrs.
