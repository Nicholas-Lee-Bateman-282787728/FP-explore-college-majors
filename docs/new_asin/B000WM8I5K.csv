8223687,5,B000WM8I5K,"Much like the first season, the second season of XPW was more shock and awe for me. XPW was a return to the raw and gritty nature that ECW used to be before TNN/Spike wanted it to be more upscale and glorified like WWE/WCW. XPW fans proved to be just as rabid as ECW fans. The matches were more of the same: crazy, violent, and unpredictable.",1242950400,2,342,4.196969696969697
8223688,1,B000WM8I5K,"This is the second season of the worst dvd series that XPW has put out.the matches advertised so much for being on these dvd,s are all partial matches but the way they are advertised decieves the public into thinking they are whole matches,very poor on xpws part for doing this and shame on Amazon for selling this garbage.",1221523200,,323,4.586206896551724
8223689,1,B000WM8I5K,"I'm going to review this one in a nutshell as was done with Season 1...the only plusses here are Sabu vs Terry Funk and the few complete matches that are found under the episodes/bonus features. However, the majority of the set is made up of over 10 hrs of poor quality, bad scripting, bad acting,and more garbage(attempted drama) than actual wrestling. Considerably worse than Season 1...and not the end, unfortunately.

If you're a fan of action/hardcore...stick to TNA, ROH, or even old school ECW. Here...you'll find more Rivera and Kris Kloss than anything else. Thumbs Down.",1219708800,2,580,5.041666666666667
8223690,1,B000WM8I5K,"Once again edited down and censored language just as season 1.

This review reflects the product (DVDs) in question. It does not reflect on the promotion itself. First off the compression or Bit Rate is to extreme. In other words the video quality is not the best. My VHS recordings made via A1-TV via C-Band Analog Satellite Feed are far superior in Audio / Video quality. The music is different than the original airings. The language is totally edited. Nudity and kissing between Lizzy & Kristi is blocked out. The adverts for Kristi Mist & Jasmine St. Clair have been deleted. The episodes have been edited down to approx. 38 minutes, not the 42 minutes (minus commercials) they ran when first aired. The keepcase stores all three DVDs in one stacking ring and the DVDs are very difficult to remove. To say the least this 3 disc set is a total farce which I should have expected from Big Vision. If you didn`t watch or record these shows when they first aired then you will probably enjoy this set but what a let down to loyal fans and the promotion itself. Although I don`t approve of Rob Black`s adult films (which landed him in jail) I really feel for the wrestlers and how their matches and interviews have been butchered. They probably receive no residuals from this set either. Contractural agreements guys, not just a paycheck. This advice from a past AWA employee. Enjoy, if you can?",1202169600,4,1395,4.647773279352227
