8307244,5,B001GVJYH2,"This look at the intriguing life of the Mad Monk, Rasputin, is informed by information from the long-missing Rasputin Files which emerged in 1995.  In 1917, the Russian provisional government had launched the ''Extraordinary Commission of Inquiry for the Investigation of Illegal Acts by Ministers and Other Responsible Persons of the Czarist Regime,"" the 13th volume of which was never published and was presumed lost until a summary of it appeared in 1964.  That 13th volume, now known as the Rasputin File, turned up at auction in 1995; it contained the transcripts of interviews and interrogations conducted into the influence of ""dark forces"" behind the czar - and, as such, gives us added insight into Rasputin's life, death, and influence over Nicholas II and his family.

The documents in the Rasputin File help answer several questions, one being the manner in which Rasputin was initially introduced to Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra; it also sheds new light on his controversial death.  The story has always been that Rasputin was poisoned, then shot, then beaten and kicked and thrown into a river (where he drowned), but at least one researcher interviewed here suggests that the real story is somewhat less dramatic.  The information in the Rasputin Files also does much to put to rest any suspicions of an affair between Rasputin and the Czarina.  Clearly, it was Rasputin's uncanny ability to heal the czar's only son, the sole heir to the throne, which tied him so closely to Alexandra.  Young Alexis suffered from hemophilia, and Rasputin was able to save his life on several occasions over the space of ten years - even from afar, after having been temporarily banished by the czar in wake of his embarrassing behavior.  As this documentary makes clear, no one really knows how Rasputin was able to do this.  It goes a long way toward explaining how Rasputin achieved and maintained such a strong influence over the czar and his family, even as the public increasingly looked upon the man as a primary source of all their troubles.

The True Story of Rasputin is an excellent look at Rasputin's life from his boyhood in Siberia to his infamous murder in St. Petersburg, bursting several myths along the way.  It also affords the viewer useful new insight into the vulnerable state of mind of Alexandra and the way in which this might have been exploited by Rasputin.  What I found most interesting, however (apart from descriptions of Rasputin's shockingly lewd public behavior) was the speculation that the historical account of Rasputin's death may contain some degree of prevarication.  There's no doubt that the man was difficult to kill (in 1914, he had been viciously stabbed - to the point that his intestines were exposed - by a woman thinking he was the Anti-Christ), but there is at least a hint of evidence that could rule out the use of poison in the assassination attempt.

Overall, this is a very informative documentary, especially insomuch as it touches upon Rasputin's life from his earliest days to his ignominious end.  It's always difficult to separate fact from fiction when examining the life of Russia's Mad Monk, but this documentary does a particularly good job of doing just that.  Making use of the new information found in the rediscovered Rasputin Secret Police file, The True Story of Rasputin goes a long way to earning its title.",1242086400,3,3384,4.941798941798941
8307245,5,B001GVJYH2,"The Philadelphia Experiment is one of those stories you really want to believe in because it is truly one heck of a good story.  You've got an incredible technological breakthrough (of invisibility and teleportation) based on one of Einstein's theories, terrible consequences which led to a complete government cover-up of the whole project, a mystery man whose strange missive to the Office of Naval Research piqued the interest of many, the strange ""suicide"" of a scientist claiming to have made a breakthrough on his research into the project, and other related events that seem to tie into a conspiracy.  Unfortunately, the legend of the Philadelphia Experiment has been pretty effectively debunked.  Even still, it's too good a story to simply fade away - and this History's Mysteries presentation does an impressive job of telling both sides of the story.

For those unfamiliar with the project, it centers around a supposed 1943 U.S. Navy experiment in ""electronic camouflage.""  German U-boats were playing havoc with American naval vessels at the time, and this gives the story a certain plausibility.  Using Einstein's theories, an electromagnetic force field was generated around a navy destroyer (later identified as the USS Eldridge) - and the experiment worked beyond anyone's imagination.  The ship literally became invisible; it also, most unexpectedly, was teleported from its Philadelphia dock to Norfolk for several minutes before returning.  To the Navy's horror, the men on board the ship suffered horrible consequences.  Many were driven mad, others seemed normal but periodically faded in and out of view, and some were embedded inside steel structures on the ship.  As a result of these tragic after-effects, the project was soon closed.  Then, years later, a seaman named Carlos Allende sent an annotated copy of Morris K. Jessup's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Case-For-the-UFO-Unidentified-Flying-Objects/dp/B000VB5TIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Case For the UFO - Unidentified Flying Objects</a>&nbsp;to the Office of Naval Research; therein, he claimed to have witnessed the disappearance of the Eldridge.  After learning of this from the navy, Jessup began his own investigation.  One day after telling a friend he had news of a breakthrough to share with him the next day, Jessup turned up dead - an apparent suicide.

After making the case for the plausibility of the Philadelphia Experiment, this documentary turns to the evidence that disproves the story fairly convincingly.  Central in this is Robert Goerman's discovery of Allende's true identity in 1979 (which is a story in and of itself) and Eldridge crew members' assertions that their ship had never been in Norfolk.  It's a very even-handed presentation that actually pays respect to those on both sides of the argument - a rarity in documentaries addressing the paranormal.  I would have liked to hear more from Al Bielek, who was interviewed early on in the segment, but that's primarily because I find the man so fascinating.  The ""history"" of the Philadelphia Experiment and the related Montauk experiments some years later can hardly be separated from the man and his extraordinary claims.  All in all, though, this is an excellent and fairly definitive look at one of conspiracy theorists' most provocative legends.",1240704000,24,3363,5.52046783625731
