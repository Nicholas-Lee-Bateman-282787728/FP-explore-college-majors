7898142,3,6305944466,"This DVD is pretty good. It has nice scenery(ocean,beaches)and also has the models talking which is nice to hear for a change. The Penthouse models in this DVD are Juliet Cariaga which is an all natural brunette(perfect body,best looking natural breasts i've seen and these blue eyes that i can't get enough of,and awesome face,Samantha Stewart an natural blonde(great legs,nice smile)and great to look at,and Alexa Lauren which is nothing worth mentioning, she has that playboy look,fake chest and lacking attractiveness.",1051401600,2,522,5.45679012345679
7898143,4,6305944466,"Features Penthouse Pets Samantha Stewart, Jacqueline Marie Phillips, Alexa Lauren and Pet of the Year, Juliet Cariaga.  After reading the initial review of this disc, I bought it...  Expecting it to be a waste of time I was pleasantly surprised.  Although maybe not quite as revealing as some playoff videos, this disc will not leave you yelling at the screen, ""Move your Hand!"", like most Playboy videos do.  The plot is pretty basic, 4 girls sit around a campfire trading tales of the days adventures.  The first scene is of Juliet and Samantha trying on swimsuits..., very erotic.  The next scene features Alexa Lauren (which I'd trade for Alexus Winston if I were producing this disc).  Alexa's fake blond hair and false breasts add nothing to the show, and is part of a alarming trend by Penthouse to hire artifically augmented pornstars instead of natural college coeds.  Jacqueline, Juliet and Samantha all have nice solo scenes.  With Samantha's being the most revealing. The picture is crisp and clear, and the photography/scenery is first rate.  If they'd have packed a macro lens and got rid of Alexa it would of gotten 4 stars easily.",979689600,12,1146,4.891191709844559
