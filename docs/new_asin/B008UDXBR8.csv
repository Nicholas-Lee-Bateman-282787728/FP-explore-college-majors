5183169,5,B008UDXBR8,"These are well made series that don't go over the top with blood ,guts and violence but have enough action to keep the story moving until the end.",1400457600,3,146,4.25
5183170,5,B008UDXBR8,"Each episode of the Martin Beck series is better than the previous one and that is not in any way demeaning the earlier episodes.  They are just that good!  You simply cannot get enough of them.  Watching Martin and Lena is a story in itself, and Gunvald outdoes himself in each episode.  Love them all -- even Wers&eacute;n.",1398297600,2,325,4.551724137931035
5183171,5,B008UDXBR8,This is a police story as good or better than classic American detective television.  Good studies of the main characters.,1376697600,4,122,5.1

5183173,5,B008UDXBR8,"Like others in this series this dvd in consistently outstanding.

Not only are the storylines and performances of the highest quality but the disks themselves are flawless",1363737600,,171,5.333333333333333
5183174,5,B008UDXBR8,"I buy every Beck I can get my hot little hands on and wish they'd release the old Martin Becks from the 90s with English subtitles. I managed to get them from Amazon in Germany but they do not have English subtitles and I had to return them, much to my dismay.
Swedish detectives are enjoying huge popularity here in the U.S. and, aside from the Rolf Lassgrd and Krister Hendricks versions of Wallander (both far superior to the Branaghs), Beck is the best.",1358899200,2,457,4.4523809523809526
5183175,5,B008UDXBR8,"This series of murder mysteries is excellent.  It draws the viewer into the story and keeps them on the edge of their seat!  The dialogue is easy to follow even though it is in Swedish (with occasional english) and is subtitled in english.

The only downside is knowing that we are nearing the end of the series...",1356998400,5,314,4.473684210526316
5183176,5,B008UDXBR8,"Before there was the girl with The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Joe Nesbo, Henning Mankell and all of the other excellent authors in the Scandinavian mystery invasion, there was the Martin Beck mystery series witten  by Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo published between 1965 and 1975. They are the Dashiel Hammett and Raymond Chandler of the Scandinavian school and their books stand up quite well against the best of Hammett and Chandler. This more modern television series captures the spirit of the books. While these are very tough minded mysteries, they offer more by way of humanistic values than we are used to seeing these days. Martin Beck, a middle aged policeman, is a bit neurotic - but his heart is good. The supporting character of the swaggering Gunvald Larsson, played by Mikael Persbrand, is one of the best characters in detective literature and television. Everything about this series is first rate and it is not to be missed by the lovers of Scandinavian noir or noir in general.",1354320000,8,995,4.852941176470588
5183177,5,B008UDXBR8,"Between 8 and 9 there seems to be 4 years, 9 having the date 2001. The girlfriend/coworker detective of Beck is not in episode 9, without explanation. New Beck's supervisor, too. Good plot, horrifying finish, but not if you  thought Gunvald was going to come out O.K. New woman detective is drawn well, unassuming and competent. Both Beck and Gunvald wear well and are characters I love to watch. Beck's daughter's brief appearances in the series too.",1348617600,2,451,4.857142857142857

8530499,5,B008UDXBR8,"Perhaps, the best crime drama series ever! Peter Haber is brilliant as Beck and serves as a catalyst for his cast membets, especially Gundval. Beck is compelling, real life and provides Americans a rich insight to another society. The direction, writing, editing, casting and photography is a PERFECT mix.",1447113600,2,305,5.244897959183674

8530502,5,B008UDXBR8,"I have written at length already about my ideas as they relate to international mystery shows. For those of us in the U.S. accustomed to Law and Order and CSI, with maybe a little Masterpiece Mystery thrown in for good measure, it may or may not surprise that many other countries have a robust tradition of detective and cop shows. Italy, France, Finland... The list goes on and on. Many of these shows are wonderful.

Some of the very best of these come from Scandinavia. They include the omnipotent Wallander -- the mother of all mystery shows. But there are also less well-known series, like Beck. (I always have to laugh because evidently ""Beck"" is trademarked... I can't help but wonder how the internationally famous musician feels about that...).

At any rate, Martin Beck and his compadres in the Homicide Division have been solving murders on television since the late 90's (there have been about 30 episodes made since then). The shows are ""movie"" length -- 90 minutes, so you have plenty of time to get thoroughly engaged. The stories are based on books by Mai Sjwall and Per Wahl that I have not read (but admit I should). Thanks to the invaluable MHz International Mystery (and also my local provider, Comcast), I have watched several episodes.

Beck (played wonderfully by Peter Haber) has a sidekick (of course he does!), Larsson (played by the smoldering Mikael Persbrandt), and where Beck is a pretty decent, well-intentioned chap (especially compared to some of his maladjusted counterparts in other Scandinavian series), his partner is a sort of Darth Vader to Beck's Luke. Larsson is the ultimate Bad Cop. He is bigoted. He's violent. He's snarky. He's funny and yet he's frightening. He does things cops shouldn't do. The discordance between the two characters is pitch-perfect, and adds to the fascination.

The plots are very good indeed. The pacing is perfect -- not too frenetic, and yet not too languid. They are right in the Goldilocks Zone. But be forewarned that the stories can be extremely disturbing. For example, a baby in a bassinet is viciously dropped to her death from a balcony. I can't help but think in most U.S. shows, the threat of such a terrible death would be made, but the action would not occur. But here, we see it happen, and to be honest I'm pretty sure I wish I hadn't. The audience is in no way protected from the brutality.

Amazingly, and unlike many of the other series out of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, there is some blessed comic relief provided in the episodes, in the guise of Grannen, Beck's bizarre (to put it mildly) next-door neighbor. I don't want to spoil anything about him for you here. So I'll just say if he doesn't make you laugh out loud at your TV, then you might need to work on your sense of humor.

These are really quite good. If you're a mystery fan, they'll be worth your time to watch, and your money if you want to buy the DVDs. And, as always, thanks to MHz International Mystery for all you do!",1425686400,4,2979,4.675572519083969
