great song selection, inspired playing, excellent photography, sparkling sound, lyrics if you want 'em, skip over whatever isn't your fave and save it to see clear through to another day.",1384473600,3,205,5.212121212121212

8568725,5,B00BHWG2XE,This is my favorite 'recent' Dead show.  It was aptly named.  This was taken during two shows about two weeks after the Buffalo show.  It is equally good musically as Jerry was really 'on' in both videos.  You can tell which day is which by when they change shirts.  I prefer this show because of the song list . .. . a lot of favorites.  This and the Trucking Up To Buffalo show are much better than the 'from the Vault' shows from later years.,1506988800,,445,4.176470588235294
8568726,5,B00BHWG2XE,Awesome concert video. Read some reviews about low video quality. Only problem with quality I saw was basically from the technology they had in the 80s. Sound is boys great and you can tell the boys are having a good old time!,1506816000,,226,4.404761904761905
8568727,5,B00BHWG2XE,"We go up to a friend's cabin in New Hampshire every summer and he's got this on VHS and we play darts and drink a bunch of beers in his man cave while the wives and kids are inside winding down after a long day of playing on the lake and this is hands down the best GD video out there (I have many, including all four vaults).  The look on Jerry's face during Rider says it all, killer Desolation Row (even if it was from the other night and it's not the actual complete show), hands down a great video and worth the 10 bucks.",1473552000,3,526,3.9622641509433962
8568728,2,B00BHWG2XE,"Killer show by the dead, with that being said I have seen this on VHS and first edition DVD. To get right to the point, the video quality on this DVD sucks! Shout factory really blew it! I have a high-quality 4K TV and solid Blu-ray player and it looks worse than It did when I was in college over 10 years ago!",1471392000,3,311,3.9523809523809526

8568730,5,B00BHWG2XE,"This is one of the best Grateful Dead concerts on film. Summer 1989 was definitely one of the band's several peaks, with their third major line-up, featuring Brent Mydland on keyboards. This Dvd and 'Truckin up to Buffalo' are, in my view, the best presentations from that Summer.

Brent's addition to the band may initially have been surprising because his distinctive vocals altered the sound of the band, but he was just so good. He was a great songwriter and vocalist, he was probably the best keyboard player in the Dead's history, and his backing vocals improved every song that he sang on. He was also such a great character.

The concert was recorded at Alpine Valley Music Theatre. It is 150 minutes long, and the set list is simply awesome, including 'Cumberland Blues', 'Desolation Row' and a really great 'China Cat/I Know You Rider'. Totally recommended.

2015 is a big year for Deadheads. As well as celebrating 50 years since they formed, there are two notable anniversaries. August 9th will be the twentieth anniversary of Jerry's death, while 26th July is Brent's twenty-fifth anniversary. R.I.P Brent and Jerry.",1436400000,4,1129,4.962962962962963
8568731,5,B00BHWG2XE,One great show from the Grateful Dead... You owe it to yourself to add this one to your collection of DVD shows that the Dead have out for release to the public. Downhill From Here  Shows a more laid back band that seemed to be enjoying themselves and each other as they played some of their massive catalog on this enchanted evening in WI.

8568732,5,B00BHWG2XE,Great DVD by the World's greatest Rock'n'Roll Band!,1408924800,,51,5.5
8568733,3,B00BHWG2XE,"I love this show. Having seen it many times I knew what was to come. I'm disappointed however in the quality of this copy. I wasn't expecting blu-ray HD or anything but it is very blurry. Sound is good but the audio bitrate could be better I think - 192kbps here doesn't seem right. To be fair, the first time I saw this recording was on Laser Disc on a high end system. In that format and equipment you could see every grain of Tiger, every single spec of dust, so yeah. But I've seen better VHS copies. Is this a bootleg?",1406851200,2,523,4.137254901960785
