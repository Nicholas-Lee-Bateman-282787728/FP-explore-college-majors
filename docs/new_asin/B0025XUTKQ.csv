3849914,5,B0025XUTKQ,This movie is beyond interesting... it challenges the very essence of what you think you know about the marijuana (and other drug) businesses in the US and Canada... I have no idea how they were able to get such great interviews with not only celebrities but government officials and other personalities as well... I can't wait to get my copy of this to watch at home since I've seen this flick a few times on the film festival circuit... I HIGHLY recommend you check out this documentary!,1242950400,3,489,4.632183908045977
3849915,5,B0025XUTKQ,This is the most well made documentary about Marijuana I have ever seen or heard about.  It is very informative as well as entertaining.  I've made my mom watch it and she even agreed it changed her attitude toward pot use.,1240876800,5,223,4.414634146341464

3849917,5,B0025XUTKQ,"When I order this documentary I didn't know what to think and didn't know what to expect but the reviews where to good to pass so I just went for it and order it. I order 2 by mistake and I'm happy I did. I have to say that it left me with my mouth wide open and it also open my mind and now I have a total understanding of the plant and it benefits and advantages. It made me wish I was a millionaire so I can send a copy to every house in California so everyone can really see the true about it..

Me? I tried it a few times but weed was not for me. So i choose not to take it, because,unlike cigarettes and tobacco, it isn't addictive, and cigarettes and tobacco are killing every single person that uses them. That's scientific fact.

3849953,5,B0025XUTKQ,"I have seen my fair share of documentaries on the subject of cannabis, many with clear bias either for or against, and I believe this to be the best one. This documentary is intelligent, concise while covering a broad range of topics, informative, pragmatic, with a beautiful musical score and style. It displays the failure and futility of cannabis prohibition, while giving rational arguments toward the fact that it should have never been outlawed in the first place. These arguments include: Cannabis usage does not cause cancer, black lung, emphysema, brain damage, or death by overdose.  It is not physically addictive, and does not induce laziness or violence. The Union touches on how prohibition of alcohol gave rise to organized crime, and points out that cannabis prohibition is no exception to empowering criminals. They show that high level drugs dealers as well as the government want prohibition to continue as they profit off of it. It points out the superiority of legalization to decriminalization, as with decriminalization it is legal to have but not to obtain or sell. They travel to different grow operations and discuss how lucrative it is for the growers, and discuss the union of people who band together to capitalize on cannabis.
Three key points they touch on are:
1) Prohibition has not reduced supply or demand.
2) It is a steady source of revenue for organized crime.
3) The crime and violence attributed to cannabis is due to its illegality, at the cost of taxpayers.
All of this for a drug that is a safer alternative to already regulated drugs.
They display the immense amount of money being made by privatized prisons and drug testing, who give money to lobby for harsher penalties for lesser crimes and random drug testing for all students. They discuss how cannabis can be used to treat hundreds of ailments, but can't be patented or used for profit by pharmaceutical companies.
Since the documentary was revealed to me I have shared it with anyone who I can sit down in front of the TV, including friends and family.
In my experience, there are two types of people who are against the legalization of cannabis; those who are misinformed and/or misled, and those who profit on the illegality of cannabis. This documentary is the perfect instrument to open the eyes of those who are in the former category.
The film is a brilliant refutation of arguments by those who wish cannabis to remain illegal and I can't recommend it enough.",1380067200,,2468,4.890214797136038

There is nothing more than a modern day witch hunt against this God givin miricle plant and those that are smart enough to see the benifits for it's uses both as medicine and in industry. It is possibly the most useful and important plant on earth. People that know nothing of the plant and believe the lies/propaganda that have been associated with it over the years by our governments may as well live in the times of the crusaides against witchcraft as they are as intelligent as those that lived in that era and before when everyone thought the earth was flat. There is no excuse for this ignorance this day and time. It is time to wake up and realize that the truths are known by most. It is a sin against God and all of humanity to believe otherwise. Watch the movie and do some research on the subject and you will be enlightened. Hopefully you will be as angry as I am that we spend so much tax money fighting something that can be benificial to us all. It does not have to be just smoked!

So it would cost pharmaceutical companies billions of dollars, if marijuana was made legal it would cost Alcohol Companies money as well. When you see those ""anti-drug commercials"" those are sponsored by ""Drug Free America"" the company ""Drug Free America"" is sponsored by Alcohol Companies! It's hilarious, alcohol is a drug!

400,000 people die each year ALONE from smoking cigarettes.

No one has ever died from marijuana, EVER. (I challenge anyone who read this to see for themselves)

*Actual Review*

This movie is really amazing. It's not long, and it's packed with useful information that should be brought up to everybody's attention about marijuana. The number 1 thing that really surprised me was the information about 'other drugs' that nobody's (at least through television) are mentioning, about Alcohol, Cigarettes, and Prescription and over-the-counter drugs.

It's well written, and very immersive.

I would highly recommend anyone who is interested or slightly interested to check this documentary out. You will not be disappointed and will leave with newly found information that will change your view about marijuana and the propaganda that's being fed to you, and the world. Have a open mind, and be a free thinker, find out the truth about such debatable subject's and most of all, be smart, logical, and reasonable.

Take Care,

3849990,5,B0025XUTKQ,"I think this movie should be required viewing.
There are alot of misconceptions about marijuana. These untruths have influenced our country's policies and penal system. This movie will enlighten even the most skeptical people. This is a riviting, entertaining, and informative movie!",1285545600,,283,5.761904761904762
3849991,4,B0025XUTKQ,"I wasn't high when I watched this very entertaining expose of high crimes of stupidity that are blocking the decriminalization of pot--but I was sure high after watching it. THE UNION: The Business of Getting High covers all the bases relating to the subject, and does so quite effectively without ever being preachy or boring. In fact, it's high entertainment. So, OK, I'll drop the HIGH...for now.

Among many other things, the film points out how Prohibition benefits the drug cartels & mass growers and inflates prices so high (sorry) as to result in murdering over it; that pot is non-addictive; that it is effective for over 200 known medical conditions;and shows that the U.S. has a long history misunderstanding the many uses of hemp in textiles, etc.

There are ""undercover"" scenes where the viewer is shown various types of indoor cultivation of marijuana set-ups, including inside a big rig parked in the Canadian outback; explains that Prohibition jacks up the prices even for medical pot 3000%!

My favorite scene featured knockout beautiful Watermelon Girl filmed in her lovely kitchen. She makes all kinds of pot dainties & generally performs good works in spreading the word.

The most intense scene featured an actual victim of MS. Before having a few tokes he was racked with uncontrolled shaking & barely able to say a word. After smoking the shaking ceased & he was abble to communicate at length.

There was a section dealing with the 60's that showed that marijuana played a real role in the consciousness expansion of a generation & galvinized them in standing up to the repressive social & war policies of the Govt. Nixon, Reagan & the Bush Boys promoted the War Against Drugs (a war primarily aimed at eradicating pot--and has a lot to do today in militarizing the Border.) As the movie indicates they didn't like the idea of ""young people getting together, getting stoned, reading books...and talking.""

So there's a little pinch of everything in THE UNION. I personally would have liked to have seen a little on its spiritual/earth ritual aspects--but I can understand why they didn't. Legalization is a difficult enough cause to promote without also showing that it can offer an rewarding alternative to the empty materialism & violent behavior so pervasive today.

3849999,4,B0025XUTKQ,"I really liked this documentary about cannabis. I've seen a few and what I liked the best about this one was the sobering black market analysis that showed how this enormous economy ties into the legal market as well. Also, it kept the usual fringe-type, conspiracy stuff at an absolute minimum. I really, really dislike the one dimensional ""rah rah cannabis is God and can solve all problems in the world"". Sure, some got to say that too, sort of, but all in all a very serious documentary.

It was also refreshing to see someone tackle the issue from a mainly grower viewpoint. Most of the time it's tied helplessly into crime and policing and so on. That issue was - again - in there, but it was downplayed more than usual.

That helps normalize the issue. Closest analogy that comes to mind would be an 1920-1933-era documentary on home brewing, distilling and wine making during American alcohol prohibition with the whole ""Elliot Ness & Capone thing"" at the sideline.

So why only 4 stars, when it's one of the best documentaries I've ever seen? It's probably mostly me, but I'm also a sort of expert on the whole War on Drugs issue and have even made a speech in the Danish parliament building for like-minded experts, criminologists, social workers, drug researchers, politicians and people treating addiction. I really wish someone with an interest in cannabis would have the guts to come out and say that every single thing that can be said for the pathology of the black market for cannabis also applies to every other other drug out there. This even applies to our much loved alcohol, as the American experiment from 1920-1933 showed us that every single bad thing you can think of (plus a few things that nobody even had the imagination to think of) happens to ANY drug that's subjected to something as vile, unjust and harm-accelerating as The War on Drugs.

Also, to have hit the 5 star rating the movie would have had to touch me (like ""In Pot We Trust"" did). Though in all fairness, the angle of the movie didn't really play up to that sort of thing, and maybe that's a good thing. Especially for the more critical viewers who, in my experience, reacts quite skeptically to the really deep, horrible things perpetrated by the War on Drugs. This documentary contains just enough reality to make the point, but not enough to put off those viewers with a low to moderate knowledge of the subject. Some realities are just too horrible to contemplate, like what faces people like Marc Emery and his employees and those countless other casualties in the politicians' career platform called ""The War on Drugs"".",1270684800,,2620,4.713973799126638
3850000,3,B0025XUTKQ,"First Off: I am in favor of legalizing marijuana but that wasn't enough for me to be able to overlook the fallacies of this documentary.  Just a couple examples:

when discussing the number of deaths caused by various drugs they use one set of standards for alcohol (total number of deaths caused included dui deaths) and for marijuana they use a different standard (the fact that it's impossible to die from an overdose).  But they try to make it like a straight up comparison.

when addressing the claim of whether or not marijuana makes people lazy they present the evidence that canada and the u.s. have high rates of marijuana use and never the less are highly productive countries.  Then they point out a handful of famous people who smoke pot and say ""see, these guys smoke pot and they aren't thought to be lazy, therefore pot doesn't make you lazy.""  I think the filmmaker should look into if smoking pot makes you not realize the difference between causation and correlation.  And the icing on the logic fallicy cake is they actually parade out Bill Clinton as an argument that pot doesn't make you lazy-Bill Clinton-who admitted to trying pot once a real long time ago!  You could watch this movie completely stoned and it would still jump out at you the fact that when addressing things like the level of addiction of marijuana they mention all kinds of studies but when it comes to their claims that marijuana doesn't make you lazy you get not a single piece of evidence that would back up their claims.

Anyway, this documentary stumbles upon some good points but there's too much false arguments like the two examples I give.",1270339200,5,1640,4.686411149825784

Follow filmmaker Adam Scorgie as he demystifies the the underground market and brings light to how an industry can function while remaining illegal. Through interviews with growers, police officers, criminologists, economists, doctors, politicians and pop culture icons, Scorgie examines the cause and effect nature of the business behind getting high. Nobody's innocent in this exploration of an industry that may be profiting more by being illegal."" (Synopsis from DVD jacket).

I watched this video out of curiosity about the British Columbian weed trade. Instead, out of an hour and a half or so of video, I got about 20 +/- minutes of BC and 1hr 10 minutes of ""Let's legalize pot."" So, even though the film was not as advertised, it was not all bad and the rest of this review will attempt to reflect that.

Pros- Well written and produced, this film makes a solid argument on why U.S. marijuana laws are behind the times and are more harmful than helpful. Also covered are medical marijuana arguments and (anecdotal) crime statistic evidence with references to incarceration statistics. Other sides are offered, presenting a well rounded argument.

Cons- If you are not already in the pro-pot movement, this film offers no new information or views to sway your opinion. The manner in which it presents the business aspect of dealing MJ may actually make one more fervently against legalization (or at least want to strengthen enforcement). This film was also made on the cheap, with many of the supporting clips reminiscent of 6th grade safety videos, though some may argue that this adds charm.",1254009600,8,1734,5.120141342756184

3850013,5,B0025XUTKQ,"Cannabis culture, particularly in the medium of film, tends to unintentionally parody and belittle itself by excessively glamorizing the drug and perpetuating stereotypes about its users, but this documentary provides a serious platform for intelligent, well-spoken advocates of legalization to make logical (and not easily refutable) points against the U.S. and Canada's present drug policies.

I'd never expect a film to change a true skeptic's mind, nor would I ever force my beliefs on anyone resistant to them...but if ever a doubter were curious to hear the pro-legalization side of the marijuana debate, I'd recommend this film.  It's a succinct, comprehensive, powerful (but not too preachy) rundown of all the best arguments in favor of what is, in millions of people's opinions, an unfairly vilified substance.

(Also, it's worth mentioning that Amazon may be doing the film a disservice by listing Tommy Chong and Joe Rogan as its stars.  Each has less than three minutes of screen time, and both are immensely composed and well-spoken compared to their appearances in dumb stoner comedies and inane reality television, respectively.

I was raised with a very conservative view about drugs and almost got into a fight with my best friend for giving my girlfriend a hit off a joint. In the meantime I was the guy coming to the party with a 12 pack of beer, then driving home. As I started from these humble ""anti-(illegal)drug"" years, I expanded my world, began traveling and learning the truth about cannabis. I have been initiated into many spiritual practices as ganja as the focal point. You would be correct in saying that almost every religion or form of spirituality has its roots in cannabis. Yes, even Jesus enjoyed his herbal remedies. Today I am a registered Minister of Cannabis.

Why are the healing medicines demonized and made illegal?
