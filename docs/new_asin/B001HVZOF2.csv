3645257,4,B001HVZOF2,The visuals and the actual dancing were excellent.  I would have liked to have had it subtitled in English.  I could not follow what was being said.,1356307200,,148,4.444444444444445
3645258,2,B001HVZOF2,"My mistake I'm sure, but I thought this would be acrobatic perfomances.  It is actually a cultural history lesson.  There are no complete performances shown, only snippets.  There are subtitles avaible.",1246924800,4,202,5.451612903225806
3645259,5,B001HVZOF2,"This DVD is mastered entirely in Chinese, which is fine, as all you need to know is to click on the bottom left set of writing. Once you do..... be prepared for a human acro-gymnastic extravaganza. I love Cirque Du Soleil, and this is where they must get their inspiration.

This particular DVD consist of best of roughly 1994-2002 (going by the readable portion) acts performed by the Chinese acrobatic troupe. There are 17 two to ten minute ""acts"", or excerpts of various performances, they are mostly highlights, so you see the most spectacular portions with much of the setup for the act left out. There are the yo-yo twirling, one hand standing, pole climbing, trapeze artists, balancing, extreme flexibility, strength acts, etc. It all comes to an end in a Chinese version of a forest animals at play act (my interpretation) where the performers dress in animal suits (deer, mice, cats, tigers, etc) rather than in the traditional (For Chinese anyway) folk and leotard outfits. For me it was incredible.

The soundtrack is traditional Chinese with some Western Classical music, all added later on, to fit in with the motions. While somewhat detached, it is choreographically as precise as the performances themselves.",1229990400,2,1223,5.019704433497537
8309846,3,B001HVZOF2,"This is not a performance, but a documentary of history and culture similar to what you would find on the History Channel.  This is done in Chinese Mandarin with English subtitles, and yes, the subtitles do go a bit fast, so expect to rewind a few times.  The documentary is split into two parts or shows.  The first one is about the history of Chinese acrobatics and the second one is about Lion Dance, a form of Chinese acrobatics found in southern China and Beijing.  I never knew about the difference between the lion dances between north and south, so this was quite interesting to learn.  The ones you see in the picture are lions from Beijing (north) because they are red/orange vs. the ones from Hong Kong (south) tends to be colorful.  The dance are a bit different too.  For cultural learning, this is a decent film, but the video does move kind of fast.",1455580800,,864,4.5
8309847,2,B001HVZOF2,"Interesting film, it's all in Chinese with English subtitles.  It was hard for me to follow as the subtitles did not remain on the screen long enough for me to read the entire text.",1430006400,,181,4.323529411764706

8309850,2,B001HVZOF2,I did not like this video.  It was all over the place.  Not what I expected.  The video itself was very poor quality.,1407888000,,117,4.0
8309851,3,B001HVZOF2,"The show was good but the closed captioning was too fast and too distracting.
I enjoyed learning about the cultural aspects of the different performances and dances.",1397865600,,165,5.148148148148148
8309852,4,B001HVZOF2,"Once again, Chinese acrobats keep you on the edge of your seat with their masterful performances. Caution: you can't multitask while watching this show. It was also helpful to learn the history of the Lion Dance (English subtitled). This made that segment of the show even more enjoyable.",1395014400,,288,5.020833333333333
8309853,3,B001HVZOF2,"this was very entertaining and educational at the same time. A whole different world to see, because you  see lots of different countrys styles.",1394236800,,144,5.0
8309854,5,B001HVZOF2,"Although the translations from Chinese to English may be a bit quirky, and it may be difficult to keep up with the subtitles while viewing the amazing performances, I think this video deserves a 5-star rating because of the amount of valuable educational content.  The narrative explaining the historical evolution of Chinese acrobatics and the lion dance, the incredibly demanding and superior skill levels of the artists, the unique aspects of each style, and the cultural importance of these art forms to the various Asian communities makes it well worth watching. The narrative gives you an inside look at how these breathtakingly stunning performances evolved into the artistic renditions the world has come to appreciate. It is evident that Cirque Du Soleil shows originated with Chinese acrobatics.
The video is divided into numerous segments, each describing the background and skill level required for that particular type of talent, along with over-the-top performances by hundreds of artists.  It's truly fascinating!
I would recommend watching it at least twice: once just to read the informative subtitles, and once just to watch the performances.",1387843200,,1160,5.403314917127072
8309855,2,B001HVZOF2,"I was expecting to see a lot of performances. There were still performances, but the subtitles were all about how the Chinese started Acrobatics and Cirque has stolen it. I was really unimpressed. I would have purchased it if it was actual performances.",1369785600,3,253,4.906976744186046
