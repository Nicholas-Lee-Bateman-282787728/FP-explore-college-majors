8159120,5,B0001NIZDK,"This series has so many good things about it. Good story lines that focus on Neil Grayling and Di Barker's relationship. Snowball's suicide. Bodybag's husband's suicide. All greatly acted from all actors involved.

The only negative part for me was having Shell Dockley back for a few episodes. I found that a desperate move. Debra Stephensen is a brilliant actress and the character could of gone on to do more great storylines. Top Dog Yvonne Atkins dies here in this series. Another sad story.

Two good new characters - Selena and Kris come which is a similar love story like Nikki and Helen. But Kris and Selena are great characters as well.",1444694400,,646,4.758928571428571
8159121,5,B0001NIZDK,this is the best tv show I've ever seen. The first couple of seasons are the best. I miss Helen and Nicky but the show is still strong. I wish they come up with another show like this one.,1243296000,,188,3.8461538461538463
