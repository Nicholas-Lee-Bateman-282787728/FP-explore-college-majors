7794819,5,0977450309,"Ken Burns could not have done a better job researching, shooting and producing this video.  The historical content is worth the watch; but the beautiful imagery is so stunning that you forget we are learning about Jefferson's experiments growing grapes but never actually making any wine.  He did however know exactly how to organize great French wine buying adventures. Jefferson was also adept at spotting an interesting business opportunity, even if it did take a couple hundred years to materialize.

Every wine shop should have a stack of these DVDs on the counter for their customers.",1363132800,3,590,5.125
