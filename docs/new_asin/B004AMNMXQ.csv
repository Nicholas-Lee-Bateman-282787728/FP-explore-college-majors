8420509,5,B004AMNMXQ,"This film was very interesting and very touching. It has interviews and stories from many different Dads, Moms, and children. We also get the views and ideas from many family experts. We learn about the influence a Dad can have on his children. We learn about the changing roles of Dads and what in our society affects that. We get a look at the life of stay-at-home-Dads, and how our culture views them and affects them. The director and narrator, and all the interviewees were very sincere and honest in sharing their thoughts. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.",1403827200,,572,4.73
8420510,5,B004AMNMXQ,"I think Dana Glazer has done a fabulous job with this movie.  He has tapped a wonderful breadth of people to interview - crossing race, income, and with a superb interview with a grandpa-serving-as-dad he crosses age as well.  The documentary has a great dose of humor yet offers a serious treatment of the extraordinary change that is under way. I am a dad who has lived a very different life than my father, as I have been freed from many of the expectations that used to be commonplace for decades.  I loved seeing similar men with questions, challenges, but fundamentally with an overwhelming sense of joy.
Although the academic commentators are interesting, insightful, and often sweepingly critical, it is the live dads in this movie who are enlightening, and above all:
UPLIFTING!
It's a great time to be a man.",1311033600,,818,4.787234042553192
8420511,5,B004AMNMXQ,"This is a fantastic documentary on the changing cultural landscape of stay at home Dads, and just even being a Dad in general.  It's entertaining, informative and not dull for a moment.  It's heartfelt and funny in parts, but most importantly it does what a good documentary does:  It gives you information and a perspective you may not have had before watching it.  Well done.",1304553600,,377,4.753846153846154
8420512,5,B004AMNMXQ,"This documentary is a well-done summary of many current issues facing dads.  (One point of clarification: as a commenter below notes, the definition of ""dad"" here is a good dad, not a bad dad.  If you're not looking to be a good dad, or if you're not a woman interested in good dads and the issues they face, then this DVD is not for you.)

The change in family structure where most families are now 2-earner, and of the 15-17% that are 1-earner families, some 20% of those have the dad staying home, means that the father is much more engaged with his children and also does more work caring for them.  This DVD largely focuses on the father's needs to get this done and some of the barriers he faces.

I would recommend this DVD to both men and women who are contemplating marriage and children.  It may help sensitize them to ways to set up their marriages, families and jobs/careers for the evolution to modern shared parenting.  I wish more employers, politicians and other policy-makers would watch it as well.

My only suggestion for improvement is that it is a little bit sentimentalized.  A good complement to this DVD is John Badalement's book ""The Modern Dad's Dilemma,"" which discusses what children need from their fathers in the sense of knowing their children personally and letting their children know them personally.  This DVD has some discussion by Kyle Pruett (a child psychologist) of what the child needs from the father in that way, but, perhaps because of the limitations of the DVD format and some other important material covered, it doesn't provide the depth or breadth, or practical suggestions, that Badalament's book does.

Also, for people interested in shared parenting/shared earning, Marc and Amy Vachon's book ""Equally Shared Parenting"" is very helpful.",1304035200,,1788,4.867986798679868
8420513,5,B004AMNMXQ,"At some point over my nearly six years as an at-home dad, I became very interested in the the cultural shift that is taking place that allows and encourages fathers to be more involved in their children's lives. Over that time, I have eagerly anticipated Dana Glazer's Evolution of Dad documentary because I've hoped he could package the issues in a way that reaches a mainstream audience and brings the major issues facing dads to the forefront. I have to say, it meets and exceeds all my expectations.

As I watched the documentary, I kept thinking that I wished every parent I know could see this. I want new parents to see it because I want them to realize the important role that fathers plays in their child's life. I want my at-home dad/breadwinning partner friends to see it so they can reaffirm their dedication to their families and see how other families are making it work. I want parents in general to see the documentary because we all need to find ways to support the role of a parent both culturally and legally.

Dana spends time with three groups of people to introduce the issues. He tells the stories of several Dads from all walks of life. These vignettes pull at your heartstrings, but more importantly, each man's life illuminates the reality of the issues fathers are facing. Dana balances these stories with commentary from leading fatherhood and parenting experts, including Jeremy Adam Smith, Kyle Pruett, Marc and Amy Vachon, Michael Kimmel, and Scott Coltrane. He also includes commentary from people off the street that point out the stereotypes and external pressures fathers are feeling. As I hoped, this combination of perspectives brings to light many issues facing the modern family:

* The struggle for work-life balance
* Parenting with different styles
* The importance of an involved father
* The joys and struggles of an at-home father
* The legal rights of a divorced father
* The lack of social/legal support for parents in the workplace
* Gatekeeping parents
* The increase in fathers choosing to prioritize family over career
* The bright future of fatherhood and parenthood

Thank you to Dana and his team for their dedication to this project. I know that it has been a long struggle to get to the finish line, and I for one, will be sending copies to many of my friends and loved ones.",1303948800,4,2331,4.762376237623762
