8729429,5,B0142WIMUQ,"An excellent film in a beautiful package.

However...you can pick it up from Best Buy for $7-10...don't make the same mistake I did purchasing it from Amazon.",1468195200,,158,4.851851851851852
8729430,5,B0142WIMUQ,Very cool case ART ! It's the same transfer as earlier Blu's but you get a new Ultraviolet DL too. I usually don't double dip in that I already had the same blu ray disc from an earlier release but I thought the steelbook was cool ! I didn't buy from Amazon though in this case. Of course The movie is great too !,1453766400,,313,3.90625
8729431,5,B0142WIMUQ,"I just bought the new Thunder Ball Steel book Blu Ray and even though I own the"" Sean Connery Collection "" vol. 1+2 , I still wanted to se it in BluRay. First off I never noticed that Bonds shirt in the opening scene / fight is blue. This film has always been special for Me since it was my first Bond film and since been a vivid Fan since. Starting off the John Barry soundtrack is great  with the Tom Jones theme song ( though I still like Mr. Kiss , Kiss Bang Bang theme I liked better ) with the opening design by Maurice Binder is always a feast to enjoy with early Bond films . The movie opens with  Largo entering like European type social services where they extort people to be in their debt to do their bidding.  Then He enters though a secret door to where in a large room with people seated in chairs  as # 1 has them report on financial reports as one is too greedy finds himself electrocuted  as then Largo explains His plans to steal 2 Nuclear warheads and blow them off near the Florida coast unless they get millions of dollars  .We go to England where M sent Bond to a Spa  recover from His fast life , as Bond uncovers something strange there. This film has it all gadgets , Bond underwater , on land , in the air  . Its  nice to see when Bond was a "" real player with Women ""The movie stays someone with the book , though some characters are included in the film where not in the novel , also much more action than the novel . This film gives Bond wit as He play cat and mouse with Largo before Largo wants Him dead .This film sports a great underwater fight scene . I found that the colors are very good as the sound . I saw more detail in things I haven't seen before I owned this BluRay. This is the first "" Classic Bond ""with Connery in Bluray and Im going to pick up FRWL next . They quite more cheaper on Amazon than where I bought mine . If your a Fan collecting more 007 DVDs and want the Steel Books , they are better made than some I bought of another title . These Books are made to last better than then some that have too much plastic inside. .They are nice to collect the ones You like for a cheap price .",1444089600,6,2139,4.002347417840376
8729432,5,B0142WIMUQ,"THUNDERBALL is a very Nostalgic and Endearing early Bond Film. This film somehow sums up a feeling of nostalgia and endearment for the way it engulfed audiences, myself included, into the wonderful world of James Bond. Sean Connery did it with such effortless and natural charm and aplomb like no other. He's a tough and resourceful blunt instrument with a level of intelligence sophistication still impressive to this day. The world of THUNDERBALL is elegant where the villains live an opulent style of life which is a veneer for their sinister plans. In a bit of irony James Bond lives in that same world and he is up to the challenge to foil whatever mayhem they concoct.

After a one-film hiatus SPECTRE returns. So has Sean Connery as he was finally groomed to perfection as the definitive screen incarnation of James Bond in GOLDFINGER. Terence Young is also back as director. However, he seems to have been influenced over the fine-tuning that Guy Hamilton brought to the main character and overall tone of GOLDFINGER. Due to that film's success Young seems to be floundering here being diverted from his vision of the character that he helped bring to the screen. Young is 180 degrees from being the auteur he envisioned himself to be. The film seems loosely constructed and leisurely acted. Adolfo Celi as Emilio Largo looks the part but he never seems a real threat to Bond. In fact he seems to lose every encounter with Bond whether it be at the gambling tables or engaging in idle banter on the merits of women vs. guns. Bond outdoes him in skeet shooting without even looking at the target.

What makes the film very memorable is John Barry's rich score and Lamar Boren's beautiful and colorful underwater photography. The two went hand in hand. I also thought the villains' plot to hijack a Vulcan jet was extremely well filmed and executed. This film has a very British feel to as it should have. Going back to John Barry's impressive and complex score for THUNDERBALL, it is here that he truly puts his inimitable stamp on the entire sound for the series during that period that were followed by his scores for YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and the lighter sounding, yet lavish DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. The scores for these four James Bond films, are richly textured, meticulously scored for each required scene and are emotionally charged.",1424304000,,2376,4.7926829268292686
