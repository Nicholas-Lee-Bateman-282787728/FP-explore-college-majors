If you want less resistance you could always do the DVD without it. Love this barre workout and as a Neighborhood Barre client in Knoxville I became incredibly toned when I incorporated barre just a few times a week. The results were incredible when I bumped it up to 4+ times a week, so much quicker than any other workout I've tried, I'm hooked!",1424822400,,479,4.274725274725275
8721476,5,B00T3G95PI,"Barre Skinny vol. 2 delivers another amazing, full-body workout! The red tube is all you need (perfect for travel!) to get that burn and shake that we all love during barre class! Even if you've never taken a class, the workout is easy to follow and offers modifications for every experience level. My favorite section is the arm workout- you can literally see your muscles toning as you go through the movements!!!",1424736000,2,415,4.777777777777778
8721477,5,B00T3G95PI,"As a Mommy who can't get to barre everyday, this video has been a wish come true! These are sets straight from class, like you still made it to the studio! These ladies didn't hold back on intensity and you will definitely get your shake! Seriously the best barre video out there!",1424649600,2,280,4.403846153846154
8721478,5,B00T3G95PI,"As a new mommy, my neighborhood barre DVDs really come in handy when I can't get out of the house for a workout. Vol 2 really steps it up and adds great variety and intensity with the red tube. Fun music too- such a great burn!!",1424649600,,228,3.9782608695652173
8721479,5,B00T3G95PI,"This DVD has been my lifesaver when I'm not able to attend class! I love taking it with me when I go out of town, and I can't wait to use it with my friends on spring break in a couple of weeks!",1424649600,,194,3.5348837209302326
8721480,5,B00T3G95PI,"A wonderful addition to the first DVD. I'm always looking for something to continue challenging me while I'm away on vacation. The red tube is KILLER! Also, the warmup was a great challenge and change!",1424649600,2,201,4.771428571428571
8721481,5,B00T3G95PI,"As a current client of NB, I was so excited to try the DVD and was so pleased with it! The intensity level mirrored that of a class in studio and is perfect for days when I cannot make it in to take class. It was so easy to follow along with and I feel continually challenged by the DVD each time I watch it!",1424649600,2,308,3.753846153846154
