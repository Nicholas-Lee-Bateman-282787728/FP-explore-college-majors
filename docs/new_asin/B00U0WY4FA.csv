7027199,5,B00U0WY4FA,"This is my favorite anime, and I was so happy to see it make its way to a region free DVD. The DVD's are well kept in the case, clean and free of scratches. The menus were easy to navigate, and the clean opening and closing were a nice bonus. The subtitles were accurate with few typos.

I would love to get the movies and Jump special in region free and subbed!",1455321600,,362,4.027777777777778
7027200,5,B00U0WY4FA,"Watched it for one voice actor, who wasn't even a main character, and fell in love with the show. Each character has his own personality and they all end up growing throughout the show. Never thought I'd enjoy a sports anime, but this is really great.",1453852800,,251,4.478260869565218

7027202,4,B00U0WY4FA,I took off a star because of the packaging. I'm sure this was the delivery services fault but it would be best if the dvd was packaged in a box instead of an envelope.  Regardless the dvd are still playable. Not a scratch on them and I am very happy with my purchase :) thank you!,1438646400,3,280,4.0
7027203,4,B00U0WY4FA,"Let's make this clear: This show is a 10/10, 100% A+ Sports Anime perfection. You should watch it. Now. Yesterday. But Sentai...

I'm sorry Funimation. I'm so so sorry that I spoke ill of you in previous reviews. Will you ever forgive me? Because the winner of subpar domestic releases is undoubtedly Sentai Filmworks.

I watch everything subbed, so I didn't care about not having an English voice cast. I would have never heard it anyway, and it would have greatly delayed the release. However, Sentai's releases are just... laughable. The packaging is always flimsy and awful. There are never any special features to speak of. And that would be all well and good, except they still charge more than Funimation. EVEN THAT I could look over, because in the grand scheme of things, whatever. But the subs... their subs are the worst in the industry.

I'm still learning Japanese. I won't pretend to be perfect. But some of the choices Sentai made while subbing were just bewildering. Easy example: in one scene they use the word for bird, ""tori."" They translated it as ""duck.""

Okay, weird choice. Whatever.

A few scenes later a character uses the word for crow, ""karasu"". It's their team's mascot. They were referring to it in such a sense. They translated it as ""bird.""

WHY, THOUGH???? The inconsistencies are just...

Then they translate Hinata cursing when he wasn't using foul language, and they don't translate Kageyama actually using foul language. At that point you're screwing with the character's personalities. I would recommend watching this on Crunchyroll first so you get accurate subbing.

On the bright side, and for anyone who knows Japanese and doesn't need subtitles, the picture is beautiful. And the sound-- wow. It blew me away. It sounded like someone was spiking in my living room. Sentai needs to hire some new subbers. I'm backed against a wall because I want to support the industry and my favorite franchises, but it's not like I can give Funimation money instead of Sentai. I wish I could.

I suppose I should just be happy that this got licenses over here in the first place.",1433635200,68,2106,4.844011142061281
7027204,5,B00U0WY4FA,This is one of the best sports anime out right now.  I was hesitant to watch the series since it's Men's Volleyball but holy moly was I wrong.  I binged watched this series and it's really good.,1429142400,10,194,4.216216216216216
7027205,3,B00U0WY4FA,This is a Real shame. Another wondrful Anime series without an Englisch dub. Why????,1428019200,8,84,5.071428571428571

8703791,4,B00U0WY4FA,"My first reaction was that the bluray box seemed a little cheap maybe, but it's perfectly functional really.

I got a little skeptical once I put the first disc in because it doesn't really have a menu - it has one screen that lists the first 9 episodes so there are no options for turning subtitles on or off. The only version on this set is Japanese audio with English subtitles (which is what I was shooting for anyway, it just kind of threw me off when there was no setup option on the menu).

Quality of the subtitles: I like that they provide onscreen translations for Japanese text in the show, and that they place it near where the Japanese text is actually displayed instead of trying to cram it all at the bottom in parentheses or something or just skipping it all together. But if those translations appearing in on the screen bother you, be aware that this set does have that and you can't turn it off. But it's definitely not excessive. For example, they translate the writing on the club jackets once so that you know, but they don't have text hovering around every single time a jacket is on screen. Also, if multiple people are talking at once, they do provide translations for both, and distinguish between them by making one line white and slightly smaller (for background) and the other line yellow and slightly bigger (main subtitle color and size).

As far as accuracy of the translations, they're solid. There were a few things that threw me - like how they translate the players' heights into feet and inches instead of centimeters, but that's a preference thing. I got used to the Crunchyroll translations and these are a bit different (the bluray set uses ""Tiny Giant"" instead of ""Little Giant"" for example. This is me splitting hairs.) Also, something that drives me nuts but probably is not a big deal to normal people is that they don't use the honorifics in the subtitles. They translate them every time, even when there is not a comfortable English equivalent for things like senpai (these discs use ""upperclassman [name]"")

What else... Picture and sound are perfectly normal. Each episode has 8 chapter breaks and they are in logical places (which you learn to appreciate if you ever wind up with something that doesn't have that).

Oh, one other thing I noticed that's nice - the subtitles for the theme song switch off between an English translation of the song and the Japanese words being sung using English letters, so if you wanted to learn to sing along, you could :D

I think that pretty much covers everything... Overall I am very picky but this is a good set (if way overpriced at the time of my buying. Over $30 for half a season? lame.)",1487808000,3,2680,4.6079664570230605

8703795,5,B00U0WY4FA,"This is an anime I can watch over and over (and I have!) Love this anime! This one shows the drive to succeed and improve oneself. It grabbed my attention from the start and I'm so hooked that I can't wait for Sentai to release the 2nd season. Then I have to wait for 3rd season!!!! But if you like anime that have meaning or shows a ""I can do this!"" attitude, I highly recommend this anime.",1471910400,2,391,4.090909090909091

I will just say this is a great series and easily enjoyable by everyone. i have already watched it a few times and is my favorite sports anime. On a side note, I do somewhat understand Japanese and noticed that the translations used by Sentai were off/ inconsistent. Not a big issue and didn't alter the experience for me, but it's worth noting for those that understand the language.",1464480000,,459,4.679012345679013
8703798,5,B00U0WY4FA,"I watched this first on Anime Network. Awesome! And we thought volleyball was some lame sport. Not! This has a lot of relationship building, great games that draw you in, and explanation of how the game works with teamwork, who does what and how. Both on and off the court, this is a great anime, and well worth your time and money. I haven't watched the 2nd season yet, but I'll give that a review at some time, also.",1461628800,2,418,4.30379746835443
