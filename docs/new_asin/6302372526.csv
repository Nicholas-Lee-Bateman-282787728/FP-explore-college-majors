7825137,5,6302372526,"This is not a documentary film and not a collection of videos, nor is it a live concert. It is a still-life portrait painted monochrome at the end of the 20th century. It is a gem - something precious - a hand-walking-talking snap shot of magic in the making. It is a glimpse into the magician's hat - a rare chance to see what goes on in the making of celebrity.
I have a pretty good idea of what went on in the making of this jem. Director Gavin Bowden managed to do something truly incredible. He was a one man show and able to get things on film (not video) which would have been impossible for a crew. He deserves great praise for this 'missing link' film. Now that film making has better bridged the gap between analog and digital technology, projects like this stand out as one-of-a-kind.
It was a magic time. The peppers had just signed with Warners, who had promised to put the kind of money into promotion that would bring the band to the next level of success. This experimental film and the wonderful Videos for 'Give it Away' from Stephane Sednaoui and 'Under the Bridge' from Gus VanZandt were all part of that promotion.
As tanks rolled through the streets of LA to celebrate the US gulf war victory, John Frusciante sits up in the monk's cloister and tries to make sense of what has happened to him. He is the pretender to the soul of the film trying to fill the gap in the band left by the death of guitarist Hillel Slovak. Hillel's ghost haunts the mansion and the making of Blood Sugar Sex Magic. The true soul runs throughout the film in Flea's moody bass line. Anthony later takes over with a candid glimpse into a not so glamorous past.
Every once in a while I buy a copy for a friend and read the reviews on Amazon.com to get a feeling for how it is still received. I am always pleased with the intelligent and positive responses which seem to transcend the usual fanaticism surrounding the band.
Something to listen for when you watch this film is the thoughts on knuckleheadism - as they have become prophetic. The boys love the Three Stooges. Think about the success of Eminem and what market buys his music. Apparently having serious opinions about serious issues requires a little wackiness to get it to sell. The Beastie Boys broke out as knuckleheads, the Peppers perpetuate and Eminem is the Elvis of Knuckleheads. I reckon that before too long the pattern will be better exposed and no longer funny. In the meantime enjoy 'the sophistication of having fun' made simple for everyone  when the Chili Peppers sing the Thelonius Monster classic lyrics, 'gotta - Metalica T-Shirt! gotta - little tiny baby mustache...' in this wonderfully enigmatic film.

John Frusciante is amazing!",992131200,,256,4.586956521739131
7825139,5,6302372526,"My brother bought this video and I personally think it is pretty cool. It shows how each song off ""Blood Sugar Sex Magik"" was made and how ""Under the Bridge"" and it's fantastic lyrics came about. Great video. 5 stars.",973641600,,217,4.45
7825140,5,6302372526,"After watching this video, I felt like I knew the peppers better and I listened to BSSM with a whole new perspective.  It showed the guys just being themselves.  I especially loved the part where John was bathing Clara  and when the guys are in the bathroom.  It shows the true genius of these  wonderful and talented guys.  You just get a good feeling when watching  this video. It's hard though to see John knowing how bad his life got not  long after the video was made.  But he's back now and healthier than ever.",953596800,,517,4.3578947368421055
7825141,5,6302372526,"This video is the most calming thing i have ever watched. I will leave it running as background noise while i'm doing other things. it's amazingly artistic, and you will hear things that you never noticed before on the  album blood sugar sex majic. you don't even need to be a chili peppers fan  to enjoy this.",952905600,,310,4.421052631578948
7825142,5,6302372526,"Funky monks is great, its totally ""behind the scenes' during the recording of Blood sugar, and you get to see everything from their recording, to looking at porn mags, telling weird stories to each other,  and just being, like the chili peppers are. If you like the chilis you'll  love this, if you want to get to know them more, don't bother with any  books, just watch this and it should give you an idea of why they come off  as half crazed loonies.",947116800,,452,4.345238095238095
