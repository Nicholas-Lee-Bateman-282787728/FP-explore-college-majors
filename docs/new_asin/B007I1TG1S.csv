8517011,1,B007I1TG1S,"This movie was awful and I was so surprise to see Robin Givens in such a low budget movie. She is so talented and the only reason why we rented the movie. This director needs to go back and try it again. Poor sound, low low budget movie. I want my money back.",1342915200,,259,3.9056603773584904
8517012,1,B007I1TG1S,"This was the worst movie that I've ever had the misfortune of trying to view.  I can't imagine who would think that this video was fit for human consumption by anyone that made an effort to look at it.  This is a dingy movie that looks as if it was shot in some sort of abandoned building. Make sure that you read the cover because I can barely tell you what the plot was about because of the poor quality of the sound. The acting was sub par (and I'm being really nice about this).  I didn't recognize any of the actors with the exception of Robin Givens and I can't imagine why she would choose to entangle herself with such a mess of a project. Be aware....after falling asleep 10 minutes into the movie, my husband woke up, tried to look at it again, then left in the middle...I should have followed him!!!!!!!",1340409600,,814,4.2727272727272725
8517013,1,B007I1TG1S,"This movie was reminiscence of a high school production, though I have seen high school productions that were much better! Acting was amateurish, only two scenes were used in the entire film and the sound was so poor it was difficult to understand what was being said during most of the movie. Movie had nothing to do with the title. Worst movie I have ever seen! Only rated one star because site will not allow you to leave the stars blank.",1339113600,,441,4.45679012345679
8517014,1,B007I1TG1S,"I don't often write reviews on movies but this one was horrible and I thought I would warn others as a public service. Everything about this movie is horrible - The story, the acting, the camera work (shaky), the lighting, the sound. The whole movie reminded me of a very low quality porn flick without the boobs. About the only half-way decent thing about this movie was the cover. And I don't know where the scene for the cover came from because the entire movie was filmed in a cheap, dingy looking hospital waiting room. Unless you are fanatical about Robin Givens or related by blood to one of the other actors (there's only about 6 of them) I would skip this film. You may be thinking I have a personal grudge about this film, but no, it's really that bad!",1338249600,,762,4.411347517730497
8517015,1,B007I1TG1S,"This movie was horrible, and they used poor Robin Givens to sell the movie. She barely had a role in the film, and her personal situation was irrelevant and random. Most of the movie takes place in an Apartment or Office building lobby that doubled as some sort of Hospital Waiting Room.....Camera is shaking, horrible mics, and annoying broadcasting quality.....This movie look liked a film major's sophomore year final. Save your money. I could not stop laughing at how random and cheap this movie was....I also hate the outcome, it was very unsettling...you had no one to root for or against and if you did, it didn't matter, cause the outcome was disappointing and the ending was random and ""are you serious""-worthy....the title doesn't even match the story line...especially not the tagline for it...",1337990400,,805,5.014925373134329
8517016,2,B007I1TG1S,I tried to watch this movie because I love Robin Givens but this movie is awful. Its very low budget and majority of the movie is film in the waiting room.,1337299200,,155,4.032258064516129
8517017,5,B007I1TG1S,Wow!  This movie is really touching. Funny at times but over all has an amazing message and I shed a few tears at one point because it hit close to home. Definitely recommend it!,1337126400,,178,4.235294117647059
