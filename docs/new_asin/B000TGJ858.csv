2898167,4,B000TGJ858,"This movie was very refreshing and teaches the meaning of Christmas, spreading God's Love with others and selflessness. Pooch and Keshia did a wonderful job.  This is a great family movie and fun to watch.",1295740800,,205,4.857142857142857
2898168,5,B000TGJ858,This is a very good christmas movie.  Everyone should purchase a copy to add the their christmas movie collection.,1291420800,,114,5.0
2898169,5,B000TGJ858,"THIS DVD MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!! IT WAS WELL ACTED, WELL PRODUCED & WELL WRITTEN!!!! I TRULY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE FROM BEGINNING TO END!!

something good on the other end.",1268006400,,84,4.6
2898171,4,B000TGJ858,"Although, the movie itself is o.k and the story line is predictable at times,its a movie you can watch with family. However Keisha Knight-Pullman is an awful actress. I truly believe the movie would have been more enjoyable if they had gotten a no name actress who could truly act play the leading part. Keisha did better when she was 5 and missing her lines on the Cosby show, but in this picture her acting is the Pitts.",1264204800,,422,4.423076923076923
2898172,4,B000TGJ858,"I first saw this movie on TV.  The second time it aired, I recorded it.  The third time, I just had to purchase it.  It is a wonderful movie about how busy we can get, but it is not too late to redirect what is important and that is our family.",1233446400,,244,3.7450980392156863
2898173,1,B000TGJ858,"Their heart was in the right place, but I wouldn't waste my money on this movie. I am a huge fan of both of the main actors, Hall and Pullian, but was greatly disappointed in the overall production value and screenplay. With a slightly more believable story, better dialog, and better cinematography/production value, this could have been a great movie. I hate to bash anything someone has put time/effort into, and especially with actors I really like, but truth be told, I can't recommend this movie to anyone.",1229817600,4,512,4.829545454545454
2898174,5,B000TGJ858,This was a cute movie. Pooch and Keisha had a nice chemisty togeather. The story is heart warming and well written. Man pooch is so fine!!,1226620800,7,138,4.346153846153846
2898175,3,B000TGJ858,"This happen to be an okay move. It didn't have all the bad words, that many thing one must use to get a point across. The acting was not the greatest, but these where not listed as top actress or actors. The plot was good. A young lady that thinks she is all that and above all others just bieng the daughter of well to do family. Spends money how and when she wants. Then its time to know what real friends act like. And really learn that is it better to give sometimes.
This young girl I believe was in one on T.Perry's plays, she can really sing. Now would have like 2 see more singing from the teens.
Many think they can do a much better job when I read reviews and they say that movie sucks and the acting was trouble, but they may not have had to make a movie in a week, or the actress walks out and they had to just make do with whom they have. But at lease they tried, and to get a point across.",1225584000,9,903,3.9130434782608696
2898176,5,B000TGJ858,I really love this movie.  This is a great christmas movie.  This movie is for the whole family,1211155200,4,95,4.222222222222222
2898197,5,B000TGJ858,Keshia has been in the movie business form a little girl until she was growing up and I love watching her,1400457600,,105,4.0476190476190474
2898198,5,B000TGJ858,"An exciting movie about a young angel and a spoiled rich girl, who come together to save an area of their town.  Moving.",1391126400,,120,4.217391304347826
2898199,4,B000TGJ858,"I think Keshia and ""fine thang"" are great in this movie together.  She's has a fun, upbeat energy and he's just cool!  It's on my list to watch every Christmas.  It's a feel-good movie that's nice to watch during the holidays.  Tom Bosley was a nice surprise. I had not seen him since Happy Days!  It was easy for me to watch because I could relate to the family's economic status better than most black movies. No profanity. No ""over done"" romantic scenes.  Good family movie for all!",1390521600,,485,4.454545454545454
