8203165,1,B000BDIZD0,"This would be great and I have tried and tried to get this dvd in the advertised US region 1 code. Problem is all of the amazon stock and at least 2 other sellers only have the other code product. I have ordered this 4 TIMES thru amazon and have yet to get a region 1 code for the USA.  DON'T FALL FOR THE ADVERTS, ITS NOT CODE 1!!!! SENDING 4TH one back today, I've tried",1173744000,4,372,3.8947368421052633

Buyer beware.  If you enjoy returning orders, this is the DVD for you!!!  Enjoy.",1171065600,2,277,4.132075471698113
8203167,1,B000BDIZD0,"I have most of the other Jools Holland ""Later"" discs but this is the first I came across as unable to play on either of my two DVD players. Even though its documented on packaging as E- Exempt from classification, Error messages appear upon attempt to playback. ""The Region Coding of this disc does not match that of player"". So it looks like without having a Region free player I will not able to view this disc therefore US buyers beware. Previous reviews are from outside the United States. I of course would most likely give this a four or five star review with the superb line-up that is offered but....",1162771200,4,608,4.486486486486487
8203168,5,B000BDIZD0,"Speachless!!!  I liked the Original COOL BRITANIA, but this one has more recent songs by groundbreaking British bands...  Check out Kaiser Chiefs, The Libertines and Catatonia.",1162425600,,176,5.730769230769231
8203169,5,B000BDIZD0,"This is a collection of live performances of british bands on the Jools Holland show (which is very good for the kind of artists they have on the show, you won't see them anywhere else).

To start the review, we have over 35 performances (some better than others) of well-known bands, such as Oasis, Blur, Keane, New Order, Coldplay, etc. and others that you've probably never heard of (McAlmont and Butler and The Ordinary Boys, anyone?).

To me, the highlights include:

""This Is Hardcore"" by Pulp - a great track, wonderful performance and incredible arrangements. Jarvis Cocker steals the show here, such a funny way to perform live!

""Why does it always rain on me?"" by Travis - I listened so many times to this track way back in 1999 when it became huge, that I had forgotten how good it was. A perfect sing-a-long and a fan favourite.

""Golden Touch"" by Ian Brown - The former frontman of The Stone Roses returns with a catchy track, great arrangements. There's an interview included on the DVD, he talks about his last album, ""Solarized"".

""Cigarrettes & Alcohol"" by Oasis - Any song that has the lyric ""I might as well do the white line"" has to be good and this one's really good actually! This track was performed during a special program about Oasis, but the song was released back in 1994.

""Helicopter"" by Bloc Party - Great energy in this one! Performed before their debut album was released.

""I Predict A Riot"" by Kaiser Chiefs - The british band of 2005, performing their biggest hit. It makes me wanna go out and dance all night long.

Some other bands have their time here, and there some interviews  that are good enough for fans. Overall it's a good compilation if you like british bands (such as myself); perhaps the only problem is that other well-known bands such as Kasabian, Muse and The Music are absent, this means we'll see a part 3 of this collection...",1153872000,5,1883,4.610778443113772
