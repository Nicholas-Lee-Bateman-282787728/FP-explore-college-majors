7555616,5,B018UEIYO6,"This is a fabulous documentary the Legends bring every thing to this movie, and show you how they are passing it to the legends that are yet to come  Talk about keeping the music alive! Otis Clay May he R.I.P. & Lil P-Nut is just adorable, Otis Clay Told me that when he first heard he was going to do a song with a rapper named Lil P-nut, he didn't quite know what to expect (he thought it was going to be someone in his early to late 20's  or so, LOL never did he expect this little kid that walked in, and completely blew him away. Bobby Blue Bland May he R.I.P  Mavis Staples, William Bell, Bobby Rush, Snoop Dogg, Terrence Howard, Yo Gotti, Come on these are people you wouldn't expect to come together, But you are so happy they did by the end of this film. I guarantee you will have shed a tear  whether it be from sadness or joy. If you love music Gospel, Soul, R&B, Rock, Blues, Rap .. no matter what you will enjoy this and you will know where the music came from. A lot is learned about the legends that have passed and some that passed shortly after this film was made.  I am looking forward to the next part. So much has happened since this one was made .  To all the amazing musicians that took part in this I salute you, and to all of you that have passed I pray you rest in peace.
I am grateful they had the foresight to pass the knowledge on.  The marriage of The original's with today's musicians, only greatness can come from that.  Thank you Martin Shore!! ! One more thing This is all live!",1459987200,6,1511,4.115646258503402
