972732,3,6305124345,"This is one of those movies that Hollywood produces with the ""throw in a nickel, get a dime"" attitude. It's a low cost film with a bunch of no name actors and a relatively famous one. Scott Bakula does a fine job, playing the player turned minor league manager.
The cinematography is fair, it's a watchable film, we get to see the return of Pedro Cerrano and Taka Tanaka. I wouldn't have high expectations of this film though. It is a clichd storyline, and if you want a better baseball movie watch ""Bull Durham.""
Just make sure when you buy this film to not get the Spanish subtitles unless you need them, I accidentally did just that.",1051401600,,636,4.444444444444445

972738,4,6305124345,"I enjoyed Major League 3 far more than the previous two, which I personally thought were rather ""wishey-washey"" with their hard-to-follow scripts! (sorry screenwriters!). As an aspiring tv/film screenwriter, I tend to take a lot of notice of the dialogue of scripts in tv/movies.  I come from New Zealand and everyone down under here is just mad about rugby, that watching a movie about baseball makes a refreshing change eh!  The 'on set' locations in Major League 3 were excellent and the actors were, for the most part, very believable.  The movie dialogue was very well-written and easy to follow even for us ""outsiders!""  My favourite scene in the film is when the voo-doo man from Mars is in the changing room before the Buzz team go out to play a game and he's talking to his voo-doo doll (isn't it Ja-boo or something similar?).  For some peculiar reason, I find that scene immensly funny!  Maybe I should write another sequel in the Major League series, you know something like ""Major League 4 - Down Under"" or something like that, eh?!  After all, my favourite actor in the film is Eric Bruskotter (who play Rube Baker).  I think he is just so incredibly handsome and it would be a good way to get him (and the rest of the cast) down to this part of the world!!",991872000,,1271,4.568281938325991

An improvement over ""Major League II,"" this threequel moves from the MLB to the AAA baseball. Scott Bakula headlines as Gus Cantrell, a minor league pitcher asked to coach the fictitious Charlotte Buzz, the Minnesota Twins' AAA farm team. The Twins are now owned by former Cleveland Indian Roger Dorn (Corbin Bernsen) who thinks Cantrell is the perfect formula for the ragtag team. Bringing back some players from previous entries, Cantrell finds himself more at war with the Twins' manager (Ted McGinley) which leads to the two teams squaring off in the ever-so-cliched ""big game.""

973127,4,6305124345,"I wasn't looking for perfection with this movie.  I'm a baseball nut and was looking for light entertainment.  Was not disappointed.  This movie is a riot.  Sure, it's corny in spots, but what the heck - I laughed myself silly, mostly over the tricks that Gus Cantrell plays, with great results, on some of his players and especially on his nemesis, the Twins' manager.  Furthermore, I learned some things about baseball that I hadn't known before.

AND I liked this movie because there was no sleeping-around in it, which seems to be the main ingredient in most movies these days; producers seem to feel the movie won't sell unless somebody is sleeping with somebody else's wife.  We don't need to watch stuff like that to make us happy.  Not wanting to load my mind with filth, I try to avoid R-rated shows.

"".....Back to the Minors""  tickled my funny-bone no end.  Wish we'd have more like it.  Another reason I bought it is that it offers English sub-titles, which I need.  The Amazon description here of the film doesn't say that they're available, but my copy, which I bought last year, does have them.

Like I said before, the movie is what it is. A goofy, often funny, movie that's almost entertaining the entire way through. Yes it's bad, but it's also enjoyable in that way. It's not trying to be a classic, it's trying to be a fun movie. And in that way I think it's very enjoyable.

Most fans of the other two major league films are very critical of this one. In my opinion, I really don't consider this a film in that trilogy. Yeah I know it shares the name of the other two, but it's just different. It's really just a film on it's own, and that's the way I think it should be seen as.",1148774400,4,864,3.9884393063583814

The key to the movie is that you can watch it with your kids and enjoy some of the goofy antics that only occur in baseball. So treat this on its own merit.  As a baseball movie it is up there with Sandlot, Angels in the Outfield and A League of Their Own.",1099872000,4,545,4.093457943925234
973163,4,6305124345,"I was a big fan of Major League, but was somewhat disappointed in Major League II, and as a result didn't buy Major League III for more than a year. I'm sorry about that, because it turned out to be as good as or better than any in terms of its story and execution, and casting.

In the first Major League, we got a first class baseball story of unlikely heroes, which held up well even though I thought the personal lives of some of the players was stressed a little too much. In Major League II, which is still entertaining, I think the chemistry suffered because of this and other continuity issues. For instance, Wesley Snipes, the base stealing pheenom, was replaced by another actor, yet we are supposed to believe he's the same person. Doesn't quite work. Also, the love interest focus switched from Tom Berenger to Charlie Sheen, and we are supposed to know all about (and root for) a former girlfriend we have never seen before, and whose existence wasn't even hinted at in the first film. And finally, the chemistry suffered a little more because the feud between the owner and the players was reintroduced in an unlikely way (why would she buy the team back if she wanted to get out of Cleveland so bad in the first film?). Still the second film was enjoyable and worth having, even with these issues.

So, I expected a lower budget, poorer result with Major League III, and boy, I was wrong. New characters and a new situations develop, and it all seems appropriate and fresh and the acting is top notch; the cast plays like a team and the script moves forward like a well-oiled machine. The music and photography are excellent and the action is in general spontaneous and very fun (like when the villan manager of the Twins hits himself in the head with a richocheting baseball). All the new characters carry off their roles extremely well, and all in all I think you should NOT skip this one if you like the series at all.",1097280000,9,1936,4.497159090909091
973164,5,6305124345,"MAJOR LEAGUE: BACK TO THE MINORS is one of those ""let's cheer for the underdogs who are up against the nasty ego boys!"".  And for that, it's a delightful comedy with some great moments.  It's not like an AIRPLANE spoof, but it does have some great comedic touches.

Scott Bakula as Gus, the guy who always wanted to make it to the big leagues, is recruited by irrepressible Corbin Bernsen to coach his farm team, The Buzz.  Gus is reluctant, but after some persuasion by his lovely girl friend Jensen Daggett, he takes it on.  Of course, the team is full of misfits, guys with talents but no one has bothered to show them how to use them:  for instance, their ace hittere (Walt Goggins) is a smart-mouthed, self-centered home run hitter--but he can't hit anything else.  The catcher Rube (the delightful Erik Bruskotter) throws his catches over the wall; the outfielder, Pops Morgan, has gotten out of shape and needs to play first base; their pitcher is a cool dude who has one pitch--the fastball that everybody expects and hits out of the park; and another pitcher who pitches so slow, he doesn't even register on the speedometer!  Fortunately, Dennis Haysbert and Takaaki Ishibashi are back from the second movie, and they add not only some good hitting, but some wacky humor.

Ted McGinley as the twin's pompous, selfloving manager, proves again how underappreciated he is.  Although having on a hit on TV's Hope and Faith, McGinley's never achieved the status he could have as the good looking, if disgusting, pretty boy!  He's great in this one.  Add Bob Uecker's hilarious commentary and the big game, you get what you expect:  the underdogs come out on top!

I think they should have just simply renamed the film. There's nothing wrong with having a different name for a film with a few of the same characters such as Roger Dorn, Pedro Cerrano and Taka Tanaka.
This movie comes out with some good baseball knowledge for both on the field and off the field stuff. Pops McGee and Doc who's fastballs couldn't kill a fly if it hit is straight on are great examples of what you see in the minors. Guys with heart who just aren't good enough to make it to the Bigs. Then there's the prima donna top prospect ""Downtown"" Anderson who thinks he's the next Ken Griffey Jr.
This film is meant to be fun, it's not supposed to be Bull Durham. It delivers what it wanted to deliver...entertainment. Especially for the baseball fan who doesn't want to see a monkey or a 10 year become a major leaguer. Although Little Big League is underrated as well, but that's a different story.
I would give this movie 3.5 out of 5 stars if it were possible, but we can't vote like that here, so I rounded it up.",1084579200,22,1234,4.346320346320346

I said undertaking not job for a reason! But Gus utilizes former teammates and previous movie cast members talents to turn this team from laughingstock to laudatory. This movie gives great laughs. The ace relief pitcher cant be picked up on the teams radar gun because it only picks up speeds above 60. The shortstop and second baseman are identical twin brothers both named Luis.  Taka Tinaka and Pedro Sorano the voodoo twins are reunited and provide ample laughs when they come to bat with black hoods over their heads and use pieces of wood they find as bats.

7883920,5,6305124345,"I enjoyed all the Major League series of movies. This one was the third (last) one made and is clearly low budget. It does star one of my favorite actors, Scott Bakula (Quantum Leap). He plays kind of a washed up minor league pitcher at the end of his career and winds up managing a minor league team, The Buzz. This is Thad farm team for the Minnesota Twins. Scotts character. Gus Cantrell doesnt see eye to eye with the twins Manager. Throw in Corbin Berenson, Bob Uecker, and cute storyline and its actually not a bad movie. I own it now. You can too! :)",1509235200,,557,4.264150943396227

7883924,3,6305124345,I thought this was a step down from the first two Major League movies.  Especially the first one.  Most of the cast was gone from this one.  Although there were still a few of them around.  But the freshness was wearing off and this one just wasn't the same.  It is till okay on it's own.,1505433600,,288,4.071428571428571

D and It came Looked GREAT and package looked great ,I didn't Have a chance for a few days To Look at The Movie, BUT when we did,IT Played 1 Min. 30 seconds  And then would not play at All No matter How much we cleaned It Or If we tried to Start Part way Through It went To The same place In the beginning & stopped. On Closer Exam Of the Dvd  WE seen That there were many, many  Sm. scratches  You didn't see unless held it up to the light just right,SO WE had no choice but The put the whole Thing into the trash & consider it a lesson learned , to look BEFORE you place the Paper work That is shipped with product Through The shredder!",1488931200,,657,3.8805970149253732
