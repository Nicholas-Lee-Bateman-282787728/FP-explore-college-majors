4176606,3,B003R4ZMKE,"Actually there is nothing wrong with Memphis Beat, that is unless you come from, or are familiar with the city in which it supposedly takes place.  In that respect it isn't much different from other Hollywood versions of the city (The Firm for instance).  So I will refrain from rating it based on it's cliched portrayal of the south and southerners in general (deep drawls, backwater, poorly educated) and Memphis in particular (Elvis sitings everywhere and blues -- jeez I wish we had that much blues action around here).  It's an adequate cop show and it is fun. I don't know where people get this idea that it's genre breaking, I guess that must be this new generation that doesn't watch or listen to anything older than a decade.  Still for my money if you truly want to see something quirky that actually feels like Memphis go buy a copy of Mystery Train.",1307491200,3,861,4.607843137254902
4176607,5,B003R4ZMKE,Many of us are waiting for the release of season one . Why the wait? TNT ran re-runs at 2 a.m. without mention. Is there any news on a release ?,1306627200,9,144,3.6774193548387095
4176608,5,B003R4ZMKE,"Jason Lee and all the Good Ole boys tell it like I remember it as a Virginia cop. Typical Ulster-Scot mind sharper than Sherlock which treats folks like one should.
Not much for R & B, Jason converted me.
Blueprint on how any show should be done now how do we get these clowns to bring it back",1301011200,6,293,4.068965517241379
4176609,5,B003R4ZMKE,I love this show and everything about it. Jason honors Elvis without trying to be Elvis. I can't wait for the DVD. This is a much better roll for Jason than was My Name Is Earl. Keep up the great work everyone. I'll be watching.,1298678400,6,228,4.088888888888889
4176610,5,B003R4ZMKE,"The lead singer from i 94 sings for the lead in Memphis Beat.  i 94 is a good but little known band.  The amazing thing is when the lead singer Mark Arnell sings the amazing old tunes for the show... magic!  The musical arrangements and Marks vocals are teriffic together.  An album of Mark Arnell singing the old tunes with new arrangements would sell ""millions""!  And just for the record.... Memphis Beat is a darn good show too.

4176611,5,B003R4ZMKE,"Not only is this show one of the slickest, quirkiest, and most entertaining new series this year but also the music is really OUTSTANDING, deserving of it's own special disk. It was the music that first caught my attention and now I find I need a new fix every week. It really is the icing on the cake for this program. I plan to add every season to my permanent collection.",1283558400,21,374,4.28169014084507
4176612,5,B003R4ZMKE,"Memphis Beat starts with a great play on words for a title, and goes on from there. The beat is of course, the street cop's (or in this case, street-wise cop's) territory. And in the case of Detective Dwight Hendricks (played to perfection by Jason Lee) his other passion is the very legacy of Memphis, its beat, the music. And the music in this show, like the writing and the acting, is fantastic! I am always delighted to find where they place the classic Green Onions in each episode. In addition, our Det. Hendricks likes to unwind by performing with his band, giving Lee the opportunity to treat us to a few minutes of his own takes on R&B, 50's pop and the blues in each episode.

Like other TNT dramas, both the writing and the ensemble cast are impeccable. All the characters are well written, and the story lines are rich and creative, with occasional humorous touches. Alfre Woodard is a real gem in this show, bringing a broad range to her character, Lt. Rice. All in all, Memphis Beat was added to my personal list of favs this summer, where it joins another TNT gem, Leverage.

I am looking forward to adding this DVD series to my collection, and watching Season 2.",1282262400,54,1178,4.5
4176613,5,B003R4ZMKE,I cannot wait for this show to come on....and am anxiously waiting for it to be released on DVD...I love Jason Lee...what a great show!!!!!!!,1282089600,9,141,4.68
4176614,5,B003R4ZMKE,There is honor in being the first to review a new show that is more than deserving of a 5 star praise.  This new series is ingenious.  Out of the box thinking and well written episodes makes this show what it is supposed to be..fabulous.  The talent explosion alone involved in this series is enough to keep you coming back for more.  Jason Lee is a brilliantly talented actor who deserves much praise.  If you have not yet seen it..watch it..then get on the waiting list to buy it.  I guarantee you will fall in love with Memphis.  ~ I can't get enough..Get's in your blood..That Memphis Beat. ~,1280448000,31,596,4.412844036697248
8403219,5,B003R4ZMKE,"I watched this show when it was on the air and I loved it. I was very disapoinyed when they took it off the air. I have been trying to buy season one and two , it seems like for ever but I haven't had any notice that it is available. I want it in DVD.",1440201600,,251,3.5
8403220,5,B003R4ZMKE,"This was my favorite series on TV while it was out. I am going to get both season 1 & 2 on dvd. This was a funny, heartfelt, cop show with a twist. I was heartbroken when it was cancelled. But then all of the good shows are lately it seems! Buy it now.",1438819200,,252,3.685185185185185
8403221,5,B003R4ZMKE,"I loved this show!  I can't believe it was canceled.  The music, storylines, and performances all joined to create an ensemble that worked like a fine tuned Memphis jazz piece.  What was the network thinking when they gave up on Memphis Beat and then keep other trash season after season?",1414972800,,288,4.72
8403222,4,B003R4ZMKE,"My husband and I were so disappointed when Memphis Beat was canceled, we loved this show. Lately we started buying complete tv shows that we can no longer part of a tv line-up, we hate reality shows or tv programing geared towards the 18-49. We are 50 something, there really isn't much for us on tv anymore - we loved the closer (got all of them). Was disappointed that Memphis Beat, S###%!My Dad Says, Rob, Major Crimes, just to name a few are not on DVD yet. Hope they become available soon, we'll be buying them. Desperate to watch some great shows.",1363305600,2,553,4.431372549019608
8403223,5,B003R4ZMKE,"This fantastic TV Show had something for every one. I particularly loved the interaction between the characters, especially Hendricks and Whitehead. It was interesting watching Suttons character develop over the 2 series. Jason Lee is fantastic as th 'Elvis' loving Cop. Please, please bring on the DVDs for all us Memphis Beat addicts.

8403224,5,B003R4ZMKE,"I just read that Memphis Beat was cancelled when TNT was making budget cuts to make room for the stupid show ""Dallas.""  Memphis Beat was a show the family could watch - no horrible sexual scenarios and no disgusting swear words. I loved the music and the fun atmosphere. I looked forward to Jason Lee's performance each week.

Please, somewone, make them hurry up with the DVDs for both seasons. I have some episodes saved but I want them all.",1347148800,7,443,4.525
8403225,4,B003R4ZMKE,"Memphis Beat is a cop show with a Southern flavor, and that's not just food that's featured.  Dwight gets the job done in a compassionate manner while surrounded by a cast of unusual personalities.  Throughout the series, music and Dwight's love of Memphis blues offers a counterpoint to the detective work.  As Amazon has failed to offer the two season set, fans might consider purchasing through dvdset4u.com, which does carry this and other hard to locate shows.",1334102400,5,465,5.012987012987013
8403226,5,B003R4ZMKE,"I really loved this show and I can't believe the fools at TNT who cancelled it. This was the kind of show that every one of all ages could watch.  It had humor, some sadness, and life in it.  I don't know about the rest of you but us Baby Boomers loved and there are many of us around with time to watch this show.  Especially loved Jason singing Elvis tunes.  What a waste.  I don't know about the what the networks think we want to watch but I have seen as much Law and Order as I can stand not mentioning Walker Texas Ranger.  I seen all of those and how many Golden Girls and Mash shows do we have to be faced with.  They tale off Memphis Beat and give us Two Poor Girls, and all the stupid reality shows.  Twenty and counting, give me a break.
Memphis Beat was refreshing.

8403227,5,B003R4ZMKE,"Memphis Beat is a wonderful new show with an outstanding performance by Jason Lee.  Not only is he a great looking in my opinion, he plays a cop with  a great ""heart"".  I also like his love for music.  He is very talented.  Each episode always ends on a happy and emotional note with Jason singing with his band.",1314144000,6,312,4.220338983050848

He is the greatest in comedy, singing, drama and sex appeal.  the other actors on the program certainly add to the appeal of this program.  I will buy season one and two as soon as they come out.  the story element of this program is also excellent.jason's singing is to die for and is hypnotnic.
