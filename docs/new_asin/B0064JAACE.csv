8492624,5,B0064JAACE,"The reason I gave five stars is because of the quality of the video. For a movie that's more than 30 years old, picture quality is incredible, but sound is monaural, it's not stereo, what a pity. it's not Dolby Digital and beside, audio quality is far from having being remastered. The movie, brought me back to my childhood, I wasn't even born when these episodes were aired, and still I like them. I have shown it to my friends and despite the ""antique of the filming, typical from those times, they consider it a master piece as I did. Not very often at those times, you could see so many great actors and actresses from different countries and speaking different languages, get together to film like this. It looks like the originals were filmed in English, which is great, but Spanish speakers were left behind as subtitles are only in three languages, and French and Spanish are missing. I think a new edition with Spanish, French and Portuguese subtitles would make it a real master piece. I'd highly recommend this episodes to all those who has never watched Emilio Salgari's one of the best adventure books ever written. Actor Kabir Bedi was born to play the character of Sandokan like no other actor. For those who don't know him, just mention that he is a voting member of the  Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, AKA Oscar Awards, he has the highest ranking civilian honor of the Italian Republic and has been awarded in most of the continents, Europe, USA and India, where he was born. Don't hesitate to watch the episodes, you'll be amazed and capture by the elegance of the actor's performance.",1456012800,,1618,4.6573426573426575
