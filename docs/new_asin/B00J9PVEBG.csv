8649093,5,B00J9PVEBG,"Directed by and starring TV personality Pierfrancesco Diliberto (Pif), the mix of comedy, childhood reminiscence and documentary reconstruction of Mafia killings in Palermo during the 1970s seems like an unusual mix, but The Mafia Kills Only In Summer would go on to win several film awards and be developed subsequently into a TV series.

There are two halves to the film, the first half dealing with the early childhood of Arturo (Alex Bisconti), his love for a new girl Flora, and his growing awareness as a child of the influence that the Mafia have over the everyday lives of the citizens of Palermo in Sicily.  The second half, stars the director Pif as Arturo, now a grown man aspiring to be a journalist, still dreaming of his true love Flora as she reappears in his life, and with the events that would eventually lead to the decline of the Mafia's stranglehold over the city.

Both parts of the film have their own attractions.  The first half has some moments of childhood whimsy and comic overplaying, a bit like the cinema fixation of Cinema Paradiso, only for Arturo the fascination is an unusually strange devotion to the Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti.  The second half mixes romantic comedy with Arturo and Flora's involvement in politics and journalism, which presents some unlikely contrasts alongside the increase in violence and assassination by mafiosi under pressure from the authorities.

In the end it's those connections to what is happening in the real-world that succeed and validate the films approach.  It not only gives a real sense of what it means to have grown up in Sicily during those times, the strangeness of the times contributing to a strange view of the world for a young child, but it also manages to pay tribute to those who fought against the Mafia and paid for it with their lives.  The style might seem incongruous and exaggerated, but it seems a genuine response to the times and the people who lived through them, and - just as importantly - it has an easy approach that ensures that its message is able to reach out to a wide mainstream audience.",1517011200,,2104,4.792817679558011

8649095,3,B00J9PVEBG,"What gives this black comedy its blackness, and its punch, are the stills of real-life Mafia slayings, and the real-life footage of the funerals of Mafia victims, interspersed between the fictional scenes. There are real-life press clippings and, dotted around Palermo, real-life plaques commemorating the assassinations of judges and policemen - black deeds that blot what is essentially the story of two childhood sweethearts.
As a boy, Arturo (Alex Bisconti) falls in love with, and attempts to woo, his new classmate, Flora (Ginevra Antona), the daughter of a local bank manager. When Arturo asks his father for advice about love his father avoids the subject. Luckily for Arturo his question is answered, or so it seems, by the then Prime Minister of Italy Guilio Andreotti who, during a TV interview, describes how he proposed to his wife in a cemetery.
Thinking that Italy's most powerful politician is talking to him directly through the medium of the TV screen, Arturo becomes obsessed with Andreotti, to the point of collecting newspaper clippings about him, and to the point of dressing up as his hero for a fancy dress competition.
The childhood scenes during the first half of the film are charming, but for me the charm (and the plot) falls flat after the roles of Arturo and Flora are eventually assumed by adult actors. Pif the TV clown is unconvincing as a romantic lead, and the foundation of the rekindled romance between Arturo and Flora is sketchy and implausible. But despite its shortcomings, this is still a movie worth watching. It's a good directorial debut by Pif. However, had he delegated the role of the grown-up Arturo to a serious actor, and had he spent more time on the second-half of the script, it could have been a great one.",1440806400,,1762,4.916107382550336

8649097,4,B00J9PVEBG,"Director/writer/actor Pif (Pierfrancesco Diliberto), a famous Italian television personality, brings his story he wrote with Michele Astori and Marco Martanito the screen with a terrific degree of freshness in dealing with a subject that has always been subterranean and dark - the Mafia of Palermo, Sicily. Working on what appears to be a tight budget as far as cast and crew are concerned Diliberto brings this little gem to life in a most memorable manner.

The story is based on facts  - but lightened with a fine sense of comedy that make the facts seem even more brutal: the dichotomy between the history and the comedic translation is intentional.  The story begins with the inception of Arturo (Diliberto once he has grown to a man) in an inventive marriage of computer generated graphic art and reality based activity. From birth through twenty years we follow Arturo as a child as he views the workings of the Mafia and that intuitive response or observation follows him through young life into the position of a young man deeply infatuated with his girlfriend Flora. The charm of Arturo's coming of age is balanced by the film's mocking Mafia Bosses and restoring the generosity of the heroes of the Anti-mafia. The period was a time of `see no evil/hear no evil' in Palermo, a city where denial was coupled with stifled tolerance, as the now infamous  war for Mafia supremacy filled the air (and the streets) was accompanied by regular assassinations of rival mobsters and anti-Mafia crusaders.

Despite the potentially grim subject, the film is paced (or laced) so gently that the overriding effect is about love in a time of chaos managed beautifully by Pierfrancesco Diliberto. It sparkles like the beauty of the waters surrounding Sicily. In Italian with English subtitles. Grady Harp, February 15",1424995200,2,1813,4.990066225165563
8649098,5,B00J9PVEBG,"This Italian film is actually a bit of a comedy despite it being about the Mafia, or the Cosa Nostra or whatever you want to call them. Arturo is a native of Palermo where he learns early on that nothing is ever what it seems to be in Sicily. He learns too that many things can get you killed and so goes out of his way to avoid trouble.

Then he meets and falls for Flora and his whole life changes - except his seeming adoration of premier Giulio Andreotti. We follow him as he grows up on the troubled streets of Palermo where the increasing violence of the Mafia finally makes the people react and say they have had enough. This is all set against the ongoing attempts by Arturo to get the attention of Flora.

This is one of those films that manages to put a great big smile on your face whilst at the same time teaching you a bit about Sicilian political history. The actors are all great and Arturo as a child is played by Alex Bisconti who was a delight and as an adult by Pif who combined charm with vulnerability perfectly. I absolutely loved this and my version came with the option for English sub titles. It does the deal with the murders and assassinations so is far from being a full on comedy. It was though an absolute corker that should get wider distribution so more people can appreciate this Italian gem.",1420243200,2,1325,4.296
