4392491,5,B004K4FUXY,"I should first note that despite Amazon's listing, these episodes are presented in widescreen, not a cropped full screen format, so no worries about that.

This second box set features 12 episodes from the third season of Pokemon DP, from Episode 16 ""The Lonely Snover"" to Episode 27: ""Evolving Strategies"". A lot happens in this set of episodes; Ash battles for his seventh badge, Dawn competes in another Pokemon Contest, the entire gang joins in on a ping-pong tournament, Frontier Brain Brandon from the Battle Frontier makes an appearance, Hunter J returns, and it's all capped off with a full six-on-six battle between Ash and Paul that is extended across two episodes.

The episodes themselves look quite good on my widescreen TV, and unless you make it a habit of watching television with your face three inches from the screen, you won't notice any artifacting or other errors. The discs only contain the episodes themselves; no extras or even any subtitle options are present, though there are thankfully logically placed chapter stops within each episode. It is a bit unfortunate that this box set reduces the number of episodes to 12 (previous sets held 17-19 episodes each), but it is most likely a side effect of the switch to the widescreen format.

Overall, an excellent set of episodes with a great presentation, even without extras. Perfect for the Pokemon fan in your life.",1306022400,9,1392,4.965665236051502
