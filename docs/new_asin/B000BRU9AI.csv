8091675,3,B000BRU9AI,"Dr. Jekyll doesn't appear until 35 minutes into the film and doesn't actually ""versus"" the werewolf, instead opting to try and cure him using his
grandfather's infamous formula.  However, things don't go as planned in more ways than one.  Despite its apparent truncation from 90 minutes or so to 75,
film is surprisingly coherent.  In fact, you could start viewing at 35 minutes when the action switches to England and not feel that you missed anything.  The method of cure sounds plausible within the framework of the film.  Of course, we're not
talking ""The Wolfman"" here.  The color is faded; image is along the lines of a 1970s UHF transmission but without the ""ghosts"", adding somewhat to the nostalgia
of viewing.  Opening titles are missing.  Worth seeing if you're a Naschy fan and
haven't seen it before or if you ever wanted to see what John Belushi would have been like in a horror film. Imagine what he could have done with the elevator scene!
Haven't watched Moon of the Wolf, having seen it when originally broadcast as a made for TV movie and not being overly impressed.",1305676800,3,1085,4.73404255319149
