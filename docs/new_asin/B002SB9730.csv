8379261,5,B002SB9730,"This is a great DVD for college kids to put on in their dorm rooms or at fraternity and sorority events.  The candles burn infinitely, and on the eighth night they burn down and out.  The singing is beautiful.  It's a good, kitschy gift for Chanukah.",1256169600,,250,4.391304347826087
8379262,5,B002SB9730,This DVD is perfect to put on at Chanukkah parties and get-togethers.  The music is absolutely beautiful - the Cantor has a lovely voice and it sounds great.  It is a good way to broadcast the lighting of the menorah!,1256169600,,217,4.4
