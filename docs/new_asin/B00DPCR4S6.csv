5840866,5,B00DPCR4S6,"I didn't really know what to expect when I started watching this series but as soon as Mrs Beasley showed up I knew I was hooked. The show is so well written and the chemistry between all of the actors is spot on. The funny snappy dialogue between Blake and his housekeeper always makes me smile and their background stories of life during and after the war are eye opening and add an emotional heft to the show which I love. Whoever does the costuming and set design for this show is genius as you immediately feel the small town Australia life in the late 50s. Blake and his housekeeper have lost much because of the war and to watch their evolving friendship is lovely. Thank you for offering a show centering on an older couple and the unconventional family they have created with their boarders and their coworkers. Craig M and Nadine Garner have obviously poured their hearts into these roles and it shows. As Blake would say ""Bravo"".",1505520000,,940,4.535294117647059
5840867,4,B00DPCR4S6,Very interesting show which caught me surprise my preconceived . This episode was totally beyond my pre-conceived impression of what to expect. However I found it very enjoyable. Highly recommended.,1505347200,,198,5.633333333333334

5840869,5,B00DPCR4S6,"Fantastic series! Everything about it is top notch. So glad it was recommended to me. After binge viewing, I can now recommend it to others. I am also glad that I own a multi-region DVD player so I could purchase and watch Season Four with no problem. Also, another Aussie series to recommend is Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries. I totally liked that one as well.",1502928000,,361,4.569230769230769

5840871,3,B00DPCR4S6,"Likes: interesting plot lines & characters. Good direction & cinematography. No gore, am sick of gory murders. No bizarre sex crimes, sick of that too.  I like the Australian setting.  Characters Charlie Davis is interesting (more so than Dr. Blake, to me) as is Mattie O'Brien. I like the time period.

Didn't like so much: Dr. Blake's overly self-assured (nearly egotistical) personality. He endlessly goes against his commanding officers' instructions not just behind the scenes but right in their face with smart alecky smugness. He is fluent in Chinese (writing & speaking). Of course, since he is so much smarter than everyone. Something about this character just annoys me.

I prefer Brokenwood Mysteries. More real characters in that one.",1502409600,,746,5.243697478991597

5840876,5,B00DPCR4S6,"Not like American crime-solving TV shows.  This focuses more on character development and not chases and frequent life-or-death circumstances to see how the ""star"" will survive.  A slower pace that some may not like, but I enjoy the emphasis on the characters in place of harrowing action experiences.",1498435200,3,301,5.25

5840878,5,B00DPCR4S6,"This is a great start to an amazing and entertaining series. Craig McLachlan and Nadine Garner shine, as do the other cast members. I highly recommend it. You'll be hooked. Since ABC Australia is no longer going to make the series, a fan group has created a petition to save this excellent, beloved series. Currently there are more than 14,000 signatures.

5840879,5,B00DPCR4S6,My husband and I like this series very much and gave Season One to our daughter.  We look forward to the latest season on public television.,1498003200,,140,4.384615384615385
5840880,5,B00DPCR4S6,"Imagine, a small town, located in the USA. There, in an average home, a television/computer is broadcasting a show based on a small town, Ballarat, located in Australia. A town, much like anyone might choose to settle in to raise a family amidst the trials of everyday life. Set in an era, which gave the world a chance for a new start. Death, murders, yes! Relationships, drama, life changing events all filmed and portrayed with an eye for detail to the era. The Doctor Blake Mysteries drew me in like those of the grand lady, Agatha Christie, whose works set the standard to period mystery dramas. With each episode, I found myself to be not only a viewer, but, a participant in solving the mysteries. I felt to be a part of the good doctor's household, or a member of the town observing and anticipating the events as they unfolded. Each portrayal of the wonderful characters gives one the sense of belonging. Each episode challenges the mind and the hearts of its viewers. It seems I find myself in the company of others who would love to see this show continue. Like so many, I would humbly ask, you reconsider the demise of, Dr. Blake Mysteries. Far too seldom, does a show come along that unites the hearts and minds of people from all over the world... Although my voice is one, combined with many, I do hope, the powers that be will give our thoughts, consideration. Whatever the future holds for this show, I enjoyed every moment I escaped, to the town of Ballarat, with the good doctor and the residents!  Respectfully, D Roberts  (Currently, there are 4 series/seasons aired with a 5th season and a mini movie in production ending this wonderful period drama. By all reports, the cast/crew and creators were/are willing to continue this show if a new home can be found. Save The Doctor Blake Mysteries on Facebook, has global members joined in the effort to help achieve this goal.)",1498003200,,1895,4.6537313432835825

5840892,4,B00DPCR4S6,"I really enjoy this series.  I didn't find the performances wooden as some have said; nevertheless I understand the levy of the criticism.  As with most series such as these, you either connect and like the characters/stories depending on your entertainment sensibilities.  Always best to rent before buying to see how this melds with yours; so it is worth a look.",1492387200,,364,4.934426229508197

5840894,4,B00DPCR4S6,"I just recently binge watched this show because I use to live in Victoria and I loved visiting Ballarat and Bendigo.  A lot of the faces are familiar because there is a large Italian and Greek population in Victoria and many of the actors resemble them.  I remember my two uncles were POW's and the horrendous treatment by the Japanese to many of the people in the south pacific.  I love the show for this reason, the accents, scenery, and the familiar connection I feel having lived in Australia for over 20 years.",1491955200,,515,4.516129032258065
5840895,1,B00DPCR4S6,"This is the Australian attempt at Midsomer Murders/ Poirot/ Morse and the like. However, it lacks the depth, nuance and character of the aforementioned. The acting is mediocre (especially the lead) is wooden at best. his expressions see saw between angry or stoic and waves his arms about for no earthly reason. He drinks on the job (ala Morse without the background) and comes across as a wannabe detective who is stuck playing a doctor. He offers lodging and boarding, and  defying authority, solves murders with his little coterie. Here is a poor attempt at trying to create something that could have had depth and nuance and yet fails at every step. I'm amazed that this show ran for 5 seasons!!!",1491955200,,700,4.785123966942149
5840896,3,B00DPCR4S6,"I thought I'd like this Aussie series so much more than I did.  Decent acting, sets, and writing, but just so slow-moving.",1491264000,,122,4.545454545454546
5840897,5,B00DPCR4S6,"Great series, but it surprises me that it's supposed to be set in 1959 ... the clothing, hair styles, cars, all look more like 194.9",1491091200,,132,4.32

5840903,5,B00DPCR4S6,Fantastic acting and an ongoing plot within a plot keeps you guessing - you just want the main characters to fall in love and for Dr. Blake to find happiness... which he will find as he solves pretty ingenious crimes.,1488672000,2,217,4.45

5840908,5,B00DPCR4S6,I luv BBC English crime. It is so different from the USA crime shows. You have to think more with the British shows. And you have to listen more because the accents sometimes get thick but that is another reason I like the shows.,1486598400,,229,4.2272727272727275

5840912,1,B00DPCR4S6,"1.0 out of 5 stars Another non-mystery

This could have been good.
A lot of effort went into it.
But as is so common with so many stories as told these days,
there is no mystery.
Characters are presented as types, and the member of the hated class is guilty.
Thus, we see early the rich woman. She is rude, and thinks herself superior to the lower classes.
So you know immediately that she is guilty.
And of course, she is.
She killed the lower class girl for having the gall to not know that she was from an inferior class.
Thus she must die.

All the standard pieces of classical mysteries are presented, but are really meaningless.
All deductions lead inevitably to the class enemy.

The real mystery is, how does this happen ?
Is it Orwellian groupthink ?",1485561600,,759,4.4071428571428575
5840913,2,B00DPCR4S6,"I cannot fathom why this show is popular. It is a really poorly done show. The lead actor is as wooden as they come. The actors who play other parts often seem miscast in their roles. To compound the problems with this show, the producers make changes to the cast with no explanation of why or what has happened to the characters they play.  And, on top of all that, the background music is really unpleasant.",1484956800,,409,4.381578947368421
5840914,5,B00DPCR4S6,"Doctor Blake is so human and flawed which makes this much more interesting to watch. He bumbles and is a do-gooder, but doesn't realize the consequences of his choices until it is too late. He drinks too much to ever wish him to be based on a real doctor, that would be scary. You just want to hug him and tell him things will work out. Love all of the actors in this- some of them are familiar from other ABC productions.",1484611200,3,422,4.158536585365853

5840922,4,B00DPCR4S6,"Doctor Blake is not just a mystery.  The stories are really about Doctor Blake himself.  And that can be refreshing in some ways as it really is more of a drama than a mystery.  Blake is clearly a flawed man and he is struggling to find his way in a world left shattered by World War II.  He alienates old friends, steps on toes, and makes a mess of things more often than not.  But this is what we are really watching.  There are two complaints about the show.  First, sometimes the mystery makes almost no sense.  More than once my wife and I looked at each other at the end of a show and said, ""That guy/woman was the killer!!!  Really???  Huh???""  The second complaint is that the show is politically correct and ""liberal"" minded.  A couple times I said to my wife, ""yeah, that is how they talk about XYZ now, but no one was saying that in the 1950s.  It feels a bit anachronistic in that way.  So if you are looking for a tightly packed mystery full of great clues, this is not your show.  If you want to watch a drama about an Aussie doctor dealing with his internal demons, you should like this.",1481500800,8,1102,4.205741626794258

There was a little delay in understanding the relationships among the characters at first, but it became clear as we went along.  This is an engaging story of a good, essentially nice man, who wrestles with his past by drinking too much and offending people who shouldn't be offended, but there is a great potential for the character to grow and develop.  Dr. Blake exhibits an almost intuitive grasp of how a crime was committed, reading the evidence and imagining how it was produced.",1476921600,3,636,4.702702702702703

The supporting characters are well cast - Jean as his housekeeper is so ladylike but so strong - the police chief if wonderful and second in command is great.  The stories are well written and acted and I'm looking forward to getting season two!,1471046400,4,402,4.2631578947368425

He completely dismissed the fact that a poor orphan girl found a home as the housekeeper of the priest and had a family through the church....geez, that was God taking care of her! Anyway, I'm not a big fan of the Roman Catholic Church, but ""dissing"" God in that way was over the top.

5840991,5,B00DPCR4S6,"I will be posting the same comments for each series. One of the advantages of having a multi-region DVD player is being able to watch programs from all over the world; hence, I get to watch Dr. Blake (Craig McLachian). The series is set in 1950's Australia in the town of Ballarat. Having served his turn in the army as a doctor assigned to the British hospital in Singapore, Blake was witness to atrocities, served time in a POW camp, and lost both his Asian wife (died) and daughter (orphanage). There are hints he also worked for British Intelligence; but now he has returned home, taken up his father's practice, and serves as the police surgeon (medical examiner). With his curious nature, he quickly finds himself working as amateur detective. While he has a somewhat combative relationship with boyhood friend. now Chief Supt,. Matthew Lawson (Joel Tobeck), they generally find themselves working together to sort out the crimes and catch the criminal.

During the first season, Blake had an ally in Constable Daniel Parks (Rick Donald); in the second season that position is taken by Senior Constable Charlie Davis (Charlie Cousins). Then there is additional support from his insightful housekeeper Jean Beazley (Nadine Garner) ; lodger and district nurse Mattie O'Brien (Cate Wolfe) ; and assist. ME Alice Harvey (Belinda McClory).

Ballarat seems to be the Australian equivalent of Cabot Cove, Maine in that it has a pretty murderous population. One of the things I enjoy about the series is the development and growth of the principal cast members. We learn a little more about each with every new episode. The mysteries are pretty good but the setting is somewhat limited to the obviously historical buildings available. This is not any real distraction but rather gives the series a feeling of reality.

Dr. Blake is somewhat a character of flaws which we are given to understand are a result of his war years. He drinks too much, jumps to the occasional wrong conclusion too quickly, and can rub the town's important people the wrong way which can have consequences for both himself and his friends. Indeed at the end of season two Chief Supt. Matthew Lawson is sent off for ""political"" reasons and is replaced by Acting Supt. Doug Ashby, who clearly has no admiration or respect for his Medical Examiner.

There is a lot to like with this series and I look forward to watching series three which I have ordered from Australia, and I understand a fourth series has been commissioned.",1445817600,5,2497,4.8959810874704495

5840997,5,B00DPCR4S6,"4 1/2 STARS  ---- AN OUTSANDING SERIES THAT STARTS SIMPLE AND GAINS COMPLEXITY AS IT PROGRESSES.  IT IS AS MUCH THE MYSTERY THAT IS  DOCTOR BLAKE AS IT IS ABOUT THE MYSTERIES DR BLAKE SOLVE'S.  ---- (SDH SUBTITLES)

This fictional murder mystery series is set in 1959 Ballarat, Australia.  The name Ballarat won't mean much to most Americans, but it is significant as the epicenter of the Victorian Gold Rush and cradle of democracy in Australia (Eureka Rebellion).  It is famous for it's preservation of Victorian architecture and the third most populous area in the state of Victoria.  Understanding this little bit helps put context to both the conservative and progressive characters, along with the former gold rush setting.  Dr. Lucien Blake is decidedly progressive in contrast to his very conservative colleagues.  Dr. Blake battles the demons of his past and the memory of his esteemed father, also a doctor.  Lucien is brilliant but brash.  As he often saves individual lives, there is always the question lingering, can someone save him from himself.  The first episodes start very simple.  I admit after the first episode I was intrigued, but concerned.  However, I let the story build and the characters deepen.  I was utterly rewarded.  In fact, the rich characters are really the strength of this production.  The filming was beautiful, done in a greyish tone against vivid colors that gave a very nostalgic feel.  The period detail was absolutely wonderful!

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  As I mentioned, the symbolism of the story being told in Ballarat will not register with most American viewers.  However, the Gold Rush past does pay a role in at least one episode.  The story begins after Dr. Lucien Blake has returned home and assumed his deceased father's medical practice.  Ballarat had been in a state of decline since before WWI and at least one character questions why he would come back considering his skills.  In addition to the medical practice, he also serves as the ""Police Surgeon"" who is similar to an on scene medical forensics specialist.  His father served in that role also and several characters lament how much easier things were then.  Though he is certainly respected, he is in frequent conflict with Superintendent Lawson and the coroner because he sees details they do not and he is not particularly diplomatic with them.  We learn that he was previously a Japanese prisoner of war from the fall of Singapore in WWII and that he lost his wife and daughter during that event.  He continues to search for them throughout season one.  This causes a form of conflict between him and Jean Beazley, housekeeper to him and his father before him.  She also lost her husband in the war, but lives in his house.  The romantic tension is subtle, but present as she cares for him and attempts to help him.  She is a tough lady who gives as good as Lucien can dish out.  Rounding out his makeshift family is Jean's nephew Danny Parks who is also a constable Lucien works with, and the young Mattie O'Brien who is the District Nurse for Ballarat and a border in Dr. Blake's home.  He has a very close father-like relationship with both Mattie and Danny, they also have grown to be like siblings.  However, Mattie and Danny also clearly have romantic tension they can't seem to acknowledge as they deal with their own romantic interests.  As the episodes progress, the mysteries typically become more complex and the individual characters become more defined.  Dr. Blake's own secrets and demons are revealed in bits and scraps.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  This is designed as a slightly more natural feeling murder mystery series, though there is a murder every episode of course!  It's not as flamboyant or whimsical as another very excellent Australian production&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miss-Fisher-s-Murder-Mysteries-1-Blu-ray/dp/B00A27OE94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries 1 [Blu-ray</a>].  It's also not as sensational or heart poundingly paced as some American police procedurals.  However, for those who like the style, similar to BBC, this is part of the charm  (it says BBC on the box for distribution but this is an Australian production of course).  I found the period very atmospheric, the investigations are increasingly involving and the over all story arcs really tie it together while humanizing the characters.  Season two has already aired overseas and a third season is authorized.  So if you get into it, there is plenty more to come.",1430611200,67,4548,5.108548168249661

5841000,5,B00DPCR4S6,"1959, Ballaret, Australia. It was founded in a gold rush and has grown into a respectable small city. It has its own hospital, a police force led by Chief Superintendent Matthew Lawson, and a Police Surgeon by the name of Dr. Lucien Blake.

Ballaret may be respectable, but it has a lot of murders. The police force isn't incompetent, but without Dr. Blake sticking his nose in they would not have the success rate they do. Blake's inquisitiveness is often not appreciated, a hallmark of the series. This is partly Blake's own fault. He has his own demons, he sometimes tries to drown them in drink, and he frequently gets in people's faces with bald truths not welcome. There is comedy in ""The Doctor Blake Mysteries"", but overall it is a period amateur detective working within a police procedural. Once in a while it seems a little unrealistic, like when the good doctor breaks & enters. On the other hand, Blake is a deeply unhappy man, and, to a certain extent, he doesn't care enough about his own life to worry about the consequences of breaking the rules. Little by little, we learn more about him as we watch the series.

Season One has 10 episodes, and corresponds to the Australian Series 1, which aired February/March 2013. Series 2, with another 10 episodes, aired in 2014 and Series 3 started airing in February 2015.

With the Region 1 DVD set, you get 3 discs. The 10 episodes total 574 minutes of great viewing, presented in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen and stereo sound. English subtitles are available. There are no bonus extras on this set, which is always a shame with a show set in a prior period. Incidentally, the Doctor Blake TV series is an original TV series and not based on any book series or characters.

Episode 1... ""Still Waters"" Lucien Blake carries an oil painting into The Colonists' Club and sets it up over the bar. It is a beautiful modern painting, a reclining nude woman, her back to the viewer, on a vivid red background. You can tell by Blake's half-smile that he is expecting trouble and looking forward to it. Sure enough, Patrick Tyneman, who owns half the town, strides in and orders, ""Get. It. Down.""
Blake: ""The painting stays.""
Tyneman: ""Too far this time. THAT is offensive.""
""You don't like it?""
""Of course I don't like it. THIS is a gentleman's club.""
""And that's the problem."" Blake tells the assembled crowd that the object of controversy was painted by a woman.
Tyneman: ""This was painted by a woman?""
Blake: ""Yes! Just think - you'll have to let them join one day.""
So in the very first scene we see that Blake is a rebel and his liberal tendencies do not always endear him.
Meanwhile, on an empty dark street, a woman pedestrian is arguing with the driver of a car. She emphasizes her point by pounding on the car door and then walking away. Which is when the car runs her down.
In this first episode we learn a little about Lucien. ""The war made a mess of him."" He came back from WWII to take over his father's practice, and is continually compared to him: ""I'm not my father."" He even reads banned books!

Episode 2... ""The Greater Good"" A doctor and nurse, looking for a quiet place to smooch, find the body of Bill Prentice, mortuary assistant, on the morgue floor. The Superintendent is more than willing to put it down as an accident because he has more than this body to worry about: ""Brass coming in from all over the place for ANZAC Day. The army's on my back, two soldiers have buggered off from the base in South Australia. Official bloody Secrecy Act.""
So Blake does some sleuthing on his own. As he demonstrates to District Nurse Mattie O'Brien: ""It's called luminol. It picks up traces of iron. Invented last century, used to locate iron ore. The Nazis worked out they could also use it to detect the presence of blood.""

Episode 3... ""Death of a Travelling Salesman"" Constable Daniel Parks (nephew to Jean Beazley, Blake's housekeeper) is directing traffic around some road construction. A car comes down the hill towards the construction weaving from one side of the road to the other. It plows right through, barely missing Danny before coming to a stop. More strange, when Danny gets the car door open, the driver is dead, his face turned blue, with a bunch of vacuum cleaners in the back seat.

Episode 4... ""Brotherly Love"" It's a police stand-off at a modest house in Ballaret. Young Sean McBride exits the front door waving a pistol: ""I can see you there, coppers. I've already shot one of your mates. Now come and get me."" He fires a shot into the air and return fire injures him. It doesn't make sense. Suicide by cop?
Move to 13 months later, and Sean is due to be executed the next morning, found guilty of murdering a policeman. Leave it to Dr. Blake to think he didn't do it.

Episode 5... ""Hearts and Flowers"" Welcome to the Grand Opening of Ballaret's 7th Annual Begonia Festival. Unfortunately, it's marred by an altercation between two warring families. Late that night, a man in a trenchcoat - we can never see his face clearly - sets fire to a greenhouse. Blake is called out to the site the next morning, because a half-burned body is found inside the greenhouse ruin. It's Professor Ormond, one of the Festival judges. Aside from trying to solve the murder, Blake is pressed to take Ormond's place as judge. When he knows nothing about begonias.

Episode 6... ""If the Shoe Fits"" At Patrick Tyneman's shoe factory (I told you he owned half the town), the foreman and the manager are having an argument. Later that night, after closing time, the foreman is found dead, bled to death after catching his arm in a machine. Nobody seems sorry he's dead, especially the immigrants working the floor. For one thing, as Mirostar Gorski tells Blake, the foreman ""has been taking 10% of all our wages for months."" And worse. This is one of those mysteries where the victim is so vile, you hope the killer is never caught. How we take workers' rights for granted now.

Episode 7... ""Bedlam"" At the Black Hill Psychiatric Hospital, David Hoyle won't take his medicine from nurse Violet Ashby: ""No! I don't want it from you."" What does he mean by that? Because later that night, he is found in the bathroom holding a bloody kitchen knife, with the very dead Ashby lying near him on the tiled floor. Fortunately for David, Blake is there to look beyond the obvious.

Episode 8... ""Game of Champions"" Everyone in the Blake household gathers in front of the TV. On-the-air ""Live from Ballaret Studios BTV Channel 8 and Tyneman Electrics, we're proud to present 'Game of Champions': The quiz show where only the smartest survive. And now, please welcome the stars of the show, Alan and Verity Coleman."" It's the championship round. The longest-running champion, Simon Lo, against the new challenger, James Holbrook.
The champion loses! All hail the new champion. It looks like Lo is not a good loser. He accosts the Colemans back stage: ""This isn't fair. You made me lose!"" Before they can respond, everyone is startled by screaming from upstairs, from where Lo just came. The new champion is dead and racism raises its ugly head.

Episode 9... ""All That Glitters"" Darts at the pub, and Blake is interrupted by Jack, who asks him, ""I just wondered if you'd had any more thoughts about tomorrow night.""
Blake's reply is simple, ""No.""
Jack: ""You and the Consul both saw action on the Malay Peninsula during the war. The Board naturally thought you'd like to introduce him.""
Blake: ""Please don't take this the wrong way, Jack. I'd rather have typhoid."" Blake gives the impression that he's refusing because he doesn't like public speaking. But it's deeper than that, as everyone finds out when the very drunk Blake crashes the presentation, insults the Consul and socks the Superintendent.
Very close to being fired, Blake has another matter on his mind, the murder of a young gold miner. A miner who had such baby-smooth hands that it's a given he never actually dug up the nugget he showed off at the pub.

Episode 10... ""Someone's Son, Someone's Daughter"" Everything stops in Australia when the Melbourne Cup runs every year on the 1st Tuesday in November. At the hospital, there's a little party going on, as the staff, including Mattie, gather round the radio to listen. Listeners include Hazel Mahoney, the first woman surgeon in Ballaret, and Geoffrey Nicholson, hospital administrator who hates her ambition - given that she's just a woman. When Mahoney is found hung in the dormitory later that night, Blake realizes the suicide was staged. What is going on at the Ballaret Military Hospital?

Trivia: Dr Blake drives his father's car, a 1930's Coventry Standard. The Standard Motor Company Limited was a motor vehicle manufacturer, founded in Coventry, England in 1903.

Recommended mystery series.

If you'd like an Australian mystery series that is more light-hearted, I can highly recommend this very cute series. Unfortunately, it sounds like there will be no series 2, so this is all we'll get:

5841004,3,B00DPCR4S6,"Please disregard this rating.  Unfortunately I have not been able to watch the series.  Apparently I did not pay attention when I ordered it (or else it may not have been explained) but it is designated as ""REGION CODE: 2"" and will not play on any equipment in this area.  Perhaps it is for European systems--I haven't researched the problem yet.  Unfortunately I cracked the case slightly when I opened it so did not feel I could request an exchange.  I just thought you should know for your information.  I didn't contact Movie Mars either since I assumed I was responsible.  Thanks.",1420243200,8,585,4.676470588235294

So far, I have watched two excellent series. This is one of them. I am eagerly awaiting Series 2 which is for sale in Australia but already sold out and back-ordered. It is not yet available from this vendor. Matters not to me whether the Series 2 DVD becomes available as Region 4 or Region 2. I can play both now. I was pleased with the service from this seller and am ready to purchase again from this seller as soon as they make it known that Series 2 is available.",1410480000,16,615,4.176470588235294
5841006,4,B00DPCR4S6,"Always delighted to watch Aussie drama. And such a breath of freshness. Comparing with British and American tv, Aussie dramas seem to be very liberal with language use ;)I don't see why not, that's how real people talk, most speakers aren't pruds or saints are we.
Brilliant acting and script- can't wait to get S 2-4 on dvds!",1409788800,4,326,4.637931034482759

5841008,5,B00DPCR4S6,"Dr. Blake is sociable on his own terms, a concerned and excellent physician, and a brilliant seeker of truth.  He cannot let go of a case if he senses something is wrong, and has to get to the bottom of it, regardless of police obstruction  He has his own personal problems (disappearance of beloved wife and daughter) and he drinks a bit - well maybe more than a bit - too much off the job, but he still thinks a mystery through and has some novel ways of arriving at a conclusion.  Not much of today's forensic marvels available to him, but he improvises and achieves success.  More congenial than D. I. Richard Poole (Death in Paradise), less antisocial than Dr. House and just as analytical as Inspector Lewis.  I loved this series, never seen it before, but am looking forward to Series 2. It deserves a lot more good press than it has gotten.",1399593600,35,848,4.445161290322581
