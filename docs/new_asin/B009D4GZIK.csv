5317375,5,B009D4GZIK,The Tape was very good for my Grand Kids.  it is easy to follow.,1414540800,,64,3.5714285714285716
5317376,5,B009D4GZIK,"Beautiful art in the illustrations.  I appreciated the length of the Bible story about David.  It started with the Israelites wanting a king, then Saul, then Samuel anointing David, etc, not only the David and Goliath chapter.  The story read aloud is not actual Bible verses but was Biblically sound.  Keep your Bible app handy - my kids insisted on looking up David to see if he really had red hair as described in this video.  The ESV, NASB and KJV say ""ruddy"" and must be where this story got the reference for a red-haired David.",1411084800,,534,4.520833333333333
5317377,4,B009D4GZIK,I am a sunday School teacher for 5 year olds and they wouldn't sit quiet for this.  Not gear for little kids.,1407715200,,109,3.9545454545454546
5317378,5,B009D4GZIK,Well done!  I felt like I was right there in the story.  This story is a faith booster to trust the Lord's strength and not our own.,1398816000,,132,3.8518518518518516
5317379,5,B009D4GZIK,"We first heard this on the radio many years ago, and were astounded.  Mel Gibson just did an amazing job.  While the illustrations in the video and/or book are nice, we found that simply listening and using your own imagination was the superior way to experience it.  Can't beat your own mental images.  Goose bumps!!  Get it and ""see"" what we mean.",1398729600,,349,4.564516129032258
5317380,5,B009D4GZIK,"This video is very well narrated and suspenseful.  I was at first skeptical of its quality as I played for my kids to keep them busy for a little bit, but as the story unfolded I became captivated myself and joined them.  Very well done.",1385078400,,237,4.2444444444444445
5317381,5,B009D4GZIK,"This is a wonderful show for children, it tells the story right from the Bible.  The music is very relaxing and the illustrations are beautiful and captivating.  My children watch a lot of the Veggie Tales, and this is a good addition since it tells the story and doesn't make it quite so silly.",1364947200,2,295,4.444444444444445
5317382,5,B009D4GZIK,So biblical and fun learning and enjoyment for my precious boys to watch. Thank you for having this special show available.,1358899200,,123,4.904761904761905
8540006,4,B009D4GZIK,"With voice overs by Mel Gibson this shares the story of the Children of Israel who wanted to have a king as the surrounding people did. God gives them what they want and King Saul is anointed. The best of men are men at best and he is that. Soon David is selected to be the next king. A giant challenges any comers in a one-on-one battle. David is bothered by the challenge, he tells Saul he has killed wild animals taking care of sheep so Saul sends his best wishes and David heads out to battle with his sling shot. Presented in cartoonish still images.",1511827200,,555,4.245283018867925
8540007,5,B009D4GZIK,"The story stops just before he cuts off Goliath's head, so I guess that makes it OK for children.",1479600000,,97,4.157894736842105

8540012,4,B009D4GZIK,Interesting. ...I thought this would be a low budget cartoon that would basically be a waste of time but if you have young children this was really well done.  It may have been a low budget project but it is surprising how Mel Gibsons narration holds your attention and tells the story in a captivating way.  Very well done...,1430956800,3,326,4.508474576271187

8540015,5,B009D4GZIK,"Excellently written and narrated.  Beautiful illustrations and soundtrack.  This is one of my favorite Old Testament stories--was afraid I would be disappointed in this retelling, but instead was pleasantly surprised at how well this production was done.  Have saved it to my Amazon watchlist and will show it to my parents the next time they visit.",1423180800,,349,5.196428571428571
