8285168,4,B001BXTQ2S,"Interesting documentary on Lizzie Borden & her infamous arrest & trial for murder of her father & step-mother.  I am fascinated by the ""Fall River Tragedy"" so I have read innumerable books on the subject. Biography Channel's DVD was good but there were no new theories or suspects offered, just a re-hash of what we already know.",1414713600,,329,4.771929824561403
