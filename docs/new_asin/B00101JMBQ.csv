8236483,1,B00101JMBQ,Two copies were sent to me.............both were rubbish as they stopped at 26 minutes. You then had to fast forward to get it to work again. Their customer service was courteous but the product is rubbish. I cannot believe that I have to award 1 star.,1508803200,,252,4.5
8236484,5,B00101JMBQ,"Exceptional quality print of genuine wartime footage, a rare chance to own a copy of this classic WWII USAAF film.",1374624000,,114,4.75
8236485,4,B00101JMBQ,"This documentary not only shows how the Army Air Forces did their jobs in the air war against Germany, it shows how the Army used movies to instruct their personnel on the realities of operations.  It's not as flashy as a newsreel or the more famous color films THE MEMPHIS BELLE or THUNDERBOLT (which were both for civilian consumption), and unfortunately a lot of the sound was dubbed in after the fact.  But that also tells how genuine this film is.

From orders, to planning, to briefing, to execution, each aspect of the mission is covered in detail. There isn't any focus on individuals--it's all about the overall effort.

The main unit the combat photographers worked with was the 56th Fighter Group, better known as the Wolfpack.  They had a particularly good mission that day, and some of their gun camera footage shows up here, as well as good footage of their planes.",1353283200,,879,4.718954248366013
8236486,5,B00101JMBQ,This is a good story about WW2 B-17 Bomber Fighter escorts.  It is very well done and gives a good view of what it's like to go on a mission with real footage used.  I found it very interesting because my Uncle was a bomber pilot that they escourted on that mission.,1210809600,,266,4.096153846153846
