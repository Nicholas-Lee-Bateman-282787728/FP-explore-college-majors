7881897,4,6305064504,"This video showcases the comedic talents of Rodney Dangerfield.  As in ""Caddyshack"" he specializes in wreaking havoc on the golf course.  He and his buxom, blonde girlfriend play a round of golf in an exclusive country club with a stuffy, middle-aged couple.  Rodney cracks inappropriate jokes, has a pizza delivered on the golf course, and sets up beach chairs in the sand trap.  By the end of the round of golf, the other couple have loosened up considerably.  This hilarious outing is followed by a couple of sketches from his old TV specials.
