2736195,5,B000MIMZ62,Night Visions is one of the most sexest movies I have seen. It was like I slipped through erotic history. I don't think there is another movie with as many babes. Stylish and sexy!,950486400,2,180,4.323529411764706
2736196,5,B000MIMZ62,"Just a quick note on ""Night Visions"" It was like a peek into the history of erotica. From primal woman and Egyptian woman, Greek goddeses and Medevil sex witches right through to the roaring 20's and the swinging  sixties, I thought it was extremely sexy and erotic.",950054400,,266,4.659574468085107
2736197,5,B000MIMZ62,"""Night Visions"" is not only a very sexy film but also a film that has a very unique look. It's as if we are looking back into the past at all these beautiful women through stained glass. Beautifully depicted.  This is one of the few erotic movies I have seen that have something to say  about the history of men and women and the history of erotica. I thought  the section on the 1920's women was fantastic and I also thought Julie  Strain looked better than ever as  a Greek Goddess. Night Visions, a nice  surprise!  And very very sexy!",949968000,2,538,4.32
2736198,5,B000MIMZ62,Night Visions is one of the more interesting erotic films to come along in quite awhile. I found the many many women beautiful and each story set in a particular time zone was fascinating. Especially the Greek goddess (Julie  Strain) and the Egyptian and Medevil segments. This movie has a erotic  dreamy look about it which I found very sexy and erotic.,949708800,,354,4.693548387096774
2736199,5,B000MIMZ62,"I have seen many erotic films in my day and I must say that ""Night Visions"" is one of the best. Not only does it have an interesting story and look, it also has a large selection of beautiful women shown in  different parts of history. And if you are a Julie Strain fan. This is a  must see!  I loved it!",949622400,3,304,3.870967741935484
2736200,5,B000MIMZ62,night visions is one of the sexest pictures I have seen in years. Not only did it have a fine array of girls. I think there must have been over 20 gorgeous women in it. But it also had a distinctive look about it and a  sense of women through time from primal woman through modern woman. And  Julie Strain as the Greek Goddess knocked me out. One of the most sexist  films I have seen. Especially the 1920's girls and the French section. It  was like being lost in an erotic dream.,949622400,2,481,4.139784946236559
8169339,5,B000MIMZ62,I loved this show while it was on Scifi! I didn't get to watch all the episodes though before it was off so I always felt cheated. I would love to have it on DVD so I can watch the episodes I loved like the one with Jerry O'Connell where he was attacked by gypsies or the one where the girl is trapped within her own mind. PLEASE SELL THIS ON DVD!!!!,1384214400,2,350,3.875
8169340,4,B000MIMZ62,"I loved watching this as a kid. Defiantly pars up with Twilight Zone(at least the later seasons)and Amazing Stories(1985), Night Gallery(1969) Friday the 13th series(1987). Like these other reviews I also wish to buy a dvd of night visions but couldn't find it. Any way all the night visions episodes are on veehd.com . Veehd.com can be difficult at times like it was for me. To download or even watch the episodes you need to download the free divx software (google it) and use the google chrome browser. Enjoy!",1330819200,5,512,4.764044943820225
8169341,5,B000MIMZ62,"This was one of the most underrated shows that I can remember in a long time. I don't remember the show from Fox and came across it some years back on SciFi channel and fell in love with it. I've watched scary movies and these anthology style shows my entire life, so nothing really makes me take notice, especially anything relatively new but this show did! The episoded were well written, well acted, well directed, scary and never with a predictable ending.

I would love to see Warner Brothers to release this on DVD. If not Warner Brothers, another company, anyone. With the right marketing, they could really make some money.",1311897600,3,631,4.684684684684685
8169342,5,B000MIMZ62,i saw this on syfy tv channel and loved it they haven't aired it again and its been years! i would love to own this on dvd!,1308528000,6,123,3.5925925925925926
8169343,5,B000MIMZ62,"This is the best thriller anthology I have ever seen.  And you can't get it!
Please release this on DVD.",1279238400,9,104,4.2
8169344,5,B000MIMZ62,"I also loved this series and would definitely buy it if it became available on DVD. For anyone who would like to see this on DVD, you can go to [...] and vote for the series to be released. This shows the network that there is a following and a demand for the series.",1276041600,6,267,3.962962962962963
8169345,5,B000MIMZ62,"I have been trying to track this down for years. I saw most of the episodes on TV in Ireland. This series was breathtaking at the time; the script writing played off the viewers preconceptions that had been built up over time and viewing experience of other TV series.

(I don't have any facts to back this theory up; but, I suspect that the writers watched other Sci-fi and Drama shows and wrote their own versions with endings that they believed would occur in those circumstances.)

The series while sharing certain premises with the Twilight Zone and the Outer Limits was unique and I personally used to have that bitter aftertaste in my mouth after watching an episode. The whole thing could be summarised as ""you were warned something bad was going to happen, you didn't listen and something even worse than you could imagine happened"". This applied to the characters and the viewer equally.

The series was fresh and uncompromising and it never had a happy ever after ending. A missing masterpiece from my DVD collection and I want it. Please release this on DVD. If you remember this series add your own review only weight of numbers will get it on the shelves.",1253664000,13,1169,4.692682926829268
8169346,5,B000MIMZ62,"If theres anything I want more thatn ""The Hobbit"" being made into a movie, it's the release of this series on DVD - that's how bad I want it",1243209600,14,140,3.8620689655172415
8169347,5,B000MIMZ62,"Night Visions is perhaps the most truly frightening anthology series to ever air on network television, ever since its original run on FOX in the summer of 2001 it has earned the cult reputation of delivering some of the creepiest short segments since its predecessor (and distant cousin) ""Twilight Zone"".

It is currently airing on the 24/7 horror channel ""Chiller"" and watching these again reminded me of how essential and appreciated an official DVD release of the complete series would be.
