7935428,4,B00005ALR9,It's right down on moon shine liquor the way it could of been back in history yet it's also like a porno the car's are cool and now rare as well as collectibles,1480982400,2,160,3.878787878787879
7935429,1,B00005ALR9,"The tape I received was grainy, low quality (home-made)in appearance and my tape had not been completely erased (there was part of another movie at the end of Bad Georgia Road). This film was only about $8.00 plus shipping and the transaction was amazingly fast.  As for the film, it is typical 70's B style, lousy acting but a good escape for 90 minutes.",1129507200,3,355,4.546875
7935430,3,B00005ALR9,"If you like lowdown and trashy, this is the sordid sort of roadshowy fare that thrills to the gills!  Outrageous to the point of parody, marginally directed, and overacted, it's the kind of tobacco-roody crudity that tickles Southern funnybones and rattles Northern kneebones.  Waller away!",1053993600,6,290,5.4222222222222225
