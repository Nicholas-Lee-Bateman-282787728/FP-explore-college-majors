8146166,5,B000ILYYYY,"This is an inside look at what really goes on before and during an election.  I knew it took a lot of work, but never realized just how much.  The film was put together nicely so that is wasn't dull.  I'm so glad I purchased this film!",1344902400,,235,3.9574468085106385
8146167,5,B000ILYYYY,"A friend of mine told me about this film.  He went on for days (and days, and days) about how he could not believe that this film did not get more attention.  He was so adamant about it that he made several of his friends and family (including myself) watch it when it was shown on PBS. Wow. WOW.  I though it was going to be ""just another documentary"", but I was thoroughly shocked. Incredible. `Nuff said",1191456000,,406,4.246753246753247
8146168,5,B000ILYYYY,"BY THE PEOPLE is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.  It's funny, exciting, and illuminating. If you wonder if your vote means anything, if you care about the electoral process in America, see this strictly non-partisan film.  It should be required viewing for all citizens.",1191196800,2,286,4.9375
8146169,5,B000ILYYYY,"By the People opened my eyes to how chaotic the election process is in this country and how heavily it relies on volunteers to make it work.  I thought the film was fantastic both in how it involved its audience in the moment-by-moment decisions of running an election and in how it lets its inspiring, colorful characters lead us through the process.  I highly recommend this film!!!",1191196800,,384,4.7164179104477615
8146170,5,B000ILYYYY,I saw this at the Jackson Hole Film Festival and am so glad I saw it - it's the best inside look at what needs to be accomplished by a community in order to vote ... and how vulnerable the election process and results really are.  See this film and take action in your community - it's worth it.,1191024000,2,295,4.0
8146171,5,B000ILYYYY,"Almost all political movies show the ""political"" side of politics, which is so distant from most of us.  ""By the People,"" shows a view of politics as it really is.  Not glamorous, not exciting every minute, but a day to day carrying out of small tasks.  This is a movie about people -- real people -- whose job it is to make an election work.  It is a behind the scenes view of the elements that make it possible for each of us to have a say in our democracy.  You will not see Robert Redford in ""By the People,"" but you might see someone just like your next door neighbor.  A wonderful, interesting film.",1191024000,2,605,4.217391304347826
8146172,5,B000ILYYYY,This was one of the most amazing films I've ever seen.  We have never before been exposed to the world of voting in this way.  Watch this movie and you'll know EXACTLY why we all need to vote.  This movie should be shown is schools across America.,1191024000,,247,4.212765957446808
8146173,5,B000ILYYYY,this movie is unbelievable. extrememly informative. no wonder bush was able to steal the election when our polls are so horrendously undermanned. i have huge newfound admiration fo the pollsters- especially those folks in indianna who were able to pull off an honest clean program under such trying circumstances. great movie!!!,1191024000,,328,5.450980392156863
8146174,5,B000ILYYYY,"I enjoyed this documentary because it was so real.  It is like every election I have ever worked in Marion County, Indianapolis, Indiana.  I have heard from others that it is very close to the chaos they experience in their own eletions nationwide.  After viewing this you must wonder how in the world does an election ever get completed.  It also sends a very important message.  We must cherish our volunteer workers and continue to draw younger people to this very worthy mission.  We must not only set up a process to elect good people, but we must vote.  It is very hard to believe that in a nation such as ours there are so many people who want to complain about politicians and laws, but do not care enough to watch voting records and parties performances and get out and cast a valid ballot for their candidate of choice.

I encourage others to watch this movie and teachers to show it in classrooms, from Junior High School through College.  Good educational piece.  Thanks to all who participated.",1169078400,,1007,4.606741573033708
8146175,5,B000ILYYYY,"By The People clearly shows how much work is involved & how much humor you need to pull off an election anywhere. Doris Anne Sadler also shows how important it is to keep your cool when Murphy's Law rears it's head time and time again. This film will or should inspire everyone to not only vote, but to volunteer at least once in their city to be a part of the important election process.",1164153600,,388,4.256756756756757
