One of the last great pop culture items of the 90s was the amazing Weird TV that ran in 1995. It only ran for a season, and came on at 3 in the morning in my home town, but was still a not-to-miss show. My friends and I would stay up late with great anticipation every Saturday night.

Weird TV was like the late night TV of the late 70s and 80s. Random skits, serials, music videos, interviews, it was like Night Flight but weirder! Programs like Adult Swim of today are the closest thing we have to this sort of television, but they just don't have the same charm that Weird TV had. Adult Swim has its moments for sure, but it is trying to be like things like Weird TV, whereas Weird TV and Night Flight were what they were.

I had been searching for, and hoping for, Weird TV to be released on video or DVD ever since it first aired. Now, finally, thanks to Weird TV mastermind Chuck Cirino, the entire series it available on DVD. I recieved the first DVD recently and it is awesome. Great to see this stuff again. It has definately held the test of time.

The only flaw with the DVDs is a lack of chapter stops. You have to watch it straight through. Which kind of makes it feel more like late night TV or VHS. Which I guess is kind of cool in a way. Nonetheless, this is an amazing show that all weirdos NEED to see.",1299715200,2,1403,4.054151624548736
