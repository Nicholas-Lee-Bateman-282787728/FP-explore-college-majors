7601430,5,B01AHWLX2O,This Movie's release date has not happened yet.  There is not one review by the press online for it at this point.  Press are the first to have a crack at a movie.  Do not believe any reviews of this film until about December 13th.  It will be released to the general public (the people who write reviews on Amazon)on December 14th.  Sorry to break it to you.  Hope this helps.,1133222400,,377,4.23943661971831
7601431,5,B01AHWLX2O,I picked this Korean version for $14.90(that was with the shipping) from another site. The quality is top notch. The movie is spoken in english and it plays just fine here in America. It's good to see Kong again in all his glory !,1123372800,,230,4.25
7601432,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Wowsome Movie, Crystal Clear quality of Image and Sound!!! It blew me away!!!

I just saw this Korean Edition of King Kong and I looooooved it!!! I remember seeing the old version, years ago, but in no way had the impact it had this

time. What a beautiful story and watching it with that Crystal Clear quality of sound and image makes all the difference in the world!!! Plus this Korean DVD version includes previously unreleased scenes and a documentary ""the Making Of"" that as a Big Movie Fan I always enjoy and have a ball watching!!! I have to give this one a 5 stars. No Doubt about it!!! My advise: Get it and watch it. You WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. That is a promise. This movie rocks!!!",1122076800,8,695,4.37984496124031
7601433,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Normally I don't write reviews, but I just finished watching the KOREAN release of King Kong and I was so impressed with the quality of the picture, that I just had to let everyone interested, know about it.

There are so many imports of this movie being sold here that it gets confusing, I was lucky enough to receive the Korean version as a gift, and was very impressed with the quality of the image and sound. It's unbelievably crisp! It's so much fun to watch one of the greatest old time movies, specially if it has been cleaned and restored to this kind of quality. To top it off the Korean version comes with a 23 minute tell all documentary called ""The Making Of"", and previously unreleased restored footage is included in this version.

They don't make movies like this anymore, all break through special effects put a side, what a great plot! A horror movie and a love story all rolled into one. But I'm not going to waste time talking about the movie itself, I'm sure everyone is familiar with it, I just want to let everyone know that they will not be disappointed with the Korean Import it's OUTSTANDING!",1122076800,10,1117,4.497536945812808
7601434,5,B01AHWLX2O,"On the recommendation of friend, I splurged for the Japan 2-DVD set of ""King Kong"" and ""Son of Kong"".  I must admit, I was blown away by the quality of this package and promptness of shipping offered by the vendor (thanks zelachowski)!  The images are crisp and vivid unlike the previous VHS release I've watched over all these years.  And, all those scenes that were deleted from the original ""Kong"" are here too!  Two gorilla-sized thumbs up for this import double disc!",1121299200,3,472,4.719512195121951
7601435,5,B01AHWLX2O,"As a life-long horror/monster/sci-fi enthusiast, I would highly recommend this Japaneese two-disc set to any fellow genre fan reading this.  The images are really clear, not murky like the vhs and television version we've been accustomed to for years.  All the gorey (funny?) bits that were taken out years ago for 'moral' reasons are included.  With the addition of the also out-of-print 'Son of Kong' on the second disc, this unique package is well worth the investment, and a lot cheaper than an airline ticket to Tokyo in hopes of tracking it down!",1118880000,5,552,4.913978494623656

7601439,5,B01AHWLX2O,This is a faithful remake of the 1933 classic. Almost to the point that they tried way too hard. But a good film nonetheless.,1523318400,,125,4.25
7601440,2,B01AHWLX2O,"Many others have said it thoroughly already, so I'll just pitch in a short two-cents: This attempt at a re-tell is particularly pretentious and overreaching; characters and character relationships are entirely two-dimensional and even worse than what you might get in something more formulaic. Story line has little to no development; this movie is a flop of a caricature of something that should have been better. Hopefully someone will try again in another twenty years.",1522454400,,472,5.306666666666667
7601441,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Still a great film. Not as influential or good as the original, but the effects are amazing and Andy Serkis is one of cinemas most underrated performers. Give him an Oscar already!!",1522108800,,181,4.6875

7601443,4,B01AHWLX2O,"I like this movie more now than I did when it first came out. It's kind of a cheesy movie, but maybe since I've grown to accept that, I can enjoy it more. It's definitely overstuffed and could have been a little faster paced, but once Kong is in the movie, it gets really good. Excellent performance by Naomi Watts. The rest of the cast is actually better than I remembered.",1521676800,,374,4.28169014084507

I found this to be the biggest, most heart rending, tear jerking movie I've seen in years.  I think P.J.did an awesome job of getting to the real heart of the story.

7601466,5,B01AHWLX2O,I just watched this movie once again after being over 10 years from the first time and I had forgotten what a visual masterpiece this film is. I just read some of the one star reviews and those folks must have been high while watching this movie. For anyone not high on crack this movie is for you....,1515283200,2,301,4.206896551724138
7601467,5,B01AHWLX2O,"An excellent film, that stands on its own, despite the power of the original.  I found this film to be thoroughly entertaining.  Some people say it was too long, I didn't want it to end.  The visual effects alone were astounding.  But throw in all the incredible actors, the set pieces, wardrobe, scenery,...this movie deserves serious praise.  There are some complaints about the beginning dragging on.  I actually liked the beginning.  The whole depression era New York scenes with the period outfits and old model cars really solidified the era for me.  For an epic movie like this, you need a long set up to establish everything in the beginning and like said, It wasn't boring at all.  There's also a lot of opinions on Jack Black's performance.  As far as I'm concerned, not only do I feel that they chose the right man for the part, but also that he did an Oscar worthy job.  Its really mesmerizing.  If you watch him with an objective eye, he plays this part with fantastic finesse.  His facial expressions, body language and the delivery of his lines is spot on.  I am so used to seeing Jack Black in comedies, that its fun for me to see him use his skills to perfection, in this dramatic role.  I truly believe that he deserved a lot more credit for his performance.  His character really stood out.  This film should be on everyone's Blu-ray collection.",1515024000,2,1364,4.593360995850622
7601468,4,B01AHWLX2O,"The movie: It's good, but not great. If the running time was trimmed a bit (it takes an hour just to get to Skull Island) it'd be a better movie. Peter Jackson just doesn't know how to make 'em lean. But it's an interesting take on the Kong tale. I really like Kong and Naomi Watts is really good in this. I've never had much use for Adrien Brody, and Jack Black tries hard, but he's miscast.

As for the Blu-ray itself, it has a ton of special features and it was cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else.",1514851200,,502,4.122448979591836

7601489,3,B01AHWLX2O,"Carl Denham (Jack Black) is soon to be divested of hiss backing due to making too many cute movies and no love interest. Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) is out of work due to poor acting during the time of the great depression. The two cross paths just in time to catch the tramp steamer that will carry them to Singapore (yeah right). We are introduced to the other characters in the steamer that do not have a clue to what their future holds. We hear tales of an uncharted island that has a wall built so long ago that no one knows who built it or why.

Well done by today's standard. They stuck pretty close to the original plotline and even kept some of the key dialog in this version. Some of the characters may have changed vocations, yet the story still floes smoothly. In come ways it is an improvement over the original. However the reason this film is one hour longer than needed to tell the story is all the mindless fluff filler that made it drag on and on and on. Even the action scenes had so much action that you wanted to scream ""get on with it"" and ""let's get going.""

Kong himself did not look that proportioned; when he leaped he looked like the Hulk in a fur suit. And poor Ann looked really blurry when she was being swung around. Some parts of her body took time to catch up with the others.

They missed an opportunity in the credits to place the faces of the actors with the names. Fifty years from now all any one will remember is the version with Naomi Watts, whatever she looked like with whoever those other people were.",1506038400,,1541,4.27054794520548

7601505,5,B01AHWLX2O,"One of Jackson's best films by far, King Kong is definitely a movie I will add to my library. This film, aside from profanities and some insinuations, is one of the best I've seen in my life. The whole story draws you into the film, even though the story itself is over 80 years old. Jackson causes you to sympathize with King Kong and yet at the same time does not present a radically environmentalist position.

This film has much more depth, substance, and charm than 2017's Kong: Skull Island. Jackson's King Kong is the only King Kong in my book. Legendary and Warner Bros. are going to have to do better with Kong just to be even with Jackson, let alone surpass him.",1502409600,,672,4.419354838709677

7601516,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I'm a big fan of King Kong! I saw the 2005 remake in theaters with my mom, I owned all DVD Blu-Ray formats of this movie, and now I own the Ultimate Edition! This new Ultimate Edition is probably considered the best Blu-Ray version of this movie by far! The first Blu-Ray version, which features King Kong fighting on top of the Empire State Building as the cover art, is the first Blu-Ray Disc I've ever owned! The picture quality was mind blowing the first time I watched it, but I felt like it was really lacking in bonus features. I owned the 2-Disc Special Edition DVD, and owned the 3-Disc Extended Edition, and those versions had a lot of Special Features. Not as much as say the 2-Disc Production Diaries, but you get my point. With the first Blu-Ray version, even though it was good that you got both the Theatrical and Extended Cut, all you got was Peter Jackson's commentary, the picture-in-picture features, and that's basically it.

This new Ultimate Edition, however, has TONS of bonus features!!! Not only it comes with Both the Theatrical Cut and the Extended Cut, it also has the bonus features of the 2-Disc Special Edition, the 3-Disc Extended Edition, AND the 2-Disc Production Diaries! Just watching the Bonus Disc alone can fill up your entire day just watching the makings of King Kong!! From what I can gather, there are some features that are still missing, but some might tell you that that is not a big loss. The only complaints I have are actually just nitpicks. The first Blu-Ray Disc is still the same disc as the first Blu-Ray version came out. The only difference is the Blu-Ray art for this release has changed with the art of King Kong and the T-rex are gonna fight with Ann in the middle, though I've read that the UK version is literally the same disc art with just King Kong roaring like the DVD art. And the digital copy that comes with the Ultimate Edition is just the Theatrical Version and not the Extended Edition or both. But other than that, this is easily the best Blu-Ray version of King Kong out there!!

It's definitely worth upgrading to the old Blu-Ray copy, but does that mean that this version can finally make you get rid of all of your DVD versions of King Kong 2005? Well, that decision is up to you really. If you are a HUGE fan of King Kong, and want to own every single verison out there, then it's best to keep those versions, but also want to pick up the Ultimate Edition as well. However, if you feel like all those versions are just taking up too much room, and want a version that is the closest to having all of the features combined, this is a REALLY good replacement!

Either way, It's a very good version to include to your collection! it's literally $8 right now, and you can get nearly all of the features before this release, and it'll get you hyped for Kong: Skull Island!",1499990400,2,2843,4.463461538461538

After the female character is introduced to Kong for me the film spirals down to my 1 star review and here's why. The narrate of her relationship with the animal was unnatural. Meaning she was ""in love"" with the beast and the beast with her. It disgusted me as this ""relationship"" unfolded. By the time we get to the ice skating scene I'm ready to walk out the theater. After talking with others about the film's major flaw shortly after the movie was done, I realized I was alone in my assessment. No one else saw it.",1498694400,,593,4.4

My problem isn't the product, it's the seller (Round3 from Decluttr).

Here's what they left out of the description: Previous owner's initials on the front in Sharpie, severe dent on the entire back of the case, and a Jackson Pollock of smears and fingerprints on the underside of both discs.

The added footage brought the Peter Jackson version a little closer to the original and I was glad to see that.  It still has the most heart breaking ending of any movie ever made.

As with his Lord of the Rings trilogy, Peter Jackson's King Kong remake had an inordinate amount of specially-produced extras. Here too, they were spread across the BD and several different DVD editions with no overlap. If you wanted everything, you had to buy all of them. In the US, those Kong releases were:

&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Kong-BD/dp/B001KZVQJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Kong BD</a>&nbsp; originally issued in 2009 and repackaged several times since, the disc in the latest set is absolutely identical. It has the same VC-1 audio/video encode, commentary and other extras. As before it features the theatrical and extended cuts, via seamless branching. The only slight difference is that the US release now features on-disc artwork, as opposed to the prior disc's plain text design. In the UK, the film disc remains exactly the same as the original, while the bonus disc has the new artwork. If you're curious, it's the image of Kong and a V-Rex facing off against each other, with Ann standing in the middle.

&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Kong-widescreen-DVD/dp/B00005JO20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Kong widescreen DVD</a>&nbsp;(187:05 theatrical cut)  1-disc, also available in a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/fullscreen/dp/B000E97Y6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">fullscreen</a>&nbsp;(1.33:1) edition.

These were precisely replicated in numerous other countries, albeit with slight variations in dub and subtitle options. Note that the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HD-DVD/dp/B000ICM5VW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HD DVD</a>&nbsp;edition had only the theatrical cut and no extras. For this Ultimate Edition, the US, Spanish and Japanese releases add a somewhat redundant third disc: the widescreen theatrical cut DVD detailed above. Everywhere else omits it.

In the case of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit films, the studio's answer to completist fans was to simply repackage old discs in ever larger, more unwieldy &nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/and-more-expensive/dp/B01JH3KL0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">and more expensive</a>&nbsp; box sets. This time they've taken the far more sensible route of creating a single BD containing all the extras. Nothing new whatsoever has been produced for this set's bonus BD; it simply collects together virtually everything issued before. This includes obscurities like three Easter eggs and both of Jackson's introductions for the Special and Extended Edition sets' bonus features. However, a few DVD extras are missing:

 ""The Volkswagen Touareg and King Kong"" featurette (2:04)  from the theatrical cut DVD. A brief look at the making of VW's even briefer car commercial; likely left off due to rights issues and no great loss.
 ""See More of NYC in Wish You Were Here"" advert (1:08)  from the theatrical cut DVD. A bland tourism promo short, totally unrelated to the film and left off for good reason.
 Opening title sequence (1:53; only available by selecting Play All on the DVD) of ""Recreating the Eighth Wonder: The Making of King Kong"" 8-part documentary  from the Extended Edition DVD, which now starts immediately on part 1. It's a collage of video clips and soundbites which later appear in the doc itself, so isn't essential. Nonetheless, its omission is a strange one.
 Title cards (under 10 seconds each) are missing for two ""Recreating the Eighth Wonder"" chapters: ""Pre-Production: Construction to Filming"" and ""Bringing Kong to Life: Performance and Animation"".
 DVD-ROM PDFs of the film's 1996 and 2005 scripts  no big deal: they can easily be found in various places online.

If you do happen to get one of the UE sets that includes the theatrical cut DVD, it has the first two of the four missing items as its only extras.
Of course, the missing 4min Howard Shore production diary, featuring the composer before he was dropped from the project, is not included as it never appeared on disc in the first place (you can find it on YouTube). All the DVD extras have been transferred in their original standard definition onto the bonus BD. They looked fine in the first place but there is no improvement in A/V quality by housing them all on a BD.

If you're considering discarding all your previously-bought DVDs or picking up this set for your first purchase, you lose out on some minor extras and attractive DVD menus and packaging. However, you gain more shelf space and convenience. The choice is yours!",1486684800,53,5946,6.737597911227154

7601581,5,B01AHWLX2O,"King Kong (1933) was perhaps my first favorite movie, watched and rewatched on a grainy old VHS recording when I was three or four years old. It was the beginning of a lifelong obsession with giant monsters and an appreciation of the distinctive look of a stop motion animation (Jurassic Park's CGI dinosaurs were only one or two years away at the time).

Some today may view the acting as old-fashioned and stagey, but I love Robert Armstrong's (as Carl Denham) theatrical performance, and when Ann Darrow is taken by Kong I think Fay Wray gives a surprisingly realistic performance of someone in total shock that's\ uncommon for a film of the time. The plot is direct, and has the elegant simplicity of a fairy tale or fable, unlike the Kong remakes which try to expand upon this film's story, I think to lesser effect. The star here is really Kong himself, and it's amazing to see an animated special effect essentially carry the film once he shows up. You always hear about what a quantum leap it was to be in a theater in '77 and see Star Wars for the first time, but I imagine the reaction of audiences seeing this in '33 was even greater: a fantastical, expressionistic island (the art of Gustave Dor was a big influence on the dreamlike imagery of the island) swarming with all manner of giant monsters must've blown the minds of folks seeing this movie for the first time back then!

The Blu-Ray is fantastic. Picture is great, loads of fantastic bonus features. Initially this was released in a 'digibook' package with a built-in booklet, but now that version has fallen out of print and this new one has a standard case.",1486252800,13,1631,4.601374570446735

7601594,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Don't get me wrong, I loved the HOBBIT and LORD OF THE RINGS trilogies very much, but there's just something about this Kong that was better then those films. That something? There is no sequel or spin-off to this version of a classic tale, which means you can enjoy this as a standalone art film. There is also something that makes this take on Kong better than the 1933 and 1976 versions, and it is character development. I mean, the '33 and '76 versions were entertaining, but with Mr. Jacksons' film, you actually seem to relate to and ultimately care about Kong and his human counterparts. The visual effects, sound design and musical score by James Newton Howard work extremely well for this epic adventure. I say epic because it is a very long tale, but the length of over 3 hours actually helps to accent the spectacle, character development and storyline. The visuals by Weta Digital are surprisingly stunning by 2017 standards and so is the plot with the questions it inspires about the way we human beings treat each other, the flora and fauna of this planet, like ""how much should we trust the media?"" and ""should we really be exploiting the earth for selfish gain?"".",1484179200,6,1179,4.673076923076923

7601612,4,B01AHWLX2O,"The art house/big budget version of a classic. The film is a bit on the long side, but is worth seeing in high definition under the right conditions. Peter Jackson's allowance for this picture is seen in every frame and it truly is a spectacle. One upping the original in places, but at the end of the day, I don't think it has the same magic, it's girth actually straining the entertainment quality. The beauty of the picture strains it. I can understand why with all the great footage that it was so hard to deliver a film under 2 hours, but once it's over three, it is asking a bit much. Still everything on Skull Island is worth the price of admission.

The near bare bones disc does have the theatrical and extended and commentary. So those looking for more in depth special features might want to hunt down an ultimate edition or wait for a 4k disc.",1481068800,3,855,4.377358490566038

7601614,4,B01AHWLX2O,"I love movies about giant monsters!
And I though this remake was awesome!
What I liked was:
1. All the actors were great!
Especially Jack Black and Adrian Brody!
2. Kong looked great and more realistic.
3. The dinosaurs were awesome.
4. I loved the battle between Kong and the V-Rex trio!
5. Director Peter Jackson did a great job filming this
movie!
6. Ann got the message that Kong was not going to hurt her
after a while. In other words... she didn't spend the whole time
with Kong screaming! No offense to Fay Ray. Lol!

What I didn't like was:
1. I think that the movie was just a little too long.

Overall: I loved this movie! I can't wait to see 'Kong Of Skull Island'
is just as good as this masterpiece! And I can't wait to see him
fight Godzilla again in the not too distant future!

7601619,4,B01AHWLX2O,"The problem with this ""King Kong"" is the length.  Since we already know the story many scenes shcould of been combined with other scenes.  The opening hour could of been condensed to 20 minutes.  The film should of opened with Jack Black stealing his film and running on the boat. Instead we get a pro-longed opening that only bores the audience.  There is also scenes that just ""Bring this film to a halt"".  The ice skating scene was cute but not needed.  Peter Jackson is a gifted director but since his ""Lord of the Rings"" success  he seems to think that ""People Love Long Movies"".  That is not the case.  A good movie is never too long and a bad movie is never short enough.  Peter Jackson even stretched ""The Hobbit"" into 3 films.  I think he is still gifted director but he needs to learn ""Less is More"".",1480464000,,810,4.369127516778524

7601639,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson's King Kong is at heart a tender and moving film. The film is packed with action sequences and sometimes horrific deaths, but the primary focus is the relationship between Kong and Ann Darrow ( played beautifully by Naomi Watts). The ending is heartbreaking and haunting. Kong is no match for the callousness and cruelty of those who cause his death.  Only Ann comes to understand the loneliness and tenderness within Kong and he responds to her empathy with a fierce desire to protect her, which leads to his destruction. I think King Kong is even more relevant to our 2016 world than when it was released in 2005. We're so busy  killing and destroying that the simplicity and beauty of caring for eachother's welfare ( be it person for person or country for country or, as in the case of this film, man for beast) has been lost.",1472947200,11,844,4.62

The best thing about the movie was not the movie itself, but the special effects? that pretty much sizes it up.  If your learning about special effects as a course then it's good.  Naomi Watts stunk as Ann Darrow, There is only one scream queen and that's Fay Wray and one original King Kong.  Do yourself a favor and get a copy of the original.  This is one version I was hoping Kong killed everyone, starting with Jack Black and finishing with Colin Hanks atrocious acting.",1456099200,,619,4.442477876106195

7601728,5,B01AHWLX2O,"This 2005 version has all the benefits of computer enhanced imagery, and is a remake of the famous '1933' 'Fay Wray' classic, of course, there have been a few other attempts in-between.
I did see this one in the cinema when released and bought on 'DVD' when first released.
This 'Blu-ray' version has both the theatrical and extended version on board, the latter being around fifteen fun filled minutes longer.
Many scene sequences were extended and did in my opinion add to the spectacle which is 'King Kong'
The story we by now, know so well, a film crew and actor's along with the ships compliment stumble upon an un-chartered island where they find trible inhabitance living behind a giant wall, beyond which there are creatures from a by-gone age.....and of course....'Kong'
'Ann Darow (Naomi Watts)' becomes trapped behind the giant wall and captured by 'Kong' strangely they form a connection.
Film-maker 'Carl Denhan' (Jack Black) see's an opportunity to make big-bucks from the freak of nature which is 'Kong' cruelly they eventually capture the giant to display back home, which for the Giant Gorilla is unfamiliar ground.
It's a great spectacle with amazing 'Special-Effects'....an age old story line which tells of love and greed..........'Beauty and the Beast'....great Blu-ray title. ( A must buy if you have this format available )",1446249600,,1346,5.095022624434389

7601731,1,B01AHWLX2O,"Tripe banal wasteful remake of a classic.
This wasn't even as good as the '76 remake with Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges, it wasn't even as good as 1963's KING KONG VS GODZILLA.  Okay, it was slightly better than KING KONG LIVES which deserves the MST3K treatment but that's saying something.

It's disappointing that Hollywood keeps churning out these overblown over rendered special effects (CGI) laden films designed to get teenage boys to see them four or five times to drive the box office.  The real shame is that the general public continues to flock to these mediocre examples of pablum with little or no heart or story.

The crime here is that Peter Jackson is allegedly a fan of the original 1933 classic.  I understand the thought behind remaking that one; done with what at the time was state of the art technology you'd think we could blow that out of the water today, well it shows you that having something that actually exists as an effect, like a stop motion puppet, is vastly superior to anything a computer can generate.

Jackson's never met an editor he liked so we get double the ""fun"" with this mess.  Jackson completely missed the very most basic point of the original-- Kong is a more than a giant gorilla, he's the missing link.  He's that creature between man and ape, so therefore he walks upright like a man.  Having Kong as a potbellied silverback gorilla takes all of this away.  We should have had an Ultraman sized Dian Fossey come out and talk to Kong with some sign language.

The movie mercifully flopped at the box office, saving us from the threat of a Jackson helmed sequel.

The story of King Kong has always been among my favorite tales, so I seriously welcomed this excellent update to the telling of it; all the more excellent because it was devoid of the political baggage that permeates Hollywood productions these days.

Nevertheless, in the back of my mind, I can still hear Larry Niven saying, ""They have dinosaurs on the island?  Forget the big monkey!  Let's bring back a T-rex and make some *real* money!",1432944000,3,506,4.976190476190476

First issue is that it is way too long. It went on forever. It badly needed trimming down.

A more important issue is that it is no where near as good as the original. It is tough for a redo of a classic movie anyway and when it just isn't done all that well, it makes it seem even worse.

Didn't like the giant bug scenes all that much. Just did not fit in real well with the rest of the movie.

Fay Wray had a special quality to her performance that is lacking in Naomi Watts. Most of the time Watts just seems to stand there.

I thought Jack Black played the amoral movie producer with the right level of campiness. I rather liked his character.

Adrian Brody played the screenwriter way too straight for this kind of movie. After all, it is a movie about a giant monkey.",1432771200,,809,4.1210191082802545

It was a lifelong dream of his to do King Kong, and though he takes a few liberties in letting it go on a bit too long, it's a world you can't help but appreciate. As with all Jackson films, the secret is the cinematography. The camera movement is aesthetic and brilliant, and is largely how he tells the story of man, beast, and the conflict that separates them. Ahead of his time in CGI and motion capture, you see the more human qualities in Kong that bespeak of the giant as more connected to humanity that perhaps even the original could convey, and what's produced is an outstanding saga that only Jackson could create. Brilliantly animated for its time, Kong's world on Skull Island comes to life, and by the end, you find yourself rooting for him - even mourning the inevitable conclusion we all know is coming. As human as it is wild, King Kong is a ride, entertaining and thoughtful, that does well by the original and so much more.",1428710400,2,1015,4.375661375661376

But if you are a real ""King Kong"" fan. It was hard not to compare. We'll bless you ""Peter Jackson"" for releasing this dvd with the unedited scenes.

It had been some time since I first saw this on DVD on my previous, smaller, CRT-TV versus my new JVC 42"" LED screen. Color me impressed and I assure you that doesn't happen often. There were just a few seconds of video in the last 30 minutes that ""pixelated"" but not to any great distraction. Overall, the quality was equivalent to my more recent viewing on Blu-ray with a disc on loan from my library.

Despite the aforementioned limitations in my first viewing of this movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it as a fitting ""update,"" in a ""retro"" way, to the original and the Jessica Lange versions. The extra scenes in this extended version were quite enjoyable but really did not contribute to the overall impact of the action or suspense. I think this film does a much better job of showing the interests and reactions of a wider cross-section of humanity to the situation and the creatures than previous incarnations. Of course, the HD recording more completely exhibited those attributes as well as the detail in the ""scenery."" I highly recommend this film both as an action-adventure movie and as a character-study.

7601811,2,B01AHWLX2O,"I just rewatched this and remembered why I had never done so before.  This movie is so overwrought with tension that it goes from edge of the seat anxiety to detached boredom, thus proving it's possible to overdose on thrills.. There really isn't anything close to a movie here.  It's like a Disney ride gone on the fritz so that you get stuck too long in each area.  The number of hours I'm willing to devote to watching a handful of paper-thin characters grapple with a DMV length queue of CG animals was not equal to the task.  The payment for the two hours of my life I deposited in the discard pile was an end we all know is coming, and no one is going to like it.  And of all the crimes committed by Jackson and company here, none are quite as unforgivable as the very last line.  It's as if the goal here was to create a subtlety vacuum and at the very last minute they had concern that somewhere in the fourteen previous hours a tiny sliver of dignity may have escaped the clutches of the film makers so they threw in Jack Black's sign off as a way of salting the earth.",1425081600,,1078,4.183574879227053

He is a monster and super cool to watch! All in all a really good film that is defiantly worth your money!",1423699200,2,429,4.512820512820513
7601821,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Being a huge fan of the original, I have always been leery about a remake of this classic adventure film. The 70's version was horrible in my opinion ( Although I must admit liking it as a kid when I saw it in a theater) with a sequel King Kong Lives that is probably one of the worst films ever made!

After reading Jack Black was starring in the remake, I was again very skeptical about the outcome of this film. I went to the theater with an open mind and hoped for the best. As you have probably figured out I am going back in time to when I did in fact go to the theater to see this remake, but keep reading I do talk about the various releases of this film.

The film being set in the 30's like the original was key for me and I found Naomi Watts to be a fine Ann Darrow. Jack Black also impressed me because while his usual persona is a zany comedic actor, he plays Karl Denim with just the right amount of cheesy Ed Wood glee.

The trailers I watched of this film made me think the FX would not impress and looked cartoony, but seeing the film in a theater I was totally amazed (most of the time) especially with the FX used for Kong.

The film is long at close to 3 hours, but I was never bored, it takes a third of the film before we reach Skull Island, but it gives us a chance to soak up the characters and the beautiful detail Jackson put into this film. I own the extended version as well and even though it runs longer it actually feels shorter and is worthy of a purchase as it adds more dinosaurs. It also has a huge amount of brand new extras to help temp you even further.

OK, now we've reached the island and instead of having comical natives with coconut bras and bones through their noses, we are treated to some seriously disturbing ones who are quite scary and violent with the island intruders. I'm pretty sure everyone on this planet knows the story so I doubt there will be any spoilers in this review.

Now we reach the make or break moment when we see Kong for the first time. He is a sight to behold and I actually like the extended version at this point because the chase is much more hectic with more monster mayhem.

There is some controversy with what happens between Ann and Kong. In the original, Kong is a monster and even though he is fascinated with Ann, she is terrified of him from when she first lays eyes on him to the finale. In this film and the 70's version (which I loathe!) there is a connection with Ann and Kong, in the 70's version it is quite silly and comes across campy, but in Jackson's version it seems very believable because Kong is an intelligent creature, an ape, not a monster. The scene where they bond is very touching and I find it believable to a point, the point being if you can suspend disbelief for an ape that is 30 feet tall, then you can believe the bonding of two intelligent creatures.

Kong acting more like an ape helps give the story more depth and I found this version to really be the most interesting of all of them. Like I stated in my first sentence, I am a huge fan of the original seeing it 100 times in my lifetime, but this is the reason for a remake, to bring something new to a story without losing sight of the original concept.

Some other fine examples of worthy remakes being The Thing (1982) and The Fly (1986). Both films only add to the original, not taking anything away from them.

The dinosaur fights, especially the triple threat T Rex battle with Kong are long but impressive, the most unconvincing is the Brontosaurus stampede, over the top, but still very good for the most part.

One big controversy is the addition of the infamous spider pit scene that was cut from the original film. It really isn't necessary and it is quite ugly and long, but who am I to argue with more monsters? It is a nice contrast to the sappy story between Ann and Kong so I liked it overall.

OK, now we get to the Big Apple and the inevitable, the sad demise of this beautiful creature and while in the original we feel empathy for the little animated puppet Kong brought to life by Willis O'Brien, in Jackson's version it brings you to tears. There is one shot in particular that I found extremely heartfelt as Kong takes his stance atop the Empire State building not knowing exactly what he is up a against, he prepares to battle and protect Anne no matter what his fate. It is truly a wonderful moment, the kind of moment that is why we all go to see movies in the first place. If I had one negative thing to say about this film, it's that I didn't believe Jack Black when he spoke the famous last words......maybe no one could get that right?

The Blu Ray includes both theatrical and extended cuts of the film, but does not include all the extras from both previous DVD editions. I've seen both DVD's editions selling for $5.00 each and are well worth it for the extras alone, but Kong looks incredible on Blu Ray, so that is the way to go as far as the movie is concerned.

So overblown or not, Jackson's King Kong is one of the greatest remakes of all time and something he should be proud of, making possibly the best giant creature film ever made.",1423612800,2,5139,4.2306122448979595

The pros:  Great special effects, a vivid film to watch, but Kong.........personally, I look at the Kong in this film as just a large gorilla, nothing more.  He doesn't carry any presence or ""king-ness"" to him.  It might as well been a National Geographic about a gorilla in the prehistoric wild.

7601848,4,B01AHWLX2O,"1933's King Kong does not need to remind anyone of its iconic and legendary status. It's one of America's most iconic films for a reason. It was thrilling, terrifying, and to this day still holds some of that power to keep you on the edge of your seat. Such hard work fully being paid off is a feat that isn't often matched nowadays. The fact it can still pay off in such great manner is nothing short of impressive.

So with a film of such intensity, it's quite surprising that the actual franchise behind it is very weak. The sequels of 1933's version flopped, the 70's remake was terrible, and the sequel to that one was garbage, even Toho, the legendary company behind Godzilla, in my opinion couldn't fully capture what made King Kong so great.

It's so refreshing to finally see a movie that stands on par at the very least with it's predecessor.

I won't lie. Peter Jackson does a great job here. Yes, there are some problems, which I'll address, but he kept to the roots of the original story, he magnified the majesty of the creature Kong itself. He made a movie that was in the book of this giant monster movie nut, very good.

So when I hear people talking about how bad it is, I gotta say I feel sorry for them. Now is it a little over the top? Yeah.  Is the CGI overused? Yeah.  It's it too long? Dear God yes.

That was my main problem. 1933's King Kong wasn't afraid of showing us our leads, and getting them to the island, in order to show us the monster. Here they took more time to introduce and build character of the leads. A move I highly approved of. I loved that move. What I didn't like was how long we stayed on that boat to know more about our leads when we already knew what we needed to know. This was where Peter started throwing in some subplots and other things that in my book, just weren't needed. You have no idea how thankful I was to see Skull Island finally enter the film.

Speaking of, I gotta say the island looked fantastic. The natives weren't stereotypes like the original, the jungle looked wonderful, the dinosaurs? Wow. I will say the over the top action was a little much, but it's still a treat to watch Kong's battle with the Tyrannosaurus Rexes. He battles three of them at once! Over the top? Yes. Fun to watch? Most definitely!

I will say there is one element of the film that is drastically changed from the original. And that's the element of fear. 1933's version was meant to be viewed upon as a straight up horror movie. And since people back then were not used to seeing giant monsters on a movie screen back in the day, it was beyond successful. When the dinosaurs attack the men, it is scary. The battles that Kong has are heart racing. The only thing killing that fear element to me is just that actress who just screams way too much.

Here, the fear is replaced by a more romantic bonding type of element. The film dives deeper into the spiritual bond that both Kong and Anne share. And while they play this out wonderfully, it's once again drug out, only increasing the run time of this movie. They add in these scenarios featuring only the two, which while some are great addons, others... like a skating on a frozen lake scene, not so much.

But what this movie does that I love so much, is throwing in throwback references to the original. Sometimes line by line. You will hear direct lines of dialogue from the 1933 classic, you will see exact scenes or very closely done scenes that were in the original. One of them is the climax of the battle between the Tyrannosaurus Rex, and King Kong, in which he prys the jaw open, and smashes the skull in. The movement is so fluid and so close to the original. I mean Kong even moves the jaws open and closed like the original. When you see these throwback scenes, you can't help but smile, because this is Peter Jackson, acknowledging the original source material at his best, while not afraid of throwing in his own small touches, which do nothing to rob any glory.

So while this film may a little too much more than what we asked for, is it still a great film? My God, yes it is. It's still thrilling, exciting and believe it or not, there are things done here that were done better than 1933. I gotta say that with a franchise so weak, from such a great movie, it was so amazing to finally see a movie worthy of sharing the same name of King Kong. I even loved the extended edition, which is saying a lot since we all thought it was long enough. It's likely we won't see another film that matches the original film so much as this one does. For a generation that loves seeing more than what they could make back in the day, this movie is a great substitute. To those of us who still love the classics, I still say this film was great.  If you have doubts, I'd say see it at least once. I think you'll be happy to say you did.",1419638400,2,4840,4.29967069154775

Director Peter Jackson did a great work particularly with the CGI's for they were handled magnificently. It maybe three hours long as some viewers thought that it probably was overlong but personally it was far from it considering that it wasn't all about how great the special effects. But more importantly,the humanity of the characters in the movie was outstanding as viewers could relate to the emotions that they feel.

7601893,4,B01AHWLX2O,"What can one say about a three-hour plus King Kong?  Saw this in a theater in Washington DC (Uptown Theater) and suffered through the agonizing first hour -- what made anyone think a few minutes as with the original was not enough?  The real stars of the film are, of course, Kong (he is fantastic!) and the girl -- Naomi Watts -- really a terrific couple!  But who on earth cast this film with the Hack Jack Black and the Big Beak Brody???  Talk about the odd couple!  I'm sure that after the first time Big Beak kissed poor Naomi, someone decided it would be too risky for her to endure another -- he almost punctured her cheek with that beak.  Most of the supporting actors would have been a better love interest for her -- the actor who played the actor, the captain of the ship, even little Jamie Bell would have been better than this third rate actor despite his stupid Oscar!!!  Still, it's a good movie; recently, I bought a Blu-ray copy since my HD copy just didn't fully satisfy sound-wise, had to keep turning up the volume to get greater impact.  BD copy just fine, been through it once and will,of course, go back to experience those exceptional moments -- Kong's entrance, the stampede, and Kong fighting not one T-Rex, but three, the opening in New York among them.

7601898,3,B01AHWLX2O,"King Kong, 2005 film

It begins with two friendly monkeys. Next we see a zoo and a shanty town, then a soup kitchen. The background suggests New York City during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Various stage acts perform before a nearly empty house. Have you eaten today? The background shows the Third Avenue El (demolished by the 1950s). Times are tough. Men watch a movie, the investors are dissatisfied. The producer talks about a change in the story. Hes asking for more money. Carl Denham knows how to use a glass and make a quick decision. [Note the trolley tracks in the street. And the historic license plates.] Carl visits a Burlesque theater that is open. [Where is LaGuardia?] Carl rescues a young performer. Ann explains. Are you a size 4? Carl explains his business.

The ship Venture is ready to leave, except for the paperwork. Will you take a check? Jake Driscoll began the script. The Venture leaves port, some miss the boat. There are a lot of bottles of Chloroform. Bruce Baxter decorates his luxury suite. Jimmy reads Heart of Darkness, adventures on a tramp steamer [one with no regular schedule]. Ann practices acting in her room. Carl tells Jack about Skull Island. Filming begins on the boat. [Who develops the film?] The ship sails outside the regular lanes. One sailor tells about a large wall on an island. A radio message tells the Captain to change course. There is an arrest warrant out for Carl. They come up to a huge wall near the sea and strike it. The damage causes the ship to list. Can they fix it and leave on the next high tide? The rowboat lands, the passengers to ashore. Where did those skulls come from? Who placed them in order? No one has lived there for hundreds of years.

The place is deserted, as if some catastrophe occurred. Look, chocolate. But some natives are alive. Theyre harmless. Or are they? They take a trophy. The Captain arrives to demonstrate good judgment. Can the ship get away? Will a native board the ship? Where is Ann? Can she be rescued? Rifles are given to the crew. Some get Tommy guns. What sort of offering will they make? We see the Big Gorilla handle Ann. Behind the wall! Shes gone! [What good will Tommy guns do against a Big Gorilla? Arent gorillas vegetarian?] The ships crew follow the Big Gorilla. Preserve your ammunition! Stay in sight. Jack sees huge paw prints. Carl moves forward to film dinosaurs! What frightens them into a stampede? [The CGI effects are really great!] There is a scene that recalls Jaws. The remaining crew must return to the ship in nine hours. Or else.

Ann dances before the Big Gorilla, he plays with her. I said No! Mr. Hays leads his men. Get back! They are attacked and fire their weapons. But some fall into a chasm. A lizard chases Ann! Strange insects are in that cave. Next a T. Rex chase (for action). Then Big Gorilla fights two T. Rex lizard, then a third to triumph at the end. Kill or be killed. Jack gathers the survivors. The camera is smashed, the film ruined. A machete and club drive off smaller critters. But strange creatures devour some of the crew! The Captain shoots these insects to save the men. [Note how clean Anns feet are.] Driscoll wants to find Ann. Can they use chloroform to capture the ape? Bats live in caves, then attack Big Gorilla. Ann gets away with Jack. Where does that river flow? Help us! They escape. Will ropes hold that powerful Big Gorilla? No. They run to the rowboat to escape. Big Gorilla is persistent to the end.

King Kong is the Eighth Wonder of the World. [How did they load him on the ship, secure him and feed him a vegetarian meal?] Carl Denhams Giant Monster is on display at a theater. Ann Darrow Offered to the Beast is on the marquee. It is a big attraction (judged by the clothes of the paying customers). Ann plays in a comedy. Carl tells the audience about his adventure. They show Kong, a 25 foot high gorilla. The audience cheers. Bruce Baxter is introduced. There are dancers on stage. Then Ann Darrow is offered as a sacrifice. She screams Help me! But its a substitute. [Is this a sick act?]

Kong breaks free, the audience panics and runs. [Nobody is trampled.] Cars crash like a demolition derby. There is more destruction by Kong while he runs after Jack. He finds Ann on the street (in cold weather). Reunited at last? [No steam from breath in cold weather?] The military fire guns and rifles at this mad beast! Kong climbed atop the Empire State Building. [Product placement?] Where will he go? A squadron of biplanes fly by to attack Kong. [Where do the bullets go that missed?] Jack runs to the elevators. Ann says goodbye to Kong. [No visible blood on him, no wind to blow her hair?] Kong falls to the street below. [A big mess?] Jack arrives to rescue Ann. [Will the ME autopsy this corpse?] Did Beauty kill the Beast?

This is based on a story by Merian C. Cooper and Edgar Wallace. I think it runs on way too long, and money was wasted by creating a 1930s environment. The actors names are not listed by the characters they play until the end (in smaller fonts). If this film wasn't successful its because they created a more extensive story than needed. This was filmed in New Zealand. This film is dedicated to the actors in the original film. They say the characters and events depicted are fictitious. [No surprise there.] This movie has really great Computer Generated Images (CGI)! But its story isn't that great (believable/plausible). Resources were wasted by placing it in the 1930s instead of modern times. 1933 was modern times then. Were those natives made too crazy or scary? How did they live on that tiny island? Who built that giant wall? Movies from the 1930s always showed the explorers well-armed (as in real life); who censored this latest version?",1411084800,,5763,4.578488372093023

7601901,3,B01AHWLX2O,"Let's be honest Peter Jackson's ""remake"" of King Kong is okay. It isn't anything that you want to tell people about, but at the same time there is enough where you should walk away at least feeling like you got your money's worth. When Peter Jackson was done with LOTR and took this on as his next project I was excited, I thought he could really re-imagine this classic character and give it a new spin. In some ways he did, but really he just gave Skull Island more interesting animals than a Giant Gorilla.

This movie shines because of those animals, and insects, it's definitely not because of the actors who don't give you much believability.

The transfer is far, far superior to the DVD release, but it doesn't appear that all the extras have been ported over.  I've tried to navigate the menu and some content is available through the ""U-Control"" menu, but there seems to be a substantial amount missing- including various 'behind the scenes' documentaries and the deleted scenes.  In actuality, it's hard to imagine getting through all the special features included on the previous release- but I don't like that these companies keep releasing these sub-par collector's editions that ultimately force you to keep your old DVD if you want to retain all the previous extras.  On top of that, the entire concept of ""U-Control"" is terrible.  Just grant me access to the production art or interviews directly through a basic menu.  It's invasive and jarring to have the movie interrupted with brief snippets of information.

7601918,3,B01AHWLX2O,"Of course, there's nothing like the original, and the Peter Jackson release makes me say that with even more heart.  While the Jackson version can boast of some of the best special effects in a long time, the story was just mundane.  Jack Black is horrible as Carl Denham, character development was almost non-existent (Mr. Hayes and Jimmy?  What the heck was that all about?) and I lost count on how many ""look scenes"" there are in this movie (zooming in on an actors surprised stare). This movie does not have to be so long, time-wise, and there were times I would just sigh and say, ""let's get on with it.""  The feeble attempt to have the audience feel sorry for the ape was just that; feeble.  Each scene so overly done, that again, ""let's get on with it"" (Kong doesn't even make an appearance until well into hour number 2).  Jackson may call it a ""tribute"" to the original, but I would pass.  Even though the fight between Kong and the T-Rex (three no doubt) was superb, too many effects, the dragging story, and an almost stupid love affair can't hold a torch to the original much more quickly paced (yet campy) King Kong.  I nearly walked out during the ""ice capades"" in New York. With the city in turmoil due to an escaped giant ape, I found it impossible to believe that NO ONE would be anywhere in sight and allow Kong and Ann to ice frolic for what seemed an eternity.

7601933,1,B01AHWLX2O,"** This review may contain spoilers ***

Not one moment of intensity pervades this paean to the adoration of bestiality and the worship of the phallus as a transitory power between beast and man. The imitation of reality, suppressed within another artificial reality, is entirely concocted by using conspicuous colors, which are anesthetized and purely fabricated images from a soulless machine, devoid of monolithic uncertainty and ambiguity. Each moment must rely on the adorned saturation of repetitive violence from both beast and man, thoroughly debasing the viewer into a cognizant netherworld where they are coerced into dormancy (the function of this mediation between the viewer and the screen).

The exaltation of the 'modern city', emphasized by the advent of diversion capitalism (spectacle phenomenon), debasing the inferior instincts (beast) of man, is captured by the essence of that most propagated material of wealth, the skyscraper (phallus redefined as Empire). Eradication of the adulation in perplexity (old gods) is encouraged, devouring primitive man with a sense of immediacy of the new spectacle (the destruction of power mystified - Kong - replaced with that of diversion capitalism (spectacle phenomenon)).

7601940,5,B01AHWLX2O,"What an interesting re-imaging of the classic film.  This was one of the first Blue-Ray films that I bought for viewing on my player at home, and I was not dissappointed.  If I could level any complaint against this film, it would be the relatively slow start, but if you hang in through the first 40-50 minutes you will be rewarded with some great actioin sequences that are really different and original.  Dinosaurs, giant bugs, chase schenes (you get to watch Jack Black run, which is worth $10 by itself), and the film looks great in Blue-Ray.  I am not always pleased with the Blue-Ray versions of films becuase sometimes there is just a strange and artificial feel to the way items move on screen.  I am not sure how to describe it other than to say that certain objects that should be crisp will blur, and other parts of the screen that you would expect to blur with movement will be crystal clear.  Maybe it's just me, but I found that the HD format for this movie was very well done and I didn't have any issues like I just described.

Love it or hate it, this movie is well shot and a visually appealing work.  I am a huge LOTR fan, and I found that this movie has loads of scenes that capture the same kind of epic, wide-angle outdoor scenes that can be really enjoyed even if you mute the TV and just enjoy the visuals even without the distraction of the sound.",1393891200,,1373,4.3359375

When the legendary director turned his eye to remaking a childhood favourite film: the classic tale of a giant ape, the woman he loved, and the planes that stood between them...he didn't make your typical blockbuster. KING KONG is over 3 hours long, and the first hour of it isn't action. He put Jack Black in a (mostly) dramatic role, and for the role of Kong, he cast a human actor.

The result is an exercise in splendid, passionate, completely over-the-top film-making. KING KONG is a giant ape of a film: sometimes loud, energetic, perhaps a bit dumb, but there's no mistaking where it's big heart lies. Passionate is the right word for the film. Jackson, with those wacky geniuses at Weta Workshops behind him, throws himself completely into every detail of the production, digging deep into his creepy-crawly, horror film past to deliver a rich and immersive world.

The performances are uniformly excellent, and filled with heart. In the title role, we have&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Andy-34-Gollum-34-Serkis/dp/B00BMVTS1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Andy ""Gollum"" Serkis</a>&nbsp;- an absolute genius of an actor who's played a primate no less than twice in his career.

In the supporting cast, we find an excellent Jack Black and Adrien Brody, and Andy Serkis AGAIN, that man of many hats.

But what sets King Kong above your usual blockbuster is the level of detail put into the design of the film. In particular, the creatures of the lush, terrifying Skull Island would make Ray Harryhausen turn over in his grave. No longer harnessed by budget and stop-motion, Peter Jackson allows his imagination to run completely wild, conjuring a gorgeous land filled with terrifying and fantastical creatures. Tyrannosaurs, brontosaurs, velociraptors, man-eating worms, giant fish, and loads of creepy-crawlies all beset our heroes in true Hammer Horror fashion.

Now, most of the CGI works, and some of it doesn't in particular a brontosaur chase sequence is clearly green-screen. In addition to this, many would argue that the screenplay needs real trimming. While on the subject of cons, let's top it off by saying that one too many characters turn up at *juust* the right moment to be realistic.

But why am I talking about realistic? This is big, immersive, emotional and visual entertainment that doesn't reject plausibility so much as FLAUNT it's fantasticality! On top of this, Peter Jackson clearly has respect for the original that shines through the CGI. This is one giant of a film, about one giant of an ape! 4.5 beast-killing beauties!

A lost island, filled with prehistoric beasts and monsters, a fascinating cast of characters (special recognition for Jack Black), and of course, the giant ape himself (marvelously realized by the motion capture of Andy Serkis). I realize special effects aren't everything, nor do they make a movie... but in this movie, those special effects really are SPECIAL, pulling off some incredible imagery that made my heart race and my eyes bulge. When I was watching King Kong battle with multiple T-Rexes, I immediately decided that I needed to acquire a larger TV, this spectacle was so awesome. More importantly, none of it ever stands out as being ""fake"" or overly CGI- it blends in perfectly, which to me is the sign of artists who take great pride in their work.

7601992,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson's ""Kong"" was not just a movie but a thrill ride. A hyper thrill ride that touched me in so many areas. Especially visually. As a artist I almost quit painting after llooking at the astonishing hyper realistic detail in the movie. The texture, color, detail was incredible. The narrative was just as powerful as the visual.
Kong's battle with the two T-Rex was the best special effects I have ever seen. The intricate attention to detail as they fell down the cliff was uncanny. I found myself cheering for a alpha male like myself. Kong transcened his beastiality. Any XY chromosome male could identify with his sheer power, masculinity and battle scars..I rooted for Kong as if I had a front row seat at a Mike Tyson fight. I think Kong is one of the most iconic creature in moviedom history.
I almost quit painting after gazing at the color, texture, and detail of Jackon's epic movie. The only flaw was the depiction of the natives they came off as caricatures-----without any humanity. The other flaw was when  the ship started its epic voyage the smoke from the steamer looks pasted on the sky-- no movement.

In my opinion, this is one of the best action films of all time with some scenes that are downright epic in their scale, imagination, and heart-pounding action.

I truly love this movie.

That said, I was slightly disappointed with the Blu-Ray.

***** Slight Spoiler Alert *********

The humans in this movie interact with a variety of creatures and some of the most dramatic scenes involve the danger presented by the creatures on Skull Island.  In the theater, the CGI was completely believable.  It looked real.
On the HD Blu-Ray this is not the case.  At times it's like watching the old movies when the characters drive and it's obvious the cars moving behind them are on a screen.  The dramatic effect is severely lessened by the fact that the actors and the creatures appear to be on two separate planes and the creatures look clearly ""drawn.""

I am not sure if the standard definition DVD would eliminate this problem and recreate the experience that audiences had in the theater.  I haven't seen it.  I'd be curious if someone else has seen it and could comment.

I can't recommend this movie enough but I am hesitant to recommend the HD Blu-Ray.  I'd want anyone who sees this movie to have the same amazing experience that I did when I saw the movie for the first time.  Perhaps look to the standard definition DVD for that.",1369267200,,1430,4.570866141732283

7602024,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Being a huge fan of the original, I have always been leery about a remake of this classic adventure film. The 70's version was horrible in my opinion with a sequel King Kong Lives that is probably one of the worst films ever made!

After reading Jack Black was starring in the remake, I was again very skeptical about the outcome of this film. I went to the theater with an open mind and hoped for the best.

The film being set in the 30's like the original was key for me and I found Naomi Watts to be a fine Ann Darrow. Jack Black also impressed me because while his usual persona is a zany comedic actor, he plays Karl Denim with just the right amount of cheesy Ed Wood glee.

The trailers I watched of this film made me think the FX would not impress and looked cartoony, but seeing the film in a theater I was totally amazed (most of the time) especially with the FX used for Kong.

The film is long at close to 3 hours, but I was never bored, it takes a third of the film before we reach Skull Island, but it gives us a chance to soak up the characters and the beautiful detail Jackson put into this film. I own the extended version as well and even though it runs longer it actually feels shorter and is worthy of a purchase as it adds more dinosaurs. It also has a huge amount of brand new extras to help temp you even further.

OK, now we've reached the island and instead of having comical natives with coconut bras and bones through their noses, we are treated to some seriously disturbing ones who are quite scary and violent with the island intruders. I'm pretty sure everyone on this planet knows the story so I doubt there will be any spoilers in this review.

Now we reach the make or break moment when we see Kong for the first time. He is a sight to behold and I actually like the extended version at this point because the chase is much more hectic with more monster mayhem.

There is some controversy with what happens between Ann and Kong. In the original, Kong is a monster and even though he is fascinated with Ann, she is terrified of him from when she first lays eyes on him to the finale. In this film and the 70's version (which I loathe!) there is a connection with Ann and Kong, in the 70's version it is quite silly and comes across campy, but in Jackson's version it seems very believable because Kong is an intelligent creature,  an ape, not a monster. The scene where they bond is very touching and I find it believable to a point, the point being if you can suspend disbelief for an ape that is 30 feet tall, then you can believe the bonding of two intelligent creatures.

Kong acting more like an ape helps give the story more depth and I found this version to really be the most interesting of all of them. Like I stated in my first sentence, I am a huge fan of the original seeing it 100 times in my lifetime, but this is the reason for a remake, to bring something new to a story without losing sight of the original concept.

Some other fine examples of worthy remakes being The Thing (1982) and The Fly (1986).  Both films only add to the original, not taking anything away from them.

The dinosaur fights, especially the triple threat T Rex battle with Kong are long but impressive, the most unconvincing is the Brontosaurus stampede, over the top, but still very good for the most part.

One big controversy is the addition of the infamous spider pit scene that was cut from the original film. It really isn't necessary and it is quite ugly and long, but who am I to argue with more monsters? It is a nice contrast to the sappy story between Ann and Kong so I liked it overall.

OK, now we get to the Big Apple and the inevitable, the sad demise of this beautiful creature and while in the original we feel empathy for the little animated puppet Kong brought to life by Willis O'Brien, in Jackson's version it brings you to tears. There is one shot in particular that I found extremely heartfelt as Kong takes his stance atop the Empire State building not knowing exactly what he is up a against, he prepares to battle and protect Anne no matter what his fate. It is truly a wonderful moment, the kind of moment that is why we all go to see movies in the first place. If I had one negative thing to say about this film, it's that I didn't believe Jack Black when he spoke the famous last words......maybe no one could get that right?

The Blu Ray includes both theatrical and extended cuts of the film, but I'm not sure it includes all the extras from both editions. I've seen both DVD's editions selling for $5.00 each and are well worth it for the extras alone, but Kong looks incredible on Blu Ray, so that is the way to go as far as the movie is concerned.

So overblown or not, Jackson's King Kong is one of the greatest remakes of all time and something he should be proud of!, making possibly the best giant creature film ever made.",1367452800,2,4881,4.266233766233766
7602025,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I was looking for this film in the extended cut, and thought I would read the 1 star ratings of this movie in case of bad quality discs, cases, etc... and instead came upon the elitist musings of some really weird people.

Comparing this film to the 1933 original is like comparing a Model T to my 1999 SC300.  It is ridiculous at its core, and though all are entitled to their opinion, to lambaste this zoological CGI wonderland as some sort of cheap knock off is dull at best.  Take your mother to the grocery store first and give it a think before you write another movie review.

One dude actually said the facial expressions of the 1976 Kong were better than Jackson's Kong. That may be one of the dumbest things I have ever read, and the author cannot be serious, save some sort of neurotic ""opposite"" disorder. I am a lifelong zoologist who is as big a stickler for CGI animal movement in movies that there is.  Realism is everything, and it gets better all the time.  At the TOP of the craft is Peter Jackson and WETA.

Another douche crowed about how fake the animals looked, and referred to it as ""two movies clumsily put together"", or something to that effect.  This is drivel, obviously written by someone who knows ZERO about animal morphology or behavior.

The animals in Jackson's Kong look fantastic, and to say otherwise is nothing short of a glaring testimony to one's lack of knowledge on the subject.  When one says they look fake, when they don't at all, it implies (to me anyway) that you wish us to believe you have some perception the rest of us lack. When in reality it is just the opposite.

I could write for days about how stupid some of the reasons and rationalizations given for giving this film 1 star were, but I won't.  I just wanted to tip some of you off, so you could go read a couple of these reviews and wonder, as I did, what the heck these sniveling little movie snob weasels are thinking.  It is truly bizarre.

This movie is not perfect by any stretch, however.  Some scenes are too long, and it takes too long for Kong to enter. Black failed in his attempt to utter the famous final line, and in my opinion, his character should have died a dramatic Kong death, like Grodin did in 1976.

But I don't enjoy second guessing Peter Jackson, one of Gods gifts to cinema.",1367193600,2,2308,4.395294117647059
7602026,4,B01AHWLX2O,"I am a big fan of the Original King Kong and I enjoyed Peter Jackson's remake. But I prefer the theatrical version over this extended version. I feel that it is a bit too long and can only reccomend watching it to the hardcore fan (and then only if you are curious). For repeated viewings I prefer the Theatrical version.....But I can reccomend getting this set for the extensive bonus features (which do not appear on the theatrical two disc set)...If you are into behind the scenes detail, you will LOVE this. This set goes into exauhstive detail on the making of the film and even goes into the details of Jackson's Pre Lord of The Rings attempt to remake King Kong (that never saw the light of the day). it's all just tremendously engrossing. Theres also a very funny little short film that was made by the cast and crew (as a special birthday gift to Peter Jackson) entitled ""The Gift"".

So in summary: If you are a fan of King Kong and liked Peter Jackson's remake I can reccomend getting this 3 disc set for the bonus features alone and the extended cut only as a curiosity.

7602034,3,B01AHWLX2O,"First the good:
It's great to see the the Extended edition of this movie (in HD by the way) and not have to change the disc out half way through the movie. The picture quality is super clear and crisp, and the presentation is fantastic. This is obviously a movie that was made to be seen in HD, and it couldn't look better.

Now the bad:
The director's commentary with Peter Jackson and Phillipa Boyens is exactly the same as it was on the DVD version of this movie. Doesn't sound bad right? Well I mean that literally; its EXACTLY the same. Including the point where Peter Jackson tells you ""this is the end of commentary on the first disc,"" and a few seconds later starts with ""welcome back to the commentary, I hope you had some time to fix yourself a cup of tea..."" Truthfully, this isn't really all that bad, and I didn't expect them to record a new commentary for a re-release of the film on home video. But it is kind of weird to hear this knowing you don't have to change the disc. I suppose they could have re-editing the audio so that they cut this stuff out but then there would have been a long silence in between the scenes so, really, it's not that big of a problem.

Now for the bad, no seriously this is bad:
If you owned the DVD of the extended edition of King Kong then you'll know there were a couple of hours worth of behind the scenes documentaries included. Which appear to be nowhere to be found on this Blu-Ray. What is included is something called UControl, which will display an icon during the playing of the movie which you can select and then play a little behind the scenes clip. From the 4 or 5 of these I watched, they weren't really the same as the documentaries from the DVD, which might be cool except there is no option to only play these behind the scenes clips by themselves. You have to watch the movie in order to watch these clips. I'm the kind of person likes to play behind-the-scenes stuff while I do work but this Blu-Ray would require me to pay attention to it in order to watch any of this stuff.

So in conclusion, great HD, kind of a commentary kink, and the behind-the-scenes features are not the same and presented in a bad way.

I think I watched the Extended Version, although I am not sure, because it is not clear which one is being selected.

The audio was excellent - lot's of surround sound and sub-woofer bass.
The video quality was also excellent.

It dawned on me while watching this why the 1976 version hasn't been released on Blu-Ray.  It is because of 9/11 and the World Trade Center towers in the movie.",1363651200,,580,4.58252427184466

7602045,4,B01AHWLX2O,"I have no problem with the added length (although I'm not crazy about having to buy this movie twice in order to get the ""full"" length of the movie).  I also have no problem with it being heavily laden with CGI effects (you do what you have to in order to make the movie you want the public to watch and buy).  I accept the story departures because I liked a lot of the revisions that Jackson made (however much we want things to be written in stone and tamper proof, people will muck about with the things we love).
The problems I do have with this film have more to do with the overall creepiness of the relationship between Kong and Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts).  The idiotic casting choice of Jack Black as Carl Denham (he immediately turns Denham into a nasty slug, entirely too vile and despicable to enjoy on any level).  And the Ichabod Crane look-alike Adrien Brody as Ann Darrow's second choice love interest.  Getting past them took some doing, managed only because the story kept things aloft and alive.
I will always hate the final line of both films because it's so obvious that ""beauty"" had nothing to do with killing the beast.  The blame falls squarely on the little weasel quick to cast the guilt elsewhere.
I did love the sumptuous look and feel for the time period depicted, the fabulous adventure on Skull Island (I could have enjoyed more of this and less of the love interest between Kong and Darrow), and the lovely score by James Newton Howard.
I choose to regard this as less a remake of the classic original and more of an addition to the continuing saga of Kong.",1363392000,2,1586,4.451724137931034

In general I think of other instant videos were in this price range more would be sold.  the fact that most streamed instant vidoes are $9.99 a price that is not that far away from the cost of the DVD's that are higher quality makes it hard to justify the cost.

The dinosaurs also look fabulous; [SPOILER ALERT when King King cracks one of their jaw's... wow]. Besides the visuals, the movie also has heart. Jack Black is not his usual self. He really does a terrific job of playing a driven movie producer. Naomi Watts is a wonderfully modern damsel in distress. The story is well adapted, and it works.

The Lord of The Rings trilogy is a great example. i loved those three movies, but I fast forwarded through at least a third of them. Who in hell wants to watch three little guys walking around all the time and the sentimental music playing in the background as they smile stupidly.

Even Peter King's magical movie making can't top her smile. I felt sorry for Kong because as hard as he tried he just couldn't keep her.
 I saw this movie on the big screen and it was a thrilling spectacle from start to finish. The expressions on Kong's face will make you feel empathy for him.

7602092,5,B01AHWLX2O,"The story of King Kong is a classic piece of American Cinema. Peter Jackson has stated in the past that he grew up with a deep-seated love and adoration of the original King Kong from the early 1930's. So who better to direct a massive 3 hour plus story about a massive ape, than the man who made me fall in love with Middle Earth? Yes, Peter Jackson was probally one of the best things about this film. He may make very long movies, but at least they are also very entertaining and engrossing movies. King Kong does tend to run on quite a bit, due to possibly unnecesary scenes, like giant bugs for example, and the Extended Edition adds on even more. I can't say for sure that they were unnecesary, because they may have been in the original films. Then I would just sound stupid for calling them ""unnecesary"". Thank God they had the presence of mind to reserve some stuff for an extended edition though. Even with the footage some might call ""unnecesary"", I still found very much to appreciate in the story. I know the first thing alot of people say is, ""CGI takes away from a good story"", but definitely not this one.

It was fresh and exciting for me to see Kong done so realistically, with modern technology (before it took over Hollywood). Kong himself, is so realistic, I had a hard time getting over how beautifully he was created. Everything from a wound he got in battle, to wet fur was gorgeous. It was an especially nice touch when he would breath on Ann, and her hair would blow in the air current. I also have to say that I was pleasantly surprised to see Jack Black in a more serious role. Some may disagree with me, but I think he did a fine job. As did both Naomi Watts, and Adrian Brody. None of the actors are more intriguing than Kong though. So while King Kong is far from a perfect film, I believe Peter Jackson and his team did a fantastic job of bringing this classic to a modern audience. Many people think that classics should never be remade, but I say if the movies are really that good, filmmakers should reintroduce them to younger generations with a modern look.

What more is there to say about this flawless transfer that hasn't already been said a thouand time over? It truly is one of the pinnacles of the media format, and would (did) serves as a terrific reference disc. As a general rule of thumb, I automatically bump my extras rating up to a 3/5 if there is a commentary on the disc. That happens to be the only thing of real value on this disc, aside from the film iteself obviously. So I'll definitely be holding onto my 3-Disc DVD set.

I expected a movie about a giant ape, because I knew virtually nothing about this movie, and got a film concerning the tyranny of the real world with dinosaurs, humungous bees, and other huge special effects.

It's be a while since I saw this in the theater, but remember really liking it, so I purchased this for home streaming and decided to get the extended version.  I love it.  As the story unfolds you get lots and lots of edge of your seat scenes, with lots of tension and gripping action.

I don't think the that the scenes between Ann Darrow and Kong are too much or too many, in fact they help the story to unfold and provide some charming relief, comic at times, to the action, which is much needed.

Peter Jackson and crew has created a lush and beautiful world, be it Skull Island or 1930's New York.  It's a world you can immerse yourself in and enjoy as the tragic tale of Kong is told.

The cast also did an outstanding job, which I didn't think the first time I saw this.  After seeing it again, I've changed my mind and think the cast played out their parts perfectly.

I'd recommend the extended version for folks who get pulled into this type of movie, so that they can sit back and get lost in the world of Kong.",1344038400,6,1099,4.2451923076923075

7602096,2,B01AHWLX2O,"King Kong is about a 90 minute movie squeezed into over 3 hours.  Talk about taking a relatively simple straightforward plot and extending it beyond all reasonable comprehension.  That's what you get with this.  Everything about this movie is just overly drawn out.  It takes forever just to get started. An overly long wait just to get the main characters to get to the ship.  An overly long trip to Skull Island.  An overly long time just to park the ship for crying out loud.  There are times where Jack Black is just staring at things for an inordinate amount of time.  In one scene, on the island, he's staring at the film in the camera and pondering something.  Even a simple scene like that takes too long. Get the idea?  You don't even get to see King Kong until about 90 minutes into this monstrosity.  Even basic events like the dinosaur stampede are just mind numbing and overplayed. I could have gotten up, gone to the bathroom, gone to the kitchen, picked up some snacks, gone back to the TV and the dinosaurs would have still been crashing into each other.  It's just ridiculous.  I get that Jackson was trying to turn it into an epic, but it just doesn't work.  This isn't Lord of the Rings.  King Kong does not have a following like that.  Making a movie extra long doesn't automatically make it good.  Another problem with the movie is the main characters.  Naomi Watts is fine, but she has zero chemistry with Adrian Brody.  None.  The love story falls flat on it's face.  How can it work anyway when Watt's character obviously favors the giant ape?  Brody's character becomes almost pointless.  This movie was just so long and boring that I almost never finished it.  I finally ended up watching the end almost 3 weeks later.  I cared that little about it. The DVD quality is fine.  You get extended scenes, in case the original wasn't long enough for you.  More scenes of the endless supply of ship crewmen getting massacred by dinosaurs.  There must have been 200+ crewmen on that little ship.  There are tons of extras on the DVD's for those that want to spend a week processing King Kong.",1337904000,2,2111,4.539893617021277

7602101,3,B01AHWLX2O,"I am usually opposed to making remakes of major classics that are beloved by huge numbers of people. King Kong is really no exception. It might seem like a prime candidate for an update, as you sometimes have to smile at some of their primitive 1933 special effects. But you have to remember that we could never do what we do today if it weren't for their pioneering efforts, and the step-by-step improvements of everyone else along the way. The biggest problem, of course, is that many movie-makers today - those who did this version of King Kong included - overdo it. Back then, you had to be creative to get something you wanted on the screen. Today, all you have to do is type a couple buttons on a computer.

One thing that was definitely more REALISTIC in the original King Kong was the WALL. That was definitely BUILT, and by HUMANS! That huge stone wall in the new version... wow. That looked so fake, especially when the camera pulled back and you could see it from way up in the air, lit on fire.

I did enjoy this version of King Kong. It kept my attention for the most part, but there were too many times I was just thinking, ""Oh, come on already!"" Kong fights three t-rexes to save the girl. Fine. But after he tosses them over the cliff, did he and the girl really need to fall over the cliff after them??? And then the girl bounces back and forth from t-rex tooth to t-rex tooth until Kong rescues her again. Sigh. The other dinosaur chase that ended with them falling in a pile was so drawn out! (Almost funny, really.) The sea-monsters seemed unnecessary. And the bugs and wormy things! So gross! How did ANY of them get out of that alive? I guess because they kind of just disappeared. And what was up with the car chase at the end???

I saw in the special features that even the water they rowed the boat in was CGI. For goodness sake. You will not convince me that rigging up a rocking boat, hanging a green screen, splashing water at the actors, having them put fake pressure on the oars, and animating in water is simpler than putting a boat in water and filming it. After all, they did it 80 years ago. (""But the weather might not be right!!!"") I think it's just an excuse to show off what they can do. This whole movie was an excuse to show off what they could do. Some of it they did well. Most of it looked fine. It was just way too much.

Overall, not a bad movie, but not destined to become a classic.

Video: Without any trace of DNR or edge-enhancement, this is one of the most lifelike transfers I've yet seen, with colors that are wonderfully saturated without being overdone, and perfect contrast--which at times may seem a tad high, but this is inherent to the source material, and not a flaw in the transfer. 10/10.

Audio: As expected from a movie that won an Oscar for sound design, this DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio track is flawless. Every sound is completely--and I know I'm using this word a lot--lifelike, making excellent use of the surrounds, be it for subtle ambience or loud action-oriented effects. Music and dialogue are perfectly prioritized, never lost in the frenzy of wild action sequences. 10/10.

Special Features: It's somewhat lacking in the special feature department. Ah, well. 5/10.

7602109,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I love reading all the reviews.
It's amazing how everyone seems to be put out about the computer-generated effects, complaining that they don't look ""real.""
Well what, if anything at all, could possibly be ""real"" about a movie set in the 1930's, showing cars and buildings and clothes from that era, and featuring a pre-historic island, and a 50-foot tall ape, as well as dinosaurs and other pre-historic reptiles?
I mean, it's all made up, and it's all fake, and it all sprang from some writer's imagination, and it is all very entertaining, and even enthralling.
The skill and the genius that goes into an enterprise of this sort, to produce a two or three hour DVD that you can buy for a few bucks, to look at over and over, and see all of the millions of dollars worth of special effects - how wonderful is that?
I thrilled at the original King Kong, and agree that it is truly the Granddaddy of all science-fiction movies.
You talk about ground-breaking:  How original and mind-boggling was stop-motion animation in the 1930's?
This movie is no doubt the epitome of the most effective use of computer-generated effects that I've seen, but, of course, I haven't seen everything.
The fact is that much of the stuff we see on the screen today is computer-generated, but since they are contemporary scenes, we just assume they are real.
But I do have one question that intrigues me, and frankly puzzles me:
Why all of the carping about the lack of ""extras"" that people seem to be so genuinely upset about?
When you buy a movie and it comes with an extra disc, or even two, of ""extras,"" who really watches that stuff?
I have looked at it, but I must say it doesn't enhance, for me, the value of the movie, at all.
Maybe I'm missing the point, but I guess I have to ask, ""What's the point?""",1325376000,,1789,4.521604938271605

Incredible picture on the blu-ray and the sound is equally amazing.

7602111,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Let me first say that I love this movie and the original. When I was a kid I saw the original on TV and loved the T-Rex fight just like every other kid. Now coming back on this version I have seen this movie more times then I would like to count. I own 3 different copies of it and I have the most recent blu ray release of King Kong.
For those of you who don't know King Kong is about a film director, named Carl Denham who is trying to be a successful movie director during the great depression. While in New York he meets a recently laid off actress named Ann Darrow. He conveniences her to come shoot his movie with her as the main character. Another important character is Jack Driscoll, who is the writer of Carl's film and gets dragged along this adventure with Carl. Basically they take a ship and land on a mysterious island named Skull Island home to the mighty King Kong!
When it comes to the plot of this movie its a very thick and complex plot. There are many characters you meet besides the very few I mentioned. Many people hate the length and the amount of subplots in this movie. All I have to say is that people have to understand how difficult it is to remake King Kong a third time. When your using a movie that's been used over twice already, you have to come up with new stuff and new ideas. You can't just have the same basic plot. Yes, some of the subplots go no where, but many are important and interesting.
The Acting was quite good in this movie too. Naomi Watts did a great job as a beautiful Ann Darrow. Jack Black made a good kind of smart mouthed Carl Denham. Adriend Brody was greatly casted too. Yes Brody is not used to action type movies, but he does portray a play writer. I doubt a play writer would be very good at those types of stunts on Skull Island either. Even the Skull Islanders themselves were great and quite scary looking.
The dialogue was decent. There were a few lines I didn't quite understand especially during the love scenes on the venture voyage at the start. I think that is more because of Peter Jackson's non-experience with writing those kinds of scenes.
Overall I do enjoy watching this movie. Like I said before I have seen it many times and enjoy it every time. This is one of the movies that sparked my great interest in movies, whether it's collecting them, watching them, reviewing them, or making them. If you are looking for a good CGI packed thrill ride this is for you!

7602112,5,B01AHWLX2O,First let me start by saying that I emphasize with those people who think this movie is too long. Thats the only thing that kept me from going to see it in the theater. Actually it goes by pretty  quick for me and that includes the extended edition. This is the best of three of them althouth I do like all three of them. Naomi Watts Jack Black and Adrien Brody are better or at least as good as the original three. Jack Black played Carl a movie producer trying hard to get a hit movie. Adrien Brody played Jack a playwrite who is tricked into riding with them on that ship. And finally Naomi Watts plays Ann a down on her luck actress whose luck is so bad that she actually believes that nothing good lasts a feeling she doesnt shake. Until the end because even though King Kong dies she ends up with her true love-Jack. Now lets get back to what I like about the movie. I really love the extra scenes in the extended edition. They make the movie ten times better. The dinosaurs weren't even in the first remake.  Thats the one that has the most flaws and thats just the begining but like I said I like all three of them. King Kong is my favorite movie and  if I recommeded it I would recomend the original. Better still I would reccomend this version of King Kong and the extented edition which is made ten times better by the three extra scenes as I said earlier. King Kong lives. Yes King Kong lives. And this is the best one. If you want to watch the original go ahead. Otherwise watch this one or better yet the extented edition.  I cant say it enough. This is the best version especially the extended edition. Theres an extra dinosaur scene. There is a river or moat scene that isn't in the theater version. Actually its more of a raft scene. He fights three dinosaurs in the dinosaur fight. When she was rescued King Kong was asleep and quickly not to mention inadvernadly woken up. They wouldnt have gotten away if they hadnt frightened up some pterodactyls. King Kong is an excellent movie. Like I said Im not trying to get negative but some people don't understand that in a movie like this you cant have instant action. You also cant see King Kong right away. This brings me back to my original point lentgh. Some people don't understand that the first hour was spent getting to know the charactors. I understood that once I gave this version a chance. As for the annimation/cgi who cares if there was too much of it. I found it thrilling. One scene I find funny is when Ann and Jack first meet and she mistakes some one else for him. That is actually one of the few funny scenes as this is meant to be an action movie rather than a comedy. But getting back to the annimation/cgi as I said I found it thrilling. And believable by the way. Unlike most people by the way I don't think there was too much of it. I loved it. I don't want to get negative or have too many people get mad at me which Im sure some will but thats what I think. I don't see why some people wanted to see the natives again especially the way they were portrayed. Besides you don't need to see them at all after Ann is sacrificed to King Kong a fact only Peter Jackson knew for sure. He did the best job he could which was his best with the story especially the extended edition and its three extra scenes. As well as some extented scenes. This brings us back to annimation which was used in at least two of those scenes. You cant do a movie like this without some kind of annimation which not everybody understands. Dino De Laurentis tried and thats why his version even though I like it is as bad as it is. Merian Cooper used stop motion annimation. Peter Jackson chose cgi which like stop motion annimation I found thrilling. I loved it. Jacksons version also stays true to Coopers unlike De Laurentis who destroyed the story  that is KING KONG when he made his version. Anyway Peter Jacksons version -paticularly the extended edition-is the best. King Kong lives. Thanks Amazon.,1322179200,,3967,4.326612903225806
7602113,4,B01AHWLX2O,"At 188 minutes, this version of the 1933 classic movie is good for the most part. Though Kong doesn't appear until an hour and ten minutes into the film, the viewer isn't getting restless, because they know that he will be the focus of the remainder of the film. This movie starts a bit slow (obviously), but the first hour isn't exactly wasted, as time is spent on character development, especially with Ann Darrow. We're taken into her world as an actress, and how she's pursued for her role. Naomi Watts does a superb job as Ann, and her compassion for Kong is heartfelt and real. If this movie has some weak spots, it's simply the length of it, along with too much emphasis on CGI capabilities. Some of the CGI sequences are over the top, and to the point of not looking real, whether it be too many closeups, too much ground-level stuff, or unusual athletic ability. Certain sequences are wonderful, such as the T Rex fight, and Kong's rampage through the city streets. All in all, this film is still good, and kept my attention throughout. However, I needed a break after the first half; it seems to work well that way.",1321488000,,1125,4.519607843137255
7602114,5,B01AHWLX2O,">>> This review is for the Extended Edition on DVD >>>

King Kong has long been a favourite. We've seen quite a few films (at various degrees of acclaim), novels, cartoons, toys, et al. Peter Jackson's epic manages not only to show Kong's sheer power, but a wide range of emotion as well. Anyone out there a fan of Beauty and the Beast stories? Well, they don't get much better than this.

This cut of the film is 201 minutes long, worthy of the mighty Kong himself. At over six hours, there's a mighty serving of behind the scenes and audio commentary, nearly forty minutes of deleted scenes, outtakes (my favourite), and a great deal more. The picture is amazing on DVD even when played on a PS3 and 47"" Vizio. The list of subtitles are pretty weak, and the soundtrack is a 5.1; here's hoping the BD version is better off.

If you are fence sitting about switching to BD, you might want to hold off before taking the plunge, especially if you are interested in special features. The film quality stand on its own.",1321142400,3,1015,4.446236559139785

The movie is not only to full of Bloody scenes but it also has Animal Abuse in it. for example: the NY people Torture and abuse King Kong in the film when they find him. and then at the end of the film King Kong Dies with pain.
The Woman whom was captured by Kong was always Crying And weeping every time she saw King Kong Die or being tortured. which was to long and to common.
when they already captured Kong I was already crying.
This film can only be watched once and that's all, because it is so sad that it's like watching a car accident ect ect.

7602120,3,B01AHWLX2O,"I harbored monumental hopes for this film when I learned that Sir Peter Jackson was finally going to get to make it. I was especially excited to hear Sir Peter comment in an interview that the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Kong/dp/B000EHQTZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Kong</a>&nbsp;was his favorite film of all time because it's one of mine as well. Clearly, this actuality would have inspired him to do a great job on his own interpretation... but, Alas! I fear that this production snowballed and got away from him.

This epic-length film reflects the work of many of his former&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Motion-Picture-Trilogy-Platinum-Series-Special-Extended-Edition/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)</a>&nbsp;comrades. He brought along quite a bit of the production crew (as well as some actors) for the ride and so it was natural that *Kong* was produced by much the same process... lots of blue-screen insertions anticipating special effects.

To encapsulate the matter, that's my chief criticism of the movie -- it has just way too many special effects. I found myself *enduring* and not enjoying the near-endless unlikely dinosaurs-chasing-screaming-people [and similarly redundant encounters] scenes. From my view, Sir Peter had forsaken the idea of artfully directing these otherwise skilled actors to carry the core story, reserving the special effects solely to punctuate their artful performances. In this instance, the renowned Director has thrown in everything but the kitchen sink and I wouldn't swear that it didn't fly past as well. It was all just too much and I think that Sir Peter's approach significantly diminished this potentially superb adventure yarn.

One facet of this movie in particular that I wished to remark on was that the characters under assault seemed far too capable of absorbing punishment by the various critters and other disasters, and still somehow [by numerous miracles?] survive. Kong gave this little gal pretty rough handling and I'm compelled to observe that the first squeeze he gave her would surely have done her in. Yes, it's a fantasy movie of a sort but one still cannot mentally deny the laws of physics and/or biology while attempting to absorb this sort of escapism film.

This leads me to my third [and final] point: Sir Peter's *King Kong* yields up an excess of what he intended as *humorous moments* [vignettes of Gimli!] and he obviously chose cast members who could effectively convey this technique, given a quality script. So the approach here was much the same as what we encountered in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Indiana-Jones-and-the-Kingdom-of-the-Crystal-Skull-Single-Disc/dp/B001DTPZNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Single Disc)</a>, another even more unfortunate film production. *Kong* takes the original Fay Wray film and tacks on a one-liner to most scenes. I viewed it all as an aggregation of distraction and mis-spent effort.

So, I didn't like the film; however, many others will enjoy it to various degrees. If I haven't provided adequate specifics for you to decide, it might be best if you simply rented it first. Or, you could do what I did and buy it at Big Lots for three bucks! I'll soon be passing my copy on as a minor gift to some appreciative young person.",1311552000,2,3585,5.820952380952381

7602122,1,B01AHWLX2O,"This is King Kong for the attention deficit disorder generation. CGI overkill takes away all the horror, suspense and awe of seeing Kong in the 1933 original. As other reviewers have said, Kong is reduced to a cartoon character and since all the sets are computer-generated, what 1930s detail there is comes across as completely fake. It makes Rick Baker in an ape suit look warm and down-to-earth. I can never lose myself or suspend disbelief in this film the way I lost myself in the 1933 or even the 1976 version. Speaking of which, the 1976 version, which is a mixture of soft porn, camp, and an 1970s era anti-establishment film, looks like a near masterpiece in comparison. At least the miniatures (like the subway and the World Trade Center towers) were real and fun to look at, whereas you're constantly questioning whether it's real or CGI in this Peter Jackson travesty.

If each film is representative of its time, then 2005 is vapid, unoriginal, hypocritical, tech-happy, consumerist, and shallow. The 1976 version had a great soundtrack (showing the high level of originality common to 70s music) while treating Jessica Lange as a disco-era sex object, complete with Marilyn Monroe cutesy voice, in an era where the sexual revolution was about to collide with feminism. Despite this, it is still watchable and amusing, made in an era before MTV and video games led us to Ritalin. And it shows a comfort and acceptance of contemporary life, for the 1976 film was made before ""sequels"" were commonplace, and so de Laurentis had to justify the new film's existence by updating it and making it relevant to contemporary concerns (the oil crisis). Popular culture in the 70s was still about ""making it new"" unlike the 2000's, where the rage is ""vintage"" and ""repro"" and living in the past.

Flash forward to 2005, four years after 9/11 and during the illusionary ""prosperity"" of the U.S. during the infamous mortgage boom, which was, in reality, based on emptiness and false promises of selling people houses they couldn't afford. By setting the film back to 1933 rather than updating it, as the Dino de Laurentis did, Peter Jackson was jumping on the ""nostagla"" ""repro"" and ""vintage"" bandwagon. The present era, in other words, apparently has no original music, no identity, just consumerism/flashiness, and the mindless CGI binge-fest exemplifies this. There is no reason to revisit the 30s except for a bankruptcy of the imagination. Noami Watts is, naturally, given the ""feminist"" treatment - in her mid to late 30s, she is the oldest Fay Wray yet, and as if to make up for her lack of glamour, she is given silly comic bits to play, like tap dancing (""hey, I have more to me than looks!""). The black guy on the ship is treated with careful respect at all times, though, strangely enough, the funny Chinaman from the 1930s is brought back in all its racist glory. Since China contributes to the high budget deficit and ""owns"" the U.S., maybe this was intentional (it's okay to make fun of the Chinese, but not okay to be racist toward blacks). Like the Guy Van Sant, shot-by-shot remake of ""Psycho,"" the Peter Jackson ""Kong"" is a waste of time.",1310428800,11,3156,4.810313075506445

Sadly, a nagging feeling I had about the film turned out to be true. At 188 minutes, this film is just too long. Now, don't get me wrong, there are a number of three-hour plus movies in my collection. But with this film, what could have been an intense, action-packed film turns out to be just one elongated scene after another, nearly derailing the film. And the presentation of a ""love story"" between Kong the Ape and a human woman is kind of handled weirdly. The cast does as good a job as it can with the extended script, and the visual effects and James Newton Howard's score are really good. But this film definitely should have been under two-and-a-half hours. This is only a film for those with a huge amount of patience.

It would be nice if BSE ENTERTAINMENT, INC sent me an empty holder for their damaged product.  As of now, the three discs are in three separate DVD holders, which is not satisfying.

7602129,5,B01AHWLX2O,"***This review may contain spoilers.***

The more I ponder Peter Jackson's re-interpretation of the classic 1933 movie ""King Kong"", the more convinced I become that he was at least subconsciously paralleling James Cameron's blockbuster ""Titanic"". Like Cameron, Jackson wanted to transcend the basic, naturalistic action and horror aspects of the tale and meticulously explore a relationship that will outlive death and fate. Consider the climax; the airplanes finally succeed in knocking Kong off his Empire State Building pedestal and almost over the edge. He is still clinging by his fingers. He exchanges one last lingering, emotional look with Ann Darrow, then finally lets go. He slowly plummets to the ground. It reminded me of Jack clinging to the driftwood in ""Titanic"", exchanging one last sorrowful look with Rose before letting go and plunging to the bottom of the Atlantic.

However, the 2005 version of King Kong (hereafter KK2005) is not strictly a love story. There really isn't any romance, even between Ann and Jack. It is the story of a tortuous, danger-fraught, but ultimately enduring friendship between an unemployed actress and a dinosaur-sized ape. It may remind you a little of ""Gorillas in the Mist"", the movie about naturalist Dian Fossey's relationship with the endangered simians. The 3-hour movie running time may be annoying to some, and sometimes understandably so, but it is utterly necessary to explore the developing interaction between Ann and Kong, and to reveal that Kong is not a legendary demon, but a natural, sentient beast who is the last of his species. Besides, he is strictly a vegetarian (remember him munching on the bamboo?). Make no mistake, Ann certainly fears Kong at first, but her previous hard-scrabble life and talents give her the determination and moxie to take control of the situation. So much so that Kong is even perplexed by her and eventually leaves her, until the dangers of Skull Island, culminating in an attack by three (!) Tyrannosaurus Rexes reunite the duo and give Ann's champion quite a workout!

The jungle battles Kong fights on Ann's behalf are more exciting than the perils Carl Denham, Jack Driscoll, and the Venture's sailors encounter on Skull Island because a relationship is at stake and you care about it. In contrast, as when Carl, Jack, and crew encounter the sauropod stampede, and the monstrous insects, spiders, and other arthropods, while as technically accomplished as the T-rex battles, I think the action actually becomes a little bit wearisome and dull because we are less interested in them. We appreciate the time Kong and Ann find to spend together on the island and despair when Carl and company finally chloroform and capture the rampaging ape for transport, and Ann futilely screams to leave him alone.

In a departure from the original 1933 movie, and even in the 1976 movie, Ann is not present when Kong is shackled and on display in a New York theater. Protesting Kong's humiliating captivity, Ann instead returns to her acting company. Kong (comically) winces at the phony actress tied up in front of him in a parody of the Skull Island sacrifice of Ann. But of course nothing can sever their friendship; again, Kong breaks free, causes considerable property damage, and somehow (how, exactly?) reunites with Ann. Despite the rampage, I think you feel sorry for Kong, cast loose and alone in a terrifying and wintry neon civilization with only Ann to which to turn. Together again, they manage to enjoy a Central Park interlude and even a sunrise view from the Empire State Building before the military and the biplanes cruelly shatter the magic.

Again, many viewers felt KK2005's length hamstrung the movie. I disagree; it gave the movie breathing room to not only develop a deep friendship, but also a rousing exotic adventure, a conservation-minded treatise, some natural horror, a Depression-era time capsule, and the fleshing-out of an archetype. To get the most out of this movie, give it time to let it carry you away and console you with the fact that in spite of everything, Kong and Ann will always have Skull Island and New York.

Now for some random (and fanciful) observations:

1. The sauropods that Carl and company encounter and eventually cause to stampede do not look like Brontosaurs (Apatosaurs). They look like Camarasaurs with the boxy, deep heads. It was a shame to see such a magnificent herd hurdle off the cliff. By the way, being in the middle of that stampede, it was a miracle none of Denham's party gets trampled.

2. As other posters as noted, the rough, brutal way Kong handles Ann as he crashes and fights his way through the island should have turned her into a shapeless mass of protoplasm.

3. Again, we have the $64,000 question: after chloroforming Kong, how did Carl and company float Kong to the ship and transport him thousands of miles to New York? I don't think Kong could even fit on or in the ship. Only the 1976 version of King Kong answers that question by hauling him in a colossal oil tanker.

4. The Central Park sequence where he plays on the ice pond with Ann is beguiling but doesn't make much sense. Unless the pond were frozen all the way to the bottom, wouldn't Kong's estimated 20 tons have broken through? Also, as a tropical animal, wouldn't the New York winter have been uncomfortable, in spite of his fur?

5. If Jackson really wanted to do a homage of ""Titanic"", he should have begun his picture in the present day. For example, he could have had a road crew discover a mysterious, giant skeleton while digging up a street. Archeologists and scientists are baffled, until an aged Ann Darrow arrives and identifies the skeleton as Kong. Then, with tears in her eyes, she begins her sad tale.

6. Now that Skull Island is no longer a myth, Carl Denham could have recouped his losses by developing a wildlife park (oh, wait, that's Jurassic Park!).",1302652800,,5910,4.899

7602132,3,B01AHWLX2O,"I watched the Extended Version with my family last night on Blu-ray.  Effects and sound quality  and visual effects are great it is a good film but not the best Kong film made.

The effects dominate the movie over the story and in the end make this less than a classic rendition of a classic story.  What would have made this a five start film and a classic for all times would have been better focus on the story which goes deeper than the ""Beauty Killed the Beast"" theme that does stand out.  The Skull Island sequences could have been about 25 minutes shorter so that 25 minutes could have been used to develop the story better. Most of that part shows the men out to save the girl getting beat up many more times than needed.  The story is not about the men looking for the girl, yet there are five separate moments where the men get run over, charged at, swallowed alive, and swarmed by bugs. All nice if the point of the story was to highlight how hard it is to save a girl.  But since it takes so long to get through the Skull Island portion, other important theme development gets a short shift.  As soon as the ape is subdued, we fast forward to opening night of his performance in New York. So much is left out from this point forward. The fact that the girl refused to play the role of the sacrifice at Kong's opening in New York is only briefly mentioned as if an afterthought. Why did she refuse?  Of course we all know because we know the story, but it is still important and gets completely left out. The older versions of this movie spent the time to make the audience feel the emotional attachment between the girl and the ape. They were allowed to feel the irony that while they should hate the ape, instead they feel for the ape and instead see that humans are the real evil.  That is the story.  But Cameron leaves all that in the dust and what we are left with is a visually stunning and special effects driven feature film that is very shallow and superficial.

If the special effects were anything less than stunning, this film would have been a campy failure.  But because the effects are so darn good, this film gets by with the over the top gore and the poorly told story. It is a shame because this good movie could have been so much more.",1300665600,,2266,4.278688524590164

When I bought the disc I read the back. It mentioned an art gallery. I thought, ""Great, some high definition artwork to enjoy!"". Instead viewers are slapped in the face with what appears to be abismally small thumbnails that pop up WHILE WATCHING THE MOVIE!! From what I could understand from the already terrible user interface was you had to play the movie to see the artwork in the corner of the screen. If there was another way to view them the disc fails because I couldn't find the options and I'm usually pretty savvy at finding the right button if its there.

The user interface is pretty disgusting. It might look slick but it is full of issues. Sometimes its impossible to determine what you've selected to watch, the Extended or Theatrical version, WHO KNOWS the menu doesn't highlight it properly. The U-Control idea?? Rubbish! Just let me choose at the beginning. A making of feature would've been nice.

The lack of a proper art gallery really irks me cos its part of the reason why I bought the disc. I suppose they want us to buy the artwork book seperately. Very lame and cheap of them in my book.

7602136,1,B01AHWLX2O,"Besides the fact that I liked both the original and the 1976 version and that this one stinks in comparison, there are two main reasons why I hated this movie.
1. Jack Black.  I don't know how the rest of you feel, but Mister Black has thoroughly overstayed his welcome in the public arena.  I cannot stand him.  I couldn't stand him six years ago.  When will he shuffle on back to his little ""band"" and his core audience of frat boys?
2. Naomi Watts' character.  In the original, Ann Darrow wants to get the hell away from Kong.  She wants to see him killed.  But in this version, she loves Kong and doesn't want him killed.  For those of you who think Peter Jackson has tapped into the spirit of the original and that the 1976 version is an aberration, you just consider that.  Jackson's film has far more in common with 1976 than 1933.
Then there are minor qualms: Adrian Brody and his nose, the black dude on the ship who says every last line as if he's pissed off, the nonsense about ""The Heart of Darkness,"" the fact that there really was no need for a plot at all: just as with Jurassic Park, I would have enjoyed watching the CGI dinosaurs without the bother of any human characters' presence.",1297555200,6,1201,4.349775784753363

In the old days, they made over-the-top musicals and these days it's over-the-top animation. Also, the CGI just doesn't look real (it never does) but the whole thing is processed in a kind of drab blueish hue to try and meld reality with the CGI world and it just looks murky to me.

7602139,2,B01AHWLX2O,"The year was 1933.  A fantastic black-and-white movie called ""King Kong"" was released.  It's one of the great movies of all time.

The year was 1976.  A fantastic color remake of ""King Kong"" was released.  It was a huge box office success with a great score by John Barry.  Don't let anybody tell you it wasn't a successful movie and didn't make any money.  Quite the contrary.  Research the facts.  In my case, I didn't even need to research it because I remember how huge King Kong was in 1976.  I saw it in the theater.  It was a box office smash.

The year was 2005.  A remake was done of ""King Kong"".  I guess this is a remake of the 1933 movie?  But wait... I guess it was a remake of the 1976 movie as well.  Let me see here.........the 1976 movie just wasn't a success apparently.  Maybe the special effects weren't good enough?  Maybe they weren't good enough to satisfy the CGI and video game-loving young people of today?  Maybe that's it.  Not only that, but the 1933 film must be REALLY inferior in the special effects department, not to mention it's in black and white.  Ouch!  Fewer and fewer people like black and white movies nowadays.  I guess the 1933 and 1976 movies didn't do the job.  So..............

We got another remake.  LOADED with CGI effects to please the computer and video game generation.  A CGI King Kong instead of a ""claymation"" (to use the term loosely) Kong from 1933 and a guy in an ape suit from 1976.  With the click of a mouse, we get Kong as he SHOULD look, apparently.

Now about this movie.....

Kong himself doesn't look scary at all.  The scariest Kong was in the 1976 movie, then the 1933 movie, in my opinion.  Then we see a long, drawn out fight between Kong and THREE dinosaurs.  This fight is so ridiculous, it left me with my jaw on the floor, staring at the TV in disbelief.  That's the key word - disbelief.  This fight is not at all believable.  It seems every few seconds there's a close call where Kong rescues and protects Ann in the nick of time.  Not only that, but he's fighting the dinosaurs with Ann in his hand a lot of the time.  Not only that, but the jumping around, the falls the characters take, etc. is so non-realistic.  This whole fight sequence is just plain over the top and not believable at all.

What is Ann made of, anyway?  Kong seems to fling her around like she's a rubber band.  A good example is when he flings her onto his right shoulder.  She doesn't get injured at all as a result of this?  This movie comes off as a video game most of the time.

When Kong is on top of the Empire State Building, at one point he jumps up to try to grab one of the biplanes.  I can't imagine that anybody or any thing would do that while on top of the tallest building in New York City and not be concerned about possibly losing their footing and falling.  Another thing - after Kong falls from the top of the Empire State Building, Ann is just standing there like it's nothing to have high winds blowing against her.  I don't know about you, but I would think that the average person would be very concerned about the high winds blowing at them thousands of feet above the ground and the person would likely be hanging on to something for dear life.  Anyway...

This movie seems to follow the formula of the 1933 movie mostly.  The 1976 movie, on the other hand, doesn't copy the 1933 original totally.  Instead, some changes were made - some big, some small.  The '76 movie had a little campiness to it, but not too bad.

This movie is a loooooonnnnng three hours +.  A full hour could have been cut from it.

All in all, I like the 1933 and 1976 movies.  This 2005 movie was an unnecessary remake.",1285200000,5,3671,4.308370044052864
7602140,4,B01AHWLX2O,"My review of Peter Jackson's King Kong remake will include my opinions about the film and discuss the extensive amount of bonus material on this extended three disc set, so if you're still interested grab a seat cause were just getting started.

I've never had any special attachment to the King Kong franchise, but I have always found the premise intriguing and a joy to watch. I have seen the original stop motion cinema classic, the unappreciated 1976 remake and now the most recent 2005 remake by director Peter Jackson. And if I had to choose from the three, I would honestly choose this version. Now you may be angry but please let me explain why, I'm not saying this version is without its flaws, there are many but I personally found the bond between Ann Darrow and Kong better than the original classic. In the original film despite Kong saving her numerous times she's still terrified and screams almost constantly. But of course it was an older film and that film is still superior to most horror/adventure films to this day. And like I said, it was a horror film, in horror films women scream... a lot. But now times have changed and today's movie plot's have changed and I think this remake came at a good time. Another reason I appreciate this film is because Peter Jackson grew up a big fan of the original classic and he had a passion for this project, and you can tell by the finishing product. To me this film felt like following several different sub stories. Ann's struggle finding work as an actress, and her struggle to survive after being captured by Kong, Carl Denham's who is struggling as a film director and feels he has a chance to revive his career if he can find ""Skull Island"" and film it, Jack Driscoll's love for Ann and of course Kong's, who is a lonely animal and probably the last of his species. But there are also many other sub plots with the men of the ""Venture"" and they are also interesting to follow.

But to me the most important reason why this is my favorite Kong film is because I became emotionally attached with Kong, I felt sorry for this beast that had no escape while fighting off the airplanes at the top of the empire state building and the reason is because of the incredible, and I do mean incredible special effects. King Kong and the creatures all look absolutely fantastic, and Kong's eyes really have emotion in them. But we can't give all the credit to special effects, many of Kong's life like emotions from the film came from Andy Serkis, who helped with the movements and facial expressions for Kong and there is some very interesting footage of Andy acting as Kong in the bonus material. You really have to see the creatures of Skull Island for yourself, to the gigantic insects or the mega ton dinosaurs they all just look so life like. But unfortunately I do have some complaints, but before I complain yes I do know this is a film from Hollywood, it's just a movie and King Kong is a ridiculous film if it's taken seriously. But how in the world does Ann not get crushed by Kong?! During the huge fight with the ""V"" Rex he's fighting three, THREE V Rexes while holding her during much of it. And when Kong, Ann and the V Rex family get tangled in the vines after they fall off the cliff she at one point is holding on to a V Rexes tooth. I mean, this makes the movie so unbelievable that you can't take any of these scenes seriously. And I also found all the fight scenes on Skull Island to get repetitive. At one point there is a creature attacking while the Venture crew is paddling across the swamp, the crew falling into a pit and getting attacked by huge insects, Kong fighting the V Rexes, and a couple other prehistoric type creatures that attack but it feels like it comes at you all at once. I understand these scenes being in the movie, but if shortened and spread out I think it would make the journey through Skull Island more believable and a little less repetitive. Oh, and don't get me started on the islander's, I just found them annoying, and they just got tiresome and I'm glad they are not in the film much. Well I'm worn out, let's discuss the DVD set.

For this DVD and this DVD only you get around thirteen minutes of extra footage during the movie that was not originally featured during its theatrical release, and that reason alone is a great reason to buy this DVD, but the makers of this DVD didn't stop there, but I'll get into that later. Now, the film is spread out on to two discs, as well is the commentary, but it didn't bother me at all actually. When you finish the first half of the movie on disc one you can just pop in disc two and it will have a menu that asks if you want to continue the film or commentary immediately or if you just want to go to the main menu, and really, are we all so lazy that we can't just place another disc in? We are?! Oh...well it probably won't bother you. The commentary with Peter Jackson is incredibly interesting as well, and pretty funny actually.  And also included are around forty minutes of deleted scenes with introductions with Peter Jackson. But that is just the beginning, there is also a hysterical gag reel entitled the Eighth ""Blunder"" of the World and there are a couple other goofy featurettes with the cast. But if you want to find out information about how the film was created, pop in disc three. There are so many lengthy and interesting documentaries you will just be amazed. In a category called ""Re-creating the Eighth Wonder"" the Making of King Kong, you will find several twenty to forty minute documentaries that discuss Pre-production, filming the Venture Journey, creating and filming Skull Island, creating New York In New Zealand and the crew's visit to New York, and of course the development of Kong himself. The information is so extensive that the approximate running time is around two and a half to three hours. And if you still aren't satisfied there are featurettes that pay tribute to the original King Kong and the resemblances with the original and the 2005 remake, there also is a featurette about the collectibles created during the release of King Kong, video galleries, trailers and some selected Pre-Visualization Animatics from the movie. And if you aren't satisfied after all of these fascinating bonus features...I'll be at a loss for words.

Everyone has mixed feelings about this movie as do I, but I think Peter Jackson did an excellent job at capturing Kong not just as a ferocious beast, but as a caring and lonely creature, and if you want to find out how King Kong was made this three disc extended edition is a highly recommended buy.",1283040000,3,6629,4.511647254575707
7602141,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Even though this is the second remake of the original King Kong, Peter Jackson did a wonderful job. This is how you do a remake. A definite must-get!",1282867200,,149,4.357142857142857
7602142,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson's remake of the 1933 King Kong is exactly how to do a remake. This movie keeps to the spirit of the original, whilst including state of the art special effects and exciting action scenes. Jackson didn't try to add any silly plot twists or change the setting to 2005, but rather set out to remake the original film as it stood. He deserves a lot of credit for resisting the urge to ""improve"" the basic plot structure and settings of the original King Kong.

The only significant change Jackson made to the plot arch of the original is that Ann Darrow is no longer a vapid blonde yelling her head off, but rather an empathetic, subtle person who is genuinely moved by Kong's pain. This makes the movie much more emotionally sophisticated and interesting than its predecessor - and one of the few times when a remake truly does improve upon the original.

And what a remake. I thought the casting, effects, and soundtrack were great in setting the mood (Naomi Watts was perfect as the new Ann Darrow). The native Skull Islanders were absolutely creepy - a far cry from the silly natives in the 1933 version. Best of all, Kong himself looks superb, both realistic and empathetic. I nearly cried when he died.

Sure, the plot is contrived and it's filled with ""Hollywood moments"" of unrealistically impeccable timing. But at the end of the day, like its predecessor, this movie is about finding wonder in the world (or the movies). King Kong shows the epic struggle between the exotic, capitalism, and modern society - on unfortunately in which the exotic Kong meets his demise.

My only criticism of the movie is that sometimes the action can become too drawn out - one epic battle after another, after another... All of them are very well done and will get your adrenaline pumping. It might be too much for some people though. I love watching this movie once every few years, but could never watch it much more than that.

The best thing I can say about this movie is that it makes the original obsolete - Jackson's remake captures everything great about the original, while updating the special effects and filling it with an even better cast. Bravo!",1282435200,2,2162,4.664041994750656

On another level, Mr. Jackson renders a rather cynical (albeit accurate) view of humanity; greedy, perfidious, and brutal.

The film amalgamates action, sci-fi, horror, and romance masterfully...quite an accomplishment. Jackson had been ruminating on this story (the 1933 version being his favorite film) for most of his life, and it shows.

An imperfect masterpiece that dwarfs the 1933 classic. Truncate the first 40 minutes and the excess in the insect pit...perfect.",1280275200,,708,5.537037037037037
7602145,5,B01AHWLX2O,"KING KONG

I remember watching the original Kong film back in the day and every one that followed and could not help but be entertained by every one although the first was the best. I have always enjoyed Kong films and have only rooted against him when he took on the greatest of all time in Godzilla. So after years of nothing new when this film was announced I was actually excited about it when normally I would be like ""oh man they are going to ruin it"". But I had a feeling I was going to like it plus it would introduce Kong to a new audience who may have never watched him before [I will forgive newborns this once but even they should know who Godzilla is, just being born is no excuse for not seeing a Godzilla film]. Of course once I heard Peter Jackson was directing I knew it was in good hands, he was always one of my favorite filmmakers.

Of course we all know the story behind Kong and there have been various Kong movies made but  it remains the same. A boat ride to an island while a movie is being made and they happen upon some natives that worship a very large gorilla. Of course that  is the story in the simplest terms because there is much more depth than that. There are love stories going on, an adventure tale and so much more. I think it is that well balanced mix that has made not only the original a classic but this remake as well. I will say from the beginning that I truly believe that this film is indeed a classic remake or not, Peter Jackson did a remarkable job with this film.

Failing filmmaker Carl Denham [Jack Black] is looking for something big that will send him into superstardom, he may just have heard of the place to do that but first he must convince some investors to back him. Unfortunately they decline so Carl does what any ambitious person would do, steal everything and go on the run hoping to leave before they can catch him. In doing so he meets a young actress named Ann Darrow [Naomi Watts] and convinces her that she is perfect for the part of his female lead. He also tricks his writer Jack Driscoll [Adrien Brody] into getting stuck on the boat therefore having to go along as well. When they make it to the island [only a few even knew about it] they are surprised by a vicious tribe of natives that want a sacrifice for something very big that lives in the jungle.

When Ann is taken by this unseen creature the crew and such go after her going on the adventure of a lifetime. It is during this time that the film switches from a drama into an adventure flick and all kinds of crazy things happen. From giants to creatures to vicious terrain these people must make their way through it to find the girl. Now I am sure that you all know at least that the girl is found and brought back to New York. But there is something else that is brought back with her, and that is the mighty Kong. Kong is brought back to be a tourist attraction and labeled as one of the marvels of the world. But it is here that everything goes sour for everyone in NY and leads to the infamous final scenes of the Kong films involving Kong, a girl, a building, and some planes.

I have to say that remake or not this could easily be in the best films of all time and to be honest it could have swept the Oscars and rightfully have done so. But it was not nominated enough in my opinion, it did when 3 for what it was nominated for. The thing I was most surprised at was that Jack Black was not even nominated for best supporting actor, I still think he could have easily won it. Speaking of that the acting in this film is wonderful and fits the time period it is told in. the film has that old school classic Hollywood style and the acting matches it. Like I said Jack Black surprised a lot of people with this film, he did a great job taking his comedic style out and adapting the high energy he gives off in those performances into the maniac he plays in this. Also Adrien Brody does a marvelous job here and gives another career performance here, he was perfectly cast much like Black. Naomi Watts brings that classic Hollywood style to this film and likewise does an excellent job here, she comes off as the classic beauty. Thomas Kretschmann, Colin Hanks, Andy Serkis, Evan Parke and well everyone in this film give excellent performances.

Peter Jackson and his fellow writers did an excellent job with this film making it more that just a new age remake that is full of nothing but action. The film is full of multi dimensional characters, action, drama, romance, adventure, and well everything you can think of. The film transitions from comedy to drama during the first part of the film into a voyage film out on the sea into a horror/adventure film on the island, all the way back into a drama and romance flawlessly. It truly is amazing how Jackson and company were able to so with this film and this extended edition only adds to the magical film that is ""King Kong"".

This three disc extended addition not only adds to the scenes in the film it also adds to the extras as well. Over three discs we are treated to some of the best special features I have ever seen on any release. There are some of the best behind the scenes and making of features that have ever been released as well as some great additional extras like a short film that the cast made for Jackson for his birthday. That film is also very well done and very funny. Of course there is an excellent commentary by Peter Jackson as well as so much more that only add to the replay value of this release.

I highly recommend owning this 3-disc extended edition because not only is the film great but the extras alone make this worth owning. I paid top dollar but now you could find it cheap used or something but I wouldn't let it go. My brother and I watched this again not to long ago and had a great time doing so. KIA thanks for bringing this back to my attention.",1278892800,,5882,4.2672645739910315
7602146,2,B01AHWLX2O,"Clarification: I enjoy immensely most of Peter Jackson's material. The following does not discount that, merely points to the most in that statement.

Good points:

Peter Jackson directed it. Thus it has excellent use of the epic film style.
Beautiful actress to play the classic damsel in distress, with a solid acting performance to back it up.
For once, excellent serious acting on Jack Black's part.
Solid near flawless computer graphics for every scene requiring it.
Fantastic musical score that seamlessly fit into every scene.
Wonderful lighting.
Beautiful scenery.
Life-like visuals on the ape's part.

So, why 2 stars?

Bad points:

Should have been broken into three seperate movies, one entitled: ""Before the Island"", second entitled: ""At the Island"", third entitled: ""After the Island"". Each would have been a short, but still close to normal length film.
Editing was a serious problem with this film. Given full reign, Peter Jackson seems to not know the meaning of the word: concise. Rambling, repetative, beating the dead horse, chopping the wood after it is already sawdust, these are good analogies for this film. One bug scene was enough, thank you. Two was far past pushing it. Then to have the dinosaur smushing, then the three! T-Rex dinosaur fight with the big ape...and so on.
To clarify once more, I saw this in theatres. I finished my drink rather early on, thus at three hours and five minutes I was a little antsy and thought, I'll wait two more minutes, they should be done shooting the big ape then. Two minutes later, nopeallright havetoleave. Five minutes after that, afraid I had missed the end of this long, agonizing movie, I slipped back in the theatre and saw the planes still buzzing the big ape. I realize the creature is massive, but how many large caliber bullets does it take to knock this thing out?!

So, there you have it. A possibly wonderful movie, with excellent points all around, brought low by seriously bad editing. Then to find out that they extended it for the DVD!",1276646400,3,2018,4.885964912280702

7602148,2,B01AHWLX2O,"What a disappointment. Mr. Jackson, more is not better. Here's my list of what is wrong with this movie:
1. Everything before getting to Kong Island. Before this was over, I was almost asleep. I'm a cheap-ass Scot. I'm resentful of paying good money for a movie and then going to sleep during it! That hasn't happened to me since The Dark Crystal.
2. Naomi Watts NEVER shuts her mouth! Is she a mouth breather? Did Jackson direct her to always look pensive? After an hour (when I woke up), I was OCDing over this.
3. Adrien Brody's nostrils are too big. What else can I say. Doesn't look good when I'm sitting in the theater looking up at a giant projection.
4. The chase scenes go on and on and on... Seriously, dogs won't chase cars this far. I'm not sure why, but there's a reason for this.
5. Shooting bugs off some one with a machine gun!!?? I can believe a 50 ft. ape, living dinosaurs, surviving a nuke in a fridge, but this goes beyond the Pale.
6. Jack Black outruns a herd of dinosaurs. See # 4.
7. King Kong is not scary, he's kind of cuddly. When you've got 21st Century special effects and fail to make a threatening monster something ain't right. For a director to have such an opportunity and then blow it is just plain sad. But Jackson had no one to blame but himself.",1275004800,4,1284,4.288065843621399

7602152,3,B01AHWLX2O,"This review is based on my original viewing of the King Kong DVD and I have to say that while I'm sure that the Blu-ray is gorgeous, I have a problem with Jack Black. The character of Carl Denham should have had a different actor. Jack Black, while I have no reason to doubt that he seems to be a funny comedian, lacks any serious acting skills to pull off this character as being believable.

Hollywood continues to remake classic television shows or remake movies like that of King Kong and Godzilla and end up failing to deliver a quality product. The problem is that Hollywood directors like to transform classic properties into a comedy movie and everytime they do this, they always manage to create a piece of crap that fails to give Hollywood any good standing. Starsky and Hutch, Charlie's Angels, Bewitched, Brady Bunch, The Flintstones ... they were all pale imitations, at best. The problem is that King Kong employs a whole cast of serious actors and Jack Black tries so hard to at serious acting that he often falls flat on his face.

Robin Williams, Jim Carey ... even George Carlin, all serious and very funny comedians, managed to develop a serious acting side and pulled together some very good dramatic movies and they even succeeded at expanding their talents as serious actors. However, Jack Black needed to showcase this side of his acting ability and he simply fails miserably. Here, he seems to be a round peg trying to fit into a square.

The one thing I have to credit is Peter Jackson who producing a very good movie. However, in trying to create a different movie, I think maybe made a bad casting mistake in regards to Jack Black. Two and one half hours was bad enough but now everyone gets to agonize through over three hours of bad acting from Jack Black. I can think of better King Kong movies to watch than his bad acting.",1268179200,,1854,4.561561561561562

7602154,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I am hard pressed to think of any greater remake of a classic film! Peter Jackson pays homage to the original blockbuster film KING KONG of 1933. So many scenes, down to the nuances are remade to perfection in this classic. The acting is fantastic and the action is unbelievable. Some of the greatest CGI work of our time is done in this film. You will believe this 25' ape is living and breathing on screen with Naomi Watts. If you have never seen the original, it is a story of a filmaker that sets sail for a prehistoric island. This place where civilized man has yet to step foot, where mysterious wonders await. When the damsel in distress is captured she is offered up to Kong as a sacrifice. The crew saves her and captures the beast for display and profit. Soon Kong is loose and recaptures the fair maiden. This leads to one of film's alltime great moments as Kong battles bi-planes at the top of the Empire State Building!

King Kong is a classic and Peter Jackson's love for it, is on full display. The movie is long as it should be. Great storytelling should never take shortcuts! A must own for any movie lover!

NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Universal does it again! The picture and sound are breathtakingly beautiful. This disc gives you both the theatrical and extended versions.

7602155,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I, like almost everyone else, watched the original King Kong on tv while growing up and enjoyed it greatly.  I still marvel at what they were able to accomplish in this film way back in 1933.  However while I admire the orginal Kong, I absolutely love Peter Jackson's remake and consider it a masterpiece.
First of all, this is a film that must be seen on a big screen.  I saw it twice in the movies and watched the blu-ray today on my 52 inch tv.  It still loses something although the picture and sound are crystal clear.
I love everything about this film from the incredible job Jackson and the Production Designers did in recreating 1932 New York City to the masterful job the special effects technicians did on Kong and the incredible emotions that they were able to show on his face.  The action scenes are incredible especially a wild Brontasaurus stampede, a battle between Kong (while holding Naomi Watts in his hand) and 3 Tyranasaurus Rexes and the final confrontation between Kong at the top of the Empire State Building and about 10 World War 1 byplanes.  (The high-up shot of Kong falling off the building with several planes flying high above him was so beautifully done that it actually made me queasy while watching it in the movies.) The three leads are excellent: Naomi Watts, absolutely lovely as Ann Darrow and boy can she run, Adrien Brody, not exactly your average leading-man, but very good as Jack Driscoll and Jack Black, an actor that I don't usually care for, perfect as Carl Denham.  (Perhaps since Denham is basically a despicable character in this film, the fact that I do not like Jack Black made this perfect casting.)
The additional scenes on this blu-ray are excellent and never should have been cut: a vicious triceratops attack and a terrific and scary scene involving a vicious underwater creature picking the men off as they are rafting through the jungle.  (I can't imagine how much hard work went into this sequence, only for it to be cut.)  The music for this film by James Newton Howard is excellent, the Oscar winning special effects almost beyond belief.
This film did not do all that well during its Christmas release, it was soundly beaten by the first ""Narnia"" movie.  Thats too bad because I consider it to be a masterpiece and can't imagine how difficult it must have been to make.  But then again Peter Jackson had plenty of experience making difficult films since he made this one right after completing the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, 3 epic films that I look forward to seeing released on blu-ray also.",1266278400,2,2557,4.672605790645879

Without question, all the special effects are up with Peter Jackson's other films. I just wish a lot more thought had gone into the original story, and also wouldn't it be nice to see some genuinely great characters and true epics from mr Jackson. All of his films are full of childish wannabes and fantasy heroes who just don't cut it for me.

This story's well-known to most people, but does anyone else get annoyed by the complete lack of appreciation for nature? Seriously, to a giant gorilla, a blonde bombshell will be not much more than a stinky little cockroach. And I emphasize stinky. You know the way most other animals smell unpleasant to humans.

I mean it's one thing to get an extraterrestrial pet for Christmas, you may get emotionally attached to it, but I struggle to believe you would fall in love with its ""beauty"", which would have zero effect on you, because that's how nature works.

And another thing, this poor King Kong fellow must have been desperately bored to even pay attention to a hairless little creature. I mean what the hell happened to all the other gorillas? Hello??? It's called a species? You know, mum and dad, siblings, a harem of females etc.

7602164,5,B01AHWLX2O,"King Kong: 8 out of 10: Peter Jackson's Kong is a long love letter to the original movie that surprisingly turns into that rarest of crowd pleasers. A movie that both men and their gals will like. Like Titanic, Kong has enough action to keep boys of all ages happy and a romance (complete with tragic ending) to get the ladies crying.

And what a romance. Kong and Naomi Watts light up the screen with that most famous of dysfunctional cross species parings. And while you may be mumbling Stockholm Syndrome at the beginning (Not to mention whiplash, jeez Jackson turn down the rag doll physics on the Naomi Watts CGI effect. The way Kong flings her around she should end the film in a body cast) the romance seems to win even the cynics (yours truly) at the end.

The rest of the cast is also top notch with Jack Black playing an Orson Wells style director so well it is almost freighting. Speaking of frightening many people wondered aloud how Jackson would handle the racist caricature (by today standards) of the island natives especially considering the whole disturbing white wizard versus the ""dark forces"" subtext of the LOTR films. Not to worry the embarrassing stereotypes of happy dancing black people are mocked in the Kong stage show putting that embarrassing Hollywood episode to rest.

Instead the residents of Skull Island are some of the scariest people ever put on film. Pushing the PG-13 rating to the limit they put the can back in cannibal. It's nice to see natives bashing skulls, going into voodoo trances and kidnapping white woman they invoke the much happier stereotype of the true island savage. Hell they are scarier than the ape.

Possible racial insensitivity aside Kong is far from perfect. While the special effects are overall top notch there are seams. For example when people run with the dinosaurs the limit of the green screen seems to show through (And could we get a moratorium on velociraptors in movies. They are really getting clich and being a relatively new paleontological find really don't fit in a thirties era Kong movie. Yes I know that isn't logical but they kind of seem modern as if a character had a cell phone).

The other real problem is length. This feels like the directors cut. With an easy 30 minutes of film that could (and probably should) end up on the cutting room floor. We spend so much time in various Kong free Broadway theaters one might mistake this for a Yankee Doodle Dandy remake.

""King Kong"" of 1933, with the extra features on the DVD, as well as the interesting 1976 remake, and only then this even more compelling 2005 version of the tale (with its DVD bonus extras), as well. As for that 1976 remake, by the way, it is a lot better, despite the highjinx and compromises of its production and original publicity, somehow adding up to more than its constituent parts, than all the catty remarks that have been made about it assess it to be! Regarding the 1933 ""King Kong"", I know rather well a family member of the R.K.O. proprietors' descendents, who lives quite comfortably off the fortune which the royalties of the 1933 film and other R.K.O. movies still generate, so the ""inside information"" which he conveyed to me regarding the R.K.O. studio's inner workings had increased considerably my curiosity about ""King Kong"". The sheer lore of ""King Kong"" on screen in its three full length motion picture versions fascinates but also certainly intimidates a writer to review any or all of these movies; I only am making a short and feeble attempt at the nagging urges and challenge of the good friend who showed me the three films. I'll limit my comments to some of my personal impressions of the three versions.

The 1933 motion picture stands up well to the comparisons. The R.K.O. production was of path-breaking importance to the history of cinema in many ways; the bold technical advances made in its filming, which impacted the motion picture industry so strongly, are utterly fascinating, and I would suspect that the 2005 movie, in its turn, already has furthered the art of film-making to at least some extent, even if not so crucially as the 1933 movie had done so. What interests me most, though, after having viewed the 1933, the 1976, and the 2005 films, is the characterisation of the actors in the principal roles (which differ somewhat in the naming, and even career types, of the personages), each ""take"" on the characters of this epic story having its own kind of validity.

The eponymous mega-ape itself, of course, entails a sophisticated resort to cinematic artifice to bring this character to screen. The 1933 film did this with a degree of sophistication that still commands respect, even compared to the 1976 mechanical ape. What sets off the 2005 achievement is how life-like the monster's facial expressions are and how the beast's muscular movements, even those of its hind-quarters, co-ordinate to convey how utterly simian King Kong is made to behave. The animation of the other prehistoric creatures of Skull Island does not match the detail of King Kong in any of the three films, but even the 1933 movie's screen beasts, all of them, surpass what one sees in such creatures in most films of the genre from as late as the 1950s or even the early 1960s. As for Kong's dizzying ascent of New York City's skyscrapers in the final confrontation of the mega-ape with ground and, especially, air forces in the film's climax on its then tallest of them, as giddy as all of these films make one feel atop the Empire State Building, it is this scene in the 2005 version that left me with the most thoroughly churned stomach and frightened feelings of vertigo.

My favourite character among the men of each movie's cast is the male romantic lead, Jack (or John) Prescott, who in 1933 is a virile but winsomely bashful senior member (Bruce Cabot) of the crew of the ship and and of its Skull Island expeditionary force, in 1976 a shaggy-headed, ruggedly but leanly handsome sort of ""green"" ecology activist and primate anthropologist (Jeff Bridges), and in 2005 a slim but lithe, reticently mannered, but romantically ardent writer of theatrical and screen plays (Adrien Brody). Bruce Cabot's impersonation is rather of the stolid and thoroughly sailor-like kind, as the script of the 1933 film requires, but he is believable and he does grow as a character when his love for Ann, his (and King Kong's) sweetheart, develops. Jeff Bridges is irresistibly physical and hiply handsome, quite up to any challenge that the human savages, the savage jungle, or the even more savage creatures therein, and New York City in chaos, all pose; his love for the female romantic lead is the most strongly and hormonally sexual in nature of any of the three films' male lead. For me, however, Adrien Brody's exquisite Jack is the most nicely detailed in portrayal, gently rakish, sensitive, and quite visibly head-over-heels in love with Ann right from the moment when he first encounters her. Brody succeeds in rising to the challenge of Jack's ordeals in the jungle and then in mayhem-beset New York City in a way that overcomes, convincingly, what one would expect of the slender, fit, but muscularly only modestly developped wordsmith as Brody embodies him.

Of the other male characters, the most endearing is Jimmy (Jamie Bell), the only partly reformed adolescent delinquent who is given another chance in setting his life on a positive course as the most junior member of the ship's crew and who proves his pluck ashore in the jungles of Skull Island; his part has no equivalent in the 1976 film, and so little in the 1933 movie that the character of Jimmy barely registers on the viewer's attention in that original version.  One of the low-key but most strikingly spooky moments in the film occurs when Jimmy explains to Jack (with an objectivity that is all the more dreadful for its calm) just how a victim's body really reacts when stabbed, whether fatally or otherwise.  A chill runs not only visibly through Jack but also through the viewer; this kid knows all about mayhem and murder from his own blade-wielding experience! Providing for me the single greatest urge to buy the DVD in this packaging, as a big fan of all things terpsichorean, is Jamie Bell's work in Jimmy's shipboard dance with Ann, youthfully vigourous and spryly fleet-footed, as glimpsed only briefly in the film as released, but which had been given in full as the scene was filmed so memorably during production, and included among the Extended 3-discs set's extra features (but not even in the Extended Version itself of the film). (Jamie Bell's considerable dancing talents had been in high profile in his first film, ""Billy Elliot"", in which Bell played the title role.) This dance number reminds me of the kind of salty antics of the traditional seafaring dancing (without female partner, of course, hence often danced solo), which even then was becoming rare among sailors, that I was lucky enough to observe aboard ship (only far better done in the movie!) when I was in the Navy during the Kennedy years (early 1960s).

The other male characters are of somewhat less interest to me (though surely not so to other viewers), although, among them, Robert Armstrong's irrepressibly mountebank Carl Denham of 1933 is the unsurpassed characterisation of his role. Compared to that actor, even Jack Black's amusingly Elton John like impersonation of Carl Denham in 2005, and certainly Charles Grodin as the crassly venture business entrepreneur Fred Wilson, the more-or-less equivalent character in the 1976 version, both pale by comparison to Armstrong's 1933 exuberant show-biz and adventure crazed portrayal of Denham.

Fay Wray as Ann Darrow in 1933 remains the most pschychologically convincing realisation of the role, waiflike but very pretty and perhaps the most consistently wary of Kong's fierceness. Jessica Lange (the equivalent, named Dwan, of Ann in the other versions) in 1976 is the most divergent in personality, so daffily and modishly ""airheaded"" during the voyage to Skull Island, but adapting to things adroitly once she finds herself in the jungle. Lange's Ann certainly is the most erotically attuned to Kong; her scene settling in to lounge in King Kong's ""Easy Boy"" armchair-like palm is the most visually striking moment for that gal in any of the three versions! It is Naomi Watts, playing Ann Darrow in 2005, who is the most alert to the sympathetically titanic-but-tender aspects of Kong's nature. All three actresses are of the same basic physical type, slenderly pretty but not big-bustedly bodacious as so many screen beauties have been. Kong gets to divest Fay Wray (with more sizzling effectiveness) and Jessica Lange of some of their clothes, but Kong displays less sexual curiousity about the Ann Darrow of Naomi Watts, the body of which actress, however, many human guys gladly would investigate very eagerly.

All three versions of ""King Kong"" are worthy of this tale's primal (and primate) appeal, even if it is the 1933 and 2005 movies' spectacular effects, respectively for early sound film and for later cinematography, which most immediately draw the attention of mass audiences to them. I found the storm scene in the 2005 film very gripping, and realistic, too (and this comment comes from a former sailor who, indeed, was in such storms at sea) when the rusty old scow of a ship copes successfully with the heaving ocean waters as the captain and crew struggle to keep the ship afloat while navigating it free of Skull Island's jagged contours.

All three films, the 1976 version included, well merit time spent watching them, as do the fascinating extra features that add so much to the value of the DVD issues of the 1933 and 2005 movies.",1258243200,2,9927,4.935368043087971

7602172,4,B01AHWLX2O,"Every Kong film has their ups and downs, but some of them can be a bit obvious. This new 2005 remake is probably slightly better than the original. Kong is given a more ferocious and more human appearance, while the CGI effects are top-notch. Naomi Watts, Jack Black, and Adrien Brody are absolutely amazing here (but they still can't top Wray, Armstrong, and Cabot). And the action is what you would expect from a Kong film, only that it's probably the most exciting we'll ever see when it comes to this version. But there are, as always, flaws. The sub-plot that involves Jimmy and Hayes was not needed at all: it slows the film down and it sometimes feels like it turns into a completely different movie. The references to the original 1933 film are clever, but there are too much of them in this film. They become irritating once we get into the third act. The music theme wasn't eerie and powerful enough; it could have been improved. And finally, having it all set in 1933 again makes it all a bit tedious. It could have been set in the late 30's or early 40's to make it look a bit unique.

But still, this is an ultimate Kong remake. It's got great effects, wonderful jungle settings, and a new and improved look for the ape himself. All three films (1933, 1976, and 2005) do have their own ups and downs, but I still like all three of them.",1254960000,2,1349,4.396

7602174,2,B01AHWLX2O,"I agree with the reviewer who said: ""just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.""

This movie begins well.  Naomi Watts is refreshingly subtle and the other cast members seem good.  The story gets a little muddled at times, but no worries, there's always the special effects to carry the movie.  Ah yes, the special effects.  Those ever growing special effects.  Bigger and badder than Kong himself.  In the beginning, they are used well to take the viewer back in time.  But once the story reaches Skull Island, forget the story and any sublimity; it all gets overdone.  Way overdone.  But as in cooking, in a photoplay you have to know when to let up.  You can't suddenly dump a bucket of chili powder in your tomato sauce to make good chili.

A light hearted adventure movie with great possibilities for scenery and reasonably fantastic creatures suddenly turns too menacing, with impossibly bleak occult and action scenes that no one would live with or through.  In a lesser example, my wife and I were laughing at all the guys who stayed on the log to get shaken off by Kong in a gloriously overdone rampage.  You gotta be smart to be believable.  People being chased don't stay on short bridges if they can help it, especially if someone has gone to the trouble to hold the line so they can escape.

Like so many action movies today, one feels the movie makers are trying to keep up with the giant amusement parks.  They need to take us to the imaginary, but also show a little restraint on the effects and keep it human, even develop the human relationships a little more to have a better balanced movie.  For instance, Ann and the writer on the boat--they mutter about in a couple of short encounters and then are suddenly in love.  They never have a real conversation.  At least have them standing on deck, leaning on the rail and looking at the sunset and discussing his play or something.  A counterpoint to the later sunset scene with Kong.

The story sets up several hints at interesting characters with intriguing personal stories.  The one indication that the script may turn into Hollywood nonsense is Mr. Driscoll being stuck in an animal cage.

Everything else seems to be going great until the big tree trunk over the ravine.  At that point, the script drops everything on the floor - characterizations, relationships, and depth - to focus on ridiculous scenes of grotesque deaths and stampeding bouncing dinosaurs (which are, in a way, hilarious in their absurdity).  Resolutions of all the interesting stories set up in the beginning become moot as characters are knocked off left and right.

The sole relationship of any depth is the strange Stockholm Syndrome pseudo-romance between Ann Darrow and King Kong.  Ann Darrow's on-again, off-again fascination with Kong is especially incoherent at the end of the movie.  Finally, with Kong splat on the concrete, all other relationships and many loose ends are left completely dangling.

7602178,5,B01AHWLX2O,"The story of King Kong is awesome.  As a fan of cryptozoology, I ask myself, would I have preferred they leave Kong alone (aside from rescuing the lady, of course)?  Or would I prefer they bring him to America so that we can all behold him?

What happens when we discover Bigfoot or any other legendary animal?  We'll be happy for a while and excited, but it will eventually become boring without the mystery.  Then again, wouldn't we all want to know?  I always appreciate thought-provoking movies that make me ask myself such questions.

Skull Island was a place untouched by time and technology.  We didn't know anything about it and so we assumed it didn't exist.  Ah, but it did exist.  Are there any such places out there?  We assume not.  Otherwise, we would already know about it, right?  There is no doubt many places out there we know nothing about (though it's anyone's guess as to what types of animals are to be discovered in such places).

I liked the original very much, but I felt this remake was far better.  King Kong's size was consistent in this version.  Skull Island and its inhabitant were far creepier in this version as well.  And Jack Black, though I'm not a fan, was great in this movie.

7602179,2,B01AHWLX2O,"It seems self-evident that any work of art is a product of its time. It also seems self-evident that there's no point in remaking a movie unless there was something wrong with the original, or you've found a new way to approach the material. (David Lynch's rework of ""The Fly"" meets both critieria very well. Ditto for ""The Thing"" which is not so much a remake as a ""make"".) The problem with Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" redo is that there's no way to ""improve"" on one of the greatest films ever made, without changing it beyond recognition.

To see the original ""King Kong"" as a technologically dated exercise that would have been ""so much better"" if only it had been made 70 years later, is to miss the way that the medium and the message * were inextricably linked in 1932. For example...

The scene in which we hear the unseen Kong tramping through the trees to Max Steiner's music, suddenly appearing in front of the screaming Ann, scares the s*** out of children (and not a few adults). It's one of the great cinematic moments, its effectiveness deriving from its in-your-face crudity. (No offense to Willis O'Brien or the Delgado brothers -- quite the opposite.) The original Kong wasn't a giant gorilla, but a horrifying id-monster portrayed by a frighteningly ugly stop-motion puppet.

In converting Kong into a realistic animal, Jackson has, at a single stroke, discarded the horrific and dream-like/nightmare elements that made the original a classic. Realism is not fundamentally frightening or horrific. If you don't understand this, watch ""Nosferatu"" or ""Vampyr"".

This realism, in turn, greatly weakens the original's ""beauty and the beast"" conceit. Ann's affectionate response to the big lug relects a late-20th-century view, fostered by NatGeo specials, that gorillas are intelligent, affectionate creatures -- not ugly, brutal, or automatically threatening. Fay Wray's Ann screamed her head off, overwhelmed by fear she would be killed or devoured. Naomi Watts' Ann, though frightened, sees Kong as a misunderstood critter. ""Who could ever learn to love a beast?"" Well, when you love a beast -- he's not a beast any more.

This is the film's fundamental error of re-conception -- Kong is no longer a rampaging monster, brought to his knees by Ann's irresistable European blondness. ** He is now a monster only in size, munching on bamboo, rather than Ann. The original Kong was a brutal beast throughout the story, allowing us a moment of cathartic pity when he's killed. The new Kong, sympathetic throughout, doesn't evoke this contrast of emotions. ""It was beauty killed the beast"" no longer makes much sense.

In describing the sacrificial maidens as ""brides"" of Kong, the original makes the not-so-subtle suggestion that Kong ""molests"" his victims before killing and eating them. (Kong's ripping off Ann's clothes to sniff them supports this, though Cooper and Schoedsack said they'd put this in because seen wild monkeys smelling human clothes.) But the new version has Ann showing a great deal of affection for Kong -- an affection which, if carried too far, would suggest beastiality, with Ann the perpetrator.

Another major failing *** is that ""economy of expression"" are not words in Jackson's vocabulary. He can't resist overdoing /everything/, simply because it's doable. If the original had /one/ disgusting creature, Jackson has three or ten or fifty. The scene in which Kong is gassed and Ann bids him ""farewell"" is ludicrously drawn-out and overdone, the restored ""spider pit"" sequence is -- like my movie reviews -- numbingly overlong **** -- and then there's the allosaur battle. I won't describe it, because I don't want to spoil your incredulous laughter at its utter preposterousness. It was at this point that whatever sympathy I had for the remake vanished.

The original was a model of terseness, starting slowly, but never stopping once it got up to speed. ***** The remake is not only overlong, but overwrought. Individual scenes and sequences run on for two or three times any reasonable length, to the point where the audience (this viewer, anyway) screams ""Get on with it!"".

Jackson's pacing isn't so hot, either. Cooper knew when to pause briefly, then pick up again. The first hour of Jackson's version (which is actually quite good) shows that he (mostly) understands ""structure"" and ""pace"", but the rest of the film is a hotch-potch of action scenes, without any sense of development or ""build"".

It's understandable that Jackson didn't want to exactly repeat the original, but too many iconic scenes have been lost, which seems inexcusable in a three-hour film: Kong smelling Ann's clothes; Kong choosing the wrong woman from the hotel, then throwing her to the street; Kong destroying the elevated train (Jackson's destruction of a street car doesn't come close to Cooper's ""German expressionist"" treatment). On the other hand, he exactly reproduces the few seconds of Fay Wray and Bruce Cabot running through the jungle, a delightful moment for those familiar with the original. Would that there had been more of this.

There is /one/ sequence that shows how good this film might have been. The initial encounter with the natives and Ann's subsequent capture is much superior to the original - far more atmospheric, better staged, and more exciting. Nothing else in the remake attains this level.

The BD was my second viewing of this film (the first having been on DVD). It clarified why I was offended. Jackson has so altered the original -- and not to much of a good end (other than getting rid of most of the silly dialog) -- that you sit there going ""No, no, no, no, no. This is /dumb/."" ""King Kong"" is less obnoxious the second time around, simply out of familiarity. That doesn't mean it's a good film, or that Jackson made the right dramatic or aesthetic choices. He didn't.

The original remains exciting (and silly). The remake is something worse than a bad film -- it's a pointless, overlong bore.

----------

 ""King Kong"" is nothing if not a great BD demo disk. Much of the film is just plain beautiful (though I do miss the Dor skies of the B&W original), and is, technically, one of the most-startling films you'll ever see. Kong really looks like a living animal, and all but a handful of the CGI effects (such as the failure of the rowboats to look as if they're actually making contact with the water) are seamless. One Amazon reviewer's claim that you can see the green screen in some shots (I assume he means a green nimbus around the foreground objects) is absurd.

The BD, unlike the DVD, has virtually no supplemental material, other than a running commentary. Jackson states that the commentary will try to steer clear of material presented in the supplements -- of which there are none. If you have one of the multi-disk DVD editions, you might want to hang onto it.

Science note... Neither the original nor Jackson's remake (the latter especially) pay any attention to the fact that a small island cannot support large a variety of creatures -- big ones, especially -- that need food to survive. The apatosaurs, in particular, would strip the island of its treetop vegatation in just a few months. (This has been observed in elephants.)

Another science note... Someone complained that Kong moves as if he were weightless. This is a common problem in CGI animation (see ""Shreck"" and ""Spider-Man""), but it isn't true here. The real problem is that Kong makes impossible leaps. The reason is that mass scales as the cube of body size, but stregth scales only as the square. If a normal-size gorilla can't leap several times the length of its body, I guar-on-tee one the size of Kong won't be able to do it, either.

Writer's note... Does it ever occur to directors to have someone vet their script for errors? One of the American producers follows Universal (the studio) with a plural verb, rather than a singular, in the ungrammatical British fashion. And the Army officer, griping about Kong's invasion of the ""sacred"" New York, calls him a ""mutant monkey"". Though the word dates to the turn of the 20th century, it was not in common use in 1932.

* Yes, yes, yes... Marshal McLuhan actually said ""The medium is the massage.""

** I was going to say Caucasian, but Caucasians are dark-haired.

*** How often does one encounter a film which can be described principally in terms of all the things wrong with it?

**** It has been reported that this scene, in which the sailors who fall from the log are eaten by creatures in the pit, so revolted some viewers that they walked out. Cooper and Schoedsack said the scene was removed because it brought the film to a dead stop. Jackson doesn't seem to be aware that a long, poorly paced scene can have the same effect.

***** There is probably no other movie in which most of the film is a continuous ""chase"" sequence, with barely a moment's rest. (""Speed"", perhaps.)",1251504000,4,8892,4.880636604774536

It's a pretty face, but there are entire scenes dedicated to her making soulful eyes at Kong, and getting the same in return. It's overdone to the point of near creepiness. They hammered at it until you start to wonder if the heroine has, well, certain issues.

There are high points. The ""traffic pileup"" of dinosaurs has to be seen to be believed, and the scene with Kong on ice managed to be genuinely touching and funny. Somewhere in here was a great one and a half hour movie. It just got lost under a vast, idealized, slightly creepy woman/ape relationship.

One warning for adults - the movie is clearly being pitched to kids, and uncritical kids at that. Crank suspension of disbelief to the maximum setting. An example: when they capture Kong, you are naturally wondering how they are going to manage to get Kong on a ship, and then have the ship survive with an angry Kong inside it for days of voyage. You're anticipating dramatic scenes. Forget it: the movie answers this by just skipping the whole question; the next scene is in New York. In the frantic rush to make Social Commentary (and/or get to the next soulful expression), some wonderful opportunities for genuine storytelling got brushed aside.

If you have kids who like their monsters big and strong, and occasionally repulsive; or someone who gets teary-eyed over what happens to monkeys in China (they get eaten), you might get something out of this.

No need to rehash the plot; what I will say is watching Kong unleashed in Manhattan, circa 1933, is fabulous and wondrous viewing.  Jackson spares nothing, from the gaudy neon lights, to the hot dog wagons.  And the climactic scene, atop the Empire State Building?  I suffer from acute acrophobia, so for me this scene was both excruciating, and spellbinding, to watch (which means Jackson made it all look so very real).

So why the four stars?  Well, the film takes much too long to get going, and it doesn't really start to move until Skull Island.  I love Jack Black, but here he is hopelessly miscast as an ethically-challenged filmmaker/promoter.  And Adrien Brody looks more like Napolean Dynamite than a leading man, but that's just me.  I will say Naomi Watts looks right at home resting in Kong's paw, yet the ""love story"" in this respect definitely tweaked the ""ick"" factor.  But to heck with all that.  Peter Jackson's got the chops to make a great cinematic product, and KING KONG squarely fits the bill.

The girl should have been killed 10 times over during the fight scenes with the dinosaurs.  Brody should have been attacked before finding the girl.  It goes on and on.  The insect pit was a waste of time and contributed NOTHING to the story - it's only a chance to show off the latest technologies.  This was a pure endulgence for Peter and WETA, and nothing more.  I am very disappointed that the priorities of this movie were so far off base.  Everything looked so CGI, except Kong, believe it or not.  That's where they went wrong.  Had Peter just focused on the main story line, and not gotten side tracked with cheap thrills and gross outs, we would have a much better movie.

7602193,2,B01AHWLX2O,"Don't mess with a legend.
Especially a movie so iconic and mythical as the original l933 King Kong. The reason its become a much beloved legend,TV staple is that it only runs 112 minutes and it moves so fast that you just sit there, stunned, as the excitement builds steadily until that unforgettable death of King Kong.

Peter Jackson spent over 200 million dollars on this nearly 4 hour epic--when at least two hours could have easily been cut. Instead, we spend nearly an hour, stuck in the beginning in NYC, as we watch long, never-ending backstories of each of the main characters.

Then we have to watch a miserably miscast gallery of performers. All of them are talented in their own way, but Naomi Watts is so atheletic and feisty as Ann Darrow that we can't really sympathize with her plight. It was Fay Wray's fragile but sensuous beauty that made her a perfect heroine. Jack Black is hideously midcast as voyage leader, Carl Denham. You keep waiting for him to break into one of his potty-saturated routines. Instead, he comes across as some smarmy, sneaky creep.

One grows incresingly bored at the long, never-ending shots of Naomi Watts face. She stares at Adrian Brody--her sweetheart--in long, endless takes. When she's not staring at Adrian Brody, she stares for endless minutes at King Kong. Toward the end, nearly half an hour is spent as the camera never leaves her staring face and then this is repeated with King Kong staring at Ann Darrow. Back and forth, stares galore, and I kept looking at the clock. Then we see Jack Black's face--with the camera studying his every pore as he stares intently at something beyond the camera range. One minute passes, then another, then a third of Jack Black's face--all for what?

The sequence that really made me groan in disbelief is the big moment when King Kong is unveiled at a NYC theater. Instead of Ann Darrow as the star performer, they have a fake Ann Darrow. The real one, for reasons never explained, is performing in a chorus line down the street. Wouldn't you expect that someone like Ann Darrow, a struggling stage performer, would want to share in the spotlight with King kong? Adrian Brody is also in another theater watching his drama unfold. Yet, throughout the movie, he has been one of the action characters, who helps bring Kong back to NYC. I couldn't imagine anyone in NYC at that time wanting to sit through a boring dramatic play when King Kong is being presented live just down the street.

If this movie had two hours pruned from it, this might save it, but for me, one time was much too much to watch this dazzling epic, that quickly bores with its illogic story line and staring performers.",1237075200,,2680,4.669491525423729
7602194,2,B01AHWLX2O,a big let down for me after the wonderfull LOTR trilogy from director jackson...  a lot of trouble has gone into this but ultimately the film falls way short of the mark lost amidst the cgi technology it seems determined to ram down your throat..it is like watching a computer game in parts.... a shame as it could have been so much better,1236902400,,339,4.380952380952381
7602195,4,B01AHWLX2O,"This movie was a pleasure to watch, from the cast to Kong himself. Jack Blacks role is off his usual comic self but still delivers a serious non-comic performance. The CGI in this film is nothing short of amazing and the sound is booms.

I recommend this movie especially in the Blu-ray format.

Enjoy",1235692800,,301,4.555555555555555
7602196,5,B01AHWLX2O,"With every element the stroke of an artist, Peter Jackson's rendering of the venerable classic was an act of love, managing to utilize the best in modern film techniques while maintaining an old-fashioned aesthetic.  Nail-biting adventure, outstanding special effects, a beautiful woman, idealistic hero, and a land that time forgot -- it's a masterwork of a film.  It took everything the original film was, then trumped it.  What did we love about the original when we were children?  Why, we loved the journey to a mysterious island, modern man doing battle and surviving against prehistoric monsters.  But in 1933, special effects were more difficult to incorporate without the effect itself becoming obvious.  Not so now.  So this is the film the original version would have been had the studio had the technology.  This is a fair assumption, considering that the studio in that day had devised every special effect conceivable and necessary to bring the creatures of the island to life.  A stellar achievement, but Jackson took it the rest of the way.

The crowning jewel in this masterpiece of thrills is Kong himself.  It was one of the most remarkable things ever, and one can only assume that it's the harbinger of even greater things to come as this technology advances.  Kong's face alone was the work of artists with an eye for living details, dabbed as it was with touches that bespoke of Kong's martial history prior to our arrival.  His scarred visage and an asymmetrical row of broken dentition were a tacit testimony of his struggle to keep his place at the top of a brutal hierarchy.  A brilliant touch.  Andy Serkis's motion-capture performance took full advantage of the cutting-edge animation, and brought Kong to life in a way previously unattainable.  The ape was more than some special effect.  He was a giant pet.

I've seen Jackson's movie about five or six times now, and this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blu-Ray-edition/dp/B001KZVQJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blu-Ray edition</a>&nbsp;twice.  Oh, man, if you thought it was something to behold in the SD DVD, you'll be astounded by the same lush beauty revealed in exquisite hi-def.  Some scenes, already so breathtaking in SD, engulf you now as you sit before a searing sunset, your eyes splashed with it.  And sweetening the deal further, this release includes both the theatrical version and the even better Director's Cut.  I'm happy to report that the longer cut wasn't a cynical ploy to sell Kong to us again by extending scenes or stretching out the battles.  Two new casualty-tallying confrontations with dinosaurs were restored to the narrative, one of which includes some expositional material on Carl Denham's deeper plunge into obsession.

As for special features, you have U-Control, through which you can access various picture-in-picture making-of featurettes.  From what I can tell, there's no way to play them without a P-in-P capability, unlike other Blu-ray discs that permit access straight from the menu.  Admittedly I haven't tried hard, because none of that matters much to me.  The main thing is that this superbly produced adventure is now even more gorgeous and more impressive.

I can't see how anyone who likes the original version can possibly fail to enjoy this tenfold.  Aside from the special effects, the cast turned in performances that seemed far more natural when contrasted with the acting methods in 1933, which are now so dated by their barking speech cadences.  Adrien Brody as Jack Driscoll portrayed the writer as intelligently aloof, reserved in word and action, but intense and soulful. Naomi Watts treats the material of an inherently absurd situation with exactly the right gravity, making us feel something, but not too much, settling for a pleasant sentimentality. As for Jack Black as Denham, I had a little trouble at first with his presence due to his work as a comedian.  However, he too was an excellent choice.  While possessing less range as an actor than his co-stars, his character was shallower, so it was a good fit after all.  As was everyone else.  Even if some characters were mere sketches, they were very good sketches.

While the merits of the 1933 version are undeniable, kudos to Peter Jackson for fully achieving the original intent.  I'm unconvinced there's a rational reason for anyone who likes the first film to dislike this one.  As a person who's pretty sentimental myself, normally I'd agree with holding on to something strictly for the sake of nostalgia.  But this is the definitive edition, and just too good, making it easy to let go; and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Kong-Blu-ray/dp/B001KZVQJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Kong [Blu-ray</a>] makes it even easier.

In the theatre it tends to drag and seems too long, however, at home it's perfect--even the extended version which runs 200 minutes, because you can view it in several sittings if desired, so it always remains fresh throughout. The special effects, which are quite possibly the best ever, come across beautifully on the Blu-Ray version, and the final scenes on top of the Empire State Building, with planes buzzing Kong, come completely to life with gorgeous, magnificently convincing imagery of the 70-year old NYC skyline near sunrise, with incredibly realistic surround sound effects and soundtrack.

7602205,5,B01AHWLX2O,"It will be interesting to see if this is the film for Blu-Ray that the industry hoped ""The Dark Knight"" would be - the one that will make those who are still on the fence about purchasing a Blu-Ray player run out and buy, buy, buy.  The way things are right now, I doubt any movie is going to give that kind of jolt, but if it's possible, ""King Kong"" might be the one to do it.

First, I'd like to comment on all the questions about which versions are contained on the disc.  The copy I received (from Amazon - pre-ordered and shipped on 21 January) had a sticker on the outside packaging that plainly stated both versions were on the disc (Both extended and theatrical).  Plus, as soon as the disc loaded, a screen came on allowing the viewer to highlight which version they'd like to watch.  Not wanting to miss a thing, we watched the extended cut the first time out, but I'm sure that when we watch it again, it'll be the theatrical version.  This is a loooong movie.  By the time it was ending, I could tell the kids were almost about to lose interest.

Just a quick note about family viewing: This movie is rated PG-13 for a good reason.  It is extremely intense at times, and there are several scenes where people are killed.  The scenes aren't horrifically graphic, thankfully, but the manner in which many of them are killed are certainly horrific.  I did preview this movie before I let the young'uns watch, but I started second guessing myself about half way through.  If you have sensitive viewers, I would definitely recommend previewing it before unleashing it on them.  It's certainly intense.  I decided that for us, this one was ok, but I still won't let them watch ""The Dark Knight"".

Now, a word about the Blu-Ray - Fantastic.  Unbelievable.  It's hard for me to envision how a picture could look any better, but that's what everybody thought when regular DVD's first came out.  We watched it using a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samsung-BD-P2500-1080p-Blu-ray-Disc-Player/dp/B001HBHLEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samsung BD-P2500 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player</a>, and had absolutely no trouble viewing it at all.  The only problem we did have was while watching the extended cut, there was a 'bonus view' icon in the top left hand corner.  I could not figure out how to get rid of the icon.  Once the film was over, I started it over in the theatrical mode, and the icon was gone.  I'm guessing that this is an operator malfunction instead of a disc problem.  I hope so anyway - I'd hate to think someone did that on purpose.

The 'U-control' feature allows the viewer to enable other interactive features while viewing, but we didn't explore that area at all, and frankly, I'm not likely to.  The 'bonus view' that I mentioned before, once enabled, will bring up a PIP screen during play and show some behind the scenes footage concurrently with the film, but once again, we were really only interested in the movie.  I mention these things just for those who might care.

There are over a thousand reviews for the regular DVD release of this film, so I wanted to concentrate on the Blu-Ray portion as much as possible.  I will say that this is a very entertaining film - maybe not brain candy - but exciting and enjoyable in a blockbuster sort of way.  It does not condescend or patronize, and a few silly moment aside (and what's a silly moment or two in a movie about a 25 foot tall ape between friends, anyway?), I'd recommend this to anyone that I thought could handle the intensity.  Terrific effects, and regardless of their status, relatively unobtrusive acting.  I'd call it a 4.5, but the darn thing's more fun than a barrel full of monkeys, so I'm rounding up.",1233100800,5,3735,4.717592592592593

Now; this is a fantastic Blu Ray experience and well worth the new dollars, and a chance to see it again in this new format!

Continuing: Have you ever gone to a ""all you can eat buffet""? Well, if you have you might have an idea as to the the amount of items on this menu!
It is bar none the most spectacular special effects movie I've seen to date! After the crew arrives at Skull Island, it becomes one CGI blowout after another, finally culminating back in New York City, in what I believe is the very best CGI effects in the whole movie {which is hard to define because everything looks so great, but the buildings, cars, etc seem to add something that a jungle can not}.

Everybody knows the story, so you won't find a reference to that here. But if you want one HECK OF A BLU RAY RIDE, then I don't think you'd be hungry after leaving this buffet!

7602213,5,B01AHWLX2O,"The 1933 version of King Kong has always been on my '10Best Movies List' since boyhood. I hated the 70's remake as it denigrated the original. The only thing good in that version was Jessica Lange. This extended version of Peter Jacksons remake not only honors the original but pays homage to it. When I heard Jackson's next project after LOTR was to be King Kong, I became so excited, I just couldn't wait. I believed that if he treated Kong with the same respect & reverence as LOTR, then all Kong fans everywhere were going to get knocked off their feet; big time! We were not disapointed. Like other reviewers, I just can't understand why they chose to leave these extended scenes out of the original theater run. After all, Jackson fans proved their loyalty by waiting close to five years to see all the chapters of LOTR, right! As good as the theatrical release was, this extended version of King Kong like the extended versions of LOTR, raise it to a higher level. Jackson also brings to fruition the original concepts of Merian C. Cooper & Edgar Wallace. We see King Kong as it was intended to be seen 72 years ago, in it's entirety. Jackson brings this new version of King Kong to the screen with an absolute respect, intimacy & love, thereby elevating it to just about surpass the original. A lot of bunk has been stated re: the choice of Jack Black and or his over the top portrayal of Denham. To me Black creates a kind of Orson Welles figure in all of his arrogance, posturing, con man antics & wunderkind greatness. The upstart who's vision is beyond the comprehension of studioheads. How else do you play a character like that but over the top? Jackson also gives us just enough inferences to the original to make fans of the original stand up and take notice, smile inwardly, and gasp, ""Wow""! Ex: Filming within a film, Ann aboard the ship, hints of musical pieces from the original soundtrack floating about the new soundtrack, the natives costumes & dance on the NY stage. The developing relationship between Ann & Kong is superb. Ann is scared to death, she has no idea what's going to become of her so she pulls out of her arsenal every desperate trick in the book to entertain Kong, biding time until she can attempt an escape. The movie needs to develop this storyline. Without it how else could any reference to Beauty & the Beast have any relevance, any true meaning? The 'sunset scene' just grabs your heart and when it's reprised at dawn in NY, Ann & Kongs relationship comes full circle. Jackson takes the time to show how admiration, respect & love could grow between these two unlikely beings, and how one would risk death to save the other countless times. How the other's emotion could bring uncontrolable tears and anguish witnessing the attack & death of the creature. You have to build these things over time folks. You have to create distinct characterizations, introduce them,allow time to become familar with them, give them the opportunity to stand out, so that when these characters suffer or die,; you feel it! Jackson is a master at this. He creates novels of moving images on screen. Uh, excuse me; isn't that what great movie making is all about! The other thing I must comment on is Jacksons use of CGI. It's incredible! With his work, you cannot tell where reality leaves off & CGI takes over. If you're one who loves an adventure, loves to be taken on a journey, loves exceptional movies, Then Peter Jackson's King Kong is the movie for you. If you loved the original 1933 version and know it well, then you will not be disapointed. I must also take my hat off to Amazon for offering this version because not very many places retail or online, are carrying it. Amazon's price is a definite plus too.",1232064000,2,3745,4.5827123695976155

7602216,5,B01AHWLX2O,"As another individual correctly noted this Blue Ray version does in fact contain both the theatrical and extended version of the film.  The NBC Universal Store web site verifies it.  Amazon simply failed to clarify this and they should do so because several others are disappointed that it doesn't appear to be here.  Peter Jackson's version of this classic film is simply visually stunning and it should be a reference quality Blue Ray film to show off a good video setup.  This is so much better than the cheap 1976 remake with Jeff Bridges.

Mr. Jackson took the time to actually develop the characters and the story which indeed adds to the film just as he did in Lord of the Rings which depended on character development.  Far too many films today fail to deliver a full story and rely only on cheap special effects.  This is a rich and full story.  Some were critical of this fact and they apparently merely wanted to see a large ape captured, climb a large building and then fall off and die with little more than special effects to wow them for an hour.  This is not a film for those with such a short attention span or those interested only in computer graphic magic.  This is the full story of Kong and those who encountered him . . . and it's an incredibly good one and superbly stunning in cinematography.",1231027200,22,1317,4.495798319327731
7602217,2,B01AHWLX2O,"It seems I might be the first one posting here that is not a Peter Jackson fan-boy!  I am interested in seeing the extended cut of this film to see if it adds any substance.  The theatrical version had many great moments...but also an hour of unnecessary ""character development"".  I believe the entire 1933 original version can be viewed in less time than it takes for Kong to make his first appearance in this remake.  The lame attempts at giving the characters depth and backstories added nothing to the story.  This would have played better (and probably to a greater audience) at two hours.  I am a great lover of film as both an art form and for just plain, fun entertainment...and it's sad when I see a film like this and know beyond a doubt I could create a substantially improved product using the available material.  I'll be getting this one from Netflix.

As for the ""double-dipping"" issue...it seems it's not a factor on this title but I understand they will hit LOTR fans hard with it this year.  Peter Jackson must have been schooled by George Lucas!",1230854400,2,1064,4.587301587301587
7602218,1,B01AHWLX2O,"You would think after making the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy--surely the most gargantuan undertaking in Hollywood history--that Oscar-winning director Peter Jackson could be relied upon to produce a superior remake of the legendary, 101-minute classic adventure movie ""King Kong"" (1933) than director John Guillerman's 135 minute, modern-day ""King Kong"" (1976) remake. Sadly, what should have happened does not! ""King Kong"" (no stars out of ****) the third time around amounts to the biggest pile of monkey shines since the hilariously outrageous Kong parody ""The Mighty Gorga"" (1969) with Anthony Eisley. Although Universal Studios will undoubtedly recoup their bucks from this blatantly bad banana peel of a movie, they will have to keep their public relations people scurrying like baboons 24/7 to ensure that this time-consuming 3-hour & 7-minute, $300 million slip-up turns a profit. Indeed, Jackson retains the Depression-Era setting of the original, but he wastes at least 90 minutes on stuff that could have been cut without harming the dramatic impact. Worse, the remake does not fix lapses in credibility that the original ""King Kong"" got away with because audiences in the 1930s were not as savvy as today's moviegoers. Transporting King Kong from Skull Island back to New York was the chief problem that the movie ignored. In the modern-day ""King Kong,"" the oil company locked the giant ape up inside a supertanker and shipped him back to New York. Essentially, the story remains the same: a band of adventurers take a tramp steamer to an uncharted island. They discover primitive islanders who sacrifice virgins to a humongous 25 foot ape. When the islanders catch a glimpse of the nubile white maiden among the while men, they kidnap her, offer her as a sacrifice to King Kong, and our heroes plunge into the interior to rescue her.

Basically, Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" collapses under the weight of too many characters, too much plot, and second-rate special effects. Not only do the actors clearly appear green-screened into scenes featuring stampeding dinosaurs and elaborate miniature sets (the integration of live actors with artificial footage is far from seamless), but also the special effects background shots resemble those cheap, paint-by-the-numbers, watercolor kits. While Guillerman's ""King Kong"" (that starred Jeff Bridges and launched Jessica Lange to stardom) took a critical drubbing, it stands head and shoulders above Jackson's ape-solutely awful rehash. Even the campy Japanese movies: ""King Kong Vs. Godzilla"" (1963) and ""King Kong Escapes"" (1967) are more entertaining. Surprisingly, despite several scenes of intense violence, the Motion Picture Association of America gave the new ""King Kong"" a family friendly PG-13 rating. Mind you, adolescent boys have always loved dinosaurs duking it out. Nevertheless, one scene teems with antennae-twitching, creepy-crawlers that would send anybody off on a super bug-spray shopping spree. The most reviling scene in this mind-numbing marathon of mediocrity occurs when enormous earthworms attack a sailor. These long slimy, egg-roll brown mutants sprout large bubble-gum pink heads wreathed with razor-sharp white fangs. In a graphic long shot, one icky earthworm attaches itself to the head of a man and sucks him up inside its mouth. Nothing like this happened in either the original ""King Kong"" or the 1976 modern-day remake and its 1986 sequel ""King Kong Lives.""

Jackson and co-scenarists Fran Walsh & Philippa Boyens of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy violate the first rule of remakes: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. First, they convert action hero Jack Driscoll (Oscar-winner Adrien Brody of ""The Pianist"") into a Federal Theater playwright. Second, they add a surplus of new unnecessary characters. One pointless subplot involves an adult African-American ship's lieutenant and a young white sailor. The new ""Kong"" also adds matine-idol movie star Bruce Baxter (Kyle Chandler of ""Mulholland Falls"") and turns the Skull Island natives into scary ""Lord of the Rings"" type cannibals. These bloodthirsty primitives are especially disgusting with their mutilated faces and milky-white eyes. Third, Skull Island itself looks like something from a surreal comic book with giant rocks shaped like gorilla heads while thousands of skeletons litter the landscape like something out of the 1984 movie ""The Killing Fields"" that depicted the carnage in Cambodia under Pol Pot's murderous regime. Jackson shoots all this in a semi-documentary style to sicken us. The phony-looking mammoth wall that separates the village from the island interior here looks like a poor poultry-wire model. ""Ring"" horror movie beauty Naomi Watts takes over the role of Ann Darrow created by Fay Wray in the original. Watts has a different kind of relationship with Kong. She cannot figure out whether she fears Kong or pities him. In two scenes, she performs vaudeville routines, juggling rocks and turning cartwheels, to amuse the big ape. Not even the fabulous Empire State Building finale can salvage this overripe remake. Despite its primitive movie-making effects, the original ""King Kong"" proved a magical experience for bewitched Depression-Era audiences that had never seen anything like it. The long-winded, unwieldy, new remake focuses more on mayhem than magic. The dinosaurs pale by comparison with those in the ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy. Altogether, you'll have more fun watching the black & white 1933 original or the Technicolor 1976 remake than Jackson's bloated, over-hyped hokum.",1230681600,7,5557,5.423121387283237
7602219,1,B01AHWLX2O,"The new Blu-Ray cut of King Kong runs 187 minutes....which means that this is the theatrical version of the movie. I love Jackson, but it seems we always have to wait through this inferior release for the director's cut. The nonsense of the situation is that so many customers have already purchased the DVD of this movie (many bought both the Theatrical and Extended DVD cuts). I mean...how many times are we supposed to buy it. The moral approach would have been to skip straight to the extended cut for the Blu-Ray, but as it was so eloquently put in ""Wall Street""...""Greed Is Good""!",1230508800,4,586,4.644230769230769
7602220,5,B01AHWLX2O,"In my opinion Peter Jackson's King Kong is one of the best films of 2005. It's about the struggle of people during the depression, adventures on and island full of dangerous creatures, and the relationship of man, and of course woman, with a misunderstood beast. In a nutshell is about human nature during adverse circumstances, and it's one hell of an entertainment and exciting ride from begining to end.

Let me adress the biggest complaint the movie recieves: it's length. Yes I think it could have been shorter, particularly in the first act, but I've seen this movie three time and never have I thought the movie really drags very much in any area. The second act, the longest of the three acts, that takes place on the island, is nothing short of spectacular, with no less than four amazing intense action sequences. I'm certainly glad Jackson went all out in that middle act; it's something for the ages. And the third act, back in New York city, is done very well with a lot of heartfelt emtion and really needed the time it uses to build to the powerful conclusion.

The acting is all round solid, with Naomi Watts, in the famous role Fay Wray played more than seventy years prior, giving the film's strong performance. The rest of the cast, Adrian Brody and Jack black, along with supporting roles of the crew of the ship, are good enough to not slow the momentum of the reall stars. Watt's Ann Darrow may be the only standout human role, but that's fine because she backed up extrodinarily by Kong, Skull Island, and New York city, all which look great and never are uninteresting.

I highly recomend this movie. The single disk edition that I bought has no special features of note. There's also a three disk edition and soon there will be a blu-ray version. Do yourself a favor and pick this up in some form.",1230336000,2,1822,4.58282208588957

7602222,4,B01AHWLX2O,"The Bottom Line:

King Kong is far too long, gains nothing from its two lead males, and has a tendency to drag, but features a stirring conclusion at the top of the Empire State Building and a sweet relationship between Naomi Watts and the CGI ape--it's a mixed bag, but worth seeing.",1230249600,,284,4.461538461538462

7602224,4,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson's labour of love is a spectacular, if overlong, remake of the movie that filled him with wonder as a small boy and inspired him to become a film maker. He may play fast and loose with the viewer's ability to suspend disbelief, giving us, as he does, indestructible people who are impossibly lucky when avoiding being trampled and can strafe their entire surroundings with machine-gun fire and only hit the monsters, but this is OK because it's part of the film's glorious sense of fun. And there may be plenty of ripe dialogue and facial contortion but Jackson puts so much heart into his production that this is perfectly in keeping with the tone of the work. Jackson has made a thrilling homage to the original Hollywood blockbuster, while successfully maintaining the emotional core of the plot. Self-indulgent it may be but it's all the better for that.",1229904000,,871,4.8133333333333335

7602230,4,B01AHWLX2O,"Given the fact that practically everyone knows the big ape dies after falling from the empire state building (it's on the DVD cover for crying out loud) one wonders why Hollywood decided to remake King Kong.

The answer is Peter 'Lord of Ticket Sales' Jackson, and his enviable grasp of story telling and spectacular FX. Unlike Michael Bay, who is content with blowing up multi-million dollar sets and selling it as cinema, Jackson actually drops a few nuggets of character development and plot into the mix.

The result is a spectacular action film with enough heart and brains to keep you engaged even when Kong isn't smashing T-Rex heads together. If action and story don't do it for you then you'll still have the pleasure of seeing Naomi Watts run around in the jungle for 45 minutes wearing nothing but a silk nighty.

Speaking of Naomi, she's the only one here who really has to act. Everyone else gets outdone by the monkey, including oscar winner Adrien Brody. It's not his fault though, he just doesn't get much screen time.

A truly action packed film that makes the most of the limited material gleaned from the original. At almost three hours it can start to drag near the end, but that's what the remote is for. DVD includes no extras - but a two disc special edition is available for the fans of featurettes.",1225065600,,1323,4.641025641025641
7602231,5,B01AHWLX2O,"First of all I want to say is that King Kong is visually stunning through out the whole movie, from the 1920s New York to Skull Island and to the monsters on the island and especially Kong who looks stunning on the screen. One question that bothers me is that how the Academy Award Winner Peter Jackson came up with this brillant movie and managed to finnish it I don't know.

Yes, there have been previous King Kong movies but this one is pure movie greatness and delivers where the others have failed. But where they fail is where Peter Jackson's take shines. There is an actual relationship between Kong and Ann, we actually understand why Ann cares so much for him. While Kong would try to impress her with roars and beating his chest, Ann would perform her vaudeville antics (to Kong's.. and ultimately the audience's delight). It is their shared moments of joy that solidify an unusual bond of friendship between Ann and Kong. Ann perhaps realizes that she is Kong's only friend, and hence his entire world.

The cast was superb, with Jack Black (probably his only serious role ever) as Carl, Adrien Brody and the beautiful Nioami Watts, followed by an excellent supporting cast which delivered by making the movie believable.

King Kong in my opinion is one the most beautiful movies ever made, where Jackson takes you to another world and puts you on a sometimes frightning adventure that is also heart warming at the same time. This shows just how great Peter Jackson is at being a director.",1224806400,,1500,4.674242424242424

7602233,3,B01AHWLX2O,"I grew up with King Kong. King Kong was a friend of mine. Peter Jackson's nominal ape is no King Kong! When I was a child in New York, Thanksgiving Days would not have been the same without WOR-TV's King Kong marathons, which included the original 1933 film, its 1934 sequel- Son Of Kong, 1949's Mighty Joe Young, and several Japanese films with the same titular gorilla. My dad and I loved those films. Director Peter Jackson's remake of King Kong (and it is a remake of the 1933 classic, not a mere updating like the 1976 Jessica Lange camp classic) is not nearly as great a film as most of the critics say it is, but it's still a damned sight better than most films out today, and certainly most horror films. The single best thing Jackson did was to set the film in the 1930s, and not in the 2000s, because this harkens back to an era where it was still plausible to believe in undiscovered islands, and round the world trips to them were akin to what interplanetary travel is in space films that came along later. The worst thing Jackson did, however, was nearly double the screening time of the original film, bloating this version to nearly three hours. There simply isn't enough material, so he adds far too many silly scenes of the modern Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) ridiculously making goo-goo eyes at the twenty-five foot tall gorilla.
  This, and a few other negatives, make the newer version a much inferior one to the original, although better than the 1976 version. Now, don't get me wrong, the special effects in this film top even those of the Spielbergian dino-fests of the 1990s, but even though Jackson was wise to go back to a 1930s setting, did he have to go retro-racist to boot? I'm hardly PC, but the Skull Islanders' savage depiction was ghastly and incredibly demeaning. First, since the island was south of Sumatra, it would be inhabited by people who looked Indonesian, not Negroid, nor even Negritos. Second, that they were almost all in a zombified state is odd, since this is a cultural trait from Haiti, in the West Indies, not that of the East Indies. And, of course, amongst the first to die in the film are the nerdy guy with eyeglasses, the black sailor, and the Chinese. Who survives? The Great White Hunters! I don't know what sort of statement Jackson thought he was making, but perhaps New Zealand is so far removed from the political realities of today that he just didn't know he was being racist with such depictions and narratives. I guess the Maoris have had it much better down under than we were led to believe.... Overall, this version of Kong is not bad, and at times, quite good, and you'll leave the theater with a bit of a buzz.",1221264000,,2678,4.5309917355371905

7602235,3,B01AHWLX2O,"I'm a big fan of the original King Kong, but I never go into re-makes expecting it to compare to the originals, for better or worse.

The bottom line for me is that this film was too long (for no reason) and had too many sequences that defied physics and plausibility to the point of diminishing an otherwise visually stunning adventure film. More is rarely truly more.

Many of the action sequences reminded me of how someone who lived it would TELL the story, not how it actually happened (exaggeration for effect):

Specifically, the idea of Kong Repeatedly falling down cliffs, fighting off T-Rex's, etc. all the while holding an unscathed Ann in one-hand seems a bit absurd. If it happened for only a moment, it might have some punch (like a close call.) But instead is happens for several minutes, yet she is never harmed, no backlash, nothing. Imagine getting into a car crash for 2-3 minutes and escaping unharmed. That's the same physics for these scenes.

Another scene features the crew trying to escape a stampede of Brontosaurus', but the scene is so jam-packed with the creatures in such a small space, it looks more cartoon-ish than believable.

Another incredulous scene features a young man who the filmmakers go out of their way to tell you has no experience with guns. Later, in the heat of battling giant inspects and larvae, he loads a Tommy gun and shoots giant crickets off his comrade, some 6-10 feet away. Not once does he ever hit his friend. Even in the hands of the most trained marksman this scene is a stretch beyond stretches.

When Kong escapes into the streets of New York, all is pure chaos and non-stop madness. But the second he finds Ann (or rather, she finds him), the streets are suddenly dead quiet with no sign of destruction. Huh? I also had a very hard time believing that the crew could effortlessly track Kong on such a vast, incredibly dangerous-terrain island.

There are many other scenes that defy logic and physics that really took away from them, when they should have been highlights of the film.

As far as the length of the film - there were many scenes and sub-stories that seemed completely unnecessary or were totally unfulfilled. The story between Mr. Hayes and Jimmy escapes me entirely. It was interesting until one of them is killed, the other one cries and then you never see or hear of either again. Yet, we've spent approx. 10-20 minutes focused solely on them and their history. Why? It takes literally an hour to REACH the island. At 2 hours and 20 minutes, we finally reach New York. Don't get me wrong, once the action starts, it's pretty relentless. But you can't tell me in a story as simple as King Kong that there's any reason not to get this film down to closer to 2 hours, instead of breaking the 3-hour mark. I think I would be more forgiving if we were left with any sort of solace or payoff at the end, but it ends rather flatly (no pun intended.) I realize it's a re-make, but if Jackson is going to take liberties to build up characters and make us sit through 3-hours, there better well be a good reason. I never found one.

Despite all the above mentioned, there were many aspects I did like. The realism of Kong having true gorilla mannerisms was great and it really lends to the viewer's sympathy for him as a wild animal, simply following trying to his instincts. For that same reason, I found the ending to be gut-wrenching, as well as his captivity scene. The action and visual effects are stunning and once they start, they don't let up. I really felt like I had been somewhere extraordinary when it was over.

I thought all of it was very well acted, but unfortunately, there wasn't much of a reason to be. It's all action and the only emotion most people will feel is between Ann and Kong. I felt very little nothing for Ann and Jack's romance, which is too bad.

In the end, I would recommend this film as a visual stunner and to true fans of King Kong, or fans of fast-paced action and adventure films (after the first hour, anyway.) If you've never seen the original, or aren't interested in the concept, there should be no problem in skipping it.

Lastly, I would NOT recommend it for kids. It has some scary moments and the theme is too mature for most kids to understand anyway.",1217548800,2,4273,4.535064935064935

7602238,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I have to confess that this is one of my all-time favorite movies.  Yes, I know the jungle scenes are a little over-the-top and my stoic husband can't even watch the ""bug"" scene without covering up his eyes but all of its excesses only make me love it more.

This new version soars from the breathtaking imagination of director Peter Jackson. The same strengths Jackson showed in LORD OF THE RINGS are in dazzling display here. Although there are enough amazing CGI special effects to satisfy even the most jaded STAR WARS/STAR TREK geek (including me), he's never willing to sacrifice heart and intimacy for spectacle. While KONG is a sprawling rollercoaster thrill ride of a movie--the original KING KONG meets INDIANA JONES meets JURASSIC PARK--it's Naomi Watts luminous portrayal of Ann Darrow that steals our hearts (and Kong's). An incurable romantic at heart, I actually turned to my husband after the movie and said, ""I wish they'd have shown more scenes developing their relationship"" before remembering that I was talking about a woman and a giant gorilla.

If you don't mind your guys a trifle bit hairy, you've always found a little Alpha male chest thumping to be endearing, and morning breath isn't an issue, the new Kong just may be the guy for you!

It occurred to me as I watched the movie that this Kong has a lot in common with the heroes of many of my favorite romance novels:

1) He adores Ann and finds her antics endlessly amusing.
2) He's so attentive he can recognize her by her smell alone
3) He rejects every other woman once they meet (hurling them out of his path like rag dolls)
3) He's keenly jealous of every other man in her life (hurling them out of his path like rag dolls)
4) He'd do anything to protect her, including sacrifice his own life.

What's not to love about a big old monkey like that?

This reincarnation of the 1933 classic is truelly spectacular in many ways. Naomi Watts is the perfect choice for the Ann Darrow character, and Jack Black makes a acceptable Carl Denham. Adrien Brody character I don't care for at all. The true characters of the film are the fifty foot tall gigantic gorilla Kong and Miss Ann Darrow.

I always cheer for the powerful King Kong. From his violent battle with the three V-Rex, to his final tragic battle atop the Empire State Building, to his final moments with Ann atop the gigantic building. I love the character of King Kong and I always will.

This film pays great tribute to the 1933 classic and gives a great, and entertaining show! I recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a truelly great film with tons of action, drama, and a giant gorilla. The best film of 2005! No question about it! Kong is King!!!

7602240,3,B01AHWLX2O,"I won't rehash territory discussed by others.  The film is visually exciting, well-orchestrated, and worth watching--a good action-adventure.  The good points are otherwise well-covered in other reviews here.  The main point that really detracts from the film overall is the lack of coherency on the famed mysterious island.  Apparently one of those territories that breed oversized and/or mutated animals, such as the radioactive waters from which the Japanese Godzilla emerged, director Jackson has no issues with mixing species and time periods on his dark island, where he has oversized centipedes cohabiting the island alongside Jurassic Park veterans (T-Rexes and so forth), while Kong of course is just a giant modern day gorilla.  Why are there no other giant gorillas on the island (where's mom and dad, brother and sister?), why, for that matter, are there no other giant JUNGLE creatures, of any form, and instead, why is the island pretty well populated with all kinds of familiar DINOSAURS?!  And, of all the choices of animals to bring back to ""civilization"", where choices include a host of these millions of years long dead dinosaurs, giant insects, never-before-seen fish, etc.--why did they choose to bring back a rather mundane, albeit giant, gorilla, of all choices?  If Jackson had established some sort of believability of his island inhabitants, we would not have had these problems.  He could have had one really big gorilla, amongst maybe some others of large but not gigantic stature, and thus, we could have seen why the island natives worshipped/feared Kong and none of the other animals (such as the equally fearful T-Rexes).  By succumbing to big scene excitement (eye-candy--hold the sensibility), while ignoring any kind of believability issues, he reduced his chances at creating a truly magnificent movie, and ended up creating just one more in a long line of action adventures, where you are forced to leave your brains at home, and as a result, ends up not being high on the list of movies to see again.  It didn't have to be this way--King Kong ""coulda, shoulda"" been better--why not an exciting movie that actually makes sense as well?",1213401600,,2173,5.1303116147308785

This remake of one of the most cherished films of all time wins an award for something, a minor one, but still an award and that is that it's probably the best remake of all time.  Not much considering its competition, but still it's something.  King Kong (2005) is certainly worth a look, but I must say some critical response to the running time of over three hours considering it could easily be two hours and still give the same level of emotion, but in the end the film manages to entertain for most of its long running time, as did Peter Jackson's previous films: the big screen adaptations of Tolkien's epic Lord of the Rings.

The plot should be familiar with most movie goers.  Director finds map to island, gets a film crew and a young actress and goes to shoot a film.  A hostile native tribe captures the young actress and offers her to their center of worship: a giant gorilla they have titled ""Kong"".  The crew of the ship lands and proceeds - with state of the art weapons for the 1930s - past the gates and into the jungles of Skull Island.  There prehistoric creatures aren't quite extinct and they end up in a fight for their live, while the director's schemes end up with the capture of the newly pronounced ""King"" Kong and ship him to New York where - as expected - more mayhem ensues.

The special effects are well done and can live up to expectations, especially the ones for Kong - not so much the dinos considering the much better dinosaurs we were shown over ten years ago in Jurassic Park.  Regardless this new adaptation of a classic tale of Beauty and the Beast has a level of emotion the classic 1930s version lacked, and that is certainly worth an acknowledgement on it's on.  In this film you can really care about Kong as more then a monster, but as an intelligent creature that just wants to be left alone.

The cast was selected well, me being most surprised by how well Jack Black pulled off a dramatic role because I was expecting cheesy comic relief from him throughout the film.  This film is touching and incredibly visual, but it has several weaknesses.  There are too many characters that they try to build up only to be killed early in the script and that wastes time (but a few extras, two in particular are well worth it).  Also Peter Jackson suffers from a similar flaw he had in The Lord of the Rings films.  His action sequences are just too long, just like how he'd have a two page battle from Tolkien's book and have it go on for an well over thirty minutes or add ones that weren't in the books.  Americans like action, but when they drag to movie on to this point they seriously will have people checking their watches wondering how much longer this monkey will be smashing things up.

A good film that I thoroughly enjoyed and most people will, but I can't guarantee that it can hold up to repeat viewings the way The Lord of the Rings films can.

7602245,5,B01AHWLX2O,"King Kong is Peter Jackson's first movie since completing The Lord of the rings trilogy.  Once again Jackson proves himself as a master of filmmaking.  While not as epic, or as good, as the Lord of the Rings, King Kong certainly is a masterpiece.  Some have argued that this movie is driven by little other than it's special effects.  The special effects are astounding, and plentiful, but there's no question that this is a character-driven film.  A considerably large portion of the three-hour movie is used to establish the characters, during which time we see neither Skull Island or the great primate himself.

My favorite things about the movie: Naomi Watts, James Newton Howard's score, and the action hero Bruce Baxter (played by the guy from the TV show Early Edition).  Jack Black is PERFECT as the obsessed filmmaker.

Also I liked the ending, where Jackson portrays neither King Kong nor the pilots that shoot him down as evil.  We sympathize with King Kong yet realize the necessity of killing the beast.

7602253,4,B01AHWLX2O,"King Kong (Peter Jackson, 2005)

I have to admit that I didn't really expect to like Peter Jackson's remake of King Kong; aside from not being a huge fan of the original (and I realize this is heresy for someone who's been a hardcore monster movie fan for almost forty years now), I wasn't entirely sure that Jackson, who really kind of got out of the monster movie business over a decade ago, could go back and make a good old-fashioned monster movie. More fool me; King Kong is everything a remake should be, and isn't everything that the glut of pale, unnecessary, and/or stupid recent remakes has been.

What Jackson did with Kong was not to ""re-imagine"" it (as so many directors have recently been doing with horror films, much to their detriment; the remake of The Hills Have Eyes is testament to just how wrong these things can go) as to amplify the original; the movie runs almost twice the length of Merian C. Cooper's 1933 opus, but not because Jackson added subplots or what have you. He simply extended scenes (and, in one notable case, added a scene that is the subject of legend, deleted from the original after audiences had an averse reaction to it). The things pared from the original film were pared because they hinted at racism (Charlie the cook is still here, but he's now known as Choy, and has a much smaller role). And, aside from one other change, the resulting product is remarkably faithful to Cooper's original film, but is, in every respect, bigger. The effects are wonderful, and since this is a movie whose main attraction is the effects (and always was, even in 1933), that's the strongest recommendation I can give it.

There is, however, that one change, and that's where Jackson's Kong becomes problematic. In the original, there was the big ape, and there was Ann Darrow (Fay Wray/Naomi Watts). Ape meets girl, ape falls for girl, girl is scared of ape, girl comes to see that ape isn't such a bad guy after all. The difference is that there was never a time in the original where Ann Darrow wasn't scared of Kong. Here, however, once Darrow comes to the realization that, hey, apes have feelings too, she obviously develops feelings for him as well. Now, this isn't a case of girl falls in love with ape, but girl obviously considers ape to be a thinking, rational being, and is alternately terrified and disgusted by the humans' actions towards the ape. This makes perfect sense given the attitude of humans towards animals in the two time frames when these two versions of the film were made. (I haven't seen the '76 remake of Kong in way too long, and so can't rope it into the discussion here.) This change in Darrow's character makes perfect sense, and for most of the film's length, I was all set to say that it's one of the changes that make this a better film than the original. Unfortunately, that all falls apart at the very end; the change in Darrow's reaction to Kong makes the immortal final line, which is delivered here verbatim from the original script, more confusing than anything. Now, I'm going to assume that everyone and their mothers has seen one version of Kong or another and expound on this, but on the off-chance you've been living on Skull Island for the past eighty years, and have never seen any version of King Kong, skip the next paragraph, which contains spoilers.

""It was beauty killed the beast."" When Ann Darrow is still terrified of Kong, it makes sense. In one of the most memorable scenes form the original film, Kong, loose in New York, finds Ann Darrow and abducts her. Kong's whole idea is to get Darrow and go off somewhere that people aren't flying things around and shooting at him, so the two of them can live in peace, even if Darrow's not on board with that idea. All well and good, but it's Darrow's resistance, at least in part, that brings about Kong's death. In this version, however, Darrow's all about saving the ape. He doesn't abduct her-- she goes off and finds him, and tries to stop the airplanes by putting herself out there and yelling at them. (The idea of a five-foot-something woman shielding a twenty-five-foot ape with her body is ludicrous in the extreme, but it somehow works here; the pathos Jackson evokes in this scene is remarkable.) You get the idea that Darrow would be perfectly happy to cross the East River and, say, take up residence in the New Jersey Pine Barrens with her simian pal. Sorry, Pete, but this time, it was the airplanes.

Okay, now that the rest of you have joined us, I've focused entirely too much on Naomi Watts (who is wildly inconsistent in her acting abilities, honestly, but really does an excellent job here) and Andy Serkis (who is not at all inconsistent in his acting abilities, and for whom I have an undying love) and not said a word about the rest of the cast. Another reason I avoided this movie is because I don't think it would be possible to stick together a bunch of actors I'm less inclined to want to see in a movie. (Oh, wait, someone did-- Horton Hears a Who. Steve Carrell and Jim Carrey in the same movie?) Adrien Brody is a good actor, but he takes the most godawful roles. Jack Black is not a good actor, and he, too, takes the most godawful roles. Jamie Bell? I got allergic to him after Billy Elliott. Thomas Kretschmann is a brilliant actor (viz. Der Untergang), but, like Brody, winds up in movies that are just painful to watch (viz. Immortel: Ad Vitam). And yet all of them have renewed my faith in their acting abilities in this movie-- yes, even Jack Black. His name on a film will not be an automatic ""no"" any more (the way Jim Carrey's or Steve Carrell's is). How did Peter Jackson manage to yank these performances out of these actors? I have no idea. But he did it. And he stuck them in a three-hour movie that plays faster than many two-hour movies I've seen. The start's a little slow, yeah, but once you get into it, wow. Jackson does, most certainly, still know how to direct a monster movie. And, with a few missteps, he certainly did a fine job on this one. *** ",1206403200,,6038,4.524725274725275

Movie Release: 2005

Screenplay: Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Peter Jackson
Story: Merian C. Cooper, Edgar Wallace
On DVD?: Yes
Rating: 3 1/2 stars

Summation: In 1933, King Kong made its debut. In 1976, John Guillerman remade King Kong, starring Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange, and the story only slightly differed. In 2005, Peter Jackson remade King Kong, starring Jack Black, Naomi Watts and Adrien Brody, but the story remained most like the 1933 version. A film crew embarked on a journey to an unknown island, only to find giant dinosaurs (in the 2005 remake), giant insects (in the 2005 remake), and the infamous Kong (1933, 1976 and 2005 versions).

Synopsis: To retell the story of King Kong would prove quite pointless as most Americans have either seen the original or the remake, and neither differ much from the other.

Personal Thoughts: The 2005 version happens to be my favorite, and I'll tell you why. First, seeing as technological capabilities have improved, the graphics are much better than those in the 1933 and 1976 versions. In the 2005 version, Kong actually looks authentic, as if a giant ape could exist. In the previous two versions, Kong appeared stilted, somewhat unreal. The movements of the giant gorilla weren't as fluid as in the 2005 version.

But, technological capabilities aside, I also think that the 2005 version had a better range of characters. That's not to say that Jack Black or Adrien Brody are better actors than Jeff Bridges or Charles Grodin (and don't even ask me to name the characters in the 1933 version without me searching IMDB.com) or that Naomi Watts is a better actress than Jessica Lange, but I'm more familiar with the characters in this 2005 version than I am with the characters in the two previous versions. Jack Black is a known comic, starring in Saving Silverman, Shallow Hal and School Of Rock to name a few (and besides, I'm a Jack Black fan *lol*). Naomi Watts is known for her roles in Mulholland Dr., The Ring and The Ring Two. Also, it seemed as if the additional characters (i.e., Thomas Kretschmann who played Captain Englehorn, Colin Hanks who played Preston, and sexy Evan Parke who played Hayes, etc.) had a bigger role than the supporting cast of the two previous films.

Not only are the technological capabilities farther advanced and the actors more suited, but the location (because of the technological capabilities) appears more authentic as well. Maybe the film crew didn't go to an unknown island, but it sure appeared that way. The lush greenery, the rotted, decaying logs, the oasis of an undiscovered continent... all of those add to the scenery to make it look more realistic than the two previous versions.

By far, the 2005 version, to me, is the best yet. Hence, 3 1/2 stars.",1201132800,,2857,4.880412371134021

Personally, I love animals and it tears me apart when I see or hear of them being abused (Michael Vick, you deserve your punishment, if not more). So knowing the tragic fate of King Kong actually kept me from seeing it in the theater. That was probably still a good choice as the end really pulls at my heart strings. Don't get me wrong though, I really like this film and it's obviously really well done if it can make me feel so much for an animated, oversized gorilla.

I won't bother with the plot as most everyone knows it by now. I'll focus on the HD DVD disc which is why your probably reading these reviews anyway. Too many review the movie and never speak of the disc quality, which I know bugs me a little.

The video is breathtaking, especially once the characters arrive on the island. The jungle scenes are truly alive and really pop in the way you hope a new hi def disc will. The graphics and animation by WETA (who also did Lord of the Rings) are top notch. They blend almost perfectly with the scenery and the details allow you to really look at them and appreciate how good they really are. You can tell they're graphics but it doesn't hurt the enjoyment or believability at all. My favorite things to look at are Kong as you can inspect every hair, scar, and skin texture in their amazing detail. And during the attack in the insect pit. These tube like creatures reveal this wet, slick, fleshy looking texture to them. I never stop being amazed by how real that looks.

Audio wise, we get a very robust Dolby Digital Plus mix. This disc packs a wallop that'll knock you across the room during the action parts. The dialog and score are perfectly balanced and sound great too, but I always look forward to the action bits and this one is everything you could hope for. I found new demo material here with the Kong/T-Rex fight. Not only a sight to behold but a sonic wonder for the ears. The audio puts all the growls, roars, thumps and crashes right in your house(given you have a home theater of course). It's truly relentless and exhiliarating to the point of exhaustion by the time it's finished. Great stuff.

This is one of the first films you need to get for your HD DVD player. If you don't have home theater, this movie will inspire you to consider it as it's as much a sonic marvel as a visual wonder. And all of this is only bested by a wonderful story and excellent acting. The audio and video must come second to these but it's all the better to have them all here. Overall, this is a wonderful film and is what I believe to be the best adaptation of King Kong ever.

7602270,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Merian Cooper directed the original 1933 King Kong, and if he were alive to see Peter Jackson's version, I guarantee he'd say:

""Boy do I wish we could have done it this way.""

Interestingly tho, the idea of Ann Darrow eventually warming to and becoming attached to Kong seems to be a creation of the 1976 version. I've watched the original many times, and although there is an obvious obsession in Kong for Ann Darrow, it appears to be one way. Everyone in the original seems to pretty much regard Kong as a monster to be feared, battled, or exploited. In the 30s, and long afterward, sentiment towards the preservation of irreplaceable creatures had not developed much, if at all.

In Jackson's version, I highly enjoyed the relaxed intro in New York. I was dazzled by every sequence on the island, and felt the full effect of the emotional hammer he brought down on us for the ending sequences.

This movie is absolutely true to the spirit of the original, showing an unusual reverence in a remake for its predecessor. If you liked the original Kong, and especially if you first saw it as a child, you will love this one.

There is no need to over analyze this movie. It was not made for depth of art, although that is not ignored in the film. It was made as a flat out ""watch me and enjoy"", with a bit of ""try to keep your jaw up"" thrown in.

Just as an afterthought, to dispute a few other posts I have read, Jack Black was great in this film, and COMPLETELY on top of his role. Although the character itself is undeniably shallow, Black's depth of performance is far superior to either Robert Armstrong in the original, or Charles Grodin's in the '76 release.

I now own both the extended DVD and the blu ray releases of this film. Both are excellent presentations for their format in regard to both video and audio quality.",1196812800,,1830,4.461077844311378
7602271,3,B01AHWLX2O,"...for my mother actually.

And the more you watch it the less it dazzles you. King Kong was a great character: He was humorous, smart, silly, and very caring.

As far as the story goes though, King Kong loved the dame in this and fell in love with picking her up after a fall to knock her down over and over again. That was the funniest part in the movie! :^)

The actors did a fairly decent job of bringing the characters to live and the action kept you glued but you won't wanna watch this one over and over again.

The action is mostly in the jungle where all of these sick creatures live and call it home.

7602273,2,B01AHWLX2O,"Okay, the film is not absolutely terrible.  The basic story is intact, and there's lots of color and action.  Great.  But owning it on DVD, repeat viewings for me are going to be few and far between.

First, there's a lot of character development and backdrop that goes nowhere.  The movie takes forever to get going, but you're thinking there must be a reason for all this character introduction.  Well, there isn't really.  It goes nowhere and is completely superfluous.  Beyond that, Anne's affection for the ape is nonsensical.  I think maybe its a veiled attempt to project some late 20th-century environmental/animal protection sensibilities into an era where they make no sense, or perhaps the writers didn't even realize they were doing it.  The 1930s probably had much the same exploitive attitudes as the Victorian era.  The movie also had a darker more foreboding atmosphere than the original, which eventually seemed pointless and gave way to the cartoony NY scenes at the end.  Maybe it was also related to the weak and undeveloped morality-play aspect of the film.  In the middle of all this, Jack Black sticks out like a sore thumb.  I think he was meant to pull off the reassuring confidence of the original Denham character, since he's certainly not a dramatic character, but he falls short and just seems comical where its inappropriate.

And CG in general is really tired and is a big turnoff to me.  I almost loathe it.  In this particular movie some CG was okay, and a lot was borderline to just plain bad, which was surprising.  I find older movies that predate CG to be more enjoyable to watch often times, not because the effects are more believable (although in a sense they are because you know you're still seeing a real ""thing"" on screen), but because they had to be more creative and work within limitations and were also more constrained to simpler ""within-the-realm-of-possibilities"" type scenes.  Now instead you get some fat nerd on a workstation somewhere going berserk with the unlimited use of models and crashing and explosions and noise and digitally-created indistinct ""crap"" flying everywhere in some scenes. Gimme O'Brian, Harryhausen, and even Lucas' 70s puppets any day.  I hate watching a CG action scene where you can't keep track of what's going on because its just tons of flip-flopping stuff flying and crashing everywhere action.  To be asked to believe the absurd aerial acrobatics the characters are routinely flung through like rag dolls, escaping unscathed, begs incredulity.  A more recent example is the disorienting urban fight scene in Transformers, an otherwise superior movie.  Get real.  Note to Hollywood: less is more.  Concentrate on story and characters (and have a point to each), use limited effects to enhance -- not bowl over.  But given that those of non-discriminating tastes eat this stuff up, I don't expect any changes any time soon.",1195430400,4,2906,4.977178423236515

Ridiculously poor editing makes this a third longer than it should be. So many long pans over lavish sets as if to say, look at all the effort we went to, instead of trying to tell the story and move it along. Major continuity issues surface at various points to add to the mess.
Some stunning visual moments, but in the end I didn't care as I was bored stiff an hour in and realizing more than two were left. Some really B-movie moments, too. Cheesy script and not one exceptional performance add up to snoresville in my book, even if the ape came off the screen and sat beside me.

7602275,2,B01AHWLX2O,"For the first 45 minutes to an hour my wife and I were really pleased with this film. It was engaging; it started to develop the story and the characters, and promised to be really entertaining. In fact, it reminded me of how effectively movie makers of the 1930's and 40's could tell a story and engage you in the telling of it. Then, the main characters reached the island of Skull Mountain and the special effects began to run amok in the film much like King Kong ran amok in New York city.

Once the special effects were introduced, they violently (very violently, in fact) wrenched away control of the story from the director and began an almost non-stop convulsion, a flood, an avalanche, a torrent of mindless computer-generated effects. Kong stomping dinosaurs. Dinosaurs stomping men. Men stomping giant insects. Kong contemplating the sunset. It was as if the XF crew became addicted and lost control of the sequences, and could no longer discern when special effects were helpful and required to move the story along or when they were thoughtlessly trampling on it. Overdone? Holy cow!

At one point the graphics people push the story so far out of the way they decided, for whatever bizarre reason, that it would be really good to show King Kong ice skating in Central Park! They were wrong.

I was lured to this film because I was familiar with the story, and because this 2005 re-telling won the Academy Award for Visual Effects. In fact, many of the visual effects are stunning -- but only when they are not ridiculously over done, and that is not often enough.

My assessment is that when the film is good, it is very, very good. But when it is bad, it is horrid. Unfortunately the good part lasts less than half way through.",1193961600,,1741,4.624595469255663

7602277,5,B01AHWLX2O,"King Kong is a well put together movie (both the movie itself and the 3-Disc Deluxe Edtion DVD).  State of the art special effects, great characters, action, drama, comedy, and Peter Jackson's directing.  Easily his best movie since 'Dead Alive' (a.k.a. 'Braindead').  Jackson stayed true to the 1933 original that he loved so much by remaking the movie with today's technology.  He even used some of the same lines and action sequences from the original (albeit with a little flare).  While some may see this as laziness, I see it as Jackson's homage to the one movie that inspired him to be a filmmaker.

Some reviewers have had a problem with the casting.  I couldn't disagree more.  Firstly, Naomi Watts is one of the greatest actresses of all time.  I enjoy anything and everything she does.  She can say so much with her face, which is important in this movie as her part (Ann Darrow) is light on dialogue.  Her character is extremely important because she has the most interaction with Kong (our title character) and we learn a lot of what is happening with Kong through her.  Although the filmmakers did such a fantastic job with the special effects and motion capture that Kong himself is also very good at expressing his feelings (sans any dialogue,of course), a lot of which is due to the multi-talented Andy Serkis.  Jack Black is fantastic (he's the character you love to hate in this movie) and Adrian Brody is good as always.

I have to mention that so far this may be one of the best DVDs in terms of special features that I have seen so far.  It's not the only one that has hours of behind the scenes material, but it is the only one that I have been able to watch all of those hours without actually getting bored (many thanks go to Jack Black for this).  The cast and crew really had a great time shooting this movie and it shows.  And as a bonus all of the special feature footage is shot in widscreen so you don't have to adjust the ratio on your TV.

So, if you like monster movies: watch this movie.  If you like Peter Jackson: watch this movie.  If you like Naomi Watts (if anybody doesn't I want to talk to you): watch this movie.  If you like crazy action, including giant apes, dinosaurs, giant insects and slugs, etc.: watch this movie.  I would like to personally thank Peter Jackson for making this movie.  I will enjoy it always.",1193011200,2,2360,4.488262910798122

This movie was probably the longest I've watched in many years but well worth the time invested. They managed to keep you on the edge in many parts while relaxing a little in others. My family actually stayed awake through the whole thing, this is a first in a long time as well. For a new version of a classic it really did the original justice and then some. It could have been easily split into 2 parts but was well worth leaving it as one as well.

Even though it's long I'm sure I'll be glad to watch this a few more times, though I'll have to make sure that I only do so on days that I know I will have the 3+ hour to sit around and do nothing. I think this a good bi-yearly video.

7602284,2,B01AHWLX2O,"It's strange, but looking at the reviews this movie seems to be a love/hate movie. I can't imagine what makes it so polarizing. I found it cringe-worthy.

My biggest gripes: nearly every action scene is cartoonish. A stampeding horde of brontosauruses not only can't outrun humans... it runs with them, over top them, without stepping on anyone. For several minutes. The same problem happens with the rest of the crazy dinosaur/island creatures... they don't seem to adhere to any principle of physics and motion, but gnash and crash and fall down all over the place while magically avoiding the main characters.

Another problem is the love story. Why would a woman care about a freaking monkey? One that has eaten human sacrifices for decades, and that destroys everything whenever he feels like cutting lose. She doesn't recognize that part of him, just that he's a big sweet monkey who has love in his heart too. Aw[...] Not only that she doesn't just seem to like him as a friend. She seems to want to marry him. A 30 foot tall, man eating monkey. Of course, that's the original story, but they failed to help explain it any better.

One more gripe: Jack Black. Great guy, very funny. He screws up this movie because it's not a comedy. Sorry Jack but you don't belong in a dramatic action movie where everyone's waiting for you to crack jokes. He doesn't crack any, by the way, but there's the problem. He's not one of those guys who acts well outside his comedy, and as an important personality in this film it's almost embarrassing to watch him have no dramatic presence.

Then on the island it gets ridiculous, as they get involved with stampeding dinosaurs tumbling down the cliff, and swinging Tyrannosaurs; everything that should have been so much better than the SFX-scarce 76 version was orchestrated so poorly and with so little inspiration, that you start wondering how much longer it can go on.  Finally they return to more silliness back in New York, with the ape himself sliding on the ice with the girl.  Apart from the problem of making Kong merely a scaled-up silverback gorilla, who shows all the subtlety and charm of a...gorilla, you can't wait for pilots to get on with it and kill the poor thing so the movie will end.

7602292,1,B01AHWLX2O,"With any remake, comparisons to the original are inevitable, especially if the original happens to be a beloved classic generally regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. Basically, another remake of KING KONG is unnecessary. To its credit, the campy 1976 version didn't try to 'ape' the 1933 film, but totally updated the story to its own era. While the latest rehash was intended as an 'homage' to the original, it can't even stand on its own as an example of good filmmaking.

 To start with, Peter Jackson's KING KONG did nothing new for movies so it won't be remembered as anything extraordinary 75 years from now. In order for that to happen, a film needs to stand out as different from others of its time and thus be worth talking about long after it came out. The original KONG accomplished this by setting new filmmaking standards in special effects, music scoring and sound recording. Everything comes together so seamlessly in the film that its merits can easily be taken for granted, and often are. KING KONG had huge relevance when it came out in 1933; Aside from revolutionizing the film industry, it depicted the Great Depression, something audiences identified with so strongly at the time, and it immortalized the Empire State Building, which was just erected in 1931 and hailed as the epitome of modern engineering and construction. In short, the film was made exactly when it would best have an impact in the world. Peter Jackson's remake will never achieve that kind of cultural significance because it's irrelevant from the outset. It doesn't speak for its time the way the original did and still does.

 Greatness is largely measured by originality, and on that note Jackson's film is nothing more than a plagiarism of Merian C. Cooper's original concept. At least in the '76 Dino DeLaurentiis version there were no cheap rip-offs of dialogue and musical cues lifted from the original. This kind of borrowing/referring is lost on younger audiences unfamiliar with the original film, and only comes off as gushy overindulgence on Jackson's part.

 I also got jaded very fast with all the repetitious CGI glitz I was bombarded with - Kong flies and bounces around with the speed and weightlesness of a Loony Tunes cartoon character. On the other hand, I never fail to marvel at the grittier, hands on visual effects of 1933 which combined stop-motion, glass paintings, full-scale and miniature rear projection, in-camera mattes, and optical printing. The overall results seem even more remarkable today, especially since that brand of genuine artistry has been replaced by generic, computer simulated effects. Jackson's Kong stretches his mouth too wide when he roars (a lousy roar by the way), and his face and body contort in that watery, exaggerated fashion that is characteristic of CGI in so many current films. It reminded me of the ""rubber hose"" style animation of old cartoons which I don't mind, and even like - in a cartoon that is. Here, instead of looking realistic it only comes off elastic. To say that the CGI is overdone in this digital blitz is putting it mildly; it goes beyond credibility because it's used to depict action that defies physical laws. Despite the way she's being swung and hurled around, Ann Darrow seems to possess the invulnerability of a superhero in a video game.

 The other neat thing about the first film is that its story, clocking in at 100 minutes, is fool-proof at that running time; extend it to over three hours as Jackson did and it just doesn't work. It's the kind of story that should move briskly along without resorting to scene overkill, and Jackson just crosses that line way too often. Witness the excessive dinosaur fights, the senseless bug scenes, that ridiculous ice skating bit (a real eye roller - Kong turns into Bambi!), and the ponderous, outrageously over the top Empire State Building finale. For all its pretentions toward 'character development' and other contrivances, this remake manages to omit two of the original's key exciting sequences: Kong's rampage in the native village (what happened to Jackson's demonic looking natives anyway?) and his wrecking of the elevated train. The compromised result doesn't improve on the original, but emerges instead as a tedious, gluttonous opus with a juvenile reliance on sheer banality that tries to pass for 'emotional depth'.

 Additionally, though it's set in the '30's, the remake is too self conscious and tries too hard to be politically correct, all of which is out of historical context with that era. If Jackson has issues with the way people behaved in the '30's then why did he set his film in that time when he's unwilling to portray it truthfully? His remake dilutes everything that gave the real 1933 KONG its honest, timeless charm.

 As for the actors, they're no match for the original players who brought a classic quintessence (not the often misused term stereotype) to their roles. Naomi Watts doesn't look, act, nor scream (yes, the screaming's important too folks) as good as the innocent/sexy Fay Wray. Unlike Wray's iconic, stylized performance, Watts brings none of that larger than life quality, and her face is frozen in a stunned expression for most of the film. She's also a full ten years older than Wray was in her portrayal as Ann Darrow, who's supposed to be an ingenue. This part immortalized the original actress, whereas Watts, like Jessica Lange before her, is probably trying to live it down. The miscast Jack Black totally lacks the conviction and gusto with which Robert Armstrong imbued Carl Denham. Forget the forced Orson Welles allusions; Black's Denham doesn't even measure up to Ed Wood. The actor's throw-away dialogue delivery and smug, immature attitude dispels any credibility to his performance which can best be summed up as amateurish. In his ill-advisedly re-written role as Jack Driscoll, Adrien Brody looks bored and quite unsure of what's expected of him, walking through it all as though he'd rather be doing another movie. Jeff Bridges at least tried to be convincing in the '76 version. In the original, Bruce Cabot played the part as it was called for - a tough, true to the era seaman who, like his rival Kong, is gradually softened by falling for Fay Wray. Kong himself isn't the hybrid, monster-ape as originally conceived in '33, but simply an actual, ho-hum gorilla. He also comes off as an unlikable grouch who isn't as gentle with Ann Darrow as the original Kong is.

The one 'performer' that's really showing off in this movie is Jackson's hyper-active camera, which is constantly gliding, swooping, and circling around like it's mounted on a carousel. It's all supposed to heighten drama and generate excitement - it doesn't. Like the relentless CGI, the camera acrobatics are so overwrought that they ultimately become meaningless, failing to achieve whatever effect the filmmakers intended.

Whereas the original KONG tells its story with vivid, no-nonsense clarity, Jackson's is convoluted with trivial subplots and secondary characters whom we don't need nor care to know about. All of that irrelevant elaboration only gets in the way of the narrative's main thrust.

A major climax is also mishandled: In the original theater sequence, Kong believes the photographers' flashes are hurting Ann, and this provides excellent motivation for him to break loose - the beast protecting his beauty. It sets up Kong's re-capture of Ann since he follows her out of the theater and sees her run into a hotel. In Jackson's version Ann Darrow isn't even at the theater (though her name appears on the marquee - go figure); instead she's substituted onstage by a stand-in who's participating in a mock native ceremony! Kong's motivation to escape is therefore not brought on by any feeling for Ann - he's just fed up in general. The sequence is further marred by cutting away from the theater and diverting our attention to some corny dribble about Ann's and Jack's personal problems. It interrupts the tension that should be mounting at this point in the film.

Most importantly, Jackson made a crucial narrative error: He changed the story of KING KONG into a more conventional version of ""Beauty and the Beast"". To understand why this was a mistake, we need to look at Merian C. Cooper's made up ""Old Arabian Proverb"" which opens the original film:

""And the prophet said:
'And lo, the beast looked upon the face of beauty.
And it stayed its hand from killing.
And from that day, it was as one dead.'""

In Jackson's remake, Carl Denham recites this proverb onstage at Kong's debut. However, it's not quite the same:

""And lo, the beast looked upon the face of beauty.
And beauty stayed his hand.
And from that day forward, he was as one dead.""

Note that in Cooper's original text it's beauty's face that stays the beast's hand. In other words, it's her physical beauty alone that touches his primitive heart, not anything she herself does. There's nothing in the proverb to suggest that she warms up to him, and the '33 film adheres to that premise. Jackson altered the proverb and hence the whole point of the story by having beauty play an active role in taming and nurturing the beast, just as in the fairy tale ""Beauty and the Beast"". He confused Cooper's film with something else entirely, and spawned the ""it needed improvement"" myth about the original. There's nothing to improve. The '33 KING KONG is a downbeat tale not just because Kong dies, but because Ann Darrow rejects him and thereby unwittingly contributes to the tragedy. It's a classic fable of unrequited love. If it's changed, the whole story falls apart. This is why the final line, ""It was beauty killed the beast"" works perfectly in the original but seems forced and out of place in Jackson's remake. He would have done better to leave it out as was done in the '76 version which also had the girl make friends with Kong.

A story as fantastic as KING KONG needs a streamlined, unpretentious treatment for it all to click, and ultimately Jackson's version fails by trying to be something more when nothing more is necessary. That's okay though, because in the end it just further emphasizes the singular glory of the original KING KONG, and it's now safe to assume we won't be seeing any more vain attempts at trying to recapture that glory anew. (See my Amazon review of the original KING KONG).",1184630400,46,10377,4.898063781321184

Now I know why Microsoft packed this title in with the Xbox360 add-on drive. If you want to see what your HDTV can really do, check out this movie on HD-DVD. All I could say throughout watching this was ""wow!"". Every shot is ultra-sharp, no compression artifacts at all. Great colors, especially on the sky shots. Basically some of the most amazing footage I've ever seen.

I've never seen the movie before (not even the original) and I totally loved it. The whole production is top-notch. I didn't find it to be long at all. Jackson took as long as was necessary to tell the story properly. In fact, more movies should be 3 hours long. Despite what other people are saying about the CG effects, it is really only even barely noticeable on the stampede scene. Most people don't even realize how much special effects are used in the movie. Do you think King Kong is a man in a suit? Do you think Peter Jackson traveled back in time to film on location in new york city? Pretty much the whole movie is using some 3d graphics and green screen work. And it looks absolutely fabulous in HD.

Bottomline, this is an excellent showcase for HD-DVD. It is worth picking up just to see how good an HD-DVD can be on your HDTV. Highly recommended.",1183593600,2,1371,4.393700787401575
7602294,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I grew up loving the early ape films King Kong (1933) and Mighty Joe Young (1949). King Kong is a classic retelling of the Beauty and the Beast story and the original was groundbreaking in its use of special effects. Remaking a classic will always attract harsh critics.

For me, a lover both of classic films and of modern science fiction, I place King Kong (2005) among the best films I have seen in years. In the cinema, this was a true spectacle to behold. The action and CGI special effects were astounding. Peter Jackson took a fairly sparse story and fleshed it out. I appreciated the longer back-story to the characters in New York prior to the sea voyage to Skull Island.

The exposure of themes relating to racism, animal and ecological abuse, and treatment of women was obvious, but not preachy. Despite this being an action film, these themes seemed to me as large as Kong was himself.

Jackson tweaked the storyline a bit and improved on the original. The introduction of the writer (Brody) as love interest instead of the ship captain made more sense and was simply a better story. With the original film, I was quite moved as a kid when Kong died. With this version, I was at least as moved or more as an adult. The relationship with Kong and Ann was portrayed better. I believed that they had made a bond with each other. The moment of Kong's demise is one of the most touching moments I have seen in a film in years.

Finally, James Newton Howard's soundtrack is quite moving, with beautiful, stirring melodies befitting this grand film. Worth listening to in its own right. I would have liked to watch the film with an isolated music score. Unfortunately, this was not included as an option on any edition so far.

Editions:
Two-Disc Special Edition (2006)

3-Disc Deluxe Extended Edition (2006)
There is no overlap to what is on the 2-disc version, so this was a worthwhile second purchase for me. I enjoyed seeing the deleted scenes. The slightly longer (13 min.) version was intereresting to see. I especially wanted the audio commentary track.

7602295,5,B01AHWLX2O,"There are very few remakes that live up to the original's reputation and for many good reasons:

1. we already know, more or less, how the story goes.
2. the original is often an almost perfect film which explains why the movie is being remade: many fans could be suckered into seeing an inferior remake.

All great remakes not only must put a spin on the original story but they also must prove that a retelling of the story was necessary.  Off the top of my head I can think of two films that meet this criteria: The Fly (1986) and The Thing (1982).

King Kong (2005) is also one of those rare remakes.

The most refreshing part of this movie is that there is an underlying and always present emotional dimension to this version which the 1933 version lacked.  Unlike most movies today, the characters (especially Anne) are given plenty of time to develop so that we actually care about them when the action gets underway.  The interpersonal relationships certainly have a greater depth than the original.  Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this movie is that there is an emotional relationship between Kong and Anne that, I'm thrilled to say, somehow works.  I absolutely loved how they could share something as simple as sunset together and take just enough time to enjoy the wonder of it all.

The characters are more fluid, less one-dimensional, more nonchalant, and just plain better than the original's wooden actors (""say, I think I love you"" as an example).  When I say this, I include King Kong who is a surprisingly good actor (even if he is CGI).  He's not portrayed as some misunderstood creature (like the horrible Godzilla remake) or a ruthless creature (King Kong 1933) but like we would expect: an animal.  Nothing more, nothing less.  At the end of the movie I discovered, to my utter astonishment, that I actually almost cried when the CGI creature was slipping off the Empire State Building.  And I am a 23 year old, 230 pound, 6'3"", adult male and I never cry at movies!

It's worth mentioning that this film contains some of the best CGI stuff to date and also, what have to be some of the most beautiful scenes in all cinematic history.  I especially loved seeing New York City during the 1930s.

Technically the condensed 1933 version may be a ""better"" film but, of the two, I prefer this one.  Go gorilla and get this king-sized monster movie.",1180310400,5,2375,4.638755980861244

7602304,3,B01AHWLX2O,"I've just watched the first two hours of this and in another session will get to the end no doubt. This movie is simply too long, there is no justification for a potboiler like this being three hours long.

The beginning was pretty poor, Jack Black overacts in the opening section of the film and only Naomi Watts performance kept me watching (less is more Jack). The appearance of the natives on the island changed everything, suddenly this was much more interesting, and eventually after a lot of time had passed Kong appeared.

Kong is hugely impressive, this is a spectacular CGI creation and credit to all involved for this aspect of the film. However at this point the dinosaurs appeared and I'm afraid things started going wrong again. Our wonderful heroine (who has kept me watching) is now in serious trouble. She doesn't really trust Kong but the place is full of dinosaurs. But it doesn't matter she escapes, narrowly avoids being eaten by medium size dinosaur, outruns a T-Rex, avoids another T-Rex, is recaptured by Kong, who then fights three T-Rex's whilst carrying our heroine. They all fall into large ravine being saved by vines where the fight continues.... at this point I had to take a break.

I know, this is a fantasy, and no doubt kids will love it, but come on some small attempt at realism would add so much to the film. So far the best thing in the film is the CGI Kong - and thats great because if Kong is rubbish then you are in serious trouble. So my ratings so far are:

Kong - 5 Stars

Naomi Watts - 4 Stars

Jack Black - 2 Stars

Script - 2 stars

Direction - 3 stars

7602305,4,B01AHWLX2O,"I went to this film with mixed expectations. On the one hand, it was a Peter Jackson film (Lord of the Rings), so I knew it would have high production values. On the other, with all the hype and over $200 M budget, I knew it was bound to be typically formulaic, slick Hollywoodland fare. As it turned out, it was formulaic and slick, but also an extremely entertaining roller coaster ride of a movie.

When it starts out, we are treated to a wonderful re-creation of depression era New York City, a tip-of-the-hat to the original 1933 Marian C. Cooper film. We meet renegade filmmaker Carl Denham - played without distinction by comedian Jack Black - who realizes he's considered washed-up by his business associates and has to come up with a way to redeem himself. He discovers out-of-work actress Ann Darrow - played enchantingly by Naomi Watts - and talks her into going with him on an old freighter to Singapore, where he says he will be shooting his next film. In reality, he's headed for Skull Island, a mysterious, undiscovered place the superstitious crew have heard of and are convinced they won't return from. At this point, everything seems tame and predictable - but nothing could be further from the truth.

Carl Denham has a plan to salvage his career, and he's willing to stoop to any level and sacrifice anybody to do it. He has mislead his leading lady; kidnapped his writer, playwright Jack Driscoll - well played by Adrien Brody; deceived the ship's captain, Englehorn - played decently by Thomas Kretschmann; and is fleeing his associates, his creditors and the law. Carl is an opportunist, a user and a liar, which was not true of the original Carl Denham. Everyone on board the freighter is ready to part company with the conniving showman, especially the captain, when they enter a fog. Where they end up - fortuitously for Denham - is Skull Island.

Now the tone changes. The first thing our little party of filmmakers experience is an horrific ordeal with the island's natives, perhaps the most blood-curdling depiction of devil-worship ever. Now we realize what we're in for - but it's too late to extract ourselves because we're hooked. We, like Denham, have to find out what's beyond the great wall the natives have built.

After Kong steals the sacrificed Ann, we follow him into the jungle and find out that it's a prehistoric world, untouched by civilization. One of the most enjoyable scenes is when the filmmakers and crew come across some grazing dinosaurs. Something spooks them, and the herd starts stampeding in the direction of our party. They try to get away, but soon find themselves all mixed in with this pell-mell mob, dodging giant feet and teeth and rushing headlong down a hill as the monsters step on and fall over each other. They finally come to the bottom of the hill, which ends in a hairpin turn over a cliff that many of them fail to negotiate - and so over they go. Then the cliff starts collapsing under the weight of all those gigantic beasts and people - so more go over. It has to be one of the most exciting scenes ever filmed.

One of the least enjoyable scenes is when our party find themselves in a swamp, being attacked by giant bugs. The filmmakers used every means at their disposal to terrify and gross us out. When I saw that scene, I knew I would not be purchasing the DVD. It was too much and unnecessary.

There were other thrilling scenes in the jungle, as well as touching scenes between the beauty, Ann, and the beast, Kong. When she tries to get on the good side of Kong by entertaining him with some of her vaudeville routine, it is both funny and pathetic. But of course, by this time, we're ready to get back to New York City with Kong and see what happens when he escapes.

Once he's been captured, the filmmakers whisk us away to Times Square and the theater where Kong is going to have his big debut. This part of the film reminded me a lot of Phantom of the Opera. It was very effective, with Kong, of course, escaping and reeking havoc in Times Square. I loved the yellow cabs. A fun touch was having Kong find Ann, and together go rollicking through Central Park, ending on a frozen pond where they play around on the ice.

The final scene on the Empire State Building is good, but as Naomi Watts is continually trying to climb to the top of the building to be with Kong, and he is continually trying to place her somewhere safe, I'm thinking, ""He's got more sense than she does."" Nothing in the film explains her obsession with him, or her lack of fear climbing up the Empire State Building. The biggest disappointment of all was when Kong was finally killed by the attacking airplanes, and falls to the streets below. I didn't feel any pity for him. I didn't feel anything, and I'm a big lover of animals and a big crybaby at movies. I was really stunned by this, that the filmmakers had failed so completely to move me.

For special effects and a good visual roller coaster ride, this movie is a success. As far as a good story with well-developed characters, interesting dialogue and meaningful plot, it is a flop. Once again Hollywoodland has proven that a big budget doesn't guarantee a great movie. Story, script and acting do.

This film was the biggest dissapointment that I personally have ever received at the movie theater. The scenes where it looks like the ape is in love and especially the laughing and mock ice skating scenes were totally unnecessary and patently ridiculous. The special effects while impressive at times were so obviously CGI in certain scenes on the big screen that I thought I was watching a film from 15 years ago. I mean the dinosaurs in the first Jurassic park were way more believable. I my wife and 2 kids boys of 4 and 12 at the time respectively all thought the movie blew.

7602312,5,B01AHWLX2O,"One of my absolute favourite movies of all time and my best movie of 2005. I still recall my enchantment watching it in the theatre. Hands down, my best cinematic experience so far.

It is a visual delight, an edge of your seat thriller, a love story of every sort and a laugh out loud comedy all rolled into one marvellous package.

Peter Jackson is a genius. Spielberg is sooo yesterday. Peter Jackson is the new Steven Spielberg.

Before King Kong, Naomi Watts was one of those actresses I see a thousand times and never remember. In Kong, she shines like a true star. She is beautiful physically and in her spirit and actively so.

My favourite character however, just has to be the demented Carl Denham played to perfection by Jack Black who is no stranger to such roles but here, he takes it a notch further and it is a riot to watch his movie making passion degenerate into exploitative, desperate madness.

Adrien Brody does an expected and usual fine job of being the noble, quiet and brave hero. I like him a lot but he does nothing new here.

After watching it in theatres, I have seen this movie at least four or so times on dvd and each time is like the first time. Kong is a wonder. He is a hero and I love watching his love for Ann Darrow develop and blossom. His protectiveness is so endearing and the scene where Ann Darrow seeks his protection from the dinosaurs and Kong goes into alpha male mode shredding the dinosaurs to pieces is one of the highlights of the movie.

On dvd however, I haven't been able to re-watch the scene where Kong gets killed. I just cant bear it and I hurt with Ann Darrow.

I am very impressed by how tactfully and tastefully the relationship between Anna and Kong is treated. In our sex-drenched culture it could have easily degenerated into something perverse but it is instead sweet and affectionate.

Any movie starring the very talented Jamie Bell is always worth my while even though he got nothing more than a bit part.

7602314,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Jaw-dropping.  Heart-stopping.  Heartbreakingly tragic and sad.  All those and more describe the best movie of `05 & one of the best of all-time.  King Kong has always been a classic idea but neither the `33 original or the `78 remake was able to develop a fully realized story.

Jackson somehow managed to push all the right buttons: keeping the original characters (albeit with neccessary personality changes) while making them more 3-dimensional than either the `33 original or the `78 remake was able to, adding welcome new characters, keeping the prehistoric Skull Island from the original that was so full of life & dangers and the decision to keep it set in 1933.  Jackson's true stroke of genius began around the 1:20 mark when he did what the first 2 writers should've done: he developed a mutual bond between Ann & Kong, breaking the `creature feature' mold.  From then on, Ann (who's instantly a likeable, sympathetic character) goes on a rollercoaster ride of sad, sadder, & saddest starting with her rescue from some hungry T-Rexes that leads to a growing affection for Kong to her tragic mistake of trying to escape with Jack that leads to Kong's capture to her reunion with him & the tragedy that follows.  You're left with the feeling she regrets ever leaving the jungle but not ever having met Kong.

If I listed everything I loved about this film, it would be a page long.

7602318,4,B01AHWLX2O,"I won't go into the story, other reviewers have done that to death. But what I will do is echo what others have said about the image, sound and clarity of the HD-DVD version. If you have just purchased a HD-DVD player and HDTV, this is the movie to get. The jungle scenes alone are breathtaking in their clarity, color and sharpness. You can nearly count the raindrops as they are falling from the sky! Where HD-DVD becomes too good is in some of the special effects shots, especially during the stampede. In the conventional DVD, the scene is flat and everything blends well. In the HD-DVD version, the sharpness brings the actors forward from the background, almost 3D-like, and you can distinctly tell they are working with green screen. While this seems to be a complaint, it is really kuddos for HD-DVD, but the reason for the 4 stars. As more directors, editors and SFX houses go to full digital film making, they will also have to invent better ways to create these types of effects.

I have also compaired Blu-Ray v HD-DVD and have found that HD-DVD, when created from a true digital master (such as Kong), is far and away the better of the two formats.",1173312000,19,1161,4.555023923444976

The oceanic voyage coupled with all of the fierce escape and adventure type action on Skull Island was excellent!  The theme of ""beauty killed the beast"" sometimes fell short with me, particularly during the last half hour of the film when it was quickly layered on and then suddenly became something of an irregularity compared to what had just happened.  Overall great performances by Black and Watts and I really must tell you, if you want some adventure, this one takes Indiana Jones and Jurassic Park to a whole new level.  The bonus features on the widescreen edition are just okay, but I think I enjoy this enough to pick up the better set that includes multiple discs.",1173225600,,826,4.63013698630137

I've seen alot of remakes that just don't seem to get any better and that usually end up being worse than the original, not kong.  The first quarter or so of the movie is kind of too long for what it's trying to accomplish.  You know what the movie is about, a giant ape, don't spend to much time fleshing out insignificant's.  Unlike Titanic this film fails to keep you interested thru much of the first part.  Some how the movie goes from 0 to 150 in like a few seconds because once the crew hit skull island then the movie takes off.  Action seen after action seen and full use of the digital animation era.  Of course there are flaws in the film, but you have to remember this is a giant ape running lose and forget about them.  The movie left me shaking my head in disbelief at times, like the flailing of the actress (girl shoulda had wiplash).  All and all the movie has enough ""it"" to make it great.  It definitly is a watch, and although I didn't see it in a theatre, the special effects are so realistic and thrilling i'm sure it was awesome.",1172793600,,1142,4.265116279069767

Is the same Peter Jackson that directed Heavenly Creatures and Lord of the Rings? My God it looked like one of those cheap videos in youtube. The dialogs were so cheesy. Again, Is Adrien Brody an actor? Jack Black is a good comedian, but here is out of place. His face is just so funny, when he wants to be serious in a scene you can avoid to laugh as hell. Naomi Watts looks like a rookie driver in his first day driving the beltway. The character is too much for her. Being the first King Kong a classic, even the second is much better than this and yes, Jessica Lange is way more enjoyable to watch than Naomi",1172534400,6,735,4.183098591549296

I liked it so much I want to have the disc to watch it quality video, as compared to cable.  I also want my wife to watch it.  The only problem with this movie is that it is long, and you really should have uninterrupted time to enjoy it.  The romance of this movie really comes to life, and you will be heartbroken for poor Kong long before his final demise.  Don't let Jack Black scare you away.  He plays the role of a real jerk, and is perfect for it.",1172534400,2,629,3.976

And King Kong delivers on the premise in sheer scope, cenematic beauty, and bigger-than life story. The production was phenomenal in almost every way. In one instance, when Kong was sliding autos around the streets of Broadway, like a kid crashing matchbox cars, did the action look like CG creation (something in the sliding ape didn't look convincing). In every other scene, the work was awesome, detailed, and completely credibly produced.

Watch for character nuances in the non-speaking CG role of Kong, and you'll see another reason this 3rd-generation remake justifies the hype it got. Kong is a sympathetic character with a soft spot for Ann Darrow. Worth the 3 hours of pure enjoyment.",1172448000,,849,5.0212765957446805
7602325,1,B01AHWLX2O,"Unless you've been living under a rock for some 70 years, you know the plot of King Kong, the scoop on the remake, and are probably acquainted with several reviews of it.  So let's cut to the chase.  Why doesn't this film work?  OK -

1.  Ann Darrow is pummeled and flung around by Kong and assorted prehistoric beasts for what seems like hours, any 5 seconds of which would have popped her head off like a toy, yet emerges unscathed.  She also runs for hours barefoot through a wild jungle without suffering the slightest scratch to her feet

2.  Use of slow shutter speed when being terrorized by the natives for ""dramatic effect"" might work in an episode of ""Unsolved Mysteries,"" but we could expect more from a multi-gajillion dollar Hollywood blockbuster.

3.  Adrian Brody grabs Ann and flies a pterodactyl from a mountain ledge down to the jungle floor.  `Nuff said.

4.  Jack Black demonstrates the acting range that has made him a leading contender for the role of ""Nacho Libre 2.""

5.  Streets of New York, including Police cars, screaming pedestrians and assorted carnage and destruction, are nonsensically calmed and cleared during Kong's rampage through New York City to make way for a slo-motion Armani evening gown catwalk sequence.

6.  The producers of King Kong were apparently forced to sign the ""every actor in every action movie must run across a series of bridges or groundwork which collapse into the abyss 0.003 seconds after they step off"" clause.

7.  Brontosaurus stampede is ridiculous, CGI is unconvincing, and every actor in the movie should have been crushed dead within 12 seconds but isn't.  Sequence also seems to last for 45+ minutes

8.  After finally capturing Kong, the now-damaged and too small vessel is tasked with carrying him.  Then we inexplicably cut to New York City where Kong has safely arrived.  ??????

9.  Standing atop the Empire State Building in high heels poses no threat of falling due to winds, vertigo, or exhaustion

10.  Nights in New York last from 10 PM to 11:45 PM, at which point the sun rises again.  I had no idea New York City occupied the same latitude as Nome, Alaska

11.  Does Kong get relentlessly attacked every night by hordes of pterodactyls?  If so, why?  And if not, why now?

12.  Are we supposed to believe that with much of the crew missing and maybe being killed, with the ship barely seaworthy and in desperate need of attention, the other crewmates have nothing better to do than discuss classic literature?

13.  For that matter, why are many of these shipmates introduced, fleshed out, and never mentioned again?

14.  How come no one in a staff of thousands working on the movie noticed any of the above?",1172188800,10,2690,4.727861771058316
7602326,5,B01AHWLX2O,"The first hour is slow but once Skull Island is reached, Kong provides us with one thrill after another.  Here is a spoiler, Kong after shaking the crewmen from the log, rushes to save the heroine from not one, but three T-Rex terrors.  It is the greatest fight between creatures ever captured on film.  Earlier homage was paid to the original Kong by reference to a ""Fay"" meaning Fay Raye and that she was making a movie for ""Cooper"" meaning Merrian C.Cooper.  When his name is mentioned, a musical motif from the orignal briefly sounds.

The fight with the T-Rexes is incredible and Kong shows why he is king of that island.  The effects are terrific and when Kong ends up one on one with the lone surviving T-Rex, he approaches the beast with a huge roar, beating his chest, immediately seizing the Rex by the jaws and after struggling, kills him in identical fashion to the original.  He then stands atop the final and finally dead T-Rex and beats his chest, roaring his triumph for all to hear.

A great remake with good but not great casting, I rate it five stars because the action (especially the fight and the scene in the darkness under the fallen log) is superb.  A must see.",1172188800,,1186,4.5046728971962615
7602327,4,B01AHWLX2O,"Yes Peter Jackson's remake of the 1933 classic is flawed. While I didn't mind the extra time devoted to character development in the beginning, judging from many of the other reviews it's obviously too long for some viewers. Director Peter Jackson may be accused by some as the king of bloat, endlessly padding his movies with superfluous action scenes that don't really move the story along and Kong is no exception. The most obvious example for me is the dinosaur stampede scene. Jack Black and crew run under a herd of brachiosaurs while being simultaneously hunted by velociraptors. Well, a little or a lot of belief suspension is needed depending on your point of view and it is action for action's sake. But this is a fantasy movie, an escapist diversion designed to entertain, which it does quite well. This isn't Citizen Kane and it isn't ment to be. It's not meant to conform to reallity. Let's face it, if Kong were real, every time he moved the weight of his body would snap his arms and spine like twigs. But for the most part the action is outstanding, especially Kong's battle with three tyranosaurs and the scenery and sets are wonderful.

But where PJ succeeds is not in the over the top choreographed action sequences, but in the emotional resonance he brings to Kong. He was able to make a CGI monkey not only believable, but a powerful character in his own right. He's not just a monster. Kong is portrayed as an embattled warrior/king whose scared body belies his ultimate loneliness. He is the last of his kind and his human-like pathos is amazing and palpable. Andy Serkis the actor who also played Gollum in the Lord Of The Rings was the model for King Kong and it is his facial expressions that were used as the basis for Kong. He really should win some sort of award for ""best digital actor"" or whatever you would call it as it is a new category marvelously pioneered by he, PJ and the effects folks. Kong is ultimately destroyed by his love for Ann Darrow portrayed by Naomi Watts and it is this relationship, his love and her sympathy and empathy for this lonely king that makes this movie so compelling. Kong is a tragic and sympathetic figure. The  moment he dies you can see the light go out of his eyes, a remarkable bit of CGI wizardry and it is truly sad. As Jack Black says at the end of the movie with dialog lifted verbatim from the original, ""twas beauty killed the beast.""

As far as the DVD is concerned Peter Jackson and company have once again outdone themselves in the extra features department. There's enough to keep you occupied for some time. Well done.",1171843200,6,2599,4.5610278372591
7602328,5,B01AHWLX2O,"When I first saw Peter Jackson's re-make of Kong in the theater, I liked it a lot as an hommage, and a modern re-telling, of one of the classic films of all time. In the theater, though, it seemed almost too much, both in length and its non-stop assult on the senses in the final two acts.

So I'm glad to report how pleased I am with the Extended Edition release.  As in LOTR, the Extended Edition has a way of seeming *shorter* because, I suspect, the pace is more regulated and plot details are filled in that make the whole seem more seamless.  The picture quality is stunning, and the Dolby 5.1 sound is great so far as it goes.  (My only gripe: why no Dolby 7.1 EX option, or even better, a DTS ES option as in LOTR?)

The extras are great and are far more informative and detailed than the Production Diaries, for those of us who are fascinated by the process of filmmaking.

To give some context for these comments, they come from a Monster Kid of the '50's who grew up on the classic monsters on television and in Famous Monsters magazine.  I hope that Jackson's film in whatever cut, and extras such are provided here, inspire new generations of monster kids and filmmakers alike.  It probably seems old-fashioned to say so, but this quality of devotion to filmmaking, and this kind of glimpse into the world behind the film, offer modern-day viewers an experience that we ""back in the day"" could only have dreamed of.",1171756800,2,1428,4.444444444444445
7602329,4,B01AHWLX2O,"This was an excellent version of a classic story. King Kong was outstanding in his looks and behavior. The best one ever, I feel.

The only minor objection was the over long and totally unbelievable section, when they were all running in a herd of Brontosauruses, as if they all would not have been crushed to death. And the insect scene, although aptly instilling a greater fear for this mysterious Island, might have been a bit too much, but that all sinks into oblivion when the whole movie takes over your senses and emotions and gives it a great adventurous ride of a lifetime. GREAT! BRAVO!",1171411200,2,751,4.696969696969697
7602331,4,B01AHWLX2O,"I just finished watching the entire 3 disc extended edition with all the extras, including the film with commentary by Peter Jackson and screenwriter Philippa Boyens. I must say it was worthwhile as I am a Kong-a-phile. There are many insights into the making of the film, but what stood out for me in the commentary was the fact that Jackson evidently did NOT have final say in what was to appear on the screen. I was amazed to find him admit that he had to cut out two great dinosaur action sequences on Skull Island to shorten the film. Those two dinosaur scenes (which are included in this edition) amounted to 13 minutes of great action. Peter Jackson was convinced by the screenwriters to ""develop"" the characters to the point where he had to shorten the film time. He gave in and eliminated two action scenes: the ""crossing-the-swamp scene"" and ""the Stegasaurus"" scene. These scenes were, as he explains, an ""homage"" to the original 1933 Kong. Both cut-out scenes used different creatures than the original 1933 version, but he really wanted them in the theatrical version. You'll also see the ONLY ANIMATRONIC dinosaur used in the film. It was cut out of the theatrical version. (a large flightless bird-like creature). The screenwriters and producers pressured him to cut the time down. In my view, cutting out seven minutes on board ship getting to to Skull Island and seven minutes back in New York at Adrien Brody's play and Naomi Watts' floundering dance routine, etc., would have made up for the time needed for the two dinosaur sequences and would have certainly quickened the pace of the original theatrical film.

  At one point Jackson regrets cutting out so much of the action and says he wants to make it again. My advice: Dump the committee and do the film again. He even suggests, laughingly, that the Venture would have to stop and refuel in South American where Kong escapes, finds a lost world of dinosaurs and gets re-captured before going to New York. You can tell he has his regrets about the final theatrical cut!

 EXTRAS: The extras in this edition show many deleted scenes on board ship. They are mostly of the crew and computer generated Pre-Visualization, called CG Pre-Viz, for short, which was absolutely necessary to make this film and to make Kong come to life. You'll see a Pre-Viz Kong leaping across New York skyscrapers. One great Pre-Viz sequence is the Bronto stampede. You'll see how it was conceived and made. You'll see Andy Sirkis (who was also Lumpy the Cook) doing Kong body and facial movements, being computer recorded [aka: undergoing motion capture] against blue and green screens and much more. This is how Kong was brought to life, literally. You'll go into the WETA workshop and see the artists and sculptors at work making 3D dinosaurs and Kongs. You'll see how an exact scale model of the Venture was built and used in many of scenes. Also, how a full size 1950's diesel ship was purchased and retro-fitted to look like a 1930's tramp steamship. You'll be amazed to see how the special effects crew got a robot computer program to rebuild 1933 New York City right before your very eyes. It can rebuild, on a computer screen, any street and any building known to exist in 1933 Manhattan. There's a birthday film that the crew did for Peter Jackson; it's somewhat funny. And there are plenty of Kong artwork from the 1996 pre-production film that was never made and artwork from this production put to music that shows, in story-board format, how the director and writers put scenes together. There are full 1996 and 2005 scripts on ROM. A gag reel that isn't that funny. What was most amazing was that just about everything in a scene of the film was CG and believeable.",1171324800,3,3728,4.729230769230769
7602332,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Cinematography is just classic Jackson.  It's very beautiful to watch.  It's slow at times though.  I'm glad the high action happened soon in the film.  I loved the stampede & T-Rex scenes although some of it seemed waaaaay too impossible.  Like, why would THREE different t-rexes go after one single chic when there are several other creatures to comsume?  Why would the first t-rex chase after her after it just ate the other dinosaur?  Anyway, we won't get into technical survival tactics cuz that will just make me sound like a discovery channel/animal planet addict.

Some hated the scene where Jane & Kong are scooting around on the frozen lake but I loved it.  I thought it was a very nice quiet moment amidst the chaotic police chase.  I still loved it.  I don't care if it was overrated (which I admit it really was).",1171324800,,826,4.627586206896551
7602333,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I rented his movie to see the CG effects, which looked awesome in the early trailers. I expected little from the plot. What a pleasant surprise! Director Jackson found a way to add layers of detail and subtlety to an implausible story. By putting together a stellar team of creatives, and actors, Jackson has turned a ""B pic"" cult movie into a ""A class"" film.

Making a story about a giant gorilla is certainly dicey. Turning that gorilla into a sympathetic character is a seemingly impossible task. Jackson carefully crafted a story line depicting a lonely giant that has a gentle side. Part of this gentle side is love of beauty. Whether it is Naomi Watts character, or a beautiful sunset. This drive turns the monster into a sympathetic character.

Special attention should be given to the direction of the story boarding. Few films have demonstrated such frame by frame compositional perfection.

Then there is the look of the film, which carefully recreates the depression era. Exceptional scene lighting sets the mood together with a subtle music score.

Finally there is the actors. Naomi Watts is exceptional as the lead Ann Darrow, both in look and acting ability. This is, without a doubt, the most important casting choice of the movie. To pull off the emotional impact of the story, it is critical that the relationship between Kong and Ann Darrow work. Watts hit a home run. The other part of this unusual(?) relationship was brilliantly achieved, via the efforts of Andy Serkis. Serkis acted out the role of Kong, just as he did Golem in Lord of the Rings.

The rest of the cast is similarly effective both in looking the part and in acting ability.

This kind of depth of talent on both the acting side, and the creative, is rare. Fortunately the powers that be, in Hollywood (those who make the money decisions), have been willing to invest in such large talent pools. I am going to use another sports analogy: Enough money will buy you a football team. If however, you want to win a superbowl, you need a special group of individuals. You need people, who are willing to do more then just put in a performance. You need people willing to pull out all the stops. This group did just that, and in doing so, created a genre masterpiece.",1171152000,,2250,4.6835443037974684

From casting to capturing the feel of the 1930s; the directing is splendid. I'm a fan of Jack Black and was a little sceptical at first about how he would pull off his role until I saw him in action. Adrien Brody also held his own, but more impressive to me was Naomi Watts.
The relationship between her and Kong was one that U could 'really' feel, especially in the scenes where he protected her against the wild prehistoric creatures.
I think anyone who may not have seen this movie yet will be impressed with the look of the sunset and skyline scenes as well as the dark and frightening feel of Skull Island and the primitive people who lurk there.

Also notable is the special effects of which my 'favorite' is the creation of the gigantic insects that the crew had to fight off.

7602340,4,B01AHWLX2O,"King Kong is a great movie, the extras on this edition are very interesting to watch but the only let down is the packaging, this is not a deluxe edition it's ""cheaper edition"", I was waiting something more like the extended editions of the lord of the rings but Universal didn't want to spend money on this set. Try harder next time, King Kong deserves something better",1169337600,,370,4.537313432835821
7602341,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I saw this movie in the theatre when it was first released and I was dazzled. I am a big King Kong fan and I came into this movie very skeptical. However, I was so pleased with it that I had to go out and buy it on DVD. I waited and bought the extended edition which makes the movie even longer. However, the added scenes actually make it even more enjoyable to watch, rather than detract. I will go out on a limb here and say that from this writer's perspective, this version of Kong is better than the 1933 original not just because of superior technology (although I am a sucker for giant, realistic,life-like creatures battling it out with each other), but the overall acting, pacing, character development, and above all, interaction between our heroine Ann and the giant ape far surpasses the original. This version of Kong is the most believable and expressive creature you will ever see. Regardless of its length, King Kong is BIG screen entertainment. From the arrival on Skull Island, to the magnificant climax on the Empire State Building, this is just a cinematic masterpiece that you will want to own & watch over and over again, rather than toss in the forgotten DVD bin. Highly recommended and worthy of 5 stars.",1169251200,3,1227,4.607305936073059
7602342,2,B01AHWLX2O,"I'm not going to critisize the plot of the film because it ultimately adheres quite closely to the original 1933 Merian C. Cooper version of the film. However this film is 187min long and in order to fill this extra time it digresses into silly nonsense for large portions of the film.  A problem I had was that while watching it I was constantly being reminded of other films like `Jurassic Park' (Dinosaurs share characteristics) `Apocalypse Now' (one person is reading Heart of Darkness)  `Lord Of The Rings' (Villagers mannerisms are similar to Gollum) and `Titanic' to name a few. Another problem I have is with the cinematography, which is just too colourful for my palette. Of courses there is an unnecessary excess of CGI in this film. There was a time when special affects were used in films to create the illusion of reality now special affects seem to be used to make things seem unreal. We can easily sit now and point out what is CGI and what is not and besides some of it is so appallingly bad it's hard to miss, the dinosaur stampede especially. As for the attempt to develop a relationship between Ann Darrow and the 25 ft ape, it is completely laughable.

I had high hopes for the Lord Of The Rings trilogy and was disappointed so I wasn't really expecting much here. For me Peter Jackson's best two films will always be `Bad Taste' (1989) and `Brain Dead' (1992). I prefer the original King Kong over this boring nonsense any day.",1168905600,4,1448,4.583011583011583

7602351,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I LOVED this film and only saw it for the first time in my life on this DVD with all the extra scenes I never would have seen at the movies-- and paid more to see to boot!  (My credit-card company gave me a $20 discount on Amazonia which came in real handy here.)  Naturally, the extra background and production content made this thing a real steal, but I have yet to see any of that in favor of watching the near-3-hour-long flick itself 3 times so far.  That's the ONLY kind of DVD worth investing in anyway... one you could watch 25 times till you memorize every bit of dialog and scenery... and then watching it another 80 times!  Like The Wizard of Oz!

This Remake has plenty of reverence for the original and has an exceptional level of coherent internal logic; it leaves less glaring continuity errors than any sci-fi/horror/adventure epic-picture I've seen in a long time.  It won't give you the same raised-hair-on-the-back-of-your-neck suspense and dread of the Original, but what will?  Dig those modern special effects!  ...even though, like all recent CGI (except the Jurassic Park fare), the beasties MOVE WAY TOO FAST.  Good thing you can slow things down with a DVD machine.

Say, maybe that's why the first 'Kong was so much more frightening and impressive:  All that jerky, deliberate motion made a far more spooky impact than blur-fast animation...?  But, if that's true, how come Godzilla-puppetry only makes us laugh?

7602354,5,B01AHWLX2O,"The missing bits were really missed by this lover of the old King Kong.

I was so glad to see these scenes in the extended edition. For those who think this film is too long I won't try to sell you on those missing parts because I think only those of us who knew they were there, and what they were, could really appreciate them. Also, you had the option of buying the theatrical cut instead, so why anyone would complain about the additional scenes is a mystery to me.

The story was even more poignant for me because of the added texture the extended scenes added to the profoundly violent and deadly nature of Skull island. This was a place that killed you or scarred you, and it explains very well the extreme lifestyle adopted by the islanders. Despite all the horror and tragedy we see Denham as an exploiter in this cut. He's not be sympathized and he deserves the fate he's handed for his arrogance and his greed. He's oddly a likable person but he's also clearly flawed, and perhaps beyond redemption. What I like about this new version of Kong is the fact that at it's heart it feels like the same movie that Willis O'Brien made all those years ago. Peter Jackson, however, considered his audience and decided not just to WOW! them but also to educate them on the world of movie adventure. His message rings lod and clear; adventure, even on film, is not glamorous and it is rarely fun. In this case, it is lethal. Ironically Kong comes through as the lone survivor of his kind on Skull Island and it's is that staid life in 'civilization' that is more savage than he can cope with. In the end not only beauty killed the beast, but, also, the greed and fear that is ever apparent in the world of human beings.",1168300800,,1719,4.385579937304075

7602356,4,B01AHWLX2O,"By now we should all know the story of King Kong. It all hinges on whether or not you can believe that such a savage ""creature"" can actually fall in love with a beautiful woman and that she can love him, too. By the end of this 3 hour plus film you will be brought to tears if you have a heart. Peter Jackson pushes emotional buttons in much the way he did in the Lord of the Rings films so when you watch expect to gripped in a way only he can. It is a distinctly Peter Jackson film. The natives on Skull Island just remind me so much of the orcs in LOTR, too.

Naomi Watts does a good job of showing her love for Kong in a way similar to the story of Beauty and the Beast. In fact the way this version of King Kong is put together does have some elements of Beauty and the Beast with Kong being tamed by a beautiful woman and a score of men hunting the beast because they fear him. Although the way this ends is decidely less uplifting but no less emotionally gripping than that fairy tale.

You will want to see Jack Black dead by the end of the movie. He plays the movie producer that risks the lives of his crew to make a fortune. When that bombs with the death of several crew members and finally the destruction of the camera he hatches a scheme to capture Kong again for the sake of greed.

On the negative side there seems to be too many sequences where the movie almost becomes Jurassic Park squeezed into the middle of the movie. We have Brontosaur type dinosaurs, small T-Rex type dinosaurs, and the classic huge T-Rex. The scene where Kong fights several T-Rexes in this version is quite awesome.

On the technical side this HD-DVD offers wonderful picture quality and crisp Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 audio. I have no complaints there. It is a solid 4 stars out of 5.",1167955200,,1777,4.187134502923977
7602357,2,B01AHWLX2O,"Despite its flaws I am a big fan of Peter Jackson's three hour overproduced, overblown version of ""King Kong"".  Being an owner of the two disc version of the original theatrical cut I have to say this three disc version isn't really necessary.

First of all the extended scenes don't really add anything to the story.  We see enough weird creatures in the original cut attacking the hunting party that we don't need to see a another attack by a dinosaur nor do we need to see a giant swamp creature attacking the rescue party.  Not that these are bad scenes.  They are just kind of there.

Now there is a scene towards the end of the movie in which a military guy gives an awful speech, ""This town was created by humans for humans and I am not gonna let some dirty ape destroy it"" Blah blah blah.  This was a bad scene and should have been included in the deleted scenes.

Speaking of the deleted scenes, most of them are on the boat ride. Had Jackson including them the running time of King Kong would have been closer to four hours with at least another half an hour on the already long boat ride.

As for the ""Making of"" documentaries:  If you've seen the extended versions of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies you might find these documentaries seem redundant.  And at almost every turn of production the phrase, ""This movie alone was much harder than all three 'Rings' movies combined"".  That is said about the building of each set, Andy Serkis acting as King Kong, and well, so many times I figure it to be hype.

If you are a big fan of this flick just stick with the two disc version.  The only reason to buy this is the movie is presented on two discs giving the movie a higher bit rate.",1167955200,6,1693,4.3164556962025316
7602358,5,B01AHWLX2O,"King Kong contains more breathtaking moments than any movie I've ever seen.  From a scene where someone is wildly shooting giant mosquitos with a machine gun (without hitting the person the mosquitos are swarming around) to the power of love between woman and ape.  It all culminates with a majestic ice skating scene that will bring you back to the nostalgia of Brian Boitano.  I love movies that find a way to make the unnatural (a giant, wild ape playfully ice skating in a foreign land with a human being he has developed feelings for) seem natural.

This movie teaches that if you want something bad enough, you can get it.  Example, the giant ape learns to speak the word ""beautiful"" both in sign language *and* in English!  The irony here is that he thought the sunset and woman were beautiful, but he probably lacked the intelligence to grasp that his behavior that night was the most beautiful thing of all!",1167868800,,916,4.658385093167702
7602359,4,B01AHWLX2O,"It was the most powerful connection, I think, between a structure and a city and a fictional character that the 20th century had ever seen...

Of all the ""King Kong"" films that exist, Peter Jackson's new Kong is, without any doubt, the best... The film won 3 Oscars, for sound editing, sound mixing, and visual effects... It is set in 1933 where America was facing economic troubles unlike any seen before...

Jackson wanted 1933 New York to be very, very authentic... He recreates a chaotic, crazy, busy city bustling and vibrant... The streets were absolutely jam packed with cars, trams, buses, crowded with hawkers and thousands of people ... The Empire State Building had just been built...

Jackson goes in the heart of New York and describes the Depression by showing private security forces raiding buildings; mass evictions of people who simply could not pay their rent; people winding up as squatters; and long line of people waiting to be fed...

He gives a little hint about the Prohibition: police busting up an illegal still; Carl Delham getting a box of whiskey to take upon his trip and it's labeled ""Lemonade."" And oddly enough, he presents the end of Prohibition, when we see some liquor advertising at the climax of the movie that wasn't there at the beginning...

Jackson also introduces vaudeville... Vaudeville was a variety show, a string of acts put together to form a complete bill of entertainment... Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) was one of vaudeville good-looking actress who loses her job due to the lack of money...

Skull Island was another very important location for Jackson... The amount of imagination and creativity that went into the ideas behind it is quite amazing... The zoology, the flora and fauna, the cultural history of that impossible island is thrilling... It was, indeed, a huge work to rebuild a hellish place of inexhaustible mysteries...

We are talking about small group of desperate souls eking out the barest existence possible... Natives who have come to worship a giant gorilla--named ""Kong"" by them-- as some sort of god, practicing human sacrifice to appease his anger...

We are also talking about a lush jungle and tropical rain forest with giant reptiles with very large feet to cope with the uneven and broken terrain of the island... We are talking not only about dinosaurs but also beasts just as terrible, or even worse... We're talking about a natural predator trap full of rotting carcasses and scavenger creatures... We are also talking about giant, parasitic, warm-like creatures which are much more than active predators and scavengers... We are talking about perils resided not only in the depths of the island but in the skies as well, where terrifying flying creatures ruled...

""King Kong"" delivers a fantasy-adventure piece, with its balance of peril and romance in much the same way ""Titanic"" did... The romance part is not where one would expect it, but involves a beast with a beautiful and fragile creature who experience a tender if unexplained bond... And this union is the finest moment of the film... Ann looks into the ape's eyes and sees something impressionable there... And the audience notices it too... Jackson has done something emotional here... In addition to the ape's beastly character, Kong gazes at Ann and shows true, endearing traits... We are struck by his protective nature as we can understand the desires of each to protect the other... Ann can't escape this fateful meeting that changes everything... It's as if her whole life has been a prelude to this moment...

Jackson's ""King Kong"" is a grandiose thrilling adventure, sufficiently magical and colorful whether it's reverently watching a sunset, or doing some ice-skating ...",1167782400,2,3727,5.035714285714286

For example, the extended scenes on the boat work better ,and makes us CARE more about the characters ,and why some of them risked their lives to save Ann Darrow. This part of the film still suffers because of poor editing choices. It's a shame that Mr. Jackson didn't take advantage to fix this problem.

7602365,3,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson's King Kong is a potentially great movie undone by excess.  Set design, special effects, acting, and overall 'atmosphere' are great.  There are scenes with real power like the one atop the Empire State Building and in Central Park.  But 'the whole' never quite clicked for me because it was too long and too much: too high a gross out quotient; too much improbability (and yes I know this is a movie about a giant ape and a lost island) such as the scene with the humans running amongst stampeding dinosaurs; and too much of a 'let's see if we can top the original movie' mindset like when Kong battling three T-Rexes (what's wrong with battling just one?).  After a while it all felt a little tedious despite the real positives mentioned above and particularly the standout performance by Andy Serkis as Kong.",1166227200,10,824,4.701388888888889
7602366,4,B01AHWLX2O,"When people hear the name ""King Kong"" they instantly think of a giant monkey that climbed the empire state building with a screaming blonde in his oversized (and opposible thumbed) hand, but when I think of King Kong the first thing I think of (as cheesy as it may sound) is love.

  King Kong is (above and beyond all the action and CGI) a love story.
The movie begins with aspiring actress Ann Darrow (played by the ethereal and spot-on Naomi Watts) being offered a part in a major motion picture being filmed by Carl Denham (played by Jack Black-who I think was a little bit miscast in this role). Ann takes the offer reluctantly and boards the dirty, cargo ship along with the a whole crew of misled sailors, and Adrien Brody's character Jack Driscoll (who is the writer of the movie being filmed).

The crew of the ship and the actors and film makers are soon voyaging across the sea, aimlessly searching for Skull Island, a mythical place that Carl is set on finding. When they DO find the island, the locals aren't so keen on them and bloodshed occurs shortly after. The primitive, dentally challenged tribe puts there sights on Ann and soon after she is kidnapped, tied up, and stolen away in the night by Kong.

  I don't really want to give too much away by going into a long, boring summary of what happens in the film, but instead will just point out the highs and lows of the movie.

  Peter Jackson (The Lord Of The Rings) has created another epic cinematic acheivement with Kong. The film is action packed. There is literally a 12 minute or so fight scene between Kong and a trio of nasty dinosaurs, a creepy battle between men and giant bugs, a dino-chase scene that blows Jurassic Park out of the water, and an ape running amuck in New York City.

  But, underneath all of the action, adventure and CGI effects, the best part of this film is the relationship between Ann and Kong.
  Naomi Watts does an excellent job building her friendship and love for Kong. She  geniously plays Ann with a mixture of whimsy, grace and innocence. Her belief in destiny and fate lead her emotions throughout the film, and that is truly a beautiful thing to see.

  Another interesing part of the movie was the budding romance between Jack and Ann. Adrien Brody plays the brainy-screen and theater writer with a very authentic 1940's feel. His odd, strange looks make him somewhat more relatable than any other mainstream stars would have been, which makes him likeable as Kong's main rival for Ann's affection. Jack and Ann share an obvious romance almost from the start, which adds a love-triangle element to the film

Eventually, Ann finds that Kong, despite his monstrous stature and fearsome, chest pounding roars, is a big softy who only wants to protect and care for her.
 What would you do if you had been snatched up by a giant gorilla, after the fear and horror fade and you realize that the ""beast"" loves and cares for you? As a viewer, we are exposed to one woman's reaction to this. Ann fears Kong, but her feelings change after he constantly rescues her. You feel her blossoming love for him pour into your heart as she tries to explain the meaning of ""Beautiful"" as he gazes thoughtfully at a magnificant sunset.

  The two characters soon share a bond so strong that it can only be defeated by death. Most people know the way the story ends, and it IS tragic. Ann and Kong's love story will bring some viewers to there knees sobbing. You will smile as the Beauty and her beast share a heartfelt moment sliding on the ice in central park. You will gasp as Kong is pelted with bullets but still manages to protect his beloved Ann...and as she tries to return the favor for once, climbing the building and flinging herself in front of him, trying to stop the pilots from killing her beloved ape. And in those final moments when Kong looks lovingly at her with those sad, knowing eyes, you will surely cry...If you don't-you are probably dead inside! This movie is one of the saddest I have seen in a lonnnnnnng time. The dramatic and haunting score also adds some points to the overall quality of the film. James Newton Howard does a great job, especially at the more profound moments in the movie. The music playing as Kong slips away from the building to his fate as Ann hysterically cries, is one of the saddest scores I have heard in a while, and the song BEAUTIFUL is what it's named after. I would have given the movie 5 stars if they had knocked out some of the action/CGI and focused a lot more on the love story.",1165881600,4,4534,4.507936507936508
7602367,4,B01AHWLX2O,"Ann Darrow is a starving actress who signs on to star in a movie by a maverick film maker. He is taking his crew to a mysterious island to make an over the top film to resurrect his career. When they arrive on the island, the native people capture Ann and offer her as a sacrifice to it turns out, an enormous gorilla. In trying to rescue Ann, the ship and film crew capture the ape and take him back to New York where the film maker displays him in a Broadway theater, until he escapes his chains and runs amok in New York City.

The movie's writer has fallen in love with Ann. In his fervor to rescue her, he feels nothing but anger toward the great ape. But Ann has fallen in love with the beast and he with her. He has shown her a compassionate, contemplative side. He has risked his life and protected her from other creatures on the island like dinosaurs. When they are back in New York, Ann feels lost being separated from Kong and seeing him as a prisoner.

Peter Jackson's King Kong is a visually spectacular movie. The effects are wonderful. Kong looks like a real gorilla unlike past versions of the great ape. All the scenes with animals and insects on the island are very well done. The movie is also written very well. It moves along nicely and the pace keeps stepping. The sentimentality between Kong and Ann is different from other versions of this film and while it seems odd at first, it works in the end. In fact, it is this love between them that makes Kong's death in the end one of the saddest things I've seen on film. The camera focuses on his eyes, on his feeling for Ann and the life draining out of them.

The only complaint I have about the movie is its length. There are several scenes that go on far too long and so make the movie overlong. All in all though, this is a wonderful movie.",1165708800,,1816,4.242774566473988

7602369,4,B01AHWLX2O,"I wanted King Kong to be a great movie.  Unfortunately some elements of this film were so bizarre that any chance of this happening were lost. It's O.K. to accept a wild premise like a 25-foot tall gorilla; but common sense demands some attention to logic even in a wild fantasy. Here are my complaints:

1. Ann Darrow was secured to the sacrificial altar and unable to extricate herself. When King Kong grabbed her, he would've ripped her arms off.  A wooden cage would have been more logical. Picking that cage apart would've been a neat task for the SFX crew.

2. The crossing of the swamp was replaced by that ridiculous stampede sequence. Ever try running in front of a herd of elephants? After that scene I started to get uneasy.

3. The chasm of insects was too deep for anyone to survive the fall... and there were too many INSECTS! More is not better. Lumpy deserved a more courageous demise.

4. How did any of the crew know where to go to rescue anyone? There was no logical perspective of the island given and, considering how dense the jungle was, who knew that there was a signpost up ahead with Rod Serling directing traffic.

5. I bet you didn't know that some transient Vampire bats moved into Kong's flat the night before. They must have else wouldn't Kong have relocated long ago? But school is not out yet! Lesson One-Introduction to hang gliding is coming up. Where's a pterodactyl when we need one?

6. Catch a falling T-Rex in a vine. Win a trip to absurdity.

7. It was absolutely positively IMPOSSIBLE to load King Kong on that ship! But let's say you could. Now all we have to do is keep him sedated with chloroform for (how long a voyage?), and sustain him with bananas intravenously fed.

8. Poor Ann Darrow had to run around New York City in dead winter wearing what looked like a gown-less evening strap and she didn't even shiver not once.

After all these crabby comments, I still liked the movie but I'm really sad to say that it wasn't what it could have been. You could still redo this, Peter, on the extended director's cut DVD.  Why not?",1165449600,10,2074,4.472148541114058
7602370,4,B01AHWLX2O,"This is a grand entertainment which represents the finest tribute to the original 1933 film KING KONG ever attempted by a long way.  It is a great ride on its own merits and a fine work of mainstream movie magic.

It is hard to overstate the loving care apparent in the execution of this reimagining of the classic story, from individual effects shots to the performances of a quality cast anchored, perhaps surprisingly -- NOT by Jack Black who is arguably and finally without doubt miscast -- but by the mesmerizing, lovely, sexy, sweet, sincere and wholely seductive Naomi Watts.

I do wholeheartedly recommend Peter Jackson's unreservedly ambitious, all-stops-out version of KING KONG, even though it entirely fails, with the exception of a moment or two with Miss Watts, to touch that part of my heart reserved for my lifelong love, the incomparable and virtually mystical movie production, the 1932-33 KING KONG.",1165363200,2,918,5.026315789473684
7602371,5,B01AHWLX2O,"To be perfectly honest, because I had never watched the original King Kong, or any of the remakes, I went in expecting nothing but a few good action scenes, and a predictable, tacked on story at the very end.  Boy was I wrong.

I seriously enjoyed every moment of this film.  Well, *almost* every moment.  I have to agree with popular opinion that the first 45 minutes of the film were pretty long and unnecessary, however, we're talking about a 3 hour movie that honestly didn't disappoint after those beginning 45 minutes were over.  From that point on, the movie pretty much ruled.

My favorite part was the dinosaur chase.  It really DID look like the actors were being chased by those deadly dinosaurs.  The fight scenes between King Kong and the dinosaurs was another lengthy dose of nonstop excitement.  You simply couldn't ask for better action.

As for the story, well, that was the one thing I was worried about, seeing as how this version of King Kong is the only one I know.  I could have sworn, judging by the black and white pictures I'd seen showing King Kong swinging around from the top of a building, that the story would be entirely overblown and far-fetched.  Once again, I was wrong.  The story honestly didn't disappoint.

I believe this movie deserved all the attention it received about a year ago.  It really is good, and it really is believable that a giant ape is chasing a bunch of people around.  I can't believe I actually felt some emotion when King Kong became close with Naomi's character.  Oh, by the way, Naomi Watts is now the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.  The interaction between her and King Kong was totally believable and emotional, and I can't believe I'm saying that!  It really works!

Some people will say the movie dragged, and was overlong.  However, what really happened was that Peter Jackson gave us probably the best version of King Kong we will ever see.  I haven't seen any of the previous ones so I can't say I'm entirely sure, but there will NEVER be another remake in the future as good as this one.",1165276800,3,2064,4.566757493188011
7602372,5,B01AHWLX2O,"King Kong (Universal, 2005) opens with a stark reminder that we are not so far removed from the blight of a global depression, which is as close to us, today, as the precarious slip of a capital economy. Prescient images of shapeless shanties, relentless poverty, and quiet desperation in America's First City, which suffused the ""civilized"" world, still captivate us nearly four score years later.

The film transports everyone--viewers, protagonists, and antagonists alike--to and from two insidious jungles, presumably by way of the Bermuda triangle (how else can one depart from the Northeast Atlantic, arrive in the Southwest Pacific, and then return to homeport in so short a span of time?) Man's jungle is a bleak labyrinth of concrete canyons framed by elevated trains, aimlessly clacking their way along rickety iron rails through a sooty city overpopulated with treacherous opportunists and callous moviemakers. They prey on the masses, numbed by appalling unemployment and deceitful indifference. The marginally fortunate are underemployed tradesmen, craftsmen, artisans, athletes and entertainers--the real Houdini's of society, escape artists who eke-out a bare bones existence. One of these is the hauntingly beautiful and melancholy Ann Darrow, a stage actress blessed with essential vaudevillian skills, yet possessing an uncommon taste for literature, particularly the insightful, allegorical tomes of author and playwright, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody). We sympathize with Ann since she has lost the support of her grandfatherly mentor who, after one too many failures on the Great White Way, has decided to return, disheartened, to hometown, Chicago, to test fate in yet another urban jungle. With this turn of events, Ann is forced to forage hand-to-mouth; it begins her descent into the ranks of the nameless underclass. Temptation approaches her in a Mephistophelian offer to sell her soul to venality, in a burlesque act, in exchange for material subsistence, which she rejects, knowing full well the alternative will forever taint her spirit. Ann's hell is unforgiving. So, too, is Kong's. His is the lost world of Skull Island, a foliated tropic in the uncharted high seas, inhabited by carnivorous, Jurassic-styled reptiles, monstrous arthropods and, as unlikely as it seems, Paleolithic mammals indigenous to the last ice age. They are the true masters of their ""Johnny-come-lately"" adversaries--Homo sapiens, represented by ritually obsessed Bushmen, and their less evolved, 20th Century cousins, self-absorbed actors, including the inimitable Bruce Baxter (Kyle Chandler). His film crew is ""misled"" by the impetuous Carl Denham (Jack Black), which has been navigated by ""take `em back alive"" gunrunners and poachers, commanded by the mercenary merchant marine, Captain Englehorn (Thomas Kretchmann), and mates. No question, Peter Jackson enjoys poking fun at himself and his industry.

Both venues bear witness to the irrepressible brutality of mortal life stewarded without solace--except for the saving grace of a self-enlightened Darrow (Watts) whose landing party on Skull Island spoils the impending sacrifice of a young bush girl to assuage the Great Kong. She finds herself the intended replacement and is fastidiously abducted by the tribe for this purpose. Before long, Kong catches-up with Ann, and so begins one of most unusual romances in film history, fraught with mistrust and fear before easing into mutual respect and platonic love. In a memorable scene, Ann shimmers in the dawning light like Venus, the morning star, staying Kong's killing hand just long enough for them to worship the beauty of a sunrise. The moment mesmerizes them as they perch atop a cliff in Kong's inhospitable backyard and watch the fiery globe, magnified on the horizon, kiss the illuminated Sea goodbye, for another day, as it gently lifts itself from the latter's swelling embrace. Unbeknownst to them, destiny will oblige them to witness this miracle again, in Ann's backyard, atop the less hospitable Empire State Building. Beauty and Beast will gaze wondrously eastward--this time, in the direction of Lady Liberty, the imperishable light of the new world.

Screenwriters Fran Walsh, Philipa Boyens, and Peter Jackson do not conceal the mythical allegory of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Just how close they came in having the ""Eighth Wonder of the World,"" brilliantly played by Andy Serkis, wrestle away Jimmy's (Jamie Bell) overdue copy of the author's celebrated novella and whack us upside the head with it is anyone's best guess. Weta's Argonauts beckon us to plumb the depths of Conrad's classic to draw deeper meaning from the poignant references to ""beauty and the beast"" that Merrion Cooper and Edgar Wallace cleverly dialoged for Fay Wray (Watt's uncanny, look-alike sister from another generation) and co-star Bruce Cabot (RKO Pictures, Inc., 1933; Turner and Warner Bros. Entertainment, 2006). With a little imagination, however, something of an 800--um--8000-pound Simian variant of Sophocles' Oedipus Rex, loosely smattered with critical themes and elements from Dante's ""Divine Comedy"" (1308-21), lurk beneath the surface--just don't tell the ape!

Ann Darrow's (Watts) unfaltering devotion hews the beast--and us. Once a tortured, hungering soul, she emerges from her descent into the abyss free and awakened, having overcome her mortal fears and personal demons. She has ""bared"" her soul to the sinister vagaries of a fickle existence in two jungles, tapping into a heretofore-unknown reservoir of courage to placate a lumbering beast. She amuses him with a smile, a dance, and a tear, and after an icy, nighttime romp through frigid Central Park, shows him the Way--a solitary, spiritual journey from the Circles of Hell to Paradise through Purgatory that is fraught with obstacles, temptations, and unimaginable punishments. None proved worse, however, than Kong's shameful abduction, with which she relates. Shackled against nature's will and voyeuristically exploited for others' entertainment, Kong is tormented by a faithless substitute for Beauty since Ann will have no part in this deception. Doom is the ultimate destiny for Man and Beast, but it is their only hope as well, just as the gods intended. Ann's journey, however, will detour along a dubious path, in an unlikely encounter with Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), always the object of her refined affection. Divine intervention worked through the most profane of men, Carl Denham (Black), ensnared Jack into Ann's existential journey. When others would have left her for dead in the woods or waters of Skull Island, Jack tenaciously searched for her. Eclipsed by Kong and shadowed in his wake until the Beast's catastrophic fall from grace, Jack never gave-up on Beauty, not as someone Ann Darrow could love. Like Dante's Beatrice, at whose request the philosopher, Virgil, interceded to guide their ascent into Paradise, Kong's attraction to the ""mourning"" star brought Ann to the pinnacle of her dreadful world and, in the darkest hour of her bereavement, Jack arrived in time to lift her to the stars.

7602374,5,B01AHWLX2O,"King Kong is Peter Jackson's epic, mega-budget, fanboy love letter to the film that inspired him to become a movie director in the first place. Clocking in at double the running time of the original, Jackson's film is an ambitious juggernaut of a movie that, like his The Lord of the Rings films, is epic in scale and scope and yet still has that personal touch. One of the common complaints leveled at the movie is its bloated running time and this new version is even longer but this is more than self-indulgence on Jackson's part. He spends more time developing his characters, their motivations and their relationships. Even the excessive and extensive dinosaur sequences in the second act are there for a reason.

Like the extended versions of the Lord of the Rings films, Kong is spread out over two discs with extras sprinkled over them and a third disc with an in-depth look at the making of this epic feature.

The first disc features an audio commentary by co-writer/director Peter Jackson and co-writer/producer Philippa Boyens. In a nice touch, Jackson makes it a point not to talk about any material covered in the various documentaries or in the production diaries. So, this track isn't bogged down with technical information but with more of an emphasis on how they tried to capture the spirit of the historical period, character motivation, references to the original Kong and filming anecdotes. This is a solid, chatty track packed with loads of information and told in an engaging way that really conveys how much of a labour of love it was for Jackson.

Also included are 16 deleted scenes that total 46 minutes. There are optional introductions to each scene by Jackson who puts them into the context of the movie and briefly explains why they were cut. Best of all, he explains that with this extended cut he didn't simply throw all of it back into the movie but made choices and explains them here.

""The Eighth Blunder of the World"" is an 18 minute blooper reel of the cast goofing around on the set and flubbing their lines (especially potty mouth Jack Black).

""The Missing Production Diary"" was not included on any previous DVDs and documents shoot day #59. The actors get to see footage that they just shot on video monitors so that they can adjust their performance. The cast begin to get ""addicted"" to watching themselves in this amusing extra.

""A Night in Vaudeville"" features uncut footage that they shot of the vaudeville performances including audition footage and archival film that they used as a basis.

""King Kong Homage"" juxtaposes scenes and lines from the original with their verbatim recreation in Jackson's film. We also see some of the exact references to the original and also inclusion of props from the film that came from Jackson's personal collection.

The second disc features ""Pre-Visualization Animatics"" for four scenes with optional music from the movie. This extra allows you to see scenes as they were originally conceived via computer animation.

""The Present"" is an amusing short film that the cast created for Jackson's birthday. It started off as a simple idea, a funny goof but, as Andy Serkis explains, it got more elaborate with an actual storyline as Jackson's present exchanges many hands on its way to him.

Also included are three trailers.

""Weta Collectibles"" takes us on a brief tour of the elaborate sculptures for the creatures that inhabit Skull Island and how some of them have since been transformed into finely crafted collectibles for fans.

The third disc features an in-depth look at the film entitled ""Recreating the Eighth Wonder, the Making of King Kong,"" an eight-part documentary that you can watch in its entirety or its individual segments. This doc goes on to take an in-depth look at the pre-production phase as various crew members explain how they came right off making the last Rings movies with virtually the same crew but not as much time to prepare. One highlight is Jackson and Naomi Watts' meeting with Fay Wray, which was an extremely emotional day for the director. He was deeply saddened by her death in 2004 as he had hoped to have her do a cameo in his film. Amazingly, there is little repetition from the production diaries in these expertly crafted featurettes.

Finally, there are the ""Conceptual Design Video Galleries,"" montages set to music of sketches, paintings and artwork from the 1996 attempt to make Kong, the Venture, Skull Island, New York City and Kong. It's interesting to see how close the film resembles a lot of the art, especially the Venture, Skull Island and New York City.",1164758400,8,4596,4.861892583120205
7602375,3,B01AHWLX2O,"This movie was the main reason I bought into the whole HD DVD thing.  As one of my favorites of 2005, I highly anticipated its release to HD, especially since I figured it would get one heck of a treatment.  I was right about part of it; the A/V quality is among the best I've seen, despite the lack of a Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.  It's definitely the title I'd use to show off what HD DVD can do; however, the lack of extras is a little disappointing, mainly because Amazon has it priced so darn high.  27 bucks is way too much for the title, when other new releases have sub-$20 price tags.

7602377,5,B01AHWLX2O,"My comments are in two categories, namely ""King Kong"" - the movie and secondly the HDDVD experience.

The storyline is excellent, I liked the added underlying story about Denham's reliance on his movie for final success or failure. The development of Kong's arrival at least an hour and a half into the movie was excellent, the tribal scenes were well done, the wrecking of the ship, and much much more. I saw this movie as a kid in the 70's, and now we have a very much updated version for our kids. So for the movie, I give it 5 stars *****

Now, onto the HDDVD, content. I thoroughly enjoyed the richness of the non-HD version, then when I saw it in HD, I was in awe, the graphics are even richer, my kids point out they can see flashes of light in places that were not there in the regular DVD, that Kong looks so much better, the landscape and overall beauty of this film shows its true colors in HD. So for the HDDVD I have no choice but to give it 5 stars as well *****

To the nay-sayers out there, please do check your setup, my HDDVD player is an XBOX based player, the XBOX then connects via. a composite RGB cable to an Onkyo A/V receiver(TX-SR674), the receiver then connects via. and HDMI cable to a Sony WEGA Rear Projection 1080i television.

7602378,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I believe this movie was the best movie of the year, a very close runner up was Batman Begins.

This movie was beautiful. I loved how the changed the story a little. Instead of a dingy screaming blonde that King Kong is chasing after, they made the blonde girl, Noami Watts, a smart, loving, caring woman who loved King Kong and was his best friend.

I also liked how they changed the blonde girls love interest from the actor, to a plain joe type. Great actors in this film. Jack Black was great. Noami Watts deserved some type of award for this part.

I loved the scene when King Kong finds Noami Watts in the city and he slides around on the ice as he holds her.",1164412800,3,665,4.2204724409448815
7602379,4,B01AHWLX2O,"After his great success with (and some might say, overexploitation of) ""The Lord Of The Rings,"" Peter Jackson turned his attention to yet another desired project - ""King Kong.""  It's obvious how much he loved it (one merely has to review some of the bonus material in the original's DVD rerelease to see that), and the source material HAS been improved in some cases, but one can see with both the theatrical cut and this ""extended"" edition, much bloat has been added, a la Lucas, in order to ""make a classic even better.""  Sometimes, though, improved scenery and realism in the effects, and adding more material, just plain gets in the way of what is, was, and always will remain, a simple story that succeeds BECAUSE it's simple.

For the most part, Jackson's ""King Kong"" is refreshing.  I love the original because it tried to tell an adventure story that mingles reality with fantasy.  Back in the day, this was a hard thing to do because it actually meant having to physically MAKE the effects happen.  Here, Jackson plays to his strengths because he, and the geniuses at WETA, show the exact same effort with a modern method - one can see how they slaved over the digital shots to make them fit into reality.  He did the same thing, to phenominal effect, in ""Lord of the Rings.""  He and the writers also know that today's audiences don't need for the script to be simplistic in order to keep us entertained.  If the story is well-told, we're willing to sit through character development and genuine emotion-building moments.  In showing us a sweet, platonic, and doomed connection between human woman and giant male ape, Jackson gives us a payoff the original only hinted at.

Yet when we see this over three-hour enterprise, I get the feeling that less truly would've been more.  The original clocked in at just over an hour.  The theatrical release came in at under three.  Even that felt a little heavy.  I can't really put my finger on what would've been better to cut (although I think we could've done less with the wonders of Skull Island), but I think we could've spent less time watching it as a whole and still gotten one Hell of a ride from this retelling.

All and all though, the Extended Cut IS interesting.  The wonders of digital film media is that, once you watch the whole movie, YOU can decide what to watch and not watch, thus shorten the film experience the way YOU want to.  It makes the whole thing worthwhile in the end.  And I'll be honest - I'd rather see the complete vision of the storytellers the first time around anyway.",1164412800,6,2557,4.592511013215859
7602380,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I thought King Kong was the best movie of 2005.  Part Raiders of the Lost Ark, Titanic, Jurassic Park and Bambi.  Not to mention the original landmark film.  I was one of those who bought it when it first came out and thus was mad when I saw they were coming out with another one with deleted scenes.  I would have saved my money and waited.  So the question I asked myself was do I want to spend the money and buy a movie I already have.  I read that there might be a scene where they show Kong actually in the boat being taken back to New York.  Something that confuses me to this day.  But, alas, it is not there.  Still there are added scenes with dinosaurs in the jungle and that is worth buying this new edition for.  Fortunatley, they didn't make the first part of the movie before they get to the island any longer.  That was long enough.  But, added jungle scenes with a triceratops and others are fun and you wish they had left them in the original movie.  If you do not have King Kong already buy this one.  If you have it and love it, like me, then you won't be sorry you bought this one too.

7602384,3,B01AHWLX2O,"Let me first say that I am a great fan of Jackson's LOTR trilogy. After that, I looked forward immensely to his King Kong remake. But on seeing the new Kong, I confess to some disappointment. The movie works well if you are not a 1933 KK fan and are uncritical in terms of the action sequences. To set it in the period of the original was a really good (and, I thought, brave) choice - but having done that, Jackson then chooses to follow the lines of the De Laurentis 1976 remake rather than the original. Unlike the original (and as in the 1976 version), the natives completely disappear after the first (scarily well done) encounter! Why? Gone are the later scenes of Kong attacking the native encampment, gone are the scenes of natives being stomped underfoot, gone are the scenes of heads bitten off. The 1976 approach is also followed in the relationship between Anne and Kong - in the original, Anne remains petrified of Kong (to great effect) throughout the whole movie (and, of course, she would be wouldn't she?); here (as in the '76 remake), there is a (much less effective) rapport between beauty and the beast.

In an interview on Australian TV, Jackson stated that he wanted to make Kong as ""real as possible"". Unfortunately, in places it is anything but! As an example, the famous log scene from the original is remade well to a degree, but in the original people fell to their deaths and stayed dead. The supposedly lost spider sequence is resurrected here but spoiled because it is difficult to believe that the survivors of the fall are not only alive (they must have fallen 30 - 40 metres!) but uninjured (here my suspension of disbelief - rather necessary for a movie of this nature - is shattered!). On top of this, I am expected to believe that a machine gun  can kill a creature attacking (and clinging to) a human without killing (or even scratching) the human - come on! (On a similar note, the dinosaur stampede is not only NOT as ""real as possible"", it's just plain silly.) OK, despite the above, I enjoyed the movie. And yes, I have the first release DVD. I note that there is now an extended edition (perhaps the natives will reappear - but I doubt it!). If it had a 96/24 DTS soundtrack (or even just a DTS surround soundtrack), I might even have bought it! As it is...",1163894400,12,2299,4.510791366906475

I think the extended version is even better in some areas and it runs quite a bit longer, but strangely it seems shorter! I have heard many complaints about this film being too unrealistic? The movie is about a giant gorilla! It is a fantasy film ""kids""! So when we see situations that don't seem possible, please keep this in mind.

The original King Kong is one of my favorite movies of all time, but I'm glad this film didn't follow the original note for note. Is it better than the original? Well...In some ways yes and in some ways no. The connection between Ann and Kong,  which a lot of people had problems with,  is welcome, as it makes the story much more interesting and heartfelt. I think Jackson should be commended for his efforts and this could very well be his crown jewel! Both the original and this remake deserve to be in everyone's movie collection!

The new extended edition is a worthy purchase as it has a lot of interesting added scenes that should have been in the theatrical release. There is also a ton of great new extras!

Although he rarely mentions other films in KONG history, Jackson has taken elements not only from the 1933 original, but also the DeLaurentiis remake, SON OF KONG, and even KING KONG ESCAPES to forge an epic film about a giant ape and the woman he loves. It's these later films that informs Jackson's take on the love story, as the human object of the gorilla's affections comes to love the monster as well. Of course this also brings the ""Beauty and the Beast"" theme full circle, and makes the film's ending even more tragic. Many uninformed critics have labelled this movie ""Jurrassic Kong,"" but clearly they are not familiar with the amout of dinosaurs that populate the original film.

Unlike the long versions of the LOtR's films, this is a true ""director's cut"" - if possible, Jackson would have made this movie six hours long!

Epic remake of 1933 classic is marred by Jackson & Co's typically inept writing, with centerless characters manipulated through contrived plot convolutions until the writers pull the plug on them. The film is now 90 minutes overlong, instead of a mere 60. Being a kid at heart, I welcome the extra dino-action, but expanded 'character' material adds nothing to the film, since the writers obviously never figured out who the characters really are or why they do any of the things they are made to do in the film.

Visual effects are uneven but above average throughout. Kong himself benefits from the extreme compression of a television screen, looking far more convincing than he did on the big screen. The film is also packed to the gills with references to the original Kong and the 1976 remake (which I recommend). Jackson placed props from the original movie in his own sets and restaged some of its most iconic gags; and the gunner who kills Kong is none other than Rick Baker, famed makeup artist who portrayed Kong in 1976!

Overall, for Peter Jackson fans or King Kong collectors, this is worth the price tag. For everyone else: stick to the 1933 original, which kids and adults still love!",1163721600,3,1521,4.7105263157894735
7602388,4,B01AHWLX2O,I loved the first King Kong movie in black & white.  But this movie was for me more enjoyable because of the special effects.  The dinosaur fights were excellent.  I loved the developement with King Kong as having a personality and the interaction between him and the girl.  She even uses her vaudville act on Kong and he pretends to not be ammused but she wins him over eventually.  Black is OK as the promoter of the adventure to find the mysterious island.  He is a bit of a ham and overacts at times but that is his nature.  He acts with the intensity of a Tom Cruise but just doesn't have quite Tom's magnetism.  I would have given the movie 5 stars but they could have cut short the human eating giant insect scene in the chasm.  The scene lasted over ten minutes (or seemed like it) and makes the movie out of reach of most children to enjoy. The old King Kong was accessable to all age groups something lost in this new one.  However I still loved this movie.,1163548800,2,967,4.263736263736264

7602390,4,B01AHWLX2O,"The biggest problem most people had with King Kong was its length, so there's no surprise that reaction by the general public to the release of an extended edition of another 3 hour-plus Peter Jackson film was almost the equivalent of a collective groan.

The surprise is that everything added to the Extended Edition of King Kong should have never been cut. More dinosaurs and more creatures and more action on Skull Island only improves the film, and one wonders if these scenes were cut mostly for time and pacing, why wasn't a little bit of the 51 minutes of pre-Skull Island snipped or perhaps a few overly drawn scenes of Kong and Anna gazing into each other's eyes?

The more noticable scenes are that of a rampaging Ceratops and a fun scene of an underwater monster attacking Adrien Brody and Co. while they are rafting down a river. A bit more character development with some seedy behavior by Carl Denham (Jack Black) and heroic deeds by Jack Driscoll and the shipmates add a bit of flavor to the male characters literally overshadowed by Kong in the film. The spider pit sequence is also a bit lengthened with some more lines by Jack Black. Overall, a worthy 13 minutes of added material, but the film still feels too long in the last act.

The special features to this extended edition are the special features that were missing from the first release of the Kong movie, including a commentary from Peter Jackson and extensive behind the scenes features, describing the making of Kong from concept artwork to the screen a la the performance of Andy Serkis.

I enjoyed the extended cut, but I don't know that this lengthy movie is better served with added material. It's not like the LOTR films where the additions enhance your viewing and understanding of Tolkien's world.

The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?

7602395,4,B01AHWLX2O,"The original King Kong is one of my all time favourites.  Its spirit of adventure, its complete capture of the Depression era, the fabulous effects of Willis O'Brien--I can watch it again and again.
As a result, I looked forward to Peter Jackson's remake with mixed feelings--there can only be one King.
I saw it in theatres twice, and own the DVD.  It is a film that is at turns wonderful and very frustrating.
Note: this review was written for the theatrical version.  Keep reading, and at the end of the review, I will mention the 'extended' edition.
The first third of the film is fine, despite the criticisms of some. As in the original, it is important to spend some time with the characters before dinosaurs eat them.  The scenes on Skull Island are often hyponotically intriguing, with excellent special effects.  And Kong's end fate on top of the Empire State building is masterful.
Yet the flaws in the film have me grit my teeth--for what could have been.
The original and remake versions form an unusual comparison between their eras, and how times have changed, not always for the better.
Where the original was an absolute model of economy, never wasting a second, Jackson feels the need to give us our 'money's worth'.  Instead of less than two hours (the original) his is three hours, seven minutes.  The original had a spider pit sequence which the makers deleted primarily because it slowed the film down from the main plot.  Jackson sticks it back in, and then some (yes, it was an act of love for the original, but misguided love, moving the film more towards horror than adventure, which is a critical error in judgement.)
Jackson's Kong is very much an animal of its times, as was the original.  The original knew when to stop, but we live in an age of excess and excessive violence.  The original left 'em wanting more, the remake gives 'em more than they want.
The natives on Skull island in the original were well dressed, relatively civilized, and violent only in kidnapping Anne Darrow (heck, Kong has to eat, right?? Plus, he is a God).  In Jackson's remake they verge on racist stereotypes of violent savages.  Was it really necessary for one crew member to suffer a violent death?  Did the natives have to be so brutal?  Where the original was suggestively violent, the remake is much more graphic.  Obviously Jackson feels we needed to be jolted for our entertainment.  Maybe he is right, and if he is, that is so sad.
Jackson is not racist in his depiction of the natives, although that was my first impression.  Heck, could the natives not have been white, for that matter?  But in the end he is simply feeding into and on modern cynicism.
The same problem exists with how he handled the Carl Denham character.  In the original he is considered a 'harmless' adventurer, just ""enthusiastic"".  In the remake he is a profoundly cynical man, and a real jerk.  We are told he has cinematic talent, but what we actually see is a manipulator with no apparent talent, no care for the lives of his cast and crew, even a liar--how many times does he say that he will dedicate the film to a dead crew member and give the money to the member's family?
For a while I thought the problem was Jack Black, the actor.  And, indeed, perhaps in the hands of a more skilled dramatic actor the character would have come off better (what would Al Pacino have done with the part?)  But the problem is not really Black.  It is inherent in the cynical way the character has been revised.  The original Denham was likeable.  The revised Denham is despicable.
And don't get me started on all the slow motion stuff that Jackson inserted.  Or the misreading of The Heart of Darkness.  Or the wasting of time on crew members who only get up eaten.  The script is often lazy, and seems to demonstrate that there was no one in Jackson's inner circle willing to say ""no"" to the Big Fella, any more than one could say no to the hairier Big Fella.  Other lazy elements of the script include how the lead actor in the film within a film is portrayed--either he's a hero or he ain't.
Yet, for all that, I have watched the film several times.  I paid to see it twice in the theatres.  I bought the DVD the day it came out.  I'll probably buy the extended version.  I have the production diaries.  And the film always stops me when I come across it on a cable channel.  It is beautifully shot, often gorgeous.  The special effects are indeed special--although the sense of awe that the original had is lost in the fast cutting of the original--Jackson can't slow himself down enough, often, to just let us look.  In some ways the original was better in inspiring awe, frankly, despite all the technical ability shown in the remake.
However, the remake is emotionally far more involving. What the original implied, the remake fully explores.  The scenes between Darrow and Kong are excellent, and for sure Kong is a much more expressive character.  In the original we empathised with him because of our own inner feelings, whereas in the remake Kong earns our sympathy much more directly.
The original Kong was more a monster, the remade Kong is much more a character.  The original was awe inspiring as an animal/man creature.  There was a reason why the original Kong did not look like a gorilla, why it stood erect and did not have a pot belly.  I like both, but they are wildly different.  That is good: this is NOT a pointless remake.
But the remake could easily have been cut by over half an hour, and it would be far better as a result.  Sometimes less is more.
Yet, again, this new Kong is so clearly a labour of love that it is hard to be critical of it.  Jackson loves Kong, and it shows, over and over.  For example, in the recently released on DVD version of the original Kong, Jackson recreates the spider pit sequence.  More power to him.  Except there was a reason that sequence was cut shortly after release: it slowed the pacing and introduced a horror element.  Jackson includes it in his version, extended it and making it even more horrific--and, in the end, demonstrating that the original film's producers were wise in cutting the sequence.

The extended edition?  Bought that too.  The film retains all the strengths and weaknesses of the theatrical version, adding a few new strengths and weaknesses.

There are two new dinosaur sequences.  The first has the crew members being attacked almost as soon as they enter the rest of the island.  It's an okay sequence, but to my mind the film worked better as it was, introducing the dinosaurs through our first seeing that herd of brontosuari (or brontosaurises, or whatever).  There was a sense of wonder in that edit, which is now lost when the dinos are introduced earlier.

The second sequence apes (can I write that, really?) the raft/dino sequence from the original.  The sequence worked in the original and it works in the extended cut.  It's very nicely done, especially the underwater stuff.

Those are most of the additions.  If there was five seconds of new Kong, that was about it.

Unbelievably, the spider pit sequence is extended.  Towards the end.  We now see the 'actor' character going down into the pit to rescue people--completely unnecessary build up to his character in what was already an unbelievably character twist (if he was scared enough to leave, would he have returned?)  However, Jack Black is given a few shots to look shaken by the experience, which was good.  In the end, though, the entire spider pit sequence remains out of place--it is horror, not adventure--and slows the film's pacing.

Too bad Jackson did not cut the stuff between the first mate and the younger crew member, which still has no decent payoff.

It is hard to recommend spending a lot more money on the extended version if you already have the theatrical cut.  And note: in the extended version the movie is now split between two disks.  That was a pain.

However, for some reason, the extended cut did LOOK better.  Not sure why. I have not been through all the extras, many of which are brought together here.  The Production Diaries appear to be here, for example.  Since I have a life, I haven't had the time yet to look at them all, but it is your money's worth.",1163203200,7,8235,4.597393689986283

7602401,3,B01AHWLX2O,"I'm not a fake critic here acting like the movie is below me, so I'll just make it quick and simple.

The Good: The CG Kong and T-Rex looked great. Various old scares and many other details, made them look believeable and they also maintained there size throughout the whole movie. Kong doesn't magically get bigger at any time. The scene in the park was pretty sweet and gave ya a warm feeling. The fact that a beautiful women falls for a average looking guy was nice to see for a change.

The Bad: Over the top super fake scenes which sadly is in most of the movie. Some poorly rendered CG animals and bugs. Three T-Rex chasing one blonde girl ever after chasing a larger meal, yeah okay. The stampeding scene with the dinos, okie dokie. The fact that people where so easily manipulated by Jack Black. The fact that Jack's character as annoying and adnoxious as he was and the jerk never dies.

Conclusion: It was an okay movie. Not as great as people made it seem like it was. I think they should have toned it down. Ihe over the top scenes were just plain rediculous.",1162684800,5,1071,4.371859296482412

Lord of the Rings was truly exceptional.  This film is a parody at best. To recap: little characterization (at least that made sense), no depth, unbelievable motives (again, girl *loves* ape?

7602403,1,B01AHWLX2O,"OK, its only 3+ hours and maybe the opening credit sequence, recreating a depression era New York, is redeeming, but still this is by far one of the worst movie experiences I've had in a long time. I'm not liking the stylized, digitally rendered world of modern movies, and this is the epitomy of digital moviemaking.

Where to start? Why watch this movie?

Do you like digital monkeys fighting several digital dinosaurs for fifteen minutes at a time? To lighten things up, every now and then for emotional gravitas, a shot of a passionately concerned Naomi Watts who is in love with a large, killer monkey makes for a good laugh. This monster is killing people, you two don't make a good couple, enough with the theatrics. In the original, the woman is terrified, and she should be. At this point I'm dumbfounded by the movie. A fat Jack Black is jogging under a dino's belly while carrying a large, depression era movie camera. No, I'm not exaggerating or lying. Him and several other people are running under the belly of a dino. If it wasn't ridiculous enough, it looks like a videogame. No realism in the look or the actions of the people. And to make it worse; some sort of strange made-for-tv blur effect, that is completely out of place with the production style and is used at some of the strangest times.

To be honest, somewhere in the middle of the island scenes I went out for a breath of fresh air and to listen to some music in my car. I missed how they catched the large monkey and how they managed to drag it to NY.

Oooops, I almost forgot to mention the most inane set of throwaway characters in film history; The Men of the Boat! If the entire boat sank midway into the film, not a single amount of concern would be registered by the filmgoers. But the ultimate throwaway character is The Boy Who Can't Read. He is reading ""The Heart of Darkness"". What is great about this - is when bad acting young boy asks shipmate about book, it provides metaphors for Jack Black's obsessed character, which is actually providing metaphors for monster ego director Peter Jackson. This was done so clumsily I laughed out loud several times, ""Why does he keep going up the river?..."" now I'm getting looks from the audience; nobody gets my humor!

Even Andy Serkis, he of Golumn fame, gets in on the act. From voicing/acting Golumn to this throwaway character, what next, spokesman for Wal-Mart? Oh, the end? The monkey and annoying wanna-be actress get married and have three darling little apes, who grow up to run the family business. But really, you want big sweeping shots? Great, can't stand a screen-full of CGI? Tough, you're going to get big old sweeping CGI scenes. No dust, grain, or any sense of reality - you're watching a rendered scene for you to respond with rendered emotions. Digital shots of digital monkey. Cut to; Naomi Watts in horror as her 1,000 pound digital lover kills left and right. Its all so touching.

In closing;

* Nice Depression Era Intro

* Throwaway characters

* Jack Black miscast

* Overdramatic Naomi Watts (enough with trying over and over to create sympathy for Kong!)

* Strange blur effect and editing choices

* Scenes on the island over the top to the point of being ridiculous. Hanging from the mouth of a raptor during a fight taking place hanging from vines??? Huh! Then the running of the dinos and it only gets worse from there.

* The rescue of Naomi from Kong and the capture of Kong both ridiculous. The hero climing up a cliff-face and later him jumping off said cliff with her, etc. Apparently being a screenwriter give one superhumans powers.

* The whole over the top, sweeping digital ending.

I'm in my 30's - I'm the only one in my group of friends who braved this movie. Never heard much about it - Kong seemed to disappear from the map quickly and deservedly.

7602404,4,B01AHWLX2O,"This is a very good movie. But let me warn you, don't watch it on a day where you made plans to go shopping, see a friend... or a doctor, dentist and so on. it is a very long but a very fun movie to watch. Since it's three hours long you come to wonder is it drawn out? And the answer to that is... yes it is. Im not going to spoil it for any body who hasn't seen the original or any of the remakes including this one, but will say that the hugging scene at the end between Adrian Brody and Naomi Watts is like 10 miniutes long. And the scenes when kong is fighting the t-rex, although cenematic and entertaining, are around 30 miniutes long. The movie also features some very impossible things, aside from the obvious (cough, giant ape, jack black trying to act dramatic). Like the scene where kong first takes Ann. Kong is running through the forest at top speed swinging ann in is arm as if he were trying to give her whiplash, and that of course is what any human being would get. A very old car being flipped and tossed up to fifty feet in the air and falling back down to earth becomeing totaled and three feet shorter than it was before the incident and the passenger walks out with no broken bones but only a mere stratch or two. Dispite this it was a pretty good movie. I would reccommend this but would rather watch the lord of the rings myself. The cgi was brilliant, as the acting was to.

7602405,2,B01AHWLX2O,"After seeing this movie (and while seeing this movie), the one thought that kept coming to mind was:

""If every scene had been chopped by 2/3 it would have been a pretty good movie.""

The best example of this would have to be the Kong vs T-Rex trifecta.  Disregarding how all the animals in question managed to come out of each individual attack unscathed until the final death came (no broken bones, no cuts, etc) and disregarding how Kong manages not to hurt or kill the female lead while protecting her (I know _I_ always grip a bit too hard when trying to grab something that's falling) and how she managed to come out uninjured with everything going on around her... the scene was just too long and repetitive.  The final Empire State building scene took too long also, especially the final 'slide off the building'.

I've seen a repeated claim of disbelief that some people found the movie boring.  Yep, there's enough action for three movies.  I won't deny that.  But action for the sake of action, with no suspense, is boring to me.  Suspense for me requires a couple of things: realism within the film, and emotional connection (good or bad) to the characters.

 The first part, realism within the film, is often referred to as suspension of disbelief.  Now, some people keep saying ""King Kong is a FANTASY movie"" and believe that that suffices.  They might say that the scenes in Star Wars are far more unbelievable, especially people jumping from catwalk to catwalk, sometimes with great elevation changes, yadda... But Star Wars IS a fantasy movie, and it has an explanation WITHIN THE FILM, 'the Force' and the fact that the characters in these amazing light saber duels are trained in it, allowing them to defy gravity, block shots from laser pistols, etc.  Yes, the Force doesn't exist in our world, but if you accept that it does in Star Wars, the movies are relatively consistent with this premise.

 So what do we have in King Kong, which other than a giant Ape, seems to be based in the 'real world'.  Overweight cameramen carrying a heavy piece of equipment, running underneath of dinosaurs, avoiding dinosaurs, rocks, etc, all tumbling past him, for 10-15 minutes.  Oh yeah, and a heap of other ordinary folks all doing the same.  We have a beast that can be killed by bullets (albeit LOTS of them from planes), completely unaffected by a T-Rex's jaws clamped on his arm, something that should have at least severed some nerves and certainly should have had the arm bloody.  We have a beast apparently able to keep his attention on three dinosaurs and the absolute best place to hold the blonde to keep her from being injured, never mind that any one of umpteen gyrations he makes should probably have snapped her neck.  I'm sorry, but completely inconsistent action (in this case inconsistent with a relatively close to 'real world' - as far as we're told, there's no 'Force' to allow all of  the absurdities that occur) for the sake of action is just... boring.

There WERE moments that made me remember this was the same director that created such a visual masterpiece in Lord of the Rings, such as the first imagery of Kong after his capture having exactly the right impact: the unthinking masses thinking he looked so amazing while the viewer is struck by how pathetic he looks compared to when he was free.

I think the true problem is, Peter Jackson is perfectly suited to creating epic films and perhaps is unable to _not_ film every scene as if it's a potentially world shattering moment.  Lord of the Rings was an epic story, and as such benefited from this kind of attention.  King Kong is not an epic story, and as such, for me at least, simply didn't work when Jackson tried to turn it into one.

(And heading off any comments about my attention span, I love slower paced movies, like ""Unbreakable"", ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Contact"".)",1162252800,9,3866,4.672082717872969

I hated the dinosaurs and the giant insect sequences that didn't seem to ever end.  The bizarre love triangle between girl-big gorilla-boy was toned down quite a bit from the 77 version, but still felt out of place.  However, my biggest gripe of this movie is why did it need to be three hours.  I did not see anything in this version that wasn't in the original or the remake in 77 that suggested it should last three hours.  I understand that there is an extended version, of what, Naomi Watts trimming her toenails, or Jack Black throwing back a couple at the local bar.  Maybe Peter Jackson, fresh from finishing the superb Lord Of the Rings trilogy, can't make a movie anymore that comes in under three hours.

- first: it's was a contract with a studio and he make a movie for the studio ( verry calibrate ) and for the audience.

- second: it's for him because he has the power and the finance...and he make a movie for him, for his pleasure not for the public.

In every case, a movie is never made for the demand of the public.

For many years, Peter Jackson dream about to make this movie, it's was his vision and he was not interested about ""what think and what hope the public"".",1161129600,,670,4.123076923076923
7602411,5,B01AHWLX2O,"This movie defies all known laws of biology and human species but is still a great fun to watch. I don't think any Ape could ever fall in love with a human being and we all know that dinosaurs eat plants. Yet in this flick they struggle to get their hands on Naomi Watts and eat her. I think the original title for this film was to be King Kong vs T-Rex. The plot develops kind of slow in the beginning, but the second half of the film is just breathtaking till the last scene. Very interesting.",1160870400,,495,4.11340206185567
7602412,2,B01AHWLX2O,"Well, I guess this is what happens when you have three big wins (Lord of the Rings) in your corner.  You are given a free pass from the studio to go wild. And Jackson did.  There are so many side-stories and silly stories in the new Kong that you have to pinch yourself and remember there was a great original one way back in 1933.  And that movie had the good sense to know it was a B movie, and that 90 minutes is what you should clock in at. But I guess Jackson won't do anything less than 3 hours these days, no matter how over stuffed the end product becomes. Still, there are some wonderful scenes in this movie. Jackson is a master with CGI (which is why I'm giving this 2 stars), and the monkey is incredible, as are the bugs and other monsters. (But even that talent will have you wondering if some of the shots are outtakes from the Rings movies. The famous Skull Island wall looks like some sort of nuked rejection from Mordor.)

Excepting Black, the cast is fine.  But as in any movie, a cast is only as good as its script.  And Jackson's attempt to inject importance is laughable.  Having characters discussing Conrad's Heart of Darkness does not ratchet things up a bit. It just looks pretentious. And I actually felt bad for Watts (a fine actress) at the end, with her making lovey dove eyes at Kong as they skated across the ice. It was like Jackson went out for a smoke and Ron Howard stepped in to film that incredibly bad and syrupy scene. In fact, the  whole relationship between the monkey and Watts was so overplayed (in the original Fay Wray never stopped screaming, she never chased after Kong, as Watts does, in any way) that it undercut the movie's final line: It was beauty that killed the beast.  No, it was the director.",1160870400,8,1749,4.340490797546012

I had a hard time accepting him in this role.  Bugs were great, tribe was great, boat was great.  See, the pieces of the puzzle were all really nice pieces but somehow they didn't fit together.  Since I thought the movie was already about 30 minutes too long, I can't believe they're putting out an extended version.  Why?  So we can see more of a love interest between beauty and the beast?  Too much of a chase scene through New York.

I believe what worked in the LOTR trilogy didn't work as well here.  Still love Peter but, like everyone else in the known world, would love to see him take on the Hobbit.",1160697600,4,760,4.420289855072464

I have to admit though the scenery was great, and I did like it when they fought the big bugs.

7602415,5,B01AHWLX2O,"The classic gigantic-ape-in-mistery-island story comes again to life under the magnificent direction of Peter Jackson, who utterly proves himself as one of the most important filmmakers in history, by delivering a visually stunning as well as dramatically engaging movie.

Despite the perils of a very worn-out story line, the movie ends up as a masterpiece of modern cinematics and it is undoubtedly due to a solid and well-written script framed within a clear director's vision and accompanied by a great cast of actors.

Skillfully, Jackson manages to avoid the temptation of just filling up the screen with flamboyant mega digital effects and ultimately finds the adequate balance between state of the art computer graphics (which are simply amazing here) and the need of giving a sense of reality onscreen (even within the fantasy of the plot). As a result, King Kong won't leave audiences with the feeling of having watched a 3-hour long video game in the movie theater. Instead you'll enjoy three hours or so of truly great cinema.",1159401600,9,1038,5.1

This is the most ridiculous, drawn-out schlock I have seen in a very long time. It is so incredibly trite and exaggerated that I couldn't help but roll my eyes and laugh out loud that valuable resources were wasted to make this. The movie is as gripping as watching someone fly-fish! Had I had the misfortune of watching this in a theater, I would have walked out.

I give Jackson credit for his work on Lord of the Rings but after this, I can only hope that he is not allowed to ever make another movie again.

Peter Jackson's direction is fabulous, yes it could have been trimmed a little, BUT I didn't mind that much.

One of the things I love about this movie is the epicness, absoulute vastness of it all.  You travel through New York, the jungles, and rivers, of Skull Island.  King Kong is a great big adventure movie and I believe there are far too few movies that can capture your imagination and make your eyes tear up, or make you gasp in awe at the shots.

It is, at once, both a ridiculous scene and a touching one, a humanizing of the movie's greatest monster that's as homey as Andy Griffith casting a parental gaze over Mayberry while patting Opie on the head.

What is missing in Kong's frantic confrontation with man on the streets of New York City, and what made the original 1933 film so horrific, is the panicked animal quality revealed in the eyes of the original Kong, as he searched high and low on the streets of the big city for anything resembling a jungle vine. He was the pet monkey gone violently berserk in a worst case scenario. Here, he's barely more frightening than the average New Yorker late for the subway.

So we have a kinder, gentler Kong. The scares are reserved for the striking island scenes during the first half, that serve as a techno-wonder salutation to the fine work of the original film, and arrive, thankfully, after the melodramatic trite, cliched characters, and stale performances of the film's first 40 minutes.

But I enjoyed the film as an entertaining tongue-in-cheek homage to early Hollywood and the original monster. The special effects and cinema work are a feast for the eyes. What this docile magilla-gorilla needs is a bad case of rabies.",1158278400,,1525,4.768939393939394

7602423,3,B01AHWLX2O,"It seems to me that the remakes today are far too serious and dark. This is the case with King Kong remake In the beginning,

Carl Denam is a tongue in cheek film maker starts out the film with humor, a sheister who is very ambitious. He is one step ahead of prison, but has visions of success, and is very driven by his ambitions. This leads to a remarkable trip to an unknown island in the Pacific where  a horrible tribe and a horrible large monster gorilla live. After a tremendous fight with the horrible local villagers the film maker's boat crew manage to capture King Kong and take him back to New York where the film maker will be hailed as a hero. Only one problem: Kong escapes, and raises mayhem in New York, stealing the heroine while climbing the Empire State building and swatting off airplanes. The end is sad and the whole movie never rises much beyond its serious dark nature.

Everything is WAY TOO BIG and grand, like your typical 21st century epic, with grand special effects and big, large scenes.  As I said earlier, the film has much too dark a personality and is much too serious. And it's waaaaaaaaay too long. Naomi Watts is beautiful and athletic, and is more adept in action than acting. The scenes of 1930's New York are excellent, the film maker does a good job on capturing that bygone era.

There are times, when watching some of the scenes, that the picture looks more like an Xbox game than an actual scene, the computer generated backgrounds to my eye need to come along a bit more to look more realistic.

This is a good movie to watch now that it's hit the bargain rack. Well made, with good acting, I just believe the whole thing could have used a bit more schtick and slapstick humor. It took itself far too serious.",1157155200,3,1756,4.421052631578948

7602425,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Unlike James Cameroon who has literally disappeard into some abyss (actually he's been making documentaries of the doomed ship and such) after his 12-Oscar winning Titanic, Peter Jackson went straight to the sets to create his next epic after his 12-oscar winning The Lord of the Rings 3 - Return of the King. And what a creation King Kong has been.

Two things that the 1967 version is popular for and that which weren't carried over to this version are: 1. Scantily clad heroine in revealing shots, 2. King Kong indulging in shady acts with the heroine. Peter Jackson did good by not carrying over such spoilers into his version.

The special effects are amazing. It is going to be a very difficult task of creating a better Kong than this one for sometime. Kong's fight with the T-Rexes is one thing worth watching countless times. Other oscars are also truly deserving for sound editing and sound effects.

One situation that was too difficult to accept was the run of the Brachiosauruses with the crew dodging the animals while running along with them. Chances are that none of the crew could have survived such a stampede while simultaneously being attacked by other predators. The extended shooting scenes of Kong from the aircraft in the concluding scences of the movie could have also been avoided.

7602427,4,B01AHWLX2O,"This adapted version of the well known towering classic, a pyramidal cult movie of 1933 directed by Merian Cooper, received a distinguished and honest homage by Peter Jackson.

Jackson not only produced mesmerizing special effects along the road, but most important still, focuses about the myth and explores through a very zealous dissection, in several levels. The greed, embodied in Carl Dehman - who really beliefs he may exorcize his inner demons under the service of the great audiences by just only $ 0.25 - the force of love, so many times represented in previous stories such as The beauty and the beast, or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, the telluric presence of a wasteland where the triviality and the unlimited hunger of fame will make Kong - The Eighth wonder of the world - and bring it back to our civilized world in order to be admired for the excited crowd, in search of new and challenging emotions.

Anne Darrow , the beauty per excellence, knows better than anyone, what's going on behind the apparent aggressiveness of this huge beast, that committed the unforgettable mistake to fall in love with a being of other genre.

Two little details tinged this movie: Anne at the moment she gets out, after Kong has escaped from the Hall is the only person in NYC who did not need any coat in the middle of a cold night (the love is hot but not enough to have forgotten this detail), on the other hand when Kong and Anne dance on the lake of ice in Central Park, the edition process was visibly rough, cutting abruptly the most original sequence of the movie.

When I saw the movie I couldn't believe how disappointing it was.  This movie is the perfect example of how great effects do not make great movies.  EVERYTHING was overdone.  Jack Black isn't my favorite actor, but he was really over the top in this film.  Talk about overacting!  Geesh!  That sort of melodramatic, pompous acting may work in movies like The School of Rock, but it just made him look like a bad actor in this movie.  Secondly, nearly every scene was too long.  It took a full hour just for the cast to get to Skull Island.  Come on!  An hour!  Most of the movie, we are focused on Jack Black's character and not on Kong or the girl.  There was also a throw-in, unrelated relationship between two characters on the boat crew that served absolutely no purpose in the movie, other than to add filler and time.  There were too many excessively long shots with huge insects, dinosaurs and the like that didn't move the story forward in any way.  Don't get me wrong, it was exciting, but only for the first few minutes of the scene.  But the scenes just dragged on and on.  Just when you thought they must be done, here comes another scene with monstrous bugs or dinosaurs.  The sequence where Kong protects Ann from the T-rex was beefed up to include 3 T-rexes and lasted over 20 minutes.  Even the island natives were so feral and overdone that they were entirely unbelievable (and an insult to genuine indigenous peoples all over the globe).  It was completely over the top.  I did enjoy the sequences with Kong and Ann (minus most of the T-rex attack), and New York at the end was OK.  But overall I felt that I lost 3 hours of my life that I will never get back.  I'm really glad that I borrowed this one from the library and didn't have to spend any money to see it.  I wouldn't bother to see it again and will never recommend it to anyone.

7602431,2,B01AHWLX2O,"The sad thing about this movie is that it was full of wasted potential.  It started out with an intersting lead, and made you want to get to know more about the story, as well as the characters.  Then, we got to the bloody jungle and it all went downhill from there.

Major plotlines were suddendly dropped.  For instance, what happeneded to the love brewing between Adam Brody and Naiomi Watts?  There chemistry suddenly fell flat. Plus this is a movie which shows how important an editor's job is to the overall movie process.  There is no reason in the world that this movie had to be 3+ hrs long.  None.  Nada.  Zip.  Zero.  I felt every hour of this movie-3 hrs which i will never get back.  And the sad thing was that even I could see places where things could have been cut!  Like for instance, did Kong have to battle, not 1, not 2, but 3 monsters?  One really intense brawl with one of those disgusting creatures would have been great for me.

By the end, you cared neither about the story, or the characters.  It's funny, when one would think that the more time spent with a character, the better you get to know them, but after the 3 hrs the only character I truly cared about was the giant monkey, and he went and died at the end, which pretty much sums up what the movie did as well.

However, the special effects-if you're into that sort of thing- were AMAZING.  Brilliantly done, it felt as if you were truly there.  However, special effects can't rescue a movie.  The settings were also lovely, and the costumes relating to the time period was gorgeous.

7602433,3,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson needs to be careful, because he could easily be pigeon-holed into the lengthy, dramatic, overly ambitous director role.  Believe you me, it paid off in spades with the Lord of the Rings movies.  But when taking on a story that's only half as big as Kong himself, the pattern needs to be altered.

I'm not saying Jackson's remake-of-a-remake ""King Kong"" is a bad movie, because I honestly don't think it is.  But when the movie came out, it was hailed as an instant classic, the best movie of the year, and possibly the best movie of the 2000's.  That's simply not true either.  It's been quite a long while since the movie came out, has hit the small screen, the anticipation hype has cleared, so we can now take a step back and view the film with a little more objectivity.

The movie is basically divided into three parts, neatly compartmentalized by it's three hours.  (Jackson works in three's, remember).  The first hour is an absolute bore.  In the theater, I had trouble understanding the superfluous character developement, but now that it's out on DVD it seems downright unnecessary.  I think I may know where it stems from, though.  When Jackson took on Tolkein's books, the character developement was needed; these were hobbits, dwarfs, elves, AND humans in a fictional world trying to dispose of a powerful, magical ring in the terrifying, evil Mordor.  ""Kong"" is a struggling director, actress, and filmwriter who get on a boat.  ""Make mention of it and move on,"" should have been the rule of the day.  Instead, Jackson draws out absolutely everything.  Most painful of all is how almost nothing happens in that hour.  Yes, it needs to be shown that Ann and Jack start to dig each other, but that shouldn't take an hour.

The second hour is the crowning achievement.  We arrive at Skull Island, meet the savage natives, Ann is offered up to an 80 foot tall gorilla, and the crew go in after her.  Still, barring how fantastically realistic Kong looks, nothing much is new or different from the two versions of King Kong available.  But as the crew goes further into ""the last blank spot on the map,"" it becomes apparent WHY Jackson chose to do the film in the first place.  Brontosaurases, Raptors, T-Rexes, and Bugs to boot abound in the fantastic island all so detailed that it harrows up rememberance of Jackson's greatness showcased in the greatest Trilogy of all-time.  That flame of interest and amazement is quickly stomped out after Jack ""rescues"" Ann and the beast is cholorformed and brought back to New York.

The fundamental dichotomy between a fantasy island and 1930's New York City is a lot of what kills the fun of the movie.  I understand that NYC has to be realistic and it is.  But Jackson excels when he shows his audience a world that doesn't exist.  Kong escapes from the stage, runs amock, and finally finds Ann.  From here on out, it's everything you think of when someone metions the words ""King Kong,"" and there's a reason.  It's been done before.  He climbs a building, is shot at, and falls to save Ann.  Obviously, the purpose is to show humanities savage side, but as Kong is crushing cars, destroying buildings, and killing hundreds of people, the viewer wonders what else could humans do with an unstoppable, building-tall animal that kills his friends.

The movie is good.  But not Lord of the Rings good.  I understand that it's apples and oranges, but it had the POTENTIAL to be a great movie.  But as the minute marker runs past three hours, one wonders how much of the first and last hour could have been condensed.

Overall:  6 out of 10.",1155081600,5,3603,4.670906200317965
7602434,4,B01AHWLX2O,"The storyline is familiar: A renegade film maker lands aground on a primitive island filled with beasts and tribal savages, takes a huge ape captive with the idea of having him in a live dramatic production, except that the production goes awry when the ape escapes and terrorizes New York.

The best part of this second effort at remaking the classic 1933 film is not the astounding special effects, nor is it the mayhem of Kong fighting dinosaurs and enemy aircraft. It is the poignant connection between the beauty and the beast. This is captured better than in any of the other renditions of the story.

The only quibble I have with this film is the three hour running time. The story would have been more effective and more powerful if it was tighter and more compact. But Peter Jackson is determined to overwhelm us with technology and special effects wizardry. The technology is the biggest monster in the movie.

I should also say that I was worried that I would be wasting three hours of my life being bored because I was watching something where I knew how it was going to end. But the interplay between the beauty and the beast had me hooked, and this made the film surprisingly less anticlimactic.

Jack Black does a good job playing the smarmy, sneaky, capitalizing film director. And Naomi Watts is stunning as Anne Darrow. It is a much better version of King Kong than the 1976 remake, though not as compact and powerful as the original.",1154995200,,1452,4.638132295719845
7602435,4,B01AHWLX2O,"Finally, I saw King Kong after hearing so much about it and it was good.  It wasn't great, like Lord of the Rings obviously, but it definitely kept my attention throughout the 3 plus hours.  The special effects were magnificent, especially in the scenes where the dinosaurs were tripping all over each other and the scenes with the locals of Skull Island.  I thought Kong looked great and there was great emotion surrounding him.  Although one reviewer suggests that this movie was miscast, I strongly DISagree.  I thought Jack Black was perfect as a mixture of sleeze and charm, and played the part very well.  Naomi Watts, who has never looked prettier also did a great job with her connect with Kong.  Lastly, Adrien Brody, who is great in every movie I have seen with him, does the best job in this movie.

However, this movie is not perfect, and it has some parts that hurt it.  First, the slow motion sequences in this movie were a bit too much.  It worked well in LOTR, and it would have worked in some scenes, but it was overdone and unneccesary in parts.  Also, the juggling scene with Naomi Watts looked extremely fake, but in the end WHO CARES, since the effects that really mattered were great.  I thought some parts seemed to drag as it took almost an hour to see Kong, but once we did, it is action all the way.  At the same time, it was like an older movie where it builds and builds to something great.  I thought Colin Hanks was annoying as usual and I wonder why he is in so many things with Jack Black.

Although my wife felt more emotion towards Kong than I did (ie. I didn't cry!), I did feel like Jackson did as good of a job as he could creating that connect.  I won't be rushing to watch this movie again soon, but it is a movie that should be watched.  My biggest problem was the language...although it didn't have a lot in total, it has a lot of GD's and saying Jesus Christ (or some variation), which annoys me very much to hear.  If I would have known, I would have waited until it came on TV, so it is edited.",1154908800,,2038,4.290575916230367
7602436,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I remember seeing King Kong as a teenager in the 80s and I was quite impressed by the story, but don't remember having any strong feelings for the mighty Kong. Watching this modern version helps you appreciate the work of animal rights activists- this beast has a soul! Naomi Watts does an amazing job I think getting across a believable performance that she actually cares for this giant beast despite having no spoken dialogue with Kong. Jack Black is also well cast as the funny, but ambitious adventurer that you love and hate at the same time.

Brilliant depiction of the other beasts on skull island including the super scary locals, some of the most scary scenes in the film without a doubt. I don't think I will allow my kids to watch this one for a while, but I think there are good lessons there for teenagers and older to see and learn from.

I think the people of the world could do with a more daunting feeling about nature and animals- we have controlled and killed most beasts on the planet, dangerous or not- it is a shame there aren't giant killer animals to intimidate us and put us in our place, it might make people respect nature and the environment more. I would prefer to be scared of giant beasts over global warming, terrorist attacks and war anyday.",1154822400,,1275,4.515151515151516
7602437,4,B01AHWLX2O,"One of our neighbors loaned my husband his copy. I didn't want to see it for two reasons. The biggest was it's too long. In my opinion, no movie should be over 3 hours long. The other is I've watched both the 1933 original version and the 1976 one with Jessica Lange.

I walked in when the woman was being offered to Kong by the natives. That's where it gets interesting so I sat and watched the rest. I don't feel I really missed anything. And I have to admit that it was pretty darn good. The time went fast with all the magnificent special effects. And even if I thought the plot of Kong and Ann Darrow (played this time by Naomi Watts) silly, it did manage to be touching at times. Well, at least I felt for the big beast.

I think anyone can enjoy this movie once. It's a good popcorn movie.",1154736000,,796,4.129032258064516

One thing to note from this release - there is no DTS soundtrack on this release, which has disappointed and even angered a lot of fans.... Benchmarking from the Lord of the Rings extented dvd releases, this is an ommission that trully expected... Be mindful.... Never the less, this is a strong release, from a director who understands what a dvd presentation should be. Place this 1 on your christmas wishlist!

7602439,2,B01AHWLX2O,"I despise ""reviews"" by people that enjoy their own writing, and go out of their way to write SPOILERS and High School Book Reports about movies, so I won't be doing that.  I'll just describe to you what I felt without giving too much away.

I loved most of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and this made me a Peter Jackson fan, though I'd seen some of his previous work and didn't know it at the time.  This movie was totally miscast, practically from top to bottom.  Jack Black should be on his knees in front of his agent 24/7 for landing him this role, and though he's a relatively talented comedic um... actor(?)(translation = routine, nothing special) I really felt that his inability to act his way out of his single facial expression killed this movie entirely.  For those of you who have seen the film, or will see it, just imagine his only thought being ""Uh-oh, I think I just crapped in my pants"" whenever you lay eyes upon his face during the film.  You'll see what I mean.  Naomi Watts was tedious to watch after a while, as the direction was just bad.  I think that Jackson told her to just wing it, and kept filming, as some scenes between the ""Beauty and the Beast"" are obviously improvised, drag on literally forever, and some are purely moronic (see ""juggling scene"" on the mountain.)  Oddly enough, there was barely any dialogue in the film once the characters hit Skull Island, so I found myself sitting through Jackson ""Signature"" endlessly, needlessly loooong scenes of panning, swooping, tilting, as well as a VERY odd addition of slow-motion scenes that were used as a gimmick in an attempt to breathe something ""supernatural"" and LORD OF THE RINGS-like into this horrible film.  It was nice however, to see a big Gorilla portrayed as an actual GORILLA, which was very refreshing and fun to watch for the most part.  Yeah, the special effects were nice, so kudos to his team, but even they couldn't carry this bomb for me. (Oh, and the FX duplicating Ye Olde NYC looked so horribly fake that I was shocked.  Those guys should stick with fantasy & monsters & talking trees.) Adrien Brody wasted his talent in this junk, as well as the Liam-Neeson-Lite actor that played the ship captain.  See the film anyway, just to say you did.  The ending was actually worth the wait though, to watch Jack Black ruin the famous tag-line.",1154476800,3,2344,4.576555023923445
7602440,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson is the best big screen, damn-the-budget, let's-make-an-epic filmmaker working today.  ""King Kong"" is a perfect choice for Jackson and his talented crew of actors and behind-the-scenes magicians, particularly his special effects wizards at the Weta Workshop.

""King Kong"" presents Jackson with the exact opposite problem that he took on in ""The Lord of the Rings"" - namely, the amount of story.  With ""The Lord of the Rings,"" Jackson and his team had to take a mammoth, unfilmable narrative (in its novel form) and tease three films from it.  To say they succeeded is an understatement.

""King Kong,"" on the other hand, has barely ninety minutes of ""story.""  So how does Jackson get a three-hour movie out of it?  By recreating a stylized yet realistic New York City circa 1933 and creating from scratch the vicious cauldron of monsters called ""Skull Island,"" home of Kong.  There is not one shot in this movie that is less than dazzling, whether it's a close-up of Naomi Watts' eyes or the spectacle of Kong tossing aside cars and trains or battling dinosaurs.

Jackson has made a violent movie, so you should be wary before bringing the little kiddies.  As one gruesome example, Andy Serkis (as the crewman Lumpy) gets eaten by monstrous slugs . . . head-first.  This is shoddy treatment of Serkis by Jackson, as Serkis, who played Gollum/Smeagol in ""The Lord of the Rings,"" also ""plays"" Kong and must have spent hundreds of hours hopping around in a motion-capture suit.

I won't bother recapping the story, which you have to know.  Suffice it to say that if you are looking for a ""big entertainment movie,"" you can't do any better than ""King Kong.""  This is the movie we invented popcorn for.",1154304000,3,1709,4.828178694158075
7602441,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Fabulous awesome.. and a great  respect for the amazing amount of work produced at all levels with blowing cgi.

This was a BIG let down to me pertaining to the ""Lord"" of the Ring trilogy, Peter Jackson.  He really was magnificent in those movies... and gee, they didn't use bad language.

The original B&W King Kong movie is still the best.  It's too bad, too.  At least the special effects were superb in this new one.",1153699200,6,526,4.3061224489795915
7602443,5,B01AHWLX2O,"The 1933 version of King Kong, which is the original, is perhaps the first film to rightfully be labeled a 'classic.' It was unique in its day and age, and was during an era where the citizens of America wanted to really watch adventure movies that had them on the edge of their seat. The entertainment industry was small back then, so you can bet that when King Kong came out, the audiences were LOVING it!

Now it is many years since then, and the citizens of America have watched many adventure/horror/monster films. Less and less films seem to be putting people at the edge of their seat, however. But this version of King Kong, which does justice to the former, really does do just that: it entertains!

Follow the characters on an epic (sometimes dull) adventure to Skull Island, where they meet savage natives who desire to sacrifice one of the main characters, Anne, to their god-on-earth: Kong. However, as time goes on, Anne and Kong experience a strong friendship. The things they went through on Skull Island (fighting dinosaurs and sliding down vines,) bring them close together. This truly is a modern-day tale of Beauty & The Beast.

Like mentioned before, some moments are dull, and the movie could have done with some editing. It is long, but perhaps rightfully so. The story is enriched in this new version, and we get to delve deeper into the characters and their psyche.

Peter Jackson undoubtedly worked tirelessly on this film: he deserves our applause!

Buy this DVD; it is definitely worth the money!",1153612800,,1524,4.757575757575758
7602444,1,B01AHWLX2O,"This was the worst movie I've seen in a long time.  At first I thought the awful acting was a parody.  Then I realized the movie was trying to take itself seriously.  A pardoy could've been done in 90 minutes.  At 90 minutes, this painful experience was just getting warmed up.  Terrible acting, terrible believability (ok, maybe that's my fault - expecting plausible stories in a giant gorilla movie), boring pace, and awful execution.  About the only thing the movie had going for it were a couple beautiful shots on skull island.

Peter Jackson undid all the goodwill he earned from the Lord of the Rings trilogy.",1153612800,11,616,4.700934579439252
7602445,2,B01AHWLX2O,"All the special effects, technological advances and 70+ years of movie making progress and Peter Jackson can't hold a candle to the original.  Someone should have told him he was remaking King Kong - not Mighty Joe Young.  Ann Darrow is not supposed to fall in love with Kong, Kong's supposed to fall in love with her.

I could cut about 1 hour out of this movie and make it better, but it would still take a distant back seat to the original.

I could go on and on, but suffice to say this was a huge dissappointment.",1153526400,4,518,4.255102040816326

7602448,2,B01AHWLX2O,"I Just realized that this film is really a parody of the original. It stars a funny comedian, Jack Black, who bugs out his eyes and makes funny faces. Funny!!

The Hero is a skinny funny looking guy too. Hilarious!!! The film is full of funny moments too, Like when you expect Kong to see Ann on stage and its someone else!!! Its a spoof of the original!! I get it. It even has tongue-in-cheek comedy ,like the moment when Kong is going wild in the street and stops when he sees Ann standing there with the lights around her, and its real corney and we all groan.

HA!!HAA!!!! I get it! I get jokes!! Hey, I just noticed. Kong and the dinosaurs and the whole movie look like one big cartoon. and cartoons are funny. Right?  Never seen Buggs Bunny?

Casting an actress who is old enough to be Ann Darrows mother has to constitute some sort of joke. Doesn't it? And the plot is a reverse of the original. The girl falls in love with the ape.  Its spoofing the original King Kong. SEE!!!!

Maybe Peter Jackson should stick to elves. Comedy just isn't his thing. Maybe Blake Edwards or Mel Brooks should have directed. Hey, didn't Mel do that remake of The Fly. Thats how you remake 'em right.",1153353600,6,1189,4.333333333333333

The first hour could have add a little time taken off of it but I thought it was fine, because i love long movies. The part when they are on skull island is the best part in my opinion. Jack Black plays the guy with the camara whos leading expedition(forgot his name in the movie) and does a good job with it. I was really surprised when i learned he was in this movie. Andy Serkis also does the motion for king king like he did for Gollum in LOTR. I didn't really recognize any of the other actors in this movie, but that is fine, cause i like having newer guys play in movies. Naomi Watts does well in her role and so does all the others.

7602453,1,B01AHWLX2O,"First and foremost, the original 1933 version of King Kong still

stands as the quintessential monster movie. The special effects

are still unsurpassed, realistic and wrenching. The cast is perfect, especially Fay Wray who by herself invented the movie scream. the fact that the original is seen in glorious black and white adds to the films moodiness and mystery. In short, it is an unequaled work of art that required no further rendition.

Now to the recent remake. I titled this review No Progress because as soon as I saw the action on Skull Island I realized that the CGI looked cartoonish, unrealistic, phony and remarked

that 73 years later, film making took a giant step backward.

This remake, like many others is a classic example of subtraction by addition. The sad fact is that many young people

will only know this colorized version and not appreciate the

extraordinary vision and achievement of the original.

But Hollywood can do special effects - that's one of its few strengths - so every generation of film makers needs a chance to show off their updated software skills. Hence, King Kong 2005 is a natural, super-sized with all the special effects that were a real challenge to make credible in the earlier versions. And this new one has been PETA-sized, with an added component: not only can a giant dark ape fall in love with a beautiful blond white woman, but a beautiful blond white woman can fall in love with a giant dark ape. A marriage made in - well, Skull Island. Hence, the underlying imperialist theme is dulled a little (but only a little), and we're left with a 3-hour homage to achronological monsters, animal rights, and the true nature of love. Standing over the defeated Kong's limp, crushed body just toppled from the great monument to civilization, Jack Black (stupidly) concludes: beauty killed the beast.

7602456,4,B01AHWLX2O,"Some movies have implausible plots that can often be overlooked,but when they get too far-fetched,they spoil the whole movie. KING KONG has these which reduce the overall continuity of the film.

In comparison with the classic 1933 version,this remake undoubtedly excels in almost every aspect of movie making. Yet it has some distinct plot holes :

1. The tribal native vaulting from pole to pole over a series  of broken headlands in  bad weather at night,kidnapping the lead actress from the ship and carrying her back to the land.

  Seeing that the poles are stuck to the sea bed,it is hard to believe that a pole can be THAT long. All the more implausible is the way the native returns from the ship,with the victim, to the land.

  The 1933 version has the natives use a boat and jump onto the ship to kidnap the lead actress. This is plausible.

2.  The surviving expedition crew hauling the drugged Kong up  onto the ship.

  With only few survivors left alive and without any possible aid from the hostile natives,how do they do that ?

  In the 1933 version,Kong is said to be brought to the ship on a makeshift raft and besides,there are also the natives who might have given help. Quite convincing.

3.  Kong being chained and exhibited in the concert hall.

  The building must have been built before Kong is brought  back to New York. So,how do the people get Kong inside it ? How HUGE can the hall entrance be considering the location of the hall in the city center ?

  There is not any depiction of any rear or special entrance from where Kong is brought in. The 1933 version has it. Clever.

Were this the 1933 version,I would compromise. But being a 2005 remake,these should have been made more convincing.

That said,the 2005 version has proven that not all remakes are  worse than the original. KING KONG will become a FUTURE classic just as the 1933 version has.",1152057600,6,1885,4.587349397590361
7602457,4,B01AHWLX2O,"What is it about a remake that creates such skepticism within everyone? Perhaps the most common argument heard every time a film is re-made: ""Why redo something that was perfect the first time?"" It's a question often posed when a new band covers a classic song. The only real answer to the question is one that certainly applies to Peter Jackson's King Kong. It's a way to honor a classic film and introduce it to a whole new generation.

  Outlining the well-known plot of King Kong may be a futile practice, but please indulge me. Hoping for a great film and willing to do anything to make it, filmmaker Carl Denham (Black) sets sail on a small ship to Skull Island with his newly recruited actress, Ann Darrow (Watts). On the ship, Ann falls for the scriptwriter and author, Jack Driscoll (Brody). After reaching the Island, Denham finds it more dangerous than he had expected and has his actress kidnapped by the native people for sacrifice to Kong. While searching for Ann and after losing his film (along with a few of his shipmates) Denham decides he can still profit from this expedition by capturing Kong and bringing him back to New York.

 The first hour of the film is slow to say the least. Black's performance is drenched in melodrama in a successful attempt to reflect the 1933 film. But the hour of this in New York runs much longer than it should. When the film finally makes it on to the ship, it drags again to allow for the relationship between Darrow and Driscoll to form and grow. By the time we first see Kong, we felt like we've already watched an entire film and when considering the time that has elapsed that's not too difficult to imagine.

 As far as acting goes, this film was not challenging for the actors, but the performance was demanding. It's hard to imagine the giant inhabitants of Skull Island not being there as you see the reactions on the faces of the actors. It's easy to forget that these monsters are added in later by a computer. That is accredited to performance. I doubt that Naomi Watts ever thought she'd have to juggle in front of a giant ape or that Adrien Brody knew he would have to fight a monkey for the love of a woman. The interactions between the ape and the humans must be appreciated.

 Not surprisingly, the most interesting character to watch is Kong himself. His countenance alone runs parallel to the genres illustrated by the film. The anger of his face emphasizes the passion present in the fight scenes and supports the action significantly. The soft, human expression he displays when looking upon Darrow underlines the admiration he feels and the love story, which may be the strongest theme of the film. Our view of Kong changes throughout the film, and it's a skillful device on Jackson's part.

 Though the love story is strong, the action does not suffer. Don't be fooled, this film is a lot of fun to watch. It's easy to get taken in by the scene where Kong battles three Tyrannosaurus Rexes. Jackson has invested a lot of time in making sure every aspect of the film is just right, and he did not hold back on the action.

  As for the criticism this and other remakes have endured, I fail to see the harm in it. Peter Jackson was a fan of the original King Kong ever since he first saw it as a child. His film pays homage to the classic and that's apparent through small elements, not to mention the fact that he chose to set the film in the same time period as the original instead of making a modern update, as the worst of remakes choose to do.

 I noticed that many DVD stores started repackaging the original and putting it on display cases, as is the common routine when a remake comes out. After this new King Kong perhaps some people will check out the original, which is the greatest purpose for any remake. Not all of us were around in 1933 to see the mighty Kong on the screen for the first time, and we need a reminder of what made it so magical in the first place. The question here should not be ""why remake King Kong?"" Rather we should wonder if, after Lord of the Rings and the running time of King Kong at 187 minutes, is Peter Jackson capable of making a movie less than three hours long?",1151971200,4,4183,4.441253263707572
7602458,5,B01AHWLX2O,A beautifully filmed tragic fantasy of a force of nature finding a little solace before its inescapable demise. The film seems to take a long time to get started and Jack Black muggs more than he acts. But once on Skull island the movie just takes off. It would have been great to learn why the natives turn blonde white girls over to Kong and what happened to the other girls. But when a film is this good I'm willing to forget logic for a couple of hours.,1151884800,,457,4.204545454545454
7602459,5,B01AHWLX2O,"A sign of of a really good movie is how well it tells a story. In this new, modern, fast paced and exciting film we are transported into the world of Kong and swept away its storytelling.  It is nothing short of a miracle that Peter Jackson has been able to bring this story to a contemporary audience and retell the story of Kong without said audience laughing.  It is both epic in scale and human in its pathos -- we care about Kong -- when was the last time you had true emotion for a CGI character is recent memory?  Great movie and Great storytelling.",1151884800,,556,4.226415094339623
7602460,1,B01AHWLX2O,"Given the level of creativity and the seamless implementation of WETA's effects, I expected much more from this movie than a long overdrawn saga.  The story was okay, but hindered badly by the poor integration of live-action and cg.  I mean, the compositing was just plain lousy and the movements of the large creatures weren't scaled well at all.  I was so distracted during the scene in which the characters are running from the herd of brachiosaurs (or whatever they were) by the obvious fakery of the images that I couldn't see past it.  Better effects were achieved in the original King Kong.  I don't expect to see this kind of crap on screen when it comes from the same people who were behind LOTR.

In short, King Kong was overhyped, overbudgeted, underproduced and overall underwhelming.  The best example of integrated cg in a film is still the first film to use the technology:  Jurassic Park.  Let's hope that Peter Jackson decides to take on something less classic and less demanding on the audience.",1151884800,11,1013,4.775862068965517

7602462,3,B01AHWLX2O,"This newest version of ""King Kong"" takes the old story, with a few twists, and polishes it with superb special effects that create the most human, the most believable, King Kong to date.  Aspiring and desperate actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) accepts a role offered by the shady producer Carl Denham (Jack Black) who promises her exotic travels aboard the ship he has procured.  Likewise, well-known playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) is tricked into the trip and thus writing the script featuring Ann and her self-involved co-star.  Unbeknownst to all but the captain and Denham, the ship sails not for Asia but for the legendary Skull Island, where Denham hopes to film a 1930s brand of reality television, complete with bona fide danger and discovery.  What they find there, however, exceeds all expectations.

Naomi Watts is radiant and adept in the otherwise thin role of a woman at the mercy of forces beyond her control.  She and Brody have remarkable on-screen chemistry, but she shines most in her Kong scenes, where she charms the enormous beast with her spontaneous antics and, later, her compassion.  Yes, she can scream to rival Faye Wray and Jessica Lange, but director Peter Jackson allows her to act as well.  When she leaves the screen for a prolonged time near the end, the viewer misses her as much as Kong does.  Despite her performance, the real star of this film is digitally created Kong, a creation so realistic and nuanced that one can forget that he is not a real, breathing gigantic gorilla.  His transformation from terrifying brute to an animal who can both be amused by a cartwheel and sit contemplatively before a sunset is one of this film's greatest triumphs.

The cinematic atmosphere, in muted colors and Art Deco landscapes, of 1930s New York lends the film a nostalgic texture that fits perfectly with this remake.  Jackson's favorite New Zealand countryside has the raw savagery that seems likely to harbor creatures such as Kong, gigantic bugs, and hoards of dinosaurs.  Despite the technical and artistic elements, ""King Kong"" falters because of the story itself, a tale that has always been subservient to special effects.  Its progress is so predictable and lacking of subtlety that, if not for the visual stimulation, the viewer would fall asleep.  In fact, the viewer can probably wander out of the room and return fifteen minutes later without missing anything important.

For the sheer exhilaration of Kong's creation and the cinematography, this movie is worth watching -- once.  Unless you are a computer graphics/special effects buff, you probably won't want to see ""King Kong"" more than once",1151712000,,2647,5.006849315068493
7602463,5,B01AHWLX2O,"The original King Kong was one of my all time favorite movies and I still love it, but I must say that I actually love this remake more.  The spectacular special effects, characters you care about (I love the relationship between Jimmy and Mr. Hayes, Denham and his assistant) and of course the wonderfully poignant and tender friendship of Ann and Kong.  Another thing I love about this movie is Jack Driscoll's bravery, he is relentless in his pursuit of the woman he loves and after she loses Kong she realizes that Jack has gone to enormous lengths to find her, how could she not reciprocate his love.  Adrian Brody is great in this role as is the beautifully expressive Naomi Watts.  I love everything about this movie including the opening scenes of 30s NYC, the shots of the vaudeville circuit and the animals, I didn't feel it dragged the film down, neither does the ship's journey to Skull Island, the scene where the fog surrounds the ship as they near the island is extremely creepy.  All of the prehistoric creatures are amazing and frightening and the island/jungle itself is remarkable.  My favorite scene probably is after Kong's triumphant battle with the T-Rex's and he sort of shames Ann into running after him, he finally picks her up and puts her on his shoulder, it's as though he's thinking, ""after all I've done for you, you try to escape from me, hmmmph!""  This is a wonderfully engrossing film with characters you care about.  And the musical score is lovely too.  As Ann and Kong would say, King Kong is beautiful...",1151280000,6,1542,4.681481481481481

Let me make this brief, this movie was an enormous disappointment WITH THE EXCEPTION of the brilliantly acted and shot scenes on the ship as it arrives at the island and gets hung up on the rocks -- I loved it! The actor who played the captain was excellent. I also thought the visuals of the biplanes at the end were extraordinary, but I'd turn the air blue if I described what I thought about the rest of the movie. WAY off target, not worth viewing, honestly, and I expected a terrific movie.

7602468,3,B01AHWLX2O,"I really didn't expect to enjoy this movie at all.  I never really thought the first movie was that interesting except as an interesting special effects flick, which though showing effects way ahead of its time, still didn't really have a story I cared much about.  Seeing the commercials for this and how the dinosaurs all looked like animated bits of gravy lumps, knowing that it was over three hours long on a story I didn't care about, and so on, I figured it really wasn't worth the time.

Actually, I found its excessiveness and absurdities to be its best parts.  Absolutely nothing in this movie really stands under the weight of, ""Why?"", but it is drastically refreshing to see a director just let go and do whatever he wants, as much as he wants, as long as he wants.  This movie ended up being well worth the time... even when the scenes seemed like they'd never end.

The problem is, I could nitpick it forever.  Nobody likes a nitpicker, so I won't, and since it's absurd anyway, nitpicking it won't serve any purpose but to aggravate the playlength.  Instead, I spent my time enjoying what I could, among them

1) Now Kong and Ann actually have a relationship that makes the closing line have any meaning.

2) Kong's animated expressiveness matches that of Gollum's, but Kong has the added difficulty of being unable to speak.

3) Jack Black is funny.  Okay, so he wasn't meant to be, but still he came off as funny.  I enjoyed it at least.

4) Adrien Brody is a great actor and I was amazed at how much emotion he put into a role that I'm pretty sure nobody even remotely connected to this movie cared that much about.

The things that couldn't be ignored was stuff like that side story involving the child hand on the ship (soooooo useless...) and the orcs... 'scuse me, natives... attacking in very long and boring slow motion.

Overall I'm glad I actually ended up seeing it.  I can't really see myself seeing it much more often, but for one viewing it entertains for a good long time, keeping up the pace the entire time.

A note on this DVD edition: I don't know if it's the transfer or not, but the sound on this thing is TERRIBLE.  Whenever the sound effects sound like they're supposed to get loud, everything deadens.  I've tried it on two different speaker systems and eventually with headphones and finally settled with the headphones because I could still hear what was going on on those scenes.

THE REASON I didn't see it in the theatres, by the way, is that I hate Mr. Jack Black and, at the time, thought he deserved no place in this film. Boy was I wrong and sorry for being mislead also by my friends and family who said he was bad. Quiet the opposite he was amazing and Peter Jackson step up to the plate with bases loaded with his lord of the rings saga and hit a grand slam. AMAZING.

The effects were true to Jackson form, not over done, but we couldn't live without them. Kong was spectacular. His eyes had life and he successfully captured the lead role in this film.

I would recommend this movie a million time over to anyone. Please buy it.",1150848000,9,752,4.108843537414966
7602470,2,B01AHWLX2O,"The story of King Kong is so simple that a 7-minute miniepisode of The Simpsons tells as much story as Peter Jackson's 3-hour movie.  But we all know the story anyway - Jackson's challenge is to bring modern filmmaking techniques to the story and to give us something we've never seen before.  Certainly, his recreation of 1930's NYC is impressive, and his Kong is amazing.  Unfortunately, that is where my praise for the film ends (except to mention Jack Black's performance, which was a treat to watch).

There are a lot of details that I could go into as to why I consider Jackson's film to be failure.  None of these would be fatal on their own, and in fact most would be quickly forgiven in an engaging film.  But therein lies the problem - this film is not engaging.  In fact, it's somewhat dull.  This is not the director that brought out such wonderful and subtle performances in the LotR trilogy but rather the director of B-level horror films like Braindead.  There is simply too much action over too long a time, and the brain tunes out.  The story is made to showcase the abilities of the special effects, rather than the effects serving the needs of the story.

Even then the effects are not the best I've seen.  How this film won an Oscar when Star Wars III wasn't even nominated is offensive!  As I mentioned, Kong himself is very impressive, but nothing else in the film matches that achievement.  This would not be a problem if the filmakers were aiming for a stylised cartoon-like vision.  But Kong's realism serves to highlight the inadequacies of the rest of the film.  Most damaging are the scenes on the water (see: Master and Commander for how a boat should look at sea!), the dinosaurs (that are no better than Spielberg's in Jurassic Park, now 12 years old!), and the actors' performances (who look like they are staring off into space rather than looking at something).

But basically it all comes down to the fact that there is too little story and no reason to tell it.  The scenes on Skull Island seem endless, and endlessly similar, as we see dinosaurs attacking the ship's crew, then fighting Kong, then fighting Kong some more, then attacking Ann Darrow, then fighting Kong, then.... but you get the idea.  Oddly, the first hour (setting up the expedition) was widely derided by the critics, but is really the only part of the film worth watching.

This DVD edition is actually quite nice, with the expected full-spread of extras.  The extras might even be better than those on the LotR special editions - certainly they are tighter and more eye-catching for the casual viewer.  The film looks and (especially) sounds great.

7602472,2,B01AHWLX2O,"My basic analogy for what Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' is like is: what if you took a blender, and tossed in grilled hamburger, pickles, chocolate ice cream, ketchup, cheese, wasabi, vodka, peanut butter, guacamole, orange juice, mashed potatoes, maple syrup, hot chili peppers, one Mountain Dew, four espressos, and then you set your blender on 'HIGH' and ground all this stuff up together, until you came out with a big, frothy, gloopy, stinking porridge of stuff that might've been tasty on its own, but now makes absolutely no aesthetic sense at all!

Case in point: what possible sense does it make to have a violently repugnant scene of men being eaten alive by surreally huge, slimy, grotesque worms with fangs in one scene - and then cut to the next scene, where the big gorilla and his lovely human damsel-in-distress recline together to watch the ultimate Hallmark-card sunset together in some sort of 'romantic idyll'? Way to develop the dramatic/romantic atmosphere through scene structure, Mr. Jackson! I honestly can't remember another movie having more jarring & outright ludicrous shifts-of-tone since David Lynch's 'Wild At Heart.'

I think this would be *the perfect* movie for students in film schools to be given, to learn the 'art of editing;' their assignment would be: Take this bloated, unruly behemoth of a movie, and chop out ONE WHOLE HOUR of the super-extraneous, pointless, redundant & downright annoying material. Because the fact of the matter is, ladies & gents, perhaps in the entire history of movies has there never been a more obvious case of a potentially impressive and enjoyable 2-hour-long movie lurking inside a swollen, obnoxious, post-Oscar-winning-monomanaical, ""everything I write and shoot is golden,"" director's-head-up-his-derriere 3-hour (or 4-hour, depending on your DVD) pseudo-epic.

The movie is far from worthless - but it wouldn't be so infuriating if it was worse.  The production design and special effects are mostly brilliant, and Kong's final scaling of, and fall from, the Empire State Building is very satisfying (with exception to the completely implausible choreography of the human characters throughout the sequence).  Unfortunately, as beautifully as Kong has been digitally realized, the story completely fails on any recognizable human level, mainly because all of the characters seem wheeled out of the movie studio's decades-old Closet of Stock Cliches (the screenwriters and director haven't even dusted them off - they LIKE all that dust).  Naomi Watts brings zip and life to whatever she does, and of all the actors present her generic down-on-her-luck-flapper fares the best.  The incredibly gifted Adrien Brody, so extraordinarily compelling and heartbreaking in Roman Polanski's 'The Pianist', brings an understated charm to his underwritten and underdeveloped Depression-era Broadway playwright; his character's relevance becomes increasingly lost in the din and dank of Skull Island, and is all but completely discarded by the time Kong reaches the island of New York.  And Jack Black as the opportunistic-filmmaker-turned-totally-craven-businessman acts like he just brushed up on (but didn't bother to finish) his Intro-To-Theatre-101 Cliff Notes; Black's marvelous comic potential, which always has the possibility of hitting some wickedly enjoyable high notes ala Jack Nicholson, is used by Peter Jackson for less than five minutes of this entire dreary endeavor. (Black and his supporting cast basically spend all their time amateurishly over-emulating in this Tin Pan Alley action-adventure soap opera, desperately trying to bring some life to the endless and interminable procession of lifeless scenes in Jackson's & Fran Walsh's & Phillipa Boyen's shrieking-for-rewrites screenplay.)

From his truly-worthy-of-the-title-of-""masterpiece"" 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' to 'King Kong', Peter Jackson, The Director As Superstar, has gone from emulating a masterly David Lean of 'Lawrence of Arabia' to the insufferable artistic egotism of a Michael Cimino circa 'Heaven's Gate,' only with a zillion geeky fanboys around the world willing to shill out an extra $20 to obsessively salivate over his every passing thought and mundane remark on bonus supplementary DVDs (which lately seem to be just as important a concern, if not more so, to Jackson than the actual movie which he's working on).  I sincerely hope in the coming years of his career that Jackson does not become a prisoner of his own multi-million-dollar FX and art departments at his rightly honored WETA Workshop in New Zealand, and instead gets back to doing what he does best: making movies featuring compelling human characters and stories.  His earlier masterpiece, 'Heavenly Creatures' (1994), one of the very finest movies of the last 20 years, was made for around 1/100th of the budget of 'King Kong,' and has 1,000 times more genuinely human emotional impact, not to mention truly audience-invested entertainment value.  (It would be most heartening if Jackson follows through with his tentative plans to scale his operation down & adapt Alice Sebold's terrifying modern literary classic 'The Lovely Bones' for the screen, because at the moment there is no living movie director who is more in need of a stupefyingly-overwrought-big-budget-blockbuster aesthetic enema.)

My girlfriend's review of Jackson's 'King Kong' was simple enough: ""That movie was a pain in my a** - literally & figuratively.""",1150675200,7,5471,5.452718676122932
7602473,3,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson is a talented director, but he doesn't seem to know the difference between a roller coaster ride and a film. In this Kong version the special effects have become so ""over charged"" they have overshadowed everything including Kong himself. While the animation is very detailed and true to form. I did find much of the action / motion to fast and seemly lacking the mass of real life. This isn't helped by the fact that many movements are simply to impossible too believed.

Small point I personally would have liked more time exploring Skull Island! Less gore(skulls and bones)and dark atmosphere!
Fewer numbers and more varieties(i.e. Apatosaurus stampedes and cervase insects).

The acting wasn't bad but the writing and characterization are unnerving for lovers of the orginal 1933 KING KONG.
Jack Black is miscasted as Carl Denham.
I am not fond of the way the natives are depicted as sub-humans.

Although I don't think any Oscars will be shelled out for the acting in King Kong, I must disagree with those that say the performances were terrible.  I was not a Jack Black fan going into the movie, but I am more so now.  All the other roles were either done well or only suffered from a bit of mis-direction, if you can forgive the play on words.  And I've heard numerous reviewers say how bad the final line of the movie is.  Am I wrong, or isn't the last line taken straight from the original?

Speaking of nods to previous versions, I just had to make mention of the native stage scene.  (I haven't seen it previously mentioned, though I haven't read all 700+ reviews on this site either.)  The costumes for the natives on stage in New York looked very much like the true natives' costumes from the 70s version.  Fans of Kong had to chuckle at that.

As far as the movie's length goes, I had no problems with it.  When I'm shelling out $9 to see a movie, I'll take three hours over two any day, as long as I'm not bored.  I did not find myself squirming once, unlike Lord of the Rings...and I'm very much a Tolkien fan!  Of course, with three hours to work with, I understand those reviewers asking for a little more character thought into just what is going on there at Skull Island.  On the other hand, they of course would have no idea and didn't seem to have much time to think about it.

The brontosaurus (or whatever they are exactly) pile-up, though a great idea, was a little cheesy for my tastes.  As many have already stated, the CGI was a little suspect here and too many people escaped certain death.  That is a problem I have with most action movies these days, though.  The certain death factor can be scaled back a little bit to make it both scary AND believable.  Only one character to my recollection simply found a crevice to hide in until the rolling thunder passed.  Did other reviewers miss the folks that were pulverized into oblivion in that scene, though?  And I understand that there was a need to spur the beasts into a stampede, but enough with the raptors already.  Kong or one of the T-Rex's would have sufficed.

My biggest grief with the movie was the bat scene.  Using one as a hang-glider was just plain bad.  Luckily, the scene is short and thus a little more forgivable.  Don't get me wrong, though.  Whereas the scenes in the city were the highlight of the previous movies, the jungle action was probably the pinnacle of this film, for good or ill.  The bugs scene, probably another nod to the original ""snake pit"" footage that was cut due to its grisliness (if I recall correctly) and subsequently lost to time, was utterly disturbing and the effects fantastic.

Speaking of effects, I agree with some reviewers that Kong himself seemed to have slightly varying sizes throughout the movie, but I'm not sure everyone is considering the beast's surroundings.  He's obviously going to look bigger inside a New York theatre as compared to the top of the Empire State Building.  I can certainly forgive a few feet here or there if it's done for good cinematic effect.

Another question mark is the taxi cab chase.  As fun as it was to watch, just what was the character trying to accomplish?  Instead of leaving Kong to his business of smashing a bus all to pieces, he leads him on a romp through the city causing untold amounts of carnage and property damage.  I guess you could argue that he had the best of intentions (draw the beast away from the bus) and, again, didn't have a lot of time to think about the repercussions.

So you must be wondering, after all of the low points I've detailed and the explanations I've given for dubious areas of the film, why I was so high on it walking out.  It cannot be fully explained in words.  The detail of the early city scenes, the character building on the boat, the dramatic build up to the finding of the isle, the sweeping landscapes of the jungle, the terror of the native attack, the dinosaur fight scenes, the vertigo of the airplane assault scenes all must be experienced (preferably in the theater) to be understood.  I even enjoyed the ""ice skating"" scene, but then I'm a sucker for whimsical brutes.

Though you can debate the nuances and certain parts of the storyline, I can't see how anyone can reasonably argue that Peter Jackson did a disservice to the Kong franchise with this incarnation.  I would be inclined to say just the opposite: that the atmosphere of the film alone was worth the price of admission.  But hey, take any review with a grain of salt, especially from a self-proclaimed fanboy.",1150243200,9,5152,4.467880085653105

7602481,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Viewed on the small screen, last year's King Kong is a bit more of a problematic experience than it was on the big screen, being at once a mixture of the best and worst of Peter Jackson. His love of and sheer joy in film-making is manifestly obvious right from the delirious opening montage of Depression era New York that gives the background detail a modern audience wouldn't bring into the theatre with them as they did in 1933 with a wonderful visual economy so much of the rest of the film lacks. Unfortunately he then spends a couple of reels detailing the death of Vaudeville and Carl Denham's problems with studio execs. And then a couple of reels on getting under way. And then far too many reels sailing to Skull Island - when Denham promised Ann a long ocean voyage, he wasn't kidding. It's not so much that they're bad scenes (though some are quite weak), more that there's no reason for all of them to be there. Most could have easily been thrown over the side with the rest of the ship's fittings, but instead they tend to bury the more portentous moments under trivia. Indeed, it's interesting to note that a draft of Jackson's aborted attempt to film it in 1998 included none of this section whatever, kicking off with the Venture piercing the fog in search of Skull Island.

But once it literally crashes into Skull Island, the film really takes off - the natives this time really are savage, almost Neolithic, the action scenes well-handled and the pace relentless. Jackson even manages to top several sequences from the original - the Bride of Kong sacrifice, Kong escaping from the Broadway theatre, the Empire State Building finale, here a breathtakingly dizzying piece of filmmaking - as well as throwing in some good additions of his own, such as a truly charming scene on the ice in Central Park or a couple of convincing storm sequences on the perilous shores of Skull Island. There are plenty of fun injokes that don't seem awkwardly forced on the picture either - Denham tries to get Fay Wray for the lead in his picture, but she's making a film for Merian C. Cooper at RKO; the scene they shoot on the boat is one from the 1933 film; Rick Baker, the man inside the suit in 1976, is one of the pilots gunning down Kong; and the interpolation of much of Max Steiner's score offers some nice musical nods even if the ""Walla Walla Kong Kong!"" lyrics are omitted.

There's more that's good than bad about the film by a long way, but the bad is bad enough to keep this from becoming an all-time classic in its own right

There's some striking miscasting. Much as he looks like Orson Welles in certain shots, Jack Black really isn't up to Carl Denham, a part Oliver Platt or Vincent D'Onfrio could have dome in their sleep: too often he looks like he's telling a joke that's fallen flat rather than delivering dramatic dialog, and there's that air of trying too hard that follows him around like a bad smell. Naomi Watts is surprisingly anodyne and not terribly flatteringly photographed (to put it mildly), reminding me why, despite some good work in the past, she remains so resolutely unmemorable an actress. Kyle Chandler hams it up fairly charmlessly as her nominal leading man, telegraphing the jokes to such a degree that they're more irritating distractions than genuine comic relief. Adrien Brody's unlikely hero fares better despite having nothing much to do in the last act, while the smaller roles fare better, with Thomas Kretschmann's Engelhorn, Evan Parke's Hayes and Jamie Bell's cabin boy all making their mark before being unceremoniously discarded.

But the acting honors easily belong to Andy Serkis' Kong, a triumph not just of CGI (and far more convincing than he appeared in the trailers) but also performance. It's not merely that this Kong is more facially expressive - he's caught the body language perfectly, convincing us that it's a great ape rather than a human being dictating the moves. It makes the same mistake as the 1976 version in having Ann feel empathy with Kong which, while better executed here, lessens the tragedy of Kong - the fact his devotion was unrequited was one of the things that made his last stand so much more touching and pitiful.

Elsewhere, the effects are variable and too often Jackson throws in an FX shot just because he likes the idea - not so much a problem with the beasties but definitely tiresome when we get to yet another CGI shot of the ship at sea. Nor are all of the effects quite state of the art. The problem is the old one with CGI - poor integration of the live action and computer generated footage, both of which all too often seem to be shot at visibly different resolutions (particularly noticeable in the stampede sequence). Yet compared to the two previous remakes, Jackson's genuine love of the material still carries the day and certainly delivers the best of 2005's blockbusters.",1150070400,,4884,4.674418604651163
7602482,4,B01AHWLX2O,"This movie had incredible special effects. Before I watched this movie, I had heard it was long and boring; but it was the exact opposite of that. The movie was an action packed film, and there were barely any slow parts in it. The story is about a director who is trying to make it big. Only he is very slimy and commits many lies through the making of the film. The crew manages to make it to an island that contains a huge monkey(King Kong). Everyone is scared but excited at the same time. The ending is incredibly sad but the journey through the movie is worth it. Jack Black brings humor into the film. But the five star part of the movie is the special effects, and how realistic the different creatures look.",1150070400,11,716,4.311111111111111

Mingled in between for what seemed like eternity was a bit lifted right out of Jurassic Park replete with horrible special effects looking like they were from a cheap Japanese Godzilla film years ago (they obviously spent all of the effects budget on the ape). And... someone PLEASE tell Jack Black to take some acting classes. How a marginal talent like this guy lands a gig like this movie is beyond me. Completely mis-cast with that dopey half smirk on his face the whole 3 hours. If you want to see King Kong, the original is still by far the best. ** BnB Beatles Depot **",1150070400,11,702,4.325757575757576
7602484,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson is a man who has done some other excellent movies, and this one is definitely not the exception. But I agree with other reviewer here who said that it was too long. I think that too. Probably cutting the beginning a little it would have been about 20 or 30 minutes shorter, but whatever, that's not the most important.

To begin with, the main actors are very good, and they play their roles perfectly. Naomi Watts really broke our heart when she saw King Kong while he was attacked, Jack Black also does a great performance, even though at one point I wanted him to be dead (for the story), and Adrien Brody has always been a terrifir actor who can play any character you tell him to. So, the acting: 10/10.

The special effects are quite great too, King Kong looks excellent in the movie, and it looks very real, but its face just changes a bit in some scenes. But the effects look real, but in one or two scenes they do look fake too... 8/10.

The story is very interesting too, but the beginning is kind of slow, and if they would have edited it a little more, the movie would have been shorter and better. The rest of the movie is great, sometimes you think one thing, and the next minute you think this other thing, so it's not a predictable movie (off the record: and I like that, because I hate predictable movies!!)

The thing I didn't like as much as the rest is the ending. It's very sad, and first I thought they would just send King Kong back to the island, but they didn't, and the way the movie ended was sad and upsetting (for me), because finally the people who had captured King Kong are just free and they don't pay anything. I thought King Kong would kill him, but....whatever, I already saw the movie and it didn't happen. So, story and ending: 9/10.

Everything else, like music, lightening and other stuff (specially music): 20/10.

When this movie came out, a lot of people told me that it was awful, boring and extremely long, and that I shouldn't watch it...Thank God I didn't listen to them, and I don't regret. But I rented this movie on DVD, and I can't deny that if I had been in the movie theatre for three hours, probably this would be a 1-star rating. I have to be honest about that.

7602485,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I've never seen the classic of King Kong, so I didn't know what to expect. It seemed interesting with everybody saying this movie is very good and long. Well I love those type of movies, especially long ones, so I decided to watch this one.

This movie has a very good story to it and the cast is just perfect. Naomi Watts does a wonderful job in her part, along with the other characters. The special effects were awesome and they did a wonderful job in making the movie seem so realistic. I hate those wildlife bugs, so I had to look away for a second when all these huge insects started coming. This movie actually takes place on a island. This is where King Kong lives, and lives a lonely life. Throughout the movie you'll get to know who King Kong is all about and you'll most likely feel sorry for him at the end of the movie. I know I did.

Overall, I find this movie very good. If you're into long and adventure movies, then I suggest that you pick this DVD up. Even if you're not, at least give it a rent. I'll garauntee you that you won't be disappointed.",1149984000,10,1065,4.215686274509804

The movie finally catches fire during the halfway mark when Kong and Ann Darrow share a quiet moment amid the CGI overkill. Though visually impressive, the 2005 version lacks the epic grandeur of the RKO classic, which delivered the goods in less than two hours.

I'm not sure of the characters names so bear with me as i try and explain the plot. Naomi Watts who plays an actress desperate to make it big and she comes across a director (played by Jack Black) who is determined to hit the big time but in an unorthodox way. He wants to make a trip to an uncharted island where there are myths of dinosaurs and other undescovered creatures little do they know they are about to come across the biggest myth of all.

The crew that go to the island during the film come across King Kong and basically the relationship between Kong and Naomi Watts character is a connection of loneliness. Kong is lonely because well he's just a giant ape and Watt's character is lonely because she is an actress.

Enough of that before i give the movie away but this is packed with amazing action and as you have probably already seen amazing special effects. The actions and facial expressions of kong are very much like that of a real silverback gorilla.

7602489,3,B01AHWLX2O,"You would expect more out of Academy Award winning, Peter Jackson. But it seems we were expecting too much. The film is visually stunning. It's worth seeing just for that reason. But the overall film suffers in many areas, resulting in a mediocre remake.

First of all, the casting was bad. Often the actors are very out of place in their roles, even though they give good performances. Some of the selections are very peculiar, Jack Black for instance. Very strange, although he is quite good in his role.

It has some memorable moments, but the majority of the film is boring and pointless. It seems Jackson feels the need to make every movie as long as possible, and the film really suffers because of this. Even with the strange casting, the film still could have been great. The length is what really knocks it down a level. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a 3 hour long movie as much as anyone else, but the extra length was pointless. It didn't add anything to the movie.

As I said before, it's worth a watch for the special effects. Just don't go in expecting an amazing film.

7602491,3,B01AHWLX2O,"The 1933 KING KONG was very much ""state of the art"" and then some for its era, a great financial success, and even as special effects have advanced it has remained a great favorite.  A 1976 version proved popular at the box office, but seemed to leave a sour taste in the audience's mouth, falling out of favor as soon as it ended its theatrical run; nonetheless, many studios and directors have been attracted to the idea of a third remake over the years.  After demonstrating his mastery of CGI blockbusters with THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, director Peter Jackson got the green light.

Although there have been more than a few tweaks, the basic story remains the same.  Producer-Director Carl Denham (Jack Black) is desperate for an actress to appear in a semi-documentary film, and he lures down-on-her-luck Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) into joining him on an expedition to an uncharted island.  Along the way, Ann falls in love with Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody)--but when the party arrives at Skull Island she finds herself beloved by the tallest, darkest leading man in film history.

On the surface, the film has a lot going for it.  Rather than update the film, Jackson elected to set it in the early 1930s, and the images of period New York are impressive; so too are the CGI effects from start to finish.  But it rapidly turns into too much of a good thing.  Jackson seems to feel that if one was good in the original film, then three or more will better--and so once we arrive on Skull Island we have herds of dinosaurs, not to mention a host of really nasty insects and some equally foul bats-like creatures.  A great many people have said it looks more like a video game than a movie, and the criticism is dead on target.

If the CGI is wildly overdone, the film also suffers from a  script that saddles Naomi Watts and Adrien Brody with a certain goody-goody-gumdrops quality--and to add insult to injury calls for Jack Black, in what must be the most totally unappealing performance of the past decade, to stand around with narrowed eyes and a shifty expression.  He looks more like a dope dealer on the lam than a documentary film maker, and his every scene is both tired and tiresome beyond all possible description.

But the ultimate killer, in my opinion any way, is the film's total lack of innocence.  It's a 1933 story remade in 2005 but dressed up in 1933 clothes--and it doesn't have the conviction of its costuming.  I didn't believe any of it, not for a single CGI-laden minute.  So far as mindless eye candy goes, the 2005 KING KONG is (Jack Black excepted) reasonably entertaining, but it really doesn't have any content to set it apart from the rest of the CGI pack, and I can't imagine that it will be remembered any more fondly than the largely forgotten 1976 version.

The action was awesome (and at times, a bit brutal and excessive), and it got your heart-rate up and had you totally immersed. But, some of the films better moments were the quieter ones, the ones in which Kong interacts with the damsel Ann Darrow (an underwhelming performance by Naomi Watts, I'm sorry to say). Kong is so realistic that, sometimes he even seems human. The final fight sequence/ending scene is heart-rending, and it is difficult  to resist applauding Jackson's sheer ingenuity when the credits roll around.

I was not expecting to love this but I was expecting it to be alright and maybe even pretty good.  But this movie was absolutely torture to sit through.

First off, it's a CGI fest. Of course I knew that going in but I had a false hope that perhaps they would show restraint and use CGI skillfully.  I haven't paid attention but I hope this did not win any special effects awards.  The effects of this movie and those of its type are not artistry or cinematic skill, it's all a matter of computer technology being powerful enough to process and render it all.

This has all the undesirable aspects associated with CGI.  It has the overly elaborate absurd action sequences.  People run under a stampede of dinosaurs always finding the right spot to avoid being trampled and a guy karate kicks a dinosaur as he jumps from the foot of a larger dinosaur.  We have outrageous falls and always something available and utilized to break the action and he used as a swing to further combative action.  Ordinary people are utilizing everything in the environment to do amazing feats.

We also have the ridiculous shifting camera angles that seem so unnatural because they can not represent anyone's point of view.

This movie is backed by a bland musical score.  The acting is equally bland and doesn't cause any identification to the characters.  To me this movie hinges on the identification of the relationship between Kong and the woman which was created so beautifully in the 1976 version.

In this one, Kong is whipping the woman around violently.  So much so that her neck would have to be broken.  Kong also starts out displaying threatening intimidation and intimidating bullying of the woman.  The mood becomes like a kid's movie as the woman wins Kong over by juggling and dancing for his entertainment.

I was also annoyed by the movie switching to horror mode with the natives being presented as witch type characters.

The bulk of the movie is spent in CGI Jurassic Park mode with constant CGI dinosaur attacks and Kong/Dinosaur battles.  We also have multitudes of large CGI creatures attacking the other group of adventurers.

As I should have expected but had hoped against, the CGI goes beyond over the top when giant insects are swarming on a guys head and body as he jumps around erratically.  His buddy then gets a machine gun and blasts off the insect attackers that are grasping him.

This really had nothing at common with the groundbreaking film from 1932 besides ending as expected.  Despite recreating nothing worthwhile from the 1932 classic, it did decide to bring back the worst aspect which was the corny ending remark.  ""It was beauty that killed the beast"".

The first 30 - 40 minutes are somewhat tiresome (I'm being generous... we get too much detail.  It goes on too long and it's boring).  Once we get to Skull Island things pick up.  Boy do things pickup!  To start with, the indigenous people on Skull (Mordor) Island are downright scary, it's like the Mau Mau Uprising meets Night of the Living Dead.  Disturbing imagery!

The Kong ""character"" is incredible as are all the creatures on the island.  His range of emotions is amazing - prediction:  this Kong will never be outdone.  My only problem with Jackson's movie is that the action scenes are so over the top in places that they become laughable.  I actually found myself laughing watching Naomi Watts digital stunt double being thrown around from hand-to-hand like a rag doll during the T-Rex battle.  Can you say whiplash whiplash whiplash whiplash whiplash?  There is no way a human being could survive all that tossing around and then stand up.  Every bone in her body would have been broken.  The scene with the brontosaurus/raptor stampede is fun but it's still way too over the top.  I just couldn't suspend belief THAT far - it went from exciting to ridiculous.

In summary.  Great effects, great acting (Naomi Watts manages to pull off caring about Kong without getting corny, as in Jessica Lange's prior take on this character), great cinematography, great directing, great scenes, but the action scenes are just too much in some places and this takes a little away from an otherwise brilliant remake.  Also, this film was at least 30 minutes longer than it needed to be.  I'm reminded of Stephen King's over-indulgence in details details details and books that are a couple of hundred pages longer than they needed to be.

Love yer work Peter Jackson.  Tone it down a smidgeon next time.",1148774400,2,1942,4.745508982035928
7602499,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Since I am on vacation, I watched King Kong for the second time today. I am amazed by this film on several levels. Jackson may have outdone himself on this one from what he did on Lord of the Rings.

A young seventeen year-old I work with told me when she watched King Kong at the movies she cried at the end. I thought she was crazy. I even asked if she understood that I said I was thinking about buying King Kong. I thought she must have misunderstood what movie I was talking about. She said the ape was so real. Again, I thought she meant real from the standpoint of special effects. Nope. That's not what she was talking about.

There is a line in the film that reoccurs: ""they're only words"". First time I saw the movie I caught on to the fact that they were repeated. I did not understand their impact until watching the film for the second time. Heinrich Zimmer said those things that are most important can never be put to words. Well, in this movie, the most important and emotional scenes have no words whatsoever. Tears and laughter, but, no words. They occur between Ann Darrow and Kong. I do not believe it is by chance that Peter Jackson never had Ann Darrow mention Kong's name in the film. It puzzled me while watching the movie why she never referred to the ape by name. The natives called him Kong. The film director, Carl Denhem, referred to him as Kong. But, Ann never says his name.

The humanity with which Kong is imbued in this movie is absolutely astounding. Who but a Peter Jackson whould ever be proud enough to lend such subtle and human traits to a computer animated being? Who but a Peter Jackson could actually succeed in making something so delicate work? After watching this movie twice, I now know why my young friend cried at the end. Kong is used as a metaphor of human traits that are lost as we become adults. I am not speaking of a childlike quality. I am speaking of a transcendent, primordial innocence that we as a species lost thousands of years ago. That wild innocence is seen in Kong and his relationship to Beauty, Ann Darrow. The one word that Kong pantomines to Ann is just that word: ""beauty"". And, in his completely innocent love for Ann, we see a transcendent nature we as humans strive all our lives to regain.

King Kong lends itself to many psychological interpretations because it deals with pure archetypes. Kong is the animal within us all that has been so tamed we have lost an important part of our humanity. Ann Darrow, the Beauty to Kong's Beast, is a representation of all that is worth fighting for in life, all that means something. Again, I feel it is no accident that Ann's gown in the final scenes is pure white, constrasted to Kong's blackness. Just before they meet up for the last time the soundtrack has Peggy Lee singing ""Bye Bye Blackbird."" In Ann and Kong we have the perfect Ying and Yang, the pure blending of the pairs of opposites. And while the iconic line that Beauty killed the Beast is in this update of the story as it was in the original, Man is the real instrument used in killing Kong. And, through what part of Man's accomplishments is the Beast killed? - that proudest achievement of our industrial history: the airplane. Man as Machine. And, even in the almost last scene of the movie is another psychological theme produced. Once Kong slips off the Empire State Building in death, Ann rushes into the arms of her Knight in Shining Armour, Jack Driscoll. Kong becomes the Father-figure that must be killed before the innocent child can become a woman and take unto herself a husband. Pure Freud.

Yes, the special effects in this film are even more spectacular than what Jackson did in The Trilogy of the Rings. The fight scenes are incredible. But, proving that he is more than just a film technician, through the elemental aspects of this story, Jackson proves he is the most intelligent director doing mainstream movies today. I have to admit it: The Lord of the Rings was no fluke. This man and the people he surrounds himself with are the most talented film makers making films today. King Kong is an instant classic in anybody's book.",1148774400,3,4132,4.504
7602500,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Jackson shined in this movie as I expected, never a dull moment. I actually felt for Kong and going into the movie I didn't think I could feel for a cgi (or whatever they use these days) created character like that, but I did. The effects were amazing, Skull Island was actually scary as hell; the cast was perfect, even Jack Black did a great job, he added that touch of comedy that was needed. Another genius film by Jackson, loved it.

And about the time length, people are never happy, you give them a short film and they want a longer one, give them a long film, they still complain. So if you're reading the time length complaints, it's not a problem, you won't even take your eyes off the screen...atleast I didn't.",1148688000,,722,4.388059701492537
7602501,4,B01AHWLX2O,"Everyone over the age of 16 knows the story of King Kong.  It is an icon in pop culture, including children's cartoons.  This movie helps to cement the story in modern mythology by using CGI graphics and fantastic directing.  I loved it except for the few flaws that kept me from giving it five stars.

The central weakness is Jack Black.  He is not believable enough in his role.  This character needs to be darkly comical.  Unfortunately, Jack Black is just too silly an actor to pull it off.  Danny Devito or Jack Nicholson would have worked much better.  Black's performance doesn't ruin the movie, but it is certainly distracting.

Naomi Watts was wonderful, and her performance was enthralling.  Her link to Kong felt genuine.  Her vaudeville athleticism was endearing and added authenticity to her character.

My teenage daughters couldn't watch the original King Kong because it was too silly and dated for them.  The use of CGI and the updated cinematography has made this film a classic.  By the end of the movie all of my daughters were crying, and I was tired.  I couldn't believe how much time I spent watching the movie by the time it was done.  It was only my own exhaustion that told me that, yes, in fact three hours had passed.

7602503,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Everyone knows this story so I will be brief.  1979 version w/ Jessica Lange had a stronger sexual element to the monkey/girl relation, but was very touching nonetheless.  The relation here is more of an 'obsession' with a prized possession to protect, that the gorilla has with the girl, versus some type of purely sexual interest.

I hate to say it, but here goes, fellows, we have all been that ape at one time or another.  You know what Im saying.  So the story is universal in that we can identify with the feelings of the protagonist, even if it is a monkey.

Certain scenes are visually unforgettable.  Such as when Kong escapes the theatre and finally sees the Girl again in NYC, walking smokily down a blue lit street in pitch black winter.  You can see his expression go from fear it won't be her, to calm, and sad acceptance.  Throughout, Kong looks doomed and aware of it, even on the island.  He seems to be an older creature, and tired of the throne, which makes the protector relation to the girl more convincing.

Really, a true classic.  Snubbed at the Oscars, but then LOTR was grossly overpraised, so it evens out.  Do not miss this.",1148342400,,1152,4.507246376811594

7602506,4,B01AHWLX2O,"I didn't really mind the length and thought the plot was pretty well laid out, the casting good too. The movie at just over three hours may have hurt it in this short attention span world but what is there to cut?
I don't know if I've ever seen the original so I can't really compare the two but Jackson's Kong was well written, the sets were great (apparently none of the story really filmed in New York)and most of the computer generated effects were top quality (I did think some of the dinosaurs didn't look quite right). I liked the characterization of Kong as an old, beat up, Gorilla.
I just have a few complaints;
#1 What happened to the natives?, you never see them after they offer Ann up to Kong. All the time the story spends on the island and you learn nothing much about them.
#2 The 'native' part of the island looks almost as fake, sometimes, as I remember the sets looking in the original, most of the story apears to have been shot somewhere real.
#3 Between Kong's capture (even if the ship's crew made their living capturing wild animals why'd they have so many gallons of chloroform- more than enough for Kong even)and the show in New York, where's the story? Not even a line about it except for a bit about Ann not working for Jack Black's character.
#4 Kong's weight and emotions. A 25ft. Gorilla would surely weigh in at 25 tons yet Kong would climb/sit on things as if he weighed a real world gorilla weight. Do real Gorilla's laugh or smile? I didn't mind it but I'm not sure that they do.

7602507,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Director Peter Jackson did a remarkable job in re-making a big-budget KK movie with JURASSIC PARK type special effects.  In doing so, he actually dug out the original script from the 1930s and inserted many scenes that were cut out of the original film as they didn't have the technology to pull it off.

It can be said that one can skip the entire first hour of the film without missing much insofar as KK is concerned.  However, the build-up of suspense does pay off when they finally reach the mysterious island.  Also, there are in the first hour a few nice allusions to Fay Wray as well as RCO productions, which made the original 1930s film.

The island is the centerpiece of the movie.  They spend a lot more time on it than did the 1970s film, and they go ballistic with all the creepy creatures that they create.  The whole premise of the island is rather interesting:  what if there were a locale on the planet that was so isolated from the rest of the world that evolution went bananas in a variety of directions, while some other long-extinct creatures endured, becoming suspended in time?

Naomi Watts proves herself to be worthy of following in the footsteps of Fay Wray and Jessica Lange (I won't mention the farcical KING KONG LIVES starring Linda Hamilton).  The Australian beauty is a great actress who also easily passes for an acrobat.

Any fans of KING KONG must add this to their collection.  While everyone already knows the story (whether they've seen the 1930s original or not), it's still worth watching all over again - and again!",1148169600,3,1557,4.621818181818182
7602508,5,B01AHWLX2O,"The truth is, most people thought of King Kong as a joke. Sure, the original, way back when, was apparently scary to audiences. But today, the clumsy little stop-motion gorilla doesn't have the power to do much with current audiences. Certainly not scare them. The campy 1970s remake -- with the very timely energy crisis subplot --  doesn't really do it for today's audiences either.

Peter Jackson remembered, though, that Kong used to terrify audiences. Lucky us.

The 21st century King Kong not only features an utterly convincing giant gorilla and actual compelling characters and a great Depression-era setting, it also is the scariest dinosaur/giant monster movie to date. The bug scene will send arachnophobes screaming for the door and Kong versus not one, not two, but three tyrannosaurs makes the Jurassic Park series look like a lot of smoke and mirrors. Combined with the best version of Kong's climactic stand-off with the fighter planes, this is easily the best version of the classic story to date.

Unfortunately, this all adds up to a long, long movie. It's worth it, but be prepared for at least one intermission along the way.

I love the music, the editing is top rated. The scene with the dinoaurs is very similair from the original 1930's movie. One scene that I miss that he should have replicated is when Fan Wray screams on the boat but Peter Jackson uses very little of the screaming that Wray did in the orinal movie. It is not nearly as good as the original but being a remake it is not a terrible movie and gets the four stars that it rightly deserves.

This is my main complaint with this film.  It's just too damn long.  Oh, sure, it's often in the name of character development, but I'm not here for character development.  I'm here for giant monkey mayhem!  And dinosaurs!

But in this film, much of the monster action seems almost thrown in as a concession, as if Jackson would much rather get back to people talking or looking dramatically at things instead of dinosaur stampedes and t-rex fights.  Much of the dialoge is painfully heavyhanded, and while the characters are well-defined, they are also re-defined and re-re-defined needlessly.

The action in this Kong failed to hold my attention.  That's beyond comprehension.  Ask anyone who knows me and they'll tell you I can sit and watch giant monsters films all day.  The only sequence that was exceptional in my mind was Kong's fight with three T-rexes.  That was amazing.  The dino stampede: good, not great.  Giant Bugs:  Almost seemed thrown in as an afterthought.  Kong running through the city:  Okay, but pointless.  Kong's final battle:  A foregone conclusion and drained of all suspense.

Of course, some will say I'm just being old school, unwilling to accept this version on principle alone.  They might have a point, but I do know that this Kong was hobbled by a story that was already too familiar and a director who has started to take himself too seriously.  Kong is drained of almost every bit of fun, and wants to impress you with how deep and touching it is.

Jack Black plays a director who must first ""fight him over there so we don't have to fight him over here."" He uses superior technology to dominate the brutal hairy dictator, then brings him before the world court of public opinion, hoping to bask in the limelight as a true hero.

But what is this? The silly monkey doesn't appear to play along. The grand plan for quick victory is torn awry by the easily predicted blowback of a resentful captive.

Jackson proves, however, that in the end it's not high ideals or fitting justice that wins out the day. The simple fact is that if you spray enough bullets into enough flesh, eventually they give up and die.

Some really neet story lines and subplots.  What bothered me the most about this movie was the cheesy lines and drawn out scenes.  It's like Peter Jackson was trying to make some kind of epic by having the drawn out slow moving sceens.  He failed.  This movie is cgi and computer 3d heavy; and this work is high end but not edited so well.  The real kicker for me was at the end.

Spiritually faithful to the original, Jackson has done an absolutely amazing job here, contrary to what is said by those who just have to contrary.  I just wish he hadn't somewhat cheapend the effect with typical hollywood pc elements (the black guy is way-cool, guns are evil, capitalists are evil, etc.) only to blow his own politics out of the water moments later (in true B-movie fashion, the black guy bites the big one once again; moments after using a machinegun to save his life, the young crew member throws it away in disgust only to be rescued by the big macho movie star swinging on a vine and blasting everything in sight) although to be fair, that last capitalist bit did lend itself to some good moments.  This aspect of the film will probably give it a rather cheap, dated look someday.  However, they can't detract from the overall experience of the movie.

Jackson doesn't mind combining good acting by good actors with an interesting premise and a load of special effects fun.

If anything I wish there was more of this. Big segments are missed out. Like how did Kong get transported to NY? I also couldn't help but wonder about the incredible discoveries made on the island and how that would've rocked the world. Dinosaurs alive! Giant insects! An undiscovered race of aboriginal people! Any of these things would - if they really happened - be earth-shaking events. Considering this it seems a bit silly that the best Carl Denham can do is stage a show we're he displays a chained up Kong. In truth, if it's wealth he's after there would be a whole host of ways to turn the discovery into a fortune. The possibilities make displaying Kong seem like a sideshow that wouldn't even be worth the effort. Jackson deals with all this by asking us not to think about. He just fast forwards from the island to the big night in NY and keeps the engines revved up.

And, honestly, I'm not complaining. I enjoyed this more than any film of it's type since Jurassic Park. It's a tribute to the filmmaker that I wish there was a super-extended DVD version.

Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" contains a giant, 2-story gorilla, large man-eating worms, AND DINOSAURS!!.  Normally, after seeing such things in a film, ones 'suspension of disbelief' should have been asked to leave the theater.

I must say that I was prepared for this insanely long movie and I didn't find it dragging at all! I took a quick break in the middle to run to bathroom and grab another beer with boyfriend but the 3 hours flew by! I was sucked into the story and since there was always something insane going on I had no time to be bored, scout's honor!

My favorite part was the sweet love story between Ann Darrow ( Watts) and the colossal Ape. I felt the connection this gigantic beast had with her  even though she was human and he was this big strong animal as  they became instant friends who shared naps and laughs. It was very touching watching their friendship develop as a rescue team from the ship had to battle giant bugs, beetles, spiders, dinosaurs and savages to bring her back to safety.

I admit, I cried a bit a few times, but I'm a huge sucker for animals and this movie had some sweet tender moments. I was absolutely enchanted by Kong, and his devotion to Ann, as he fought off a few huge T-Rexes and saved her. His had this strong bond with this woman who had no one to love her and she made him laugh by dancing for him and for bringing this sweet look into his eyes. He was more than a killer, he was this sudden soft creature that found her beautiful. I swear I saw his brain working behind all the looks he gave her, and the move did a stupendous job of making him real. I didn't once this that this movie looked like a computer movie because everything looked touchingly real.

This movie is a real feast on the eyes as the tight escapes, especially when the crew men had to run from the brachiosauruses and velociraptors on the mountain slopes, I couldn't even believe what I was seeing! I kept saying to my boyfriend ""Can you believe this?? Its insane, this movie is crazy!"" I felt like my wildest jungle fantasy movie scenes were right in front of my face as the movie progressed.

Truly a spectacular, yet bit sad but powerful story. King Kong won me over, as this sweet loving giant, who kept reminding us that love and compassion come in all forms.",1147478400,3,2360,4.266219239373601
7602524,1,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson has gone from talented visionary to presumptuous director with this pile of gorilla dung.  The only thing good about this movie was the acting.  This movie was overblown, over the top and reached new depths of eye rolling.  I never thought that action could be so boring.  I (a wanna be artist) never would have guessed that I (also a fan of directorial artistic freedom) could make the following statement...  A producer that could have reined Jackson in a bit would have only benefitted this picture.  This film was an extension of the problems that surfaced in the vastly superior Lord of the Rings (few, but they were there and more prevalent as the trilogy went on).  This film was also a victim of the LotR success. It never seemed to finds it's rhythm with me and never could figure out what it wanted to be.  I also think it's incredibly pretentious to hear so many people praise the great character development in this film, as if time was all that is needed to ""properly"" develop characters.  Sorry, there are many movies that do as well of a job at character development in much less time.  Another reviewer wrote that this film was not as good as the sum of it's parts.  Aptly put because the film is filled with fantastic scenes, unfortunately it's filled with just as many over the top scenes.  This movie did not live up to expectations at the Box Office, 51st overall currently at IMDB in total US with approx. $218mil, while seemingly respectable were not good considering the $200mil this movie cost to make.  Obviously not everyone could have enjoyed it.  Or is it that they simply didn't bother?  For my money, I'm still sticking with the original, it's still the archetype of action/adventure movies as cinematic art.  Jackson's version was just too much to stomach and I think it was a presumptuous imitation of the original by an otherwise talented director.",1147392000,9,1895,4.696969696969697
7602525,4,B01AHWLX2O,"At first I wondered, ""Why remake King Kong again?"" It's been done several times and never very well (did you see the stinker version with Jessica Lange?). Even though the original 1931 version used stop animation filming for Kong and was in black and white and had cinema's early sound, it is still unquestionably the benchmark version. Even Jackson concedes that. Jackson is humble enough to not have wanted to surpass the original, but rather put forth his own version and have it be judged on its own merits.

I didn't want to like this film. I really didn't. But I do. It's awesome!

Jackson and his talented actors and crew have created a masterpiece of a film that fully engages the viewer. Even though you know what is going to happen if you've ever seen the original, you will be on pins and needles during some of the action sequences.

So realistic is Kong that you fully expect him to really exist. I understand that Andy Serkis ""played"" Kong and the gorilla was then animated based on Serkis' movements. Brilliant, simply brilliant!

Naomi Watts is simply marvelous in her Fay Wray role. She brings life and innocence to what could have been an unforgiving role opposite Kong's upstaging. And yet, their scenes together are some of the most brilliant in the film as she and Kong truly seem to connect. My hat is off to Watts (and Serkis if he was participating during the shooting of the scenes together) and Jackson for this ability.

There's no need to rehash the storyline - we all know it.

The cast of actors are all memorable and well cast. I particularly liked Jamie Bell's portrayal of a stowaway-cum-deck hand role and Jack Black (whom I don't usually like) as a scoundrel of a film producer/director.

There are two action sequences during which I was literally holding my breath. One features Kong, Watts, and three huge Allosaurs. Another features the crew of the ship and hundreds of giant size creepy crawlies (if you are bothered by bugs, you'll go insane during this scene).

This is good stuff folks. Get this film!",1147305600,6,2044,4.689944134078212
7602526,4,B01AHWLX2O,"For the most part, Peter Jackson's King Kong is a fantastic thrill ride. The action sequences on Skull Island are some of the best I've ever seen, particularly the Kong Vs. T-Rex battle. Also, the scenes of Kong in New York are great. Naomi Watts really makes you believe that she's acting with an actual ape and she has some affection for him in spite of the circumstances. (I especially like Kong and her ""skating"" in Central Park.)

But Peter...

That first hour...

Goes....

So...

SLOWLY!

Bogged down in exposition we don't need about Carl Denham and Screenwriter Jack and the other actors in Carl's movie and the expendable sailors...

The original movie spent about 15 minutes on ship before finding Kong.

GET TO THE ISLAND ALREADY!!

So, even though the DVD doesn't give you the full cinematic experience, it is an improvement on the movie as you can zip past the dull first hour and get right onto the island.

One other thing. I was hoping that Peter Jackson would tell us how in the world they got Kong _back_ to New York in the first place. How did they get him on board? What did they restrain him with? Did they just gas him up the whole time? An hour ont he Jack & Anne drippy romance, but not five minutes on this?",1147046400,,1233,4.44
7602527,5,B01AHWLX2O,"If film-maker Carl Denham - - as played by Jack Black - - were to remake KING KONG, it would likely be very much like Peter Jackson's version starring Jack Black himself:  Unnecessarily long, overstuffed with Thrilling Action Scenes, and totally unbelievable (as distinguished from totally incredible).  Black's attempts to carry over his nudge-nudge wink-wink arch persona from say, SCHOOL OF ROCK, fall as flat as if trudged upon by the Great Ape himself.  He plays essentially the same character here he always does (which is to say he isn't acting at all, really).  And it's completely misplaced.  And I know this is strictly fantasy, but after all that poor old Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) goes through, you would think she would, at the very least, lose at the very least one of her shoes.  Or something.  Maybe a broken neck or two.  Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS managed to sustain its awesomness over the course of its three lengthy parts; KING KONG has woefully little to be remembered for after the course of its three interminable hours.  It isn't that the acting is particularly poor (but if you don't like Jack Black, avoid as this is actually KING KONG STARRING JACK BLACK).  It isn't that the special effects aren't particularly special.  I guess it's just a matter of overkill and oversaturation.  If you've seen LOTR or JURASSIC PARK or - - heck, the original KING KONG - - this version is just tiresome.  Many of the best scenes happen to be the quietest, actually, as if by accident the film isn't trying to call attention to itself.  Imagine that.",1147046400,2,1563,4.7407407407407405
7602528,1,B01AHWLX2O,"For anyone who grew up watching the original King Kong, Peter Jackson's remake is especially disappointing. It is far less realistic or exciting than the original. While the original producers knew how to make a compelling hour and a half long film, Jackson clearly has no idea how to do that in a three hour long flick where he does not have a lengthy novel to serve as his literary guide.

After a promising beginning, Jackson's film starts to go south when we arrive at Skull Island. This movie has much more action and adventure on Skull Island than did the original. This movie has at least five major action sequences on Skull Island. These scenes have some fun value, but due to Jackson's use fo fuzzily photographed, slow-motion scenes, they are not as much fun as they could have been.

An especially disappointing aspect of Jackson's version is that his three lead actors are able to repeatedly survive falling into ravines, numerous waves of attacking monsters and a dinosaur stampede without suffering even so much as a single injury. The remainder of the ship's crew perish, but the impossibility of the three lead actors being able to survive and thrive under those circumstances is a massive violation of the suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoying a film such as this.

Fundamentally, King Kong is not an action flick but rather a love story between the great ape and the beautiful blonde. This aspect of Jackson's film is poorly handled and gets pretty sappy.

Basically, fans of the original King Kong are well advised to leave this one alone.",1147046400,37,1567,4.814126394052044

7602530,4,B01AHWLX2O,"The task was to remake the original 1933 King Kong! This monumental undertaking was to update this film to today's standards and viewing habits. The one director pegged for this undertaking was the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy director Peter Jackson. This three time Academy Award (LOTR) winner was also a big fan of the original. So in a nutshell he had an unlimited budget. (Cost to make was $250 million)

Naomi Watts (Ann Darrow) portrays her character with vitality and vigor. Adrien Brody (Jack Driscoll) and Jack Black (Carl Denham) play supporting roles to Watts and Kong. But Kong (Andy Serkis) steals the show (which he should) and falls for the vitality of Ann Darrow.

The special effects make this film come alive with real life feel for that 1930's era. The sound and sound editing cannot be disputed for receiving Academy Awards. Kong's movement and expressions truly characterized Peter Jackson's attention to detail. And I was unexpectedly surprised by the Skull island inhabitants. They are not your ordinary, friendly type original movie islanders. All I can say is that they are very scary.

I truly enjoyed this version of ""King Kong."" Peter Jackson has honed his film making skills. And is becoming a must see for any film that he touches. I recommend purchasing the two disc widescreen version. The second disc contains the ""Post Production Diaries"", ""Skull Island: A Natural History"" and ""Kong's New York, 1933.""

7602531,4,B01AHWLX2O,"This film could have been a contender for movie greatdom, but slips up with miscasting of the two male leads, and a sappy overplay of the inter-species love story that suggests that Anne Darrow (Naomi Watts) is seriously kinky.  No doubt she needed years of therapy after the monkey took the dive.

The Skull Island sequences of this classic, ""which is not just an adventure film,"" were brilliant, and the overall approach to and reworking of the original film was very successful.  The movie appears to be full of ""insider"" cinephile jokes - especially the Jack Black charachter's send up of Orson Welles (including mugging with a pipe), and the probably deliberate parody of the (equally sappy) death of the character Jack's death as he slips into the ocean at the end of the film ""Titanic.""  Also note some humorous re-use of the original film's dialogue as ""Carl Denham"" shoots scenes from his film.  I suspect that there are many other such hidden jokes in KK.

7602533,1,B01AHWLX2O,"I guess I'm kind of picky: I like movies that are entertaining. This one has so many faults that I was relieved when it ended. One of those faults is that it took over three hours to end this abomination of a movie. I'll just list out some of the other problems with this movie:

1. Editing - Every scene in a movie should contribute something to the plot or character development. Too many scenes in King Kong were just there as gratuitous action without adding anything to the plot or characters. And the viewer's response is, ""Here we go again, the characters are going to fight mudpeople, dinosaurs, bugs, Kong, etc...."" Peter Jackson really needed a strong-minded editor to edit out about half of this movie. Then the editor should have burned whatever was left.
2. Poor special effects - In this age of amazing CGI effects, there is no excuse for unbelievable visuals in a movie, especially one with a large budget and a well-known director. The effects in King Kong are so bad that you can see the outline of the actors against the greenscreen. It makes it really hard to watch an action scene when the viewer can see a visual difference between the actors and the effects. One might expect them to integrate the effects better with the actors.
3. Poorly thought out action scenes - One of the scenes with the bad CGI/Actor integration issues involved the characters running through a brontosaurus stampede. Those Brontosauri were practically stepping on the actors, yet no one got so much as a little bruise from the experience. They should have been squashed like bugs. Although, that might be wishful thinking. In another scene, Kong is fighting off several T-Rexes while carrying Ann Darrow, the female lead character, in his hands like a Barbie Doll. The scene goes on and on, with Kong tossing Darrow from hand to hand while he's swatting the T-Rexes, and then running, ape-style, with his knuckles often hitting the ground for balance and traction. If Darrow were really in his hand when it hit the ground, she would have been completely crushed. But, at the end of this drawn-out fight scene, her dress wasn't even torn. Granted, this is a sci-fi/fantasy movie, but one would expect some of the physical laws of the universe to hold true.
4. Continuity issues - First there were the mudpeople, whose tribe suddenly dropped off the face of the planet about mid-way through the movie. Did the director forget about them, as if they were some kind of disposable plot device, useful only so long as they presented an obstacle to the main characters? And then there's the issue of transporting Kong. By the time the explorers/film-makers got to Skull Island, their boat had taken such a beating that it was barely floating. And the boat appeared to be smaller than King Kong. Peter Jackson expects us to believe that these resourseful folks somehow managed to get the oversized ape onto this too-small boat. And, how did they get him from the shore to the boat? All they had was one small dinghy that was barely big enough for the landing party. Then, we are to believe that this non-seaworthy boat got the big ape back to New York. Hmmm... no wonder the director chose not to include the boat-ride home in this movie. That's the one scene he managed to edit out of King Kong.

Don't bother seeing thim movie unless you're interested in how bad a big-budget movie can be.",1146700800,24,3381,4.680672268907563
7602534,3,B01AHWLX2O,"When Peter Jackson announced that Jack Black would play the lead in King Kong I was absolutely mystified. Supposedly a funnyman, Black's schtick consists of raising his eyebrows and talking in an overly sarcastic manner. There's no material, just him being a jerk.

He can't act. Period. For most of the movie he's an anachronism, 21st century Jack Black playing himself in a movie set during the Depression. When the ship's captain compares him to a cockroach Black's response sounds like a line from an SNL sketch, not from a character in a period movie.

His performance, for lack of a better word, distracts from what is one of the most astounding visual achievements in cinematic history. The computer generated Kong is totally realistic. The ""love story"" between Kong and Ann Darrow is sweet and believable. Naomi Watts is luminous and heartbreaking, quite a feat considering most of her performance was done in front of a bluescreen with no giant ape anywhere nearby.

The brontosaurus scene is astonishing for its sheer audacity. The idea of having them stampede and pile up is just plain crazy, but they pulled it off.

The T-rex scene is one of the great action sequences in history. Again, what audacity -- not one but three!

The movie is a bit long, but that's a minor quibble. This film would be an unqualified masterpiece were it not for the woefully miscast Black.",1146700800,,1380,4.830508474576271

So I'd give most of the the film a half hearted three but the love between the two of them a five.

But I did it, like a souless drone I marched to the video store, paid my dues and suffered for over two hours until FINALLY they put that poor beast, and ME out of our misery.

Two quick points:

1. Special Effects and action should support a plot -  a plot should not be scribbled around effects and action sequences, which I am sure happened here.

2. Action flicks can have a great story - there seems to be this trend in Hollywood toward producing action or adventure films with absolutely no attempt to stimulate the mind.  This movie is the perfect example - while my eyes bugged out of my head at times at the marvellous work of special effects, not once did I feel drawn to suspense or long to know more.  Instead I patiently waited for the movie to end like an idiot.

my major complaint:  the characterizations of the players didn't work for me.  why did they play the captain as dark, mysterious and scary?  for that matter, why was he suprised to find the chloroform on the ship? it's his ship! where did Jimmy come from?  why was he supposedly ""more wild than half the animals down here""?  was he from skull island? offspring of some unholy union with one the the natives?  And Jack Black's Denham:  was he the comic relief?  was he the villain?  after all, he's the one who kept trying to make the movie no matter how many crewmembers were eaten, squashed, or mutilated by natives!  By the end of the flick we're meant to root for kong, and Denham is the one who ultimately is responsible for getting kong killed.. and he (denham) lives and in fact has the last line in the flick.  i don't get it.  The only relationship that made any sense to me in this flick is that of Kong and Anne.

 and what was with all the sweeping swooping camera moves?  remember when Driscall types 'Skull Island' onto his typewriter and the camera goes all wonky.. wha?  the more i think about it the more this film reeks.  but whatever.  Thank god there was no 'I love you' seen between Anne and Kong'

Yes, it is wonderful to watch Naomi Watts - beautiful and talented. But Adrian Brody is one of the most unattractive males in leading roles today. The ""mud people"" of Skull Island are also particularly unattractive.

The stampede of dinosaurs is extremely well done, but could easily have been more effective if the time was cut in half. Yes, the kids will love it, but it slows the story needlessly.

There is also too much footage of Miss Watts entertaining Kong and his reactions to her antics. It becomes a case of ""let's get on with the story"".

The raw trerror and power that Kong exudes. The jaw dropping dangers of the prehistroric Island. Jack Black's ambitious, manipulative movie producer is perfect.

Alas, there are weaknesses as well. (Spoiler alerts): Kong battles large T-Rex style dinosaurs, as he holds Ann in alternative hand and foot grabs. C'mon... the woman would be inadvertently crushed during such a combat! How much more believable would it had been, to have Kong tuck Ann in some safe hiding place.

The woman has the luck of Indiana Jones, escaping death about a thousand times.

The movie has far too many ""tortured close- ups"" of Naomi Watts and crew.

Many of the tender scenes involving Ann and Kong are masterful. But PLEASE, PLEASE... why the scene of Kong repeatedly sliding around on ice, in Central Park? He's being playful, Ann is laughing for some odd reason... has she forgotten that her large hairy friend is in mortal danger? (As are any hapless humans who get in Kong's way!) I could had accepted the scene, if Ann maintained her concern for Kong and prompted him to keep moving.

The climax at the Empire State Building is very well done, but too tortured. It ran about five minutes longer than it should of, with far too many ""cry with Ann"" scenes.  Too much of a good thing isn't necessarily good. Sometimes less is more!

The same is true about directors who remake their favorite films. Once the mystery is gone and the essence has been altered to suit their needs, there's nothing left of the legend. That's the case with Peter Jackson's big-budgeted, over-hyped, over-long remake of the 1933 immortal classic ""King Kong"". Too much is revealed, too much has been altered. What was once a brief, frightening excursion into the realm of horror has become a sentimentalized pretension; a lofty fantasy that cannot possibly hope to live up to its namesake. As is the case with many of todays remakes, if this film had been a separate entity, it would have worked extraordinarily well. Take away the fumbled, boring ending in New York and focus the entire feature on the island and its many wonderous inhabitants. Find a message about leaving the last remaining untouched mysteries of the world alone and convert this from a tiresome remake into a new work of art. What saddens me is that this mess came from a director whose legend precedes him. The epic scope of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy was breathtaking and inspired awe. The epic scope of ""King Kong"" left me yawning and looking at my watch. That's the way it is for those of us ""pre-millenium"" horror enthusiasts. Nowadays, if you don't have outrageous special effects and innumerable plot points per film, the audience won't pay attention. These ""post-millenium"" movie goers have been tarnished by the simple fact that they don't have to rely on their imaginations anymore to have a good time.

It really is amazing how spectacularly they were able to achieve the feeling of newness from one of the classics.

Aside from the special effects team, the only other star that truly shines is Naomi Watts.  Watts manages to convey all sorts of emotions, evoking real care and sympathy from the audience.  The viewer wants - at least I did - King Kong to survive, just so the love doesn't die.  Watts really pulls it off; she is magnificent.

The early scenes from New York, the shots from Skull Island's fortress, and the amazing wildlife soon thereafter were all a testament to the special-effects team (although the Kong vs. 3 T-Rex fight reminded me of the choreography of the Hulk vs. the 3 mutant dogs in the most recent Hulk movie); I was in awe at the realism.

The final scene, which makes this a sad story, is tragic and epic at the same time.  The battle between Kong and the airplanes, flying by and gunning mercilessly, reminds of an earlier battle that Kong had with some strange winged beasts, is set atop the Empire State Building, where Kong lives his final moments of life.  Even to the end, Kong's pureness and beauty shines through, protecting Watts until his death.  It's emotional, classic, and one of the best movie endings ever.

I love this remake more than the original black and white version, simply brilliant.",1146182400,2,1530,4.625925925925926

The bugs, dinosaurs, and weird evil natives were as overdone as burnt toast that sets off the smoke alarm. There were too few scenes that would give the movie any positive spin. You know bad guys smashed or something. The point of the movie according to Mr. Jackson was that bugs, people, and dinosaurs are evil and that KK is an overgrown primate trapped in world that tortures him daily and finally kills him.

The makeup and special effects are top rate, even haunting at times; giant man-eating insects and really eerie looking natives. Probably a little more than the average under 12 year old needs to see. The dinosaur stampede was a little hard to believe though, well done but hardly survivable. We're talking smash-city for everyone involved! Very touching at times, this Kong probably garners more sympathy than previous screen Kongs, and the New York scenes will keep you guessing; ""how'd they do that?"" Especially when you consider it was shot largely in New Zealand. Very well done, but not quite the box office runaway that was expected.",1146182400,2,761,4.953125
7602549,4,B01AHWLX2O,"Loud, expensive, computer-generated ""event"" movies do little for this viewer, but Peter Jackson's twenty-first century remake of the 1933 ""King Kong"" sets this movie apart from the rest of its peers. The 1933 classic had crude special effects and even a vaguely racist undercurrent, but Jackson's signature touch could very well make this ""Kong"" the definitive version. You know the story: a filmmaker desperate for a hit (Jack Black) recruits a struggling up-and-coming actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) to star in what he hopes will be his blockbuster smash movie. He tricks her and screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) into jumping on a ship to Skull Island where they badly clash with the natives who capture Ann and offer her as a sacrifice to Kong: an enormous 25-foot gorilla. Surprisingly, Kong bonds with Ann, while a frantic search is made to find her while fighting off dinasoars, abnormally large insects, and other creatures. Jackson piles on the action relentlessly, and the special effects are nothing short of thrilling. Kong himself, generated from computer graphics and modeled after actor Andy Serkis, looks amazingly real, quite unlike the cardboard image of the 1933 original. But while this version towers over the 1976 remake, a couple scenes aren't quite believable, such as the moment where the crew frantically races with a pack of dinasoars and end up unharmed. Sorry, I didn't buy it. Other than that, this ""Kong"" is very much worth your time. It packs a wild punch and it deserved its three technical Oscars.",1146182400,2,1541,5.094861660079052
7602550,3,B01AHWLX2O,"..but perhaps I am setting my standards too high. After the FANTASTIC Lord Of The Rings movies, I guess I figured Peter Jackson could do no wrong. And make no mistake, his King Kong remake is not a bad movie at all... but it certainly isn't great.
  Part of the problem is the original. The original's storyline seems too perfect in comparison. Whenever Jackson's film deviated from the original's storyline, I found myself thinking that the remake was a weaker film storywise because of it. And its not just because I like the original, the 1976 Jessica Lang remake deviated from the original, and it actually had some improved moments (although the 1976 version is not a very good movie over all).
  A major complaint I have with Jackson's film is it is TOO LONG. Not that 3+ hours is too long, but when 40 minutes of the film is absolutely NOTHING but padding, just meaningless FLUFF, what's the point of having it in the movie? Obviously, Jackson was wallowing in his joy at getting to make his King Kong, and all that padding seriously effects the flow of the movie. Had 40 minutes been trimmed, the film would be better.
  I also must say there is FAR too much emphasis on the effects in this film. There is a particular sequence involving stampeding dinosaurs which was WAY too long, rather stupid, and apparently was included just so Jackson could say 'Look what we can do!'. A very weak and pointless sequence in the movie. In addition, the fight scenes that Kong is involved in are REALLY unrealistic and badly choreographed.
  A further complaint (although this one is minor), is that Kong's first appearance onscreen has no suspense buildup, no shock value to seeing this HUGE gorilla. The 1976 version did a great job with this, and I guess I expected at least as good a moment from Peter Jackson. Also, the ending wasn't handled all that greatly, athough it was passable. Jack Black's delivery of the famous last line in the movie was TERRIBLE however, and way off base.
  Well, that's enough complaining, here are some good things about the movie! Kong looks great in the film, although it does take some getting used to. After all, THIS Kong looks like a REAL gorilla, not a man in a monkey suit like all previous Kongs.
The acting is generally very good, and the sets look fantastic (the minimalist Skull Island looks exactly like you can imagine it would if it existed in the real world). There are some truly touching moments in this film between Naomi Watts and Kong- hard to believe from a CGI gorilla, but its true. Finally, the story stays quite true to the classic original, which is a good thing.
  All in all, Peter Jackson's remake is a good film, but I really expected more. With all the time and money spent on this, plus the considerable talents of Jackson and his crew, I expected a movie on the level of Lord Of The Rings. Sadly this was not the case. While I recommend everyone see Jackson's film just because of the enormity of the project, don't view it with expectations of exceeding the original- you will most likely be VERY disappointed (like I was). I think I'll stick with the original Kong.",1146096000,6,3132,4.593189964157706

For some reason I had just assumed (as in, ass out of you and me) this movie would be stuck somewhere between Mighty Joe Young and Jurassic Park: The Lost World - or - nice ape visuals with vague characters and action sequences. So wrong. I loved almost every minute of this movie. At its heart, I found genuine feeling and was actually touched. To nit pick over some character development issues, some strained chemistry elements, or any of my standard qualms is definitely not seeing the forest because of the trees.

7602554,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Hey! Stop comparing this and the first 'King Kong' movie (as for the 70's version is out of context - and ready to be forgotten). The first 'King Kong' is a classic. Is untouchable. See this new version as... a New movie, if like there was no Kong in movie history.

The reviewer Paully said this film is 'technically well done - like the 'Star Wars' movies...' (I think he talk about the newer Episodes, I, II and III) BUT the new 'Star Wars' (and, let's be realistic, the old ones) lacks a good screenplay, lacks good interpretations (though they all have great actors!) and MOST OF ALL, lacks a great director, like Peter Jackson. Period.

As for the movie I think is really amazing. I thank Peter for - this time - get into a marvellous and extravagant movie with so-realistic unrealistic inhabitants and fabulous jungles - Skull Island and New York.

And - my opinion only - the special effects are the MOST incredible that I've seen so far. I really was amazed and touched by the beauty and by the beast.

I heard someone saying that Kong is a CGI character?! Don't believe!",1145923200,5,1080,4.494897959183674
7602555,3,B01AHWLX2O,"There is a lot to be said about King and about Kong. I like Stephen King a lot, but unfortunately, the film is not based on one of his stories. About Kong: one of my first movie experiences was watching Kong in the backroom of a Northern Bavarian restaurant, in a special Sunday afternoon 16mm kids' screening. Only the second half, though, so all the rubbish about explaining why anybody would go to this island in the first place was left out. (this was the 1980s version, by the way). The monkey was allright, however, I have to defend it against all these nasty reviewers who refuse to loose a good word about this version.

Matter-of-fact, in 1985, there was a reason to remake King Kong. In 2005, admittedly, there was not. Fortunately, most of the tales about production costs is an outright lie, of course, because every child can see that 76 per cent of the film is just a director's cut of Lord of the Rings and Jurassic Parc and Evolution and some of the realted BBC material. The rest is not very good, but a nice distraction on a Sunday afternoon. And most of it is very loud, too, so you can try the settings of your hearing aid, if you had one. If not, you will need one.

Now the objectively reviewing part: the airfight at the end really made me dizzy, so I guess it was well directed. Unfortunately, the monkey dies at the end (I really crossed my fingers for him, but I had tried that before when watching ""Titanic"" and to no avail, so I was not too surprised). I hope that there is KingKong II - The Curse of the Were-Monkey, or that maybe they let Terry Gilliam direct it.

7602556,3,B01AHWLX2O,"When the movie King Kong first starts off, I found myself mesmerized by sets, intrigued with the dialogue, and wondering if the casting and directing could keep up such great momentum.  The answer is NO!

The first part of this film is so fantastic that I have recommended people only watch the first half and then just pull the DVD from the player.

Now don't get me wrong.  I don't think this film was a complete flop.  It is just a bit overrated, in my OPINION.

Being tossed around by a giant gorilla can not be an easy job, yet Naomi Watts (as Ann Darrow) pulls it off brilliantly.  Her performance throughout the entire film is truly amazing and worth praise.

Jack Black is also brilliant in the first half of this film, too.

The second half of this film, starting with the dinosaurs are scared and running scene and ending with the most boring finish to a thriller (yeah, sure, it's suppose to be a love story - whatever) movie ever shot, is such a complete letdown that I would never actually purchase the DVD.

Peter Jackson directed the most incredible trilogy ever - ""The Lord of the Rings.""  That doesn't make him invincible.  This film proves that.  The second half of King Kong is nothing but a computer animated ""Fear Factor"" episode with an extremely boring ending that lacked any suspense, interesting dialogue, or creative input.

It really is a shame.  This film could have been so much more.

7602557,5,B01AHWLX2O,"... terrible movies the year it was released, Peter Jackson's King Kong showed every other movie director how to make a quality product. Entertaining through and through, this King Kong is a great update of a Hollywood classic like everyone is saying. But it's more than that.

There is a scene where Kong is standing in a valley of skeletons - other members of his own species which have fallen vcictim to either the island's other predators or to time itself. It's a simple and beautiful scene, and shows Kong's strength as a survivor, while at the same time revealing his own sadness. The fact that this kind of pity can emanate from a CGI creation is tribute to PJ and to the actor playing Kong (the same actor who gave Gollum life in LOTR.)

I kept thinking of that scene when I watched Kong trying to cope with the new jungle he was taken to. Our jungle of New York circa Great Depresseion. Just as dangerous, with cars instead of dinosaurs and planes instead of bats. And the predator known as the human race.

I can't wait for Peter Jackson to start making other, more serious movies like historical epics or great dramas (without big apes). Not only do I think he'll do a better job than someone like Ridley Scott, but his two main talents, for visuals and inspiring emotion, will definitely be put to great use.",1145836800,5,1321,4.518828451882845
7602558,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Though I'll always have a special place in my nostalgic heart for the black and white version, this re-make is excellent! Though this screenplay sometimes risked going 'over the top' with the action scenes between people and various creatures, I loved it. Worth watching over and over. The fact that they've come so far in special effects helped add to the immense impact of this movie. Also, having the characters in color helps one see the facial expressions of the actors, and the facial expressions and emotions shown through the eyes increases the intensity and enhances the bond between 'beauty and beast'. Oustanding, excellent...and a special bravo for Jack Black who played his character with great concentration and flare.

7602559,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson is probably my second favorite director of all time, George Lucas is in first and Mel Gibson is in third. I never saw King Kong the first film, and from what my mom says, it was annoying. The overall film was good but the girl would not stop screaming. When I learned of King Kong being remade AGAIN, by Peter Jackson I was not that interested, but thanks to all those movie trailers, even though I only saw one trailer, they just make you want to watch the movie.

I did not even know much about King Kong except that it was an old movie where there is a huge gorilla, and it stands on top of the Empire State Building. I did not know where he came from or anything else.

When I finally got into a King Kong (Peter Jackson) hype, I went out and saw it. I went with my brother and a few other relatives. My cousin asked how long the movie was and I said, ""Three hours."" Most of the people groaned, just because it was so long. When people groan about it being three hours I say, ""Hey, it's a Peter Jackson film, what do you expect."" My friend says that the whole first hour of the film is just a waste of time, I do not know what he is talking about because that first hour is as good as the second and third.

I find King Kong divided into three parts. The first hour or so gives you the feeling of what is going on at the present time, and it takes you from the begining to Skull Island. The second hour is all that action on Skull Island, and by the time Kong is captured you will feel like the movie is over but there is still the final hour where Kong fights for his life running from the army and the air force, which is the third hour. Since the film is divided into three parts I will put the reviewing to three parts.

New York-1933. It is year two of the Great Depression, and the opening scenes will really show you what is going on in such a simple way. I really like the first thing that you see, monkeys. When I saw the monkeys I figured I would hear some narrator talk about how monkey have been around for so many years and blah, blah, blah, but it didn't. The opening music kind of adds some comedy to the situation, a song is playing called, ""I'm sitting on top of the world."" You get to learn two of the main characters really quick. The Kong captive Ann Darrow, and the filmaker Carl Denham. Carl Denahm, a movie director, is about to lose his current film which changed location to an island, or what he calls, ""Singapore."" After the location of the film was changed to ""Singapore"" the producing company decided to kill his film so he runs off with the film stealing from the company. It turns out his leading female actress decided to quit acting in the film because she found out that it was in ""Singapore."" So Carl goes out and finds a starving theater actor by the name of Ann Darrow. Carl hires her and she agrees to go to ""Singapore,"" though she does not know what ""Singapore"" really is. By the time everyone is on the boat and leaving for ""Singapore,"" we are about a half-hour in, and the next half shows you more characters, and you travel for days. And then you hit it, Skull Island.

Part two-Skull Island-If you have seen the first Kong you know what happens to Ann, she gets sacraficed to King Kong or as the natives call it, ""Tori Kong."" And once you see him, after waiting for a whole hour, your eyes widen and think to yourself, ""Woah."" Woah, is right. And for the next hour there is the wild goose chase, you get to see Kong's emotional side, especially in the amazing visuals on his face. You see him wrestle a whole family of V-Rex's, yes V-Rex's, not T, but V. I find that almost every creature on Skull Island is an enhanced version of the ones we see every day. There is the gross bug scene, which I really dislike the slugs, and when I saw it in theater my stomach churned at a characters death just because it was so gross. There is a good amount of comedy on every part of the film too.

Part three-Kong's Fate-You should know what happens from here, and Kong's death is really dragged out from this point, but this really makes you wish that they would leave Kong alone. You could possibly be on the verge of tears by the time he gets near death, because he never did anything. And once agian because of the fantastic visuals you can really see how much pain Kong goes through. By the end of the film, if you think back at the begining you might remember a line that fits with the ending and possibly with today's society, Ann Darrow says, ""Good things never last Mr. Denham.""

Peter Jackson has created such a masterpiece, that you will love this film from start to finish, this version I hope is better than the first version.",1145750400,4,4689,4.2207357859531776
7602560,5,B01AHWLX2O,"King Kong is one of the best movies of 2005 as Peter Jackson gives an excellent follow-up to his wildly successful Lord of the Rings series. This movie takes full advantage of special effects and other technology to bring Kong to life as well as some other creatures. With excellent lead performances and beautiful scenery and shots, King Kong is a needed remake of the 1933 classic.

Naomi Watts is outstanding as Ann Darrow, a struggling actress who accepts the lead role in Carl Denham's new picture. Denham, played by Jack Black, is also struggling in the movie business. When Ann accepts the role ""she was born to play"", the two set off with screenplay writer Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) to Skull Island, an undiscovered island that supposedly holds primitive life, where Denham wants to shoot his film. When they reach Skull Island, the crew is immediately confronted by natives, who capture Ann and take her to be sacrificed to a monster that lives on the other side of a stone wall built along the edge of the native civilization. When Ann is taken by Kong, Jack Driscoll plays the unlikely hero trying to save her, while Denham sees a scheme to make money out of the venture after all.

Watts does an excellent job with the whole aspect of fearing Kong and attempting to make sure he doesn't eat her by various methods. The two form a surprisingly close bond. Unlike the 1933 film, the attraction is not just from Kong, it is mutual. Andy Serkis, who used motion capture technology to play Gollum in the Lord of the Rings, makes another excellent performance playing Kong. He captures the ape's emotions wonderfully, especially when he laughs at Ann's Vaudeville routine.

This film is one of the most beautifully shot films I have ever seen. 1933 New York City has never looked this good, especially the view from atop the Empire State Building. These beautiful shots are completed by surprisingly moving moments, like when Kong and Ann watch a sunset from a high cliff, or when they share their final moment together on the Empire State Building, where Kong is trying to protect her from her own species. The end is heartbreaking, with Naomi Watts playing the best few minutes of running time in her career.

Peter Jackson does an excellent job bringing  Kong to life in this remake of the 1933 classic. The performances and scenery are great, there are enough creepy creatures and action scenes to keep us on the edge of our seats, and there are enough tender moments to strengthen the emotional relationship between King Kong and Ann. One of the best of 2005. 5 stars out of 5.",1145750400,4,2591,4.710816777041942
7602561,3,B01AHWLX2O,"I really wish I hadn't wasted my time watching this film. The special effects are terribly cheesy, the story is grossly unoriginal, and the film is outrageously drawn out and tedious. If it weren't for the epic finale on top of the empire state building,  complete with guns blazing, a gorgeous multi hued sunset, and the imminent loss of ""true love,"" the film would have been a total loss, entertainment wise.

What's really sad is how anachronistic this film is. ""Kong"" is really a metaphor for inter-racial relations, handled in a grossly phantasmagorical way. The threat of a big black beast, threatening a delicate, lily white female may have entranced and fascinated our racially segregated society at one point in time in our culture. But the novelty of this idea is now lost upon us (well, except for our fascination with Kobe Bryant, and  OJ Simpson, and ok, maybe we ARE still fascinated by and fearful of inter-racial relations: woops!). But the notion of ""transplanting"" dark skinned creatures, taming them, exploiting them economically, only to have them turn on us and ""take"" our white women....come one, this really reeks of white male paranoia and privilege. King Kong made sense a long time ago in our society. So why beat a dead horse? We live in a multi-cultural society now. No need to waste umpteen millions of dollars to stir up a political hornet's nest. One hopes Peter Jackson has better use for his talents. One hopes. I'm glad Kong is dead.

There was no chemistry between the actors involved, unlike the chemistry between Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges in the 1976 version. They made the original remake actually work--no small task considering the fact that the special effects amounted to a man in an ape suit who slouched and beat his chest. The latest version of ""King Kong"" was another story entirely. Despite having access to spectacular special effects, fails on every level. Even the special effects were cheasy and overdone. I was left yawning, waiting for the next scene to start. One of my biggest problems with the movie was the gratutious violence. Kong was not portrayed as a confused, albeit fearsome monster who elicits a certain level of sympathy, instead, the new Kong is portrayed as a mean-spirited, blood-thirsty sociopath who kills for no particular reason. When this monster is finally killed in the end, one is not left feeling sympathy, but relief instead. Not only a sense of relief that an angry, murderous beast can no longer threaten New Yorkers, but relief that the movie is over.

7602567,5,B01AHWLX2O,"While the original movie of ""King Kong"" will always matter, I believe this is the version that all people who enjoy this story will turn to.  It is so much richer that the film has its own kind of majesty.  It isn't just a monster or a beauty-and-the-beast kind of tale.  This version is a metaphor for man's overestimation of himself and his abilities balanced with a story on the power of nature both as an external environment and as an inner drive.

This vast movie has three large sections.  First, is the setup in New York in the 1930s.  Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) is a down and out vaudeville performer with dreams of being in a stage production by her favorite writer, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody).  Carl Denhem (Jack Black) is an almost-but-never-been movie director/producer is desperate to make a film and finally make it, but his backers want to sell off the reels he has as stock footage.  His female lead has backed out and he has to find a replacement.  Denhem and Darrow happen to meet and he talks her into doing the film.  Denhem has conned everyone, but everyone really knows they are being conned, but in the hearts want to participate anyway.  Even Driscoll manages to get caught up into Denhem monomania.

The second portion takes place on Kong's home island.  It must be vast to support the huge life forms and the huge canyons and cliffs.  But reality isn't the point here.  The inhabitants of the island are truly savages and are decadent descendents or interlopers of the people who built the ancient wall and buildings.  The battles Kong has here to demonstrate his strength and supremacy go far beyond anything the first movie offered.  Of course, it is vital to notice the creatures in this natural jungle versus the mechanical creatures in the human jungle later in the film.  Be careful with young children, a couple of the battles with some of the fauna get to be pretty creepy.

There are several key developments for the main characters here that matter later in the movie, but the key relationship is between Darrow and Kong.  She is a better survivor here in a particularly vicious nature than she was in the city, but Kong's protection gives her enough time to appreciate his majesty.  Driscoll and Darrow develop a mutual, but unstated affection and it is Driscoll who goes back to rescue her from Kong and the jungle.

The third portion has Kong completely out of his environment and chained for the amusement of chuckleheads, well-dressed chuckleheads, mind you.  When Kong is presented with a fake Darrow, he decides he has to find the real one and breaks free, to Denhem's ruin.  He falls from the success for which he had always dreamed and schemed to the man who unleashed a monster on New York.  After Kong and Darrow find each other there are some touching scenes of mutual affection that culminate in the classic scene atop the Empire State Building - a stylized version of it.  The biplane battle echoing one of the encounters on the island leads finally to Kong falling from his final mountaintop.

The movie is a visual feast and tells this story with sincerity and conviction.  It offers up the substance the story has rather than sensationalizing it and I think that is a real treat.  I enjoyed it very much and recommend it to you.",1145577600,8,3282,4.649305555555555

Yes, I did think it was a little long but I think the 2h 57m was worth it. It is a really fun movie and at some points touching. Once they get on the island it is non stop action from the Dinasuar stampede to Kong fighting the T-Rex's to the crew fighting really gross bugs to Kong running around old time New York.

7602569,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson has followed up his wonderful ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy with an astounding remake of of King Kong that will leave you spellbound.

Jack Black stars as Carl Denham, a movie producer who is going to make a movie aboard a ship.  However, he secretly wants to find the uncharted Skull Island.  Unfortunately for Carl, his leading lady has disappeared, leaving his movie venture up in the air.  Naomi Watts stars as Ann Darrow, a struggling vaudeville actress who has just lost her most recent job due to the closing of the club where she was working.  By chance, Carl and Ann meet, and Carl offers the job of his leading lady role to her.  Ann accepts, and soon the members of the movie crew, including script writer Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) are on the S.S Venture bound for Singapore; or at least that was the plan.

Filming starts on Carl's movie, but while on board , the ship's captain receives a message that there is a warrant for Carl's arrest.  He is to change his course and head for Rangoon.  However, the ship encounters a dense fog bank and it slams into the rocky coast of an island. Skull Island.

Carl, Ann, Jack, and the others set off to explore the island.  Soon, they run across some blood-thirsty natives who succeed in killing several members of the party.  The ship's captain comes to the resuce in the nick of time, and everyone heads back to the S.S. Venture to prepare to set sail once high tide frees them from the rocks.  But, the natives manage to board the ship undetected and kidnap Ann.

Ann is bound and tied to a wooden rack and offered as a sacrifice to an amazing and mythical creature; a huge gorilla called King Kong.  Kong scoops up Ann in his huge hand and bounds away.  The others aboard the S.S. Venture soon realize that Ann is missing and head back to the island to rescue her.  But, Ann soon realizes that Kong doesn't intend to harm her.  In fact, she begins to like him as well.  But the determined crewmembers are intent on getting Ann back no matter what the cost.

Fierce fighting breaks out on the island as Kong fights against crewmembers and creatures alike, including three T-Rexs who try to kill Ann.  The fight sequence between Kong and the dinosaurs is one of the best sequences of the entire film.  Jack, having had his movie camera smashed to bits during one of the chases, comes up with another idea.  He wants to capture Kong and bring him back to the mainland and make a fortune on admission fees.  With the help of the remaining members of the Venture's crew, they manage to sedate the mighty Kong and bring him back to New York City.

Soon, Jack is standing before a packed auditorium with the curtain drawn.  The curtain goes up, and there is Kong, shackled with heavy iron chains.  Kong is still sedated, so at first he doesn't do too much.  But when he realizes that the girl brought onstage is not Ann, he goes beserk, rips off his chains, and goes on a rampage through the streets of New York.  Meanwhile, at a nearby club, Ann hears the commotion in the streets.  She sees one of Jack's promotional flyers blow by her window, and she immediately knows what's happening.  She walks out into the night to find Kong.

Once together, Ann and Kong somehow end up on an ice skating pond, with Kong laughing and playing on the ice.  However, this carefree moment is short-lived, as the New York National Guard finds them and begins shooting artillery at Kong.  Scooping Ann up in his hand, Kong heads for higher ground, namely, the top of the Empire State Building.  Kong, seeming to know what his ultimate fate will be, scales the building until he reaches the top, all the while carefully carrying Ann in his hand like a newborn.  Once on top and having suffered numerous hits from the guns of airplanes buzzing around them, Kong and Ann share a final, tender moment.

This is a tremendous film, and it deserves much more than five stars.  The special effects are simply out of this world.  The scenes on top of the Empire State Building are the best in the movie, with Kong swatting planes out of the sky like mosquitos.  But beyond the special effects, the story is very good, and touching as well.  The relationship between Kong and Ann is very moving, and you can see how much Kong cares for her by the way he protects her from danger throughout the movie.  The final scene on top of the Empire State Building is probably the most moving scene in the film.  Kong, resigned to his fate, makes sure right up until the very end, that Ann is safe.

I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The special effects will blow you away, but what will keep you watching is the touching and genuine relationship between a beautiful woman and a large but caring gorilla.  Enjoy.",1145577600,5,4753,4.493582263710619

7602571,3,B01AHWLX2O,"My wife and I watched this beast of a movie over the course of two nights separated by about two weeks.  She asked me what I thought, and after I thought I came up with these points, both right and wrong.

Right:

1.  The beginning.  I really enjoyed hanging out in 1930's New York  and getting to know the characters.  ""This is going to be a deep and thoughtful treatment of the King Kong story"" I thought.  That lasted until the infamous dinosaur chase scene.  More on that later.

2.  The ending.  I also thoroughly enjoyed Kong's final minutes climing up the Empire State building and his valiant but futile effort to fight off the fighter planes.

Wrong:

1.  The end of the beginning:  So, all of a sudden this movie that I'm really getting into becomes another stupid stunt-fest starting with a ridiculous and seemingly endless chase scene with humans running along with a stampede of dinosaurs.  Hey, those guys would have been dead in a few seconds.  Wouldn't it have been smarter to stand close to the canyon walls and let the dinos run by?  That's what I would have done.

2.  Stunts, stunts, stunts.  Ann ""Gumby"" Darrow gets jerked around enough to put her in a whiplash collar for years but suffers no ill effects.  In fact, we know she doesn't die during the King Kong story so all this putting her in front of snapping T-Rex nasties is a total and laughable waste of time.

3.  The beginning of the end:  So, Kong is finally overcome by chloroform and all of a sudden he's on Broadway!  How did they get him on the ship?  I really wanted to see that!

4.  If only all that time has been spent on character development and deepening the story!  Or, spend more time on Ms. Darrow and Kong's relationship.  I didn't need to buy the two-disc special edition because I really don't care to watch all the features on disc two.  I really don't care to see it at all.

So, this was a movie that was entertaining for both the right and wrong reasons.  I doubt I'll ever want to see it again.  At lease I can loan the DVDs to a friend or two and save them a rental fee.",1145491200,6,2074,4.323759791122716
7602572,2,B01AHWLX2O,"What possessed Peter Jackson, after seeing the script for King Kong, to go ahead with the project at all?

I mean, the man has talent. After the LOTR trilogy, that is an indisputable fact. So why he'd want to turn this GODAWFUL movie script into an almost-three-hour ""Epic"" is something I'll never understand. Perhaps he wanted to remake the original, as he felt it ought to be seen. Fair enough. Perhaps he saw the scope of the premise and thought it would make a stunning film. That's understandable, too.

But the whole point of the King Kong story is that it's a simple retelling of the Beauty and the Beast fairytale. Or The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Or The King and I. Or Mask. Or the Phantom of the Opera. Or... well, you get my point.

What all those stories have in common are Characters. Characters, people that drive a story forward by the strength of their personalities in the face of physical adversity. So why, tell me, does the script for 'King Kong' completely and utterly disregard all but the most perfunctory characterisation, and instead regale us with lots of stupid, stupid dialogue (there's no nice way of saying that) and *really* lousy performances from the human actors involved??

No, from a storytelling point of view, this is not a good movie. Naomi Watts is very pretty, but it appears to be a skin-deep talent: any old actress can scream and look lovelorn. Adrian Brody is hopelessly underutilised as the Good Guy, and lacks entirely the physical presence needed to pull off the mode of Hero. And Jack Black??! What the hell were the casting people thinking?? Jack Black, delivering the line ""Beauty killed the Beast. "", the last bit of dialogue in the film, with all the conviction and skill of a rhinoceros attempting ballet. None of it works, none at all.

Extras are pretty blah, too: it's not possible to form any sort of bond with the crew of the transport ship because there's no time devoted to developing them as characters in the film: we couldn't care less about Jamie Bell, Thoman Kretschmann or Colin Hanks' characters because we never get to see or hear them do anything that sets them apart from the rest of the crew. And the grossly racist pseudo-African tribal dance of the extremely savage Savages isn't powerful or effective: rather than looking like devotees of a strange Ape-cult, as they are supposed to, they look instead like rejects from a bad David Cronenberg film.

Which leads me to the real star of the show: Kong himself. Motion actor Andy Serkis must be given credit where it's due: the Ape, for the most part, moves in a convincing manner. And the computer-generated image of him works, too - this is a character with more personality than all the human 'cast' put together. It is a dreadful shame then, that Jackson decided to camp it up: the wholly unnessecary scenes of visual fluffing (the over-long Jurassic Park Throwback fight with the dinosaurs, the schmalzy and cheap ice-skating scene) show the one major flaw in Jackson's directorial style: egotism. A man who is seen to be able to do no wrong is a danger to his profession, and, very unfortunately, 'King Kong' suffers the very worst excesses of a director in love with his own image:

We have an hour before the Ape appears, during which the one-dimensional characters are not developed, and a dull-as-all-hell storm scene rages on for ten minutes more than it needed to.

A lot, a surprisingly awful lot, of the CGI scenes look cheap and basic: most of the time Naomi Watts is in Kong's hand, she either looks like a rag doll, or like she's outlined in blue. The sailors running from the dinosaurs looks ridiculous: the shadows don't match the background. And the fight between Kong and the T-Rex suffers from that fatal flaw of all CGI/Live-Action blend movies: the animated characters move just a little too slowly to be believable.

The acting stinks. I know, I complained about this before, but it's just so necessary to complain about it again. Jackson was clearly far, far more concerned with coaxing better performances out of his cameramen and special effects team than he was with his human players - and in a movie where the whole point of the story is that it's driven by the ignorance and evolution of man's attitudes towards physical appearances, that's a fatal flaw.

This dual DVD set is, if you're into this sort of thing, the best option: the picture and sound quality are great and the extras are nice to own - but for the most of us, rental is more than enough to experience the titanic failure of 'King Kong'. It is superficial, it is flashy, it is too long, and it's most certainly hollow.

A big disappointment.",1145491200,5,4660,4.684596577017115
7602573,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Great movie. Some of the best special effects you will ever see. Great acting by Naomi Watts.... The script wasn't as good as it could have been, but it's a very powerful emotional film and that sort of makes up for a great deal of that.

Some people complain about the first half being so long. I personally don't see the problem.... When you get into a good script combined with such an emotional film, you usally don't want it to end. The naysayers seem to just have a short attention span.

Not alot of B movie cheese here thank god. This movie shows a good, but brief love between King and Watts. It reflects how some real relationships can work... Despite him making a huge mess and destroying everything, she is able to the good in King as he shows he will go to any lengths to keep her out of harms way. And the relationship between the two really pulls you into the film.

The only reason I'm not giving it a 10 is because the script could have been a touch better and we get basically nothing for extra features.

7602574,1,B01AHWLX2O,"I appologise for all my spelling and grammar errors. Im going to be quick and sloppy since I really don't care for this movie at all.

I heard somone say that Peter Jackson ""practised"" for this movie by making the Lord of the Rings first...

About an hour into the movie I wanted to walk out. The beginning wasn't to bad, but then it just started getting plain stupid. For example:

Every animal in the jungle seems to be brainwashed by an evil wizard to kill all humans at any cost, without any care for its own health. (Tyranosaurus trying to eat the girl as they are held by vines and about to fall off a cliff, or the thousands of different speces of bugs coming together to kill the crew of the ship)

Adrien Brody is the macho tough-guy main character? God.. I hope I don't even need to explain this one.

There is a chase scene, where a pack of at least 20 brontosaurus's run through a canyon and the crew of the ship runs along with them between their legs, while fighting velociraptors. Approximately 5 people died in this 10 minute chase in which everyone should have died in the first minute.

It seems that they tried to make the humans into bad guys who kidnap innocent Kong who just wants love... (Cant really hold this against the movie, I just think its stupid.)

This is a Peter Jackson film.. He showed a lot of talent in The Lord of the Rings.. I expected a more intelligent movie, but then again it is King Kong.",1145404800,5,1432,4.32089552238806

7602576,3,B01AHWLX2O,"Sorry, Peter J., loved LOTR but you couldn't one-up yourself.  If you know the history of the very first Kong movie then you'll

realize that Jackson over indulged his own fantasy and failed to improve on the original simple but effective story line. He did manage to blow me away with the sp. effects but wouldn't that have been sufficient?  No he had to triple the number of T. rex adversaries as if one one was was just not enough for todays audience. A colosal encounter with one T. rex with realistic body trauma, not ""Disneyesque"" PG damage would have been far more scarier and involving.  One more peeve,  New York in the dead of Winter in a strapless gown on the top of the Empire State building with no wind.  Not!  Jackson convinced me there is a 30 foot tall ape but not that he has been to New York.  This type of incongruity diminished a potentially great film.  Hopefully, there will be a one hour shorter ""directors cut"" then Ill watch it again.",1145404800,3,960,4.44
7602577,2,B01AHWLX2O,"This movie looks like a contest set up by CG animators for CG animators. Let's make it as complicated as possible, they must have said. Let's not have one brontosaur, let's have dozens of them, on a panicked rampage through a narrow gorge. Let's not have Kong fight a single Tyrannosaur, let's have him fight three, not on the ground, but dangling from lianas. And then lets have lots more: giant leeches and giant spiders and giant centipedes, and, and... Unfortunately, the self-confidence of special effects people these days is not supported by the results in this film. The aforementioned brontosaur rampage looks thoroughly artificial and unrealistic, almost abstract: it disintegrates before our eyes. Moreover, special effects by themselves do not make a movie - a message that seems very hard to get through to large budget filmmakers. This is one very disappointing production from the man who made LOTR - he of all directors ought to know how to put digital FX to good use.

There are very few redeeming features. Granted, the reconstruction of 1930's NYC is impressive, though in the final part of the movie the set makers apparently weren't sure what season they were in - the sudden Christmas interlude on a frozen pond in snowy Central Park is as incongruous as it is ridiculous. Characters are flat as doormats, and utterly stereotyped. The ship's captain is gruff and taciturn, yet noble and brave; the actress is beautiful and vulnerable, yet plucky; the star actor of heroic roles is a vain coward; and the bookish writer turns out to be the bravest man of them all (and inexplicably sports a physique that suggests many hours in the gym rather than behind a typewriter). Dialogue is painfully predictable (""Scared?"" - ""No; should I be?""). Even the much-praised believability of the love affair between Anna and the Ape seems to be in the eye of the beholder. Personally, I thought Anna's burst of affection for a brutish monster that must have killed hundreds of innocent women in its time, made very little psychological sense.

Maybe realism is the wrong thing to look for in a movie with this subject matter. But if you strip away every form of realism, what has the viewer left to relate to? All that remains is a cold, soulless, overlong, and very expensive video game.",1145404800,8,2294,4.849489795918367

7602579,4,B01AHWLX2O,"I won't bore the reader with the story of King Kong. We all know what the movie is about. Did King Kong need to be remade? That's debateable. The original movie from 1933 has a charm that no remake could ever hope to acheive. The original movie is considered one of the top 100 American movies ever made and is still studied by film students and armchair directors to this day. I believe Peter Jackson knew this as he is also a big fan of the original. I think his version is more of a salute to Kong rather than a replacement. Purists like myself will always like the original best and I'll bet that Peter does too. But with the dismal 1976 Kong remake and the atrociously bad Kong Lives, perhapes it was time to dust off the old 'Beauty and the Beast' story one more time.

Jack Black was a perfect choice to play Carl Denham. Look at the original movie, Carl Denham he was a total ham. The guy had terrible lines that he delivered with amateur deliverance. Jack Black played the ham well, even repeating some of the worst lines from the original Kong movie 'No funny business' and 'he went all sappy' was a tribute to the original to be sure. However I have no idea who's idea it was to change Jack Driscoll from a weatherbeaten first mate to a playright, that was just strange. We all remember the tough hero first mate who saved Ann from Skull Island, not a wimpy writer.

The Skull Island natives were the best.... ever. Sure they were cool in the original, but they were no better than the extras from the old Tarzan movies. Now the natives were violent and mysterious. I enjoyed the scenes of the natives killing the visitors, it reminded me so much of scenes from Peter's old movie Dead Alive. It is a style all his own.

Skull Island is also the best yet. The longneck stampede over the cliff was incredible and totally blew anything away from the Jurrassic Park movies. This scene was used to replace the scene from the original where the longneck in the swamp tips over the raft and then chases the crew on land. I think purists like me would have rioted if Peter left out the famous and favorite log scene. I think I like the original version better, but the bugs and maneating worms at the bottom of the ravine were incredible.

In the original we loved how Kong put Ann in the tree and fought the single T-Rex. Now Kong fights three at once while holding Ann the entire time! Kong himself is an amazing special effects work in himself. He looks nothing like the original, but looks like a huge silverback. The path of destruction he leaves whether in New York or Skull Island is a treat for everyone.

OK, now the downside. This movie is a bit long, but that's not really the problem. What Peter did in some scenes just amazed me. He is my favorite director. I admired him back when he made Bad Taste and Meet the Feebles. I was a Peter Jackson fan long before Lord of the Ring nerds had even heard of him. So my question is, what was he thinking with some of these scenes where everything disappears and time seems to stop? When Kong is on a rampage looking for Ann in New York, the cops are cruising everywhere, the army is rolling down the streets, and the mobs of people are running like a kicked over anthill. All of a sudden Kong sees Ann and all is quiet. I mean like there's NOTHING! A vast scene of New York and the only living or moving things are Kong and Ann. Where the hell is everybody and why was that scene so long? C'mon Peter, you made you're point about Kong loving Ann back on the Island, no need to have them alone together again to reestablish it, espescially in a place like New York City.

Also the farewell scene I believe could have gone without the long (overly long) sad look of Kong. In the original he picked her up, gave one last look, and was killed. Only taking one airplane with him. Now Kong takes down two planes, but the final shots that kill him take way too long as Kong knows he is dying and tries to say goodbye. Again all is silent, no sounds of airplanes, or alarms, just silence. C'mon Peter we know Beauty killed the Beast, but let's not let the director get all 'sappy'.

So final word? Lovers of the original Kong will like it, obviously those who never bothered to watch old movies will think this movie is great and may not even know it's a remake, unless they think the 1976 was the original, and most importantly kids will enjoy it, because the bottom line is, this movie is fun.",1145318400,3,4445,4.316167664670659

This is an adventure movie that is supposed to sweep us away to unexplored fantastical lands and creatures and to stimualte our imaginations and emotions. This it does, and how!  It is not a 100% perfect movie, and you could , if you really wanted to, question a couple of decisions made by Mr Jackson regarding some plotlines. But to sit and squabble about why Jack wasn't wounded when the insects were shot from his body, or why the sunrise came so quickly on Kong's last day in New York (and all the other problems the sourfaced critics pointed out),is to totally miss the point!

As I said in the title section, there were a few moments when I just couldn't get into it.  Not to give anything important away, but one was when one crew member was firing wildly with a sub-machine gun, shooting bugs off of another guy without ever hitting the other guy with a single bullet.  Fortunately, things like that were few and far between.  Naomi Watts was amazing as Ann Darrow, the leading lady (how she didn't get an Oscar for this performance is beyond me).  And the animators who brought Kong to life...  They turned him into the perfect leading ""man"".  In fact, Watts and Kong (even though he wasn't even actually there when Watts was acting) had more on-screen chemistry than I've seen from most real human pairings in the majority of today's romantic comedies.  Additionally, while many people have disparaged Jack Black's performance as Carl Denman, I thought he was spot on as the smarmy self-promoter the entire movie.  He consistently lied to everybody throughout the entire story, including the very last line of the movie which, while meant to sound profound, just covered for the fact that it was his greed, not beauty, that had done the evil deed.  I didn't think the length of the film was excessive.  I was captivated by it almost all the way through.  They probably could have shortened it by a few minutes by getting rid of some of the more ridiculous things like that bug scene in the swamp area I mentioned above, but it still would have been nearly three hours long and well worth watching the whole way through.",1145145600,4,1636,4.546075085324232

Even Kong didn't scare me this time around, I would have prefered a scarier and more gigantic looking ape.  The original can't be beat and even the Delaurentis version was more edge-of-your-seat.

7602587,2,B01AHWLX2O,"When the highly anticipated ""King Kong"" first hit theaters, i remember a lot of critics and friends saying it was a "" great "" movie. However within the first 3 weeks of it's release those endorsements declined pretty rapidly, which i thought was strange for such a big budget special effects spectacular. And then I saw it ....

This movie sucks. By the end of it was wondering if the monkey had the right idea by taking a dive. It feels incredibly artificial and it's WAAYYYYY too long. It's 3 hours of cinematic overkill and rehashed plot lines that feel a lot like deja vu. The first hour we are introduced to all the 1920 period characters on a boat ( a la Titanic), who all have some history that plays no part in the last 2/3 of the movie. The second hour we finally meet the ape, but also about a dozen or so other dangerous creatures, including dinosaurs, which they must fight off in the mysterious lost jungle ( a la Jurassic park) and the last 45 minutes, or so, we get the beast running rampant through out new york until the military catches up ( a la Godzilla).

The saving graces are the scenery, the special effects, and Kong himself, who is the most impressive and believable character in the whole thing. Naomi Watts and Adrien Brody couldn't save the schlock-fest, and Jack Black just seemed out of place with his contemporary squinty eyed manic antics. This is a case where less ultimately, would have been more... like at least 45 minutes less, about 5 story lines less, and less cheap-shots at sentimentality.

7602589,1,B01AHWLX2O,"Yeah, you'll give me a ""this review was not helpful"" rating, but I don't care. This bombastic, over-indulgent piece of mis-directed, poorly written drivel is one of the best examples of how super-ego and super-budget does not equal great movie.

Let's start with the visuals. The visual effects are absolutely appalling. I've seen art students with mac minis and copies of maya do a better job. I am speechless at all the people who talk about the visual splendour of this film. It's amateurish and makes me think of 80s Harry Hanussen movies. The blue screen stuff is pitiful.

Next comes the lame script. Here we go with formula guys: Act 1 (1 hour) getting to the island. Cliched set-ups of  cliched characters. Act 2 (1 hour) on the island. Endless chase scenes with animals and scene after scene of impossible physics. That Ann isn't killed a hundred times over is impossible. But hey, it's a movie. Act 3 (1 hour) getting back to New York. This is the only part of the film I liked, but even that was choppy.

The acting is okay. I actually think Jack Black brought something to his role. Naomi Watts and Brody walk through their scenes. There's no depth here, folks. Doesn't anyone remember how great Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange were in the 70's version?

Finally, the direction. Peter Jackson does not understand tone. This is why all his movies before Lord of the Rings (where the tone was dictated by the content, which was an adaptation) did not work. Have you seen them? Frighteners, Heavenly Creatures, Meet the Feebles - all interesting movies but the tone is off. Same here. Is this a comedy, a drama, an action film? The cliches make me think he's going for B-movie matinee stuff, the dramatic scenes make me think he wanted epic, the gross animals stuff makes me think horror. Can't a movie be all? Yep, but when you look at something like Jurassic Park, you see that they can work together seemlessly. Not here.

In the end it's poorly executed potboiler mash and it's disconcerting that so many critics and viewers have lapped this up. If we don't start expecting more, this will be the benchmark and filmmakers just won't have to try any harder.",1145059200,28,2168,4.662303664921466
7602590,5,B01AHWLX2O,"These days, it is rare to see the main hero or protagaonist die at the end of the movie. During the Great Depression, when the standard of living was much lower, life much harsher, and death much closer, it wasn't too unusual for the hero to meet his death. Good things, in such times, seems to be ephemeral.

If King Kong was made as an original today, surely the heroic gorilla would have continued to live in happiness or at least have his death be meaningful. But King Kong, of course, dies a tragic and misunderstood death.

I cried in the last 10 minutes of this film. It is not neccessarily his death that disturbs us; we all know how he would die beforehand. But it is a needless death of a creature of awesome physical prowess and agility with genuine human need for companionship which deeply disturbs us.

The 1933 version wasn't as depressing because King Kong was portrayed as a wild brut who happened to have a weird fascination with Anne Darrow. But in this version, King Kong is almost human, and his love for Anne Darrow is not so weird because we understand his strong need for a companion.

At the end, one of the characters mention ""it was beauty that killed him"". I disagree, it was man, the most terrifying killer of all, who has a need to kill everything and everyone which is perceived as a threat, that killed King Kong.  This killer instinct and behavior, it seems, is one of the reasons why we are at the top of the evolutionary heirarchy. But it is also what makes us the most cruelest creature of all.",1145059200,,1530,4.430604982206406

I have heard people complain about the first hour, but it didn't bore me in the least and was neccessary for character development.  The battle between kong and the trio of dinosoars is jaw-dropping.

However, there were a few things that bothered me, such as how Carl doesnt care about anything except his movie, i mean, i undestand that was his character, but it was taken to an extreme. There were also a few things here and there, but they are so minute that i am stil giving this movie 5 stars

7602592,4,B01AHWLX2O,"""King Kong"" is the umpteenth remake of the 1933 film that starred Fay Wray as a starlet who wins the heart of a wild giant ape, leading to his destruction at the hands of civilized men. Peter Jackson directed and co-wrote this 2005 version of the story, which takes advantage of major improvements in visual effects technology over the past 70 years to create a giant ape whose emotions are more recognizable and sympathetic than in ever before. In Depression-era New York City, Carl Denham (Jack Black) -filmmaker, profiteer, con artist, and ""preening self-promoter""- has worn his financiers' patience thin with his extravagant vision for a romantic adventure film. They pull their financial backing, and Carl absconds with his footage, determined to shoot his film on a legendary remote island -legend of his own making. He spots Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), a struggling vaudeville performer, on the street and thinks she would be a fine leading actress. Ann signs on only because her favorite playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) is writing the script. Cast and crew set sail on a cargo ship captained by a German named Englehorn (Thomas Kretschmann), a trafficker in exotic animals, ostensibly bound for Singapore, but actually in search of someplace more sinister.

""King Kong"" is a film in 3 or 4 acts, depending upon how you count. The first and last take place in New York City, as Carl Denham pulls his cast and crew together and, finally, when he brings ""King Kong: Eighth Wonder of the World"" to the public. These segments are terrific. Jack Black lends Denham the right amounts of humor and unbridled ambition, and the city anchors the film in the real world. The discord and intrigue on the ship as it sails for anywhere exotic, dangerous, and far away from authorities is also interesting. But most of the action in ""King Kong"" takes place on Skull Island, where all manner of monster live and thrive, including a fearsome  25-foot gorilla that the native humans call ""Kong"". This is where we get to know King Kong and watch the intrepid filmmakers burn a lot of calories evading huge, hungry, computer generated beasts. Some of this is good, but there's too much of it -to the point of camp. The giant bugs sequence would have been better omitted, for example, as it's ridiculous (intentionally) and holds up the main storyline to no purpose.

That said, the relationship between Ann and Kong is terrific. Kong's emotions seem real. His eyes aren't quite life-like, but they're trying to be. ""King Kong"" wouldn't be as good without its superb supporting cast, so I want to mention Evan Parke as the philosophical veteran ship's mate Mr. Hayes, Colin Hanks as Preston the sound man, and Kyle Chandler as vain leading man Bruce Baxter. The entire cast does a great job of bringing credibility and humor to a story of man-eating monsters and a besotted gorilla.

The DVD (Universal 2006 single disc): ""A Volkswagen Touareg and King Kong"" (2 min) is a behind-the-scenes look at filming a VW Touareg commercial. We also see the commercial. ""See More of NTC: Wish You Were Here"" (1 min) is a trailer for a short film that you can see on seemoreofnyc(dot)com.

Obviously the special effects in Jackson's version far surpass those of De Laurentis', but I find the '76 version to be more realistic and less heavy handed.  You can actually feel Jackson pulling at your heart strings with his ""Kong,"" and it is is over-played.  Additionally, the film is far too long, with a great deal of repetitive and boring scenes.

The only reason I go with 4 star instead of 5 is simply because somehow the blending of live action and CGI as good as it is, still seems to be missing some sort of realism I can't put into words.
The original as crude as it may seem by today's standards still tugs at the emotions more than this hi-tech version.
There is still something about CGI no matter how good it is that seems to emotionally seperate you from the character and not accept them as real somehow.

There were so many of these ""dramatic effect"" instances that they began to resemble dumb looks instead of looks of amazement.",1144886400,2,458,4.7375
7602599,2,B01AHWLX2O,"'King Kong' is worth watching as a rental simply for the actual effects of Kong.  Peter Jackson's visual effects team really did a phenomenal job with that and there aren't many moments where you really don't believe a 30 foot ape is actually on set or on stage.

That's really about the only good thing I can say about this, though.

This movie reminds me a lot of the Star Wars prequels in that, it seems, many of the effects (which is essentially the last 2 hours of the movie) are on screen to show the world, ""hey, look what we can do!""  There are scenes that don't even make sense in the actual plotline of the feature and add zero relevance to anything in the story other than showboating (the dinosaur stampede had me throwing my arms up on the couch shouting, ""Why???"").

I'll give Naomi Watts a bit of credit because I would imagine it's hard to act when you're standing in front of a green screen alone for most of the shoot.  She did a relatively convincing job, but everyone else on the screen is pretty bad, here.  Jack Black is awful and does nothing but make contorted faces when he gives his lines.  There's a strange relationship between two ship-men (a former soldier and Tom Hanks' kid) that makes zero sense.  The former soldier preaches to this kid the entire time they're on screen as if it's supposed to mean something.  Adrian Brody jogs with prehistoric animals and large apes as if it's the most natural thing in the world, as if he grew up in Queens with dinosaurs as pals or household pets.

That's a big problem with 'King Kong'.  These people are thrown into extraordinary circumstances and they wander aimlessly through the scenes as though they're everyday occurrences (notice jack Black just hanging out and spinning his camera while mayhem is going on all around him).

The first hour is a complete bore.  When the movie picks up it isn't much more than a special effects extravaganza.  it would have been nice if there was something...anything here to go along with those effects.

However, Peter Jackson obviously suckered millions upon millions out of admittance prices, so what does he care, really?",1144886400,7,2138,4.63129973474801
7602600,3,B01AHWLX2O,"Oscars are powerful things. For some, they are simply paths to better projects and pay. For others, Academy Awards are the brass ring on the carosel, allowing filmmakers a free ride on their next project. It's often manifested in a long-sidelined dream film - in Peter Jackson's case, that means a remake of his first inspiration, ""King Kong"".

These projects are usually sidelined for a reason, and in the cases of ""Toys"", ""Joe Versus The Volcano"", ""One From The Heart"", or ""Heaven's Gate"", the Oscar-won dream can (at best) leave audiences scratching their heads. The biggest compliment I can give this lush, overstuffed remake is that it does evoke (and sometimes enhance) the pathos of the story that has until now eluded me. At last, I was able to get a sense of what it would have been like to have seen the original as a child.

It's the story of Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), a down-on-her-luck actress who's forced to explore the burlesque circuit. She meets Carl Denham (Jack Black), on-the-run filmmaker, con artist, and showman. He invites her to be the lead in his next adventure epic, which just happens to be written by her favorite playwright, Jack Driscoll (Adrian Brody). It takes a little while, but eventually we're aboard a tramp steamer (with Ann and Jack locking eyes), heading not to the Singapore location, but the mysterious Skull Isand. Carl's hoping that between his map, Jack's script and the unknown jungle, he can conjure up an adventure film that'll get him out of dutch with his studio bosses.

He - and we - get a lot more than he bargained for. There's a fogbank and a shipwreck before Carl and his crew make their way ashore. At first, the isle seems deserted, but later we find that there are indeed islanders to contend with. A fierce battle ensues, Ann is kidnapped and presented as an offering to a mysterious creature thought to be legend. Kong.

It's love at first sight for the big guy - he spirits Ann away, and the middle third of the film is primarily expended in the others' efforts to rescue her. Unfortunately for the ship's crew, Skull Island is jam-packed with other giant beasties. Dinosaurs! Stampeding herbivores! Slithering, croc-like carnivores! Centipedes! Spider-scorpions! Bats! And worse. Our heroes fight them all in one set piece after another. The effects work begins to slip in quality under the load, but more importantly, none of this is necessary to the story.

Fortunately, we do get to see what is - Ann and Kong alone together in the jungle. Using today's new technologies to maximum advantage, watching them form a bond is funny, tense, and genuinely touching. Similar to the original, Kong defends his maiden from a Tyrannosaur, though a couple more are thrown in for good measure. There's a melancholy quality to Kong's territory, littered with the bones of his fellow apes. We're also shown a reason why Kong makes his canonical skyscraper climb in the first place.

By the time Jack comes to the rescue, Carl has abandoned his film ambitions, setting his sights on Kong himself. Using the ship's stores, and with Ann and Jack as bait, the crew manages to subdue and capture the ape, preparing him as a sideshow attraction on Broadway. It's a cruel, painful sequence, effective but perhaps overemphasized, considering what is to come.

The climax in New York, happily, is the film's shining hour, the most polished and emotional portion of the film, vividly illustrating (and building upon) the tragic power of the original. Interestingly, some of the most effective shots render Kong tiny, dwarfed and surrounded by the civilization that will ultimately destroy him. It's fantastic stuff, and well worth the wait.

The film loses some battles, though, on the way to its third-act victory. The opening's introduction of Ann is awkward, and could be trimmed or eliminated entirely. While the performances of the cast are strong across the board, many of the crew members are over-developed, adding to the film's considerable paunch. ""Kong"" is a big story, but it doesn't necessarily need the ensemble-epic-treatment that served Jackson so well in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. While nearly every monster battle would be exciting in isolation, they begin to provoke impatience when assembled in a train. The ""Rings"" films don't require as much of a sense of economy, but this pile-it-on mentailty threatens to capsize ""Kong"".

In this case, it might be prudent to revisit the film for the DVD release with a shorter cut, rather than the extended versions that Jackson prefers. Considering the reworking his films get for home video, a streamlined edit might get ""Kong"" much closer to the great film that it could be.",1144886400,,4687,4.907828282828283
7602601,3,B01AHWLX2O,"I'm not sure where to start with this review...

I guess my first problem was the casting of Jack Black...I like Jack...I've liked him in every movie he's been in.  He really tried hard with this role, but in the end, was not very convincing.  Jack is known for his intensity, and it simply was not there in this film.

Some of violence in the film seemed somewhat gratuitious and forced...certainly some of the scenes on Skull Island could have been cut back without losing the impact - personally I thought the Brontosaurus ""pile-up"" was ridiculous. It's also doubtful that the real Ann Darrow would've survived the g-forces she was subjected to during the chase scenes...I can only suspend so much disbelief.  I will admit that whoever was assigned to the facial expression on Kong did an excellent job - he or she was able to show emotion and understanding in every expression.

The chase through New York was again pointlessly long.  I thought it was strange that Ann Darrow didn't suffer hypothermia, having been exposed to freezing temperatures for, by my estimation, at least an hour.

Whoever was in charge of the script really missed a couple of good opportunities to bring a bit of humor to a couple of situations which would've gone a long way in making the film a bit more engaging and enjoyable.

I don't think this movie deserves all the kudos it's received...it seems to have been made to make a few bucks...I'm sorry Peter, overall I felt it was just average.",1144800000,2,1476,4.689922480620155

7602603,4,B01AHWLX2O,"Detailed comments and opinions about Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" abound here on Amazon, so I'll just throw in a few quick observations about the DVD release of the film:

1)  Subplots that I felt were needless when I saw the movie in the theater (for instance, the ship captain and the young deckhand frequently discussing Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"") bothered me considerably less during home viewing, maybe because the ability to take breaks while watching the DVD made the length of the movie less of an issue.

2)  The few moments of less-than-stellar special effects I remember from my theater experience seemed to magically disappear on DVD (in the dinosaur stampede, for example, the human characters now seem to be perfectly integrated into the action with the stampeding dinosaurs).  Were those few sub-standard special effects ""tweaked"" between the theater and DVD releases, or is it simply a matter of minor effects flaws not being as noticeable on a smaller TV screen?  Whatever is the case, the movie now looks perfect, effects-wise, from beginning to end.

3)  On the second disc of the special-edition DVD, I really enjoyed the documentary on 1930's New York.  It wasn't tossed-off filler by any means, but a detailed, PBS-worthy snapshot of a complex, dynamic time and place.

There's a lot more I can say about ""King Kong"", the movie and the DVD, but I just wanted to share a few of the stronger impressions I felt upon watching the DVD recently.  I will say that, overall, I think ""King Kong"" is a great movie, and while it doesn't quite approach the triumph of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, I can't imagine anyone not at least mildly liking it as a whole while being very impressed with specific portions of it.

But that's just me.  Maybe I'm just a sucker for huge battles between a 25-foot ape and a bunch of dinosaurs.",1144800000,2,1845,4.782334384858044

The film itself is stunning, a major feat of film making prowess. But if you don't want to know how the magic tricks are done ( to make the film) and to what degree the CGI and  WETA have  created the end product then do NOT get the two disc version.

Frankly, we did not need Jackson to inject his thoughts on the ""barbarian"" races of man-the movie's uncommented upon stereotypes were bad enough. Back in the 1930's, the Nazi's established a special research outfit (the Ahnenerbe) to uncover ""Arian"" ancestry to Egyptian, Inca and even Roman civilizations; likewise, Jackson's ""documentary,"" unlike the original movie, states the ""present"" inhabitants on the island were primitive beasts incapable of putting two stones together, let alone build the massive walls around the island. One suspects that Jackson's native prejudices have gotten the best of him (his fellow New Zealander, Jane Campion,  portrayed New Zealand's indigenous people in a similarly unflattering way in her film ""The Piano"").

  That said, King Kong is very well made movie. It is simply too bad that after viewing the Skull documentary, that in the back of our minds we have to wonder: what was he thinking  while he did this?",1144627200,,1500,5.273109243697479

King Kong was too slow in parts and the slow parts of this movie made it feel six hours long instead of 3 hours long! I think that the filmmakers could have shortened this movie by an hour and had a better film.

This movie was way too Hollywood and the overuse of predictable action sequences was very distracting to the movie.

The perks of this movie were the story/plot twists that were different from the 1933 King Kong Classic. The acting was great and I was amazed at how realistic the computer animation was in creating King Kong and other creatures on Skull Island.

7602609,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Academy Award Winning director Peter Jackson (Best Director, 'The Return of the King') follows up his award winning Lord of the Rings series with the big budget remake of the 1930's classic ""King Kong"". Now, I'm a movie buff. I've seen thousands of movies, but have somehow managed to never see King Kong. So, seeing this movie was my first King Kong experience.

And frankly, although hobbit-heads will crucify me for saying so, this movie's better than Jackson's Lord of the Rings series. A lot better.

The movie's special effects and art direction are absolutely amazing, they're beautiful to look at and at times a bit creepy. The all-star cast is magnificent and then there's Kong, who's ten times better looking (as far effects go, I mean) than Gollum. Oscar nominee Naomi Watts (Best Actress, '21 Grams')

plays Ann Darrow, a struggling actress who's theatre has just closed down.

Jack Black plays Carl Denham, a movie producer who's film is about to be axed. Oscar winner Adrien Brody (Best Actor, 'The Pianist') plays Jack Driscoll, a playwright who's working on the final draft of the screenplay upon which Carl Denham's film will be based on. As Denham races to the boat he will be boarding to go to Singapore and shoot his film before the studio execs arrest him, he discovers his actress has dropped out of the role.

So, he desparately searches for a replacment and finds Ms. Darrow. Loading her onto the boat and creating enough diversions to keep Jack Driscoll stranded on the boat; they're off to Singapore...Sort of. Midway through the ride, Denham reveals that he's actually searching for an island that's not on any map and is thought to not even exist. Skull Island. Well, it does exist and

Jack, Denham, and Ann; as well as the entire crew of the ship get temporarily stranded on the Island and Ann is kidnapped by the natives who offer her to the extremely large monkey that inhabits the Island. Jack and Denham go search for her, but while Jack actually wants to find her; Denham just wants to shoot his movie. Jack Black, is known for his comedic talent and while this is a ""dramatic"" film; Black is still not in the dramatic role. He plays Denham perfectly and can obviously do drama but still uses sarcasm and comedy for his dialouge. Adrien Brody is capable of being a good action hero and pulls off Jack Driscoll perfectly. And then there's Naomi Watts,

who's literally the perfect choice in the role as Ann Darrow, Kong's muse and object of affection. The reason Watts is so good is because she's capable of looking glamourous in 1930's New York and still look like that when she's covered and mud and being saved from a group of T-Rexes. Andy Serkis finds his way into the movie, both as the basis of Kongs facial expressions and as one of the ship's crew members. Anyway, this movie really is spectacular, no question. One of the most entertaining and flat out great looking films of 2005, and at 3 hours and 8 minutes; It better be.

7602610,2,B01AHWLX2O,"I'm amazed that so many people liked this movie.  In every way that it touches on the original, it fails miserably.  Carl Denham, based on director Marion C. Cooper and presented as a showman at the top of his form in the original, is presented as a loser and con man who has almost no track record and who lies to everyone throughout the movie.  Jack Black's portrayal is so low key that you wonder why anyone would follow this guy across the street, much less to the South Pacific.  Ann Darrow is portrayed as too good for burlesque, but not too good to steal an apple from a vendor (something that the original's Ann refused to do, even though she was starving).  The natives on Skull Island may be the most unsympathetic of all.  Shown as quaint primitives in the original, they're transformed to bloodthirsty headhunters in this remake.  Yes, they're scarier, but we get no sense of what it is that they're scared of, as the ""bride of Kong"" sacrifice/ceremony has been removed, so that when they kidnap Ann (done, not by rowing up to the ship, but by pole-vaulting across the rough seas and dragging her back on a rope easily covered the better part of a mile and whose weight would have dragged her under), we don't know what's in store (well, yeah, we do, but only because we've seen the original).  The CGI animations of the monsters of Skull Island are abour as perfect as we've come to expect, but so what?  We've seen stampeding dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, and the combat between Kong and the three T-Rexes involves him tossing Ann around as if he were juggling her.  The constant jolts would have killed her long before the end of the fight, which went on far too long.  The NYC sequences are gorgeous, but again, the action makes very little sense.  The sequence of Kong chasing Driscoll in the cab owed more to the Godzilla remake than to Kong, and the sequence between Ann and Kong in Central Park is so idiotic as to defy description (giant ape on ice with girl in skimpy evening gown, shouldn't she be frozen stiff by the time they got to the top of the Empire State Building?).  Yeah, I know, these sound like nitpicks, but when a three-hour movie fails to engage, you have all of the time in the world to pick it apart.

7602611,3,B01AHWLX2O,"First let me say that the character Kong was AMAZINGLY realistic onscreen.  No effort was required to suspend disbelief in this improbable character.  Kong himself was completely believable.

Other special effects, however, were not handled with the same skill.  The scene with the dinosaur stampede, fighting the t-rexes while suspended in vines, and the scene in which one character shoots numerous large insects off of another character with a fully automatic carbine without injury to the other character were so implausible they nearly ruined a movie that could have been truly great.

Jackson's special effects are so overdone, you never feel that the characters are in any real danger even amidst dinosaurs' gnashing teeth, rocks crumbling beneath their feet, or while clinging too the feet of giant bats.  In my opinion, Jackson got too carried away with his digital effects.",1144540800,5,883,5.271428571428571
7602612,3,B01AHWLX2O,"King Kong (2005), 187 Minutes. ""The Eighth Wonder of the World.""

Pros: I could watch the crew's adventures on Skull Island over and over again. It is some of the best fantasy filmmaking to date. The indigenous islanders were authentic and creepy, their fortress was a place I would love to explore, and the island action left me wanting more, more and more.

Cons: Can you say hokey? King Kong contains some of the most unbelievable and silly scenes to make it to film in the last 60 years. The ship's crew running under the legs of dinosaurs (...for what seemed like hours)? Come on Peter Jackson, this scene was one of the most laughable scenes I have ever watched. Drop the LoTR's yes-men that are telling you all of your ideas rock, and get some filmmaking help that shoots it to you straight. There are too many hokey scenes for me to remember: Kong ripping Ann Darrow from her restraints without Ann's arms being severly broken, no hint of how Kong was transported back to New York, the vine scene, the flying away hanging from a giant bat scene, the scene in which Kong was chasing the taxi, etc. Hokey. Horrible.

More cons? Time wasted on Ann's relationship with her aged friend and co-cast member, time wasted on covering interaction (while they travelled to Skull Island) between the ship's crew that neither made you care, or had any impact on the plot. And my last con: by the time they finally got back to New York...bam! the movie was over. The ending was dull and lifeless. Kong atop the Empire State Building swatting at a few uselss planes? Common! He took several hundred bullet wounds on Skull Island and you're telling me a couple of hits from a plane did him in? Anywho...

The Purchase Factor: Would I purchase King Kong and watch it again? Yes! I could watch the Skull Island adventures over and over again. They are a tasty fantasy treat!

7602614,4,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson's King Kong is a beautifully rendered version of the original movie. The special efects are fantastic, and the relationship between Kong and Naomi Watts is truly touching.

Yes, it is much too slow at the start. Jackson spends way too much time building up the charaters of Naomi Watts and Jack Black. He could have cut that down to about 15 minutes without hurting the overall movie.

But once you get to the island with Kong, the movie is a visual delight. It is a much better homage to the original than the pathetic attempt by Dino De Laurentis in the 70t's.

When Kong comes back to New York and escapes from the theater, there is a beautiful scene of him and Naomi Watts ice skating. It's very lovely and adds a whole new dimension to their relationship.

Even though you know what happens in the end, you still find yourself rooting for Kong. Once again, it has a sad ending, with the exact same words as were spoken at the end of the original- ""Twas beauty that killed the beast.""",1144540800,,1002,4.459016393442623
7602615,2,B01AHWLX2O,"The 2005 version of King Kong started out great, with a good flavor of New York during the depression. Eventually it gets too long: dinosaurs and people getting killed or injured all over the place, over and over again. And the Empire State Building scenes also drawn out at the end. And why were those guys in the planes shooting at Kong when Ann was up there too in bullet range. Maybe he was such a menace that they had to sacrifice her in order to bring him down? I wonder why I never thought about that when I viewed the original 1933 version.

So this new version shows a relationship between Ann and Kong. Cool. They could have cut the film down by at least a half hour and accomplished the same thing. When we watch the extras on other DVDs, we see those good deleted scenes that were taken out because they were dragging out the film or parts of it too long. How come nobody thought about that here?

7602616,4,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson's loving and overbloated tribute to one of the greatest films of all time.  I was eagerly anticipating the release of this film.  I really liked parts of it.  Most of the scenes with Kong are amazing.  So lifelife and so much emotion from the character.  Attention to detail (you can see every hair on the gorilla, the lighting on Kong during the Tyrannasaurus batte in the vines)is on the spot.

I only wish the actors were as animated.  Jack Black is all wrong for Carl Denham.  Too young and too demented looking, not a very good actor either.  Thought that Jason Alexander or Nathan Lane would have made a better Denham. They have the ability to play a lovable con man and are so much more theatrical.  Adrien Brody as a playwright?  Why change him from a sailor to a playwright?  Makes no impact on the story whatsoever.  He seems to know from the start that she only has eyes for someone else (big & furry).

The movie could have been trimmed down.  Shorten the boat trip to 15 minutes.  Lose the scene where Driscoll mistily watches his play and moons over Ann Darrow.

A little more realistic outcomes would make it a better flick too.  Kong battles 3 T-Rexes, swapping Ann from hand to foot rather violently.  She falls very far from on top of a dinosaur's head, mind you, and is unscathed. Not a scratch on her.  Clothing looked pretty good too.  On top of the Empire State building Ann is clad in a little white slip of a dress and doesn't seem to be cold at all - in the winter time.  Maybe it's that big fur coat that keeps her warm?

Anyway, loved Kong. Could watch his scenes over and over.  Best special effects I have ever seen in a film.  I'm a stickler for them. So disappointed in most flicks of late.  Dark, fast monsters that you can't even see.  Usually apppear at night or during a rainstorm.  Not Kong - resplendant in the brilliant sunlight. Amazing",1144540800,,1889,4.412790697674419

After watching Peter Jackson's King Kong, I ran out to Best Buy, and picked up the King Kong Collection.  I watched the 1933 version, and was amazed at how much I appreciated BOTH films.  I could certainly see the love that Peter Jackson has for the original film, reflected in his absolutely amazing version.

Peter Jackson has taken the original, and really given it depth.  We get a great deal of backstory on the characters, and the first third of this film really delivers on character development.  The film sucks you in, and doesn't let go until the final, heartwrenching climax.  Even though it's over an hour into the film before we actually see Kong, the film does not lack substance.  Once we see Kong, the film kicks into high gear with some of the most insane (in a good way) action sequences ever conceived.  Jackson, and his team, deliver the special effects like you've never seen, yet, they are secondary to the story.

Finally, the film moves into New York, where the bond between Kong and Darrow becomes an intense sequence, leading into the best climax I've seen in a film, for quite some time.

I purchased the 2-Disc Special Edition without hesitation.  I'm so glad that I did.  I've enjoyed this film several times since bringing it home, and the bonus features are very interesting, and informative.

Anyway, last night I sat down and watched Peter Jackson's latest version. Although the movie is 3 hours long, I didn't even notice. Some movies are too long at 2 hours, but Kong was just right at 3 hours. The length of the movie matches it's grand scale. Overall, I must say that King Kong lives up to the hype - a wonderfully wild ride. It reminded me of the first Indiana Jones movie - a modern movie with an old serial adventure feel.

Kong weaves a fantastic story in a believable fashion, pulling few if any punches. The relationship between the female lead (Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow) and King Kong is both refreshingly realistic and poignant. The movie has a depth of story which I wasn't expecting. The scenes of depression era New York are absolutely stunning in it's realism. Jackson should be commended for this alone. He also spends a good deal of time on character development. Most of the characters are multi-dimensional, but it is clear that the main characters are Ann Darrow and Kong. Interestingly, it is Kong himself who undergoes the greatest transformation from beginning to end.

Be warned - there is plenty of violence - Skull Island is no place for the faint of heart! I'm not particularly squeamish, but there are two scenes involving larger-than-life bugs that I won't soon forget - ugh! I read an interview with Jackson who said the original 1930s version had a similar scene which was removed after the initial screening - apparently people in the audience got nauseous and some even threw up.

I knew Jackson's work in the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy was spectacular, so I figured that would translate well into King Kong. I was not disappointed one bit. The special effects were amazing, as I knew they would be. What I did not expect, and quite frankly, what no one expected, was the incredibly emotional and heartbreaking aspects of the film. I rarely shed tears at a movie, but this one had me shedding quite a few. I have never seen a more moving film than King Kong. The reason why is because 2005's Kong is not a ""monster,"" as he has been portrayed in the past. He is a real gorilla in this film (albiet 25 feet tall), and that is the difference. When you see him suffer, you're watching a majestic animal suffer, not a ""horrific beast."" The relationship between Kong and Ann Darrow is a friendship, not a ""love/lust"" interest. You realize Kong is very lonely, the last of his kind, and in Darrow, he has finally found a friend, one that he is willing to give his life to protect. That's what makes his ultimate demise so heartwrenching in this film.

Peter Jackson has created a masterpiece. Yes, the special effects and action sequences are stunning, but what is more stunning is the emotional impact of this monumental film. If there's one thing I wish Jackson had changed from the original film in his new version, it was the tragic ending-I just wish Kong would've lived.

This new KING KONG is worth a look but I find it not as overwhelmingly great as to justify all the fawning reviews it has received.

The first hour DESPERATELY needs trimming.

The interaction between the ape and the girl is very very good. The ape is very expressive. Great animation.

Some of the actions setpieces are ridiculously overblown (and run too long). I have no problem with humans running from stampeding brontosauruses and Rexes but they survive far too many close calls and calamities for there to be any real sense of danger anymore. A few close calls would have been fun and exciting, but for there to be close call after close call after close call after close call.....it gets silly real quick. And the suspense and sense of danger is diluted to almost nothing.

King Kong runs with the girl in his grasp, drops her and recatches her time and time again. Unless she were made of steel or rubber she would have been squashed like a pea long before it was all over. Didn't even break a rib. What the hell is she made from?

Things like that, the elements that s-t-r-e-t-ch-h credibility within the confines of a fantasy film, are the kinds of things that cheapen these movies and make them look like expensive video games.

I never got a sense that there was much real love between Ann Darrow and the male lead (Adrian Brody's character). Attraction, sure. But love, no. So when Brody's character goes through hell and high water to rescue her it seems more an act of chivalry than love.

Shall I go on? Why not.

The bi-planes attacking Kong on the top of the Empire State Building -- that part was pretty cool and well-shot (especially in terms of camera POV and set up, all within the computer, I know). I am deathly afraid of heights and those scenes gave my vertigo a real workout.

Ann Darrow/Naomi Watts atop the ESB: In the dead of winter and at that height, she would have been blown off the top of the building by the chilling and powerful winds. Looked like Spring up there in the movie. And though the sunrise looked nice for the scene, the elapsed time of the whole third-act NYC sequence leads us to believe that the great unveiling show at the Times Square theatre must have taken place at about 4 o'clock in the morning.

New York scenes: -- other than the crowd in the theatre district, the town looked deserted. Hardly a soul in sight.

Skull Island: The first native we see is a little girl. In typical Hollywood fashion, she looks like a very cute young actress wearing ""make me look grimy"" makeup. The Old Lady native is obviously a woman in heavy amounts of ""make me look old"" makeup. That stuff almost always looks fake and calls attention to itself. Couldn't they just find a good senior-age actress?

Note how the Skull Island natives just disappear from the movie after they attempt to sacrifice Naomi Watts. Our heroes return to the Natives' area later to trap Kong (no mention of how they got Kong back to NYC on that little boat) but the natives are nowhere to be seen.

Notice that in the long and protracted fight with the T-Rexes (or V-Rexes or whatever) Kong sustains several strong bites to his forearms but still muddles through as if nothing happened. But our heroes shoot a relatively tiny harpoon into his leg and Kong is pretty much disabled. Watch Kong almost fall down when he takes that harpoon to the leg. It shouldn't have felt like much more than a needle stick to him. Sure, they used some chloroform on him too but it was a negligible amount meant for incapaciting animals about a tenth of Kong's size.

The fact that the Skull Island wildlife is at such odds with each other while our heroes are on the island invalidates the possiblitiy that those species' populations could have co-existed for so many thousands or millions of years together.

I'm sorry, but there is no way in hell ANYONE could have survived that ""bug attack"" sequence, machine guns or no. It all looked like a video game. Did you see how many close-range machine gun hits the bug on Adrien Brody took from a nervous gunner and Brody never got a scratch?

I have other beefs too, but suffice it to say that a lot of this movie was overblown video-gaming and I find it VERY hard to believe that so many Film Critics would grade this film so highly and uncritically. This film gets compared to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" a lot, but ""King Kong (2005)"" is succeeding on spiffy visual effects and the patronage of a quality-starved moviegoing public. ""Raiders"" succeeded because it had real fun, real suspense, and a central hero who was in real jeopardy but climbed believably out of it. You never really sense our heroes are in any real jeopardy because the danger sequences are too ridiculously elaborate and overstuffed to be believable or credible (again, within the confines of this obvious fantasy world).

This KING KONG suffers from what I call ""George Lucas Sequelitis"" -- the story is nothing but a vehicle for the effects sequences. Given a choice to make between any particular moment's or scene's narrative integrity or to beef up that same moment's or scene's spiffy and elaborate effects, Jackson (like Lucas) chose the latter.

This film rates a 3 1/2 stars out of 5 at best. It is a fun movie, but the parts that don't work so well and are transparently thin will not hold up well to repeat viewings, and thus the film's value will not have the same kind of ""legs"".

I was 10 years old when Dino DeLaurentis' 1976 version hit the screens and I actually liked that movie a lot, even if I though the Great Ape looked like a human in a suit (which it was) more than an actual ape. But it DID have two very important things going for it: the first was Quality Actors. Watts and Brody are good actors, but they are given rather thin dialogue and we really don't get much characterization beyond the two-dimensional sort. Watts gets a few moments late in the film, but mostly it is ""damsel in distress"" stuff. 1976's Jeff Bridges, Charles Grodin, and Jessica Lange managed to rise above the so-so script and lend some gravitas to their characters.

The second thing the 1976 version had that this version flirted with but never nailed was a character like Jeff Bridges' character. He was a scientist who knew that this undertaking was foolish and was the voice of reason and perspective. ""We took away their God. A year from now that place will just be an island full of drunks"", his character said when they had Kong safely aboard the oil tanker headed back to NYC. That is a very important part of that story's mythology and it didn't get addressed properly in this new version. You felt that Bridges' character was the lone source of intelligence in the whole proceedings. In this new version NO ONE fits that bill.

""King Kong"" (2005) will make a ton of money, sell a ton of DVDs and video games, and probably win a few technical Oscars. But it is also an overblown and overstretched piece of indulgent filmmaking that is riding a wave of hype and Peter Jackson's post-Rings Trilogy reputation. If you look at the film even somewhat critically (as apparently our nation's trusted movie critics have largely failed to do) you will see that its flaws are large and in great number. In fact, I would venture that the filmmakers were ""too close"" to the project and lost their narrative objectivity because they were having too much fun with the concept. They took the whole thing a bit too far just because they could.

From the George Lucas ""How to Make an Expensive yet Disappointing Fantasy Film"" Bible: ""It doesn't have to make sense, it just has to look cool.""",1144281600,27,7677,4.567272727272727
7602631,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Let me begin by telling you my dislike for Peter Jackson coming into Kong. After LOTR (a better book, excellent films though as well) the fans and media turned me off on the series to a large degree. So I went into Kong with my girlfriend with almost a gruge against Peter Jackson, I wanted him to fail. Anyone living before this movie would know the press built Peter Jackson up to be untouchable, a god. Anyways, to what we are all here for the film review. With all this in mind I came out upset at myself, for I like so many others had become enchanted with the ""magic"" Jackson is capable of creating. The movie which has been re created more times than I care to think about brings life to this old story. I left the theater enchanted and still have those sentiments months later. I remember seeing the previews and thinking ""how stupid"" another King Kong, bravo Mr. Jackson very original. Well, I was wrong. King Kong really didn't even intrest me (i went because of my g/f) I always thought the idea of a huge gorilla parading around Manhattan was silly and downright ridiculous. However, when I left the theater I had all those emotions one gets who likes this film (happy, scared, sad, hate) and to this day, months later, I still hold the same sentiments.

7602633,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I do have a special place in my heart for the movie King Kong.  It's the first movie I purchased on VHS wayyy back in 1987.  It was the first year I purchased a VCR to tape Star Trek: the Next Generation.

I have to tell you on every level that Peter Jackson made Kong real to me. The original was timeless, however this one is an update and makes the characters more realistic than ever.

I don't know how the CGI department made him look real and almost human! Without giving away the whole movie; when you looked in Kongs eyes, it looked like there was a person behind them.  There was a brain behind that look in his eyes when he was staring at his female costar.  I don't know how it was achieved so well with a computer but I have to say to see this movie once is not enough.  It will become another one of those classics that you can come back to again.",1144195200,2,860,4.053254437869822

I've tried twice to sit down and watch this film fairly and conscientiously.  But despite its marvellous special effects, this latest retelling of the Big Ape Tale simply fails to nudge, let alone embrace, my rapt attention.  What am I looking at here?  Is it horror?  Is it social commentary?  Is it Sci-Fi?  Is it slap-stick?  Is it outright parody of putting as much SX frosting as possible on a cake that has gotten so stale even the ants are looking for a new picnic?  Maybe a little bit of each. Maybe none of the above.  Heck, maybe it's even an effort to use those Orcs left over from LOTR by recycling them as Skull Islanders...  One question I had was figuring out *what* I was watching.  A more serious question developed as the film proceeded through 30, 40, 50 minutes; that was ""Why am I watching this?.""

I'm sorry to say that this remake of ""King Kong"" isn't going to make my top ten films list.  Perhaps I'll feel a little more compassionate toward it once I succeed in forcing myself to watch the entire film.  But the fact that I'll be using force of will to do so doesn't seem promising.

Tastes differ, of course, and I have friends who rave about what a monumentally entertaining and exciting film this is.  But after two very well-intentioned attempts to uncover the source of their enthusiasm, I'm beginning to question their taste (or mine).

7602639,2,B01AHWLX2O,"If you have never seen a version of King Kong, you may think this is a great movie (but I doubt it).  It is just way too long.  It takes forever to get to Kong and then you will think that he will NEVER leave Skull Island.

For those who know King Kong, it will probably be a bummer to watch this.  The back-stories are almost all new and they aren't that interesting.  Adrien Brody, who plays the screenwriter of the movie that is going to be filmed on the expedition, ends up being the macho hero.  The guy is a great actor, but give me a break!

A friend said he thought the title should have been ""The Island Time Forgot (featuring Kong).""  The natives are really creepy on the island (nothing wrong with that part), but here is what you have to sit through before Kong is captured:  1. Tons of weeds and trees and bugs.  2. A Brontosaurus stampede that somehow doesn't kill everybody.  3. Lizards trying to eat Ann.  4.  Four T-Rex's fighting Kong forever (Kong wins).  5.  Insects attacking what's left of the group.  6. Bats attacking Kong but staying away from easier prey -- Ann and the writer.

Lots of folks die in this version.  LOTS.  There are good things here and there, of course.  I would recommend checking out the movie from the library and then watching 30 minutes every day while you walk on the treadmill.  Otherwise, you'll get bored and kranky.",1144195200,2,1368,4.392
7602640,4,B01AHWLX2O,"Like so many others, I am an ardent fan of the 1933 horror classic and I was deeply suspicious of the release of this effort given that awful campy remake produced by Dino de Laurentiis in 1976. I purposefully waited until this current interpretation became available on DVD because I didn't want to waste my time again. That was a mistake.  This was a very good movie that maintained the spirit and tone of the original ""King Kong"" while stylistically blending technical and comic elements reminiscent of 1999's ""The Mummy"" to great advantage. This is what the popcorn selling movie experience should be about! A bit too long at 3 hours, this film could have easily been condensed to 2:15 to 2:30 run time without losing any substance of value except perhaps 30-45 minutes of unneeded content. Still, I was entirely enchanted by Naomi Watts portrayal of Ann Darrow and she played the role with a deft sensitivity and she did it without slipping and falling on campy drivel like Jessica Lange did in the first remake. The special effects were as they say...""spot on."" Kudo's all around for a stunning simulation of 1930's New York City. Skull Island was captured as both a horrifically menacing, yet breathtakingly beautiful place. A highly believable, expressive and profoundly tragic life was magically if more accurately...skillfully and digitally breathed into Kong in a way not seen before. Kong seemed to act as a natural animal with only occasional moments of seemingly human characteristics for the viewer to glimpse and relate to.  Of course we all have to suspend reality to enjoy such a fanciful story that obviously flies in the face of known science but who cares?  After all, a few hours of entertaining diversion is precisely why we enjoy this genre of film in the first place...right?  Enjoy this ""King Kong"" for what it is....a first rate piece of movie making that pays loving and respectful homage to a modern myth borne of the fertile imagination of one Merrian C. Cooper and is certain to resonate somewhere deep within the human psyche as long as stories are told.",1144195200,2,2086,4.851123595505618
7602641,4,B01AHWLX2O,"Wishing all along to see this, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this adaptation of the classic horror movie is quite noteworthy.  I have been a fan of Naomi Watts since ""The Ring"".  Here she is wonderful as the the beauty who tames the savage beast.

The special effects are of the highest caliber though I admit I grew a little weary of the fight scenes betwee the computer generated animals/monsters.  Thankfully, the movie did not descend into a special effects extravaganza, usually to hide the fact that the writing was less than stellar. Though not a big fan of Jack Black, he was most competent as the director whose priorities left much to be desired.

It is certainly a worthy addition to anyone's collection.",1144195200,,729,4.753968253968254
7602642,2,B01AHWLX2O,"Now that most of the hype has died down, it's time to look at Peter Jackson's...sorry, make that PETER JACKSON'S...mega remake of ""King Kong"" with a cooly critical eye.  Yes, the ape is terrific.  In fact, Kong delivers the best performance in the film.  But the incredibly bloated, tumultuous three-hour ordeal wrapped around him is an endurance test.  Augmenting the grievously self-indulgent overlength is the problem that it is virtually impossible to get involved in the action or the characters since every art-directed frame of ""King Kong"" screams of artifice, dramatically, technically and stylistically.  As a demo reel for the New Zealand-based special effects shop, it's pretty spectacular.  But as a film, it's a demo reel for a special effects shop. Despite Jackson's off-stated love for the 1933 original, his monkey show has much more in common with the disastrous 1976 remake starring Jessica Lange.  In fact, the Lange version might even be better in some regards.  For instance, Lange's asking the big ape what his astrological sign is in the '76 version plumbs the depths of stupidity far more concisely than the interminable vaudeville dance/juggling/acrobatic number Watts does to try and impress this Kong.  Both are equally ludicrous and make the brave heroine look like an idiot, but the Lange version drops its bricks and moves on, while the Jackson version pounds them into the ground with a slow motion sledge hammer.  Adrian Brody somehow manages to maintain his dignity while everyone around him is slipping on giant banana peels, particularly Jack Black, whose casting as the maniacal producer Denham is as puzzling as it is unsucessful (apparently Pauly Shore wasn't available).  Like Watts, however, Black should receive some credit for managing to stretch one unchanging expression out over the course of a three hour movie (though to be fair, it's hard for an actor to convincingly react to what is going on around them when all of that will be added in later digitally).

Two stars for the ape animation, but the rest of film should run on a double feature with ""Bela Lugosi Meets A Brooklyn Gorilla.""",1144195200,4,2136,5.071428571428571
7602643,2,B01AHWLX2O,They could have cut the first hour out and it still would be a waste of time. The only good thing about this movie was King Kong. Its a shame what they did to such a great classic film.,1144195200,3,185,3.769230769230769
7602644,5,B01AHWLX2O,"First let me say that I have always been a huge fan of the original King Kong.  Computer animation aside, what Willis O'Brien did with stop motion animation was one of the great technical achievements in movie history.  Like many I was certainly gun shy about another Kong remake after the disastrous 70's film and the even worse sequel.  But knowing Peter Jackson was at the helm eased my mind.  First and foremost Jackson is also a huge fan of the original and wasn't going to try and do anything that would disparage the film.  The first thing that Jackson does right is that he sets his film in the early 1930's, just like the original.  This is key in maintaining the atmosphere of the 30's theatre scene and the rickety ship the Venture.  It just doesn't work being set in modern times.

Jack Black as Carl Denham also scared me as Black is none solely for his juvenile comedy films.  While he doesn't play it with the bravado of Robert Armstrong in the original, Black's slick, smarmy, do anything for a shot, works well for the most part.  Adrien Brody is Jack Driscoll, the playwright who basically finds himself shanghaied by Denham aboard the Venture to continue his screenplay.  Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow is really the star of the film.  While she doesn't have that famous Fay Wray scream, she handles the role as beauty to the beast with a beautiful romantic sensitivity.  I hope fans caught the in joke when Denham was looking for actresses for the role and said, ""What about Fay?""  His partner replies she's making a film for RKO and Denham snarls, ""Cooper!  I should have known!""  This of course refers to original Kong director Merian C. Cooper.

If there's one weakness of the film it's not the length, but rather the length of time it takes to get to Skull Island.  Over an hour is spent building up the plot of Denham running off on his ship to make his movie, even after his financial backers want him to shut production down, and then making the long journey to the mysterious island.  Once we get to Skull Island the action takes off at a frenetic pace as the cast and crew are attacked by the savage natives until saved by the ship's Captain Englehorn and his crew.  Ann of course gets kidnapped by the villagers and taken as a sacrifice to Kong.  This leads to a chase by Driscoll, Denham, and the crew to rescue her.  Meanwhile Ann is winning over the beast by dancing and juggling and you will believe a giant gorilla can laugh.  While the battle with a handful of T-Rexes may have gone on a bit long, fans of the original couldn't help but be excited by Jackson inclusion of the Spider Pit sequence which was excised out of the original film.  In this scene, Driscoll, Denham, and other crew members fall into a ravine where they become pray to giant insects, man-eating slugs, and crab-clawed spiders.

Ann is rescued and Kong is captured, all setting up the climactic escape from the theatre where Denham has put Kong on display, much to the disappointment of Ann and Jack who want no part of the spectacle, and the final battle atop the Empire State Building.  This third act seemed somewhat rushed though and I could have done with more time spent here and less on the opening.  I suspect, just like Lord of the Rings, that in a couple of months we will get an extended cut of the film with even more special features than what comes on the two disc set.  While this remake is not without a few weaknesses, it's still one of the best remakes of a classic film ever.  Call it 4 1/2 stars!

7602648,3,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson does a lot right with King Kong and I really wanted to love this movie as much as his Lord of the Rings (LOTR)films but there is something lacking here.

First off, the right.  The Kong and Ann relationship at the core of the movie is handled excellently.  We see why Kong may become protective of his diminutive charge and not eat her as she uses Vaudville slapstick comedy to entertain him.  The joy on his face is evident.  And then when this tiny person actually stands up to the giant we can see why he might even respect her more.  As he protects her from the dangers of Skull Island we see why Ann would come to feel fondness for the giant simian.  Never is there a creepy vibe from their mutual fondness.  Every scene involving Kong made me believe he was there and his abilty to emote sold the character.  Also, even though on the long side, the introductory hour of characterization was nice to get to know our characters.

The not so good...  As soon as our heros reach the island the action begins and never stops.  Not so bad, but some of it is very hard to swallow.  In the LOTR trilogy we see CG creatures we believe in and even more important the actors seem to as well. In Kong we see our characters running with a stampede of Brontosaurs and it seems like they are just jogging down the road by my house.  I've seen more fear in my own eyes having to look at said joggers in their tight jogging pants than I saw in the faces of our characters.  Never once could I suspend my disbelief and believe they were really in any danger or even inhabiting the same space.

The same thing happens again and again, the bug scene, the crocodile like lizard scene, the T-rex chasing Ann scene, the bats.  Oh,my.  And our characters are superhumanly able to go on and on with nary a scratch, other than the dead ones. Only Kong was able to pull the movie out for me.  Kudos to Andy Serkis (of Gollum fame)and the animators for making me love the ape and thank goodness the last third of the film is his alone.

I really think that there were BEAUTIFUL parts to this movie, and Kong and his emotion were many of them.  The scenery was amazing, and the basic story was well done.

This intense love story is filled to the brim with passion.  The action has you on the edge of your seat.  The glimmers of humor come at just the right time.  Not bad for a film that has been remade so many times that most everyone knows every piece of the story line.

The film isn't perfect.  My daughter just kept saying ""I can't believe this isn't rated 'R'"".  Once again she is correct.  The violence is over the top.  This movie reminded me of a combination of ""King Kong"", ""Love Story"", ""Jurassic Park"", and ""Final Destination"".  It might not be everyone's choice.

Another drawback is the length.  About 2/3 of the way through the film one begins to realize that it still has a long way to go.  If you watched Peter jackson's, ""Lord of the Rings"", you might get the same feeling of length with ""King Kong"".

The plot was predictable, and we all know how the story goes...yet it was still fantastic to watch.  I have to say it's a five star movie that I expected to be a three star. Peter Jackson did a great job on this movie.

I did notice one flaw in the movie...immediately after falling into a river two lead actors (Jack & Ann) change scenes and are running for their lives down the road...they had just climbed out of the river and voila! Their hair is dry and they really don't look wet at all even though they almost just died in the river.

I think that one or two death scenes in the movie are particularly gruesome...so I would not let little ones watch this movie.  There is also a lot of profanity in the beginning of the movie...too much.

The humanization of King Kong was done with such slight effects that it was believably unbelievable.  It's just a great movie overall and gets a great movie vote from me.

How many times did the T-Rex's JUST MISS ANN?

ANOTHER UNIVERSAL POOR JOB AT A DVD PACKAGE & TODAY 4-3-06 I read Universal broke their own DVD sales records with this film.

1.  ONCE AGAIN, NO FILM INFORMATION OR CHAPTER STOP LIST IN THE DVD PACKAGE

2.  THOSE HORRIBLE, TERRIBLE LITTLE FLIP OPEN THINGS TO GET THE PACKAGE OPEN.  I HATE THEM!!

A good, but not great job by Universal & the film makers.",1144022400,,1055,3.9759615384615383
7602653,5,B01AHWLX2O,"peter Jackson has created a masterpiece, a triumph, something  that you cant take your eyes off!..its just that huge:) Kong has arrived in style...

 this is what happens when you get a director that actually Cares about what hes making..Just like George Lucas and steven speilberg ..peter jackson has presented us a film that has spectacular special effects..and  more important  a wonderful STORY...Because as LUCAS and JACKSON have stated countless times the story is the most important element in a  film, and the special effects are merely tools in helping you get the story told...

peter jacksons King Kong..is superb in paying homage to the classic 1933 film(which i have to be honest..its hard to choose between the 2 films because they are both excellent) in respect for the  original film 'P.J.' deceided to place the film again in the 1930s  with a expanded outlook on charecter development..we get to know more about  ann darrow ( the love interest in this beauty and the beast tale)  we learn that she is a vaudeville entertainer caught in the grip of the great depression...we also get to know more about  carl denham..who is a risk taking self promoting filmaker who is determined to get his film made at all costs....
 we get to see more of the crew of the Venture, we learn that the captain is a animal poacher, and a smuggler ( i liked that..for some reason he reminded me of han solo)

 the bulk of the movie takes place on skull island  a mysterious island hidden in the south pacific  cloaked  by a shroud of fog hidden from the modern world...its on this island that dinosaurs roam freely, giant bugs creep and crawl , and  scared nativs crouch in fear of their god..a giant, 30 ft tall gorilla they call KONG.. whats there not to like ?
  well as for the rest of the film...you know it...you love it...its inspired dozens of filmakers..  but what makes  King Kong really stand out is the way kong is presented..he has heart, emotion, and you can tell that he loves ann..this is truly Beauty and the beast..  this film has expanded the classic film tenfold... you cant help but  getting teary eyed at the end when kong has his final battle with the biplanes on the top of the empire state building...just like the original this new version of kong has depth and emotion  truly groundbreaking in effects work ..as in the original which in fact was just a stop motion puppet! both movies shine..

some people panned this film because of its length  which was a little over 3 hours..i say so what?  this is  not  a movie..its a event...in my opinion  movies should be 3+ hours..it gives the director more time to properly set up his story and preset it right..look at how successful the lord of the rings trilogy was ...i wish the star wars films were likt this, because this is the way to go...i mean look at titanic that was 4 hours and nobody cried about that.. im going to voice my opinion on this topic..if you cant sit still and pay attention for a while then this is not the film for you... go see the animal or something like that...

 as for the dvd..this is a class act it ranks right up there with the  star wars  dvds in presentation...you get the widescreen(the only way to watch it) you get extensive behind the scenes production diaries that cover basically every aspect of making this mammoth of a film  you get a mockumentary on skull  island..what if it really existed...you also get a  very interesting  documentary on the 1930s and the great depression..  and lots of other goodies...

 there are a few versions of this film released.. but this 2 dvd set is the one to get!  and remember  those peter jackson production diaries from a few months ago..you really don't need those anymore..but if you have them keep em  they make a nice companion to this set..but if you don't have them..dont get them because everything  is basically here..and more

King Kong..is one of those movies that  stands the test of time..and this film is no exception...its a tribute to a great film..and so much more..  Thank you  mr. jackson for this wonderful epic.",1144022400,,4084,4.610570236439499
7602654,4,B01AHWLX2O,"I liked King Kong... a lot.  And purists forgive me, I think this is the definitive version of the story.  But sometimes less is more and it's personified here.  Ok, first the good.  The special effects and take on Kong are incredible.  He looks like an ape - not a man in a monkey suit - and he acts like an ape.  There are scenes where I swore I was watching a National Geographic special (save for the gargantuan size of the animals involved).  As Ann Darrow, Naomi Watts was phenomenal.  And I loved the moments where Kong treated Ann like a rag doll.  Past versions of Kong always had the ape treat Ann with respect and awe immediately.  Watt's Ann needs to earn Kong's trust.  It's much more believable in almost a Dian Fossey kind of way.  Oh, and Jack Black does a fine job of channeling Orson Wells as a driven (mad?) filmmaker.

Now the bad.  Where the hyper reality of the ape effects worked well, the hyper reality of 1933 New York left me cold.  The last time I saw this much attention to detail in a film was the boat in Titanic.  Every bolt was accounted for, every plane of glass was there.  It should have felt real, but it felt like I was looking at a museum replica of the city, not NYC itself.

My other major complaint was the over abundance of sub-plots.  The original King Kong treated the sailors as anonymous victims. Here, the pendulum swings the other way and we know more about the crew, but it is all extraneous.  For example, we meet Jimmy, the former stowaway and now crewmember of the Venture.  Nothing he did or said forwarded the story.  If his scenes were cut, the pacing would have been improved and the audience would not have missed a thing.  As it was, it felt like Jackson was more interested in fooling us into believing that we were looking into a fully fleshed out past, rather than sticking to the tragic romance at the core of Kong.

So my complaints aren't about the running time.  I love a long movie if there is enough story to support it.  Lawrence of Arabia, Gone With the Wind, the original and extended editions of the LOTR.  These are wonderful stories that need 3 plus hours to tell.  King Kong simply isn't.

Here's to hoping that if Jackson does a ""special edition"", he tightens up this movie, instead of adding to it.  It's already too bloated.  Trim away the excess and this King Kong will be the classic he wanted it to be.",1144022400,2,2382,4.357630979498861
7602655,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I hate to admit it but I was extremely skeptical that it would be any good when I heard that Peter Jackson was making a remake of King Kong. Not that I doubt his ability as a filmmaker, he proved his worth with ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies. It's just that 1933 film is a classic beloved by all and, often, revered as the best giant monster flick ever made. I was just skeptical that anything new could be done with Kong to make it fresher than the original. Lo and Behold, Jackson did it. In everyway possible, he offered a fresh approach to the original story and movie. With an all-star cast, this 3 hour epic is one of the best movies I've seen in recent memory. I really enjoyed it. Think of it as one part classic Kong, and one part Jurassic Park with a dash of modern day revisioning and you got a modern day Kong flick worth watching. I'm glad I got the movie.

I do have to admit that I am also a fan of the '76 version of King Kong, as well. Even so, I feel Jackson's version is better in many respects. If only people knew who he was when the american version of ""Godzilla"" was being filmed, we would have seen a better film. You know? At any rate, King Kong is a great & exciting movie. Definitely worth getting and adding to your collection.",1144022400,,1255,4.14344262295082
7602656,1,B01AHWLX2O,"There still is only one King Kong, and he's alive and well in the new dvd release of the 1933 Willis O'Brien masterpiece.

 As for this mess, I'm sick of seeing computer animated digital paintings being passed off as the new generation of movie magic. Reducing characters and settings to polygons and texture maps does not make them look real, they just look like moving oil paintings.  Less an improvement over past techniques than a cheaper, faster alternative, at best it's a lateral move in a less aesthetically desirable direction. CGI exists nowhere else but the flat screen; clearly, and it shows just that, it's FLAT,  as in ""lacking depth"", which is why such images also lack a sense of life and are instantly forgettable. The objects used to create these virtual images will never be romaticized or sought after by collectors, nor enshrined in movie museums.  They can't be, because they don't exist in the real world.  CGI carries none of an artist's physical touch, nor the resonance of imagery recorded when real objects and characters go before the camera. Because of that, these transient virtually created images will never achieve the kind of legendary status that decades of real cinematic craft have given us, and that, decades after their premieres, are still loved and idolized.

The most obvious example here would be the original ""Kong"", over 70 years old and rightly idolized by Peter Jackson.

Which is why I can't understand how Jackson, a fervent Kong fan, could (digitally) render such a pile of poo. Jackson may be tantamount to a god for legions of fans, but I have never understood why.  A certain ""Ring"" trilogy literally put me to sleep before I could make it through the first installment, and I find this bitter pill just as hard to swallow.

This ""KONG"" is no fun--worse, it's tedious and overwrought.  It comes off like meatloaf, so packed with fillers and extenders that the finished work barely resembles it's origins, or it's original intentions. If I had been alone for the viewing of this tired body I would have fled 30 minutes into the thing.  As I was unable to escape, I found myself fidgeting constantly, and realized I was actually pulling at my hair and grinding my teeth when being force fed such empty calories as Jamie Bell's whiny sea boy struggling with what it means to be a hero (who cares, kid? Why is your character taking up screen time? Did I just answer my own question?) or the many ""dramatic"" zooming closeups of Evan Parke as he's imparting some crapball of quiet seafarin' wisdom that's been written for him to say, or enduring yet another unnecessary and ridiculous digital Dinos Gone Wild segment(there are MANY of these to choose from, just pick your favorite fictionalized silly species--prehistoric vampire bats, anyone? How about an ""exciting"" mid-air battle involving not one, but THREE T-Rex wannabees?.

How 'bout that beyond extreme Skull Island native population, who, from the look of their surroundings, must actually be located not on a lush South Seas island, but on a rocky alien planet completely devoid of shelter, plant life, color, or a detectable source of food?  Wait-what with all those human bones lying around, are we now supposed to think that they have been AMPED UP like every other element of this travesty so they are now scary CANNIBALS? Oh, brother. And why do the native islanders all look like caucasians who were literally doused in Hershey's chocolate syrup? Is that why they're all so mad?

And HOW many TIMES do we have to see a sweeping helicopter shot of that damn boat?  I get it already, they're on a mysterious voyage aboard a tramp steamer. Nobody's sure how it's all gonna end up, there's an island full of skulls, we're all so scared, blah, blah, blah.  Roll end credits, please.

The list of offenses goes on and on and on, but I've got a date to view the real Kong and his yet-to-be-matched leading lady. Sorry, Ms. Watts seemed earnest enough, but, well, at least she tried. Just don't make me have to sit and watch her exchange drawn out, longing, deeply meaningful glances with either Adrien Brody or a piece of CGI ever, ever again. I'd tolerate another viewing of the awful 1976 version before I would endure three hours of this again. At least the '76 version is redeemed by Rick Baker's genius. Real actor in a real costume, real rubber, real hair, real light striking a real surface. NO motion capture needed. That ape is no less convincing, just un-real in a different, less offensive way.

I'll close by saying that if you like movies with miscast lead actors (why does Jack Black have a career?) and specifically movies which contain lots and lots of flat, fast-moving but lifeless, often strobe-y video game effects, then you will certainly call this ""entertainment"".

Oh, yeah, did I mention that nearly every scene was apparently steeped in orangey tea for an irritating, patently tweaked honey/amber effect (to drive with a sledge hammer the notion that we're seeing a scene taking place in the old-timey 1930's, or are having to look at a digital sunrise/sunset/maudlin digitized death scene), or appears to have been washed in blue ink for an equally irritating, cold and grim effect?

I hate, hate, hate this version of King Kong. Fay Wray, by all accounts a brilliant mind, confirmed her intellect when she personally declined Jackson's offer to appear in this project.",1144022400,16,5401,4.829902491874323
7602657,1,B01AHWLX2O,"This version of King Kong is basically a remake of the 1976 Jessica Lange disaster while mocking the 1933 film at the same time. The special effects are poor. Especially during the scene were the sailors are being chased by a herd of Brontosaurus. Jack Black is obviously mis-cast. The film on the whole is just way too long. Call the 1933 film CORNY if you like but it is still the best film of it's kind. To make things worse, this DVD release is not true Widescreen. Looks like the film was cut at the top and bottom to give the appearance of widescreen.",1144022400,8,557,4.314285714285714
7602658,2,B01AHWLX2O,"The original KING KONG is very likely my favorite movie; there's no saying how many times I've seen it during the past half a century, beyond ""plenty.""  I tend to regard the sequels and remakes and knock-offs (with the single exception of the original MIGHTY JOE YOUNG) as bad ideas whose time came, and went -- leaving the one and only real KING KONG undiminished alongside other classic movies (e.g., CASABLANCA, CITIZEN KANE, THE WIZARD OF OZ) that stand up to repeated viewings, even a lifetime's worth of viewings, and, what's more, resist being improved upon.

To give it its due, Peter Jackson's KING KONG isn't as bad as the 1976 remake; it gives good monster -- think JURASSIC PARK with a big ape and a dash of ALIENS.

Nevertheless, I take away points for the silly, yea, verily, embarrassing relationship developed between Jackson's Ann Darrow and big ape; for the film's multiple offenses against the laws of physics (at least as those apply everywhere except in bloated Hollywood action flicks) (I suppose I should be grateful, though, that nobody in this film outruns a fireball); and for its overinflation of everything that worked perfectly in the 1933 version so that hardly anything works at all.

And that is the heart of my disaffection: Jackson's evident belief that More Is Necessarily Better.  The original Kong battled a tyrannosaur?  Jackson's Kong battles three count 'em three of the critters -- while performing a trapeze act!  Twelve sailors meet horrible death in the original film?  Seventeen meet even more horrible death in Jackson's flick!  Four airplanes attack the original Kong atop the Empire State Building and one gets knocked out of the sky?  Jackson's Kong is attacked by six airplanes and dispatches three of them!  The original KING KONG lasts 103 minutes?  Hah!  Jackson's lasts days.

I doubt seriously that I'll ever again watch this movie all the way through all by myself.  And I am a guy who, during the past month, has, all by himself, viewed the 1933 version twice and listened to its audio commentary track on a third occasion.",1144022400,6,2080,4.886039886039886
7602659,5,B01AHWLX2O,"To movie goers everywhere, the remake of a classic film has always been one of colossal disappointment. The film King Kong which originated in the 1930's has stood the test of time. In 1976, a remake was offered with Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lang. However, despite Bridges' enormous talent, the film itself fell well short of the mark. In the original it was Robert Armstrong, Fay Wray and Bruce Cabot who challenged the might of King Kong. In this new version, director Peter Jackson combines the talents of Jack Black as Carl Denham, Naomi Watts, as Ann Darrow and Adrian Brody as the hero against the Eight Wonder of the World. Asides from the fantastic new animatronic scenes which adds towering adventure and blood curling excitement, the real 'special' effect to this new version is King Kong himself. Adroitly brought to life by Andy Serkis, the giant ape not only displays unbridled power, explosive terror, but a deep sympathetic quality which elicits long over due admiration for the creature. So much so, one wishes the ending would not finish like the original. All in all, this remake is truly a welcomed contender to the original, earning the director and his cast enormous applause for a film which not only hit it's mark, but does so with fulsome praise from audiences everywhere.

Same ole story; Kong gets captured, brought to NY, goes to the top of the building, gets shot by planes, dies.

If you like your movies computer drawn then this is for you. It looks too much as if the whole thing was drawn, not filmed. Far too much of it looked too fake for me. People seem to like these kind of films more than I do. You don't really need a story, just lots and lots of computer drawn images.

And Kong had the agility, skill and speed of a martial arts expert. Too fake for me, not believeable at all.

Add to that the fact that this movie, for me anyway, was 3 loooong hours.

But I guess for a flick to sit around the house with the kids to watch, it's okay. Just didn't really do it for me.

Didn't do very well at the Academy Awards either. No wonder.

7602665,4,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy fame brought us another epic film.  A film that I gathered through numerous articles that he has been wanting to make forever.  I saw the film on the big screen and of course, like most other people, bought the DVD, for it is an epic of the ages, a story told many times before-A story told many times in differing movies-Beauty tames the beast.  When first word came out that Jack Black would be one of the leading characters, I thought that might be a somewhat risky move, and it is my belief, though I like him a lot, there is hardly no other with as much energy as Black, he wasn't right for the part.  However, luckily, the leading man was not a man, but an ape, the king of all apes.  His (Kong's) eyes glossed wet from loneliness and pain, until that very day he met Ann (Naomi Watts).  This three plus hour movie wasn't about the actors, it was about Jackson's ability to bring emotions and life to this character of Kong.  The movie consisted of three chapters, chapter one, Jack Black trying to make it big; a sleazy guy, movie producer, willing to do anything to get his movie done-Probably ""the one"" part of this picture that took it out of Oscar nomination for best picture for the somewhat tedious set-up to Chapter two.  Chapter two, the island and the revealing of Kong.  Chapter three, the return to New York with a captured Kong.  If you know the story of King Kong, or saw the original, you ultimately know what happens.  Jackson, didn't waiver too much from the original story, he kept it a period piece.  I really don't like films like this, the innocent, the unknowing, the lost, ultimately being treated with such injustice and cruelty, however, Jackson, was able to close the chapter on this magnificent tale in a way that didn't make you feel good, but didn't necessarily make you feel so bad that you wished you had never see it.  You were too overwhelmed at this leading man's (Kong's) ability to show emotions, to take over the movie and to guide us along to new heights in the storytelling business and ultimately remembering that the good guy doesn't always win.  Of course again, you were also overwhelmed at the special effects of the movie.  If you want a movie that is overtaken by excellent special effects and superb character development of Kong, then this is the movie for you.  The secondary characters played their parts well, especially Watts ability to connect with Kong, but the movie, in a nut-shell is about Kong and if Jackson was able to pull it off-Which he did.",1143936000,3,2559,4.530434782608696

This latest version was perhaps the most excessive, resembling a caricature of all the  super-technological special effects movies to hit the modern screen, a combination of Jurassic Park, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and a host of others that pack of wallop in visual effect but lack a true theme.

Plays are perpetually being revived on Broadway for new generations so why not film?  How can you debate a remake by Peter Jackson, arguably the finest craftsman working behind the camera today.  Jackson, cognizant of the revered status that the original ""King Kong"" holds, has fashioned a homage to the original film that not only lovingly pays tribute to it but may even surpass it in the process.  Recently I viewed the original ""Kong"" after not having seen it for a number of years.  It was most certainly durable and entertaining and I marveled at the groundbreaking effects work for it's day.  That said, there were also some dated elements to the film.  To my mind, Jackson's ""Kong"" contains breathtaking effects work as well as better narrative and character development than the original.  A common complaint about Jackson's ""Kong"" was it's length.  That however is a moot point because there isn't a wasted moment in the film.  My advice to any potential viewer is to watch both films and admire their inherent qualities.  Consider us fortunate that ""Kong"" inspired two truly great films.",1143936000,,1214,4.873170731707317

Kong is so realistic and likeable, you just hate to see him die at the end. I wish Peter Jackson would've changed that for just being a new and different Kong movie.

A prequel would be awesome. Enabling the next or same director to explore Skull Island and Kong's background that much more. It could easily be a better movie, enabling to take out the boring human beginnings of the 1st movie.

A must have for people who have HD 65-inch screen TV's, like me. Better picture and clarity than the big screen movie houses.",1143936000,2,564,4.456310679611651
7602670,4,B01AHWLX2O,"Like many viewers who tire easily of the 'big whammies' that get all the media blitz, this reviewer waited to see KING KONG until the glut of audience overflow in the theaters gave way to private home DVD watching.  And then the main reason for watching it was the impressive list of good reviews here on Amazon.com and from some fellow reviewers.  Much to my surprise for a person (read curmudgeon) who doesn't usually go for sci-fi super hero action movies, I quite liked this film.  It is grossly in need of editing its 3 hour plus time frame, but the remake of the old movie is a good story well told with some fine actors making it all a joy to see.

One reason for the success of this version was director Peter Jackson's decision to keep it in the 1930s in the same time frame of the original.  The recreation of the Depression is quite effective and energizes the need to believe in this fantasy film. Naomi Watts yet again proves that even in roles opposite a computer generated Kong she can still creates illusions as an actress far better than most.  She is a fine heroine for the story.  But the choices of using Jack Black as the movie producer and Adrien Brody as the writer were VERY strong decisions.  For those who equate Jack Black with potty mouth dumb movies his performance will surprise in its sensitivity.  And then adding such fine actors as Thomas Kretschmann, Jamie Bell, Kyle Chandler, Evan Parke, John Sumner etc offers substance to the film.

Though the special effects are excellent, the middle third of the film once the crew is on Skull Island and we are endlessly confronted with hungry dinosaurs is soooooooo long that it becomes tempting to stop watching the film.  But finally we realize the purpose was giving time for Watts to create a credible relationship with Kong and all is forgiven.

The tenderness of the story makes it work and there is a lot to be said about understanding, caring, relating, greed, and animal brutality that make this film ring true.  KING KONG is simply so much better than expected that despite is excesses it still is a very good movie for all that!  Grady Harp, April 06",1143936000,6,2138,4.56282722513089
7602671,4,B01AHWLX2O,"Many people who want to see the movie are actually looking for its special effects. Like Spiderman, Batman, Hulk, War of the worlds, everyone knows the story. Why people still want to see the old old story and spend many hours for someone to tell the old old story again and again? The reason is all about arts.

For most of Peter Jackson's movies, you can randomly pick some scences to make them wall paper without modificaitons. It's just so good. Talking about shooting, the position of the camera and the movements are always so good. If you are like me who like digital photography so much, you will know how difficult to shoot those fantastic scence and make them fit the story.

Nobody including An Lee and Steven Spielberg can beat him in terms of the shooting skills and creation of fine art pictures.

Technically, the difficult to create KingKong is 1000 times more than dinosaurs and hulk stuff. If you know 3D animation like me you will know the skills to create those millions of hairs and let them move with KingKong's movement and facial expressions are just incredible. The technology in this movie is second to none.

Just like the end of the lord of rings, the beginning of the story is so long and some people don't appreciate it.

That kind of time is just like the blank in the traditional Chinese water-ink drawings or the quiet period in classical music. It just gives time to fullfill the characters and tell all the details of the story. If you really like to get involved into the fair tale story then you will understand his effort to make you in the fantacy world. But if you are just looking for some eyepopping video game like scences, those would make you yawn.

As far as the length goes (3 hrs. 8 min.), it's pretty darn perfect. Sure, there could have been a few minutes edited out, but maybe those few minutes I want out, someone else just loves. So what do you do? Anyway, part of the strength is the length, giving time for character development. Woooooow! What a awe-inspiring idea. Alright, maybe they could have cut out the ""Jimmy"" guy, but who's to say for sure. There are simply too many wannabe critics out there with short attention spans, just because there's no ""action"" right away, they feel the movie drags on, or is way too long.

Now, on to more important things, Naomi Watts, she should have been given an Oscar nomination for her role as Ann Darrow. Doing so much with so little dialogue and she lit up the screen like no one I'd ever seen.

Finally, with this DVD you can stop the movie anytime, use the restroom, go to the kitchen, blow your nose or just take some deep breathes outside, or maybe do all four. Hey, the bonus features are wonderful too. I loved the Skull Island documentary.

7602673,4,B01AHWLX2O,"The original King Kong, released in 1933, is one of the greatest motion pictures of all-time. Using state of the art technology and stop-motion camera work, the original shocked movie-goers during the Great Depression and is part of cinematic history. The 2005 remake honors its ancestor by invoking breathtaking special effects, but overall, something just feels missing about the contemporary edition of King Kong.

This is not a bad movie. It is definitely worth seeing - especially on a large, widescreen TV with surround sound speakers. This is one movie that definitely deserves to be viewed with audio and visual enhanching technology. You can view it on a standard TV, but you would definitely be missing something. The movie's action scenes make your adrenaline pump, and some scenes even make you feel as if you are in the middle of Skull Island's thick vegetation and rain forests. The special effects of King Kong are second to none, and rival those of Star Wars and Jurassic Park.

Having said that, King Kong most likely will not be the type of movie that viewers will want to watch over and over again. For starters, the movie is just too damn long (3 hours, 10 minutes). Director Peter Jackson really should have trimmed a full hour off of the movie, and the first full hour just moves along way too slow. By the time Kong makes his impressive appearance on screen, consider yourself fortunate if you are still fully awake and feel like continuing with the movie. There is plenty of action and prehistoric behemoth battle sequences while on Skull Island, but even they get repetitive and old after a while; and viewers can't help but feel that some of this should have just been left out to speed the film along.

The film's climax in New York City is spectacular. There is nothing like seeing the 50 foot gorilla atop the Empire State Building beating his chest and telling a squadron of primitive fighter planes to ""Bring it on!"" This is hands down the best part of the film.

All in all, it feels as if you are watching three different movies: The Jack Black/setting sail/high seas segment (hour 1), Skull Island (hour 2) and New York City (hour 3). Fortunately, the movie does have some nice emotional scenes between Kong and Naomi Watts, giving it a balance between emotion and adrenaline.

The special effects are so good, in fact, that in all honesty, King Kong is really one of those movies that NEEDS to be watched in the theater (rather than on your living room TV). You definitely missed out if you didn't see it in the theaters, but if you watch it at home, be sure to rent it first.",1143936000,2,2611,4.667391304347826
7602674,1,B01AHWLX2O,"3+ hours for a 60 minute story...Peter Jackson went far beyond the deep end with special effects that were there for no purpose beyond, well, having special effects because, darn it, he could have them. Stick with the original - the effects may be primative, but they served a real purpose. And where the characters actually evoked real relationships with each other. The cardboard acting between Adrian Brody and Naomi Watts was stupendous in its lack of chemistry. Then there was the scene between Kong and Watts in which her character suddenly bursts into such a wide array of...heck, I still can't figure it out. But is certainly was embarrassing.

It is a sad day when the the best actor in the movie was the animation of Kong. Without a doubt this was top notch. I truly felt sorry when Kong finally slipped away at the end. (Fans of Cameron's Titanic might remember how DiCaprio's character finally slipped away into the void, and Kong's last breath was not only reminiscent of that but seemed to have been stolen from it.) But even Kong's heroic acting ability, down to the very end, was decimated by Jackson's inability to keep excess in check.

I'm amazed that a director who actually believes he was born to direct King Kong could do the story such a major disservice...I liked the Lord of the Rings trilogy...I had been hoping Kong would demonstrate an ability to trim some of the tendency to excess from those movies, but it was not to be. It wasn't Kong that really went off the deep end in the end - it was Jackson all along.",1143936000,12,1540,4.596363636363637
7602675,3,B01AHWLX2O,"Maybe it would be best going in to see this movie without trying to compare it to either the 1933 or 1976 versions.  Go in with the idea that it will be entertaining, and you won't be all that disappointed.

As with most of the movies made today, special effects seem to trump mediocre acting, miscasting, and weak story lines.  This holds true for the most part in this vision of King Kong, although in contrast to the main stars, the supporting cast (the ship's captain, first mate and other character-type actors) were very good and ""right on the money.""

This film takes the tack of making a great tale of terror into an inter-species love story.  This is the major tack that punctured 1976's King Kong, deflating it into an utter loser (although King Kong 1976's acting and special effects contributed somewhat to its failure, as well).

King Kong 2005 also holds possibly the two defining moments of movie idiocy, and both should have been left on the cutting room floor.  The first was the Ann Darrow character doing vaudeville routines and juggling for Kong.  It gave me the impression she was KONG's pet monkey throughout the rest of the film.  The second moment of asinine antics was a kid shooting prehistoric bugs off the body of another character - with a Thompson submachine gun, yet!  The guy with the bugs was left unscathed.  And you thought TV's Sgt Saunders from ""Combat"" was good with HIS tommy gun, eh?  These two prize scenes should have been relegated to the ""deleted scenes"" feature of some DVD so it wouldn't be necessary to cringe during the movie.

The original King Kong (1933) was truly a story of terror and the only love aspect was between Ann Darrow and Jack Driscoll.  King Kong was a ""force of nature"" that was possession-obsessed with Ann (imagine a mean, 25-foot tall stalker) and Ann was TERRIFIED of him all the way through to the Empire State Building!  The 1933 King Kong was the type of movie that, afterward, gave you the willies every time you looked out a window at night - expecting to see a big hairy face with blazing eyes glaring back at you.  Both the 1976 and 2005 King Kong flicks failed in this aspect.

Although this was definitely a ""labor of love"" by Mr. Peter Jackson, and it does succeed on some levels, I really hope the next re-make of King Kong gets us ""back to the basics.""  If you have the Jurassic Park series, you may want to include King Kong 2005 with them.  You can still keep the original 1933 King Kong on its own pedestal.",1143936000,2,2492,4.534675615212528

Firstly , the characters are boring and the casting is unbelievably attrocious. Albiet Jack Black and Niomi Watts retain a sence of interest...the rest of the cast could be easilly replaced by the original members of that 70's show "" CHiPs"". I wouldn't have noticed a thing. The best thing going for this film , is the special effects. King Kong in his natural habitat is a scene to behold. Especially when he's in action. It's just too bad that it's 2 hrs. into the second act , before we get to see him. JAckson makes good use of the 8th wonder , by maximizing the time we spend with the monkey. I truly began to feel a strange sense of compassion for King Kong. Unfortunately we had to go back to the supporting characters and my interest wained. I think King Kong will be great for kids between the ages of 3 and 15. Beyond that , you should either watch the original or the Jessica Lange/ Jeff Bridges version. Even , Mighty Joe Young. But if you're looking for an action packed blockbuster film...Tis ain't the one. Twas beauty killed the beast ? I think not.

To the preservationists who say that one should only re-make bad movies...not good ones...think this: One should re-make old good movies and make them as good or better. That's what this film accomplishes.

King Kong 2005 (preserved circa 1933 in living color with today's style FX) retains the original's storyline to the tee, but gives this classic a beautiful 21st century treatment.

It's 3 hours long. The first hour is a bit (unnecessarily) character development heavy. But the action filled subsequent 2 hours makes this version of the classic well worth the price of purchase. The 2005 version of King Kong is as true to the original story as a preservationist could possibly ask, and it keeps the viewer captivated as if seeing the true 8th Wonder of the World for the first time ever.

If you're thinking that this could be another attempt similar to the atrocious 1976 debacle re-make of King Kong think again. All of the impressionable scenes and impressionable lines from the 1933 story are preserved. And some great scenes are added that movie magic could not have possibly imagined back when the original was shot.

So for a re-make, this is tops. From a director that knows how to weave a terrific story.

Action fans, don't pass on this. Monster movie fans, don't pass on this. Preservationists, don't pass on this.

King Kong 2005 is as classic as its 1933 original.",1143849600,,1500,4.813229571984436

Naiomi is a bit too WIDE eyed through out the film, would have appreciated a bit more chat toward Kong but o-well. A bit over the top in a few scenes, but hey, this is the story of a huge ape, anything goes. Jackson captures the emotions big time. Hell, I started welling up as soon as Kong sees his love walking toward him in slow motion in New York. And the finale, just hand me a tissue, end of story.

I was expecting some good special effects hense me being a LOTR's fan, well thats what i got but in way to big of a dose. The action sequences in this film are just WAY to drawn out, dinosaurs falling like a pile of linebackers all over one another, people being jerked around, falling, swinging all over the place. Even the fight scenes of Kong vs. the T-rex got realllly old after the first 2 minutes. Computer special effects are really something amazing these days, but a lot of time i'd rather see things done the old fashion way, or just see the idea of less is more. Perhaps that's why i usually don't rent large computerized action movies like, The Matrix, Spiderman, Batman Begins, Fantastic Four, this etc. Maybe age is catching up with me but at this point i prefer pyschological horror, or just a good mystery(drama), the movies now are just to over the top with CGI, and long drawn out 15 minute+action sequences. The story in this movie is probably the reason i never really watched the orginal KK movies, just didn't interest me, still doesnt. Also i've never really been a fan of the 30's era, even if it is action packed. I will say yes that Peter Jackson has once again made something pretty epic, its just a bit TO epic for my tastes.

7602682,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Wow. That's one word that leaps to mind here. I finally watched Peter Jackson's King Kong for the first time, and I feel like I've been slapped around some. I've heard some great and not-so great comments made about this film, and I noticed the box office, while very healthy, wasn't quite up to industry predictions. I waited to see the film on DVD, where I could pay close attention to detail and to the story. The detail is amazing. Depression-era New York is vividly re-created here, and Skull Island is a nightmare made real. Kong himself, the main lead, is astounding. Credit goes again to the magicians at Weta Digital. They are this generations Industrial Light and Magic. The story, though well-worn and retold, is very well played. The films length, one major drawback according to many people I've spoken with, really wasn't an issue with me. I felt the pace moved quite well, tho somewhat sluggishly at first. the tempo kicks up quite a bit with the arrival at Skull Island, and doesn't really stop from there. In fact, some sequences were almost too intense for comfort, inducing some pronounced squirming from yours truly. The scenes I found to be truly perfect were the scenes involving Ann Darrow and Kong alone. The sequence in the park in New York, on the frozen lake, was wonderful. You could feel the playfulness of Kong, and the happiness of Ann, so acutely here, which is tragically balanced by the end sequence atop the Empire State building. The casting was superb for the part of Ann Darrow. Naomi Watts does on amazing job here, conveying so much through her eyes and motions. Jack Black was an interesting choice, and he does a creditable job. Adrien Brody really doesn't have that meaty a role, and does what he can with it, so no real complaints there. I wondered if Peter Jackson was slightly off to go after a legendary tale like King Kong. I know it was his favorite movie as a child, and his real stimulus to be a film-maker, but King Kong has been retold before, and the 1976 remake was not very good. However, Mr. Jackson has re-imagined Kong in a new, fresh way, and breathed life back into the old story. This was really first-rate story-telling using all the latest technology, without the tech overwhelming the basic tale. What an experience this film is.",1143849600,2,2294,4.666666666666667

7602686,5,B01AHWLX2O,"King Kong is another of Peter Jackson's epic movies.  While the plot-on the surface-doesn't seem like it is worthy of being called and epic (nor was its length, originally), Jackson has made it one.  The plot is sprawling, but not to a bad point.  Although it contains many elements of a drama, it doesn't get bogged down.  There is constant tension and conflict on many levels.

There are three real parts to the plot (following the classic plot structure-beginning-middle-end): meeting the characters and getting to know them in Manhattan and on the ship, Skull Island, and Kong in Manhattan.

Now, granted, Jackson didn't conjure up the plot out of nowhere, but he sure as heck improved it.  I have seen Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies, but I haven't really had a chance to pick them apart and really watch them.  So I was really surprised by Jackson's ability to layer the plot and add many different ironies.

I am an avid Hitchcock fan, so I am used to really analyzing movies and paying much attention to the details.  Many directors disappoint me on this level, but Jackson surpassed all my expectations.  Hitchcock took every one of his films (to the best of my knowledge) from a novel or story.  Thus, like Jackson in Kong, Hitchcock already had a plot and story to work from, allowing him to focus his time on improving the plot and paying much attention to detail.  This seems to be the case with Jackson in Kong.

Here are some of the different layers that I picked up on.  When we first see the native girl on the island, she holds her hand up with her palm facing down.  Later, after Kong and Anne Darrow meet and get to know each other, Kong stretches out his hand with his palm facing upward.  This point is made even more significant when you think of what each wanted-the natives wanted to offer Anne up as a sacrifice while Kong wanted to pick Anne up to hold on to her.

Also, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) says that Carl Denham (Jack Black) ""destroys the things that he loves"" (or something to that effect).  That comment was obviously intended to apply to Kong, who, in that scene is looking pitiful on stage.  But it can also be applied to Anne Darrow, whose life was destroyed because of Denham-as well as many in his crew.

Another point would be that in the beginning of the movie, Anne's theater closes.  One of the characters says ""The show is over,"" or something to that effect.  This leads directly to the line ""The show must go on,"" and it does, later in the movie with the eighth wonder of the world.

The story really has something for everyone without stretching itself too thin.  Often I think that many movies fail because they try to be everything to everyone.  But Kong really succeeds here.  It is probably one of the only movies to combine drama and action/suspense so perfectly.

The characters were well created.  Some reviewers claim that the first hour of the movie dragged.  It did not drag.  Granted, the focus was a little more on drama, but it was necessary.  That first part of the movie established the characters, the setting and the period wonderfully.  Jackson knew what he was doing.

My only gripe here was Carl Denham.  While Jack Black's performance was really well done, I think some of his dialogue didn't really fit.  For instance, when the camera man was killed by the dinosaur, Denham says (in an identical line to the one used earlier), ""We'll donate our profits to his wife and kids.""  This comical line would work in another movie but not here.  It just was not realistic.  If the line had been changed or altered slightly, it would have worked.  Denham's obsession was really a fascinating part of the story.

The actors (and actresses) gave outstanding performances.  Naomi Watts really put her heart into this movie.  She deserves at very least an Academy Award nomination for her performance.  Andy Serkis created a Kong with some heart and soul.  Adrien Brody, Jack Black and the other actors gave great performances as well.

The music was very moving and powerful.  I liked how they used symphonic music as well as the period, jazzy songs in the movie.  I'm definitely going to get a hold of the sound track for this movie.

The cinematography was excellent.  Jackson really likes to use half-frame (or slower) shots.  I felt that some uses of the slow-mo shots were overdone, but most were very well done.  The cinematography sometimes reminded me of Lord of the Rings with its epic, wide-angle shots.

All in all this is one of the best movies I've seen recently.",1143849600,,4540,4.62406015037594
7602687,4,B01AHWLX2O,"No doubt this King Kong is more realistic than any of the preceding ones.

7602690,5,B01AHWLX2O,"King Kong is an amazing epic adventure that's not just one of the year's best remakes, but one of the year's best films. Director Peter Jackson has created one of the most intense and exciting adventure films I've ever seen. Everything about King Kong is first rate, from the cast, to the music, the production design and costumes to the amazing special effects. The film follows fairly closely to the 1933 original, but Jackson certainly adds his own personal touches here and there. He's able to dazzle us with the gorgeous visuals, but also keep us emotionally interested in the story and characters. Peter Jackson really is the kind of filmmaker that George Lucas wishes he was, that's right I said it. Why? Because you can clearly tell that Jackson's passionate love and respect for the material is what drives him to make a great film; he's just a boy with all the toys in the world, and is certainly having a ball with King Kong.

King Kong starts off in New York City during the Great Depression. People are homeless, starving, and looking for hope. Among the suffering is Ann Darrow, played by the beautiful Naomi Watts, she's a stage actress who's play is suffering and before you know it she's out of a job, and her theater is shut down. That's when she meets Carl Denham, played by Jack Black, a dedicated and persistently ambitious filmmaker in search of a hit. He convinces Ann to accompany him and his crew to set sail to a mysterious place named Skull Island that may or may not even exist, so he can shoot his next picture. On board the ship, which is appropriately named Venture, she meets Jack Driscoll, played by Adrian Brody, a play writer who Ann's greatly admired, and Jack is instantly attracted to Ms. Darrow.

They discover the mysterious island bathed in fog one night, nearly crashing ashore. They set foot on the island and are attacked by a hoard of creepy natives, and Ann is captured and served as a sacrifice to Kong. From this point onward the entire film is one massive and intense spectacle after another. I don't want to spoil any thing but let's just say that it involves a large variety of dinosaurs, nasty bugs, huge bats, and pretty much anything slimy that your imagination can conjure up. The rest of the story is pretty much the classic tale that everybody knows; the beautiful actress befriends the beast, then is captured and brought to the Big Apple, where mayhem ensues.

King Kong impressed me on such a high level for virtually the entire film; I was swept away and enthralled in the adventure. I didn't mind at all that the film was over three hours long, if it had been longer I really wouldn't have minded (no butt ache here, I was having so much fun). King Kong in my book deserved to get a few more Oscar nominations than what it got, because the direction was amazing, the writing was great, the music was thrilling, but also Naomi Watts' performance was really something as well. Simply put... I LOVED this film. King Kong is another dazzling epic from Academy Awarding winning Director Peter Jackson, and here he reminds us once again that he certainly deserves that title.

7602693,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Okay, now that Peter Jackson has created the definitive KING KONG, no one else should even try it again.  This is an awesome filmmaking achievement, with some of the best special effects ever captured on the screen.  We all know the story, so it was up to Jackson to create a new vision of the tale and that he has done.  Although the movie starts slowly, once they reach Skull Island, the movie never lets up:  Kong vs. the Tyrannosaures is brilliant, especially the dizzying battle on the hanging vines; the terrifying bug attacks; the finale on the Empire State Building which is both terrifying and poignantly touching; the dinosaur stampede; it's all beautifully done.  Naomi Watts shines as Ann Darrow, the beauty to the giant beast.  Watts captures the fervor in which the relationship develops, and of course using Andy Sirkis digitally as Kong is pure genius.  He gives Kong a truly individual personality never captured in either of the first two films.  Adrian Brody is good as the writer who shares Ann's passion for the beast.  Only Jack Black as Denham is miscast, and although ineffectual, he doesn't hurt the movie.  Wonder why they didn't go for a better actor in this role?

Anyway, KING KONG is everything a big Hollywood movie should be and the Oscars while honoring ""message"" films this year, failed to recognize the most entertaining and technically superior film of all this year--KING KONG.",1143763200,,1414,4.85
7602694,3,B01AHWLX2O,"This is, without a doubt, the silliest movie ever. It's made by Peter Jackson, of Lord of the Rings fame after all, so we must give him credit and respect for perhaps the longest action sequence ever filmed: about 45 minutes of people fleeing stampeding dinosaurs, getting squashed by thundering feet, falling over cliffs, clutching hanging vines, swinging into dripping jaws, clunking into a valley of mud, getting sucked up by mucky slugs, and fighting off giant spiders, beetles, and mosquitoes. Our heroine, clutched in Kong's palm, is shaken and tossed while he fends dinosaurs, lizards, bats, and plunges over several cliffs. You hear her cry ""ugh, oh,"" and you see her little blonde head bobbing about, but when she finally lands, she still looks pretty and doesn't need a whiplash collar at all. The CG dinosaurs and Kong are amazing: especially when you look at the old King Kong from the 30s with beasts that are so fake you have to laugh. That's all well and good, if action is what you want. But then, in classic Peter Jackson fashion, you have about 30 minutes of slogging melodramatic conclusion. Poor Kong, as we know, gets shot down, when he was after all, despite being very scary-looking, a really sweet guy who happened to fall in love with a human being. (I shouldn't even mention the fact that his member would be longer than she is tall.) Anyhow, we get these endless shots of our girl looking piteously at Kong, and Kong looking sadly at her. Then back to her, and back to Kong. And again. And again. Jackson seems to shout behind the camera: ""Are you crying yet? Not yet? How about some stirring strings to make you weep? How about some more wistful gazes? How about slow motion as Kong plunges toward making his hit on Broadway?"" This is, after all, a fake gorilla. It's touching, but we are not talking about anything remotely ""real"" here. Pumping the audience is just too absurd, and ruins the whole movie. Besides, all those kids who came for the action, are they throwing spitballs at each other by the time this thing finally ends?",1143763200,2,2061,4.680440771349862
7602695,2,B01AHWLX2O,"As a long time movie buff and historian, I am amused at how far off base Amazon's Mark Englehart and other reviewers can be. It appears to me that many of these reviews were planted to drive up sales. Peter Jackson's version of King Kong is disappointing on many levels as most everyone I have spoken to agrees.

Mr Jackson whose exemplary work on the LOTR series is missing here because the script is lacking and suffering from what appears to be heavy editing.  This is supposed to be the classic story of beauty and the beast. Instead, this version is about how many special effects can be crammed into three hours, at the grave expense of story line and character development.  The answer is, a whole lot of special effects!

We are supposed to believe that the Adrien Brody character has fallen madly in love with Naomi Watts after only one badly edited scene. The scene cuts away harshly from a romantic kiss to Mr Brody speaking to another character in another time and place.  Based on this one shortened scene, we are supposed to believe that Mr. Brody will risk his life and ultimately climb the empire state building to rescue his true love.  Am I the only one who doesn't buy any of this?

The scenes with dinosaurs, bugs and other hideous creatures are too long and way too scary for children, who should have loved this film if not made to be so terrifying.  These elongated and sometimes repulsive scenes were left in apparently instead of any real character development.  Who is the audience Mr. Jackson is targeting here?  Special effects / action freaks only it appears.

The biggest let down of all is the relationship of Kong and Naomi Watts, who is an actress of great merit and does her best with what she is given.  Sadly, the majority of what she is given is an angry and violent Kong who is very unlikeable.  The only real scene that shows any tenderness prior to Kong's demise is that of the two watching a beautiful sunset.  In the 1933 version, we feel great empathy toward Kong, but in Jackson's version he is a mean destructive beast who actually eats a man alive. Aren't apes vegetarians?

In conclusion, the special effects are tremendous as is the photograghy and sound. If only Mr. Jackson would have remembered to include ""the story"".  When Jack Black utters the classic closing line: ""no, it was beauty who killed the beast"", we just don't buy it.  Unless you are a techno geek interested in special effects, watch this one when is comes on cable and ""don't buy it"". Buy instead the 1933 classic, which remains the only true version of a great story.",1143763200,4,2586,4.574837310195227

First off let me say the movie was great. Awesome special effects of Kong, Dinos, Scenery,  Etc...got a little hokey at times, but still very enjoyable. My main gripe is to Universal Pictures. From what I have read, this movie received Oscars for Best Sound & Best Sound Editing.....why did they NOT pass this on to us??? Anybody looking for DTS/EX sound(or better) can forget it. This was actually filmed in DTS sound quality, as ALL movies of this budget and magnitude are.  I purchased the ""Special Edition"" expecting the great sound quality. I should have known when the box did not boast of it. I have a feeling that Universal will release a ""4 Disc"" Special Edition a year from now and claim ""Now Available in DTS"" so they can make a few extra bucks.

Over-All I give the movie ""TWO THUMBS UP"" and I give Universal Pictures ""TWO THUMBS DOWN"". Very disappointing to those of us who are used to buying even lower budget DVD movies in excellent sound quality.",1143676800,3,1123,4.577114427860696
7602701,3,B01AHWLX2O,"Ok, I wanted to see this movie in a big way. I don't go out to movies much because I don't think it's worth it. This is one of those movies I had to see. I was a big fan of the original. I even liked the one with Charles Grodon. Yeah I thought it was funny. The most important thing to me in watching this remake was for Dinosaur fights with Kong. I have been a serious monster movie fan since I was a kid. I saw every Claymation/Men in rubber suite movie I could. Godzilla is still King! The only recent movie that had a cool Dino fight was Jurassic Park 3. I loved it and wanted more so to hear about not one, but three T-Rex's fighting Kong was awesome! Well, for the most part I liked the fight scene. I agree that three Rex's was a bit much however that's not my main complaint. I would love if the editors or whoever was primarily responsible for that scene could have watched it more and considered keeping the cameras focused a bit longer. More static cameras and not so much fast jerky movement. I so wanted to soak in a childhood dream come true, but the camera kept jumping from one perspective to another and moving point of view so fast I kept wishing it would stop. I also agree with a previous review concerning Kong being seriously bit with little damage. I also think Kong delt some serious blows with his powerful punches and I was sure he at least took one of those Rex's out! But no! I wanted to like the movie and that particular scene more than I did. My other gripes are the natives. What kind of freaks were they? And that brontosaurus scene, I thought it was stupid. Also, did someone else have the task of producing that? The mix of live actors and Dino's looked phony. I was so shocked by that. A big budget movie like this should at least get that right. Movies seem to have that kind of effect nailed these days. I also prefer the reveal of Kong in the first two Kong movies. Of course the beginning was too long. I heard it was too long and thought it wouldn't be that bad, but it  was. I didn't care for the giant bugs and worms. That could have been done better. What did I like? I liked Kong and Naomi Watts. I had no problem with her and Kong having a bond on the island. It made sense that she realized she needed him to protect her. Why she seemed to like Kong more than Jack I didn't get. So I liked much of the movie, but alot could have been done better or different. I'm still waiting for a great computer generated dinosaur fight with great editing and directing.",1143676800,,2504,4.162886597938145
7602702,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Not to belittle the other Kong movies out there, including the 1930's version, which was pretty good for its time, but this movie had everything you could ask for. Okay, so someone REALLY wouldn't be that good with a machine gun to shoot bugs off of someone, even if they were gigantic, but. . .

At first I didn't think Jack Black (Carl Denham) was going to make the grade in this movie, but as I continued to watch his character evolve into someone not ready to fall on the floor and wiggle like a giant beetle (School of Rock), I think he came out with flying colors. I was hoping Naomi Watts' character would punch him in the face at the end, but . . . Hey, you can't have everything.

The sensationalism/special effects, call them what you will were there and right on cue throughout the entire movie. They were part of the story and rock solid, unlike many of the others, which were there only to sell tickets and leave you scratching your head when it was over. Ala The Mummy! Give me a break! How powerful can a zombie wrapped in gauze be?

The movie is quite long 3hrs 8min, but I found it was worth every moment of it and not just a waste of valuable life and time. King Kong 2005 is now in my library of dvd's and I'm glad of it.",1143676800,,1240,4.179916317991632

Aside from that I didn't like the part of Ann defending the Ape.  It seemed too pro-ecology and politically correct for the 1930's.  America was not politically correct in the 1930's or in the original movie.  Let's keep it that way in the remake.  There should of been more of an attraction between Driscol and Ann.  He should of married her and had Kong steal her against her will.  The part of Ann dancing for Kong was stupid it reminded me of the hideous 1970's version.

Denham should of been more likeable.  He seemed like such a rascal.

The special effects were great, but come on 3 t-rexs.  Less is more should be the key to this movie.  The plot development leading to Skull island was way to long. Another thing this movie did not do was make it suspenseful when they are going through the island.  The original had you on the edge of your seat.  What were they going to see next?

Ann trying to rescue the ape at the empire state building was stupid and also reminded me of the hideous 1970's version.

7602705,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I won't rehash what most of the previous reviewers have said about this film, except to say some of them were right on target, and some of them totally missed the point. Remember, a ""review"" is, in the end, just one person's opinion. How can you review ANY film and expect everyone else to agree with that opinion? Answer....you simply can NOT! You can not decree that your likes or dislikes must be written in stone to which all others must adhere. That said, I'll share my reactions:

One reviewer wondered why Kong would favor Ann over the countless other ""sacrifices"" he'd been offered through the years? DUH!!! Think about it! All he'd had were ""native"" girls, year after year. Then one day, his ""bride"" turns up having blonde hair and blue eyes! And, eyes that actually looked BACK at him. Don't you think the other damsels were either drugged into oblivion, or, at least, prepared for the honor of being Kong's bride from generations of such tradition. Now, here comes some sober blue eyes with some fight to her. Kong is fascinated by this new ""toy"", and instead of ripping her head off like some spoiled child with a toy he's tired of, is delighted with a new favorite. Political correctness aside, Ann become Kong's pet. And, as our pets become a part of our family, so too does Ann become Kong's family. And, he will protect her to his death. I really can't believe that reviewer didn't get this. At any rate......

I do agree the film is too long, but, it is still totally entertaining. I think too much time was spent in the jungle with too many showcases for too many creatures. Yes, the brontosaurus stampede was thrilling, but...was it crucial to the story? Yes, the insect pit, even deleted from the original Kong, was gripping, but...was it crucial to the story? Perhaps the only ""creature feature"" that WAS crucial to the story (as it is seen), would be the T-Rex sequence. And, this because Kong is protecting Ann from them, establishing even further how Kong would endanger himself to protect Ann from harm.

I won't counter other points made in previous reviews, but I do have to concur with the majority of them in that the special effects are seamless, and absolutely wondrous. Jackson has made 30's New York City into a time-warp wonder! Exquisite work! As is Skull Island, both in front of, and behind, the wall. But, the true wonder of the entire film is Kong. The marriage of Andy Serkis' live action work, with CGI actually makes Kong a living creature, complete with expressions and personality. And, with Kong being such a real character, the interaction between him and Ann becomes as real as it would between any two ""live"" actors. Now, where Jackson's Kong soars way and beyond the original is here - there IS a relationship between them. In the original, Fay Wray spent the entire film trying to get away from Kong.....even in the final act. There was no ""love"" lost for her. In Jackson's version, Ann comes to really love Kong as he loves her. I am touched just thinking about Ann reaching out to caress Kong. What must Kong be thinking? Had any one or any thing ever literally touched him with love before? Had he LET any one or anything touch him before? Since words can not be empolyed, the bond between any ""animal"" and human is a profound one because it is based totally upon trust, compassion, and the unspoken communication of love. For me, I completely bought into the love between Ann and Kong, which made the end of the film heartwrenching for me. So, if the success of a film is measured by the degree it touches the viewer, this film hit the bullseye! It is truly THE best remake ever - far outdistancing itself from the original!!!",1143676800,,3680,4.615267175572519
7602706,4,B01AHWLX2O,"O.k., so I am one of those people that believe that the first third of the movie was a bit slow, and brought in unnecessary elements into the story line. But rest assured, once the monkey shows up, ""It's Showtime, Folks!"". The CGI in this film is staggering, especially where Kong is concerned. I was riveted on him from the first moment he shows himself, until the bitter end. For all intents and purposes, watching Kong in this movie is a virtual study in low land gorilla behavior and mannerisms. So real is this creature that you actually find yourself in his corner emotionally, throughout the film. There's a connection with Kong that none of the preceding ""King Kong"" movies could even come close to rivaling. And strangely, this is the first ""Kong"" movie that I didn't fall in love with the female lead, and perhaps for no other reason than the fact that she's pretty much been upstaged by her 25 ft. CGI co-star,.....he was THAT good!!

There were some parts of the film that seemed inserted purely to be a promo for the King Kong video game that followed the theater release, but even that didn't dampen my anticipation for my next peek at the ape. You also won't find any radical twists in the same old story line followed by its predecessors, but again, Kong is such a visual treat, you won't mind.

So sit back and enjoy! It may just be the only time you ever fall in love with a monkey.",1143676800,,1400,4.46484375

They could have at least shown us how they did it! It would have been a great scene loaded with more tension as they try not to wake him up! I don't think that boat was equipped to handle a 25 ft gorilla. Don't get me wrong - I loved the effects, Naomi Watts was amazing in her scenes with Kong and the last hour was spectacular...but I'd rather Jackson had chopped off 1/2 from the front and shown us how the crew handled transporting him back.",1143676800,4,586,4.104347826086957
7602708,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I don't use that word in normal discourse, but this movie is certainly deserving of it.

The effects are simply masterful. Kong is a REAL character, created and brought to life with the magic of CGI. The movements are thoroughly ape-like and Kong is given a unique personality. The imagination that went into this is unreal. The other inhabitants of Skull Island are also extremely impressive. Jackson and crew have created a surreal prehistoric land of mystery and wonder. Truly amazing.

The drama is touching, as experienced in the relationship shared by Kong and Ann. There are a few scenes in this movie that are immensely moving, such as when Kong is captured on Skull Island, when Kong discovers ice amidst his chase through the city and, of course, Kong's final stand atop the Empire State Building. You will truly feel for this beast who has been horribly exploited by man. All he wants is to care for and protect Ann and yet because of the greed of man, he now faces impossible odds for his own survival. The final scene is done wonderfully. I mean, you really feel a sense of impending dread as you watch Kong corner himself to be alone with and care for Ann. It's quite tragic.

This is a staggering movie achievement.

The bonus disc includes hours of material.  There is a featurette concerning the history of Skull Island, a featurette about 1933 New York City and the Post-Production Diaries, covering all areas of post-production of this film.  The making of this epic tale was an amazing undertaking - and it has all been well-documented. The bonus disc provides great supplemental material that is worth seeing.",1143676800,14,1630,4.782918149466192
7602709,5,B01AHWLX2O,"`King Kong', the second remake by master fantasy director, Peter Jackson is a major improvement over the first remake (which, however, is not quite as bad as some may have said), but somehow, it does not quite manage to outdo the impact of the original, when you pro-rate the advances in special effects technology against the great impression made by the original.

To the good, I must say that unlike so many other movies, the trailer gives just the tip of the iceberg of special effects gee whiz impact. Many scenes which never made it to the trailer are even more impressive than the highlights. Most impressive is the brontosaurus stampede and Kong's fistfight with three T Rexs while swinging from a tangle of vines while simultaneously holding Naomi Watts in his right palm. Even better may be his interpretation of the natives on Skull Island. In the original and in the first remake, the natives seem more like Jackson's recreation of the natives on the Broadway stage than like a true primitive tribe living in the shadow of a collection of bloodthirsty prehistoric monsters. Jackson's version of these feral primitives may be his most creative change to the images created in the original and left largely untouched by the first remake. In fact, all the business between the landing on Skull Island and the contact between Kong and Watts is a major improvement over the first two movies. The set adds a moat between the prehistoric wall and the part of the island where the monsters lived. It also solves the problem of why the natives even bothered to venture into this region beyond the wall even for the short time needed to  place the sacrifice to Kong. It does not, however, solve the problem of what Kong wants with these young female `brides' as he is obviously still a vegetarian.

The main question, however, is why the movie did not make a bigger impression in the theatre when it was released late last year, given the enormous prerelease buildup, the cachet of being the remake of one of the most important movie fantasies of all time, and the bump from the 11 Academy Award sweep from `Lord of the Rings, Return of the King' in 2003. There are two easy reasons. First, this is a remake, so most of the credit for the story and most of the images which were invented in the original movie and simply enhanced by Jackson and his crew. Second, this is easily seen as simply a clever action fantasy story, while `Lord of the Rings' involved an epic battle between good and evil, spearheaded not by a crew armed with guns and modern chemicals, but with simple grit and courage. Another possible explanation for its less than expected impact is the fact that the fourth Harry Potter movie and the first installment in Disney's Narnia franchaise came out, which was a truer successor to the `Lord of the Rings' aura than the `King Kong' story.

The most common complaint I read about this new `King Kong' is that it was simply too long. I agree with this, adding to it that some of the new scenes on Skull Island, especially those involving some fantastical new creatures and the oversized insects simply do nothing to move the story forward. That the original movie did such a great job of telling its story in about 90 minutes makes one wonder why Jackson couldn't match them scene for scene and be done with it. It is understandable that he wants to be seen as improving on the original, but since he does that in so many demonstrable ways, why draw it out as well.

One improvement which works is Naomi Watts' business with Kong on Skull Island and her relation with the big ape in general. This takes some additional time, but not much. Another improvement is the change in Carl Denham's situation before he leaves New York. This change works well with casting Jack Black as Denham. Black fits the scoundrel's role far better than an Indiana Jones hero type actor. While interesting, Jackson's opening miniature feature on the contrast between New York wealth and depression poverty is very well done, but it contributes little to the story. Since we've seen it all before, we don't really need to be reminded of the fact that the story takes place at the height of the depression. I'm almost disappointed Jackson didn't make something of the fact that the Empire State Building was just finished early in the depression years, and the action takes place (maybe) while the building is not even completed.

The greatest benefit of the new effects technology, much of it created by Jackson's own effects company for `Lord of the Rings', is the characterization of Kong, done by computer enhancement of a live actor (Andy Serkis, who is best known for being the voice and business behind the Gollum character). This improved one of the few drawbacks of the original primitive effects in that the `claymation' style of animation left its traces on the Kong model fur.

While Serkis makes a major improvement in the characterization of Kong, I really had a hard time seeing Watts' performance as an improvement over both Fay Wray AND Jessica Lange, who, at the time of her appearance in King Kong 2, was seen as simply a new dumb blond. I prefer to think that Lange was giving us an excellent performance of a character who was a dumb blond and thereby made a major improvement on Fay Wray's characterization. The improvements in Watts' character are due less to her impromement over Lange or Wray as an actor but in the improved additions to her business by the writers and director.

I am really happy that Jackson decided to recreate the original rather than, like the first remake, recast the plot with a different motive for visiting Skull Island. I think he would have done an even better job at cutting back on some of his `improvements' but not on his most basic changes to Denhan's character and motives.

This version has few extras, certainly none which substantially improve the experience of viewing the movie.",1143676800,3,5940,4.709335899903754

The expedition discovers a 25-foot gorilla that falls for the beautiful actress. ""King Kong"" is an outstanding visually dazzling thrill ride. The 188-minute remake remains quite faithful to the original film. The story feels over the top but certainly engrossing. The 2005 adventure film truly grabs the audience with its heart-pounding action sequences, good performances, elaborate backgrounds and sensational special effects.

""King Kong"" received overwhelming positive reviews from US critics, grossed over $550 million worldwide and won three Academy Awards (Visual Effects, Sound Mixing and Sound Editing).

If you really enjoyed this action-packed remake of the 1933 fantasy classic in theaters, then check out ""King Kong"" on DVD. The three-hour blockbuster is presented in its theatrical 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains a splendid video transfer with bright colors and terrific resolution.

Nothing wrong with that--as soon as I heard they had Naomi Watts I knew this movie would be a cut above.  But over the course of 3 hours there should be some other memorable characters and there aren't.  Jack Black and the others are ok but anybody could have been substituted and it wouldn't have made any difference.

That's why, when its over, everybody remembers the Anne, Kong and the special effects.  The rest is pretty much filler.  My guess is, its Peter Jackson's ego and he has to embellish everything from the original, just to show that more is better.",1143590400,,730,4.526717557251908
7602712,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I am very impressed with Peter Jackson's remake of KING KONG.  He captured the correct essence of the characters while remaining true and capturing the essence of the old 1933 classic.  With stunning visual effects and cinematography; I find this film a natural beauty.

Skull island a place where the 'flop-film maker' and his crew travel to shoot a motion picture turns out to be a place of horror;

Great cast includes:

Andy Serkis who did KING KONG's bodily movement thru motion capture and also plays Lumpy the cook.

Naomi Watts and Adrian Brody who do outstanding work, and Jack Black who plays the 'eccentric director' is very humorous as he is obsessed with shooting his film so that he will just about risk anything to get a good shot.

Others (I'm not sure of the actors names) include the 'vain actor', Jimmy the kid that works on the ship (as seen in Billy Eliot), and the natives are just fantastic...

It's a great movie with a great cast and screen play;

I don't want to give any spoilers away for those who haven't seen the movie; however I must warn that it is a very LONG movie- but definitely worth your time.",1143590400,,1131,4.532019704433497
7602713,3,B01AHWLX2O,"A lot of people tend to say one thing about Hollywood remakes: why? What for? When you have an original that's easily a classic, there almost seems little point to revisit. Peter Jackson said King Kong was his inspiration to be a filmmaker so maybe it's a case of the student trying to become the teacher? A way of saying ""thanks""? An update? I don't know but as it stands the film is pretty good entertainment with large amount of flaws all over the place.

You all know the story but I must repeat it. Carl Denham is a filmmaker who is not delivering on his films. He decides to get out quickly on a filmmaking chance of a lifetime but he needs an actress. He finds Ann Darrow, a struggling vaudeville actress. Bringing her in, they head toward the mysterious Skull Island where more than just locals roam.

Officially the film won for Best Visual Effects which personally I don't understand. There's obvious CG shots all over the place including some much needed redos on compositing. In New York at the end it's absolutely beautiful on top of the Empire State Building but on Skull Island it's almost cringe-inducing at parts. Not to mention the sounds outside of Kong are merely ok but go figure, they won Best Sound and Sound Editing. T-Rex's don't sound big enough personally.

The other flaw is the action sequences. Yes they're cool and yes they're exciting but they're also incredibly silly. When you got guys running from a herd of brontosaurs and only 4 or so get trampled in such a narrow space is hard to believe. Not to mention when they topple over. Then there's Kong fighting no less than 3 V-Rexes(apparently they're not T ones they're V) with only bites doesn't add up. No big chunk missing or torn flesh, it's merely teeth marks and blood. It might sound like I'm nitpicking but when you want people to believe in such an extravagant world it helps to nail reality's details, even if it does have large spiders and a gorilla.

One more nitpick: its editing and length. Much of this film could've been chopped off. Spielberg even when making the 2 1/2 hour Close Encounters or 3+ hour Schindler's List, never made a boring film(some exceptions may apply). Jackson on the other hand might need to fire his editor since so much is rather unneccessary. It's as if the only way to make the film epic is to pack it with as much as you can. Subplots and sidestories(such as a cabin boy and a father-like figure) are never resolved.

Where the film works is the acting, despite its odd casting choices. Jack Black makes a good Denham but not an excellent one and Adrien Brody doesn't scream action hero to me. The supporting cast is good though with the under-utilized Colin Hanks(bit of a slip when I mentioned Tom instead). Naomi Watts is the perfect Ann Darrow though, tough and very emotional. In fact, it's probably rare to not find her teary eyed in the film, and quite a set of lungs. Her screams people although the other thing...

It's one of the most biggest and expensive movies ever yet I feel it's not an A picture but it's not a so bad it's good B picture. It's like a B+, entertaining but so much problems it has.",1143590400,,3140,4.519366197183099
7602714,4,B01AHWLX2O,"If you missed King Kong at the theaters, here's your chance to catch up. Peter Jackson's version is easily the best of the three Kong epics. The film (DVD) begins slowly, builds up with furious action in the second act and concludes with a breathtaking finale. It feels like three seperate films, but somehow works as a singular vision. The acting is first rate and nearly matches the intensity of the action. King Kong doesn't quite reach the unmatched level of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it's close enough to guarantee the viewer an exciting evening of escapist entertainment.

King Kong is divided into three distinct parts (acts). The first act focuses on the characters' back-story. And while Jackson has done this before (the flawless first half of The Fellowship of the Ring), his effort here is slightly erratic: too many ideas, not enough precision. Twenty minutes of editing would have served the film well. It is here we are introduced to Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts). Ms. Watts is brilliant. Sure, you'll remember Kong, the special effects and the deluge of action, but it is Ann Darrow who will steal your heart. Naomi Watts is tops among the new crew of beauties who can act (Jennifer Connelly, Charlize Theron, Angelina Jolie etc.). Jack Black, Adrien Brody and the rest of the cast shine in performances that have somehow been overlooked (Lord of the Rings backlash?).

The second act takes place on Skull Island. The action here is ripping throughout and one will find it hard to breathe during some of the spectacular sequences. There are dinosaurs,hostile natives, scary bugs and Kong's introduction during this section. There is also action, jaw dropping special effects, beauty in abundance and still more action during this sixty minute roller coaster ride. The DVD is worth owning for the second act alone.

The final act gives the film(DVD) and its audience a chance to breathe. It focuses on men and their greed/ignorance, the Technicolor brilliance of NYC at night and the events that lead to King Kong's inevitable doom. The final act is where humanity and technology intersect. Watts says more with her expressive blue eyes than the lines she is given. Kong-- in a real triumph for special effects-- matches her emotions with the sadness conveyed in his CGI brown eyes. By the time the planes zoom in and reduce The Mighty King Kong in both size and relevance (incredible cinematography) as he is perched precariously on the Empire State buiding, the audience is ready for the end of the film. Sure, three hours is long time to wait for a predictable ending...but it's worth it.",1143590400,,2610,4.873873873873874
7602715,4,B01AHWLX2O,"I may be the only living person that didn't know what King Kong was about. I didn't get into the original King Kong or Godzilla so I had no idea what to expect when it came to this movie being in the theater. I went to see it with some skepticism. A giant gorilla? What? WOW. no... WOW! I think I felt nearly every feeling one could feel in a movie theater. I was scared when the actors were. I was bedazzled by Naomi Watt's sparkling blue eyes. I was even in love with King Kong myself after so much had happened that I cried at the end. I can't believe I just wrote that for people to read... anyway, it was truly a surprising and good movie. The effects were no worse than that of Spiderman or Independance Day and the like. If you like effects, and movies that allow you to feel a range of emotions in a 2-3 hour period, you should like this too.",1143590400,,850,4.065476190476191
7602716,1,B01AHWLX2O,"Some would like to suggest that Peter Jackson is like the second coming of George Lucas, back in his hey-days. However, I feel that he has more in common with P.T. Barnum. I've never felt more underwhelmed nor emotionally cheated as I did watching King Kong. I couldn't wait to see it, and while I loathed the later two LOTR films, I had faith that Jackson could bring together a more concentrated effort here. But when I was sitting in the theater and it got to New York (by then I was already well disgruntled with the movie) and Anne walks in fashion model slow-mo with a bright, heavenly light behind her, up to a dazzled Kong... I just had to look around and see if anyone else was buying this crap.

The story itself, while fundementally the same as its 1930's counterpart, mind bogglingly meanders with the utmost tedium through in-jokes, stale dialogue, and a myriad of disjointed scenes that never seem to amount to anything. It's almost ironic that the 1930's film, while exceptionally shorter, seems to, at once, cover more territory and allow for more character developement. It's not that Jackson's Kong doesn't have plenty of character developement, its that it is so erroniously out of place that I never ended up caring for the supposed main characters.

And sure, the special effects were fine and dandy, they were an eye sore of technical achievement. So much so that I could hardly see a damn thing sometimes, especially in the fights and in the wide shots. When Kong and the V. Rex are fighting, I could, at best, make out fur, scales, and noise. The camera was so close, that it wasn't intense, it was nauseating. And I won't go off on how utterly silly Kong acts through out the film. He may be a giant monkey, but that doesn't mean he has to act like a three year old. I was expecting a sympathetic character, a creature with a respectable sense of age and weight. Instead he's pathetic, more like a pea brained child than a 30 ft. tall super mammal.

This is the Hollywood formula at it's finest. It's got great production values, expensive effects, big name actors, a big name property, clean cinematography, and no soul. I see people all the time just getting dazzled and suckered in by Hollywood's glossy veil that they can't see that there's nothing behind it. This film is nothing but an excercise in excess and incompetence, and as such, that it has seen such momentus sucess suggests that Barnum was right about suckers. I would also hazard a guess that everyone one of them was born here, in the US.",1143590400,22,2531,4.595132743362832

7602720,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson's King Kong is an marvelous achievement that carries astonishing clarity and vision within every frame. 2005 was a year that saw cinematic masterpieces such as Capote and Munich, but King Kong successfully embodies and often elevates to a new level the elements of storytelling, action, and visual effects that made cinema emerge as the 20th century's premier art form.

King Kong seizes on the story provided by the 1933 original and expands upon it in the way some great films bring novels to a vibrant life no one could have imagined the material was capable of. Taking place during the Great Depression, we meet Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), a struggling actress and performer. She has a good heart, but her life has been little more than a series of crippling disappointments. In a seemingly divine stroke of luck, movie producer Carl Denham (Jack Black) approaches Ann on the street, offering her the chance to star in one of his films. Unbeknownst to her, Denham's plans are to travel the Pacific in search of a mysterious island, misleading both film and ship crews to get there.

The voyage to Skull Island receives most of the first hour of screen time, but never does it become tedious. Jackson's characters are likeable and clear, the dialogue never attempting to be clever or flashy, but a perfect component to lay out the action ahead. Already a good film, the film rushes forward at breakneck pace upon reaching Skull Island, never missing a step or skipping a beat. Skull Island may be the most malevolent location ever put to film, replete with vile monsters that could each serve as their own horror series.

When King Kong (Andy Sekris) finally arrives, he occupies the screen with a dazzling sense of power and flawless movement.  Sekris, who did the fabulous movements of Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, works with special effects to bring the giant ape to life in way that outshines that of most human actors.

Outwardly vicious and intimidating, Kong grows attached to Ann. She performs her vaudeville act for Kong, an enthusiastic audience who may not have ever received kind attention from another being. We slowly realize the two share a sort of connection that goes deeper than words. Both are outcasts in their societies, living solitary existences defined primarily by their physical traits. Kong protects Ann from the appalling creatures on Skull Island, and after the humans capture the great beast, Ann tries to protect him.

The knockout action sequences come furiously during the film's latter 2/3's, utilizing state of the art f/x and imagination for all they are worth. During one breathtaking sequence, Kong battles three tyrannosaurs rex's while holding Ann in alternating hands, while in another terrifying sequence, the film crew comes under assault from thousands of disgusting insects. Each sequence would likely be the highlight of the average film, but when Kong runs amok in New York City, the exhilarating payoff never falls short of awe-inspiring.

Peter Jackson has come a long way. Originally known as the director of cult horror schlock such as Dead Alive, he shot to worldwide fame as the driving force behind the superb Lord of the Rings films. With King Kong, he proves himself to be an artist with phenomenal potential to add his name to the lexicon of great filmmakers.

When Kong brings Ann to the stop of the Empire State building, he looks longingly at her, his deepest sadness being that their time together has run out, and I tearfully felt the same way. Roger Ebert often states ""No bad film is short enough, while no good film is long enough."" These words rang true throughout my psyche as this exciting, wonderful, deeply sad, and beautiful film came to a close.",1143590400,,3744,4.903633491311217
7602721,1,B01AHWLX2O,"Maybe they looked cool in the theatre, but at home this movie just looked absolutely horrible.  It was really lame and boring, despite it's having lots of fight scenes.

7602722,4,B01AHWLX2O,"OK, first of all, you may wonder why only 4 stars.  Well, let me explain.

This film is first and fore-most a visual feast for the eyes.  The level of detail in all of the films locations and set pieces is truely draw-dropping.  From the creatures to the ship to Skull Island and even New York itself, the level of computer image technology, model and miniature work today is truely outstanding.  (Watch the Production Diaries to see what I mean.)

Anyway, so why the 4 stars?  Well if you wanna watch Peter Jackson's King Kong for a well thought out acted drama, go elsewhere.  Wait...why would I say that?  Well, once the action gets to the island and the ship's crew is chasing down Kong and Anna, there's very little dialogue.  Just a bunch of screaming and shooting and dying.  Which is good thing and fitting for the scenes, but there's very little verbal reasoning for advancing the story in the normal way if you know what I mean.  Basically what I'm saying is that the action on screen advances the story on its own, I guess.  We're talking ""the thrill of the chase"" so-to-speak.

Anyway, if you like to watch modern movies for eye candy, well look no further.  This film has got to be the most lavish film I have ever seen.  The environments are so detailed that they really look alive.  No other Kong movie has even come close to this level of realism in that department.  The multitude of creatures that WETA created for this film is truely phenomenal.  I was sitting there, watching the DVD, saying ""They must've spent of bundle for all these effects shots.""  I was even impressed with the CG New York skyline for the final Empire State Building scene.  Trying to create a authentic 1933 New York skyline and cityscape in the computer would not be easy either.  The Biplane attack sequence at the end was very spectacular.  I've never seen anything as unique as that.  Very creative camera shots.

Oh yeah, the sound is good too.  The current DVD only comes with a DD 5.1 track, but it's still very good with deep solid bass for Kong's growl and other creature effects.  Hopefully the rumored extended edition will come with a DTS track...and some commentaries!

But back to the 4 star thing.  I'd give it 5, but the lack of conventional story telling and having the story action driven is usually not a good method of making a film.  However, in this case, the method works, but I was looking for a little more character development for some of the minor characters, and even some additional development to explain some of the main characters' motivations.

Anyway...still a solid movie and one to be a masterpiece for sure.  Even though the Oscars pretty much snubbed it, I'd say Kong (2005) will have a cult following for years to come.  Basically this ain't gonna be Godzilla (1998) if you know what I mean.",1143590400,,2824,4.5728542914171655
7602723,4,B01AHWLX2O,I bought this DVD for my 8 year old son who is King Kong crazy. The show didn't hold his attention until Kong actually came into the picture. The movie is over three hours long and Kong comes into the movie  about an hour and a half into it. The movie on an adult level was good. There were some boring parts as with any movie but the special FX and scenes were well made and awesome. I would recommend this movie to any Kong fan. If your not a kong fan i would still watch it for the storyline and special effects alone.,1143590400,,521,4.009615384615385
7602724,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Kong Rules, Peter Jackson has created something that is priceless.

The action was non stop, besides that Kong was so lifelike, that he won me over. There is nothing like a film full of life and real emotion. The Best film I've saw in since LOTR and Crash.",1143590400,,256,4.333333333333333
7602725,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson has firmly established himself as a director on the level of masters like Steven Spielberg. King Kong takes us on a journey ranging from the highest highs to the lowest lows. This is truly a stunningly powerful remake of the classic tale--a tale which inspired Mr. Jackson to get into film making in the first place.

First and foremost are the special effects. Let's face it, this whole movie hinges on whether or not Kong is believable. We all remember The Hulk which brought us the inhuman, laughable green man-thing. Not the case here: Jackson creates a beast that is not only believable, but lovable and powerful as well. His quirky mannerisms and expressions shine on the big screen, as does his fascination with the lovely Ms. Darrow.

Beyond Kong, are the dinosaurs and bugs. Kong does battle with several fierce dinos to protect Ann and the action sequences are incredible as are the dinosaurs themselves. Ann's rescue squad come across some problems of their own in the form of large insects and blobs that eat you one limb at a time. All if which is both exciting an disgusting. The SGI guys working on Jurassic Park 4 might want to take notes here.

Jackson goes even further and creates a complete digital model of 1933 Manhattan. Every single building is remade. Why you ask? So during the final shots of Kong battling the airplanes on top of the Empire State Building, Jackson is free to use broad and uncompromised camera angles. The entire final sequence is emotionally draining and acrophobic as the height and scale are surreal.

The final compelling attribute to King Kong is the bond between him and Ann Darrow. All Kong wants is to be with her and protect her. He battles dinosaurs, people and airplanes to be so. When he's taken to NYC and teased with a fake Ann, he goes ballistic to find her. Their reunion is both beautiful and sad since we all know the final outcome. Kong's chase though crowded Manhattan is another spectacular display.

All in all, this film is an astonishing piece of cinematic work. Jackson nails every single aspect of what an action movie slash love story should be. While some say its a bit long, you do get sucked in and time goes by rather quickly. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, period.",1143590400,3,2272,4.641791044776119
7602726,4,B01AHWLX2O,"I absolutely LOVED this remake. I was a little dissappointed at how fake the CGI looked. But then I realized this was done by Universal and we all know how abyssmal Hulk was. But King Kong (the origianl 1933 version) was the movie that put the moviemaking bug into Peter Jackson's head. So this movie was a lifelong dream-come-true for him.

The ONLY complaint I have about this DVD is the fact that it does not include a director commentary. I don't know about anyone else, but I love hearing a director's comments and thoughts. I love hearing what was going through his head when he made a particular scene. That's the only thing that would have made me give this DVD 5 stars.",1143590400,4,678,4.467741935483871
7602727,2,B01AHWLX2O,"Some thoughts:

- It is possible for a movie to have too many dinosaurs. Who would have thought?

- Jackson's command of spectacle is immature. He got away with it in the first two LORD OF THE RINGS films because Tolkien's story and characters were so powerful. But cracks of obvious indulgence appeared in RETURN OF THE KING, and they open into a yawning chasm in KONG. (Literally, yawning.) Spielberg fell into the same trap with 1941.

- Digital special effects have lost their magic. This isn't entirely Jackson's fault, but KONG makes it painfully obvious. Anything that can be imagined can be now shown. The question is, who has the talent to imagine something fresh and new?",1143590400,5,681,4.754237288135593
7602728,4,B01AHWLX2O,"Very well done, but from Peter Jackson the maker of Lord of the Rings, I wouldn't expect less. Excellent production values and good acting make this well worth seeing. Overall I was very impressed with the movie. Now let me tell you a couple reasons why I didn't give it five stars. I took off one star for the following reasons. It is too long. Not everyone wants to sit through a three hour movie. All my family felt it was to long. Sorry, but Jackson could have cut some of the New York scenes out or a few other spots to make this about two hours or just over and it would have been incredibly good still. I think the natives were a bit overdone as cannibalistic zombies and overall I don't have the desire to sit right back down and watch it again as I did with the LOTR movies. Unlike the LOTR movies some of the time in King Kong dragged a little. Don't get me wrong it is well done and certainly in competition with the original and far above the other remake. I think a little less of head bashing natives and so many New York scenes would have made it better. What happened to them in boats and chased by the dinosaur in the water? And as one other reviewer mentioned Kong fighting three T-Rex was overdone. You saw Jurassic Park, the T-Rex didn't travel in packs, that was Velociraptors. Sure I liked the stampede scene too, and the spiders put back in, but they overdid the number of bugs and shooting them off. I still bought it and I am glad I did as I will certainly go back and watch it in a couple weeks or so, just not tonight. So those of you that love it blindly give me some credit for not being all glassy eyed over it, and those that think it stunk give me some credit for being objective about it. Those of you that vote negative at my review because you disagree are obviously not movie critics but just fans, and that doesn't help someone improve their work. I'll take constructive criticism any day over unfounded praise.",1143590400,,1948,4.267567567567568
7602729,3,B01AHWLX2O,"Because Peter Jackson is such a fan of KING KONG '33, his 2005 remake is tough to separate from the original.  And because I know the old film very well, it's tough for me, too.

  To begin with, I feel that Jackson's KONG is too long.  If it were up to me, I would cut about 45 minutes out of it easily.  However, the special effects are (mostly) great, though I feel that JURASSIC PARK (1993) is still better in this regard.

  I think the effects depicting Kong himself are very well done.  Kong as a character is well conceived here, too, with some silver hair and battle scars.  Given these positives, it's a shame that, for me, a lot of the film doesn't live up to them.

  *WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD!*

  Jackson opens the film with titles in the '33 style, then does a 1930's montage (Hoovervilles, bread lines, etc.) to educate today's audience about the period; these are flawless recreations, but go on too long for me.  He then introduces Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts--good in the role) as a struggling actress.

  Filmmaker Carl Denham is later introduced as a ne'er-do-well con-artist in the Orson Welles mold (put six inches and a cheesy moustache on Jack Black--good in the part, BTW--and he'd be a ringer for Welles, c. 1942).  Always on the make, he meets Ann as she contemplates employment at a strip joint, and sets sail on The Venture for parts unknown (Skull Island) before he can be arrested for absconding with studio funds.  Trapped on board is Jack Driscoll (Adrian Brody), in this version a playwright and reluctant Denham partner (Brody is not bad in the part, but I feel he's not given much of a character to work with).

  The Venture's Captain Englehorn is a 40-ish, shady German; his first-mate is a strapping African-American guy named Hayes, who mentors teen crewmember Jimmy, a troubled youth (I feel that much of this sub-plot could be cut).  Bruce Baxter, a preening male actor, also goes on the voyage.  It's fully 45 minutes before The Venture crashes on the rocks of skull island--after Denham has been educated by Hayes and the English cook Lumpy about its history (in this version, he has the map to the island, but knows nothing of Kong).

  The natives they find on Skull Island are horrific--pierced, red-eyed, savage--and they kill some of the landing party (Englehorn saves Denham with his Lugar!).  But here, I feel that the logical problems in the film begin--we never see their civilization.  The gigantic wall is a ruin, and where the natives are encountered is a barren wasteland--exactly what is this wall protecting?  These scenes are also filmed like a Sting music video from 1985, I'm guessing to underscore the action; I personally found that to be annoying, but your opinion may differ.

  Ann is kidnapped by the natives in a way even more illogical than in '33 (a native on a huge pole vault [!] Spidermans his way onto the ship and drags her off), and a terrifying female witchdoctor leads the ceremony sacrificing Ann.  Ann is strapped into what looks like a giant slingshot and is semi-catapulted across a ravine to await Kong.  When the big guy shows up, it's a whole lot like the 1976 Dino DeLaurentis version (not the last allusion Jackson makes to that film).

  Denham and the boys set out after Kong, though Denham is seen cranking his camera rather than leading the party (at times, I feel this is taken to ridiculous extremes, especially when he's on the log bridge while Kong is shaking it).  The guys (mostly) survive a brontosaurus/raptor stampede (these scenes have a cartoon feel for me, though others might disagree), and the log bridge scene features more creepy bugs than I think would be logically possible (overall, however, it is effective).  Jimmy machine-guns a ton of the slimy critters off Driscoll at close range--ridiculous, in my view.  Miraculously, Englehorn and Baxter arrive just in time (again) to save Denham.

  In KONG '33, the giant ape's battle with a T-Rex is a highlight (and an inspiration for many filmmakers, including Steven Spielberg).  Because it's the 21st Century now (""been there, done that""), Kong here--Ann in hand--fights three V-Rex's at once, falling off a cliff in the process and battling them in the hanging vines as they Wiley-Coyote their way to the bottom.  These scenes are Nintendo fast, with sweeping camera, and, as such, are both exciting and annoying--I couldn't catch all that was going on (plus, they're so over the top logically that there's no credibility--and that's saying something, considering we're talking about a film featuring a 25-foot ape).  Anyway, Kong finishes the last one off on the ground in '33 style--in my opinion, the best part of the film (here, Jackson tones down the Sly Cooper imagery, allowing for a long shot or two, which helped me orient the action).

  In a throwback to the '76 version, Ann begins talking with and entertaining Kong (though, unlike the '76 version, there's nothing sexual implied).  These parts are bad in my opinion, and I'd cut them.  Then, Driscoll appears out of nowhere (in '33, we saw him tracking Kong) and--while Kong battles huge bats [!]--the playwright and Ann make their escape by (at first) climbing down a vine, then GRABBING THE FEET OF A BAT and hang-gliding to the river below (this is absolutely the worst thing in the film).

  Like the Denham character Fred Wilson in '76, Denham risks the lives of everybody to capture Kong.  The natives have strangely disappeared (to where?); it's only what's left of The Venture crew behind the wall.  Kong's rampage once he gets through the gate is good, though illogic strikes again when Englehorn shoots him in the leg with a harpoon gun and cripples him (since Kong's brushed off at least three V-Rex bites FLUSH ON HIS ARMS--which would surely cause more damage--I'm not sure why this harpoon thing threatens him so much).  Ann does the, ""No, don't kill him!"" routine, and tries to get off the lifeboat to protect him (awful).  Denham hits the big guy in the face with a bottle of chloroform, puts him to sleep, does the ""we're millionaires, boys"" speech, and, like '33, we're suddenly in NYC on Broadway.

  As in the '76 version, Ann and Jack boycott the event (he opens his play off-Broadway, she acts in a review across town).  Denham has Baxter and an un-named actress sub for them.  At this point, Jackson does an interesting homage to Kong '33 by having the on-screen orchestra in the film play a variety of snippets from the original score--which, unfortunately, points up how lacking in drama the score for HIS film is (also, on stage, they recreate the '33 natives and their dance--interesting).

  Wanting to see Ann, Driscoll shows up at Kong's NY unveiling--and, like in '33, the photographers fire away, enraging Kong.  He escapes (a good scene), gets loose, and throws cars around (okay--but, again, Nintendo).  He's chasing Driscoll in a cab and about to kill him, when Ann appears in the street (her hair highlighted in a halo) and calms him down.  He takes her through ice-covered Central Park (complete with decorated trees for Xmas--did they do that in 1933?), and, in an infamous scene, plays on the ice with her until the army starts firing missiles at him (all of this really should have been cut, in my opinion).  He then climbs the Empire State Building--very effective--and sits up there with Ann as the sun rises (absurd).

  Six planes arrive with no warning, and Kong goes 'way on top of the building to battle them.  There are some terrific shots here, though Ann--absurdly, like Dwan in KONG '76--tries to stop the planes from killing him (she apparently has NO FEAR of heights, and--in spite of what must be BRUTAL COLD UP THERE--doesn't shiver once in her party dress as she Indiana Jonses from perch to perch).  In some spectacular images, Kong knocks out three of the planes before they get to him, though he has to take time out from the fight to catch Ann when a ladder comes loose from the side of the building (I get the feeling he could have beaten the planes if he didn't have to worry about her).

  When he finally begins to die, Ann's right on top of the building with him (in high heels, no less), and, as he falters, they stare at each other face to face, sharing a tender goodbye before he slips off (absurd in my view, though most critics don't agree).  Driscoll then appears and hugs her RIGHT ON THE PINNACLE--apparently, this exchange of affection is more important than getting the hell DOWN from there.

  In Dino style, photographers stand on the dead Kong's chest for photos, Denham delivers the famous beauty-killed-beast line (but since he's been presented as such a con man and liar, I'm not sure why we should consider it to be profound, coming from him), and the film comes to an end.

  Overall, I found KONG '05 to be slow in spots, 'way overdone in others, and absurd in several.

However, there are enough good things in the film to make me glad I saw it.

  Compared with KONG '33, it's better and it isn't.  Obviously, the effects are far better--though, again, I still feel they're inferior to JURASSIC PARK.  I find KONG '33 to be unintentionally funny in spots--the brontosaurus attack for example (and the jerky stop-motion effects take some getting used-to these days)--but once Kong tangles with the T-Rex, things get good and stay good.  Denham, Ann, and Driscoll all make sense in '33, and I have to give the makers of the original a lot of points for coming up with all of this in the first place.

  In my view, what Jackson did to Denham in the remake is a crime, and though Ann '33 screamed too much, her ""save-the-animal"" sensibility here seems forced, maudlin, and anachronistic (I have to admit, though, that I have no idea how I'd react if I were a gorgeous blonde plaything for a giant ape).  Too, the story MOVED in '33, and the music underscored the drama (a lot of illogical things weren't obvious because of the pace).  In my opinion, Jackson has bogged the story down with unnecessary characters and motivations, and the musical score is nothing special.

  Stylistically, however, I think Jackson's KONG is gorgeous, though as I've mentioned, there are annoying (to me) music video/video game sections.  In short, Jackson and company have made a good film.  Had they stuck closer to the '33 script with modern-day effects, I think it would have been great.  But I'll be buying the DVD from Amazon, no doubt.",1143590400,3,10429,4.734444444444445
7602730,5,B01AHWLX2O,Everything else has already been said so i'm just gonna say that Peter Jackson is truly one of the greatest Director's of all time & this film is a Masterpiece! He captures the moral message in how the human race will take mother natures beauty & selfishly detroy it. To me Kong is a metaphor for the planet earth! Anyway Peter Jackson takes us on a visual & emotional thrillride before punching us all in the gutt with an ending that we all new was comeing but we just didn't want it to come. Kinda like watching a repeat of the 86 world series & already knowing the outcome but just hopeing the ball this time around won't go between Bill Buckner's legs. But it always does!,1143590400,4,676,4.330708661417323
7602731,3,B01AHWLX2O,"Initially, I was a little disappointed in this movie. I have changed my mind as I have seen this now several times and each time I pick up something new I missed. Thus, I enjoy each viewing and my opinion of this movie has improved over time. Though I believe the original movie is better, I still highly recommend buying this movie. There are many parts that were very well done and I feel it well worth the cost of having this version too.

I assign a VG to this version of King Kong. (I assigned a VG++ to the original version.)

Just the idea of the story - lost island, prehistoric monsters, extensive jungle scenes, ancient ruins and temples, horrendous statues of great antiquity - this is enough to send me desperately searching for that movie or story. Yet plot is important too. Why are the characters there to begin with - are they lost?, searching for somehting? why?

In this current version of King Kong, by Peter Jackson, I believe that the casting could have been better. It was ok. Carl Denham in the original movie was basically a good person. He came across as a sincere, energetic movie director, but one who was likely to take too many chances with the safety of the people he worked with. In the Jackson version, he came across as a liar, mean-spirited person, who just used people. I prefer the original Carl Denham.

I have mixed feeling about having the supposed writer, Driscol, along. He became the love interest for Ann Darrow, rather than the First Mate, as happens in the original version. This was probably done because it made more sense that Ann would develop a sincere relationship with someone nearer to her work interests, than some sea-going mate, who may or may not hold down a job in the same place where Ann could. So for this reason alone, I think the role was fine. My only complaint is how he gets stuck on this voyage to begin with. Why didn't he go directly to the captain and ask to be let off the ship? According to the original movie, tugs controlled the ship in harbor, releasing once the ship was safely away and able to steer on its own. It is hard for me to imagine Driscol not being able to get back to shore, if he truly wanted to.

I initially thoroughly disliked the presence of the guy playing the role of the ""big-time movie star"" being aboard. What made me change my mind is how he eventually becomes a 'hero' of sorts, rather than some dandy who thinks he is a hero and turns into what he really is, a coward. This character development was done just fine, and I sort of liked him at that point. In addition, he provides some laughs and did not take himself seriously either. He earned my respect and I felt he added to the plot.

I liked the tramp steamer captain the most of all the characters - Englehorn - from the start. His role was very good. He was consistent, for he maintained the ""ideal"" view of captain in my mind. He was someone to depend upon who would come to your aid, even though you might be foolish with risking your own life and those of everyone else associated with you as Denham did. He had authority, but he did not abuse it. Instead, he used this to help his crew consistently, and helped his passengers, Like Denham, who did not really deserve help.

The Ann Darrow part was done very well too. Initially, I did not care for the part in which she dances for King Kong. However, in time I came to accept and enjoy how the relationship evolved. I could not make any suggestion to improve the approach taken to show this development. What I have come to accept is how their relationship does eventually grow, it does become ""interesting"", and that feeling of loss and tragedy that was so poignant in the original was even more present in this film. It was definitely there and I felt that tragic loss of Kong even more in the Jackson version. This is due certainly to the excellent acting of Ann.

The build-up of this movie was fine. I enjoyed the ocean voyage, the expectancy of getting to Skull Island grew and developed well with me, but not as strongly as the original film. This was all fine. Then came the islanders themselves - like being stranded on an island with a bunch of evil, drugged idiots. They all looked like they were on crack, stoned on some bingo-juice, and, is short, they appeared more like a bunch of stupid idiots than dangerous natives. I thought this part could have been improved upon. How did these people survive this island, since they all looked diseased, for heaven's sake. Then the wall, yes the wall was dumb. Compared to the original movie, this wall was a sieve that couldn't keep water out, let alone  anything like a charging Kong. This was a big disappointment to the huge build up that occurred to this point of the movie. I did not care for the natives, nor the ""wall"" at all. The original has this beat by far. The overall scenery was great and had more than the eye can take in with one viewing.

In addition, the dinosaurs were the biggest disappointment to me. These encounters left a lot to be desired. I did not want a magical Disney tour of a theme park approach as was done in this movie. The stampeding brontosaurs was nonsensical, to say the least. The sailors would have been destroyed by any stampeding brontosaursi as they were all running together down that ""alley"". No way anyone would have survived such an event. This was insane, to put it mildly. Then I ask myself why did they stampede to begin with? It was likely due to the presence of raptors, I guessed from what I observed. Generally, I would have expected the brontosaur to be capable of crushing attacking raptors by using its tail to send one to the moon, stomping on one with it monstrous legs, etc. So the stampede of a herd of massive reptiles in the face of pigmy attackers, as presented in the movie, mountains of massive flesh fleeing from the itty bitty attackers, was far fetched and just not believable to me. And it appeared as if this attack wiped out this branch of dinosaurs on the island since so many fell either off the cliff face or were involed in that massive car-wreck of a mess when machine guns took down the front running dinosaur with the raptors too. I think this could have been a little better done.

Then the T-Rex. What a disppointment! In the original version of King Kong, I always wondered what would have happened if Kong met with one of these actual monsters. In the original version, he fought, what appeared to be, a toothless, tired, old T-Rex. What about Kong fighting a 10 ton, charging beast with teeth 8-10 inches long, and having massive jaws capable of ripping many pounds of flesh per bite. This sort of beast attacking him might lead to a different outcome entirely, and this would be enormous interest to this movie, if done properly. I do not think a real Kong could survive such an attack without some terrible wounds of his own. I always felt this would have been one horrendous battle. Something for the ages, to be remembered for all time. Yet this movie turned that battle into a quick down and out joke. Kong made happy meals out of three - yes, 3 - T-Rexes. Impossible! Stupid! Idiotic! I hated that part, even though I watched it with interest. I got bored with it once I saw how quickly Kong was dispatching not one but 3 of the fiercest land predators that ever lived. These beast weighed over 10 tons, for heaven's sake, not a few hundred pounds. Yet Kong tossed them around. Not possible. Then I asked myself, would Kong so easily have dispatched a charging Triceratops? I bet they would have made a comedy of that one too. And again, how about a sabertooth? Such a nightmarish, horrendous predator would have been a challenge to a charging Mastrodon, and I bet could have ripped parts of Kong to pieces, if it ever got onto his back or even got hold of his arm. It would have been impossible for Kong to fight such a creature without shedding some blood too. Yet, I bet this too would have been a one-two punch and out for the producers of this movie. Hence, I lost interest in this entire section with T-Rex.

What would I have done? Yes, Kong has to live to end up in New York to finish this film. So he would win the battle, but not before he had some rents and tears in his own hide from the incredibly fast jaws of an attacking T-Rex. It might have been close to a take-down on the part of T-Rex, if I had my way. No way would I have made this battle into a comedy.

Then the island itself. What a nightmare world it was. A fascinating, lost world to end all lost world stories. Yet, the island seemed confined, with alleys for the dinosaurs to traverse, not spooky jungles, and it was too mountainous for my tastes. Have mountains, yes, but not dominating the scenery throughout as was done in this movie.

In conclusion, I gave this movie a VG, or 4 stars. If the inslanders did not look completely stoned on crack, and if the dinosaurs were truer dinosaurs, and if the battle between Kong and the T-Rex was an epic battle, then this movie would have gotten a higher rating from me. The Original movie, I gave a VG++. It was not beaten by this new version for consistent mood, for keeping my interest intense, for believable acting, and for flow of story.",1143590400,,9225,4.428403064230996
7602732,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson's King Kong is about a film producer/director named Carl Denham and his crew's adventure on a mysterious island. They travel to Skull Island to shoot a new film, but when they find out a legendary beast and dangerous natives live on the island, their quest and curiosity puts them against Kong, the natives, and his dinosaur enemies, and while the crew attempt to catch the legendary creature, Kong's attention is captivated by a beautiful woman named Ann Darrow, which allows for the explorers to capture him and bring him to New York, where Kong's future involves commercial exploitation.

My fave scene from the film is *SPOILERS* where Kong is fighting the dinosaurs, and he rips one of their heads in two, and the jaw dangles. *END OF SPOILERS*. It's just so random that Kong makes it's jaw dangle, that it's hilarious! If you love special effects, you MUST see this film! The stampede sequence alone will leave your jaw dropping, and Kong looks excellent! The ending left much to be desired, but it's still a good ending. After seeing this for the first time, I wish I saw it in theatres!

King Kong is the best remake I've ever seen thus far (and I am not a fan of remakes), and one of the best films of 2005. The three hour length of the film flew by, I didn't even notice how long the film is. My eyes were glued to the screen. I think this is Peter Jackson's best film thus far, I'm not a fan of the LotR trilogy, but I've seen most of his other films, and this tops them all. If you're looking for action, adventure, or an excellent love story, you'll definitely do yourself a favor by checking out ""King Kong"".",1143590400,2,1636,4.4865771812080535
7602733,4,B01AHWLX2O,"I'm giving Peter Jackson, Naomi Watts and the incredible special effects four stars.  They've really done something special here.

Enough has been written here about the great things in KING KONG but I'll just add that I didn't care for Jack Black in the role of Carl Denham.  His desperation would've been more dramatic (and believable) with a more expierenced, older actor.

And I thought Adrien Brody was so physically different from Black that it was distracting: I kept waiting for them to go into a ""Who's on First?"" routine.  Brody's hangdog expressions and his transformation from gawky New York playwright into Indiana Jones weren't believable either.

Naomi Watts was great, hands-down.  She always delivers.

(Now if today's Hollywood can give a brand new story the kind of innovation and energy that Jackson gives to KONG, maybe we'll have something new to cheer about.  Anymore, the only movies I get excited about have been done before, some several times).",1143590400,,971,5.056603773584905

King Kong is argueably the most well done CGI character ever.  1930's New York city is recreated beautifully.  The acting in this movie is excellent, especially Naomi Watts' performance which is mainly reacting to blue screens and a human stand-in for Kong.  Andy Serkis also deserves recognition for his portrayal of Kong.  The love story between beauty and the beast is done extremely well, this aspect alone is far superior to any other version of this movie.  The story is faithful to the original while not coming off as a copy of it.  I was on the edge of my seat, I was captivated, and I was even touched by the awesome spectacle that is King Kong.  I would have done a few things differently, but I feel King Kong finally got the retelling that it has always deserved.

7602735,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Updated: The ""new"" Blu-Ray is, essentially, just a straight reissue of the previous edition. The transfer and extras are the same as the previous deluxe edition and the timing is to coincide with ""Kong:Skull Island"" which can't be a prequel bexause it is set AFTER the Jackson film chronologically (I.e., it takes place ""now"" whereas the Jackson film was set in the 30's like the original film).

The previous Blu-Ray feature a very nice looking and sounding transfer with a host of extras.

Back to the original review:

Peter Jackson's epic retelling of ""King Kong"" may run a bit too long at nearly 3 hours but it's an admirable and fun adventure well worth taking. Filled with wonderous Oscar winning visual effects, ""Kong"" is, indeed, the 8th Wonder of the World in this marvelous movie. Jackson manages to recreate the world of 1933 New York perfectly in this rollicking roller coaster of an adventure. Like the original 1933 classic Jackson and his crew of visual effects artists (along with a strong cast)give ""Kong"" a sense of reality even as we see all the fantastic events in the film. By the way the dialogue scene where they are shooting the ""movie"" on the boat with Bruce Baxter (Kyle Chandler who has a lot of fun with the role) is taken directly from the original 1933 ""King Kong"".

 Carl Denham (Jack Black ""School of Rock"") a producer about to be arrested by people who invested in his only partially finished movie receives a map leading to a previously uncharted island--Skull Island. He hopes to take his new leading lady Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts ""The Ring"") a down on her luck actress to the island to shoot a script by famous playwrite  Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody of ""The Jacket"" and ""The Pianist""). Denham and his crew aren't quite ready for the dangerous natives of Skull Island or the giant 35 foot tall Silverback Gorilla--Kong--that the natives plan on sacrificing to Kong. Now it's up to Driscoll and the crew of the ship to fight dinosaurs, giant bugs and their the island itself to try and save Darrow. Denham has a crazy idea when he loses the reels to his film--he'll bring Kong back to New York where he'll make millions (""I'll share it all with you boys"").

The DVD looks marvelous with a faithful reproduction of the original theatrical exhibition. No doubt this version will be superceded by the HD-DVD edition when it comes out later in the year or even the multi-disc set planned for November (reportedly even longer than this edition). I don't know how much more story Jackson has to tell with ""Kong"" but this edition of the film more than fits the bill when it comes to entertainment.

The 2 disc edition is the one to get if you enjoy extras. We get an introduction by Jackson discussing the film and how the 1933 original inspired him to become a filmmaker so, in many respects, this is his chance to pay the makers of that film back. We also get ""Post-Production Diaries"" most of which were originally on the website for ""Kong"" providing a glimpse behind-the-scenes in the visual effects and other effects created for the film. ""Kong's New York, 1933 feature a discussion of the importance that vaudeville and other entertainment played in distracting a city in the middle of the depression. We also hear about the skycraper boom and the Empire State Building construction all of which helped the city's inhabitants earn a living during a difficult time in our history. ""Skull Island-A Natural History"" is a tongue-in-cheek look at the ""real"" Skull Island. It's very much in the vein of his fictional documentary ""Forgotten Silver"" and is a treat.

While there isn't a commentary track for the film (we'll get that on the deluxe edition in November), the extras included here are a lot of fun to go through. This is definitely worthwhile. Is it better than the 1933 original film or the 1977 remake? That's up to you to decide but Jackson makes a memorable contemporary update of Kong retelling the story for a modern audience while staying true to the film's roots.",1143504000,3,4009,4.732091690544412
7602736,4,B01AHWLX2O,"First I would just like to state that I am a huge LOTR fan, so I had high hopes for this movie. As I watched this movie in the theaters I was not very impressed for the first hour. I felt Jackson spent too much time setting up the rest movie when he really did not need to do so. As a result, the first third of this movie dragged. However, once the movie got to Skull Island things picked up quickly.

The second part of the movie is where the film won me over. It took on a Jurassic Park-like feel except better. The special effects were incredible (the clips showen on TV do not do it justice). The battle between Kong and the T-Rexs is sure to become a classic. Also, the relationship between Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) and Kong went much more indepth than the 1933 version. I think Jack Black did a good job in his role although some critics did not think so. Another area of the film that really impressed me was the realistic 1930's New York. I urge anyone who watches the film to look at how detailed the city really is including advertisements for real 1930's radio shows.

If not for the slow beginning, I would have given this movie 5 stars.",1143504000,,1150,4.222727272727273
7602737,5,B01AHWLX2O,"With his fabulous remake of KING KONG (2005), Peter Jackson tops his Oscar-winning LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy and enters a movie lover's pantheon for me.  This is my favorite film of last year and it could become one of my personal favorite movies of all time.  It is that good.  And it's not really a ""guilty pleasure"" because virtually every film critic, with the infamous exception of the SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE critic, loved it and gave it highest ratings.

Watching KING KONG in a theater for a vast and enthralling 187 minutes, I found director/co-producer/co-writer Jackson frequently equaling the immortal 1933 classic.  The movie benefits enormously in being  a full 90 minutes longer than the original film.  There is more time at the beginning to establish Ann Darrow (an incandescent Naomi Watts) as a song and dance entertainer, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) as a playwright, and Jack Black as flamboyant director Carl Denham in 1932 Manhattan.  It takes 45 minutes or so to get the voyage underway, then another half hour to reach Skull Island in the South Seas.  In the original, the voyage starts only ten minutes in and reaches Skull Island almost as soon as the ship leaves Manhattan.

We are on Skull Island, in Jackson's wondrous film, for maybe an hour, long enough to have enough creature battles to please any kid at heart.  But Jackson tops the original film in humanizing Kong; he treats Ann nicely and she replies in kind.  This romance was the most satisfying romance I saw in any 2005 movie, except maybe the two gay cowboys in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, which says something awesome about movies last year!  I particularly enjoyed seeing Ann and Kong watching a sunset together from a jungle cliff plateau.  This is an immensely likeable Kong, not someone who eats villagers and throws Manhattan socialite women to the street in the 1933 version.

When we reach Manhattan with Kong and company, we are about 135 minutes in on a 187 minute movie with no intermission.  I remember because I needed to make a short bathroom stop during later Skull Island scenes.  That will not be a problem on home video with the pause button.  The Oscar-nominated production design and Oscar-winning visual effects of Depression era Manhattan are just stupendous here, amazingly re-created in New Zealand, Jackson's home turf.  Here he deviates a little from the original movie in having Kong be on display in a movie palace with Denham, while Jack is previewing a new play and Ann is doing song and dance in a third theater.  There is no elevated train thrown to the ground, though it is quite a sight to see Kong destroy a huge movie palace.  The movie reaches paradise when Kong and Ann go ice dancing (!) together in a snowy Central Park, then view dawn New York City together in a pink and apricot matte painting from atop the Empire State Building.  This is some of the most beautiful visual effects and production design I have ever seen.

I have the double disk, widescreen format DVD of KING KONG in front of me, but am basically reviewing the theatrical experience from the beautiful Century 20 movie palace near me in Daly City.  Peter Jackson's imaginative masterpiece may be even more enthralling on letterboxed DVD, and not just for a bathroom or food break pause capability.  A second disk has almost three hours of Post-Production Diaries, the history of Skull Island, and how Depression New York City was re-created mostly in New Zealand. So if you are renting this baby, figure on three nights for the double disk edition of KING KONG.  Better yet, buy this glorious film masterpiece to enjoy over and over along with the great 1933 version, depending on which vision you are in the mood for.  I prefer Jackson's 2005 vision more, and I cannot wait to see how he tops an untoppable and unequaled movie.",1143504000,,3823,4.779299847792998

but the writing involved here was SO far past unbelievable it was distracting. i laughed alot. seriously. it was that dumb. insultingly stupid. can you say naomi watt's character would've had her neck and/or back snapped in just the first time she was thrust through time and space in the fist of kong? please? think how many of us poor working class people could've retired on this movie's budget alone. what a waste. worse yet is the fact i'm mostly alone in my opinion of this made-for-the-unconscious-masses crowd pleaser. good luck.",1143504000,11,1414,4.666666666666667

Of course this movie is nothing to the orignal 1933 King Kong but its a hell of a movie none the less. I was completely blown away by the F/X and the realism of Kong is unlike anything i have ever seen. Granted there were (in my opinion) some things that could have been left out but over all i think the movie is a momumental achivement.

I think the problem I had with it is the story arc is just too simple to be made into a three hour epic. There were several times I said to myself ""enough with the CGI creatures and crawlies, let's get on with the story."" I'm becoming more and more convinced that CGI is too powerful a tool for most movie makers to handle. There simply isn't enough restraint while using it. Peter Jackson should have stuck with the LOTR movies, as they were more in the nature of an epic storyline. Kong felt like a movie being forced into an epic, as if Peter Jackson felt he had to follow in his own footsteps.

The pacing was slow after the first hour and it became less interesting until the end of the film. Although the energy of the first hour was building it up, it failed to deliver what was promised from the strength of the opening of the film. It would be a good film to sit at home with on a rainy day when you have a lot of free time that you don't know what to do with, but it is very different than what he has done before.",1143504000,2,625,4.008

7602748,3,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson's first movie since the Lord of the Rings trilogy is King Kong, which could have been great on so many levels.  What really killed the film experience for me was its length.  After watching it in the theater and then again on DVD, I was as disappointed as the first time.

I will give the director his dues for production values - the special effects are extraordinary and his direction spot-on.  The fact that he was able make the relationship between the woman and Kong plausible and emotional should have earned him more credit.

Otherwise, the movie's alright.  At 3 hours, a lot of the film could have been cut (an EXTENDED version coming in November?!...) especially the (too) many staring sequences between the two.  A lot of the action was cool looking (the Kong and Rexes sequence is amazing) but some of it was totally unnecessary (the insect sequence grosses me to this day) and made it longer than it should have been.

While I know that I am one of the few who aren't praising the film completely, there are merits to it and it deserves to be seen just because of what he accomplished with the relationship.

Otherwise, it's just another Kong film.",1143417600,3,1175,4.610576923076923

The movie was just plain amazing. It has everything you'd expect in a great movie, action, romance, scary scenes, sad scenes, happy scenes, etc. I was in awe at the end and so was everybody sitting in their seats after the movie was over. I am now a King Kong lover and am buying the DVD RIGHT when it comes out!",1143331200,,474,4.163043478260869
7602750,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Before I get to the part of the review where I praise this film endlessly, using as many adjectives as possible, I should like to point out the single mistake made by Peter Jackson and his crew, a mistake that takes away quite a bit from the movie, especially the end.  It's a mistake that kept King Kong off of my 10 Best of 2005 list.  The rather big mistake is the casting of Jack Black to play Carl Denham.  Granted, this character is supposed to be disliked and greedy, and basically the lowest of all creatures.  But Jack Black can't even take the easiest role in the film and make anything of it.  His lines are said with such little seriousness, that it completely drags the emotion out of some of the scenes in the film.  In the end (I won't spoil it), Black is given a short line, the final line in the film; it's a line of extreme importance to the film, a line that caps off the movie.  Black completely slaughters it.  In the end, I didn't carry out as much of emotion as I was supposed to.

Now, with as much of an emphasis that I have placed on this film, you may be wondering how I am still giving this film five stars.  Peter Jackson is the reason this film gets five stars.  Jackson's vision is what made this film brilliant.  Despite his error in casting Jack Black, he completely makes up for it by casting the amazing Naomi Watts (Academy Award Nominee for Best Actress, 2003, 21 Grams).  Watts is radiant as Ann Darrow, and really was born to play this part (pardon the pun from the movie).  I also like the character of Jimmy (played by Jamie Bell) and his discussion of the Heart of Darkness with Hayes (Evan Park).  It really adds to the substance of the film, giving it a great amount of depth.  The tender scenes between Kong (played by the great character actor Andy Serkis) and Ann are brilliant, and they really improve the mood, and the emotion of the outcome.  Adrien Brody didn't really impress me here, although he wasn't bad, either.  No, the show really belongs to Kong and Ann.  Their brief scenes (which are almost always interrupted by humans) are brilliantly shot.  The cinematography is fantastic, and the effects are amazing.

Peter Jackson has created a wonderful follow up to 2003's Best Picture Winner The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, and his talent as a filmmaker is astonishing.  Jackson will be forever compared with James Cameron (Titanic) as one of the great epic filmmakers of all time.",1143331200,6,2447,4.451685393258427
7602751,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Jackson has given ""King Kong"" the epic treatment the classic story deserves.  The film is a labor of love dedicated to all those pre-teenage boys who grew up watching the original 1933 classic on the million dollar movie on Thanksgiving day and wanting to become filmmakers.  Those people who complain about the 3 hour running time just don't get ""Kong"" and they probably never will.  How else could Peter Jackson do it without making it big, bold and beautiful?  Sure, the exposition has a lot of stuff thrown in for good measure, like the whole ""Heart of Darkness"" commentary (which I would have liked to have seen developed further), but so what?  I thought it was great!

Nothing will surpass the originality and imagery of the original film, as well as Fay Wray and her screams, but Jackson has made a ""Kong"" which pays homage to the original and is a great film in its own right.",1143331200,6,885,4.6050955414012735

The dvd:

Disc 1:

The audio is amazing on this dvd, along with the crystal clear picture

Extras Disc One: Ads basically, the first for a car it shows some of what went into making the ad and also a movie trailer not for Kong though

Disc 2!:

Post Production Diaries, these are great, although they left off Week 13 the Howard Shore score diary :(

I just love these PDs they are truly one of the greatest things Peter Jackson has done in the making of KK05: he lets us know practically everything that went into this film.

Skull Island Feature: wow!  This is a true gem, you learn the history of skull island from beginning to end, don't want to ruin any of the details of the history, but all I can say is watch it it is a real treat and it lets you know some of those mysteries behind skull island.

NY Feature: A very good feature that goes into 1933 NY and details some aspects that you might not of picked up on when watching Kong.

OVERALL

This is one of the truly great works of film in the 21st Century by the greatest director, everyone should truly enjoy this mans profilling of a dream in directing king kong.

With the PJ's 2 Disc Special Edition of King Kong and the Production Diaries creates one amazing 4 disc set that is virtually complete, this is one of the great works of our time.

The leads make the first half of the movie watchable, and once the big man himself gets into the picture (Kong, that is.  Not Jack Black) it's non-stop till the last frame.  The effects are mind-blowing (particularly the brontosaurus stampede), the set-pieces are expertly timed and delivered (the insect pit delivers the kind of full-body-shivers we haven't had since Indiana Jones), and the Empire State Building climax is truly dizzying and spectacular.

Mr. Jackson may have gone a little overboard on the Getting-To-Know-You's of this one, but the ultimate payoff is well worth it.

PS - heed the PG-13 warning.  Definitely some elements that'll give the young ones nightmares (very big, very realistic bugs--and lots of 'em).",1143158400,3,860,5.195652173913044

Spider-pit scene is just plain gross and, once again, goes on too long.  This film suffers what I'm calling the 'Matrix' effect.  Like the Matrix sequels what would have made a decent, no more than 2hr film, becomes an overlong snoozer.  Give a director creative carte blanche and a blank check and you get an overblown mess. Someone should have made Jackson deliver a movie an hour shorter.

7602756,5,B01AHWLX2O,"""King Kong"" is not the best overall movie ever made, but it is the best of it's kind in the last 12 years or so.  Not since the origninal ""Jurassic Park"" has a creature feature been so exhilarating, enthralling, and just plan fun.

The ""Lord of the Rings"" films have established Peter Jackson as one of the best genre talents in the business.  I believe that it is his love and respect for the material that elevates him over most other genre filmakers.  Jackson has said in interviews that the original ""King Kong"" (1933) was the film that inspired him as a child to become a filmmaker.  That inspiration is evident in this gloriously over-the-top yet emotionally grounded update.

In doing the update, Jackson and his crew execute some very interesting character shifts while keeping fairly close to the original narrative.  It's a neat way of paying tribute to a classic while at the same time giving modern audiences something new other than updated visuals to chew on.

The most interesting character redux in ""King Kong"" is not, in my opinion, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody).  Oh, to be sure, the new Driscoll is a completely different character on the outside (in the update he's a playwright; in the '33 version he's the crass yet brave first mate), but he's still the main rival to Kong for Ann's attentions. (I won't say ""affections"" because this big ape doesn't get down that way, if you take my meaning.)

No, instead, the most fascinating character makeover goes to Jack Black's Carl Denham.  In the '33 version, Robert Armstrong played Denham like the ""Great White Hunter"" only with a movie camera instead of a gun.  His leadership qualities are never called into question and he's never blamed for the mistakes that eventually lead to Kong's death.

In the update, Black plays Denham like Orson Welles without the talent, and I must say his performance resonated with me.  I know some folks thought Black a bad choice for Denham, and he would have been had he been forced to emulate Armstrong's interpretation of the character.  But play Denham as an egomaniacal little weasal with a lot of charisma and few if any moral scruples?  For my money, Jack Black hit this one out of the park.  By the end of the film, I wanted to reach through the screen and throttle the arrogant little man, especially when he recites the famous last line.  In the original, there was a sense of truth to the statement, but in the update, it's just another Denham exuse and a way of avoiding responsibility for his actions.  Truly brilliant.

Naomi Watts is wonderful as well.  She updates Ann Darrow without seeming too modern.  She does her best to take care of herself but is forced to put herself in the hands of her simian protector.  (Let's face it, Skull Island is not the ideal place to practice female empowerment, or male empowerment for that matter.)  That decision allows for Ann to bond with Kong in a believable way:  their kinship is born of the simple fact that they are the only two creatures on Skull Island who are not trying to kill and eat each other.

Is ""Kong"" perfect.  Close, but no.  A couple of the effects shots, (particularly the brontosour stampede) have a rushed, unfinished look to them.  They aren't mind numbingly bad, but in comparison to the rest of WETA's work on the film, mediocrity is going to stand out.  I would have also liked to see how in the holy hell they got Kong back to New York.  (I know, I know, you didn't see it in the '33 version, either, but if you're going to update it, than go all the way.)

However, these are minor nitpicks.  The clever in-jokes and references to the first film are an unexpected delight, the visuals are eye-popping, the pacing is excellent, the performances pitch perfect, including a tour-de-force from Andy Serkis as Kong.

If you didn't catch it in the theaters because you had seen the earlier film or simply were not interested, I urge you to give Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" a chance.  You will not be disappointed.",1143072000,8,3993,4.6476462196861625

sick and tired to hear stupid comments about the length of the movie . and yes the beginning of the movie introducing the caracteres needs it and is not lengthy.

as far as the trex scene , this was very exciting to follow unless you suffer add. attention deficit disorder.so could not do any better . much better than the war of the world which was really disapointing and a good adventure movie in the line of what it should be on the big screen. a shoter king kong would have been no story at all. and there is more than kong in the movie and that makes it even more interresting.

so thumbs up for jackson.

7602759,3,B01AHWLX2O,"I was looking forward to this film and just saw the film.  And let me tell you that I was disappointed.  I have a rule that films over 2 and a half hours, every minute needs to add to the story.  This film has an overabundance atmosphere.

The first hour is one long exposition.  Nothing really happens, you get to meet the cast in detail.  It shows the depression and thirties NYC accurately but this is not neccesary for the story.  This should have been only 20 minutes.

The second hour is Skull Island.  Again everything is overdone here.  There are some awesome special effects but they go on and on.  But here I do give credit to some of the best CGI I have ever seen.  About 90% of the live and CGI mesh perfectly to the point you cannot really tell that it is CGI.  The dinosaurs and Kong had depth and weight. Virtually every other film, the CGI never seemed real because there was no appearance of physical weight to the beings.  They seemed to be floating.  In KK they actually look like they are walking and running.

Now with that said, I must go back to the point that much of the scenes here are overly long.  The scene where the raptors attack the brontosaurs goes on forever (I admit it was great but long).  The scene where the guys are attacked by slugs and bugs at the bottom of the ravine has absolutely no point other than to have more special effects.  Even the scene where Kong saves Naomi from the T-Rex's is incredibly overdone.  He kills each of the three T-Rex's at least three times!

The best scenes are purely with Kong and the girl.  Naiomi Watts is great and this is the only time that I wanted the film to go on.  As a matter of fact, I wish the film was almost of Kong and the girl.

The last hour was back in NYC and was actually just a little long but the story changes lessened the impact.

7602766,4,B01AHWLX2O,"I Will keep this review short and sweet. First off I never got the chance to see this movie in theaters, but I have stumbled upon a advanced DVD screening copy (not ripped but the real deal) at a flea market (yes its real duh and has those annoying marquee messages that pop up saying this is for award critics only), basically the movie is good and Jack Black add his own comedic sense of style in this movie as a con man attitude whos down and out and needs to make this last movie on skull island or hes pretty much dead in the water in the film industry if he doesnt pull it off. When they get there they find out more then they bargained for and Jack Blacks character relentlessly tries to see his movie through and through even if it comes to death. But there are times... quite a bit of times where the movie gets drawn out as in it juss takes a lil bit too long to get to the point and the drawled out scenes doesn't really keep it interesting. I'm not in no way comparing this movie to Lord Of The Rings, it does have the same kinda feel to the lord of the rings as in that it takes a lot of time telling the story and i mean a lot. Basically its a good film but it didn't really do too much for me. Great visuals and special effects, good acting, and the scenes with the natives are especially great and well thought out. If it wasn't so ""drawled"" out so to speak I'd give it 5 but i have never seen the original movie so i can't contest to say if it was the same way. so maybe other people will greatly appreciate it. So no one takes me wrong by the way Im a lord of the rings fan and do like the long story telling but it was in no way boring or drawled like some of the scenes in king kong (which are few but long).

+ Good story

+ Jack Black plays his character well and adds some comedic value  to the movie which keeps you drawed in

+Great visual effects and Kudos to the scenes with the native savages and the sacrafice scene

  The new king kong movie is so bad that for most of the second half i was screaming on the inside and fighting against myself to stop from screaming&running away from the room. Really,i cant tell one good thing about this one.

  The visual effects are great. Ok we got it! You don't need to show every single,simple,silly movement of the stupid monkey for 15 minutes.it takes nearly an hour for us to see it already. for that hour we watch that stupid director character, (something black..?)unnecessarry ""we were so poor"" thing, side characters that are obviously destined to die and take nothing but time,some wild folk living inside the LORD OF THE RNGS decoration sets...All of these are the creation of a director who is blinded by too much money,too much fame,too much ideas and lack of real creativity.(taking about jackson,not the one inside the movie :))

Then comes the kong. He holds the girl. Holds her and screams for like 15 minutes.it is like watching a 1 minute clip over'n over again. Then he starts running. For another 15 minutes you watch it run and wonder how the girl has not one single broken bone, cos she should be turned into powder. Then you probably fall asleep,and get awaken by screams. See the kong fighting against some dinasours...for about half an hour.i mean it is actually funny if you can stand watching it.gorilla making kickbox.

in between somewhere,dinasours follow people. For about another hour.dinasours are pointless,the chase is pointless,the scene is pointless,just like the movie itself.

Then they bring the kong,which is bigger in some scenes and smaller in others;into the city.then he kills people there, throwing blondies around. And expect us to get sorry that he is dead.

i mean;in the ending;the planes make about 10 rounds around the tower the kong stands.and we watch like every second of it, all the turns they take. And believe me,those planes are slow.

i was screaming like; kill that stupid monkey so we can go home.

then it dies...oh my god the happiest moment of the movie.and some people (none in the theatre i watched it,luckly.i can beat someone for that)cries that he is dead.it is pure emotional exploitation.

This movie is supposed to be a family movie.so why is the scene with all those creepy monsters in the middle,eating our team in worst ways?i mean;kids are watching that.ok we got it you can make good creatures look like real.

To be honest;this movie is a real waste of time and money.it is just the work of a spoiled director who thinks that he is the king cos he made a legend like LOTR come true. But believe me, neither him nor the kong isnt.",1142640000,16,2670,4.726293103448276
7602770,5,B01AHWLX2O,I see complaints that this movie was to long. I think it's great that it was long. As a matter of fact i wish it was a little longer so more detail would be shown. Like the extended lord of the rings movies show alot more footage which helps explain more of what's going on. Everyone that went to see this movie new ahead of time how long the show was. So if you don't like watching long movies don't go so you can complain about it later and ruin it for others that do. The movie industry will see your complaints and start shortening the films to the point they make no sense and look chopped up. So for now on look for the feature length and if it's to long don't go or watch something else. Other than that the movie was great. I love the fact this movie has been moderinized. Now i will collect it as i wouldn't buy the original for it was to primative for todays special effects. I love it.,1142553600,4,896,4.067796610169491
7602771,3,B01AHWLX2O,"Three stars. That's not too bad, right? Unless, you sit down to watch an ""epic"" with five-star expectations. Ultimately, ""King Kong"" is a letdown, not a bad movie by any means, but far from great.

Don't blame the leading man. Kong was a remarkable cinematic creation, a truly noble savage. The fault here lies with the filmmaker who got terribly sidetracked on Skull Island, ""F/X'ing"" us silly with dinosaurs, anaconda-sized earthworms and insects bigger than Buicks. Sounds cool enough, until you realize all that screen time devoted to some overly long ""secondary"" action sequences prevented us from getting to spend more time with Kong.

Oddly, the entrance of the giant ape was kind of a giant letdown, lacking true tension. In this three hour-plus ""thrill ride,"" there wasn't enough time taken to slow down and really develop much of a Kong mystic. Then, once he appears, not enough ""down time"" was made to -- and this may sound goofy -- develop his character. Peter Jackson had too many other monsters to cram onto the screen.

Furthermore, while I found Kong to be believable, I never was sold on Jack Black's portrayal of a devious, obsessive movie director. He seemed to be winking his way through the part, almost too comical to ever be taken seriously.

Kong was actually about the most convincing ""actor"" in the whole movie, but because Jackson got so carried away overpopulating Skull Island with other beasts, Kong was almost more of a supporting role rather than a lead. Plus, I can't help but be peeved that Jackson coped out in terms of that instant transition from the island back to New York. Seriously, how - with their relatively tiny ship busted up on the rocks - did our heroes transport the Big Ape to the Big Apple?

The climatic scene atop the Empire State building was remarkable, a great movie moment. Unfortunately, too much of the journey to that moment is little more than the stuff and fluff of what ""King Kong"" aspired to be more than, just another hyped-up F/X-packed popcorn movie.",1142553600,3,2017,4.801152737752162
7602772,4,B01AHWLX2O,"The issue with a 3hr remake of a 2hr film is that with nothing new to say, what holds the attention of the audience? Watching the film I was dumbstruck watching the special effects and irritatingly looking for flaws (I couldn't help it.) I didn't want to, but I kept doing it anyway. The entire film is one big special effect and for some reason it doesn't bother me in Star Wars or LOTR, it bugged me here.

I also loved and hated the homage to the original, while it was nice, it was distracting to hear the old dialogue verbatim (as part of the film within the film.) I just remembered more and more how I already new what was going to happen.

In the end just like I got tired of watching the hobbits bounce on the shoulders of the tree ent in ""the two towers"" so here I got very tired of one shot after the next of Watts in Kong's mechanical hand bouncing around before a green screen.

The first and last hours (in New York) are the best, the island part is tedious action and you really decide at this point that Blacks Character has no redeeming qualities (I keep wishing Kong would step on him) as he sacrifices life after life for a movie he never makes. And why? WHY??? Would you display Kong in an theater in Manhattan? It Makes no sense!!! He could take Kong into the middle of Kansas and people by the tens of thousands would drive to see it. What, what where the penguin suits and gowns in the audience supposed to do for the rest of the two hours after the initial shock of looking at a great, giant gorilla wore off? I was dumb struck by that in both films.

Finally, when Kong and Watts are ""together"" on screen the film works. All the action and dialogue is filler to get them together and let the emotional roller coaster begin. Those scenes save the film and Andy Serkis deserves and Academy Award, damnit.

Watching a supergorilla would have been enough already...Having dinosaurs from Jurassic Park and huge insects from Eight legged Freaks there at the same time simply is too much.

King Kong may be 3 hours long but it's bursting with so much humor,excitement and emotion that you won't mind. The first section of the movie that focuses on a shifty filmmaker Jack Black trying to get his movie underway is breezy and funny. The 2nd section on Skull Island where Kong must defend starlet Naomi Watts from hordes of creatures is incredibly exciting full of one pulse pounding sequence after another. The final section in a beautifully realized Depression era New York City packs a heartbreaking punch. King Kong works so well because Kong himself is so expressive not just another forgetable CGI creation(Talking about you Jar Jar Binks!)and Naomi Watts' intensely believable performance as the woman who can actually relate to Kong's loneliness and vulnerability. Like Lord of the Rings this is oviously another labor of love for Peter Jackson so King Kong is more than just a fun Saturday night flick.

7602786,5,B01AHWLX2O,"This movie wraps itself around you; all 3 hrs of it. There are a couple of parts where I wish the blanket were trimmed, but they fade into insignificance; at best they would have shaved off a few minutes. So, who cares?

Why the 'wrapping' metaphor? Because this movie is all about that elusive story-element called 'pay off'. KK is a masterpiece, not only of re-telling a classic and archetypal tale of Beauty and Beast, but also of almost perfect closure of every foreshadowing-pay-off element in sight.

It starts with the music. ""I'm sitting on top of the world"".... Has it ever sounded more sinister, ominous and bitterly satirical? Caged animals and food-lines. The dead giant surrounded by roaches-sorry, 'people'. Yes, here as well, with every line of the song, there's build-up that ultimately finds closure. Later the captain talks about roaches. The giant insects and leeches in the ravine. The milling crowds streaming into the theater. The milling crowds surrounding the fallen giant. Everything fits together. I watched it thrice and I've yet to find an event that didn't have closure. Even the interminable dino-stampede had a fore-shadowing purpose, but I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to figure it out.

Jackson of course delights in overdoing his creatures; the appellation 'Giant Weta' suddenly assumed new meaning. Real 'Giant Wetas' can be quite sizable and look pretty intimidating; not for the faint-hearted. Jackson just took the name and ran with it. Masking the story-telling significance of the events by making it gruesome and quite scary. That's the way to do it. I don't know if Jackson is fully aware of what he did-sometimes these things are gut decisions, not necessarily cerebral-but whatever prompted him to make his directorial and editing decisions...it worked.

The Beauty and the Beast. Here, too, is something that most other reviewers missed. Because it isn't a 'love'-story between human and simian at all. That's how it was sold to us, and everybody bought it; but it's so much more subtle and, dare I say it?, 'perceptive'. Those who see the story as the boy-girl thing between ape and girl will miss it altogether.

The real 'love' story actually _is_ between Ann and Jack. He's the human analogue to the ape, the one who can be what the ape cannot-and who ultimately _is_ what he ought to be. The 'love' story between KK and Ann is more subtle-it is the tale of two creatures, from different worlds, who discover that beauty is...ahh, did you think I was going to say 'transcendent'? Well, possibly that's what Jackson intended to convey, but it could just as easily be understood as beauty simply everywhere, but until it is perceived it might as well not be. That, of course, is the essence of beauty: that it is indeed in the eye of the beholder, for 'beauty' is always 'beauty-perceived'; there is none other.

KK is also about 'nobility'; something usually ignored or downgraded in its importance in most films made at the moment. The ape is savage, because he has to be in order to survive. Yielding to softer aspects of one's nature is lethal in that world; even apes can be brought down, in this instance by the closest thing to human existing in that island-enclosure, namely those gargoylish bats; on the mountain top, where KK, and others of his kind, appear to have gone before: the top of their world, whence they could watch beauty; the only kind available here, dimly understood, yet perceived: a sunset. Now KK takes the one other creature whom he has perceived as 'beautiful' to that same, dangerous place; but this time, while he is not killed himself by the sharp-toothed creatures tearing at him, it is by their agency that Ann is taken from him-and also by her human love, Jack, of course; with her, one must emphasize, complete collusion-he is lured to his final doom. Nobility battling it out with savage and basic instincts, urges, imperatives. Nobility wins; nobility instantiated in one's preparedness to protect that which one holds dear, for whatever reason, to any degree necessary. It's a fundamental animal urge; yet it is the one that allows even an animal to achieve nobility, dignity and purpose. The indictment of the human roaches-be they the, extremely un-PC, savages on Skull Island or the hyper-refined crowds going to see the 8th Wonder of the World-is all the more searing, because they appear to have no sense of it; and neither do they have even the tiniest shred of empathy for anything outside their own horizon.

Ann's sentiments for the ape are more like 'compassion' than 'love'; understanding of the divided nature of that giant creature, on the human side of sentience in many ways, yet constrained to be something else because of what he is. Is there a better metaphor for humanity itself, and the eternal conflict between what we are and _need_ to be in order to survive and be 'human'; and yet there is that other thing that makes us want to be something 'other'-which we cannot be, individually or socially, because we would cease to be human. In the same vein KK is what he is, and he can only do what he does because he is that way. The paradox of our own existence.

Jack is KK's human mirror-image, driven by the same instincts, but here they are constrained by his civilized upbringing. He is not a fighting machine, but a playwright-yet everything he does, shortly after meeting Ann, is essentially driven by the same motives as KK's: to protect her. He doesn't understand this at first; civilization and its essentially trivial accoutrements prevent him from seeing that which truly matters to him. But in the end, after the ape has fallen to his death, he's at the top of the Empire State Building with her.

So, you see, the story isn't as simple as some would have it. Some humans come off very badly-especially those who have lost sight of the things that matter, and who become immersed in trivial self-importance and the gazillion meaningless pursuits offered by society to those who need them. But not all have lost perspective and others find it. The ape overall exhibits more nobility than most humans though. This is not so much anthropomorphization of the ape, but an indictment of the insectization of humans.

KK is not just a good movie, but a great one; done with obvious affection for the genre and the story-with more depth and dimensions than either of its predecessors; more than I had expected or even dared hope for.

7602787,2,B01AHWLX2O,"Let me preface this by saying that I had great expectations for ""Kong"" because of LOTRs, which Peter Jackson et al. created and put to screen in some of the greatest films since Hollywood's Golden Age.

In my opinion, ""Kong"" failed to live up to the hype (many newspapers ran stories arguing that it would become only the second movie to gross $1 billion in the U.S.).  The first hour is boring, and not because of the lack of action.  It is boring in the contrary to the first hour of ""Spider-Man 2,"" which contained little first-hour action but maintained a great sense of character development and humor.  The next two hours are just too long, espeically the exuberant and exaggerated use of semi-slow motion filming during the Skull Island native scenes (bringing to mind the ridiculous filmmaking in ""The Patriot"").  The whole scene where the giant leeches and bugs kill the party also reflected years of cheesy film violence from inferior filmmakers to Peter Jackson.  The writing was less mature and refined than the LOTR series, including the use of profanity and cheesy lines instead of actually showing greater intelligence in the scripting of the movie.

I absolutely loved the scenes where Kong was actually on screen and agree with the Academy Awards(c) decisions to grant them awards for sound, design, etc.  The T-Rexes vs. Kong scenes were incredible, Anne and Kong's relationship was much deeper than in previous ""Kongs,"" and the final scenes in New York were masterful.

All in all, this movie lacked too much to become either a great movie or a classic movie.  2 or 2 1/2 stars are all it deserves.",1141776000,8,1617,4.805054151624549

7602790,3,B01AHWLX2O,"I thought I'd write my review of this movie by comparing the classic 1933 version to the new Peter Jackson 2005 version.

First off, if you haven't seen both KONGS, you will find spoilers in my write-up that follows. In that case, you may just want to skip reading this.

Otherwise, here are my thoughts:

New York City of the '30s: Both movies handled it great. The original, obviously, because it WAS the 1930's when the movie was made. But the 2005 version did a great job covering the look and feel of that era in the Big Apple. ADVANTAGE: TIE

Jack Black vs Robert Armstrong as Carl Denim: Watching Black was about like watching someone scrape their fingernails on a blackboard. The guy can't act. Period. ADVANTAGE: 1933 KONG

The natives of Skull Island: I have to admit, the natives in the 2005 version were much scarier. But before I give the nod to the 2005 Kong version here, I have to go on to a few more ""native"" items, the first being the capture of Ann from the ship. In the original the natives quietly come up in small boats alongside the ship and kidnap her. In the 2005 version, the natives are Olympic Champions as they pole-vault all the way from the island to the ship and SOMEhow get her back to the island with them (pole-vaulting back?) CALL THE OLYMPICS!  The second item I didn't like about the 2005 natives was that they just disappeared from the Island after the start of the movie. Where were they when Kong came pounding on the huge door? Because of these items, I say: ADVANTAGE 1933 KONG

Fay vs. Naomi and the way they covered their role as Ann Darrow. I have one question. Since when did this movie turn into a true LOVE story? Kong is a huge beast. Kong kills anyone and anything in his path that prevents him from getting what he wants (in this case, Ann). So what would the correct response be for someone in danger? To SCREAM! And that's exactly what Fay did in the 1933 original. While Naomi tumbled, juggled, and went ice skating with him instead. This brought back images from the terrible 1976 remake. And what's with Naomi being the ONLY person running around a snow covered New York City at the end of the movie, without wearing a coat of any kind? Not only that, but actually WANTING to climb to the very top of the Empire State Building crown to be closer to the giant ape. Can you imagine how cold and windy it would be at THAT altitude? Not to mention how icy/slippery the stairs would have been up there as well. Fay wanted to stay clear of Kong. Naomi (coatless) wants to hug his leg to protect him! ADVANTAGE: 1933 KONG

The look of KONG: For what they had available in 1933, Kong looked pretty darn good. There was a lot of work put into his animation and the other creatures as well. But I WILL concede that he looked far more realistic in the 2005 version. ADVANTAGE: 2005 KONG

KONG vs the TYRO: The original had a great battle complete with wonderful sound effects as the Tyro whipped his tail about. Even knocking Kong into a tree that topples which was holding Ann. But the new version has MULTIPLE TYROS for KONG to fight. And what a fight it is. Very well done. Except for the fact that Kong held Ann in his hand for the entire fight and she would have suffered some of the nastiest whiplash this side of a head-on train collision!  The new 2005 version even has KONG doing the infamous cracking of the TYRO's jaw scene. But there's one thing the original has that the 2005 version doesn't. AFTER the fight there is a scene where Driscoll has to jump in and out of the mouth of the TYRO in order to continue following KONG. In that scene you can see the blood streaming from the jaw of the TYRO. This scene isn't shown in the 2005 version. So, in this category I'd say: ADVANTAGE: TIE

Speaking of missing items from the 2005 version, how about the brontosaurous chomping on some of the crew members? How about Kong vs the Snake in the cave? And Kong chewing on some of the natives? And Kong STOMPING the natives into the mud? And Kong chomping on people in New York City when he escapes? And tossing the woman to her death that he pulls from an apartment high up in one building? And of course, what about the VERY famous subway train scene where Kong smashes the track and the conductor only sees Kongs head and the whites of his eyes coming up through the tracks ahead?  Every one of these are scenes that helped make the original as famous as it is. So which is better? Including them? Or not? This is an easy one. ADVANTAGE: 1933 KONG

When Kong came crashing through the huge gate on Skull Island, the original had much more tension to the scene. The bolt across the door slowly bent and cracked. The crew AND the natives all piled on together in an effort to stop the rampaging gorilla! The 2005 version had Kong just quickly batter through the door. ADVANTAGE: 1933 KONG.

MUSIC - There's just no comparison here. The 1933 KONG has one of the greatest soundtracks of all time. The music worked WITH the action on the screen. The 2005 soundtrack is forgetable. ADVANTAGE: 1933 KONG

THE INFAMOUS SPIDER/INSECT SCENE - Pulled from the original movie because it was thought to distract viewers from thinking about KONG, the 2005 version DID include it. Granted, the insects were hideous. It was a scary scene. But since when does someone that doesn't know how to shoot a gun shoot directly AT someone covered with insects and ONLY shoot the insects off of him without one shot hitting the crewman? Because of this stupidity it would have been better to HAVE eliminated this scene. And again: ADVANTAGE: 1933 KONG.

I could go on for a lot longer, but just counting up the ADVANTAGES that I've already shown above, you can see that I don't consider the 2005 KONG version to even come CLOSE to the original 1933 version.

In a way, I'm surprised though. Mainly because Peter Jackson said he loved the original. I thought he would pay better homage to it. Not so.",1141689600,8,5926,4.431985294117647
7602791,5,B01AHWLX2O,"It seems that so many of the negatives are aimed at the film's length.  Perhaps those who have a hard time sitting still for 3 hours will enjoy the film when they can take periodic breaks.  I had no problem sitting for three hours.  The film is basically in four parts: New York, The Boat Trip, Skull Island, Back to New York.  I was captivated by the first part as I watched an amazing depiction of New York City circa 1930 in full color. I also enjoyed getting to know the characters and am at odds with those who disliked Jack Black.  He had that almost crazed look in his eyes and struck the right tone as a director who would risk so much to achieve fame. Naomi Watts was absolutely radient and was a joy to watch.  The Skull Island sequences provided dazzling, edge-of-your-seat entertainment with a truly believable CGI ape battling harrowing creatures.  And lastly, the Empire State scene was breathtaking and Peter Jackson did a great job creating empathy for the great Kong.  All told, this was an excellent modern reimagining of a great story.",1141689600,9,1054,4.569148936170213

I saw this new King Kong at the theater and couldn't wait to see it for I'm a huge Kong fan. I will say that Naomi Watts gave a good performance but I was not impressed by Jack Black's performance as a filmmaker in this movie. The over 3 hour long movie does past by fast but I found the first half rather boring! It seems like they will never arrive at Skull Island. I will say that their rendention of Skull Island was beautiful. The whole movie had beautiful scenery and great special effects. However, I could have done without all the dinosaurs in this movie. It almost made me feel like I was watching Jurassic Park! and all the huge bugs..... kindy silly even though the point of these huge bugs was to show us that everything on Skull Island grew to great proportions..... including the 8th wonder of the world..... Kong! Although good, it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. I found there was too much animation in this movie unlike the 1976 version which didn't contain an animated Kong, making Kong look much more real. Congrats to Peter Jackson for his success in making this movie. Even though not extremely impressed with this remake, I will buy it when it is released on DVD on March 28th, just to add to my Kong collection.",1141430400,3,1414,4.359848484848484
7602796,5,B01AHWLX2O,"When it comes to King Kong, the movie is well, the King. Peter Jackson's flair for the dramatic and his detalied action secquences are top notch. Obvoisly, the gigantic ape was CG, but the way it interacted with the imcomprable Naomi Watts was superb.

Though the movie differed in certain areas from the original, it has only made the movie better in my opinion. The fact that Kong and Watts had a connection, as wierd as it may sound, worked! In the original, the blonde bombshell was more afraid of the beast then she was in this version. The story was somewhat in context of a beauty and the beast kind of setting.

The scale and granduer used by Peter Jackson is amazing. I put him higher then good old Spielberg, Ron Howard, and put him more on the level of George Lucas. It sounds odd, but Jackson has the LOTR trilogy under his belt along with 11 Oscars. :) This film will surely fill his mantle if not full already.

Once again, Watts was amazing. The way she depicted a struggling actress was flawless. She, in this version, was actually part of a somewhat love triangle with herself, Kong, and Driscoll (played by Adrian Brody), and she pulled it off. Mind you her choice at the end was easy, but still. The fact that she actually in my opinion, knew what Kong was trying to do as far protect her, and the fact that she cared in this movie made it leaps and bounds better then the original. THe little hand signals, the looks, everything was perfect and really caught the mood of the movie. Even towards the end when Kong was being bombarded, he cared more about Anne (Watts), then he did himself. This love story, as odd as it may be, is original, and awesome.

Peter Jackson took this timeless classic, put a spin on it, and made it an epic tragedy/love story/adventure. When people talk about King Kong as a classic, they will undoubtably be talking about this movie. I personally saw it 3 times in the theatre, it was that good.

The best part about having it on DVD, is that even though the movie is quite long (a little over 3 hours), you can pause it so you don't miss a beat.

This movie can be summed up in one word... GREAT!",1141430400,2,2145,4.376884422110553

7602800,2,B01AHWLX2O,"As a technical tour de force Peter Jackson's re-make of the classic 1933 ""King Kong"" has some merit, but as a humdinger of a story with thrills and chills the original has the new film beaten by a mile. How ironic, in that director Jackson and his screen writers had the blueprint of the original script in the palm of their hands, yet they managed to emerge with a film that never took off: the story meandered all over the place. The early New York City scenes were duly impressive but as with everything else in the movie, done to excess. As the movie went on the promise of a major motion picture event evaporated and the film became an endurance test on the hindquarters. Here is a film where the hype took precedence over actual achievement. Jackson's Kong is a movie so enamored of its subject , so filled with ""in references"" to Old Hollywood and Broadway (granted, amusing up to a point) that it lays there like the huge monster's corpse at the film's finale. There is no forward momentum, no real character development, and absolutely no chemistry between the lovely Naomi Watts and Adrien Brody. who is badly miscast. The original ""King Kong"" remains the definitive version of this story.",1141344000,13,1199,4.633802816901408

7602802,4,B01AHWLX2O,"It is WAY too long.  I can appreciate that Jackson, along with the spectacular LOTR's tilogy, is a wonderful visionary & knows how to do action to rival Cameron & Speilberg.  HOWEVER, Jackson just tries WAY too hard here.  I loved the atmosphere of when they got to Skull Island in the fog.  Kinda creepy.  But how long did that scene last, 10 minutes?  Just get off the d*** boat already.  They needed maybe 2-3 minutes of mood & then get off the boat.  This isn't Titanic.  Then comes the dinasour stampede which was so obviously fake looking.  Could have saved about 10 minutes  Later we have a bug attack that was a complete waste of film.  Another 5-10 minutes or so cut.  Oh & about the dinasour attacking Ann & King in the vines...a few snaps were cool.  After about 10 I was like, ""ok, this is getting tedious.  Move on.""  There's about 2-3 minutes nixed.  Developing a romance before Ann is captured would also have been nice.  One minute Ann & the screenwriter ar ebickering, th enext minute they're kissing.  If you were gonna need more time make it on a this & not on effects.  The great thing sbaout LOTR's is that it developed the chracters enough so yo cared what happened to them.  Now, I know, peopel will say, ""oh but LOTR's was 3 movies.""  Yes, taht's true, but you can still develop your characters more in a 2-3 hour movie enough to care about them.  It's bad when your lead actress has more chemistry with a CGI gorilla than Adrian Brody.  ""I wrote a play for you.""  WOW, he must love her because of that.  Jack Black is also NOT a serious actor.  He is & will always be a COMIC actor.  Ok, I know Robin Williams does both well, but if Black was gonna be realistic as a serious actor, nix the raised eyebrow thing.  Plus his famous line at the end was said so matter of factly it was like he was reading the line from the script.  I cringed.  I don't fault Jackson, as I said he is one amazing visionary.  I blame the editor for it.  Plus Andy Serkis, well apologes to the actual actor, does another terriffic job as a CGI character.  This Kong spend a lot more time developing the ""relationship"" with Ann & Kong & it did it rather successfully IMO.  Nix the dead pan Jack Black line & I really felt for Kong.  I credit Serkis' facial expressions for that.  But, I cant forget Watts, either.  What was with teh jailer & the criminal, too.  At least in The Green Mile the friendship, or whatever you call it, they had was credible.  I didn't really believe this one for a second.  Again, too much time spent on effects not enough on character development.  Quite entertaining, but overly long.",1141084800,2,2614,4.349272349272349
7602803,4,B01AHWLX2O,"This is an amazing piece of work, the special effects are simply spectacular and the digital King Kong has to be seen to believe, I mean his fur even rustles the wind.  The battles on the island between Kong and the TRex's is as visually brillant as anything I have ever seen of film, but alas this film is hella long.  Does Peter Jackson know what a film editor is, the first half of the film, though well done, drags and Watts and the unique looking Brody, have no chemistry and that hurts.  Black was an odd choice, but he works here, sort of.  When I was young my Dad took me to see the 70's Kong, uh hardly the 30's classic, but I remember how beautiful Jessica Lange was and what great chemistry she had with Kong, it was  touching and strangely erotic, but this film loses all of that, Watts and Kong have a totally platonic relationship, I guess this is a P.C. Kong...too bad, because it makes the ending, though sad, not as heartbreaking as watching Lange scream from the depths of her soul when he dies, it was Langes breakout role and she really made you feel that she had fallen in love with Kong, a real beauty and the beast, this film lacks that element and I think it hurts the overall power of Kongs death.  I do totally recommend this DVD, it's a visually spectacular film, that needed a Jessica Lange, and an editor...too bad it posseses neither.",1140998400,4,1364,4.350393700787402
7602804,1,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson did a fine job wrangling the long, winding opus of Lord of the Rings to the screen with a good, enthusistic cast, decent effects and a fair appreciation for the source while not being a total slave to it.  His efforts were lavished with good box office, plenty of recognition, awards along with critical acclaim and a blank check from the studios on what he wanted to do next.

Can't blame the guy for wanting to wallow in a little self-indulgence, but to take moviegoers still high on his LOTR experience along for the ride was...well, a bit much.

Jackson's ""King Kong"" could be a really decent 2 hour popcorn flick trapped in 3 hours plus of pretension, ill-advised casting, lazy writing, half-baked effects, overwrought action sequences and an extremely uneven tone.  Is it a adventure-drama? Is it a matinee schlock-fest? Is it ""Titanic"" with fur? Who knows...it is definately TOO LONG and too disjointed to tell. Jackson needs to remember what EDITING is and realize not every story has to take a ""week"" to tell. His theatrical, far-superior edits of the LOTR movies prove he can do this...there were times while sitting through ""Kong"" I groped for the remote...thinking I was at home watching the super-extended, scrapings-off-the-cutting-room-floor DVD version instead of the theatrical release...jeez, one can only imagine how long that extended version's gonna be...and you know it's coming! Storylines that are start and end with no resolution and characters have motivations that suck the life out of what was a simple adventure with a terrifying protagonist..instead of the kinder, gentler beast we get here. The oddest choice is having Denham(the completely awful Jack Black) utter the last classic line (as the character did in the original)  after Jackson has spent 3 plus hours transforming this character into a remorseless, greedy SOB...huh? The only performer who comes off unscathed by the whole affair is Naomi Watts...she gamely gives it her all and her scenes with Kong are what make this long affair watchable.

I'm still agog that so many mainstream critics jumped on the high-praise bandwagon for this dud...

Save your money folks...this beastly turkey will be beat to death on basic cable soon enough (although with commercials it'll take a week to air) and hope that Jackson has this out of his system enough to tackle something fresh and original with his talent.",1140998400,17,2408,5.050377833753148
7602805,4,B01AHWLX2O,"King Kong is a splendid motion picture.  It has the scope and spectacle of films like Titanic and Jurassic Park, yet has the intimacy of any low-budget character drama packed into a grand film.  It's the full package.  Naomi Watts is the emotional anchor of the film.  She does a magnificent job forming a relationship with a the giant ape.  Andy Serkis's movements were used to create Kong's movements, as he did with Gollum in Lord of the Rings.  Adrien Brody serves the story well as Jack Driscoll.  My own personal delight was seeing Jack Black in a roll that wasn't comedic.  Sure, he has his ""Jack Black moments"" in this film, but, I like it when a typecasted actor departs from the norm and does something different, even if it may or may not challenge is acting skills.

The technical virtues of this film can not be described with words.  These special effects, sets, makeup, costumes, etc. are undeniably some of the best ever put on screen.  Peter Jackson's technical department deserves all praise and honor for their efforts.

There have been some complaints about the film's pace and length.  I would tend to agree that there are a few minor quibbles about the length of the film.  Simply put, it could have been shorter.  The script seems to go into avenues it never fully finishes.  There are characters in the film, whom we share intimate, personal moments with, and then there is no follow-up to their characters.  There is no story arc to their existence.  They are developed, then eaten for dinosaurs, killed by natives, or simply forgotten.  Why spend the time developing certain characters if there isn't going to be any follow up to begin with?  And while we're on the subject of characters, it's in the third act that the principal characters begin to sink into obscurity.  Jack Driscoll is integral to the first two acts, but, in the last fifteen minutes, his presence becomes hollow.  He has one heroic moment when Kong is rampaging through New York, and then he is virtually forgotten.  And what happened to Ann Darrow?  She barely says anything, nor does she show as much emotion as when she did on Skull Island?  It's only Carl Denham's character, to me at least, that comes full circle.  But, in all these, it needs to be said that this King Kong has a personality and a heart, and we certainly feel that tear when he falls off the Empre State Building.

King Kong is grand filmmaking.  I loved the film.  Truthfully, I'd give it 4 and a half stars, not five, because of the aforementioned flaws.  Still, I loved it.  I felt like was watching another Titanic of Jurassic Park.  Something we've all seen before, but, it's done in such a way that it still captures our imaginations, and we know we won't see a grand epic like this for another few years.",1140998400,2,2781,4.612244897959184
7602806,5,B01AHWLX2O,"This is the best film of the year. Peter Jackson has outdone himself once again. The special effects are truly amazing, but its Naomi Watts who truly makes this film shine. She is simply beautiful. The story is wonderful and exciting. Everything from the acting to the films score is perfect. This is a film not to be missed. We will perhaps never see a film if this magnitude ever again. Thank You Mr Jackson!!!",1140912000,2,412,4.506666666666667
7602807,1,B01AHWLX2O,"This movie is absolute garbage. I know coming of LOTR, the next film was going to be an up hill battle for Jackson, but I had some faith. When I heard he was going to Kong, I thought why waste your time, Kong is a classic case closed. This film confirms that. There is nothing, NOTHING good about it. The acting is bad, the screenplay was horrible, the FX shots were lame, the directing was too frantic at times , and the action was overbearing and LONG at times. Don't get me wrong, the first half with the characters' background being established is good, the big inside joke/reference of the first film's director (whose name escapes me) and Fay Wray, it gave me hope that from what I saw in the previews that the movie wasn't going to be that bad. I was wrong, once they get to Skull Island, meet Kong, and get back to NY... from that on out TRASH!

If anything could have saved this, it would have been the prospect of the film being turned into a 2 or 3 part movie. The first could have been how the map gets into Jack Black's chubby fingers (which Black is still a HORRIBLE ACTOR), the second could have been about Kong and the other dealings of Skull Island, and if they were to have done a 3 parter, the last could have been about Kong in NY,

The absolute worst thing is the FX! Just trash. The effect shot with Brody and Black between the running dinosuars' legs is so bad, but not as bad as Kong himself.

Kong looked as fake in the previews as he did in the final film.

And the prize for worst FX shot in this trash goes to when Kong falls and hits the ground, there is NO IMAPCT SITE! NO CARS OVER TURNED, NO DUST IN THE AIR OR ON PEOPLE, THE CITY STREET IS NOT BROKEN UP AT ALL, NO WINDOWS IN STORE FRONTS OR CARS BUSTED OUT FROM THE IMPACT OF A WHAT 30 FOOT TALL APE WEIGHING WHAT 2 MAYBE 3 TONS!

All in all this was one of the worst times at the movies I have had in a long time. The best part was the previews for Miami Vice, and The Inside Man.

And I know some people might say: ""Why did I go then?"" I just didn't feel like sitting through Harry Potter again with my mom and sister.",1140825600,15,2104,4.057831325301205

this was the BEST movie i have EVER seen! i was very surprised. after seeing the first King Kong i doubted that this would be good. but boy how wrong i was. I found my self crying and applauding at the end. The actors all do very well and the graphics are great. the music is also something to look forward to. i was disappointed that the soundtrack did NOT have all of the songs on it! I do not know if there will be an extended coming out, but if it does it will  be December 31. one scene in the movie, the insect scene was said to be cut out in the old version because it made test audiences vomit. just think of what would happen if they saw this one! In the theater i remember watching many people race out of the theater and hide in the bathroom for that scene. I do not find it that bad and most movie fans will not. but if you hate bugs, skip the scene. one thing that i do love about the movie is that Kong has a heart. And anne does too. in the old one, all you saw was a large monster and a screaming girl. not in this one. the Central Park scene, for some reason made me cry. yep. mainly because people like me get attached to movie characters and are sad to see them go. I DO know that there are some scenes cut. they will probally make an extended to put them in, because i see that on the special features there ARE no deleted scenes. the Piranadohn and some other movie making scenes are NOT there.  this version is cheaper so if you don't really care about that then ok.  Andy Serkis is a GREAT character in it. he plays Kong and the cook Lumpy, who regrettably has a bad death, both i mean not just Lumpy. so i would say, if you are debating what to buy, get this! it is the best and i am sad that there are only 5 stars because it needs a 10. music and all. the music is the best part though. but, Carl's eyebrows are pretty cool too. lol.",1140825600,4,1985,3.955

I had kept saying it was stupid and I didn't want to see a movie with a giant monkey running around.  I entered the theater pretty much pissed that I wasn't going to be able to go see Rent a second time.  I left it feeling totally different.  That movie changed me in so many ways.  I felt compassion for a CGI monkey.  Kong became almost like your best friend and you wanted to fight for him.  The acting performances given by Naomi Watts, Adrien Brody, and Jack Black were amazing.  I have so much respect for Naomi Watts.  It was truly an AMAZING acting job.  For most of the film she is acting with a green screen and men in costumes poking her with giant sticks, yet she doesn't let that stop her from giving a great, tear-drawing performance.  Even actors in some of the smaller parts such as Preston (Colin Hanks) and Jimmy (Jamie Bell) give an awesome performance.

Even though he reminds me more of filmmaker/actor legend Orson Wells than original KK's Bob Armstrong I was impressed with his satisfying take of Carl Denham. As for comely Naomi Watts she is effective as Ann Darrow as well. Personally I liked her best when she conveyed more meaning with body language than the spoken word (like in her dialogue-free scenes in the end in NYC). Adrian Brody is not well cast at all as Jack Driscoll (now a playwright rather than first mate as he was in the original to give the new film a more showbiz feel). Brody isn't much of an action hero or that good at romance with Watts ----too bad Bruce Willis wasn't interested in this part.,1140652800,2,716,4.515384615384615

They arrive there not knowing what's going to happen but then they meet the natives....scary looking natives who kill some of them but they flee. The natives eventually come back and kidnap Naomi Watts, bring her back to their place and strap her down so that she can be sacrificed to KONG, who is a massive Ape. Black, his crew and Adrien Brody (The Pianist, The Jacket), who plays Jack Driscoll, go off with the captain and his men to go rescue Watts from her awaited doom but she is taking into the jungle by the Ape and suddenly Kong becomes lost in her beauty. The hunt continues as the rest of the gang faces great perils, dinosaurs, lizards, nasty looking bugs to try to resue Watts. Jack Black wants to capture the Ape and they do by cholorforming it. They bring Kong back to Manhattan where Kong becomes King Kong: The 8th Wonder of the World but Kong then escapes causing more havoc, breaking out in the streets, climbing building...he even throws blonde woman away as he tries to find his. Then we all know what happens, King Kong climbs the empire state building with the blonde girl, airplanes come and so forth. Peter Jackson triumphs making it a welcome tribute the to the original one (which is still good by the way), with an excellent cast despite some cheesy effects...an example being the longneck dinosaurs pursuing the resue party. This blows away the Jeff Bridges one too (which was god awful and even more god awful when they put a crown on King Kong's head in that one).

7602815,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I'm biased when I say this movie was underrated. Peter Jackson, in my mind, surpassed his own paramount in LOTR with King Kong. And yet, because of its length and its dependence on CG effects, this movie was criticized wrongly. This is one of the best films of 2005, if not the most rounded and complete. The story is not only a step up from the original, but it comically nods to the original, once again showing Jackson's love and respect for the 1933 version. So few remakes can capture the audience like the original, but Kong certainly comes close. What people saw in 1933 is probably comparable to this masterpiece that Jackson has created here. Everything is working in this film: the acting, the writing, the music (JAMES NEWTON HOWARD!!), and above all the effects. And not just Kong, which makes the CG Hulk look like a Looney Toon, but everything is so grandiose and marvelous that you can't help but become immersed in the environment. The climactic scene atop the Empire State Building is probably one of the most amazing scenes I have ever viewed on film. It is absolutely beautiful. If I have to concede anything negative about this movie, it's that Jack Black had to utter the final line in the film. If Fay Wray had lived long enough, it would have made the moment flawless. But I digress, since I have yet to find anything negative about the film itself. Peter Jackson previously caught my attention with Lord of the Rings, but with King Kong he showed me that he is not a one-tune director. He is probably one of the best directors in the business right now, since he has the money to make the movies HE wants to make (not the ones WE want him to make. It's an important distinction). Above all, I cannot get over how amazed I was by this film. Truly, it is a masterpiece in the medium, and I pains me to read how viciously some people attack it, without taking the time to truly understand the message. Sometimes filmmakers get caught up in the grandeur of the spectacle. But in Peter Jackson's case, King Kong is a spectacle that defies reality.

Buy it. Watch it. Love it.",1140307200,10,2094,4.510526315789473
7602816,5,B01AHWLX2O,"Though the Oscars mostly ignored this film, it was one the best of 2005. The SFX were amazing and Naomi Watts turned in a great performance.

7602817,4,B01AHWLX2O,"Giving the original King Kong an A, I would have to give this one a solid B. The deleted scenes should have been in Jackson's original version and much of the early New York scenes cut. Only enough of the New York scenes were needed to set the time and characters. The rest was a waste of film. The creature computer effects are stunning as is the scenery on Skull Island. The human characters are so so character wise and Jack Black as Carl Denham was terrible. Naomi Watts did give a fairly good performance though. The star of the film of course is Kong ( played by Andy Serkis using motion capture )and the Weta team did an incredible job of making him truely believable.

7602818,5,B01AHWLX2O,"What a Beautiful & amazing movie! Naomi Watts is absolutely breath-taking!  This is now my all time favorite besides Batman Begins, Pearl Harbor and Titanic!
This remake of King Kong has so much heart, so much feeling, so much passion! I saw it a third time just today. This is, hands down, the BEST motion picture that I have ever seen in my life! It was AMAZING! So thrilling! The acting was incredible! The characters have such depth! The special effects are magnificent!  The musical score by James Newton Howard (Batman Begins) is amazing! This movie was pure entertainment with so much heart! I looked around & didn't see a dry eye anywhere.
I have to say though, I think Peter Jackson may have fibbed just a tiny bit. He said that this remake is solely inspired from the 1933 classic that he loved so much staring Fay Wray. Well, in that version, Fay Wray was terrified of Kong from the moment she was sacrificed to Kong until the moment he was killed. It was Jessica Lange that started the caring for Kong thing. So I think the 1976 version inspired Peter Jackson more then he's letting on.
This incarnation of King Kong is the absolute best though! It's just phenomenal! Two Thumbs up to Naomi Watts! She was brilliant in this movie! You could totally feel the bond that formed between her and Kong! She was amazing! What an incredible and wonderful movie! I can't wait to own this and the Director's Cut on DVD!",1140048000,7,1421,4.546875
7602819,3,B01AHWLX2O,"What a lovely 90 minute film that lies within these 187 minutes......  To me the 2005 film only works when it sticks close to the original of 1933. The cast is great though, but sadly Kong is just one of many monsters on the island and the most exciting scene is the escape from frightened dinosaurs....  The excape from the insects were cut in 1933 because it took attention from Kong. Why didn`t they learn???

In 1976 Kong is a great beast with almost human qualities - sort of a missing link. Here he is back being a gorilla of oversize and it is a puzzle why Ann is not killed by his rough treatment of her early on. The Jimmy-Hayes relationship goes nowhere and they could easily have been omitted.

The 1976 film has great locations, while this is a blue-screen effort and u see it much too often. I mean several cliffs and stones in the shape of a gorilla?  It's  enough with Skull island... Ann`s vaudeville tricks and their Bambi-moment in New York is BAAAAAAAAAAD...  The New York sequences should have been better, but the Empire State Buidling-scene survives...

The sacrifising of Ann is both good in 33 and 76, here - it's dramatic, but the first sight of Kong is just shadow.......And magical moments are far between because Jackson doesn`t dare to slow down...

In the 1976 film we get to love Kong....  Here... well we don`t....  It`s a great actioner, but I wish Jackson could have relaxed a bit.... It's funny the way Denham refers to Fay Wray early on(""but she`s shooting over at RKO"")

Many people feel Kong is a racist. But that`s insane... Of course he warms up to a whiteperson - she`s a novelty - a new thing to him..... He is just curious and collects her as a prized possession.

But it is an OK contribution to the myth of Kong. It's NOT the best Kong, but it's OK in a trilogy of the giant....",1140048000,5,1823,4.422155688622754
7602820,5,B01AHWLX2O,"The new ""King Kong"" is one of the most epic action/adventure movies ever, a mega-budget blockbuster done the way mega-budget blockbusters oughtta be (but often aren't): that is, involving great characters (human or otherwise) in a great high-octane story that's fascinating, emotionally powerful, and completely engaging on many levels.  This is, without question, the real deal.

  Set in the Great Depression, a number of struggling and/or out-of-luck actors, actresses, film crewmen and a playright, and an oceangoing ship's crew, all find themselves cajoled, persuaded, conned or otherwise weaseled by shifty but humorous filmmaker Carl Denham (Jack Black, who alternates masterfully between being the underdog-with-a-dream you want to root for and the pompous, manipulative, pretentious little schmuck you want a giant gorilla to come along and stomp on) into sailing across the world to an uncharted island.  On this mysterious island whose location Denham has somehow become privy to, he plans to film his latest masterpiece, a work that he's certain will bring him worldwide fame, vast wealth and immortal respect, as certain as he was with each of his previous movies which went by with moderate (at most) success each time.  His enthusiasm for his project isn't shared by the studio he tries to get financing from, so he secures their support by setting sail in the dead of night before the studio has a chance to pull their technicians and film equipment from the boat where they were staying when the studio was actually thinking of funding Denham's film.

  A good portion of the film's early going is taken up with odd but effective humor, but things change when the ship comes upon Skull Island itself, where the characters - and in particular Ann Darrow (brilliantly played by Naomi Watts from ""The Ring"" and ""The Ring Two"") find themselves encountering the ruins of an apparantly once-thriving and possibly quite advanced civilization, the remnants of the island's human population, a plethora of live dinosaurs (including a race of predators the size of tyrannosaurs with the speed and agility of velociraptors), ferocious giant bugs, and of course the most jaw-dropping titan of them all, the one the island's survivors fear and worship: Kong.

  You probably know a lot more of what happens next if you saw even a sliver of the ad blitz that engulfed everything in the months before the movie's release (MUST they show So much in the previews?) but in case you're like me and try to avoid seeing too much in advance I won't get too much into specifics of the rest of the movie.  Just a few generalizations: there are epic confrontations, scenes of tremendous beauty and tenderness, mountain-sized thrills and scares, more strange humor that somehow manages to work with the huge nature of the film instead of throwing a monkeywrench into it, and a fair bit of insight into mankind's quest for wonder and awe, and the dichotomy between that quest and the way man often ends up corrupting or destroying the dreams it does attain.  And mention must be made of the outstanding effects, particularly on the King himself.  You can read Kong's emotions and state of mind brilliantly through facial expressions and body language, to an extent where it's hard to believe it's not all real.  All this in one movie, one of the biggest and boldest and best ever.",1139961600,5,3370,5.012544802867383
7602821,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I thought this was the best of the three versions.  Yes, some parts were a little hard to believe, but hey folks, I hate to break this to you but, IT'S NOT A TRUE STORY.

The 3 hour length didn't bother me at all and the film was simply, well, amazing! The special effects were great (especially the CGI look of Kong), the acting was superb (props go to Watts and Black for convincingly pulling off their performances, especially the latter who I had doubts about.) I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a classic adventure story set admist a creepy island infested with bizarre prehistoric inhabitants. FIVE STARS!!",1139875200,21,678,4.956140350877193
7602823,5,B01AHWLX2O,"In regard to many a viewer regarding the new version of King Kong as too long, I would quote Roger Ebert in saying: ""no good movie is long enough and no bad movie is short enough"".

When I saw this film in a theater I couldn't believe during one of its best scenes (Ann & Kong by the sunset) there were people who actually took the opportunity of a slower pace in the action to buy popcorn, talk on their cell phone, etc. Most everyone nowadays likes things deliver to them fast and easy, of course they are going to find King Kong too long and it may just be pointless to try explaining them otherwise.

Personally, I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in ages. For some reason the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy didn't completely click with me, the first thing I'm doing after watching King Kong is giving them all another shot.",1139875200,13,826,4.32258064516129
7602824,4,B01AHWLX2O,"Now this is interesting: is Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' worth all the hype?  In short, yes! However the film has many issues that keep it from becoming an amazing accomplishment along the lines of, say 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' or even 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy, which dominated almost a decade of Jackson's life before.

Let's start with the fun part.  The movie has some of the most spectacular and breathtaking effects ever put on the screen. (I'm not one for CGI, so it says alot if a film really wows me.)  This film jumps from action sequence to action sequence at a breakneck pace, throwing the audience into visual assualt after visual assault.  By the end of each sequence, I was out of breath.

We begin our story in New York City of the 1930s-- one of the best visions of a past New York ever filmed. It's almost surreal, the images of the Great Depression, and they stick with you well into the movie. (The film was shot in New Zealand.)  We meet the beautiful Ann Darrow, (Naomi Watts) as she performs her vaudville act in front of a trickling crowd. Box office income is low, and soon, she's out on the street. (Let me also say, that Naomi Watts gives one of her best performances here, and she's absolutely adorable as the 'Beauty' in this tale.)  Fate intervenes when she meets a young filmmaker, Carl Denham (Jack Black, unusually surpressed.) He despretely needs a leading lady in his new film he's shooting and when he sees Ann, he decides she's the girl for the role. Ann joins Denham on the ship 'Venture' with an assortment of characters who'll be introduced, and most will be ultimately forgotten. We meet Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) who is the writer of the movie they're filming. There is a love connection between Jack and Ann, but they never fall TOO in love, because the real love story is between her and Kong.

Carl Denham and company reach an island consisting of dense fog and harsh stones and foliage: Skull Island.  After an hour, the film kicks into high gear at this point.  After a terrifying navigation through jagged rocks and smashing waves, the crew of the Venture go ashore and are almost killed by hostile natives who want to give Ann to Kong as a prize. Ann is taken by the 25 foot gorrilla and is subjected to what can only be described as visceral whiplash as Kong runs through the jungle.

Skull Island is beautifully concieved: a place time has forgotten and dinosaurs thought long-extinct still roam free. Giant apes used to rule the jungle, but now Kong seems to be the last one alive. He is now the king of the jungle.  The crew of the Venture must survive stampedes and attacks from raptors, bugs - (LOTS of bugs, not for the squeamish!)-  and yes, Kong himself.  Kong, we understand, loves Ann. He'd do anything to protect her, but he doesn't care much for Ann's other human counterparts.  Jack Driscoll takes it upon himself to bring Ann back, when everyone else gives up.

Carl Denham decides to bring Kong back to New York. He becomes almost a villian -(well, he's responsible, no?)- when Kong - you guessed it - escapes and terrorizes the city.  He grabs his love, and ascends to the summit of the Empire State Building.

We know the rest.  Back to those 'issues' I told you about. The main problem is the film's length. At 3 hours and 7 minutes, you begin to wonder why they couldn't cut some stuff. A little cosmetic surgery can go a long way.  There are, like I said, characters and subplots that come and go with no payoff, such as Jimmy the Cabin boy (Jamie Bell) and his relationship with Mr. Hayes (Evan Parke). There is also a subplot that ties in with the book 'Heart of Darkness' that ends up being nothing.

The movie does however follow the 'Jaws' rule: it doesn't show a single monster for a little over an hour. It works better this way, so when we first see Kong, it's so powerful and terrifying. There are amazing scenes, quiet scenes between Ann and Kong, that you really start to see Kong as a character.  Andy Serkis, who played Gollum in the Lord of the Rings, is again using the incredible technology 'motion capture' to provide animators with the 'performance' of the Kong character. It's amazing, and the Academy needs to nominate Serkis for his work (although they never will, chuckle.)

All in all, I expect everyone to know the story.  But that doesn't diminish the journey that Peter Jackson and the awesome WETA Workshop has  created.  Next time, I think Peter Jackson should slow it down for awhile.",1139788800,10,4492,4.554726368159204

I did not care for the cast in this remake, but I guess it was difficult to get major actors to film in New Zealand.

I did not like the face of this King Kong on the movie screen because it reminded me of a former boss I used to work for. The ape face is not so bad on television.

I liked the huge worms known as Carnictis, the vile meat-weasel creatures.

7602832,5,B01AHWLX2O,"The original KING KONG is the movie that made Peter Jackson want to become a filmmaker. His whole life he's been wanting to make his own version of KONG. Ironically it was the box office pounding of THE FRIGHTENERS that allowed Jackson to make KING KONG: he was supposed to have made KING KONG after THE FRIGHTENERS, but since it did so bad, the studio said no. So, instead, Jackson did the incredible and made THE LORD OF THE RINGS instead, guaranteeing him that he would be able to make any movie he would ever want. Thus, Jackson's version of KING KONG was finally made.

The plot goes something like this. Slimy filmmaker and showman Carl Denham gets into some trouble. To escape it and to make the movie of his dreams (catch Jackson's own self-mockery here) he hires a ship to take him to a mysterious island that only he has a map to: Skull Island. Sailors have long told stories about this mysterious island, but common folk have disregarded such talk as that of a drunk or mad man. But, Denham believes and sure enough, his belief leads his ship to Skull Island. There they find a somewhat cannibalistic group of islanders who kidnap the only female on the ship, Ann Darrow, and offer her up to their god, the gigantic gorilla King Kong. Kong takes their offering, but instead of destroying it, becomes fascinated by Darrow. In fact, Darrow's beauty enchants the great ape.

But Kong isn't the only one who has fallen for Darrow's charms. Jack Driscoll is a semi-famous author who fell in love with Darrow during their trip at sea. Risking everything, Driscoll ventures deep into the jungle to rescue Ann and bring her back home. But Kong won't be separated from his person of affection and chases Driscoll. However, a trap has been set and Kong becomes trapped.

He's then brought to New York and put on display. But Kong isn't a beast that can be tamed easily. He escapes his chained existence and finds the girl of his dreams. Unaccustomed to the urban jungle, Kong climbs to the one place he feels most at home--on top of the city's highest building. There he enjoys a few moments of peace with Darrow, before he faces off with a squadron of airplanes.

KING KONG is a very impressive movie. Jackson does an extraordinary job of re-creating 1930s New York and to remaining faithful to the original spirit of the first KING KONG. However, at the same time he does so much more. Jackson's version of KING KONG does everything from turn a ""B"" movie into an ""A"" film to illustrate the class system that is developing in America, to satirize the extreme materialism and consumerism of our modern culture, to re-establish the classic everyman (Jack Driscoll as played by Adrian Brody) as a potential hero. The movie works on so many levels and has so much to say. At the same time, it is just a great movie.

The film is a bit too long and the whole insect thing could have been cut (Even though it might be crucial to the Dante-esque journey Jackson was trying to display). Nevertheless, KING KONG is everything movies were meant to be. I wouldn't doubt that if 30 years from now another brilliant director comes along and says, ""When I saw Peter Jackson's KING KONG, I knew I wanted to make movies.""",1137024000,,3207,4.570434782608696
7602833,5,B01AHWLX2O,"The early reviews were some of the best ever for a ""popcorn"" film, and King Kong lives up to that acclaim. For pure action, excitement and cinema awe, there is no equal. Audiences are glued to their seats during the chase and fight scenes, and many people are moved to tears with the tender moments between Kong and Ann (Naomi Watts). But people are staying away, and those who attend do not describe it as a rewarding experience. Why? Because the film is too massive, too exciting. In a word, it is ""overwhelming"".

The story is well known: a group of filmmakers (lead by Jack Black as the crew's director) travel to the remote Skull Island, a hidden world that does not appear on maps and can only be found by wayward ships lost in the fog. The island is one forgotten by time. Dinosaurs inhabit the island, but the king beast is Kong, a massive ape-like figure who uproots trees and de-jaws T-Rexs during his daily activities.

Of course, the ship's beautiful blonde passenger becomes the object of Kong's desire and they develop a relationship that drives the film's action. Unlike previous incarnations of this story, Peter Jackson's version of King Kong allows the Ape and the girl to actually bond. In the PC world, he doesn't like her ""only"" because she is beautiful and blonde; he likes her because they share some happy moments together, making the final all the more tragic.

The photography is beautiful, from the haunting jungles of Skull Island to the flapper-era street scenes of New York. Of course, the film's iconic moment takes place stop the Empire State Building, a scene brought to life under a stunning Monet-like sky. The most awesome visual feature is Kong himself. So real and so lifelike that viewers quickly forget they are watching a fantasy story.

There is nothing bad to say about the film. The performances fit the story perfectly, with Jack Black irresistible as the gung-ho showman. The effects, sets, costumes, etc all show how great movies can look when their monumental budgets are used responsibly. But again, people only like this film; they don't love it. Why?

It is just too much. The film could really use a thriftier editing. By removing an hour, the experience of viewing the film would leave people excited about the story without being exhausted from the viewing. And removing an hour would not damage the story. The most obvious subplots to cut involve the other passengers on the ship, especially their journey to rescue Ann on Skull Island. While they search for her, the film becomes unwisely similar to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films. The group of ragtag would-be rescuers battles all kinds of adversities (giant bugs, dinosaurs, dangerous cliffs, etc) to get to Ann and her captor. This action has little to do with the main story (Ann and Kong's relationship) and could be removed without damaging the story.

It is not a perfect film, and clearly improvements can be made. But there is still a lot to like, especially for young viewers (or the kid in all of us). In its current form, King Kong is to teenage boys what Titanic was to teenage girls; the kind of film that will find its way into the dreams of its viewers for many years.",1135900800,,3199,4.713774597495528

If anyone thought that director Peter Jackson would
rest on the laurels of his grand success in adapting
Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS into three of the finest
movies ever made, this film will make them stop and
wonder anew. Jackson's long-awaited upgrade of KING
KONG is a superb motion picture, balancing wit and
tragedy, satire and sentiment, delivered with
rippling power and a passionate depth which will
not be ignored.
Bypassing the camped-up travesty from Lorenzo Semple
Jr. and Dino DeLaurentiis which stunk up the late
1970s, the Oscar winning scriptwriting team of Jackson,
Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens grow their story from
the original 1930s RKO classic; paying persistent
homage and respect, while filling out the story
even further. Where the original KONG was a product
of the Depression era, Jackson's KONG provides a
sharp perspective of those turbulent times, and
what such sheer desperation could drive one to
do.

Those who complain about the film's 3 hour plus
length, particularly those who bemoan the film's
first hour need to watch the film, not their
stopwatches. Jackson's sense of pacing, so crucial
to deliver the lengthy RING cycle, serves him
well once more. KONG's pacing is brisk and fluid,
at times cutting as a pitchman's jive, at other
times as gentle as a precious moment quietly
shared. In a word, it smokes.
Further, the first hour is the all-crucial intro
of characters and motivations, which is a particular
point where Jackson, cast, and crew nurture the
original tale of thrill-seeking showmanship into
a saga of clueless adventurers running headlong
into their own worst nightmares.

Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens bring this particular
point home with their broader look into the key
individuals of the steamship's crew. Instead of
one-spot bodies to be dumped over the cliff, we
are given a diverse array of characters which the
audience has a deeper stake in, whatever happens.
Even when the tale dangles the poignant thread
of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart Of Darkness"" as a
gaze into the myriad motivations at hand, we
have at least one spot which revels in an equally
unholy obsession borne straight from Herman
Melville's ""Moby Dick"".... or Clint Eastwood's
""White Hunter, Black Heart.""
While Thomas Kretschmann's Captain Engelhorn
paints a tougher, more wary seafarer than the crusty
depiction in the original film, the one to watch
most vividly is First Mate Hayes, a wise and
world-weathered sailor beautifully delivered
by Evan Parke. Of all on the ship, it is Parke's
character who knows exactly what's in store
for most of them, and warns young Jimmy
(a Jack London-like wayfarer brought home by
the fine talent of Jamie Bell) that what's coming
is no adventure full of derring-do, fortune and
glory to be had by all. Time and tragic trespass
prove the fatal accuracy of Hayes' words.

Speaking of that very trespass, Jackson's wry depiction
of endangered indigenous people reacting to outside
intrusion vs. the pitiful minstrelsy of grass-skirted
""natives"" selling doo-dah stereotypes on ""The Great
White Way"" is an ingenious set of scenes in themselves.
Between this and the weather-beaten compassion of Parke's
performance, Jackson, cast and crew directly address
the one great flaw in the original KING KONG, and
masterfully turns it around.

However one may have expected the LORD OF THE RINGS
composer Howard Shore to provide the music here, the
ever-conceptual James Newton Howard delivers a
masterwork of a score. Able to turn motifs on a dime,
and keep the balance of the greater drama(s) at hand
at all times, this KING KONG score is one of the
all-time classics.
Already acclaimed for his epic scores for the penetrating
films of M. Night Shyamalan, and other standouts (such as
his rippling 2003 score for P. J. Hogan's definitive take
on PETER PAN), Howard is justly recognized as one of the
most multitalented of all film scorists. His occasional
quote of a Max Steiner passage from the original KONG's
legendary score is a dutiful riot! All in all, Howard
delivers quite an inspirational feat of composition,
all around.

Alan Lee's design work, once more, is sheer magic. At
points, some of the Skull Island overviews touch upon
Frank Frazetta's legendary vistas, capped with Lee's
own touch of the substantially fantastic.
No faerie lands here, the ethereal eye of the highly-
acclaimed illustrator captures the dangerous allure of
the prehistoric jungle, rife with dinosaurs and assorted
crawling ghastlies which recall Jackson's earlier work
in the Horror field. With each peril, however, Lee,
Jackson and the remarkable team at WETA imparts the
presence of an unknown world; an unknown which is
needlessly disturbed in the name of Western financial
pursuit.
Just as aptly, the traps and hypocrisies of the Western
jungle are depicted with stunning detail. Hearing Al
Jolson sing about good times and lots of money, while
the film's opening unveils scene after scene of crippling
want, is as sharp a reflection of the tale's timeless
duality as one can get; a particularly special summation
of the times that this tale comes from.

In this, Kyle Chandler, Adrien Brody and Jack Black
unveil a brilliant comment of the differing faces of show
biz, then and now. Brody plays a creative auteur entrapped
amidst corporate confinement and exploitation, while
Black captures the chummy-sounding personification of
okeydoke on the make, and Chandler portrays a Grade-B
leading-man hopelessly full of himself.
For all the bluster of Black's Carl Denham, or the
preening of Chandler's Bruce Baxter (a comment on the
original KONG's Bruce Cabot?), it is the quiet wisdom
of Brody's Jack Driscoll which rises to the occasion,
meeting each new danger with great courage. Needing to
come to grips with his own words, Driscoll will dare to
cross lethal terrain, and stand at the top of the
world to secure the well-being of one special woman.

Let's talk about that woman. Naomi Watts is just
plain wonderful. To Ann Darrow, she brings the air
of naivete, gusto, wit and wide-eyed innocence which
marked Fay Wray's original portrayal of the role.
With this, Watts adds an astonishing depth in
projecting the despair of virtue besieged by the
despairing times of The ""Great"" Depression. Too,
with her uncanny ability to gain Kong's respect,
Watts certainly brings new meaning to the term
""Broadway trouper""! Small wonder that Ms. Wray,
just before she passed on in 2004, gave Ms. Watts her
personal blessing. A signature performance.

Which brings us to the standout work of Andy Serkis.
If you think his body language was superb portraying
Gollum in THE LORD OF THE RINGS, wait until you see
his bravura performance delivering the unspoken
drives of the Great Ape. WETA's digital imagery does
the original's SFX wizard, Willis O'Brien, great honor
with their wondrous genius, but it is Serkis' gifted
physicality which brings the majesty and tragedy
of KING KONG so achingly home.
In turn, it is between Serkis' Chaplin-worthy pantomime,
and Watts' grasp upon the loneliness lurking beneath the
terror, that the saga's crucial bond takes firm hold here.
What ensues with Kong and Ann is not a lust misplaced by
menace, but the camaraderie of two lost souls; each facing
the abyss, shorn of illusions for a brighter future. What
comes from that bond is what makes this KING KONG so very,
very special.

Now we wait for Jackson and friends to deliver THE HOBBIT!
Meanwhile, an image I will carry in my mind and soul, for
years to come, is that view from the Empire State Building;
looking into the vast, unknown horizon, for one loving
moment, without grief or fear...",1134950400,,7679,5.048895899053628
7602835,5,B01AHWLX2O,"REVIEW: When Peter Jackson brought his idea of King Kong to the movie studios back in 1996 he was quickly denied it. So, in the mean time he did three small films, you may have heard of them, they were about some ring or something like that. Universal came back to Jackson and said that if he still wanted to do it that he could. The result is one of the most awe inspiring films of all time. It's seriously hard to describe the scope of a film like this version of King Kong. We all know the story, I mean the script is 72 years old. Carl Denham, an eccentric filmmaker, is about to be finished because his producers are fed up with his recent flops. He decides that he's going to make a grand epic by exploring the uncharted and mythical Skull Island. He lures Vaudville actress, Ann Darrow who is reduced to stealing food because she can't find work. Jackson creates the perfect atmosphere of an America during the depression and we get this sense of desperation on both Denham's and Ann's part. On the boat Ann meets Jack Driscoll, her favorite playwright who is writing Denham's screenplay. They find Skull Island unexpectedly in the fog and in an incredible scene the ship tries to maneuver from the jagged rocks of the island wall. Once on shore the characters encounter the natives who kidnap Ann and give her as human sacrifice to Kong, who lives on the other side of a massive wall.

Most of the film takes place on the island as the entire group tries to rescue Ann. The island has an atmosphere that is just undescribable. It's absolutely wonderous, and the scale is just immense. The brontosaurus stampede through the canyon is incredible. The visual effects are amazing in the film, and Jackson seamlessly blends visuals with sets to make it work. Later on Kong protects Ann as she tries to escape three Tyrannosauruses. The sequence is breathtaking, and you will watch with your jaw dropped as these giant beasts fight to the death. Another sequence is the spider pit scene, which was not in the original but is reportedly a lost scene. It never made it into the final cut of the 1933 version, but it is here in full glory. The most vile insects imaginable blown up to a huge scale will make you cringe into your seat. Everything is done to the extreme, but not to a point where the audience says ""oh that's impossible, that would never happen"", well maybe it's impossible but it's fantasy, so lighten up. Nothing is too extreme to a point of implausibility. The greatest thing about this version is the emotion, the connection between Kong and Ann that was hard to absorb from the original. We see a connection of two souls, a lonely beast who is the last of his kind, and a women who has been thrown out on the street. It's a love for one another's presence and Jackson handled that with expertise.

The film has a shift in tone once we leave Skull Island, and Kong is captured and brought back to New York. We go from this incredible land of mystery to the city where Kong is put on display. Carl Denham has saved himself and thinks he is back on the top, which is all he cares about. Once Kong escapes and rampages through New York City looking for Ann we start an emotional ride all the way to the end. The moment Ann and Kong ascend the Empire State Building you start to anticipate the inevitable end. You watch as Kong basically climbs to his doom just to spend one last sunrise alone with Ann. After a poignant scene at the top there is the shot of the biplanes coming in from behind the building and it sends unnerving chills down your spine. The film's climax is stunning, one of the grandest most iconic scenes of cinematic history recreated through the mind of a master. James Newton Howard's score adds an emotional boost to Peter Jackson's poignant and epic vision. The movie is more than a visual effects romp, it is a truly beautiful story expressed in such a way that it will leave a grand mark on you as a movie goer. This new version has 13 minutes of restored footage, mostly stuff that is a homage to the original like the underwater escape off of the rafts.

Jack Black plays the overly eccentric Carl Denham with perfection. His reaction, as he stands in the auditorium after Kong escapes into the city, sends a message that this character has basically brought upon is own demise. Naomi Watts plays her role mostly through screaming and through facial expressions, and she does a fantastic job interacting with a character who was digitally added in later. Andy Serkis did the motion capture for Kong, just as he did the acting for Gollum. His facial expressions and body movements give Kong a human presence, and it helps with the emotional connection of the two characters. Jackson even gave Serkis a side role in the film as Lumpy the cook, which I thought was great too. Adrien Brody plays Jack, who I think never comes to realize the connection Ann has with Kong and he feels distant from the audience as a character.

VIDEO: King Kong looks absolutely stunning. This new version is pretty much the same transfer as the previous release. King Kong is a film with some sort of special effect in nearly every shot, so this transfer needs to look great. Color tones are right on the money, black levels are handled well, and the picture is overall incredibly sharp.

AUDIO: The sound is again Dolby Digital 5.1, and some are asking ""where is the DTS?"". While this film would have been spectacular with DTS the Dolby Digital is only a hair behind. Simply, the sound is explosive and dynamic. Ambient noise is effectively spread across all channels to envelope you. The canyon stampede is probably the best sounding scene in the film. Don't dwell on the fact that there is no DTS, the Dolby track is very impressive.

SPECIAL FEATURES: The special features are spread across all three discs. The first thing you'll find is the great commentary by Peter Jackson, which is incredibly informative and on par with the Lord Of The Rings commentaries. The next thing on the set are the deleted scenes, and there are a whole lot of deleted scenes. The visuals are unfinished, but it's interested to see what was left out of the already 3.5 hour extended edition. Next on disc 1 is the blooper reel, and this is probably one the best blooper reels I've seen on a DVD. It's pretty long and incredibly funny, and it just shows that Jack Black is funny no matter where he is. On disc 1 there is also a hidden featurette that is extremely funny, it's not hard to find at all. Moving on to disc 2 we have the incredible making of documentary. You can watch the whole thing together, or in the separate segments. There is an introduction by Peter Jackson and he explains that nothing here is repeated from the Production Diaries or the previous DVD. There is some really interesting stuff here, and all film students or film buffs need to watch it. The entire filmmaking process is shown in great detail from pre-production to post. There is also a featurette on recreating Skull Island and how the filmmakers wanted it to make it look like the same Skull Island from the original version. There are also a bunch of animated pre-visuals (basically takes the place of storyboards), and a video gallery which shows the concept drawings in montage form. Finally, you can load the third disc into your DVD drive and view the original 1996 script that Jackson cooked up just have it shot down by Universal, then you can compare it with the final version for the 2005 version. An amazing supplement of features is topped off with three trailers.

BOTTOM LINE: ""It wasn't the airplanes, it was Beauty killed the beast."" When our generation watches the original King Kong we see a clay gorilla walking on miniature sets. When Peter Jackson watches the original King Kong he sees everything that we see in his film today. Every filmmaker has their one source of inspiration, and King Kong was his. I'm glad he shared it with us. We go to the theater for films like this and even though it is the second remake of this story, Peter Jackson has brought this film a new life and made it his film. It is truly a wonderful, exciting, heartfelt, and touching homage made for modern times.",1134864000,4,8199,4.547054840893703
7602836,4,B01AHWLX2O,"Peter Jackson's passionate remake of ""King Kong,"" is deeply mesmorising and profoundly beautiful, capturing and signifying many of the themes that the original failed to execute to the fullest. There were two things that I was sure about when going into this film; firstly that Peter Jackson, being a devoted fan of the original would honour it through his brilliant film-making abilities;, and secondly, that it would NOT be his finest achievement.

A phenomenon like ""Lord of the Rings,"" Jackson's critically- acclaimed, and multi-Oscar-honoured masterpiece, only comes round once in a blue moon, so I knew before watching it that ""King Kong,"" would not surpass such perfection. I think this is where ""King Kong,"" perhaps hasn't been given the full credit it deserves. It will forever lie in the shadow, and therefore always be compared to ""Lord of the Rings.""

But Jackson's remake of ""King Kong,"" IS successful in one monumental way, in that it finally puts the term ""movie remake,"" in an honourable perspective. The flaw with director's trying to literally REMAKE an old classic, is that the new, technilogically-advanced version will try and be BETTER than the original. To me however, the remake of a film as iconic as ""King Kong,"" should be done so the next generation has the opportunity to appreciate why the original was so adored in the first place.

And this is where Jackson REALLY succeeds. With care, this film is visually, musically, and emotionally charged, allowing audiences to not only appreciate it as one film, but appreicate the original's profound beauty. I liked Naomi Watts' portrayal of Anne Darrow. She has the ability to transport messages and feelings through her expressive eyes. The idea of emotion through eyes is one the main aspects of the film, as King Kong himself is projected through his incredible expressions (accentuated by the genius that is Andy Serkis of ""LOTR's"" Gollum fame). I loved the chemistry between Anne and Jack (Adrien Brody), whose relationship is romantic and tranquil. Their scene on top of the Empire State building was a part I found particularly lovely.

The idea that Kong falls in love with Anne is one of the themes that this version signifies clearer than the original. In the original, the theme is implied but not, in my opinion, properly executed. Peter Jackson takes special care to build up their bond, making their heartbreaking final minutes on top of the Empire State all the more tragic. In turn, it also emphasises the film's infamous central idea; ""It wasn't the airplanes, it was Beauty killed the Beast."" Essentially, Kong loved Anne so much, that he sacraficed himself. In my view, this film couldn't have done a finer job in honouring this theme.

The other successes of this film is its technical and musical attributes. The special effects are sublime, and truly state-of-the-art. They say the only way to bring New York to the screen is to film New York itself. But Jackson's virtual New York City had a certain athereal quality to it. The creation of Kong himself is revolutionary and visual effects Oscar the film garnered was more than deserved. May I also add that this film won 3 out of 3 Oscars, so those who say this film was ""snubbed,"" aren't being completely honest.

James Newton Howard's score is captivating and haunting. I bought the soundtrack and it really is one of my favourites. The love theme for Anne and Kong is tranquil, and the music expressing Kong's famous fall to his death is heart-wrenching.

Now to the one major flaw that prevents me from giving this film the 5 stars it REALLY SHOULD have; the lack of editing and therefore its length. Now, I am all for long movies. In fact judging by past films, the longer the film the better. ""Titanic,"" ""Gone With the Wind,"" and yes, ""Lord of the Rings"" are all three hour plus movies with Best Picture Oscars under there belt. But where ""Lord of the Rings"" used every last minute to tell the enormous story that is the Tolkein trilogy, ""King Kong,"" is weighed down by a blatant abuse of ideas and creativity where the concept of ""less is more"" was not appreciated. The section dedicated to the voyage to Skull Island was far too long and drawn out. Likewise, the endless sequences once we finally get to the island, however exciting and brilliantly made, are just too overwhelming. At LEAST forty-five minutes could have been easily shaved. For two thirds, we are given too much on our plate that by the final and most important third, we are too warn out to really care. It's just such a shame, because the final forty-five minutes are so iconic, and so beautiful.

Nevertheless, I DID love Peter Jackson's ""King Kong,"" because, with the exception of its lack of editing, it is immaculately made, right down to the very last battle scar on Kong's giant body. This is the best remake around, providing a vivid reconstruction of the original masterpiece. No, it is not ""Lord of the Rings,"" but with a fine cast, stunning special effects, beautiful music and emotion that with grind at the heartstrings, Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" is one hell of film.",1134777600,,5105,4.8463302752293576
7602837,5,B01AHWLX2O,"I am a fan of the original King Kong movie as well as Peter Jackson's theatrical telling of The Lord of the Rings story, I saw this movie opening week and then bought the DVD on the first day available. I felt like I got more than an action movie. On the surface this movie is just action, but it is also a period piece and a love story. On a more intellectual level it delves into man's obsessive compulsive disorder with destruction.

The Great Depression in New York is vividly depicted in the opening sequence. This section of the movie shows the desperation that many people had during those difficult times, which draws you into the character of Anne Darrow. She is a struggling actress looking for a big break, and Carl Denham takes advantage of her by promising a wonderful new career in his movie. Denham himself is desperate, because the funding for his masterpiece movie is in jeopardy. He urgently grabs everyone and everything he can to get his movie making passion on a ship bound for a mysterious place where he thinks his dreams will come true.

On the ship bound for disaster, Anne Darrow meets her counterpart, Jack Driscoll. She respects his work yet thinks he is just a conceited playwright, but she softens to his romantically interested advances. They appear to have that spark of puppy love that we all have at one time experienced.

On Skull Island, we hop on a roller coaster of action starting with savage natives to prehistoric creatures, gigantic insects to the great ape himself. This version of Kong is very real despite his gargantuan size. The mannerisms of a gorilla usually seen in a zoo are perfectly interpreted here by Andy Serkis who played Gollum in The Lord of the Rings. It is easy to fall in love with Kong just as Anne Darrow does, and it becomes hard to hold your emotions back when Kong is captured, brought to the big city for man's entertainment, and eventually destroyed.

Carl Denham sets out to make a movie on an uncharted island, but his film and camera are smashed on the rocks of Skull Island along with his dreams. As if taking out his revenge, he feverishly brings down the beast with hopes of showing Kong off as a prize for a price. It is said in the movie that Denham destroys everything he loves, and it comes across as a metaphor for man's natural destructive behavior seen everywhere in this world as we know it. This even more evident when a scene shows one of the ship's crew who is reading a copy of ""Heart of Darkness,"" which not only suggests but foreshadows the natural result when men (Denham) are allowed to operate unchecked: power inevitably corrupts. Denham destroys everything he loves just as they said.

I very much enjoyed this movie, and I have been watching my DVD copy again and again. I was impressed with the retelling of this tale with new twists and added character development.
