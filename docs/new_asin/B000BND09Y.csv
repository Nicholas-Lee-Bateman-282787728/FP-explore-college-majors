8089251,3,B000BND09Y,"This is a mixed bag review. If I could I would give it 3 1/2 stars because I don't ""like it"", but I like it better than ""okay"".

After watching the PBS's ""Frontier House"", ""Colonial House"", and ""1900 House"", it was refreshing to see people tackle the demands of day-to-day life in a bygone era without drama - but then again, Ruth Goodman and her companions are historians (so they had a better idea what they were getting themselves into) and were trained and/or aided by experts (so they were much better equipped to deal with the hardships that come with living off the land than the reality TV amateurs in the aforementioned projects). No matter how much work they have to do and how hard it is, they remain steadfastly upbeat. Quite often it is more tell than show. ... And I have to confess that by the end of the series Ms. Goodman's relentless cheerfulness sometimes got on my nerves.

Overall, I agree with many of the positive reviews for ""Green Valley"". It is an interesting and educational series. However, as a woman I would have liked some information about female topics such as menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, baby care, and child rearing. I think farm life would have been much more demanding during pregnancy, or with babies and/or small children around. Another set of tasks that typically falls to women is caring for sick, injured, old and dying members of the household. If any comments were made regarding the challenges associated with those responsibilities, I missed them.

Throughout the series the women's clothes always looked amazingly clean and their hands seemed to show no signs of hard work. No redness, sores, cuts, burns, blisters  and just look at Ruth Goodman's fingernails! Sometimes I wondered if they actually lived on the farm for the entire year or if they just showed up a couple of days each month for demonstrations and to be filmed.

To sum it up: I watched five adults on a small farm getting things done in beautiful weather, without electricity, running water and indoor plumbing. No drama. No emergencies. No fuss. Just what I needed after a long day at the office!",1500508800,2,2121,4.768392370572207
8089252,5,B000BND09Y,"This is my favorite ""Farm"" series, and I love them all. This series is the most 'primitive' in that the skills demonstrated rely on just the farmers and a few animals, as opposed to later series, where they get period appropriate farm equipment. It's fascinating to see how much they accomplish without machinery, carpenters, or anything else aside from the materials found on the land. I also find this series the most relaxing, and I often watch an episode when life starts to feel a bit overwhelming.

 You will need a DVD player that can play region 2. I bought a region free DVD player (there are several nice ones here on Amazon) because I watch a lot of DVDs from the UK and Japan, these often also play music CDs and have USB drives for downloaded videos from online or your phone. Your PC will also play this; however, some computers ask you to pick a region after a couple of viewings. You can get around this with a program called DVD Region Free, which makes your disk drive an all region player.",1442534400,3,1008,4.4728260869565215

8089255,5,B000BND09Y,"The first of the popular series both chronologically and in production, but rarely referenced by the participants later so possibly under a different film company.  Worth purchasing a multi-region of region-free DVD player for this alone.",1428192000,,238,5.611111111111111

8089258,5,B000BND09Y,"This is brilliant!  Absolutely amazing!  Common life in much earlier times has to be the most interesting topic for a documentary.  I can't praise this enough.  How very, very well done!  This is the BBC at its best.",1408665600,4,216,4.578947368421052
8089259,5,B000BND09Y,"For starters don't let the Region 2 format scare you away!  Any current Computer with a built in Dvd player can play them.  Or you could buy a multi-region player off of Amazon.  As the other reviewer has stated learn about the history of people living 400 years ago.  I purchased this set and(Edwardian farm, which is formated for American DVD players) and plan on buying Victorian Farm and any others for good wholesome entertainment.",1382832000,14,436,4.773333333333333
8089260,5,B000BND09Y,"First - let me tell you that this DVD is in the English format, but the good news is that is can be played on newer laptop computers. YEAH!
I HIGHLY recommend this series to anyone interested in 17th c living. Stuart Peachy is a world expert on the subject of farming, cooking, sewing/clothing, animal husbandry, and all things related to life, food storage/preparation, survival, and entertainment in 17th century England. This translates well to English Colonial sites in the US (Jamestown, Henricus, St Marie's City, Plimoth, etc.)
Check out a series of books he has written on various subjects, including a book that will soon be released.",1306713600,16,643,4.962962962962963
