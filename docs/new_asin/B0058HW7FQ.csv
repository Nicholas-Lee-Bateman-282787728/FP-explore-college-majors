8461570,3,B0058HW7FQ,"The sequences on this DVD are great for preparing you for advances poses and should be watched by people wanting to deepen their practice -- HOWEVER, they are available for free at Yoga Journal's website. Search under the Master Class section for: Visvamitrasana; Parivrttaikapada Sirsasana; Eka Pada Rajakapotasana IV; Akarna Dhanurasana; and Urdhva Dhanurasana. You will be able to find both a detailed article on each pose & preperation as well as the video demonstration. Worth watching!",1393200000,,491,5.3896103896103895
8461571,3,B0058HW7FQ,"I  wanted this dvd to be more explanatory on how to advance in postures in general, and it didn't really seem to do that for me. It was really just a couple of series that biuld up to two or three advanced postures. It would help with these as far as understanding preliminary stretching though. It was really just ok.",1341446400,,318,4.3
8461572,3,B0058HW7FQ,"I was disappointed in this video, as there are only 5 ""Advanced Postures"", and some of the suggested moves to get into them are not as safe and effective as I beleive they could potentially be.  Only two of the 5 poses eluded to on this video were poses I was previously interested in evolving in my own Yoga practice.  I guess I was hoping for more, or expecting something different.  As a bonus, this video will not be dated any time soon.  The set, filming techniques, and clothing are classic.",1319414400,,497,4.428571428571429
8461573,5,B0058HW7FQ,"This DVD is not really meant for beginners, but it's perfect for us more advanced yogis. I've always been very dedicated to perfecting my form and balance, but after years I still find trouble with certain poses (Wheel Pose, for example). Natasha Rizopoulos is truly a master, and I found myself really connecting with the pose for the first time after using her sequence.

This DVD motivated me to focus on every movement and breath, and I definitely broke ground on some of the poses that are the hardest for me. Overall there is a great balance in the types of poses, and all of the teachers featured here are amazing! If you really want to challenge yourself on the most advanced poses, and want to spice up your routine, I suggest giving this DVD a go!",1314835200,3,757,4.525547445255475
8461574,3,B0058HW7FQ,"This DVD contain 5 decent practices to help you advance your poses, these are all practices that are (or were) on their website. These are not full practices and you are advised to do sun salutations and standing poses before by your own and in some practices to finish with finishing poses and relaxation by your own. I would appreciate more accurate and detailed info about this product like what advanced poses are on this DVD, if you think there is a practice of dropping back to wheel pose from standing like in the cover then you are wrong (again). Rodney Yee & Jason Crandell are among the teachers who designed the practices. The advanced poses are : Visvamitasana , Wheel pose, headstand with twist, king pigeon variation (with full splits) and archer pose. To get to some of these poses you should practice for a long time (and preferably with a teacher) though the tips on this DVD are helpful.",1311638400,19,905,4.627329192546584
