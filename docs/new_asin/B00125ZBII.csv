8244133,3,B00125ZBII,"One of my favorite B-movies about vampires, however the streaming version found here is awful, it looks like they recorded directly from late night TV. It is full of scratches, I don't think the Elvira version had as many scratches, though it has been a while since I have seen that. You would think that with current technology you could remove most if not all of those scratches. The movie itself is a ridiculous story with a ridiculous end. Dubbed in English, though I don't imagine the dialogue in Italian was much better.",1474934400,,526,4.666666666666667
8244134,5,B00125ZBII,"First off, there is no listing for the blu-ray release on Amazon, so it is listed under the VHS whenever people sell it here. That having been said, this is not a review of the VHS. I wasn't fond of the VHS, I hated the previous DVD and I can't stand the digital versions of this film that I have seen because they were all of such low quality. This review is for the blu-ray release, specifically which you kind of have to search for to find.

This blu-ray release was a wonderful surprise to me. As a Mark Damon fan from way back, I had only ever seen this film in the unfortunately blippy, green-line laden, pop-muffled nightmare of a transfer that they had aired on Elvira's Macabre Movies, when I was a much younger and far less judgemental viewer. Having seen that transfer several times over the years, it seemed to get worse and worse with each viewing, as my standards changed. Then, seeing a friend's VHS copy and later another DVD transfer, from overseas, I started to think that maybe I had dreamed this film into something better than it had been and, perhaps, it was never really very good to begin with. However, with the blu-ray restoration, I have discovered the film I always thought or perhaps hoped this to be.

The restoration architects of this release, have taken a higher quality print of the film, repaired nearly all of the damage to that copy, restored lost footage and corrected the aspect ratio and color timing and even the soundtrack in order to produce one of the most pleasing transfers of seventies vampire-horror sleaze that I've seen. I love this and have already watched it several times. If you can find a copy, it is worth the money. You will never find a better version of this wonderful little film.",1466035200,3,1740,4.538216560509555

8244138,4,B00125ZBII,"DEVIL'S WEDDING NIGHT stars Sara Bay (LADY FRANKENSTEIN) as Countess Dracula. She lives in Castle Dracula, where the satanic fun never ends! Mark Damon plays identical twin brothers, who visit the castle in search of a ruby ring w/ mystical powers. Of course, this leads to many breasts exposed, culminating in a naked, satanic ritual of pure, blood-drenched eeevil! In other words, it's a classic!...",1309046400,,401,5.184615384615385
8244139,3,B00125ZBII,"This is a decent 1970s vampire flick inported from Europe. Mark Damon plays twin brothers who
investigate Count Dracula's castle. They meet Dracula's widow played by Sara Bay. Much nudity
and bloody murder follow. This film is a cheaper, harder version of the popular Hammer studio
films from the same period. I give the film high points for the decent storyline and the fact that Sara
Bay is such a beautiful woman. Low points are very cheesy special effects and a terrible
transfer to DVD. This film looks like a sixth generation VHS tape recording. All in all, not
bad for the $1.99 VOD rental price.",1286323200,,603,4.69811320754717
8244140,3,B00125ZBII,"This DVD-R is recorded from the WORST possible source imaginable - the print is atrocious, with washed-out colors, green scratches abundant throughout the movie, so much so that at times it appears as tho you`re watching the movie through a green bead-curtain from the same time period (1970), grainy pic, etc,etc.  It IS a lost artifact from this period, so it has some value to enthusiasts, especially Rosalba Neri fans, as she brings out the only merits of the film, tho she`s listed in the credits as Sara Bay. It`s another Italian Hammer wannabe flick whose tale revolves yet again  around the Elizabeth Bathory / Camilla Karnstein tale that Hammer utilized in 'Countess Dracula', 'Lust For A Vampire' and 'The Vampire Lovers', altho it may have actually pre-dated them, so it`s relevance may be more significant if Hammer was actually ripping them off instead of the reverse. Neri IS the reason to watch this one, as she unveils more of herself than I`ve seen in her other flicks, and there`s a few other Eurovixens who undrape themselves to keep most guys watching while their girlfriends catnap. It`s another 'come for the horror/stay for the nudity' Eurosleaze from the late 60`s/early 70`s that so many love, and whose resurgence in today`s Horror is evident everywhere. This one`s ONLY for fans of Gothic Eurotrash and Rosalba Neri, tho the ending wasn`t a waste of time... you decide if it`s for you or not based on these disclosures.",1259971200,8,1446,4.8979591836734695
