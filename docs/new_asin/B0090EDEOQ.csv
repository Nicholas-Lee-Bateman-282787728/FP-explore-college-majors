Change happens. Right? So, when UFC President, Dana White, decided that TUF #15 would be live, obviously there were questions. How will it work? How won't it work? Will it ruin my entire life as a UFC fan? I'm used to Ultimate Fighter being THIS way, and I'm used to it being THAT way! And some people just rolled with the punches. I rolled with the punches, and enjoyed this season immensely!

One thing they did was give the contestants ONE ROUND to do what they had to do, and get into that house. There was ONE split decision, as most people were motivated to put it all on the line, and either knock out or submit the opponent across the cage from them. Uriah Faber and Dominick Cruz were the coaches of this season.

Almost immediately after these guys moved into the house, one of them was struck with a tragedy that hit home, and was on his mind throughout the entire season. Michael Chiesa's Dad passed away only a couple of days into this thing, he saw Chiesa's fight on TV to get into the house, he saw the submission, and he went to sleep, and died a couple of days later. The last thing he told his son, Michael, was to get to the airport. Immediately, I was hoping Chiesa would take this entire show, and he DID, submitting Al Iaquinta in the Finale, putting him to sleep, making him the Ultimate Fighter.

Obviously, Cruz and Faber had their feud going into this thing. Faber is the ONLY person to not only beat Cruz, but finish him impressively in the WEC. Cruz would win a unanimous decision at UFC 132, and to this day, these two are STILL itching to get back in there, and see who's the best!!!

The fighters: I'm going to say that out of everybody on this show, there wasn't any of them that wasn't impressive. James Vick, the long, loopy, Golden Gloves boxer from Texas, put the entire cast on notice by knocking out the flash, showy, Daron Cruikshank, in the very first fight. Myles Jury got his opportunity after tearing his ACL on TUF #13, fighting a rather boring fight to get into the house, yet showing everybody why he belonged there in his loss to Al Iaquinta, earning FIGHT OF THE SEASON. Chris Tickle was an interesting character, full of excuses, yet pushed by Cruz, who thought he was a possible winner. Andy Ogle was full of life in the house, and driven by determination in the cage. Joe Proctor was quiet, yet ready to scrap against whomever the opponent happened to be. Justin Lawrence was skilled as a striker, and proved himself, training with the intensity of a champion. Even Chris Saunders, who was picked last, showed that just because you're somewhat unknown, doesn't make you completely counted out.

What I find interesting is that a lot of the eliminated fighters have had their chances in the UFC. You've seen that from other seasons, but none more than TUF #15. I think that this season showed a ton of guts, true determination, raw talent, and even personality that makes the UFC still special to this day. The Ultimate Fighter LIVE was a special season to me, and never a disappointment in the least.",1427587200,,3186,4.522569444444445

Lots of good fights plenty of good talented fighters little bit of drama compared to the other seasons (like house pranks I mean) but its a good season and lots of fighters from this season are in the ufc now and are doing well . And the finale was a great show many good fights there
worth the buy.",1380931200,,383,4.052631578947368
8533197,1,B0090EDEOQ,THIS SEASON WAS THE BIGGEST FLOP EVER! THE SCREECHING VOICE OF JON ANIK (FOX/UFC COMMENTATOR) TALKING OVER THE EPISODES MADE IT VERY PAINFUL TO WATCH! ME AND MY BUDS COULDN'T PASS 5 MINUTES OF EVERY EPIDOSE.....VERY PAINFUL TO WATCH! WATCH AT YOUR OWN RISK!,1361923200,2,257,4.863636363636363
8533198,5,B0090EDEOQ,"Another great season of mainly U.S fighters slugging it out in the octogon. This season grabbed me right from the start when Dana gave the hopefulls a 1 round fight to prove who belongs in the house. Alot of finishes and desperation to perform came out of the fighters and it was crazy, 1 fighter had a broken toe which was facing to the roof and still continued to grapple and kick!! Good high quality fighters right from the start, the coaches don't like each other and have previously fought twice before which keeps the competition fierce. Without giving it away the rags to riches story of 1 fighter locked me in emotionly right to the end and on the conclusion gave out a great feeling of wellbeing. The winner deseved it more than anyone, TOP FIGHTS, QUALITY FIGHTERS worth the small entry fee.",1355529600,4,801,4.569444444444445
8533199,4,B0090EDEOQ,"Loved this TUF as the tension between Faber and Cruz only continued to build throughout the taping
I became a bit of a Cruz fan as he showed a more sincere side than the California Kid
Uriah had his gaurd up the whole time while Cruz became more and more genuine.",1355097600,3,263,4.176470588235294
