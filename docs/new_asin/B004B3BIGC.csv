4312877,1,B004B3BIGC,"Not sure which planet the people are from who rated this album highly but it can't be planet earth.

This album is so bad that it is even worse than the soundtrack from ""Tom Thumb"" starring Russ Tamblyn fifty years ago.

Really, really bad.  A total waste of money.

Oh yeah, and I didn't like it.",1295654400,,297,4.25
4312878,2,B004B3BIGC,"It has been always interesting to watch Neil's performance. However, as time goes by we have been addicted to getting high. In this work Neil plays alone with his old guitar doing what he does. I should recommend it only for old funs.",1295395200,3,234,4.465116279069767
4312879,5,B004B3BIGC,"There are plenty of reviews here that break down this album track-by-track, so I'll spare you my opinion. The Blu-ray version is encoded with a linear PCM 192/24 bit stereo (only) soundtrack. The 180-gram vinyl version, with that analog warmth that vinyl junkies love so much, (might) still be the best, but this Blu-ray comes extremely close to being its equal. In some respects (dynamic range, separation, low frequency extension, etc)  it surpasses the vinyl, and fans will appreciate the film of Neil playing along in D.L.'s home studio. The video quality contrasts with the hi-rez audio; it's purposely grainy in places and mostly B&W, with a few ""trippy"" color effects...and somehow it fits the feel & sound of the music perfectly. In other words, it's enjoyable, but not reference demo material. There are no other ""special features"" of any kind, but most fans that buy this release will be doing it for the (superb) audio anyway. In my only major gripe, the disc itself, like many of Young's recent releases, slips into the thin cardboard sleeve with no protection of any kind, and although Blu-ray is far more resistant to scratching than CD, it can still happen. Once inserted, the disc is awkward to remove, and that means fingerprints as well. The packaging seems an after-thought, and if Blu-ray Audio is ever going to ""make it"" improvements need to be made...and prices MUST drop.",1293926400,15,1394,4.931914893617021
4312880,1,B004B3BIGC,"I am a big fan of Neil Young, and have appreciated his music through all the twists and turns.  Until now.  I tried - really tried - to like this CD.  But, it is just a lot of noise - it is aptly titled.",1293667200,2,203,3.5681818181818183
4312881,5,B004B3BIGC,"A great region free disk. (I am in NZ, so I needed it to be!)
 If you want to check out the music first, the entire film is on Youtube, but of course that can't compare to the audio quality mastered on the disk.
And at least I waited until the product came out, before submitting a review, unlike some others on this page.",1292716800,11,322,4.03125

Whoa, what a great Blu-ray to show off your home theatre system! Neil continues to rock with Daniel Lanois adding some sonic effects to the music. This Blu-ray version of course blows away the audio quality of the audio cd. I would have liked to see some extras, but I'll enjoy this for years to come.

Its just Neil, Solo, Electric and Rockin'!

4312883,3,B004B3BIGC,"Great album but why only a Region 1 release on Blu-Ray?  What about fans in the rest of the world? Having shelled out for a player so I could get the best out of Archives Vol 1, it now looks like someone's waving a finger and laughing.... No BD-live?

4312884,5,B004B3BIGC,"I just saw the new Neil Young film ""Journeys""(Directed by: Jonathan Demme)so I was already familiar with some of the songs on this Blu-ray. In my opinion this is some of Neil Young's best new music to come out in a while. I highly recommend the Blu-ray or DVD to get the full impact of this collection of songs. It's a little short(somewhere around 41 min.)but all music. There is no extra content like you sometimes get with Blu-rays, but I think extra content would have lessened the films impact. I can't say if the Blu-ray is better than the DVD, but I thought the quality of the picture and sound was very good on the Blu-ray. After watching the Blu-ray several times I came back and purchased the Le Noise music CD. Although the CD is the same music it probably will not have the same impact if you haven't seen the film. This is not Neil ""After the Gold Rush"", but where he is today. I feel these songs are from the heart, and if you have enjoyed the journey so far, I think you will enjoy Le Noise.",1344729600,2,1006,4.272251308900524
4312885,1,B004B3BIGC,"If you are buying this because you want higher-resolution audio, i.e., the 24-bit, 96 kHz tracks this claims to have, you will be very disappointed.  I checked, and it is anything but.  I put a customer image of an Audacity-produced FFT spectrum up so you can see for yourself.  With Neil Young expounding upon the virtues of high-resolution music, I find this more than simply a disappointment.  It is a misrepresentation.

This is one of his best albums, and I would give the CD five stars.",1322179200,8,492,4.674418604651163
4312886,5,B004B3BIGC,"Neil. ""Ol' Black."" An acoustic guitar. The occasional piano. Access to technology that wasn't around 30-40 years ago. Grammy nominated.'Nuff said...this thing rocks AND pulls at your heart on alterante tracks. I'm a huge Neil Young fan who has learned to not just buy something because he released something new (see Greendale) but to try and hear some of it first before buying it (he's had some releases that were obviously a personal indulgence as well as some things he's released just to fulfill a contract so he could move on). This one? I heard it, I bought, I love it. Crank it up as loud as you can stand it...(Go to [...] for a taste. Most will order it right away. That's what happened to me. It comes in Blu-Ray too.

4312887,5,B004B3BIGC,"First I bought the CD. Listen to it I feel that Mr. Young could add some bass lines here, some drums there to get a harder grip to the sound. Later I bought the DVD and when I saw it I change my mind. The way he played and the sound he got is just the right sound without the need of any changes. Adding to the music the ambience of playing all night long gave the exact touch to combine how the music was conceived. That is the way he is the master.",1313798400,2,450,3.797872340425532
4312888,5,B004B3BIGC,"Neil Young is such a fabulous songwriter that his talents with a guitar can get overlooked. This album should change that. Neil has done a lot of beautiful solo acoustic work in the past, but this is something entirely different. Neil's guitar work is so rich and textured that you can't hear this as simply a solo guitarist. The great thing about this video is that seeing is believing. Lanois's production turns this beautiful noise into art. I know Neil will head in an entirely different direction now, and I admire and appreciate that aspect of his career, but I'm glad he and Lanois found each other at this time and place and created this amazing soundscape.",1308096000,,665,4.6923076923076925

4312891,5,B004B3BIGC,"Every project that Daniel Lanois (DL) has ever touched met with harsh criticism from those dyed-in-wool fans who've expected a more-of-the-same release from their favorite artist - not that Neil is one who is prone to recording more-of-the-same sound or material. Still, when DL got his chance to work with Emmylou and 'Wrecking Ball' was released (coincidentally, Neil's song gave the LP it's title), it was a magical pairing that yielded her the 1995 Grammy for best for Best Contemporary Folk Recording. DL went on to wrap a new sound around Bob Dylan's songs and voice that won Mr. D THREE Grammy's including Album of the Year for 1997's 'Time Out of Mind'. All this, after hatching, with 1987's 'Joshua Tree', THE U2 sound that put Bono and company on the map for keeps - another Album of the Year Grammy produced by DL. Oh ... and let's not forget Robbie Robertson's self-titled 1987 solo debut after splitting from The Band- another wonderful interpretation by DL of a great talent - a new sound is created around an old talent. Robertson's 'Somewhere Down the Crazy River', 'Fallen Angel' and 'Showdown at Big Sky' remain among some of Robbie's best solo work.

So Neil gets in touch with DL, tells him he would like to work with him, see what happens. DL jumps at the opportunity ! It is evident from the video that Neil and DL both loved every minute of it - fercriesake, Neil moved into DL's house and lived there for the duration of the recording of the LP ! DL put together a new acoustic amp/pickup/guitar just for Neil to use for this LP ! And I'm pretty sure that 'LeNoise' will not be the last that we hear from this guitar .... it's probably hanging out in the Redwoods right now .... alongside 'Old Black' and 'Hank'.

It's a great CD ! A fresh sound .... a new sound ... with an edge ! It's Neil - it's what he does! It's Lanois - helping Neil define it and do it ! It's a collaboration ! It's 'Le Noise' !!!!!",1296345600,3,1930,4.4491525423728815
4312892,4,B004B3BIGC,"The message within the musicvideo, as per Neil Young's musical history, carries an important theme. Look for it and think of the historical overtones woven brilliantly within as it reveals national direction and, I believe, demonstrates hope from within the fractures of a tortured citizenry. This is a great work of art, worthy of acquiring for its message as much as its music and film production creativity. Neil Young's genius refuses to be boxed in and seems to span time, like a time traveler appearing within new dimensions to speak to all generations.",1296172800,,559,5.021505376344086
4312893,2,B004B3BIGC,"Reading previous commentary it looks like some folks are into their technology and don't get out much to have seen Neil and what his concerts are like live. Those wanting to hear some Good ol'fashioned Rock'N'Roll were very disappointed. I'll sit this one out. Neil is a talented man that has contributed to music in several genres. He is an advocate for people with disabilities with his Bridge Concerts so no apologies required. Maybe he had a few too many parties, is getting old like the rest of us, or his hearing is going. I still like his music. The old stuff is classic, but this will require a different ear than mine. PEACE",1295740800,5,633,4.56140350877193

8421334,5,B004B3BIGC,"Let me say this, I'm a die hard Neil YOUNG fan for decades (no pun intended). From After the Gold Rush to Le Noise and everything in-between. One of the many NY shows that i would like to share with everyone is one of the most memorable is, I remember being at a Theatre Concert Downtown 14th St, NYC in the early 70's, where Neil said twice to hush up during the show. Once he seemed to be a little upset over the audience making too much noise. ""Please be quiet,  you won't hear the acoustics."" That became a lasting joke whenever Neil came on the radio. Allyson Steal The Night Bird on 102.7FM.
The second hush came after someone  walked  on stage from backstage with a note, ""the war is over! There had to be a dozen of us there for the show. ""RIP"" guys. I really miss the ones of the gang that aren't with us anymore. ""I sing the song because I love the man. I know that some of you won't understand"" Back then life, well we all had it, never thinking about tomorrow.
Back to Neil. If you are an extremely electric NY fan, this one is like no other. When nobody is home I really crank it up. Only for the EXTREME NY FAN.

8421336,3,B004B3BIGC,"I picked up this video because I am more of a lanois fan than a young fan.  I appreciate neil young's frankness as an artist, I like his voice.  I became familiar with lanois when he worked with U2.  if you liked the Achtung Baby album from U2, the saturated unworldly sounds, then you might find this album interesting.  While neil sings about life, love and the state of the world Lanois trys to punctuate the songs with mood through distortion and tweeking of guitar signals and vocals WHILE THE SONG IS BEING PERFORMED LIVE with possible overdubs later.

interesting if you like audio/performance experiments...sometimes moving other times puzzling.",1360281600,,653,4.954128440366972
