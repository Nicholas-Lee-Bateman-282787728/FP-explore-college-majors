8655927,4,B00K5EF8YO,I liked it. Femi has that extra awkwardness that makes his character stand out from the others. All in all it wasn't the worlds greatest comedy but it made me laugh.,1507680000,,165,4.354838709677419
8655928,1,B00K5EF8YO,"Shaun (Femi Oyeniran) leaves rich guy college to go to poor guy college with his cousin and be cool. He is rather creepy in his love for shallow self centered Chrissy (Roxy Sternberg) and reluctantly uses his wealth to impress her. He ends up trashy his dad's Lotus and needs to come up with 20,000 pounds before he returns in few weeks. He holds a party at his place which only makes matters worse and resorts to running a fake charity to raise the cash, which predictably goes as well as everything else in his life.

""It's a lot"" is slang for exceedingly good or exceedingly bad. In fact they cover a whole glossary of slang terms which appear on the screen for a few seconds (not long enough to seriously read). I felt like I was reading ""Clockwork Orange"" flipping back through the glossary for slang words.

I found Shaun to be ""a lot"" and not in a good way. He was exceedingly boring. The support cast wasn't much better and the only near chuckle I had was at the policemen. The film is poorly developed. His dislike for his first school is done with a few lines. The money rift between his mom and aunt was never fully explained, apparently an inheritance thing. The other side distractions are not developed either such as Louise's loose character or the pot head who owed the thugs. And what was with the big fat white dad who attempted to be funny with mild racial comments? Almost a chuckle.

Clearly this is for an audience far younger than me.
