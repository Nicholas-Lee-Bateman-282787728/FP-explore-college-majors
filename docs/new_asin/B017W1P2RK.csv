7534400,1,B017W1P2RK,"Horrid message for young girls including 9 -10, it makes them feel insecure about their self with the ice cream scene. My suggestion save your money. The movie also had very rude characters, and a bad influence.",1469404800,6,211,4.72972972972973

7534419,1,B017W1P2RK,"I was incredibly disappointed in this movie. In fact, I didn't even let my girls finish it. Far different feel from the Lego friends episodes they have watched. Nearly every person/character in the movie from small to major  is horribly rude and catty. Even the Lego ""friends"" don't treat each other well. The movie has such an angry feel and is really superficial. Easily one of the worst movies I've seen, absolutely terrible and no kind of example of behavior I'd want my girls to see.",1458777600,7,488,4.674418604651163
7534420,1,B017W1P2RK,"I've let my four year old watch several episodes of this show, so I purchased this movie with zero hesitation.  However, this is not like past episodes from Netflix.  The girls are incredibly catty and rude to each other.  One of the main characters in this movie talk about how her 'personal trainer' won't let her have ice cream because it'll go to her hips.  Seriously, is this the message we want to send to our daughters.  I was completely grossed out.  We just returned from our first trip to Legoland. My daughter was completely mesmerized by heartlake city and the Lego friends show.  I'm terribly disappointed that Lego would put their name on this product.",1458172800,7,666,4.689655172413793
7534421,5,B017W1P2RK,"My daughter, age 4, loved this movie!",1457827200,,37,4.428571428571429
7534422,1,B017W1P2RK,"I found this movie to be inappropriate for young girls (my daughters are 5, 8 and 9).  There was too much ""mean girl"" behavior throughout the movie and there was a scene where one of the characters said ""a moment on the lips, forever on the hips"" when she ate an ice cream cone, then her agent freaked out when he found out she had ice cream and said she needed to exercise to burn off the calories.  What a terrible and negative message to give to young girls who are already bombarded with enough unhealthy messages from the real world about their bodies, food and popularity.  Not to mention my 8 and 9 year olds hated the movie while my 5 year old was neutral on it.  This movie was garbage in my opinion and I plan to return it.",1457395200,15,733,4.177304964539007
7534423,5,B017W1P2RK,My little girly girl loved it. Especially the music.,1456963200,,52,4.888888888888889

8740833,1,B017W1P2RK,this movie deserve zero stars. I am a palled by whoever wrote the script to this. I was allowing my daughter to watch this movie because it was free on FiOS.  The messages in this movie or inappropriate for girls of any age.  there was a scene where two of the girls were walking with ice cream cones and one girl mentioned to the other a moment on the lips a lifetime on the hips that is what her personal trainer told her.  if you minutes after that one of the girls stage managers told her that she needed to exercise in order to burn off calories.  I turned it off after this immediately. I cannot believe that a children's movie is marketing dieting and poor body image ideas to young girls. Disgusting movie. Do not buy or allow your children to see.,1527897600,,756,4.265734265734266
8740834,5,B017W1P2RK,"Cute movie, catch soundtrack, and positive girly show.",1526342400,,54,5.875

I have to admit though, the plot is pretty good and entertaining and the music is superb.",1513814400,,245,4.23404255319149

8740839,5,B017W1P2RK,The kid loves it. Cute story for girls but don't expect any real life lessons to be learned from this movie. She really just likes the song they sing.,1494028800,2,150,4.206896551724138

8740842,5,B017W1P2RK,Wonderful movie. I own it on local DVD here in Australia but decided to get it on Blu-ray as well. Livi is ever so beautiful. She'd be even more beautiful in Full HD.,1488240000,,166,4.0606060606060606
