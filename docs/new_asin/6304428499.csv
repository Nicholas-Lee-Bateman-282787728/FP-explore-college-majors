(Swedish with subtitles.)  She has the nickname because of her many problems, which include never having had a boyfriend and already in her 30's (or so).  By accident she falls into a romantic tryst with a hunky biker type.

There are huge laughs and major weepy scenes as well.",1189641600,5,620,4.590909090909091
