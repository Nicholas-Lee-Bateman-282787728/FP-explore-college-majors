7982574,5,B00008G3IU,"This video is culled from four episodes of  the Famous Adventures of Mr Magoo (1964).  Robin Hood. This cartoon shows that great animation, no matter how old, is still great cartoons. This adaptation is a neat way to enjoy literature and still have a good time.

Magoo, voiced by Jim Backus, plays Friar Tuck, the narrator of the piece. This is not your standard Mr Magoo cartoon  fare. However this is damn good family fare that everyone will enjoy

If you haven't seen this caroon  or haven't seen this  in a long time, It is worth watching classic animation well done

7982575,5,B00008G3IU,"Like a Christmas Carol, Mr. Magoo uses his bad eyesight to accidently do the right things. I have always been a Magoo fan. His movies and TV shows are light hearted and are fun for all ages. My grandkids enjoy him as much now as I did when I was their age and still do. It kinda sticks to the Robin Hood stories but with a Magoo twist to it as Fryer Tuck.",1384300800,,355,3.8767123287671232
