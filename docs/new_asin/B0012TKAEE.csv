8247764,5,B0012TKAEE,"At first I didn't think I'd like this series of lectures.  The first two were dedicated to atmospheric phenomena like rainbows and to viewing the night sky with sky charts.  While I can see that it might be fun for families, I didn't think it was quite expected after the weighty content of the '98 series.  By the 3rd lecture, though, I was again hooked.  While some of the material was a review of earlier lectures intended to bring the audience up to speed after the 5 year interval since the previous series, the rest was dedicated to the very real advances made over that time.  I mean, like, right up to the moment research; Professor Filippenko discussed information that he had just received the very night before from a fellow researcher regarding black holes that would greatly alter models on their existence and development.

My favorite parts of the lectures were discussions of plans for the future testing of the warping of space time by the mass of the earth with a satellite fixed in its orbit and its gyroscope fixed on a distant star.  I had heard about the project when it had been proposed at the time (about '03) but have not since heard of its results--not that they were really ever in doubt as the article I had read noted.  The professor's description of the experiment was very clear and much enhanced my understanding of what they planned to do and what they expected to find.

I also found the discussion of planet and solar formation with respect to angular momentum enlightening.  This had never occurred to me, but I am not really a math-physics person, just an  art-social sciences type with a curiosity about this subject.  The lectures on the significance of novae, supernovae, and supra-novae to particle physics also interested me.  It's not that the connection is not apparent, but this lecture made it much more readily so.  It certainly  makes the relationship between particle physics, theoretical physics and observational astronomy clearer--as did the instructor's story about the theoretical physicist trying to tell him that observations made by the astronomers had to be ""mistaken,"" because they disagreed with the current theory!

Probably the best lectures discussed the newer findings and theories on the large scale structures of the universe and their behavior and what is known--or thought to be known--about dark energy.  Much of this has implications for theoretical physics about alternate universes, the origin of possible repulsive forces, and so on.  Professor Filippenko dealt briefly with string theory, which as he noted, was the current ""darling"" of theorests atempting a grand unified theory of physics.  He does not go into it in any great detail, because as he notes also, there are almost as many variants of it as there are theorists to have them!  Currently string theory seems to be falling out of favor, as Professor Lee Smolin details in his book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Trouble-With-Physics-The-Rise-of-String-Theory-The-Fall-of-a-Science-and-What-Comes-Next/dp/061891868X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Trouble With Physics: The Rise of String Theory, The Fall of a Science, and What Comes Next</a>.  This whole area of study and theory resonates for me because it smacks so much of philosophy as the instructor himself points out to the viewer.

The visual appeal of the series has improved considerably.  Better graphics have been added in aide of clarifying some of the more complicated theories, but the professor still introduces his own ""homegrown"" demonstrations and his own obvious enthusiasm to enliven and improve the discussion.  Again, this is still not a Discovery Channel production; it is a classroom style lecture on the topics of astronomy and astrophysics.  It is very accessible to those who've seen the earlier '98 lectures and to anyone who enjoys reading on the subject.  It helps to have had some recent mathematics but is not overwhelmingly complicated--though as he freely admits, the instructor is keeping the more complex mathematics to a minimum.  This is a concept focused series not a math based one.",1284681600,,4158,5.241691842900302
