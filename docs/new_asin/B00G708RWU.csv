8621173,5,B00G708RWU,"This is a great yoga series---I'm in love!  Specifically geared for those of us who are not interested in strenuous yoga.  Loved the fact that Maya explained the health benefits.  Very simple to follow, calming, peaceful & absolutely life-changing.",1408406400,2,248,5.3076923076923075
8621174,5,B00G708RWU,"I have an entire library of yoga DVD's, but this set and Maya's instruction are the best for my body, mind and spirit.  I find that I want to do one chakra class a day minimum, and I find reaching the beginning stages of Samadhi while in meditation during the class is as easy and comes as naturally as breathing.  I recommend this series wholeheartedly for anyone who welcomes in the Aquarian Age and the Shift of the Ages.  I turn 66 this coming June and find the yoga classes enhance my physical strength and returned the youthfulness of my body, as well as the breath work bringing unity to body, mind and spirit.  Thank you Maya!",1395878400,7,634,4.3931623931623935
8621175,5,B00G708RWU,"Maya Fiennes Kundalini Yoga is such a powerful and spiritual workout for both your body and your mind. I am not in very good shape physically at the moment, but I am able to do most of the mantras and those that I can't do I feel I can work my way into it. My 18 year old daughter has also been ""taking the journey"" and also loves it, which shows that it can encourage and heal through the generations. Fully recommend this to anyone that has an open mind to venture into the unknown.",1395705600,4,484,4.105263157894737
