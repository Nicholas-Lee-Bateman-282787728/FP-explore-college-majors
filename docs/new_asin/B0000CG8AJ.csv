7999325,4,B0000CG8AJ,"This series draws to a close as the Earth faces total destruction by a collision with a gigantic alien.  Of course, the alien in question is actually another fragment of astronaut Yurii Leonov, whose last desire to return home converted his death in space into an eerie form of reincarnation.  While Earth races to turn an exploratory vessel into a guided missile powerful enough to deflect the impending tragedy, it falls to the disbanded Funeral team and Frank (who is part giant robot and part Leonov) to find the real way to end the crisis.
In the process Ryu Soma has an epiphany that shows him for the first time that his failings are his own responsibility.  He has allowed his own fears and blindness to cut off his contact with others.  In a finale that includes a vision of Harriet as a woman, Ryu finds the courage to be what he can and try a different approach to his core problems.
When all the shouting is done, the very last episode turns to Sue Harris, who has previously been one of the casts lesser lights.  Whether this is filler to bring the series to 26 episodes, or preparation for a second series, the episode provides surprising insight into the mindset Funeral's other loner.  It also underlines the core story arc of the series, that there is another way to deal with aliens and humans besides blowing their heads off.
This has been an uneven series, with a story that is a bit too haphazard and full of unexpected twists.  These last episodes clear up some of the loose threads, but insert a few of their own.  In hindsight, the story does work well as a whole, but falls short of real excellence.  There have been so many remarkable entries into the U.S. anime market this year that Argentosoma will be bast remembered as an imaginative second tier tale.
This is hardly a criticism.  Not very long ago this same series would have been a leading contender.  If you like giant robot space fiction, but are tired of the same old alien invasion scenario, then Argentosoma was made just for you.  This is a very solid four star product, and worth your viewing.",1072828800,6,2083,4.554959785522788
