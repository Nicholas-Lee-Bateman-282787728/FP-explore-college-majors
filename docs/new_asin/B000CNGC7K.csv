8099625,1,B000CNGC7K,I wanted it to be about Argentine tango and it was very basic beginner steps in regular tango. Get something else if you want to learn Argentine tango.,1388793600,,151,4.428571428571429
8099626,5,B000CNGC7K,"I own several instruction disks by these two teachers and have found all of them to be top notch when compared to what's out there.  The explanations, technique and figure breakdowns are very clean and easy to see and understand.  I first bought the tango disk while enrolled in a ballroom  dance class.

They do not talk a lot about the dance frame and hold in this production but they do mention some helpful details about styling, musicality, feet positions and posture that I missed learning in my beginning classes.",1213056000,7,520,4.7444444444444445
