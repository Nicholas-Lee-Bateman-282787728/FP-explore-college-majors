8283165,4,B001BGRWQC,"Spanish cinema has been to me almost an addiction but even addictions can lead to disappointing outcomes. I love this movie but not to give it a five star rating. The storyline is interesting but a bit unbelievable in some areas. The actors are both good and I have to say that Tristan Ulloa, in my opinion, has been one of my favorite Iberian actors. The setting, Barcelona, Catalunya, is to my liking and hence a distorted reason to liking this movie more.

Rather than try to write a very elaborate and technical review I will say that this movie may not be to the liking of many but it is a nice and decent film.",1419984000,,616,4.310344827586207
