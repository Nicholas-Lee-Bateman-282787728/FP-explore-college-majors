8332911,5,B001PB3NXE,"I found this excellent documentary illuminating about the trails of all religions in China. While there is a good amount of info on the Catholic Church, it does a good job in covering Evangelical Christians, Protestant House Churches & their persecution by Chinese authorities, Buddhists, & the co-opted ethnic Muslims. I think the other reviewer is simply prejudiced against Catholics. One of the most touching interviews was of the trails of the Chinese staff of an Evangelical Publishing Company. I was deeply moved by the courage and perseverance of the people in this film.",1316736000,3,578,5.159574468085107
8332912,1,B001PB3NXE,I have read a fair number of books on the move of Christianity in China and I  expected a fresh visual update. The information on the video is interesting from a Catholic perspective but it is very narrow in information. I have given the DVD to a friend who is more Catholic in belief as I am not able to use it for the purpose for which I purchased it.,1237766400,2,353,4.042857142857143
