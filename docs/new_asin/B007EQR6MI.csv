8515322,5,B007EQR6MI,This movie rides on the main character- the girl. She puts on such a performance while everyone else is avg to below average. When she is on the screen I'm telling you it's a different move.  She is a must watch because she is going to be huge! Keep your eye out! She turned the movie around and took it from a 2 to a do not miss 5 star attraction!,1459641600,,348,3.9014084507042255

8515324,4,B007EQR6MI,"I'm completely taken with exorcisms lately. All of the traditions, ceremony, all the ""what if its real"", it all unnerves me but I've been spending a lot of time on the subject. I liked this a lot, it showed everything that I've always wanted to see in an exorcism. Unsettling stuff here.",1374969600,,287,4.538461538461538

8515326,4,B007EQR6MI,"Boy, this movie has some haters! I don't get it, I thought it was pretty good. Not going to win any academy awards but if you're reading this I'm guessing you're not looking for some big budget Hollywood pap anyway. Give it a shot.",1362528000,,231,4.2727272727272725

8515328,1,B007EQR6MI,"Yes, that is what I said --- get used to it and when youwatch this--film---you will recongize that the non-denominational minister that assists, which is to say kneeling at the foot of the bed and babbling in tongues and rocking back and forth, like my granny on a Metamucil over-dose, was the only true high point of the film.  I really like demonic films just like I am a huge Zombie freak - but come on guys.  At least have some idea, as to what the catholic church  ritual of expulsion even says or has in it (pretty cheap - all bookstores have loads on it) and write the scenes with ---anything---other than what this was scripted for.  I could go on for hours as to why you should avoid any part of this film, won't even suggest a rental, but then I'd end up heaving up pea soup just from havng to think about it, again ---- sad thing is, I actually bought the DVD.  Made a good frisbee.  Oh Okay ---- maybe rent it on a beer night just for the OggleeBoogleeDirrkDirkaaDeeegle praying in tongues part --- truly, the best acting in this flik.",1339977600,,1047,4.316326530612245
8515329,1,B007EQR6MI,"Hard to believe, but someone is actually leaching off of a one-star movie. This is NOT The Devil Inside, a recent flopped movie and DVD release. This is something even worse, although the original earned something like a 7% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Even though enough people will be taken in by this piece of fraud to satisfy the producers, this is the stuff that lawsuits are made of. I would strongly suggest that you not contribute to the outrageously corrupt mentality that spawned this disk.",1337644800,3,498,4.8023255813953485
8515330,4,B007EQR6MI,"Deadly Indie Review: I liked this film a lot, we follow 3 amateur filmmakers on an exorcism so the film is done in a Blair with kinda fashion which i really liked a lot. It doesn't take long to get started and is a pretty freaky ride, this film at times really freaked me out. This is definitely one of the better exorcism genre films i have seen in a long time & i thought it beat a lot of the films i have seen in theaters as of late, fans of films like Blair witch or The Excorcist should definitely check this one out.
RANK 7-10",1334361600,3,532,3.9813084112149535
8515331,1,B007EQR6MI,"I bought this movie on e-bay and just finished watching it. I have been an horror movie fan my whole life and I have never felt compelled to write a movie review until after watching this piece of crap. The Unholy Exorcism: The Devil Inside, is the worst movie ever made hands down. They claim this was based on a true story? What a joke. They claimed that this was an actual footage of an exorcism and
a disturbing journey into an unspeakable darkness never before captured on tape. A blind man can see that is a bunch of bull. I would have rated this a minus 5 stars but the reviewing system won't allow it. This was the worst $15.95 I ever spent. This movie is so bad, that I had to warn people not to spend their hard earned money on this garbage. Speaking of garbage, that is where I put this movie.
Buyer beware!!!!!",1334188800,8,822,4.24203821656051
