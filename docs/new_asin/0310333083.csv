1891,5,0310333083,"We purchased this workbook as well as the dvd and ran a small group at our house.  We typically do a couple songs of worship, followed by the dvd video and then discussions from the book. I found it very helpful and challenging for everyone involved.",1354147200,3,250,4.434782608695652

7787965,5,0310333083,"I read the book & loved it so much I wanted to get the video for my Bible Study group. the video is great because it's a smaller time-commitment than reading the whole book together (we have group ADD LOL) but it still hits on all the major points and fields great discussion. I still highly recommend reading the book over doing the videos, but this is a great way to go through the material as a group, and even if you just really hate reading books you will still get a lot out of this video!",1398643200,2,495,4.11340206185567

7787968,5,0310333083,"This was a outstanding study that we just concluded. It challenged us to be more bold in our prayers and to be patient, not giving up when we feel as if God isn't listening to us. I would recommend this to  anyone who wnts to have a deeper prayer life. Thank you Mark Batterson.",1375920000,,278,4.148148148148148
7787969,5,0310333083,"A group of guys I work with have been meeting once a week for bible study.  A few weeks ago, we started The Circle Maker and it has been the best study topic we have had.  Mark Batterson does such an excellent job of explaining prayer and how to pray and what it means to pray.  Basically prayer is different for each person, but there is one common denominator, through prayer you are having a one on one conversation with God and He wants and loves to have these conversations with us each day.
Believing that God will hear our prayers and believing and having faith that if we ""Circle"" an idea, a person in our lives, a job, whatever it may be, and we ask God to intercede on our behalf through prayer, He hears us and will show us the way.
Mark explains that we may not get an answer through a bolt of lightening or within a matter of hours or days, but keeping the course and having faith that God hears our hearts through prayer.
This is an excellent, excellent bible study topic and great daily study guide for those going through the course.  I strongly encourage those that do not have access to the DVD to purchase it.  It makes all the difference in the world in really getting a good visual of what Mark is getting across in the book and daily devotional/study guide.",1369785600,4,1279,4.3125
7787970,5,0310333083,This workbook and dvd series has really challenged me.  I'm seeing prayer in an entirely new light.  Mark Batterson is a great communicator.  He uses incredible testimonies of God's faithfulness to those who have gone before us as well as today and demonstrates our need to press into prayer.  This series has stretched me to new heights.,1366329600,,338,4.87719298245614
