I was looking forward to that and Jorge and the other girl were bigger characters. and where was the ratman. have they not learned not to mess with the books you can leave some stuff out or add just don't change the whole thing just to keep the name that's what it seemed like they did awesome with the first movie why could they of not done it with this movie. oh well it was ok I don't hate it i'll watch it again. you know they say don't read the book before you see the movie and that's why.  if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do or don't see it. the acting was really good though.",1476403200,,761,4.039735099337748
