3663952,3,B001K9OXEO,"I love this show! But Episode 3 has the Guest appearence by Markie Post & the late, but great John Ritter CUT OUT! & it states in the synopsis that it includes them! I feel it ruined that episode cutting that tag out. That's all I noticed, but it makes me think what else got cut?",1256083200,4,280,4.017857142857143
3663953,5,B001K9OXEO,"Our family loved this series when it first aired, so I was thrilled to find out that the first two seasons were available on DVD. Loosely based on the real Dave Barry, the show is full of wonderful, understated humor and overstated hijinks. Harry Anderson is perfect as Dave Barry, Shadoe Stevens is an appropriatley vain Kenny, and Meshach Taylor was excellent in the role of Dr. Sheldon Baylor. Delane Matthews had great comedic chemistry with Anderson in her role as Beth Barry. In spite of the fact that the original opening song could not be used on the DVD series, the episodes are still as enjoyable as they were back in the day, and what a trip down memory lane to the early-mid 1990s. Anyone who was a fan of the series will not be disappointed in this DVD.",1252886400,5,766,4.478571428571429
3663954,5,B001K9OXEO,"HARRY ANDERSON is a wonderful and very talented actor. I love this series! I have Season 1 on DVD as well. This is a great family comedy for everyone to enjoy! I am looking forward to more of this series to be released on DVD in the hopefully near future!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1246838400,5,275,4.3076923076923075

8314482,5,B001K9OXEO,"The DVD arrived quickly and in good condition. I thought the price was decent.  If you are a fan of the show, which is based on Dave Barry's humor, then you should enjoy the DVD.  I like Dave Barry's humor and I think the show does a decent job of converting it into video form.  If you want world class acting from a television sitcom, look elsewhere.  I think the acting is about on the same par as ""Big Bang Theory"" or ""How I Met Your Mother"" : that is do say ""cheesy.""  I'm not sure if you should expect any more from a lighthearted sitcom.",1419724800,,544,4.09433962264151
8314483,5,B001K9OXEO,One of the better sit coms of the 1990's,1415318400,,40,3.5555555555555554
8314484,5,B001K9OXEO,So how could this not be great?! Like the other characters also. No meanness in the comedy. Just lots of family fun.,1378857600,,116,4.318181818181818
8314485,5,B001K9OXEO,"I still don't see why this show was canceled after such a short run...although maybe I'm not objective because I'm a long-time fan of Dave Barry's writing. But Season Two is just as much fun as Season One: Harry Anderson and DeLane Matthews are still great as Dave and Beth; Zane Carney and Andrew Ducote are more and more adorable as the two sons; J.C. Wendel's Mia just gets wackier and wackier; and Meshach Taylor and Shadoe Stevens are more wonderful as the neurotic and self-absorbed, respectively, side-kicks. The writing stays fresh, although I am sorry to say that the episode that features John Ritter did kind of fall on its face - but even the most talented group has an off day once in a while. It's still great comedy that doesn't insult your intelligence.",1370822400,,769,4.661764705882353
8314486,5,B001K9OXEO,"Love the show...cannot wait to complete my Dave's world collection...loved season one, season two did not disappointment, as well.  The cast is good together, too!  Miss this show on TV!",1335139200,,186,5.166666666666667
8314487,5,B001K9OXEO,"I loved this series when it aired. When it finally became available on dvd I bought the first season and then the second season when it was released. Come on Paramount, it's been a long time since season two was released, get on the ball and release the rest of the series.",1322179200,,273,4.269230769230769
