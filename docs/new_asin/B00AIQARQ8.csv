5434997,5,B00AIQARQ8,"This ""double punch"" release is really explosive!

Both movies received stat-of-the-art transfer to Blu-Ray, turning the experience of watching them much better thtn you remember seeing them for the first time.

As for the movies themselves, what to say? Both are considered classics, The Dirty Dozen show the ugliness of war in disgraceful and tragic tones (including the famous scene where the African american soldier releases grenades over trapped people - including women - in a basement, and smiles while doing so); as for the Green Berets, I don't care aboout controversies if it is totally right wing or not. I just thought it to be a very good war movie.

It was a very good acquisiton to my collection.",1427241600,,711,4.908333333333333

5435000,3,B00AIQARQ8,"If this were only The Dirty Dozen it would get five stars but The Green Berets is nothing more than propagnada for the Viet Nam War. I am a Viet Nam Veteran and proud to be so, but this movie is so far from reality that any vet with in country experience would laugh their asses off at it. I love John Wayne movies for the most part but this one just sucks!",1417564800,,357,3.904109589041096
