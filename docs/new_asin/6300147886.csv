7803700,5,6300147886,"This is a beautiful Italian film starring Horst Buchholz, Cathering Spaak, and Miss Bette Davis.

Bette Davis has given her son Dino everthing...except his freedom. But her money can't buy him away from his dream of becoming an artist. He breaks from his mother and ends up living out a miserable existence, watching his hopes die. Then, on the verge of an emotional breakdown, he meets Cecilia, a gorgeous model as detached from life as he is. At first lust brings these two together, but for Dino, the meaningless relationship soon becomes an obssesion of love. Now he must conquer this woman who, indifferent to life and withdrawn from love, wants nothing more than an empty, physical affair.

Engrossing and exciting, The Empty Canvas paints a striking portrait of desperate love. It's a soul-searching love story, a film filled with passion, feeling and desire.",1134691200,11,866,5.006944444444445
7803701,5,6300147886,"This is not particularly a Bette Davis film, she has a rather small part in it (she's effective in this role), it is mainly a Horst Buchholz film - an excellent film however. It's an extremely underrated and highly entertaining film by Italian director Damiano Damiani, with a brilliant Horst Buchholz having a romantic adventure in the summer of 1963 in Rome : There is a magical aura to the film, which is also extremely sensual. The music - including Rita Pavone's ""Now that you're gone"" -  and the scenery in Rome add greatly to the rich atmosphere. Stylishly photographed in black & white, it's a real work of art. Photography on this level IS art. Overall the acting is great, especially a very naturalistic performance by lovely French actress Catherine Spaak. Though it's an Italian film, the language is English. American audiences may not take too well to this film, being that its style is very European. But highly recommended.",1090281600,7,939,4.832298136645963
7803702,2,6300147886,"JUST KIDDING!...In this Italian-made film from 1964, German-born actor Horst Buchholz plays Dino, a non-talented artist who's in love with Cecilia, a beautiful model played by Catherine Spaak. Dino introduces Cecilia to his blonde, Suthin'-accented American mother (Bette Davis, in a wig) and tries to impress her with his wealth. When Catherine leaves Dino for another man, Mama soothes her boy and encourages him to resume his artwork. A bad, pompous film which is only redeemed by watching the campy playing of Davis. I find it really ironic that you can purchase this ludicrous ""Bette Davis movie"" on video, yet certain FINE films such as OLD ACQUAINTANCE, IT'S LOVE I'M AFTER, FOG OVER FRISCO & ELIZABETH THE QUEEN are currently unavailable.",1033430400,2,746,5.1735537190082646
