8114076,5,B000ESTUVS,"One of the best videos of an artist working, considering and talking about his work. Spero and Golub's  mutually supportive relationship is wonderful to observe, and the growing old in the art life is a central theme. Golub's committed social and political work is important, and this film explores it in depth. Highly recommended!",1438646400,,331,5.12962962962963
