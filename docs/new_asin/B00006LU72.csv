7972255,2,B00006LU72,"I was very excited to get this dvd, as an avid practioner of Shorin-Ryu.  However, the dvd left a lot to be desired.  There is very lot footage of Soken, and the majority of the footage that is shown can be found on youtube for free.  I think that this was just a sad attempt of George Alexander attempting to make money again.  I would not waste your money, just search for Master Soken on youtube and you will have everything that this dvd has to offer.",1239148800,2,455,4.195402298850575
7972256,3,B00006LU72,"ALot of the footage that is discernable is not from Master Soken but from some other guy.

There is some footage of the Hakutusuru(or so the narrator Claims) but it was very short.

The peices of the weaponry/kata performed by Master Soken are excellent.

I reccomend it only if you have the extra $$ to throw around , it isn't all that great but is ok for the enthusiast

PS(The narrator becomes quite irratating)",1107820800,2,414,4.554054054054054
