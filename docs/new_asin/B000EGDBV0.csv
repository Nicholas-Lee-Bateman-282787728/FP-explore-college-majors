in these.  More, I always find it irritating when the manufacturer uses
TWO dvd's and Extra packaging where one dvd would be plenty.  This is
NOT my favofite purchase from this company.  I would label the whole
experience...disappointing.",1182816000,5,308,5.12
8160224,2,B000EGDBV0,"Lots of pictures that don't correspond to the text. Ok for an entertainment  vehicle, but not if you want to learn about Mexican Art! Talks about a seated statue of a person and all you see is the head. Very poor photography. Not well thought out. For me it is a waste of money. I expected a more professional job and more professional DVD of Mexican Art.",1169769600,8,355,4.298507462686567
