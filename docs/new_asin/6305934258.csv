Roll-up a doobie, grab your seniorita, toss back a few  margaritas and gooble down that Cheeseburger in Paradise baby.  Jimmy is  one cool sonuva-sunuva bi....sailor.  A true reflection of how a pilot  should look at 40.",960595200,14,371,5.083333333333333
1100051,5,6305934258,"I enjoyed the video very much and watch it over and over again. We see the early days of Jimmy with bad hair and bad teeth (my wife's focus - being in the Dental Profession) to today and less hair and great smiles. Smiles is what this video brings out in me! I only wish this video was on DVD so I won't wear it out. Ok, I'll still wear it out just like I do with the music CDs. When I get 'Cabin Fever' I'll put in the tape and look again at the streets of Key West and forget about shooting the freezer! PHins Up! Get this video! Please Jimmy, get this to DVD!",1038614400,5,562,3.853448275862069
1100052,5,6305934258,"While I wouldn't recommend that someone who has never heard of Jimmy Buffett start with this tape, you could actually do worse.
This man enjoys what he does, and the fun he's having is contageous.  His songs show it, his books show it and this video shows it.
Some of the bits are dated, others are cheesy.  So what?  It's light, pleasant entertainment that you will enjoy seeing more than once.
For those of you that are parrotheads, well, you already own a copy of this tape.  Don't be afraid to buy a copy of it as a present for a friend that only has a couple of Jimmy's albums in their collection.  They'll like it too.
Anyone that really dislikes Jimmy Buffett's music probably won't like the video either, but then again, they probably won't get far enough into the reviews to read this anyway.",1029283200,6,801,4.458904109589041
1100053,4,6305934258,"We really enjoyed this chronological tour through Jimmy Buffet's career.  Early ""videos"" are actually film footage from the 1970's of live performances and Jimmy, Jane, et al. just goofing around.  Then you get to see his recording company's various unsuccessful attempts to get a video onto Mtv in the 80's and 90's. Finally, there are some really good later concert videos and live performances.  The entire thing is charmingly narrated by Jimmy himself in his unrehearsed, low-key style. You feel like he's sitting right in your living room, just chatting with you.  The scenery in most videos is lush and tropical with lots of bonus shots of Key West in the 70's. It's nice to watch this when it's 20 degrees and the hockey game's on!",1010188800,,738,4.833333333333333
1100054,5,6305934258,"I like just about everything Jimmy puts out:  his CDs, videos, and his books.  He is a wonderful storyteller.  My wish now is that he does a new concert video before he retires.  Please, Jimmy, I know you have said ""never again"" but won't you do this for one of your oldest fans who has never been able to see you perform in person?",990489600,,332,4.140625
1100055,5,6305934258,"I am not one to watch many videos that come out, I don't even go to the movie theater that often. But when a Jimmy Buffett CD or in this case video comes out, I'll do anything to get my hands on it! If I had to give a review on a 0-10 basis this would be an 11. This video does what A Pirate Looks At 50 did, put Buffett's life into is own words which is the only way anything about Buffett can be done. Because you can't expect someone else to write the story of a singer-songwriter-author except for that person themself, and Jimmy has always done that with the passion and drive that anyone needs to write a biography of themselves. And Buffett showed that he is the best at all three of those in his many CD's, songs, and books that he has written. This video made me laugh, think a lot about how my life is now, I mean I am a teenager so I never lived through the 70's and I really don't remember much of the 80's. But it puts it into a young Parrothead's mind how life was during his generation, and makes us all realize one thing: ""We are all ""FRUITCAKES"" on this bus."" Rock on Jimmy and let's hope you give us another look at your life in terms of a video or another novel!!",980121600,11,1182,4.012711864406779
1100056,5,6305934258,This video is a great retrospective by Jimmy on Jimmy and I believe he made it just to thank his fans.  The only thing this video is missing is the full length concert footage.  Hopefully that one is coming soon.  Thank You Jimmy keep up the good work.,972259200,3,252,4.208333333333333
1100057,4,6305934258,"This video is a must be for every Parrott heads.  For a man who did not want to do the ""M-TV"" video thing, Jimmy has put together a large collection of videos.  My only complaint about this is that it is not  available on DVD.",963100800,5,226,3.977777777777778
1100058,3,6305934258,"Let me say that I am a fan in the purest sense of the word.  But I must say that the past few years I have seen Jimmy dwindle.  The movie was decent but it just goes to show that this man really did turn his back on  the ""old school"" way of doing things.  He used to say screw  corporate america and now he is sleeps with them on a routine basis.  I  hope his liquor sales help him in the future because his vidoes and  songwriting has gone nothing but downhill. ----sorry Jimmy.",962841600,2,479,3.968421052631579
1100059,5,6305934258,"We're a family (4) of Buffett fans, and believe all parrotheads should own this video.  Classic...we laughed, we smiled, we sang.  From the Walter-Keys to Redmond-Micorsoft-Washington...a must have.",962755200,,198,6.035714285714286
1100060,5,6305934258,Tales from Margaritavision is awesome.  Every parrothead should own this  video. From 1973 until 1999 these videos and concert shots are great.  Keep  on rocking and putting out your best music and videos they are the best,962668800,2,222,4.918918918918919
1100326,4,6305934258,"Well, at least JB DID release a video, as promised. But, some of the choices left me feeling let down.  A few ""80's style"" videos could have been omitted from ""Margaritavision"" or just replaced  with fresher material. Enough material to keep you from getting ""cabin  fever"" until concert time rolls around.",962409600,,306,4.96078431372549
1100327,4,6305934258,"I really enjoyed the video especially the older clips from the early 70's, in Key West and the live footage. The in-between videos were average.
I really wish they would release all of the Key West footage from the early  70's however. It is fascinating seeing Key West before it was invaded by  cruise ships, t-shirt shops, and the tourist stores.
As far as the videos  are concerened, I was surprised that the ""Holiday"" video off of  Banana Wind was not included. Perhaps it will be available in the  sequel?
Nevertheless, if you are a parrothead, you must get just to have  it with the rest of your Buffett music and video collection. (I bought mine  immediately upon receipt of my email from the coconut telegraph).",962150400,,719,4.658730158730159
1100328,5,6305934258,"In this video, which Jimmy Buffett narrates, the viewer can see some nostalgic scenes of Jimmy and Key West from the early 1970s.  In some of these videos from the early days, Jane Buffett, then girlfriend and now  wife of Jimmy, can be seen.  It is a wonderful look into the early Key West  life of Jimmy Buffett, before he knew what cash flow meant.  Also, some of  the 1980s videos on this tape show a very young Savannah Jane, eldest  daughter of Jimmy and Jane Buffett.  Finally, the 1990s videos are  presented.  In one, Savannah Jane, now a teenager and singing background  vocals for her father, can be seen.  The end of the tape shows footage from  the Beach House On the Moon tour.  ""The City"" shows Jimmy riding  his bicycle through cities on the tour  and interacting with fans.  It is a  great video.  Another favorite of mine is ""Take Another Road"",  which is a great song and video.  I can remember watching Jimmy sing this  one years ago on Johnny Carson's show.  The video for this song is  interesting as well.  If you are a student of Buffett, this video would be  a great learning tool for you.  I highly recommend it!",961977600,13,1138,4.424390243902439
1100329,1,6305934258,"Again, parrotheads living outside of the USA are being ignored. This Buffett video, like the last, is only available on NSTC and not PAL.  It's frustrating and disheartening. It is about time those in charge of Buffett  productions (and Mr Buffett himself) realised there IS life outside of  America. I rate it a one star, only because you don't provide reviewers  with the option of Zero.",961804800,,389,4.848484848484849
1100330,4,6305934258,"Parrotheads have made Key West's one-hit wonder a multi-millionaire by  installing him as one of the country's annual top 10 concert draws.
The  best videos on Buffett's just-released compilation tape, ""Tales from  MargaritaVision,"" show why.
For instance, the video for  ""Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes,"" one of Buffett's  signature songs, is simply a fun montage of audience footage. Fans ""do  Buffett"" costumed in everything from Hawaiian shirts and hula skirts  to parrot plumage and foam rubber shark suits. The parking lot turns into a  gigantic tailgate party. The faithful even set up their own wading and  diving pools, complete with faux palm trees.
Several other live videos on  ""MargaritaVision"" similarly capture the boundless energy and  exuberance of Buffett, his band, and especially his fans.
And while it  was made on a studio set, the seven-minute ""Fruitcakes"" basically  serves to let Buffett pay homage to his fans - the Prime Parrothead is  obviously having a ball leading his flock in a mini-Mardi Gras parade.
The tape's first four videos are excerpts from a promotional film,  ""Introducing Jimmy Buffett,"" made in 1973. Three feature a  shaggy, thickly sideburned Buffett with guitar on a sound stage,  interspersed with shots illustrating the songs in a mostly literal manner.
Then comes the compilation's one true gem. Any fan of the pre-disco '70s  should pay the price of the tape just to see ""Nautical Wheelers.""  Buffett performs the song ""unplugged"" before a small coffeehouse  crowd. It's either sweetly or comically nostalgic, depending on your point  of view, when a gangly, frizzy-bearded, rhythmically-challenged hippy gets  up and does a rather lurching boogie around the unfazed, ever-grinning  Buffett.
One wonders, viewing the compilation, what this counterculture  ""crowd"" of 20 or so would make of Buffett's modern-day  Margaritaville corporation. Even their Tarot cards probably couldn't have  foreseen Buffett the CEO, balding bard of 20,000-seat arenas, owner of  restaurant and retail chains, baseball teams and mansions.
As for the  remaining videos ... well, Buffett-the-business-tycoon's accountants no  doubt did the math. Parrotheads will pay up, making  ""MargaritaVision"" worth releasing, and they're bound to forgive  Buffett's non-live '80s videos.
I mean, we're talking the '80s in full  effect here:
We're talking Jimmy jumping around in ""Miami  Vice"" fashions and too much rouge.
We're talking cutting-edge  computer graphics created on a Commodore 64.
We're talking thin ties,  bouncy synthesizers and cauldrons of dry ice on day-glo sets made of  cardboard.
We're talking Jimmy driving big Caddy convertibles, a  female-as-sexual-object silently smiling at his side.
We're talking a  jarring reminder for those of us who can remember MTV's youth - be glad  Buffett wasn't into big hair, jets of flame and heavy metal skulls. As for  lasers, they probably weren't in his budget.
To be fair, a couple of the  '80s videos really aren't too bad; they just look severely dated.
One of  them, ""Take Another Road,"" uses the simple, poignant atmosphere  of an abandoned drive-in to tell the story of a homeless man dreaming back  on happier times. This one wouldn't look that out of place today and  deserved wider airplay.
Those looking for a greatest hits summary of  Buffett's career won't find it in ""MargaritaVision."" It appears  that, for the most part, Buffett made videos of the completely wrong songs.  Non-parrotheads would probably boo him off the stage if the video lineup  were a concert setlist.
The larger value of ""MargaritaVision""  is historical - it shows how music videos developed from documentaries into  concept art into thinly disguised commercials.
Parrotheads will  appreciate that Buffett provides tongue-in-cheek introductions to each  video. In fact, Buffett's introductions are what rescue his '80s era videos  from total disaster.
After all, you can't be too tough on a guy who  grins infectiously as he explains how cheesy his own videos are.",961718400,15,4037,5.3728
1100331,5,6305934258,"This brought back memories of the first time I saw Jimmy in concert.  I was 16, and it was 1973, about the time most of this was recorded. This is a must have for parrotheads and ""normal"" people alike.  It shows  the development of a talented storyteller from a man and a guitar, to what  he is today.  His choice of songs to include on this video was an answer to  all of our requests.  Thanks, Bubba!",961545600,,402,4.142857142857143
1100332,4,6305934258,"First of all, let me preface my review stating I am a huge Buffett fan.  Second, let me say that I don't like everything he does.  And, that includes some of the videos in this compilation.  But, let me start with  the good.  There are 4 videos from 1973 that feature some of his best  music, and give us a glimpse of Buffett in his Key West days.  Absolutely  fascinating!  And, there are about 4 videos that offer us primarily Buffett  in concert, with crowd shots.  Very good.  But, unfortunately, there are 6  videos that are pure cheese.  Although I like a couple of the songs, most  of them are also some his his weakest songs.  Whether Buffett is flying  around in a top hat in ""La Vie Dansante"", or dancing with slices  of fruitcake in ""Fruitcakes"", these videos are very painful to  watch. I would recommend the video for it's good points.  Plus, it's a good  companion to Buffett's ""Live by the Bay"" video.  But be prepared  to wince a little during the middle section.",961372800,7,979,4.4375
1100333,4,6305934258,"I am a huge Jimmy Buffett fan (I own every album he has ever released) and  I really enjoyed this video!  This is a collection of some of his  ""music videos"" that have been filmed over the years, with Jimmy  introducing each one.  The first four videos totally blew me away - they  are basically just grainy videos shot in Key West in the early seventies.  I especially enjoyed the Come Monday video showing him and Jane driving  along the beach in his old truck, picking up two friends along the way and  just generally enjoying the easy life.  The Nautical Wheelers video is  amazing too - it shows Jimmy playing to a crowd of Key West locals packed  into a small bar and totally getting into his music.  This is how I always  imagined Jimmy, just him and his guitar in a bar with his fans, and now we  are lucky to have it captured on film.  The middle section of the tape is  the weakest section, because it contains some really cheesy 80's  ""music videos"" to go along with some of Jimmy's weakest music.  But the last 25-30 minutes makes up for it with some great concert clips  from Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Latitudes and The City, showing Jimmy  riding his bike around all the cities he plays in.  Any true Parrotthead  needs to get this - you will not be disappointed!",961027200,,1284,4.370212765957447

The video has clips all the way from '73 until the Beach House on the Moon Tour last year.  There are clips from his early days  in key west, to the cheezy video days of the 80's, to some great live  concert shots in the late 90's.
