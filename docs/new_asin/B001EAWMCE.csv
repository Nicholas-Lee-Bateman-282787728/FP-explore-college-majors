3547777,5,B001EAWMCE,I saw this film on line parts of it. I did not know this was a show done some years ago and very popular. This is the remake version. Like all Japanese films the story lines I I see them are easy to follow and very entertaining.,1316822400,,228,3.872340425531915
3547778,3,B001EAWMCE,"This movie would have been better if it didn't have so much nudity and wasn't so much on the sex. Quite litterally that is really all that it was. It wasn't what I expected it to be. No wonder there isn't any English version to this movie unlike the 2006 movie Yo-Yo Girl Cop with Aya Matsuura. I think I know why Aya didn't star in this movie, it had to be something she didn't want to do, show off her body like that. If that is the case, I totally respect Aya more than ever for she is a popular singer in Japan and a film like this would highly possibly had ruined her image if she was to have starred in it. I would suggest that if you get anything when it comes to Yo-Yo Girl Cop, get the movie with Aya Matsuura - Yo-Yo Girl Cop; it has much more action and even without the nudity in that movie Aya Matsuura is ""Atusi"" = hot (in Japanese).&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yo-Yo-Girl-Cop/dp/B000OU6XVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yo-Yo Girl Cop</a>",1304553600,,997,4.702857142857143
3547779,2,B001EAWMCE,"Within the first ten seconds of this movie, there is a sign that reads, ""Beware of Perverts.""  Well, at least there aren't any false pretenses.

Moromie Saki, aka Agent ""See-through Panties,"" is a former leader of a gang of sexy girls - which she states several times throughout the movie to impress others - and she doesn't F around.  She's vulgar, abusive, violent, and throws a mean yo-yo.  With a drug addicted prostitute for a mother, she bounces from relative to relative until she ends up in boarding school.  Learning from the school's sadistic head-master (ala Beatrix Kiddo and Master Pai Mie), she gets a certificate of achievement for being a Thug Boss.  With credentials like that, it's no surprise the local law enforcement imprisons her mom on drug charges so they can blackmail Saki into becoming an undercover agent at a High School with ties to a prostitution ring.

After meeting an effeminate boy, Saki ditches her only friend (a boy whose face looks like he's perpetually smelling a fart), her see-through panties, and her cover so that her love interest can make it past second base without awkwardness.  She befriends Asuka (Rio Nakamura), the local girl-gang leader, amidst the most unrealistic initiation beat-down in the history of cinema.  A scene or two later she loses her V-Card to the sounds of 70s porn music.  It's not as if the plot is meaningful at all, and the discontinuity is proven by the lack of transition between scenes.  When it comes to the nudity and sex scenes, they definitely do not accentuate plot, and serve only to fill in the gaps between the laugh out loud moments of unintentional comedy.

Shortly after a fellatio instruction scene with a banana, a Japanese dude in a Cato-mask gives Asuka the old two-inch back-and-forth - there is supposed to be some sort of plot connectivity here, but it only served as another opportunity for my friend and I to crack jokes.  After a murder takes place, the viewer is treated with hilarious sound effects that accompany the usage of Saki's deadly weapon of choice: the yo-yo.  For a yo-yo master, however, she's incredibly unimpressive.  Not once did I see her ""Walk the Dog"" or ""Rock the Baby.""  What action there is, however, consists of fight choreography that Stevie Wonder would criticize.  It's bad.

Everything else about this movie is hardly worth mentioning except to say that it's equally as B-rated as the laughable action.  There is not a single aspect that doesn't deserve derision.  The ending is a complete mystery, as Saki walks up abandoned streets towards the Prime Minister's office and drops a bomb.  Or something.  The only thing missing from this movie is Godzilla, and it would have probably served as a better ending.  Nonetheless, I had a great time watching this movie and laughing at it's ridiculousness.  This is great MST3K stuff.",1246233600,6,2852,4.869294605809128
3547780,3,B001EAWMCE,"Woopak the Thrill is about to lose all credibility and ""fans""...

""Yo-yo Girl Cop"" starred J-pop star Aya Matsuura as the beautiful Saki. That film was manga-inspired and while it was somewhat silly, it was action-packed and fun to watch. Aya Matsuura's film however, did fulfill any male fantasies about a hot Japanese girl in a sailor moon outfit. ""Yo-yo Sexy Girl Cop"" (aka. Sukepan deka: Bajin nemu= Moromie Saki) is a sexy spoof of that action packed film which starred Aya Matsuura. Director Daigo Udagawa seems poised to fulfill all male fantasies when he casts the Beautiful, ex-AV star/nude model Mihiro Taniguchi (Cruel Restaurant) as Saki Moromi, code-named agent ""see-through panties""--do I have your attention yet?

Saki (Mihiro) is a beautiful high school girl secretly working for a secret agency as ""special student"" undercover cop. Her uniform includes a pair of see-through underwear. She is sent to investigate a prostitution ring in Takanoha high, in exchange, her mother who has been incapacitated is to be set free. Once there, Saki is picked on and bullied by other teenagers because of her former status as a ""thug girl-boss"". While attending school there, she becomes fond of a young man named Takuya and befriends the school hottie, Asuka (Rio Nakamura). Saki seemed poised to find happiness and becomes torn between love and duty. Fate intervenes and her new friend until her former classmate/prostitute Asuka is murdered while attending to a client. Saki takes on personal vengeance on those who run the prostitution ring who is the school's headmaster and a hot teacher named Reiko. Her weapon of choice is a deadly yo-yo and her battle cry is ""I will never forgive you!""

To be honest, I really don't know how to approach this film. Heck, I don't even know why I'm reviewing it. Anyway, the film is fun--it is full of sexy humor and does have the usual elements of a ""pink"" film. The humor does remind me somewhat of the Korean sex-comedy ""Sex is Zero"" and its main premise is very similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yo-Yo-Girl-Cop/dp/B000OU6XVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yo-Yo Girl Cop</a>. Oh, yeh, it did make me say ""What the heck?"" and did cause me to scratch my head a number of times. The film has teen issues omnipresent throughout: fitting in, meeting a boy and curiosity about sex. But the film also has the usual elements of ""pink"" violence such as vengeance and lost of innocence. The violence is toned down and is a step backward from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Machine-Girl/dp/B0016K76V4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Machine Girl</a>&nbsp;or the film with Aya Matsuura. So don't expect an ultra-violent movie.

Now the film's main draw has to be the abundance of sex and nudity. The nudity isn't full frontal as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Glamorous-Life-of-Sachiko-Hanai/dp/B000OT6V2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai</a>&nbsp;but there is a good number of them. Mihiro, Rio Nakamura and the sexy teacher (don't know her name) are seen in their naked glory for quite a number of times and they're nicely shot. The sex scenes are quite graphic; they're better than the ones in late night cable but a step backward from actual hardcore stuff. The action (ahem) other than the sex, I mean are the fight scenes have a lot to be desired. All they involve is Saki using her yo-yo and flashing her see-through underwear.

""YO-YO SEXY GIRL COP"" is a fun watch I supposed as long as one remembers exactly what he is watching. If you liked ""Ikki Tousen"" then this film may be for you. The film's plot is irrelevant and it is very obvious that all the effort is put in showcasing Mihiro`s beauty. (and Japanese prancing around, teasing with their short skirts). I often wonder just how Japanese filmmakers can make almost any film that comes to their mind--no one knows sleazy and exploitive films better than the Europeans and the Japanese. This film is just pure ""guilty pleasure"" and geared towards Mihiro's fans.
Definitely not for everybody but BEER or Sake will enhance its viewing experience.

Recommended with caution to fans of Japanese ""pink"" films and a rental to those who like ""late night"" cinemax. [2  Stars]

8297359,1,B001EAWMCE,"Way back in ages past, in a time when you had to wait for your Netflix movies to arrive in the mail, I ordered what I thought to be a movie and it's sequel.  Boy was I wrong...

Yo-Yo Girl Cop was a kinda funny movie about a woman on the police force that used yo-yos to fight crime.  It was goofy and over the top, but exactly what I expected.

Yo-Yo Sexy Girl Cop was not a sequel.  It wasn't even really related to the other movie except by name.  You see, unbeknownst to me, I had ordered a porno.  Now, I'm not against porn, it just wasn't what I was expecting.  The description did nothing to inform me of this before I asked Netflix to send it to me.  I expected boobs.  What I did not expect, were all the terribly acted sex scenes, most of which were rapes.

This isn't fun goofy porn parody like Lord of the G-Strings or Family Guy XXX.  It isn't entertaining.  And it sure as hell isn't sexy.

It has no redeeming qualities, I'd skip it.",1510704000,,948,4.081521739130435
8297360,2,B001EAWMCE,"Where to begin. Low budget, slow pacing, and very little polish seem like decent first remarks.

the film has all the characteristics of a manga/hentai. That being said, don't get your hopes up. There is no nudity, very little near naked tease, no blood to speak of and very little violence. Their absence was not made up for with good storyline, dialog, characters, or acting.

Why still 2 stars? 'Agent See Through Panties' still made me chuckle and left me thinking this was a spoof of most hentai that just fell flat.

I would recommend showing this to a batch of your drunken friends and watching them get excited over and over at the prospect of nudity only to have it flit away every time.",1501891200,,696,4.552
