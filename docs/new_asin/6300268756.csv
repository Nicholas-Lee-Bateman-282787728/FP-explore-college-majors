I won't give anything away because if you like Ali MacGraw, then you need to see this.",1359590400,3,249,3.8823529411764706
296199,4,6300268756,"Just Tell Me What You Want is a comedy starring Ali MacGraw, Alan King, and Peter Weller.  Ali plays the long-time mistress of millionaire Alan King, but she falls in love with aspiring writer Peter Weller.  The fight scene between Alan and Ali in a New York department store is hilarious.  I bought the film because of Ali's shower scene, where she shows her breasts.  I also liked the film because of how Alan's family and servants treated Ali as one of the family.  Myrna Loy plays Alan's secretary.",1323043200,3,502,4.595505617977528
296200,5,6300268756,"Sidney Lumet is not a director known for comedies.  For a goodly part of ""Just Tell Me Want You Want"" I thought ""Dog Day Afternoon"" was funnier and this flick only slightly more raucous than ""The Pawnbroker"".  Bear in mind that the principals here on the surface are not nice people.  They are cynical, ruthless, mercenary and cold-blooded.  I was ready to dismiss it as a heartless exercise.  One, however, has to allow the deliberate pacing of the film and script to appreciate what Lumet and scenarist Jay Presson Allen are trying to say here.  This is brilliant hybrid of dark and screwball comic sensibilities.  Yes these are essentially mean and unsympathetic people.  That said they are allegedly human beings and they need love even if it comes as some sort of financial negotiation or merger.  The cast here is uniformly terrific.  Alan King, better known as a stand-up comic and TV emcee, was born to play Max Herschel a man amasses fortunes and collects mistresses the way kids collect baseball cards. I've never been impressed with Ali MacGraw as an actress but as Herschel's primary mistress she's given a part with a little grist she runs with it.  It's remarkable how sparks fly when she goes toe-to-toe with King whether they be romantic or mercantile.  Myrna Loy shines as Herschel's seen-it-all secretary whose as adept at picking up his cleaning as well as organizing his love life.  In less profane times, Loy and William Powell used to sparkle with this kind of material.  I remember when this film came out in the Spring of 1980 it had a blink and you missed it theatrical run.  It was promoted as some kind of routine wacky romantic comedy ergo the poster art of MacGraw whacking a prone King with her purse.  The studios didn't know what to do with tricky material like this but ambitious viewers should appreciate it.",1295740800,4,1842,4.745283018867925
296201,5,6300268756,"As a fan of ""screwball"" comedies from the 1930's and 1940's I am always on the prowl for a contemporary film that doesn't ""dumb down"" it's dialogue and calls itself a ""comedy"" just because it's filled with a lot of drunken teens/adults doing, what I call, a lot of ""toilet"" humor.  Gone are the days of rapid-fire dialogue that is smartly written and filled with intelligent laughs.  Gone are the well thought out situations that put the characters involved in one outrageous plot twist seamlessly transitioning to the next outrageous plot twist.  Today they ""hit"" you over the head with a hammer with sex jokes instead of using dialogue with clever sexual innuendo subtly written in every line.

I ordered the dvd-r of the 1980 film JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT and was very pleased with the transfer of the film and was thrilled with the film itself.  I had missed seeing this film in the theaters and having now watched it I can say that it is an excellent, contemporary ""screwball"" comedy.  It's just what I've been looking for and thought I would never find.  A dialogue driven comedy with interesting characters that draw you in to their wealthy world of wheeling and dealing.  Not just in their everyday business world, but also in their relationships.

Alan King is superb in his role as the obnoxious ""Max"" and Ali MacGraw handles her part as ""Bones"" beautifully and with style.  I wish she had done more of these kind of light, romantic comedy roles.  She went ""all-out"" in the famous fight scene in Bergdorf Goodmans.  A very young, good-looking Peter Weller keeps up with all the ""heavyweights"" in the cast.  Add old pros like Keenan Wynn, Myrna Loy and Dina Merrill into the mix and you have what essentially could have been filmed in black and white and directed by Preston Sturges.  Thanks goes to director Sidney Lumet for giving us a contemporary ""screwball"" comedy that was underrated and deserves to be seen!",1295136000,6,1925,4.724550898203593
296202,5,6300268756,"The 1930s were the golden age of screwball comedies dominated by such quirky films as Sullivan's Travels, It Happened One Night, Palm Beach Story and more. Most reviewers dread a press release that starts, ""In the tradition of great screwball comedies..."" yet ""Just Tell Me What You Want"" comes as close as any film has since Billy Wilder's ""Some Like It Hot."" Sidney Lumet's sensibility, Alan King's impeccable acting (his greatest performance), Jay Presson Allen's adaptation of her own novel and Myrna Loy-who performed in some of the great comedies of the 1930s-all conspire to create a marvelous look at the foibles of the rich and foolish. I keep lusting for a DVD of this forgotten sleeper, but it seems to be a hopeless wish...",1237766400,2,735,4.888
296203,5,6300268756,"I first saw this movie in the early 80's became an instant Alan King fan and purchased it immediately.  The movie was hilarious.  It is about a tycoon (Max) with a alcoholic wife (Connie), mistress (Bones) and a protective secretary (Stella) and how Max's agressive, manipulative and vindictive personality affects all.  Anyone who watches this movie will never forget the hilarious scene where Bones (McGraw) attacks Max (King) at Bergdorf's.
The review below is unchanged but I am happy to inform everyone that Warner Archives released this movie.  It is burned on demand.

******************************************************************

You could classify this movie as the comedic version of Wall Street.  Gordon Gecko - ""Greed is good""
Max Hershel - ""You don't get poor by taking.""

It was wonderful to see Myrna Loy as Stella the protective and sensible secretary. Also who could forget Ali McGraw as Bones the intelligent and ambitious mistress caught up in Max's (Alan King's) selfish, crazy and hectic world.  Dina Merrill as Connie was classy as usual.  I have been a fan of Keenan Wynn since Finian's Rainbow and he was wonderful as Max's old rival Seymour Berger.  Also, a very young Peter Weller as Bones's love interest Steven Routledge in his second big screen appearance.

I cherish my video of this movie and hope that Warner Bros. releases this movie on DVD before my VHS copy deteriorates.",1227398400,8,1412,5.144736842105263
296204,5,6300268756,"And you'll find yourself falling in love with it.  Alan King -- ""Max"" --- is hilarious and Ali McGraw perfect in this hilarious upscale comedy.  Fun actors included:  Keenan Wynn (as a ailing Jewish tycoon); Dina Merrill (as Alan King's blueblood but drunken wife); Judy Kaye (great Broadway actress as Alan King's daughter ""Baby"" -- her daughter is named ""Newbaby""); Myrna Loy (yes the old film star) as Max's sec'y; and Tony Roberts as Keenan Wynn's effete and homosexual movie company president.",1144972800,12,498,5.048780487804878
296205,5,6300268756,"An admitted fan of obscure titles, this film is one that sits proudly on my shelf and just about everyone asks ""What's this about?"" It's about life. The plot revolves around a selfish and wealthy man with a wife, and a secretary and a mistress who alternately wants and then rebuffs just about everyone. Alan King is drop dead great in the most solid performance of his career as Max the high rolling lover of long suffering mistress Bones Burton (Ali McGraw). He wants her, he doesn't want her, he doesn't know what he wants. But he definitely doesn't want anyone else to have her, especially playwright Peter Weller. Let the battle of the sexes begin once again and Max is a man who never loses anything. The very rich are not at all that different than you and I, but their problems unfold a bit differently when set against the backdrop of designer clothes and jewels, are juggled by assistants and buffers, and are played out in fabulous penthouses and mansions. Somehow it seems a bit more hilarious. A good solid screenplay and an even, funny film under the direction of Sidney Lumet. It is worth buying and seeing more than once. Look for Myrna Loy who is wonderful as Max's secretary.",997833600,34,1193,4.605633802816901

296289,4,6300268756,"Ali McGraw may not be the best actress you've ever seen, but she turned in one of her best performances in this romp, a modern version of the screwball comedies of the 30s & 40s. Alan King does a great job as a manipulative executive who's used to getting his way, whatever it takes. Myrna Loy is excellent as his long-suffering secretary. The fight scene between McGraw & King in Bergdorf's is not to be missed!",1403654400,2,412,4.434210526315789
296290,5,6300268756,"I love this movie........It was just as funny as I remembered. Ali Macgraw as a NYC female Anderson Cooper of the late '70 's
and mistress to the very wealthy and powerful Allen King interviews and falls in love with young playwright played by Peter Weller. The story zigs and zags it's way to create a wonderfully rich,warm and witty tapestry of the many levels of love. If for nothing else the Bergdorf Goodman scene is worth the price of this movie alone! Very smartly written and directed.",1400371200,,493,4.613636363636363

296292,1,6300268756,"I  just hated the movie.  Not a very good script, and the only movie I've ever liked Ali McGraw in was ""Love Story"", and I didn't think she was very good in that one either.  Even ""Love Story"" would've been better with another actress playing her part. She just can't act, and ""Just Tell Me What You Want"" was like so many other movies I've seen before.  I couldn't even view the entire movie, I was so bored, and I love movies.",1370563200,,428,4.182926829268292
296293,5,6300268756,"Honestly, the focus on Alan King in this ""romance"" movie is completely off the chain perfection. Ali McGraw is flawless. I love that she has an edge in this movie. Myrna Loy's delivery during her few scenes stole the show. She's such a treasure. The rest of the cast made acting look effortless as they merged together like a perfectly made martini....""said the elephant, as he danced among the chickens..."".",1367884800,4,408,4.8428571428571425
296294,3,6300268756,"Saw this in theaters when it came out, then got the VHS version, have been waiting patiently for the DVD.

 ""Just Tell Me..."" isn't a perfect film, it gets a little lost in the middle with a sub-plot that drags. Still, the central love story, between Ali MacGraw and Alan King is hard to resist. She's smart. He's all bluster, but has a good heart. And you know that, deep down, they're made for each other -- even if his ego, business life and fractured marriage stand in the way. Myrna Loy is wonderful, as are Dina Merrill, Keenan Wynn and most of the talented supporting cast.

 The movie brings Ali back to Old Westbury Gardens -- the mansion there was also used in ""Love Story.""

 King has never been better, and he is hilarious when he loses his temper -- which is often. McGraw is also terrific, and strikes just the right balance between patient girl-on-the-side and super-successful girl-about-town. She knows what she wants. But getting it involves some serious (and seriously charming) negotiations with someone who has mastered the art of the deal.",1364774400,5,1061,4.708108108108108

7808373,1,6300268756,"2 adult children try to grow up. King is married but keeps Ali as a spare. She wants more. They ultimately figure it out but not without destroying a dept store and having the usual marital, romantic, and business casualties along the way. I thought ever-youthful McGraw pursuing older King wasn't romantically believable, tho their comedy was era spot on. And she, as a liberated woman, goes into childish purse-bashing to knock sense into King's rich know-it-all persona who is blind to her inner woman. Maybe it was her opening post-medical  scene and his callous (non)response that set the rest on the wrong foot. It just came off as a shuffle-juggle of when Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood did Helen Gurley Brown.",1516752000,,715,4.860655737704918

7808376,5,6300268756,"Based on a novel by TV writer-producer Jay Presson Allen, this may be the finest performance ever by Ali McGraw, as well as brilliant acting by a stellar cast.  Alan King plays a billionaire whose mistress and he begin a massive feud when she believes she's fallen in love with a writer (played by Peter Weller).  The fight scene in Bloomingdale's alone is worth the movie!  There is a bit of nside Jewish humour, but it's generally self-explanatory.  King is brilliant with some of the film's best jokes: example, referring to a large sale of movie rights--  (King) ""They even dribbled off the in-flight & cable rights; that, they sold to themselves.""  (Secretary) ""Can you prove it?"" (King) ""I can't prove it, but I know it.  They made a deal with some forget-it distributor in New Jersey.  Now, who the **** lives in New Jersey?  I'll tell you who lives in New Jersey.  Cousins live in New Jersey!""  Kudos also for actors Tony Roberts, who plays a gay studio head & Peter Weller as the writer.  However,special kudos for two of Hollywood's great old-school character actors: Keenan Wynn as Tony Roberts' Jewish grandfather & Myrna Loy as King's long-suffering secretary, Stella!  Not the Marx Brothers, assuredly, but a very, very funny movie!",1484006400,,1246,4.820754716981132
