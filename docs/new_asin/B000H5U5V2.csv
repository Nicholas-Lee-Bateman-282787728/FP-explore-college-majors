We can't really tell from the set list outlining the DVD's songs but if it doesn't include ""In Spite of all the Danger"", ""Please Please Me"" or ""I'll Get You"" it really won't be the same semi-retrospective show that Sir Paul presented. Another DVD with ""Hey Jude""? - ""Just the people on the left side - Just the people in the middle now"". I already paid for that one three times. Lets hope for deliverance that he gets it right this time.....

I'd rather watch the band play.  Anyone ever see Wings ""Rock Show""?  Great stuff.  Grainy and the audience wasn't starring in it like ""Back in The US"".

2628032,5,B000H5U5V2,"I was lucky to see Paul 3 times on the 2005 US tour - Anaheim, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles...........you'll see on this concert film why he's the real King of Rock and Roll. Gems like ""I'll Get You"", ""I'll follow the sun"", ""Mystery Tour"", classics like Maybe I'm Amazed"", Good Day Sunshine, Hey Jude, new ones like Jenny Wren, rareties like Flaming Pie.! The list is incredible, the emotions are sky high. Bass, Piano, Guitar, Acoustic, Voice.......all fantastic -Rusty, Abe, Wix, Brian are probably his best and energetic band ever - the lights and video are the best you can get.

2628063,2,B000H5U5V2,"The music is great where you can find it.  What ruins it for me is the amount of time wasted on celebrities and fans instead of the band and the music.  Some of the over-the-top fans seem rather creepy.  It appears a bit self-serving for McCartney to include comments from celebrities, politicians, etc. saying how great he is.  Do not bother purchasing this one.  Instead, get Paul McCartney & Wings Rockshow from 1976 or Paul's ""unplugged"" concert from 1991.",1441584000,,460,4.772151898734177

2628081,5,B000H5U5V2,"The Best Post Beatles McCartney DVD...Here are the pluses:

As far as vocal production goes, it's second to none and as far as vocal quality goes it's equally amazing! On some songs such as ""Good Day Sunshine"" if you closed your eyes and just listened to his voice you'd think it was the Beatles live in the 60's. Paul's vocals are so good you'll turn your head at times. His voice is identical to way back when on so many songs. It's not just McCartney. He's done many great performances. Kudos are also due to the production team as they captured the original record quality and greatness in his voice. And that same production team captured how tight his band was...instrumentally and vocally! He does rare Beatles songs on here like ""For No One"", ""Please, Please Me"", ""I Will"", ""Fixing a Hole"" and others. ""Penny Lane"" is outstanding and very few except die hard fans will notice the slight error in lyrics as Paul's singing sounds unbelievably true to the original! Plus, he performs a rare song spot on from one of his most controversial albums after the Beatles split - RAM - ""Too Many People"" which many felt was a dig at John when they were feuding. If you are a Beatles and/or Wings fan this is a must and a bargain to boot! I have rarely heard him perform any songs of the RAM album.

Here are the so called ""negatives"" - at least according to some of the reviews I've read here:

Some on here think there are too many audience shots - people of all ages - laughing, dancing and even crying at times, (including celebrity glimpses such as Billy Joel - Yeah - another great!, Jack Nicholson, Clint Black & Howard Stern just to name a few). Ok, some might find Stern controversial but it's a testament as to the diverse audience McCartney appeals to. The only problem with the minor criticisms I've read is I don't see it as being a negative at all - it just adds to the atmosphere! McCartney as well as the Beatles music are second to none but the audience also has to be included to fully appreciate the overall reaction. Just as the Ed Sullivan and Shea Stadium performances among many others showed audience hysteria, this performance reveals in greater depth just exactly what Paul McCartney and the Beatles still mean to so many people!

I hate to say this but face the facts - if we're lucky enough we will age and if you hear someone sounding so awesome at that age I can understand it bringing tears to many eyes. Funny thing is, it wasn't just seniors in tears or overcome with excitement & joy - there were kids and young people as well - both male and female!  This DVD captured the whole atmosphere.

If you don't care about occasional panning of the audience and want to hear the ultimate McCartney audio experience, buy this DVD! It's Paul at his best. Whoever did the sound on this deserves accolades. And of course, so does Paul. This is a vocal masterpiece!",1416268800,2,2884,4.483809523809524

Sure it has a few too many crowd shots and a few songs (Hey Jude, Let it be) are cut very short due to commentary spots but the set list choices, performances and on/off stage banter are absolutely incredible. I mean it doesn't get any better ""For no one"" ""I Will"" ""Fine Line"" ""English Tea"" and more amazing song selections that you don't here in recent tour years. I read so many negative reviews and I don't understand why. I missed this tour stop when it was here in my city due to work and I'm so glad I recently picked up this DVD.",1404950400,,581,4.150442477876106

Well, I bought this to have a recent Paul McCartney live show and enjoy some songs of The Beatles era as well... then I realized there's a documental-kinda-stuff going on so you will miss some live parts while they talk... I've seen similar shows before so I thought it was fine but it wasn't... ""Hey Jude"" was totally taken out because they decided to put the history of a family that goes to the show instead... how sweet!... yes it is but how can you take out a worldwide anthem like that?...",1402444800,,523,4.402061855670103

2628114,5,B000H5U5V2,"Sir Paul consistently delivers the high-quality music he is famous for in this video - I enjoyed it from start to finish. He is deservedly a global icon and the historic interlude with the astronauts was noteworthy. As mentioned in the movie, it was especially gratifying to see the mixture of generations that attend Paul's shows. An excellent addition to anyone's music catalog.",1380672000,,380,5.0476190476190474
2628115,5,B000H5U5V2,I'm one of those who likes the behind scenes and crowd reaction. Paul has always been my favorite Beatle and of course loved Wings in the 1970's (Just got Rockshow in Blue Ray ... Awesome). With this DVD like his others in the past the concert was great and to me did an outstanding job covering Beatles songs and some of his solo material including some Wings. Yeah .... it would have been just as nice to have all the concert footage together only and then show all the other stuff as extras but either way very enjoyable to watch bringing back those memories ... Heck ... I remember seeing The Beatles on the Ed Sullivan show when I was 4 years old back in 1960's. I give this DVD a solid 5 stars but if I had my way I would give it more.,1375142400,,741,4.117241379310345

2628117,1,B000H5U5V2,"I just saw this title on Amazon. It seems like Sir Paul has a second career on releasing concert DVDs. This is what, his 400th live concert (just a little sarcasm) DVD?

Wouldn't it be nice if one day there was a concert video shot from one camera, simulating the 15th row center stage. A concert to watch as a paying fan would actually view it live.

As far as The Space Within Us, I'll take a pass. Wings Over America is a far superior investment. Now if he is up to making a Rock CD and if the lads and ladies would be kind enough to remaster and release 'Let It Be' the movie, well that would be something, really would be something...",1370390400,,639,4.145161290322581

When we all sat down on Christmas night and started the Dvd, it skipped and froze for the first 3 minutes. No matter how may times we started it over and cleaned it and tried it never would play the right way.  I called amazon and they sent me a replacement dvd which was also very bad.  After the 2nd one I just wanted my money back.  DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM and if you do then prepare to be disapointed.

2628147,4,B000H5U5V2,"This performance is as much a concert as it is a ""Paulcumentary""- a sort of ""when I'm 64, still around wowing crowds and sponging all the adoration"". Several of the negative reviews are on target. I resisted buying the DVD when it was first issued after reading some of the reviews. But the blue ray edition generated many more five star reviews which caught my attention and changed my mind.

This is not a straight through concert but delightful nonetheless. Sir Paul performs many Fab Four songs and several from his solo years. The film is filled with family oriented images from the concert tour. The band executes well and most consumers with a large video collection will keep this somewhat unusual concert format too in their libraries. Picture quality is very good. Audio is ok, not superb (redistributed 2 channel stereo).

I yearn for blue ray editions of Joe Cocker's ""Across From Midnight"", the Stones' ""Rock N' Roll Circus"" and Roger Waters' ""The Wall in Berlin"". Those are killer concerts!",1302652800,4,1004,4.8654970760233915

2628149,5,B000H5U5V2,"This is a review for the Blu Ray disc. I must be easy to please. The crowd shots didn't spoil the experience for me like others have complained about. Firstly this Blu Ray is at least region A and B.It plays fine on my region B locked player. The image quality is truly excellent as is the audio though the back cover says it is PCM 5.1 (uncompressed audio)so probably not DTS HD.Maybe the surround mix could have been given more attention but it has plenty of presence and sounds great.

McCartney is in fine voice at this concert and I think on a musical level it is definately up there with `Good Evening New York' He does a fantastic version of `Too Many People' from the `Ram'album and some Beatles songs that have never been performed on his other live DVD's. Also I really enjoyed the songs from his new album at the time in `Chaos and Creation' especially a rocking version of `Fine Line'.

If you can deal with the numerous interviews and back slapping this is still a great buy. The music says it all.",1297382400,5,1011,4.372340425531915

The music's there a-plenty but you really get a feel for how it affects people of all ages & cultures. More of the same with other bands would be great but I guess no-one alive would have such an audience-affect as Mr McCartney.,1281830400,5,366,4.477611940298507
2628152,5,B000H5U5V2,"This DVD was taken pretty much in the same vein as the previous release of the Moscow/St Pete DVD.
Many little side trips during the concert. Tended to stop the nice flow the concert was creating.
I gave it 5 stars because for one thing, I got it at a very low price. You can't deny listening to
Macca do the old Fab 4 tunes without a smile on your face...and maybe a few tears. The rendition of
Please Please Me during the encore was a special moment. Macca taking the lead on a song that was normally
sang by John Lennon. The fan reaction during the encore was quite emotional to watch.",1278028800,,588,4.212389380530974
2628153,5,B000H5U5V2,"After 45 years, it is absolutely extraordinary that Paul McCartney can still touch the hearts of an audience with his music and his performance. This is one of the very finest concert DVDs I've ever seen.  I'm kicking myself for not going to a live McCartney show.  Other than a bit too much time featuring a couple of fan families (heartwarming but I'd rather see the show), the DVD offers up one great song after another.  The band is terrific, Paul is in great voice and the songs cover his entire career with lots of Beatle tunes.  All I can say is ""Over 40 years ago today, McCartney helped the band to play.  They've been going in and out of style but they're guaranteed to raise a smile.  So let me introduce to you the act you've known for all these years: Paul McCartney's Lonely Hearts Club Band!""",1267488000,2,807,4.418918918918919
2628164,3,B000H5U5V2,"I could only sit through half of this video.  I couldn't take the too frequent video of his adoring (I should say worshipping) fans in the crowd hanging all over each and crying anymore.  I was getting a toothache from all the ""sweets"".

In addition, and despite the constant reminders from members of the band and crew and Paul himself of what an ""average guy"" he is, the often and awful worship comments of McCartney, his music and his legend was sickening.  Enough with ALL the ""US"" business, I got the idea after the first 2 or 3 explanations of it.  Erect a monument to him and be done with it.  I was getting the feeling that he is the 2nd Coming.

That his music could close the generation gap and fix dysfunctional families is a huge stretch of the imagination.  If people are expecting that to happen, and to last, they are delusional at best.

AND what's up with the scene of a family from Michigan getting ready to go to the local concert, give me a break!  Like I could care about the opinions of ""loyal, dedicated"" fans preparing to go to his concert.  ""aside from my family and religion he (McCartney) has been the greatest influence on my life"" one guy says.  Another cloying instance of McCartney worship.  Get a life buddy!

I almost forgot to mention (as others have) the video editing is horrible.  From the jumping around from camera angle to camera angle you could never watch the ""band"" perform.  It is also annoying that they have to cut to McCartney or a roadie or a technician or some other ""follower"" spouting accolades in between almost EVERY song!  LET'S JUST SEE THE CONCERT FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!

As far as the music goes, it is too polished, too ""perfect"", since it is drilled into us what a perfectionist McCartney is.  The band is good and Paul doesn't sound bad for a 63 year old.  I give this a VERY tentative '***' only because I like the music but if that was all I wanted I would have purchased the CD instead.",1267056000,3,1947,4.415730337078652

2628167,4,B000H5U5V2,"...I'm in agreement that Paul should, for just one his DVD's, give the viewer an opportunity to see the concert only, similar to the ""Concert for George"" format, and another disc for the FULL film with interviews, family outings to the concert, space shuttle, etc.  I just keep the remote handy to skip all the non-concert stuff, which is every other channel, fortunately. That seems to work for me, but I souldn't HAVE to do that sort of thing while trying to watch a full concert video.

I do have to say, though, that Paul's voice is in top form, as is the band.  It's pretty much as good as it get's for a man in his 60's! I've watched ""earlier"" concert footage were Paul didn't sound as good as he does here, which was a very pleasant surprise. There's NOTHING worse than hearing an older performer who is just a shadow of their former selves. This, fortunately, is not the case here with Paul. This concert is also far superior to the USSR tour DVD on all levels. The set list is also GREAT, with Paul covering ALL of his career, most noticeably including a few ""new"" Beatles gems that I've not heard in his previous concerts.

The part that really kills me is that I had tickets to see this tour, but was deathly ill, so I had to sell them to a friend :-( At least I know that I missed an incredible opportunity to see a GREAT concert (minus all the unnecessary video) that's now been captured on this DVD.",1263600000,,1413,4.340909090909091
2628168,4,B000H5U5V2,"The concert portion of this docu-concert provides an excellent perspective on what Sir Paul can do on stage in his sixties. I found a great deal of the documentary which intertwines with the concert, often discomfiting and sometimes terribly embarrassing. The man's achievements in the public arena speak loud enough for most people to make a judgment of his worth; to spend such a disproportionate share of time offering evidence that Sir Paul is really another Saint Paul is quite offensive. Why former American President Clinton lent himself to the proceedings puzzles me. By the way,  none of what I say, should be taken as any criticism of the life or work of Paul McCartney;  I know nothing of the former and the latter is open to everyone's own consideration..
Putting that grievance aside, I would commend the concert segment to everyone who has seen at least the first two Beatle films.  This concert well represents the performer, then on the cusp of the old age into which he has now entered.

A particularly egregious example of sophomoric editing is seen during Eleanor Rigby, when the stage is superimposed on endless faces from the audience, presumably ""all the lonely people"".

Every song is followed by interviews with people (some famous, like Bill Clinton, Steve Jobs, and others less so) who endlessly mouth platitudes about how great Paul McCartney is.

When the focus is on making a DVD, the live performance suffers. They can edit out all the awkward pauses and unnecessary set changes, but the audience still has to endure them. I felt it should have been billed as a 'live studio recording' and I should not have been charged $100.

A lot of the excessive sentimentality that other reviewers refer to was present at the concert as well, including a long, boring retrospective at the beginning. People also refer to many of the shots of exalted fans...if they showed me, you'd see a bored, annoyed person. I looked around the audience that night, and although there was some true enthusiasm, the overall feel was not that up. Paul kept repeatedly trying to whip people into a frenzy...""how're you doing tonight"" in a very ineffective and superficial way. Shots of fans actually having a great time I'm sure were carefully selected.

But even if the DVD came out well (haven't actually seen it - don't want to), the performances were spot on, but nothing more than that. The band impressed me more than Paul. The Beatles songs almost completely lacked their original charm and feel, and Paul seemed much more concerned with his own glorification than with working to accurately bring to life the music and mood of a few decades ago.

This disc does NOT have Dolby Digital or any lossless multi-channel tracks, although it has stereo PCM that can be sent over legacy digital connections, which an A/V receiver or pre/pro can still convert to Dolby Pro-logic or other DSP to simulate a multi-channel ambience, which is not the same as Dolby Digital (or DTS) from the disc though.

A similar case is the Elton John's 60 Blu-ray, the content provider has chosen to only include PCM tracks.

The performance was very nice and Paul's band made a good representation of the original cords/songs, which is what I wanted to hear live from the original songwriter.

The quality of the video was good, however, the director seemed to have the objective of showing the audience and their reactions at almost every other cord, which was a bit too distracting to me.  I would have preferred that the camera would stop doing the many shifts between audience and stage, and stayed still a bit longer to show Paul and the band performing, as one would experience at the actual event.

What you have here is history. Paul McCartney and John Lennon are the two greatest composers/writers of the last century.
This is a chance to see one of the Masters displaying why he is so popular and fameous.
Paul opens the show with Hello, Goodbye and it just goes uphill from there.
Another thing that was cool was how he ended a song with Foxy Lady, the old Jimi Hendrix tune.
He does Beatles classics like Got to get you into my life and Penny Lane, among others.
To me the hightlight of the show was when he did Jenny Wren  and English Tea for the current album.

Furthermore, how could anyone on the production team have agreed to even list LET IT BE as one of the cuts on this DVD, when it is NOT included in its entire UNADULTERATED form?!

2628220,2,B000H5U5V2,"I saw this show live and it was even better than his 2002 outing, which was also a great concert.  Paul's band became a lot tighter - and more rocking - in the three years between the 'Back in the U.S.' tour and the so-called 'US' tour.  Both shows had excellent set lists, but '05 benefited from a tremendously better new album to promote.  He may not have done many new songs on either tour, but I'd much rather hear stuff from ""Chaos"" than ""Driving Rain.""  Also, Paul's chattiness during the concert continued from '02 - he told lots of a great stories before many songs, something nearly absent from his last round of big stadium shows ('89/90 and '93).

Sadly, the producers of ""The Space Within US"" commit the same errors as those responsible for ""Back In the U.S.""

The hyperactive editing is truly staggering...in the worst sense of the word.  Why would anyone want to see so much of the audience?  The best concert movies minimize audience shots, sometimes it feels like in any given song the audience is show at least as much as Paul and the band.  When Paul IS shown, the camera is usually quite distant and moving all over the place.

I do have an idea about what these editorial choices are made.  Paul McCartney is not a very visually dynamic performer.  By no means do I mean anything against his musicianship or his vocals.  Just from a purely visual aspect, he really isn't very interesting to watch.  That said, I WOULD rather watch him and his bandmates instead of the audience - but I mention the lack of visual presence as a possible reasoning behind the ridiculous camera-work and editing.

I have no such idea about why (why? Why??? WHY??!!) these McCartney concert DVDs always interrupt the flow of the concert with inane interview clips.  As voiced by so many fans, it's safe to say many of us would love to just have a tastefully (read: simply) staged presentation of an entire complete concert.  It doesn't have to be  *the same* concert, if it's a composite of the best parts of numerous shows just edit it together in a way that preserves the flow and feel of the concert.  It's been said a ton of times:  the behind-the-scenes stuff and all the ego-boosting testimonials can be saved for the special features.

So far only one McCartney live DVD delivers the performance in such a straight-forward manner:  ""Live at the Cavern Club.""  Of course, that was a less-than-an-hour long one-off concert that featured mostly non-original material.  But at least it didn't interrupt the show with nonsense.  It would be nice to see that kind of presentation for his next big arena tour.

The special features are not all that special.  I liked the soundcheck performances best - especially two excellent versions of songs from ""Chaos and Creation"" that weren't featured in the main concert (""Friends To Go"" and ""How Kind of You"").",1195430400,9,2851,4.672690763052209

However, after the fourth song, I had to take the DVD out and get rid of it.  The problem is, for every 3 minute song, there is maybe 1.5 minutes of the band.  The rest is many quick shots of the audience.  Grey-hairs trying to dance like the old days (and looking very sad I must say), lovers serenading each other while mouthing the song's words, 50+ year old saggy women dressed like skanks, 2-year olds air-drumming, young women crying,and even some guy head-banging during a mellow song (he must have had headphones playing Metallica).  Literally, every few seconds there is a shot of the audience, and the shots are so quick, it gives you a headache.  In 10 seconds you probably see 15 different people.  I'd much rather see Paul's actual concert than the audience shots which will make you gag.  Besides that, after each song there are a couple minutes of documentary and interviews with such Beatle experts as Bill Clinton.(??)  So even if you close your eyes and finally get into the song, it suddenly screeches to a halt and you have the 2-minute documentary.  Then another song starts....you get the picture.  It's a shame. They could have at least had all the documentary footage saved in an Extras file, or at least have a choice to watch the concert only (without audience footage).",1175040000,20,1444,4.623529411764705

He is truly the most awesome performer out there. This DVD dosent show that.

I know Pauls fans mean alot to him, but I don't need or want to see them.

I wish Paul would read these comments and put out a true concert DVD. A word

of advise, go to Ebay and get the bootleg of Paul min Madrid Spain. Its

all Paul and band Rockin out with no stupid audience shots. Also get Rockshow

from Wings in 76.",1174867200,3,604,4.033613445378151

However that does not detract me from giving it a 4 star rating. The energy levels at this Mccartney concert seems really high and the crowd are having the time of their lives. As for the commentaries, if you don't like them just skip to the next track (thats what I do!). Paul and the band deliver superb performances (29 songs) running through lotsa Beatles material, some Wings and some Chaos and Creation stuff. In fact repeated viewings of this DVD has left me humming 'English Tea', 'Jenny Wren' and 'Fine Line' more than anything. Excellent new album, Sir Paul - keep it up!!

What would have made this DVD package even more attractive was to offer the complete concert and the concert film as separate features. Keep the film just the way it is but for the concert, give us a  'Concert for George' like stage focused set. That would have got it 5 stars from all!

I had purchased the 2001:Back in the US DVD on release.......this 2005 tour DVD gives me lots of new live material (Helter Skelter, Get Back, I Will, Too Many People, Fixing a Hole, Got to get you into my life, Till there was you, For No One, I've got a Felling, etc.), live Chaos and a look at the band's evolution over last 4 years.

2628261,4,B000H5U5V2,"I agree with most reviewers that McCartney, Inc. seems to spend way too much time on fawning audience shots in his concert flicks, but this time, though there is still quite a bit of that, I found it less irritating.  There is more focus on the stage this time around, and the interviews with insiders are good.  The tour was entitled ""The Space Within Us"" and the focus was on the community of like-minded people who get together to enjoy the music--in some cases, three generations of a family.  So the focus of the tour helps diffuse some of the criticism about the attention paid to the audience.  Segments on Macca-obsessed fan families preparing to go watch the concert were unsettling and perhaps unintentionally self-serving.  Macca wants to be viewed as an ordinary guy, but then in his DVD, people talk of him as some kind of god.  I'm not sure if that sends the message he was trying to convey or contradicts it.

McCartney's band is made up of talented musicians who manage to stay in the background while putting out sounds surprisingly Beatle-like, though no one can duplicate George Harrison's guitar or Lennon's voice.

2628263,5,B000H5U5V2,"Just about ever major Paul McCartney tour since 1989 his had a dvd, cd or both released to commemorate it. All of these products have been excellent reminders of Paul's boundless energy and love for his audience.

The lateest offering, 2005's concert dvd ""The Space Within Us"", is no exception. Filmed over various stops on Paul's 2005 American tour, in which Paul performed a record breaking show broadcast via satellite to two astronatus orbiting out solar system.

The performances are top notch. I must say, the set list is the most differnt from other dvds (which is a very good thing). Concert favorites such as ""Band On The Run"", ""Jet"", ""Live And Let Die"" and others have been omitted for lesserr heard tracks such as ""I'll Get You"", ""I Will"", ""I've Got A Feeling"", and ""Please Please Me"". It's a thrill to finally here these songs in a live venue, and while you definitely miss some of the regulars I just mentioned, you wouldn;t trade these performances in for the world.

The interviews, even when they interrupt the songs, are very insightful and informative, and don't take away from the viewers' enjoyment in any way. Paul greets his fans, chats it up with his crew as well as celebs, and overall shows the Paul we all know and love.

This is another excelletn concert dvd from the one and only Sir Paul McCartney. I recommend this dvd to all fans of Sir Paul and The Beatles.",1169424000,5,1389,4.634146341463414

AND for him (and his incredible band!) to be so damn good on top of that was truly a once in a lifetime experience!  I didn't think it possible, but I thinked I liked him even more AFTER the concert!  I already had the DVD ""Paul McCartney - Live in Red Square"" and since it was the same band, it helped keep the memory of the best concert I had ever seen fresher (and I've seen all the old classic bands of that era practically!) with many of the same songs too.  It might be a bit redundant to that DVD but since I had actually gone to the concert THIS DVD was based on, it was even better for me and I'm not at all sorry I have both!

I was awed not only by the performance but the varied selection of song choices. There were so many great songs that I did not expect to hear.

If you had the oppurtunity to see Sir Paul- this DVD will likely invoke the thrill of the live performance. If you haven't seen him live, this DVD may stir you to do so at all costs whenever he makes his way back out on the road.

My only issue is that the omission of the closure of the the concert, the fitting 'The End' is a glaring one. The faliure to include the moment in the DVD is downright criminal.",1168819200,,722,4.18705035971223

I was extremely disappointed in that there was less of Paul and more of the concert goers, backstage scenes, interviews with people I really didn't care to listen to (ESPECIALLY 3 of Bill Clinton).

2628315,5,B000H5U5V2,"You get spoiled watching McCartney concert DVDs. You forget how extraordinary they are and start picking at the little things. For yes, they are not perfect. Four and a half stars would be the appropriate rating. How many times do you want to see McCartney visit a fan's house? BORING. Paul, we know you have the common touch, now spare us.
The music, though remains sublime. It's hard not to be impressed by the variety and quality of songs and the equal variety of instruments played (effortlessly) by Sir Paul.
Sad to say, but since Linda's been gone, it's easier to take Paul seriously (for the many who allowed Linda to be a distraction).
Without the boyish looks and without Linda, it's just about the music and the performance.
Naturally, all the band members multi-task. This has been true of all of Paul's bands. If you close your eyes, you'd think there were many more people on stage.
The concert is long - as are all McCartney's concerts. You're not getting cheated.
Unless you've never seen a McCartney concert, you could do away with the standard songs trotted out at every concert (e.g. Let it Be, Band on the Run, Jets, Live and Let Die). [Yes they do sound good, and yes McC. has to cater to those seeing him for the first time]
On the other hand, you'll never see another live version of For No One, Fixing a Hole, I Will, I'll Get You, Please Please Me + Chaos and Creation songs, and that if nothing else is worth the price of admission.
I consider Follow Me to be a clunker, and that's the only musical weak spot in the show. On the other hand, I'll Follow the Sun is a nice little surprise (well, not for you now that I've told you).
If you have no interest in seeing today's Mozart at work, skip this DVD. Otherwise you can't go wrong.",1168387200,3,1758,4.429012345679013

2628317,5,B000H5U5V2,"Delivery was on time and the product was well worth the purchase.  As a long time Beatles fan, I grew up playing guitar and loving and living the progress of the Beatles.  But I never saw a decent video of the four in concert and to this day believe that there must be better material than the short scenes at Shay Stadium.  So even though this DVD is just Paul, he covers a wide range of material.  It has wonderful audience coverage.

I came away with a funny feeling.  In reflection I felt that parts of it were definitely pure promotion for Paul.... sort of like hearing the anouncer saying ""Paul McCartney is a genius"" then realizing that it is Paul McCartney that is putting this all together via his approval.  So there is a hint of a question: Is this a promotion for Paul McCartney or a fly on the wall view of a concert tour.  My conclusion is that it is neither.  Paul is clearly an extremely talented person.  As a song writer and guitarist (with none of the success of Paul though) I understand at least a tip of the iceberg and feel that it is more of a celebration of Paul's many talents as songwriter and performer that anything else.  So it is okay to me if some Phd at a state college says he is like Bach or Beethoven.  That turns many who are classical music freaks and I just take it as a very loose statement.  There is a wide difference between the two types of music and the same goes for Jazz but IN HIS FIELD... it is I can easily accept that about Paul and a few other rock personalities.  Lennon's differences became much clearer after the Beatles breakup.  Paul was and still is the audience pleaser while Lennon's anger and harsh drive came out with Ono and with how he chose to display himself to the world.  We would never see a large and happy concert with Lennon but that is exactly what Lennon would turn his nose up at and I feel Paul's love for the glory and large happy audiences also made Lennon turn his nose up.  He was more the Greenpeace of rock with a strong message and a drive to get our attention first by the very way he presented his message.

I say the above because as a music lover I selfishly would love to have hear Paul and John together after the breakup doing a compromise of grand presentation and with some of the music carrying John's message of love and frustration at this world.  But then there is George who finally had a chance to show his considerable talents after the breakup.  What a chance coming together of such talents.

I do not know if George ever did a concert solely or only showed up here and there with others for a couple of songs.

Like the first review states... if they kept the camera on the band..... and left out all the comments... it'd be a nice product.

But this is a ""dig-me"" DVD about Paul McCartney. The music is good... just wish you had the option to turn the comments off.

He really dug deep into his vast musical catalogue for this tour.  It was a real treat to see him perform ""I'll Get You,"" ""I'll Follow The Sun,"" and other rarely played Beatles songs.  Of course you get some of the standard McCartney stuff too, but the new additions to the setlist are very welcome.

Now do beware, if you are looking for a straight concert film, you will not find it here.  After every song on this DVD comes behind the scenes footage and interviews with various people.  The songs are also out of order.  It doesn't really bother me, though, I just use the skip button to get to the songs.

I mean... there is a flippin' ""Musical Therapist"" professor from some bastion of liberalism there on the Left coast constantly in the clips between songs.  Musical Therapist?  WTH is that?  Still this is a SPECTACULAR concert movie.  Regardless of your political affiliation... it's Paul freakin' McCartney for Pete's sake!  He was incredible in concert!  And this DVD catches the raw emotion and power of that concert experience.  My favorite song from the concert (Live And Let Die) didnt's make the DVD which was a little disappointing.  The pyro and lights for that song were just incredible!  The DVD contains several extras that only happened in Anehiem California (where the concert was shot for this DVD, though crowd scenes from the entire tour make the cut), and those extras may have replaced Live and Let Die in the rotation.  Still, Beatles fans in general and McCartney fans in particular will love this DVD.  The Movie really hammers home the multi generational appeal of McCartney, and rightfully so.

Pure music with no audience distraction.

I can't find this on DVD. There is way too much audience footage in this latest video.

The best part was the sound checks where there was no audience. I think it's pretty much

understood how important the Beatles were and what a tremendous songerwriter Paul is.

I don't need to see little kids and old men crying while lip syching to his songs to confirm this.

I'm surprised Paul allows this to happen. I don't think Lennon or Harrison would carry on like this.

For me, the crowd shots were a part of the experience. He may enjoy it as much as we do. The quality of audio and visual is exceptional and I liked the material in between the songs.

The mix between Paul McCartney and band at their best, the interviews that provide some insight into Paul McCartney and the unfathomable impact that the music of the Beatles had in the 1960s and 1970s when I was in my teens, and in a very real sense ever since has a powerful effect.

It is spectacular to see the multiple generations attending Paul's concerts and singing his songs. It is equally riveting to see the famous faces in the audience singing and grooving to Pauls' songs.

2628355,2,B000H5U5V2,"One reviewer wrote don't be put off by the bad reviews.  I did read a bad review mainly about the overuse of footage of the audience but after having seen and bought Paul's fantastic set on Live 8 and with the inclusion of so many Beatle tracks on this new disc, I decided to chance it and buy the Space Within Us sight unseen.  Every critical review on Amazon is justified.  What should have been included on the dvd as was done with the Concert For George and other music dvd's I have was the  documentary with concert footage plus an uncut, entire concert.  Paul is in fine voice, the band is fabulous and the sound quality is top quality on surround sound. The constant inclusion of fans in the audience is just over the top, annoying and frustrating especially the abundance of lip syncing.  I want to see Paul sing the songs.  I've been a fan of Paul's for over 40 years and am still waiting for the Wings Rockshow to be officially released on dvd.  I haven't bought any of his concerts in between this and the new dvd because there hasn't been a definitive concert available.  Yes, Paul should take heed from other performers as one reviewer wrote - such as the Moody Blues - pan to the audience but only minimally and give us a show to make us feel we were really there, not outside looking in for a brief moment here, there and everywhere.  The next time I play the Space Within Us, I won't turn on the vision, I'll just play the music.

I am biased because I have seen him in concert and it is really an experience.  I don't mind the interviews and the audience footage, I think it's fun.

I think I could make two recommendations though:  Why doesn't Paul release more audio CD's of his recordings?  That would be even more of a bonus for us fans.  Back in the US was a success and I think Red Square and this one need audio companions.  One other thought:  MORE WINGS stuff next time.

William, as I refer to him, is likely more talented than the original James Paul McCartney. He did a phenomenal job on the first two albums of his solo career, that being after Theodor Ludwig Adorno Weisengrund passed away and the Beatles having passed with him, ending in the break up. At this point, the majority of people see William Shepherd's face and it registers as Paul McCartney. That's okay, if you don't care about truth and justice.

The band is utterly fantastic, Paul is genuinely relaxed onstage (watching how he takes the guitar lead on the ""Foxey Lady"" riff early on is SO refreshing), and the tunes are out of this world.  He's working with the greatest band he has assembled in the post-Beatles era, he's coming off a string of superlative albums...and he puts out yet another dvd chock full of soul-crushingly sycophantic messiah-worship that is every bit as ham-fisted as his best work is nuanced.  I agree that it is a deep-seated insecurity, and not an excess of arrogance (as it was with John Lennon),  that drives him to put out this infomercial-eque drivel.  There is a huge minority of McCartney fans out there that despises the hollow theatrics and redundant myth-making, and it's a shame to think that he still feels called upon to constantly succumb to shark-eyed mass adulation.",1165968000,,912,4.896103896103896

Amazingly, Paul is at the top of his game considering his age.  He

can't hit all the high notes, but he does a great job nonetheless.

Dressed alike, all in black a la the early Beatles is a nice touch.

A better selection of Beatles/Wings/McCartney I couldn't have asked

for.  Best bits: For No One, I'll Follow The Sun, Fixing a Hole, I've

Got a Feeling, Helter Skelter and Jenny Wren.

Dislikes:

Too much camera movement and way too many quick shots.  Lock it down

on a tripod and leave it alone!

If you're going to show crowd shots (and there are far too many) don't

show me Billy Joel, John Cusak and Jack Nicholson.  That tells me that tickets weren't available for real people, only

millionaires.

I loathed the documentary/behind-the-scenes stuff between songs.  This

alone ruins the disc.  While interesting and informative, it should have

been provided in the supplementary section and not edited into the

performance.  A concert-only edit should have been included on a second

I agree Red Square is an incredible disc, but there are some great performances here. First, Too Many People/She Came In Through the Bathroom Window is sublime! What great syncronicity within the band from the spot on backing vocals, the incredible lead fills, to Paul's voice.  Stellar!  Other's of notable mention, a powerful Helter Skelter...And what a great dig up of a lost artifact, I'll Get You! Whew what a blast from the past.

2628376,4,B000H5U5V2,"I want to address the problem of excessive audience footage, since it seems to be the most consistently important theme in the reviews of this film. First of all, I didn't find it nearly as distracting as reviewers prepared me for. For one thing, counter to expectations, all songs (I think - maybe there's an exception or two but I didn't notice.) are presented in their entirety. But yes, there's a lot of ""Us.""

Why? Because of Paul's ""ego?"" Well, YEAH! Is there a surprise there? Has Paul McCartney's narcissism been painstakingly kept under wraps until now? (""NEW EX-BEATLE DOCUMENTARY EXPOSES FORMER MOP TOP'S BIG HEAD!"") My own feeling is that he likes to disguise his need for approval (and adoration) with a faux-egalitarian presentation, like, ""You guys are really just as important as I am!"" In reality, it's more like ""Look at how much everybody loves me!""

How about this - Would it have been possible for the Beatles to have been as big as they were for all these years and not have immense egos? Can you even truly imagine how bizarre and extraordinarily bewildering it must have been to be a Beatle? As Paul himself says at some point during the film, you're not just what you think you are anymore; you're also what they think you are.

And why would this issue be important anyway? If you think his ego is too big, don't become his friend. Just listen to his music, which is among the most memorable and consistently charming of the 20th Century.

On this DVD, McCartney delivers big-time when it comes to the music. The rockers rock relentlessly; the ballads are gorgeous and heartfelt and the scope and depth of the material is simply astounding. Like all the famous (and not famous) people tell you throughout the movie, he's really, really big. And he's in his mid-sixties, so the whole Lifetime Achievement thing is beginning to take center stage. As an artist ages, we tend to fall more deeply in love with him - or at least our loyalty begins to obscure our more discerning judgment, particularly if he's part of the soundtrack of our own aging. Maybe he's become a really comfortable old shirt - we've had him around so long he just feels good being there.

I don't think I've ever seen one of the old-style McCartney concerts before he had returned to the Beatle stuff. Since he's been reclaimed his glorious past, however,(which he'd be an absolute fool to resist) I find his concerts thrilling. I loved the Beatles as an adolescent when they were actually releasing their new material, and I'm so grateful to have some of that wonderful energy still being put into the air. The camera sometimes lingers too long on the audience? So what?!",1164758400,6,2667,4.69017094017094

2628378,4,B000H5U5V2,"Paul has issued official concert films for every tour since '76 and he always makes the same mistake: too many audience shots, not enough Macca. One would have thought he'd have listened to the crescendo of complaints about the '89, '93 and 2002 concert DVD's which abound with audience shots. Enough already! I was praying Macca would finally issue a film in the style of ""The Concert for George"" in 2003 which kept the camera firmly fixed where it belongs: on the stage, not focused in on various besotted stars/oldsters/teeny boppers/silicone implanted audience members.

I was fortunate to have seen the 2005 McCartney concert in six different venues and no movie can possibly convey the emotional impact this man has when you see him in person. I've never taken heroin, but that might be the only thing on earth (besides one other...) that packs a bigger wallop than seeing McCartney singing songs that have formed the tapestry of your life. Being in the 4th row and looking into Paul's eyes when he sings Yesterday is living large, to put it mildly.

I was irritated that the DVD omits many songs from the tour, including Band on the Run, Jet, and In Spite of All the Danger. They also edit Let it Be and Hey Jude and inexplicably omit Paul's banter between songs.  The fawning interviews which gush over Paul's brilliance are unnecessary and gratuitous. Yes, he's a God, but he's not Bach or Mozart, as one professor claims with an apparently straight face. There are also two hideously boring scenes of fan's homes where they predictably bring out the Beatles bobbing head dolls and bubblegum cards. They cut out Band on the Run for this drivel? Who is editing this stuff?

One final pleasing aspect is the complete omission of Heather Mills McCartney who no Paul fan wants to see or be reminded of. Thank God this troll is history.

All in all, you'll enjoy it to the hilt if you love Paul, especially if you saw the concert live. But you'll still wonder why in the world he insists on the audience shots which are extremely tiresome by now. But Paul's music overrides everything else, as it has since he was a teenager in Forthlin Road, writing his seminal music with a nearsighted Teddy Boy named John.

2628379,3,B000H5U5V2,"Note to self: when preparing to enter costly divorce, do not have Bill Clinton, Alec Baldwin and Billy Joel extol your virtues on film.

Make no mistake, the music on this DVD is terrific. This is the best band McCartney has worked with since, well, you know.... The trouble with this DVD is that the music is constantly interupted by talking heads gushing over McCartney's well established virtues of being the genuine article who loves to go to work each day and do his job. He was raised that way. It shows, and he's very sincere about that value in his life. I admire him for it. I've seen it loads of times in big and small moments. I don't need to keep seeing it. Message received. Over and out.

In this particular film the intrusions are too much. Carrie Underwood seems to suggest a very private moment has brought her to tears. God bless Macca if it's true, but you don't need that right now either. I loved the performances in the film - it's what Paul does, and it's great. The rest comes off as displaying an insecurity that I hadn't really noticed before. As though he needed to hear how much fans and celebrities thought of him, which is a different angle than previous efforts where he explained his work ethic as a devotion to his fans, the subtext of his looming divorce must have knackered him inside in his guts. He even looks a little edgier at times, which could be the result of dealing with tabloid stories. At first I thought all the testimonials were way too ego-driven, but when you think about why that might be so, the underlying cause is some severe insecurity threatening his sense of self. This is not as self-destructive as Crosby's meltdown in DAYLIGHT AGAIN, but still you see the cracks where they never were before. Post Beatles, pre-Wings, McCartney was retreating to Scotland. What ravages that wrought he put into LIVERPOOL ORATORIO. Now it's all out front and I'm sure he takes a lot of the tabloid fueled speculation personally, as must Mills. Hard to keep your dignity. Thus, with your concert film, you get this salving of the fragile parts.

I don't know what else to do other than copy this disc and edit out Clinton et al in order to enjoy what seems in starts and stops to be a great concert. Wishing Paul and his family the best, inspite of all this, I would also hope that he finds solace in doing what he does best and in the comfort of his children.

2628380,4,B000H5U5V2,"Most of Paul's fans already own ""Back In The U.S."" and ""Red Square"" I'm sure.  Many were disappointed by the so called ""Concert Film"" style.  This time it remains the same.  It seems Paul is more firm on this than the switching credit of McCartney/Lennon.  So forget about it and let's see what else to be expected this time.  Here are the top 6 of what I like.

1) Picture quality.  As claimed on the cover that it's shot by hi-def cameras, it shows clearly that this DVD is much superior than the previous 2.

2) Songs never performed live before.  We all love that part.  Even those from Chaos are nice too.

3) 5.1 surround sound of ""Drive My Car"".  With audience clapping along the beat around you, it's almost like being there ""in the flesh""!

4) Spotting celebs within the audience, some were also in ""Back"" DVD.

5) Where's Heather?  It's fun just to check if she ever appeared somewhere in this DVD.  But you wil definitely find her during bonus.

6)  ""Too Many People"".  Just wonder why Paul is so ashamed by solo materials that he performed so little of this period.  This one he nearly delivered vocal as we heard originally.  And then it followed nicely (like medley) by She Came In Through The Bathroom Window (not listed on cover).  Great discovery!

What I don't quite like?  This time too many audience members pouring tears.  Last time in ""Back"", one or two were quite moving.  Now the camera crew tried to spot a lot more of them and it became ""same old scene"".  Also too many guests praised Paul of his great achievement.  His genius is never a doubt but struggling this much is necessary?  Already 3 DVDs trying to convey the same message.  We all know you're great so next time give us just the music please.",1164585600,2,1730,4.451923076923077
2628381,3,B000H5U5V2,"Four years, five tours, three live DVDs -- that Paul McCartney sure has been one  busy ex-Beatle since he began touring again in 2002, following a nine-year hiatus. Though tickled that Sir Paul has been back with a vegeance, frustrated fans have griped in four-part harmonies over the shortcomings of his video releases: jumpy camera angles, a seeming obsession with showing concert-goers singing 50 percent of the songs and behind-the-scenes footage interrupting nearly every song. Little changes on ""The Space Within US.""

To be fair, ""US"" does have a lot going for it. The hi-defintion clarity of the footage is the best of any of Sir Paul's video releases. The song list is chock-full of gems that have never been performed live in the U.S. -- ""She Came in Through the Bathroom Window,"" ""For No One,"" ""Helter Skelter,"" ""I've Got a Feeling"" to name a few -- as well as a host of early Beatles numbers that haven't been dusted off in 30-odd years.  And Macca's youthful band continues to keep him rocking like a guy half his age.

But there are, of course, a few sour notes. From the opening lines of ""Magical Mystery Tour,"" the fans -- aging boomers, twentysomethings and even little tykes -- hog a serious amount of face time instead of the performers themselves. Additional footage is wasted on a who's who's montage of celebs rubbing elbows with Sir Paul, including Bono, Jay-Z, Faith Hill, Chris Tucker (?!) and Tony Bennett. These were understandable missteps on the first in the recent slew of DVD releases, ""Back in the U.S."" Now it's plain annoying.

An endless array of commentators are also rounded up to gush over how special Sir Paul is, and how his music can transcend time, space and the theory of relativity.  The problem? No one questions Macca's place in music history. The Beatles are now and forever the toppermost of the poppermost, and the ""Cute One"" continues to thrive, selling out stadiums and earning Grammy nominations.  But instead of treating his fans to a sonic and visual pleasure -- like the straightforward ""Concert for George"" -- Macca just can't let it be.",1164412800,3,2093,4.813370473537605

On the way into the pavillion Paul rolled down his window, popped out, and gave a peace sign.  For brief moment in time we made eye contact with this most famous and recognizable person and it was a perfect lift off for the rest of the evening.  I agree with others regarding this DVD issue, it would be nice to have just concert footage here but you know, after playing these concert films a few times you tend to scene jump anyway, so it really doesn't make a difference.

2628384,3,B000H5U5V2,"I have come to the conclusion that Paul has a self esteem problem. The DVD is loaded with the likes of Bill Clinton, Steve Jobs, Cameron Crow and some so called experts (one calls himself a ""music therapist""? what?) who continually tell us (for two hours) of the magnitude and importance of Paul McCartney's very existence. If you replaced Paul with Jesus, you could skip church on Sunday. There's something woefully off track when the DVD comes off as a self delusional documentary with the music almost as filler. All you hear is what an inspiration he is, what a great guy he is, what an ""average"" guy he is, his work is actually ""divine intervention"", etc. In my opinion, Paul has set a calculated course to absorb as much of the Beatles existence as he possibly can. No doubt he was a huge contributor to the Beatles but watching this DVD it as though John Lennon was nothing but a session musician and George and Ringo stage hands. In other words, Paul was the Beatles. I'm sorry, but his recent handful of DVDs have been going down this path with this one being the most self aggrandizing to date. If Paul really wants to tip his hat to his Beatle roots, then have Ringo play through some (if not all) of the Beatle songs. Plus I'm also tired of Rusty his guitar player botching the leads. It was painfully obvious he did not know the lead guitar ending to ""Too Many People"" which is blistering on the record but with Rusty relegating it to some on the fly, made up jumble of notes that ended up being an insult to a great song. And while I'm on the topic, someone please give that boy a copy of the song Let It Be so he can learn George's lead. That's another example where he continually misses the guitar work and there's absolutely no excuse for it. The songs are still great but Paul's approach of pumping up his own tires is growing very, very old and it does affect ones ability to enjoy the DVD. ** BnB Beatles Depot **",1164412800,5,1934,4.375

I really hope Paul goes on another tour and creates a better DVD, with less audience and more him and his band.

2628416,5,B000H5U5V2,"After having attended most of his tours since the ""Wings Over America"" in 1976 I recall, his shows have become pretty much an event. The complaints that this DVD shows too much audience and not enough Paul is technically true. However, the magical effect that his shows have on the audience seems to explain (at least to me) the reason why the producers of this DVD chose this approach. After literally hundreds of shows from different artists over the past 35+ years, McCartney is one of the few artists who can leave his audience in a rapturous glow after the show, which is truly palpable and sincere. The scenes of fans of all ages rejoicing at the shows is really what his shows are like so I fully agree with the DVD as it is presented. The sound quality is fabulous especially compared to some his previous concert DVDs. The interspersed thoughts from those famous and less so adds to the appeal. In short, if you like the Beatles (who doesn't?) or if you saw him live at one of these shows and want to relive the magic, or you weren't lucky enough to see him, I would add this to your collection.

The three generational family attending and meeting Paul saga was a 10 on the douche chills meter.  When I go to a concert I'm looking at the stage not at the people around me.  Keep the crowd shots to in-between songs.

At various points in this DVD the talking heads say how important the audiences are to the show.  This is not a Deadhead crowd.  There is no need to average over 20 audeince shots per song (and that's with some songs running only a couple of minutes)!!  The The highlight of the DVD is in the Extras.  Save your money and buy one of the many other Paul concert DVDs that are out there.",1163980800,18,997,4.157068062827225

My sister and her daughter were shown two different times! They were holding up a sign that said Paul You Make Us So Happy! My daughter and I were one row behind them. I get shivers up and down my spine and relive the whole experience by watching the concert film again. Just imagine out of all the fans that attended the concerts that my family would be included in the dvd!!!!!,1163894400,,507,4.462365591397849

Those on the fence who think they might like, it well let me put it this way. Much of this was filmed in Madision Square on one of those nights you could feel in the air you are lucky to be there. This guys blows you away when you see him becasuse:  Those who are fans are blown away because he sounds exactly like you want and would image him to sound in concert. Those who have never seen him are blown away because they are suprised that he CAN BLOW YOU AWAY !

This guy is 63 years old here! Watch it and tell me if maybe you can understand a glimpse of why people went so crazy for the Beatles. 40 years later and he rocks shoulder to shoulder with the best doing it right now!

The lighting, the energy of the band and the crowd, suprising interviews!! and ole Paul looked pretty good for having passed the 64 year mark! After watching it I felt like I had been there. It is the best one I have seen yet! If you like McCartney, this is him at his best not to mention some great songs you will be surprised to hear!

2628423,5,B000H5U5V2,"I've been a major Beatles/Macca fan since 1967, and I've seen one show from every U.S. tour Paul has done except for the last one, so I was very pleased when I heard about this DVD. Unlike some fans, I actually enjoy the audience shots. It's great to see them enjoying the show as much as I do. I also like the backstage scenes, fan comments, etc. But, I wish they were located in the 'special features'section. It would be great if Paul's concert DVDs covered the entire concerts from beginning to end. But, we live in an imperfect world, don't we?<G> Here's the setlist from the DVD,,,,""Magical Mystery Tour""""Flaming Pie""""Let Me Roll It""""Drive My Car""""Till There Was You""""I'll Get You""""Eleanor Rigby""""Maybe I'm Amazed""""Got to Get You Into My Life""""Fine Line""""I Will""""I'll Follow The Sun""""Good Day Sunshine""""For No One""""Fixing A Hole""""Penny Lane""""Too Many People""""She Came in Thru The Bathroom  Window""""English Tea""""i've Got A Feeling""""Follow Me""""Jenny Wren""""Helter Skelter""""Yesterday""""Get Back""""Please Please Me"" At the conclusion of ""Let Me Roll It,"" the band launches into an instrumental version of Jimi Hendrix's ""Foxey Lady."" It's a pleasant surprise and lasts about 45 seconds or so.  I guess the highlights for me would be ""Please Please Me"" and ""Till There Was You."" Rusty's guitar work on the latter really makes the tune. The 'special features' include three tunes from the soundchecks. Paul does a neat cover of ""Whole Lot Of Shakin' Going On"" that would make Jerry Lee proud. The ten minute opening film from the tour is shown in its entirety and there are also a couple of other niceties thrown in for good measure. ""Helen Wheels"" provides the soundtrack for one of them, and the re-mastering is first rate. The DVD comes with a nice little booklet with photos and commentary. IMO, ""The Space Within Us"" is a 'must have' for Macca fans.  You get a lot of bang for your buck  with this DVD. The entire running time is approximately two and a half hours. Not a bad investment for 15 bucks! For those fans who don't care for the fan comments, backstage shots, etc, you can program your DVD player to play only the songs. This will give you almost 30 full-length tunes to enjoy.",1163635200,57,2189,4.8449197860962565

2628447,5,B000H5U5V2,"Paul McCartney is a living legend and ""The Space Within US"" celebrates the incredible music he created as a Beatle and a solo performer.  The DVD is beautifully presented with immaculate sound and exciting visual shots of the performance and the audience.  Put together, it creates an amazing snapshot of one of the most exhilerating concerts ever staged.

Although some reviews criticize the intermixing of audience shots, interviews, and snippits, the DVD is meant to be an account of the tour, not necessarily an ""in-concert"" video.  Taking the film for what it is, ""A Concert Film"" (as labeled on the cover), then ""The Space Within US"" is a wonderful piece of video and audio posterity.  McCartney definitely likes the format of the ""Back In The US"" DVD, since this new video follows the same path.  And for what it is, it works beautifully.

Having said that, a separate disc of a straight beginning-to-end concert would definitely be welcome at this point in the game.  McCartney DVDs make it a point to celebrate his importance and significance, and this new one is no exception.  Granted, he IS important and significant.  At the same time, a stand-alone full concert is long overdue.  ""In Red Square"" is the closet DVD so far to a full-on show.

Nonetheless, ""The Space Within US"" is an excellent addition to the McCartney DVD library and everyone should have a copy.  The song selection includes all the new ""old"" songs performed on the tour (with the exception of ""In Spite Of All The Danger""), as well as featuring the not-as-often performed gems like ""Good Day Sunshine"" and ""Penny Lane"".  I'll be watching this DVD for quite some time! (is there going to be a stand-alone CD of the concert?)",1163548800,2,1705,4.814432989690721
2628448,3,B000H5U5V2,"Amazon Rocks!!! My DVD was delivered the day of release!!!  Gotta love it!!!

But alas, rather disappointed in this one, Sir Paul.  I'm a fan from way back and saw this show in Tampa - the concert could have translated to DVD a lot better with more of the rockin' tunes and edited versions of the quieter tunes. ""Fixing A Hole"" - oy - could have been fixed a lot faster - the videographer didn't know where to go with this tune, so what did he do? - He went behind stage and showed some shots of the crew as Paul repeated another chorus.

""Jenny Wren"" falls flat and could have been replaced with ""Live and Let Die"" - loved the new pyro effects in the show and the exclusion of the ""Sgt. Pepper/The End"" medley was kind of a let down.

""English Tea"" may have been better nighty-night music for the astronauts who were waking up to this song.  The somersaults in weightlessness on the concert video screen rescued this ditty.

""Too Many People"" was a pleasant surprise along with other Wings rockers.  ""Helter Skelter"" was just plain fun to watch.  Looks like they had a hoot performing this one.

Love ya, Paul.  Your narration about the good in all of us is heartfelt and well received by this fan.  I'll still watch this one, but try a different format on the next product.",1163548800,4,1275,4.378723404255319

I LOVE to see the vast array of ages and ethnicities of people who have the same awesome reaction to the music we all love!  Paul's humor and the crowd are a big part of the reason I like to go to the concerts instead of just cranking up the stereo, and I think any DVD without these elements would do great injustice to the incredible experience of Paul live!  It is like nothing I've ever seen each time I see him, and I love seeing how many other people feel the same way.

If you have never owned a McCartney DVD try 'Back in the US' or 'In Red Square'. I've watched both several times, and will watch them again.

I was at the show at the Pond in Anaheim, GREAT SHOW! My family loved the new pyro in 'Live and Let Die'. It was awsome. Our favorite songs were 'Band on the Run' and 'Hey Jude'. Couldn't wait to see it all on the DVD. Between each song (and there were 35 that night!) Paul would give some insite into how he wrote the next song...or some little thing that made you feel lucky to be there. None of this is on this DVD.

I would love to have given this release five stars for spectacular video and sound quality and great insight into the concert and tour experience from the band as well as the audience.  (I did not agree with the other reviewer who did not appreciate the audience shots)  However, too much time was wasted following a rather fanatical family at home (yawn), in a hotel room and finally to the concert, meeting Paul McCartney himself backstage.  More irritating was too much commentary from college musical professors explaining why we are physiologically affected by Sir McCartney's music (double-yawn).  Too technical to be enjoyable.  I did love the pre-show video, covering the life and times of McCartney, from birth, childhood, Beatles, Wings, solo and musical collaborations, up to clips from 2005's Superbowl and Red Square spectacles. It's important to note that this is not so much a ""concert"" video (Like Eagles ""Hell Freezes Over"" or Fleetwood Mac's ""The Dance""), as it is a video which features concert footage. There are also plenty of celebrity statements and in-person-with-Paul meetings; presidential to rap-stars, more so than ""Back in the US.""

What I really wanted, I got. The performances of all of the songs that he hasn't played since he was with the Beatles, (Til There Was You, I'll Get You, For No One, I'll Follow the Sun, Please Please Me, She Came in Through the Bathroom Window). I'll Follow the Sun and Please Please Me are what I consider the highlights of the show.

There are now not many songs left from the Beatles catalogue that he has not performed live since he began touring in 1990. And I'm referring to the songs that he wrote.

If he tours again, I'd like to hear (The Night Before, She's A Woman, Another Girl, I Don't Want To Spoil The Party, Lovely Rita).",1163548800,,805,4.282894736842105

Sure on some slower songs the camera stays on Paul but on Please Please Me you've got a 2min. 9sec.song that features 26 shots of Paul and 40 crowd shots. Its as if the star of the show was making a cameo appearance in his own show. There are only two explanations. Either the director thinks the crowd response IS the show or else he thinks that Paul is just too old to be given much screen time. Either way everyone loses except of course for those fortunate fans who get their 1 second of fame in a Paul McCartney dvd.,1163462400,6,577,4.160714285714286
2628456,3,B000H5U5V2,"Someone wrote a comment that Paul should have played like he did on the magnificent Concert For George.

That is the issue about Paul. I certainly do not know him, but at lease musically, he seems to be the control freak of all time. He never challenges himself and never tours and plays with the great living musicians of our time, like you would see at Concert For George, or Clapton's live stuff.

I would love to see Paul do something, like the Band's  ""The Last Waltz"". Record something like George used to do, Ringo does, Clapton, Buddy Guy, Mark Knopfler, Chuck Berry (kind of old), etc, etc. heck all of the great musicians live for the endless growth of being stretched and playing with other great musicians.

Paul who sadly wouldn't tour or play live with George or any of the Beatles since. He never seems to grow as a musician which is so sad for fans as well as for Paul's incredible talent.

The best part of the DVD is the selection of Beatle songs. Interviews can be truly interesting , but as EXTRA'S, separated from concert footage, or listener selected as voice overs, like directors commentary.

Showing fan reactions is so trite and clinched. That is how concert DVDs USED to be and fortunately filming concerts has improved greatly. The audience shots are the music DVD's equivalent to a  ""taught track"" on a bad TV sitcom. But Paul would never let a true pro produce the DVD. Get Jeff Lynne (who did Concert for George, Mark Knopfler (great guitarist, producer, engineer, songwriter, etc). I am sure he could have his pick.

I love the Beatles so. I can tell you that the most exciting, emotional and fun ""Beatles"" show I have ever seen was from a unique cover group, ""1964, The Tribute. I cried, danced, sang, their great. What they do is do a live Beatle concert as a tribute from when The Beatles learned their craft from the beginning Hamburg, Germany days. They use the same Vox amps, Rickenbacker guitars, etc from and play the early Beatles songs with the energy of when The Beatles did play live. To hear those harmonies. I got to hear some songs I never heard before. It is like a dream of getting the energy of The Beatles live. The ""George"" guy was my favorite,. Outstanding musician. Saw them in a small theater in Boulder, Colorado and seeing an audience of three generations, rocking out, was a thrill.

I would see them again rather than pay the $300-$500 for a ticket to see McCartney and his pickup band members in a large sports stadium.",1163462400,3,2479,4.565315315315315

Sure the music sounds great and he plays many songs we haven't seen live before.  But the concert is directed with the same painfully annoying cutaways of the  audience as his last two concert films.  This time we get to see more fawning celebrities paying homage to Sir Paul and gee whiz, folks- interviews with real everyday folks crying and letting us know that Paul loves them.  I love the unintentional laugh and irony of the ""fan"" saying that underneath Paul is really a humble, everyday guy, you just have to look really hard!  Will McCartney's depthless insecurity ever be satisfied?

So far, Paul has dismantled the Soviet Union- and with this one, he claims to be saving family relationships through his music.  I feel good in a special way!

This way, you'd get a) the concert that you remember and b) the extras that only Paul can provide.  It doesn't seem that difficult, & real fans would pay the extra 5-10 bucks for the 2nd disc...

It's time for Paul to provide a bona fide concert video. ""The Space within Us"" is outright tedium, with very few actual shots of the band performing the songs. For the most part, the DVD consists of celebrities and pseudo-cultural theorists talking about McCartney's readily obvious impact upon world culture. And then there are the ceaseless images of fans in various states of ecstasy.

What we really want to see, Paul, is the concert itself. The rest is extraneous. And don't even get me started on the astronauts. . . .",1163462400,34,655,4.646551724137931

The problem is one that McCartney has been struggling with form many years, his voice is simply trashed for most of the performance.  Rather than hitting the high notes he ends up yelling / screaming in time with the music.

There are a few complete bummers too.  ""Flaming Pie"" has always been a nothing wink-wink nonsense song written to cash in on a famous Lennon expression.  New tracks like ""English Tea"", which is funnier than Spinal Tap's ""Cups and Cakes"", and ""Jenny Wren"" make you wonder when he stopped trying to write interesting music.

The bad news is that once again each shot of the band lasts only a couple of seconds. Would someone please send Paul a copy of ""The Concert for George"" ... or even one of Ringo's concert DVDs ... so he can see how these things should be done?

And once again, there are far too many audience shots and too many talking heads telling us how great Paul and his music are. We know, Paul, we know. That's why we're buying the DVD; we don't need to be constantly reminded of it.

Still, it sounds great in 5.1.

3 stars for the overall presentation; an extra half star for the near complete absence of Heather Mills. (You see her in some fleeting shots, sort of the same way Cynthia Lennon was glimpsed in the background of The Beatles First US Visit footage). Also, I wonder how much influence she had in Linda McCartney being almost totally absent from the Wings footage shown prior to each concert?

What we got on this dvd is terific! I enjoyed the special features particulerly the sound checks from San Jose.

Anyway, it just shows what a wonderful man Paul is and how he can make a stadium full of people feel like hanging out in your living room.  He is so down-to-earth and absolutely made Ben's day.

There were way way too many shots of the audience and the constant changing of camera angles was very annoying. I was looking forward to having video of some of the songs he had not performed before.  Instead  the TV special had endless shots of people lip syncing, dancing,hugging, wiping a tear from their cheek and mugging for the cameras, people holding up their children and even one airhead waving her cell phone around. Hey I get it, seeing Paul in concert is a very exhillarating and emotional experience. Don't hit me over the head with it. Other concert videos show the audience in concert without destroying the performance. Check out the Moody Blues Live at Red Rocks. Lots of audience shots but not this level of distraction.

 I feel bad for people who did not get to see him in concert who buy this DVD.  Unless you spend 50-60% of your time watching the audience instead of the stage,  you will not get the concert experience.  I want to see Paul and his band and keep the camera in one place at least for short interval.

While he sang for 3 hrs here, the DVD I see is just less than 2 hrs so not sure what will or will not be on it.  I too could have done without the interviews & just had straight concert footage.  Yes, he sung ""I'll Follow the Sun"" on this tour which was awesome, whether it will be on the DVD..we'll see!  Such a wonderful memory finally seeing Paul in person after 30+ years of loving him, can't wait for the DVD!",1162080000,2,513,3.941747572815534
2628501,4,B000H5U5V2,"I just saw the preview of this on A&E and they did have a full version of Please Please Me performed and according to this review I found, I'll Follow the Sun is also in it.  See below.  His voice sounds great on most the songs that I saw (a little weak on Jenny Wren).  Anyway here's the review.

2628502,4,B000H5U5V2,"I'm watching it right now and those annoying audience shots and pseudo documentary clips backstage are included as per the norm of all his tour videos. They even have a complete random family followed by a camera, kind of creepy actually. And the common people being interviewed well, I can do with out that too...sorry if any of you people reading this are some of the selected few who are on the DVD

It would be nice to have another Rockshow type DVD but I think Paul likes to show the backstage bit so to make it more personable. I'm also sure he sang ""I'll Follow the Sun"" cus someone in the audience had a sign up.

Go out and buy it its not that expensive so why not, a cheap indulgence if nothing else. OH and he plays all the songs from start to end. And no Heather clips either, Thank God for that.",1161993600,8,808,4.2064516129032254
