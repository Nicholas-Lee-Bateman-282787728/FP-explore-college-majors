8400727,3,B003N7G5K6,I bought this movie because I'm a Jesse Johnson fan. He is a talented young actor and he was the only good thing about this movie. This movie could have been written and directed much better.,1366243200,,191,4.333333333333333
8400728,1,B003N7G5K6,"Outback is a good example of how to make a G rated horror movie. Get yourself a very attractive cast and a flimsy script and then be sure to exclude any hint of nudity, violence, sex, or gore. This leaves us with a G rated borefest.",1280448000,5,232,4.065217391304348

The zombies are really different from any I've seen.  Quite awesome actually. And the chicks are HOT Aussies and rather quirky.  The movie is a romp through the Outback. It all starts when one of the guys (Jesse Johnson, son of Don Johnson, so not actually an Aussie) gets fired, so he steals his boss's Range Rover, picks up his girlfriend (a doctor who's been working 11 days straight) phones his friend (who's up on charges for illegal abalone fishing) who brings along his lawyer (a hot female one) and she phones a girlfriend (a new age bimbo) and she brings along a friend (a gay Qantas steward) and they all head off on a 4WD adventure. When they stop for gas, they meet this bad dude who's the servant and keeper of Kaditcha, an ancient indigenous creature who dwells in a sacred site in the desert. So they are supernaturally lured to his lair where bad things happen to the guys, but the girls are kept alive. As the plot unfolds we learn about an ancient curse that's been awakened involving a murder 20 years before and which is connected to the doctor chick.

Sexy, funny and very diffent supernatural zombies with fire glowing inside and cinders dropping off them.  A real hoot.",1278892800,7,1257,4.6441441441441444
8400730,4,B003N7G5K6,"THE OUTBACK is a cheesy but slick dark trip off the wrong roads in Australia.  Not a slasher film like WOLF CREEK but more like a David Lynch funny nightmare filled with Aboriginal curses, lesbians, chainsaws and aromatherapists.  It's just the most warped 90 minutes a sexually-confused teen or young adult with a holiday in mind could experience, and I recommend it.  The 'making of' is quite a low budget exercise but insanely funny nonetheless!",1278806400,7,448,4.946666666666666
8400731,3,B003N7G5K6,"Please note that this isn't the classic Aussie film released in the US as ""Outback"". That film is actually ""Wake in Fright"" and available in Region 4 format in a newly discovered print (it was essentially lost for a long time), and is one of the greatest films from that country ever (Donald Pleasance gives one of his most deliciously depraved performances). I don't know this film and the stars are arbitrary, Amazon not giving us the option to not rate.",1277251200,4,456,4.6419753086419755
