8680109,1,B00NTAM0PG,"I misunderstood the synopsis and thought this might be a form of time travel romance, my favorite genre.  Instead this was a stupid movie involving characters who are so wrapped up in themselves that they fail to generate any sympathy from me.  We are introduced to an obnoxious woman who relates to a stranger she meets at the airport the backstory between two passengers who on this ill-fated flight.  The backstory reveals the story between a young nerdy woman and her ""gangster"" friend.  He's called a gangster, but here in the States, real ""gangstas"" would probably kick his butt.  The storyline attempts to make screwball comedy, but it doesn't work here.  Maybe the movie gets better. I don't know but I shut off the movie early on.  For those of you considering watching this movie, if you're still in junior high or high school, you may enjoy the gangster storyline.  Those of you who are close to or at senior citizenship, you will find the female characters--both the wimpy high schooler and the obnoxious lady in the other storyline--just plain tedious to the point you just want to slap them. No matter what age you are, if you like this kind of thing, check out the better movie Clueless.",1472428800,,1202,4.717703349282297
