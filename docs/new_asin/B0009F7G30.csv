2288587,5,B0009F7G30,"This version of Don Giovanni was sort of an ""impulse buy"" because it was cheap and had a few names I recognized (Schade and Josef-Selig.) So I took it home and watched select scenes on it and I wasn't too thrilled with it so I put it away for a few days. Remembering I had bought it I decided to watch it again and found that it was a very compelling Giovanni. Plus, it was the 1st time I had ever seen my now favorite opera singer as Donna Anna- Adrianne Pieczonka. This has got to be the fastest Don Giovanni I have ever seen (Ricardo Muti is known for this.) There were some disappointments as in any performance. Some of the bad things were: the Donna Elvira was a MAJOR disappointment. She just stood there and sang her lines and gave the anguished played character of Elvira no emotions whatsoever. That was the only let-down except the somewhat flawed Zerlina but she at least gave some effort to try to be the character. Now the good parts: as I said Adrianne Pieczonka is my favorite opera singer now and I had no idea of her until this DVD. Her flowing notes come effortlessly out of her mouth. ""Non mi dir"" and ""Or sai chi l'onore"" are highlights of the DVD. Don Giovanni and Leoporello are very good and sing with a very firm foundation. Don Ottavio is a very good and convincing one yet seems too wooden with Donna Anna. The Commendatore is also a very convincing one with the material he's given. Masetto is also a very good/strong voice. I recommend this DVD to everyone who loves this opera and even beginners just diving into the ocean that is Mozart.",1146700800,4,1568,4.373287671232877
2288588,4,B0009F7G30,"Don Giovanni, the quintessentially ensemble opera, receives here a solidly rewarding reading from a highly proficient team. The production may appear quirky, mostly in one all too apparent aspect as is costumes. What producer De Simone and costume designer De Vicentiis want to imply by making the principals dressing to go from the 17th century to the 19th  (Antonacci's dress for the supper scene seems taken out of a luxuriously traditional, belle ?poque-ambienced Traviata, and confusingly Leporello awaits for Don Giovanni at Donna Anna's door attired with an Arlechinesque tint that eventually gives way to later dressing), is simply beyond me (the work's timeliness, perhaps -but then why not go into the 20th century as well, or also hark back one or two more centuries, to Tirso de Molina's, the writer of a play that served Da Ponte as his libretto's  main source, Spanish Golden Century?). Producers' divism ... some people will dismiss the issue as minor but I found it meaningless, unnecessary and even irritating, whence I took off the fifth star. Why Muti, a normally very strict and fastidious man of the theatre, went along is also beyond me.

Yet this may well be the most appealing Don Giovanni available on DVD, because of its immense musical strengths. The recording being captured live by Austrian Radio, the are imperfections here and there, some of the singers starting a shade tentatively and improving significantly as the evening progressed  and the voices  warmed up and ""took off"". Antonacci is affected by this -mind you, a stunning Elvira, both visually and aurally-, with an Act 1 entrance (""Ah chi mi dice mai ..."")a shade tense but her ""Mi tradi quel alma ingrata"" is for the ages, a Donna Elvira that may well be remembered in the future, much as Schwarzkopf's, Della Casa's or Te Kanawa's are today by the old and the not so old. Hers may not be a voice one takes kindly to at first, but one does warm up to it and her stage presence is all-encompassing. And yet the viennese audience rewards Pieczonka's Anna more enthusiastically than Antonacci's Elvira. The Canadian has by now gained quite a name impersonating the character, and justly so. Alvarez's Giovanni is also quite good, a centred bass-baritone register nowadays somewhat less preferred to the role than it used to be in the past, that none the less manages to eschew those scarpian shadings to Giovanni those bass-baritones of old did seemed to favour. Don Ottavio may well be one of the most fatuous characters in opera, and Schade very well gets into Ottavio's personality, yet allowing it to rise to heroic proportions by the time ""Il mio tesoro"" comes ... and then allowing him to recede to his day-to-day ways from then on. Youth has allowed D'Arcangelo to progress, as have so many others, from Leporello to Giovanni, which he now is reported to do more often. Yet what a fine Leporello he is, in spite of his (probably producer-induced) sometimes venturing into farcical gesturing and commedia dell'arte inspired antics.

Muti has never joined the authenticist crowd (as, for example, seems to be Abbado's won't of late when conducting Mozart or  Beethoven), yet here you'll find some of the liveliest and sharpest Mozart conducting you're likely to encounter. He will then ""shape"" lines here and there in a way that will generate frowning from the authenticist camp, but the end result is so musical in the end .. which what in the end counts. He secures good playing from his viennese musicians (Vienna Philharmonic in the pit, with their Vienna State Opera hats and theatre musicians on stage for the party and supper scenes).

Good sound if perspectives tend to change rather abruptly as singers stand close of turn away from stage microphones. Orchestral perspectives aren't also that consistent, though, which makes wonder whether the takes don't come from a single live performance but from more than one.",1145059200,15,3919,4.954337899543379
2288589,3,B0009F7G30,"I was so looking forward to this Giovanni, particularly for D'Archelangelo, but I found everyone trying to overact or deal with the ridiculous, anachronistic, over-built utterly STUPID costumes, that I had to turn away. And Maestro Muti must have had to catch a train! I've never heard such fast, almost unsingable tempi! The voices are wonderful, but the production, although not Eurotrash is ill-conceived and arbitrary. The catalogue aria, a favorite of mine was just sung full out; no phrasing or attention to text, with the most ridiculous ""catalogue"" I've ever seen. Elvira looked much more ""butch"" on her entrance than the English ""fop"" Giovanni.

A BIG disappointment!",1119916800,10,676,5.2592592592592595
2288590,4,B0009F7G30,"There is no doubt who the stars are in this Vienna State Opera production of 'Don Giovanni': the Vienna State Opera Orchestra (aka the Vienna Philharmonic) under Riccardo Muti. I have rarely heard such subtle, flexible orchestral support in what is, after all, generally considered a singer's opera, but one that has innumerable orchestral felicities. And they accompany a cast of singers who, while not all that well-known internationally at the time of this performance (1999), are performing at quite a high level. This live performance (not in the Opera House but in the more intimate Theater an der Wien) was recorded for Austrian television and directed for that medium by the ubiquitous (because he's so good) Brian Large. The stage production by Roberto de Simone is mostly traditional, although one peculiarity is that the costuming (by Zaira de Vincentiis) is updated era by era as we go through the various scenes of the opera -- Giovanni starts out in Act I, Scene I dressed in 16th century commedia dell'arte garb and by Act II he is dressed in a kind of 19th century costume, having along the way been dressed in 17th and 18th  century wig and tights, etc. This is mildly puzzling but not intrusive, nor does it add much to the production.  The sets are mostly utilitarian, albeit beautiful, and do not distort the action as is so often the case in recent European productions.

As I said, though, this is a singer's opera and here we have much to happy about. The young, lithe Carlos &Aacute;'lvarez (a Spaniard who had gone to medical school and become a gynecologist before switching his career to singing) makes a marvelous Giovanni, both in his singing and his acting. He comes across as very charming and one can see how he could win over Donna Elvira even after she has denounced him. The Elvira is Anna Caterina Antonacci. She is a beautiful woman and has a striking voice. It took part of the first act for her voice to warm up and as a result her sound in 'Or sai chi l'onore' is a little covered. But when the voice frees up she sounds thrilling, as in 'Mi tradi' in Act II. Donna Anna is sung by a young Canadian soprano, Adrianne Pieczonka, and she is simply marvelous. I admit I'd never heard of her before, but I was won over. (As I write this, her moving 'Non mi dir' is replaying in my mind's ear. Lovely.)

Leporello is taken with complete gusto by the handsome Ildebrando d'Arcangelo. His servant is winning, cunning and hunky. And he can sing, too. His 'Catalog Aria' is a charmer. One surprise for me was the silken  Don Ottavio of tenor Michael Schade. I had only heard him once before and thought he was a rather typical tenorino, but in this production he produced a sweet, full voice that did full justice to his 'Dalla sua pace' and 'Il mio tesoro.' And his acting was effective. Slightly less so was the Masetto of Lorenzo Regazzo. His voice was a little rough around the edges and his acting a bit stereotypical. It didn't help, probably, that he was mostly in scenes with the gorgeous and gorgeous-voiced mezzo Angelika Kirchschlager, who has since become an operatic superstar. Her 'Batti, batti' was delicious and her acting charmingly effective. The Commmendatore was the appropriately cavernous-voiced basso, Franz-Josef Selig.

You will have noticed that many of the principals are Latins -- '&Aacute;lvarez, Antonacci, d'Arcangelo, Regazzo -- and that, coupled with Muti at the helm, conspired, I believe, to make the opera more Italianate than it often is. Muti conducts on three different DVD releases of 'Don Giovanni,' one of which, from La Scala, I've also reviewed here. They're all good. But this one is also particularly good-looking, at least partly because of the young attractive cast. I recommend this DVD with only minor reservations as noted above.

8059967,5,B0009F7G30,"This is a very fine production and wonderful performance of 'Don Giovanni' back in 1999.
Riccardo Muti has conducted a number of Da Ponte's Mozart operas in Vienna, and this, together with the 1996 'Cosi fan tutte', are musical winners through and through.
The reason is simple - the casts in both productions are GREAT.
In this 'Don Giovanni', for once, we have a Spanish 'Don'. Carlos Alvarez - who is both a fine actor and good baritone, though most of the time, he got 'muffled' in costumes and wigs that are not really becoming the Don. Visually he could have fared much much better had a more sensible art director been around.
He handled the vocal parts with aplomb, though the 'Serenade' could have been a bit more sweet and alluring. But generally speaking, he has the vocal prowess to depict a roguish Don, and the looks to convince that this Don is a real charmer and seducer.
As the 'counterpart' to the Don, D'Arcangelo is a funny and lithe Leporello, so rarely found in terms of comic capacity. HIS costumes are surprising effective, and he makes good use of his capabilities in this important role. The Catalogue Aria is a real winner.
The ladies are all very good, with the vocal crown to Adrianne Pieczonka, whose Donna Anna blows the listeners away through and through, though visually more stolid. Anna Caterina Antonacci is very convincing as Donna Elvira. While her earlier entrance isn't that 'fiery' as the role demands, in the latter two Acts she is able to conjure up all the sympathy for this role.
While the soubrette role of Zerlina is being sung by Austrian mezzo Angelika Kirchschalger instead, hers is both a vocal and acting winner. The Massetto is Lorenzo Regazzo, who has since built up a major baritone career. And even the Commendatore is none other than Selig!
This production offers wonderful chance to see ALL these big operatic names in their youthful state, and with Muti at the pit, nothing can go wrong!",1418083200,,1946,4.726470588235294
8059968,5,B0009F7G30,"Exceptional performance. Muti is able to almost synchronize the music to the breath, not just the words, of the singers. Alvarez is excellent, and all the singers are first class.  I had just recently watched the Met performance with Terfel and enjoyed it, but this performance is of a different class. Recommended",1411516800,,314,5.038461538461538
8059969,5,B0009F7G30,"Riccardo Muti, wonderful maestro. Ildebrando D'Arcangelo gives a performance that shows his Leporello as a round character, if you like EM Forster's 20th century term. Of all the characters, Leporello is the only one who seems really changed at the end--serious, sober, chastened by the events.",1408924800,,294,5.413043478260869
8059970,5,B0009F7G30,"For me, as for many opera lovers, Don Giovanni is one of the favorite operas ever.  I never get tired of it and over the years I tried to see every possible recording of this operatic masterpiece.  Surely Siepi/Furtwangler performance&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Don-Giovanni-Furtwangler/dp/B00005ONMJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart - Don Giovanni / Furtwangler</a>&nbsp;is in many ways unsurpassed, but it is a 60-years old black and white video.  Another great one is Losey's film with Ruggiero Raimondi&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Don-Giovanni-Maazel-Raimondi-Te-Kanawa-Paris-Opera/dp/B00005UW7G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart - Don Giovanni / Maazel, Raimondi, Te Kanawa, Paris Opera</a>, a superb movie with a splendid balance of music, vocal and visual effects.  But it is a true film, not  a live recording from the theater.  I always wished to see a knock-out theater performance, but all of them have something disappointing.  And then I found this one, purely by chance, by searching for Anna Caterina Antonacci, whom I just recently saw as Rossini's Desdemona in Brussels, and that followed being at Don Giovanni at La Bastille with Peter Mattei; such amazing coincidences!  Well, I could not believe I never saw this incredible production.

Why is this spectacle so incredible? It is not even due to some of the best possible cast for the opera; of course, Riccardo Muti is a connoisseur of this music; his Don Giovanni is fast, furious and not sentimental at all.  A huge plus is that musically he is NOT a romantic hero here, too.  Vocally, everyone is a riot - Adrianne Pieczonka is a perfect Donna Anna; I saw her as Arabella in Berlin only two years ago, she was sensational there and she is as exceptional on this video.  Antonacci is a true Elvira,  passionate and virtuosic;  Ildebrando d'Arcangelo is always excellent, it seems, be it Leporello or Enrico VIII, and finally Carlos Alvarez as Don Giovanni is consummate, even though he might not reach the same level of flawless agility and effortlessness as Siepi or Mattei.  All in all, many other performances of Don Giovanni could boast the same very high vocal quality.

What makes this production truly outstanding is the concept.  I deeply admire the idea to finally place the story to where it belongs, in a historic context.  The reason is simple - characters like Don Giovanni simply do  not exist today.  They were products of Ancien Regime, of huge aristocratic privilege, of the principal of the ""divine right"" that gave the nobles the world as their personal playground and  put them above all but a  chosen few.  I often think that if I staged Don Giovanni, it could start as Marquis de Sade writing a story of his life from his prison cell.  De Sade embodied the whole attitude to life when he expressed that he had considers only the King and Princes of the blood above himself; to all else, including society, judges, other people he held only condescension.  One must be born into such a culture to become an authentically-spirited Don Giovanni.

Thus, the stunning element in this production was the depiction of this very important quality of a powerful aristocrat who considers just about everyone around him as his toy, created solely for his pleasure and amusement, and he practices his views and ideas openly, with no fear or concern of doing something wrong.  The romantic idea of Stephan Zweig and other numerous writers who interpreted Don Giovanni as a tragic hero in search of a perfect woman is completely absent from this performance,  and this absence is a huge advantage for the accurate understanding of the protagonist character.  Don Giovanni is an epitome of a libertine, who'd do anything to avoid a strong attachment to any person; such a connection would be a restrain on his freedom; Viva la liberta!  It is strange how romantics missed this point about his persona;  adopting that romantic ideal, Don Giovanni would feel remorse or guilt, but the crux of his ego is the total absence of these feelings.  I love how Carlos Alvarez acts this part, with his face expressing only annoyance or bewilderment at others' agonies, despair, emotional raptures.

Also, it would be too short to think of Don Giovanni simply as vile seducer.  His other quality, and perhaps even more important one, is being a rebel.  As mentioned, he recognizes no authority over himself.  That's where productions placing the action in the modern world become so unconvincing.  Certainly there are numerous womanizers today, say, Dominique Strauss-Kahn or our dear Mr. Bill the President, etc.  But when caught in flagrante, as they were, would they answer a passionate ""NO!"" to the order ""Pentiti!""?  The answer is passionate ""NO"".  And I think the charisma, mystery and all those enigmatic qualities that make Don Giovanni such an irresistible figure that keeps him being on stage since his premiere in Prague in 1787  are exactly due to the combination of his promiscuity AND rebellion; not just the former, which nowadays is usually the focus of the opera.

I saw it once in Komische Oper Berlin, predictably the setting was in a brothel, in 1930s timeframe.  Modern Germans have a predilection for crudity, wholly missing the point of the more advanced idea of this work;  it almost seems as they have overindulged in too good music from Bach-Beethoven-Brahms, and since about 100 years ago they go directly to the point - sex; but not as much as to the other, deeper meanings of great works, which in case of Don Giovanni is the denial of conventional morality based on religion.  However this defiance is absolutely crucial to the idea of a libertine aristocrat amusing himself, since he shall have no restrain and no responsibility before anyone and anything.  It is hard for a modern person to comprehend such a mindset, but it was common in monarchic times.

In Paris Michael Haneke's production was also weak (link  to videos in Comments section), depicting Don Giovanni as a corporate executive; it only showed that Haneke never worked in a corporation.  Another one I saw in Dresden two years ago was simply banal, with a ubiquitous gun and a luggage bag appearing on stage - attributes of many modern productions lacking in imagination and creativity.

In fact, the only place where a rich, promiscuous and society-defiant man can be found today is the crime world.  And this is why Peter Sellars production&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Don-Giovanni/dp/B00092ZAN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart - Don Giovanni</a>&nbsp;is to me the most successful attempt to place the action in modernity - because it is so utterly outrageous and extreme; just as a true original Don Giovanni should be.  But that production is still a macabre caricature of the original opera.

All of the above then explains why this version is so precious and unique; I think it is on the same level of understanding of the material and attention to detail as productions of Jean-Pierre Ponnelle.  The director Roberto di Simone has created a phenomenal idea of starting the story in times of Tirso de Molina, the author of ""El Burlador de Sevilla y convidado de piedra"" (The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest), the piece in which Don Juan is first presented on the stage, and moving it through impeccably depicted times of Louis XIV (absolutely glorious costumes!!!), then Louis XVI - those white and black dressed were feast for the eyes;  then Napoleonic times and  19th century romantic period, and finally towards the last true European Empires - we see nobles dressed in the fashion of last imperial Hapsburgs of Austria, with ladies' outfits strongly resembling those of Sissi, an icon Empress; it could equally be German or Russian twilight imperial years.

I admire the concept of a proud disdainful aristocratic character coming to an end together with the social order that once created it.  I think it was an excellent idea to finish the opera at that time instead of modernity.  Don Giovanni vanished with the last Regimes Anciennes.

Personally, it was also pleasant for me to see Theater an der Wein, where the premier of Fidelio took place and where I saw a very modern Handel's Rodelinda last year, with an all-star cast (Danielle de Niese, Bejun Mehta, Nikolaus Harnoncourt).  It suffered heavily from brutal modern desecration, something this Don Giovanni had cunningly escaped.  I wish I were there for it!

Overall it is an extraordinary production, from all standpoints, a Prague version with a  great aria ""Il mio tesoro intanto"".

Many a soprano or mezzo would find this Don Giovanni hard to resist.
Also, I personally found the costume changes interesting and

and having different interpretations of classic work, can be great  if
it works, and I think this does.  I also recommend the dvd of Macbeth
which also stars the talented Carlos Alvarez.",1205366400,,858,5.049645390070922
8059974,5,B0009F7G30,"First of all let me tell you that I have most of the Don Giovanni available on DVD, and this is by far the best. Please don't pay attention to traditionalist who are repulsed by any change at all, no matter how small or interesting it may be. That's certainly the case here, where the principals continually change dresses and hair makeups. What one can see is a historical progression begining with not very aesthetically pleasing XVI century dresses and makeups all the way to better looking World War 1 dresses, passing through the French Revolution and XIX century Habsburg times. I for one found it a welcome change, which could have been made to state the universality and timelessness of the piece.

Now the singing. I believe these are the perfect singers for each role. Carlos Alvarez is incredible in the role, the perfect Don Giovanni, in singing and acting, way better than Terfel in the Met version. Adrianne Pieczonka is also better than Fleming, something I'd never have thought (the latter's voice just doesn't meld well in ensembles). Antonnaci begins a little shaky but in the second act is riveting. D'Arcangelo is the best Leporello of the moment (like Furlanetto was when he was young) and the then young Angelika Kirshlager, who'm I saw several times in her native Vienna, is one of the best Mozart mezzos of the latest time. Michael Schade, with his velevet voice is also one of the best Mozart tenors around, equally convincing here as in his Salzburg Clemenza.

And finally but not least (all the contrary) is Riccardo Muti's exciting and fast conducting. Let me state that I think this is Mozart's most difficult opera to conduct because it's very difficult to maintaint the drama and tension that the opera demands. I have only heard Harnoncourt and Giulini who could do it so well (unluckily Harnoncourt never had in CD or DVD the great cast that Muti has here). It's true, I'd have liked him to decrease the speed a little in some arias (the ensembles are at a perfect intense and dramatical speed), but hey, it's Muti, who's always one to give you exactly whatever Mozart wrote in the score, so in any case, Muti's not the one to blame... What he achieves is that the opera never drags, like some moments in the Met's version, and is always dramatic and full of tension.

Just as a clarifying statement, the Vienna State Opera Orchestra is not the Vienna Philharmonic, with nothing in commeon except the city's name (luckily, since I doubt that the rigid Philharmonic could have given Muti the fast and dramatic tempos that he needed). Nevertheless, it's a first class orchestra and the best opera orchestra I've heard along with the La Scala orchestra.

The sound is only in stereo but, while not as state of the art as the latest Opus Arte releases, very good and effective. Excellent balance between the orchestra and the singers, unlike some others in which the orchestra is so low in level, they make you think it's on not on the same building.",1178496000,8,2979,4.723076923076923
8059975,4,B0009F7G30,"This is, in my opinion, a fine performance of Don Giovanni. Its biggest strength is the quality of the singers. They're almost uniformly excellent. The orchestra is truly a pleasure to listen to. The sets aren't terribly interesting, but neither are they annoying, and given the quirky creativity that set designers often want to display, I'm relieved when they're merely innocuous.

The quality of the acting is quite good, especially the Don and Leporello. It helps that they look good in their parts. Donna Anna is not so good. Her voice is nice, but her acting is wooden. It's made worse by the ridiculous costumes she wears, and they get worse and worse as the opera goes on. I admit to being completely baffled by the abuse the costume designer heaps on that poor woman. The other characters don't fare nearly so badly in that department, which makes Anna's costumes all the more baffling. Muti's tempi are brisk, but not unpleasantly so. The opera still lasts for nearly three hours - it's not as if Muti reduces it to a Monty Python skit. I actually think the pacing is quite good.

This performance isn't perfect, but I've never seen one on DVD that was. Either a performer in a major role is too old (sorry, but this is theater, not just music) or is a great singer and poor actor, or the set design and staging are intrusively quirky, or the orchestra is sloppy, or the transfer to DVD is murky. All in all, this recording is solid. If they'd just let poor Donna Anna out of her clown suits and put a singer in the part who can act, I'd up my rating to a 4.5, but it's a very good 4-star disc.

Update: I've watched this disc a few times since I wrote this review, and I've decided I should probably watch an opera at least four or five times before reviewing it. I've changed my opinion on the singer who plays Donna Anna - I think she's actually very good in the part. I'd found myself bored and irritated by Don Ottavio, but now I think that Mozart intended for us to be bored and irritated by the man - he's weak where Don Giovanni is strong, he's conventional where the Don is independent, his music is bland where the Don's sparkles. I think he and Donna Anna are exactly as they should be in this performance.

Also, I'm no longer as put-off by Donna Anna's costumes as I was before; they've come to seem oddly appropriate. (For some reason I was calling Donna Anna Donna Elvira when I first wrote this review - I've corrected that.) I don't see the need to emphasize Leporello's clownishness by putting him in white makeup, and I'm a little more bothered by the set lighting than I was (it makes me feel as if my eyes are failing me), but if Amazon would let me up my rating of this disc to five stars, I would.",1157673600,8,2730,4.3893280632411065
