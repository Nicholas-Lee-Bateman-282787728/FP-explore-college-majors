2881414,1,B000S6LS8O,"Just the concept that this exists, that people will pay $10 plus shipping for a DVD to hear about people who dislike each other, is chilling. However, what is really crazy: there are 4 of them! This is Beef 4! It's like if the junkertainment news show Extra! tried to appeal to an ""urban"" market and started making movies. It sounds like a joke! The presumption on the behalf of the producers that anyone cares who celebrities do and don't like is insulting, and calling this cast ""celebrities"" is very generous. I watch TV and listen to new music all the time, and I don't know who 75% of these people are. Paul Wall for instance: I know that he was in a duet with Brooke Hogan around 2006 because I remember seeing him on ""Hogan Knows Best"". What a superstar. Why would I care who he does and doesn't like? I'm sure that anyone involved with this DVD could not name 5 international ""beefs"" involving current diplomatic strife in the world. Please, if you are considering buying this, first read:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mirror-Effect-How-Celebrity-Narcissism-Is-Seducing-America/dp/B002NSLMUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mirror Effect: How Celebrity Narcissism Is Seducing America</a>.",1279670400,,1245,5.489583333333333
2881415,1,B000S6LS8O,"This beef dvd is just bad, I mean I thought it was just me. Other than the whole Houston piece this dvd is worthless.  The queen of the south beef was just stupid, two of the three beefing are nobodies outside of MIA so that could have been a portion for hood to hood or something.  The LL and Jamie Fox thing seems old and a waste of time and the Game is just getting boring to see or watch.  I would love to know about more oldschool beefs like Rakim vs Big Daddy, Rakim vs EPMD, Dj Quick vs MC Eith, Treach vs YZ or tell us what really was going on with No Limit and Cash Money or Rap a lot and Sauve House.",1206835200,9,610,3.8253968253968256

8204422,3,B000S6LS8O,Nowhere nearly as good as Beef I and II but since I had all 3 I went ahead and got the 4th. this as described also has celebrity beefs such as in the special features it tells an untold story of Dave Chappelle.,1441411200,,210,3.9069767441860463

8204424,4,B000S6LS8O,"This movie was good, real good. As a big music guy, I like to keep up with beef, just in case I end up in the music business one day",1365811200,,132,3.433333333333333
8204425,1,B000S6LS8O,"Beef 1 is the best one of the 4,the only reason worth watching is Pac',all the rest is just post-1996(Rap Game is Dead)malarkey,Biggie,G a y -Z, flab boy,mobb sleep are all whack, East Coast Rap unless it's 80s or BDI and Bootcamp Clik/SmiffnWessum it doesn't matter, And all these so-called ""Positive Rappers"" as Willie D once said Positivity ain't getting nobody paid. All these back-packers read Fake muslims(Nation of Islam is a Radical Communist Sect-yet they have an monopoly on bean pies and providing security for the industry,ironically the suspect last seen around BIG was an Bowtie wearing ""Peaceful"" follower.) The only ones worth listening to Yukmouth,Scarface,Willie D,Dru Down,E-40,Bone,Spice 1,GrandMaster Flash,Big Daddy Kane,but all these others are all over rated,Krs-one is one self centered sucka MC.Backpackers or bling rap is still dead.",1302566400,,860,5.5227272727272725
8204426,4,B000S6LS8O,I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY INFORMATIONAL SEEING ALL THESE BEEFS. I WAS MAINLY INTERESTED IN THE JEEZY AND GUCCI MAN ONE. IF YOU LIKE HIP-HOP AND WONDERED WHAT KIND OF BEEFS THERE ARE. GO AHEAD AND BUY THIS.,1293840000,,201,4.315789473684211
8204427,4,B000S6LS8O,"Beef 4 is a ""best of"" compilation of the Beef TV series that ran for six episodes on BET. So far, this has gotten bad reviews, but its nowhere near as bad as Beef 3. There are some pretty terrible sections in this (queen of the south, Pall Wall etc), but those are outweighed by awesome, historic feuds that all hip-hop fans should know:

Daz vs. Kurupt
Jay-Z vs. Damon Dash
LL Cool J vs. Jaime Foxx
The Game vs. Ras Kass

And then there's some lesser known ones that are still pretty good [Terry Kennedy vs. Lupe Fiasco, Nickz vs. ENJ]. Probably the best (or worst) one is the Jay-Z/Dash story. That tale of Jay-Z tearing apart Roc-A-Fella records is a really sad sight to see. Anyways, if you're a fan of the other DVDs in the series, this one's a must.",1288742400,,755,4.2727272727272725
