The film shows an island. A man knocks on a door. A young woman answers, but nobody is there. The music provides clues to the drama. The conversations reveal the characters. Leo Grainger will invite people whose greed is greater than their fear. His old accountant shows up for shelter. Leo explains the past history to Gail [and to the audience]. Astrologer Emily tells Alec Richfield about his invitation. Sylvia Jordan and John Kavanaugh will be there. ""There's safety in numbers."" Does Leo have a trap? A small boat is in the water. The guests arrive at this mansion. Jeff Kingsley arrives in place of his dead Dad. Leo explains the purpose of the meeting: retribution. Each will be given a gift which is a clue. [The film begins to drag with the music.]

Is Leo right in his mind? Sylvia becomes afraid. The conversations carry the story forward and tell about the people. Is there a secret door to the basement? What about the table? People act mysteriously or angrily. Who murdered Leo's wife? What will be his fate? The music provides the moods for the action. ""Very interesting."" People spy on each other for dramatic effect. Dear Emily uses her key. Two men fight in the living room! The four will split the treasure equally. Will Leo have the last laugh? Gail finds what her Mom left her, and advice to leave the island. Jeff discovers the fate of the others. [How could he open that door against the force of the water?]",1475539200,,1455,4.613899613899614
