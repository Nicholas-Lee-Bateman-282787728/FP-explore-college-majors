8442649,4,B004V2FVSE,"""Mastana""is really an great emotional movie. The story is about the relationship between an child and poor man. Mehmood is best in his emotional acting in this movie. The song""Cched mere Hamrahi""is very fantastic. Mehmood makes us laugh and even cry throughout his body language in this movie. The characterization of the child character is really good .The emotions expressed by the child during the parents day in the school brings tear in the eyes. Vinod Khanna has shown a little performance as a Police officer. The emotional scenes have been Picturized very carefully. Although the movie is Lenghty the climax scene makes us to forget about the Lengthy scenes of the movie. I would really talk about the simple climax of the movie. The climax scene is where Mehmood comes with balloons and toys to see the Child and he hears that the Child is struggling for its life. The continuation of the scene where he drops all toys and balloons in floor and ran quickly to see the child brings tears in the eyes of people who watched the movie. The song takes place between Mehmood and child booby is superb. Watch movie at least once those have not watched this emotional and tear jerker movie. Mehmood had proved himself best in emotional scenes. Mehmood fans please don't miss the movie.",1305849600,,1286,4.771300448430493
