8266199,1,B000055XSI,"Disappointed that japanese audio isn't available.  I'm not one of those anime fans that's completely against dubs but I usually prefer the japanese audio, especially with these older anime where the quality of the dubs wasn't that high.

I think I heard lina inverse's voice as the raalgon princess tho. that's probably the only good thing I'd say about the dub.",1503273600,,362,4.918032786885246
8266200,1,B000055XSI,"I bought this season streaming without checking the language and instantly regretted it. Why is there only English audio?

I love this series, but I'm leaving this as 1 star as a protest for amazon not carrying the anime with the Japanese audio. They should know anyone interested in these old anime series is going to want subtitled shows.",1499817600,2,340,4.762711864406779

8266202,5,B000055XSI,"This one of only two series where the Pilot episode is not my favorite episode (The other is the first season of City Hunter). But the pilot sets the stage for a series that left me almost literally rolling on the floor with laughter. The captain is not only irresponsible, but almost as staggeringly oblivious as he is brilliantly lucky. A definite must see for anyone, and since it has been dubbed (a LOT better than most dubbed anime) it is accessible even to those who hate to read subs.",1403481600,,491,4.466666666666667

8266205,4,B000055XSI,"I have really enjoyed the series so far.
It's filled with 90's anime humor that I love. The characters are great and I can't wait to get the remaining dvd's (oh and it comes with Spanish dub)",1362441600,,191,4.1891891891891895
8266206,1,B000055XSI,I suport paying the makers but i can watch it free on other sites and i have prime and still have to pay. This is not worth it to pay per video on line by the box set if you want.,1338940800,,179,3.3902439024390243
8266207,5,B000055XSI,"So what if you have no home.  You walk around the streets daily.  Your only clothing is a white raincoat that you never wash or change.  Tylor is just your average bum with supernatural luck.  Imagine destroying a billion dollar android by flirting with it.  Then getting away with it while the entire base is looking for a supposedly super spy who had done it.  Then not only that, he manages to get hardened terrorists to rethink about their life and bring them to tears.  And the next moment Tylor becomes from a bum to the Captain of the Soyokaze spaceship.  The story just goes along bringing laughs in every episode.  I would say this was my favorite science fiction series.",983145600,13,680,4.553719008264463
