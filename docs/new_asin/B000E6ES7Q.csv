2499306,5,B000E6ES7Q,"The trouble with many documentaries on religious figures or events is that in our era of religious suspicion much of the spirituality is washed out to make a movie more ""accessible"" to a wide audience. In doing this these documentaries miss the mark, and create a figure or event entirely unhistorical. The reality about C.S. Lewis is he was a Christian. Not only this, he was a Christian apologist, a man who spent a significant part of his life convincing others about Christianity.

That core reality is found in this documentary. Indeed, this movie may have been better titled, ""In His Own Words"", for having read the bulk of Lewis' writings I recognized significant parts. Think of this movie as a very uncluttered dramatization of Surprised by Joy, A Grief Observed, and a selection of his letters.

C.S. Lewis saw his own identity being defined by his faith. He was fascinating, he himself argued, precisely because of his Christianity. This movie, without holding back, gets right to the heart of Lewis' own self-understanding, and as such is a wonderful hour spent with a very intriguing and influential scholar, writer, theologian, and evangelist.",1147564800,54,1157,5.020833333333333
2499307,4,B000E6ES7Q,"It's remarkable how ordinary and seemingly insignificant events prove pivotal, and in God's economy part of his grand design.  Such is the case in the life of C.S. Lewis.  He wrote, ""I always believed that miracles can happen.  You just have to be at the right place at the right time.""

The tragic loss of his mother led to a cruel English boarding school experience.  Begging to leave, he came out into the spacious freedom of a demanding but beloved tutor, who inspired a love of learning and knowledge.  It served as preparation for Oxford University.

His education was interrupted by what was called ""The Great War.""  Did the tragedy and horror of it confirm his atheism?  Wounded in battle, he returned to his studies and Christian friends like J.R.R. Tolkien, who challenged his atheistic assumptions.

His defenses began to crumble when he realized that not only were his best friends Christian, his favorite books were written by Christian authors.  He could no longer deny God's existence and felt the pressure of God's pursuit.

He had been filled with trepidation at the thought of becoming a believer, but in 1929 he reluctantly surrendered.  It was anything but joyous.

But years later, after a career in writing had emerged, he agreed to meet with an American woman who had written him.  This seemingly insignificant event would forever change his life.  He was at the right place at the right time.  Joy Gresham would become his friend, and later to make it possible for her to stay in England, Lewis agreed to a hasty ""paper"" marriage.

It was the tragedy of Joy's cancer that brought their love to the surface, which led to a real marriage before God.  At last Lewis would know the joy in his sixties that he had been denied in his twenties.  This pleasure would prove to be fleeting, as Joy's recovery was only temporary.

She eventually succumbed leaving Lewis to question the faith he had espoused and defended.  In back of all the twists and turns in his life, stood the God who helped Lewis and his stepchildren carry on.

All of these scenes and more are beautifully depicted in this dramatic presentation.  Amazingly, it condenses into 54 minutes all the periods and highlights of his life.  The pacing is even and relaxed; it never feels rushed.

This is not a documentary.  An assortment of actors, including a man who looks like an older Lewis, vividly and expertly recreate his life.

The promotional DVD copy opens with an advertisement for this production and did not have any of the bonus features listed on the box.  This includes Lewis and Narnia trivia, information about Lewis and a few other items related to the Narnia books.

The presentation opens with Lewis as a child exploring an old cottage.  Then it flashes forward to 1963 with the older Lewis narrating his story.  The different episodes are played out in between narration and commentary.  Lewis serves as a guide; everything comes to us from his perspective.

As you might expect, this is more realistic and less dramatic than ""Shadowlands,"" the popular Hollywood version of his life.  It also has a warmth and production that exceeds the PBS story.  This may be the best and is probably the most concise depiction of Lewis on film.

Those who know his story may not learn anything new, but this works because it's well-done, entertaining and realistic.  It's a loving depiction that serves as a great follow-up to the ""Narnia"" movie.  It takes us beyond Narnia to show us the miracle of the life behind it.",1143158400,96,3508,4.773710482529118

2499321,5,B000E6ES7Q,"This story of the author, C. S. Lewis telling his life story and how he came to write ""The Chronicles of Narnia"", was heartwarming. It put a face and depicted the life of a man who was the creator of these inspiring books and later movies. It also shows what the life of a book writer/author was like in those times and how they inspired each other.

Also Beyond Narnia showed how his childhood interest in animals and their ability to express moral thoughts helped him to write the Narnia tales.  For those who like C.S. Lewis, this is a beautiful portrayal of the author and his times.  A. M. Seidler",1361577600,,499,4.858823529411764

My concern is that the bonus features were not accessible.  Can't figure out why since I was playing it on a computer which they said was required.  I ""suspect"" that this was a copy so perhaps that is why the bonus features weren't working.  Oh well, learned my lesson.  Won't be ordering used DVDs any more.

2499328,3,B000E6ES7Q,"This story appeared to be made by non-Christian director/producer since CS Lewis' Christian faith was not shown from Christian view. This product may be targeted for non-Christians. I was looking for CS Lewis' Christian life story; how he was converted, what experience made him converted etc. How he was moved as he was writing Narnia story.
So it was disappointing.",1289952000,2,367,5.133333333333334
2499329,5,B000E6ES7Q,"I have seen this about four times now, and am still moved to tears of joy when viewing it.  The Jesus to whom C. S. Lewis introduces us is full of life, power, grace, and joy.  If you enjoy Lewis' writing, then you will certainly love this autobiographical journey into the heart and mind of a great literary figure, one with whom most folks could easily imagine sharing a good mug of ale and a hearty laugh.  The most moving aspect of Lewis' theology is the fact that he does not present an other-worldly, escapist picture, but integrates the pains and uncertainty of life with the presentation of a warm, personable, and caring Lord who walks with us through suffering and sorrow with the excitement of knowing the incredible wonder of our destination.",1276473600,4,754,4.654135338345864
2499330,4,B000E6ES7Q,"What is best about this DVD is that character of C.S. Lewis protrayed said exactly what C.S.

2499331,5,B000E6ES7Q,"I would recommend buying a copy to every church library which asdpires to be in earnest.  It almost comes as a surprise that the actors are just that, so true a portrayal do they make.  In this condensed version of Lewis' life one is able to ascertain the Hand of God moving in his life and giving it direction.  This is particularly noticeable when one considers the parallels that appear = notably the search for joy, the appearance of two brothers who are beset by circumstances, the two mothers who die an early death.  One wonders whether this is not really about Lewis or rather the eternal vision that his stepson Douglas will carry forward, as Lewis' heir.",1256601600,,664,4.601694915254237
2499332,5,B000E6ES7Q,"C.S. Lewis is my favorite author, bar none.  I have never read anything by Lewis that I didn't like and I always learn something from reading his writings. He forces you to think.  But who was the man behind the writings?  That's what BEYOND NARNIA explores.  This short DVD (about 55 minutes) examines key experiences from Lewis' life by having Lewis himself (portrayed by an actor) tell us through a series of reenacted scenes from his life.  The idyllic early years of his childhood, the death of his mother, his years at boarding school, the tutelage under the Great Knock, the Great War, his years of teaching, his friendship with J.R.R. Tolkien, and his relationship with his eventual wife, Joy, are all discussed.  More time is spent on some of these areas than others, but each of them provides insight who Lewis was. Even though I knew most of the information and had read most of the stories, I really enjoyed BEYOND NARNIA. It's short, but quite accurate.  It's educational and entertaining without being dry.  Highly recommended for fans of Lewis, fans of Narnia, or as a way to introduce people to who Lewis was.",1239580800,2,1125,4.733333333333333

2499334,3,B000E6ES7Q,"For an hour long documentary this is not bad, it is not great either.  The actor portraying Lewis - Anton Rogers is very good.  The story is not great.  The facts are there, but they have been cut and pasted to fit into the time frame and the goal of the writer/director/producer, etc.  Small facts that are not quite true are given, which may lead one to believe things about Lewis which were not true.  However, this is TV and only an hour.  It is worth a watch, rent it, check your library, do not buy unless you are getting a great deal.  Two very good documentaries are The Life of C.S. Lewis by Day of Discovery - [...] and C.S. Lewis: The Dreamer of Narnia - comes with The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe extended edition DVD.",1236384000,8,735,4.244604316546763

2499336,5,B000E6ES7Q,"This is exceptionally good DVD for two classes of potential viewers:  first for those who have not read or heard much of the background of Narnia's genius C.S. Lewis, this will introduce them in very well done intro to the life that produced this wonderful series.  It is filmed in many of the actual locations where he lived and wrote, and is historically very accurate.

For those of us who are familiar with this background material already, I also commend this video, as it was great to see the actual footage and the portrayal by Anton Rogers is hauntingly good.

The final scene is especially poignant, from the Final Battle entering into eternity there are chapters that only get better and better.

The bonus features accessible by personal computer with DVD capabiblity are good also.",1197849600,6,793,4.844444444444444
2499337,4,B000E6ES7Q,"This was professionally made and the footage appears to be mostly on locations where CS Lewis lived and worked. Most of the lines delivered by the actor portraying Jack were right out of his written works. Only one puzzle hit me and that was the abreviated approach to his conversion. It seemed to skip over which books and discussions had a great influence on him. It suggested his change of mind occurred in his room while I have often heard it happened while traveling one day, but maybe this was a different issue. Overall, this is a nice summary of his life.",1196035200,4,563,4.529411764705882
2499358,5,B000E6ES7Q,"Beyond Narnia is a captivating movie where C. S. Lewis is presented as an older man looking back and telling the story of his life. There are cuts back and forth from the autobiographical narrator and those acting out the scenes.

Over the years I have seen several videos about C. S. Lewis. I have read many hundreds of pages. And here are all the facts told in an orderly way. The film is easy to understand and very engaging. The sets and costumes help tell the visual story as the narrator talks.

This movie is recommended for all those who want to understand the live of C S Lewis both as the writer of the Narnia Chronicles as well as his many other books. Understanding his spiritual pilgrimage can provide a greater context to more fully appreciate the soil of his life that the fruits of his labors came from in his complex walk with God.",1191715200,2,848,4.3949044585987265
2499359,4,B000E6ES7Q,"This is a summary of the life of C.S. Lewis in the style of a narrative/flashback told by Mr. Lewis near the end of his life.

When I first popped in the disc and saw ""BBC,"" I was preparing myself for the below-par quality that I've come to expect from U.K. comedies on late-night PBS specials. But within five minutes, I was hooked. Being an avid C.S. Lewis fan myself, I was pleased that nearly all of the monologue from the actor who played the older Mr. Lewis was taken word-for-word from the works and letters of C.S. Lewis and arranged in such a way as to give explain the life of Lewis to the viewer. Even the dialogue in the flashbacks appears to be inspired by the real words and letters of Lewis.

The actors did a superb job. The older Mr. Lewis, who also appears in the flashbacks, did an excellent job at times describing and other times depicting the range of emotions the real Lewis went through: happiness, love, sadness, wonder, apathy, all of these were captured in his voice and his expressions. The director also did a wonderful job depicting scenes from World War I while Lewis describes how the war cemented his Atheism as a young man.

Three other scenes in particular stood out to me. The first was shortly after the death of the young Lewis' mother and depicts his father alone in a study, debilitated by his grief and unable to console his grieving children ""who desperately needed their father's love and attention.""

The second was the scene of the night on which Lewis converted to belief in God (not Christianity, just Theism). The young Lewis (played by a different actor than the old) is shown in his study, tormented by the pressing reality of God. The acting and directing were superb in capturing the tension that C.S. Lewis described when he said that this was the night he became ""the most dejected and reluctant convert in all of England.""

The third scene was when Lewis' wife, Joy Gresham Lewis, dies of cancer. The actor who played the older Lewis, who up to this point has seemed quite inspirational, now displays Lewis' anger and apathy toward God that followed his wife's death; as well as his restoration to a more vivid, mature faith in God.

My only complaint with this video is its brevity. At 54 minutes, it does a tremendous job showing the highlights of Lewis' life, but another half hour would have been well received. While the video does contain brief depictions of Lewis' friendship with J.R.R. Tolkien and his involvement with an intellectual club, ""The Inklings,"" I wish the video had spent more time on Lewis' relationship with other friends such as Charles Williams, Owen Barfield, Hugo Dyson, and Lewis life-long friend Arthur Greeves who is never so much as mentioned. The video also never depicts the event that catapulted Lewis fame to new heights as a Christian apologist during the 40's when he was asked to do a series of talks on Christianity for BBC radio that were eventually compiled into one his most popular works, ""Mere Christianity."" A pivotal event in Lewis' life as a Christian apologist, it is quite neglected.

But with all of these criticisms, it should be noted that with only under an hour, the movie is surprisingly extensive in its breadth of material that is covered.

This video will give any new Lewis initiates a concise, but surprisingly comprehensive overview of his life. And for more mature fans, such as myself, it brings life to Lewis' words. This DVD does not disappoint.",1189814400,7,3465,4.6875
2499360,5,B000E6ES7Q,"I really can't tell more than if you want a brief but good view into the life of C.S. Lewis then purchase this video. As a pastor I have used the last lines spoken in the movie by Lewis at a few funerals. This due to the fact that as a christian it really speaks to the one simple fact that this is not the last chapter in our life , but the first of many great ones. But you get a good insight to C.S. Lewis' writing..... Why, How, When etc. You probably won't be disappointed.",1186963200,4,478,3.9381443298969074
2499361,5,B000E6ES7Q,"I was prepared not to like this DVD, as it seemed to be yet another attempt to tie into Lewisania and the recent film of the Chronicles of Narnia. After all, what could be the point of a DVD that lasts only an hour, and what could be said that hasn't already been said?  But this film instantly drew me in and quickly disarmed me. It's not a documentary in the general sense of the word, but is built around Anton Rogers, as C. S. Lewis, recalling his life, and segues into various scenes.

Anton Rogers plays Lewis far better than Anthony Hopkins, and instead of sets, the shots are on location at Oxford, including the Eagle and Child pub where Lewis met with ""Tollers"" (J.R.R. Tolkien), Charles Williams and the other writers and friends known as the Inklings. My title comes from one of the numerous great lines Rogers says throughout the film, which seems largely drawn from Lewis' two autobiographies, Surprised By Joy and All My Road Before Me, as well as A Grief Observed, which he wrote after his wife Joy's death, and originally published under a pseudonym.

The last was a difficult time for Lewis, and the handling here, while necessarily telegraphic in such a brief film, is better than in Shadowlands, where it was played solely for effect. I found the ending somewhat unsatisfactory, but it's probably difficult to tie up at that point when in fact Lewis wrote more books and lectured for some time after. This film assumes one has read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, and refers to it as the first Narnian Chronicle, which it originally was, having been written in 1950. The recent reordering of the books to follow chronological events in Narnia has caused some confusion, but of course, all one needs to do is read them in the old order. That said, this DVD is like opening the wardrobe again, as it takes one further up and further in, beyond Narnia.",1175731200,8,1876,4.594029850746269
2499362,4,B000E6ES7Q,"As a child, my father would read me books by C.S. Lewis that you would assume would be far beyond a child's understanding and yet at a young age, this writer captured my heart. His Narnia books birthed in me a love for reading and his life is an interesting study in soul growth and maturing through life's complexity.

In this brief dramatized introduction to his life, we enter a world where C.S. Lewis talks about his life while sitting by a fireplace. This has the feeling of a fireside chat with portrayals of C.S. Lewis' discovery of true love, his life as a writer and his struggles to accept the reality of God's existence, all while he says he was angry at God for not existing. There are some great moments of humor throughout.

If you have read the work of C.S. Lewis, especially ""A Grief Observed,"" then ""Beyond Narnia"" presents a deeper understanding of how C.S. Lewis lost the woman he loved. I found myself caught up in the tragic romance, the intimacy of the conversations and the stories of his life in Oxford.

The filming locations are beautiful, libraries and historic settings add intrigue. I suppose the only thing I felt a little distracted by was how C.S. Lewis' beliefs about God were presented. While most of the aspects of his conversion from atheism to Christianity seem correct, I think at the point at which he would have been telling his story, he would have been less critical of God. Reading Mere Christianity gives a much more in depth look at his true feelings.

It seems true to say that the more you learn about C.S. Lewis, the more fascinated you become. This docudrama doesn't really address the Chronicles of Narnia in detail, nor does it really explore any of C.S. Lewis' writing. This is more about his childhood, his personal relationship with God and his understanding of grief. When you think about, how many authors could so influence a life? Not only are his children's books completely fascinating, his writings on spirituality are some of the most profound literary moments I've ever encountered. Each time I take time to study more about C.S. Lewis, I find myself even more curious about this fascinating author who has so influenced my life.

So, I can recommend this to you if you are studying C.S. Lewis' life or you are curious about his childhood, marriage and emotional life. If you are looking for extensive details about the Chronicles of Narnia, you may be disappointed.

2499365,5,B000E6ES7Q,"I was entranced watching this short (just under 1 hour) film, which traces some of the major events in the life of Christian apologist and author C.S. Lewis. The story is told in flashbacks from the memory of an elderly Lewis, and the exquisite script is mostly culled from his writings. It makes one marvel at the beauty of the English language, and how descriptive it is. The scenes flow well, and though it is a mere sketch of a very complex and full life, one gets the sense of who Lewis was, how he lived, and the friends he knew, like J. R. R. Tolkien. He met Joy Davidman, an American mother of 2, in his later years, and this relationship brought Lewis love, as well as a crisis of faith, which is expressed with depth and sensitivity.

Anton Rodgers as Lewis, and Diane Venora as Joy give remarkable performances. There is an intimacy and realism to their portrayals that make the biography come alive, and stir our emotions. The direction by Norman Stone is excellent, and the production gives one the feel of what the first half of the 20th century in England was like. Co-produced by Faith and Values Media for the Hallmark Channel, and filmed in locations where Lewis worked and lived, ""Beyond Narnia"" is a gentle film that will be appreciated by anyone who admires his books, or those who enjoy literate scripts and good acting.",1159401600,42,1342,4.568464730290456
2499366,5,B000E6ES7Q,"I teach Lewis' Space Trilogy and Narnia Chronicles in different college courses and have, in the past, shown _The Magic Never Ends_ as an introduction to Lewis' life and beliefs. _The Magic Never Ends_ is very good, but a bit long and in need of some editing. I do value its unflinching declaration of Lewis' beliefs and clear articulation of the gospel.

_Beyond Narnia_ is dramatized - narrated by an older Lewis and complemented with flashbacks. It is a wonderful overview of Lewis' life and struggles - entertaining and accessible, engaging and moving. It wraps you into his life and makes you care about his struggles and triumphs. At the same time it presents his faith clearly, though it doesn't discuss Christianity with as much force as _The Magic Never Ends_. I especially appreciate that, though _Beyond Narnia_ deals with Joy's death and Lewis' reaction as outlined in _A Grief Observed_ it, unlike _Shadowlands_, clearly shows that Lewis returned to his faith in God.

My class of adult degree-completion students absolutely loved this film, and I did too. It's a basic, clear depiction with great emotional impact that stays very true to who Lewis was and the life he lived.",1157673600,23,1188,4.935
