Of course I never expected a serious documentary here, but I certainly didn't expect it to be so absurd.  Kudos to the actors for keeping a straight face delivering their lines, which incidentally you tend to hear looped repeatedly throughout the film as if the writer couldn't come up with enough monologue to fill even the paltry 1/2 hour run time of this movie.  I think the 5 star reviews posted here are about as real as the ""scientists"" depicted in the film.  I hoped this little story would be fun, not FUN-NY (as in, so stupid, all you can do is laugh). The A&E Biography series show on Santa Claus is wonderful, one of my favorites, and I had hoped this film would sort of take elements like that but present it more like a journey, as the title implies, but what could have been an entertaining concept fell flat on its face in the execution.",1283472000,2,979,4.386740331491713
8097318,5,B000CCIUV2,"This is an absolute must see for families of all ages. It is very well done, professional and sincere. Garanteed to  make a believer out of the biggest skeptic. Part of this documentary was an impetus for our family to see if we might be able to duplicate the Sobwodo's(sp)The world is not ready for what we captured on film. As an aside; we were not able to preview this film as was suggested (good idea by the way), so we squared our grandchildren up directly in front of the TV and we sat in the back of the room where we could absorb the full impact of what our eyes were seeing.",1169510400,2,583,4.15929203539823
8097319,5,B000CCIUV2,"This film re-ignites the wonder of Santa Claus!  The high production value, documentary style, and scientific edge make ""Search for Santa"" the perfect film to show a child questioning the existence of Santa Claus.  ""Search for Santa"" is guaranteed to add a few more years to your child's wonder about Old Saint Nick.

However, if you think this film is simply for children, think again.  For adults the film is an absolute joy as a mockumentary, with a multitude of scientists and Santa seekers delivering theory after theory of heart felt ""Clausology.""  The best part is when you stop laughing and ask yourself: ""Wait, are these people really serious?""  But, this thought only makes you laugh harder (I actually had to wipe the tears from my eyes to be able to clearly see the 8mm ""Swoboda Film"" section).

Seemingly shot in multiple locations, the production includes great effects, professional graphics and computer animations, superb sound and camera work, and wonderful narration, all set to the backdrop of traditional Christmas music well integrated into the pacing of the film.

Overall, I found ""Search for Santa"" to be a gem of an independent film.  One that I will keep next to my VHS copy of ""Christmas Story"" to be taken out, dusted off, and enjoyed each year during the Christmas season.  Definite thumbs up.  Old Kris Kringle would be proud . . . wherever he may be.

(For parents with younger children, make sure you watch the film before showing your children.  First to determine if they are old enough to understand the content and if the film will strengthen their belief in Santa.  Secondly, you will want to get your laughing out of the way so you don't tip them off).",1134518400,5,1691,4.786206896551724
