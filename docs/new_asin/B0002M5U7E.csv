2104086,4,B0002M5U7E,"Frosty's Winter Wonderland is the charming story of how Frosty met his snow-wife and how he overcomes the interference of Jack Frost.  It is a cute movie with good morals and enjoyable for children and adults.  It is also narrated by Andy Griffith and brought to life by the voices of Jackie Vernon and Shelley Winters.  'Twas the Night Before Christmas has been one of my favorite Christmas shows since I was a little girl.  It's the story of a mouse who wrote a letter to the editor claiming Santa Clause does not exist and signing it from ""all of us.""  So, Santa Clause decides he will skip that town on Christmas Eve.  But the clock-maker of the town, on return of his family's Christmas wish-lists in the mail, has a plan of how to show Santa that they do believe.",1126656000,8,769,4.418439716312057
2104087,5,B0002M5U7E,"FINALLY!!! These two have always been among our seasonal favorites, and my VHS copies were down to their last. Rankin & Bass rule the Holidays!",1101600000,11,143,4.76
2104088,5,B0002M5U7E,"Twas the Night Before Christmas was one of my favorite Christmas specials when I was a kid and it still is.

The story begins with a reading of Clement's The Night Before Christmas but creatures are stirring because they have learned that Santa is upset with their town and he isn't stopping to bring toys this year. The story is told jointly from a mouse/human perspective through a flashback to reveal why Santa is upset and how they hope to remedy the situation.

Other Christmas shows (such as Rudolph and Charlie Brown) have received more attention over the years but, in my estimation, Twas the Night Before Christmas belongs in the same lofty company. It's a great story and we got the DVD so our kids could enjoy the show too.",1101600000,19,734,4.595419847328245
2104089,4,B0002M5U7E,"Forget the Frosty show. If you want to see the best Frosty show, get the original ""Frosty The Snowman"" narrated by the late, great Jimmy Durante.
  The true gem in this DVD is getting to see ""Twas The Night Before Christmas"".  This is one of my all time Xmas favorites. It ranks up there with the original Frosty, Rudolph the Ned Rosed Reindeer, Santa Claus Is Coming to Town, Year Without A Santa Claus, and Mr. Magoo's Christmas.
  Like those other shows, Twas the Night Before Christmas has some memorable songs like: ""You wish and I'll worry, you play while I plan, we'll all do what's necessary, cause even a miracle needs a hand"".
  Also, ""Give up a little on the wonder why and give your heart a try"".  Lastly, ""Christams chimes are calling Santa, Santa, every heart is calling Santa, Santa. Come on Kris Kringle, down the Milky Way."" Enjoy this one and all the others.",1101427200,12,876,4.535031847133758
2104090,3,B0002M5U7E,"This budget-priced DVD combines two holiday specials from the Rankin-Bass archives, both produced with traditional hand-drawn animation instead of their trademark stop-motion Animagic process. ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"" features nightclub comic Jackie Vernon reprising his role as the warm-hearted snowman, and ""Twas The Night Before Christmas"" features George Gobel and Joel Grey in a heartwarming tale of a Christmas Eve miracle.

The two specials work well as a pair since they utilize similiar animation styles, and both use an underlying theme of love as a powerful force that changes the villain's cynical heart and turns him into a hero. Long-time fans of the Rankin-Bass specials will adore the sincere performances from the celebrity voice talents, especially the songs by Gobel and Grey.

This DVD will be treasured by anyone who longs for more innocent times when the world was a fun place to live. Watch it by yourself first so you can quietly shed a tear or two for your lost childhood, then share it with your children.",1100390400,10,1035,5.191616766467066

2104106,4,B0002M5U7E,"Since I finally got Frosty the Snowman this year, I was only missing one special I used to watch as a kid.  So when I found the bundle Frosty's Winter Wonderland/Twas the Night Before Christmas at a cheap price, I didn't hesitate to pick them up.

If you want the true Frosty sequel, look no further than Frosty's Winter Wonderland.  This half hour special was created in 1976, 7 years after the original aired.  Jackie Vernon returns as the magic snowman who comes to life.  While none of the kids have names this time around, they do look similar to the ones from the first special.

The story this time finds Frosty back from the North Pole for another winter of fun.  However, every night when the kids go back to their homes for the evening, he gets very lonely.  So the kids decide to create a wife for him.  Crystal (Shelley Winters) is brought to life, but their happiness might be short lived.  Jack Frost (Paul Frees) is very jealous of how much the kids love Frosty.  Will he conspire to ruin their happiness?

Watching this as an adult, I see how little story this one has.  But there is still something charming about it.  I was smiling through most of it as I watched it last night.  The kids don't really drive any of the story, instead its focus is Frosty, Crystal, and Jack Frost.  There is a fun bit with Parson Brown.  Yes, in addition to ""Frosty the Snowman,"" we get the lesser known second verse of ""Winter Wonderland"" during the special.  Andy Griffith steps into the Narrator roll and does a great job with it.

I had never seen Twas the Night Before Christmas before, but it's another half hour hand drawn animated special from the same company as Frosty.  It claims to be based on the famous poem, but that's a stretch.  The story revolves around a town that suddenly finds themselves in a horrid position.  All the letters to Santa are being return as rejected by the recipient.  While the humans, led by a clockmaker voiced by Joel Grey, try to build a clock to win back Santa's affection, the mice of the town find the real problem.  One of the mice has decided that Santa can't be real and wrote a letter the offended him.  Will they be able to convince Santa they do believe in him?

I was pleasantly surprised by this cartoon.  It features a decent story with two fun new songs.  The songs have a definite 70's feel to them, but since the special was originally released in 1974, that doesn't surprise me.  With the two story lines, the special actually moves forward rather quickly.  We do get the poem at the end, but it really could have been called anything.  This is definitely a special that will appeal to kids, and I'm sure it will become a regular in my Christmas special rotation.

The disc itself is only the two special; there are no extra features.  For the price I paid (about $7), I'm not complaining.  The picture and sound are fine.  They won't challenge your system, but they don't have to.

Neither of these specials are great entertainment, but they are fun light entertainment for the young and young at heart during Christmas.  I'm glad I picked up Frosty's Winter Wonderland/Twas the Night Before Christmas.",1431475200,,3161,4.511463844797178

2104143,3,B0002M5U7E,"I always felt that ""Frosty the Snowman"" was not near the top of the ladder of all Rankin-Bass holiday specials. So a sequel would of course be much lower, and that adequately describes ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland."" Besides being ho-hum all the way around, this one isn't even Christmas-themed, so I'm trying to figure out why anybody would go out of their way to watch it.

""'Twas the Night Before Christmas"" also is included here, although it gets second billing which to me is a mistake. This is perhaps the most unsung and overlooked of the best Rankin-Bass specials, with lots of heart and very good music (""Even a Miracle Needs a Hand"" is one of the best songs in Rankin-Bass history). On its own it probably would rate higher.

Another negative is that the DVD has absolutely no extras. Why don't ""making of"" specials exist for the extensive Rankin-Bass library? Would love to see something like that.",1356307200,,907,4.770700636942675

When the clock doesn't work on its first test, the townsfolk lose all faith in him.

2104150,5,B0002M5U7E,"I used to watch these classic holiday cartoons when I was a child, and I've continued to watch them over the years, whenever they were shown on television. I am happy to be able to share these holiday cartoons with my kindergartner who loves anything Christmas-related. These two shows have truly withstood the test of time. In ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"" (narrated and sung by Andy Griffith), Frosty the Snowman (Jackie Vernon) is delighted when his friends create a companion for Frosty, who is named Crystal (voiced by Shelley Winters). There is bit of awkwardness during the ""marriage ceremony"" which I found confusing to explain to my young child. The minister says he cannot marry Frosty and Crystal because they are snowpersons and only another snowperson can marry them! Oh well, we managed to get around that! Then there's Jack Frost who is trying to steal Frosty's magical hat. So there's plenty of drama to keep little ones and adults entertained.

In ""'Twas the Night Before Christmas"" (told and sung by Joel Grey), the classic Clement Moore poem comes alive with vivid animation and it always evokes fond childhood memories for me. There's also some additional drama. Santa becomes upset over a letter printed in the local Junctionville newspaper which bears some anti-Santa sentiments and decides to bypass the town on Christmas Eve. It is up to a mouse family and some humans to help put things right. I enjoyed Twas' the Night Before Christmas more than Frosty but they are both classic cartoons that embody the spirit of the festive season and can be enjoyed for many more years to come.",1292544000,,1605,4.922509225092251

""Twas the Night Before Christmas"" is a nice little take off of the poem.  It relates a young mouse's struggle with the science and intelect of the world with the faith and wonder of a perfect Child's world.  In the end he finds he must  ""let up a little on the wonder why.""  and then miracles do happen.

""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"" is not the Frosty you grew up with, and in my opinion not as good as the original. Frosty is kind of sad and the kids think he needs a wife.  They make him one, but Jack Frost isn't so sure they should be happy.  Andy Griffith is the narrator and he does a good job too.

The animation was as I remembered it, which means that it is far below the standards to which we have become accustomed.  It is more on the level of Dora the Explorer, with few colors and basic shapes, rather than on the technical, computer enhanced Pixar movies.

I acctually bought the DVD for ""Twas the Night Before Christmas"" and was pleasantly surprised by Frosty. This seems like it is the case with most people who purchase this DVD. The reason I felt compelled to comment about this DVD was ""Twas the Night before Christmas""

""Twas the Night Before Christmas"" is a creative retelling of the classic poem. Without getting into the particulars of the movie it is a touching look at wanting to please Santa not because he gives us ""stuff"" but because he is a person. Also, interesting but a unique touch to the movie is it's the adults that have no doubt that Santa is real and the children that sometimes need the hand in getting into the christmas spirit. The adult characters are as touched by the Christmas excitment as the children. Look for the tears in the eyes of the Joshua Trundle and Father Mouse as the awake to the sound of the clock on Christmas night and seeing Santa in their homes. This is a movie worth buying and its hard to forget songs will make this a classic in your Christmas library.",1165708800,2,1138,4.444976076555024
2104226,5,B0002M5U7E,"Two Christmas classics at a low price other DVD companies need to take notice.  I purchased this DVD mainly for Twas' a The Night Before Christmas, but found Frosty's Winter Wonderland to be a good winter special.  Frosty takes in the accounts of Jack Frost's jealousy and Frosty's need for a wife.  The story rounds out quite well.  Twas' a Night Before Christmas takes at the retelling of the classic poem.  This is the stronger of the two in my mind.  It does an excellent job of retelling the story while providing a quality side story for everyone's enjoyment.  Father Mouse's family really makes the show, ending the show with the poem is done quite well.

Video and Audio, what can be said I upgraded from a VHS and TV showings, they both look flawless in comparison.  I highly recommend the upgrade from VHS.

Overall, this DVD earns a spot on everyone's Christmas DVD shelve.  Take the time and sit down and watch them, they won't disappoint.",1165104000,,951,4.634730538922156

2104229,5,B0002M5U7E,"What a deal, two rare Rankin/Bass hoiday specials available for the first time on DCD, and we get 2 for the price of 1.

FROSTYS WINTER WONDERLAND:  Just like the song says, Frosty comes back again someday. Frosty returns to play with the children, but Jack Frost is envious of him. He tries to steal Frosty's magic hat to take his powers. The children build Frosty a wife named Crystal according to magic instructions from Frosty. When Jack Frost finally gets Frosty, it's his wife that must save him with love.

The studio that made the first hour long cel animated Frosty special that first aired on CBS television in 1969 is Rankin/Bass Productions, the kings of holiday specials. That show was based on the original song written in 1951 by Steve Nelson and Jack Rollins. The studio made a terrific half hour sequel in 1976 for ABC television titled ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"".  That special starts right where the first one left off.  The character design was by Paul Coker Jr., who did the same work for the first special, so the visual continuity works very well and the characters have that classic Rankin/Bass 'look'. He also did the unique lettering for the credits in both specials. The famous voice actor Paul Frees stars as Jack Frost, and the policeman. Frees was a regular in studio productions and had also voiced the policeman, ticket seller, and Santa Claus in the original. Jackie Vernon voiced Frosty just like he did before, and Selly Winters is his new wife. The writer for both Rankin/Bass shows was Romeo Muller, and Maury Laws returned as the musical director. Interestingly, while Rankin/Bassis known for the high quality of their original songs, they used Christmas standards in their sequel.  While the first show was narrated and sung by Jimmy Durante, the second time we had the voice talents of Andy Griffith. Nothing against Andy, but it is a big change.

'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS: The story of two families, one human family of Joshua Trundel the clockmaker, the other a mouse family that lives in their house. In Junctionville, all letters to Santa have been returned and the townsfolk are worried. Turns out that Santa is upset at a letter from ""all of us"" to the editor in the paper, saying that he didn't exist. A young genius mouse named Albert turns out to be the culprit. The town starts the Joshua will build a special clock to encourage Santa to come by singing a song ""Calling Santa"" at midnight on Christmas Eve. But the clock breaks down too. The people turn against Joshua, and he starts losing customers. Soon enough, his family is starving, and so in turn is the mouse family.  It is eventually found that Albert is responsible for the clocks malfunction but did not do it on purpose. He is sorry, but his dad encourages him that sorry is not enough, you must fix what you did wrong. If Albert can fix the clock in time, then Christmas may be saved yet, along with the reputation of Joshua.

Rankin/Bass Studio created this wonderful traditional cel animated special for CBS televison. It first aired on December 8, 1974 in a half hour format on CBS television. The screenplay was by Jerome Coopersmith, inspired by the Clement Moore poem, it does not literally follow the lines of the poem until near the end. The memorable song ""Calling Santa"" is one of best songs to come from the studio. Also has the songs ""Even a Miracle Needs a Hand"" (really good), and ""Give Your Heart a Try"". Character design was by Paul Coker, Jr. who designed the characters appearance for nearly every holiday special from the studio.  With musical direction by Maury Laws... Yes, he was the musical genius behind the Rudolph special and it shows. The songs are really good in this special. Lyrics were written by Jules Bass. The actual songs and narration are performed by Joel Gray, and he voices the character of the human father Joshua. Tammy Grimes stars as Albert Mouse, and George Gobel as Father Mouse. John McGiver as the Mayor.",1133827200,41,3974,4.721500721500721
2104230,5,B0002M5U7E,"While the stories of these two 1/2 hour Christmas specials don't have anything to do with one another, they both feature similar looking cel animation from the classic team of Rankin/Bass.  Frosty's Winter Wonderland and Twas the Night Before Christmas always seemed to air in the second half hour of a Christmas special hour block on network TV, but I wouldn't consider either one second rate.

In Frosty's Winter Wonderland, the sequel to Frosty the Snowman, we find Frosty able to choose the exact likeness of his new snow bride (don't we WISH we could all do this in real life) as the kids make her to keep him company.  This time, a magic hat won't work on her, only a special gift from Frosty.  They attempt to get married, but not if the snickering Jack Frost has his way.

The 2nd is the classic about a boy mouse who loses all faith in Santa Claus and decides to write him a nasty letter.  After that, Santa decides to cancel Christmas and the town must fix their musical clock, which will belt out the classic holiday tune, Santa We Need You Today, if they want Santa back.

Two great 70's specials from the kings of holiday television.  I think these go well together, despite the fact that Frosty the Snowman should have come doubled up with Frosty's Winter Wonderland on DVD and NOT the inferior, non Rankin Bass, Frosty Returns.  I think they have to do it that way, or no one would want to buy Frosty Returns on it's own!",1132876800,6,1436,4.471264367816092
2104231,5,B0002M5U7E,"The two animated Christmas specials on this disc should be considered near classics.  While Frosty's Winter Wonderland is nowhere near as good as the original, it's still very good and much better than a lot of modern day Christmas specials.  the Sequel was made in 1976, 7 years after the original and boasted a cast of Andy Griffith as the narrator taking the place of Jimmy Durante.  Comedian Jackie Vernon reprises his role as the voice of Frosty.  And Shelly Winters provides the voice of Crystal, the female snowman made by the kids to be Frosty's wife.  Only jack Frost (voice by the great Paul Frees) objects and tries to prevent the wedding.

Twas the Night Before Christmas is even better and really comes to be a near classic.  This is another great Rankin Bass production.  The Residents of a small town learn they are on Santa's naughty list when Santa gets a letter from someone doubting his existence.  Turns out the letter was sent by a little mouse living in the home of  Joshua Trundle.  Trundle tries to appease Santa by making a song play from the town clock to welcome him.  But the little mouse gums up the clock work and it fails...now the brainy little mouse has to fix the clock in time for Santa to make his rounds at the town.

George Goebel provides the voice of the father mouse who tries to teach his overly anxious son the error of his ways.  Joel Grey provides the voice of Joshua Trundle.  Features an excellent song, ""Even a Miracle Needs a hand""  A truly wonderful Christmas special.

All in all a pretty good set of basically second tier specials that are just a hair below classics like Rudolph and the original Frosty.",1132617600,3,1656,4.559322033898305

2104234,4,B0002M5U7E,"The follow-up to 1969's ""Frosty the Snowman"" updates the mythology by bringing Frosty back to the very town he was born. This time, winter fiend Jack Frost grows envious of the children's love for the snowman and attempts to stop their fun. Also in the mix is a new ""snow wife"" for Frosty! The real treat of this disc is the second feature: Rankin Bass' ""T'was the Night Before Christmas."" The animated tale is told from two families perspectives, one human, and another mice. The delightful tale has some of the most memorible songs in the Rankin Bass catalogue. The best part is that you'll be humming them all season long! Great stories of the heart with a positive message attached to both films.

This show is pure classic Christmas Special all the way. It's ranks right up there (as others have said) with Charlie Brown, The Snow Miser, and Rudolph.

I bought the VHS version way back when it first came out (probably 10-15 years ago) and I've lovingly enjoyed it every year. And I even found the soundtrack record on eBay! Talk about Christmas wishes coming true!

8029129,4,B0002M5U7E,"""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"" is a fun special to watch. Not as good as the original 1969 story, but fun nonetheless. Jack Frost is a spiteful sprite who's desperate for attention, but he isn't as compelling a villain as Professor Hinkel. Andy Griffith does a good job with the narration, and the caricature of him is as good as the one of Jimmy Durante. Griffith's rendition of ""Winter Wonderland"" was beautiful. All in all, not one of Rankin/Bass' strongest efforts, but a delightful story. Grade: B-

""The Night Before Christmas"" takes me back to when I was seven years old. The giant clock's spectacular malfunction was the one thing that stood out to me the most. Years later, I found the special again. It has the feel of a race against time. And the animation, especially during the songs, was beautiful. The songs, however, are rather forgettable, and not up to par with other gems Maury Laws has composed in Rankin/Bass specials of the past. Grade: B-",1512345600,,959,4.77710843373494

8029133,5,B0002M5U7E,"This is a beautiful movie, one of my favorite holiday classics I play every christmas. I bought this because I lost my old one. It's a beautiful story narrated by Andy Griffith and set after the events of Rankin Bass' Frosty The Snowman. As the first snow of the season arrives, Frosty comes back to visit the children and incurs the jealousy of Jack Frost. And in response to his loneliness when the children go home at night, Frosty and the children create a snow wife, named Crystal. The second story, Twas The Night Before Christmas, tells another charming tale of 2 families, a mouse family and a human clock maker's family, and their efforts to save Christmas after Father mouse's oldest son and his friends wrote a letter insulting Santa and causing him to boycott their entire town. Both have the memorable singable songs Rankin Bass Christmas shows are known for, and appear whole as originally shown.
