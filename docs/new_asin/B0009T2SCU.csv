8066382,4,B0009T2SCU,"This DVD is exactly what I expected and is helping me to grasp not only the fundamental of using the the GL-2 but also many of the other features which I didn't fully understand.  For me, this is a great purchase and one which I believe will improve my video projects.",1349395200,,268,4.254901960784314
8066383,5,B0009T2SCU,"real simple, definitely a low budget dvd. but EVERYTHING is covered. i went through this and had the manual with me, and it was great. i learned a ton. totally worth the 30 bucks!!!!",1209513600,,182,4.382352941176471
8066384,4,B0009T2SCU,This video guide was a nice way to introduce me to my camera.  It took me through the menus one by one and explained the basic functions of the camera.  It is great for the novice.  It doesn't go through any great detail on anything.  I was hoping for a few more tips to inspire me.  I still put it in the player from time to keep things fresh in my mind.  It is not confusing at all.,1195171200,,384,3.858974358974359
8066385,5,B0009T2SCU,"I had problems viewing on my laptop computer, but on my TV it is fine.  The levels are great for someone new to the Canon GL 2 and I think I will come up to speed 100X faster because of the video.  Not sure what the problem was on the Laptop which is a powerful Dell with dual core 2.0GHz CPU and 2 gigs of memory, but it was unviewable.  Again it is fine on the TV.  However, on a location shoot it would be nice to have it available with the laptop for a quick review.

Information level is great and well worth the price.",1185580800,,524,3.9056603773584904
8066386,5,B0009T2SCU,"Despite the review that gave it 3 stars I decided to get this DVD to see if I could get more use out of my GL2. I was pleasantly surprised. First of all - there was no problem with the sound as reported in the review (maybe he got a bad disk?). The DVD was very well organized. I started watching it from the begining but found that I wanted to skip around more and it was easy to find info on every part of the camera thru the menus on the DVD. I ended up watching some of the sections twice just to make sure I got it.  I actually learned stuff about how to change settings on the camera and it all worked. I've popped the disk in a couple of times to check out other things on it.  I finally decided to watch all the way through and learned more. It is a lot of information to take in at one time, and I'm not sure that's the best way to do it. I kept telling myself that I want to take a class on the camera - but couldn't find one (except a $300 one which was too expensive) and this was perfect for me. Perhaps if you're a very experienced cameraperson you won't need it as much as someone like me (more of a weekend-shooter) but I found the info on this DVD to be extremely helpfull to knowing this camera.",1160524800,7,1213,3.926829268292683
8066387,3,B0009T2SCU,"If your not into reading the highlights of the GL2 owner's manual or after reading it you're left with o.k. now what? This DVD is worth the price.  If however, you're looking for ALL the ins and outs of the GL2, then you'll be disappointed.  The DVD give you a good overall feeling for the components, features and basic functions of the GL2 along with some good advice when to use some of the features.  Its main flaw is poor overall sound quality, throughout the DVD the volume makes mysterious jumps up or down in loudness range such that you can't simply set the volumn level and forget it.  You'd think for a 6 year veteran videographer he'd have learned that lesson by now.

Overall, if you're begining with the GL2 & DV Camcorders its a good purchase, if you expect more than getting over the first hurdle of knowing your camcorder's features and functions don't buy it.",1153699200,7,877,4.525316455696203
