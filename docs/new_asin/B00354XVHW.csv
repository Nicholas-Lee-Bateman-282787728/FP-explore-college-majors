8388669,5,B00354XVHW,"This is a very fine concert indeed mixing the familiar with the unfamiliar. The familiar item is the concerto with Barenboim on top form and delivering a large-boned interpretation of the piano part. In this approach he is fully supported by Rattle and the orchestra.

The romantic manner of Barenboim's performance is made apparent upon his very first entry with a marked slowing down of the tempo set by Rattle with his orchestra. From then on there are no such discrepancies and the first movement settles down into a broadly lyrical interpretation rather than an overtly dramatic one. There is drama of course as that is built into the music itself. The distinction being made here is one of degree. The slow movement follows the same approach as does the last movement although the tempo is rather more up to normal speed. This approach to the concerto is emphasised by making the most of the heavier textures throughout and the BPO is well able to deliver on this.

The Schoenberg orchestration of the first Piano Quartet is completely engrossing and completely imaginative without becoming anything like Schoenberg's own New Viennese style of writing - the spirit of the original Brahms is fully maintained. The technical demands upon the orchestra are considerable but are overcome with aplomb. The audience clearly loved it even though it will have been unknown to most of them. The reasons Schoenberg gave for making the arrangement were threefold and are as follows:""I like this piece. It is seldom played. It is always very badly played, because the better the pianist, the louder he plays and you hear nothing from the strings. I wanted once to hear everything, and this I achieved."" In this performance, which achieves sparkle and brilliance, especially in the last 'zingarese' styled movement it is certainly possible to hear everything and Schoenberg would have been delighted I am sure.

There is an interesting bonus documentary of some 18 minutes which focuses on Athens, past and present, and the performing venue.

The whole concert is recorded with good surround sound in DD 5.1 and DTS 5.1 as well as stereo coupled with sympathetic camera work giving crisp imaging. In my opinion this concert is likely to give purchasers considerable pleasure in the concerto as well as some intriguing new experiences with the Schoenberg arrangement. It therefore seems reasonable to rate this at 5 stars.",1344211200,,2414,5.0275
8388670,5,B00354XVHW,"Both the piano concerto and the piano quartet are played with superlative interpretations under Sir Simon Rattle's conducting.  Barenboim understood the piano concerto piano part instinctively, and brings out the aggressive, taciturn rationalism that typifies the Brahmsian catharsis.  The piano performance brings out the archetypal Brahms sentiments of yearning for a more rational world, exasperation at severe sexual frustration, exasperation at being forsaken, and a taciturn premonition of human self-destruction.",1293926400,,519,6.4
8388671,4,B00354XVHW,"This concert, filmed during the 2004 Athens Olympics, begins with an excellent performance of the Brahms Piano Concerto No 1. Barenboim, despite his advancing years, displays a steely technique and seems to hold no fears for the technical challenges of this mighty concerto. He admirably portrays the drama of the work and, when appropriate, its tender poetry. Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic are sympathetic partners. The result is a memorable rendition of the Brahms First Piano concerto.

The concert proceeds without interruption to an enjoyable and rousing interpretation of the Brahms Piano Quartet transcribed for orchestra by Arnold Schoenberg. Although I prefer the purity of the chamber version, this version (with percussion aplenty) is invigorating and fun to experience. The orchestra and conductor certainly seem to be having a good time.

These performances occurred during the day and the audience is clearly visible. This fact, combined with occasional panoramic filming of the surrounding countryside and historic buildings, might prove distracting to some viewers. The sound is warm, accurate and clear. The video quality is very good.",1280793600,4,1157,5.568181818181818

8388673,5,B00354XVHW,"This DVD is a re-release of the DVD made at the 2004 'Europa Konzert' with the Berliner Philharmoniker playing at the Herodes Atticus Odeon amphitheater in Athens. It was conducted by Simon Rattle and has Daniel Barenboim playing the First Brahms Piano Concerto. The concert concludes with Schoenberg's scintillating orchestration of Brahms's First Piano Quartet. (I love that he used the xylophone in his orchestration. Crazy guy!) Also included is an 18-minute mini-travelogue about Athens.

Best of all this DVD is offered for a really bargain price. The reason, I suppose, is that the original booklet for the DVD is not included in the case. Instead you get the thick 2010 Euroarts & Id&eacute;ale Audience Catalogue.

Here is the review I wrote for this DVD at its original release in early 2005:

This is a DVD of the 2004 'Europe Concert' ('Europa-Konzert') by the Berlin Philharmonic at the Herodes Atticus Odeon in Athens, a huge, acoustically marvelous outdoor amphitheater dating back almost 2000 years. It is an all-Brahms concert, with Daniel Barenboim playing the First Piano Concerto in D Minor, Op. 15 and then the orchestra alone in the Sch&ouml;nberg orchestration of the First Piano Quartet (G Minor, Op. 25). Conductor is the then newly named music director of the BPO, Sir Simon Rattle. Interestingly, it's the first time Barenboim and Rattle ever played together. The 'Europe Concert' is a yearly concert played on 1 May to commemorate the founding of the Berlin Philharmonic on 1 May 1882 and each year it is in a different European location. This is the first of these that Rattle had conducted, but Barenboim has conducted the orchestra in three of them. The interesting documentary about the history of the Europa-Konzert includes clips from a number of them since their inception in the early 1990s. I have reviewed several of these here at Amazon.

Barenboim gives a heroic performance of the Piano Concerto and is matched brilliantly by the orchestra. Rattle is able to give the huge and dramatic introduction to the concerto the right amount of heft without it becoming shrill or muddy, as so often happens with lesser orchestras. The almost inhuman skill of this orchestra is on display repeatedly, never more than in the fugal section of the last movement where the thematic lines are handed off from instrument to instrument with quicksilver deftness. (But where did the always terrific principal oboist, Albrecht Mayer, get that godawful yellow necktie?) Barenboim caps his performance, earlier marked by both clarity and power, in the chain of cadenzas in the finale. A marvelous performance greeted with rapturous applause from the audience. In a nice gesture, when Barenboim is given a huge bouquet of spring flowers during the bows, he pulls out a couple and hands them to Rattle and to concertmaster Daniel Stabrawa.

Some people are surprised that that arch-radical Arnold Sch&ouml;nberg adored the music of Brahms who has come down to us as the epitome of cushioned and comfortable German romanticism. But of course Brahms was more classicist than romanticist and Sch&ouml;nberg not only admired him, he borrowed from him in his own music albeit transmuting its procedures (e.g. the 'developing variation form' from this work's first movement) for his own purposes. His orchestration of the First Piano Quartet (done at the request of Otto Klemperer) is, generally, fairly conservative and it is only in the Hungarian cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s finale that he cuts loose with some decidedly unBrahmsian orchestration, especially in his use of xylophone, glockenspiel, side-drum and cymbals, as well as trombone glissandos, brass double-tonguing, and divisi strings! No one comes away from this finale without a smile, though, and surely that is reason enough to justify its existence. Needless to say the BPO play the whole thing with great &eacute;lan. Rattle coaxes extraordinary expressiveness from his players throughout, molding phrases with utmost care. An exciting performance!

The videography is crystal clear, the editing unobtrusive and always apt, the sound very lifelike with the exception of some muddiness in the loudest tuttis, possibly a function of the concert's outdoors venue. This is of little importance in the overall impact, however.

Recommended.
