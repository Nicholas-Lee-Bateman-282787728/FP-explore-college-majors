2839774,2,B000QRIK3Q,"Have enjoyed ""Dirty Jobs"" on TV for years, but nearly $20 for ONE Episode (less than one hour!) is insane. There are three jobs in the episode, but there should be at least twice as much material for the price.",1189814400,2,210,4.275

Some of these episodes I've seen several times and they still have the ability to make me laugh or keep me clued to the TV.  Mike Rowe is just perfect in this show - I can't imagine this show being such a hit without his expert hosting.  Thanks, Amazon Prime, for making this show available!!",1389830400,,393,4.213333333333333

2839808,5,B000QRIK3Q,"I love Dirty Jobs! The more I watch the show the better it gets. It's funny because I look at the titles of some of the episodes and think, huh, that doesn't sound very interesting, but I watch them anyway and I have yet to be disappointed! The show is multifaceted in its excellence. One angle that is well plaid in this show is, of course, humor. Mike does an excellent job as a caricature working in all of these different jobs. He is the comedy relief that lightens the impact of just how nasty some of the highlighted jobs are. Another facet is that the show really gives a person some interesting information about different jobs, many of which, I have never personally realized existed. I had never thought about replacing sacrificial anodes in a sea wall but when I saw the episode it spurred me to do some research and replace the anode in my water heater! Yet another aspect of this show that I love is that it glorifies the worker. The people featured in this show are just regular folk but they make up the backbone of this great society that we all live in. I definitely get a better appreciation of my fellow man from watching this show.",1384905600,,1151,4.408450704225352

2839819,4,B000QRIK3Q,"I have 3 small children, so I like to find interesting shows that are appropriate for the whole family instead of just having kid shows on all the time.  We can all learn from this show and we all enjoy it, too.",1369440000,,211,4.023809523809524
2839820,4,B000QRIK3Q,"Mike Rowe always makes me laugh out loud. My sis comes into my room and asks, ""What's so funny?"" I tell her then we both start laughing. I did notice however that the jobs aren't that dirty like the first season. I guess that's why he asks us to contact him for more jobs. Love it when he came to San Diego! Whoo hoo! Wish I could have met him when he was here. Dirty Jobs makes you see what other people do for us, that we sometimes don't even think about it or take it for granted. But to those hard workers I say, ""Thank you for working hard!""",1369180800,,546,3.9727272727272727

2839828,4,B000QRIK3Q,"Mike Rowe, Dirty Jobs what more can I say. I do like this show but what made me give it 4 star instead of five was that fact that the shows were on the disc out of order, for whatever reason. Other than that it had me smiling the entire time.",1355443200,,242,3.764705882352941
2839829,5,B000QRIK3Q,"We will miss Dirty Jobs now that it has been cancelled.  The DVD's will be like ""MASH"" for my husband, which he will watch over and over again in his off time.  Not a bad thing at all.  Mike Rowe is fun to watch and brings a real dignity to the hard working men and women whose jobs he promotes on the show.",1354752000,2,307,3.8412698412698414
2839830,5,B000QRIK3Q,"I specifically searched for this episode on netflix.  That's when I found out that Netflix does not have every episode of a show within the seasons that they have available to watch.  For example, Netflix has like 6 seasons of Dirty Jobs currently available to watch but only the first half of the episodes in each season.  This episode was so gross I forced my husband to watch it and we both enjoyed it lol.  It played clearly on my computer through amazon and I would definitely buy an instant video from them again.",1346889600,,519,4.48936170212766

8197079,5,B000QRIK3Q,"""Dirty Jobs"" is always a gloriously filthy viewing experience, but season three, volume one is the best of the best. Here Mike Rowe undertakes some of his most disgusting challenges of the entire show, and the results are both educational and entertaining. Some of the jobs are just plain dangerous (""Water Tank Cooper"", ""Aerial Tram Greaser"", and ""Shingle Maker"" leap instantly to mind), while some are unspeakably nasty, including possibly the vilest of all jobs in the series, ""Slime Eels"", closely followed by ""Turkey Inseminator"", which taught me a lot about poultry that I never wanted to know. Other episodes of note include ""Floating Fish Factory"" (this one is profoundly nauseating), and ""Cave Biologist"", which I found to be terrifying in every single aspect (particularly when Mike got stuck).

This is Discovery's best series, and these episodes are the cream of the crop.",1485820800,2,884,5.181818181818182
