The Iago of Falk Struckmann completes the major players, seemingly affable but oh so malevolent.  Special bravos to the charming, well sung Cassio of Michael Fabiano.  Luxury casting!",1477612800,2,310,5.673913043478261
8709379,5,B00V5RRBF4,"Renee Fleming is perfect as usual, and Johan Botha is a menacing Otello in the best possible way. Saw this one Live in HD, and had to get it on DVD. This would be a perfect intro for someone who thinks they don't like opera, because this is a great opera done perfectly by all involved.",1454457600,4,286,4.125

All of the opera singing actors do excellent jobs with their portrayals. The conducting, orchestra and chorus are outstanding in this exciting performance! All in all, a performance to treasure!!!",1453248000,3,340,5.5576923076923075

THIS IS AN ""ALL REGION"" BLU-RAY DISC. It played fine on my 7 year old USA bought Panasonic Blu-ray player in beautiful DTS 5.1 surround sound.  Disregard Amazon's warning that this is a region B/2 Blu-ray disc.
I am reviewing the Blu-ray version of Verdi's Otello recorded in 2012 at the Metropolitan Opera with Johan Botha as Otello, Renee Fleming as Desdemona, Falk Struckmann as Iago, and Semyon Bychkov conducting the Met orchestra.

The Production:
This production has been seen before at the Met, and for good reasons they have brought it back for this season. The good reasons are that this is one of the most beautiful productions of Otello.  This production includes gorgeous period 15th century renaissance costumes designed by Peter J. Hall. And it places acts 2 and 3  in a grand castle in Cyprus with two very large red marble columns and marble floor. The lighting is generally dark and moody, very appropriate.

The Singing and Acting:
I found the singing to be excellent by all 3 leads as well as the smaller roles. The New York Times criticized Johan Botha's performance during the opening night, but this recording was done after he missed 3 performances due to a cold which did effect his voice during opening night. But he returned for this performance and I'm happy to say that he is in great voice, which is a beautiful medium light sounding and powerful tenor voice. I found Johan Botha to be much better than Aleksandr Antonenko who plays Otello at the MET this season that just aired in October 2015 as a MET HD Live broadcast. That new production also uses different and not as pleasing sets and costumes.  Antonenko's tenor voice sounds dry and not as attractive as Johan Botha's voice.  I also found Botha's acting to be very good with a terrifying death scene and touching words of love for his murdered wife. Renee Fleming is also in fine voice and she does an excellent job acting her part as Desdemona, newlywed and in love with her new husband, Otello. Renee's willow song and Ave Maria brought tears to my eyes. Falk Struckmann does a particularly great characterization of Iago. Michael Fabian as Cassio, is excellent. The Met chorus does a splendid job. Also, a special note, the Met uses real a real mandolin player and a real guitar player who actually play their instruments on stage, giving a refreshing bit of realism to the opera.

Orchestra and Conducting:
I found Semyon Bychkov interpretation to be generally good with great drama when needed and the Met orchestra superb. I think by this performance some of the problems of the opening night performance had been worked out by Semyon Bychkov. I thought the love scene was quite touching and not rushed or a violent drama like some critics said of opening night. The love scene in this performance was the epitome of ecstasy, elation and serenity in my opinion, beautifully sung and acted by Fleming and Botha.

Conclusion
I highly recommend this version of Otello. It is beautifully done all around with riveting drama and great sound by the Met's natural mic setup without body mics. Also, this may be the last time Renee Fleming does Desdemona. I rate it 4-3/4 stars which I must round to 5 stars.",1446249600,7,3206,4.751798561151079
