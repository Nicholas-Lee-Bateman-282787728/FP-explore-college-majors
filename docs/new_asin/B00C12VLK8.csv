8576114,4,B00C12VLK8,"I agree with the review regarding the advanced kit, which includes the jump rope and approx. 35 min of extra workout...what a rip off.  I paid an extra $65 from Beachbody for a piece of plastic (I thought that it would calculate calories) and 3 workouts.  The workouts add up a little more than a half an hour.  What a waste!

Prior to JNL Fusion I have done Turbo Jam, Turbo Fire, Insanity, and TapOut XT.  I do like the shorter workouts, which leave you feeling that you're really working your muscles, especially the glutes and leg DVD's.  Plus, you can adjust you're intensity by the weights that you choose.  However, make certain that you do a sufficient warm-up prior to starting the workout.  Overall, I like the JNL Fusion Advanced Kit...I just which that I had stayed with the original offer and not added the extra speed rope and 3 workouts.  They are just not worth the money.",1381536000,,888,4.534591194968553
8576115,4,B00C12VLK8,"I decided to get this upgrade mostly for the total body transformer DVD because a friend stated how much she liked that DVD and it's part of the schedule even though they don't include it (flipping ridiculous, but that's besides the point)

You actually expend more energy and use more muscles using this jump rope.  it was ridiculously hard for me to get the hang of it without hitting myself with the little nerf things (seriously uncoordinated) but once I get going watch out world.

I haven't tried the additional core DVDs yet as I'm pairing this with T25 because overall I find the JNL cardio workouts to be lacking and don't have time for extra videos (although they're only 9 mins long)",1381363200,,694,4.626016260162602
