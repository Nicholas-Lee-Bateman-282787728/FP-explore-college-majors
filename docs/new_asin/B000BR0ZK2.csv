8091199,4,B000BR0ZK2,"""L?Aubergue espagnole"" (= ""The Spanish apartment"") and ""Les poupees russes"" (= ""Russian dolls"") are two French films about young people trying to find their path in life. ""Les poupees russes"" is the sequel to ""L?Aubergue espagnole"". They are both directed by Cedric Klapisch, and have the same cast.

""L'Auberge Espagnole"" allows us to see what happens in a year in the life of Xavier (Romain Duris), a young man from France who has been promised a job in the French bureaucracy if he is fluent in Spanish. Thus, he applies to the Erasmus programme, in order to study in Barcelona (Spain) for a year. Xavier leaves his parents and his girlfriend Martine (Audrey Tautou) behind, but he meets lots of new people and survives to cultural shock. He also starts an affair with the lonely wife of another Frenchman, and goes to Economy classes at the university. But what will charm the viewer is the chaotic life Xavier will have in the apartment he will share with other foreign students. In a way, the apartment is a little piece of the European Union, with people from Italy, Germany, Denmark, Belgium, Spain and France. Of course, there are lots of linguistic misunderstandings, but also an enormous amount of amusing situations and good-natured fun.

""Les poupees russes"", released a few years later, is better than ""L?Aubergue espagnole"", due to the fact that it ties some plot holes, and allows us to see what happens to the characters. Are they mature, or merely older? And what happened to Xavier (Romain Duris), the young man from France who wanted to be a writer?

Notwithstanding the fact that you don?t need to watch ""L?Aubergue espagnole"" before ""Les poupees russes"", doing so will give you more insight into what is happening, so I think it is worthwhile. In that sense, buying this two dvds at the same time is a good idea.

On the other hand, even though these films are entertaining, I think it is better to rent them. The reason for that opinion is that I do not believe they are the kind of movie you can watch 20 times, like ""Casablanca"". They are fun, but not classics. If you are okay with that, go ahead and buy them, but don t expect more of these movies that entertainment and some interesting dialogue.
