2814580,5,6305012164,"If you are a naturalist and wildlife enthusiast, then this box set is for you. Includes all episodes of all 12 seasons of the high-quality series that first aired on PBS for most of the '80s and early nineties. Some of the production aspects are dated, of course, such as the orchestral arrangements for the soundtrack and haircuts and fashion, but other than that this series is a feast for the eyes and the mind. The footage is very compelling, from close-ups of the animals in dynamic behaviour  to panoramic views of all wildlife sanctuaries in America, from Yellowstone, the Rockies, the Everglades, Alaska and much more! Beyond tons of great animal action and sound explanation of their biology and ecology, the series shares practical advice on how to observe wildlife in the outdoors and the importance of conservation.

While I consider this terrific family ""edutainment"", be informed that there are dramatic scenes of chases and predation that are bloody and often ends with the cute animal being killed and eaten by a predator. While most adult nature enthusiasts understand this is an essential facet of animal life, such scenes could upset young children. In any case, the narration consistently reminds of the ecological imperative of predation and avoids sensationalism, so in fact it might be a good way to introduce your kids to ""animal violence"".

This is a labour of love and a celebration of wildlife. ""Wild America"" was a series that always respected the natural world and the intelligence of the audience. Highly recommended!",1226880000,14,1547,5.03515625

2814582,3,6305012164,"I always enjoy the Stouffer Bros. films. This film was no exception, although I was very disappointed that there was no narration. I purchased this video after watching the television version and couldn't wait for my friends to see it. Marty does not talk on this film, just music. What a shame.",992563200,2,295,4.6923076923076925
2814583,4,6305012164,"Although an older movie, It has excellent, once in a lifetime footage of the entire array of predators from weasels to cougar and grizzlies.  The video presents the role of predators in nature's complex system and dispells some of the inaccurate information provided us as children about the ""big, bad, wolf""  and other fairy tales. The movie would be suitable for children 10 years and older.  It has been one of the better wildlife movies on the market.",983836800,,455,4.8076923076923075
2814588,2,6305012164,I love the show for the years it was out.  And for the price I paid for it and being a collection set that the dvd's could  have been in a collective sleeve's instead of single paper sleeves. And coping quality is not good. The product is not worth the price I paid for it.,1282435200,,273,3.9454545454545453
2814589,4,6305012164,"If you watched Wild America on PBS as I did as a kid then you know what you're in for.  I find myself truly in awe of the sheer amount of effort put into shooting and collecting the footage for every episode.  Marty and his crew mastered the entertaining and informative documentary.  I'm so glad this show exists on DVD now.

At the end of many episodes, Marty mentions the existence of man-made plights for the flora and fauna covered in the episode, and recommends paths to take to attempt a positive resolution.  Therefore I find it unfortunate that the packaging for this DVD set is so wasteful.  The box is about half-filled with DVDs, and half-filled with cardboard molding to make it look larger from the outside.  This (seemingly) air-headed, irrational design detracts from the perceived value of Marty's great work.",1266364800,,826,4.774647887323944
2814590,5,6305012164,Marty Stouffer is the best narrator/wildlife advocate in America.  He tells about every animal he shows and isn't overly preachy.,1263600000,2,129,5.45
2814591,5,6305012164,These are excellent nature films for anyone who loves nature. I purchased them for my husband who has always liked Marty Stouffer. These make for great enjoyment for the entire family.,1257811200,3,184,4.967741935483871
2814592,5,6305012164,"This is a one of a kind TV Documentary Series.  Marty Stouffer's Wild America is outstanding.  The Cinematography is second to none. I highly reccomend this series for adults and children.  It is one of the most educational series I've ever seen. For wildlife enthusiasts, this series is the very best.",1246752000,4,302,4.882352941176471
2814593,5,6305012164,"As others have mentioned this is a very comprehensive wildlife series and an excellent value. Some of the episodes are a bit dated by today's standards if compared to recent nature shows that you may catch on National Geographic HD. However the filming techniques used were certainly ahead of their time. The series is a pleasure to watch and spanned many years, some of the later episodes seemed to be influenced by ""Dances with Wolves"" which is nice and his children participated in some of them, particularly his daughter Hannah. Marty Stouffer did an outstanding job in narrating these episodes and of course the field footage he gathered is often breathtaking. It does not contain the often promoted ""Dangerous Encounters"" DVD. I bought the series a few months ago and have watched every episode usually in the company of my 4 year old daughter who enjoys it as much as I do. I would recommend this series to anybody with a love of nature and wildlife. It can also be used as an entertaining educational tool for children as well as adults.",1242000000,3,1045,4.747252747252747

2814595,5,6305012164,"I had high hopes when I bought this complete dvd set of the Wild America series. I was not disappointed. The video quality is very good. Everyone that I watch this with comments on how superb and fascinating the Wild America programs are. I sometimes take a disc with me when visiting a friend or relative. When the program starts, everyone is transfixed by nature's beauty that is captured in this excepional tv series. Marty Stouffer does an excellent job of filming and providing commentary on the many wild animals and scenic locations. I never get tired of watching this, and 120 episodes on 24 discs is a lot of material to watch.
I can honestly say that this is one of the most worthwhile investments that I have ever made, one that the entire family will enjoy.",1231286400,10,769,4.579710144927536
2814596,5,6305012164,An excellent family viewing experience. Though the sharpness of the DVD does not compare with Blue Ray the scenery is spectacular. A well done series which I watched on PBS many years ago and now share with my wife and grandchildren. Highly recommended.,1229817600,7,253,4.906976744186046

What people don't know about this is that there is an amount of 'wildlife fakery' involved, where they take captive animals and put them in dangerous situations to make the show ""exciting"".

8189852,4,6305012164,"I bought this collection for my boyfriend for Christmas. We love watching these dvds with friends/family and Mary Stouffer's presence to the show is great. I love the way he speaks and I often find him (unintentionally) funny.

They're extremely informative and still very interesting and entertaining (for the most part; There have been a couple on the boring side. I think some of the ""birds"" ones were less interesting).

I liked the packaging and I like that the box has a little plastic carrying strip attached at the top. I know another reviewer said they wished it had separate cases not individual paper sleeves, which I can appreciate, but I don't think it really takes away anything from the set. It's well displayed and a great gift or just individual purchase that will last a LONG time.",1299110400,,799,4.782608695652174
8189853,4,6305012164,"I purchased this item for my husband for Christmas and we have enjoyed the wild life viewed on these dvds.  Marty's views seem to be anti-everyone and the information is very old and at times incorrect but my husband enjoys the photography of the animals.  I am glad for the purchase, but Marty just doesn't have the greatest information on the animals he recorded.

He used at least three different bears to represent on baby bear in the two episodes of the Man who loved bears.

we laugh a lot.",1294531200,,496,4.477777777777778
