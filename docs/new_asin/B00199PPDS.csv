3430381,3,B00199PPDS,"No, this ""independent"" film has nothing to do with skiing or even a mountain. I have no idea why writer/director Sarah Schenck chose it. (Actually, it might have made SOME sense if the original title sequence  - included as a ""deleted scene"" - had been used. It shows the leading actors playing in the snow on a slope.)

The firm won an award for Best Film at the LA Broad Humor Festival and I guess that makes sense as it certainly is filled with ""broad humor"" (and, no, I'm not making a pun about the naked female cast). There's plenty of nudity in the film, though none frontal and all being done for fun.

Underneath the humor and satire of the budget porn industry there is a more serious story about a husband who wants a family and his wife (an independent film director - much like Schenk- who makes feminist films and doesn't seem to be interested in ""making a baby"").

Filmed on a fairly small budget (it shows), this will not win any big acting awards but I've certainly seen worse. It was interesting to see two alternate endings to the film. I think it would have made more sense to use one of those. Then again, I'm not the Director and she made the choice.

The images appeared to not be as crisp and clear in the first 20 minutes or so of the film, but then sharpened up. Maybe Schenck was using a lower grade of film.

Anyway, it's worth watching once. Just don't look for any skiers in the film!

3430419,4,B00199PPDS,"The story was good and the acting was what you would expect from a comedy (silly at times but sweet and decently thought provoking at others).  It was a fun film about people dissolving some of their hard held beliefs in the face of reality, and learning how to be more well rounded humans because of it.  Good stuff.

If you aren't a fundamentalist, or a prude, and are capable of delivering ""physical"" (didn't want to say sexual since it looks like a lot of religious people have reviewed this film :) pleasure in your relationships, then you will probably enjoy this film.",1371427200,3,575,4.563106796116505

8273072,5,B00199PPDS,"i liked this movie, it was light and airy. It eluded to the fact that ""Porn"" isn't a dirty thing to look down on, it can be a freeing experience for not only those who watch, but, also for those who want to bring some spice into their real life. This movie shows that ordinary people CAN enjoy ""Gadgets and Fantasies"", and shouldn't cater to the societal prudish pressures of judgmental groups with archaic agendas.

8273074,5,B00199PPDS,"I'm sorry, but I disagree with most of the raters.  The story is cute and believeable.  The acting was fine.  It was about porn but was not porn.  The story develops well and smoothly.  The dialog is pretty smooth.  The line delivery was natural and smooth.  The scenery was not lavish but was adequate for the story.  Sometimes a low budget film can be better because there is more emphasis on the acting and less on the set. I will purchase this film so I can watch it whenever I want to.  It is not grossly presented and the nudity and sex scenes are a natural part of the story and not overly emphacised or contrived or added just to increase the rating.  If you and your spouse are open minded, enjoy the film.  If you sre not, watch someone who is initially like you be transformed.  The film may also ask the question ""what is porn?""  Is a film porn just because it has explicit sex in it? Or does it have to exploit sex to be porn?",1429920000,6,939,4.17877094972067
