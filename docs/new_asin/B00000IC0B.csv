8270394,5,B00000IC0B,"Another great product from the folks at Winstar/Audio Galaxy, marvelous and beautifully restored treats await you in this booming Sci-Fi package. Each cartoon looks positively stunning and sounds as big as the year's biggest blockbuster, some folks on here have gripes over the added sound, but I love it, I'm sure if foley sound was around back then, they would have used it. The most spectacular films on this disc are ""To Spring"" and the two ""Max Fleischer's Superman"" shorts, they just blow me away. The added intermissions and horror preview really take many of us back to the days of the drive in movie (before movie prices were in the double digits) and are splendidly placed on the disc. The added features are marvelous as well, and each cartoon, when selected, gives you the option to read up on the history of it's production, creators and characters. The Restoration Demo was excellent, these people really know how to get the job done.",1413244800,,948,4.822085889570552
