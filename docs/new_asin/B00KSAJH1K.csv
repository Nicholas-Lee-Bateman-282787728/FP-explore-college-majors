After watching it on the (in retrospect) lackluster quality DVD countless times before the HD remaster, I never would've guessed it'd look this good. I dare to say it's almost like watching a whole new movie, you can see things so much clearer now. Another film that has always looked like total crap on VHS and Bluray that is totally worth watching again on Blu is Troll 2.",1511568000,,481,4.2967032967032965
