It's from 1999, so you won't see all the hype about tiger woods and the more recent golf stuff, but for a newbie to golf or the serious golfer, it's a great watch.",1228435200,8,326,4.078125

8062518,5,B0009K7RYS,"We have taken up golf again after some years of absence.  We watched this last night and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Some interesting history.  I looked up Arnold Palmer, as we were wondering how old he is now, and discovered his 86th birthday had just been the day before!  Fond memories of my dad watching him on TV in the 60's, and I was a little girl paying attention to what Daddy liked.  We didn't know a lot of things about some of these great golf pros and certainly not this much about the history of golf.  Very nice Friday evening entertainment.
We topped it off with the movie Pat and Mike with Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy (she's a lady golfer and its filmed at Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, Calif which was built in the 20's and has some great history)",1442016000,,782,4.433566433566433

8062526,3,B0009K7RYS,"Though the game of golf was invented outside the US, and much of the drama takes place outside the US, this documentary is about American golf. Some amazing photos, but few good stories.  With such an interesting topic, the History of Golf could have been fascinating, but it isn't.",1253232000,3,282,4.755102040816326
