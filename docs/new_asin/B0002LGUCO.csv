8028971,5,B0002LGUCO,"If you enjoy art technique videos with happy little trees and happy little clouds - you won't enjoy this one! However, if you appreciate a large variety of useful techniques and clear explanations of why it works like it does, this is the one for you. There are no representational images, only abstract, although any of the techniques will apply to representational artists.
George James demonstrates acrylic paint used like watercolors with wet into wet, like oils with full-bodied paint, stamping with assorted items, blotting, rolling, misting with water and quite a few more techniques. He shows what happens when the under-layer has been allowed to dry and what happens when you deal with it wet. On Yupo, the effects and results are different than you'd find with any other base. The result was a painting about paint - and a pleasing one at that.",1468281600,2,854,4.896551724137931

8028973,5,B0002LGUCO,If you are interested in Yupo this is the best video available hands down.  I have several and this is WAY BEYOND all of them put together!  George James knows what he is doing and is able to explain it so well.  Easy to understand.  He has made Yupo and absolute JOY to me!!!,1422316800,4,276,4.055555555555555
8028974,5,B0002LGUCO,Covers the techniques wonderfully.  George is very clear and explains things very well.  Love this video.  I do wish he would tell us if he uses a fixative after completion of a painting.  I also want to know if Kimdura paper works the same because I have a lot of Kimdura paper.,1324944000,7,279,4.3076923076923075
8028975,5,B0002LGUCO,I saw this video in  class a few years ago and would love to own it. Yupo is like nothing else and this video really creates the desire to explore and master it. Please let me know if ever you get it in stock again.,1237420800,8,215,3.7777777777777777
