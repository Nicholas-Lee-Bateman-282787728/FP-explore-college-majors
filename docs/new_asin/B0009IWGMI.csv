2293703,2,B0009IWGMI,"I am a long time Abbott and Costello fan. I grew up watching their films on sunday mornings. I've seen all their films, but this one for me, is not one of the best. In fact, I have no hesitation in saying that these two films are their worst. Africa Screams was their first film. Hence, they're not the stars of the film. Jack and the Beanstalk is just plain stupid. One thing in common with all the Abbott and Costello films is that all of them are funny; some of them are funnier than others. Some are just outright funnier; this is not one of them.",1346803200,4,551,4.158878504672897
2293704,1,B0009IWGMI,We just received this DVD and the quality is so poor that we couldn't watch it.  It is blurry and makes a person sea sick trying to focus on the scenes.  We also ordered vol. 4 of the Best of Abbott and Costello and the movies are sharp and clear.  Would have given it a lower score but there is no lower score.  Completely useless!,1328486400,8,332,4.061538461538461
2293705,4,B0009IWGMI,"Remembered this movie all these years ago, (approaching 60,) because it's one that sticks with you. Jack is the ever polite, honest, giving, protective boy who strives for everything good and rich in life. Because he believes the best in all people, the ordinary beans become magical. My grandkids faces were a sight as I watched them watch this movie, answering their innocent questions. The youngest used to watch ""Cars"" everynight before going to sleep; now it's ""Jack."" That says something about old movies. The songs ""I fear nothing when I'm in the right"" and ""He never looked better in his life"" were great. And for the price I paid, a real deal.",1296864000,,652,4.778761061946903

2293708,4,B0009IWGMI,"I loved Abbot & Costello as a kid, so got this and one of their ""scary"" ones for my kids.  At first they had to get used to it, but ultimately loved it:)",1275955200,,153,3.6363636363636362
2293709,5,B0009IWGMI,"This Abbott and Costello movie is as silly and immature as the rest of their movies, but Jack and the Beanstalk is a favorite with all the kids under 8 in all of my extended family.  THey LOVE it and will watch it over and over again.",1259712000,7,234,3.978723404255319
2293710,5,B0009IWGMI,"Africa Screams is a perfect example of why A&C is the greatest comedy team of all time.  There are sight gags aplenty in this classic.  Even included are the stereotypical African savages with their cannibal soup and nose piercings big enough to fit elephant tusks through them.  Also, Shemp Howard shines in his guest role as the nearsighted Gunner.  Just about the only negative in this film is the addition of Joe Besser.  He was awful as the 3rd stooge and he's awful here.  But fortunately he does not have a major role, and his appearances are limited.  In the end, however, not even the annoying ""comedy"" of Joe Besser can ruin this great movie.

Jack & The Beanstalk is not great, but it is watchable. Plus, you have to consider that it was targeted at children rather than adults.  While there are many corny moments, there also are some memorable acts sprinkled throughout the film, one being the fight scene between Jack (Lou) and the giant toward the end.  However, try to ignore the acting of the two romantic leads in the movie, and have your remote handy so you can forward through the parts when the two sing to each other. They are quite nauseating.  On a trivia note, Beanstalk holds the claim to fame of being the very first A&C movie to utilize color.  Using the Wizard of Oz concept, the film begins and ends in B&W but the vast majority in the middle, Jack's dream, is recorded in color.",1122681600,,1409,4.525691699604743

2293723,4,B0009IWGMI,"Africa screams is riot! Especially when Lou Costello saves a gorilla and the gorilla falls in love with him. One scene kept me in stiches when the gorilla shows up when Costello is eating lunch.
Jack and the Beanstalk was a little corny with it's music. However, Costello and Buddy Baer (The Giant) steal the show.",1394064000,,314,4.625
2293724,5,B0009IWGMI,"Bud Abbott & Lou Costello were two of the most successful comedians to ever grace the silver screen, & continue to do so on your television screens! Here are two of their most hilarious films in one neat package: the first is a funny retelling of the famous fairy tale 'Jack & the Beanstalk', in which Lou Costello dreams about as he reads it to a child he's scheduled to babysit for a night. The result is hilarity as only Abbott & Costello can deliver! The second is 'Africa Screams', co-starring the unforgettable Shemp Howard (who was taking over for Curly as one of the Three Stooges) & Joe Besser (who would be with Moe & Larry several years later as a member of the zany trio) as the boys travel to Africa & encounter wild dangerous animals, a hostile tribe, & crooks all in one as they search for a valuable treasure! The ending is to die for, being one of the most hysterical in all their pictures! Be sure to have this two-pack in your stack if you're a fan of A&C!",1392249600,,975,4.304347826086956

2293726,5,B0009IWGMI,I purchased this for viewing with my 4 and 7 year old grandsons.  They loved it and loved Abbott and Costello. An old classic that holds up over time.  It is timeless comedy.  Gary T,1378425600,,182,4.142857142857143
2293727,5,B0009IWGMI,"Laughter is good for everyone and laughter is abundant in these movies. In Africa Screams young people won't recognize the famous African explorers of A&C's day, but that does not detract from the overall fun provided. Meanwhile, children and adults should both appreciate their variation on the Jack and the Beanstalk tale.",1376697600,2,324,5.25
2293728,5,B0009IWGMI,"I really enjoy Abbott and Costello movies. I find them funny, usually well plotted and clean. No bad language or overtly risque scenes. Something I would show to young kids with no thoughts if it is appropriate.",1372550400,2,211,4.72972972972973
2293729,5,B0009IWGMI,"the Universal collection (which i reviewed not long ago), is certainly a treasure, but it's an incomplete treasure. Bud & Lou made eight films elsewhere, which copyright laws and whatnot prevented Universal from incorporating. the double feature inherent here seems to be the best known and/or loved example(s).
AFRICA SCREAMS seems to be their single most beloved non-Universal film. ironically, i've heard that it was all but forgotten for a few decades there. it just didn't get all that much televisions airplay or distribution for whatever reasons. whereas since the advent of home video, possibly due to it's public-domain status, SCREAMS may well of become the single most accessible Abbott & Costello exploit.
the story finds two bookstore clerks lured into an African safari, when an icy femme fatale (Hillary Brooke in her inaugural Abbott & Costello performance) gets the idea that the one played by Costello knows the location of a lost diamond mine. Lou's character is named Stanley Livingstone in a not-so-subtle tip of the hat to Sir Henry Stanley and Dr. David Livingstone (of ""Dr. Livingstone, i presume"" fame). even the world's most famous big game hunters, Clyde Beatty and Frank ""Bring 'Em Back Alive"" Buck, stop by to get in on the fun. the title lampoons a then-recent documentary film called ""Africa Speaks.""
Hillary Brooke has such marvelous chemistry with the boys, left such an indelible mark, that it's easy to forget she was a part of only three Abbott & Costello productions, namely AFRICA SCREAMS, ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET CAPTAIN KIDD, and their tv series. speaking of which, the film also features one Joe Besser, who's whining sissy character is only a Little Lord Faultleroy suit away from the ""Stinky"" character he played on the same series.
in a curious twist of fate, the film also features Shemp Howard. Besser is of course best remembered as the last-ditch Stooge, who's late-'50s attempt to replace the recently deceased Shemp didn't quite pan out.
incidentally, a classic bit of Bureaucracy In Action was triggered by AFRICA SCREAMS. there's a running-gag that an ape has taken a liking to Lou. Hollywood's live-in censors, The Breen Office, leapt to rather extreme conclusions - which had in no way shape or form come up in the script - and insisted that there be no suggestion anywhere that the ape might be a female. so...bestiality is permissable, provided the animal is gay? hey, it makes as much sense as that Depression-era edict where a man and a woman could go to bed together, provided they each kept one foot on the floor.
(i've noticed it always seems to be the outraged ""guardians of Morality"" who come to these conclusions. during the infamous PMRC hearings of the '80s, Twisted Sister singer Dee Snider famously said ""hey, i can't help it if Tipper Gore's got a dirty mind."" Bud & Lou couldn't help it if The Breen Office had a dirty mind, either.)
JACK & THE BEANSTALK is less of an achievement than SCREAMS but only slightly less charming. since Lou Costello never quite grew up (at least not all the way), he was ideally suited to the role of the world's most reknown giant killer. the story finds Bud & Lou, in a black-&-white ""real"" world, hired to babysit what may be the single most precocious brat on Earth. Costello tries to read the story to the boy, but himself gets so caught up in it that he finds himself fantasizing the role, at which point the film un-fades to color, WIZARD OF OZ-style. whether the film is your cup of tea or not depends on how you feel about geniues like Bud & Lou ""reducing"" themselves to this sort of thing (particularly considering that they do none of their burlesque routines in the film). for myself, my love and/or admiration for the team is such that i can enjoy it. indeed, given the childlike loveablity of Costello's standard character and the fact that chldren were so much of their fanbase, one can't help wondering why they aimed only one film at that particular demographic.
interestingly, BEANSTALK and the aforementioned Captain Kidd film were done for Warner Brothers under a unique arrangement: according to their contract, Lou owned BEANSTALK outright, and CAPTAIN KIDD was Bud's property.
one interesting bit if serendipity is the basis for a comparison of that lauded weakness of so many comedy films from the couple decades or so before television, the romantic subplot and/or banal musical numbers which more often than not (at least by our current standards) just get in the way. SCREAMS has no such padding, which some will inevitably say contributes to it's popularity.
BEANSTALK, on the other hand, is all too guilty as charged. Shaye Cogan and James Alexander were nominated for the title of Very Worst Romantics ""Leads"" Bud & Lou Got Saddled With long before it occured to me that they were. it's music is a slightly happier affair, but ultimately a mixed bag. it features easily the cleverest wordplay ever heard in a song in an Abbott & Costello movie, but sets it to what just might be the most saccharine arrangements you'll ever hear in a song in an Abbott & Costello movie.
well, i'm afraid i haven't got anything new to say on that score. i for one am such a fan, an admirer, of Abbott & Costello that to me, their contributions make up for it, so i'm willing to weather that particular storm. some might think their powers are dissipated, even neutralized, for it, but i don't.
i say the magic that is Abbott & Costello never fades. these and the six other films they made away from Universal are just as worth seeking out. (yes, even their prosaic swan-song, DANCE WITH ME HENRY.)",1370908800,5,5608,4.800413650465357
