8348738,4,B0020ZKSNW,The Stockholm suburb of Fiskstra is the setting for this love story between two neighbors. It's an enjoyable film which kept me interested for the duration. The acting from the two main performers is decent and believable. Definitely worth a watch!,1340236800,,248,5.073170731707317
