8043216,2,B0006U3U6U,"First off, I am going to say right away, this is NOT a video about Traci Bingham, it's really about the girls of Baywatch. Traci Bingham just happens to be IN the video, but she is not the main star of this video. So the title of this is totally misleading to those who just want to see 60 minutes of Traci Bingham. This video should have been called ""Babes Of Baywatch With Traci Bingham"".

Now, don't totally reconsider this video, just understand that Traci Bingham is not to main star or even the main focus of this video. The video shows lots of girls at the beach, stripping and posing for the camera. The only real down side is that quality of the video is really bad, including the sound. The video looks like it was done with a low budget, low cost,  VHS camera with no proper microphone setup for the girls. Plus, the music is really played badly in this video. Who ever produced this video didn't even try to consider the quality of the overall video, it just seems like they recorded it and just decided to go with what they got and then try to sell it. There was no real production or direction of any kind, other than say a few lines and then strip nude.

If my opinion, I would recommend any other video with nude girls, just not this one. Although it's not bad, you may want to reconsider getting something with better quality video and sound. Unless you don't really mind bad sound and bad background music, then sure, it's not a really bad video to watch when you're home alone. Just don't expect the best quality of any kind. Sadly, the DVD cover shot that you see is actually a really bad ""cut"" and ""paste"" job from Photoshop, as one piece of the art is from another video. That alone should tell you what this video is like. Cheaply made, cheaply produced, and most importantly, something that should have stayed in the corner of some dusty closet. What's really sad is, what ever conversion that was used to convert from VHS to DVD was not done very well or at least the VHS tape was not of the best quality they could have gotten. Please, consider getting another video.",1374278400,2,2093,4.375321336760925

8043218,1,B0006U3U6U,"This is a 60 minute waste of time. The picture quality is awful. Tracey Bingham is only in the thing for ten minutes and half of that is talking about herself and the other half she is wading in the ocean. This looks liked it was filmed before she was even on baywatch. I have no ideal who the other ladies are but none of them look like they could even be on baywatch. As far as comparing herself to Pam Anderson is like comparing malt liquor to a fine wine. Dont get me wrong, I think Tracey is a beautiful woman or I would not have bought the dvd. But I think she can do much better than this.",1116633600,12,596,3.975
