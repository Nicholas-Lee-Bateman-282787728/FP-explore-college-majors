4670195,1,B005EZRWKM,All of the videos in the dvd are blurry. It's very hard to make out what's going on. It was a total waste of money and time. Great disappointment for Amy winehouse fans,1331424000,6,168,4.121212121212121
4670196,3,B005EZRWKM,"it was good a little dry but it was interesting to see her transformation from a young performer and how excited she was to a some what angry rock star....she was so grateful in the beginning, and then so angry is the best word towards the end.",1447977600,,244,4.212765957446808

4670200,5,B005EZRWKM,Amy Winehouse is awesome. She is a legend and always will be. This video will prove how she transformed and how amazing her journey as been. It has inspired me.,1400112000,,160,4.366666666666666
4670201,1,B005EZRWKM,"About 5 or 10 minutes of interviews would have been enough.  She doesn't sing in this video and it makes her look bad.
This is NO tribute.",1400025600,,138,4.111111111111111
4670202,3,B005EZRWKM,The video was blurry but it showed a real side to her. If you have Amazon primet it would be worth watching.,1397174400,,108,3.9545454545454546
4670203,1,B005EZRWKM,"Seemed to have issues of a private nature. I think all people and their parents should be granted privacy. Amy was blessed, gifted by God with beautiful pipes. Focus on good, pray for her family. Death loss is hard to recover from. That is my belief.",1385078400,,250,4.456521739130435

8469352,1,B005EZRWKM,Terrible. The quality of the filming was so poor I only watched the first few minutes and then shut it off. Don't recommend!,1482278400,,124,4.434782608695652
8469353,5,B005EZRWKM,I just love anything this girl does.  I will never grow bored of anything she has to say or do.  so maybe you want to read a comment from someone else.  LOL,1482192000,,156,3.8125

8469357,2,B005EZRWKM,"Another example of somebody slapping together a bunch of low rez stock footage to try to make a quick buck. Amy Winehouse was so cool & I really enjoy her interviews but as for this film, it's cheaply made and has no original content. If you are interested in Amy, it's worth watching on Prime but if I had paid for the DVD, I would have felt ripped off.",1464393600,2,354,4.144927536231884
8469358,5,B005EZRWKM,Lots of insight information!,1463961600,,28,6.25
8469359,3,B005EZRWKM,It seems like some of her interviews were taken from counseling sessions!,1457222400,,73,5.166666666666667
