3490167,5,B001BEK888,"Great action, great fight scenes, skillful actors.  The plots tend to always be the same (avenging a murdered master, rescuing a kidnapped girl, challenging a drug lord, etc.).  But I watch them for the great choreographed fight scenes.",1412812800,,236,5.184210526315789
3490168,2,B001BEK888,"From the creator of the popular Deadly Venoms martial arts series comes the most diabolical entry of them all! The incredible Venoms, a team of skilled fighters, unleash their fury in a bloody frenzy when they infiltrate a mysterious, treasure-filled house designed to entrap and destroy all those who enter it-- as fiendishly and creatively as possible! One of the rarest and most-requested Shaw Brothers action masterpieces, now presented restored and uncut in all its outrageous glory! Includes the original Chinese language version (with English subtitles) as well as the extremely rare original English dubbed track

Lest start off with the pros. First of all it has some very good weapon battles in this film. Many of the best venoms are here and in fine form. I'm shocked at how incredible the traps are in the house of traps. It's hard to think that they were able to accomplish something like this back in that time period. This dvd is clear and has great color and the sound is great. They did a great job on the picture quality.

Now the cons. One of the main venom cast the toad is missing in this film. Sorry,but it just isn't the same with him gone. Also the scorpion is here,but doesn't have one fight scenes. Way to much talking to the point that I got bored at times. The story line wasn't worth following in my opinion. The house of traps was cool,but we didn't get enough screen time with these traps for my taste. To many of the fights are short and end when you're just getting into them. I like weapon based battles,but really like unarmed fighting better. They didn't have any unarmed fighting in this film at all which was a let down for me. I'd rather they mix it up rather than just one thing. I've heard this film is missing at least twenty minutes of footage that was to damaged to restore. I'm betting that was fight scenes. In any case the film seems to short with it missing. I also didn't care for the English voice actors in this film at all. Not saying the other venom films have the best voice actors,but I really didn't care for the ones in this film.

In conclusion I love the venom films,but this one is over hyped just like ten tigers of kwangtung. I'm a big fan of martial arts films and love these guys,but I'd rather watch some of their other films any day. This was a big let down in my opinion.",1295222400,,2338,4.470725995316159
3490169,4,B001BEK888,"I LIKE KUO CHE THE LIZARD FROM THE VENOMS.GOOD MARTIAL ARTS,AND A GOOD LEAD.THIS MOVIE IS VERY RARE FROM SHAW BROTHERS.THIS MOVIE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR A MONA FONG PRODUCTION.LO MANG THE TOAD IS NOT FEATURED OR ALEXANDER FU SHENG.I WENT TO THE MOVIES TO SEE THIS IN MANHATTAN ON HESTER ST.AT THE MUSICAL PALACE.BUY IT.",1278201600,,322,4.767857142857143
3490170,4,B001BEK888,"At this point, Director Chang Cheh was an insane genius and his Venom Mob was flawless. Yes, this is basically the same Chang story about brotherhood, greed, and political corruption with newer and senior Venoms in their usual hero or villain roles and the plot can be hard to follow at times. On the other hand, the costumes, weaponry/gadgets, Star Wars like music, trademark dubbed voices, and superb Martial Arts make this a must for all Venom fans. I just recently learned of the offscreen friction between Kuo Chui and Lu Feng. It was great to see them performing together like true professionals along with Chiang Sheng, Sun Chien (who doesn't fight here unfortunately), Wang Li, Chu Ke, Cheng Tien Chi and several others. Kuo Chui is always a joy to watch. He steals the show once again with his versatility and charisma. After watching House of Traps, I started digging up my other Venoms flicks. Only a few of them look and sound this good. I'm happy to see all of the old Shaw Brothers films being remastered. I'm just craving more Venom reissues like Chinatown Kid, Magnificent Ruffians, and Daredevils for example. Chang and his boys were simply awesome.",1227484800,2,1166,4.8059701492537314
3490171,5,B001BEK888,"Wonderful film.  Indeed this DVD is released with english dubs included.  Venom's fans are very lucky indeed.  The plot may be straightforward but the choreographing is superb in this film.  There is tangible tension between (at then) feuding venom actors Kuo Chui and Lu Feng.  Wang Li (6th venom in my book) gives a stunning performance during the finally fighting.  Enough cannnot be said of his use with that weapon.  This film's bootleg copies down the years were basically unwatchable.  Anyone defaming the remastered release of such a rare venoms treat isn't really much of a VENOM'S fan.  A must have R1 release for Venom's fans.  Here's a quick synopsis:

This rare film had circulated for decades as a bootleg (basically) unwatchable for english speaking fans. i've just veiwed the remastered version and i must say i was very pleased with every aspect of this film. the storyline, the acting, the plot, and especially the fighting. all are spot on solid. the fighting near the end is amazing, especially on Wang Li's and Lu Feng's parts.

One of the princes decides he's gonna revenge his father's premature death. so he builds the House Of Traps to accomplish this end. Lu Feng starts the story off with stealing a precious jade horse presenting it to said prince for proof of his loyalty. they decide to lock it up in the House Of Traps in case the emperor gets any smart ideas. after some appropriate storyline dynamics Kuo Chui shows up with the Pearl Crown to express his loyalty to the scheming prince. Lu Feng and he already exhibit some animosity with Kuo's copy cat offer to the prince. Kuo then heads out to further prove his loyalty.

Chien Hsiao-hou does a great job fighting and acting wise. Though he's in no way the lead actor in the film.

The film has an excellent cast: Wang Li (Lord Bao), Lu Feng (Butterfly Hua), Kuo Chui (Black Fox), Lung Tien-chiang / spearman of death guy (Shen Zhong Yuan), Sun Chien (Yan Chun Min), Chiang Sheng (The River Rat).

The pacing is just fine. there's plenty of action interjecting the dialogue throughout the entire film and the storyline is solid.

The fighting throughout is superb, especially between Kuo Chui and Lu Feng, also near the end between Wang Li and his two opponents Chiang Sheng and his partner. Wang Li does this great move with his weapon. as Wang is engaged with Chiang and co. he locks his two hooked swords together by the hooks and swings them at his adversary then unhooks them and continues his barrage on his two opponents. dosen't sound like much, but the seemless flow to this very well practiced choreographed scene is highly impressive. in fact, the choreographing throughout the film, especially near the end is incredibly well rehearsed. it flows very naturally and comes off extremely realistic as a result. near the end of the film I found myself endlessly rewinding fight scenes to see just how well orchestrated they actually were. we're talking lighting fast, real speed, choreographing here.

(an after thought) You kinda get the feeling Chang Cheh was somewhat in someway trying to accomodate Kuo Chui and Lu Feng during their confrontations so as to not incite (actual) resentment with favoring either's role (or character) with being the more proficient killer while filming House Of Traps for fear of either actor possibly walking angrily off the set, as they are very evenly matched here. i don't know, just passed through my mind while watchin the end fights, especially.

Oh, by the way, i'd definitely give this film a 8.5/10",1218499200,6,3535,4.8148760330578515
3490172,4,B001BEK888,this is not so much a review as it is news. just thought i'd say that as far as i know the IMAGE release of HOUSE OF TRAPS will include the long lost english dub.  sometimes miracles do happen.,1216857600,,193,3.948717948717949
3490173,4,B001BEK888,"As I've written in other reviews, not as many as Morgoth though, I'm a huge Shaw Brothers fan and Chang Cheh completist. Chang and his godsons, the Venoms, bid a fond farewell in 1981 to their four year/nineteen film series with this period piece (Sung Dynasty) martial epic. It's complete with the ubiquitous Chang Cheh traits like brotherhood, chivalry, greed, corruption, honor, copious bloodletting & kung fu madness. I've read that it's a ""complete"" Venom film. Not really, it's missing Lo Mang, Wei Pai & Johnny Wang (who was working with Lau Kar-Leung at the time). However, it does have his core Venoms like Kuo Chui, Lu Feng, the late Chiang Sheng, Wang Li, Sun Chien (who unfortunately doesn't flash his Iron Feet here), along with Yu Tai-Ping, Ricky Cheng, Chu Ke, Chien Hsiao-Hao & ""Spearman"" Lung Tien-Sheng.

First the movie; the trailer states that it's based on a novel. I did not know that, but that would explain its prologue, extended dialogue scenes & a ""period"" plot concerning Prince Yang's quest for revenge against Lord Bao. This involves a revolt, stolen Imperial valuables which are secured in a building filled with lethal traps (the House of the title; one of the traps is a staircase where the stairs become blades) & spies (who are responsible for the martial mayhem.) Many cool venomous fight scenes are tucked inside the complicated plot which also involves two opposing knight-errants, the Black Fox (Kuo Chui) & Butterfly (Lu Feng), a group known as the Four Rats, a list & a hidden painting that reveals the prince's dark past. All this intrigue concludes in a ten minute finale which is absolutely jaw-dropping. The Venoms really outdid themselves with the choreography pitting Wang Li (with double hook swords) versus Chu Ke & Chiang Sheng and Lu Feng (using a spear & darts) versus Kuo Chui (using a short-handled broadsword) which takes place in a huge opulent room decorated with ornate vases/furniture and curtains (kinda like the finale in ""Five Deadly Venoms""). Amazing stuff here.

Now for the DVD; the one I own was released by Bonzai Entertainment who also did a fantastic job with ""The Weird Man"" & ""Ten Tigers of Kwantung"", but they totally botched it with ""The Magnificent Ruffians"" a.k.a. ""The Destroyers"". I don't know what happened there. Anyway, Image Entertainment's DVD has a scratch-free picture, widescreen presentation, Mandarin & English soundtrack in DTS digital, and easy to read English subtitles. Given Image Entertainment's past efforts (who I've praised in other reviews) this DVD expectedly looks as good as the Bonzai version.  However, for those of you looking for an English dub, it's here, but it was those inferior UK voices who also messed up the English dub for ""Legendary Weapons of China."" Just my opinion though.",1216857600,12,2788,5.004310344827586

3490211,3,B001BEK888,"I can only assume that in the early '80s, prolific Shaw Brothers' director Chang Cheh (""5 Deadly Venoms) tried to increase the waning popularity of his films by absolutely stuffing his cast with everyone he could get, though less so than his ridiculously busy ""Ten Tigers of Kwantung"" (where even Alexander Fu Sheng could do the film no favors).  Here he has 4 of the 6 members of his usual Venom mob, with only Lo Meng (""Soul Brothers of Kung Fu"") and Wai Pai (""The Prodigal Son"") missing.  Also hanging around are Chin Siu Ho (""Fist of Legend""), Ricky Cheng (""Five Element Ninjas""), Lung Tien Hsiang (""World of Drunken Master""), and a slue of others.  If the cast weren't so bloated, the story would presumably be a lot easier to follow.

So here's what I think happened. . . During a prologue that throws way too many names at the viewer to possibly keep track of (even with subtitles), we learn that an emperor, at the request of his dying mother, handed over the title to his brother.  The new emperor then inexplicably slaughters his brother, the ex-emperor, then drives the departed man's son to suicide.  As the story officially starts, the suicide guy's son, Zhao Jue (Ngaai Fei, ""Killer Clans""), is now the Prince of Xiangyang, but is still subordinate to the current emperor.  Dudes are now coming around to join the Prince's Federation of Righteousness and his plot to overthrow the emperor.  They must prove their loyalty to the Prince by stealing priceless artifacts from the emperor, which are then kept in the house of traps, along with a list of folks who've pledged their adherence to the Prince's plan.  Meanwhile, some dude named Judge Bao, who apparently works for the emperor, hires scholar Yan Chun Min (Sun Chien, ""Disciples of the 36th Chamber"") as Inspector General of the 9 Provinces of Jing Shiang to investigate the Prince for the stolen artifacts, but in a way that the Prince won't know that the emperor is hip to his little usurpation scheme.

Throughout all this, there's much confusion and a whole lot more folks that get introduced, and there's some hefty deception as to who's really working for who.  And with a cast this large, the viewer isn't the only one who has a hard time keeping track of everyone.  So does the director!  For instance, from what I recall: we only glimpse Judge Bao once, despite his name being mentioned often; we never see the current emperor; and we never officially learn the identity of the emperor's emissary despite a scene strongly indicating its importance.  Also, the prologue would have us believe that the Prince is justified in going after his cousin, but the actions of his goons tells otherwise, then he, like, suddenly seems nice again.

In a film like this, I suppose it's best to concentrate on the fights, and if you like weapons, I doubt that you'll be disappointed.  I prefer hand-to-hand and was a little bummed that there wasn't any, but nevertheless enjoyed what's here.  Brawls between the likes of characters played by Philip Kwok (""Hard Boiled"") and Lu Feng (""Fist of Legend 2: Iron Bodyguards"") were common enough in Chang's films for those cats to have had their technique down to a science by this time, and are indeed fun to watch.

As with all of Image's re-issues of Shaw's flicks, the remastered picture is beautiful and in glorious widescreen (2.35:1).  This one has an English dub available, which I usually prefer with old school kung fu, however this one's dub is fairly painful, and I would recommend watching in the original Mandarin instead.  There are also Spanish subtitles in addition to the English ones.  This is certainly not a bad film, but could've been so much better.  The actual house of traps is also kind of a letdown. Other than having an influence on the ""Cube"" & ""Saw"" franchises, the title temple isn't nearly as cool as it could be, though there's no shortage of gore.  2.5 out of 5 stars.

Now that I've started watching the movie I can't get a refund per Amazon's order cancellation policy.

8282891,3,B001BEK888,"This movie is in Mandarin with English subtitle.  The subtitles do move quickly, so you have to either read fast or do a few rewinds.  It was a little difficult to understand what was going on at first and what side everyone is on, but much later in the film, you will figure it out.  Basically, there is a prince whose father was probably the emperor's cousin or brother and was vying for the emperor's position some time ago and was killed or committed suicide when he lost the position to the current emperor.  The prince of course wants to avenge his father and to be the next emperor.  So, this prince organized a group of rebels  who are thieves and bandits.  They steal major royal treasures and then submit them to the prince who then hides the treasures in his ""House of Traps.""  Think Indiana Jones, but the traps are not so sophisticated.  The most valuable of these treasures is a list of names of all the rebels.  The emperor sends spies and a major intellectual police chief/judge to investigate the prince and to visit the community the prince lives in to identify the rebels.  One of the missions is to have the spies enter the trap house to get this list of rebels.  The police chief has no idea who the other spies are until they show up to help him fight off the rebels and when they identify themselves.  One by one they appeared with a half-broken badge.  It turns out there were lots of spies (six major ones) who are there to help this police chief.  Each time people go into this trap house, they are killed before getting to the treasure.  However, they made a last ditch effort to enter the trap house to attempt to steal this list after one of the spies came and admitted to the chief that the prince is a rebel.  This guy had to be willing to suffer through a torture in order to prove his story about the prince being a rebel is genuine as it is a serious offense to accuse a prince.",1487548800,,1912,4.325842696629214
